<HD>Running From Reebok's Hypocrisy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEXANDER COCKBURN</AU>
<BD>Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other
publications.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Right till the end of January, Dita Sari was preparing to fly from
her home near Jakarta to Salt Lake City to bask today in the
admiration of assorted do-gooders and celebrities mustered by Reebok.
The occasion is the 13th annual Human Rights Awards, overseen by a
board that includes Jimmy Carter and Kerry Kennedy Cuomo.</LD>
<LD>   Make no mistake, the folks who get these awards all have been fine
organizers and activists, committed to working for minorities, the
disenfranchised, the disabled, the underdogs in our wicked world.</LD>
<LD>   But Dita Sari's plan was to accept the airplane ticket from
Reebok, go to Salt Lake City where the world's winter athletes are
now assembled and then, when offered the human rights award, reject
it.</LD>
<TE>   Now, this annual ceremony isn't up there with the Nobels or the
MacArthur grants. Despite the company's best efforts, it's definitely
a second-tier event. Nonetheless, it has paid off for Reebok. Says
Jeff Ballinger, a anti-sweatshop activist who has organized with shoe
workers in Indonesia the past 13 years, "With this kind of ceremony,
Reebok gets its name into respectable company. When they give a prize
to someone like Julie Su, a lawyer for immigrant workers in
California, people who wouldn't be seen dead in Nikes are impressed."</TE>
<TE>   Dita Sari was picked by Reebok's judges because she defied her
government on the issue of independent trade unions. In her own
words: "In 1995, I was arrested and tortured by the police, after
leading a strike of 5,000 workers.... They demanded an increase of
their wages [they were paid only $1 for working eight hours a
day].... This company operated in West Java, and produced shoes for
Reebok and Adidas." She got out of prison in 1999. Since then, she
has been building a union of workers in plants across Java.</TE>
<TE>   Reebok's flacks can brandish armloads of studies, codes,
monitoring reports, guidelines and kindred matter attesting to the
company's dedication to the fair treatment of anyone making consumer
items with the name Reebok printed on them. But nothing has really
changed.</TE>
<TE>   "We've created a cottage industry of monitors and inspectors and
drafters of codes," Ballinger says, "but all these workers ever
wanted was to sit down in dignity and negotiate with their bosses,
and this has never happened."</TE>
<TE>   Due in large part to the efforts of the workers and Western allies
such as Ballinger's Press for Change, the daily wage in Indonesia
rose more than 300% between 1990 and 1997, at which point the Asian
economic crisis struck. Inflation wiped out those gains. Workers'
daily pay is now half what it was before the crisis hit.</TE>
<TE>   These were the points Dita Sari was going to make when she got to
Salt Lake City. Then she learned that Reebok intended to schedule her
and other recipients for public events before the awards ceremony.
Rather than let the company benefit in any way from her presence,
Dita Sari pulled the plug and, at last word, is in Jakarta raising
money for workers left destitute by the worst flooding in decades.
She has sent the speech she was planning to give in Salt Lake City:</TE>
<TE>   "I have taken this award into a very deep consideration. We
finally decide not to accept this.... In Indonesia, there are five
Reebok companies; 80% of the workers are women. All companies are
subcontracted, often by South Korean companies.... Since the workers
can only get around $1.50 a day, they then have to live in a slum
area, surrounded by poor and unhealthy conditions, especially for
their children. At the same time, Reebok collected millions of
dollars of profit every year, directly contributed by these workers.
The low pay and exploitation of the workers of Indonesia, Mexico and
Vietnam are the main reasons why we will not accept this award."</TE>
<TE>   But with its awards, isn't Reebok at least trying to do something
decent? The way Dita Sari sees things, the attempt is a phony. All
the awards in the world, all the window dressing with celebrities
such as Desmond Tutu, Carly Simon, Sting and Robert Redford don't
alter the basic fact that workers in the Third World are being paid
the minimum to make a very profitable product. According to
Ballinger, the labor cost of a $70 pair of sneakers made in China,
Vietnam or Indonesia is $1 or less.</TE>
<TE>   Dita Sari sees the world a lot more clearly than the celebrities
and activists massed at events such as the one organized by Reebok.
Dita Sari turned down $50,000 from Reebok and will go on organizing
against corporate exploitation and government harassment. Do-gooders
should study her fine example and stiffen their spines.</TE>

<HD>Why Blacks Defend Chief Parks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EARL OFARI HUTCHINSON</AU>
<BD>Earl Ofari Hutchinson is the author of "The Crisis in
Black and Black" (Middle Passage Press, 1998).
E-mail:ehutchi344@aol.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stunning decision by Mayor James K. Hahn not to back LAPD Chief
Bernard C. Parks confirmed the fear of many blacks that the Police
Protective League calls the shots at City Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Blacks never bought the league's line that its beef with Parks is
bad management, lousy morale, a rising crime rate and his
take-no-prisoner discipline of officers. The bottom line for them is
that Parks is an African American, and white officers just can't
stomach taking orders from a black police chief.</LD>
<LD>   There are two reasons that blacks are so upset over Hahn's refusal
to back Parks. One is the deep distrust and hostility that many
blacks feel toward the police. The beating of Rodney King, police
shootings in New York, Miami and Cincinnati, racial profiling and the
Rampart scandal reinforce the notion that police routinely beat,
maim, lie and plant evidence on minority suspects. Prominent black
and Latino entertainers, business leaders and even some politicians
complain that police racially harass them.</LD>
<TE>   To be sure, Parks is not the most avid police reformer. It took
the Justice Department's consent decree and pressures from the Los
Angeles City Council to get him to grudgingly mandate that the Los
Angeles Police Department collect racial data on unwarranted traffic
stops. He also raised the wrath of many blacks when he reflexively
defended the officer who gunned down a middle-aged, homeless black
woman.</TE>
<TE>   Yet black leaders remember the confrontations of years past with
then-Chief Daryl F. Gates. They think that a black chief provides
some insurance that police officers won't brutalize the black
community.</TE>
<TE>   The second reason is that black leaders see the fight over Parks
as a way to flex their atrophying political muscle. Parks was the
immediate payback they expected from Hahn for delivering the black
vote that did much to put him in the mayor's seat. If they can't even
wring that concession out of the man who owes them so much and who
has identified more strongly with the black community than any other
white politician in Los Angeles, they're in deep political trouble.</TE>
<TE>   The fast-changing ethnic shifts in South-Central Los Angeles
guarantee that trouble. In the next few years, the number of Latino
residents in South-Central is expected to grow tremendously.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, more Latino immigrants will become citizens and will
become eligible to vote; voter registration drives by Latino
political groups will translate numerical majority into a voting
majority.</TE>
<TE>   Long before that happens, term limits will force City Councilmen
Mark Ridley-Thomas and Nate Holden out of office. Black candidates
trying to succeed them will not have the money, experience or name
recognition to ensure support from their districts' core black
voters.</TE>
<TE>   The third black on the council, Jan Perry, was elected last year,
and Latinos probably soon will be a voting majority in her district.
So it is possible that blacks could lose all three seats that they
currently hold on the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   In the next few weeks, Hahn will get an earful from black leaders.
They will accuse him of pandering to the police union and betraying
the black community. They won't be totally right, because Hahn must
make any decision about Parks based solely on his performance as
chief, not on political or racial favoritism.</TE>
<TE>   But whenever race and politics meet in Los Angeles, duty is never
enough to keep a politician off the hot seat. And that's where Hahn
now sits.</TE>

<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When you watch a show like "Fear Factor," NBC's latest offering in
shock reality TV, in which contestants bob for chicken feet in a vat
of live maggots, eat pig rectums and swim in pools of rotting squid,
you begin to realize at least part of the reason why the great
foreign "they" hate us so much.</LD>
<LD>   Who in the developing world, where suffering and deprivation are
daily bread, wouldn't hate a people so bored, so creatively
resourceless and so overprivileged that they need to manufacture fake
torment for mass public consumption?</LD>
<LD>   Not real torment, mind you, because uncoached, unscripted trials
would, of course, be too much like art to make it into prime time.
After all, the original "Survivor" could have been like "Lord of the
Flies." But with its airbrushed contestants paddling around in the
tide pools of their own vapidity and sophomorically interacting in
prefab scenarios unworthy of a sitcom, we got instead an unfunny
"Gilligan's Island."</LD>
<TE>   The most profound parts of these silly people's real lives play
like such bad fiction that you want to shout "Rewrite!" just as
they're tearfully confronting on national TV the cardboard traumas of
their obscenely sheltered lives.</TE>
<TE>   I want to shoot these people on sight, so it's not hard to imagine
how your average struggling Punjabi, who would no doubt consider
boredom itself a privilege, feels about our sanitized shenanigans. He
may not be watching NBC, but he's getting the gist of our pop culture
from relatives who live here or through his local propagandists to
make the point. They don't have to doctor our signal much to damn us.
We do it ourselves and then some. Our pastimes must seem like the
petty devilry of an unworthy people who, by sheer accident of birth,
exercise the grotesque prerogative of whiling away their lives in
shallow distractions.</TE>
<TE>   The injustice, the vulgarity is monstrous.</TE>
<TE>   These days, what makes the raunchy adolescent stunts of "Fear
Factor" and its ABC rival "The Chair" all the more tasteless is the
real ordeal that Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl is
undergoing in Pakistan--that is if he hasn't been murdered. The
whereabouts and identities of his kidnappers, who claim to be members
of the National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani
Sovereignty, are unknown. After abducting Pearl in Karachi, the
captors sent threatening e-mails to the news media, including
pictures of Pearl with a gun to his head.</TE>
<TE>   Still, here we are at home, gleefully consuming drivel such as
MTV's new game show "Kidnapped," in which contestants pretend to be
hostages and are interrogated about nothing more substantive than
their friends' unexamined lives. Whoever loses is submitted to mock
tortures such as having scorpions dumped on his head or having to eat
chocolate-covered worms.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, back on "Fear Factor," we have the likes of chesty
Chad, a recent "winner," making the following sage pronouncement on
the human condition as he waited to see if he had won the $50,000
prize for which he had happily humiliated himself: "I thought I knew
what stress was. But this is stress."</TE>
<TE>   It's sad and unjust that a talented journalist who was making a
constructive contribution to this nation's role in a global crisis
has to suffer for his country's imagined sins while airheads with
nothing better to do give us all a bad name doing party tricks for
fast cash.</TE>
<TE>   While Pearl's pregnant wife waits for news of her husband's fate,
we who enjoy the luxury of freedom blithely change the channel,
preferring to laugh, squeal and gawk at soulless frippery.</TE>

<HD>Jackson's 'Drive' No. 1 for Third Consecutive Week</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It may have taken Alan Jackson a dozen years of country music stardom
to finally get a No. 1 album on the pop chart, but he's holding on to
that spot. His "Drive" is the nation's best-selling collection for
the third consecutive week.</LD>
<LD>   The album sold 189,000 copies last week, giving it a three-week
total of 842,000 copies, according to SoundScan.</LD>
<LD>   That was enough for an 80,000 lead over Creed's "Weathered," which
remains No. 2. The next seven spots on the Top 10 remained steady
from last week. The positions are claimed, in order, by Linkin Park,
Ludacris, Nickelback, Ja Rule, Nas, Usher and Pink.</LD>
<TE>   The only addition to the Top 10 is Mary J. Blige's "No More
Drama," which jumped from No. 28 to No. 10 thanks to a repackaged
version of the collection. The original album sold more than 1.7
million copies since its release last August, but it regained
momentum after MCA Records re-released it last week with a new cover,
two new songs and two remixes.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's best-selling single continues to be B2K's "Un Huh."</TE>

<HD>Starting a Revolution</HD>
<DH>The band O.A.R. began building a loyal grass-roots
following after friends posted tapes of its live shows online.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The revolution behind the band O.A.R. began small, just a couple of
childhood friends jamming in the basement. And by the time
singer-guitarist Marc Roberge and drummer Chris Culos formed the
latest version of their band while students at Ohio State University,
they were happy just to be playing local bars.</LD>
<LD>   The real revolution began when their friends began taping those
shows and posting them on the Internet. For O.A.R. (a.k.a. Of a
Revolution), the result has been an accelerating grass-roots
following, as Web surfers and others are drawn to the band's mix of
upbeat folk, pop and reggae flavors.</LD>
<LD>   O.A.R.'s third and most recent album, 2001's "Risen," was released
on the band's own Everfine label and debuted at No. 11 on Billboard's
Internet sales chart alongside the likes of Lenny Kravitz and U2.</LD>
<TE>   Though we're only speaking about 40,000 in sales so far, it was a
major accomplishment for an independent band of college students. Now
a busy touring schedule will deliver O.A.R. to the House of Blues on
the Sunset Strip on Sunday and Monday. And not surprisingly, O.A.R.
maintains an open taping policy at shows.</TE>
<TE>   "It just started out with a few buddies taping the shows, putting
them up on the message boards for free," says Roberge. "It turns out
the more they did that, the more other people started picking up on
it. It's been one of the most instrumental things to our career."</TE>
<TE>   Both Roberge and Culos graduated in May. The rest of the
band--bassist Benj Gershman, guitarist Richard On, saxophonist Jerry
DePizzo--is taking time off from school, and the five of them have
been touring off and on since June.</TE>
<TE>   At 23, Roberge has already learned some important lessons of the
road.</TE>
<TE>   "At first it was all fun and games and extremes, seeing how far
you can take this. Then I began not to enjoy that at all and kind of
wanted some kind of routine, professionalism or something."</TE>
<TE>   So he's no longer staying up until 6 a.m. and sleeping until show
time, essentially missing out on seeing the cities where the band was
playing. The current operation is on time and organized. "It's made
it so much easier and fun," he says.</TE>
<TE>   It was a big step from the band's earliest days, playing birthday
parties and mixing original songs with their versions of Pearl Jam
hits.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in high school, 16 years old, trying to have fun," says
Roberge. "I always wrote songs since we were kids. It was a pipe
dream. It's nothing you think will ever happen. OK, we record these
two records, go to college, thinking what a joke it is. Well, it
turned out it happened."</TE>
<TE>   The band's name was drawn from a short story Roberge wrote in 1996
that dealt with the challenges of his own generation of high school
kids.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in high school--the angst-ridden, Nirvana-type high school
kids," he explains. "And I just felt we were [criticized] a lot. When
I looked around, everyone was fine. As much as people figured we were
angry, we were fine."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The sound of the band is smooth, folk-flavored pop, songs that
would fit comfortably beside the Dave Matthews Band. The
introspective "Delicate Few" is a concert highlight for Roberge, a
song from the new album that reflects his own growth from an anxious
youth.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to have a pretty short fuse, and I wanted to describe how
I learned to calm down a little bit and appreciate the people around
us," he says. "To really appreciate the people who make you smile
rather than stress out. It's about a character, but I'm really just
talking about myself. That's the easy way out."</TE>
<TE>   Roberge says the direction of O.A.R.'s sound was never much in
question, explaining, "We just felt we hit the music we wanted to
hear right on the head."</TE>
<TE>   Fans seemed to agree from the beginning. Even while still
full-time students at Ohio State, the band managed to sell 50,000
copies of its three albums. The first two--self-produced
releases--were essentially live recordings of rehearsals. For
"Risen," the band entered a proper recording studio for the first
time.</TE>
<TE>   "We realized we didn't know anything about recording," Roberge
says. "You could say we learned the hard way, but it turned out a
great experience. It was a little bit of a struggle in that you
learned something new every day. It was a humbling experience to
realize you didn't know anything."</TE>
<TE>   Though he admits that listeners can easily tell the difference
between its early work on the new album, the point of the band for
Roberge is an overall good-time vibe.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not polished musicians," he says. "We're not out there
blowing your mind with technique. We just do what we do, and it may
not be the most perfect-sounding thing in the world, but we're having
a good time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O.A.R.'s grass-roots success has inevitably drawn the notice of
major record labels, and the band has been happy to discuss the
future with them.</TE>
<TE>   But Roberge plans to "take the independent thing as far as we
can." The band is set to release a live album, titled "Any Time Now,"
in April.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really doing well on our own," he says. "We're doing things
we never imagined were possible. Business-wise is doing great, the
chemistry between us is great. We are certainly talking to people,
getting to know people, keeping all options open."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, even as the crowds continue to swell, some of O.A.R.'s
earliest friends and champions still manage to come to the shows.</TE>
<TE>   "We could be playing at a 2,000-person venue and our friends still
show up, and they make themselves known," says Roberge. "To us, those
are the guys who put us in that venue. We might as well treat them
like kings."</TE>

food in Billy Morrissette's dark comedy, "Scotland, PA." James LeGros

super-size their lifestyle and become king and queen of their own
greasy castle. Christopher Walken co-stars as Mcduff, a vegetarian
detective out to wreck their happy meals.</TE>

<LD>   Laurie Anderson says her parents told her: "You don't have to
decide what you're going to be, ever. You can be something different
every day if you want." On Saturday, she'll embrace that idea. For
"Happiness," her new mix of staging, music and storytelling, Anderson
went in search of experiences to yank her out of her artistic
doldrums. She served burgers at McDonald's. She worked on an Amish
farm. She canoed through Utah with a Zen master. And then the Sept.
11 attacks--10 blocks from her New York apartment--gave a new spin to
everything.</LD>

<TE>   How many gymnasts can fit on a moving bicycle? How many chairs can
be stacked up as a platform for handstands and other feats of
balance? How small a hoop can a contortionist dive, slink or wiggle
through? These may not be the burning questions of our age, but the
answers generate plenty of oohs and ahhs whenever the Peking Acrobats
perform. A successor to the Great China Circus of the 1920s, the
company became a professional acrobatic troupe in 1958 and, to date,
has made 16 American tours. As family-oriented movement theater,
their show is hard to beat. But, as the company recommends, warn the
kids: Don't try this at home.</TE>

<HD>Theater of the Open Mind</HD>
<DH>With its wide-ranging mixture of movies, the Nuart is a
thriving oasis for the art form.</DH>

<LD>They used to change them almost every night. Rummaging through the
back room for the right letters and numbers, the evening's ticket
seller would perch on a ladder placed on the edge of busy Santa
Monica Boulevard, practically in the shadow of the 405 Freeway. The
titles and times on the neon-laced marquee would then be switched for
the next day's new shows.</LD>
<LD>   Though films at the Nuart theater now usually turn over weekly,
sending employees up the ladder a little less often, that feeling of
hand selection, daring and careful decision-making still permeates.
Even as old-fashioned wooden tills have been replaced by cash
registers and ticket machines, the movie house remains a film lovers'
paradise and an increasing anomaly as the gaps between independent
film and conventional commercial product lessen.</LD>
<LD>   Just a short drive from the power cabals of Hollywood, Beverly
Hills and the major movie studios, the Nuart exists outside that
world with its eclectic mixture of foreign films, revivals,
documentaries and genuinely independent fare. And in a movie
landscape where decisions are increasingly defined and driven by
economics and the currency of stardom, at the Nuart the underlying
forces still favor the idea of film as an art form with edges to be
pushed and new filmmakers to be discovered.</LD>
<TE>   Over the years, many films have begun their lives with runs at the
Nuart, sometimes to little notice, before becoming regarded as
contemporary classics: David Lynch's "Eraserhead," Gus Van Sant's
"Drugstore Cowboy," Jane Campion's "Sweetie" and Mira Nair's "Salaam
Bombay" among them. It is in the offbeat and the classic that the
theater has found its best success, with the biggest box-office hits
to date being Larry Clark's "Kids" and Daniel Myrick and Eduardo
Sanchez's "The Blair Witch Project." Just last year the Beatles
classic "A Hard Day's Night" drew large crowds throughout its run. At
a time when words such as "independent" and "art house" often signify
films as star-studded or easy to swallow as "Gosford Park" or
"Amelie", the Nuart continues to troll the true fringes on behalf of
filmgoers looking for more than six degrees of separation from the
mainstream. Running the gamut from Mexican director Guillermo Del
Toro's horror-suspense ghost story "The Devil's Backbone" to Nagisa
Oshima's "Gohatto," an exploration of forbidden desire in feudal
Japan, perhaps the biggest common denominator among the films
screened there is how little they have in common.</TE>
<TE>   "The Nuart does a tremendous job of showcasing new art-house
films, both American and foreign, as well as doing classic
repertory," says Dennis Bartok, head programmer at the American
Cinematheque. "Along with the Laemmle Sunset 5 [a competitive
independent theater chain], they're really ground zero for art-house
programming and exhibition in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The theater itself is a throwback to a time before stadium seating
and multiplexes. Passing by the small ticket booth and into the
lobby, with its dim light and dark carpets, one gets the slight
feeling of walking into someone's den. The no-frills concession
counter is flanked by assorted alcoves, one featuring a pair of
kitschily painted Greek statues, a whimsical counterpoint to the
assortment of posters for upcoming films and a red neon
"refreshments" sign. The cramped quarters of the lobby give way to
the spaciousness of the theater, and when the feature begins, a
stillness falls over the crowd--provided this isn't one of the rowdy
midnight shows.</TE>
<TE>   Originally built in the early 1930s, the Nuart went through a
number of incarnations before becoming the first theater under the
care of the Landmark Theater Corp. in 1974. "The Nuart is somewhat
aberrant within the business of Landmark as a whole," says Bert
Manzari, executive vice president of the Los Angeles-based chain, now
one of the nation's leading specialized exhibition circuits.</TE>
<TE>   What the theater offers Landmark is a testing ground for the rest
of the circuit--how well a film plays there is a good barometer for
how broad or narrow its appeal will be. And although the Nuart may
not be Landmark's biggest profit center, the theater isn't a loss
leader either, having always shown a positive cash flow, Manzari
says. "I'm sure there are pictures we could put in there that would
gross more, but it would be abandoning the philosophy of what that
theater is about."</TE>
<TE>   The person entrusted with safeguarding that philosophy is Mark
Valen--the final arbiter of what plays at the Nuart. A soft-spoken
Los Angeles native who prefers to think of himself as "ageless," he
managed the theater in the late 1970s before his enthusiasm for the
burgeoning punk rock scene pulled him to England. Working on the
fringes of film exhibition--delivering prints, working projectors,
writing a few freelance articles--he eventually landed as a
co-programmer at London's Scala repertory house. He finally returned
to Los Angles after some 10 years, partly from homesickness, partly
because he never could get used to the English weather, he says. When
the Nuart programming position opened up, Manzari tapped Valen based
on his Scala programming experience.</TE>
<TE>   Though he also handles bookings for commercial 10-plexes in
Seattle and Berkeley, Calif., for the past six years Valen has
programmed the Nuart as well as the Landmark's other "calendar"
theaters in San Francisco; Berkeley; San Diego; Austin, Texas; and
Chicago. As opposed to the practice of most commercial theaters,
where a film plays until people stop coming, a calendar theater locks
in individual films for a week at a time, creating a tight turnover
of films. Though a successful film may reappear at a commercial
theater elsewhere, its time at the Nuart or on other calendar screens
is always limited.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to maintain the profile and personality of this theater,
and I don't want to put in something that seems inappropriate," says
Valen of his process for picking and choosing which films to play.</TE>
<TE>   For him, it's the "too" factor. As he describes it, a film "could
be too anything--too commercial, too badly acted--but if it's not
right, I know it. I'm protective of the Nuart's image, and so I'm
very selective of what I put in there. Which means I turn away a lot
of films, and some films I would like to have, I can't get. To the
best of my ability I try to put on films which best fit the theater,
be it an edgy, offbeat kind of film or something that just needs the
nurturing it may not get in the open marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   "Mark does an outstanding job of keeping their programming fresh,"
says Bartok. "They have an amazing range of programming and really
great taste."</TE>
<TE>   Without Valen's taste, what is seen at the Nuart would certainly
be different. Each year he hits the Toronto and Sundance film
festivals, as well as such local events as the AFI Fest and the Los
Angeles Independent Film Festival, looking for new voices and unseen
gems. He regularly speaks with other programmers and distributors,
sometimes making the case for why a given film should come to the
Nuart, other times fending off things he doesn't like. There is
always a stack of tapes waiting to be watched.</TE>
<TE>   Part science, part strategy and largely instinct, Valen's mission
in programming may be to bring new work to a wider audience, but his
job is to bring ticket buyers to the theater. His understanding of
what Nuart audiences want is constantly evolving, as evidenced by a
new series of Friday night midnight movies, which feature such
oddball commercial films of the 1980s as "Buckaroo Banzai," "The Dark
Crystal" and "Adventures in Babysitting."</TE>
<TE>   "This current midnight series comes from the reaction to when we
showed 'The Goonies' a while back," he says. "It was fun to see an
audience respond ... and it gave me inspiration to try some other
titles. There's a younger audience looking for their own cult
midnight movies, that's interested in seeing them on the big screen.
This new series is very much an experiment for me."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the best of intentions and even positive reviews,
predicting if a film will find an audience is always difficult--as
was the case with Taiwanese director Tsai Ming-liang's mystic
comedy-romance "What Time Is It There?" The director is widely
considered to be among the most exciting filmmakers working today,
but you wouldn't know it by the Nuart ticket sales.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a disappointment," says Valen. "The reviews were good
but used the word 'challenging,' and sometimes that seems anathema to
even our audiences more than it used to be. The Nuart especially is
profiled as a theater that's either discovering new filmmakers or
nurturing filmmakers with a particular--though I wouldn't say,
limited--audience."</TE>
<TE>   It is that very audience--small perhaps, but fiercely loyal and
incredibly varied--that made the spot next door to the Nuart an ideal
one when a group of disgruntled video store clerks decided to open
its own shop in 1999. As Cinefile co-owner Hadrian Belove explains,
"We chose the location based on the Nuart; that was very consciously
done. When we opened the store, we thought we'd get a certain amount
of crossover, but we very quickly became aware that it was like
having a free advertisement. Pretty much every day we would reach
exactly our market just by being here."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Saturday night, the Nuart buzzes with crowds coming
down to see the science-fiction epic "Metropolis," the latest
achievement in the popular Japanese anime animation style. Matching
the offbeat mixture of films shown at the theater, the glow of the
marquee adds a garish glamour to a crowd full of unlikely pairings. A
single father polls passerby as to whether the PG-13 film is
appropriate for his two young daughters, while a solitary comic-book
fan tries hard to avoid personal interactions.</TE>
<TE>   An astounding assortment of fashionable eye-wear passes by, and
expensive spike-heeled boots wait in line behind scuffed sneakers.
Some leave the theater for the open doors of Cinefile, while others
head to a small coffee shop around the corner, where they will
discuss the film's continuation of themes from the anime masterpiece
"Akira." Especially since the arrival of Cinefile, the Nuart has
become a nexus for those hopelessly enthralled by the movies--the
type of person who will stay up until early in the morning to see a
screening of "Red Dawn" or hunts with dedication for a rare samurai
film. And then there is Marc Heuck.</TE>
<TE>   An assistant manager at the Nuart, Heuck has taken a step beyond
personal obsession by offering his for public consumption. He has
appeared on Comedy Central's "Beat the Geeks," where contestants pit
their trivia knowledge against a panel of self-styled experts, since
its premiere last year. Heuck is its resident movie geek.</TE>
<TE>   Unshaven, with a bedraggled mop of hair and a shabby black
overcoat, Heuck has an intense yet slightly distracted demeanor and
is clearly among his own as he tears tickets and periodically checks
on the ticket booth or concession stand. With a Bartleby-like
inscrutability, he declines to be interviewed, sending out as a proxy
Chris Luessmann, a UCLA theater and film student and the evening's
projectionist.</TE>
<TE>   Having started up the 10 p.m. show, Luessmann relaxes just outside
the theater's glass front doors during the momentary lull and talks
about the regulars--the "Diet Coke Guy," for one--before mentioning a
1932 Nuart program he recently bought off EBay. ("It was just a few
dollars," he says and shrugs. "Who would care but one of us?")</TE>
<TE>   Though he has only worked at the Nuart for a couple of years, he
knows the theater's history, its legends. That comedian Andy Kaufman
made his last public appearance at the Nuart for a screening of his
film "My Breakfast With Blassie" is one. Another is "The Rocky Horror
Picture Show" DVD, which features the live cast that appears at the
Nuart for a midnight show every Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Luessmann stumbles for a moment on the title of a popular cult
film that used footage from a cast and crew reunion at the Nuart on
its DVD. Suddenly from the other side of the glass Heuck leans in,
speaking through the crack of the door: "Spider Baby," he says to no
one in particular, before returning to his look of studied
disinterest.</TE>
<TE>   Having been the first theater in Los Angeles to show work by
directors ranging from John Waters to John Woo, the Nuart is for many
a de facto film school and a vital part of their personal film
education. "It was where I saw my first Pedro Almodovar film, 'Law of
Desire,' " recalls Ernest Hardy, a film critic for the LA Weekly and
onetime Nuart employee. "It completely blew me away, one of those
moments where you realize all the possibilities of what cinema can
be. Not to say I wouldn't have eventually seen it somewhere, but the
Nuart was where that really happened for me."</TE>
<TE>   Valen is well aware of the importance the theater plays in the
city's cultural landscape and the personal connections often created
by the films he shows. "I always look at the theater as a part of a
community. I try to pick films that will be a discovery for
audiences."</TE>
<TE>   American Cinematheque's Bartok believes the strategy is working:
"Every time I look at the Nuart calendar, it makes my teeth hurt,
because they show such great stuff."</TE>

<LD>Call them cineastes, enthusiasts or movie buffs, but Los Angeles has
enough of them that several businesses and institutions cater to
their hobby. Here are a few where you'll be discussing the
intersection of Jean-Luc Godard and Hal Needham in the films of
Johnnie To in no time.</LD>
<LD>   Cinefile</LD>
<LD>   11280 Santa Monica Blvd., West L.A., (310) 312-8836.</LD>
<TE>   The newest addition to the elite ranks of hangouts for the
movie-obsessed, this video store next door to the Nuart was started
by a group of employees defecting from the West L.A. video shop
Vidiots. In a relatively short time, they've assembled a great
collection, including lots of stuff that's out of print or was never
released in the U.S. They even have a deejay on Friday nights.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian Theatre at the American Cinematheque</TE>
<TE>   6712 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 466-3456.</TE>
<TE>   Its summertime program of swinging '60s films is a must-see, as
are its salutes to Technicolor and 70-millimeter films. The programs
are the ultimate fix for the movie devotee, in that they often
celebrate the qualities of the film as an object (format, printing
process, etc.) as much as the narrative or style. The theater also
shows foreign films and has the occasional sneak screening of hipper
Hollywood fare.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Edmunds Cinema and Theater Bookshop</TE>
<TE>   6644 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 463-3273.</TE>
<TE>   Can't find that early Martin and Lewis book, the screenplay to
"Coming Apart" or the faux memoirs of Chuck Barris? Look no further
than Larry Edmunds, one of the country's premier spots for books on
film and the performing arts. Book City across the street was
recently forced out by Hollywood &amp; Highland-inspired rent increases,
but for now this landmark seems secure.</TE>
<TE>   Laser Blazer</TE>
<TE>   10587 W. Pico Blvd., West L.A., (310) 475-4788.</TE>
<TE>   Probably the city's best selection of DVDs for sale or rent. From
highfalutin Criterion editions to dubious Asian erotica, it seems to
have it all. It also still has a large selection of rental
laserdiscs, and, as any true media junkie knows, many of the
commentaries and special features on earlier laserdisc editions are
not in newer DVD releases.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Herrick Library at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences Center for Motion Picture Study</TE>
<TE>   333 S. La Cienega Blvd., Beverly Hills, (310) 247-3020.</TE>
<TE>   The name may be a mouthful, but this is a terrific resource.
Housed in a beautiful building that was once a water treatment plant,
the academy's noncirculating library features an outstanding
collection of books, photographs, clippings, posters and all sorts of
interesting whatnot.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The religious may be dashing to Mecca, and health seekers may be
heading to Lourdes, but the only pilgrimage a film and television
buff need make is to North Hollywood. Deep in the dense urban
overgrowth, hidden way back off Vineland Avenue, is Eddie Brandt's
Saturday Matinee.</LD>
<LD>   With 59,000 movies and television shows available on videotape to
rent, 3 million movie posters in stock to purchase and an additional
22 tons of lobby cards and old show-business photos, it is a
mom-and-pop mother lode of movies and memorabilia.</LD>
<LD>   If you've given up searching for that obscure film or television
episode that you haven't seen in decades--the one you can never
forget--here's the good news: It's almost certainly at Eddie
Brandt's. But this is not your kid's Blockbuster. Strongly
reminiscent of the funky record store in "High Fidelity" with an
ambience that combines musty Texas roadhouse and Navy Quonset hut, it
causes first-time visitors to stare in awe at row upon row of tapes,
organized alphabetically and subdivided by movies and TV. Besides
American TV movies, episodes and pilots, the Eddie Brandt collection
includes 6,000 documentaries, 8,000 foreign films and 2,000 silent
films.</LD>
<TE>   The remaining 43,000 cassettes contain a mammoth sci-fi, horror
and fantasy selection, as well as almost every Hollywood movie ever
made, from current hits to obscure titles like "Jesse James Meets
Frankenstein's Daughter" and "Avenging Disco Godfathers."</TE>
<TE>   According to Donovan Brandt, Eddie's son, who runs the store on a
daily basis, Eddie Brandt, 81, began collecting film mementos as a
young movie theater usher. After World War II he moved to L.A. and
became a gag- and songwriter for Spike Jones. A minor Hollywood
legend himself, the elder Brandt co-wrote the Spike Jones classic
song "Cocktails for Two" and was one of the main writers for the
cartoon "Beany and Cecil."</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1960s, Eddie Brandt approached the National Screen
Co., which had distributed movie posters, still photos and lobby
cards to the studio-owned theater chains for decades. Once a film had
finished its run, National Screen would take back all the display
memorabilia and store it. When no one would have guessed the future
value of cinema collectibles, Brandt made the leap from collector to
entrepreneur by buying two National Screen warehouses full of movie
history, essentially paying by the pound.</TE>
<TE>   He opened Saturday Matinee in 1968, and some of those original
hauls still can be found in the inventory today, including items
ranging from $6 photos of the stars (black-and-whites of their
houses, cars and pets) to $1,000 mint-condition, classic western
movie posters. According to Claire Brandt, Eddie's wife, who manages
the poster/photo part of the shop, they once sold a half-sheet Bela
Lugosi "Dracula" poster for a few hundred dollars that today is
valued at $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Brandt was also known in early Hollywood for collecting
16-millimeter films and throwing weekly bashes at which cinema
aficionados would take turns showing their own collected movies.
Ultimately, this interest led to the huge VHS tape rental collection.
Today this part of the store attracts home enthusiasts and Hollywood
players alike. "Every major studio, network, and production company
has an account with us," Donovan Brandt says. "I can even predict
what kinds of movies are coming out by the kinds of tapes the
development execs are in here renting."</TE>
<TE>   The aisles are jammed with quirky film enthusiasts, writers,
actors and directors all looking for material to inspire their own
projects. Celebrities such as Quentin Tarantino, Kirsten Dunst and
Richard Crenna are regulars, according to Donovan. But the real star
of the show is Donovan Brandt, who has an encyclopedic knowledge of
movies, total recall of their inventory and an uncanny resemblance to
David Spade.</TE>
<TE>   A customer hollers out, "I need scenes of cars teetering on
cliffs!" And, with a blink of his eye, as if his brain is
downloading, Donovan will rattle off the titles of 14 movies that the
customer needs to rent. A costume designer barges in: "I'm looking
for Korean soldiers wearing winter gear!" Donovan shifts modes and
replies effortlessly, "Alan Ladd, 'All the Young Men,' 1960, left
side, aisle 1."</TE>
<TE>   The place fairly hums with customer appreciation. One lady in the
checkout line wears a glazed look and a silly grin. A first-time
customer, she's been looking for the 1941 movie "Hellzapoppin'" for
20 years. She clutches the cassette that represents the end of her
quest. "And here it is!"</TE>

p.m.; Saturdays, 8:30 a.m.-5 p.m.; closed Sundays and Mondays. Tape

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>* The publisher of Feral House Books ("Apocalypse Culture,"
"Apocalypse Culture II," "Lords of Chaos") and author of the new book
"Extreme Islam."</LD>
<LD>   Russ Meyer's Haunt: I do like Musso &amp; Frank. Last time I was
there, with my girl, Marti, I ordered the prime rib and I usually
have a Bombay martini straight up. Russ Meyer is often there. Close
your eyes and you can picture Ed Wood having a drink there--though I
think he went to that old place now closed next to Paramount
Pictures, Nickodell's.</LD>
<LD>   The Devil's Grandson: There is a new store that I find interesting
on Sunset Boulevard, near Gardner Street, across the street from
Meltdown, called Odium, that's owned by Stanton LaVey, Church of
Satan founder Anton LaVey's grandson. I'm not sure how long it is
going to stay opened, but it's a very bizarre thing with a lot of
cultic rapture going on. They have Manson Family interests and Nation
of Islam interests, and extremely strange paintings, art, videos,
books and posters, like a poster of wrestlers without hands from
Germany.</LD>
<TE>   People Watching: My office is in downtown's historic core on
Spring Street, so I do enjoy walking around there sometimes on the
weekends. It looks like a Joe Coleman painting. It's very exotic in
its downward slide. I don't feel endangered by it, necessarily, but
on the other hand, it's pretty remarkable. If you want to look at
people, don't go to the Third Street Promenade. The wild ones are
downtown on Main Street and Los Angeles Street.</TE>
<TE>   The Deli in the Alley: There's a small street called St. Vincent
Court between Broadway and Hill off of 7th Street. You can't even
call it a street, more like an alley. And you go down this alley and
it feels like you are in New York City. There's a number of
interesting little deli-type places that sell cold cuts, cheese, rice
and whatnot. This one deli makes really great sandwiches. They are in
these old, decaying, large buildings, and they are all Armenian and
Lebanese.</TE>
<TE>   The Artichoke Capital: I go to the Bay Area, where my distributors
are, a couple of times a year, and I used to like to stop at the
giant artichoke in Castroville, a building in the shape of a big
artichoke announcing the artichoke capital of the world. But now it's
closed. I was really sad to hear that.</TE>

<LD>"School for Wives"--The world recently became keenly aware that some
men still think women should remain cloistered, virtually uneducated
and completely submissive. This is also the opinion of Arnolphe, the
wonderful and horrible hub of Moliere's "The School for Wives,"
written in 1662. Arnolphe goes to great lengths to train the perfect
wife, using the above guidelines, only to receive one of the most
humiliating comeuppances in the history of comedy. South Coast
Repertory's leaders certainly weren't thinking of the Taliban when
they decided to produce the play, nor is there any evidence onstage
that director David Chambers wanted to emphasize that train of
thought. Nonetheless, it's hard not to think of the Afghan parallel
when Arnolphe speaks of the importance of wives' keeping their "eyes
low," or when the suitor who wrecks Arnolphe's plan talks of how love
has "begun to lift the veil." That parallel is just one more layer on
a staging that is already dazzling in two of its central components:
a virtuoso performance by Dakin Matthews as Arnolphe and a
provocative set designed by Darcy Scanlin, whose work helps usher us
into Arnolphe's mind.</LD>

<HD>She's a Future Star, Honest</HD>
<DH>Nickelodeon's teen comic Amanda Bynes lands her first movie
role in 'Big Fat Liar,' opening Friday. Admirers say it's the first
of many.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL P. LUCAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TV star Amanda Bynes can giggle at the memory of sitting for an
interview when she was 12--although she didn't exactly sit.</LD>
<LD>   "I was so energetic," she admits, recalling the evening she spent
mostly bounding around her backyard, dashing around the pool,
shrieking at an oversized spider hanging in the garden and spinning
under the stars in her denim playsuit, singing her own little song
about beautiful gowns and diamonds. "Oh, it was like, calm down,
child."</LD>
<LD>   Now almost 16, Amanda has indeed calmed down. Nickelodeon's
exuberant, funny-faced little comedy star has grown into a
self-assured young person who's quite warm and hospitable around the
house--although maybe she'll gush a little over pictures of brother
Tom and new sister-in-law Melissa's wedding. And as for her future,
well, she'll be getting her driver's license soon, so she's pretty
excited about that.</LD>
<TE>   The funny thing is that a lot of other people are excited about
her future, too--for a much different reason. Her first feature film,
"Big Fat Liar," opens Friday and, although it stars Frankie Muniz
("My Dog Skip" and TV's "Malcolm in the Middle") and Paul Giamatti
("Saving Private Ryan" and "Man on the Moon"), it's the newcomer who
has show business professionals dropping phrases like "a young
Cameron Diaz or Goldie Hawn." Amanda has already signed a pilot deal
to star in a situation comedy on the WB network and studio executives
are poring over scripts for her all-but-certain big-screen projects
to come.</TE>
<TE>   "The sky's the limit for her. The world is her oyster," said
Jordan Levin, the WB entertainment president who's developing the
untitled sitcom about a teenager living in Manhattan with her older
sister. "Amanda's funny, talented, poised. And she's cute."</TE>
<TE>   And he's hardly alone in his enthusiasm. Her movie colleagues
predict audiences will love her because she hurls every ounce she has
into her role and, as Giamatti says, she has a remarkable knack for
timing her delivery for laughs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd never worked with kids before, but I have to say she's very
good," Giamatti said. "She brought a high level of improvisational
comedy to her performance." How good is she? "Liar" director Shawn
Levy suggests moviegoers closely watch the scene at the beginning of
Act 2 in which Frankie and Amanda's characters first encounter the
producer's receptionist.</TE>
<TE>   "Amanda doesn't have a line, but the whole scene is constructed
around her reaction shots," he said. "She is so alive on screen and
so effervescent as a presence, it's a gift to a director to have that
to work with." Levy adds bluntly: "Within two years she's going to be
carrying movies left and right. There is no comedian anywhere near
that age range like Amanda Bynes. She is an absolute original."</TE>
<TE>   It's a funny thing, too, that almost any kid in America who
watches TV could have told him that long ago, because kids have
watched Amanda grow up as she's tickled them by the millions.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, she's been honing her craft before live audiences for
most of her life. Her father, Rick--as a longtime fan of stand-up
comedy, he helped Amanda write jokes for her act at the Laugh
Factory--nurtured the future star. "When she was 4, I used to say I
wish that Spielberg could come over and watch her," he said. Since
that seemed unlikely, he shepherded Amanda and older sister Jillian
to community theater. When Jillian had a starring turn in "Wait Until
Dark," Amanda was too young to perform, so she sat in the audience
reciting her sister's lines.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda was 7 when she broke into show business as a spunky orphan
in "Annie" at the Camarillo Youth Center. With mom Lynn shuttling her
from school to rehearsal, she never stopped. Stage roles followed,
and her first raves appeared when a reviewer for this newspaper
called her "sensational" as Scout in "To Kill a Mockingbird" (at the
Arts Council Center in Thousand Oaks) and "even more impressive" in
the lead as Mary in "The Secret Garden" (at the Conejo Players
Theater).</TE>
<TE>   When she was 9, Rick enrolled her in a stand-up comedy class in
Hollywood. On graduation night at the Laugh Factory, she was spotted
by former child actors Dan Schneider and Brian Robbins ("Head of the
Class"), who were scouting talent for Nickelodeon.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda was 10 when she debuted on "All That," Nick's sketch-comedy
series where she refined her physical comedy chops--again before live
audiences. Her tour de force was "Ask Ashley," about a sweet advice
columnist who worked herself into a rage over invariably inane
requests for advice.</TE>
<TE>   On the contest series "Figure It Out," she gamely splashed around
in coatings of the show's signature green slime. Now Nick is running
the third season of "The Amanda Show," in which she gives herself
over to wacky teen characters like the classroom mob moll Candy
Tulips--pleasing kids and, no doubt, many an older brother, too. And
therein lies her promise.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd love to see her have a career like Goldie Hawn," said
Schneider, "Liar" screenwriter and a creative force driving a lot of
Nick's comedy programming. "Goldie has that rare ability to be cute,
sweet, vulnerable, real, and make you really feel something special
about a character."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Schneider and others who work with her say that Amanda's on-camera
warmth is a glow from her solid upbringing in a close-knit family.
She lives with her parents and her dogs Tootsie and Betty in a roomy
suburban ranch house north of Los Angeles. Jillian is away at
college, but her grandmother, Anne Organ, lives next door. Her home
life comes first. Homework is priority No. 1. Dad keeps a close eye
on her moviegoing, steering her away from R-rated fare, "and even
hard PG-13s; they're the same as Rs," Rick Bynes said.</TE>
<TE>   He's there to help her shrug off bad press--as when a supermarket
tabloid last year reported leeringly that Amanda and Frankie were
dating up a storm--when they were 14. Their chemistry on screen in
"BFL" is certainly reminiscent of Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney's,
and they've been appearing together socially, but Amanda insists
they're just buddies. "When my friends who work in the business come
over, they say, 'You live in another world, it's like so far away,'"
she said. "But a big part of who I am is that I still am a normal kid
in the same place where I was born." So, in many ways, she's as
normal as her fans.</TE>
<TE>   A straight-A 10th-grader (English is her favorite subject), she
loves to shop, watch a little TV--she likes "Friends," "Felicity" and
"The Gilmore Girls." She chats with pals online or on the phone. Of
course, she has a career to manage too.</TE>
<TE>   So one evening recently she was relaxing at home, curled up on the
sofa, reading "Memoirs of a Geisha"--a novel Steven Spielberg has for
a long time wanted to turn into a movie, she pointed out--about
Chiyo, a pretty little girl who grows up to become the beautiful
Sayuri, who's enslaved by the passions of wealthy men.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda was still a bit hoarse after her first-ever press junket
promoting the movie--which meant sitting for nearly 100 interviews.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to say, 'Stop. My voice is gone,'" she said, pulling her
sleeves down over her fists and cuddling them under her chin. "I had
to go drink some tea."</TE>
<TE>   In her cozy living room far from the bright lights, Amanda comes
across as serious about life, insightful about her work,
philosophical about her world to come.</TE>
<TE>   She dreams about college--going to UC Berkeley, maybe, studying
business--but she realizes she may need to stay in Southern
California near work. She dreams about getting married and having
children. "I want to have the freedom to not work if I don't want
to," she said. "To be with my kids if I want to." She evinces sharp
instincts, deftly deconstructing the latest teen movies--without
identifying a role that she would have liked to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I see careers that I like, like Kirsten Dunst's, for instance,"
she said. "She did 'Bring It On,' which was all cute and fun, and
then she did 'Crazy/Beautiful,' which showed a lot of truths about
teenagers that have angst and sadness and trouble. So she isn't
afraid of trying different things, becoming different people."</TE>
<TE>   Amid all the glowing praise, Bynes has had her share of career
disappointments. While "The Amanda Show" pilot took off, another one
she shot about a washed-up child star who has to go home to her small
town and be a normal kid again didn't get picked up.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't work," she shrugged. "I saw it." So she remains
realistic about the process. "I try not to get too excited until
something actually happens," she said, looking forward to her
upcoming pilot at the WB. (The WB is part-owned by Tribune Co., owner
of the Los Angeles Times.)</TE>
<TE>   "I just figure if it happens, then that's wonderful and if not,
then I just stay in school longer and wait for the next thing." And
she's philosophical, too, when people ask why the child star didn't
make any movies when she was still a child.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the type of person who believes that everything happens for a
reason, and at the time that it's supposed to," she said. "So now ...
other ideas are coming up for other movies and everything is just
happening really wonderfully."</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Amanda reflected on "Geisha." The little girl in
the book grew up and, in a fashion, lived happily ever after. She was
crying when she read the closing lines, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The message is wonderful," she said. "[Sayuri] ended up living
her life the way she wanted to. It ended up being really nice for
her, in her situation and her circumstances. It was a really
wonderful, a moving story."</TE>

<HD>A Sexy, New Madam in Town</HD>
<DH>Ann-Margret stars in a well-honed production of 'The Best
Little Whorehouse in Texas.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Will wonders never cease? Some theater folks have seen fit to put on
a show about values--about family, love and tenderness, about civic
duty and local pride.</LD>
<LD>   That show, of course, is "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,"
with its instructive tale about bordello workers who create a
nurturing environment for themselves while ministering to a whole
state. The 1978 musical has returned in a production meant to serve
as a vehicle for Ann-Margret. It's making its only Southern
California tour stop at the Orange County Performing Arts Center.</LD>
<LD>   Ann-Margret is in many ways well suited to the central role of the
bordello's proprietress, Mona Stangley. Her voluptuous looks, at 60,
and her husky purr of a voice are exceptionally sexy, while her
ever-surprising emotional reserves lend depth to the more dramatic
scenes.</LD>
<TE>   Her singing, though, is a wild card. She masks her limitations
well, producing a pleasant, whiskey-soaked buzz in her lower register
and carefully punching higher when necessary. But Mona has five big
solos, and the actress quickly exhausts her bag of tricks. Oddly, a
song written specially for her--a bittersweet '70s pop number called
"A Friend to Me," which closes the show--sits too high in her voice
and doesn't display her to best advantage.</TE>
<TE>   As the sheriff who's sweet on Miss Mona, Gary Sandy also delivers
mixed results. No stranger to musical comedy, though he's best-known
for the late-'70s sitcom "WKRP in Cincinnati," Sandy amusingly rolls
cuss words around in his mouth as though he's enjoying a fine chewing
tobacco. But he doesn't have the low notes for his big song, and
something--perhaps the country twang he adopts for the number--throws
him consistently off-pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Love them or hate them, though, they're backed by a finely honed
production.</TE>
<TE>   In directing and choreographing this revival, Thommie Walsh, the
associate choreographer of the original Peter Masterson- and Tommy
Tune-directed production, has retained many of that version's
cleverest elements.</TE>
<TE>   Naughty pleasures--mostly PG-rated--are proffered in abundance,
especially in the boot-stomping dance of sexual anticipation
performed by the winning Texas Aggie football team as it heads to the
bordello to claim its reward, and in the sultry languishing about of
Miss Mona's girls in their lacy underthings.</TE>
<TE>   The men have been chosen for their long legs (the better to show
off the fancy footwork), while the women have been selected for their
curves. But their voices are their best assets. When the ladies break
into harmony in the hauntingly beautiful "Hard Candy Christmas," you
just want to weep with pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas," Orange County Performing
Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Today and Friday, 8
p.m.; Saturday, 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday, 2 and 7:30 p.m. Ends Sunday.

<HD>Finding Gems in African Film Fest</HD>
<DH>Diverse and emotional, many movies in the 10th annual event
are by first-time directors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Festivals can be a decidedly mixed bag, but they also can offer rich
treasures. The latter is the case with selections previewed for the
10th annual Pan African Film Festival. They are strong on emotional
engagement and accessibility and many are first-time features from a
diverse and talented group of filmmakers. The festival, which began
Wednesday, runs through Feb. 18 at the Magic Johnson Theatres.</LD>
<LD>   A highlight among the many sidebar events will be the appearance
at 6:15 p.m. Sunday of Amir Baraka, with festival executive director
Ayuko Babu, to discuss "Art as a Political Tool" and to receive a
lifetime achievement award. The 1966 film "Dutchman," from the play
Baraka wrote when he was known as Leroi Jones, will be screened at 8
p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Stefanie Sycholt's "Malunde" (Friday at 1 p.m.) takes the classic
combination of a gruff man and an irresistible little boy, whose
relationship evolves into one resembling that of father and son, to
probe the lingering, bitter aftermath of apartheid. Ian Roberts plays
a craggy ex-soldier reluctantly taking a job wholesaling furniture
polish who winds up giving a ride from Johannesburg, South Africa, to
Cape Town to a bright, self-reliant, 11-year-old black street kid
(Kagiso Mtetwa) eager to be reunited with the mother whose brutal
boyfriend, he says, caused him to run away. Sycholt's feature debut
is a wonderful film of universal appeal, overflowing with humor and
adventure offsetting pain and loss, allowing us to see that in some
ways those who enforced apartheid were almost as apt to become
brutalized by the racist system as those it oppressed.</TE>
<TE>   Gavin Hood's "A Reasonable Man" (Friday at 6:15 p.m.), also an
impressive first film, is a crackling courtroom drama. Hood, once a
lawyer himself, plays a barrister defending a hapless Zulu youth
(Loyisa Gxwala) who inadvertently killed an infant when he lashed out
at what he believed to be an evil spirit lurking in a darkened hut.
Based on an actual incident, the film reveals the challenge facing
post-apartheid South Africa in defining what is a reasonable man in a
multicultural society and the struggle to administer a uniform
standard of justice.</TE>
<TE>   Hood's barrister, also a haunted veteran of the war in Angola, is
a man alone, because the prosecution team, though black, is made up
of proud Anglicans who regard native African religions as
superstition; this view is shared by the judge (the late Nigel
Hawthorne in a subtle portrayal), who nevertheless may be able to
look beyond his heretofore unconscious bias. Hood, a UCLA film school
alumnus, assumes his writing, directing and acting with aplomb and
makes a charismatic leading man.</TE>
<TE>   Chad-born Issa Serge Coeleo's beautiful and harrowing "Daresalam"
(Friday at 10:25 p.m.), yet another powerful debut feature, is set in
a fictional North African country. A brutal government bears down on
a peaceful village, one among many, for taxes beyond the people's
capacity to pay. Government massacre triggers revolution as we follow
the thoughtful Djimi (Haikal Zakaria) as he and best friend Koni
(Abdoulaye Ahmat) are swept up and transformed in ultimately
different ways by cataclysmic events. "Daresalam" presents human
chaos amid settings of great natural beauty, accompanied by an
evocative score.</TE>
<TE>   German documentarian Jorg Bundschuh got to John Lee Hooker just in
time--the blues legend died last June--which makes "John Lee Hooker:
That's My Story" (Sunday at 11:30 a.m.) as invaluable as it is
engaging and comprehensive. The portrait of Hooker, who was born in
the Mississippi Delta circa 1917, that emerges through his music and
words and those of his family, friends, colleagues and admirers is of
a proud, dignified man who drew deeply from his heart and soul in
creating music.</TE>
<TE>   Bundschuh gracefully blends archival performance footage and
glimpses of the South, past and present, to round out his archetypal
story of an illiterate sharecropper who through talent, hard work and
a resilient, humorous spirit overcame adversity to win international
acclaim. By the time Bundschuh caught up with Hooker, the King of the
Boogies was still a vibrant, dapper figure despite the frailties of
age. In his pride and intelligence, Hooker makes it clear that in
looking back he preferred to focus on the considerable good fortune
that came his way. He did not deny, however, the painful realities of
touring in the segregated South in the 1950s nor the fact that for
years he was aware that he was cheated out of royalties and pay for
club dates.</TE>
<TE>   Hooker ended up comfortable, revered and even on warm terms with
his ex-wife and confident that his music would endure. An honest
performer if ever there was one, he admits that even after getting
everything he ever wanted in life, he could "never get enough love
from the people."</TE>
<TE>   (Note: Some films will be repeated during the course of the
festival.) (213) 896-8221.</TE>
<TE>   Among the films screening at the James Bridges Theater in Melnitz
Hall in the final weekend of the UCLA Film Archives' 12th annual
"Celebration of Iranian Cinema" is Ali Shah-Hatami's "Shrapnels in
Peace" (Saturday at 7:30 p.m.), a near-surreal evocation of a
post-apocalyptic landscape in which survivors scavenge relentlessly
for scrap to sell in a struggle to survive. The central figures are
two boys tempted to enter the minefields in search of more lucrative
loot. In the face of bleakness and despair Shah-Hatami nevertheless
manages to create a hypnotic spell with the striking, floating
quality of his images. When and where this devastation has occurred
is deliberately never revealed; we could just as easily be looking at
a war-ravaged region in Afghanistan as the aftermath of either the
Iran-Iraq conflict or the Gulf War. (310) 206-FILM.</TE>

<DH>Mural tours and an art show shed light on lesser-known L.A.

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a cityscape splashed through with 1,500 paintings and mosaics that
unfold on expanses of concrete along the sides of freeways, on school
and store walls, the predominantly black neighborhoods of Compton and
Watts are home to some of the more compelling pieces.</LD>
<LD>   A new mural art show, a series of slide lectures and two upcoming
tours of mural sites in the South Los Angeles, downtown and Mid-City
districts beginning this month highlight these works.</LD>
<LD>   This rich tapestry of street art is most often associated with
Latino culture, said Robin Dunitz, a mural historian who curated the
"Walls of Heritage, Walls of Pride: African American Murals"
exhibition at the Cal State Dominguez Hills art gallery.</LD>
<TE>   Through photographs and original works, the show traces the
historical journey of black mural art from the walls of Southern
black colleges in the '20s to the streets of contemporary urban
America. "You don't think about African American culture in
connection with murals, but it's a tradition that stretches back to
the Harlem Renaissance," said Dunitz.</TE>
<TE>   As she began sleuthing about town for murals ultimately featured
in her 1992 guidebook to L.A. street art, Dunitz kept stumbling
across what she called "very important and very beautiful" wall
paintings in the black community. She wanted to share that experience
and began busing art students, teachers and German tourists to South
L.A. for daylong tours of the works.</TE>
<TE>   The mural tours are a big draw, especially for wary visitors from
the Westside, "world travelers who are not afraid to walk around
Bogota or Calcutta but won't go to Compton by themselves," said
Dunitz.</TE>
<TE>   This Saturday she will co-lead the first of two tours, focusing on
mural sites clustered around Watts and Compton. The planned itinerary
zigzags from the Cal State Dominguez Hills exhibition to an Alameda
Street clinic, then skips over the railroad tracks for a stop at the
Alma Reaves Woods branch of the Los Angeles Public Library in Watts
and a visit to nearby Watts Towers.</TE>
<TE>   The tour will end below a roaring stretch of the 105 Freeway,
where Willie Middlebrook's "Portrait of My People # 619" (1995)
anchors a collage of unsung community figures into the street-level
foot of the Avalon/I-105 Green Line Station. Middlebrook's tile
mural, like Stanley Wilson's ceramic medallions on the floor
depicting African motifs of serpents and turtles, were commissioned
by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Many Historical Works a Few Politically Charged</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary murals are usually commissioned by various government
and local agencies or sponsored by art collectives. These are walls
that talk more of the proud history of African ancestors than of
brandished guns and police sirens; they praise the wisdom of books
and libraries over the strength of street knowledge and seek to plant
respect for community heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Notable exceptions include politically charged works like Noni
Olabisi's "Freedom Won't Wait" (1992), an emotional statement that
went up at the corner of 54th Street and Western Avenue in the wake
of the 1992 riots after the acquittal of police officers in the
Rodney King beating trial. "That kind of angry social commentary
isn't as popular now as it was in the 1970s," said Dunitz.</TE>
<TE>   A second mural tour scheduled later in the month will include
"Freedom" and Olabisi's "To Protect and Serve" (1996), a richly
detailed history of the Black Panther Party.</TE>
<TE>   The murals also reflect the will of black artists to write their
own version of history on the walls--one that has at its center the
figures of local leaders, poets and musicians. "In the early days,
murals promoted ethnic pride at a time when African American artists
couldn't show their work in art galleries," said Dunitz. "The
neighborhood walls became their gallery."</TE>
<TE>   To narrate the story behind the stories on the walls, Dunitz
enlisted the help of Cecil Fergerson, a retired curator and a legend
of sorts in the black arts community. Fergerson began his career as a
janitor at the now-defunct Museum of Science History and Art, and
rose to become a curatorial assistant at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art. An early advocate of black artists, he spent the 1970s
devising ways to exhibit works shunned by museums, turning to
churches, schools and even tennis courts.</TE>
<TE>   Fostering Awareness of Community Heroes</TE>
<TE>   A young Fergerson protege named Richard Wyatt paid tribute to him
in a 1989 mural painted on the south side of the Watts Towers Art
Center. In it, the benevolent gaze of a larger-than-life Fergerson
surveys a sun-bleached strip of sidewalk framed by a lone palm tree.</TE>
<TE>   "You have people that have done things for the community, and you
want to make that known," said veteran muralist Elliott Pinkney,
responsible himself for more than 40 murals around the city. "You put
up their images so people start asking, 'Who's that person?' and you
get a community dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   Pinkney, who has been known to put a brush in the hands of passing
teenagers and ask them to help with the painting, will have his own
"Ceremony for Smokers" (1991) included in the tour. Sponsored by a
statewide Tobacco Education Campaign, "Ceremony" is intended to
convey the ills of smoking to black youths; it portrays men and women
crawling out of a bluish smoke abyss under the glacial stare of a
bony socket.</TE>
<TE>   The proof that Watts and Compton residents have found vital
connections with the mural art in their neighborhoods is that most
paintings, even the decades-old ones, remain graffiti-free. The
current exhibition and tours will give nonresidents a chance to forge
personal connections with an often invisible part of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Added Fergerson, "It's necessary that people who come to L.A. go
west of La Brea Avenue and learn about the history of Los Angeles in
reference to black people."</TE>

suitably beautiful, two-disc set from Criterion ($40).</LD>
<LD>   Directed by Marcel Carne and written by his frequent screen
collaborator, the poet Jacques Prevert, "Children of Paradise" is a
poetic, haunting and oh-so-romantic epic drama set in Paris of the
1820s and '30s. Arletty plays the beautiful and worldly Garance, who
is loved by four vastly different men: the sensitive mime Baptiste
(the memorable Jean-Louis Barrault), the self-confident actor
Frederick LeMaitre (Pierre Brasseur), the vile Lacenaire (Marcel
Herrand) and the rich, powerful and possessive Edouard (Louis
Salpou).</LD>
<LD>   Watching this collector's edition of "Children" is a cineaste's
paradise, thanks to a beautiful digital transfer and restored sound.
The film went through a major restoration in 1991 for the laser disc;
then for the DVD, Criterion made an additional 30,000 digital
corrections to remove dirt and other flaws. Though in some instances
"Children" shows the ravages of time, this version is likely the most
pristine available since the film's release in 1945 (1947 in the
U.S.).</LD>
<TE>   Disc 1 includes an astute introduction by director Terry Gilliam,
who describes the film as a perfect melding of poetry and big-budget
filmmaking. Film scholar Brian Stonehill provides the commentary for
the first part of the film, titled "The Boulevard of Crime,"
discussing details of the production. "Children of Paradise" was the
most expensive French production of its time; its $1-million budget
is particularly remarkable given that it was made during the German
occupation. The film's composer, Joseph Kosma, and production
designer, Alexandre Trauner, both Jewish, had to do their work in
hiding. The disc also shows a demonstration of the restoration.</TE>
<TE>   Disc 2 includes the second part of the film; "The Man in White,"
Prevert's original film treatment; Trauner's production designs; a
production stills gallery; the original U.S. theatrical trailer; and
informative commentary by film scholar Charles Affron.</TE>
<TE>   Kino on Video also is in a French state of mind, offering on video
($25 each) four splendid films from the great French director Jean
Renoir, including "La Chienne" from 1931. Renoir's first sound film,
it's a remarkably adept, dark, ironic comedy starring the legendary
Michel Simon as a henpecked cashier and aspiring painter who sets up
a beautiful but selfish young woman (Janie Mareze) as his mistress
after he rescues her from a beating by her pimp (Georges Flammand).
Fritz Lang remade the film in America 14 years later as "Scarlet
Street." The video also features Renoir's 1936 short film "A Day in
the Country," based on the 19th century story by Guy de Maupassant.</TE>
<TE>   The Renoir collection also includes the brilliant 1935 "The Crime
of Monsieur Lange," penned by Prevert, and Renoir's last film, 1969's
"The Little Theater of Jean Renoir."</TE>
<TE>   For fans of more contemporary French film, Anchor Bay has released
the digital editions ($20 each) of two acclaimed comedies from
director Bertrand Blier starring Gerard Depardieu and Patrick
Dewaere: "Going Places" and the Oscar-winning "Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1978 "Handkerchiefs," Depardieu plays the well-meaning
spouse of a depressed woman (Carole Laure) who can't get pregnant.
Determined to make her happy, Depardieu talks a man (Dewaere) he
meets at a restaurant into being her lover. But the only man who
lifts her spirits and gets her pregnant ends up being a 13-year-old
boy.</TE>
<TE>   In "Going Places," from 1974, the two play drifters who roam
France committing crimes and having sex. The film is far from
politically correct, but Depardieu and Dewaere are perfect together.</TE>
<TE>   The films are featured in wide screen and include the trailer.
However, the subtitle tracks on both discs are a bear to negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson, Steve Buscemi and Brad Renfro
star in the insightful teen comedy-drama "Ghost World," based on the
comic book by Daniel Clowes. Birch and Johansson play two high school
friends--social misfits--who drift apart after graduation. Buscemi
plays a music-obsessed middle-aged man who is befriended by Birch's
Enid.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD (MGM, $27) includes a wide-screen version of the film,
deleted and alternate scenes, the trailer and a passable "making-of"
featurette, but would have been improved by commentary from director
Terry Zwigoff.</TE>
<TE>   Deadheads will groove to the 2001 documentary "Grateful Dawg,"
which arrived this week on DVD (Columbia TriStar, $25). Directed by
Gillian Grisman, the film chronicles Grateful Dead guru Jerry
Garcia's friendship and partnership with mandolinist David Grisman
(the director's father). They called their music--a fusion of jazz
and bluegrass--Grateful Dawg. The documentary, made of Gillian
Grisman's home movies, includes several of their live performances,
rehearsals and interviews.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD features production notes, trailers, bonus performances
including "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen," the unreleased music video
of "The Thrill Is Gone" and nifty commentary by both David Grisman
and his director daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years after she made her Osar-winning film debut as Fanny
Brice in "Funny Girl," Barbra Streisand reprised the role in the
disappointing sequel, "Funny Lady." Directed by Herbert Ross, "Funny
Lady" chronicles Brice's tumultuous marriage to composer Billy Rose
(James Caan). The DVD (Columbia TriStar, $25) features a lovely
wide-screen transfer of the film and song highlights.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Zeta-Jones came to fame on British TV 11 years ago in
the popular series "The Darling Buds of May," based on the stories by
H.E. Bates. Zeta-Jones played Mariette, the oldest daughter of the
devil-may-care Larkin clan, who is married to the sweet but stuffy
Charlie (Philip Franks). BFS is releasing several episodes of the
light, enjoyable series on DVD ($20 each).</TE>

<LD>Firefly is glowing red-hot. Jeffrey Best's plush new restaurant on
Ventura Boulevard in Studio City has Hollywood hipsters doing the
unfathomable: winding through Laurel Canyon to spend their evenings
in the Valley.</LD>
<LD>   On the invitation of the Viper Room's Sal Jenco, I checked out
Firefly last Friday and particularly enjoyed its fried olives. The
company was so good I ran too late to catch Bluebird at the
Troubadour, but managed to make it to the Knitting Factory in time to
hear Bruce Duff spin some muy excelente punk rock.</LD>
<LD>   Naturally, I requested Bad Religion before being trounced by some
circus freaks on my way into the main performance area for
Guttermouth's set. In the words of the band OMD, how bizarre, how
bizarre. Sure glad I wasn't part of the cleanup crew after that show.
Someone blew chunks on a computer keyboard in the club's corridor.
Dude, that's so punk....</LD>
<TE>   Speaking of punk, score one for the neighbors in the long-running
feud between WeHo's 7969 club and members of the local community. As
of deadline, the club will be shut down for a minimum of 30 days for
minor code violations. For now, Tuesday night's Michelle's Triple X
Revue has relocated to Arena, while Tiger Heat's now at the Hollywood
Athletic Club on Thursdays. We'll keep you posted.</TE>
<TE>   A word to indie label Side-1 Dummy: If you send me an advance copy
of the new Flogging Molly album (due out Mar. 19), nobody gets hurt.
Seriously, I heard the new album, "Drunken Lullabies," and it's
sooooo good.... I hear that the Well in Hollywood is becoming a new
favorite watering hole for the rocker set. That fine young Foo
Fighter Dave Grohl hung out at the Well Friday night and on Saturday,
Twiggy Ramirez, Jack Black and the Strokes chilled out there....
Monday it was the "Attack of the Killer Cuties" at the Viper Room as
Mark McGrath, Stephen Dorff, Heather Graham and Elijah Wood rocked
the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and the Viper Room's got a new happy hour: It's Thursdays,
between midnight and 2 a.m. Coyote Shivers is deejaying. Tonight's
weather forecast: Mayhem.... Snacked on a "lobster martini" at the
Key Club. It's mashed potatoes with rock lobster sauce served in a
glass. Yum yum.... Bar Marmont was a jumpin' Sunday scene, leaving
everyone feeling loosey goosey. It sure is a swell place.... Speaking
of swell places, I'm off to Tangier to hear Mellowdrone. Meow.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lochness Monster met its match in Art Jong. The Lochness, a
beer-soaked dive in Pasadena now known as the Old Towne Pub, had been
through four owners in two decades. Jong, a streetwise tough who grew
up in South-Central L.A., was eager to find a way out of his family's
business.</LD>
<LD>   He placed his bet on the bar.</LD>
<LD>   The son of Chinese immigrants, Jong gained his entire work
experience at his parents' grocery store in one of L.A.'s rougher
neighborhoods. He packed a pistol before he was old enough to drive,
graduated from Cal State L.A. and socked away money. In 1990, he sank
his life savings into this watering hole off an alley in Pasadena.</LD>
<TE>   Jong proved to be the right guy for this good-time hole in the
wall. He's built a scene that's become a favorite hangout for
Pasadena locals and musicians from the San Gabriel Valley. Although
he knew nothing about the bar biz, he says he knew a lot about hard
work.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the biggest gamble of my life," he says. "But I looked at
it like a business opportunity. I just prayed I wouldn't lose
everything."</TE>
<TE>   The early days were so tight Jong couldn't afford to pay $3 to
park each night. In between checking IDs and serving beers, he moved
his car three or four times a night to avoid parking tickets. There
was plenty of street parking back then in Old Town Pasadena, which
was just starting its metamorphosis from low-rent district to upscale
destination.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the pub--tucked out of sight in an alley off Fair Oaks
Avenue--is smack in the middle of a trendy pedestrian district. But
inside, nothing feels trendy about it. The 100-year-old building,
made of red brick from floor to ceiling, used to be a horse stable
for the Pasadena Fire Department. (Talk about back in the day.)</TE>
<TE>   If you go to the pub today, you might mistake Jong for the
bouncer. He's a burly guy, usually found at the door collecting the
cover fees to pay the band. Although he matches the pub's roughhewn
style, he's got an easy attitude and everyone seems to know him.</TE>
<TE>   The Old Towne Pub serves only beer, but it's got about 40
varieties behind the bar. A wide variety of local rock acts keeps the
joint jumping. Among the bands that put the pub on the map are Snotty
Scotty and the Hankies, the first band to play the pub back in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   When the band Cid is on the calendar, arrive early. The all-star
dream team, featuring John Vatos and John Avila from Oingo Boingo,
attracts a sell-out crowd. Even Diamond Dave wanted in on the action,
showing up unannounced one night to play for an entire hour.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesdays, the rockabilly band Ramblin' James and the Billy
Boppers, featuring players from Big Sandy and the Fly-Rite Boys,
keeps toes tapping. Although the venue is small, with an indoor
capacity of fewer than 100, guests can also hang out on the patio and
still hear the band.</TE>
<TE>   In a neighborhood that increasingly overflows with retail and
restaurant chains, the Old Towne Pub retains the independent,
art-damaged flavor of pre-gentrification Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   And Jong still runs it like a one-man show. He mans the door most
nights. He's the guy stocking the beer, answering the phones and
booking the bands. But while he's doing that, he's also formulating
his next big bet on a bar.</TE>
<TE>   Next time, he says, it's going to be on a tropical resort island.</TE>
<TE>   Old Towne Pub, 66 N. Fair Oaks Ave., Pasadena. 21 and older, cover
varies (usually $3-$5). (626) 577-6583.</TE>

<LD>Talk about your northern Indian food--Village Tandoor is the
northernmost Indian restaurant within L.A.'s city limits. It's also
the northernmost place in the Valley where you can order goat in any
form but birria, although the menu feebly veils its goat identity as
"mutton."</LD>
<LD>   The place is off in an obscure corner of a big Northridge shopping
plaza, physically elevated a few feet above the parking lot. And
elevated in tone as well--the walls feature quiet Indian genre
paintings of sari-clad women serenely performing the immemorial
household tasks of spinning and churning.</LD>
<LD>   I must confess that what drew me there was the lure of goat curry,
but Village Tandoor turns out to be much more than some sort of goat
house. It's a substantial north Indian restaurant with a long menu of
lamb, chicken, seafood and vegetarian dishes, not to mention all the
usual tandoori specialties. It has all the trappings too, including a
Sunday champagne lunch buffet.</LD>
<TE>   You can start a meal with an appetizer, if you like--the potato
pakoras are fried particularly crisp in their garbanzo flour
breading. But you're better off getting one of the set dinners, which
include a range of side dishes. With a lamb dish, for instance, you
get a bland bean-based mulligatawny soup, a sweet, earthy, buttery
dal of tiny moth (teppary beans), vegetable biryani (pilaf mixed with
carrot and zucchini shreds), saag paneer (spinach with cheese) and a
choice of green salad or raita (mostly yogurt with only a bit of
cucumber in it).</TE>
<TE>   The tandoori dishes are perfectly cooked, with the tandoori
chicken coming out smokier than you might expect. The other dishes
are definitely worth checking out, though. They represent the sort of
north Indian food in which the sauces are rich and aromatic but all
the spice notes sort of cancel one another out in a grand, impressive
spice diapason. The sauces are all really delicious, doubtless
because of a free hand with butter.</TE>
<TE>   Particular sauces give a different impression with different
meats; for instance, the masala sauce on lamb seems to have a more
noticeable tomato flavor than the one with chicken. The waiter
insists the reason is not different ingredients but differences in
cooking. Unlike many a north Indian restaurant, Village Tandoor will
make your food spicy if you assure the waiter you're serious.</TE>
<TE>   The perfect example of this style of cooking at its best is
chicken tikka masala. It's remarkably tender pieces of tandoori
chicken swimming in a luscious, buttery sauce, mildly sweet, with a
little tomato.</TE>
<TE>   In the lamb curry, you can detect paprika and plenty of coriander.
The basic impression the sauce gives, though, is of a rich, savory
onion mush. The meaty sauce on the lamb bhuna has sliced onions and
green peppers in it, and probably some tomato sauce as well.</TE>
<TE>   Karhai chicken has some tomato in the sauce, and possibly
cardamom.</TE>
<TE>   The most distinctive sauce is on the navratan curry--potatoes,
carrots and cauliflower in a rich, sweetish coconut sauce.</TE>
<TE>   The seafood section is shrimp with half a dozen of the usual
sauces, except that you can also get fish (usually salmon) with the
masala sauce, which in this case has a light red color and a brighter
flavor.</TE>
<TE>   As for the goat, it has the gamy flavor goat-fanciers love, though
sometimes there's a rather high quotient of bones in a serving. It's
very good in a lively tomato-based masala sauce. On the other hand,
mutton pudhina, though it has an intriguing sound--goat in mint
sauce--strikes me as an evasive, mistaken idea, like chewing mint
leaves in the vain hope of covering up bad breath; you'd be better
off without them.</TE>
<TE>   Any rice dish is bound to be good here, particularly the pilaf
with raisins and whole cardamom pods, and so are the breads, such as
onion kulcha, which has a nice crunchy texture. The usual Indian
desserts are on hand--gulab jamun, mango or pistachio ice cream, a
rich rice pudding.</TE>
<TE>   Goat meat is where you find it. Up here in the north Valley, you
can find it with champagne.</TE>

<HD>Scampering Into Town</HD>
<DH>An adaptation of 'Lilly and the Purple Plastic Purse' isn't
literal--and that seems fine by kids who embrace a whimsical world of
talking mice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE GORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The performer playing the role of Lilly the white mouse had just
walked onstage when a voice rang out from the audience. "Oh, wow,"
the little girl blurted. "Lilly is black!"</LD>
<LD>   African American actress Silinea Hilliard hears candid outbursts
like that frequently during performances of "Lilly and the Purple
Plastic Purse." But she draws her audiences so deeply into her
whimsical world of talking mice that they embrace her in the role and
even shower "Lilly" with gifts after the show.</LD>
<LD>   It's proof, the producers say, that adapting a children's book for
the stage has nothing to do with literal interpretation. It's about
capturing the spirit of a story--its morals, its whimsy--and making
it breathe for an audience.</LD>
<TE>   "What's most important is seeing the humanity in these
characters," director Elizabeth Pringle said. "It's about viewing
humanity through the lens of a story." The touring play, produced by
the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington,
D.C., is headed for a series of regional performances, including two
at Pepperdine University's Smothers Theatre on Saturday. Part of
Pepperdine's Center for the Arts' annual Family Fun Series, both
morning and afternoon performances are nearly sold out, university
organizers say.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that 'Lilly' was a slam dunk because everybody knows this
book," said Marnie Duke Mitze, managing director of the Center for
the Arts. "It is in every kindergarten classroom." Beyond the book's
fame, producers attribute much of the adaptation's success to
playwright Kevin Kling, who first adapted "Lilly" for the Seattle
Children's Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   But it takes more than a good book and a sharp playwright to bring
a simple tale and a handful of illustrations to life. One of the more
obvious challenges is putting human actors into the roles of talking
mice who are supposed to be kindergartners.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly wears red cowboy boots and sunglasses, an easy get-up for a
costume designer. But then comes the thornier issue of making the
actors look like mice without resorting to the big-headed, awkward
helmets popularized by Disneyland or Fill-in-the-Blank on Ice. "We
don't put big heads on top of them like you would see in the theme
park, because then you don't have the actors' faces, and you need the
presence of the actor to make a play work," said Kim Peter Kovac,
senior director for youth and family programs at the Kennedy Center.
"So instead, the ears are made out of speaker wire, and you just kind
of see an outline."</TE>
<TE>   For the kids, that's plenty.</TE>
<TE>   The play is adapted from three books by Kevin Henkes: "Lilly's
Purple Plastic Purse," "Julius, the Baby of the World" and "Chester's
Way." All are about talking mice, especially Lilly, a new elementary
school student who loves everything about her classroom.</TE>
<TE>   She's so crazy about school that on her first day, she abandons
dreams of becoming an ambulance driver or opera singer and declares
that she wants to be a teacher. But when her purse causes such a
distraction that her teacher, Mr. Slinger, confiscates it for the
day, Lilly must learn new lessons about sharing and forgiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "The story is something that is very realistic for a child 5 or 6
years old, when they first get something precious to them, and they
are so excited," said Mitze, who discovered the book through her son,
now 7. The play, like others in the Pepperdine kids' series, also is
an easy sell because young children aren't yet deeply involved in
youth sports or other extracurricular activities, although organizers
say they see the occasional ticket holder in soccer gear.</TE>
<TE>   The folks at the Kennedy Center also have witnessed crowds of what
they call "kid groupies," some of whom arrive seeking autographs or
photos with the cast. Other kids come carrying purple plastic purses.</TE>
<TE>   Children who miss the show at Pepperdine will have other chances
to see it: It also stops at the Irvine Barclay Theatre in Irvine, the
Kavli Theatre in Thousand Oaks, the James Armstrong Theater at the
Torrance Cultural Arts Center and the Haugh Performing Arts Center in
Glendora.</TE>

<LD>   Patti Teel's The Inside-Out Sleep Game. Buena Vista Records. CD:
$13. Ages 3-7. www.amazon.com</LD>
<LD>   If nightmares, fear of the dark or just plain restlessness make
bedtime a battle, help has arrived. Patti Teel, a special-education
and music teacher, has come up with a soothing mix of yoga exercises,
guided imagery, storytelling, and sweet, soft music and vocals to
ease youngsters to sleep.</LD>
<TE>   Beginning with a progressive relaxation exercise, Teel reinforces
positive thinking with a "count your blessings" theme, asking
children to imagine such simple pleasures as rainbows, butterflies,
the smell of "green air after it rains" and the "grass between your
toes."</TE>
<TE>   If that doesn't do the trick, Teel's image-packed visualization
routine should, as she sends listeners on a gentle, magical adventure
down a mountain path, with a "Dream Friend"--a turtle named Nomi. The
video-enhanced CD also includes tips for parents for peaceful nights.</TE>
<TE>   Teel's first hit bedtime soother, "The Floppy Sleep Game," also is
newly available on the Buena Vista Records label.</TE>

<LD>Here are a few places that add a little something extra to the usual
comfort-food mashed potatoes.</LD>
<LD>   2087 An American Bistro: Eclectic chef Alex Molina flavors mashed
Yukon Gold potatoes with toasted sesame seeds and dried bonito and
seaweed, giving a smoky, bacon-like flavor, or with boiled fennel
bulb puree and fennel leaves for a nice licorice bite. (Side of
potatoes, $6.) 2087 An America Bistro, 2087 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd.,
Thousand Oaks, (805) 374-2087.</LD>
<LD>   Cafe Zoolu: Chef-owner Michael Leech throws lots of butter and
heavy cream into boiled Russets, then folds in either horseradish,
wasabi or boiled garlic. They're mashed by hand until fluffy. He also
makes a lovely mashed potato pancake topped with smoked salmon and
caviar. (Side of mashed potatoes, $5; mashed potato pancake, $12.)
Cafe Zoolu, 860 Glenneyre St., Laguna Beach, (949) 494-6825.</LD>
<TE>   Cafe Pierre: These creamy, chunky mashed potatoes come with a
subtle fennel flavoring or a sweet and spicy mixture of carrot and
dried chipotle chiles. If it's too hard to choose, get both--you
can't beat the price. (Side of mashed potatoes, $2.) Cafe Pierre, 317
Manhattan Beach Blvd., Manhattan Beach, (310) 545-5252.</TE>
<TE>   The Farm of Beverly Hills: What could be better than creamy mashed
potatoes with ribbons of melted Gorgonzola and lots of butter? The
sharp, gooey cheese works beautifully with the smooth, airy potatoes.
(Blue cheese mashed potatoes, $2.50.) The Farm of Beverly Hills, 439
N. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills, (310) 273-5578.</TE>
<TE>   The Sunset Room: Chef Andrew Pastore flavors mashed Yukon Gold
potatoes with cream, European butter--and wasabi. He also makes a
similar rustic potato mash, replacing the Yukon Golds with red-skin
potatoes and the wasabi with horseradish and tangy caper berries.
(Mashed potatoes, $6.) The Sunset Room, 1430 N. Cahuenga Blvd.,
Hollywood, (323) 463-0004.</TE>
<TE>   Campanile: These fluffy mashed potatoes are made from boiled
Russets and garlic, passed through a sieve. Then butter and
boiled-down cream are added until the mashed potatoes are silky
smooth. Just before they're served, a dollop of creme fraiche spiked
with shallots is placed on top. (Mashed potatoes with shallot creme
fraiche, $7.) Campanile, 624 S. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles, (323)
938-1447.</TE>

<LD>   Whoopi's Stolen Oscar Retrieved From Trash</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   After the recovery of her best supporting actress statuette for
"Ghost," Oscar host Whoopi Goldberg swears that it will never leave
her house again.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble began when Goldberg sent the piece to the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for cleaning and replating. The
academy packed it in a box and shipped it by UPS Friday to the
manufacturer, R.S. Owens, in Chicago. The box was empty when it
arrived four days later.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg's spokesman, Brad Cafarelli, said that someone apparently
opened the box, removed the Oscar and resealed the package.</TE>
<TE>   A security guard at Ontario International Airport, 35 miles east
of L.A., found the Oscar in a trash bin on Tuesday. A UPS spokeswoman
said that the company sent the statuette to the academy and that an
investigation is underway.</TE>
<TE>   Oscars are hard to sell because they're numbered, noted academy
spokesman John Pavlik. And this one was inscribed with Goldberg's
name.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg was both relieved and annoyed at UPS. "Is this any way to
run a business?" she asked. "It's appalling that something like this
could happen."</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   NBC's Peacock Stripped of Red, White and Blue</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NBC is planning to remove the red, white and blue from its on-air
peacock logo, colors introduced after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The logo, which accompanies virtually all network programming,
will go back to its translucent form on Friday, just before NBC
begins its coverage of the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Variety reports that network executives didn't want to broadcast
such an obvious pro-USA symbol during an international event aimed at
promoting global unity. During past Olympics, NBC and other networks
have been accused of hyping American athletes at the expense of those
from other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Convict Benefits From 'Frontline' Coverage</TE>
<TE>   Media attention generated by a PBS "Frontline" documentary has
been credited with helping to release a man imprisoned for a crime he
insists he didn't commit.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a month after the Jan. 10 program, Terence Garner walked
out of North Carolina's Johnson County Courthouse on Tuesday after
the state granted his motion for a new trial. No date has been set.</TE>
<TE>   The 21-year-old had been sentenced to spend 34 to 43 years in
prison for the 1997 armed robbery of the Quality Finance Co., in
which one employee was shot. "An Ordinary Crime," which presented
strong evidence of Garner's innocence, prompted thousands of viewers
to write letters in support of his release, and a grass-roots
campaign, known as the Terence Garner Justice Coalition, was formed
to lobby for him.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robin Williams will present Barry Levinson ("Bandits") with the
Filmmaker of the Year Award at the American Cinema Editors' 52nd
annual awards show to be held on Feb. 24.... In a ruling that
overturns an earlier conviction, a judge in Newport, R.I., has found
original "Survivor" winner Richard Hatch not guilty of assaulting his
ex-boyfriend.... Singer and actress Brandy, 23, revealed Tuesday that
she wed music producer Robert Smith last summer.... Warner Home Video
has set May 28 as the release date for videos and DVDs of "Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."</TE>

<HD>Takacs Quartet, Pianist Maxim Philippov: Seamless
Collaboration</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Takacs Quartet played a joyous, standard-setting program Tuesday
at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. Violinists Edwin Dusinberre and Karoly
Schranz, violist Roger Tapping and cellist Andras Fejer brought
extraordinary vitality and ensemble to Beethoven's Quartet in B flat
("La Malinconia") and Ravel's Quartet in F. They were then joined by
pianist Maxim Philippov, one of two silver medalists in last year's
11th Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, for a richly
satisfying performance of Schumann's Piano Quintet in E flat, the
same work heard in Irvine less than two weeks ago as the basis for
choreographer Mark Morris' new dance "V."</LD>
<LD>   Now all four Cliburn winners have played in Orange County: Gold
medalists Olga Kern and Stanislav Ioudenitch and co-silver medalist
Antonio Pompa-Baldi appeared with the Pacific Symphony last summer.
But Philippov arrived with something special. The Takacs had served
in the chamber music portion of the competition.</LD>
<LD>   The collaboration here was seamless and deep, and gave evidence of
why Philippov also won an award  for the best performance of chamber
music in Fort Worth.</LD>
<TE>   The quartet also put its signature on the other two works.
Beethoven's "La Malinconia" (Melancholy) startled as it moved from
high-spirited give and take to the unspeakable tragedy that initiates
the last movement. Ravel's Quartet emerged as airy and open, often
gossamer but just as often full of brightness and virile energy.</TE>

<LD>Valentine Diversity: Here are a couple of unusual options for Cupid's
Day.</LD>
<LD>   Not too long ago, David Chaparro and Neela Paniz, owners of Bombay
Cafe, tasted Moet &amp; Chandon's Brut Rose champagne with their sev puri
(an Indian appetizer of rice crackers topped with potato, onions and
chutneys). They liked the combination so much that they built a
Valentine meal around it. This will be Bombay Cafe's first foray into
the American holiday. It begins with the sev puri/champagne
combination, then moves to uttapam with shrimp. For the main course,
you can choose tandoori Cornish hen, green chutney cauliflower and
potatoes or asparagus with green chile. The meal is rounded out with
tomato dal, basmati rice, eggplant raita, naan bread and kheer (rice
pudding) with strawberries for dessert. It runs $35; a vegetarian
version is $30. The Valentine dinner will be available on Feb. 14, 15
and 16.</LD>
<LD>   * Bombay Cafe, 12021 W. Pico Blvd., West L.A.; (310) 473-3388.</LD>
<TE>   Tom Kaplan, owner of Hugo's in Studio City, knows a lot about tea,
of which Hugo's stocks over 50 varieties. For Valentine's Day, Kaplan
has designed a five-course menu to be paired with five different
teas. Some of the dish pairings look like this: tea-marinated duck
salad served with Pearls of Jasmine tea; red beet risotto with
Jamaica-ginger tea; roasted porcini mushrooms on polenta with Lover's
tea. The meal costs $44. Dishes (with their appropriate teas) are
also available a la carte.</TE>
<TE>   * Hugo's, 12851 Riverside Drive, Studio City; (818) 761-8985.</TE>

Valentine's dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica's venerable Michael's has a lovely garden patio with
a waterfall. Its special menu for the night is a five-course number,
costing $85 plus tax and tip, featuring choices like hazelnut-crusted
goat cheese on greens, cream of cauliflower soup, roasted lobster,
crispy-skinned duck breast, pan-seared yellowtail, ginger-honey creme
brulee and Meyer lemon sorbet.</TE>
<TE>   * Michael's, 1147 3rd St., Santa Monica; (310) 451-0843.</TE>
<TE>   Vermont is a cozy nest for lovebirds, with a three-course menu for
$48 plus tax and tip. Some of the options include French onion soup,
monkfish with lobster sauce, vegetarian risotto and raspberry mousse
cake.</TE>
<TE>   * Vermont, 1714 Vermont Ave., Los Feliz; (323) 661-6163.</TE>
<TE>   I Love View: Here are a couple of rooms with a view.</TE>
<TE>   Windows Restaurant sits on the 32nd floor of the Transamerica
Center downtown, giving a spectacular view of the city's lights
spread out below. The four-course meal on Valentine's Day begins with
a goat-cheese croquette, followed by prawn satay or duck consomme.
The main is salmon, chicken or stuffed veal loin. Dessert is warm
chocolate cake or fresh berries. The tab is $65 plus tax and tip, and
includes a champagne toast.</TE>
<TE>   * Windows Restaurant, the Transamerica Center, 1150 S. Olive St.,
downtown L.A.; (213) 746-1554.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Prime, on the 35th floor of the Westin Bonaventure downtown,
offers a ride on a glass elevator and views of the city at night. The
meal, available Feb. 14-17, is four courses for $65 plus tax and tip.
Start with seafood on ice for two and move to soup or salad. The main
course can be more seafood or prime steaks (a 14-ounce New York, a
10-ounce filet mignon). Dessert is a chocolate lover's mousse cake.
Reservations must be secured with a $50 nonrefundable deposit.</TE>
<TE>   * L.A. Prime, in the Westin Bonaventure, 404 S. Figueroa St.,
downtown L.A.; (213) 612-4743.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping It at Home: Why go out for a special meal?</TE>
<TE>   Chez Melange will dress up servers in tuxedos and send them to
your home on Valentine morning (between 8 a.m. and noon) to serve you
coffee, orange juice, champagne, scones, chocolate truffles and a
main course of your choosing (such as lobster crepes or eggs
Benedict). The catch is, you have to live within three miles of the
place. The price is $100 for the meal (which feeds two) and the
service.</TE>
<TE>   * Chez Melange, in the Palos Verdes Inn, 1716 Pacific Coast
Highway, Redondo Beach; (310) 540-1222.</TE>
<TE>   Clementine, a bakery and small cafe near Century City, is making
up three take-home meals that can be reheated at home. Each meal
includes two appetizers, a main course and dessert. Dishes might be
beet soup, stuffed mushrooms, watercress and endive salad, seared
beef tenderloin, striped bass or passion fruit souffle. Meals run $32
to $42. Order by Tuesday. They also have small gift bags (around $5
each) of heart-shaped goodies like strawberry scones, shortbread
cookies and brownies.</TE>
<TE>   * Clementine, 1751 Ensley Ave., L.A.; (310) 552-1080.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of heart-shaped foods, the Sisley Italian Kitchen
restaurants all will bake heart-shaped pizzas on Feb. 14. You can eat
these small pies (which serve one person) in the restaurant or take
them home. The 10 varieties cost between $8.15 and $10.95; toppings
range from prosciutto to sweet Italian sausage to artichokes and
grilled eggplant.</TE>
<TE>   * Sisley Italian Kitchen, 15300 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks, (818)

<HD>Latino Museum Opens, for Now</HD>
<DH>Photography*  The struggling downtown facility, shut since
September 2000 and looking for a new site, displays Tony Gleaton's
'Africa's Legacy in Mexico.'</DH>

<AU>CHRIS REYNOLDS</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaders of the Latino Museum of History, Art and Culture say they're
in search of a new home. But in the meantime, the downtown museum on
Friday is opening its first public show in more than a year.</LD>
<LD>   "Tengo Casi 500 Anos: Africa's Legacy in Mexico" is the work of
Los Angeles-based photographer Tony Gleaton. Gleaton has spent more
than 15 years on a project documenting African influences in the
Americas, and the Latino Museum exhibition is to include 45
black-and-white photographs of Latin Americans with African heritage.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning this week, the museum, 112 S. Main St., downtown L.A.,
will open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Fridays and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on
Saturdays and Sundays through March 17. The exhibition is free.</LD>
<TE>   The Latino Museum opened downtown in 1998, but has struggled with
debts and has no paid staff. Though the facility has been the site of
occasional special events, its last public exhibition closed in
September 2000. Museum officials said they've hired temporary
consultants to staff the upcoming exhibition. A spokesman for the
museum said the images have been shown previously as part of a
Smithsonian Institution exhibition that traveled to several U.S.
museums from 1993 to 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's future location remains a question. City officials
have announced plans to buy seven properties on the museum's block,
then trade them to the state so that Caltrans can build an office
there. Construction of the Caltrans office is scheduled to begin in
2003.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, the museum's board president, Juan Gomez-Quinones,
suggested that the museum might try to resist the city and keep its
downtown location. But talks between city and museum officials have
advanced since then, and museum board member Carlos Haro said a move
now appears inevitable. The question, he said, is where.</TE>
<TE>   "There's probably not going to be a permanent site right away, so
we're looking for temporary facilities," said Haro, assistant dean
for international studies at UCLA. In the search for a new site, Haro
said, a downtown location is "a definite must." He said he expects
the museum to move this year, perhaps so soon that a planned photo
exhibition on day laborers, scheduled to open March 28, may take
place at a new location. (For more information on the museum:
www.thelati nomuseum.org.)</TE>
<TE>   "The issue right now is trying to identify alternative locations.
We're working very well together," said Gerry Miller, the city's
assistant chief legislative analyst. The last city-museum meeting was
Jan. 31, Miller said, adding that of seven properties sought by the
city on the museum's block, three have closed escrow, two were in
escrow as of Monday, and two, including the museum, remained in
negotiation.</TE>

<HD>One Man Is a 'Lonely Planet' in the Age of AIDS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maps help make sense of a landscape, but they don't tell the whole
story. They're often skewed for particular perspectives and purposes.</LD>
<LD>   So says Jody, the owner of a map store in Steven Dietz's "Lonely
Planet."</LD>
<LD>   The same could be said of the play itself, in which the story of
Jody and his friend Carl was skewed to reflect the state of possible
responses to AIDS, circa 1992, and to emphasize the importance of
resolutely confronting the plague.</LD>
<TE>   Jody has never been tested for the disease (AIDS is never
mentioned by name). He virtually lives inside his store, never
venturing next door, let alone to any of the exotic places on his
maps. Carl, on the other hand, is almost always in motion. One of his
projects is bringing chairs from the homes of those who have died
into the previously immaculate surroundings of the map store. With
this device, Dietz paid conscious homage to Ionesco's "The Chairs."
Carl also spins amusingly farfetched tales of his many ways of making
a living--but we later learn that he doesn't fabricate these yarns
totally out of the blue.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Hamilton's revival at the L.A. Gay &amp; Lesbian Center's
Davidson/Valentini Theatre has its beguiling moments. Abraham
Higginbotham's Carl has a quicksilver charisma, and Randall Rapstine
generally succeeds in  keeping us watching the stolid Jody.</TE>
<TE>   If the characters ultimately seem to be symbols more than people,
that's a limitation of the script. But there are a few moments in
which the staging seems unnecessarily muted. A few key lines are
thrown away almost inaudibly. And the design doesn't quite live up to
the description of the Act 2 scene in the script--that chairs are
"everywhere," with "only a few, small pathways."</TE>
<TE>   "Lonely Planet," L.A. Gay &amp; Lesbian Center, the Village at Ed
Gould Plaza, 1125 N. McCadden Place, Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 8
p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Feb. 24. $20. (323) 860-7300. Running
time: 1 hour, 50 minutes.</TE>

<HD>'Tron' Showed the Way</HD>
<DH>The movie, just released on DVD for its 20th anniversary,
was a pioneer of computer-generated imagery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES SOLOMON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Future film historians may well describe 2001 as the Year of Computer
Graphics: Two of the top critical and box-office successes were the
computer-animated "Shrek" and "Monsters, Inc." Computer-generated
effects figured prominently in many of the year's other big hits,
including "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," "The Lord of the
Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," "Jurassic Park III" and "The
Mummy Returns."</LD>
<LD>   The use of computer-generated imagery can be traced back to a
pioneering film that premiered 20 years ago this summer: "Tron,"
which Disney has just released on DVD.</LD>
<LD>   Although the film came out on video and laser several times--the
last reissue was a "Special Archive Edition" laser disc in 1995--it's
been unavailable for years and has become a sought-after commodity
among computer enthusiasts, who have elevated the movie to cult
status.</LD>
<TE>   "Tron" and its eagerly awaited DVD release have been the subject
of lively discussions on Slashdot ("News for Nerds") and other
high-tech Web sites; related merchandise, including 20-year-old toy
lightcycles, action figures and trading cards, is selling briskly on
EBay.</TE>
<TE>   But "Tron" remains an oddity: a film that's significant without
being very good.</TE>
<TE>   "Tron" broke new ground with its extensive use of
computer-generated backgrounds and effects. Today, photographing
actors on a bare stage and putting them into a computer-generated
world is standard operating procedure in Hollywood, but in 1982, it
was unprecedented. Elaborate backgrounds that couldn't be built as
sets were done by combining footage of the actors with matte
paintings or location plates.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, computer-generated monsters, from the trolls in "Harry
Potter" and "Lord of the Rings" to the dinosaurs in the "Jurassic
Park" movies, have replaced stop-motion puppets and men in rubber
suits. But the idea that the lightcycles Tron and Flynn ride existed
only on film and in computer memory banks dumbfounded people two
decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Tron" deserved an Oscar for special effects, but it lost to the
more conventional--and more popular--"Poltergeist."</TE>
<TE>   Despite extensive media coverage, "Tron" was not a hit. Although
it boasts an interesting concept, excellent design work and
innovative visuals, the film suffers from a weak story. Video game
designer Flynn (Jeff Bridges) is sucked into the alternate world
within his computer's memory. This world is dominated by the
tyrannical Master Control Program, or MCP (David Warner, with his
voice slowed down) and its hench-program Sark (Warner again), who
send Flynn to the Game Grid, where programs are forced to participate
in life-and-death gladiatorial combats.</TE>
<TE>   On the Grid, he meets the title character (Bruce Boxleitner), a
square, square-jawed hero and his ladylove (Cindy Morgan). The trio
instigates a revolt against Sark and Master Control that leads to the
undoing of their nasty counterparts in the real world.</TE>
<TE>   As a film student and novice writer, I saw sections of the film 20
years ago while working on stories about it for Rolling Stone and
Film Comment. The visuals were so exciting, I naively believed they
would carry any story. When I saw the finished film, I realized even
groundbreaking imagery couldn't make up for wooden dialogue and
one-note characters.</TE>
<TE>   Two decades later, those flaws are still obvious, but many of the
visuals remain exciting. They're simpler than recent
computer-generated effects, but the designs and effective use of the
medium still pack a visual wallop.</TE>
<TE>   "Tron" may have exerted its greatest influence through its crew of
young artists who have gone on to do important work in animation and
special effects: Tim Burton (director of "Planet of the Apes," "Ed
Wood," "Edward Scissorhands"), Roger Allers (co-director of "The Lion
King"), Barry Cook (co-director of "Mulan"), Dennis Edwards (producer
of "Osmosis Jones"), Andy Gaskill (art director of "The Lion King"),
Bill Kroyer (director of "Fern Gully: The Last Rainforest"), Jerry
Rees (director of "The Brave Little Toaster").</TE>
<TE>   John Lasseter, the Oscar-winning director of "Toy Story" films,
has said that as a young Disney animator, he was so excited by the
work his friends were doing on "Tron" that he decided to move into
the new field of computer animation. It's easy to see why, even 20
years later.</TE>

<CX>   Oscar facts--A Feb. 7 Calendar Weekend article about the DVD
release of "Tron" incorrectly reported that the 1982 film had lost the
Academy Award for best visual effects to "Poltergeist." In fact, "Tron"
wasn't even nominated in that category, and the winner that year was
"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial."</CX>

<LD>Midway through his hourlong report on the U.S. pornography business
tonight (9 p.m., KCET), "Frontline" correspondent Peter J. Boyer
declares, "This is the golden age of porn."</LD>
<LD>   By that time, viewers will not be surprised at the observation.
Boyer and producer-director Michael Kirk have presented their case in
compelling and disturbing fashion, reporting not merely that it's a
multibillion-dollar business but also that there are at least 200,000
commercial porn sites on the World Wide Web and that major companies
such as AT&amp;T, General Motors and Hilton Hotels Corp. have become
"corporate collaborators" in distributing sexually explicit videos.</LD>
<LD>   "The mainstream companies help legitimize what we're doing," says
Bill Asher, president of Van Nuys-based Vivid Entertainment Group, an
adult film company.</LD>
<TE>   "Frontline" does an excellent job explaining how this situation
arose, citing the boom in technology, a lack of enforcement of
obscenity laws by the Clinton administration and, not least, public
demand for the product.</TE>
<TE>   The program suggests that the "golden age" could be in for some
tarnishing as that product grows ever more kinky (you get a strong
smattering here of how far it's going), virtually daring law
enforcement to take producers to court to test where the lines of
decency are drawn.</TE>

<HD>From L.A. to Cerritos by Way of the Gobi Desert</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Al Martinez</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The only excuse I can offer is that I had never been to Cerritos
before. Like Kuala Lumpur and Alpha Centauri, Cerritos was just
someplace out there that I never had an occasion to visit. Then came
Sunday and Arlo Guthrie.</LD>
<LD>   I am a folk-singer junkie and have been ever since Pete Seeger
gave Joe McCarthy the finger sometime in the 1950s. So when I heard
that Guthrie was going to appear at the Cerritos Center for the
Performing Arts, I began saving up.</LD>
<LD>   Arlo, his daddy, Woody, and Seeger used to hang out in Topanga,
not far from where I live, drinking beer and smoking them funny
cigarettes and plunkin' away on their $12 guitars. They sang about
peace and justice and existed on ham sandwiches.</LD>
<TE>   Times have changed a little. Just to get in to hear Arlo do his
thing cost $50 a ticket, but it was worth it to be inside a building
that makes the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion look like a warehouse and to
hear Guthrie sing. It was like being at a hootenanny in Carnegie
Hall.</TE>
<TE>   But first you had to get there.</TE>
<TE>   I mentioned that I had never been to Cerritos before, but since my
memory can get pretty fuzzy sometimes, maybe I had. Since Cerritos
isn't exactly Paris or Rome, a person can be there and not even
realize it.</TE>
<TE>   Anyhow, just before we were to set out, my wife, Cinelli, said,
"Make sure you know where we're going."</TE>
<TE>   That was a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   To rely on me to get us anywhere is like asking Mike Tyson to
explain Euclidean geometry. Cinelli should have recalled how I
figured out how to drive from Ojai to L.A. by going north. I had
somehow decided that east was the opposite of north and 150 miles
later, we were still 50 miles from home, wandering through the Santa
Ynez Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Anyhow, I got out the old map book and spotted Cerritos. So far,
so good. I figured out that by taking the 91 Freeway off the 405,
we'd get right to where we wanted to go. Simple. But then I somehow
came up with the idea that the 91 was just below Costa Mesa. Wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Don't ask me how this happened. I don't know. The performance was
at 8 o'clock, but we left the house at 4 because Cinelli knows I like
to get to places early. I have no problem with the need to arrive at
an airport three hours early to deal with increased security because
I'm usually there five hours early anyhow.</TE>
<TE>   So we get on the 405, and we're muddling through traffic wondering
why it's so painfully slow and listening to KFWB on the radio telling
us only that it's painfully slow. I already knew that.</TE>
<TE>   "If you would just relax," Cinelli said, "you'd live longer."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm never relaxed," I said, "and I've lived this long, so stress
and tension must be good for me."</TE>
<TE>   "You really are a nut," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Because I figured the 91 was by Costa Mesa, somewhere near the
Orange County line, we didn't look at signs until we got down to the
cutoff for Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   When we passed the John Wayne Airport without seeing 91, Cinelli
began getting a funny look on her face.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought you said 91 was near Costa Mesa."</TE>
<TE>   "I said somewhere near Costa Mesa." Pause. "But then, maybe not."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, my God, you've done it again. We're lost! Stop the car!"</TE>
<TE>   She got out the map book herself, which is what she should have
done in the first place after the Ojai adventure.</TE>
<TE>   I had told her years ago how--for reasons I can't recall--the
Marine Corps decided I'd make a good map reader. It was during the
Korean War, and I got a whole platoon lost by directing it to go east
when I meant north. All those grids confused me.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank Christ you weren't calling in artillery," a lieutenant
said, grabbing the map book from me. "We'd all be dead!"</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety-one is way back there!" Cinelli said, not quite believing
it. "We're a hundred miles off course! Why do I listen to you?"</TE>
<TE>   She tends to exaggerate things like that. We were maybe 50 miles
off course.</TE>
<TE>   "What do we do now?" I said helplessly. I'm good at being
helpless.</TE>
<TE>   I had meant Torrance, not Costa Mesa. I've been to both those
places and should have known the difference, but somehow they sounded
alike, I guess.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than go all the way back to 91, which is the Artesia
Freeway (I've never been to Artesia, I don't think, but I understand
they have an excellent Burger King there), she had us go off at
Highway 39. I'd tell you where that is, but I honest to God don't
know.</TE>
<TE>   What I do know is that we went through sections of Cypress and
Anaheim and areas so dark I thought we'd ended up in the Gobi Desert.</TE>
<TE>   I began to offer advice, but Cinelli, who was not in a terrific
mood by then, said, "You open your mouth again, I'm going to have you
gagged and whipped."</TE>
<TE>   To make a long story short, we got to Cerritos about 7 and just
had time enough to eat fast at Mimi's, a nice restaurant near the
Performing Arts Center. Guthrie was worth all the trouble and so was
just being in that fantastic building.</TE>
<TE>   We took the 605 home, via the 91. We had to go north to go west
and then south to go west--if you believed the signs--but I'm a guy
who thinks you go north to get east, or maybe south, so who am I to
question Caltrans? It's just a good thing they weren't calling in
artillery.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been a productive Tuesday afternoon on the set of "Everybody
Loves Raymond," and Peter Boyle is feeling playful as he shows a
visitor around his dressing room.</LD>
<LD>   It's a small place, but warmly lit, with family photos, an
overstuffed leather chair, a heavy wooden desk and a large couch
that's perfect, he says, for napping.</LD>
<LD>   "A sitcom is not the highest level of show biz," he explains,
plopping down in the chair. "But this is pretty nice!" Perhaps a
recent nomination for a Screen Actors Guild award for his work on
"Raymond" has leavened his mood.</LD>
<TE>   Boyle pulls an oversized boxing glove from a bookshelf that serves
as a repository for show-biz odds and ends. "This was in a gift
basket," he says, sliding the glove onto his right hand. "When people
come to visit me, I like to do this .... " With that, Boyle takes a
swing at himself and lands a punch on the chin. A device inside the
glove emits the sound of broken glass. Boyle's face lights up. He
pounds the glove against the wall. More "broken glass." The glove
goes back to the shelf.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine that this is the same Peter Boyle who once
walked out on Terry Gross when the beloved National Public Radio
interviewer asked him about his years as a monk in the 1950s, long
before he became an Emmy-winning actor. Reminded of the Gross
interview, Boyle, who's 68, raises his eyebrows in amazement. He
doesn't remember it. In fact, Gross' name doesn't ring a bell. But he
tries to explain his reaction. "It's hard to talk about it because
it's religion, and religion is such a personal thing," he says.
"There's no way to describe it. Imagine in 1953, you suddenly went
back to 853 AD. It's not an easy story to tell."</TE>
<TE>   A brief pause. Boyle holds an unsettling gaze, then he's back at
the bookshelf. "This is a TV Guide Award," he says, holding a small
gold trophy. What did he win for? "I don't know." A top shelf holds
his award for being named one of the Top 100 Irish Americans</TE>
<TE>   Boyle reaches for another favorite prop. "These are knee pads," he
says, pulling a pair off another shelf. "In show-biz, these come in
handy."</TE>
<TE>   Pop Art and Magic</TE>
<TE>   Art dealer Jonathan Novak, cornered near the martini bar by a
group of women carrying champagne, had just finished explaining why
he was wearing a Campbell Soup can name tag. This was the opening of
his new Century City gallery, so the answer, naturally, had more to
do with art than soup. "Everybody's asking me about [Andy] Warhol,"
he said, between hugs and kisses from clients. Ever since the Museum
of Contemporary Art announced its May retrospective of the artist, he
said, works by Warhol and his peers have practically been selling
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly a woman pointed to a bright painting behind the
bartender. "I need you to put that Hockney on hold," she said. "It's
for a friend. She's very ill, and that would really cheer her up."
Novak smiled and kissed her cheek. "See what I mean?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   He had to move on. Past the Sam Francis. Past Warhol's
"U.S.Weather Map/G.E." Past Dan Douke's "Verdant Section." Past the
dozens of business-suited art enthusiasts who had crowded into the
gallery on a blustery Tuesday evening.He found the evening's
entertainer, magician Howard Posener, doing card tricks with his back
to Fernando Botero's painting "The River." A woman named a card,
Posener shuffled, and suddenly the card appeared. "He did it!" she
shouted. But that wasn't enough. Posener had to show them the trick
that so thrilled a Saudi prince that he gave the magician his
sapphire and titanium watch. With a turn of the hand, Posener
switched the card from one suit to another.</TE>
<TE>   Novak is betting it won't take magic to get people into his new
appointment-only space. On the first floor of a high-rise on Century
Park East, it is decidedly out of the way. But Novak isn't concerned
about visibility. With a solid 20-year reputation and a 6,000-member
mailing list, he figures people will find him.</TE>

<LD>THE SILENT WOMAN</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Susan Dodd</LD>
<TE>   William Morrow</TE>
<TE>   336 pages, $25</TE>
<TE>   After serving as a captain in the most prestigious
Austro-Hungarian cavalry regiment, the Viennese painter Oskar
Kokoschka returned from the Great War as battered in spirit as he was
in body. Drawn to the German town of Dresden for its noted
sanatorium, whose "exceptional costliness attested, he thought, to
its curative powers," Kokoschka settled in, hoping for a speedy
recovery so that he could resume painting. But the world around him
lay shattered.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Silent Woman," critically acclaimed author Susan Dodd
depicts the epidemics, starvation, food rationing and general
suffering that plagued Europe during and after World War I. But in
this historical novel--in which Dodd acknowledges having played "fast
and loose with historical fact"--she focuses on Kokoschka's obsessive
amorous entanglements and their disturbing relationship to his art.</TE>
<TE>   While the first half of the novel gathers its insights and
momentum slowly, collecting too much mundane detail, the novel
eventually builds its brittle psychological portrait into an
unnerving tautness.  Born in 1886, the 30-year-old Kokoschka finds
himself obsessed with Gustav Mahler's widow, Alma, with whom he has
carried on an affair  before and after the composer's death.
Beautiful, sensuous and extraordinarily self-centered, Alma becomes
the passionate center of the painter's vision; indeed, she serves as
the very lens by which he views all that he paints.</TE>
<TE>   When Alma abandons Kokoschka to marry a well-known architect, the
painter feels utterly bereft; barely able to eat or paint, he teeters
on the edge of an  emotional and physical breakdown. Now teaching in
Dresden's art academy while attempting to paint, and lodging with
Hans Posse, the city's sympathetic museum curator, Kokoschka drags
through his misery of days, seeking consolation from his students and
from Hulda, Posse's young and painfully naive housemaid.</TE>
<TE>   Dodd excels at depicting the intricate irrationalities of
obsession, showing Kokoschka spinning strangely and wildly out of
control.</TE>
<TE>   Enlisting the services of Fraulein Moos, a talented doll maker,
the artist commissions a life-size doll modeled after his beloved
Alma. He also convinces Hulda, whom he has renamed Reserl, to help
ready the house for the statue's arrival. She will be Kokoschka's
co-conspirator, preparing meals and arranging Madame Alma's (the
dummy's) gorgeous clothing.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing from Kokoschka's letters, and those from Fraulein Moos,
Dodd renders the painter's bizarre desires and behavior with eerie
realism. But it is Reserl who emerges as the novel's most poignant
character, with her innocent faithfulness and desire to love and be
loved by the grieving artist:</TE>
<TE>   "Reserl lifted one hand from his shoulder and laid it along the
side of his face. Her chapped fingers smelled of onion and garlic.
She wondered if the scent repulsed him, if he noticed the roughness
in her touch. His lips were slightly parted. She covered his mouth

<TE>   "His eyes remained closed.</TE>
<TE>   "She might have been a blanket.</TE>
<TE>   "Reserl twined her arms and legs about his body, lifted her mouth
from his. His breath grieved like a high and distant wind.</TE>
<TE>   "He will never love you. An ache spread out from her center, until
the whole of her being was overtaken. Reserl recognized the cramp.

<TE>   Dodd's descriptions are lush, and her brooding dialogues are full
of interior asides by her central characters. Sometimes the novel's
language  gets bogged down by its own heaviness, but often this
heaviness enhances the stifling psychological atmosphere that makes
the story so dramatically convincing. Art has its costs, the novel
suggests.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his acute self-involvement, Kokoschka has his own
idiosyncratic scruples. He bitterly comments on the slavish rates the
art academy pays  its models, yet he doesn't hesitate to use them.
Even toward Hulda, Kokoschka exhibits a certain protectiveness, at
least initially, hesitant to tamper with the young woman's innocence.</TE>
<TE>   But ultimately, Dodd shows, art remains more urgent and even
necessary for him than real life.</TE>

<HD>A Punch Line and an Exit</HD>
<DH>With its leader's departure, the prank-pulling L.A.
Cacophony Society is at a crossroads.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a sunny weekend afternoon, the members of the Los Angeles
Cacophony Society sit in semi-darkness beneath the old pinatas at a
Highland Park bar called Mr. T's. This is their first meeting of
2002, their first gathering in at least four months. They are here to
pick up the pieces.</LD>
<LD>   Cacophonists are part of a loose network of underground societies,
with "lodges" in about a dozen U.S. cities. For the last decade, the
L.A. group has been one of the most active in the country.</LD>
<LD>   But last spring, Al Ridenour, a.k.a. "Reverend Al," stepped down
from his post as Grand Instigator and Supreme Leader. "I felt that
the original iconoclastic energy had given way to timeworn jokes and
stale excuses for socializing," Ridenour, 40, said recently over a
sandwich at Philippe's French Dip, a favorite cacophonist gathering
spot because of the clown photos that adorn one wall. Clowns are
icons for cacophonists, who aspire to "live life as fools."</LD>
<TE>   In the last 10 years, many of the original members have mellowed
as they reach their 40s. The world has grown more corporate, and the
corporations quickly co-opt underground movements. Furthermore, some
once-thrilling ideas--such as unfurling a "Just Quit" sign at Mile 22
of the marathon and offering tired runners doughnuts, beer,
cigarettes and beef jerky--have become humdrum.</TE>
<TE>   At this meeting, on a Saturday in January, the cacophonists are in
the midst of an existential crisis: Can they carry on without their
leader, or are they aimless, as lost as the Merry Pranksters without
Ken Kesey?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Cacophony Societies are disorganized groups of klowns, guerrilla
artists, kitsch hounds, slackers and noisemakers in search of
experiences beyond the mainstream.... We go wherever there are some
raw materials from which we can make our dada.... You may already be
a member."</TE>
<TE>   --From the Los Angeles Cacophony Society Web site, at
la.cacophony.org.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. cacophonists have staged Laundromat poetry readings, picnics
on earthquake faults and field trips to cryonics companies.</TE>
<TE>   At the L.A. Pet Cemetery in Calabasas they have visited the
markers of luminaries ranging from Tom Mix's horse, Tony, to Blinkey,
the frozen chicken interred by artist Jeffrey Vallance. They have
parodied far-out theories about the Kennedy assassination, holding
what they called "an unprecedented orgy of paranoia and
disinformation." True to their anticonsumerist underpinnings, they
have engaged in reverse shoplifting, planting everything from
"Bobbitt dog chews" to Cement-Cuddlers--teddy bears filled with
cement--in various retail outlets, only to watch as confused cashiers
would struggle to ring up the strange merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   One time a group of the urban pranksters descended on Universal
Studios' squeaky-clean CityWalk Mall sporting tattered garments they
had barbecued in a park the day before. CityWalk should reflect
L.A.'s apocalyptic soul, they reasoned, including its poverty and
grit. Unfortunately, visitors just assumed the cadre of charred
outcasts were human billboards for the "Backdraft" ride.</TE>
<TE>   "We subvert prime-time reality," said cacophonist Robert Moss, 45,
a part-time actor and computer consultant. "When we rent a club and
put on a show, that's fun, too. But the real nut of Cacophony is
going out in public places--where everyone goes and knows what to
expect--and doing pranks."</TE>
<TE>   The history of the Cacophony Society, which exists for the most
part as an oral tradition, is as slippery as a water-logged rat
skittering through a maze of city drainage tunnels--something local
cacophonists have been known to do. The group was founded 15 years
ago in San Francisco. Ridenour discovered Cacophony in 1991 and
decided to import it to L.A. He planned a bogus UFO landing. At a
local convocation of saucerheads, Ridenour passed out fliers
announcing the landing at a beachfront park.</TE>
<TE>   Near the airport, Ridenour, who confesses a fascination with all
things religious, staked out a giant landing pad, constructed a
20-foot foil cross, burned incense and decorated the scene with
religious icons. He donned a clerical collar and called himself Rev.
Al. The curious and crazy came, his nom de guerre stuck, and the Los
Angeles Cacophony Society was born.</TE>
<TE>   You may never have heard of the cacophonists, but you may have
heard of some of the people and events they claim to have inspired.
The list includes novelist Chuck Palahniuk, author of the
anticonsumerist novel "Fight Club," who is said to have frequented
meetings of the Portland Cacophony Society, the San Francisco event
that was the precursor of Burning Man, and Santacon, the folkloric
fatman frolic that originated in San Francisco nine years ago--and
features squads of drunken Santas climbing on buses, going to strip
clubs and engaging in other un-Santa-like behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The cacophonists are part of an avant-garde tradition descended
from Dada, the profoundly influential artistic movement that started
in Zurich and swept Europe and the U.S. in the second and third
decades of the 20th century in reaction to the social upheaval that
followed World War I. Dadaists aimed to provoke. The spirit of Dada
was in events: cabaret performances, demonstrations, declarations,
confrontations, the distribution of leaflets and what we now call
"guerrilla theater."</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like they are in this tradition of cultural resistance,
provocation, epater le bourgeoisie," said sociologist Jeffrey Halley,
a professor at the University of Texas, San Antonio, who focuses on
European and American avant-garde movements.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some of their predecessors, however, cacophonists are not
political. "We are not anarchists. We are not left wing," Moss said.
"We comment on culture."</TE>
<TE>   Most, in fact, are products of the middle-class sensibility
against which they rebel. Many work in obscure jobs on the edges of
the entertainment industry. Cacophonist Eric Harris, a.k.a.
Grammarian, described the group as "those guys in high school in the
A.V. club, kind of nerdy, who bring the 16-millimeter film projector
to class. Misfits."</TE>
<TE>   Sociologists say marginal groups such as the cacophonists often
serve an important social function, bringing attention to what one
academic called "the details of domination" in the culture. That
function, however, can often only be discerned in hindsight.</TE>
<TE>   "They create ideas that are out there, waiting to be discovered,"
said Clarence Lo, a sociology professor at the University of Missouri
who studies social movements. "The more groups like this, the more we
begin to rethink those ... things we take for granted."</TE>
<TE>   Halley agreed: "They are testifying to something about American
society, and that is extremely important. As a reality, as a
critique, as a record."</TE>
<TE>   In its mid-1990s heyday, the Cacophony Society held two to four
events a month. Ridenour estimates he spent 40 hours a week writing
newsletters, distributing fliers and overseeing construction of
elaborate papier mache props. He even transformed rooms of his house
into impromptu theater spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a kind of war against the culture of buying Nikes and
making your kids watch Barney," said Ridenour.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Ridenour found it difficult to carry on his full-time
job as an animator. He burned through his personal savings staging
events. (He now works as a freelance journalist specializing in
offbeat stories and occasionally writes for The Times.)</TE>
<TE>   And the adrenaline rush began to wear off. Take Santacon. Once,
the event was a handful of madmen in Santa suits, running the
streets, risking arrest. Over time it grew into a multiple city
happening--with hundreds of Santas roaming the streets not only
around Los Angeles, but also in Portland, Brooklyn and even London.
"In a weird way, it became traditional," Ridenour said. "It became
too traditional. It became expected. It's like the anti-holiday that
is everyone's holiday favorite."</TE>
<TE>   Sometime around fall of 2000, Ridenour just seemed to lose steam.
The Web postings grew old, the activities petered out. Then, in
perhaps the ultimate cacophonist act, he turned the group's
philosophy upon itself and pranked his fellow cacophonists. "I wanted
it to go down in a fireball," Ridenour said. "I wanted it to end. I
looked at cacophony as a big theatrical extravaganza, so I wanted a
big end to it all."</TE>
<TE>   So, after the final night of the Museum of Mental Decay, the
cacophonists' twisted version of a Halloween haunted house, in
October 2000, Ridenour reported on the group's Web site the grisly
death of a member in a drunk driving accident. (That member had
actually moved to New Orleans.) Professing pain and spiritual
confusion, he faked his own conversion to "Christian anarchy."</TE>
<TE>   Some members fell for the prank; chaos ensued. "I heard him say
more than once he wanted to do a prank that would make the group
self-destruct," said 42-year-old Al Guerrero, a.k.a. Al Pastor, Al
Qaeda or Al Fresco. "We felt it was an aggressive act, an act of
desperation, an act of finality. It was like an internal time bomb."</TE>
<TE>   After that, "Rev. Al" went into retirement.</TE>
<TE>   For months, until the meeting at Mr. T's, the group was in
disarray.</TE>
<TE>   In the bar's gloom, cacophonists lay their calendars on the table,
scribble save-the-date notes and request volunteers. Numbering about
18, they could be PTA members divvying up duties for back-to-school
night.</TE>
<TE>   Out of the shadows wafted whispers of the subversive: How about a
Mexican Night, with fake INS raids and faux day laborers? A field
trip to L. Ron Hubbard's museum, in full nautical regalia? A weekend
caravan of campers to bring paint and encouragement to Leonard
Knight, who lives by the Salton Sea, painting a mountain of stone
with Bible verses?</TE>
<TE>   The freaks and misfits had their energy back. But few of the ideas
were fresh. Most of the proposed events were staged performances, not
the daring Dada to which cacophonists once aspired.</TE>
<TE>   "That's something Rev. Al disliked," said Kim Cooper, Cacophony's
newly appointed public relations person, invoking Ridenour as if he
were Mao, Fidel or God. "The recycling of events."</TE>
<TE>   Excited members called the recent meeting a renaissance.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, though, some members concede Ridenour's concerns are
legitimate. "As you age, you are not as daring," said Guerrero.
"That's just a sign of growing up. There was a time when most of the
events could get you arrested, or you would wind up running away from
the police at the end."</TE>
<TE>   No longer.</TE>
<TE>   At the height of the controversy over the fate of Belmont Learning
Complex, built on an environmentally suspect site downtown, Harris
tried to plan a nighttime trip to the school to see if there really
was toxic waste at the site, and to plant some if there wasn't. "We
were going to break in, look inside the classrooms," Guerrero
recalled. "But in the end it turned out people were just too
nervous."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Austin, a professor in the department of popular culture at
Bowling Green State University, said the cacophonists' plight is not
unusual. "Almost all avant-garde groups have some charismatic leader,
living on the border of a self-destructive life because of what they
are involved in. Usually there are a lot of other people in their
wake, sort of like lieutenants and soldiers. But that immediately
sets up the problem of reproduction. There is no one to take over
after they get tired."</TE>
<TE>   It may be too early to tell, but maybe the society's time has
passed. As Halley, the Texas sociologist, put it: "They are not a
movement, but a moment."</TE>

<HD>A High Calling for Priestesses at Delphi</HD>
<DH>Evidence shows hydrocarbon gases seeping from faults
affected the ancients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GUY GUGLIOTTA</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They warned Oedipus to stay away from his mother, told Orestes to go
ahead and kill his, caused Croesus to lose to the Persians, then
helped Athens defeat them. So what's the story with the priestesses
at Delphi? Did they really channel for Apollo, or were they just high
on something?</LD>
<LD>   Scientists don't know about Apollo, but evidence is growing that
the priestesses, known as Pythia, were ripped on hydrocarbon gases,
especially ethylene, a sometime anesthetic that, taken in modest
doses, can induce lively conversation of a somewhat incoherent
nature.</LD>
<LD>   This is because the Temple of Apollo at Delphi sits on
crisscrossing geological faults, according to a team of scientists
led by archeologists John Hale of the University of Louisville and
geologist Jelle Zeilinga de Boer of Wesleyan University in
Connecticut.</LD>
<TE>   In re-embracing the ancients' view that intoxicants emanated from
water bubbling from a rock fissure beneath the temple, Hale said, the
team is challenging a century of research that held "that the priests
and oracle were deceiving the public and inventing stories" to boost
the shrine's importance.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it appears the ancients were right. "I thought that if
there is an active fault, there were most likely gases coming up
through fissures," Zeilinga de Boer said. And if that were true,
traces would show up in the travertine that underpins the temple.
Travertine is a type of limestone.</TE>
<TE>   And so it proved. Reporting recently in the journal Geology, the
team said that tests on the Delphi rock and the waters of a nearby
spring showed the presence of methane and ethane, which can be
intoxicating, as well as ethylene, widely used as an anesthetic in
the first half of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great gas," said toxicologist Henry Spiller, director of
the Kentucky Regional Poison Center in Louisville and another member
of the Delphi team. "It produces a very rapid onset of effects and
leaves the heart alone." Unfortunately, "it is also explosive [and]
dangerous for the surgeon," Spiller added, which is why modern
medicine eventually abandoned it.</TE>
<TE>   Ethylene, Spiller explained, produces "stages" of anesthesia. Low
doses induce "disembodied euphoria, with periods of excitation and
amnesia," he said. But at higher doses, "you get delirium, hysteria
and a combative, agitated state," he added. Further along come
unconsciousness and, if one is not careful, death.</TE>
<TE>   All of this squares nicely with historical accounts. As a high
priest at the temple in the 1st century, the biographer Plutarch
noted that the Pythia delivered oracles from a tripod in a small
below-ground chamber bathed in gases carried up by underground
springs.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the time, the priestess was conscious, clever and chatty,
but on occasion she flipped out, and things got nasty. The bad trips,
including a death reported by Plutarch, had led past Delphi
administrators to swap out the young maidens they used to put in the
seat for more levelheaded matrons. Today the temple ruins, on the
slopes of Mt. Parnassus, 100 miles northwest of Athens, are probably
the most visited place in Greece after the Acropolis.</TE>

<LD>   If there are still any bare spots in the garden where you would
like spring color, don't hesitate to pop in plants already in bloom
at nurseries in 4-inch or quart pots. Pansies are particularly
long-lived and planted now will last into early summer.</LD>
<LD>   This is also a great month to plant those towering delphiniums
from 4-inch pots. Add a little soil polymer (add water to the polymer
before using it) and slow-release fertilizer, such as Osmocote, to
the bottom of each hole. Delphiniums appreciate the additional
fertilizer and water stored in these high-tech products.</LD>

there will be more of them than ever before, and most of them will
want to stay in their own homes as they age.</LD>
<LD>   To meet this demographic challenge, the research arm of the
National Assn. of Home Builders has been seeking innovative ideas
from the young by launching a design competition for senior-friendly
housing.</LD>
<LD>   In the second annual contest held last fall, more than 90 students
of architecture, interior design and occupational therapy addressed
problems such as narrow doorways, dangerous stairs and inaccessible
kitchens and bathrooms.</LD>
<TE>   Winning designs included wide entryways with flush thresholds,
handrails disguised as decorative molding, such as chair rails, and
spaces with pocket doors to create a room for a caretaker.</TE>
<TE>   Half of the submissions focused on adapting a cluster of existing
urban townhouses and the rest on designing a new single-family
residence that would enable people to "age in place."</TE>
<TE>   The results were unveiled last month at the NAHB Research Center
headquarters in Upper Marlboro, Md.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the best ideas will be incorporated into a model "senior
friendly" idea house being built by the center and scheduled to open
to the public this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Readers looking for information about aging in place will also
find the center's Web site a handy resource: www.nahbrc.org. Just
click on "seniors" to find links to related literature, a checklist
for simple structural adaptations that could be made to any house and
a directory of helpful products.</TE>

<LD>What would you think if, 100 years from now, your school pictures
inspired an artist to create an exhibition?</LD>
<LD>   The people in these photographs had no idea their images would be
the focus of Carrie Mae Weems' artwork so many years later. African
American artist Weems used these images, together with her own
written and spoken words, to create a new work of art.</LD>
<LD>   Several of the images were taken by Frances Benjamin Johnston, a
photographer who lived a century ago. Johnston wanted to show how
well the students were doing with their studies at Hampton
University, a school for African and Native Americans.</LD>
<TE>   Weems enlarged the photographs and printed them on see-through
fabric banners. By hanging them together in one space, Weems
encourages visitors to move among the images almost as if moving back
through time.</TE>
<TE>   Weems wrote words she thought might stand in for the voices of the
people in the photographs. Though some of the words can be read,
others are spoken by Weems in a recording that is heard throughout
the exhibition. The words convey the strong emotions Weems imagined
these people might have felt as they left one culture behind to
become educated in American ways of life.</TE>
<TE>   "Carrie Mae Weems: The Hampton Institute" is on view at the
University Art Museum, Cal State Long Beach, through April 21. For
more information, call (562) 985-5761 or visit www.csulb.edu/org/uam.</TE>

<KH>Design Notes</KH>
<HD>The Dim Approach Is a Bright Idea</HD>
<DH>Indirect or ambient lighting can create an intimate space
and make a room more inviting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY BRYANT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barbra Streisand, according to columnist Liz Smith, once entered a
party at a friend's house, froze, took her host aside and said,
"Overhead lighting? Come on, can't we do something about this?" The
lighting was quickly dimmed to be more flattering to her.</LD>
<LD>   You don't have to be a celebrity to suffer from harsh overhead
lighting. "Everyone should invest in inexpensive dimmer switches for
the home," says lighting designer Robert Tant of Monrovia. "You
automatically increase the range of your lighting for about $6 a
switch."</LD>
<LD>   Dimmers are just one way to make rooms more inviting and
flattering. "Accent lighting, indirect lighting, ambient lighting and
task lighting all combine to give a good overall atmosphere and
intimate sense of space," Tant says. "If you're sitting in a room,
you want to be comfortable with indirect lighting, but you may also
want to read, and that requires task lighting that focuses directly
on your book."</LD>
<TE>   Another reason for multiple types of lighting is to create drama,
Tant says. "If you have just one switch in the room and it gives one
level of light, there's not much atmosphere. No one likes to feel as
if he's under a glaring spotlight," he says. And drama is about
contrast, which is what happens when you have a sharp accent light on
a piece of art or sculpture and the rest of the room has a soft
ambient light.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, lighting is the most important material in a project,"
says New York-based architect Michael Gabellini. "Even before I think
of any other thing, I think about the physical presence of light and
how to use it." For a new home, the cost of high-quality lighting can
start at 5% of the cost of the house, including fixtures, controls,
landscape lighting and design fees. Tant contends that in the long
run it's money well spent.</TE>
<TE>   Most people, however, don't design their houses from the ground up
but need to work with what they already have. Tant suggests being
creative in the use of portable lights. "You can buy inexpensive
compact fluorescent light sources, which are cooler than warm
incandescent lamps. Place them in inconspicuous places like above a
cabinet, on a shelf or on the floor behind a sofa, someplace where
they're concealed and the light spills out. Since they operate at a
low-voltage temperature, they don't get very hot and are safe," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Although many people dislike fluorescent lights, either because of
the color or the flickering, Tant suggests buying a small pack of
theatrical gels for about $18.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll have over 200 colors to experiment with by wrapping the
gels around the light," he says. "Try a light pink, amber or rose.
That adds a subtleness of color to your home. Concealing the source
of the ambient light is harder to do, but that creates the magic."</TE>
<TE>   Eliminating the glare from a room is another important thing Tant
recommends, either by replacing or removing harsh lights and
fixtures. Often just lowering wattage of lightbulbs helps. He also
suggests lighting the outside trees and plants if they can be seen
from inside at night, thus bringing the inside in.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything you do with lighting design in the house is an
enhancement, because most of the original lighting was just put there
to pass code," he says.</TE>
<TE>   For more information, the nonprofit Designer's Lighting Forum
holds monthly lectures. The next one is scheduled to take place on
March 4 at the Department of Water and Power offices downtown. The
topic will be "Historic Design and Restoration Lighting." For more

<HD>Bringing Olympic Visitors Up Close and Virtual</HD>
<DH>Samsung's visitor center stands out with flashy visuals on
a large scale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE STEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Visitors to the Winter Olympics may walk away talking about more than
just the medal winners and who crashed and burned on the slopes,
thanks to an ultramodern fiberglass interactive visitor center at
Olympic Square that offers a virtual snowball fight and live-action
screenings of the Games.</LD>
<LD>   The techie-named Olympic Rendezvous @ Samsung, which opens to the
public Friday, was built as a temporary structure on the seven-block
downtown area where the opening and closing ceremonies will be held
and where visitors can take a respite from the events.  It was
drawing lookie-loos even before construction was finished. The
Samsung pavilion is an official sponsor's showcase that stands out
among the other sponsors' tents that surround it, for both its large
scale and its flashy design.</LD>
<LD>   "Most of what we've put up to celebrate the Games is tenting and
looks like tenting," says Mitt Romney, CEO and president of the Salt
Lake Olympic Organizing Committee. "Samsung has a design which is
futuristic and high tech. When you walk inside, you think you're
going into a very luxurious museum."</LD>
<TE>   Out front,  lighted images span rows of curved, molded panels with
such catchy features as a digital snowbank and views of spectators
being interviewed by roving camera crews. In lieu of sound, comments
from the random crowd snapshots are relayed via scrolling text
messages. Once the Games begin, the screens will also relay live
images from the competitions.</TE>
<TE>   Samsung is just one of 63 official Olympic sponsors for the Salt
Lake Games, and the electronics company built this center not only to
highlight its latest wireless communication products but to help
market itself as a design-conscious firm. The company used the same
approach at the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympic Games, building a visitor
center with huge, curved sail-like scrims and drawing in some 1
million people. Samsung is trying for gold a second time.</TE>
<TE>   The design for this year's structure was created by Imagination, a
24-year-old London-based firm known for its avant-garde architecture,
interior design and light shows. Imagination was one of several firms
that contributed pavilions to London's Millennium Dome, and the firm
also built the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin, Ireland, a six-story
complex featuring a 100-foot-tall atrium shaped like a giant pint
glass. The company's clients include the Ford Motor Co. and
Coca-Cola.</TE>
<TE>   At Olympic Square in Salt Lake City, the two-story,
12,500-square-foot building boasts sophisticated, clean design that
could double for an interplanetary space station. Inside, surrounded
by  tomato-red pod-shaped sound baffles, anyone who cares to can make
free three-minute phone calls to anywhere in the world from phones
suspended from the ceiling.  Visitors can also have their own images
projected onto the exterior  through picture phones. Other new
Samsung products are displayed in floating plastic bubbles. An
Internet  cafe looks out over the main floor, and flat-screen
monitors offer glimpses of the Games.</TE>
<TE>   The highlight is sure to be a virtual snowball fight, set up
around a huge round royal-blue-rimmed table--the Olympic Committee's
Romney said he has already been pummeled by speed skater Bonnie
Blair. Using hand-held phone devices, players accumulate enough
"snow" to toss a snowball at another player across the table; virtual
snowballs travel across the table as crisscrossing light beams. A VIP
lounge is available upstairs for athletes and interviews, and various
performances will take place  on an inside stage. Samsung won't
reveal the cost of the building, but the company is spending $50
million on marketing and promotions for the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   There's no doubt that the bottom line here is selling the Samsung
brand in an increasingly competitive market. But doing it in an
eye-catching, consumer-friendly environment was paramount for the
Imagination team. With offices also in New York and soon to open in
Los Angeles, the design firm is drawing attention to clients by
creating interactive environments instead of relying on traditional
brochures, print ads or television commercials.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that everyone is much more affected by what they
experience than what they're told," says Mark Hider, CEO of
Imagination USA. From the living facade on, we wanted a way to draw
people in and to alert people that they're near something
interesting."</TE>
<TE>   But Hider believes that technological bells and whistles mean
little without a human element: "Technology is enabling all of this
to happen. But it's much more human and engaging because it's
technology on a human basis, not in a Big Brother way."</TE>
<TE>   Adding an interactive element to LED-screen technology was how
Hider wanted to use the medium: "Most LED boards are just running the
same loops of ads," he says. "But if you use them to deliver people
an experience with a purpose, I think people won't find them
intrusive but will find them stimulating and engaging."</TE>
<TE>   Imagination's arrival in L.A.--no formal date has been set--was
prompted by the desire to work more closely with existing clients
and develop relationships with entertainment companies and
information technology corporations, working on everything from
events and communication to marketing and conferences.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles, Hider believes, "has more than just a sympathy with
design. There's an understanding of new ideas ... and how experiences
can help in that regard."</TE>
<TE>   For Samsung, the goal was to create an environment that is
"welcoming, connective, dynamic and fun design for spectators," says
N.Y. Kim, project manager for the center. "Design for Samsung is
very, very important in terms of not only our products, but also our
showcase."</TE>

<HD>Meet Venus, Serena Williams</HD>
<DH>Part 4 The story so far: The Williams sisters have become
formidable tennis players.</DH>

<LD>Early in 1998, Venus won her first important tennis match in mixed
doubles, playing with Justin Gimelstob. They won at the Australian
Open, one of tennis' four big annual grand slams. At this tournament
she also played against her sister, Serena. They became the first
black sisters ever to compete against each other in a professional
event. Venus won.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sorry I had to take you out," she told Serena. The sisters
hugged, clasped hands and bowed to the crowd. The applause was
deafening. "If I had to lose, there's no one better to lose to than
Venus," Serena said. Venus replied, "Serena hates to lose, and her
reputation is she doesn't lose to anyone twice, so I'm going to be
practicing secretly if I want to win the next one."</LD>
<LD>   By 1998, Serena and Venus competed for the Lipton Championship in
Key Biscayne, Fla. Each got a chance to play against the world's No.
1 player, Martina Hingis. Serena lost to Hingis, but Venus won.</LD>
<TE>   Venus' serve has been clocked at 122 mph, the second-fastest serve
in the history of the women's circuit. "Hingis isn't as strong as I
am," Venus said. "The strong person doesn't have time to think as
much as the next person." She believes she'll be an even better
player when she learns to "think" more when playing.</TE>

<HD>Students Seek Solace in Classes on Sept. 11</HD>
<DH>UCLA is among the colleges rushing to meet a growing demand
for courses related to war  and terrorism.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Finally, UCLA freshman Kristin Grossheider feels as if she's in the
right place. Every week now, in an intimate lamp-lighted conference
room, she attends a one-credit seminar with 17 other undergraduates,
including a biology major from New York City, an anthropology major
from south Orange County and an undeclared major from Menlo Park.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time, Grossheider said, she is focusing on a topic
that had never been discussed in her classes or among  friends: Sept.
11.</LD>
<LD>   "I came here and figured, 'Oooh, college. I'll really get some
perspective on [the attacks],' but I just feel like I haven't at all.
People are just disconnected, and [in the dorms], we watch 'Friends'
instead of the news," said Grossheider, an 18-year-old biochemistry
major from Danville, Calif. "[The media] keeps saying we're at war,
but it just doesn't feel like it at all."</LD>
<TE>   This winter, at UCLA--and at several other colleges and
universities around the country--students are gravitating to a wide
and inspired range of Sept. 11-themed courses, still eager for
engagement on topics related to the terrorist attacks. Administrators
said they want the courses to cut across disciplines, in areas
including poetry and police culture.</TE>
<TE>   Under the banner of "Understanding Sept. 11, 2001," for instance,
Humboldt State lists 24 courses on topics including Afghanistan and
Islam, while, through the social work department, students can enroll
in "Loving Relationships."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is offering 37 such seminars, most of which are either filled
or over the enrollment limit of 15, university officials said. Senior
professors and leaders, including UCLA Chancellor Albert Carnesale,
are teaching  seminars without extra pay, some of them heading back
in the classroom for the first time in years.</TE>
<TE>   At Binghamton University, a State University of New York campus,
about 550 students are trying to get into a course called "Terrorism
and War." Half of the students wrote on enrollment questionnaires
that they either lost a friend or relative in the World Trade Center
devastation or knew someone who worked in the cleanup effort. The
lecture hall only holds 430, which puts political science professor
Robert Ostergard in the awkward position of having to turn away more
than 100 students.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew there would be some interest, but I expected it to wane,"
Ostergard said. "I thought a lot of students had been hit with
information overload."</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen faculty members are helping Ostergard teach the
four-credit course. He also has asked members of the psychology
department to weigh in, mindful of raw emotions. But he thinks that
enough time has passed for students to be able to concentrate on
topics such as civil liberties and the American psyche.</TE>
<TE>   "The further you get away [from Sept. 11], the better chance you
have of letting emotions die down a bit," Ostergard said. "Now
there's an atmosphere in the lecture hall that's one of
inquisitiveness. They're interested in trying to understand rather
than simply just reacting."</TE>
<TE>   At West Virginia University, by the first day of the spring
semester, more than 85% of the seats were filled in a slate of 18
courses on terrorism and similar subjects, including one called "All
but War is Simulation: Media Representation and War in Literature,
Film and Games." The Morgantown-based university is also offering
five English classes in which the readings and assignments are based
on the events of Sept. 11, said Provost Gerald Lang.</TE>
<TE>   Lang said he won't mind if some  courses are offered only this
semester. "I don't have any problem with riding whatever is current
or teaching courses that help students understand contemporary
issues," he said. "I expect the curriculum to keep changing to
reflect contemporary issues of the time."</TE>
<TE>   Last quarter, UCLA managed to create 49 seminars under the heading
"Perspectives on Sept. 11." Officials began planning the seminars on
the day of the attacks, and, within two weeks, had 49 offerings in
time for the fall term, which began Sept. 25. (The approval process
for new courses usually takes several months).</TE>
<TE>   UCLA doesn't plan to offer the slate of seminars next quarter,
although Sept. 11-related issues will continue to be addressed in
other courses, said Brian Copenhaver, provost of the College of
Letters and Science.</TE>
<TE>   But the university is likely to offer more courses in a similar
format, he said, based on reaction from students and professors who
praised the intimacy of the seminars. Copenhaver taught one of the
fall classes, focusing on Machiavelli's book "The Prince."</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of the most exciting teaching experiences I can
remember," said Copenhaver, who began teaching in 1964. "The level of
engagement of the students was really extraordinary. The best thing
that can happen in any class is when students teach other."</TE>
<TE>   Grossheider couldn't sign up for any of the fall seminars, which
were either full or didn't fit into her schedule. She began to worry
that the defining news story of her generation would slip away before
she could work out in her mind what happened and why. "My mom always
talks about the Vietnam War," Grossheider said. "I was kind of
worried how to talk to my [future] kids about [Sept. 11] and if I
would even know how."</TE>
<TE>   This quarter, Grossheider signed up for three of the seminars,
hoping to land one. She got into a 1st Amendment class taught by
Joseph Mandel, the university's lead lawyer and vice chancellor for
legal affairs. On the first day of class, Mandel, who had been out of
the classroom for eight years,  asked students to explain why he or
she enrolled in the class.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel really isolated from everything that's going on,"
Grossheider said. "I wish I knew so much more."</TE>
<TE>   "I promise," Mandel told her, "that by the end of the quarter, you
will."</TE>

<LD>Now that everyone's done oohing and aahing over Hamid Karzai's
wardrobe, it's time to decide how many more peacekeepers will be
needed to help Afghanistan's interim prime minister maintain security
so the country can be rebuilt. It won't be easy in a land that two
decades of war have left with no central government and with feuding
clans and tribes happy to use the weapons stashed in virtually every
household. But without security there is no nation-building: Bullying
thugs hijack food before it reaches the lips of starving children,
and bandits get fancy new trucks while the country lacks roads and
schools.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush said last week that the United States would help
Afghanistan develop a national army and train its police forces, but
he rejected Karzai's request to have U.S. troops in the international
peacekeeping force. It will take months to get Afghan troops and
police trained. Meanwhile, at a bare minimum, four or five cities
other than Kabul need help maintaining security.</LD>
<TE>   NATO allies have pledged troops for the initial force, and Britain
has taken the lead, supplying about 1,500 of the planned 5,000
soldiers--of which only about 3,000 are in country so far. British
officials said last week that Karzai argued well in pushing to
enlarge the force, but Britain does not plan to keep its troops there
beyond sometime in March, when Turks will take the lead. Afghan
officials have suggested increasing the peacekeepers to perhaps
20,000.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai and other Afghans want a foreign presence, especially
American, to show that outside nations are not about to cut and run
after the defeat of the Taliban and Al Qaeda as they did after the
Afghans defeated the Soviet invaders in 1989. That's a valid concern.
But U.S. and other troops need to avoid setting up long-term bases in
a country known for its hatred of foreign invaders. State Department
official Richard Haass said last weekend that peacekeepers might be
required for as long as two years. By then Afghans should be keeping
the peace, especially if men now serving in warlords' militias are
drafted into an Afghan army.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's problems are readily apparent in Gardez, where Karzai
tried to appoint a governor. Troops loyal to a rival commander used
heavy weapons to drive the newcomer out of town.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai's government managed to dispatch its own security force to
the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif this week in an effort to get the
region's main warlords to withdraw their forces and have most of
their fighters give up their AK47s and rocket-propelled grenades. But
there, as in Gardez and other cities and towns nationwide, it is
uncertain whether the warlords will stay out. An extra helping of
international peacekeepers--10,000 does not seem excessive--would
increase the odds.</TE>

<LD>The citizen commission redrawing Los Angeles City Council districts
launched a second round of public hearings this week to present its
proposed boundary changes--and invited Angelenos to come "[throw]
tomatoes at it." Figurative tomatoes, we hope. Controversy is a given
when remaking the city's political map. Openness isn't. For that, the
commission deserves bouquets along with the inevitable brickbats.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to the 1999 charter reforms, Los Angeles joins the handful
of governments that use an outside group to redraw electoral
boundaries rather than leaving it to insider politics of the
smoke-filled-room variety.</LD>
<LD>   Whether at the national, state or local level, redistricting is
triggered once a decade by the U.S. census and must reflect
population swells and dips. New boundaries must also meet federal
fairness requirements. But there is room for manipulating boundaries
to include friendly voters and exclude troublesome ones. This can
result in oddly shaped districts that serve politicians, not
residents. Consider how the California Legislature wheeled and dealed
and redrew to favor the incumbent party. The primary election was all
that counted.</LD>
<TE>   The L.A. City Council still has the power to engage in shenanigans
because the commission's role is advisory, but the process is now
open enough to make such tinkering visible.</TE>
<TE>   The new charter directed the commission to keep "communities of
interest" intact as much as possible while meeting population and
legal requirements. This was daunting, given the battles that even
some Neighborhood Councils are fighting over boundaries. But the
commission has largely succeeded, uniting communities like Van Nuys,
which was divided among a record five council districts. The
commission mapped a Los Angeles that reflects a shift in
population--and clout--to the San Fernando Valley and to Latinos,
while preserving the three districts dominated by black voters. This
doesn't mean that the process is divorced from politics. The
21-member panel was after all appointed by City Council members, the
city attorney and Mayor James K. Hahn. The politics of incumbency
play out in certain decisions.</TE>
<TE>   To form a new district in the fast-growing east Valley, the
commission would combine slower-growing Westside districts and
literally move one to the Valley. The more likely to be moved of the
two districts under consideration is the one represented by
termed-out Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who leaves office in 2003 and
last year lost a bid for the council presidency. A related case is
the old Valley district of resigned Councilman Joel Wachs. Whoever is
elected March 5 to fill Wachs' seat will want some sway over how that
district is made. Even more important is what the voters who live in
those districts have to say during the commission's final public
hearings, in the next several days.</TE>
<TE>   Redistricting always causes screams of political pain. But the
process this time has been better than what went before. The City
Council needs to keep that public spirit in mind when it receives the
commission's final proposal March 1.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To Take Action: The commission will hold public hearings this
Saturday, Monday and Wednesday. For times, locations and proposed
district maps, go to the commission's Web site,
www.lacity.org/redistricting, or call (213) 473-4595.  Mail comments

<HD>Import Tariffs' True Costs</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>President Clinton may not have been the most adamant free-trader to
occupy the White House, but he did resist political pressures from
the U.S. steel industry for tariffs on steel imports. President Bush,
who often touts his belief in free trade in a globalized marketplace,
should do the same.</LD>
<LD>   For every job that tariffs on steel imports ''save'' in old and
increasingly obsolete companies, the overall U.S. economy ends up
losing up to 13 jobs as a result of the economic drag of higher steel
prices to manufacturers. Fewer washing machines get sold, and the
washing machine assembly line worker gets laid off.</LD>
<LD>   Bush should not put an anchor on the economy just to save a
segment of U.S. heavy industry, concentrated in the old Rust Belt,
that has been in decline for 25 years and has little future in a
globalized economy.</LD>
<TE>   For decades, the steel industry has, with varied success, asked
U.S. administrations to impose tariffs on foreign steel. Last
December, Bush's Commerce Department unfortunately ruled that a
tariff of up to 40% was justified for some steel products. One member
of the department's International Trade Commission was quoted as
saying that the ruling was meant to give Bush ''leverage'' during
global trade negotiations to reduce production. Yet by the time this
recommendation was made, the top steel-producing nations had already
agreed that a 10% cut in worldwide production would be feasible.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. steel industry is really two different industries. One
employs about 100,000 people and has failed to modernize its large,
increasingly unprofitable blast furnace operations. The other is
composed of modern ''mini-mills,'' smaller plants with high-tech
electric furnaces. Today, these mini-mills produce the full range of
steel products and their share of the U.S. market is up to 45% from a
mere 10% a quarter-century ago. They don't need or ask for protective
trade barriers because they are cost-efficient and profitable even at
today's prices.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. trade law says that any final remedy imposed by the president
must ''provide greater economic and social benefits than costs.''
Bush has until March 6 to decide his course. He should reject tariffs
that serve only to protect outdated businesses at a high cost to
consumers and workers.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Budget Taps Social Security Surplus</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Bush's Budget Opts for Debt to Fund War," Feb. 5: Your graph
showed 66 cents of each dollar going to human services such as Social
Security. The vast majority of these funds are self-funded Social
Security funds. When you exclude them and focus on the discretionary
spending that Congress and the president actually control, over 50%
of these discretionary funds go to the military. This is also because
the Defense Department's budget does not include the Energy
Department's budget, which pays tens of billions of dollars for our
nuclear weapons programs; the $7 billion in the Department of
Transportation proposed for the Coast Guard and the almost $5 billion
slated for airport security; billions to the State Department to
support our war on terrorism; and the scores of billions of dollars
in interest payments that can be laid squarely at the feet of the
Reagan military buildup.</LD>
<LD>   Congress created the unified budget, bringing the trust funds into
its pie charts, to hide the above picture, but it is up to us to set
it straight.</LD>

<TE>   In "An Orgy of Defense Spending" (Commentary, Feb. 5), Robert
Scheer claimed that the president's budget, specifically the increase
in defense spending, will do more damage to our country than any
terrorist. Really? Spending increases on our military will be worse
than planes flying into buildings, the murder of thousands of people,
the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars in New York alone and the
resulting changes in our lifestyle? Is he serious?</TE>
<TE>   Amazing that Scheer's screed is directed at Bush's proposed
military spending, yet when a Democrat, Sen. Patty Murray of
Washington, pushed through pork-fest legislation to spend nearly $25
billion to lease Boeing planes (made in her home state, of course)
without the safety net of competitive bids, Scheer said nothing of
her actions. In fact, in a Jan. 8 commentary, he briefly mentioned
the boondoggle, but get this: He blamed Bush, not Murray, for bailing
out a company that was laying off workers. Amazing, but not
surprising.</TE>

<TE>   What is so maddening about the current deficit and the proposed
need to dig into the Social Security fund surplus is that last year's
tax cut was a result of the administration and Congress turning a
deaf ear to what the public wanted. (Polls at the time showed that
Americans did not want the Bush tax cut.) Now 80% of the public
(Times Poll, Feb. 5) prefers deferring the tax cut to dipping into
the Social Security surplus.</TE>
<TE>   Now, let's see. We the voters somewhat elected the president and
directly elected members of Congress. Right? But wait a minute. We
forgot to make that large campaign contribution.</TE>

<HD>Mammography Is a Lifesaving Procedure</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am extremely distressed about the conflicting opinions from various
organizations concerning the value of annual mammograms (Feb. 1). In
1995, at age 57, I was diagnosed with breast cancer after my annual
mammogram. My shock was profound, as I had no family history of
breast cancer and my annual physicals had shown no evidence of lumps
or cysts. The cancer I had was not large enough for any doctor to
feel, and without the mammogram I would have gone another year
without treatment.</LD>
<LD>   Because it was caught so early, I endured only 33 radiations and a
lumpectomy. I truly feel that the mammogram saved my life, if not my
breast. What is the downside of mammography? Most health insurance
covers the procedure and, if done properly, it is mildly
uncomfortable for a few seconds. Women are already confused about
hormone replacement therapy, and to "fan the fire" about an annual
mammogram is unconscionable!</LD>

<HD>Yosemite Valley Plan Limits Visitors Overall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was greatly dismayed by your Jan. 15 editorial, "Meddling With
Paradise." As someone who was born, raised and continues to reside
next door to Yosemite, my feelings about the park's future are vast
and deep. In fact, I find myself backpacking every summer in the high
country and taking my wife and son on picnics to the base of Half
Dome.</LD>
<LD>   Since day one, I have been involved with the development of the
Yosemite Valley Plan. I have been very active and continue to
participate in all the public discussions. I have met with the
environmental community at every turn. This effort has resulted in a
Yosemite Valley Plan that contains many good recommendations needed
to improve and update the park--recommendations that should be
implemented and that we are moving forward with presently. However,
the Yosemite Valley Plan also contains provisions that, if fully
implemented, will spend millions of dollars in one-time costs,
increase the park's annual operating budget and cut park services. A
plan that slashes park services while increasing costs does not sound
like a good deal for those who own the park: the American taxpayers.</LD>
<TE>   Overall, the plan limits the ability of the public to visit and
enjoy America's most spectacular national park. I believe in
implementing a plan that strikes a balance between preserving the
environmental integrity of the park and maintaining an open access
policy for visitors.</TE>

<HD>Linking War on Drugs to War on Terror</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Office of National Drug Control Policy, through its ads televised
during the Super Bowl [and in The Times, Page A15, Feb. 4], would
have us believe that those who consume prohibited drugs are in effect
supporting terrorists. This is simply typical drug-war-speak,
rhetoric designed to emotionally rally support for escalation of the
unwinnable war on noncorporate drugs.</LD>
<LD>   In tying drug-trade profits to terrorism this government agency
clearly shows us why the drug war and prohibitions should end.
Clearly, the more successful the efforts are in interrupting drug
flow, the higher the profits become for those involved. The drug war
thusly serves as a protection racket for those high profits. It's the
ONDCP, our national drug policy and drug prohibition that have made
simple garden products more valuable than gold and handed terrorists
a means to support their activities on a silver platter.</LD>
<LD>   The yet-to-be-learned lesson of the drug war is that good
intentions can become liberty-consuming bureaucracies creating their
own reasons to exist and expand with time. Let's all pray the war on
terrorism (a response to administer justice for the crimes of Sept.
11) does not become a similar institution.</LD>
<TE>   Richard L. Root</TE>
<TE>   Westminster</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I find the recent television and print ads linking drug use and
terrorism to be very disturbing. Although it is not unlikely that
some drug money does get funneled to terrorist organizations, the
sole reason for this is the current state of prohibition. Just as
alcohol prohibition fueled organized crime back in the 1920s, the war
on drugs fuels crime today. In 1929, when President Hoover appointed
a commission to study the overwhelming disobedience to Prohibition,
that commission concluded that Prohibition was unenforceable. Nothing
has changed since then.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Parsons</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So now the U.S. government thinks it's OK to blame drug users for
the terrorist attacks. "I helped blow up buildings," said one young
man in the commercial aired during the Super Bowl. Both spurious and
sensationalist, this is the most offensive propaganda yet to come out
of our futile war on drugs. Our drug money supports terrorism, but
our oil money doesn't? When will we see the president and vice
president in a commercial saying, "I helped blow up buildings"?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Boxing Commission: Don't Bite," editorial, Feb. 4: Mike Tyson
deserves to have a license to fight anywhere in the world, especially
in Las Vegas (the boxing capital of the world). How can the Nevada
State Athletic Commission deny Tyson a license? After all, he is a
legendary boxer who is one of the most entertaining sports figures of
all time. Denying him a license will affect the sport of boxing.</LD>
<LD>   The Nevada commission and the California State Athletic Commission
need to forgive and forget about Tyson's past. One of them should let
the April 6 fight between two of the greatest heavyweight fighters
today take place. After all, Tyson does not need to be a role model
to anybody but needs to entertain the boxing world with his heroic
presence in the ring. How can the Nevada State Athletic Commission
deny a license to the greatest fighter in recent decades, whom
everyone wants to see fight? I guess the commission--and boxing as a
sport--wants to lose fans and money, which does not make sense.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Tyson versus Lennox Lewis will be one of the biggest sports
events of the year. Tyson should have a license to fight anywhere in
the world.</LD>

<TE>   Applause for your editorial urging the California State Athletic
Commission to refuse to grant Tyson a license to fight in Los
Angeles. Boos for Tim Leiweke, Staples Center president, for being so
anxious to grab a few dollars that he "would very much like to hold
the fight here." The day that Los Angeles has to take Las Vegas
rejects is the day we should all pack up and leave.</TE>

<LD>So Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld wants us to believe that evil
Iran is aiding the Taliban ("Iran Helped Al Qaeda and Taliban Flee,
Rumsfeld Says," Feb. 4). This would, of course, require us to ignore
the fact that Iran was fighting against the Taliban while the CIA was
still supporting it. There is no love lost between the Taliban, or
the Saudi-backed Al Qaeda, and Iran. Rumsfeld's claim is disingenuous
and intended to set the stage for a wider war.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, Pakistan is clearly helping transfer fighters
out of Afghanistan into Kashmir, and India is supporting the Northern
Alliance with funds and weapons. Why doesn't the "axis of evil" run
through New Delhi and Islamabad?</LD>

<LD>In "Last Refuge of a Politician in Trouble" (Opinion, Feb. 3), James
Campbell writes of years of watching Republican leaders "devalue the
suffering of others with talk of responsibility and rugged
individualism." Demonizing a sense of personal responsibility by
linking it with Republicans is clever but futile. My immigrant
forebears were certainly not Republicans but they did encourage their
children to take responsibility for their lives instead of weeping in
a corner, bewailing their misfortunes and envying the rich. They
lacked Campbell's advanced degrees but certainly surpassed him in
wisdom and a sense of the practical. I will always be grateful to
them.</LD>

<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the financial
records of L90 Inc., a Marina del Rey online direct marketer, and
issued subpoenas to the company and one of its directors.</LD>
<LD>   The company that had been poised to acquire L90 this month, Los
Angeles online entertainment company EUniverse Inc., said that the
probe will delay the acquisition at least until March. The cash deal,
announced in early January and expected to close this month, was
expected to be worth as much as $55 million.</LD>
<LD>   Both the SEC and the company declined to comment on the
investigation, though L90 executives added that they have also
received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Investigations requesting
information. In addition, the company's vice president of finance
resigned Friday.</LD>
<TE>   L90 officials declined to comment or give the executive's name,
saying only the audit committee of its board of directors, which will
conduct its own investigation, will consider the circumstances of the
resignation.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The top executives of the U.S. Big Three auto manufacturers have sent
a rare joint letter to the White House, asking President Bush to
appeal to the Japanese government to stop weakening the yen to boost
the profits of Japanese auto makers.</LD>
<LD>   The chief executives of General Motors Corp. , Ford Motor Co. and
DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler, which together account for nearly 4% of
the U.S. economy, said in the letter sent last week that the weak yen
was a threat to U.S. economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. auto makers charge that Japan, in an effort to stimulate its
weak economy, has purposely weakened the yen to make Japan's auto
makers more profitable from their sales of new cars and trucks in the
U.S. market.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Corp., trying to reverse a slide in consumer long-distance phone
sales, said it will sell long-distance calling in the U.S. for $19.95
a month when customers call other AT&amp;T residential subscribers for
any number of minutes.</LD>
<LD>   All other U.S. long-distance calls will be billed at 7 cents a
minute, AT&amp;T said. The New York-based company said it will offer the
service, AT&amp;T Unlimited, to its 50 million long-distance subscribers.</LD>
<LD>   AT&amp;T, the largest U.S. long-distance carrier, and its rivals face
lower sales as calling prices fall as low as 2 cents a minute as new
companies enter the market and consumers turn to e-mail.</LD>
<TE>   Representatives for WorldCom Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and
Sprint Corp. said the AT&amp;T plan would have little or no effect on
their operations.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AT&amp;T fell 67 cents to $15.60 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Calpine Shares Drop On SEC Investigation</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calpine Corp. said the Securities and Exchange Commission is
investigating whether the company had improperly disclosed financial
information to analysts, sending its shares down 22% to a two-year
low.</LD>
<LD>   A request for information by the SEC's enforcement division
relates to a Jan. 4 Dow Jones Newswire report that Calpine tipped off
analysts to spending cuts and lower earnings that it publicly
announced days later, spokesman Bill Highlander said. Calpine has
made no inappropriate disclosures, he said.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation comes amid heightened scrutiny over energy
companies' finances in the wake of Enron Corp.'s collapse and lower
electricity and natural gas prices. Shares of Calpine are down 83%
from a year ago, and shares of other energy companies such as Mirant
Corp. and Dynegy Inc. also have fallen.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of San Jose-based Calpine fell $1.95 to $6.80 on the NYSE.</TE>

was expected to be 14 cents, the average estimate of seven analysts

<LD>   Microsoft and IBM have combined efforts on standards that will
foster development of Web services that share information between
normally incompatible programs, computers and Web sites. The
consortium will ensure that the firms implement the standards
correctly, allowing all companies' products to work with one another.</LD>

<HD>UBS, Ex-Enron Traders to Revive Trading Soon</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UBS said it expected to complete this week its purchase of Enron
Corp.'s energy-trading business, which would resume electricity and
natural gas transactions that all but dried up after Enron's
bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   About 625 Enron traders, technicians and back-office workers are
preparing to buy and sell energy contracts for UBS, though no date
has been set, UBS spokesman David Walker said. Enron traders have
been contacting former customers and lining up credit agreements that
UBS will need to complete transactions.</LD>
<LD>   The energy-trading business won't come close to equaling the $43.4
billion in revenue it generated for Enron in the third quarter,
before its collapse, Enron traders said. Many customers that were
burned by Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing have taken their business
to competitors.</LD>
<TE>   UBS, which is based in Switzerland, won a bankruptcy auction for
Enron's dormant trading business. Under the bid, which was approved
by a U.S. bankruptcy judge Jan. 18, UBS would pay Enron a royalty of
33% of pretax profit from the trading business.</TE>

'sub-prime' loans to poor and minority consumers.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An advocacy group for poor and minority consumers filed a lawsuit
Wednesday accusing Household International Corp. of systematically
cheating thousands of California residents who took out loans with
the company.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed in Alameda County Superior Court, said the company
and two units routinely roped customers into consolidating their home
mortgages and other debts, taking out loans they would have great
difficulty repaying because of high interest rates, penalties and
other conditions.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit seeks to invalidate as much as $2 billion in loans
issued to tens of thousands of borrowers in the last four years by
Household, parent of the Beneficial and Household finance companies.
The suit, which seeks class-action status, was filed by the Assn. of
Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN.</LD>
<TE>   Household, which earned $1.9 billion last year on nearly $12
billion in revenue, is one of the biggest lenders to consumers with
poor credit or scanty credit histories--so-called sub-prime borrowers
described by activists as typically unsophisticated, stressed-out
financially and vulnerable to unethical lenders.</TE>
<TE>   Megan Hayden, a spokeswoman for Household, based in Prospect
Heights, Ill., said she had not read the lawsuit but was skeptical of
the claims. She said ACORN has been involved in earlier complaints
about Household that were "factually misleading" and did not result
in lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "We look forward to a fair hearing on this complaint so we can
focus on the facts rather than rhetoric," Hayden said.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit is the latest in a series of high-profile attacks
against what consumer advocates say are the predatory lending
practices of some sub-prime lenders.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles area has become fertile territory for such
companies because of its multitude of low- and moderate-income
families, often minorities, said Peter Kuhns, head organizer for
ACORN's Los Angeles office. He said his office receives more
complaints about Household than any other lender.</TE>
<TE>   Household is facing a similar lawsuit in New York state court
filed by AARP.</TE>
<TE>   In California last month, Household agreed to pay about $12
million to settle state regulators' allegations that it routinely
overcharged residents on loans of $2,500 or less. The Department of
Corporations had filed a lawsuit alleging a "pervasive pattern of
abusive lending practices" by Household and Beneficial.</TE>
<TE>   The ACORN lawsuit asks that the debt-consolidation loans be
rescinded and that interest, fees and profit gained as a result of
unfair, unlawful or deceptive advertising be returned to borrowers.
It also seeks punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowers Julio and Irene Reyes of Bakersfield and Suzanne
Alexander of Orangeville, Calif., also are named as plaintiffs in the
suit.</TE>

<HD>Video, DVD Boost MGM to Record 4th Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home video and DVD sales propelled Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. to a
record fourth quarter, the company announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Profit for the fourth quarter more than tripled to $39 million, or
16 cents a share, up from $12.4 million, or 6 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period. Revenue jumped to $375.5 million, up 28.6% from
$292 million a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The earnings exceeded the company's December guidance of about 12
cents a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had
expected earnings of 5 cents a share.</LD>
<TE>   Company executives Wednesday would not discuss financier Kirk
Kerkorian's efforts to find a buyer for the storied studio; he owns
81% of MGM stock.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with analysts, Chairman and Chief Executive
Alex Yemenidjian said MGM has openly discussed for more than two
years its goal to become a company with "more scale and more
diversification of revenue stream."</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing has changed," Yemenidjian said.</TE>
<TE>   MGM's bigger-than-expected revenue was fueled by sales of
videocassettes and DVDs, specifically last summer's Reese Witherspoon
hit "Legally Blonde"; "Heartbreakers," with Sigourney Weaver and
Jennifer Love Hewitt; and "Hannibal," starring Anthony Hopkins.</TE>
<TE>   Worldwide home video revenue increased 57% over the fourth quarter
of 2000. Domestic DVD unit shipments were up 172% for the entire
year.</TE>
<TE>   MGM did not have a home-run theatrical hit during the fourth
quarter. The October release of "Bandits," a Bruce Willis-Billy Bob
Thornton-Cate Blanchett robber caper, has been a disappointment with
$41 million in box-office receipts, and the studio bumped back its
release of the World War II story "Windtalkers," with Nicolas Cage,
to June 14.</TE>
<TE>   "The library cash flow really was the story here," said David
Miller, media analyst and vice president at the investment banking
firm Sanders Morris Harris. "These results underscore the power of
MGM's film library as the company's crown-jewel asset."</TE>
<TE>   Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer Chris McGurk said the
studio has released only 580 DVD movies from its library of more than
4,100 titles.</TE>
<TE>   MGM did not release any videos or DVDs from its James Bond
franchise last year, preferring to wait until the November release of
the 20th Bond picture.</TE>
<TE>   "We're keeping our powder dry on the Bond movies," McGurk said,
adding that the studio will soon release the name of the new Bond
picture.</TE>
<TE>   The studio expects earnings to fall this quarter, particularly
because of the expense of promoting its big-budget films
"Rollerball," which will be released Friday, and "Hart's War," with
Bruce Willis, which will open next week. MGM spent about $1.8 million
for one commercial during the Super Bowl for "Hart's War." McGurk
said the studio gambled on the Super Bowl ad because the movie is
geared toward men older than 17--the same demographic the game
attracts.</TE>
<TE>   MGM had its biggest year at the box office last year, McGurk said,
with grosses of nearly $450 million and a 6% market share. The
studio, which released 11 movies in 2001, plans to release 12 this
year, including the Bond picture.</TE>
<TE>   MGM shares rose 10 cents to close at $19.25 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Amgen Inc., which is acquiring rival Immunex Corp., said the two
companies received a request for additional information from the
Federal Trade Commission about their $16-billion combination.</LD>
<LD>   The two drug makers ''intend to respond promptly to the
information request, which is a matter of routine and customary in
these sorts of matters,'' said Amgen spokesman Jeff Richardson. Amgen
and Immunex said they still expect that the merger will be completed
during the second half of 2002. It is the second request made by the
FTC.</LD>

<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. and Compaq Computer Corp. will ask shareholders
to approve their proposed $23-billion merger on consecutive days next
month.</LD>
<LD>   Dates were set in a final merger prospectus filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The move indicates the companies
are reasonably confident U.S. regulators will clear the deal.</LD>
<LD>   There has been substantial opposition to the deal, notably by
Hewlett and Packard family interests with 18% of HP stock. The deal's
chief critic, HP board member Walter Hewlett, began mailing out proxy
materials to solicit votes against the deal.</LD>
<TE>   At HP's meeting March 19 in Cupertino, Calif., the deal will
require the approval of a majority of all votes cast. Yes votes from
a majority of all Compaq holders would be needed for the deal to be
sealed March 20 in Houston. Only people who held HP and Compaq shares
as of Jan. 28 can vote.</TE>
<TE>   HP lost 54 cents to $20.85 on the New York Stock Exchange, where
Compaq fell 7 cents to $11.93.</TE>

<HD>Academy Sues Over 'Obscene' Replicas of Oscar</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN W. O'NEILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which zealously
guards Oscar's golden image, has filed a federal trademark and
copyright infringement suit against a Chatsworth company that offers
anatomically correct--or rather, anatomically exaggerated--copycat
statuettes over an Internet porn site.</LD>
<LD>   Named in the academy's U.S. District Court suit is Pipedream
Products Inc., which the academy alleges is "importing or
manufacturing and selling a large number of obscene or kitsch items
making unauthorized use of the academy's 'Oscar' copyright and design
mark."</LD>
<LD>   The academy contends that Pipedream Products is "willfully and
maliciously causing deception in the marketplace." A company
representative had no comment.</LD>
<TE>   Pipedream's replica closely resembles Oscar--with one prominent
difference. Its 10-inch "Stud of the Year" statuette is more than
generously endowed.</TE>
<TE>   The real Oscar is 13 inches tall, weighs 8-1/2 pounds and is
plated with 24-carat gold. It has no sex organs, the academy's court
papers say.</TE>
<TE>   The academy's suit contends that the replica Oscars are being sold
to the public "in a manner likely to cause confusion" and tarnish the
original Oscar's classy image. The academy is asking the court for an
injunction barring their sale.</TE>
<TE>   The suit is the latest in a series of legal actions the academy
has taken over the years against companies that make or sell novelty
Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the academy announced, a French telecommunications
company agreed to pay $41,000 to settle a lawsuit over infringing
Oscar symbols on phone calling cards. France Telecom also agreed to
stop selling the cards.</TE>
<TE>   And the academy's lawyers are due in federal court today for a
contempt hearing against a Bell Gardens company that supplies replica
Oscars to novelty shops along Hollywood Boulevard. The academy
obtained a restraining order against the company, Karol Western
Corp., in January, said academy lawyer David W. Quinto.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Davis, the academy's executive director, said past disputes
have been resolved with the companies agreeing to slight differences
in their Oscar statuettes.</TE>
<TE>   "They can spread the legs apart and hold the elbows out or have
the arms over the head, and we won't complain. But even on those they
cannot have awards categories. They can't have Best Actor, but they
can have Best Dad or Best Fisherman," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis added that "the taste factor" compelled the academy to take
the latest legal action.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who owns a trademark doesn't want an obscene version of it
circulating," he said. "If you make an anatomically correct Michelin
man, the Michelin guys will come after you."</TE>

<HD>Labor Department Investigating Disputed SAG National
Election</HD>
<DH>Unions: Members' petition citing alleged ballot
irregularities will not derail a new vote next month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Labor Department is investigating last year's national election
of the Screen Actors Guild to determine whether alleged ballot
irregularities influenced the outcome of the vote, various sources
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, five SAG members asked the Labor Department to
intervene after the union's elections committee in January scrapped
the results of the November election of  SAG President Melissa
Gilbert and two other nationally elected officers.</LD>
<LD>   In their petition to the Labor Department, SAG members argued that
the elections committee lacked the authority to overturn the election
and that they were biased toward Valerie Harper, who lost the
presidential race to Gilbert by 1,588 votes out of about 28,000 votes
cast.</LD>
<TE>   The elections committee voted to scrap the election results
because New York members had two extra days to vote and the company
that printed the East Coast ballots failed to include a signature
line similar to ballots sent to members on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Although the five SAG members hoped their Labor Department
petition would derail the new election, it will go as planned because
the government's investigation could last up to 60 days. Ballots will
be mailed to SAG members Monday and are due by March 8, when the
votes will be tabulated.</TE>
<TE>   Harper issued a statement Wednesday saying the November election
was "badly bungled" and that she was confident the Labor Department
would protect union members' "right to a fair and honest election."</TE>
<TE>   Amy Aquino, a SAG board member who is a Gilbert supporter, said
some "Harper supporters took two benign procedural mishaps and
they're trying to turn these into violations."</TE>
<TE>   In the most extreme case, the government could call for a SAG
election that would be supervised by the Labor Department.</TE>

<PH>THE FALL OF ENRON</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>Accounting Concerns Add Up to Stock Woes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors' sudden obsession with accounting irregularities is likely
to weigh on the stock market throughout 2002, raising the specter of
a third consecutive down year on Wall Street for the first time since
World War II.</LD>
<LD>   At the very least, market watchers say, accounting concerns fueled
by the collapse of Enron Corp. could put a damper on any rally that
might otherwise accompany an economic rebound.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a dangerous time for the stock market," said Robert Shiller,
Yale economics professor and author of the 2000 book "Irrational
Exuberance." He noted that the uproar over corporate accounting comes
at a time when investors already are faced with a pricey stock market
and a U.S. economy that is struggling to emerge from recession.</LD>
<TE>   Enron fallout "is likely to have a major impact on the market over
the next year or so," said Chuck Hill, research director at earnings
tracker Thomson Financial/First Call in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Major U.S. stock indexes fell for a fourth straight session
Wednesday, in part because of continuing worries that many companies
may have used accounting gimmicks to dress up their financial reports
in recent years. The benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is down
5.6% year to date after sliding 9% in 2000 and 12% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Paul J. Zak, associate professor of economics at Claremont
Graduate University, said investors are girding for "the probability
that more companies will have to restate profits and that future
accounting standards will be tighter and future profits slimmer."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the recent attention has been focused on conglomerate Tyco
International Ltd., whose shares lost half their value over the last
two weeks as concerns grew over the reliability of its earnings
statements--including the disclosure this week that the firm spent $8
billion on 700 acquisitions over the last three years without making
them public.</TE>
<TE>   The latest victim of investor concern was software maker VeriSign
Inc., which slid almost 10% Wednesday on worries that its revenue
might be inflated by sales to affiliated companies.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Tyco and VeriSign, stocks under the accounting microscope
include Reliant Resources Inc., the power trading arm of Reliant
Energy Inc.; Irish drug giant Elan Corp.; and computer networking
company Enterasys Networks Inc. The stocks have sunk 40% to 70% year
to date.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question there will be more blowups coming, more
mini-Enrons," Hill said, calling the trend a cyclical phenomenon. "At
the peak stages of a business cycle, pressure builds on companies to
push the envelope. When the downturn inevitably comes, the dirty
laundry gets aired and we make corrections to the process."</TE>
<TE>   The accounting fears pose a two-pronged problem for the market,
Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   First, wary investors may be reluctant to pay high prices for
stocks when the corporate earnings they use to value the shares could
be unreliable.</TE>
<TE>   Second, earnings reported in the coming months may be reduced as
nervous auditors clamp down on any accounting strategy that might be
deemed aggressive. Auditors don't want to be tagged as "another
Andersen," he said, any more than companies want to called "the next
Enron." Accounting giant Andersen is under fire for its role in the
Enron fiasco.</TE>
<TE>   If corporate earnings and the value investors place on those
earnings fall, so do stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   Zak said the risk to the market is a continuing series of earnings
restatements chipping away at confidence--or a bombshell involving a
blue-chip stalwart like General Electric Co., General Motors Corp. or
IBM Corp. that provides another jolt on the scale of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "Trust has a huge impact on the economy," he said. "If another big
shoe drops and this gets to the point where investors start pulling
money out of stock mutual funds, bankers tighten their reins and
companies can't raise capital through the debt or equity markets for
expansion, that wouldn't bode well for growth."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the accounting controversy, market analysts hope the
economy will rebound strongly enough to overcome doubts about
corporate earnings and give investors a reason to buy stocks.</TE>
<TE>   As Hill put it, accounting jitters are a depressant. The market
won't rise as much as it might have otherwise, but any gains would be
welcome.</TE>
<TE>   "I still believe there will be an economic and earnings recovery,
but it will be muted," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A reassuring sign for the market, Zak said, is that mutual fund
investors have held tight: New cash invested has slightly outpaced
redemptions this year. Despite the accounting concerns, the U.S.
remains "the cleanest stock market on the planet," he said. He also
noted that baby boomers have few attractive alternatives for their
retirement savings.</TE>
<TE>   In the long run, regulatory fallout from the Enron debacle is
expected to have a positive impact on U.S. markets.</TE>
<TE>   "In the short run this could hurt, but in the long run more
diligent accounting and auditing is going to be a healthy thing,"
Shiller said.</TE>
<TE>   Hill said the controversy will result in tighter rules adopted by
the accounting industry and tougher regulatory enforcement on
companies reporting misleading earnings.</TE>
<TE>   He called the Securities and Exchange Commission's recent cautious
advice on so-called pro forma earnings "a big step forward." In an
alert posted at its Web site (www.sec.gov), the agency urges
shareholders and prospective investors to view any earnings report
highlighting pro forma numbers with "appropriate and healthy
skepticism."</TE>
<TE>   Pro forma numbers often do not conform to generally accepted
accounting rules. They are hypothetical, based on company assumptions
that may or may not be valid or helpful to investors, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Hill said, he has been heartened to see firms such as AOL
Time Warner Inc. and computer chip maker Xilinx Inc. move away from
pro forma earnings.</TE>
<TE>   But Hill warned that investors and Wall Street analysts will have
to remain diligent.</TE>
<TE>   "Five years from now if the economy is booming, companies may not
pull another Enron exactly but they will get bold again one way or
another," he said. "That's the way it works."</TE>

<HD>Analyst Disclosure Rules to Be Unveiled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Lawmakers and regulators plan to unveil rules today that would
increase disclosure requirements for Wall Street stock analysts.</LD>
<LD>   The proposals are designed to prevent conflicts of interest, and
include a measure that would bar tying analyst compensation to
specific investment banking transactions.</LD>
<LD>   They also would restrict an analyst's personal trading of
securities and bar securities firms from offering favorable research
to attract business.</LD>
<TE>   "Consider this Round 1 for comprehensive post-Enron reforms," said
Rep. Richard H. Baker (R-La.), chairman of the House Financial
Services subcommittee on capital markets.</TE>
<TE>   The rules were being drafted before the Enron collapse, but
according to Baker, they are "highly pertinent and timely with regard
to what went wrong in the Enron debacle and will go a long way toward
making sure the hand analysts played in the Enron house of cards is
never played again."</TE>
<TE>   The proposals will be detailed today at a Capitol Hill news
conference with Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L.
Pitt and Robert R. Glauber, president and chief executive of the
National Assn. of Securities Dealers.</TE>
<TE>   A Thomson Financial survey of research recommendations covering
Enron on Nov. 29, 2001, a day after the stock price fell from the
60-cent to the 40-cent range, found six "strong buy"s, two "buy"s,
six "hold"s and only one "sell."</TE>
<TE>   Critics have long complained that analysts' judgment is clouded by
the large investment banking fees they collect from companies they
rate.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two brokers who changed their recommendations after Enron
shares fell below a dollar, one went from "strong buy" to "hold," and
the other went from "buy" to "market underperform," Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   Baker said that congressional hearings held even before the Enron
collapse "appeared to demonstrate the likelihood that the speculative
bubble of the 1990s had been exacerbated by Wall Street analysts'
growing tendency to cheerlead and reluctance to downgrade companies
whose stocks they themselves owned or whose investment banking
business their own firms already handled or were actually
aggressively seeking."</TE>
<TE>   Baker said the reforms will protect "unsuspecting minnows from
irresponsible and self-serving sharks."</TE>
<TE>   Some remained skeptical that the procedures would help.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be portrayed as a big deal and it will change absolutely
nothing," said Sean Ryan, head of equity research at Fulcrum Global
Partners, an independent broker in New York that does not have an
investment banking arm. Analyst conflicts are "a smelly, smelly
situation and they're just papering it over," Ryan said.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan, formerly an analyst with several major Wall Street firms,
said the proposals were "a formal procedure to address a problem that
doesn't formally exist," since investment banks rarely spell out
what's expected of analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's compensation is tied to specific deals--not formally,"
Ryan said. "It's body language. Everybody knows the price of closing
a deal is favorable coverage."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates applauded some of the proposed rules but
questioned how the NASD would enforce many of them.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Roper, head of investor protection for the Consumer
Federation of America, praised rules that would require analysts to
disclose conflicts in television and other public appearances, since
that is how many investors get ideas to buy stocks.</TE>
<TE>   But she said brokers who tout stocks to clients also should be
forced to discuss their firms' conflicts, and warnings about
conflicts should be clearly labeled in analysts' reports.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to spell it out for people because they don't get it
otherwise," Roper said.</TE>

<HD>Worker Output Rises in Quarter</HD>
<DH>Economy: Productivity grows at 3.5% annual rate signaling
possible rebound, but increase is fueled by job, hour cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Worker productivity surged in the final three months of 2001, another
signal that the economy may be emerging from recession. But the
improvement came at a price, as that rise was fueled by companies
axing jobs and employee hours at the fastest clip in a decade.</LD>
<LD>   The Labor Department reported Wednesday that productivity, or
worker output of goods and services per hour outside the farm sector,
increased at an annual rate of 3.5% from October to December. That
follows a revised 1.1% gain in the third quarter of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   "The U.S. economy has demonstrated we can achieve remarkable
productivity under the most difficult circumstances," Treasury
Secretary Paul H. O'Neill told the House Budget Committee.</LD>
<TE>   Economists say the gains were particularly impressive coming in a
recession, when efficiency typically slides because workers have less
to do. But productivity has held up surprisingly well during this
downturn. After falling 0.1% in the first three months of the year,
productivity growth has been in positive territory for three straight
quarters.</TE>
<TE>   That has boosted optimism that the trend can continue, though
probably not at the sizzling pace of the most recent quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "The [3.5% increase] was higher than expected ... and can't be
sustained," said Sung Won Sohn, the Minneapolis-based chief economist
of Wells Fargo &amp; Co. "But it's the foundation for future economic
growth."</TE>
<TE>   Productivity gains are critical for increasing the nation's
standard of living. When productivity rises, employers can afford to
pay higher wages because they are producing more with less.</TE>
<TE>   Growing productivity also helps relieve inflationary pressures
because output can grow without straining resources.</TE>
<TE>   But rising productivity in the last few quarters hasn't been good
news for hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers who have had their
hours cut or jobs eliminated. Part of the reason the productivity
numbers have remained buoyant is because companies responded quickly
to slumping sales, cutting worker hours faster than they reduced
production.</TE>
<TE>   Worker hours in the fourth quarter fell at a 3.7% rate, the
steepest drop since the fourth quarter of 1991. By comparison, output
fell at a 0.4% rate. More than 1 million U.S. workers have lost their
jobs since the recession began in March of last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the dark underbelly of productivity," said economist Rajeev
Dhawan, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State
University. "We've been seeing a situation where productivity is
rising, but demand is falling, [worker] hours are falling and people
are getting laid off .... It's a mixed bag."</TE>
<TE>   Dhawan said it may be months before companies feel good enough
about the economy's direction to begin hiring again. Still, he said
continued strength in the productivity numbers bodes well for the
future.</TE>
<TE>   "It tells me that the fundamentals of the economy are still
strong," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For 2001, nonfarm business productivity rose 1.8%. That's the
weakest showing since 1995, and well below the 3.3% gain posted in
2000. It's not far off the 2% average annual productivity recorded
between 1990 and 2001, and well above the 1.4% annual average logged
from 1979 to 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has expressed optimism
that the solid productivity gains achieved through heavy investment
in information technology over the last decade can persist, even
though businesses have slashed investment in computers and equipment.</TE>
<TE>   During testimony last month before the Senate Budget Committee, he
expressed confidence that the gains in the 1990s weren't a fluke.</TE>
<TE>   "I think productivity gains will continue, certainly in the excess
of what they did in the quarter century prior to 1995," Greenspan
said.</TE>
<TE>   The rise in productivity in the fourth quarter helped to moderate
unit labor costs, a closely watched gauge of inflation. Unit labor
costs rose 3.9% last year, the biggest annual rise since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "With productivity holding up and labor costs under control, the
prospects for a recovery of both the economy and profits look good,"
said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.</TE>

<HD>Enron Kept Crucial Information From Auditors, Memo
Discloses</HD>
<DH>Energy: Discovery of documents by Anderson led it to tell
the company it had to restate earnings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK and JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. executives withheld several crucial financial documents
from its auditors at Andersen for four years, misleading the
accounting firm into approving inaccurate financial reports,
according to an internal Andersen memo acquired by The Times.</LD>
<LD>   Soon after the auditors discovered the documents, according to the
memo, they advised Enron that it would have to restate its earnings
from 1997 through 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Even after Andersen officials finally learned the contents of the
documents, Enron attorneys made a last-ditch attempt in meetings with
their auditors to head off the financial reckoning.</LD>
<TE>   The restatement, announced Nov. 8, reduced the company's reported
earnings over the period by more than $500 million--a step that
ultimately led to the energy company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing
Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   The internal memo, written Nov. 2 by Thomas H. Bauer, an Andersen
auditor assigned to Enron, covers the accounting treatment of two
Enron subsidiaries known as JEDI and Chewco. It hints at the lengths
to which Enron officials went to conceal important financial
information about the subsidiaries from its auditors and, by
extension, its investors.</TE>
<TE>   After the auditors saw the documents for the first time in
November, the memo reveals, Enron lawyers spent two days meeting with
them in an attempt to minimize their significance, at one point
proposing an argument so elaborate that Bauer "could not comprehend"
it.</TE>
<TE>   The memo by Bauer is one of the few pieces of evidence yet to
emerge that supports the auditing firm's contention that it was
misled by its client.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Dorton, a spokesman for Andersen, on Wednesday called the
memo "just another chunk of evidence that demonstrates Enron withheld
critical information from Andersen regarding Chewco." He declined to
comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the memo falls well short of absolving Andersen from the
raft of accusations of errors and lapses of judgment laid against the
firm by congressional investigators, professional observers and, most
recently, a special investigative committee of Enron's board, which
issued its highly critical report on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The memo covers only one of countless suspect transactions on
which Andersen consulted for Enron. It also fails to resolve whether
Andersen overlooked any other indications of the real relationship
tying JEDI and Chewco to Enron over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Bauer will testify today before the House Commerce Committee,
which is investigating the Enron collapse. "He's cooperating with the
committee, he's met with the committee," said his attorney, Scott
Schreiber of the Washington law firm Arnold &amp; Porter. Bauer remains
an Andersen partner but has been placed on administrative leave.</TE>
<TE>   JEDI, which stands for Joint Energy Development Investments, was
formed in 1993 as a $500-million joint venture between Enron and the
California Public Employee Retirement System. Thanks to an accounting
technicality, JEDI was treated as an unconsolidated subsidiary of
Enron, meaning its assets and liabilities were not reported as part
of Enron's financial results. Debt JEDI incurred on Enron's behalf
stayed off the Enron books, allowing Enron to maintain a higher
credit rating than it might otherwise have deserved. JEDI's earnings,
however, were reported in Enron's results.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1997, when CalPERS sought to withdraw from the
partnership, Enron formed Chewco to purchase the CalPERS interest.
The new entity was placed under the management of Michael Kopper, an
Enron employee reporting to Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's chief financial
officer. As the special board committee later contended, Kopper and
his domestic partner invested $125,000 in the partnership and reaped
a windfall of $10.5 million in fees and investment returns.</TE>
<TE>   Under accounting rules, at least 3% of Chewco's capital had to be
owned by an independent investor in order to continue to keep Chewco
and JEDI off Enron's books. That investor had to have equity at
risk--meaning that if Chewco had $100 million in capital, an outside
investor had to own at least $3 million of its equity.</TE>
<TE>   Because Enron could not find an equity investor to take that role,
according to the special committee, it resorted to financial
subterfuge. Chewco borrowed $11.4 million from Barclays Bank in a way
that made the loans appear to be equity investments, thus satisfying
the 3% rule. In fact, Chewco guaranteed $6.6 million of the loans
with a cash reserve, meaning that less than $5 million was truly at
risk. As the special committee observed in its report, the
$6.6-million collateral "was fatal to Chewco's compliance with the 3%
equity requirement." The key evidence of its existence was a Dec. 30,
1997, letter from JEDI to Chewco documenting the $6.6-million
transfer.</TE>
<TE>   An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the Bauer memo, noting
the matter had been covered in the special committee's report. That
report noted that many Enron executives involved in Chewco and JEDI,
including Kopper, whose signature appears on the transfer letter,
"profess no recollection of the Barclays funding."</TE>
<TE>   The report also said it found evidence that Andersen was aware at
least that the transfer had taken place. Bauer's memo indicates that
even if that were so, the auditors did not realize until later that
the transfer was collateral for the Barclays loan. Bauer's memo
indicates that Andersen auditors remained unaware of the letter until
Nov. 2, when they received it and several other documents from the
law firm assisting the special committee.</TE>
<TE>   By then the Enron board was aware of the letter and its
implications. On Oct. 26, Bauer reported, he received a call from two
Enron executives asking for a clarification of the 3% rule and
hinting that Chewco might have failed to meet it.</TE>
<TE>   Only after the special committee's lawyers provided the letter to
the auditors Nov. 2, however, did Bauer and his colleagues understand
the scope of the problem. At a meeting with Enron executives that
night, the Andersen team hinted they believed the Chewco accounting
was flawed. If Enron disagreed, Bauer told them, "we would like to
have a discussion as to the basis of their conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   At a second meeting the next day, Bauer's memo relates, Andersen
laid out several problems with the Chewco accounting, including the
investment by Barclays and Kopper. Because Kopper was an Enron
employee, Bauer noted, his $125,000 investment could not be counted
as part of the 3% threshold.</TE>
<TE>   Several Enron attorneys and executives tried strenuously to
assuage auditors' concerns. They also insisted they never had the
Dec. 30, 1997, letter in their possession. Andersen "assisted the
group with a search of the documents in the room" and promptly turned
it up.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Enron team also observed that Koppers' interest had
been transferred to William Dodson. Dodson was Koppers' domestic
partner, but Enron contended that he should be considered an outside
investor because Texas law did not recognize same-sex relationships.
Bauer found that a dubious argument, noting that the "legal factor"
was only one of several factors to be considered.</TE>
<TE>   Before the day was out the Enron team acknowledged the document
made a critical difference. Within days, Enron disclosed publicly it
had improperly accounted for JEDI and Chewco and dramatically
restated its earnings.</TE>

<HD>Global Eased Loan Terms</HD>
<DH>Compensation: The firm forgave or reduced advances to
executives in the months before its Chapter 11 filing.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. eliminated or substantially reduced the terms of
$18 million worth of personal loans the company made to two of its
top executives in the months before the telecommunications company
filed for bankruptcy protection, regulatory filings show.</LD>
<LD>   In October, the company agreed to erase the $10-million balance of
a $15-million loan made to Chief Executive John Legere. And in
August, Global Crossing significantly eased the terms of an
$8-million loan made to former CEO Thomas Casey. If Casey remains
with Global Crossing, the entire loan will be forgiven, according to
a regulatory filing.</LD>
<LD>   Many large firms make--and then forgive--loans to high-level
executives. But they have been criticized as excessive and
unnecessary by compensation experts.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, the size of the Global Crossing loans and the timing
of their erasure are not likely to sit well with the bankers,
creditors and shareholders who collectively stand to lose billions of
dollars because of Global Crossing's bankruptcy, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "I consider it really appalling," said Nell Minnow, editor of the
Corporate Library, which tracks compensation trends. "I would say
[Global Crossing] is in the top 20% of outrageousness."</TE>
<TE>   Bermuda-based Global Crossing, whose executive offices are in
Beverly Hills, did not disclose the purpose of the loans and declined
to answer questions about them Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Legere was granted a $15-million loan by Global Crossing's
affiliate, Asia Global Crossing, when he joined that company as chief
executive in February 2000. The loan was intended to be forgiven from
the outset but over three years in increments of $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   When Legere moved to Global Crossing, $10 million of the loan
remained, with the next $5 million deduction set for October of this
year. Instead, the firm erased the balance and noted that in
regulatory paperwork filed in December.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Legere received a $3.5-million bonus and a
$1.1-million annual salary for jumping to Global Crossing. Global
owns 59% of Asia Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Casey was lured to Global Crossing from an executive job at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in November 2000 with a lucrative compensation
package. It included an $8-million loan that was secured by Casey's
home and carried an interest rate of 6.01%--several percentage points
below market rates.</TE>
<TE>   But in August, Global Crossing gave Casey back the deed to his
house, reduced the interest rate to zero and pledged to forgive the
entire amount in yearly increments of $2.6 million as long as he
remained employed by the company or an affiliate. Two months later,
he was ousted as CEO and named vice chairman and a director. Casey
has since left the company, and the status of his loan is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Minnow, the compensation expert, said large loans to executives
are growing more common, and that corporations frequently add a
provision to "gross up" the payment amount to cover any taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "I call that the Leona Helmsley provision, because what that means
is that only the little people pay taxes," Minnow said.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing has been singled out before for awarding its
executives excessive pay and perks.</TE>
<TE>   Former CEO Robert Annunziata worked for Global Crossing for 13
months. He received a $10-million cash bonus, a guaranteed annual
bonus of $500,000, a $5-million loan to buy company stock, and
options to buy 2 million shares of Global Crossing at $10 below
market prices. His contract also included a Mercedes and monthly
first-class trips to shuttle his family--including his
mother--between his Los Angeles and New Jersey homes.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing has come under fire in recent days for a series of
moves preceding its Jan. 28 bankruptcy filing, the fifth-largest in
U.S. history, with assets of $22.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Company executives did not disclose to either its outside auditor,
Andersen, or to its board a letter from a former finance vice
president warning that Global Crossing's accounting methods were
misleading because they had the effect of inflating revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The letter has attracted the interest of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that the
FBI also is looking into the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The bankruptcy also has put the spotlight on company executives
who sold $1.3 billion worth of Global Crossing stock over the last
three years.</TE>
<TE>   Global's stock, once part of the S&amp;P 500 index, now trades over
the counter. It closed Wednesday at 8 cents, down 2 cents.</TE>

<HD>NASA Seeks $1 Billion for Nuclear Propulsion Plan</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Space agency will take a new look at developing
technology, which foes fear would be used by military.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a 30-year hiatus, government rocket scientists want to
resurrect efforts to design a nuclear-powered propulsion system, a
controversial concept crucial to any program for human exploration of
the solar system.</LD>
<LD>   A $125-million initiative for developing the technology, which has
frustrated scientists and engineers since the 1950s, was quietly
inserted into the proposed fiscal 2003 NASA budget, which was
unveiled this week. The space agency's plan calls for a $1-billion
program over five years, a project that would include significant
roles for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Glenn Research
Center in Cleveland and Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,
Ala.</LD>
<LD>   The agency spent 13 years and more than $10 billion before
concluding that the technology was not technically feasible and
abandoned the effort in 1972.</LD>
<TE>   NASA scientists now hope that advances in nuclear reactors and
rocket propulsion systems as well as lessons learned from past
failures will give the quest for a nuclear rocket new life in the
21st century.</TE>
<TE>   Such spaceships would have small nuclear reactors, which would
give the engines greater thrust and virtually unlimited fuel supply
to travel to the farthest reaches of the solar system.</TE>
<TE>   Using nuclear technology would in theory slash a trip to Mars and
back by more than half from about two years to less than a year, for
instance, and alleviate lingering concerns with the health effects of
long-duration space travel, NASA officials said. Astronauts who
occupied the former Soviet operated Mir space station for months at a
time suffered from muscle atrophy, bone loss and other crippling
effects of prolonged exposure to micro gravity.</TE>
<TE>   With nuclear power, "missions will be able to speed through the
outer reaches of the solar system, at speeds as much as two times
faster than is possible even with the most sophisticated space probes
available today," NASA officials said in its budget proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The technology will "allow NASA to consider more ambitious
possibilities involving missions that could travel from one
interesting planet, moon or comet to another for a close-up, in-depth
study."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed initiative was lauded by astronauts and astronomers
but slammed by antinuclear activists.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcome the proposal to develop nuclear power and propulsion
technology to make the entire solar system more accessible with much
shorter flight-times and more powerful investigations of the
planets," said Wesley T. Huntress Jr.,  president of the Planetary
Society. "These developments will revolutionize space exploration in
the same way that the Navy was revolutionized by nuclear power."</TE>
<TE>   But Bruce Gagnon, secretary for the Global Network Against Weapons
&amp; Nuclear Power in Space, said that in addition to potential health
concerns from radiation exposure, the NASA initiative represents the
Bush administration's covert move to develop power systems for
space-based weapons such as lasers on satellites.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our position that just like missile defense is a Trojan
horse for the Pentagon's real agenda for domination of space, NASA's
nuclear rocket is a Trojan horse for militarization of space," Gagnon
said.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Savage, a NASA spokesman, dismissed the argument.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a solar system exploration program," he said. "This is a
scientific program and that's what we are involved in."</TE>
<TE>   Still, sensitive to the criticism and safety concerns, NASA
officials stressed that the nuclear propulsion systems envisioned by
the agency would be used only for traveling through space outside
Earth's orbit. They would not be used for launching rockets into
space.</TE>
<TE>   In one possible scenario, the spacecraft would be assembled in
space and the reactors would be turned on only after leaving Earth's
orbit. The reactor and other components would be ferried into space
by conventional rockets that use chemicals such as hydrogen and
oxygen for combustion.</TE>
<TE>   Under the so-called Nuclear Systems Initiative, NASA proposes
funding three programs including developing nuclear power systems to
power on-board equipment such as sensors to survey planets and
instruments to control the craft and communicate with Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Another major element would be to develop a nuclear propulsion
system that would use a small nuclear reactor to generate electricity
and propel ionized or plasma gas out of the rocket nozzle to provide
thrust. The reactor would produce enough heat to generate electricity
and ionized gas.</TE>
<TE>   One advantage of a nuclear propulsion system is that it can
generate significantly more energy for almost unlimited duration
compared with a conventional chemical combustion engine. A soft-drink
can full of uranium, for instance, yields 50 times the energy
contained in the Space Shuttle's massive external tank, according to
NASA.</TE>
<TE>   The reactor would be co-developed with the Department of Energy,
which has been looking for ways to maintain its know-how in nuclear
power development.</TE>
<TE>   More immediately, NASA envisions manufacturing new radioisotope
thermoelectric generators that would provide power for long-duration
exploration of Mars.</TE>
<TE>   The system would allow the Mars Smart Lander, scheduled for launch
in 2009, to scout sites for future missions.</TE>
<TE>   It would be able to operate on the surface for years instead of
months. The currently available solar cell system would become
obscured by dust from the planet's atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   NASA officials said a small, rudimentary nuclear electric
propulsion system has been used on exploratory spacecraft such as
Deep Space One to help propel it in conjunction with solar panels.
But such systems would not be sufficient for the kind of missions
envisioned for the future.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, developing nuclear powered rockets has been a
frustrating endeavor and has remained in the realm of artist's
conceptual drawings.</TE>
<TE>   It has not been for lack of trying, however. Even American rocket
pioneer Robert Goddard concluded as far back as in 1907 that nuclear
propulsion would be essential to interplanetary exploration.</TE>
<TE>   Emboldened by how nuclear subs revolutionized naval warfare,
aerospace engineers began pursuing nuclear propulsion for rockets in
earnest in the 1950s. And in 1959, NASA, with the then-Atomic Energy
Commission, began a program to develop a nuclear rocket. Known as the
Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Applications, the program
eventually built and tested 20 nuclear-reactor rocket engines. The
engines never produced the kind of thrust they had hoped for,
however.</TE>

<PH>THE FALL OF ENRON</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>Enron Lawyer's Qualms Detailed in New Memos</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON, EDMUND SANDERS and WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congressional investigators Wednesday released memos by Enron Corp.
legal counsel Jordan Mintz citing concerns over the company's
controversial partnerships dating back more than a year--again
raising questions about why company executives ignored early
warnings.</LD>
<LD>   Mintz's concerns about the off-the-books partnerships were
reported last week, but the memos released Wednesday provide new
details about specific issues he raised.</LD>
<LD>   In a Jan. 4, 2001, memo, for example, Mintz pointed to the need to
develop measures to ensure that deals between Enron and the LJM
partnership led by then-Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S.
Fastow were conducted at "arms-length," given the potential for
"sweetheart" deals.</LD>
<TE>   Similar themes were sounded in follow-up memos March 8 and May 22,
months before problems with the partnerships spilled into public view
and corporate officers acknowledged problems.</TE>
<TE>   In the March 8 memo to Richard A. Causey, Enron's chief accounting
officer, and Richard B. Buy, Enron's chief risk officer, Mintz called
for a new deal approval process to "impose a more rigorous testing of
the fairness and benefits realized by Enron in transacting with LJM."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigation, said the memos
detail the "incestuous connections between the LJM entities and
Enron."</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty blanket evidence that well-placed people in the
company knew that Fastow was the architect of deals that were
questionable at best and may be illegal," Greenwood said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron representatives did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said that Mintz told them he took his concerns to
Causey and Buy but that they took no action.</TE>
<TE>   Mintz also talked directly to Jeffrey K. Skilling, at the time
Enron's president, according to investigators, reminding him that he
needed to sign an approval sheet for Enron transactions with the LJM
partnership.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone signed off but Skilling. Not only did he not sign, but
he repeatedly refused to," Greenwood said. "Mintz tried to set up a
meeting with Skilling three times to get him to sign."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce
Committee: "Skilling never signed off on any of the partnership
papers that we have in our possession. It appears to us that he tried
to keep his fingerprints off these transactions."</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear to us that he was very concerned about the impact the
partnerships were having on Enron's financial stability," Johnson
said. "He was sending up red flags and nobody seemed to be
listening."</TE>
<TE>   Enron filed for the largest bankruptcy in U.S. corporate history
Dec. 2, after questions about its underlying financial health and
accounting practices sent its stock plunging. The off-the-books
partnerships have received special attention in the various
investigations into the company's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   At hearings today in Washington, lawmakers are expected to turn up
the heat on some of the company's mid-level executives and the
friends and family members of top officers, who are believed to have
reaped rich profits from the off-the-books partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the relationships are detailed in the 203-page report by a
special Enron board investigating committee released Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In one cited example of conflicts of interest, Anne Yaeger and
Trushar Patel--Enron employees engaged to be married--represented
opposite sides in a deal between Enron and one of the so-called
Raptor partnerships. According to the internal report, Yaeger was one
of those who earned a windfall profit by receiving shares in another
partnership, Southampton Place.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for the couple said Yaeger's shares in Southampton
were part of a promised bonus, not part of her work on the Raptor
deal.</TE>
<TE>   "These were junior people in a finance function," said Bruce
Baird, their attorney. "They took instructions from their superiors."</TE>
<TE>   Another Enron employee, Michael Kopper, who worked in the global
finance group, had roles in several partnerships, including one
called Chewco Investments, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow originally planned to run Chewco himself but decided
against it after being told that he would have to disclose his
participation to shareholders, according to the report. Fastow also
planned for his wife's family to invest in Chewco until Skilling
nixed the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow then tapped Kopper to run Chewco because that could be kept
hidden, even from Enron's board of directors, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The report indicates that Kopper also took steps to conceal his
role. At one point, he transferred a Chewco ownership interest to
William D. Dodson, whom the report called Kopper's domestic partner.</TE>
<TE>   Chewco was extremely lucrative for Kopper. Though he invested only
$125,000, Kopper was paid $10.5 million when Enron bought out Chewco
in March 2001. He was paid $1.6 million in management fees even
though Chewco "apparently required little management," the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Fastow declined to comment. Kopper could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Mintz, today's hearing before Greenwood's
subcommittee will feature several key players in the Enron saga,
including Skilling, Fastow, Kopper and Robert K. Jaedicke, an Enron
board member and chairman of the board's audit committee.</TE>
<TE>   Also scheduled to testify are Causey, Buy and Jeffrey McMahon, the
former Enron treasurer and current chief operating officer.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the participants, including Fastow, Kopper, Causey and
Buy, are expected to invoke their 5th Amendment right against
self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   By increasing scrutiny of the subordinates of former Chairman
Kenneth L. Lay, Skilling and particularly Fastow, congressional
investigators also may be attempting to pressure the mid-level
workers to begin cooperating in the inquiry by testifying against
their former bosses, one former congressional investigator said.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Fall for 4th Straight Trading Day</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Investors struggle with fears of rising
bankruptcies, accounting accuracy. S&amp;P close is lowest since Oct. 31.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks fell for the fourth straight session Wednesday as Wall Street
struggled with fears of rising bankruptcies and the accuracy of
corporate bookkeeping.</LD>
<LD>   "The monsters have been earnings disappointments, terrorists, now
accounting," said Scott Vergin, a fund manager for the Lutheran
Brotherhood, a money management firm in Minneapolis. "In this
environment, it's easy to lose ground and hard to make it up so you
try and prevent disasters" by being cautious.</LD>
<LD>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index lost 6.51 points, or 0.6%, to
1,083.51--its lowest close since Oct. 31. The technology-laden Nasdaq
composite index dropped 25.81 points, or 1.4%, to 1,812.71. That's
its lowest close since Nov. 5.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average lost 32.04 points, or 0.3%, to
9,653.39, its lowest close since Jan. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Almost two stocks fell for every one that rose on Nasdaq, while
decliners trounced advancers by 19 to 11 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Volume was heavy.</TE>
<TE>   Even an upbeat profit outlook from networking giant Cisco Systems
and Tyco International's insistence it isn't facing a cash crunch
couldn't buoy the market.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco after the close reported that its quarterly profit fell by
more than half but still topped expectations, signaling corporate
spending on technology may be turning around. Its shares fell to
$17.22 in after-hours trading after closing at $18.61, up 11 cents in
regular trading.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco, meanwhile, rebounded from big losses Monday and Tuesday to
gain $2.82 to $25.92.</TE>
<TE>   VeriSign was the latest company to be slammed by accounting fears.
The computer security and Web address provider dropped $2.52 to
$23.93 amid investor concerns about possible accounting issues
related to minority investments, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom and other telecom stocks continued their recent decline.
WorldCom has lost more than half its value this year as the
beleaguered telecommunications sector has faltered under high debt
levels and on fears about its quarterly earnings, expected today.
WorldCom, the most active issue on Nasdaq the last seven sessions,
fell 28 cents to $6.69 on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Bankruptcies in the telecom industry and downbeat results or
outlooks from rivals AT&amp;T and Sprint Group also have hurt WorldCom
shares.</TE>
<TE>   "Many stocks are caught up in a cloud of uncertainty that is
impacting them day after day," said Alan Ackerman of brokerage
Fahnestock &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T shares lost 67 cents to $15.60, while Sprint dropped $1.19 to

<HD>Moody's, S&amp;P Seek Greater Disclosure of Trading Deals</HD>
<DH>Credit: The rating companies ask firms to tell of debt
risks that could trigger repayment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two biggest rating companies, embarrassed by their failure to
anticipate the collapse of Enron Corp., are demanding companies
disclose credit and trading agreements.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's are sending e-mail
questionnaires to about 800 companies seeking the details of
contracts that can force them to immediately pay obligations.
Regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission,
currently don't demand reporting of such repayment triggers.</LD>
<LD>   Worries that other firms have unreported debts and may have
misstated earnings have contributed to a 6% drop in Nasdaq this week.
The failure of the rating firms to warn of the problems drew a rebuke
from SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt.</LD>
<TE>   "Clearly, it seems like the market needs better disclosure," said
Clifford Griep, chief credit officer at S&amp;P.</TE>
<TE>   The rating companies are focusing on clauses--in bank credit
lines, derivative contracts and third-party trading
agreements--typically linked to credit ratings, earnings or share
prices. Companies agree to put up collateral, pay back debt or
forfeit access to credit lines if any of these triggers fall below an
agreed level.</TE>
<TE>   Enron, once the seventh-biggest company in the U.S., had borrowing
agreements that required instant repayment of $3.9 billion in debt
once its credit ratings fell below investment grade.</TE>
<TE>   In the months before Enron's failure, investors in companies
including Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., Southern California Edison Co.
and Xerox Corp. were blindsided by ratings drops related to triggers
in companies' credit agreements.</TE>
<TE>   Now, S&amp;P is "contacting every investment grade company we rate,"
said Griep. The companies say they are acting separately.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt told Congress this week that the ratings companies were too
slow to react to Enron's collapse. The SEC may propose tighter
federal oversight of rating companies.</TE>
<TE>   The rating companies have begun to emphasize faster disclosure.
Moody's, for instance, required only 38 days on average to cut
ratings in the fourth quarter, down from an average of 90 days.</TE>
<TE>   If companies have too many conditions on their loans, derivative
products and other deals, their ratings will be cut to reflect added
risk, the rating companies said.</TE>
<TE>   "The presence of rating triggers will take on higher profile in
our analysis of credit risk and liquidity," Moody's spokeswoman Fran
Laserson said in an e-mail. "We will incorporate the serious negative
consequences of those triggers in our ratings and research."</TE>
<TE>   Halliburton Co. already felt pressure from the ratings companies.
Moody's cut its ratings Jan. 23, citing in part the presence of
ratings stipulations in credit deals.</TE>
<TE>   Halliburton, the second-biggest oil services provider, has clauses
in its $700 million of credit lines that demand the company retain an
investment-grade rating. If the rating falls to junk, banks will deem
it in default.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's cited that clause as a reason for cutting the firm's
rating to "Baa2" from "A3." Moody's said the ratings, two levels
above junk, may be cut further.</TE>

<HD>Cisco Profit Falls 24% on Spending Slowdown</HD>
<DH>Communications: The Internet equipment maker's
second-quarter results exceed analysts' forecasts even as its
customers cut costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Cisco Systems Inc. said Wednesday that its fiscal second-quarter
profit fell 24% because of the communications spending slowdown. But
the results were almost twice what analysts had expected as the
company signaled that spending by some of its large corporate
customers may have hit bottom.</LD>
<LD>   Cisco, the largest maker of equipment that powers the Internet,
said earnings before special items fell to $664 million, or 9 cents a
share, from $1.3 billion, or 18 cents, in the year-earlier quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts had expected Cisco to report earnings of 5 cents, with a
range of 5 cents to 7 cents, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue in the quarter ended Jan. 26 fell 29% to $4.8 billion, but
far exceeded analysts' forecasts of $4.55 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco jumped the gun on much of its second-quarter surprise
because of an e-mail sent late Tuesday by an executive to some
employees telling them what the company would report. The company
issued an announcement early in the day that its results would
surpass Wall Street expectations, without giving details.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco said the e-mail to the employees was sent inadvertently by
an executive it did not identify.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation Fair
Disclosure rule approved two years ago, companies are barred from
first telling stock analysts, big investors and other individuals
about company events, giving them time to trade before smaller
stockholders get the news.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Cisco rose in after hours trade to $19.31 but then
dropped to $17.22. The stock had closed up 11 cents at $18.61 on
Nasdaq before the earnings report was released. Chief Executive John
Chambers said on a conference call that orders weren't coming in as
fast as Cisco was shipping products. Third-quarter revenue will be
unchanged or rise by a "very low single-digit" percentage from the
previous period, Chief Financial Officer Larry Carter said.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have limited visibility over the short term," Chambers
said, citing "conservatism" in customers' hiring and
computer-equipment budgets. "Traditionally the third quarter has been
a seasonally challenging one for Cisco."</TE>
<TE>   Cisco said last November that second-quarter sales would be flat
to up in the single-digit percentage point range from the $4.45
billion posted in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Net income for the quarter including one-time items was
$660million, or 9 cents a share, down from $874million, or 12 cents,
a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Other earnings, excluding one-time items, include:</TE>
<TE>   * Allstate Corp. said fourth-quarter operating profit fell 36% to
$379 million, or 53 cents a share, better than the 46 cents analysts
expected. The results exclude one-time costs for restructuring, a
lawsuit settlement with Georgia policyholders and other items.</TE>
<TE>   * Cendant Corp. said fourth-quarter earnings from operations grew
39% to $232 million, or 23 cents a share, exceeding analysts'
forecasts of 21 cents, aided by its mortgage and travel service
businesses and by recent acquisitions. Revenue more than doubled to
$2.58 billion from $1.17 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * PepsiCo Inc. reported a 16% rise in fourth-quarter profit to
$764million, or 42 cents a share, boosted by newer drinks such as
Aquafina bottled water and its core snack brands. The results, which
exclude such special items as costs associated with the acquisition
of Quaker Oats, met Wall Street estimates. Revenue edged up 1.5% to
$7.99 billion, as sales of Gatorade fell slightly amid "intense
competitive pressure."</TE>
<TE>   * Sonicblue Inc. reported an operating loss of $6.8 million, or 7
cents a share, beating forecasts of a 9-cent loss, as it continued a
transformation from graphics chips to digital audio and video devices
for consumers. Revenue was down 20% from a year ago to $79.6 million,
but was up from the previous quarter and substantially higher than
the $58 million Wall Street expected.</TE>

<HD>DaimlerChrysler Slices Earnings Target in Half</HD>
<DH>Autos: Dividend will be cut 57% as company faces weakening
demand. News sends U.S. shares down 2.6%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LYSAGHT</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>STUTTGART, Germany</DL>
<LD>DaimlerChrysler, confronting weakened demand for cars and trucks, cut
this year's earnings target by about half and pared its dividend,
sending its shares down as much as 7% in Germany.</LD>
<LD>   Operating profit in 2002 will be "a very significant amount" above
2.6 billion euros, or $2.3 billion, compared with a previous forecast
of as much as 6.5 billion euros, the car maker said. The dividend
will be cut 57% to 1 euro a share.</LD>
<LD>   DaimlerChrysler shares fell 97 cents to $37.01, or 2.6%, in the
U.S. in New York Stock Exchange trading after closing down 4.3% in
Germany.</LD>
<TE>   The maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, Chrysler Dodge cars and
Freightliner and Mercedes heavy trucks will not reach profit targets
because of "a weaker economic and market environment," it said in a
statement to the Frankfurt stock exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll get further disappointments," said Peter Braendle, who
manages $1.8 billion at Swissca Portfolio Management in Zurich and
sold DaimlerChrysler shares Wednesday. "I don't believe their
restructuring in the U.S. will be as smooth and easy as they're
telling us."</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Juergen Schrempp is shutting six car plants and
cutting 26,000 jobs at the unprofitable Chrysler car unit, as demand
falls by as much as 15%. He's also cutting 2,700 jobs at the
Freightliner truck unit in the U.S. and closing as many as three
factories.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. car division's market share dropped to 13.2% in 2001 from
14.5% the year before as its Dodge Ram pickup trucks and Jeep Grand
Cherokee sport-utilities lost sales to Honda Motor Co., Toyota Motor
Corp. and others.</TE>
<TE>   The company said 2001 net income excluding one-time items was 700
million euros, or 73 cents a share, compared with income of 3.5
billion euros, or 3.47 euros a share, in the year-earlier period.</TE>

<HD>Fraud Suspect May Have Had Help</HD>
<DH>Securities: Experts say Allfirst trader's ability to
conceal $750 million in losses raises possibility of colleagues'
involvement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL ADAMS</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How a low-level currency trader for Allied Irish Banks was able to
bury $750 million in losses without detection is a mystery to bank
analysts and those who make their living in the trade.</LD>
<LD>   With more than a trillion dollars changing hands every day, major
financial institutions have multilayered systems in place to track
profits and losses, as well as suspicious trading activity. What
insiders don't catch, auditors are supposed to discover during
routine checks of every trader's books.</LD>
<LD>   At Allied Irish's Allfirst Financial Inc. unit, the system broke
down, raising the possibility that John Michael Rusnak had help when
he allegedly hid massive losses on currency trades in a flurry of
fictitious options contracts, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't conceive of a way a person could do it without help,"
said Christopher Blum, a financial-services analyst with Edward
Jones. "It's hard to do, and that's why it doesn't happen very often.
Usually, the (internal) policies work."</TE>
<TE>   Bank officials, too, were shocked by the failure of its internal
controls.</TE>
<TE>   "We are staggered by the amount of this loss," said Frank P.
Bramble, chairman of Allfirst Financial Inc. and chief executive of
Allied Irish Bank's U.S. operations. Bramble said the loss occurred
in an "isolated" area of the bank "by an individual who found a way
to crack our internal control systems."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the trading of stocks and bonds, currency trades are not as
heavily scrutinized by government watchdogs such as the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   But financial institutions that engage in risky trades usually
keep a close eye on their traders, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   In most instances, a trader's profit-and-loss record is tracked
throughout the day.</TE>
<TE>   Any anomalies are checked by a financial institution's internal
regulators. Job functions are split up to increase oversight, and
jobs are often rotated, making it difficult to hide suspicious
activity.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, banks typically utilize background checks, employee
fingerprinting and other methods of detecting employee fraud,
according to the American Banking Assn., an industry trade group.</TE>
<TE>   When those controls fail, both internal and external auditors
hired by the company should uncover phony trades.</TE>
<TE>   "There are usually control mechanisms in place and other people
who typically review these types of trades," said Alex Beuzelin, a
senior market analyst with Ruesch International, a Washington-based
currency trading company. "While entering fictitious trades could for
a while mask those losses, you have to imagine that they would
eventually be caught. It just took longer [in this case] than one
would expect."</TE>
<TE>   Rusnak's suspicious trades took place over 12 months, Allied
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   As a currency trader, Rusnak tried to make money by betting that a
certain country's currency would rise or fall against another
currency over a specific period of time. Such traders tend to work in
obscurity, rarely capturing the spotlight in financial circles.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, currency speculators will hedge their position on the
spot market with option contracts, which give the trader the option
to buy or sell a currency at a certain price in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, losses arising from trades in the spot market would be at
least partly offset by profits arising from options contracts. It's
pretty standard practice in the industry, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   But in Rusnak's case, the options contracts were fictitious,
according to officers at Allied. Bank officials allege that he forged
options purchases to conceal the losses.</TE>
<TE>   Given the dollar amount involved, experts said Rusnak should have
had a difficult time concealing his losses from Allfirst's internal
regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Trades of that magnitude would dwarf the entire trading limit of
many large currency trading operations, sounding internal alarms at
most institutions.</TE>
<TE>   "If they [the fictitious trades] didn't appear on the corporate
balance sheet, that should raise a red flag," said Matthew Snowling,
a bank analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   But if a trader has help from a colleague, uncovering the fraud
becomes more complicated. Allied officials raised the possibility
Wednesday that Rusnak had assistance, but said they have no evidence
of collusion. The company is conducting an internal investigation.</TE>

<HD>Tyco Shares Go Up as Exec Tries to Reassure Investors</HD>
<DH>Securities: CEO says the conglomerate faces a crisis in
confidence but not a crisis in reality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL LAYNE</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>EXETER, N.H.</DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd., roiled by concerns that the company's
accounting hasn't been transparent, on Wednesday altered its breakup
plan and provided assurances the conglomerate isn't facing a cash
crunch.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Dennis Kozlowski canceled a share sale for Tyco's
finance unit and said he would consider buyout offers for all its
businesses. The company expects to announce a buyer for its plastics
group by April and may delay initial public offerings of the
healthcare and fire protection and industrial divisions that are
scheduled to be spun off.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco shares, which had lost half of their value since the breakup
was unveiled two weeks ago, rose $2.82, or 12%, to $25.92 on the New
York Stock Exchange. Prices of Tyco's bonds climbed.</LD>
<TE>   "We are not in a panic mode," Kozlowski said on a conference call
with analysts and investors. "There is a crisis in confidence in
Tyco, but there is no crisis in reality."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, C.R. Bard Inc. said after the close of trading on the New
York Stock Exchange that it would terminate its sale to Tyco because
of the collapse of the shares.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco agreed in May to buy the medical products maker for about
$3.2 billion, or $60 in stock for each share of Bard. There isn't a
breakup fee.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco's finance costs increased and its credit ratings were
downgraded this week after Tyco drew down bank loans to repay
short-term corporate IOUs. Tyco Capital, which is reassuming the CIT
brand name, may be hampered from making loans unless it separates
quickly from Tyco, investors said.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco wants to spin off or sell the finance unit within three
months. It had planned to sell shares before the spinoff.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski also said Tyco's profit might be as much as 45 cents a
share less than the company's $3.70 a share forecast for the fiscal
year ending Sept. 30 because of the switch to the bank loans,
slumping demand for electronics and costs associated with "internal
distractions" in the last few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Drawing down the bank lines gives us the funds we need to pay off
commercial paper and maturing debt over the next year," Kozlowski
said. "Another benefit of the bank [lines] is it makes us less
susceptible to various market rumors that we have a liquidity
issue--which we don't."</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski is reversing a strategy of growth through acquisitions
amid speculation the company used purchases to mask slowing results.
On Monday, Tyco said it had made 700 acquisitions valued at about $8
billion in the last three years that weren't fully disclosed to the
public. Tyco plans to file more detailed information with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and issue statements about every
purchase if requested.</TE>

<HD>Goodyear's Replacement Plan Faulty, Groups Say</HD>
<DH>Autos: The company is under fire from safety advocates who say the
replaced model suspected of being prone to tread failures should have
been recalled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Consumer safety advocates assailed Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. on
Wednesday, saying the tire maker's replacement of 200,000 tires suspected
of being prone to tread failures falls far short of what is needed to
protect motorists.</LD>
<LD>  Goodyear announced last week that it would replace about 200,000
heavy-duty tires sold mainly on 15-passenger vans and ambulances in the
wake of a federal investigation into accidents caused by tread
separations that left at least 11 people dead.</LD>
<LD>  The tire maker is replacing 16-inch tires known as Load Range E made
from 1996 to 2000, after which Goodyear made a design change to
strengthen the tires.</LD>
<TE>  "Incredibly, the same defective tires are not being recalled if they
are installed on vehicles other than 15-passenger vans," said Lee Jones,
executive director of Safetyforum.com, a safety advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>  Jones criticized Goodyear for replacing the tires rather than issuing a
formal recall.</TE>
<TE>  "By denying that a problem exists, they are soft-pedaling the issue,
perhaps in anticipation that it will somehow magically vanish," she said.</TE>
<TE>  Goodyear has produced about 28million Load Range E tires since the
early 1990s and maintains that the number of tires being replaced is
consistent with the problems that have arisen.</TE>
<TE>  "When you look at the numbers related to all the Load Range E tires,
there's not a safety concern," Goodyear spokesman Chuck Sinclair said.</TE>
<TE>  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has reported that
Load Range E tires have been involved in 44 injury accidents and 18
fatalities. Sinclair said there have been 15 injury accidents and 11
deaths involving 15-passenger vans and the tires.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a pretty small segment of the overall Load Range E tires. In
the remaining Load Range E tires there's not an issue," Sinclair said. "I
don't see how they can have safety concerns."</TE>
<TE>  Numerous complaints and lawsuits made Goodyear aware of tread
separation problems in 1995, Strategicsafety.com, another consumer
advocacy group, noted in a statement.</TE>
<TE>  "Goodyear is now feeling the heat as their Wrangler LT tires are under
scrutiny for tread separations problems similar to Firestone," the group
said.</TE>
<TE>  In August 2000, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., a unit of Bridgestone
Corp., recalled 6.5 million tires that showed a tendency to lose their
treads at high speeds. Ford Motor Co. said in May that it would replace
13 million more Firestones whose treads could peel off.</TE>
<TE>  Goodyear says analysis shows the Load Range E tires lost their treads
because of factors unrelated to their design: underinflation, overloading
and damage from punctures and impacts.</TE>
<TE>   "The company refuses to accept responsibility and assesses blame for
the tread separation [on] ... any reason except the correct one--the
tires were inherently defective," Safetyforum's Jones said.</TE>
<TE>  Sinclair said Goodyear believes that the tires' overall performance
attests to their reliability, noting: "The fact that more fatalities and
lawsuits have not surfaced despite the publicity is a testament to the
quality of the tires."</TE>
<TE>  With the announcement of the replacement program, NHTSA agreed to close
its investigation into Load Range E tires that it began in November 2000.
Though that practice is common in defect investigations, safety advocates
were critical.</TE>
<TE>  "When safety is being compromised and lives are threatened through the
use of defective products, there is no room for secrets or aborted
investigations or cover-ups," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   A NHTSA spokesman did not return a phone call seeking comment.</TE>

<CX>   Goodyear tire replacement--The headline on some editions of a Thursday
Business story about Goodyear tires was in error. Consumer groups did not
say that Goodyear's replacements for certain 16-inch Load Range E tires
were faulty. In fact, safety advocates were criticizing the tire maker's
plans to replace 200,000 of the heavy-duty tires rather than issue a
formal recall of all such tires on the road.</CX>

<HD>Head of Breakaway Group Defects to MTA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The head of a group of officials studying ways for the western San
Gabriel Valley to split from the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority defected Wednesday, announcing that he is leaving to take a
top position with the massive county transit agency.</LD>
<LD>   Jack Gabig, for 12 years the head of Montebello Bus Lines, has
been a proponent of the breakaway, known as "zoning": an effort to
improve bus service by cutting ties with the MTA. Now, he will leave
to serve as a general manager for the giant agency.</LD>
<LD>   "There's clearly a new approach at the MTA" since new Chief
Executive Roger Snoble came aboard in October, Gabig said. "There's
an understanding now about getting closer to the customer, a focus on
the customers' needs alone." By summer, the MTA plans to streamline
its bureaucracy by dividing bus service into four sectors covering
large swaths of Los Angeles County.</LD>
<TE>   Gabig said he will serve as head of the sector planned for the San
Gabriel Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The hiring of Gabig was hailed by the union representing bus
drivers as a sign that the zoning proposal, which is also being
considered in the San Fernando Valley, is foundering.</TE>
<TE>   Unions have long opposed the breakaway movement, fearing that
newly created bus companies could undercut jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Baldwin, a member of the zoning board in the San Gabriel
Valley, said breakaway fervor has ground nearly to a halt since
recently released financial figures showed that splitting with the
MTA would save little, if any, money.</TE>

<DH>Camarillo: High school science instructor and coach is
suspected of using pornography to seduce a male student.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Camarillo High School science teacher and coach has been arrested
on suspicion of using pornography to seduce a 17-year-old male
student and behaving lewdly in front of the teenager, authorities
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Chad Wenzlick Pridgen, 30, was in Ventura County Jail on $250,000
bail Wednesday after Sheriff's Department investigators arrested him
Tuesday night in his Camarillo home. Authorities also seized several
items from the house.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said the teenager reported the alleged incidents to
police Jan. 30. He said they occurred over several months beginning
in June of last year.</LD>
<TE>   Charges had not been filed as of late Wednesday. Pridgen is
scheduled to be arraigned at 1:30 p.m. today in Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Union High School District officials said they have placed
Pridgen on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of their
investigation. They said Pridgen's classes have been assigned to a
substitute teacher.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously the district has a strong interest in protecting the
students, and we are working with law enforcement to make sure that
interest is met," Assistant Supt. Roger Rice said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's authorities refused to release many details of the
arrest or events leading up to it, including whether the teenager was
one of Pridgen's students or what the teacher is suspected of doing.</TE>
<TE>   "We are heavily into this investigation and are looking at other
victims," sheriff's spokesman Eric Nishimoto said. "Any specifics we
release will severely compromise what we're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Nishimoto did say, however, that the charges do not include any
allegations of physical molestation.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen, who is in his seventh year at Camarillo High School,
taught upper-level science and coached boys' and girls' tennis this
year, district officials said. Parents and students said Pridgen also
coached last year's junior varsity boys' soccer team.</TE>
<TE>   For the past four years, he has coached a team of students to
compete in the Envirothon, a national academic contest that quizzes
students on environmental topics.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Tyler LeBrun, 17, was on the team last year. It placed 10th
in a competition among teams from the United States and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   LeBrun said members of this year's team showed up at school at 7
a.m. Wednesday for their weekly meeting with Pridgen, only to find
his classroom roped off with yellow police tape.</TE>
<TE>   "We were kind of surprised," he said. "The campus deputies told us
there wasn't a meeting this morning and that classes would be in the
library."</TE>
<TE>   Students said they hope another teacher will take over the team,
which begins competition in April.</TE>
<TE>   Rice said the school board will review the matter in closed
session at its next meeting Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Schools Remove Donated Books</HD>
<DH>L.A. Unified: Officials pull translations of Koran that are
deemed derogatory toward Jews.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG SMITH, HENRY WEINSTEIN and TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles city school officials have pulled nearly 300 translations
of the Koran from school libraries after learning that commentary in
the books was derogatory toward Jews.</LD>
<LD>   Copies of "The Meaning of the Holy Quran" were donated in December
to the Los Angeles Unified School District by a local Muslim
foundation, said Jim Konantz, director of information technology for
the district.</LD>
<LD>   Konantz said the books, offered as a goodwill gesture in response
to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, were distributed to the schools
last week without the usual content review. The reasons for skipping
the review were unclear, but the donor was known as a supportive
community member.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, Konantz received a complaint from a history teacher who
concluded some of the book's footnotes were anti-Semitic. After
reviewing the book, Konantz instructed principals to secure all
copies in their offices until the district determines what to do with
them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an issue of whether the Koran should be available in the
library," Konantz said. "It's like any other research volume. But
these interpretations are certainly in question."</TE>
<TE>   One of the footnotes, for instance, said, "The Jews in their
arrogance claimed that all wisdom and all knowledge of Allah was
enclosed in their hearts. But there were more things in heaven and
earth than were dreamt of in their philosophy. Their claim was not
only arrogance but blasphemy."</TE>
<TE>   Konantz said he is convening a committee to review the books. He
said the panel will include history teachers, representatives from
the Jewish community, and the donor, the Omar Ibn Khattab Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The decision is a thorny one because the Supreme Court has ruled
that motive is critical in determining whether it is constitutional
to remove a book from a school library.</TE>
<TE>   USC constitutional law professor Erwin Chemerinsky said it would
be discriminatory for L.A. Unified to stock books "written by Jews or
Christians that express criticisms of other religions," but exclude
books containing criticisms by Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Dafer Dakhil, director of the Omar Ibn Khattab Foundation, which
donated the books, could not be reached for comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Konantz said Dakhil met with him Tuesday and offered examples of
passages in the Bible that Dakhil said were derogatory toward
Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Konantz, however, said Dakhil appeared to be unaware of the
passages in "The Meaning of the Holy Quran" that had caused the
complaint. A frequent speaker at Board of Education meetings, Dakhil
has also volunteered with parent groups and has arranged for the
district to use his mosque near USC for teacher-training sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "In the spirit of Dafer, he was trying to increase tolerance and
understanding," board member David Tokofsky said. "That's the person
I know. It doesn't jibe that there would be such intolerant
language."</TE>
<TE>   Khaled Abou El Fadl, a UCLA Islamic law professor, said the book,
a 1934 translation of the Koran, reflects the stereotypical images
prevalent at the time--not only about Jews but also women.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the problems, he said the translation is widely
disseminated in the United States because Saudi-affiliated
institutions make them available for free or at a nominal cost. Abou
El Fadl said he believed use of the work was inappropriate for public
schools because of its biases. Or, if used, an explanation of the
historical context should be included, he said.</TE>

<HD>Judge Decries D.A.'s Role in Lawyer's Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: He says Cooley's office should not be involved in
the defense of one of its prosecutors in contempt proceedings
stemming from a murder trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge has accused Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley's office of creating an
"obvious ethical conflict" in defending a prosecutor who allegedly
altered evidence in a West Hills double-murder case.</LD>
<LD>   The office also may not have the legal authority to represent
Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Duarte in an upcoming contempt hearing,
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Terry A. Green said in court
papers.</LD>
<LD>   Green said prosecutors should not be involved in Duarte's defense
while they prepare to retry the murder case. Their dual role, the
judge contended, raises questions of whether the prosecutors can be
objective. But he stopped short of saying Cooley's office had
violated any ethical codes or laws.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors say they have done nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "If we thought there was a conflict, we'd withdraw. We don't see
that conflict," said Deputy Dist. Atty. William Woods, one of two
prosecutors defending Duarte.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutors tried three times to remove Green from the
contempt case, claiming that the judge is biased because he made the
accusations against Duarte. All the attempts failed.</TE>
<TE>   The acrimonious exchanges between the longtime judge and Cooley's
office follows the botched prosecution of the 1998 execution-style
killings of two witnesses in West Hills.</TE>
<TE>   In the contempt proceedings, Duarte, the original prosecutor in
the murder case, has been accused of altering witness statements and
not telling defense attorneys, in violation of a court order. The
accusations caused Cooley's office to drop its bid for the death
penalty for the two murder defendants.</TE>
<TE>   A deadlocked jury led to a mistrial for defendant Randall
Williams, 37. A second jury convicted Kenneth Leighton, 38, of
first-degree murder in the killings of Jamie Navaroli, 36, and April
Mahoney, 25, who were witnesses against him in a burglary case.
Green, outraged over Duarte's alleged misconduct, overturned the
murder verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley's office later removed Duarte from the case.</TE>
<TE>   If Green finds Duarte in contempt, the prosecutor could face a
fine and five days in jail for each of 17 allegations. The contempt
hearing will be held in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   It is rare for a judge to question the ethical conduct of
prosecutors, said Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and a
Loyola Law School professor who teaches legal ethics.</TE>
<TE>   "These aren't frivolous ethical concerns," Levenson said. "Cooley
is directing the defense of Duarte while directing the prosecution of
the underlying case. Therein lies the potential conflict."</TE>
<TE>   In a December court brief, Green said such a conflict was "to the
detriment of [the prosecutors'] client, the People of the State of
California."</TE>
<TE>   Green declined to comment, saying judicial ethics bar him from
talking about the case.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley also would not comment. His spokeswoman, Sandi Gibbons,
said the prosecutors defending Duarte are "not being directed by this
office." She added: "They're basically working for [Duarte] as if
he's a client."</TE>
<TE>   There has been "a wall erected" between prosecutors in the two
cases, Gibbons said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Levenson: "The difficulty is, at the top, looking over both
sides of the wall, is Steve Cooley."</TE>

<HD>Enron Suddenly Emerges as Major Campaign Issue</HD>
<DH>Politics: Rivals say Davis was too cozy with energy giant
during crisis, but governor fires right back at Riordan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suddenly, the Enron scandal has exploded into prominence in the race
for California governor, sending candidates into contortions as they
try to attack and defend at the same time.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans Bill Jones and Richard Riordan say Gov. Gray Davis
cozied up to Enron by secretly talking last year with the company's
ousted chief, Kenneth L. Lay. But neither condemns the Bush
administration's own private meetings with Enron officials while
shaping its energy plan.</LD>
<LD>   Democrat Davis lumps former Los Angeles Mayor Riordan with Enron
by accusing the city of gouging the state during last year's energy
crisis. At the same time, Davis is fending off calls to return more
than $100,000 in Enron campaign cash.</LD>
<TE>   As the contradictions suggest, there is no obvious partisan
advantage in the finger-pointing. Riordan has led the attacks this
week on Davis, part of an attempt to shift attention away from the
knotty abortion issue.</TE>
<TE>   But it was learned Wednesday that the former mayor had closer ties
to Enron than he has revealed: The company gave $10,000 in 1996 to a
campaign Riordan was waging to let the city's utility sell power in
the newly deregulated California market.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Enron was one of three companies vying for a contract
with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Enron's efforts
were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   "People are seeing that just about everybody is a little bit
pregnant," said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia expert on the
politics of scandal, noting Enron's lavish giving and ties to
prominent figures in both major parties.</TE>
<TE>   But that has not stopped the candidates from seizing on the Enron
affair, with its messy allegations of corporate greed and influence
peddling, to try to splatter their opponents.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal first surfaced in last month's debate among the
Republican hopefuls. Secretary of State Jones and businessman Bill
Simon Jr. suggested that there were signs of wrongdoing by Enron but
nothing yet proven.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan went further. He condemned Enron's extensive political
giving and said he had not received any money from the company. If he
had, he said, he would have returned it. The next day, Riordan was
forced to correct himself, acknowledging that he had received $500
from an Enron offshoot.</TE>
<TE>   Jones seized on that admission to attack Riordan along with Davis,
who has received $119,500 from Enron and its employees since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Then the governor acknowledged last week that he had periodically
spoken with Lay during last year's energy crunch. Jones immediately
demanded a full accounting of Davis' contacts with the energy
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is it that only a Republican administration should be
scrutinized for its activities when we have a glaring example of
rampant conflict of interest and a governor who has not told the
truth to the media and the public?" Jones said in a speech earlier
this week in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Jones has not, however, demanded the same disclosure by the White
House, which is fighting efforts to divulge the extent of its outside
contacts while formulating its energy plan last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I am strongly in support of the executive ability to be able to
have discussions that may in fact not be part of the public purview,"
Jones said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan has similarly attacked the governor--"What is Gray Davis
trying to hide?" he demanded this week--while refusing to discuss the
Bush administration's lack of disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the contradiction, the Riordan campaign refused to
respond.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not getting into that," said Margita Thompson, a Riordan
spokeswoman. "What I'm talking to you about is Gray Davis."</TE>
<TE>   Like the governor, Riordan conferred privately with Lay during the
height of last year's electricity crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's meeting took place in Beverly Hills. Lay presented
Riordan, financier Michael Milken, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and
other luminaries with a four-page plan calling for greater
deregulation as a way of solving the state's energy shortage.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Thompson suggested that Davis' talks with Lay were
more significant. "Gray Davis is the one who has a direct impact on
the future of California's energy crisis," she said. "We don't know
what Enron got for its investment in Gray Davis."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson also defended the $100,000 Enron contributed to the 2000
Democratic National Convention. Riordan was chief fund-raiser for the
extravaganza, held at Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles. "That
[argument] would taint everyone involved with the Democratic National
Convention," she said of Enron's donation.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, for his part, has said he has no intention of returning the
campaign contributions he received from the collapsed energy giant.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really not a large amount, considering what we've raised in
this campaign," said Roger Salazar, a Davis spokesman. To date, the
governor has collected more than $40 million.</TE>
<TE>   "If you take a look at the folks who are bringing this up, the
only reason they're bringing this up is they espouse the same type of
free-market policies Enron does and they're trying to change the
subject," Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   Aides also say Davis has been one of Enron's biggest critics,
fighting the company over price caps and reimbursements for alleged
overcharges for power.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, who has been widely faulted for his handling of the
electricity crisis, has sought to turn the issue against Riordan by
accusing Los Angeles of being among those overcharging the state for
surplus power.</TE>
<TE>   "He gouged the rest of the state, charging us twice as much as
out-of-state generators," a Davis TV spot charges. "More than Enron."</TE>
<TE>   But Riordan says Los Angeles sold its excess energy to the rest of
California at prices set by state regulators. He also notes that the
city was spared the rolling blackouts that hit the rest of California
and never raised rates during his eight years as mayor. With all the
Enron connections, most observers doubt that any one candidate will
suffer, unless some more dramatic revelations surface.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can link conversations or Enron contributions to Gray
Davis' inaction ... or can link Enron donations or contributions with
Riordan's pro-deregulation stance, then maybe you've got something,"
said UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain. Otherwise, "the
Enron mud is around everybody, so people are going to throw that.
They'll stop when the polls show it's not getting them any points."</TE>

<HD>A Troubled Santa Paula Neighborhood Gets Help</HD>
<DH>Aid: A $1-million federal grant will be used to increase
law enforcement and expand community center programs in an effort to
deter crime in the area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Santa Paula neighborhood plagued by violence and overcrowding has
received a federal grant of more than $1 million to fight crime and
build a base of community activities for residents.</LD>
<LD>   By October, people living in a two-square-mile neighborhood of
single-family homes and apartments near Las Piedras Park have been
promised an officer walking the beat and a full-time activities
coordinator at the park's community center on 13th Street.</LD>
<LD>   The money is part of the Department of Justice's Weed and Seed
program, which has handed out similar grants to more than 270
low-income, high-crime neighborhoods across the country since it
began in 1991.</LD>
<TE>   "Hopefully this grant will create an opportunity for education and
training for those who are involved in crime and drugs," Santa Paula
Police Chief Bob Gonzales said at a news conference Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The federal program was designed to help communities pay for
additional police officers and expand community programs.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales said the $1,075,000 grant will pump much-needed money
into the center's Boys &amp; Girls Clubs program, provide tutoring for
children and adults and boost an English program at Santa Paula High
School.</TE>
<TE>   The federal funds also will help the city start new youth athletic
programs.</TE>
<TE>   An additional officer, to be added to the city's 32-member force,
will work at the center on a flexible schedule, Gonzales said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be different," he said. "They will basically be
able to write their own job description. They could work late in the
day and into the evening, but it won't be conventional."</TE>
<TE>   Considering that a community survey listed residential
overcrowding as a main concern of the neighborhood, the new patrol
officer also will focus on housing violations.</TE>
<TE>   After a decade-long dip in crime, Santa Paula, a farming community
of about 29,000, announced this month that robbery and thefts jumped
13% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Residents who live near the center welcomed news of an increased
law enforcement presence but questioned whether it will discourage
criminal behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bad area and we don't ever just go out for a stroll,
especially at night," said Michelle Karayan, 29, who lives a block
from Las Piedras Park. "I have heard the gunshots at night. [The
neighborhood] definitely needs to have more attention paid to it."</TE>
<TE>   The grant will be spread out over five years, said Grace Denton
of the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, who worked with city
and county officials on the grant.</TE>
<TE>   The first $175,000 to Santa Paula will pay the police officer's
salary and benefits, with the remaining funds set aside to hire a
full-time office administrator and a part-time assistant. A part-time
youth recreation coordinator also will be hired.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining money will be paid out in $225,000 installments over
the next four years, said Michael Jump, a development officer in the
district attorney's office who helped secure the grant.</TE>
<TE>   Additional grant money will fund crisis-intervention classes for
domestic-violence victims, a new computer and refrigerator, office
equipment and field trips, Jump said.</TE>
<TE>   There are fewer than a dozen Weed and Seed programs in Central and
Southern California, including two in Oxnard, Denton said.</TE>

<HD>Plan May Spare Jewish Centers</HD>
<DH>Children: Four sites, two in the Valley, could remain open
if registration and fund-raising goals are met.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Children's programs at four Los Angeles Jewish community centers
scheduled for closure this summer could remain open another school
year if the centers meet strict enrollment and fund-raising goals,
organization officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Jewish Community Centers of Greater Los Angeles announced plans in
December to terminate the after-school, kindergarten and preschool
programs on June 30 to make up for a financial shortfall. The sites
are North Valley in Granada Hills, Valley Cities in Sherman Oaks,
Silver Lake-Los Feliz and Westside in the Fairfax District.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, however, the centers' board of directors announced a
business plan crafted with local community center leaders to boost
enrollment and revenues that could keep the children's program afloat
through June 2003.</LD>
<TE>   "We are very optimistic that the benchmarks are reachable," said
David Novak, a spokesman for the Jewish Community Centers of Greater
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "However, if the milestones are not met," he added, "it will mean
that they are not financially viable and the board will reconsider
the situation."</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, children's enrollment applications must be
accompanied by a signed agreement and a deposit by March 31.</TE>
<TE>   Applications received between April 1 and May 15 must include a
signed agreement and first and last months' tuition.</TE>
<TE>   In a related move, a board subcommittee is considering negotiating
with Temple Beth Shir Shalom in Santa Monica to acquire Bay Cities
Jewish Community Center or lease it to the synagogue for children's
programs.</TE>
<TE>   For the centers to remain open, the following enrollment and
fund-raising goals must be met:</TE>
<TE>   * North Valley--48 preschoolers and 12 kindergartners enrolled by
May 15 and $150,000 raised by July 31.</TE>
<TE>   * Silver Lake-Los Feliz--60 preschoolers and nine kindergartners
enrolled and $40,000 raised by May 15.</TE>
<TE>   * Valley Cities--75 preschoolers and $120,000 raised by May 15.</TE>
<TE>   * Westside--75 preschoolers and nine kindergartners enrolled and
$50,000 raised by May 15.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Calabasas landscaping contractor who forced his predominantly
Latino workers to kick back more than half of their wages pleaded
guilty in federal court to making false statements in his payroll
records.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Salke, 48, who will be sentenced June 12, faces up to five
years in federal prison.</LD>
<LD>   Between 1995 and 1998, Salke's Aztec Landscape Engineering company
was awarded more than $2 million in state Department of
Transportation contracts to landscape and maintain highway
interchanges, prosecutors said.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Salke agreed to pay his workers $8 to $12 per
hour, but wrote checks to them in amounts consistent with the state's
prevailing wage of $24 to $29 per hour. The workers then cashed the
checks and paid him the difference.</TE>

<HD>Teenager Pleads Not Guilty in Friend's Shooting Death</HD>

<LD>A 14-year-old Whittier boy accused of fatally shooting his teenage
friend pleaded not guilty to murder and involuntary manslaughter
charges Wednesday at Los Padrinos Juvenile Courthouse in Downey.</LD>
<LD>   Christopher Simmons is accused of using his parents' rifle to
shoot Nicholas Calamusa, 15, in the forehead while playing Friday
afternoon at the Simmons home.</LD>
<LD>   Whittier Police Officer Alan Dela Pena said authorities have
sufficient evidence to prove that Simmons had control of the rifle
and pulled the trigger.</LD>
<TE>   "He intended to pull the trigger, but we don't know if he intended
to hurt his friend," Dela Pena said.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting has shaken many of the teenagers who were either
Nicholas' classmates or skated with him at the city skate park.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Simmons and the Calamusa families have described the
shooting as a tragedy that demonstrates how dangerous guns can be.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a terrible accident that shouldn't have happened to
anyone," said Nicholas' mother, Pamela Pellizzon. "The kid who picked
up the gun didn't know what he was doing."</TE>
<TE>   A memorial in front of the Simmons home has attracted candles,
flowers and letters.</TE>
<TE>   A candlelight vigil at the skating park drew nearly 100 people
Tuesday night. As the sun set and candles were lighted, the
teenager's friends gathered. Amid the sound of skates striking
against the concrete, the young group honored Nicholas' memory.</TE>
<TE>   "Our hearts go out to the Calamusa family," said Christopher's
father, Ron Simmons. "We loved Nick like our own."</TE>
<TE>   After a moment of silence and several prayers from the group,
Pellizzon addressed the teenagers: "Please don't handle guns. Please
don't let this happen to one of you."</TE>
<TE>   Police said Wednesday that they had spoken with one youth who was
with Nicholas and Christopher when the rifle was fired.</TE>
<TE>   The 13-year-old boy said in an interview that he saw Christopher
point the gun at Nicholas as they joked but that he did not believe
Christopher meant to kill his friend.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't know it would fire," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas' teachers described him as an active student. His friends
remembered his passion for in-line skating. His mother mentioned
Nicholas' diligence in helping his grandfather by walking with him
soon after he suffered a stroke.</TE>
<TE>   She said she remembers saying goodbye to her son Friday before he
went to the Simmons home.</TE>
<TE>   "Stay out of trouble," she remembered telling him. "Be good and I
love you."</TE>

<HD>Study Urged for LAX</HD>
<DH>Airport: A coalition of elected officials wants Hahn to
order more environmental impact reports before any expansion work
begins. Critics also want a say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of city, county and federal elected officials has urged
Mayor James K. Hahn to order new environmental studies of any
improvement of Los Angeles International Airport, adding that
opponents of past expansion plans should be allowed to help draft any
new alternative.</LD>
<LD>   Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) and Jane Harman (D-Venice),
county Supervisor Don Knabe and Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth
Galanter joined in asking the mayor not to push through his
still-unformed plan for the airport using outdated environmental
studies.</LD>
<LD>   The officials joined El Segundo Mayor Mike Gordon and Inglewood
Councilman Lawrence A. Kirkley in suggesting that Hahn's attempt to
fast-track airport improvements could violate the California
environmental laws.</LD>
<TE>   "By working together, the city of Los Angeles and the stakeholders
in the future of LAX can more effectively plan to meet new security
requirements, develop a blueprint for LAX that is safe, fair and
prudent for the region, and assure an appropriate and acceptable
level of environmental review for a project of such scale and
importance," said a letter from the six elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon said in an interview that he is concerned it appears Los
Angeles airport officials have begun working on the new expansion
plan, but none of the critics have been invited to any meetings to
discuss options.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to be handed a completed plan and be left to vote
it up or down," said Gordon, who has led efforts to slow the
expansion of LAX. "We had a horrible experience with Mayor [Richard]
Riordan. We were shut out of the process."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn plans to include interested parties early in talks about the
airport, according to spokeswoman Hilda Delgado. She said she was
unsure whether opponents of the earlier plan would be allowed to help
draft the new proposal or provide comments after a draft is complete.</TE>
<TE>   "As the fifth alternative moves forward, the mayor expects the
community and all stakeholders to take part in the process," Delgado
said. Airport Commission President Ted Stein and attorneys for the
city believe a supplemental report can provide enough environmental
review to comply with state environmental law.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor announced in October that he was scaling back a
$12-billion expansion proposed by Riordan and would develop a plan
that beefs up security and air safety.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said his expansion plan would allow the airport to
accommodate 78 million passengers a year. That would be more than the
40 million the facility was designed for, but less than the 89
million travelers who could have been accommodated under Riordan's
plan.</TE>
<TE>   The elected officials voiced concerns at press reports that the
city plans to use the environmental impact report drafted in 2001 for
the previous expansion plan, even though many people said the report
was deficient in addressing the negative impacts of an expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Given the controversy involving the first environmental study, the
elected officials warned that "moving forward with the master plan
process using the previous environmental analysis may leave the
city's environmental review vulnerable to legal challenge and may not
constitute the optimal use of public resources."</TE>
<TE>   To support its contention, the group released a legal opinion,
drafted for the El Segundo City Council by attorneys E. Clement Shute
Jr. and Christy H. Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   Using the old environmental report to address issues involving a
new proposal, the attorneys concluded, would not be allowed by state
law, "unless major additional analysis is undertaken and circulated
for public review and comment."</TE>
<TE>   When Hahn first announced his alternative plan, Waters said she
would support it only if it limited the annual passengers to 78
million, but even then added: "We don't want expansion under another
name called security."</TE>

<LD>In the first prosecution under a new truancy program, a judge
Wednesday placed a 17-year-old girl on probation after she admitted
repeatedly skipping school.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert Hutson ordered the
Anaheim girl to meet regularly with a probation officer, who will
make sure she is attending classes at Gilbert High School.</LD>
<LD>   If the girl misses school because of illness, she must provide her
probation officer with a doctor's note, Deputy Dist. Atty. Danielle
Augustin said. She is to return to court April 10 for a review.</LD>
<TE>   Orange County prosecutors launched the truancy program last month
with prosecutions of the 17-year-old and the parent of another youth

<HD>Gunman Who Fled Police Sought</HD>
<DH>LAPD: A suspected car thief who pointed a weapon at an
officer may have been wounded, authorities say.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police asked the public's help Wednesday in tracking down
a suspected car thief who may have been shot by one officer when he
reportedly pointed a gun at another.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect appeared to have been hit once in the back after
pointing a semiautomatic handgun at Officers John Bennett and Heather
Kowalczyk, said Sgt. John Pasquariello, a spokesman for the Los
Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   Bennett, 39, has 71/2 years' experience with the department, and
Kowalczyk, 34, is a four-year veteran.</LD>
<TE>   The confrontation occurred as Bennett approached the suspect's car
on the shoulder of the Hollywood Freeway, police said.</TE>
<TE>   When the man pointed his gun at Bennett, Kowalczyk drew her pistol
and fired at the suspect, Pasquariello said.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later the man sped down the freeway and exited at Roscoe
Boulevard. Police pursued him to Strathern Street and Wilkinson
Avenue, where he abandoned the car and ran, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said he forced his way into a home on Rhodes Avenue and
made a phone call, and later broke into another home a short distance
away and stole a change of clothes. Outside a nearby home, police
found a bloody, white T-shirt with a bullet hole, Pasquariello said.</TE>

<HD>Justices Backing Law on Serial Rapists</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jurists indicate they favor a legal standard that
would keep sexual predators in custody if they are found to be likely
to commit a new offense.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Expressing concerns about public safety, members of the California
Supreme Court indicated Wednesday that they favor a new legal
standard that could prevent the freeing of serial sex offenders who
represent a substantial danger.</LD>
<LD>   The court, meeting here for arguments, is considering whether
Patrick Ghilotti, 45, a serial rapist who has completed a prison
sentence and four years of treatment at a state hospital, can return
to society.</LD>
<LD>   The court did not specify what standard it will impose before
repeat sex offenders can be released from state hospitals after
serving their sentences.</LD>
<TE>   But several justices suggested they will support a requirement
that would keep repeat rapists and molesters confined even if the
felons have less than a 50% chance of re-offending.</TE>
<TE>   "How about the concern of the public?" Justice Joyce L. Kennard
asked a defense lawyer. "Isn't public safety an important factor?"</TE>
<TE>   Questions by the justices indicated that the court may ask a Marin
County judge to determine whether mental health evaluators complied
with the new standard when they recommended Ghilotti's release.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the justices appeared sharply critical of the
California Department of Mental Health for failing to have taken
legal steps earlier to keep Ghilotti confined.</TE>
<TE>   The convicted rapist was set to be released in December after
three mental health evaluators found that he did not meet the
requirements for continued hospital commitment. But the state high
court intervened. The Department of Mental Health contended that
Ghilotti remained dangerous, and Gov. Gray Davis and Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer wanted the state high court to prevent his return to Marin
County, where he committed the rapes.</TE>
<TE>   The court, acting on an emergency petition, said it would consider
the legal standards mental health evaluators must apply in deciding
whether a patient is safe enough to return to the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Under a 1996 state sexually violent predator law, repeat sex
offenders can be committed to state hospitals after their prison
terms if at least two mental health experts find they have a mental
condition that makes them likely to rape or molest again.</TE>
<TE>   The court is using Ghilotti's case to examine the legal meaning of
the term "likely" to re-offend. In passing the sexual predator law,
the Legislature did not spell out what it intended by that language.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors argue that Ghilotti and other sex offenders should be
kept confined if they have a "significant" chance--more than a mere
possibility but less than "more likely than not"--of re-offending.</TE>
<TE>   Ghilotti's lawyers contend that the U.S. Constitution requires
courts to release such patients unless they have more than a 50%
chance of re-offending.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Marvin L. Baxter scoffed at the defense lawyers' proposed
standard.</TE>
<TE>   "What would ever motivate the legislators to establish a standard
to release sexual predators in situations where there is up to a 50%
chance they will re-offend?" Baxter asked. "Why would a legislature
even consider that?"</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice Ronald M. George observed that the Legislature could
have adopted a "more likely than not" standard, but declined.</TE>
<TE>   Kennard asked attorneys how they would view a standard that said
sex offenders with mental problems must be confined if they are a
"substantial danger" to society and represent a risk "significantly
beyond that of the population at large."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution liked the definition; the defense did not.</TE>
<TE>   "The Legislature cannot have intended to pass an unconstitutional
law," said Ronald Boyer, arguing on behalf of the Public Defenders
Assn. and the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice. "For every
notch the standard of likelihood is lowered, we increase the number
of unnecessary commitments."</TE>
<TE>   "If you set the standard at 50%," Boyer continued, "that means you
are going to lock up one person who is not going to re-offend for
every one person who is going to re-offend."</TE>
<TE>   Baxter bristled. "Of course, the higher the permissible
percentage, the greater number of victims who are going to be
victimized," he said. "The percentages play both ways."</TE>
<TE>   Baxter said he feels concern for the woman who has to live next
door to a sexual predator who has been released.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about real people," the justice said.</TE>
<TE>   Boyer replied that offenders who are confined in Atascadero State
Hospital are real people too.</TE>
<TE>   The justices repeatedly grilled the prosecution about why the
Department of Mental Health failed during court hearings in Marin
County last year to raise strong legal objections to the reports
written by Ghilotti's mental health evaluators.</TE>
<TE>   The state did not even provide Marin County Judge John S. Graham,
who was considering Ghilotti's case, with the reports and did not
argue that the experts had failed to meet legal requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the state insisted that the 1996 predator law allows the
director of the Department of Mental Health to petition for an
inmate's confinement, regardless of the findings of evaluators.</TE>
<TE>   The court on Wednesday clearly rejected that contention.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Assistant Atty. Gen. Robert R. Anderson said prosecutors
offered to provide Graham with the reports at one point but the judge
declined them. Anderson said Graham had erred by refusing to read
them.</TE>
<TE>   "What if we take a different view and consider that the trial
court did not err," Baxter said. "If anyone erred, it was the
department for failing to raise the issue."</TE>
<TE>   George noted that the state high court has yet to determine the
appropriate legal standard the evaluators should have followed, and
both sides disagree with what it should be.</TE>
<TE>   "The trial court did not even know what standard the evaluators
were following," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The court is expected to decide Ghilotti's case within 90 days.</TE>
<TE>   Ghilotti, in the meantime, will remain at Atascadero. He was
convicted of raping four women in Marin County and admitted raping at
least six others.</TE>

<HD>Area Prepared for Large Disaster, Experts Say</HD>
<DH>Emergencies: At a meeting in Camarillo, public safety
workers say they have learned from earthquakes, huge brush fires and
the Alaska Airlines crash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earthquakes, the Alaska Airlines crash and massive brush fires have
prepared local public safety workers for many of the elements of a
disaster rivaling the World Trade Center attacks.</LD>
<LD>   That was the opinion Wednesday of police, firefighters and
emergency operations experts who attended a two-hour lecture in
Camarillo by a search-and-rescue worker who spent two weeks at Ground
Zero in New York.</LD>
<LD>   "California is really ready for the big stuff--much more so than
many other places," said Jim Hone, a Santa Monica assistant fire
chief who works on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Urban
Search and Rescue Team.</LD>
<TE>   In a meeting room at Cal State Channel Islands, Hone used video,
slides and his own recollections to share his experience at the
chaotic, debris-littered area in Lower Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   More than 60 city, county and state employees--many of whom worked
on the 1994 Northridge earthquake and the January 2000 Alaska
Airlines crash--attended the grim but informative talk.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time area rescue workers have been convened to
hear from a person who served on the front line of America's
deadliest disaster, said Laura Hernandez, manager of the county's
Office of Emergency Services. "There's always something to be
learned," Hernandez said. "We do a lot of proactive work like this so
we can continue to improve our system."</TE>
<TE>   The audience learned California's buildings are far sturdier than
those in Manhattan because of strict construction codes put into
place in the wake of several disastrous earthquakes.</TE>
<TE>   And unlike their East Coast counterparts, Hone said, California
emergency workers function under a standardized disaster plan that
outlines who does what and where. Workers also use a written and oral
code system that signals everything from when a building has been
searched to when to escape eminent danger.</TE>
<TE>   Experience Dealing With Disaster Teams</TE>
<TE>   State emergency officials also have an abundance of experience in
dealing with federal disaster teams sent into situations deemed too
large for a single city or state to handle.</TE>
<TE>   "What he [Hone] said reinforced a lot of the things we already
know, and a big part of that is having a plan in place," said Debby
Steffen, an administrator with the governor's Office of Emergency
Services.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Fire Capt. Brian Dilley said he agreed with Hone's
statement that "there's a world of difference on the other side of
the Colorado River."</TE>
<TE>   "You have to have trained people to handle these situations, and
we do," Dilley said. "We have dealt with them. Just think of some of
the big brush fires here."</TE>
<TE>   While the lecture did not criticize rescue efforts at Ground
Zero--Hone praised New York City police and firefighters--the
afternoon was meant as a stark reminder of the critical elements of
disaster relief. This lesson is particularly relevant in California,
Hone said, since experts predict a major earthquake in the state
could kill as many as 20,000 people and injure 80,000.</TE>
<TE>   Hone said rescuers need to make carefully thought decisions about
entering burning buildings, particularly if fuel is involved; focus
on first saving victims and then recovering the dead, and always wear
proper clothing and breathing equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Lean heavily on state and federal resources when appropriate, Hone
said. For instance, call the Army Corps of Engineers for big cases
because the corps is expert in removing large debris.</TE>
<TE>   County officials said there were no immediate plans to make any
major changes to the area's written disaster plans, but several
leaders plan to share their experience from the lecture with
co-workers and employees.</TE>

<PH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>Riordan Battles Rivals and His Own Candor</HD>
<DH>The candidate's penchant for quirky jests and blunt speech
unnerves his advisors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gubernatorial candidate Richard Riordan is calling supporters on his
cell phone and asking for donations. He makes his pitch from his
campaign bus as it lumbers down the San Bernardino Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   "Well, things are good," he says after the last call. "I got
$25,000 from one of the cheapest guys in L.A."</LD>
<LD>   Riordan aides burst into nervous laughter. It is another
spontaneous display of candor from a candidate whose handlers cringe
at the prospect of many more to come.</LD>
<TE>   In an era when candidates take pains to stick closely to a
carefully prepared message, Riordan has refused to shake a habit that
has landed him in trouble time and again: He says what's on his mind.</TE>
<TE>   His advisors say Riordan's freewheeling manner on the stump has an
upside. If he wins the March 5 Republican primary, they say, it could
offer a stark contrast to the robotic style of Democratic incumbent
Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor is probably the best definition there is of a
professional politician," said Riordan campaign manager Ron Hartwig.
"If anybody has gone to school on what to say and what not to say in
public life, it certainly has been Gray Davis. He's extremely
disciplined."</TE>
<TE>   But it is precisely that self-discipline that got Davis elected
four times to statewide office, said Garry South, chief strategist of
the governor's reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things about politics is, your words come back to
haunt you, and Dick Riordan has said a lot of pretty goofy things,"
South said.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, he added, "thinks being a babbling buffoon is a thing of
beauty, and everyone's just supposed to fall head over heals for his
shtick. I will tell you, having been in this business for 30 years, a
little bit of self-discipline is a good thing in politics."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Davis turned a Riordan joke about San Francisco into a
dead-serious television ad against the former Los Angeles mayor. The
ad says Riordan gloated about "gouging" the rest of California last
year when Los Angeles was selling surplus electricity to avert
blackouts. At the height of the energy crisis, Riordan had quipped in
a luncheon speech: "If it's San Francisco, no mercy."</TE>
<TE>   'Did I Do OK?'</TE>
<TE>   Riordan is well aware of his penchant for sharing thoughts that he
might better keep to himself. Day after day, he frets out loud about
the risk that he will "get in trouble" by answering a tough question.</TE>
<TE>   "Did I do OK?" he asked an aide after a radio interview that
touched on gay marriage. "I didn't screw up too badly?"</TE>
<TE>   At times, Riordan tries to be cautious. On a visit to the Central
Valley last week, he was asked how it felt to see the town of Galt
for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to keep my sense of humor to myself," he replied.</TE>
<TE>   The week before, Riordan's sense of humor was on full display at a
breakfast with supporters in a Riverside coffee shop. A motorcyclist
asked his opinion of California's helmet laws.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to outlaw all motorcycles," Riordan said.</TE>
<TE>   When the guffaws died down, Riordan expressed concern about the
safety of "those Nazi-looking, black, thin plastic helmets."</TE>
<TE>   The conversation turned to traffic jams--a matter of great
importance to Inland Empire residents.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to sell books on tape to people who are on the 91
Freeway," Riordan cracked. "I could make a fortune. I'll put
Harlequin novels on tape."</TE>
<TE>   A supporter asked Riordan to name the first thing he would do as
governor.</TE>
<TE>   "After I execute everybody?" Riordan asked.</TE>
<TE>   Laughter filled the coffee shop.</TE>
<TE>   "Headline: 'Riordan Will Execute Everybody in Sacramento,' " the
candidate continued between bites of scrambled eggs and hash browns.
He moved on to a serious answer: He would "get rid of most of the
rules and regulations."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's directness is not always in jest. In Sacramento last
week, he startled passengers on his bus by screaming at a reporter
during a conversation about the death of his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to talk to you again!" he yelled. "Just get out of
here!"</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's staff keeps watch for his unguarded comments. In San
Diego last month, Riordan glanced out the window of his bus and
noticed the driver of a pickup truck flashing him a thumbs-up sign.
Riordan smiled, returned the gesture and muttered, "Rednecks for
Riordan." His spokeswoman Carolina Guevara asked a reporter later:
"You're not going to use that 'rednecks-for-Riordan' comment, are
you?"</TE>
<TE>   Aside from Davis, the candidate taking most advantage of Riordan's
unrestrained manner is Bill Jones, who is running in the GOP primary.</TE>
<TE>   Long before Davis put the San Francisco joke in his television
spot, Jones was using it against Riordan in his stump speech.</TE>
<TE>   Jones also has mocked Riordan for mixing up "fiberglass" and
"fiber-optics." Last month, he hammered Riordan for saying
California's $6.75 minimum wage is too low. Riordan had expressed his
concerns about the minimum wage during a visit to a citrus packing
plant; his remarks overshadowed the main purpose of the campaign
stop--to promote his pro-business agenda.</TE>
<TE>   To gather material against Riordan, both the Jones and Davis
campaigns have dispatched operatives with cameras and tape recorders
to his public events. Jones aides call it "gaffe watch."</TE>
<TE>   "Every time Riordan goes somewhere and says something, we know
he's going to step in it again," said Mark Bogetich, chief of
"opposition research" for Jones.</TE>
<TE>   'Not a Hair Out of Place'</TE>
<TE>   With Davis, unscripted moments are rare. The governor "probably
says nothing which isn't completely and totally calculated," said
political scientist Bruce Cain of UC Berkeley. "There's not a hair
out of place," Cain said.</TE>
<TE>   The governor is so skilled at staying on message that some suspect
"there's no genuine core Gray Davis," he said. Still, Davis runs
little risk of his own words harming his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from Riordan, the candidate who has run that risk most
notably in recent years is Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).</TE>
<TE>   During travels on his Straight Talk Express bus in the 2000
presidential campaign, McCain was tripped up twice by speaking
freely. The former prisoner of war apologized for using an anti-Asian
slur in referring to his Vietnamese captors and for saying that Pat
Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell were "evil."</TE>
<TE>   Hartwig, Riordan's campaign manager, sees "a constant battle going
on inside Dick Riordan."</TE>
<TE>   On one hand, Riordan recognizes the need to be an "extremely
disciplined politician," Hartwig said.</TE>
<TE>   On the other, Riordan tells himself, "I've got to say what I
believe, because that is in fact why people like me, why people have
confidence in me."</TE>
<TE>   Hartwig said he enjoyed working for a candidate who struggles with
that conflict, but expressed grudging admiration for Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if you can find many off-the-reservation comments by
this guy, because he absolutely operates by rote," Hartwig said.</TE>
<TE>   "For a campaign manager, it's got to be a delight."</TE>

<HD>2 Are Shot at Gardena High</HD>
<DH>Violence: The students' wounds are not life-threatening.
Young robbers are not found despite campus lockdown and an intensive
search.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC and HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gunfire erupted during an attempted robbery Wednesday afternoon at
Gardena High School, wounding two students and prompting a campus
lockdown that stretched into the night as police and dogs searched
classroom to classroom for the attackers, reportedly one former and
two current students.</LD>
<LD>   The victims, a 16-year-old girl and a 19-year-old man, were taken
to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where their conditions were listed as
serious but stable. Officials said the wounds were not
life-threatening. The attackers had not been found.</LD>
<LD>   The names of the victims were not released, but relatives
identified the girl as Stephanie Alonso, a member of the school
soccer team.</LD>
<TE>   Sgt. John Pasquariello, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police
Department, said the incident began about 2:50 p.m., when three
teenagers confronted the victims in a hallway outside bathrooms near
the center of campus. Students were on a break between classes.</TE>
<TE>   The trio demanded money, and the male victim responded, "I don't
have any money," Pasquariello said. "The suspect told him, 'Well,
I've got a gun.'''</TE>
<TE>   As the two victims turned to walk away, one of the attackers
opened fire with a pistol, said Officer Jason Lee, another LAPD
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "The male victim was hit in the lower back; the female victim was
hit in the hip," Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   The hunt for the three suspects continued long after the campus on
West 182nd Street normally closes. About 500 of the school's 2,300
students were held in their classrooms for hours during the search,
leaving parents uncertain about where to find their children.</TE>
<TE>   While some students were released within minutes, others were
still being held more than five hours later. Officials said the last
of them would be bused to a nearby middle school and released there.</TE>
<TE>   Police would say only that the attackers were current and former
students but would not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, non-students have repeatedly tried to get onto
the Los Angeles Unified School District campus, which is surrounded
by seven-foot-high chain link fences, prompting Gardena High to beef
up security, said Board of Education member Mike Lansing. Because
school was letting out, those fences were open Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The campus search was called off by 9 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Joanna Thompson, a 15-year-old student, said she was hurrying
across campus for an appointment with a counselor when she heard the
shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a girl with a hole in her leg and blood coming out," Joanna
said. "There was a lot of people yelling, 'Duck! Duck! Duck!' "</TE>
<TE>   Police said that as students scattered for cover, the attackers
fled on foot. Two young men were detained outside the school about
half an hour after the shooting, but both were released and police
said neither was a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Vladovic, district school superintendent for the area,
described the wounded teenagers as "innocent students."</TE>
<TE>   "They're not gang members," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD responded to the crime because Gardena High is actually
within the city of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives gathered outside the campus Wednesday afternoon,
awaiting word on where to meet their children. At 7 p.m., Vladovic
met with the increasingly frustrated families, attempting to placate
them.</TE>
<TE>   "I know you want your babies," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Half an hour later, Vladovic announced that the remaining pupils
would be bused to nearby Peary Middle School and released there
because the crowd of 150 or so angry parents was becoming chaotic.
The news further angered the waiting relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ludicrous," said Gail Gatlin, whose 15-year-old daughter,
Ammori, had yet to be released.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Estrada, whose 18-year-old son, Saul, was still on campus,
said she saw TV reports of the shooting. Her first concern was that
her son might be hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt my world collapse around me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Estrada said she ran several blocks to the campus, only to be held
back and told by police that no information was available.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it's my son or not, you still have to worry about your
fellow man," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The students said everyone remained calm during the lock-down, and
several of them used cell phones to call their parents and say
everything was all right.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the stranded pupils watched news coverage of the incident
on classroom TV sets. But others, such as Pablo Davila, 14, had no
access to television, and were reduced to doing their homework.</TE>
<TE>   "It's boring," said Ebony Christopher, 14, who talked to a
reporter through an open window.</TE>
<TE>   At the hospital where the wounded teenagers were taken, a woman
who identified herself only as the girl's aunt questioned the
security at the school.</TE>
<TE>   "It's horrible that it takes something like this before people
really think about it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The girl's sister, Cynthia Alonso, a former student at Gardena
High, said she always felt safe there but thought security could have
been better.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the school, student Karina Ulloa, 17, said violence breaks
out on campus every year.</TE>
<TE>   But Vladovic insisted that the school is safe and has no history
of violence.</TE>
<TE>   "This is like any other big urban high school," he said. "This was
an isolated incident. It could have happened anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   School board member Lansing said the shooting illustrates a larger
problem that may not be solved by extra guards, gates and metal
detectors.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be a better solution, and we're going to have to
find different ways to deal with it," he said.</TE>

<HD>Ethics Inquiry Urged</HD>
<DH>Election: D.A. declines to file charges in probe of Hahn
camp's role in hit ads paid for by Indian tribes, but suggests city
might take civil action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An investigation by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office
has raised "serious questions" about whether one of James K. Hahn's
political fund-raisers improperly directed Native American tribes to
launch hit mailers against election opponent Antonio Villaraigosa.</LD>
<LD>   The Public Integrity Division of the district attorney's office
concluded there was "insufficient evidence" to make a criminal filing
linking the Hahn mayoral campaign to spending by several Southern
California Indian tribes.</LD>
<LD>   But the county prosecutor's office on Wednesday suggested that the
city Ethics Commission may be able to pursue civil fines against
those involved. A four-page summary of the case described "troubling"
interlocking relationships between Hahn allies and the Indian tribes,
who were supposedly acting independently when they painted
Villaraigosa as soft on crime in a series of postcard mailers.</LD>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said that gaping holes in the state's
election laws made any prosecution difficult.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported in May that Daniel Weinstein, a Hahn supporter
and fund-raiser, asked for the contributions in a conference
telephone call to the leaders of several Southern California Indian
tribes.</TE>
<TE>   Within days, one of those tribes, the Soboba Band of Mission
Indians, sent $100,000 to a San Francisco political consulting firm
to produce mailers that attacked Hahn's opponent, Villaraigosa, as
lenient on child pornographers and sexual predators. Hahn defeated
Villaraigosa in the June mayoral runoff.</TE>
<TE>   The attack ads fell outside the city's voter-approved $1,000 limit
on direct contributions to candidates for citywide office, because
they were considered expenditures "independent" of the Hahn campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's eight-month investigation focused on
whether the tribes' attacks on Villaraigosa were truly independent.
Investigators questioned whether Hahn or his campaign "directed,
coordinated, arranged, requested or suggested" any of the
expenditures by the Sobobas or two other Indian tribes, which spent a
total of $350,000 on anti-Villaraigosa mailers or radio ads.</TE>
<TE>   After interviewing more than 20 witnesses, investigators from the
district attorney's office concluded there was insufficient evidence
to link Hahn or his campaign to any illegal coordination with the
tribes.</TE>
<TE>   A four-page summary of their findings sent Wednesday to the Ethics
Commission also said that "the results of the investigation are
troubling." The report paints a picture of interlocking relationships
among key Hahn campaign officials, supporters like Weinstein and the
tribes.</TE>
<TE>   "The responses from those interviewed raises serious questions
about sometimes long-standing relationships between those in the Hahn
campaign with political supporters and volunteers," the report said.
"It also raises concerns about the California laws governing campaign
financing."</TE>
<TE>   State law prohibits independent expenditures from being
coordinated with a candidate or his or her campaign.</TE>
<TE>   There was an explosion in such independent expenditures during
last year's citywide races from Indian tribes, wealthy residents and
billboard companies. Hahn, Villaraigosa and Rocky Delgadillo, now
city attorney, were among the beneficiaries.</TE>
<TE>   Questions have routinely been raised about whether such efforts
are truly at arm's length, or whether they are coordinated with
campaigns as a tactic to avoid the limit on contributions in citywide
races.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said in an interview Wednesday that the state law is far
too vague about what constitutes coordination between those behind
independent expenditures and political campaign officials.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said loopholes in the law are so big you can "run a Mack
truck through them." He called on the state Legislature to tighten
the law.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation of the Indian expenditures was launched in June
after Villaraigosa alleged that expenditures by the Morongo Band of
Mission Indians, the Soboba Band of Mission Indians and the Santa
Ynez Band of Chumash Indians were coordinated by Weinstein, a
longtime friend and supporter of Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Those large contributions effectively allowed the Hahn campaign to
skirt city contribution limits, Villaraigosa's camp charged.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's report said, "All of those interviewed
denied that the campaign or Hahn had solicited the money spent on
anti-Villaraigosa advertisements and mailers."</TE>
<TE>   So, the report concluded: "Without evidence linking Hahn or
campaign staff members to the expenditures, violations of the law
cannot be proved."</TE>
<TE>   But Soboba tribal leaders told The Times in May that they and
other tribes were asked to contribute $100,000 each to the effort to
defeat Villaraigosa in the Los Angeles mayor's race.</TE>
<TE>   The request was made in a conference call by Weinstein, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's investigation confirmed that solicitation.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation also found evidence that another Hahn backer,
Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Sylmar), participated in a May 21
conference call to the tribal leaders, who assembled at the Coco's
restaurant on the Morongo reservation that day.</TE>
<TE>   The report says investigators found evidence that "Cardenas also
may have been involved in encouraging the three tribes to get
involved in the Los Angeles mayoral race, even though none of the
tribes are located in Los Angeles. "</TE>
<TE>   During that call, Cardenas said that "Weinstein would provide the
tribes with information on how to defeat Villaraigosa," the D.A.'s
report says.</TE>
<TE>   The assemblyman, who is currently running for Los Angeles City
Council, could not be reached for comment late Wednesday about the
call he allegedly made to the tribes late in the mayoral campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the mayor's race, Cardenas vehemently denied that he had
induced the Morongo tribe to pay for anti-Villaraigosa radio ads.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein, who held two fund-raisers for Hahn and made personal
contributions to his campaign, also could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said the Ethics Commission might be able to make a case
that campaign laws were violated because the standard for civil fines
is significantly lower than the "guilt beyond a reasonable doubt"
standard required in a criminal case.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Ann Pelham, executive director of the Ethics Commission, said
she had received the findings from the district attorney's
investigation. "We are reviewing it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen plenty of illustrations of the limits of state law
when it comes to making sure that independent expenditures are truly
independent," Pelham said. "This speaks to the need to find ways ...
to establish laws that draw brighter and clearer lines so these laws
can be enforced."</TE>
<TE>   The Ethics Commission requested the district attorney's assistance
because the panel's legal counsel is provided by the city attorney's
office, which at the time was headed by Hahn.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Water Demand Could Make Horses Get a Move On</HD>
<DH>Land use: River Trails stable in Orange, home to 200
animals, faces eviction as the district plans a reservoir on its 7.5
acres. The owner hopes to stay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Orange County Water District looks at its 7.5-acre spread
along the Santa Ana River, it sees a way to meet the water needs of a
new generation. Nancy Huffman looks at the same land and sees 200
soon-to-be-homeless horses--and the death of a lifelong dream.</LD>
<LD>   The water district has told Huffman that it is evicting her River
Trails stable in Orange to make way for a new water basin, meaning
that 200 horse owners will have to find another place to board their
animals. And that's not easy these days. The number of Orange County
boarding stables has dwindled to less than two dozen.</LD>
<LD>   Christine McGovern, spokeswoman for the Orange County Equestrian
Coalition, says there are 18 boarding stables remaining in the
county, housing 3,600 horses. Unaccounted for, however, are the
potentially thousands more animals boarded at smaller
facilities--often in backyards where zoning laws allow it. But most
facilities have long waiting lists.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a huge problem," said Jenny Jackson, whose company,
Steinberg Tack and Feed, provides hay and grain for many local
stables. "Thirty years ago, there were stables everywhere in Orange
County. Now they're all becoming condos or 7-Elevens."</TE>
<TE>   Or in the case of River Trails, a large water basin. The district
says it won't have the resources to keep up with population growth
over the next 20 years if it doesn't create new percolation
reservoirs to divert water from the Santa Ana River. The River Trails
property happens to be ideal, said water district spokeswoman Jenny
Glasser.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to find alternative locations to avoid closing the
stables," she said. "But our tests showed the soil at River Trails
was the most suitable to percolate water to the underground basin for
storage."</TE>
<TE>   Other test sites showed clay soil, she said, which makes it too
difficult for water to seep underground.</TE>
<TE>   River Trails has always had 10-year leases with the water
district. But its last 10-year lease was up in 1999. That was the
year the district created a master plan through 2020, showing new
basins were essential.</TE>
<TE>   The district that year granted Huffman a one-year extension, then
approved additional one-year extensions in 2000 and 2001. But last
fall, she was told that she'd have to move out by October 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "She's had fair warning," Glasser said. "We are sympathetic, but
we're talking about the water needs of a growing population."</TE>
<TE>   At its meeting Wednesday, the board expected an update from
Huffman about her progress in finding another location. What it got
instead was a plea from Huffman and about 80 other horse lovers that
she be allowed to stay.</TE>
<TE>   Veterinarian David Treser told board members that given the
district's nationwide reputation for being able to reclaim water, it
can surely come up with alternatives that could spare River Trails.</TE>
<TE>   "If River Trails is closed, I'm doubtful that many of these people
can find alternative stable space," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Horse owner Barry Kerns of Yorba Linda, who has boarded his horse
at River Trails for 13 years, told the board that the stable is more
than just a place to keep a horse.</TE>
<TE>   "[It] has become a part of our culture, where friendships have
been formed, where we've partied together, we've even held weddings
there," Kerns said. "To the water district, this is just a few acres
near the riverbed; to us, this is a big part of our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Maile Bennett, spokeswoman for the Orange County 4-H Council, said
that for many years, River Trails has provided a place for young 4-H
members to get their equestrian merit badges. "Closing it down would
be closing down a vital need for our young people," she said.</TE>
<TE>   River Trails client Debbie Carr told the board, "These horses are
our pets and our partners. For some of us, closing the stables would
force us to abandon our hobby."</TE>
<TE>   Huffman and the others don't believe that the water district has
done adequate testing at other sites. But the district counters that
its tests have been extensive.</TE>
<TE>   Several at the meeting praised Huffman for her struggle to keep
the facility open. But it's more than a business to her: She's
devoted her life to it.</TE>
<TE>   When Huffman was a youngster, she'd ride her bicycle seven miles
from her Fullerton home to River Trails. While she loved riding
horses, she was mainly consumed with just hanging out with horse
people.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of little girls give up horses when they discover boys," she
said. "I stayed with the horses."</TE>
<TE>   She loved the place so much that in 1989, she and her husband,
Rob, a horse trainer, bought it. Huffman said it was a dream for
them, one they expected to continue forever.</TE>
<TE>   But Rob Huffman died last September of colon cancer. And soon
after that, Huffman got the news that she'd get no more lease
extensions from the water district.</TE>
<TE>   Huffman said she's looked at other sites but cannot find anything
comparable that she can afford.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, I'd ... empty my life savings if there was another
place," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Fees at River Trails range from $215 to $265 monthly. Horses are
fed at 3:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., and their enclosures are cleaned
daily. Huffman's three lighted arenas are kept busy at night, when
the owners come to ride their horses after work. By day, many ride
their horses along the Santa Ana River trail.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, Huffman said, Orange County is simply not as horse-friendly
as it used to be. Many owners are forced to find stable space in
Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame, because it builds character in children to work
with horses, and teaches them discipline," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't want to live next to horses anymore," she added.
"They think a stables is all dust and flies, and that's not true at
all."</TE>
<TE>   Some see the only solution coming through public-private
partnerships, as is done at the El Toro Equestrian Center at the
former Marine base under an arrangement with the county. In
Huntington Beach, the city leases property at Central Park to a
private equestrian corporation that boards more than 400 horses.</TE>
<TE>   "Land in Orange County has simply become too valuable to use it
for horses," said Mary Warren, who runs the Huntington Beach Central
Park Equestrian Center. "Without a city or the Board of Supervisors
getting involved, it's almost impossible to come up with new stable
space."</TE>
<TE>   River Trails is just the latest stable to face an uncertain
future. Rancho Del Rio Stables in Anaheim recently received an
eviction notice from its landlord, the city, though it now appears
that there's a chance for a short-term reprieve. Still, owners Bob
and Jane Jones know that eventually they will have to move.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim spokesman John Nicoletti said the city staff was concerned
that Rancho Del Rio wasn't compatible with area businesses. Also,
staff members wanted the stables' space for much-needed convention
center parking spillover.</TE>
<TE>   But when the Joneses appealed to the city to reconsider, staff
officials agreed to look for ways to accommodate them. Although the
eviction notice is still on the table for May, the staff will
recommend at the next City Council meeting that the Joneses be given
temporary extensions that could last as long as five years.</TE>
<TE>   But after that, it appears that Rancho Del Rio will join the
expanding list of closed stables.</TE>
<TE>   "Closing a stables is like losing a city park," said Jane Jones.
"The city would lose something that gives it balance." The Joneses
are also supportive of Huffman, whom they consider a good neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   What will Huffman do if she loses?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to lose," she said grimly.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to operate River Trails, right here. I just know it."</TE>

<HD>Messy Affair Plays Out Atop a Famed Rock</HD>
<DH>A Native American holds rituals there. But activists and
another tribe say visits threaten peregrine falcons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Born with a caul and pale-blue eyes, John Burch was always seen as
different by his Native American family. He was just 3, he says, when
his grandmothers led him up a steep trail to a summit thought to have
great mystical power.</LD>
<LD>   In the lore of his people, it was called Lesamo, where the Falcon
of ancient legend killed the serpent Teleekatapelta. Craggy and
dome-shaped, and often shrouded in fog, the dominant landmark of the
Central California beachfront is more widely known as Morro Rock.</LD>
<LD>   Up top sit a stone altar and throne that his grandmothers helped
him build, Burch says. And in recent years, on dates prescribed by
the heavens, Burch has again climbed the 576-foot-high rock in Morro
Bay to practice rituals handed down by elders of his Salinan tribe.
He is alone all night in blackness and starlight.</LD>
<TE>   "A perfect hallway of isolation," Burch, 52, calls the spot where
he enters an altered state and asks for spiritual guidance. "There's
suffering involved. It's cold. It's dark. It's treacherous."</TE>
<TE>   His throne is upholstered in moss and lichen. He says he finishes
the night of prayer feeling like he's "floating on air. It's
euphoria. It's peace."</TE>
<TE>   The solitary rituals have not fostered much euphoria among
environmental groups, however. The top of Morro Rock is a nesting
ground for the peregrine falcon, a species once nearly wiped out by
DDT poisoning. Normally it is forbidden to hikers and climbers.</TE>
<TE>   Nor has Burch created any peace between the Salinan and Chumash
Indians, tribes engaged in a bitter dispute. Each claims Morro Rock
as a sacred spot.</TE>
<TE>   The tale is messy and the details seem to differ with the teller.
But about three years ago, Burch sought a permit to conduct his
rituals atop the state-owned rock and was granted one despite the
area being declared a falcon sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   "It's broadly the policy of the department to allow reasonable
requests for religious practices to take place on state park
property," says Joe Mette, a district superintendent for the
California Department of Parks and Recreation, who approved Burch's
request. "He made some fairly compelling arguments. He said
biologists go up there--and they handle the eggs. He said, 'I won't
be anywhere near the nests.' He didn't intend to harm the birds in
any way."</TE>
<TE>   Burch said he has been able to use the permit only two or three
times. The rituals are usually conducted during an equinox or
solstice. Burch had just finished such a ritual and was descending
the rock one foggy morning, he recalls, when he was spotted by a
member of the Audubon Society.</TE>
<TE>   That person alerted the rival Chumash leadership. Elders met and
brought political pressure to revoke Burch's permit.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very upset," says Rhonda Vigil, whose husband, Mark, is
chief of the Chumash tribe's San Luis Obispo County Council. "This is
Chumash territory. It's a sacred shrine to us."</TE>
<TE>   Historic evidence suggests the Chumash held rites atop Morro Rock
for centuries, but the tribe has deliberately avoided the summit in
recent decades because of the falcons, according to Tarren Collins,
an attorney for the Chumash who also heads a local chapter of the
Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many places you can hold ceremonies," Collins says.
"You don't have to interfere with nesting peregrines."</TE>
<TE>   Collins says she and several tribal elders, including Mark and
Rhonda Vigil, stood watch at the landmark during the summer solstice
of 2000 to prevent Burch from going up. Yet the conflict simmers.</TE>
<TE>   Not long ago, Burch led a small group of Salinans in a
winter-solstice ceremony at the base of the rock--outside the
protected area--but he vows to seek a new permit to return to a holy
summit he considers irreplaceable. The altitude creates a sense of
solitude that opens a spiritual door, he says. It fulfills him and
makes him whole.</TE>
<TE>   Morro Rock, a volcanic plug formed 21 million years ago, has a
grandeur many find difficult to describe. The peak, sometimes called
the Gibraltar of the Pacific, is one of the Seven Sisters, a row of
volcanic mounds reaching a dozen miles from San Luis Obispo to the
sea. Others are larger, but Morro Rock rests right at the water's
edge, dominating the harbor of Morro Bay.</TE>
<TE>   The Portuguese explorer Juan Cabrillo saw the rock and named it in
1542--for a word meaning round hill. The name does it justice only
from a distance. Up close it is immense, complex and
chiseled-looking, as if some god had gouged out half of a Yosemite
cliff and dropped it on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   The rock offers, as John Updike once wrote of an old ballpark, "a
compromise between Man's Euclidean determinations and Nature's
beguiling irregularities." It has visible strata and veins etched
with lichen, angled faces chipped and eroding, jumbled boulders
caulked with dirt and grass. It is painted by the sun and sky and
seems to change all day--becoming rosy and gray and, finally, at
dusk, a black silhouette.</TE>
<TE>   "When Morro Bay gets fogged in, there's like this halo that comes
over Morro Rock," says one nearby resident. "It has this presence
about it."</TE>
<TE>   That remains the case even though quarrying in the first half of
the 20th century removed about a third of the rock's
surface--material used to build breakwaters. People who know little
of the rock's history feel beckoned by it. It conveys a force, says
Laurel Day, who recalls the sense of mystery she felt when seeing it
for the first time on a family trip in the late 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me feel less stressed just looking at it," she says. "I
could stare at that rock all day long. I'm sure it was a sacred spot
for the Indians--it's got to have been."</TE>
<TE>   And still is. But a solution to the John Burch controversy appears
doubtful any time soon. Not even the state can decide who should call
the shots.</TE>
<TE>   Two separate agencies are involved--the parks department, which
oversees the land, and the Department of Fish and Game, which runs
the sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's the final authority going to rest?" wonders Mette, the
parks official. "Is Fish and Game going to represent the birds? Or
will parks ... look after the human side?"</TE>
<TE>   He can't say.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the embarrassing part."</TE>

<HD>Bamieh's Ads Misleading, Totten Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Turning up the heat in the Ventura County district attorney's race,
candidate Greg Totten accused his opponent Wednesday of misleading
voters by exaggerating his trial experience in a barrage of radio and
television ads.</LD>
<LD>   It is an assertion Totten has made before.</LD>
<LD>   This time, the 47-year-old second-in-command of the district
attorney's office did so at a noon news conference, flanked by 30
prosecutors whose association endorsed him earlier this week.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it is necessary to get the true record to the voters,"
Totten said. "The public needs to know."</TE>
<TE>   Totten and his supporters say Ron Bamieh, 36, who has spent nine
years in the district attorney's office, falsely contends in ads to
be the county's "most experienced prosecutor" and one who "has never
lost a felony case."</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh defended his record Wednesday and suggested that Totten was
getting desperate with only a month to go before the March 5 primary.</TE>
<TE>   "Greg Totten's press conference today is a good indication that
his campaign is failing," Bamieh said. "His charges are old, untrue
and unfair. In this election, I am the most experienced prosecutor
running, and no matter how many cronies he can get to stand next to
him, it will not change that."</TE>
<TE>   The two prosecutors are locked in a bitter and high-priced
campaign to replace retiring Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, who
will step down in January after six consecutive four-year terms.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Bamieh has spent $490,000--most of it donated by his
father--to sway county voters. In early November, he launched a
$50,000 media blitz, buying radio spots and ads on five cable TV
channels.</TE>
<TE>   Totten and his supporters contend those ads give voters the wrong
impression of Bamieh's qualifications.</TE>
<TE>   "The danger is people will believe him," said Pete Kossoris, a
semi-retired prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   Kossoris was one of three prosecutors who spoke during Wednesday's
news conference. All described Totten, who has spent nearly 20 years
in the D.A.'s office, as a proven leader and their choice to run the
office with a $40-million budget and 600 employees.</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Frawley attacked
Bamieh's claims that he has never lost a felony case. In 1995, Bamieh
prosecuted a man charged with false imprisonment. The jury deadlocked
and the case was dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   "That is not a win," Totten said. "That is a loss."</TE>
<TE>   But Bamieh said the defendant was jailed on a probation violation
by the judge after the case was dismissed. If the intent is to send
the defendant to jail and he goes to jail, Bamieh said, "that's a
victory."</TE>
<TE>   Controversy over Bamieh's trial record erupted in November when
ads hit the airwaves contending that "in over 60 cases, he has never
lost a felony trial."</TE>
<TE>   According to records provided to The Times by the district
attorney's office, Bamieh has prosecuted 20 felony trials--18 before
a jury and two before a judge--that resulted in guilty verdicts.</TE>
<TE>   But Bamieh contends that those statistics are incomplete and do
not include at least 50 felony cases he took through preliminary
hearings.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, he called his opponent's accusation "pathetic" and
an example of negative campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   "It is sad that they are resorting to this," he said.</TE>

<HD>Now Sunrise Service May Not Be Televised at All</HD>
<DH>Easter: The withdrawal of Trinity Broadcasting leaves too
little time to find a network, says the group that traditionally
stages the event. Rights to the show were decided by a controversial
coin flip.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The worldwide Trinity Broadcasting Network's abrupt withdrawal from
next month's Easter pageant at the Hollywood Bowl means there will
probably be no televised coverage of the annual sunrise service,
event planners conceded Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   There is not enough time now to arrange for even a local
broadcast, said leaders of Hollywood Bowl Easter Sunrise Service
Inc., which regained control over the pageant.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County-based TBN said late Tuesday that it was scrapping
its plans to produce the March 31 service and televise it
internationally. TBN officials cited bad publicity from an ongoing
dispute with its longtime sponsor, the nonprofit Hollywood Bowl
Easter Sunrise Service Inc., as the reason for the pullout.</LD>
<TE>   TBN won rights to stage the pageant when it beat out the civic
group in a controversial Jan. 25 coin toss conducted by the Los
Angeles Philharmonic Assn., which manages the Bowl for Los Angeles
County.</TE>
<TE>   The coin toss angered the sunrise-service group, which contends
its predecessors built the Hollywood Bowl and later turned it over to
the county in exchange for permission to use it annually for Easter
services. When the group announced its intention to file a lawsuit
Wednesday, aimed at regaining Easter use of the Bowl, TBN officials
stepped aside.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the Philharmonic association, TBN President Paul F.
Crouch said he had no desire to become "an unwilling victim of false
accusations, lascivious innuendo and the whirlwind of negative
reporting in the media" that has accompanied the dispute in recent
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The sunrise-service group's plan to file a lawsuit confronted TBN
with "two choices: fight back hard or turn the other cheek," said
network spokesman Colby May in an official statement.</TE>
<TE>   "It has chosen the latter . . . in the hope that no one is
distracted from the true meaning of Easter: salvation, hope and
eternal life through the loving sacrifice of Christ Jesus on the
cross for all of us," May said.</TE>
<TE>   Philharmonic association officials immediately reassigned the
Easter service to Hollywood Bowl Easter Sunrise Service Inc.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, leaders of the group were scrambling to resume
preparing for this year's pageant. They said they will announce its
guest lineup on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the sunrise-service group is working to make up
the about $35,000 shortfall caused when fund-raising efforts were
delayed because of the fight with TBN, group president Norma Foster
said.</TE>
<TE>   Foster pledged that this year's program will go on just like it
has in past years--except for the television coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "A broadcast will be very difficult at this point. You need three
months just to get a listing in the TV Guide," Foster said.</TE>
<TE>   Waivers would have to be negotiated with various broadcast unions
and "some station would have to take away two hours of commercial
time they have already sold."</TE>
<TE>   She said the broadcast picture could improve if a television
company with the ability to turn things around quickly somehow
materializes.</TE>
<TE>   Could that be TBN? Considered the world's largest religious
broadcaster with 2,500 affiliates in about 100 countries connected by
satellite, the network often airs programming produced by others.</TE>
<TE>   TBN's May characterized the absence of a televised sunrise service
this year as "the strangest irony I can imagine." But he said he
cannot imagine TBN stepping in now to bail out Foster's group.</TE>
<TE>   Foster, meantime, said her organization plans to "stand guard at
the gate" to prevent TBN from taking over the service next year.</TE>

<LD>Hundreds of people flocked to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library

president.</LD>
<LD>   The festivities included the dedication and planting ceremony of
20 cherry trees as well as a martial arts demonstration and several
cakes.</LD>
<LD>   Reagan, who announced in 1994 that he has Alzheimer's disease, no
longer makes public appearances. However, his wife, Nancy, sent the
presidential library her regards in a letter.</LD>
<TE>   With this birthday, Reagan becomes the only president to live to
be 91 years old. Presidents John Adams and Herbert Hoover each died
at the age of 90.</TE>

<HD>3 Suspects Held in Beer Truck Heist</HD>
<DH>Crime: Hijacked at an intersection, the driver was later
freed. Most of the cargo disappeared.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three men have been arrested in Riverside County on suspicion of
hijacking a beer truck in Orange last week and stealing most of its
cargo, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Booked into Orange County Jail were Apolinio Alvarez, 40, of Santa
Ana; Fausto Flores, 25; and Heron Telon Jr., 21, both of Perris.</LD>
<LD>   The three were arrested early Tuesday after detectives and a
Riverside County sheriff's SWAT team, alerted by several calls from
residents, raided two houses, one in the Mead Valley area near Perris
and one in Corona.</LD>
<TE>   About 30% of the 300 cases of beer that had been stolen were
recovered from the Mead Valley house, said Sgt. Bryan Meissner, a
spokesman for the Orange Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   The three are accused of involvement in the Jan. 29 hijacking of a
Budweiser delivery truck that was driven through two counties before
being released, along with its unharmed driver, four hours later in
San Bernardino. Police said a man had forced his way into the truck's
cab shortly after 9:15 a.m. while the driver was stopped at an
intersection.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are still looking for two more suspects as well as a
gold 2002 Chrysler 300M with tinted windows believed to be involved
in the heist, Meissner said.</TE>

<HD>Mother Held for Abandoning Infant</HD>
<DH>Birth: Police trace the 26-year-old West Hills woman
through a store sales receipt found in a shopping bag with the
newborn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sales receipt led police to a 26-year-old West Hills woman who they
believe abandoned her newborn boy in a shopping bag outside a
hospital, authorities said on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Police arrested Rosemary Gutierrez, who is expected to be charged
today with child endangerment, said Det. Lisa Lawson of the Los
Angeles Police Department's West Valley division.</LD>
<LD>   "She admitted giving birth to the child, but said she was
unprepared to raise him at this time," Lawson said of Gutierrez, who
also has a 6-year-old daughter.</LD>
<TE>   A nurse found the baby in a Robinsons-May shopping bag about 10
p.m. Monday in the employee parking lot of the West Hills Hospital
and Medical Center, Lawson said.</TE>
<TE>   The state's year-old safe haven law, which allows a parent to
leave an infant in a hospital emergency room within 72 hours of birth
with no fear of prosecution, does not apply in this case because the
infant was abandoned outside, Lawson said.</TE>
<TE>   The child, who was in good condition, was wrapped in two towels
during the nine hours or more that he was in the bag.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives traced a department store receipt found in the bag to
Gutierrez's mother, Lawson said. At the woman's house, where
Gutierrez and her daughter live, detectives found evidence that a
birth had taken place within 48 hours, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez's mother told police she did not know her daughter had
given birth. Some neighbors said they did not know she was pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   "She looked like she was getting bigger, but she never mentioned
being pregnant," said Brian Davis, who lives across the street.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez was arrested about 9 p.m. Tuesday after telling police
she had given birth to the child, Lawson said. She is being held in
lieu of $50,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   The dark-haired, 7-pound baby boy was in the custody of the county
Department of Children and Family Services at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The baby sleeps, eats and shows off his dimples under the watch of
the teddy bears at either end of his tiny incubator.</TE>
<TE>   "He's more of a social butterfly than an eater," said nurse Lisa
Raymond.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteer groups have showered the infant with gifts, including a
cream-colored, hand-crocheted blanket and a blue plaid outfit.</TE>

<HD>District Disqualifies Belmont Bidder</HD>
<DH>Education: A review found that an Eastridge Cos. employee
had insider information. The firm's chief denies any improprieties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of three developers competing to complete the Los Angeles Unified
School District's $200-million Belmont Learning Complex was
disqualified Wednesday after a district review determined that a
company employee had access to inside information.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles schools Supt. Roy Romer announced the decision during
an interview about the internal review that found that a real estate
consultant on other district projects, Jeff Baize of the Eastridge
Cos., worked on that firm's bid for the Belmont project.</LD>
<LD>   Romer's decision comes only days before he was scheduled to
recommend one of the three bidders to the Board of Education to take
on the complicated task of mitigating environmental problems at the
incomplete high school and then finish construction.</LD>
<TE>   The contract will be worth tens of millions of dollars to make the
school, which is located on part of a defunct oil field near
downtown, safe for 5,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not sending forward the bid" from Eastridge, Romer said
Wednesday. He said the rejection of Eastridge's proposal stemmed from
deficiencies in its plan and "a potential conflict of interest or
perceived conflict of interest."</TE>
<TE>   Eastridge principal Susan Eastridge said she was stunned by the
district's decision and denied the report's allegations that her firm
had an unfair advantage.</TE>
<TE>   She said that she previously had told district officials about
Baize's activities on the Belmont bid proposal and had been assured
that Eastridge would remain eligible.</TE>
<TE>   She said that district officials told her that "each and every
bidder [for the Belmont project] has potential conflicts of interest"
and that Eastridge was no more culpable than the others.</TE>
<TE>   The report criticized the district for lacking written
conflict-of-interest policies, something Romer conceded may need
"tightening up."</TE>
<TE>   The report issued on Jan. 30 by the district's office of inspector
general focuses on Baize's activities since he was retained in June
to help identify possible school sites in the San Fernando Valley.
About 20 other Eastridge property consultants also aided the
district's real estate division.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Scot Graham, then director of the district's real
estate division, learned that Eastridge was preparing to compete for
the Belmont project.</TE>
<TE>   Graham was concerned that Baize would have access to proprietary
information and initiated an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Baize was taken off the real estate search contract, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   District investigators found e-mail, letters and other documents
in Baize's district office regarding the Belmont project and the
value of its land, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Baize said he did not have access to proprietary
information and that papers investigators found were public records.</TE>
<TE>   He said he did not begin working in earnest on the Belmont project
until after he left the district contract.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about a computer file investigators that found with
Belmont in its title, Baize said: "Many people on that floor had
access to that file. You know, I don't know what file was on that
computer, I didn't have exclusive use to it."</TE>
<TE>   Baize was singled out, according to the report, because his
co-workers had told Graham that he had shown "an inordinate amount of
interest" in Belmont and because Baize had experience with such
complex projects.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said he decided over the past two days to act to avoid
tainting the selection process.</TE>
<TE>   He said Eastridge's disqualification did not hinder the project
substantially.</TE>
<TE>   "We have two very good bids," he said, referring to the remaining
developers, Alliance for a Better Community and Komex.</TE>
<TE>   Board President Caprice Young said the investigation showed that
the school system has learned the importance of "due diligence" after
Belmont's history of litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Work was halted on the campus in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Eastridge executives said that they spent as much as $500,000 on
their proposal and that they plan to call for a full district
investigation into the grounds for their rejection.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles City Controller Laura Chick called on other city
officials Wednesday to remove the concrete barricades encircling City
Hall, calling them ineffective and a drain on city resources.</LD>
<LD>   The barricades were put in place around the Civic Center complex
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. They block access to the
streets around City Hall and force pedestrians through a narrow
opening as they approach the building.</LD>
<LD>   Julie Wong, a spokeswoman for Mayor James K. Hahn, said the mayor
supports making the public buildings more accessible, and is still
studying the matter of what to do with the barricades.</LD>

<LD>Children's programs at four Los Angeles Jewish community centers
slated for closure this summer could remain open another year if the
centers meet strict enrollment and fund-raising goals, organization
officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Jewish Community Centers of Greater Los Angeles announced plans in
December to terminate the after-school, kindergarten and preschool
programs on June 30 to make up for a financial shortfall. The sites
included North Valley in Granada Hills, Valley Cities in Sherman
Oaks, Silver Lake-Los Feliz and Los Angeles' Westside.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the centers' board of directors announced a business
plan, crafted with local community center leaders, to boost
enrollment and revenues that could keep the children's program afloat
through June 2003.</LD>

<LD>A coalition of Latino advocacy groups has released maps proposing new
district boundaries for Los Angeles Unified School District board
members that would return two seats exclusively to the San Fernando
Valley and create a Latino stronghold east of the San Diego Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The maps will be presented to the City Council Redistricting
Commission, which will send its recommendations to the full council
by March 1. The council will vote on the proposal by July 1.</LD>
<LD>   The last boundary changes, in 1992, resulted in one seat entirely
in the Valley and three others representing parts of the Valley.</LD>

<LD>A Calabasas landscaping contractor who forced his predominantly

<LD>The Los Angeles city attorney's office recommended Wednesday that the

<LD>   Assistant City Atty. Fred Merkin made the recommendation to the
City Council's Budget Committee. The full council on Friday will
decide whether to seek the controller's review.</LD>
<LD>   The review would cost the city $300,000. The financial study,
conducted by the Local Agency Formation Commission, found that the
Valley and Harbor could be fiscally healthy as breakaway cities.</LD>
<TE>   Councilman Nick Pacheco, the committee chairman, said he wants a
controller review. "Anything that can help provide clarity and
accurate numbers is something I support," Pacheco said.</TE>

city life in his seminal 1965 memoir, "Manchild in the Promised
Land," died Saturday in New York City from a lung condition. He was
64.</LD>
<LD>   In a forthright, dignified voice, Brown cast a stark light on an
urban America at the boiling point--street fighters, thieves, junkies
and guns: a population at wits' end. Drawing on his experiences as a
black youth toughened by Harlem streets, Brown detailed inner city
landscapes that were shaped by the consequences of violence and
poverty. His sharp portrayal swept away the vague depictions of urban
life that had come before.</LD>
<LD>   "Manchild" sold more than 4 million copies and was translated into
14 languages, ultimately becoming required reading at high schools
and colleges across the country. It arrived at a crucial juncture in
American social history, in the midst of the civil rights revolution
and the dawning of the black pride movement.</LD>
<TE>   "It was in the tradition of classic narratives like [those of]
Frederick Douglass and Malcolm X," said writer and activist Amiri
Baraka. "In fact, 'Manchild' arrived at the same time as Malcolm X's
autobiography, and I think that they were both testaments of the kind
of rage we were seeing in Watts, Detroit and Newark. The rage of the
working class and poor black people. It was illumination for those
who didn't know it. And confirmation for those who needed it. It was
as if, if the fire could talk, this is what he would say."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Harlem, Brown was the son of a railroad worker and a
domestic, who, like many black families during the great
South-to-North migration, left South Carolina for the "promised land"
of New York in the early 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   What awaited them, however, was a string of social horrors and
slender opportunities. Growing up in a tenement on 146th Street,
Brown was swept into the undercurrent of the street. Kicked out of
school at 8, he was caught up in gang life by 9. Shot in the leg
during a robbery, by 14 he was shipped off to reform school.</TE>
<TE>   There, he impressed Ernest Papanek, psychologist and director of
the Wiltwyck School for deprived and emotionally disturbed boys in
Ulster County, N.Y., who lured him into the world of books.</TE>
<TE>   With that, Brown's path shifted dramatically. A series of
part-time jobs saw him through night school and a high school
diploma. Moving to Washington, D.C., he enrolled in classes at Howard
University.</TE>
<TE>   During his freshman year, he was asked to write an article for
Dissent magazine, referred by his old mentor, Papanek. The article,
raw and immediate, caught the attention of a New York editor at
Macmillan who promptly offered him a $2,000 advance for what would
eventually evolve into "Manchild."</TE>
<TE>   Reviewing the book in the Los Angeles Times in July 1965, William
Mathes called Brown's slightly fictionalized autobiography "a book
hot with the words and problems of contemporary America, but brimming
with the kind of humanistically based compassion and feeling that
will speak to many generations to come .... It will be read by those
interested in sharing the life of a stubborn, courageous, magnificent
young human being .... Here is what it feels like to grow up in
Harlem, what it is to grow into a manhood defined by drugs, theft,
prostitution and murder. And Claude Brown re-defines his manhood as
he goes, as he searches for an identity strong enough to survive in
the world he finds himself."</TE>
<TE>   In the years after his book's success, Brown kept his focus on the
core racial and social issues that inhabited "Manchild," this time in
real world settings. He was graduated from Howard in 1965, attended
law school at Stanford and Rutgers, and flirted with the notion of
public life.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his life, what motivated and consumed him was the world
of politics and social change, at the grass-roots level and beyond.
He looked for opportunities to render marginalized communities and
sway opinion--often lecturing and writing articles and essays to help
illuminate the inequalities and inadequacies still plaguing
communities of color in urban settings.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's work was part of a continuum, said Thomas Porter, former
dean of Afro-American studies at Ohio University.</TE>
<TE>   "Richard Wright wrote about his experiences in Mississippi in
'Black Boy.' James Baldwin certainly talked [about] his experience in
Harlem," Porter said. "But Claude was young himself, and his book was
close to the bone, because Claude had not been too far removed from
the things that he wrote about.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, Baldwin was in the 'hood, but he wasn't 'Boyz in the
'Hood'--in and out of institutions and then overcoming," he added.
"That's what young black men were experiencing. And it wasn't
documented in the way it was lived."</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, Brown published "Children of Ham," which followed a group
of Harlem teenagers trying to elude heroin's hold. The book suffered
critically and couldn't emerge from the broad shadow of "Manchild" a
decade before.</TE>
<TE>   In later years, Brown lectured on urban issues and was a frequent
op-ed page contributor.</TE>
<TE>   "Now America's inner cities have become the spawning grounds for
adolescents who bear increasingly appalling resemblances to rabid,
homicidal maniacs," Brown reflected in the Los Angeles Times in 1988.
"They are acting out slaughterous action scenes from the most
barbarous gangster movies on the streets of major American cities in
real life, in living color."</TE>
<TE>   Though he left New York in the '70s, settling in Newark, N.J.,
Brown maintained his emotional connection to Harlem. His final book,
which contrasted the lives of children growing up in 1980s Harlem
with those in his Harlem of the past, was never completed.</TE>
<TE>   Brown's commitment to social justice, and his authentic voice,
said Porter, are what will continue to resonate. "I love 'Catcher in
the Rye,' but Claude's book was Holden Caulfield for African
Americans," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a book of its time in its heat. And it came in a moment
where there was a big redefinition of community control of schools in
Harlem. I was teaching junior high school and training urban
teachers, and I was teaching Claude Browns and Claudine Browns every
day--the kids we were trying to reach."</TE>
<TE>   The writer's marriage to Helen Brown ended in divorce. He is
survived by his companion, Laura Higgins; a daughter, Denise Brown
Hallum of Burtonsville, Md.; and a son, Nathaniel of Boston.</TE>

<HD>Two Teens Sentenced in Attack</HD>
<DH>Crime: Three others also have court dates after the rapes
and beatings in an Orange County canyon.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Orange County teenagers were sentenced to lengthy terms in the
California Youth Authority on Wednesday after admitting their roles
in a late-night attack on two young couples in Black Star Canyon.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors consider Phu Quoc Tran and Veruk Kim the least
culpable of the five suspects charged with repeatedly raping two
girls, ages 13 and 15, and beating their boyfriends with a metal rod
on July 3.</LD>
<LD>   Tran, 15, and Kim, 17, were sentenced to more than 17 years in
custody, but they can't be held beyond their 25th birthdays. In a
plea bargain, prosecutors dropped efforts to prosecute the boys as
adults.</LD>
<TE>   Three other suspects charged as adults are awaiting prosecution.
Tran and Kim could be called as witnesses to testify against the
remaining suspects, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Before Wednesday's sentencing, Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Levy read
letters from the victims to Judge Joy W. Markman. One of the rape
victims said the attacks left her doomed to a "lifetime of pain."</TE>
<TE>   Levy said he thought the sentences were fair, keeping in mind the
two suspects' role in the crime and their lack of criminal records.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a fair and just thing for all sides," Levy said.</TE>
<TE>   If the pair testify in the trials for the other suspects and
perjure themselves, the plea bargain could be withdrawn and they
could face longer sentences, Levy said.</TE>

<LD>   California again is leading the nation. Yes, we're No. 1. On March
5, we will be the first this year to hold a state primary election.</LD>
<LD>   It's no honor. Nobody's celebrating. Many people don't even
realize there'll be an election, judging by all the "undecideds" in
polls.</LD>
<TE>   "No one is focused on the election at all," says state Sen. Ross
Johnson (R-Irvine). "And I'm talking about fairly sophisticated
people. I was at a Chamber of Commerce annual dinner, and people
you'd characterize as community leaders were saying, 'Oh, god, that's
coming up?' "</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda), chairman of the Senate Elections and
Reapportionment Committee, says: "There is not a single thing to
recommend a March primary. This is just silly."</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Republican analyst Tony Quinn did some checking and found
that California's primary is the first this year. Texas follows a
week later, then Illinois a week after that. But no other state has a
primary until May. A dozen are in June. The biggest primary day is
Sept. 10, with 10 states holding elections.</TE>
<TE>   There's a move to push California's primary to September--or at
least to June--and hold a separate, early presidential primary every
four years.</TE>
<TE>   California used to have a very comfortable June primary. The days
were long and balmy, the weather right for convertibles and outdoor
rallies.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's the dead of winter. Only candidates and their cronies are
thinking politics. We've just come through the holidays and the Super
Bowl. Next up is the Olympics. Then it's tax time.</TE>
<TE>   So whose bright idea was this?</TE>
<TE>   This you can blame on Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Let's back up: Both parties wanted to move up the presidential
primary to gain clout in the nominating process. They were sick of
watching candidates kowtow to pipsqueak New Hampshire.</TE>
<TE>   California tried a late March primary in 1996, and it had
virtually no impact. In 2000, the primary was moved to early March,
with marginal effect; George Bush clinched the GOP nomination here.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1996 and 2000, the Legislature had to pass another bill
moving up the presidential primary from June. Secretary of State Bill
Jones and Sen. Jim Costa (D-Fresno) pressed hard in 1998 and pushed a
measure through the Senate. It would have provided a March primary
only in presidential years. In "off-years"--like 2002--there'd be a
June primary.</TE>
<TE>   But in the Assembly, some Democrats got clever. They got the
bright idea of insisting that all primary elections be permanently
moved to early March. Why? Because Democrats were plotting a defense
of their once-a-decade redrawing of legislative and congressional
districts in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   An early 2002 primary would not leave Republicans much time to
mount a referendum campaign against a Democratic gerrymander. And
even if they could, the entire primary would be thrown into chaos. A
court would quickly have to decide which districts the candidates
should run in--the old or the newly drawn. The GOP would risk a
political train wreck.</TE>
<TE>   Jones recalls it vividly: "Democrats wanted to put the squeeze on
Republicans and not give us time to referendum a reapportionment."</TE>
<TE>   But Jones accepted the Assembly amendment, figuring the state
primary eventually could be moved back to June. Gov. Pete Wilson went
along because he still dreamed of running for president in 2000 and
an early home-state primary would help.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't work out the way either party expected," Quinn notes.
"The March primary has been a disaster."</TE>
<TE>   Everything became moot.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson didn't run.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush White House asked Republicans to compromise with
Democrats on a "status quo" redistricting plan that would assure
retention of 20 GOP congressional seats. That likely would clinch
continued GOP control of the U.S. House. In return, Democrats locked
up control of the state Legislature for many years.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Republicans had no interest in a referendum--and were
too broke anyway.</TE>
<TE>   But voters are stuck with this early primary.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson intends to introduce a bill to hold a separate, early
presidential primary and a state primary in September.</TE>
<TE>   The state Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable are getting
behind the September primary move. They think it's good political
reform: The campaign season is condensed and the shortened races
require less special interest money to fund.</TE>
<TE>   Voters pay more attention.</TE>
<TE>   Myself, I'm nostalgic for June. But post-Labor Day would be better
than pre-St. Pat's.</TE>
<TE>   On this, we just don't ever again want to be No. 1.</TE>

<HD>Child Care Costs Found to Be a Rising Burden</HD>
<DH>Study: The expense rivals housing for some working parents,
group says. Demand for high-quality centers remains unfilled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rising child care costs have become so onerous that they rival annual
spending for housing and college tuition for many California working
families, a study released Wednesday concludes.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the shortage of licensed child care spots has
made it more difficult to find high-quality care, according to the
2001 California Child Care Portfolio, a biannual report issued by the
nonprofit California Child Care Resource &amp; Referral Network.</LD>
<LD>   The average annual cost of full-time day care for an infant or
toddler is $8,521 and represents more than 20% of the state's $42,472
median income, according to the study.</LD>
<TE>   The figure is $375 more than the statewide average fair market
rent for a two-bedroom apartment and double the annual tuition at UC
Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   The number of licensed child care slots in the state--886,871--
met only about 22% of the estimated demand in 2000, the year for
which data were collected.</TE>
<TE>   Many children are cared for by relatives, friends, neighbors or
nannies who are not required to have a license, despite evidence that
the quality of care can make an enormous difference in a child's
development.</TE>
<TE>   Patty Siegel, executive director of the Network, an association of
agencies in the state's 58 counties that help parents find child
care, said many families' situations may have gotten worse in the
weakened economy. The study was done "in the best of times, when the
economy was booming. What are the implications for the worst of
times?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   While scraping up money for child care costs is a burden for
families of moderate means, it becomes a Herculean task for
low-income families.</TE>
<TE>   The study found, for example, that the cost of putting two
children in full-time licensed child care could consume the entire
annual earnings of a full-time worker earning the state's minimum
wage of $11,960.</TE>
<TE>   The average annual cost of putting just one infant in full-time
care runs as high as $11,275 in Santa Clara County, $9,115 in Orange
County, $8,690 in Ventura County and $7,340 in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   It is little wonder that the system is in crisis mode, said
experts. According to U.S. Census estimates, 1.5 million California
children younger than 6 live in homes where both parents or a single
head of household are employed. Still, in 2000, the number of working
women with infants dropped for the first time in 24 years, and it is
likely that some of these parents were unable to find appropriate
child care, said the study's authors.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles mother Terri Amuwa quit college and left a budding
career in merchandizing for odd jobs at home because she could not
afford the high cost of child care for her two children. Amuwa said
that after paying for rent, food and "luxuries like the phone bill,"
she was left with no more than $25 to $50 each month, hardly enough
for the kind of child care center she would like.</TE>
<TE>   It was only after she went on welfare and received subsidized care
through local referral agency Crystal Stairs that her family's lives
stabilized. She works now as a medical claims examiner but continues
to qualify for subsidized care.</TE>
<TE>   "The subsidized care has been a lifesaver," said Amuwa, 42.</TE>
<TE>   But while government subsidies help some, the number of families
that qualify far outstrip available funds. More than 250,000
California children are on waiting lists for subsidized care, 100,000
in Los Angeles County, according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, child care remains one of the lowest-paid professions,
with many child care centers losing one-third to half of their staff
each year. According to the study, the average annual salary for a
child care worker in California is $17,420. Despite huge demand,
centers in some communities do not operate at full capacity because
of the difficulty in finding qualified staff.</TE>
<TE>   One counter to the study's negative trends is the growing number
of licensed family child care homes, where up to 14 children are
cared for in the home of the provider. They are people like Jane
Probst, who has provided care in her Simi Valley home for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Probst is popular because she accepts infants and is just a few
credits shy of a bachelor's degree in child development. Probst said
she grosses about $45,000 with her home business, charging $150 a
week for infants and $135 a week for older children.</TE>
<TE>   "I see parents who are desperate for quality child care," Probst
said.</TE>
<TE>   Licensed care for infants is particularly hard to find. Only 14%
of the state's 9,407 licensed child care centers reserves spaces for
children younger than 24 months, the study reports.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, Yorba Linda provider Anna Karepetian can take
care of only four infants in her home day care center and does not
expect another opening until September.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, 10 parents are clamoring to be on a waiting list.</TE>

<HD>Rudolph B. Davila, 85; Medal of Honor Given 56 Years After

<LD>Rudolph B. Davila, who received the Medal of Honor 56 years after he
prevented a 130-man American rifle company from being slaughtered in
a German ambush in Italy during World War II, has died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Davila, a retired Los Angeles schoolteacher, died Jan. 26 of
natural causes in Vista, Calif. after a long illness.</LD>
<LD>   In 2000, he was among 21 Asian American World War II veterans who
received Medals of Honor at a White House ceremony after an Army
panel reviewed their wartime actions and deemed them worthy of the
nation's highest commendation for battlefield bravery.</LD>
<TE>   They all had received the second-highest citation, the
Distinguished Service Cross.</TE>
<TE>   Davila, who was of Filipino and Spanish descent, earned the medal
for his extraordinary heroism during the offensive that broke through
the German mountain strongholds surrounding the Anzio beachhead in
May 1944.</TE>
<TE>   A sergeant in charge of a machine gun platoon, Davila and his men
were coming up over a hill when they spotted several German machine
gun nests waiting to ambush an approaching 130-man American rifle
company.</TE>
<TE>   When Davila and his men were spotted on the grassy hilltop, the
Germans opened up on them instead.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing they were vulnerable on the exposed hillside, Davila's
machine gun platoon immediately retreated--except Davila.</TE>
<TE>   "They were reluctant to set up their guns and expose themselves,"
said Davila's son, Jeffrey.Dropping into the grass when the firing
began, Davila made his way back toward the crest of the hill and had
his men pass a machine gun, tripod and a box of ammo up the line.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no time to think of anything but how all those Americans
were about to be killed," he told a reporter in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Once he assembled the machine gun, Davila swung into a kneeling
position and began shooting--despite enemy fire that struck the
tripod and passed near his legs.</TE>
<TE>   After eliminating one German machine gun, Davila called for a
platoon member to take over his gun so he could move forward and
direct fire at a second machine gun nest. But as soon as a young
gunner came over the hill he was hit in the chest and killed.</TE>
<TE>   When another soldier took over Davila's machine gun, he crawled to
another vantage point and used hand and arm signals to direct the
gunner's fire until that German machine gun was silenced.</TE>
<TE>   With three of the platoon's machine guns now in action, the enemy
retreated 200 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Although slightly wounded in the leg, Davila ran to a burned tank
and as the Germans fired at him, he climbed on top and began firing
from the tank's turret.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the tank, he made his way across 130 yards to a
bombed-out farmhouse, where he killed five Germans with a hand
grenade and rifle fire. Climbing to the attic, he fired through a
large shell hole in the wall and eliminated two more enemy machine
guns.</TE>
<TE>   When the battle ended, the captain of the rifle company in the
field below told Davila, "If you hadn't done that, we'd have all been
slaughtered. When this is over, I'm going to write you up for the
Medal of Honor."</TE>
<TE>   Davila later received a battlefield commission to second
lieutenant and was promoted to first lieutenant. The war ended for
him in France in late 1944 when a tank round exploded in a tree and
shrapnel ripped into his right shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next six years, he underwent 13 operations on his
arm--and met his wife, Harriet, at a military hospital in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   During one surgery to remove scar tissue, a main nerve in his arm
was accidentally cut and his arm was paralyzed.</TE>
<TE>   Although Davila had no use of his right arm, his children never
considered him handicapped, Jeffrey Davila said.</TE>
<TE>   An excellent cook and gardener, the senior Davila terraced his
hillside yard and built retaining walls. He even built the family's
house in Harbor City, and later built his retirement home in Vista.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd go crazy about what could have been," Davila said not long
ago. "You just do the best you can."</TE>
<TE>   Born in El Paso and raised in Watts, Davila worked in vineyards
and helped restore the California missions as part of the Civilian
Conservation Corps. as a young man during the Depression.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in
sociology from USC and spent 30 years as a teacher and counselor in
the Los Angeles City School District.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Harriet Davila wrote numerous letters to Army
officials arguing that her husband deserved the Medal of Honor.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd read other Medal of Honor citations and then you'd read my
dad's [Distinguished Service Cross award] and it was very clear he
was in that same caliber," his son said. For years, some Asian
American veterans maintained that their service was undervalued
because of wartime prejudice. In 1996, Congress approved an amendment
by Sen. Daniel K. Akaka (D-Hawaii) to waive a three-year time limit
on consideration for medals and reassess whether these veterans
deserved the Medal of Honor.</TE>
<TE>   Davila got word in early 2000 that he would be receiving the Medal
of Honor at a White House ceremony that May.</TE>
<TE>   "He felt elated. Not like winning the lottery elated, but a deep,
emotional elation," said Jeffrey Davila. "And he was elated not so
much for himself but for his family. He saw this as a statement about
who we are as a family and who we are as Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Davila's only regret was that his wife could not attend the
ceremony. She died a month before he received word of the medal.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, Davila is survived by his other children,
Roland Davila of Evergreen, Colo., Tana Lemmenes of Clintonville,
Wis., Gregg Davila of Santa Ana and Jill Link of La Habra, and nine
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Davila will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full
military honors.</TE>

<HD>Woman Guilty in Bankruptcy Fraud Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Dermatologist is convicted a day after her husband
apparently killed himself by jumping from a hotel. Her shrieking
daughter is removed from court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury that was hastily sequestered after a defendant in a $3-million
bankruptcy fraud case apparently killed himself returned to federal
court Wednesday to convict the dead man's wife and co-defendant of a
handful of conspiracy, fraud and attempted tax evasion counts.</LD>
<LD>   Despite her lawyer's insistence that defendant Letantia Bussell,
53, was too distraught over her husband's death and too sedated to
leave her hotel bedroom, U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler
ordered her to appear in federal court in Santa Ana to hear the
verdict.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors deliberated four days before declaring Letantia Bussell, a
dermatologist from Beverly Hills, guilty on six of nine criminal
counts. During their discussions, jurors were not told that her
physician husband, John Bussell, 55, apparently leaped to his death
Tuesday morning at the Embassy Suites hotel in Santa Ana.</LD>
<TE>   Stotler, after learning of Bussell's death, ordered jurors to be
kept in a hotel for the evening, stripped of cell phones and banned
from watching television, reading newspapers or listening to news
radio for fear that word of the incident would prejudice their
judgment of Letantia Bussell.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, more than a dozen family members and friends of the
defendants, many of them in tears, filed into the courtroom to learn
the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the court clerk read the first count on which Bussell
was found guilty, daughter Kelly Bussell, 18, shrieked. A U.S.
marshal, who had been instructed by Stotler to remove anyone who
caused a disturbance, hissed at the Bussells' son Todd, 23, and
daughter Lisa, 22, to remove her.</TE>
<TE>   The young woman quieted momentarily, then began shrieking again
when she heard the decisions on the additional counts. As the court
clerk continued to read the counts, marshals grabbed the girl under
each arm and dragged her from the courtroom as she screamed, "They
killed my father! They killed him. Yes, they did."</TE>
<TE>   Many jurors watched the spectacle as the young woman was dragged
into the hallway to a courthouse nurse.</TE>
<TE>   The trial, which spanned 10 weeks, stemmed from a May 2000 federal
grand jury indictment. Federal investigators accused the Bussells,
along with two attorney advisors, of scheming to hide millions in
assets before a 1995 bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   During trial, defense lawyers argued that the Bussells had been
duped by the advisors, whom they trusted. Never, said defense lawyer
Nathan Hochman, had the couple believed that what they were doing was
illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after her husband's death Tuesday, Letantia Bussell insisted
to reporters that the government's prosecution was overzealous. "This
prosecution was totally intended to wear us down," she said. "My
husband just snapped."</TE>
<TE>   But as the verdict was read Wednesday, Bussell registered little
emotion. She and her children declined to comment as they left the
courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors Paul Stern and Ranee Katzenstein declined to comment
on the daughter's outburst or the jury's verdict. But defense lawyers
said Bussell faced up to seven years' imprisonment and as much as
$1.5million in fines.</TE>
<TE>   Stotler allowed her to remain free on bail for at least a week so
she could attend to her family and deal with her husband's death.</TE>
<TE>   When she returns to court Feb. 14, lawyers will discuss doubling
her $400,000 bond and placing her in home detention for some weeks
before her sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   A family friend, Nancy Blumenfeld, said the case and John
Bussell's death were tragedies. "You could not find a better mother,
and you could not find a better father," she said. "If anyone had a
problem, they were there to help."</TE>
<TE>   Before the jury's findings were announced, Bussell's lawyer had
urged the judge to seal them and have Bussell return to court today.</TE>
<TE>   Hochman said it would take Bussell at least that long before she
was in any shape to hear the verdict. He bristled at prosecution
requests to read it that day.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows an incredible lack of compassion," Hochman said. But
Stotler said a postponement would jeopardize more than two weeks of
trial. Jurors could, prosecutors pointed out, change their mind after
learning of John Bussell's death.</TE>
<TE>   Before dismissing the jury Wednesday, Stotler explained the reason
for the sequestration.</TE>
<TE>   "It is difficult to inform you, but defendant John Bussell took
his life yesterday by jumping from the hotel where he was staying,"
Stotler told the seven-woman, five-man panel.</TE>
<TE>   Juror David L. Corkern said he and other jurors were shocked at
being sequestered, unable even to call their families.</TE>
<TE>   He said they were given no reason.</TE>
<TE>   "This trial had been going on a long time, and so we got into the
habit of going home at 4 at the end of the day," the 43-year-old
Rancho Santa Margarita resident said. "When they told us we had to
stay, we were like, 'What?'"</TE>
<TE>   Corkern declined to discuss jury deliberations, but said it came
as a blow to learn afterward that John Bussell had died.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have made it very hard to reach a unanimous decision if
we knew that," Corkern said. "That's probably why they did what they
did. It would be hard not to feel sympathy. It would be hard for
anyone."</TE>

<HD>Senate Moves to Cite Enron for Contempt</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Company officials fail to appear as requested
before a committee. Sanctions could include fines and jail terms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The state Senate revived its effort to hold Enron Corp. in contempt
after nobody from the company showed up Wednesday to answer
lawmakers' questions about missing documents.</LD>
<LD>   If adopted by the full Senate in coming weeks, contempt penalties
against Enron could include $1 million a day fines, legislation that
bans the company from doing business in the state, the jailing of
executives or a resolution urging California's public employee
retirement systems to divest themselves of Enron stock.</LD>
<LD>   The Legislature weighed some of those measures in September after
Enron failed to comply with a Senate subpoena for documents. But on
the last day of the legislative session, Enron attorneys promised to
deliver the documents, and lawmakers never voted on the contempt
resolution.</LD>
<TE>   "In retrospect, we should have passed it," said Sen. Debra Bowen
(D-Marina del Rey).</TE>
<TE>   The Houston-based energy giant filed for bankruptcy in December
after the value of its shares fell to less than $1 from $85 the
previous year. The collapse cost the California Public Employees'
Retirement System $40 million in a portfolio valued at $147 billion.
The California State Teachers Retirement System lost $47.5 million on
a portfolio valued at $108 billion.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly a year, Enron has been resisting the demands of the
Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale
Energy Market, chaired by Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana).</TE>
<TE>   The committee's mission is to figure out why the wholesale
electricity market California launched in 1998 spiraled out of
control two years later.</TE>
<TE>   In an investigative mode unusual for the Legislature, Dunn's
committee has demanded copies of extensive records from several major
energy companies.</TE>
<TE>   Enron has submitted 130,000 pages so far, Dunn said, but "only a
handful" are relevant to the subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   Several weeks ago, Dunn's committee submitted a second subpoena to
Enron seeking information about documents allegedly destroyed by
Enron's accounting firm. Enron officials referred Dunn to that firm,
Andersen, and to federal investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn asked Enron officials to appear before the panel on Wednesday
to answer questions about their failure to comply with the subpoena,
but nobody showed.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn's committee is expected to recommend on Tuesday that the full
Senate find Enron in contempt.</TE>
<TE>   There is little precedent to guide lawmakers seeking to punish
Enron. Experts say the last time the Legislature held a company in
legal contempt was in 1929, when several executives of a cement
company were ordered to jail because they refused to cooperate in a
price-fixing investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The state Supreme Court voided the contempt citations in that case
on grounds that the Senate's demands for information were too vague.</TE>

<HD>Playing With Cigarette Lighter May Have Sparked Blaze That
Killed 3</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The three young siblings killed in a fire Tuesday morning in the
Pico-Union district touched off the blaze while playing with a
cigarette lighter, a Fire Department spokesman said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Fire officials said the combination of unattended children and
disposable lighters was a recipe for catastrophe.</LD>
<LD>   But police said that no charges will be filed and that the
incident was "entirely accidental."</LD>
<TE>   "If adults leave any type of matches or lighters and they have
some small children around, that is as dangerous as a loaded weapon,"
said Capt. Steve Ruda, spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department.
"Put in the hands of small children, that leads to tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   Ruda said three non-childproof disposable lighters were discovered
in the room where Juan Santoyo, 5, Karla Santoyo, 4, and their half
brother, Christian Calzada, 2, burned to death.</TE>
<TE>   One lighter was found at the bed's base, where the fire apparently
began, Ruda said. The other two were found in the remains of the bed.
The charred bodies of two of the children were found on the bed, the
other beside it.</TE>
<TE>   Police investigators said they have determined that the children's
mother, Aracely Calzada, was just outside the house, seeing her
husband, Raul Calzada, off to work at the moment someone first
noticed smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. John Pasquariello, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police
Department, said no charges will be filed against the parents. Ruda
concurred that the Fire Department's arson investigators "are not
looking at possible acts by the parents" as crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Ruda said the department's investigators have concluded that "the
bed clothing, the sheets and blankets" were ignited by one of the
children, who they believe was playing with a lighter.</TE>
<TE>   In past fires, psychologists have found that even very young
children tend to realize that playing with fire is wrong and at first
are often too embarrassed or ashamed to call for help, Ruda said.</TE>
<TE>   The Fire Department spokesman speculated that the siblings might
have reacted in that manner Tuesday. Witnesses said they did not hear
screams until the fire was well underway.</TE>
<TE>   City officials Wednesday said an order was drafted Jan. 25 to the
owner of the multiunit home, Corey Angel, to remove illegal
modifications at the Alvarado Terrace property. The order, described
as being "in the mail now," ordered the modifications removed by
March 11.</TE>
<TE>   Would-be rescuers had reported Monday that there was no direct
entrance from outside the house into the front bedroom, where the
children were heard screaming for help.</TE>
<TE>   Building officials did not comment on the specifics of the illegal
modifications or whether they might have prevented direct entrance to
the room.</TE>
<TE>   "They had done some work inside the building without our approval
... some interior modifications without the benefits of plans,
permits or inspections," said Robert Steinbach, spokesman for the
Department of Building and Safety.</TE>
<TE>   A neighboring homeowner, Mary Ann Hutchison, said she filed a
complaint in June that the building had more units than permitted,
and suggested that might have contributed to the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Seven months after her initial complaint, city building officials
formally alleged the illegal modifications. But they said the
certificate of occupancy for the property permits multiple units.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to the owner drew only a response from a man identifying
himself as Angel's brother. He said the building owner "feels
traumatized by the incident but has no other comment."</TE>

<HD>Scott Forbes, 57; Ran Dance Palace</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scott Forbes, a leading figure in the social history of West
Hollywood as the founder and managing partner of legendary dance
palace Studio One, has died. He was 57.</LD>
<LD>   Forbes, also active in West Hollywood as a longtime member of the
city business license commission and a onetime candidate for City
Council, died Jan. 20 at Midway Hospital in Los Angeles from
complications following elective surgery. He had not been in ill
health.</LD>
<LD>   A former factory converted to commercial use, Studio One sat
prominently between two city blocks just off Santa Monica Boulevard
in West Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   With its massive dance floor that could hold well over 1,000
people and its adjacent Backlot Theater, which presented some of the
finest cabaret performers of the time, including Bernadette Peters,
Chita Rivera, Joan Rivers and Madeline Kahn, Studio One was
considered by many the place to see and be seen through much of the
1970s and 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Open at 9 p.m. seven nights a week, the dance floor was often
populated by some of the best dancers in town.</TE>
<TE>   "You would see some amazing dancers, professionals who wanted a
workout," recalled Bill Miles, Forbes' life partner. "Scott made sure
the DJ working the room was right on top of things."</TE>
<TE>   A native of Boston, Forbes came to Southern California in the
early 1960s. After graduating from USC, he practiced optometry in
Santa Monica and later in West Hollywood. According to Miles, he
counted celebrities such as Elton John and Rivers among his
clientele.</TE>
<TE>   But he found the late nights involved in running a disco not
conducive to running a daytime practice and gave it up.</TE>
<TE>   According to Miles, Forbes designed the club to fill a void in the
community.</TE>
<TE>   "Scott thought it right that gays have a place to go to that was a
dynamic spot, a place of prominence in the community," Miles said.</TE>
<TE>   Studio One became Forbes' focus and he talked candidly about the
disco's founding in an interview with The Times some years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Studio One was planned, designed and conceived for gay people,
gay male people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Any straight people here are guests of the gay community. This is
gay!</TE>
<TE>   "Studio One needs 1,000 people per night to survive. The only ones
who would do that are the gay people, because they are the ones who
go out every night of the week. Straight people tend to go out just
on weekends. This club would not survive as a straight club," Forbes
said.</TE>
<TE>   The club was an immediate success.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes was also active in bringing gay clientele into other
venues. In 1978, he decided that Disneyland was a good spot for a gay
party. So he booked the park in the name of the Los Angeles Bar and

of the association members were gay.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we had the contract signed, I invited them to Studio One,"
Forbes said. "That was a little shock for them."</TE>
<TE>   About 18,000 people, most of them homosexual, jammed Disneyland on
the night of the party, May 25, 1978. Forbes was active in West
Hollywood politics. He ran for City Council in the city's first
election after incorporation in 1984 but finished in the middle of a
crowded field.</TE>
<TE>   Some years ago, Forbes sold his interest in Studio One. It was
renamed the Axis and now operates as the Factory.</TE>
<TE>   For the last 15 years or so, Forbes and Miles ran a travel
business in West Hollywood that emphasized cruises.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes also served on the city's business license commission,
which he headed from 1994 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very rational guy and looked at things very
evenhandedly," said Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-W.Hollywood).
Recently, Forbes had been active as a community liaison for the West
Hollywood Sheriff's Station.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by Miles; his mother, Esther Forbes, of Framingham,
Mass.; a sister, Gail Forbes, of Framingham; and a brother, Leonard
Forbes, of Valencia.</TE>

<HD>Man Gets 10 Years in Death of 3-Year-Old</HD>

<LD>A Long Beach man shouted obscenities and tearfully claimed his
innocence after being sentenced Wednesday to 10 years in state prison
in connection with the killing of a 3-year-old girl whose dismembered
body was hidden in a block of concrete.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm innocent.... They railroaded me, Mom!" Randy Lonell Foster
shouted to his mother in Los Angeles Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   Foster, who was convicted in April of child abuse, and his
girlfriend, Rakeisha Lanette Scott, 24, were charged in the death of
Scott's daughter, Milan Anjonet Scott. The girl's body was found in
seven pieces, decomposing and entombed in a block of concrete in the
trunk of Foster's car, in June 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Victor Rodriguez argued that Foster
administered severe discipline that led to the girl's death.</TE>
<TE>   Foster and Scott told police that Milan had an accident in the
bathroom one night and was dead the next morning. Out of fear of
losing custody of the couple's infant son, Foster panicked and hid
Milan's body, the defense said.</TE>
<TE>   Foster was acquitted of second-degree murder by the same jury that
convicted him of child abuse April 9. The jury deadlocked on a charge
of assault on a child leading to death. On Jan. 16, a second jury
acquitted him of the assault count.</TE>
<TE>   Scott was convicted April 11 of murdering her daughter. She was
also found guilty of assault on a child under age 8 and child
endangerment. Scott was sentenced Jan 14 to 25 years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Foster, 23, asked for leniency, but Judge Michael E.
Pastor denied the request, saying he didn't believe "the defendant is
genuinely remorseful" and that Foster "still doesn't grasp the
horrific nature of the crime."</TE>

<LD>Peter Carapetian recounted his escape from Iran in 1978. On the eve
of the revolution, with the city in flames and tanks rolling down the
streets, the former photographer took one of the last planes out of
Tehran and fled to Germany.</LD>
<LD>   Even though he never saw his country or parents again, he
considers himself "extremely lucky to be here speaking to you,"
Carapetian, 62, told a group of Los Angeles students.</LD>
<LD>   Carapetian was one of nine people, including immigrants from
Latvia, Honduras and China, who shared their stories this week with a
group of 9- and 10-year-olds at the Mirman School for gifted
children. The panel discussion culminated a social studies lesson
seeking to expose students to the struggles and experiences shared by
people coming to the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   Students have been reading historical fiction, watching videos and
doing computer research in what teachers hope also will broaden their
understanding of ethnic diversity.</TE>
<TE>   The private Westside school, which enrolls 370 students, has
organized similar discussions for the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   "I've noticed a difference teaching this unit this year because of
Sept. 11," said teacher Leanne Statland. "There's a stronger
understanding of what it means to be American."</TE>
<TE>   Students took notes as they listened to such speakers as Oscar
Maldonado, who emigrated from Honduras to Miami in 1993 with $100 in
his pocket, minimal English skills and dreams of playing professional
soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "I always wanted to have nice sneakers," he joked, using the image
to describe the hope he had for a better life in a new country.
Maldonado, 35, is now a chess teacher, and one of his students,
10-year-old Neil Moody, asked him to be a speaker.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Lee, who left Canton, China, in 1947, spoke of the racism he
encountered in San Francisco as he started a career as a banker.</TE>
<TE>   Herbert Hofman, who was born in Poland and liberated from a
concentration camp in 1945, described the 19 days he spent on a
fishing boat on his way to the United States. There were 175 people
on the boat meant to carry 25, said the retired grocery store owner.</TE>
<TE>   Ten-year-old Sean Kesluk said Carapetian's flight from Tehran had
the most impact on him: "He came from Iran and had to give up all his
belongings to come to this country. You really appreciate how we are
free in this country."</TE>

<HD>Jones Urges Smaller School Districts</HD>
<DH>Campaign: GOP hopeful calls for a 30,000- student limit,
which would split L.A Unified into at least 24 groups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>In what he called a "simple but radical" education plan, Republican
gubernatorial candidate Bill Jones on Wednesday proposed limiting all
school districts in California to 30,000 students, setting up special
academies to train teachers and streamlining state education
functions.</LD>
<LD>   Accomplishing Jones' goal would require splitting the Los Angeles
Unified School District, with its roughly 736,000 students, into at
least 24 districts.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking to the Commonwealth Club, Jones blamed problems in
education on interference from Sacramento and Washington.</LD>
<TE>   "More power has flowed to the state capitals and more power has
flowed to our national capital, and the less effective our education
system has become," said Jones, California's secretary of state.
"What we have here is a state system that perpetuates failure."</TE>
<TE>   He said the solution was not to spend more money but to give
authority to local schools through block grants from Washington and
Sacramento--one of many parts of the plan that could be tough to
implement.</TE>
<TE>   Jones proposed increasing the power of educators by allowing each
school to hire its own teachers, care for its own buildings and
select its own educational methods. He also called for a
cabinet-level education post in Sacramento and the elimination of the
superintendent for public instruction and State Board of Education.</TE>
<TE>   Block grants would be a major change in school financing and
require sweeping changes in federal law. Restructuring various
education departments and elective posts would require amending the
state Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' proposal to raise standards for teachers comes at a time
when the state faces an estimated shortage of 200,000 instructors in
the coming years. His teacher academies could not make up that
shortfall alone.</TE>
<TE>   And his plan to limit districts to 30,000 students would require
slicing up all major districts in the state through legislation in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said he was not worried about getting the plan passed,
citing a history of working with the Democrats who dominate the
Legislature and with influential education groups that could be
rattled by the reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that his wife is a public school teacher, Jones declared
that "it is not politicians who have the answers on education ... it
is the people who are in the classroom."</TE>
<TE>   The secretary of state took a swipe at the educational
achievements of Richard Riordan, the former mayor of Los Angeles and
front-runner for the Republican gubernatorial nomination.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing that would have made a difference in the LAUSD is
the one thing Dick promised to do as a candidate [for mayor] and
failed to do as mayor--break up the LAUSD," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said the school district is simply too large to work. He
described it as having 900,000 students, although it actually has
about 736,675.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Duke Helfand contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>New LAUSD Map Offered</HD>
<DH>Schools: Latino groups propose revised district boundaries
to the board, placing two seats exclusively in the Valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of Latino advocacy groups has released maps proposing new
district boundaries for the Los Angeles Unified School District board
that would return two seats exclusively to the San Fernando Valley
and create a Latino stronghold east of the San Diego Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The maps will be presented to the Los Angeles City Council
Redistricting Commission, which will send its recommendations to the
full council by March 1. The council will vote by July 1 on the
proposed district boundaries.</LD>
<LD>   The last boundary changes were made in 1992, resulting in one seat
entirely in the Valley, and three others representing parts of the
Valley.</LD>
<TE>   The map proposed by the Latino groups would put board member Julie
Korenstein in District 6, west of the San Diego Freeway, and board
member Caprice Young in District 3, east of the freeway. District 4
would acquire Studio City and parts of Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is bringing justice back to the Valley," said Alan Clayton
of the California Latino Redistricting Coalition. "The problem with
the board is that it hasn't done enough outreach and is not sensitive
enough to the [Latino] community."</TE>
<TE>   Latinos make up more than 70% of the district's 900,000 students.
In addition to a predominately Latino seat in the East Valley, the
proposed map would create Latino strongholds in East L.A., eastern
downtown and the harbor area. Clayton said the board could better
serve Latinos by not carving up the district into several seats.</TE>
<TE>   "The current map is really convoluted," Korenstein said. "It's
very hard to service a community when you're spread that thin."</TE>
<TE>   Young, the school board president, said she was open to change,
provided that new boundaries would better serve the students.</TE>
<TE>   "The maps have the demographic potential to elect Latino officials
and give the Valley better representation," she said. "We have to
balance those issues in the interest of serving kids. But those
things are not necessarily compatible."</TE>
<TE>   Public meetings on redistricting will be held at San Fernando
Middle School on Feb. 20 and Locke High School in Los Angeles on Feb.
21, both at 7 p.m.</TE>

<HD>No Mardi Gras Parade in SLO</HD>
<DH>Controversy: Though it prevailed, group canceled event
because of protracted legal battle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN LUIS OBISPO</DL>
<LD>This sleepy college town on the Central Coast would never be mistaken
for the Big Easy, except maybe for the weekend each year when Mardi
Gras comes to town.</LD>
<LD>   People like to boast that their celebration can compete with
anything west of New Orleans. Two years ago, the parade and
festivities drew 35,000 people to a city of only 45,000.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, in the eyes of the retirees and ranchers who live
here, as the event has grown in popularity it has begun attracting
some of the same behavior as the New Orleans celebration. Young women
bare their breasts for beads. Young men follow them with video
cameras.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, the Little Easy has become distinctly uneasy with its
home-grown celebration. This year, in fact, the city tightened
restrictions, leading to a nasty court fight and this week--with the
parade set for Saturday--organizers canceled it..</TE>
<TE>   "There is no point in throwing together something ragtag," said
Mardi Gras spokeswoman Carol Pimentel.</TE>
<TE>   The decision Tuesday night was something of a surprise, since the
Mardi Gras planners had won an injunction blocking the city's tough
parade ordinance. U.S. District Judge Audrey Collins said the
ordinance was too broad and threatened the right to free speech in
public areas such as streets and sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   But Pimentel said the fighting between the parade committee and
the city had gone on so long that it would have been impossible to
put on the kind of spectacle people are used to.</TE>
<TE>   The Mardi Gras celebration in San Luis Obispo started in 1978 and
over the years has developed its own traditions. A king and queen are
chosen, and dozens of floats motor down the one-mile route along
Marsh Street.</TE>
<TE>   The theme of last year's parade was "Too Hot to Handle." That
describes the city's feelings about the event. "What we've always
worried about is the potential drunken riots after the parade," said
Jeff Jorgensen, the city attorney. As the crowds grew rowdier,
families began staying home, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, there were numerous arrests after the parade, according
to Jorgensen. A pedestrian was hit and injured by a car fleeing
revelers. He said the city is being sued by the victim.</TE>
<TE>   After last year's event, the city wrote to the Mardi Gras
committee, consisting of local businesspeople and longtime
volunteers, and said it was not inclined to issue a parade permit for
this year. If it did, it would remove the usual $10,000 cap on the
service charge for policing the event. That alarmed parade
organizers, who feared the bill could total $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Through the American Civil Liberties Union, the Mardi Gras
committee went to court, attacking provisions that imposed the stiff
fees, as well as language giving a city official the ability to
decide what is and is not a 1st Amendment-protected activity.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Collins issued a temporary restraining order against the
city last month, then a preliminary injunction this week.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers were planning to hold a small daytime parade, but on
Tuesday night, the parade committee voted to abandon that plan,
fearing that a second-rate event would tarnish the celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Mardi Gras parade will not be held, the ACLU's
Carol Sobel said the court fight was worth it. "The injunction is
important because the committee can start planning for next year's
parade," she said. Also, she said, other event organizers will
benefit from the lack of restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Pimentel said other Mardi Gras events will still be held Saturday.
They include a daytime festival for children and a nighttime masked
ball that typically draws more than 400 people. Prizes are awarded
for most elegant, most whimsical and most alluring costumes.</TE>
<TE>   After that, Pimentel said, planning will start on next year's
parade. She expects it will be a spectacle, since it will be the 25th
anniversary of the celebration in San Luis Obispo.</TE>
<TE>   But, she emphasized, "it will not be an invitation for a drunken
bacchanal."</TE>

<HD>Wetlands Fail to Pass Critics' Smell Test</HD>
<DH>Van Nuys: City officials have scaled back and renamed a
project to create a marsh for purifying sewage. But residents still
fear it will produce odors and bugs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A proposal to turn as much as 60 acres of open space in Van Nuys into
marshland to provide natural purification of treated sewage has been
repackaged as Sepulveda Wetlands Park, but the new moniker has not
quieted critics, who say a swamp is a swamp.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal for the wetlands in the Sepulveda Basin is detailed
in a draft planning report being sent today to community
organizations, which will have a month to comment to Los Angeles
Sanitation Bureau officials before it is finalized.</LD>
<LD>   The report said the city can meet goals for reducing nitrogen in
treated waste water dumped into the Los Angeles River from the
Tillman Water Reclamation Plant if the effluent is first put through
a vegetated wetland.</LD>
<TE>   The $15.6-million project is a scaled-down version of a proposal
to convert about 300 acres of open space into wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very excited about this project, which would add to and
enhance the amenities already provided in the area by the Wildlife
Lake, Lake Balboa and Japanese Gardens," said Valerie Lynne Shaw,
president of the city Public Works Board.</TE>
<TE>   She said public input is essential "to make Sepulveda Wetlands
Park something that will complement and enhance the facilities that
already are in the area for residents to enjoy."</TE>
<TE>   To make the project more friendly to park visitors, officials have
added an educational center and a system of boardwalks that will
allow close-up views of wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   But the project, even with a new, more appealing name, drew
opposition from several community leaders, who worry that it will
create a swamp with odors, mosquitoes and other nuisances for people
who live 100 yards to the south.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a slick effort to gloss over all the issues," said Gerald
Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino. "This is a backhanded,
dishonest way to bring it to the public, painting it as a parkland
even though it is taking parkland away for purposes of sewage
treatment."</TE>
<TE>   City officials said the wetland will not produce foul odors and
there is a plan to mitigate mosquito problems.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Don Schultz, president of the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn.,
remains opposed to the project.</TE>
<TE>   "It's 60 acres too much," he said. "The Sepulveda Basin was
supposed to be a recreation area. That was what was intended. This is
not recreation."</TE>
<TE>   The project even drew criticism from Rosemary White, president of
the Canada Goose Project and chairwoman of the endangered species
committee of the Sierra Club's Los Angeles branch.</TE>
<TE>   "I am opposed to it because ... the San Fernando Valley and Los
Angeles lack open space, and we need to protect any open space we
have," White said.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles city attorney's office recommended Wednesday that the
state controller review a financial study of the San Fernando Valley
and harbor secession proposals.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant City Atty. Fred Merkin made the recommendation to the
City Council's Budget Committee.</LD>
<LD>   The full council will decide Friday whether to seek the
controller's review, which would cost $300,000.</LD>
<TE>   The financial study, conducted by the Local Agency Formation
Commission, found that the Valley and harbor area could be fiscally
healthy as breakaway cities.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Nick Pacheco, the committee chairman, said he wants a
controller review. "Anything that can help provide clarity and
accurate numbers is something I support," Pacheco said.</TE>

<LD>When the Orange County Water District looks at its 7.5-acre spread
along the Santa Ana River, it sees a way to meet the water needs of a
new generation. Nancy Huffman looks at the same land and sees 200
soon-to-be-homeless horses--and the death of a lifelong dream.</LD>
<LD>   The water district has told Huffman that it is evicting her River
Trails stable in Orange to make way for a new water basin, meaning
that 200 horse owners will have to find another place to board their
animals. And that's not easy these days. The number of Orange County
boarding stables has dwindled to less than two dozen.</LD>
<LD>   Christine McGovern, spokeswoman for the Orange County Equestrian
Coalition, says there are 18 boarding stables remaining in the
county, housing 3,600 horses. But most facilities have long waiting
lists.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a huge problem," said Jenny Jackson, whose company,
Steinberg Tack and Feed, provides hay and grain for many local
stables. "Thirty years ago, there were stables everywhere in Orange
County. Now they're all becoming condos or 7-Elevens."</TE>
<TE>   Or in the case of River Trails, a large water basin. The district
says it won't have the resources to keep up with population growth
over the next 20 years if it doesn't create new percolation
reservoirs to divert water from the Santa Ana River. The River Trails
property happens to be ideal, said water district spokeswoman Jenny
Glasser.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to find alternative locations to avoid closing the
stables," she said. "But our tests showed the soil at River Trails
was the most suitable to percolate water to the underground basin for
storage."</TE>
<TE>   Other test sites showed clay soil, she said, which makes it too
difficult for water to seep underground.</TE>
<TE>   River Trails has always had 10-year leases with the water
district. But its last 10-year lease was up in 1999. That was the
year the district created a master plan through 2020, showing new
basins were essential.</TE>
<TE>   The district that year granted Huffman a one-year extension, then
approved additional one-year extensions in 2000 and 2001. But last
fall, she was told that she'd have to move out by October 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "She's had fair warning," Glasser said.</TE>
<TE>   At its meeting Wednesday, the board expected an update from
Huffman about her progress in finding another location. What it got
instead was a plea from Huffman and about 80 other horse lovers that
she be allowed to stay.</TE>
<TE>   River Trails is just the latest stable to face an uncertain
future. Rancho Del Rio Stables in Anaheim recently received an
eviction notice from its landlord, the city, though it now appears
that there's a chance for a short-term reprieve. Still, owners Bob
and Jane Jones know that eventually they will have to move.</TE>
<TE>   "Closing a stables is like losing a city park," said Jane Jones.
"The city would lose something that gives it balance." The Joneses
are also supportive of Huffman.What will Huffman do if she loses?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to lose," she said grimly. "I'm going to operate
River Trails, right here. I just know it."</TE>

<LD>Declaring that a spate of big-truck crashes must stop, the chief of
the California Highway Patrol said Wednesday that he will soon order
a new campaign to crack down on reckless big-rig drivers.</LD>
<LD>   "These clowns just won't slow down. There is not a day that goes
by that we don't have a [truck-involved] crash," said CHP
Commissioner D.O. "Spike" Helmick.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, Helmick said in a memo to his 6,700 officers that the
CHP has an image problem when it comes to enforcing the traffic laws
on truckers.</LD>
<TE>   In spite of a reduction in the number of truck collisions over the
last year, Californians view accidents involving trucks as a major
problem and believe "the CHP is not doing enough to address this
issue," Helmick said.</TE>
<TE>   In the memo, he also mildly rebuked some officers for the
misconception that they must get specialized training in order to
make the roads safer from reckless truck drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Many violations are easily recognized, he said. "Road patrol
officers can have a significant impact by simply enforcing the basic
rules of the road."</TE>
<TE>   Helmick said the intensified enforcement and driver education
campaign will start soon and last at least through April.</TE>
<TE>   The program drew immediate support from the California Trucking
Assn. "We don't want to be exposed to someone who is a danger to us,"
said Vice President Warren Hoemann.</TE>
<TE>   As a new tool, Helmick said, the CHP will deploy a fleet of 70
high-performance Chevrolet Camaros. Unlike the Highway Patrol's
familiar black-and-white cruisers, the Camaros are white and are
designed to blend into traffic so they are more difficult for
truckers to recognize.</TE>
<TE>   Disclosure of the plan occurred in the aftermath of two
chain-reaction crashes on fogbound highways near Fresno on Tuesday,
in which at least two people were killed. Eighty-seven vehicles,
including big rigs, were involved.</TE>
<TE>   "These accidents have got to stop," Helmick said Wednesday.</TE>

<LD>A 33-year-old Simi Valley man has been given a six-month jail term
after feigning a disability resulting from a workplace accident,
authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Randolph, a former gardener for the city of Los Angeles,
claimed he suffered a severe back and shoulder injury in a 1996 fall
from a truck.</LD>
<LD>   While receiving disability benefits in 1998, he was videotaped
carrying furniture, a bed, boxes and a bicycle with no signs of pain,
according to a spokesman for the Ventura County district attorney's
office.</LD>
<TE>   An investigation by state insurance officials and local
prosecutors also found that Randolph had failed to disclose a
previous back injury and a previous workers' compensation claim.</TE>
<TE>   Randolph pleaded guilty in November to one count of workers'
compensation insurance fraud. He was sentenced Tuesday by Superior
Court Judge Bruce Clark to 180 days in jail and five years'
probation.</TE>
<TE>   He also is required to pay the city of Los Angeles more than
$61,000 in restitution.</TE>

<HD>Fire Directors OK With Retooling Volunteers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fire officials encountered little resistance Wednesday to a sweeping
recommendation that calls for most of the Orange County Fire
Authority's volunteer firefighters to stop putting out flames and
provide only emergency medical service.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, presented to the department's directors at an
afternoon workshop in Orange, also recommends closing two of the
county's 62 fire stations.</LD>
<LD>   "Today is all about creating a healthy, safe, reliable and
sustainable reserve program," Chief Chip Prather told the board in
presenting the recommendations.</LD>
<TE>   After hearing the proposal, board chairwoman Susan Ritschel said,
"I think the recommendations are fair. It was obvious that we needed
to revamp the program, and my sense is that the board members will be
supportive of the direction we're taking."</TE>
<TE>   The board is expected to vote on the matter at its March 28
meeting. If the proposal is approved, Prather said, the intention is
for an "aggressive" implementation beginning in April.</TE>
<TE>   At earlier informational forums, some reserve firefighters
criticized the plan. On Wednesday, however, nobody spoke against it.
Bruce Newell, a volunteer officer in Modjeska Canyon who had been
critical of some aspects of the plan, said, "I think it's a positive
program."</TE>
<TE>   Prather said after Wednesday's workshop, "We're not seeing a lot
of the outrage that we expected.... I thought this was a great
dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   County fire officials say the revamp is necessary because the
reserve program has been falling short on several counts in recent
years. The number of active volunteers, now 322, has been dwindling
at a rate of 25% to 30% a year, and the reservists respond to only
about half the calls they receive.</TE>
<TE>   Transforming them into emergency medical-service providers would
reduce the amount of initial training required of each volunteer to
about 100 hours, fire officials said. And it would open the doors to
potential volunteers who may not have firefighting experience.</TE>
<TE>   The two fire stations targeted for closure are No. 12 in Cypress
and No. 1 in Orange. Volunteer crews there would be reassigned, as
would the crew at either station No. 29 or 30, both in Dana Point.</TE>

<DH>Funeral: Joined by 700 mourners, a woman says goodbye to
her husband and sons killed in Placentia blaze.</DH>

<LD>As mourners blew bubbles Wednesday, Melodie Ybarra eulogized the
husband and three sons she lost last week in a house fire in
Placentia, then sang in the sign language that had been her special
way of talking to them.</LD>
<LD>   During a 2 1/2-hour funeral Mass that drew 700 mourners to St.
Joseph Catholic Church in Placentia, Ybarra signed the words of "Wind
Beneath My Wings" as the Bette Midler recording played. It was her
final message to her husband and boys.</LD>
<LD>   Relatives said that although no one in the family was
hearing-impaired, the 36-year-old wife and mother often used American
Sign Language to deliver special messages.</LD>
<TE>   Donald Ybarra, 39, and the couple's three boys--Brandon, 7,
Connor, 4, and Jacob, 2--died as flames engulfed their Placentia home
last week.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors and firefighters unsuccessfully tried to rescue them.
Melodie Ybarra escaped with second-degree burns.</TE>
<TE>   Ybarra told neighbors she and her husband tried to climb the
stairs to their boys' second-floor bedrooms. She was chased back by
flames and ran to a neighbor's home for help.</TE>
<TE>   The only smoke alarm in the house had been removed.</TE>
<TE>   During the service Wednesday, many speakers described Donald
Ybarra as a child trapped in the body of a man.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors remembered Donald coming by on his children's scooters
or bikes.</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhood children would ring the bell looking to play with
him, not her sons, Melodie Ybarra said.</TE>
<TE>   His sister Maria Elena Ethington said Donald Ybarra was the
favorite uncle in their tight-knit family, "who had one [child]
hanging on each arm and one pulling on each leg."</TE>
<TE>   "People were what was most important to Donald," Ethington said.
"Everyone depended on Donald. He took what was given to him and made
it better."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives said Melodie Ybarra has been comforting them through the
recent, painful days.</TE>
<TE>   "She's helping us through this," said Ybarra's brother Michael
Marek, who also spoke at the Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Marek said one of his sister's first tasks after the deaths was a
visit to her eldest son's school to talk with his friends and
classmates.</TE>
<TE>   After Marek spoke, the mourners whispered in surprise as Ybarra
came to the podium, stopping for a moment to collect herself, before
turning to the pews with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   She invited the children to stretch their legs, because the
service was so long.</TE>
<TE>   She also had arranged for the children to receive small goody bags
that included tiny jars of bubble solution, Pokemon cards and candy.
Adults blew the bubbles as the two caskets were taken away--one with
two boys inside, another with Donald and one son inside.</TE>
<TE>   After the Mass, the caskets were buried at Loma Vista Cemetery in
Fullerton as 50 doves were released into the sky.</TE>
<TE>   During the Mass, relatives and friends described how the Ybarras
considered each moment of life a special event, making simple
pleasures extravagant, from barbecues on summer evenings to hot
chocolate on rainy afternoons.</TE>
<TE>   Even the children's vaccinations were considered important moments
that Donald Ybarra made sure to attend. Not to mention the time he
skipped work to make a surprise appearance at Brandon's first field
trip at school.</TE>
<TE>   In the hours before the fire last week, the family spent a quiet
night at home, eating burgers Donald had brought home from In-N-Out
and videotaping the children making a pretend train from a laundry
basket. "We were married for 10 years," Melodie Ybarra said
Wednesday. "It was so easy."</TE>

<HD>When Robbing a Cabbie, Give Him a Fake Address</HD>

<LD>The moral of this story is don't bring your work home with you.</LD>
<LD>   When a taxicab arrived at a University City apartment complex, the
customer pulled a knife and robbed the driver of about $60, the San
Diego Union-Tribune reported. But the driver watched as the robber
entered the complex. San Diego police arrived, described the
assailant to the manager of the complex and were directed to an
apartment unit. The occupant was identified by the cabdriver and
arrested.</LD>
<LD>   Not exactly a roads scholar.</LD>
<TE>   Soon to be featured on "Antiques Roadshow"? Diane Lee of Palm
Springs couldn't help but notice a headline about a conservator with
an unusual collection (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   I knew Southern Californians were in love with their cars but....:
An ad placed by a prospective groom caught the eye of David Veal. The
guy seems to be dumping poor Chevelle (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of affection: Jonathan Clark came upon what could be
illicit pleasures for sale--or just an armoire (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   And if your homonymic urges still haven't been satisfied: Bill
Johnson found chilling evidence of the misspelling of "forced air"
(see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   This item is freeeeeee! As any commuter can tell you, the annoying
Sit'n Sleep mattress commercials of high-pitched Larry Miller seem to
air every three to four minutes on the radio. Each contains a moment
when Miller's whiny accountant shouts, "You're killing me, Larry!"</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, I was stunned to hear that radio host Larry Elder of
KABC-AM (790) has begun playing a tape of the accountant's line every
once in a while for comic effect. Doesn't Elder realize that
who-knows-how-many listeners will reflexively change stations upon
hearing that voice? Talk about a career gamble.</TE>
<TE>   Will the writers be invited back next week? Tom Brennan caught a
boo-boo on TV's "The Weakest Link," of all quiz shows. Asked the
meaning of "e pluribus unum," a contestant responded: "In God We
Trust," and that answer was accepted. Brennan points out that while
both phrases appear on United States currency, "e pluribus unum"
means "one from many."</TE>
<TE>   Another "Duh!" award winner: The media Web site ronfineman.com
caught a TV reporter discussing a bank robbery with a police officer.
When the cop mentioned the "teller alarm button," the reporter asked:
"Are those usually set off by tellers?"</TE>
<TE>   Webmaster Fineman, a radio reporter, told his readers: "Granted in
a world where black boxes are orange, and knuckle balls are not
thrown with your knuckles, I guess you never know. But in this case,
the answer was ... yes."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: In response to a Manhattan Beach man who claims he
grew the first square watermelon in 1986, Richard Lorentz recalled
seeing the straight-edged fruit in Japan in 1979 when he was married
there.</TE>
<TE>   A department store was offering them for about $25.</TE>
<TE>   Lorentz points out that Japan has long gone in for exotic
foodstuffs--real gold flakes sprinkled on food and sake, vitamin
drinks in jars, "dry" beers and horse sashimi. I don't think anyone
here is going to demand credit for inventing horse sashimi.</TE>

<PH>THE FALL OF ENRON</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>Former Enron Exec Expected to Stay Silent</HD>
<DH>Hearings: Andrew S. Fastow will appear before a House committee
today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID STREITFELD</AU>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>The last time Andrew S. Fastow got in a public brawl about money,
it was with a cabdriver and concerned a 70-cent tip. The cabbie got so
upset he punched Fastow in the face.</LD>
<LD>   This morning on Capitol Hill, Fastow will get slammed again. Members
of Congress are lining up to lambaste Enron's financial genius for the
utter collapse of a company worth $60 billion only a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Fastow, who was subpoenaed to testify, is all but certain to stay
silent, invoking his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination. He's
kept quiet ever since his forced resignation from Enron at the end of
October in the wake of disclosures that obscure partnerships he
controlled had soured. It was an admission that led to Enron's Chapter 11
bankruptcy filing Dec. 2.</LD>
<TE>   If Fastow has been unwilling to explain himself, a stream of
revelations is yielding a portrait. An internal Enron report released
Saturday showed him bullying employees into giving his partnerships a
better deal at the expense of Enron. Meanwhile, through just one
partnership, Fastow converted a $25,000 investment to $4.5 million in two
months.</TE>
<TE>   The picture that emerges is of a greedy, self-dealing executive whom
others dared not cross. Friends say they find that image impossible to
reconcile with the synagogue-going, happily married, stand-up guy they
know.</TE>
<TE>   It's as though there were two Andy Fastows.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly wouldn't be the first time someone was one way inside
work and another way outside it," said Bobby Lapin, a Houston attorney
and a longtime friend. "Jeffrey Dahmer's neighbors said he was such a
sweet, friendly guy."</TE>
<TE>   As Enron's chief financial officer, Fastow played a key role in
transforming an old-fashioned pipeline company into a high-tech, highly
leveraged trading firm with few fixed assets. "Andy has the intelligence
and the youthful exuberance to think in new ways," Jeffrey K. Skilling,
then Enron's president, said in an interview two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are struggling to determine how much responsibility
Skilling as well as former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay bear for Fastow's "new
ways," which ultimately proved highly destructive. Fastow, now 40,
supercharged Enron's growth through a range of instruments that kept the
company's debt off its balance sheet, where it might hobble its credit
rating and scare away investors. Such devices aren't unusual; what was
extraordinary is the way they entangled Enron's interests with Fastow's.</TE>
<TE>Conflicting Roles Disturbed Employees</TE>
<TE>   One of the partnerships that Fastow devised was named LJM, after his
wife, Lea, and his two sons. Some Enron employees worked for LJM or its
successor, LJM2, where they sat next to Enron employees who were
negotiating with them. Both groups reported to Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   "I find myself negotiating with Andy on Enron matters and am pressured
to do a deal I do not believe is in the best interests of the
shareholders," Enron's then-Treasurer Jeffrey McMahon wrote in a note in
March 2000, according to the Enron internal report completed by a special
board committee led by University of Texas Law School Dean William C.
Powers.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, the report indicates, Fastow increasingly favored the
private partnerships over the public company.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2000, for example, Enron Broadband Services needed to sell a
portion of its fiber-optic cable network to help the second-quarter
bottom line. It decided to dispose of some unactivated "dark" fiber.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations between the broadband team and LJM2 didn't
immediately bear fruit. Fastow complained directly to two of the Enron
negotiators that they were putting LJM2 in a difficult position by
selling it the dark fiber, which could take as much as a year to be
certified for use.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow's involvement caused "great distress" for the broadband team,
the report says. "They understood that their job was to get the best
possible deal for Enron, but driving a hard bargain for Enron drew the
ire of Enron's CFO."</TE>
<TE>   The deal was sweetened in LJM2's favor, just as Fastow wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Richard M. Burr (R-N.C.) said during a hearing on Enron this week
that the company had a two-headed coin. "On both sides of that coin was
Mr. Fastow. No matter how you flipped it, he always won. He won because
of his presence at Enron, he won because of his presence at the
partnerships. . . ."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, according to Enron, Fastow made about $30 million from LJM.
That's in addition to the $23.4 million he made in stock sales in 1999
and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   That's a lot of money even by the standards of the late-'90s boom,
especially to a guy who would be willing to confront a cabbie over pocket
change. In that 1985 Chicago incident, which was confirmed by a Fastow
spokesman, Fastow expected a driver to give him 70 cents in change. The
driver claimed he couldn't, so Fastow took back $1 and replaced it with
the 30 cents due. The cabbie, who had previously been suspended 14 times,
threw a punch, for which he was suspended again.</TE>
<TE>   The Fastows live on an immaculately maintained street of vintage
bungalows and big new houses in the upscale Southampton section of
Houston. A Valentine's Day sign made from three wooden hearts painted
pink and red decorates their front door. In warmer weather, Lea Fastow
sometimes plays hopscotch on the sidewalk with her sons.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing out of the ordinary, a neighbor said, is that
plain-clothes security guards often have been parked in front of the
house over the last two months.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the Fastows bought a parcel of land in River Oaks, the
city's swankiest community, where Lay and Skilling live. The property now
is assessed at $1.3 million, but the Fastows are reportedly spending $1.5
million more to build a new house on the site. Last year the couple also
bought a seaside house in nearby Galveston for about $250,000, property
records show.</TE>
<TE>   If the couple have an indulgence, it's contemporary art. It was
another area in which their personal and professional lives mingled: They
collected for themselves, but Lea Fastow also was in charge of a
committee buying art for Enron's new headquarters building here. The
three-member team spent about $3 million before the company crashed.</TE>
<TE>   As prominent members of the community, the Fastows have ties to local
nonprofit or religious groups. But a number of organizations say these
relationships are sometimes being overstated in media reports.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow headed the committee for an annual fund-raising dinner for
Houston's Holocaust Museum and also was involved in early organizational
work for his synagogue. But neither group considers him a major
benefactor.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is the Fastows have been members, supporters, but not
uniquely philanthropic," said Rabbi Shaul Osadchey.</TE>
<TE>   But Fastow does stand out in one way, Osadchey noted. If you had told
him a year ago that someone in his congregation would be involved in a
major financial scandal, "of all the candidates, Andy would have been
very low on the list."</TE>
<TE>Reputation as a Tough Negotiator</TE>
<TE>   Fastow was born in Washington, grew up in New Jersey and went to Tufts
University in Boston, where he got a degree in economics and, in a common
move at the time for prospective MBA students, took a number of courses
in Chinese. China was the next great market, or so investment bankers
believed; they were eager to hire those who had proficiency in the
language.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow married his college sweetheart Lea Weingarten, who comes from a
wealthy Houston real estate family. In 1984, while Fastow got his MBA
from Northwestern University, they both went to work for Continental Bank
in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Continental was attempting to emerge from the shadow of the biggest
financial scandal of the early '80s. A small Oklahoma bank called Penn
Square had made so many bad loans it went under, nearly dragging partner
Continental down with it. With its lending operation still under a cloud,
Continental tried to make money by branching into more complex financial
businesses, including loan securitization--one of several divisions where
Fastow worked.</TE>
<TE>   He earned a reputation as a hardened negotiator, but his occasional
arrogance stood out. "It was like an athlete putting himself ahead of the
team," said a former supervisor, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   When Fastow landed a job at Enron in 1990, bank officers said, they
were just as sorry to see the departure of Lea, who also worked at the
bank and who some say shone even brighter than her husband. She, too,
went to work for Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years later, Fastow became Enron's chief financial officer, a
position that often entails schmoozing with Wall Street. But Fastow kept
a very low profile. One of his rare interviews was with CFO magazine,
which gave him an award in 1999. In a quote that didn't make the
interview but was released by the magazine this week, Fastow says, "We
probably do our fair share of first-of-their-kind transactions, which is
usually good and sometimes isn't but don't quote me on that."</TE>
<TE>   He was a protege of then-President Skilling, which only increased his
power and stature. "He had this Jekyll-and-Hyde personality," said one
former executive. "On the one hand he was very charming. You knew he was
incredibly bright. But he was very immature. He lost his temper
regularly."</TE>
<TE>   Exactly how edgy, innovative financing turned into something ruinous
is a subject that will be addressed in today's hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's very clear that these people were not stunningly inept,
but they knew precisely what they were doing, and it was a pure example
of corporate greed," said Rep. Ed Whitfield (R-Ky.).</TE>
<TE>   Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations, said he expects
Fastow to exercise his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   "I never like to judge people harshly before they're given a chance to
talk," Greenwood said. "But this guy won't talk. I just think if somebody
says that they take the 5th Amendment, it's pretty hard to escape the
notion that they feel they've committed crimes."</TE>
<TE>   Though fierce in their defense of Fastow, friends acknowledge that he
has surpassed Lay and Skilling as the chief villain of this case. "He's
the center of the target, no question," said Bobby Lapin.</TE>
<TE>   Lapin says he still doesn't believe it. In 12 years of friendship, he
saw no signs of arrogance. Instead, he often was struck by Fastow's
modesty.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't want to paint a picture of sainthood or perfection, but
he's a mensch," Lapin said.</TE>
<TE>   Mensch--it's the same word Rabbi Osadchey uses, and maybe not just
because he and Lapin, as designated spokesmen, check in regularly with
Fastow's ever-growing defense team. The lawyers are led by David Boies,
who took on Microsoft Corp. and represented Al Gore before the Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   The rabbi seems surprised and pained by the allegations. He added that
though Fastow is "deeply depressed" by what has happened, he's also not
afraid to joke about it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the kind of humor that reveals no one's perfect, that life is
complex, that you can do the best you can and things still go awry,"
Osadchey said. "So you gotta throw your hands up and just laugh."</TE>

<HD>Indonesia Cleric Tied to '95 Anti-U.S. Plot</HD>
<DH>Asia: Man linked to Sept. 11 attacks helped finance earlier plan to
bomb 12 jets, officials say.</DH>

<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia
</DL>
<LD>An Indonesian cleric who has been linked to two Sept. 11 hijackers
was also the business partner of an Afghan terrorist and helped him
finance a 1995 plot to blow up 12 U.S. jetliners over the Pacific Ocean,
according to documents and officials in Malaysia and the Philippines.</LD>
<LD>   Riduan Isamuddin, 37, has emerged in recent weeks as the Southeast
Asia operations director for Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network,
officials say. But documents reviewed by The Times indicate that his
involvement in plots against U.S. targets dates to at least 1994.
Isamuddin, now better known as Hambali, was identified by authorities
recently as the leader of a plot to blow up the U.S. Embassy in
Singapore.</LD>
<LD>   Revelations about Hambali's early business ties to terrorists trained
in Bin Laden's camps and his involvement in Asian plots make his role in
the global terror network appear more central than previously thought.</LD>
<TE>   The new information links the Indonesian preacher to a plot that could
have killed thousands of people and gave investigators their earliest
hint that terrorists were planning to crash hijacked planes into
important buildings in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1994, Hambali was one of the founders of the Konsojaya trading
company here, and on Dec. 1 of that year, his partner in the firm, Wali
Khan Amin Shah, helped bomb a Philippine Airlines jetliner.</TE>
<TE>   A Japanese businessman was killed in the blast, which forced the jumbo
jet to land in Okinawa. U.S. prosecutors said the bombing was a test for
a much more ambitious plot to plant explosives in rapid succession on
United, Northwest and Delta airlines jets bound for America's West Coast
from cities throughout Asia. The plot also included a plan to kill Pope
John Paul II as a distraction while he was visiting the Philippines,
court records show.</TE>
<TE>   A freak accident and fire in January 1995 in the Manila apartment that
served as the group's bomb factory foiled the plans, which U.S.
prosecutors said would have killed as many as 4,000 Americans in a
48-hour period.</TE>
<TE>   Philippine police wiretaps showed that until the plot was discovered,
Hambali's company was in frequent contact with Mohammed Khalifa, Bin
Laden's brother-in-law, who headed a Manila-based charitable organization
allegedly used to spread Bin Laden's influence.</TE>
<TE>   One of the plotters later told investigators in the Philippines that
their ultimate goal was to hijack a commercial airliner and crash it into
a government building in Washington--a plan that foreshadowed the Sept.
11 plot.</TE>
<TE>   Involved with Khan--Hambali's business partner--in the plot to bomb
the 12 planes was Ramzi Yousef, who was also found guilty in the 1993
truck bombing of the World Trade Center, and Pakistani Abdul Hakim Murad.
According to court testimony, all three had either been to terrorist
camps or fought in the war against Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in
the 1980s. All three were convicted by a federal jury in New York in 1996
in the plot to bomb the 12 planes.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony during the trial showed that Khan used Malaysia as an
unwitting logistics base and frequent transit point before the planned
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Khan was arrested in Manila after the apartment fire but escaped 77
hours later and fled to Malaysia. He was captured by Malaysian police 11
months later when they identified him by the three missing fingers on his
left hand. Malaysian authorities immediately handed him over to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they learned years later that Hambali had supplied Khan
with a new identity and cover in Malaysia, where he lived on the resort
island of Langkawi using the name Osama Turkestani.</TE>
<TE>   Malaysian officials and a former Philippine investigator who headed
the investigation into the case now say the Konsojaya company was central
to the bombing plot, which was code-named Bojinka.</TE>
<TE>   "According to my analysis, Konsojaya was the nerve center not only for
business but also for operational supervision [of the plot to bomb the
airplanes]," said Rodolfo Mendoza, the former head of Philippine
counter-terrorism who led the Bojinka investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza added that he believes Hambali's role in the corporation meant
that he also was a key participant in financing and organizing the terror
plot.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate records on file in the Malaysian capital show that Khan, who
was on Konsojaya's board of directors, owned half the company's 6,000
shares. Other company documents show that Hambali and his Chinese
Malaysian wife, Noralwizah Lee, also were among the company's founding
directors.</TE>
<TE>   Other Konsojaya directors included another Afghan, Mehdat Abdul Salam
Shabana, who owned the other half of the company's shares, and Hemeid H.
Algamdi, described as a 30-year-old Saudi Arabian from Jidda, records
show.</TE>
<TE>   Konsojaya's managing director is listed as Amein Mohamed, a Yemeni who
is described in a company profile circulated to suppliers and customers
as the former marketing director of a Pakistan-based buying agent for a
Saudi company in Jidda.</TE>
<TE>   Other than Khan, the whereabouts of the former directors today is
unknown, and Hambali is the first to be linked to other terror plots.</TE>
<TE>   Hambali is wanted in Malaysia and Singapore in connection with a plot
to bomb U.S. and other Western targets in the region two months ago. He
also is wanted in his native Indonesia for his alleged role in a series
of bombings on Christmas Eve 2000. Some officials believe he may be
hiding in Indonesia. More than 40 people linked to Hambali have been
arrested in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines since December.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2000, Hambali put up two of the Sept. 11 hijackers and a
suspect in the bombing, in Yemen's Aden harbor, of the U.S. destroyer
Cole, which occurred in October of that year. He housed them at a condo
near Kuala Lumpur owned by alleged disciple Yazid Sufaat, who was
arrested by Malaysian authorities Dec. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Konsojaya stated in its incorporation papers that it was exporting
Malaysian palm oil to Afghanistan, and described its principal objective
as "exporting all kinds of products from Malaysia and the Asia Pacific
region to Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Afghanistan and Sudan."</TE>
<TE>   But Philippine and Malaysian investigators now say Konsojaya was
exporting more than just palm oil.</TE>
<TE>   "My analysis is that Konsojaya was formed for the purpose of terrorist
activity," former investigator Mendoza said in a telephone interview
Wednesday. "During that time, they were already expanding in Singapore.
They were active in Indonesia, in Jakarta [the capital]."</TE>
<TE>   Malaysian officials say they too believe Konsojaya was a funding
conduit for the Bojinka plot and a cover for Khan. David Greenfield,
Khan's court-appointed attorney in the 1996 trial, introduced the
Malaysian company's records during the trial as evidence that Khan had
legitimate business in Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   To neighbors near the simple shack an hour from Kuala Lumpur where
Hambali lived with his wife in 1994, his business appeared legitimate.
His landlord in the secluded compound knew Hambali only as a small-time
businessman and preacher.</TE>
<TE>   "Although we have had a very good record of coming down on
extremists--even Islamic extremists--a lot of these groups go about their
business quietly, and it's very difficult to discern exactly what they
are doing," one Malaysian official said this week. "A group like this was
able to operate without drawing much attention to themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Connections between the Asian terrorists and Bin Laden were long
hidden. The U.S. government's case against Khan and the others for
plotting to bomb the planes began just days before a federal grand jury
in New York started investigating Bin Laden and Al Qaeda. It never
mentioned the names of Bin Laden or his group.</TE>
<TE>   Through the 1996 trial, prosecutors cast the Kuwait-born Palestinian
Yousef, a man who remains so mysterious no one is certain of his real
name, as the mastermind of the bombing plot.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony in that trial showed that Yousef surfaced in Singapore in
the fall of 1994 with Khan at his side. There, they got Philippine visas
while in transit to Manila.</TE>
<TE>   "My observation is that Ramzi Yousef was considered the most
important," Mendoza said. "But it is the other way around. The most
important was Wali Khan and the board of directors in Malaysia." Among
those directors was Hambali.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael Garcia, who prosecuted the case,
described during the trial how Khan used various passports and fake
identities to move undetected through Malaysia, Singapore and the
Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb plot relied on explosives that used modified Casio watches as
detonators and bomb materials that could not be detected by airport
scanners.</TE>
<TE>   The devices were to be placed under the seats of U.S.-bound American
jetliners originating in Asian cities with interim stops. Yousef, Khan,
Murad and at least one other cell member who was never captured planned
to board the planes, plant bombs under strategically located seats to
blow out the planes' hydraulics, then disembark in the interim cities.
There, each would board another targeted jetliner.</TE>
<TE>   Detailed itineraries already were on the hard drive of Yousef's laptop
computer, which was seized by Philippine police after neighbors alerted
firefighters to the smoke in the group's apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Murad was caught when he returned to the apartment to fetch Yousef's
computer. Yousef fled to Pakistan, where a new recruit turned him in to
local authorities a month later, testimony showed. A week after the fire,
Khan was arrested at his girlfriend's Manila apartment, where police
found the fake passports, bomb material and other evidence introduced at
trial.</TE>
<TE>   During two months of interrogation by Philippine authorities, Murad,
who attended flight schools in America as early as 1992 and had a pilot's
license, said his ultimate goal was to hijack a U.S. airliner and crash
it into either CIA headquarters or the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Khan has said little to investigators. He told FBI agents escorting
him to New York after his arrest that he knew nothing about the Bojinka
plot. He did not testify at the trial.</TE>
<TE>   According to corporate records in Kuala Lumpur, Konsojaya is now
defunct.</TE>
<TE>   "The most critical question now is, 'Where are the other former
directors of Konsojaya?' " Mendoza said.</TE>
<TE>   A letter found in Yousef's room when Pakistani authorities tracked him
down at the Su Casa Hotel in Islamabad in February 1995 was a reminder of
the high stakes involved.</TE>
<TE>   Introduced in evidence during the 1996 trial, the letter was cast by
prosecutors as a ransom note to win Murad's release from Philippine
custody. It isn't clear from the court record whether the letter was ever
sent.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to take the harshest of measures in order that all
Filipino interests inside and outside the Philippines will be subject to
destruction," an Arabic translator read from it in court. "Our measures
will include assassinating some prominent figures, foremost among them
the Filipino president. They will also include hitting numerous aerial
targets. . . .</TE>
<TE>   "We also have the ability to make and use chemicals and poisonous gas
. . . for use against vital institutions and residential populations and
drinking water sources and others.</TE>
<TE>   "And if our request is not answered positively, in addition to
everything we have mentioned, we shall train the Muslims in the south [of
the Philippines] to do this. And these gases and poisons are made from
the simplest ingredients. . . . And we could, as well, smuggle them from
one country to another if needed."</TE>

<HD>No Oases for Saudi Youths</HD>
<DH>Economic and social pressures have left many of the kingdom's young
people scared, angry and susceptible to anti-American extremism.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia
</DL>
<LD>Majid Korni is sipping a cup of Dunkin' Donuts coffee, his mobile
phone resting beside a makeshift ashtray where a Marlboro slowly burns.
His eyes casually take inventory of the Faisaliah mall, looking past the
food court and the storefronts as he searches for love.</LD>
<LD>   All around are women, veiled from head to toe in the traditional
Islamic black gown. But a few yards away are the brown-robed religious
police who enforce Saudi society's strict moral codes. If the 23-year-old
college student so much as approaches a woman, he could be arrested. So
if Korni is interested, he jots his cell phone number on a piece of paper
and tosses it toward the woman.</LD>
<LD>   Dating is forbidden, so the most any young man can hope for is a
flirtatious phone call in return or, if really lucky, a secret liaison.
"It is very hard to live here for young people," Korni said. "Mixing with
girls is very hard."</LD>
<TE>   The difficulties facing young adults in this region go far beyond
searching for romance. Across the Arab world, young people have had a
glimpse of the better life through access to satellite television and the
Internet, and they're worried that they won't be able to go to college,
find a good job or have a home of their own.</TE>
<TE>   In Saudi Arabia, these concerns are especially shocking to a
generation that grew up with an unparalleled sense of entitlement after
the oil boom of the 1970s and '80s, which turned this once-backward
country into a land of wealth and excess.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Saudi youth live in a society that appears wealthy but is
deeply in debt. The boom years were followed by lower oil prices,
government deficits and rising unemployment. Unlike their parents, young
people are no longer guaranteed good salaries and prestigious jobs.</TE>
<TE>   They also live in a society that expects conformity but exposes them
to the diversity of the world. It is saturated with symbols of American
culture but promotes hostility against America's foreign policy, values
and Judeo-Christian underpinnings.</TE>
<TE>   These economic and social pressures have left many young people
scared, angry and susceptible to the kind of political thinking that
inspired 15 Saudi men to participate in the Sept. 11 terror attacks.
Though not all young Saudis support Osama bin Laden, many freely express
satisfaction with the assault on America.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where disease finds a ripe ground," said the kingdom's
longtime foreign minister, Prince Saud al Faisal. "When there is poverty,
lack of resources and lack of opportunity for young men to pursue work,
productive work, and there is the existence of festering problems like
the Palestinian situation . . . that is a very volatile combination."</TE>
<TE>   To talk to young people and their parents in Riyadh, the capital, and
the Red Sea port of Jidda is to get a glimpse into a society struggling
under the weight of its demographic imbalance, economic problems and
puritanical religious teachings. Few here believe this nation is in
danger of the sort of upheaval that occurred in Iran with the 1979
revolution. But they fear that, without significant changes, Saudi Arabia
could experience a slow unraveling of its social fabric.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers alone have forced the Saudi government to pay close
attention: An estimated 65% of the population is younger than 25. In
1970, 2,500 students graduated from high schools; this year, 200,000 will
graduate. With the population growing at about 3% a year, the government
must expand the economy about 6% annually to create the jobs needed to
keep up with demand. In recent years, however, growth has been about 1%.</TE>
<TE>   Many Arab regimes, from Egypt to Algeria, have even greater worries:
Their economies have been hit hard by recession, and they do not have the
benefit of the massive oil reserves held by Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   The challenges are magnified here, however, because of the political,
social and religious dynamics generated in a country that has done all it
can to preserve a traditional way of life laid out about 1,400 years ago
by the prophet Muhammad.</TE>
<TE>   From its founding by Abdulaziz ibn Saud seven decades ago, the kingdom
has controlled its fractious tribes through an alliance with the
puritanical Wahhabi movement. The Islamic sect calls for living by the
literal interpretation of the Koran. In Saudi Arabia, the Muslim holy
book serves as the constitution.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement that binds a leadership interested in thrusting the
country into modernity and a conservative religious camp dedicated to
keeping the shades drawn amounts to a division of power: The religious
community was given sway over social issues while the government took
control of foreign affairs and other such matters of state.</TE>
<TE>Young Caught Between Cultures of East, West</TE>
<TE>   This has created a society filled with young people caught between two
powerful forces, Islamic fundamentalism and Western culture. The contrast
is stark in terms of socializing. Religious rules prohibit unmarried men
and women from mixing under most circumstances. Even at weddings, the
bride and groom must have separate parties. Many marriages in Saudi
Arabia are arranged between families.</TE>
<TE>   Desperate for something to do, many young men flock to male-only
restaurants outside the city. They sit under long tents staked in the
desert, eat traditional foods and smoke fruit-flavored tobacco from water
pipes. All the while they watch satellite television broadcasts of "The
Sopranos," "Ally McBeal" and other American shows.</TE>
<TE>   "You see Saudi kids who dress Western, hang out at the mall, surf the
Internet looking for pornography, but these are the same kids who stand
up and cheer for Bin Laden," said a Western diplomat who requested
anonymity. "The kids are really mixed up."</TE>
<TE>   For young women, the options are even more limited and the
frustrations greater. One 18-year-old said the best she can hope for is
to go shopping, visit with friends in her home or go with the family on a
picnic. But like teenagers everywhere, she is rebellious; she meets
secretly with her American boyfriend in her house while her parents are
out. If the young couple were caught, he would be kicked out of the
country. She wasn't sure what her punishment would be but was willing to
take the risk.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very boring here," she said, adding that most of her friends
are so eager for something to do that they almost always call the numbers
that are thrown at them by men. "No one can stop it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Though the frustration among young people is most evident in terms of
social restrictions, they are deeply concerned about shrinking options
for the future. Five years ago, 90% of high school graduates were
admitted to the free public university system; today, there is room for
only 65% of the growing pool of graduates, and the percentage is falling.</TE>
<TE>   Even those who make it to university worry about finding a job after
graduation.</TE>
<TE>   "When I think about it, I believe I will not find a job. So it is
better not to think about it now," said Naief Asef, 23, a political
science student at Riyadh's King Saud University. "I am worried."</TE>
<TE>   There are reasons for concern. At the heart of the nation's financial
difficulties is its dependence on oil, which makes up an estimated 75% of
the government's budget. In 1981, per capita income in Saudi Arabia was
equal to that in the United States, about $28,600 in current dollars.
Primarily because of falling oil prices, it has since slid below $8,000.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders are trying to diversify the economy by organizing a massive
new gas project, privatizing more of the economy and inching toward
admission to the World Trade Organization. "The idea is to be independent
of any one source of income," said Ali Ibrahim Naimi, minister of
petroleum and mineral resources. "That is easier said than done."</TE>
<TE>   But even if the government succeeds, there are psychological hurdles
resulting from the sense of privilege oil bestowed on native Saudis. The
unemployment rate for young men is conservatively about 14% (relatively
few women are permitted to work). But the problem is not a lack of
jobs--it is a lack of suitable jobs. Foreign workers make up about a
third of the country's 22 million people. Saudis would not dream of
becoming a cook, hotel clerk, elevator mechanic or, heaven forbid, taxi
driver. They expect white collar jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Naimi said it is a difficult dynamic to overcome. "They are knocking
on our door daily, saying, 'It is my right to have a job.' "</TE>
<TE>   When Asef, the political science student, and his friends reflect on
the changing reality around them, they express anger and confusion.
"Everything here is American," Asef said. "This building is made by
Americans; you go to the hospital, it is American; but the kingdom
doesn't like American politics against Islam."</TE>
<TE>   Tensions--between East and West, hope and reality--are visible in
downtown Riyadh on any Thursday night, the first day of the weekend.
Young people have one thing on their minds: finding something fun to do.
But movie theaters and dance clubs are not permitted.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment means either sneaking into malls--which on the weekends
are restricted to families--going to a coffee house, taking a drive or
staying home absorbed in Internet chat rooms. Many young men in Riyadh
said that whenever possible they make the 2 1/2-hour drive to neighboring
Bahrain, where they can meet with Eastern European "hostesses" and drink
alcohol openly. In Jidda, young men said they often try to meet up with
foreign women who work as flight attendants for Saudi Arabian Airlines
and live in a compound within the city.</TE>
<TE>Stoplight Offers Chance for a Brief Encounter</TE>
<TE>   For many, there is not much else to do but cruise. Along Olaya Street,
Riyadh's main drag, traffic police are out in force. The road is clogged
with cars packed with young men cruising. New Suburbans and Mercedes and
Chevrolets jam the intersections. Women are not allowed to drive in Saudi
Arabia, but they're easy to spot--sitting alone in the back seat.</TE>
<TE>   At a red light, four young men in a Chevy Lumina pull alongside a car
carrying a woman. They turn on their overhead lamp, take off their
traditional scarf headdresses, put baseball caps on backward and turn up
the music. The seated young men begin to dance wildly, rocking the car as
they try to get the woman's attention with herky-jerky hand motions
reminiscent of Michael Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   The woman peers at them through her veil. Then the light changes, the
men lower the music and speed off.</TE>
<TE>   If the religious police--volunteers organized by the state-financed
General Presidency for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of
Vice--had spotted them, the young men probably would have been taken in
and their parents called.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the Faisaliah mall, a year-old monument to Western-style
consumerism, Korni wasn't any luckier.</TE>
<TE>   Though single men are not allowed in the shopping center on weekends,
Korni and his friends persuaded the guards to let them in. Their liberty
was short-lived: The religious enforcers expelled them before they were
able to score a phone number.</TE>
<TE>   Dejected, the three young men left the ultramodern marble-and-glass
building for the street, where they said they would drive around--looking
for women.</TE>

<HD>Parks Defends Performance, Calls Hahn Stand a Surprise</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn announced his
opposition to another term for Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, the chief
defended his credentials as a reformer Wednesday and said he was
surprised by the mayor's stance.</LD>
<LD>   "When I hear people talk about these conflicts [with the mayor],
that's news to me," the chief said, adding that he intends to stay on the
job and await a decision on his future by the Los Angeles Police
Commission. The five-member body, appointed by Hahn, is due to decide his
fate in coming weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "The commission has said it's not over," Parks said. "All I can do is
believe that on face value."</LD>
<TE>   Asked why he thought Hahn didn't want him to remain as chief, Parks,
58, was uncharacteristically brief: "I don't know," he said. "I don't try
to evaluate. I just come to work."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, meanwhile, further defended his stand Wednesday, even as he
endured an awkward moment at a previously scheduled Black History Month
celebration attended by allies of Parks. At one point, Hahn was snubbed
by William Elkins, a longtime aide to the late Mayor Tom Bradley, who
declined to shake his hand.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in front of City Hall later in the day, Hahn said, "I tried
to make this decision on what I believe is best for the department and
best for the city, and I hope that the public will look at the entire
record before they come to any conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn drew support Wednesday from some leading community activists,
including black civil rights attorney Connie Rice.</TE>
<TE>   His announcement Tuesday that he would not support a second five-year
term for Parks pleased the police union, which opposes the chief's
reappointment, but tests the mayor's longtime support among African
American leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission President Rick Caruso has said the board will rely
on its own, independent evaluation of the chief, not the mayor's
recommendation, to make its choice.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, who had not immediately commented after Hahn's announcement,
broke his silence Wednesday, speaking on public radio station KPCC in the
morning, and again in an interview with The Times in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Parks appeared calm and relaxed during the lengthy interview at Parker
Center, and even gave the impression of being in an agreeable mood,
despite the difficulty of his position.</TE>
<TE>   At first he declined to speak at length, saying he didn't want to
publicly debate the mayor, but he later consented to talk in detail,
seeming especially eager to discuss various aspects of reform efforts
underway in the department.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said he's not ready to retire. He wouldn't say what he might do
if he loses his job, but talked about what he would do if he kept
it--continue to improve police service, he said, and further improve how
officers treat people.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason I reapplied is that, as a public servant, I have a lot to
offer the community," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The chief defended his record on implementing a federal consent
decree, which mandates reforms designed in part to improve LAPD oversight
of officer misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has accused the LAPD of "falling short in its implementation of
reform," faulting Parks for having opposed the consent decree and the
collection of data to track racial profiling.</TE>
<TE>   "He's opposed to police reform in the context that I believe in it,"
the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   Parks countered Wednesday that the department has been "striving every
day to comply" with the decree, a viewpoint supported by representatives
for Los Angeles City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo, who has publicly backed
Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Parks further touted his reform accomplishments--especially a series
of rapid changes to the LAPD's disciplinary system in response to
concerns raised by the Christopher Commission in 1991, and by other
outside critics.</TE>
<TE>   He dismissed the idea that reform had been sluggish under his
leadership. "Anyone who would say that hasn't watched what has happened
in this department," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Parks also countered criticism that he has ignored the problem of low
morale among LAPD rank-and-file officers, a central complaint of the
Police Protective League. Tim McOsker, Hahn's chief of staff, said the
chief has not paid adequate attention to improving morale. The mayor
"would like to see the morale issue addressed--it is one of the many jobs
of a general manager," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Parks responded that the need to improve disciplinary standards is
paramount and that the rapid changes the department has undergone were
bound to be disconcerting to many officers.</TE>
<TE>   "We are holding officers accountable for their actions. If they find
that to be distasteful, I don't think that means we shouldn't hold them
accountable," he said. "What we are trying to do is serve 4 million
people."</TE>
<TE>   Aides to Hahn said that philosophical disagreements between the mayor
and the chief on such issues as community policing and discipline are
significant, and argued that the end of the chief's first term is the
appropriate time to address such differences.</TE>
<TE>   But Parks expressed a different view, saying he "had never had a cross
word" with Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised--yeah," he added, shrugging, "but that's something you
live with."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hahn faced some of the chief's dismayed African American
allies at the Black History Month event.</TE>
<TE>   The participants in the celebration, which was organized weeks ago,
stuck to the program, but there was an undercurrent of tension as several
of those present used the opportunity to remind Hahn of their
disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   His head bowed, Hahn listened as the Rev. Perry Jones of the Messiah
Baptist Church gave an invocation before more than 100 people gathered in
the unseasonably warm sun in a plaza outside City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Jones gave thanks to God for the integration of the LAPD and the rise
of Parks through the ranks.</TE>
<TE>   "Master, we thank you for the victories that we've experienced."</TE>
<TE>   As Jones spoke, the dignitaries on the stage bowed their heads and
clasped hands. But longtime Bradley aide Elkins, who stood beside Mayor
Hahn, kept his hands behind his back.</TE>
<TE>   Elkins was one of about a dozen black leaders who met with Hahn over
the last month, lobbying the mayor to back Parks for a second term. On
Monday night, Hahn told Elkins and others that he would be going against
the chief.</TE>
<TE>   Elkins was scheduled to introduce the mayor, and a few moments after
the prayer ended, he briefly praised Hahn's two decades of public
service, which includes a long stint as city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of us are convinced that Jim Hahn will reach out to ensure that
we have diversity not just in the work force of the city of Los Angeles,
but in every area of our day-to-day lives," he said pointedly.</TE>
<TE>   Then Hahn rose to his feet and moved to shake Elkins' hand. But Elkins
turned and walked past him.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters later, the mayor acknowledged that his rejection
of the black police chief at the beginning of Black History Month was
"poor timing," but said he felt compelled to speak his mind after Parks
announced his intention to seek a second term.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people elect you to make tough decisions," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's actions continued to draw a diverse array of reactions
Wednesday. Some black leaders characterized the move as a betrayal--a
slap in the face of the African American community, which strongly
supported his election.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been acting like he's the best friend the black community ever
had, and it's a lie," said Najee Ali, executive director of Project
Islamic HOPE.</TE>
<TE>   Ali was speaking at a protest demonstration in Leimert Park on
Wednesday night, where about 50 Parks supporters gathered. They
threatened a recall election and chanted, "Hey hey, ho ho, Mayor Hahn has
got to go!"</TE>
<TE>   But another prominent African American, civil rights attorney Rice,
who once headed the NAACP Legal Defense Fund's Los Angeles office, said
she believes Hahn did the right thing.</TE>
<TE>   While the anger at Hahn is understandable, she said, "I think the
decision is the right decision." said Rice, a frequent LAPD critic.</TE>
<TE>   Rice disputed Parks' contention that he has done much to implement
recommended Christopher Commission reforms. "This department has not ever
completely accepted the Christopher Commission reform mandate," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Others who spoke out in favor of the mayor's choice included Gary
Greenebaum, who served as then-Mayor Richard Riordan's first Police
Commission president.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the three main criteria he listed, beginning with lack of
reform, I think it was an honest and courageous decision," he said,
adding:</TE>
<TE>   "This mayor has had a long, deep and personal relationship with the
African American community, and it seems as though there's no trust that
he's acting out of his convictions."</TE>
<TE>   Attorney George Kieffer, a Hahn advisor, said the mayor was worried
that his decision would spark an angry reaction, but felt he had to do
what he thinks is best.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, other city leaders urged calm, saying a rancorous debate
over the chief would detract from public safety.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to keep the city together," said Miguel Contreras, head of
the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. "Don't forget, we're
still a country at war with terrorism. We need to have some stability
here in Los Angeles. We need to make sure our airports are safe, our
ports are safe, our citizens are safe."</TE>

<HD>Tenet Warns of More Attacks</HD>
<DH>Senate: CIA chief says Al Qaeda is badly damaged but still able to
harm U.S. and its allies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Nearly five months after deadly attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon, the nation's top intelligence officials said Wednesday
that Osama bin Laden's terrorist network has been badly damaged around
the world but still plans further attacks against America and its allies.</LD>
<LD>   "We know they'll hurt us again," George J. Tenet, head of the CIA and
the national intelligence community, warned the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence in his first public appearance before Congress since
Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Despite military victories in Afghanistan--and the arrest of nearly
1,000 suspected Al Qaeda operatives in more than 60 countries--Tenet said
Bin Laden's terrorist network "has not yet been destroyed."</LD>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence has confirmed the death of only two of Al Qaeda's
top 10 leaders in Afghanistan, and Tenet said those who escaped "are
working to reconstitute the organization and to resume its terrorist
operations."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet said he does not know if Bin Laden is alive. Bin Laden
disappeared from U.S. surveillance in eastern Afghanistan in early
December, and intelligence officials have said they believe he eluded
capture and is hiding in the region.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA director and intelligence chiefs from the Pentagon, the
Justice Department and the State Department provided their first public
assessment since last fall of suspected terrorist plots and capabilities
around the globe. Delivering their annual report to Congress on worldwide
threats, they also provided sobering new insights into the Bush
administration's war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet declined to characterize the Sept. 11 attacks as an intelligence
failure and said the U.S. has thwarted other strikes and succeeded in
Afghanistan largely because of the "heroic effort" of the nation's spy
community.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bin Laden had sought to acquire or develop a nuclear weapon,
for example, Tenet warned that documents recovered from former Al Qaeda
labs and other facilities in Afghanistan showed the group had focused
more on biological warfare agents and weapons.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush is seeking nearly $6 billion in his current budget
request for dealing with possible attacks involving bioterrorism. So far,
the FBI says no evidence has linked Al Qaeda to the nation's deadliest
bioterrorism attack: the still-unsolved anthrax mailings last fall that
resulted in five deaths and at least 22 illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, Tenet said, operatives "have considered" attacks
against "high-profile government or private facilities, famous landmarks
and U.S. infrastructure nodes, such as airports, bridges, harbors and
dams."</TE>
<TE>   Overseas, he added, Al Qaeda cells already in place have plans to
strike U.S. and allied targets in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and
Southeast Asia. U.S. diplomatic and military facilities are at "high
risk," he said, especially in East Africa, Israel, Saudi Arabia and
Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   "Their modus operandi is to have multiple attack plans in the works
simultaneously and to have Al Qaeda cells in place to conduct them," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet singled out Somalia as a country "in which groups sympathetic to
Al Qaeda have offered terrorists an operational base and potential
haven."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has deployed warships off the African
country's coast to intercept ships thought to be carrying Al Qaeda
members on the run and recently increased military reconnaissance flights
and other surveillance activities over the country.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Pentagon last week began military exercises off the
coast of Somalia's neighbor, Kenya, involving helicopter landings and
more than 2,400 Marines.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet emphasized the dangers from what he called a "convergence" of
threats from terrorists and other hostile forces, their search for
weapons of mass destruction, and the economic, political and social
tensions that give rise to them and other extremist groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Never before have the dangers been more clear or more present," he
said. Specific plots to bomb U.S. embassies or other targets have been
detected and prevented in recent months in France, Turkey, Singapore,
Yemen, Bosnia and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet said the U.S.-led campaign to deny Al Qaeda its haven, command
center and training camps in Afghanistan had dealt "severe blows" to the
group and its leaders. Bin Laden "did not believe we would invade his
sanctuary," Tenet said. "He saw the United States as soft, impatient,
unprepared and fearful of a long, bloody war of attrition."</TE>
<TE>   The combination of precision airstrikes, commando raids, high-tech
surveillance and local ground forces obviously worked, said Vice Adm.
Thomas R. Wilson, head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, which provides
military intelligence to the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda, Wilson said, "has suffered a loss of prestige, institutional
memory, contacts and financial assets that will ultimately degrade its
effectiveness." Even if Bin Laden survives, he added, "his ability to
execute centralized control over a worldwide network has been
diminished."</TE>
<TE>   If Bin Laden is killed or captured, Wilson added, "there is no
identified successor capable of rallying so many divergent nationalities,
interests and groups" to re-create Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet said Iraq's leader, Saddam Hussein, has responded to America's
war on terrorism by launching "a political and diplomatic charm offensive
to make it appear that Baghdad is becoming more flexible."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's regime has "had contacts" with Al Qaeda, Tenet said. "Their
ties may be limited by divergent ideologies, but the two sides' mutual
antipathy toward the United States and the Saudi royal family suggests
that tactical cooperation between them is possible."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet said initial signs that Iran would cooperate with the U.S. over
Afghanistan "are being eclipsed" by recent reports that Tehran has
allowed Al Qaeda members to cross its border and has sent security agents
into western Afghanistan to reassert ties to local tribal chiefs.</TE>

<HD>9/11 Flag Rises Above the IOC Fray</HD>
<DH>Olympics: U.S. athletes will be allowed to carry the symbol after
all.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY HARVEY</AU>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>Balancing an extraordinary wave of American patriotism against
international protocol, Olympic officials decided Wednesday that the torn
and tattered U.S. flag recovered at ground zero on Sept. 11 will be
carried at Friday night's Winter Olympics opening ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier in the week, a subcommittee of the International Olympic
Committee inflamed U.S. passions by saying the flag could be raised at
the ceremony--but not carried by American athletes during the parade of
nations.</LD>
<LD>   That decision, revealed by IOC and United States Olympic Committee
members Tuesday afternoon, drew waves of criticism. Radio talk show lines
lighted up across the nation and the USOC received nearly 100 e-mails and
dozens of phone calls at its headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colo. Mitt
Romney, president of the Salt Lake City Organizing Committee, released a
statement to the media supporting the plan. Then, hours later, he
released another saying he "respectfully disagreed" with it.</LD>
<TE>   In a reversal Wednesday morning, IOC officials announced that at least
six U.S. athletes scheduled to compete here and two policemen from the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will serve as an honor guard
carrying the flag into Rice-Eccles Stadium during the ceremony, probably
before the parade of athletes from the 77 nations participating here from
Feb. 8 to 24.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be a solemn, highly dignified procession," Francois
Carrard, director general of the IOC, said during a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   He also said the flag will be raised over the stadium during the
playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner" and "the American flag will be
floated all over the world."</TE>
<TE>   But Romney said later that the flag is too fragile to be hoisted onto
the pole. He said it would be held during the playing of the national
anthem.</TE>
<TE>   Buried in rubble for three days before it was discovered, the flag
suffered two large tears. It flew most recently inside New Orleans'
Superdome during Sunday's Super Bowl, but it was not subjected to the
inclement weather conditions anticipated for the opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Even under normal circumstances, there often are clashes during the
Games between the host nation's fervor for its own athletes and the ideal
of the Olympics as an event designed to bring nations together in peace,
friendship and harmony.</TE>
<TE>   Officials and athletes from other countries protested most loudly
during the most recent Games in the United States, the Summer Olympics in
Los Angeles in 1984 and Atlanta in 1996, because of the U.S. television
networks' focus on American athletes, creating an impression worldwide
that Americans believed the Games were first and foremost about
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "We as a country can cheer a little loudly and, to some countries,
that is overbearing," Romney said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, local organizers have faced the dilemma of balancing
the extraordinary wave of American patriotism against an international
sensitivity to American jingoism.</TE>
<TE>   "Every country in the IOC has issues," said Anita DeFrantz, the senior
member of the IOC in the United States. "As Americans, we have to
understand it's a world event and also that we are a guest even though we
are the host nation."</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating the situation were the political ambitions of a
couple of the key players: Romney, a former U.S. Senate candidate in
Massachusetts who is widely believed to be contemplating another run for
office, and USOC President Sandra Baldwin, a candidate for membership in
the IOC. Both were aware that missteps could cost them political capital.</TE>
<TE>   But even IOC officials recognized that a special accommodation to
American emotions had to be made after gauging public reaction Tuesday.
One USOC official, who requested anonymity, said the IOC was facing a
"public relations nightmare" after the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, which is in charge of the ground zero flag, leaked to the media
that a USOC proposal regarding the opening ceremony had been rejected by
the IOC.</TE>
<TE>   Whether that actually occurred is a matter of interpretation. Mike
Moran, USOC spokesman, said Baldwin met with the IOC's coordination
commission Saturday and recommended that five U.S. athletes and a USOC
official carry the ground zero flag into the stadium after the U.S. team
had entered during the parade of athletes. The coordination commission
serves as the IOC's liaison and inspection team for the Games.</TE>
<TE>   The commission, Moran said, replied that the proposal would violate
IOC protocol and a compromise was reached--the flag would be raised above
the stadium during the ceremony, as it had been during the World Series
and Super Bowl. Baldwin approved that idea.</TE>
<TE>   But when the story leaked Tuesday, there was a wave of criticism as
the subject became fodder for national talk show hosts and their callers.</TE>
<TE>   Romney, whose plan from the beginning had been to feature the ground
zero flag and other remembrances of Sept. 11 in festivities at the
stadium before the opening ceremony officially began, denied that his
change of heart was motivated by politics. Romney, who lost to Edward M.
Kennedy in a run for the Senate in Massachusetts in 1994, has been
mentioned as a future candidate for governor in that state and in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   "It was important to me that the victims of 9/11 were honored and that
it be clear that our organization stood with the USOC on this issue,"
Romney said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the initial USOC proposal would honor Sept. 11 victims,
firefighters and police officers by "connecting them to the spirit of the
Olympians."</TE>
<TE>   But the IOC subcommittee's compromise solution did not sit well with
Dwight Bell, the U.S. team's delegation chief, who along with several
athletes reacted negatively to the plan and protested.</TE>
<TE>   Romney contacted IOC President Jacques Rogge, who, along with other
members of the executive board, had never been formally presented with
any plan other than the one agreed upon by the coordination commission
and Baldwin. They arranged a meeting Tuesday at 9 p.m. at Rogge's
temporary office in the Little America Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Romney and Rogge, others present were Carrard, IOC
vice-president R. Kevan Gosper of Australia, DeFrantz, several
administrative assistants and three public relations experts. One was
Steve Coltrin, a well-known political campaign operative who is working
as an outside consultant for the local organizing committee. Baldwin, who
would be elected as an IOC member Wednesday, joined later.</TE>
<TE>   One person present described the discussions as "animated."</TE>
<TE>   But, by 11:30 p.m., a compromise had been reached.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the USOC, IOC and SLOC all said they were pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "The solution we have reached is viewed as excellent by the USOC,"
said Bob Ctvrtlik, an IOC member and USOC executive committee member from
Newport Beach. "I'm sure the athletes will feel the same way."</TE>
<TE>   The official U.S. flag-bearer, who will lead the U.S. team into the
stadium, and the athletes who will serve on the honor guard for the
ground zero flag, were to have been elected by their fellow athletes on
Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   The flag, Moran said, might also be present during a meeting between
President Bush and the U.S. athletes here Friday.</TE>

<HD>Bank Accuses U.S. Trader of Losing $750 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ireland's biggest bank said Wednesday that a rogue employee
involved in currency trading secretly lost $750 million at its U.S.
subsidiary, jolting the European markets and triggering a federal
criminal investigation into another financial debacle.</LD>
<LD>   The suspected fraud at Allied Irish Banks' Baltimore-based subsidiary,
Allfirst Bank, would be one of the biggest trading scandals since
Singapore dealer Nick Leeson brought down Britain's Barings Bank in 1995
after piling up $1.4 billion in concealed losses.</LD>
<LD>   Allied Irish said John Rusnak, a 37-year-old employee who was
well-regarded in his seven years at the bank, ran up the losses over the
course of last year at Allfirst Bank, where he was part of a small but
aggressive currency trading operation.</LD>
<TE>   As federal authorities launched a criminal investigation, Allied Irish
suspended five Allfirst employees including Rusnak, saying he may have
colluded with other employees and outsiders. The bank said the trader had
created bogus option contracts that were supposed to insure against
trading losses but in fact concealed them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a fraud," Allfirst Bank spokesman Philip Hosmer said. In
calling in the FBI, executives were "absolutely looking at collusion,
internal and external," Hosmer said. "That's a big part of the
investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Rusnak has not been charged with any crime. His attorney, Bruce
Lamdin, declined to answer when asked if Rusnak had profited from any
trading irregularities. Lamdin said he believed that the bank's losses
are being "grossly exaggerated" and suggested Allied Irish is trying to
isolate itself from blame.</TE>
<TE>   No customers lost money and the bank remains well-capitalized, with no
chance of collapsing, bank officials and regulators said. Allfirst is the
nation's 44th largest bank holding company with $17.8 billion in assets
and more than 250 branches in the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The news sent financial stocks tumbling, with Allied Irish down 16%,
its steepest decline in 12 years. Amid ongoing revelations of wrongdoing
at Enron Corp., the bankrupt energy trader that overstated earnings by
$1.3 billion, the case raised more disconcerting questions about the
financial oversight exercised by companies, their auditors and
regulators.</TE>
<TE>   "There was clearly a horrible breakdown of internal controls here,"
said Bert Ely, a banking consultant in Alexandria, Va., who was involved
in sorting out many of the failures in the savings and loan industry a
decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   An Allfirst spokesman said an internal audit turned up discrepancies
last week in accounts handled by Rusnak. The bank said he was suspended
after failing to answer questions or report to work since Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Lamdin said Rusnak spent much of Wednesday talking with federal
prosecutors and returned to his wife and two children, ages 6 and 8, for
the night.</TE>
<TE>   Lamdin, who said he and co-counsel David Irwin had spent just three
hours debriefing Rusnak, wouldn't discuss the case in detail, saying the
facts are still unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Agents from the Federal Reserve Board joined the FBI and other federal
authorities in investigating Allfirst. Fed spokesman David Skidmore said
the agency is working closely with the Irish Central Bank, that country's
main banking regulator.</TE>
<TE>   An official at the U.S. attorney's office in Baltimore said
investigators have found no indication that Rusnak attempted to steal
money, though he could still face federal fraud charges for manipulating
financial records.</TE>
<TE>   "What it looks like is that he [Rusnak] made some bad trades and did
some things he shouldn't have to hide what he'd done," said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why Rusnak would fake trades to cover up losses, Allied Irish
Treasurer Pat Ryan said "some people do it for personal gain, some people
do it because it's a pride issue [and because] they're unable to own up
to a mistake. Many can start with a small mistake and the thing
snowballs."</TE>
<TE>   Lamdin described Rusnak, who the bank said earned $85,000 a year, as
"just an ordinary guy in a volatile job, one that not many people can
do."</TE>
<TE>   Raised in a working-class suburb of Philadelphia, Rusnak left a
high-pressure job in New York to move to Baltimore, where he bought a
house for $217,500 in 1994, according to acquaintances and records. An
active Catholic with children in a parochial school, Rusnak was on the
board of Baltimore Clayworks, a nonprofit ceramics center, but he skipped
many meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always distracted by work. At least I assumed it was work,"
said Margery Pozefsky, a board member. "He kept volunteering to solicit
contributions from people in the banking industry, but he never really
came through. I always got the feeling that he didn't really have the
connections to people that high up."</TE>
<TE>   Major banks such as Allfirst are the biggest players in the
$1-trillion-a-day foreign currency trading market, which is largely
unregulated worldwide. It has no central clearinghouse, like the New York
Stock Exchange, and no central regulator, like the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Banks trade currencies partly to make a profit and partly to help
their international corporate customers, though customer money isn't
usually at risk. The trading that goes on over electronic systems
establishes the daily exchange rate that individuals and corporations use
in trading, say, euro dollars for U.S. dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Banks typically aim for incremental profits, made in a matter of
minutes or hours, not days or weeks, said analyst Elvis Picardo at Global
Securities Corp. in Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   "Not many people know what goes on behind the scenes," said Picardo, a
former currency trader in India. "You very seldom get a breakdown from
banks on how much foreign currency trading they're doing. It's an
extremely volatile market, and has the potential for large losses."</TE>
<TE>   Allfirst Bank's parent company, Allfirst Financial, for instance,
lists "trading income" of $5.1 million for the third quarter last year
but never explains whether that came only from the currency market. The
income represents about 5% of its noninterest income and 10% of net
income.</TE>
<TE>   The bank's income from trading doesn't sound like much, Picardo said,
but "a $750-million loss is an enormous chunk."</TE>
<TE>   With concerns raised over financial disclosures stemming from the
collapses of Enron and other major companies, regulators might try to
turn the light on foreign currency trading operations at banks. "The area
definitely needs more disclosure," Picardo said.</TE>
<TE>   Hosmer, the bank spokesman, said Rusnak disabled internal controls
designed to prevent such a fraud, but bank officials began asking
questions last week when an employee noticed something irregular about
the foreign currency trading desk.</TE>
<TE>   By late Sunday, Hosmer said, the bank launched an investigation. What
they found, he said, were the bogus options that were supposed to be a
hedge against trading losses.</TE>
<TE>   The way it was supposed to work was for the bank to trade, say, $50
million in U.S. currency for Japanese yen on the belief that the yen
would rise against the dollar, giving the bank a profit when it sold the
yen. As insurance against losses on the bet, the bank would pay for an
option to buy U.S. dollars in case the yen fell instead. Such hedges are
designed to lessen or eliminate any losses.</TE>
<TE>   But what Allfirst executives found was that the option contracts
entered into the bank's system were bogus, Hosmer said. That meant that
$750 million in trading losses over the last year or so weren't covered.</TE>
<TE>   The loss will have a major impact on the bank's earnings last year,
which were $149.5 million for the first nine months, and the company may
well have to restate earnings for prior periods. It also will lower key
capital ratios that banking regulators use to assess the strength of
financial institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Even taking such a hit, Allfirst will remain well above the mark for
well-capitalized banks, analysts said. But the Standard &amp; Poors rating
agency placed Allfirst Bank, Allfirst Financial and Allied Irish Banks on
credit watch with the implication that the solid A and A+ ratings on its
debt securities may be lowered.</TE>
<TE>   Investors punished Allied Irish's stock. In London, Allied Irish
shares plunged 15%. In the United States, Allied Irish Banks' American
depositary receipts fell $3.78 each, closing at $19.77 per ADR.</TE>

<HD>4 Killed During Attack at Jewish Settlement</HD>
<DH>Mideast: A Palestinian shoots an Israeli soldier, then a woman and
her child before being slain.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Three Israelis, including a woman and her daughter, were killed
when a Palestinian gunman invaded a home in a Jewish settlement in the
Jordan Valley on Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   The attack began as Prime Minister Ariel Sharon left Israel for
Washington, where he is scheduled to meet President Bush at the White
House today to press him to sever ties with the Palestinian Authority. It
came on a day of mounting tension, with Israeli security forces
uncovering a cache of missiles in the West Bank, thwarting a suicide
attack on a Jerusalem bus and shooting dead a 16-year-old Palestinian in
the Gaza Strip.</LD>
<LD>   At midnight Wednesday, Israeli gunships retaliated with missile
strikes on the West Bank city of Nablus, reportedly hitting the
Palestinian Authority headquarters there and injuring 11 people.</LD>
<TE>   The day's deadliest attack began about 8 p.m., when a man with an M-16
rifle infiltrated the greenhouses of Moshav Hamra, a farming community of
35 families at the north end of the Jordan Valley in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army said he shot a soldier before storming into a home
and killing a mother and daughter. He was then shot dead.</TE>
<TE>   According to media reports, the gunman wore an Israeli army uniform
and carried eight ammunition clips and grenades. The victims were
identified as Miriam Ohana, 50, her 11-year-old daughter Yael and reserve
soldier Moshe Mekonen Megos. Ohana opened the door for her killer,
apparently believing that he was an Israeli soldier, Israeli radio
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian militants consider Jewish settlements legitimate military
targets, arguing that they are built on land claimed by the Palestinians.
The Israeli government says the settlers are civilians and should not
come under fire.</TE>
<TE>   Aides traveling with Sharon, who landed at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington shortly after 10 p.m. Eastern time Wednesday, blamed
the Palestinian Authority and vowed that there would be a swift response.</TE>
<TE>   Both the radical Islamic group Hamas and a military wing of
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, the Al
Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, claimed responsibility for the attack.</TE>
<TE>   During the shooting, nearby residents cowered in their homes. They
were told to remain locked inside this morning while the army continued
to search for any accomplices.</TE>
<TE>   "People are inside their houses, they don't know what is happening,
but they hear bombs outside," Orit Arzieli, a spokeswoman for the Jordan
Valley Regional Council, said in an interview as the incident unfolded.
Soldiers combed Hamra's grounds for hours, firing flares as they searched
for possible accomplices.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan Valley settlers have complained for months that a combination
of economic problems in their agricultural communities and Palestinian
shooting attacks on the valley's main north-south road is driving
Israelis out of the contested area.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Wednesday, the army said it had seized eight missiles and a
launcher in the West Bank--the first time such missiles had been found
there. The militant Islamic movement Hamas has fired similar missiles in
the Gaza Strip. The missiles, which have a range of about eight miles,
could hit cities in the heart of Israel from the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The army said it found the weapons hidden under a load of vegetables
on a Palestinian truck that was traveling from Nablus to the town of
Jenin. Both communities are Palestinian-ruled and intensely active in the
fight against Israeli occupation that has raged since September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The missiles were intended to "threaten Israeli cities," Israeli Brig.
Gen. Gershon Yitzhak told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat has called for armed extremists to halt attacks on Israelis and
has told the Bush administration that he has been arresting militants and
closing makeshift arms factories in the Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   But Palestinians continued to strike inside Israel on Wednesday. In
the early afternoon, a man boarded a bus in Jerusalem bound for the West
Bank settlement of Maale Adumim and sat down next to driver Zion Shoval.</TE>
<TE>   "His coat was open, and I could see all the wires--I was already
suspicious, but when I saw his hand constantly pulling at something in
his pocket, I yelled to a man near me, 'Grab his hand!' " Shoval told
Israel Television.</TE>
<TE>   Shoval stopped the bus, and police arrested the man.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, a Palestinian teenager was shot to death by Israeli
troops during clashes in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian sources said.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Vice President Dick Cheney will travel to 10 nations in the Middle
East next month, including Israel and four states bordering Iraq, a top
aide said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Among Cheney's stops will be Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Turkey and Kuwait.
All four neighbor Iraq, which President Bush last week named as part of
an "axis of evil," along with Iran and North Korea.</LD>
<LD>   There has been wide speculation that Iraq could be the next target of
the U.S. war on terrorism after the campaign that toppled the Taliban
regime in Afghanistan, which hosted accused Sept. 11 mastermind Osama bin
Laden.</LD>
<TE>   "The vice president will hold wide-ranging discussions on matters of
mutual interest, including our ongoing campaign against terrorism and
other regional security issues," top Cheney aide Mary Matalin said.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's trip will also include Egypt, the United Arab Emirates,
Bahrain, Qatar and Oman. He will also stop in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   Aides sought to tamp down expectations that the trip might seek to
promote the Middle East peace process between Israel and the
Palestinians. Matalin said Cheney had no plans to meet with Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat.</TE>

<HD>Queen Marks 50 Years of Rule</HD>
<DH>Britain: Instead of secluding herself as usual, the monarch opens a
cancer ward on the anniversary of the day her father died.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET STOBART</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>Queen Elizabeth II marked 50 years as Britain's monarch Wednesday,
but it was no day of celebration: The anniversary also marks the day her
father, King George VI, died unexpectedly when she was a young princess
on holiday.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the queen broke with her usual tradition of staying in seclusion
at the royal estate at Sandringham in Norfolk, about 100 miles northeast
of London, where her father died. In a significant gesture, she opened a
cancer ward at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in the nearby town of King's
Lynn.</LD>
<LD>   Her father, a heavy smoker, suffered from lung cancer before dying of
a coronary thrombosis when Elizabeth was 25.</LD>
<TE>   The queen visited the new Macmillan Cancer Ward, a care and therapy
ward for cancer patients. Wearing a bright green coat and matching hat,
she greeted staff members and chatted with patients--many of whom were
receiving chemotherapy during her visit.</TE>
<TE>   The queen mother, the widow of King George and now 101 years old,
stayed at Sandringham and attended a morning church service there. She is
said to be recovering from a cold.</TE>
<TE>   The anniversary, known officially as Accession Day, has always been a
commemorative rather than a celebratory event in the royal calendar.</TE>
<TE>   This year, it was marked with a 62-gun royal salute from the Tower of
London, the booms echoing over the Thames River, and a 41-gun salute in
London's Hyde Park.</TE>
<TE>   Before a crowd of tourists and royal fans, the King's Troop, Royal
Horse Artillery--named by the queen's father--galloped through the park,
pulling World War I cannons, which were loaded and fired by soldiers in
gold-braided uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   The day was also marked in modern fashion, with an Internet message
from the queen to her subjects thanking them for their "loyalty and
support."</TE>
<TE>   Fifty years ago, Princess Elizabeth was on an official visit to Kenya
with her husband, Prince Philip.</TE>
<TE>   She was spending a short break at a safari park in an exotic but
somewhat primitive treehouse, a gift to British royalty from the Kenyan
government.</TE>
<TE>   Named Treetops, it literally was at the top of a tree, accessible only
by a ladder. It was here that she learned of her father's death through
the limited communication systems of the time.</TE>
<TE>   As her cousin Lady Pamela Hicks recalled on television, "She went up
that ladder a princess and came down in the morning a queen."</TE>

<HD>'Little Something' Takes Big Toll on Kenya's People</HD>
<DH>Africa: Poll illustrates how a national culture of bribes oppresses
citizens, who sometimes lose up to a third of their pay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya
</DL>
<LD>Dan Kamau has a bevy of "friends" who pay regular visits to his
general goods store.</LD>
<LD>   One of them is a customs officer who for a small fee helps Kamau evade
duties on the electronic equipment he imports from Dubai. Another is a
city tax collector who demands a small payment to keep quiet about
Kamau's lack of a business license. Then there is the ever-cheerful
police officer who almost weekly demands kitu kidogo--"a little
something" in Swahili--for nothing in particular.</LD>
<LD>   "I've come to know them very well," said Kamau, who didn't want to
give his real name. "It's the way of doing business. You have to give
something to get something done."</LD>
<TE>   Kenya is well known for its rampant corruption. Year after year, the
anti-corruption group Transparency International ranks this East African
country as having among the most corrupt public officials in the world.</TE>
<TE>   But for the first time, a survey by Transparency's local chapter has
shown how ordinary Kenyans are affected by day-to-day petty bribery,
known here as the culture of kitu kidogo. Urban Kenyans pay an average of
16 bribes a month, the survey of about 1,200 people found, and six out of
10 residents reported that they routinely bribe the police.</TE>
<TE>   Some Kenyans pay about $100 monthly for bribes--almost a third of
their paychecks.</TE>
<TE>   Poor Kenyans recounted to researchers how they fork over bribe money
to acquire passports, get driver's licenses or even secure treatment from
public hospitals. Researchers also heard how some police officers pay
superiors so they can patrol routes with the best prospects of extorting
heftier bribes from rich businesspeople and foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   Transparency International released its findings three days after
Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi hired a three-member British team to
review his government's anti-corruption measures. Critics dismissed Moi's
move as a public relations gimmick aimed at appeasing the nation's
international lenders.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the International Monetary Fund suspended more than
$200 million in loans to Kenya amid concerns that large chunks of the
money would end up in the private bank accounts of a few government
officials. Despite pressure from the IMF and other lenders, Moi has
failed to establish meaningful anti-graft measures. The lack of IMF funds
has helped send the Kenyan economy into a tailspin.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with corruption in Kenya is that it has reached a level
where it has been accepted as a norm," a local newspaper editorialized
after the anti-corruption group published its findings. "Those who refuse
to bribe suffer victimization and . . . might in the end never get
anything done. In some places, to rise against bribery is to invite the
damnation of those who have made corruption their way of life."</TE>
<TE>   Many Kenyans weren't surprised by the survey's findings. For a few
months last year, the song "Nchi ya Kitu Kidogo," or "Land of Bribery,"
topped the country's music charts.</TE>
<TE>   The ditty by 27-year-old Eric Wainaina, a senior at Boston's Berklee
School of Music, refers to a familiar city scene where traffic cops--who
earn about $50 a month--stop taxis for minor infractions and demand "kitu
kidogo ya chai," or "a little something for tea."</TE>
<TE>   "A nation of 'something small' is a nation of small people," Wainaina
crooned to a crowd of journalists, diplomats and leaders of
nongovernmental organizations gathered here recently for the launch of
Transparency's Kenya Urban Bribery Index.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want tea, sir, go buy Ketepa [a popular brand of tea]," sang
Wainaina.</TE>
<TE>   But defying a police officer here often carries a hefty price.
Refusing to pay the equivalent of $1.25 could lead to a significant fine
or an unwanted date with a magistrate.</TE>
<TE>   John Githongo, who heads the Kenyan chapter of Transparency
International, said the survey shows that ordinary Kenyans who refuse to
pay bribes face being dragged through a criminal justice system that "is
corrupt to its core."</TE>
<TE>   But Peter Kimanthi, a spokesman for the Kenyan Police Department,
named by Transparency as the most corrupt institution in the country,
said the survey was unscientific, malicious and meant to embarrass the
government.</TE>
<TE>   Kimanthi acknowledged that some corruption exists in his department,
but he insisted that police officers are no more corrupt than ordinary
Kenyans.</TE>
<TE>   "You need a holistic approach to treat this problem," Kimanthi said.
"The givers of the bribes are breaking the law too."</TE>

<HD>Russians Optimistic About Arms Cuts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. PETERSBURG, Russia
</DL>
<LD>Officials in Russia voiced optimism Wednesday that Moscow and
Washington can agree to steep, legally binding nuclear arms reductions in
time for an accord to be signed during President Bush's planned visit to
the country in May.</LD>
<LD>   In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov said he welcomed
remarks from Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who had confirmed
Tuesday that the United States is working toward putting proposed arms
cuts into a written agreement, either in a protocol signed by both
countries' presidents or a full-fledged treaty.</LD>
<LD>   "If Russia agrees with the United States on the radical reduction of
strategic offensive weapons, all countries . . . will support the
agreements," Ivanov said.</LD>
<TE>   But one Foreign Ministry official, briefing journalists on condition
of anonymity, cautioned that difficult negotiations could still be ahead
because Russia wants to ensure that any arms reductions by the United
States would be irreversible.</TE>
<TE>   That runs counter to the wishes of some U.S. experts, who believe that
the United States should simply warehouse the missiles covered by any
accord and retain the flexibility to put them back into service in an
emergency.</TE>
<TE>   Ivanov said an agreement would be a step forward in U.S.-Russian
relations and would show that both countries are still on track to keep
their arms-control commitments.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed out that when Russian President Vladimir V. Putin visited
Bush at his Texas ranch in November, the two leaders agreed to a new
"framework" of strategic relations, including a reduction of their
nuclear arsenals to between 1,700 and 2,000 warheads within 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush had originally proposed that the reductions be an
unwritten promise between two states that are no longer Cold War enemies
but friends, Putin held out for some document that would bind the United
States to a specific target.</TE>
<TE>   Ivanov reiterated that position Wednesday, saying, "A clear
understanding was reached that agreements on this must be legally binding
on the parties."</TE>
<TE>   A written agreement is important to Putin because he can use it to
show hard-liners in the Russian military that Moscow has received
something in return for its recent concessions to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has been a strong backer of the United States in its war
against terrorism and has quietly acceded to the introduction of U.S.
troops into Central Asia--an area that once was part of the Soviet Union
and that the Russian military establishment still considers part of its
strategic sphere.</TE>
<TE>   Some hard-liners also believe that Moscow has gone along too quietly
with U.S. plans to withdraw from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty,
an agreement that Russia continues to support. The United States has said
it is exercising its right to withdraw from the ABM treaty in order to be
free to pursue testing and construction of a proposed national missile
defense.</TE>
<TE>   In remarks carried by the Interfax news agency, a senior Russian
military official praised Powell for affirming the commitment to an
accord on arms reduction.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite differences on a number of issues, the accord, or series of
accords on mutual cuts to strategic offensive weapons, will, I hope, be
worked out by the spring of 2002," said Col. Gen. Yuri Baluyevsky, the
first deputy chief of staff of the Russian armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   Baluyevsky also dismissed suggestions that have circulated here that
Russia should take some concrete steps to punish the United States for
its move to quit the ABM treaty.</TE>
<TE>   "We could increase the number of deployed missiles and warheads that
they carry, but that would be a road to nowhere, a new round of the arms
race," Baluyevsky said. "Russia doesn't need that, and it wouldn't take
that path."</TE>

<DL>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia
</DL>
<LD>Communal power sharing that will follow Cambodia's first local
elections will help prevent renewed war, Prime Minister Hun Sen said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking to visiting French diplomats at his home in Phnom Penh, the
capital, Hun Sen, whose party swept Sunday's polls, said single-party
control of local politics had been a recipe for violence.</LD>
<LD>   "To avoid war, it was necessary to hold [local] elections and end the
single management of communes," or clusters of villages, Hun Sen was
quoted as saying by his spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   Although Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party won nearly 1,600 of
the 1,621 commune chief positions, its rivals, the royalist FUNCINPEC and
opposition Sam Rainsy Party, secured many deputy chief posts.</TE>

advantage of the horse's need for a total of one hour's rest.</LD>

<HD>Lindh E-Mails Unsympathetic</HD>
<DH>Suspect: Bail is denied to American Talib. Prosecutors release
messages in which he evinces no sorrow for past victims of terror.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.
</DL>
<LD>John Walker Lindh was denied bail Wednesday on charges of taking up
arms against the United States, as prosecutors unveiled a string of
e-mails he sent to his family in California renouncing his citizenship
and offering no sympathy for Americans killed in past terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Although there was little expectation that Lindh would be freed
pending his trial, the tenor of the e-mails and other communication with
his family apparently wasn't lost on U.S. Magistrate W. Curtis Sewell as
he denied the request that Lindh be released to his father's custody.</LD>
<LD>   "The defendant has every incentive to flee," Sewell said. "While it
may be argued or stated today that the defendant is a loyal American, the
evidence before the court belies that assertion."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, a new picture of the 20-year-old Lindh emerges from his
Internet writings abroad--that of a Marin County teenager who seemed to
find a home in the Middle East while also denouncing his American
upbringing. He urged his mother to leave the United States. "I really
don't know what your big attachement [sic] to America is all about," he
wrote in one e-mail. "What has America ever done for anybody?"</TE>
<TE>   He appeared to have such a low regard for the U.S. government that he
said the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa were "more likely to
have been carried out by the American government than by any Muslims."</TE>
<TE>   In his final e-mail home before allegedly entering a terrorist
training camp, he told his family that his new life "really makes me look
upon American society with pity."</TE>
<TE>   In the courtroom, Lindh gave no sign he knew his parents were sitting
behind him. When the 45-minute detention hearing ended, he walked out
briskly without acknowledging their presence.</TE>
<TE>   In asking that Lindh be released, lead defense lawyer James J.
Brosnahan characterized his client not as a terrorist but as a soldier.</TE>
<TE>   "He never fought with Al Qaeda," the San Francisco lawyer said. "He
never signed up for terrorist activity. He never had anything to do with
terrorist activity."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Randy L. Bellows disagreed. "John Lindh is a
committed terrorist. He not only talked the talk but he walked the walk,
carried hand grenades, carried shoulder weapons. Took up [on the] front
line with what he called his Al Qaeda brothers. He can only be viewed by
this court as the most dangerous sort of person."</TE>
<TE>   Sewell concluded that Lindh not only is a danger to the community but
also is "likely" to abscond. The judge further noted that Lindh has "no
social or economic stability" and "no assets or liabilities."</TE>
<TE>   "His record of gainful employment," the judge said, "is limited to a
three-week stint of warehouse work some two years ago."</TE>
<TE>   The government court filing Wednesday outlined Lindh's movements from
California to the Middle East and finally Afghanistan, where he was
captured in November. The filing centered on e-mails and letters home to
his family. Prosecutors used that communication to show that Lindh was so
estranged from his parents that it was ludicrous to allow him to live now
with his father.</TE>
<TE>   Other new evidence showed that Lindh told an FBI interrogator he had
been given three weeks of weapon training and one week of training on
topography. He was taught how to wear battlefield camouflage, to hold
defensive positions and to handle explosives, primarily "grenades and
Molotov cocktails."</TE>
<TE>   Lindh also allegedly told the FBI agent that he wanted to be a martyr
and that, when his unit was told of the Sept. 11 attacks on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon, "they were ordered to dig bunkers and
trenches because the American bombers would soon be arriving."</TE>
<TE>   Questioned further, Lindh said that the Sept. 11 attacks, along with
the 2000 bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen that killed 17 U.S.
sailors, were incidents that "happen in war." Prosecutors, in summarizing
the interrogation, added that Lindh "also stated that he agreed with the
bombing of the USS Cole and stated that the Pentagon was a good target."</TE>
<TE>   But it was the e-mails and letters from Lindh, written during his long
idyll on the other side of the world, that seemed to tell the most about
his thinking. Neither prosecutors nor the defense would discuss how the
government obtained the correspondence.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh left America in May 1998 to pursue Islamic studies in the Middle
East. After repeatedly refusing pleas from his family that he come home,
he did return in 1999, only to leave again in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In a March 1, 2001, e-mail to his mother, Marilyn Walker, he
complained that "I wasted 9 months in America in which I achieved nothing
and forgot much of what I had learned while in Yemen."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was "busy in my studies and I have no intention of
interrupting them for any reason in the near future."</TE>
<TE>   The following month, he again rebuffed his mother's requests to visit
home. "I don't intend to leave Pakistan until I finish what I came here
for," he told her.</TE>
<TE>   He also hardened his views on America, according to his e-mails and
other correspondence. In a letter believed sent in October 1998, he
wrote, "I'm not particularly fond of the idea of returning to America."</TE>
<TE>   In a June 24 e-mail that year, he told his family it was the U.S. that
had instigated the Persian Gulf War when an American official "heavily
encouraged" Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   Following the October 2000 attack on the Cole, he again e-mailed his
family, but that message was not released. Instead, the government
provided the response from his father, Frank Lindh:</TE>
<TE>   "I confess I was taken aback somewhat by your lack of compassion for
the Americans, who after all are only young people your own age who
happened to have taken a job that involved being on a Navy ship."</TE>
<TE>   In a Dec. 3, 2000, e-mail to his mother, he referred to George W. Bush
as "your new president. . . . I'm glad he's not mine."</TE>
<TE>   In subsequent months, he complained that Americans did not know "the
reality of what occurs" in Yemen. He said that if Yemen became an Islamic
state, he would take a wife and build a house in the mountains. Finally
he said he was leaving Yemen for "some cold mountainous region" such as
Afghanistan. "I don't want to see America again," he e-mailed his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh, who turns 21 on Saturday, is to be arraigned Monday, when a
trial date might also be set. With the case moving forward, Brosnahan
expressed frustration that the young American is facing life in prison
when major targets in the U.S. war on terrorism go free.</TE>
<TE>   "We know our people are doing the best they can to find Osama bin
Laden, to find [Mullah Mohammed] Omar and someone who sent the anthrax,"
Brosnahan said. "We understand they're doing the best that they can and
we are with them on that and we hope they are successful.</TE>
<TE>   "Meanwhile, I'd ask the attorney general to not take it out on John
Lindh because, in my view, they have brought up the cannon to shoot the
mouse."</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, asked later for comment, declined except to
say of the judge's ruling denying bail: "I am pleased."</TE>

<HD>Has Bush Overstated North Korean Threat?</HD>
<DH>Asia: Although regime is lumped in an 'axis of evil,' experts say
its dialogue with South has eased regional tensions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>Just how much danger is posed by North Korea, and what should be
done about it?</LD>
<LD>   President Bush's inclusion of North Korea in an "axis of evil" with
Iraq and Iran in last week's State of the Union address has touched off a
raging debate about whether the eccentric Communist regime is as
immediate a menace as the president suggested.</LD>
<LD>   Although there is little doubt that North Korea is armed to the
teeth--the country with a population of only 24 million is said to have
at least the fifth-largest army in the world--the prevailing view is that
the threat has waned because of an effort by South Korean President Kim
Dae Jung to engage the North in dialogue.</LD>
<TE>   Kim's so-called sunshine policy has won him considerable international
support, as well as a Nobel Peace Prize. Germany and Britain are among
the U.S. allies that have opened embassies in Pyongyang, the North Korean
capital, in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Now, South Korea is in political turmoil over Bush's remarks and the
suggestion that the war against terrorism could spill over to the Korean
peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   Newspaper editorials have labeled the U.S. president a "cowboy" bent
on war, while labor unions, church groups and a Buddhist association are
among those that have issued statements this week accusing Bush of
endangering world peace.</TE>
<TE>   And in what was widely viewed as a veiled criticism of Bush, who will
visit South Korea in two weeks, Kim warned in a speech Tuesday to
government appointees that "we must think of the monstrous damage that a
war on the Korean peninsula would cause."</TE>
<TE>   The uproar has to do with one simple sentence in the Jan. 29 speech,
in which Bush said, "North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and
weapons of mass destruction while starving its citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, for all the fuss, few are disputing the truthfulness of
Bush's allegations. Rather, it is the implication that the war against
terrorism should extend to North Korea that has raised objections.</TE>
<TE>   "The basic language about having weapons of mass destruction and
starving its citizens, well, nobody is going to challenge that.
[Instead], it is the nature of the rhetoric, the bombast that is not
backed up by any real policy," said Scott Snyder, the Asia Foundation's
representative in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   William Taylor, a Korea specialist at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington, said that Bush is confusing the
issue of weapons proliferation with the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to deal with missile proliferation and missile
technology, you can do that, but North Korea is not part of any evil
empire connected with the war on terrorism," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, any discussion of how much of a threat is posed by North
Korea is shrouded in partisan politics. In South Korea, as in the United
States, conservatives tend to rail about the Communist menace of North
Korea, while liberals believe that the country merits more sympathy than
fear.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the CIA and State Department have tended to diverge
in their assessments of North Korea, with the latter more swayed by
progress on the diplomatic front to open up isolationist North Korea to
the outside world.</TE>
<TE>   "I always used to call North Korea the long-running failure in the
history of American espionage," said a former intelligence official with
many years of experience on the peninsula. "We are good at assessing
their capabilities but have very little idea about their intentions."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because of its desperate need for humanitarian aid, North
Korea has been on relatively good behavior in the last few years. Since
1998, when the world's nerves were set on edge by a test launch of the
Taepodong missile over Japan, North Korea has observed a moratorium on
missile testing. North Korea's nuclear program at its Yongbyon facility
has been frozen since 1994 through a framework agreement under which a
U.S.-led international consortium is helping the nation build a
light-water reactor to address its energy shortage.</TE>
<TE>   No evidence has emerged of any North Korean connection to the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center and Pentagon. In fact,
Taylor, the Korea expert, said that North Korea had not been implicated
in any terrorist incidents for more than a decade, although its name
remains on the State Department list of terror-sponsoring countries.</TE>
<TE>   In its last months in office, the Clinton administration was
considering removing North Korea from the list as part of a deal in the
works under which the Communist nation would be paid to give up its
missile sales.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a Republican, but I've got to say that the Clinton
administration's policy on North Korea--constructive engagement and
deterrence--was working, maybe their only foreign policy that was
successful," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean government believes that although the Pyongyang
regime has moved slowly to open up, the "sunshine policy" has succeeded
in at least in reducing tensions on the peninsula and letting normal life
flourish.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we worry that South Korea will become a hostage in the rhetoric
between the United States and North Korea," said Park Young Ho, a
director of a government-run think tank in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of a war on the Korean peninsula is a terrifying
scenario. The DMZ that has separated the two nations since the end of the
Korean War in 1953 is the most militarized border in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said it would be a mistake to look to the Afghanistan campaign
or even the 1991 Persian Gulf War against Iraq for a model of how to deal
with North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were to be a war on the Korean peninsula, we would win but
at a horrendous cost," he said. "It would be a classic pyrrhic victory.
We could devastate North Korea, but we would lose hundreds of thousands
of South Korean and Japanese allies in the first few days."</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Thomas Schwartz, commander of U.S. troops stationed in South
Korea, testified last March before Congress that the North has 1.2
million soldiers on active duty and that it commands the largest
submarine fleet in the world. Even after President Kim made a historic
visit to Pyongyang in June 2000, North Korea continued to mass forces
near the demilitarized zone between the two countries, becoming an ever
more serious threat to South Korea and to the 37,000 U.S. troops
stationed here, Schwartz said.</TE>
<TE>   "The perception of a peaceful peninsula differs from reality,"
Schwartz testified. North Korean leader Kim Jong Il "stubbornly adheres
to his 'military first' policy, pouring huge amounts of his budget
resources into the military. . . . As a result, his military forces are
bigger, better, closer and deadlier."</TE>
<TE>   Two declassified CIA reports released last month gave similarly dire
assessments of North Korea. The agency said in a report made public after
Bush's speech that North Korea is "capable of producing and delivering
via missile warheads or other munitions a wide variety of chemical agents
and possibly some biological agents." The report also said that, before
the 1994 freeze on its nuclear program, the Communist nation had
accumulated enough plutonium for at least one nuclear weapon.</TE>
<TE>   The other report said North Korea was continuing work on developing
its Taepodong missile, which would be capable of reaching Alaska and
Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has reacted to Bush's statements with characteristic
bluster, calling them tantamount to a declaration of war. In statements
reported Wednesday in South Korea, Radio Pyongyang said that the U.S.
president's upcoming visit to Asia was designed to "heighten tension in
the Korean peninsula and stage a war against North Korea."</TE>

<HD>Tenet Defends CIA's Fight on Terrorism</HD>
<DH>Senate: Director says Sept. 11 was not an agency failure. He cites
spy community's 'heroic effort' in Afghan war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In his first public testimony since Sept. 11, CIA Director George
J. Tenet vigorously defended his agency on Wednesday, refusing to
characterize the terrorist attacks as an intelligence failure and
proclaiming that America has thwarted other planned strikes and succeeded
in Afghanistan largely because of the "heroic effort" of the nation's spy
community.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet appeared before a Senate panel that is preparing an extensive
probe of U.S. intelligence agencies. He struck a defiant posture,
sparring with lawmakers who questioned the CIA's effectiveness and
emphasizing the agency's sacrifices and successes in combating terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Sept. 11 "was not the result of failure of attention and focus and
discipline and effort," Tenet said. "We have been at war with Al Qaeda
for over five years."</LD>
<TE>   Tenet was responding primarily to pointed questions from Sen. Richard
C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the committee and a Tenet
critic. Shelby noted that Tenet had appeared before the committee almost
exactly a year ago, offering assurances that the United States was having
considerable success combating terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Seven months after your testimony," Shelby said, "Osama bin Laden's
terrorists killed nearly 3,000 innocent Americans in less than one hour."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet bristled visibly at that line of questioning. But he was also
clearly eager to address a continuous chorus of criticism that his agency
has faced since hijacked planes plowed into the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Americans "need to know that there are competent men and women who
risk their lives and undertake heroic risks to protect them," Tenet said.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's words offered an early glimpse of how aggressively he will
defend U.S. intelligence agencies' counterterrorism record during
congressional hearings in the coming months.</TE>
<TE>   His remarks came during his annual discussion of global threats with
members of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Tenet--who appeared
alongside officials from the State, Defense and Justice
departments--spent much of his introductory statement going over
developments in Iran, Iraq, North Korea and other international trouble
spots.</TE>
<TE>   But the focus of the hearing quickly shifted to the war on terrorism.
And although members of the committee get frequent private briefings from
the CIA and other agencies, Wednesday presented their first opportunity
to question Tenet in public.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's remarks shed some light on the extent to which intelligence
agencies had targeted Bin Laden before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   He said the CIA had penetrated Al Qaeda before Sept. 11, presumably
meaning that it had recruited informants within the terrorist
organization. But he suggested that details of the deadly operation were
so closely guarded by Bin Laden and the hijackers that uncovering the
plot beforehand might have been impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "Where did the secret for the planning reside?" Tenet said. "Probably
in the head of three or four people."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet refused to discuss the latest intelligence on Bin Laden and
other sensitive topics, saying he would provide such details only in a
private session with senators scheduled later in the day.</TE>
<TE>   A former Senate staffer who now oversees the CIA and a dozen other spy
agencies, Tenet has at times appeared vulnerable in his job. He is the
only holdover from the Clinton administration in the Bush White House,
and his tenure has been marked by a series of Al Qaeda strikes against
the United States, including the bombings of American embassies in East
Africa and a U.S. warship in Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   But Tenet has also won wide praise for bringing stability to a
beleaguered agency, and he has the clear backing of President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Several lawmakers Wednesday voiced their support for Tenet. Most
notably, Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the committee, praised
Tenet for his leadership and noted that CIA operatives were the first to
hit the ground in Afghanistan and suffered the first casualty of the war.</TE>
<TE>   But other members made it clear that Tenet and the intelligence
agencies he oversees would face significant scrutiny in the coming
months.</TE>
<TE>   In one exchange Wednesday, Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) asked Tenet to
respond to reports that the CIA had neglected Afghanistan before Sept.
11, was desperately short of officers who could speak Middle Eastern
languages and was generally too timid in its pursuit of terrorist
networks.</TE>
<TE>   "What fellows at the Dodge City kaffeeklatsch ask me is, 'If John
Walker Lindh could get to talk to Osama bin Laden, why in the heck
couldn't the CIA get an agent closer to him?' " Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet dismissed the remark about Lindh--the so-called American Talib
captured in Afghanistan--and responded to the allegation of a lackluster
effort in Afghanistan by telling Roberts, "You better tell everybody at
the cafe it's not true."</TE>
<TE>   The most pointed criticism came from Shelby, who was chairman of the
committee before Democrats regained control of the Senate last year, and
who has previously said that Tenet should be replaced. Shelby noted that
the CIA was created largely to prevent America from being caught
off-guard the way it had been by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   "That second devastating surprise attack came on Sept. 11," he said.
"Once we determine why we were caught completely by surprise, I believe
we must then work together to ensure that there is no third Pearl
Harbor."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet, a plain-spoken son of Greek immigrants, offered a forceful
response that he had clearly been rehearsing in his head for some time.
"We welcome the committee's review of our record on terrorism," he said.
"It's a record of discipline, strategy, focus and attention."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that in the months leading up to the turn of the millennium,
"We told the president that there would be between five and 15 attacks
against American interests both here and overseas. None of these attacks
occurred."</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, he added, there were "spectacular" reports of threats
against the United States. "We again launched a massive disruption
effort," he said. "We know that we stopped three or four American
facilities from being bombed overseas. We know that we saved many
American lives."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Forces Release 27 Held After Disputed Afghan Raid</HD>
<DH>Asia: The men weren't affiliated with terrorists, the military
says. But a spokesman notes that the 'known criminals' had shot at
American troops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. forces in Afghanistan on Wednesday released 27 prisoners who
had been detained in a commando raid last month that interim Prime
Minister Hamid Karzai has said killed more than a dozen of his
supporters.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla., said
interrogators have determined that the detainees weren't affiliated with
the Taliban or Al Qaeda network, contrary to initial suspicions. But the
spokesman, Maj. Ralph Mills, defended their capture, saying all 27 had
fired at U.S. forces.</LD>
<LD>   "We determined based on available evidence that they were not Taliban
forces, nor were they affiliated with Al Qaeda," Mills said of the men
released Wednesday. "But we're not saying it was a mistake to detain
them. We detained them because they were shooting at us."</LD>
<TE>   He said many of those taken in the raid were "known criminals." He did
not elaborate. The prisoners were released to the custody of local Afghan
authorities in Tarin Kowt, north of the former Taliban stronghold of
Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   After two weeks of conflicting accounts of the raid on a reputed
terrorist hide-out, the Pentagon made no official announcement of error
Wednesday. Central Command has been investigating whether about 18 others
killed in the attack were Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   In another strike on suspected terrorists, a group of alleged senior
Al Qaeda members in southeastern Afghanistan was struck by a missile
fired by remote control from a pilotless CIA drone aircraft, a U.S.
official said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe there was a death or two and probably severe injuries
among the rest," the official said of the strike, which took place
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In the earlier raid in the central province of Uruzgan, Karzai and
local officials have asserted, anti-Taliban Afghans were among those
killed or captured.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai told the Washington Post this week that the predawn Jan. 24
raid by Army Rangers was "a mistake of sorts," resulting from "an
unfortunate movement of people at the wrong time" that left a number of
supporters of his U.S.-backed government dead.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai said he had also concluded that vehicles attacked by U.S.
warplanes near the city of Khowst in December were carrying tribal
leaders to his inauguration in the capital, Kabul, and not Taliban
leaders, as U.S. commanders were told.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai said that U.S. troops have handed out payments to the families
of those killed in the strike on the convoy and offered their apologies.
Local Afghan officials have put the amount of the payments at $1,000 for
each family.</TE>
<TE>   During a break Wednesday in testimony on Capitol Hill, Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said the task of identifying terrorist
suspects has become especially difficult as the new Afghan government
works to include those once loyal to the routed Taliban but now willing
to switch loyalties. "So how anyone would identify people at any given
moment is not simple," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials said Wednesday that they continue to believe that
the convoy was a legitimate target. They declined to comment Wednesday on
the issue of payments.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon also initially defended the January raid. But last week,
when officials of Karzai's government complained that their supporters
had been killed, Army Gen. Tommy Franks, the senior commander of the war,
launched an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at
the time that basic facts about the raid--including who shot first--had
yet to be verified.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence analysts believed that Al Qaeda or Taliban forces
were using the site for a munitions depot, Myers said. One U.S. soldier
was wounded in the ankle during the raid.</TE>
<TE>   Some Afghans say that Taliban renegades were handing over weapons to
Karzai's government at the site and that some pro-Karzai figures were
killed and that others--including a police chief, his deputy and members
of a district council--were among those arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Guards at the Kandahar home of Karzai's brother, Ahmed, said two of
the prisoners had been released not Wednesday but Tuesday and had come by
to thank him and the interim prime minister for their efforts in securing
their release. The guards said the two former prisoners had spent the
night at the residence.</TE>
<TE>   The raid was one in a series carried out by U.S. Special
Forces--sometimes in tandem with Afghan troops--in a bid to extinguish
pockets of Taliban and Al Qaeda resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Hamid Karzai said the United States has in several instances been
intentionally misled by local warlords engaged in internecine rivalries,
who tricked American forces into targeting anti-Taliban officials.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, U.S. military planes resumed the transfer of Al Qaeda and
Taliban prisoners from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on Wednesday.
About 30 prisoners left Kandahar aboard an Air Force C-17 transport plane
in the first of about five flights planned to the U.S. naval base in Cuba
during the next two weeks, a senior defense official said.</TE>
<TE>   The prisoner transfers were suspended Jan. 23 so that additional
temporary open-air cells could be built. One hundred and sixty new cells
are now ready to receive prisoners, officials said Wednesday. Like the
others already built, they are made of chain-link fencing, with concrete
floors and wood-and-metal roofs.</TE>

<HD>'Definitive Signs' Indicate Reporter Is Alive, Police Say</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: A militant previously imprisoned by India is a key
suspect in the U.S. journalist's kidnapping, according to authorities.</DH>

<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Pakistani authorities have found "definitive signs" that Wall
Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl is alive and have identified as
a key suspect in his kidnapping an Islamic extremist with links to the Al
Qaeda terrorist network.</LD>
<LD>   The break in the 2-week-old case came after a man detained Tuesday
identified Ahmad Omar Sayed Sheikh as the man who ordered him to send
e-mail messages along with photographs of the captive correspondent,
according to police sources.</LD>
<LD>   Police are said to be holding Sheikh's family members in the eastern
city of Lahore as part of their effort to capture him, according to a top
investigative source.</LD>
<TE>   He said that Sheikh's family members had been detained for questioning
about his whereabouts. It is standard police procedure in South Asia to
detain family members as a tactic to pressure a suspect into
surrendering.</TE>
<TE>   "The arrest of Omar Sheikh may lead police to the recovery of Daniel
Pearl," said a senior member of the police investigative team in Karachi,
who declined to be identified by name. "He is a key suspect."</TE>
<TE>   The top investigative source wouldn't elaborate on the information
that Pearl is alive for fear of jeopardizing him.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl, 38, the paper's correspondent for South Asia, disappeared Jan.
23 in Karachi. A group that called itself the National Movement for the
Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty claimed responsibility and called
for the release of Pakistani terrorist suspects being held by the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh, a 27-year-old British citizen of Pakistani heritage, had been
active in kidnapping rings that raised funds for Muslim rebels fighting
to bring all of Kashmir, the disputed Himalayan territory divided between
India and Pakistan, under Pakistani control.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh is one of three Pakistani militants whom India released from
prison to free passengers of an Indian Airlines jet hijacked from
Katmandu, Nepal, to Kandahar, Afghanistan, in December 1999.</TE>
<TE>   After winning his freedom, Sheikh returned to Pakistan, where for the
last several years he has been active in Islamic fundamentalist groups
that are on the State Department's "watch list" of terrorist
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh, a well-educated mathematics prodigy who embraced extremist
causes after a summer job helping Muslim victims of the Balkan conflicts,
is believed to have transferred money to alleged Sept. 11 lead hijacker
Mohamed Atta, according to British intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Jaish-e-Mohammed, an extremist group that authorities are examining
for alleged ties to Sheikh, disavowed any association with the suspect or
the kidnapping in a statement released Wednesday in the northern city of
Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-held Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   The other suspect group under police scrutiny, Harkat Moujahedeen, has
been silent. The organization is on a State Department list of terrorist
groups whose bank accounts have been ordered frozen.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl had reported that an account linked to Jaish-e-Mohammed was
functioning. He was also investigating suspected links between another
banned extremist group, Jamaat ul-Fuqra, and alleged "shoe bomber"
Richard C. Reid.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly which group is involved remains unresolved, although
investigators appear to be focusing on the relation of three suspects
detained Tuesday to Jaish-e-Mohammed or Harkat Moujahedeen.</TE>
<TE>   The men, identified only as Fawad, Salman and Adeel, allegedly sent
the first two e-mail messages about Pearl's kidnapping, along with
photographs, on orders from Sheikh, according to investigative sources.</TE>
<TE>   "We are working on certain individuals, and we are trying to work out
affiliations," said Tariq Jamil, deputy inspector general of police in
Karachi. "We have our suspicions that they may belong to one of these
groups, but the strength of their affiliations we don't know. . . . These
young men swing from one group to another. Unless we get to the core
person, we won't know."</TE>
<TE>   A fourth suspect was detained Wednesday in Rawalpindi. Police said the
man is an Arab identified as Hannan Ahmad, who is believed to have made
more than 90 telephone calls to numbers in Karachi that already were
under suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   Jaish and Harkat have operated in Karachi, where Sheikh owns a home,
according to a top investigative source.</TE>
<TE>   India accuses Jaish-e-Mohammed of involvement in a deadly Dec. 13
attack on its Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   The focus on Sheikh would add credence to the theory that Pearl
probably knew those who kidnapped him. In December, one of his reports
focused heavily on Jaish-e-Mohammed. In that report, Pearl spoke of
"Jaish activities" and attributed comments to "Jaish members," using
language that indicated he had spoken with them.</TE>
<TE>   Jameel Yusuf, director of the Citizens Police Liaison Committee, a
private group established to reduce crime in Karachi, said Pearl had
shown him e-mail exchanges with a man called Bashir.</TE>
<TE>   Yusuf said Pearl also received a call from someone named Siddique on
the day he disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the case suspect that one or both of those names
might have been an alias for Sheikh.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh was born to relative privilege in the London suburb of Wanstead
and attended the London School of Economics.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, he traveled to Bosnia-Herzegovina to deliver aid to Muslim
victims of "ethnic cleansing" campaigns. Within a year, he had joined
Harkat Ansar, a radical Muslim group fighting to end Indian rule in
Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, he was sentenced to prison by Indian authorities for his role
in kidnapping three Britons and an American.</TE>
<TE>   His release in the Indian Airlines hijacking made him a celebrity in
Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, where he allegedly rubbed shoulders with
the Taliban leadership and Al Qaeda members.</TE>

<HD>U.N. May Broaden Peace Mission</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Council hears of appeals for security outside Kabul.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>The Security Council edged closer to broadening the peacekeeping
mission in Afghanistan beyond Kabul, as top U.N. officials appealed
publicly Wednesday for greater protection for returning refugees and aid
workers elsewhere in the war-ravaged country.</LD>
<LD>   "Security was the No. 1 preoccupation of everyone we met in
Afghanistan," U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who returned this week
from a tour of Afghanistan and neighboring countries, told the Security
Council. Though foreign governments have pledged $4.5 billion for the
rebuilding of Afghanistan, delivering this aid may be impossible without
armed protection, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Lakhdar Brahimi, the chief U.N. envoy to Afghanistan, who also just
returned from meetings with officials there, said he heard demands "even
from the warlords" for the deployment of foreign peacekeepers throughout
the country.</LD>
<TE>   After closed-door consultations following the open council meeting
Wednesday, Brahimi said he is "fairly confident" that members will agree
to broaden the peacekeeping mission. "I think they are very sympathetic,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. officials cautioned that although the council "wants to be
responsive" to requests for an expanded peacekeeping force, the scale and
timing of that expansion remain subjects of intensive internal debate.</TE>
<TE>   In December, the Security Council authorized the deployment of an
international peacekeeping force in and around Kabul, the capital. The
force is commanded by Britain and is scheduled to reach its maximum
strength of 5,000 troops within a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan's interim prime minister, asked the Security
Council last week to authorize a larger and longer-term peacekeeping
mission. His foreign minister later proposed expanding the force to about
20,000 troops, with units stationed in Herat, Kandahar, Jalalabad and
Mazar-i-Sharif, as well as Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Brahimi told the council Wednesday that he and Annan "tend to agree
with [the Afghan officials'] demands."</TE>
<TE>   About 100,000 refugees returned to Afghanistan last month, Brahimi
reported, but most came to overcrowded, half-demolished Kabul--"where
they feel safe"--instead of to their native villages. The population
influx from Pakistan and Iran is expected to intensify during the spring
planting season, but if there are no security forces in their home
provinces, the returning Afghans will further swell Kabul's shantytowns,
he predicted.</TE>
<TE>   An extension of the mission beyond Kabul and environs--and beyond its
original six-month time limit, which expires in May--would require not
only the assent of the United States and other veto-wielding Security
Council powers, but the support of other governments contributing troops
to the effort. Britain plans to relinquish command of the force to Turkey
in March.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon, concerned that peacekeeping troops might inadvertently
interfere with its combat operations in Afghanistan, had strongly opposed
an expansion of the British-led multinational force outside the capital
area. But State Department officials appear increasingly convinced that
the interim government's survival could depend on a strong international
security presence around major cities and transportation routes.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Haass, the State Department's coordinator for policies
affecting Afghanistan, told the World Economic Forum in New York last
weekend that he could envision the peacekeeping force growing to 25,000
troops. But another U.S. official cautioned Wednesday that although an
expansion on that scale is "an option," it could be weeks or even months
before the Security Council approves the deployment of peacekeepers in
other Afghan cities.</TE>
<TE>   Although the U.S. has said it will not contribute troops to the
peacekeeping force, President Bush has agreed to have police officers
participate in training programs for new Afghan security forces. The
British are starting a police training program in Kabul this week,
Brahimi noted, and later this month a 600-man Afghan "national guard"
unit will begin exercises with peacekeepers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge has ordered school officials to let a kindergartner
say grace out loud before eating lunch.</LD>
<LD>   Kayla Broadus, 5, was stopped from praying with friends on Jan. 15 at
her elementary school in Wilton, 36 miles north of Albany.</LD>
<LD>   The girl's lawyer argued that it is her 1st Amendment right to say
grace, but the school system said the prayer, because it was audible,
violated the constitutional separation of church and state.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge David Hurd issued a temporary restraining order
that said the school may not interfere with the girl's praying. He set a
hearing for Feb. 15.</TE>

embezzling about $91,000 from the 207-year-old student group for drugs, a
party and entertainment equipment.</LD>

<HD>Safety Board to Caution Pilots About Abrupt Rudder Motion</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: The NTSB finding will cover all who fly jets, not just the
Airbus A300s like the one that crashed in N.Y.</DH>

</DL>
<LD>Federal investigators probing the crash of the American Airlines
jetliner whose tail broke off in November are expected to caution pilots
against making sharp rudder movements in flight, government and industry
officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The safety recommendation from the National Transportation Safety
Board is expected to apply to all pilots, not just those flying Airbus
A300 jets like the one that crashed in New York, killing all 260 people
aboard and five on the ground.</LD>
<LD>   Officials have not determined why Flight 587's tail snapped off.
Several sources said that information developed during the investigation
had raised concerns that sharp rudder movements could, in certain
circumstances, place excessive stress on a jet's tail.</LD>
<TE>   The crash is the first in decades of jet flight in which an airliner's
tail has broken off for no readily discernible reason. Investigators have
not ruled out a structural flaw or a defect in the composite material
used to build the A300's tail.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine that sharp rudder movements would snap off a tail
unless there was something already wrong with that tail," said Lew
Aaronson, a retired Continental Airlines pilot.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran pilots are skeptical that rudder motion alone could break the
27-foot vertical tail fin. The rudder is a movable panel on the rear edge
of the fin that helps to steer a plane and keep it flying straight.</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators say that Flight 587 flew through the wake of a
larger plane shortly before its pilots lost control. It then underwent a
rapid series of side-to-side movements, two to the right and one to the
left. Readings from the plane's flight data recorder showed that the
rudder moved in tandem.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have not been able to determine whether one of the
pilots commanded those rudder movements or if they resulted from a
mechanical malfunction or from the tail wobbling before it broke off. No
evidence of engine failure has been found.</TE>
<TE>   The rudder would not normally have been used to counteract wake
turbulence, veteran pilots say.</TE>
<TE>   To steady a plane in turbulent air, pilots usually employ the
ailerons, movable panels on the wings that are used to turn an aircraft
in flight. In a modern jetliner, the rudder is chiefly controlled by a
computer, which makes constant small adjustments that help keep the plane
flying straight.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, pilots never use a rudder aggressively, even when needed,"
said Barry Schiff, a retired TWA captain and aviation safety consultant.
"Rudder inputs are small, and you only use them for engine failure and
crosswind landings and takeoffs. Otherwise, pilots never do what the NTSB
is cautioning them not to do, so it's kind of a hollow suggestion."</TE>
<TE>   Late last month, Aviation Week published its own engineering analysis,
which showed that sharp rudder motions could create forces that exceed
the design limits of the tail fin under certain unusual conditions. The
magazine said the critical condition occurs when the rudder is applied to
counteract a sideslip, or sideways skid. "The rudder went haywire and the
fin came off," the magazine said.</TE>
<TE>   Without commenting on the magazine's findings, federal officials say
that their own investigation has raised similar concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "There are certain conditions that pilots may not be aware of that
warrant an immediate safety recommendation," said a source familiar with
the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   An industry official said current safety standards do not address the
forces that could be created by sharp back-and-forth rudder movements,
since it would be highly unusual for pilots to take such actions in
flight.</TE>
<TE>   The official said the NTSB recommendation is likely to prompt added
cautions in pilot training, as well as an examination of design standards
by aircraft companies such as Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie, the
European manufacturer of the plane that crashed.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush is expected to move swiftly, possibly as soon as
early next week, to approve construction of a nuclear waste site in
Nevada, according to congressional and administration sources.</LD>
<LD>   Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham endorsed the Yucca Mountain site last
month but by law has to wait 30 days to give a formal recommendation to
the president. That time is up Saturday, and Bush is expected to make a
decision quickly, the sources said.</LD>
<LD>   With Nevada officials vowing to try to prevent the shipment of up to
77,000 tons of nuclear waste into their state, a final decision will have
to be up to Congress. Nevada can block a presidential decision, but
Congress can overrule the state.</LD>

<HD>Sentence Reforms Found Effective</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After three decades of "get tough" prison policies in the U.S., a
growing number of states have adopted sentencing reforms as alternatives
to incarceration, according to two separate studies to be released today.</LD>
<LD>   The reports by the Sentencing Project and the Justice Policy
Institute--left-leaning research organizations based in Washington,
D.C.--conclude that the trend toward reforms has been driven by a drop in
crime, fiscal constraints and waning public support for imprisoning
nonviolent felons.</LD>
<LD>   "We are starting to see a reasonably substantial shift away from
harsher sentencing," said Marc Mauer, assistant director of the
Sentencing Project. "There is no question the trend is already in place.
The only question is how substantial it will become . . . across the
country."</LD>
<TE>   In its analysis of legislative proposals and fiscal actions around the
U.S., the Sentencing Project found that in the last 18 months four states
have scaled back mandatory sentencing laws, five states have expanded the
role of drug treatment as an alternative to prison and seven states have
passed other types of legislation to ease prison crowding.</TE>
<TE>   Significantly, Mauer said, many of the states taking such
initiatives--such as Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and
Virginia--previously have been among the most conservative in their
approach to public safety and prison sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   One example of changing attitudes, Mauer said, is the proliferation of
drug courts. Just a decade ago, he said, the first drug courts were
opened in the U.S. to emphasize treatment over imprisonment for
nonviolent drug offenders. Today, according to Mauer, more than 400 drug
courts are operating throughout the country, including in California.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a reform that has become very mainstream in a very brief period
of time," Mauer said.</TE>
<TE>   While the Sentencing Project study examined a variety of reasons for
prison sentencing reforms, the Justice Policy Institute focused on
financial incentives.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a new thing happening across the country," Associate
Director Jason Zeidenberg said. "It is bipartisan. It is cross-regional .
. . [and] it is happening in legislatures and the executive branches.</TE>
<TE>   "It is [the conclusion] that locking everyone up has a financial
downside that people aren't happy with and want changed."</TE>
<TE>   During the 1990s, the institute said, prisons nationwide constituted
one of the fastest-growing line items in state budgets, accounting for
about $1 of every $14 in general fund expenditures in fiscal 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the report adds, federal, state and county expenditures total
nearly $40 billion annually to lock up about 2 million prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   "In state after state, we found that politicians of both parties were
proposing prudent cuts to prison populations and budgets," said
researcher Judith Greene, who co-wrote the report.</TE>
<TE>   "The combination of the current fiscal crisis and increasing public
support for reducing the use of incarceration has created a national
trend in states moving toward a more balanced response to crime," Greene
said.</TE>
<TE>   While both studies conclude that California's Proposition 36 drug
diversion program has helped keep nonviolent offenders out of prison, the
institute's report says the state has not done as much as many others to
reduce prison costs.</TE>
<TE>   Only last year, the institute noted, California's Legislative Analyst
office said the state could save almost $100 million a year through one
action: eliminating post-release supervision for nonserious offenders who
have no prior convictions for violent crimes or selling narcotics.</TE>
<TE>   "It is significant that the biggest state in the nation is not getting
in control of its corrections budget," Zeidenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   While the Sept. 11 terrorism attacks have prompted a number of tough
anti-crime initiatives, officials familiar with the sentencing studies
said they do not expect a reversal of the sentencing reforms taken by
states.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people make pretty clear distinctions between the kinds of
cases we are talking about and national security issues," Mauer said.</TE>

<HD>Security, Politics on Bush N.Y. Agenda</HD>
<DH>Tour: President talks homeland defense before firefighters and
police officers, then tries to bolster Gov. Pataki's reelection effort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>President Bush returned to Manhattan on Wednesday, but this time
fighting terrorism wasn't the only type of warfare he had in mind.</LD>
<LD>   After touring the New York Police Department's command center, the
president delivered a passionate speech on homeland security to hundreds
of police officers and fire and rescue workers crammed into a midtown
hotel ballroom. It was part of his ongoing effort to tout his budget
proposals.</LD>
<LD>   Then Bush's schedule turned overtly political as he attended two
fund-raisers for Gov. George Pataki--the first a $15,000-per-person
reception at the Upper East Side townhouse of New York Mayor Michael R.
Bloomberg.</LD>
<TE>   Bush's appearances for Pataki represented only the second time since
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that he has attended political
fund-raisers, reflecting his reluctance to engage in direct partisan
activities while he leads a nation at war.</TE>
<TE>   But the aid the president provided Pataki's reelection bid also
heralded a distinct shift, one that could generate criticism directed not
at his performance as commander in chief but at his role as the GOP's
fund-raiser in chief.</TE>
<TE>   With the approach of elections in which control of Congress hangs in
the balance, both Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney are stepping up
their efforts to elect Republicans. It is a tricky balancing act at a
time when the administration is still prosecuting the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney campaigned Wednesday in Evansville, Ind., for Rep. John N.
Hostettler (R-Ind.), and today is scheduled to do the same for Rep. Anne
M. Northup (R-Ky.).</TE>
<TE>   In the next eight months, Bush is slated for about 40 political events
around the country and Cheney about 60, aides say. Until Wednesday, the
president had attended only one post-September fund-raiser--for his
brother Jeb, who is seeking a second term as Florida governor.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the president's Cabinet also are expected to hit the
campaign trail later this year, according to White House and Republican
Party officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's fair to say that, as this election year begins, the
president will increasingly be helpful to Republican candidates at the
state level [and] the federal level," White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer said this week.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Bush is scheduled to attend a fund-raiser in Milwaukee for
Gov. Scott McCallum.</TE>
<TE>   In some of his recent travels around the country to promote the
counter-terrorism campaign and his domestic priorities, Bush also has
quietly taken time out to do some spadework for his expected reelection
bid in 2004. After a public appearance in East Moline, Ill., last month,
for instance, Bush met privately with supporters from throughout the
region.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's itinerary also has taken him to many states that proved
critical battlegrounds in the much-disputed 2000 presidential election,
such as Oregon, West Virginia, Florida and Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   At the second fund-raiser for Pataki on Wednesday night--a
$1,500-per-person affair--Bush delivered a speech devoid of hard-edged
political rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   He extolled the New York governor, who is seeking a third term. He
told the crowd at a hotel ballroom that Pataki is "a governor whose phone
calls will be returned from the White House."</TE>
<TE>   But for the most part, Bush's remarks were all but indistinguishable
from the dozens of war-related speeches he has delivered since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The president's political strategy, at least for now, appears to be
one of arousing and sustaining patriotism--and then hoping such feelings
wash over to Republican candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's trip marked Bush's fifth to New York since Sept. 11, and
he devoted his public appearances to highlighting the $3.5 billion he
proposed in his 2003 budget for firefighters, police and rescue squads.
Bush said his request would increase federal funding for these local
units by more than 1,000%. He also renewed the pledge he made days after
Sept. 11 that Washington will provide $20 billion to help New York
recover from the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Congress appropriated $10.7 billion late last year. And administration
officials stressed at the time--as Bush did Wednesday--that ultimately
the whole amount will be furnished. The president also made clear that
money Congress has agreed to provide to relatives of Sept. 11 victims
would not be counted against the $20-billion package, as White House
Budget Director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. had suggested earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   "Mitch understands my pledge," Bush told reporters. "When I said $20
billion, I meant $20 billion."</TE>
<TE>   In his tour of the NYPD command center in lower Manhattan, just blocks
from where the World Trade Center once stood, and in his subsequent
speech, the president lavished praise upon those who he now routinely
refers to as the nation's "first responders" to emergencies.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Enron CEO Is Set to Play Blame Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When former Enron Corp. Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling appears
at a hearing on Capitol Hill today, he will be pressed by lawmakers on
his failure to control controversial Enron partnerships.</LD>
<LD>   But if his dealings with Enron's internal investigative committee are
a guide, he is almost certain to point to aggressive underlings as the
main culprits in a series of complicated financial transactions that
eventually brought about the energy trader's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike other Enron executives scheduled to testify, Skilling is not
expected to invoke his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.</LD>
<TE>   Skilling has declined interviews and is giving no clues as to what his
testimony will be before the oversight and investigations subcommittee of
the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a broad outline of what Skilling might say can be gleaned from
what he told a special investigative committee of Enron's board, which
issued a searing report that concluded Skilling and other executives
failed to adequately oversee the off-balance-sheet partnerships that
helped prompt Enron's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "He was certainly in the center of the storm," said Rep. James C.
Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the House subcommittee that will question
Skilling under a "friendly" subpoena.</TE>
<TE>   "He either believes that he's innocent and wants to come in and defend
himself--I give him that presumption--or he thinks he's so smart, he can
fake us all out," Greenwood said. "He's going to be, I think, the most
fascinating witness" today.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling was president and chief operating officer--and for a brief
six months, chief executive--during the blossoming of Enron into the
seventh-largest U.S. company by revenue and the world's largest energy
trader.</TE>
<TE>   But a good deal of that growth was phantom, aided by financial sleight
of hand through the use of a grid of off-balance-sheet partnerships and
transactions designed to make Enron's fiscal statements look good by
hiding mounting debt and losses, according to the report prepared after
three months of investigation by University of Texas Law School Dean
William C. Powers and two other Enron directors.</TE>
<TE>   The report sets the stage for a likely blame-off between Skilling and
Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who ran two of
the partnerships and enlisted his lieutenants to invest. Although Fastow
had indicated to other employees that Skilling was in the know on
significant transactions, Skilling repeatedly told the committee
otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Enron employees involved in the partnerships--most notably Fastow
himself--enriched themselves through questionable transactions between
the partnerships and Enron, the Powers report shows. Meanwhile,
errors--some deliberate--in accounting for those transactions inflated
company earnings by more than $1 billion during a 15-month period ended
Sept. 30, the report concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Powers, in testimony before the House panel Monday and Tuesday, spread
blame broadly, but singled out "a fundamental default of leadership and
management" particularly from Skilling and Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's
longtime chairman and chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling knew about and was involved in setting up some if not all of
the partnerships, which were run by Fastow and others, and carried such
names as LJM, Raptor and Chewco. But how much control Skilling exercised
over the partnership transactions is the subject of dispute in the
report.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling claims to have exercised little oversight over critical
business transactions, despite the fact that the board was told he was
doing so. His recollections of crucial conversations that would place him
in the know on some of the most controversial deals are faint or
nonexistent, the report shows. But his claims are consistently
contradicted by the accounts of others.</TE>
<TE>   For example:</TE>
<TE>   * Oversight of the LJM partnerships: The board required that all LJM
transactions be reviewed and approved by Skilling as "the senior member
of management responsible for the LJM relationship."</TE>
<TE>   At an October 2000 board meeting, Fastow informed the board that
Skilling would approve transactions between Enron and the LJMs, and "a
review of Fastow's economic interest in Enron and LJM was presented to
Skilling."</TE>
<TE>   Skilling told the panel "he may not have been present for Fastow's
remarks" at the meeting, although board minutes show he attended.</TE>
<TE>   His signature was missing from nearly all of the LJM approval sheets,
which Skilling was supposed to review, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling told the committee he never reviewed the actual amount of
Fastow's stake in the partnerships, instead reviewing only "a handwritten
document [from Fastow] showing only that Fastow's economic stake in Enron
was substantially larger than his economic stake in LJM1 and LJM2."</TE>
<TE>   * The Raptors: The Raptors were special-purpose vehicles created
beginning in April 2000 to allow Enron to hedge part of its merchant
investment portfolio. But the board committee concluded that the Raptors
were not true hedges, instead improperly using gains in Enron's stock
price to keep losses off the books.</TE>
<TE>   Of key concern was a restructuring of the Raptors in 2001 designed to
mask more than $500 million in losses. According to the report, "senior
Enron employees" told the committee that Skilling--recently elevated to
CEO--"was aware of this problem and was intensely interested in its
resolution," even calling to personally thank one accountant who worked
on the project once it was complete.</TE>
<TE>   If those accounts hold up, "Skilling both approved a transaction that
was designed to conceal substantial losses in Enron's merchant
investments and withheld from the board important information about that
transaction," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling, however, told the committee he recalls being informed "in
only general terms" of the problem and barely understood it.</TE>
<TE>   * The McMahon interaction: Former Treasurer Jeffrey McMahon, who is
now president and chief operating officer, told the committee that he met
with Skilling in March 2000 to express concern over the LJM partnerships
and Fastow's conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   McMahon provided the committee with written talking points he prepared
for his meeting. According to those, he addressed Fastow's conflict of
interest, pressure placed by Fastow on him to do deals that weren't in

<HD>Mansion Loophole in Bankruptcy Laws Targeted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Enron Corp. debacle is increasing pressure on lawmakers to
close a loophole in the nation's bankruptcy code that allows millionaires
in Texas, Florida and several other states to declare bankruptcy--and
keep their mansions.</LD>
<LD>   From the start, the federal bankruptcy laws have included some
exemptions set by the states. Bankrupt homeowners in many states are
allowed to keep a basic dwelling. However, five states--Texas, Florida,
Iowa, Kansas and South Dakota--set no limit on how much can be shielded
through this "homestead exemption."</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to this rule, lavish spenders, scam artists, stock promoters
and failed business tycoons can maintain opulent homes while escaping
their legal debts.</LD>
<TE>   Florida and Texas, in particular, have been known as havens for
celebrities and the formerly wealthy who have gone broke. They have
included actor Burt Reynolds, corporate raider Paul Bilzerian, former
baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn and, most recently, O.J. Simpson.</TE>
<TE>   Now Senate Democrats are raising the prospect that this Texas-style
exemption will shield Enron's executives from the harsh consequences of
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   If former Enron Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay declares bankruptcy to
shield himself from creditors, "the Texas homestead law will allow him to
keep an unlimited amount of equity in his 13,000-square-foot Houston
penthouse, valued at $7.1 million," Sen. Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.) said
Wednesday. "There is no justice in a system that puts thousands of people
on the street without a job and wondering about their rent but that helps
perpetrators live in multimillion-dollar homes."</TE>
<TE>   Congress has been moving to tighten the bankruptcy laws and has
targeted individuals who seek to escape from their credit card debts. But
lawmakers have disagreed on whether the crackdown should extend to
wealthy homeowners in the states with the unlimited homestead exemption.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Senate adopted an amendment sponsored by Sens. Kohl and
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that would set a uniform $125,000 homestead
exemption as part of the bankruptcy reform bill. They argued that those
who seek the protections of the federal bankruptcy system should play by
the same rules, whether they live in California, Wisconsin or Texas.</TE>
<TE>   But the House refused to scrap the open-ended homestead exemption in
its version of the bill, and the issue has emerged as the key point of
dispute in the legislation. Lawmakers from the two houses have met in a
conference committee but have not worked out their disagreements.</TE>
<TE>   Both Democrats and Republicans from Texas and Florida have resisted
the change. Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) said it would upset "the whole
principle of federalism" to impose a uniform national rule in the
bankruptcy code. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) vowed to "try and
kill the bill" if it removes Texas' unlimited homestead exemption.</TE>
<TE>   Staff aides also say House Majority Leader Dick Armey and House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, both Texas Republicans, have strongly opposed
the change.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, a former Texas governor, has also taken an interest in
the issue.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, he spoke out against an earlier move in Congress to end the
special exemption in Texas as a "clear violation of states' rights."</TE>
<TE>   And last year, after the Senate approved the Kohl-Feinstein amendment,
the White House sent a letter to lawmakers urging them to preserve the
state-by-state rule.</TE>
<TE>   But the bankruptcy of what was the nation's seventh-largest
corporation has revived support for changing the rules.</TE>
<TE>   "The Enron demise underscores the need for a nationwide cap on the
homestead exemptions," Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J.
Leahy (D-Vt.) said Wednesday. Texas executives should not be allowed to
use their special homestead exemption "to shield an unjust enrichment
from defrauded investors."</TE>
<TE>   In California, bankrupt individuals can shield only $50,000 of equity
in a residence, while families can shield $75,000, said UCLA law
professor Kenneth Klee, an expert on bankruptcy law.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the unlimited exemptions puts the entire system into
disrepute," Klee said.</TE>

<HD>Proportion of Immigrants in U.S. Population Has Doubled Since '70</HD>
<DH>Demographics: Census Bureau data paint a complex picture of lives
lived by the country's 28 million foreign-born.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The proportion of Americans born abroad more than doubled in the
last 30 years, transforming the population of the West as well as the
nation's immigrant experience, according to a Census Bureau report
released today.</LD>
<LD>   The foreign-born population--which is composed largely of immigrants
but also includes foreign students, temporary workers and diplomats--now
stands at more than 28 million, or roughly one out of 10 Americans, the
highest since the 1930s.</LD>
<LD>   Among the findings:</LD>
<TE>   * Seventy percent of the foreign-born live in six states, the highest
number (8.9 million) in California.</TE>
<TE>   * A third of all foreign-born live in either greater Los Angeles or
New York. The metropolitan areas of New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco,
Miami and Chicago house 50% of the foreign-born population, despite
comprising only 21% of the total U.S. population.</TE>
<TE>   * The foreign-born are 50% more likely to live in poverty than
native-born Americans.</TE>
<TE>   * They are less likely to own a home and more likely to have fewer
years of schooling than the native-born.</TE>
<TE>   * They and their children make up 21% of the American population under
25 years of age--three times their share in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   * One out of every five American babies is born to a foreign-born
woman, compared to 1 in 20 in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   As a proportion of the American public, the foreign-born still are
well below the peak levels from the late 19th and early 20th century,
when close to 15% of the population was born abroad.</TE>
<TE>   But the places from which foreigners come and where they settle in the
U.S. have shifted dramatically. In past eras, the foreign-born consisted
mostly of Europeans arriving in the Northeast and Midwest. Today's
foreign-born are mainly from Latin America and Asia--about 75% of the
total--and are more likely to live in the West and South.</TE>
<TE>   Generalizations quickly break apart when the foreign-born are examined
in specific groups. Households headed by immigrants from Asia, for
instance, tend to have higher annual incomes ($51,000) than those headed
by U.S. natives ($41,000).</TE>
<TE>   Those differences may be most visible in California, where the state's
foreign-born population surpasses the next three states combined. One of
four Californians is born abroad, by far the highest proportion in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign-born Californians run Silicon Valley tech firms and toil in
Los Angeles sweatshops. Workers cleaning rooms and mowing lawns in
Beverly Hills and San Marino are likely to be immigrants--as are many of
the homeowners employing them.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing we notice is this is a heterogeneous population,"
said Dianne Schmidley, author of the Census Bureau profile of the
foreign-born, which was based on a 2000 survey, not the Census 2000
household-by-household count.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to widespread perceptions, the study found that the vast
majority of children living in immigrant households--as many as 80%--were
born in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Almost one-third of immigrant households with three or more children
were living in poverty, the study found, compared to about one-fifth of
similar-sized households headed by U.S.-born parents or guardians.</TE>
<TE>   The poverty faced by the children of immigrants poses a dilemma for
policymakers, educators and others in immigrant enclaves like Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign-born residents have vastly disparate levels of schooling. For
example, 95% of African-born residents are high school graduates, a rate
superior to the 87% of native-born.</TE>
<TE>   The education statistics show great differences even among those born
in the same region. Among the Latin American-born, for example, 80% of
South Americans have high school educations, compared with 34% of
Mexicans.</TE>
<TE>   The work force picture is equally complex. Native workers are more
likely than the foreign-born to hold managerial or professional jobs (31%
of natives versus 25% of immigrants). But several foreign-born groups are
more likely than natives to be managers or professionals. They include
those born in Africa (37%), Asia (39%) and Europe (38%). Only 12% of
Latin American immigrants have white-collar jobs.</TE>
<TE>   European-born workers earned more than Asian-born and native-born
workers. Asian-born residents had the highest household incomes--but the
difference was due in part to having more workers per household. Latin
American-born residents trailed natives and other immigrants in earnings
and household income.</TE>
<TE>   In home ownership rates, the advantage of being born in the United
States was evident. Seven of 10 native households own their homes,
compared to 49% of the foreign-born. Among the foreign-born, 64% of
European-headed households own homes, compared with 52% of those born in
Asia, 41% of the Latin American-born and 38% of African-born.</TE>
<TE>   The lower home ownership rates for the foreign-born might be linked to
their concentration in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco, where
housing prices are among the highest in the nation, Schmidley said.</TE>
<TE>   The study underscores the evolving nature of immigrant settlement
patterns. Two-thirds of foreign-born live in the West and South, a shift
from the early 20th century, when most immigrants settled in the
Northeast and Midwest, and half of the nation's foreign-born in 1930
lived in the Northeast.</TE>
<TE>   The statistics tend to bolster the notion that immigrants from the
farthest-off countries are generally better off, though there are some
exceptions--well-off Canadians and wealthy Cubans are among the immigrant
mix, for instance. Schmidley said foreign-born residents from farther
away appear to start with more education or resources. "Those who must
travel the greatest distances seem more likely to be highly educated, or
able to bring wealth or anticipate having an occupation to sustain them,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   A complete breakdown of Census 2000 findings about the foreign-born
population is not expected for months. Initial Census 2000 numbers
indicate that the nation's foreign-born population approached 31 million,
more than 2 million more than this survey found. Experts attribute the
difference in part to more aggressive census-gathering techniques.
Despite the discrepancy, observers said the broad socioeconomic findings
in the survey should be mirrored by Census 2000.</TE>
<TE>   One constant theme in the study is the comparative lack of economic
progress by immigrants from Mexico, who account for more than one-quarter
of the nation's immigrant population. Mexican immigrants are more likely
to lack health insurance and be mired in low-wage, blue-collar jobs.</TE>
<TE>   A key reason, experts say, is that the Mexican population includes
legions of illegal immigrants, recent arrivals and people lacking high
school degrees. All these factors tend to deflate wage-earning ability.
The study included the nation's estimated 7.5 million illegal immigrants
but did not address them as a separate group.</TE>

<HD>Seeking Speedier Deportations, Ashcroft Plans Judicial Reforms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<AU>LISA GETTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Immigrants fighting to stay in the United States will face a
quicker road to deportation under a judicial reorganization plan unveiled
by federal authorities Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, which drew immediate fire from immigrant rights activists,
will restructure the board that hears appeals on immigration claims in an
effort to eliminate a growing backlog of more than 55,000 cases. Atty.
Gen. John Ashcroft, announcing the reorganization, hailed it as an
important step in a broader effort to plug holes in the U.S. immigration
system that were exposed by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Some immigration appeals have been languishing for as long as seven
years, posing a threat to national security, Ashcroft said. More than
300,000 immigrants that have been ordered deported have simply
disappeared.</LD>
<TE>   "When a case takes seven years, justice isn't merely denied, it's
derailed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The reorganization plan will allow judges on the Board of Immigration
Appeals--currently three-judge panels--to act alone in deciding the bulk
of cases. The plan will also prevent appellate judges from revisiting the
facts of a case unless there is a clear error by the lower immigration
court. And it will reduce the size of the appellate board from 23 judges
to 11 judges as part of an overall "streamlining."</TE>
<TE>   "America is a nation built on immigration, and we welcome those who
come here legally," Ashcroft said. "However, we also need an immigration
court system that commands our own respect, one that is fair, one that is
prompt, one that is efficient."</TE>
<TE>   But opponents said the plan could allow the Bush administration to
pack the board with more conservative judges and deprive immigrants of a
fair hearing into claims of political asylum, family connections and
other legal defenses that could help avoid deportation.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell University immigration law professor,
told a House committee hearing on the issue Wednesday that the
reorganization could produce a "staggering" workload for the downsized
appellate board and force judges to "rubber-stamp" their decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "The answer for an overburdened justice system is more and not less
due process," said Arthur Helton, a senior fellow at the Council on
Foreign Relations and an expert on immigration policy. "Instead of
reducing the appellate safety net, the Justice Department should invest
sufficient resources to ensure fairness for noncitizens subject to forced
exile."</TE>
<TE>   In ordering the reorganization, Ashcroft relied in part on a recent
audit that looked at a pilot program for streamlining the Board of
Immigration Appeals. That audit was conducted by Andersen, the accounting
giant now at the center of the Enron Corp. scandal. The firm was paid
$49,850 to conduct the immigration study for the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen concluded that the streamlining program was an "unqualified
success" that sped the process without compromising the results. By
consolidating the review, the appellate board should be able to complete
an additional 825 cases per month, the study projected.</TE>
<TE>   That's good news, Justice Department officials say, for a judicial
system that now handles about 30,000 appeals a year--a tenfold increase
since 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials complain that immigration appeals have
become backlogged in part because in the last few years appellate judges
have been much more willing to conduct "de novo" reviews, meaning that
the findings of the lower court are essentially thrown out and the case
is reviewed in its entirety.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft "is unhappy with the way the board has assumed the power to
revisit these issues denovo," an aide said.</TE>
<TE>   To reverse that trend, Ashcroft's plan establishes that the appellate
judges must accept the factual findings of the lower court, disturbing
them only if they are "clearly erroneous." The plan also bars the
introduction and consideration of new evidence before the appellate
panel, and it shortens the deadlines for filing and deciding appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Highlighting the dangers posed by years-long delays, Ashcroft cited
the case of an illegal immigrant accused of trafficking in $50-million
worth of heroin. Ashcroft said the appellate board took more than 5 1/2
years to decide his deportation case. "During that time, the individual
became a fugitive. . . . He still remains at large," the attorney general
said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics called the Ashcroft plan a thinly veiled effort to reduce
immigrant appeal rights and shed a number of Clinton administration
appointees whom the attorney general and others regard as too liberal.
After assailing the quality of immigration judges for years, civil
libertarians credited the Clinton administration with appointing
scholars, attorneys and others sympathetic to the immigrants' plight.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to get rid of the dissident elements," predicted Jeanne
Butterfield, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Assn.
"All the judges are going to be able to do after this is rubber-stamp
underlying decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to increase efficiency by slashing the board from [23]
members back down to 11? It's completely counterintuitive. . . . They get
30,000 cases a year, and you're going to have 11 judges. Do the math."</TE>
<TE>   The reorganization, expected to take effect in April following public
comment, comes just a week after the nation's immigration judges asked
Ashcroft to sever them from the Justice Department because they believe
that their legal independence has been compromised.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials said Wednesday that the reorganization
was not in response to the judges' request because the changes have been
in the works for months.</TE>
<TE>   "The confluence of all this is just coincidental," one official said.</TE>

<HD>Senate Kills Stimulus Plans, Extends Jobless Aid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Senate on Wednesday officially shelved legislation to stimulate
the economy, but quickly resurrected and approved one provision that
enjoyed broad support: a 13-week extension of aid to unemployed people
who have run out of benefits since Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The House is under heavy pressure to follow suit on the aid extension,
which President Bush also supports as a way to help the rapidly growing
ranks of the unemployed who have exhausted their 26 weeks of benefits.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate bill would provide the extended relief to about 5.6 million
people this year and into 2003, according to congressional estimates. It
is in keeping with the kind of aid Congress traditionally provides to
help laid-off workers cope with recessions.</LD>
<TE>   But it is a far more limited economic recovery measure than Congress
once had been expected to approve after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
which hurt an already struggling economy.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans and Democrats had included the additional unemployment aid
in their economic stimulus plans. But both of those bills died Wednesday
because of a stalemate in the Senate over other provisions--GOP proposals
to cut taxes and Democratic proposals to provide even more generous
benefits for the unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   The bills were shunted aside after the Senate held a pair of showdown
votes, and neither the Democratic nor the Republican alternatives
garnered the 60 votes needed to close debate. The bill to expand
unemployment benefits then passed on a voice vote.</TE>
<TE>   The unemployment measure now goes to the House, where Republicans have
long said that any increase in unemployment aid should be paired with tax
breaks designed to spur job creation.</TE>
<TE>   Some House Republicans are suggesting that the party attempt to add
tax cuts or other provisions to the unemployment bill, which could slow
its progress. Others want to simply go along with the popular bill rather
than give Democrats the opportunity to say Bush and the GOP are
unconcerned about the plight of the unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   "The politics are pretty simple: You just do it," a top House
leadership aide said.</TE>
<TE>   In Wednesday's Senate showdown on the broader economic stimulus
legislation, the move to close debate on the Democratic version was
supported by 56 senators--four short of the required 60. Voting against
the motion were 39 senators.</TE>
<TE>   The bill called for payments to people who did not receive rebates in
the tax cut bill passed last year, tax breaks to encourage business
investment, aid to states for expanding Medicaid and the expanded
unemployment benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The move to close debate on the Republican version, which included
more in tax cuts and less in unemployment benefits, failed, 48 to 47.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate then moved on to other legislation, including quick passage
of the unemployment measure. Members of both parties insisted that they
remained open to future talks on stimulus legislation, but that the
effort is considered essentially dead for the year, in part because of
signs that the economy is recovering.</TE>
<TE>   Bush had been urging Congress to enact a package of tax cuts and
unemployment aid for months. He continued Wednesday to insist on the need
for a broader bill and sought to blame Senate Democratic leaders for the
deadlock on the issue. But the president seemed to leave open the door to
signing a bill limited to unemployment benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "At the minimum, they need to take care of the workers--at the very
minimum," Bush told reporters Wednesday as he toured the New York Police
Department's command center in lower Manhattan. "But it's important for
Congress to realize that our economy has not yet fully recovered. And,
therefore, I believe we still need to provide stimulus for economic
growth so that there's jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Under the Senate bill, the 13 additional weeks would be available to
people in all 50 states--not just, as in some past recessions, those in
states with especially high unemployment. Congressional analysts say
preliminary estimates are that the bill would cost $7.2 billion this year
and $3.6 billion in 2003.</TE>

<HD>A Crucial Point</HD>
<DH>Agassi Has a New Wife and Son, an Injured Wrist and He
Needs a New Coach. Other Than That, Everything's Normal</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andre Agassi has been injured before, and, though it has been almost
eight years, he has gone through coaching changes. Usually, these
twin developments would stand alone, evaluated on their own merit.</LD>
<LD>   This is no longer the case. With his 32nd birthday a couple of
months away, the most recent pieces of information about Agassi in
the last month--a wrist injury keeping him out of the Australian Open
and a break with longtime coach Brad Gilbert--have been grouped
together:</LD>
<LD>   A plus B equals career in crisis.</LD>
<TE>   Together, the injury and coaching change have raised questions
about his future, generating legitimate scrutiny. But these things
can gather momentum, as Pete Sampras will attest, worrying sponsors
and tournament directors. A Sampras quote at Wimbledon in 2001,
pulled out of context, had him dealing with the issue of retirement
for months.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi, as always, is his best spokesman, stepping in front of the
rolling boulder, so to speak. In an interview, he spelled out his
current rehabilitation regime, and his future plans, which include
the addition of a new coach.</TE>
<TE>   He has been speaking with hand surgeon Leonard Gordon almost
daily, having first put the wrist in a splint and rehabilitating it
to decrease the pain and inflammation. Monday, he took the next step,
starting a strengthening program, engaging in light hitting for the
first time since the injury.</TE>
<TE>   And instead of winding down, Agassi is looking ahead, searching
for Gilbert's replacement. His focus is on one candidate, Australian
Darren Cahill, and Agassi said, "There's a strong likelihood it will
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi, who married Steffi Graf and became a father in October,
addressed the questions about his continued commitment in the
aftermath of his injury. He also allowed his doctor to be
interviewed, a rare concession from a private individual.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still very intent on maximizing whatever I have left," Agassi
told The Times in a telephone interview from his home in Las Vegas.
"And I do believe I have a lot left. I believe that with all my
heart. And this step is a crucial step for me because it's an
important time."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon said he is treating Agassi's inflamed wrist with
"conservative measures" to avoid surgery, which he had in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really hard to prognosticate as far as time is concerned,''
said Gordon, who noted that the injury to the lining of the tendons
on the back of Agassi's wrist is not uncommon but occurred in an
unusual place.</TE>
<TE>   "Different people heal at different rates. It would be nice to
say, specifically two weeks, three weeks or four weeks. One has to be
guarded as far as giving a definite time. With that being said, in
the next few weeks, we should see some additional healing. He may
well be back in a couple of weeks. We pretty much got rid of the
pain. We have to get back to him really using it, hitting a ball at
over 100 miles an hour for several hours."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi's next scheduled event is a tournament in San Jose, which
starts Feb. 25. Realistically, he can't make a coaching decision
before he is cleared to play. But he is restless and wants to move
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to. I have no choice," he said. "I don't have the luxury
of the next 20 years. What I need to do, I need to do quick. I need
to not waste time, get healthy and get directed and get focused. It's
not easy though, because at the same time, I'm spending a good
portion of the day trying to rehabilitate my situation and spending
the rest of my day sitting around wishing I could be out there
hitting balls."</TE>
<TE>   The Gilbert decision, mystifying from afar, unfolded quickly last
week. Gilbert and Agassi had been together since 1994, winning six
Grand Slam titles and an Olympic gold medal in 1996. They got
together quickly and parted swiftly, and amicably, both said.</TE>
<TE>   "Life goes on," Gilbert said. "We had a great run. I kind of came
in like that and I kind of leave like that, which is kind of cool, it
wasn't any long, drawn-out thing. We didn't wrangle over it for
months. The thing that's great is that we didn't go stale."</TE>
<TE>   Said Agassi: "It was no calculated choice of road, I assure you."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi said it is difficult to picture what it will be like
without Gilbert, describing the decision as a "timing" issue,
asserting that they didn't want to get too comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "He's looking toward the next 20 years and I'm looking toward the
next few," Agassi said. "The way we went about it and how it came
about is more a reflection of how we care about each other and look
out for each other."</TE>
<TE>   Cahill played in Gilbert's era, reaching the U.S. Open semifinals
in 1988. Agassi played Cahill twice in his career, and recalled the
specific details. The highly regarded Australian became available
after splitting with Lleyton Hewitt in December after Hewitt won the
U.S. Open and finished the season ranked No. 1. The reason for their
break is still largely unknown.</TE>
<TE>   "I've appreciated his work from afar," Agassi said. "I've made a
lot of assumptions about his abilities, and some of them, I've seen
first-hand. It's interesting. I really hope things can develop there
because I see a lot in him as a coach and hopefully he can feel
there's a lot to coach."</TE>
<TE>   For Agassi, this is a critical juncture, balancing his health, his
profession and family life. His thrill at being a new father is never
far from the surface. In fact, the conversation started with the end
of son Jaden Gil's feeding.</TE>
<TE>   "He has this little move after he eats where his arms are straight
up and he sticks his butt out and it looks like he's Superboy flying
or something," Agassi said. "There's a line in a song that I enjoy:
'Drunk like a baby on his mother's milk.' Now I finally know what
that's referring to. He looks like the happiest thing in the world
when he gets done eating.</TE>
<TE>   "I can only speak to what it feels like in 31/2 months and it's
amazing and it gets better by the day."</TE>

<LD>It's one thing to have the Olympics come into your living room
through the magic of television.</LD>
<LD>   It's quite another for the Olympics to move into your dorm room.</LD>
<LD>   As the eyes of the world fall on Salt Lake City, some of the local
basketball teams are hitting the road.</LD>
<TE>   Players at Utah moved out of dorms to make way for the Olympic
village, and high security and fences crisscross campus in
preparation for the opening ceremony Friday at Rice-Eccles Olympic
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I had the chain-link fence concession around here," Utah
Coach Rick Majerus said.</TE>
<TE>   At Weber State--home to the curling venue known as the Ice Sheet
at Ogden--a couple of players moved out of their rooms to make way
for Olympic security personnel, and the Wildcats' Dee Events Center
has become the media venue for curling.</TE>
<TE>   That means Weber State won't play a home game during the month of
February--a scheduling quirk that had Coach Joe Cravens fretting
until the Wildcats--15-7 and in second place in the Big Sky
Conference--started their five-game string on the road with a victory
Saturday at Idaho State.</TE>
<TE>   Brigham Young (14-6) is less affected. Though the Peaks Ice Arena
in Provo is home to some of the hockey competition, it isn't on
campus, and the Cougars will play only one more road game than usual.</TE>
<TE>   Utah--16-4 after suffering its first Mountain West loss Monday to
Wyoming--actually will play two home games during the Olympics, Feb.
16 against Air Force and Feb. 18 against New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   With security high and traffic and parking disrupted, it will be
interesting to see how many people venture to the Huntsman Center.</TE>
<TE>   Classes are suspended until Feb. 26, so Majerus has taken his team
on the road, building in extended stays in San Diego and Las Vegas
around Saturday's game against San Diego State and Monday's game at
Nevada Las Vegas and a trip to St. George, Utah, for practice
sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Majerus didn't have to move out of the hotel near campus where he
has lived for many years--but he has had visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "I have an unbelievable porch--the best view in Salt Lake
City--and the FBI is in there looking at it," Majerus said.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Look, I don't have a grenade launcher.' I just told them
to make sure to lock up when they leave."</TE>
<TE>   So the Olympics are coming to Salt Lake City, and all some of
these players are getting is a trip.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't make any difference. It's just the way it is," Majerus
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's once in a lifetime, and this school is benefiting."</TE>
<TE>   Burgess' Long Road</TE>
<TE>   It seems like a faraway time when Chris Burgess was considered one
of the top high school players in the country in 1997--along with a
fellow named Lamar Odom.</TE>
<TE>   He was part of a Southern California crop that included Baron
Davis and Jason and Jarron Collins--and like them, he figured to be
in the NBA by now.</TE>
<TE>   Burgess went from Irvine Woodbridge High to Duke, where he played
behind Elton Brand--yet another player who preceded him to the pros.</TE>
<TE>   Burgess transferred to Utah, but struggled with back problems his
redshirt season and an ankle injury part of last season.</TE>
<TE>   Sidelined for the last month because of a foot injury, his
attempts to return to practice have resulted in setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel bad for the kid," said Majerus, whose team has turned
to an all-out three-point assault in Burgess' absence. (It was
successful until a poor shooting game against Wyoming.)</TE>
<TE>   "My honest opinion, I don't know if he'll be back, but if he is
back, he'll be a third of what he is."</TE>
<TE>   Burgess was on the bench in street clothes for the Wyoming loss.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of sad," Majerus said. "I yelled at him the other day,
just to make him feel like part of the team."</TE>
<TE>   The Oregon Trail</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's sweep of UCLA and USC in Eugene last week was so
impressive it vaulted the Ducks not only back into the Top 25 but all
the way to No. 13--still two spots behind Arizona, a team the Ducks
beat twice.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the Two Lukes--Ridnour and Jackson--the extremely athletic
Freddie Jones and much-improved big man Chris Christoffersen, the
Ducks have proved themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere except on the road, that is.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon has a losing record away from McArthur Court, and all five
losses have been on the road--including stumbles against Arizona
State and Washington, not exactly the stuff of Pacific 10 champions.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Ducks can win the Pac-10--on second thought, make that
top seeding in the Pac-10 tournament--could well turn on their
performances at Stanford tonight and at Cal on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't fear going on the road or anything," Coach Ernie Kent
said. "But they know how tough these battles are going to be with
Stanford and Cal."</TE>
<TE>   Take note: The Ducks' four remaining games against Pac-10
contenders are all on the road. Oregon closes out the regular season
at USC and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "People say this team is not a good road team; we just haven't
closed out the games on the road," Kent said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a relatively young basketball team that gains a lot of
confidence playing at home in front of family and friends, on our own
court. There's a great comfort zone there for us. We're still
learning how to maintain that calm and focus on the road--although it
is very deceiving, our road record, because we've never been blown
out and we've been in every game."</TE>
<TE>   Kent's prescription for the road: "Limit your turnovers and limit
your bad shots, because the road is not as forgiving as Mac Court."</TE>
<TE>   Boos for Bloomington Fans</TE>
<TE>   Turning on Steve Alford is one thing, though it certainly doesn't
show much appreciation for history.</TE>
<TE>   But some Indiana fans' treatment of Luke Recker in his first
return to Assembly Hall as an Iowa player was truly odious.</TE>
<TE>   Recker was the Hoosier hero who transferred to Arizona during the
Bob Knight era but never played for the Wildcats, transferring to
Iowa to play for Alford after being injured in a car crash that
killed the friend who was driving and left his now-former girlfriend
paralyzed.</TE>
<TE>   "You try not to hear it, you try not to listen to it, but it's a
tough atmosphere," the Indianapolis Star quoted Recker as saying
after Iowa's loss. "But I can guarantee you one thing: I've been
through a lot tougher circumstances than this. This isn't going to
break me.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not happy with the way I played. It will forever be a memory
in my mind. But if this is the worst thing that ever happens to me,
I'll survive and I'll move on."</TE>
<TE>   Matter of fact, it wasn't even the worst treatment he ever
received at the hands of people who consider themselves Indiana fans.</TE>
<TE>   "I received letters when I first got in the accident ... that
said, 'I wish you would have died,'" Recker said. "It was a personal
decision for me to leave. I wasn't happy in this program. It had
nothing to do with the Indiana fans. They support their team."</TE>
<TE>   Give Indiana's team credit for more class and compassion. As the
Indianapolis Star noted, almost every Indiana player and coach
embraced Recker after the game.</TE>

<HD>NIT Will Add Eight Teams on Trial Basis</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the last 30 years, the National Invitation Tournament has
provided a second chance for college basketball teams that didn't
make the field for the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Now, in a one-year experiment, eight more schools will get the
opportunity to extend their seasons.</LD>
<LD>   The Metropolitan Intercollegiate Basketball Assn., which runs the
preseason and postseason NITs, said Wednesday the one-year expansion
from 32 teams to 40 is in reaction to repeated requests from around
college basketball.</LD>
<TE>   "Conference commissioners, athletic directors and coaches [asked]
us to expand our postseason NIT field to accommodate additional teams
who have had successful seasons in their conference but have failed
to receive an invitation to the NCAA tournament," NIT Executive
Director John J. Powers said.</TE>
<TE>   The NIT will have eight opening-round games March 12 at campus
sites, with the winners advancing to the first round, which ends
March 15. The second round is March 18-19, the third round March
20-22, and the semifinals at New York's Madison Square Garden on
March 26. The championship game is March 28.</TE>

<LD>   Idaho (7-13, 4-7) at UC Irvine (16-6, 9-2), 5:30, Fox Sports Net
2, KUCI-FM (88.9)--The Anteaters must not get caught looking ahead to
Saturday's showdown against Utah State. Sophomore center Adam Parada
is shooting 64% from the field in Big West Conference play. Idaho is
the lowest-scoring team in the conference. Irvine won, 92-54, at
Moscow, Idaho on Jan. 12.</LD>
<LD>   Cal State Northridge (8-11, 7-3) at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo
(12-7, 6-5), 7, KCSN-FM (88.5)-- The Matadors are coming off a 74-58
loss last week at Pacific. Senior guard Markus Carr ranks third in
the Big West in scoring (17.4) and leads the conference in assists
(4.8) and steals (2.8). Sophomore center Varnie Dennis averages 15.3
points for the Mustangs, who are 8-1 at home in Kevin Bromley's first
full season as coach.</LD>
<TE>   Pacific (14-6, 6-4) at UC Santa Barbara (12-8, 6-5), 7--The
Gauchos have lost some momentum after an 8-2 start. They hit a low
Saturday at Idaho when they lost to the Vandals, 40-37, despite
giving up only nine field goals. Junior forward Mark Hull has been in
a shooting slump the last three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Utah State (16-4, 8-3) at Long Beach State (8-14, 4-7), 7:30--Long
Beach will try to extend its winning streak to three games after
winning Big West road games at Cal State Fullerton and UC Riverside
last week. Senior center Travis Reed scored 30 points against
Fullerton and 31 against Riverside to become the first 49er to record
consecutive 30-point games since Ed Ratleff in 1973. Junior forward
Desmond Penigar, a transfer from Ventura College, is averaging a
team-high 17.8 points a game for Utah State, which defeated Long
Beach, 70-66, on Jan. 12 at Logan, Utah.</TE>

<LD>John Crumpacker in the San Francisco Chronicle, commenting on an
activity in the Winter Olympics: "You are standing on a sheet of
ice.... In your hand is a polished granite stone weighing up to 44
pounds, conveniently fitted with a handle. The stone comes from a
quarry in Scotland.</LD>
<LD>   "You slowly approach what is called the hog line and release the
stone while someone in front of you with a broom sweeps the ice with
demented fury. This lasts for two to three hours....</LD>
<LD>   "What the heck are you doing? You're curling, of course."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More curling: Crumpacker on the origin of the sport: "Long ago,
Scots with nothing better to do threw rocks onto the frozen locks in
winter to watch them slide.</TE>
<TE>   "In the same spirit, supermarket employees working the graveyard
shift have been known to engage in turkey bowling, in which a frozen
tom is sent hurtling down the aisle toward a set of 10 2-liter
plastic bottles."</TE>

<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the youngest quarterback to start a Super Bowl
game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Remember? New England's rally in a tie game in the waning seconds
to win the Super Bowl against St. Louis with a field goal as time
expired is reminiscent of an even greater Super Bowl comeback.</TE>
<TE>   That came in Super Bowl XXIII in Miami, where quarterback Joe
Montana led the San Francisco 49ers on a 92-yard game-winning drive
in the final minutes. It was climaxed by his touchdown pass to John
Taylor with 34 seconds remaining for a 20-16 victory.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Repellent: Jay Leno, while holding a bottle labeled
"Interception": "This is Kurt Warner's new cologne. You put this on
and the other guy scores."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tougher test: Augusta National, site of the Masters, has been
lengthened 300 yards, making it tougher for older players such as
71-year-old Arnold Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   "As a fan of [his], I don't want to see him play poorly," Tiger
Woods said. "And the golf course now, it's just like any other player
who doesn't hit the ball very long. They're going to struggle. And
they're going to struggle a lot."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grand slam: Bob Sansevere in the St. Paul Pioneer Press: "By
refusing to hear an appeal by major league baseball and the Twins,
the Minnesota Supreme Court slammed the door on contraction.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just too bad [Commissioner] Bud Selig and [Twins owner] Carl
Pohlad didn't have their fingers in the doorjamb when it slammed
shut."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Will he even watch? Rasheed Wallace of the Portland Trail Blazers
wasn't selected to play in Sunday's All-Star game, but he seemingly
isn't upset about it: "I couldn't care less. It just frees me for the
weekend to party."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Dan Marino of the Miami Dolphins, 23 years four
months.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Dion Rich told Bloomberg News he got past security
that the U.S. Secret Service said was equal to a presidential
inauguration to sneak into what he claims was his 33rd Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Rich, 72, said he got into the Louisiana Superdome through a side
door that was opened by an usher and left unattended.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Reilly, a Sports Illustrated columnist, said he watched Rich
slip in. "It took him about six minutes. He looked like Fred Astaire
walking into his own kitchen."</TE>

<HD>Tennessee Knocks Off No. 7 Kentucky</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tennessee's latest nail-biter ended up being their biggest victory
under first-year Coach Buzz Peterson.</LD>
<LD>   Marcus Haislip scored 24 points, including the game-winning basket
with 18 seconds left in overtime, to lift the Volunteers past No. 7
Kentucky, 76-74, in a Southeastern Conference game Wednesday night at
Knoxville, Tenn.</LD>
<LD>   The Volunteers (12-10, 5-4) had been 0-7 in games decided by five
points or less, but Tennessee has used those heartbreaking
experiences to pull off close victories against Syracuse, Louisiana
State, Vanderbilt and the Wildcats (15-6, 5-4).</LD>
<TE>   "I told them late in the game, 'We are going to win,'" Peterson
said.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't look like much of a cliffhanger at the beginning, as
Kentucky led until midway through the second half before needing a
three-point basket to send the game into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   In overtime, Kentucky went ahead, 74-72, on a basket by Chuck
Hayes with 2:05 left. Tennessee's Thaydeus Holden then made two from
the line to tie the score with 50 seconds to go.</TE>
<TE>   Tayshaun Prince, who finished with 22 points for Kentucky, lost
the ball out of bounds on the next possession, and Haislip put in his
own missed shot at the other end for the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky got the ball and looked disorganized when Kentucky Coach
Tubby Smith called a timeout with 3.3 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to push it up," Smith said. "It looked like we took
forever to get it to the frontcourt. There was some indecision on
what we wanted to do."</TE>
<TE>   After seeing the offense Kentucky put on the court, Peterson then
called another timeout.</TE>
<TE>   When play resumed, all the Volunteers had to do was prevent
another basket. They did.</TE>
<TE>   Prince's three-point try missed at the buzzer and Tennessee
students and fans spilled onto the court to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Oklahoma 70, Baylor 57--The Sooners (18-3, 7-2 in Big 12)
shook off a sluggish first-half performance that included a
six-minute scoring drought at Norman, Okla., to defeat the Bears
(13-9, 3-6) for the 14th consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor has not beaten the Sooners since 1977-78, when current
Bears coach Dave Bliss was head coach at Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 Alabama 79, Mississippi 59--Erwin Dudley had 22 points and
10 rebounds at Tuscaloosa, Ala., as the Crimson Tide (20-3, 8-1 in
Southeastern Conference) matched their best start in 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama has a 60-8 series lead over the Rebels (17-6, 6-4) in
games at Tuscaloosa.</TE>
<TE>   No. 6 Cincinnati 85, Charlotte 66--Leonard Stokes scored 30 points
and Steve Logan added 24 at Charlotte, N.C., as the Bearcats (21-2,
9-1 in Conference USA) snapped the 49ers' seven-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati never trailed and knocked Charlotte (14-6, 8-2) out of
a three-way tie for first place in the American Division.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina State 85, No. 10 Virginia 68--Scooter Sherrill
scored a career-high 20 points off the bench at Raleigh, N.C., as the
Wolfpack (17-6, 6-4 in Atlantic Coast Conference) swept the Cavaliers
(14-6, 4-5) in the regular season for the first time since 1987-88.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia (14-6, 4-5) dropped its in a row.</TE>
<TE>   No. 14 Oklahoma State 64, No. 24 Texas Tech 62--The Cowboys (18-5,
5-5 in Big 12), after trailing by as many as 15 points in the second
half, rallied at Stillwater, Okla., and defeated the Red Raiders
(16-5, 5-4) on Terrence Crawford's putback with 5.3 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin 94, No. 16 Ohio State 92--Devin Harris made five free
throws over the final 19 seconds of overtime as the Badgers (13-11,
6-5 in Big Ten) edged the Buckeyes (17-4, 8-2) at Madison, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State fell into a first-pace tie in the conference race with
Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   No. 17 Georgia 86, Mississippi State 68--Steve Thomas had 21
points and 10 rebounds as the Bulldogs (18-5, 7-3 in Southeastern
Conference) scored their first victory at Humphrey Coliseum in
Starkville, Miss., in 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi State (17-6, 4-5) also had its nine-game home winning
streak end.</TE>
<TE>   No. 18 Marquette 70, East Carolina 58-- Dwyane Wade scored 24
points as the Golden Eagles (20-3, 9-1 Conference USA) won their
ninth consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   East Carolina (8-14, 2-8) lost its 14th consecutive road game.</TE>
<TE>   No. 19 Wake Forest 90, North Carolina 66--Josh Howard scored 25
points at Winston-Salem, N.C., as the Deamon Deacons (17-6, 7-3 in
ACC) swept the season series from the Tar Heels (6-14, 2-8) for the
first time since the 1969-70 season.</TE>
<TE>   No. 22 Missouri 76, Iowa State 73--Kareem Rush scored 23 of his 27
points in the second half at the Tigers (17-6, 6-3 in Big 12) held
off the Cyclones (9-15, 1-5) at Columbia, Mo.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Fred Roggin's Road to Salt Lake"</LD>
<LD>   Where: Ch. 4, Friday, 6:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This one-hour special, which serves as a prelude to NBC's coverage
of the opening ceremony for the Winter Olympics, profiles 13 Olympic
athletes, 11 of whom are from Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The lead segment is on Michelle Kwan of Torrance. Kwan, who has
won four world figure skating championships and six U.S. titles but
never an Olympic gold medal, tells Roggin, "For me to be happy in my
life, I don't feel my life will be empty if I don't win the Olympics,
but it also would be a dream come true."</TE>
<TE>   The piece, which includes such scenes as Kwan playing beach
volleyball with her UCLA friends, concludes with her saying, "I'm
very honored when people come up and say, 'You've changed my life or
inspired me.' That's what I want through my skating. If I can inspire
them or make them happy for four minutes, that's good enough for me,
that's better than any medal."</TE>
<TE>   To spice up the segment on another figure skater, Sasha Cohen, 17,
of Laguna Niguel, Roggin goes with her on a shopping trip to a mall.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Parra, a 5-foot-4, 31-year-old speedskater from San
Bernardino, was a two-time world champion on-line skater who switched
to ice skates in 1996. "It was like Michael Jordan, who went from
being the best basketball player to just another baseball player,"
Parra says.</TE>
<TE>   Another interesting profile is on Tommy Czeschin, 22, a
snowboarder and entrepreneur from Mammoth Lakes. For two years, he
owned and operated the local laundromat.</TE>
<TE>   Other athletes profiled are short-track speedskater Rusty Smith,
the Mighty Ducks' Paul Kariya, the Kings' Adam Deadmarsh and Aaron
Miller, figure skater Tim Goebel, hockey player Angela Ruggiero and
freestyle aerialist Tracy Evans.</TE>

<HD>Ducks, Kariya Have a Blast</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Tverdovsky's goal with 12.6 seconds left and
winger's hat trick bring 5-4 victory over Flyers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His stoic expressions say little. His work ethic is well known. His
answers are always correct.</LD>
<LD>   If Paul Kariya has issues about his plight, and that of the Mighty
Ducks, they are never betrayed. All that was seen Wednesday was what
he can accomplish on the ice, given the opportunity.</LD>
<LD>   Oleg Tverdovsky's blast from the blue line with 12.6 seconds left
gave the Ducks a 5-4 come-from-behind victory over the Philadelphia
Flyers in front of an announced 13,614 Wednesday. But it was Kariya,
who had his seventh career hat trick, who got mobbed by teammates at
the end.</LD>
<TE>   The Ducks trailed by two goals three times before scoring three
third-period goals to extend their winning streak to six games, one
shy of the team record.</TE>
<TE>   The hats came flying when Kariya finally got them even eight
minutes into the third period. He took a cross-ice pass from Mike
Leclerc and fired in a shot past goalie Brian Boucher for a
power-play goal that tied the score, 4-4.</TE>
<TE>   Kariya, who had only one goal in the first 11 games, now has 22.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than the puck going in the net easily for him, Paul has
done everything you could ask of a star player,'' Coach Bryan Murray
said. "We have had a little bit of a problem getting him the puck
some nights."</TE>
<TE>   Not Wednesday. Kariya scored the Ducks first goal when Mike
Leclerc found him alone in the slot. He scored his second goal when
Andy McDonald, all 5 feet 10, 186 pounds, cleared traffic from the
net. Kariya scored his third when Leclerc him spotted alone on the
right.</TE>
<TE>   This was the type of performance that make pulses race north of
the border, as Canadian fans eagerly anticipate Kariya's appearance
in the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   A gold medal, Canada's first in 50 years, seems to be the only
championship moment in Kariya's near future. The Ducks may have tied
the Minnesota Wild in the standings, but that's for 13th in the
Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   But Kariya has betrayed no sign of frustration, although his coach
knows it's there.</TE>
<TE>   "He wouldn't be much of a guy if he wasn't frustrated," Murray
said. "I'm frustrated. I'm frustrated when we don't win every night.
I like to see the team in the playoff hunt right now. Paul wants to
be in a competitive situation every night. It's only fair that any
good player wants that opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have had a week off to ponder their recent success. That
their winning streak could be extended against the high-flying
Flyers, who were 17-4-1 in their 22 previous games, seemed a
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we have to try to take another step and compete against good
teams and obviously the Flyers are good team out of the east right
now," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' problem was a sizable one ... John LeClair, Jeremy
Roenick, Keith Primeau.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is smaller than the Flyers and we're smaller than
everybody," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Ducks held their ground.</TE>
<TE>   "I have heard a lot guys on other teams saying we're hard to play
against, which wasn't the case at the beginning of the season," Duck
goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere said.</TE>
<TE>   The one Duck who didn't seem overwhelmed by the Flyers'
thump-and-bump style was McDonald, who tied the Ducks' rookie record
with three assists. His play helped create Kariya's two goals.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald out-fought Luke Richardson, the Flyers' 6-4, 220
defenseman, behind the net late in the first period. He managed to
knock the puck to Leclerc, who centered to Kariya for a goal. .</TE>
<TE>   "Playing against bigger guys always motivates me," McDonald said.
"You try not to change the way you play the game from team to team,
but a little extra motivation always helps."</TE>

and later released him, and gave Jean-Sebastien Giguere a chance. He
did not squander it.</LD>
<LD>   Giguere has become the bedrock that Duck management hopes to build
around. Among goalies who have played at least 20 games before
Wednesday, he ranks behind only Colorado's Patrick Roy with a 2.04
goals-against average and is fourth in the league with a .922 save
percentage.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm really happy when I look at my stats," Giguere said. "But I
don't live for my stats. My goal was to get one full season under my
belt, which I have never done before in the NHL. I really want to
finish strong and get that goal."</LD>
<TE>   That's seems a given now. Giguere might have been a question last
season, as he had only 33 NHL games behind him. He has been the
answer in net.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had only Hebert as their starting goalie from their
1993-94 expansion season until last season. When Hebert's play
deteriorated rapidly during the 1999-2000 season, they needed to find
a fix. They acquired Giguere from Calgary for a second-round pick in
June 2000 and he has panned out.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere started 24 of the final 25 games last season.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an example of a young goaltender that has taken a little bit
of time to get there, but he's reaching a point in his career now
that he is comparable to all the good goaltenders in the league,"
Coach Bryan Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   An improved Duck defense has certainly helped Giguere and is a big
reason why the team ranked 10th out of 30 teams in goals-against
before Wednesday's game. The Ducks were 22nd last season.</TE>
<TE>   "If you get confidence in your goalie, it's a huge thing, that's
all you need," defenseman Ruslan Salei said. "I think he is playing
unbelievable. You just know he's going to make that save when you
need it the most."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kariya played his 500th NHL game Wednesday against
Philadelphia.... Center Steve Rucchin, who has missed 40 games
because of an ankle injury, joined the team briefly at the end of
Wednesday's morning skate. Murray said Rucchin would return after the
Olympic break.</TE>

<HD>Woods Stays on Short List of Contenders</HD>
<DH>Golf: On the eve of Buick Invitational at Torrey Pines,
world's best player says his game is rounding into form.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA JOLLA</DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods stood in front of the microphone last week at the Lodge
at Pebble Beach to say a few words about receiving the PGA Tour's
player of the year award for 2001. "It was an interesting year,"
Woods began his remarks. "I worked my way out of two bona fide media
slumps."</LD>
<LD>   That's Tiger's world for you, delivered by the subject himself,
revealing in two sentences a complete analysis of how his golf game
gets looked at by, well, just about everyone.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, it was the golf media that brought up the notion of a
Woods "slump," since he hadn't won a PGA Tour event since August
2000. True, he had won seven times worldwide before the NEC
Invitational in August 2000, and three more times worldwide after it
(the Johnnie Walker Classic, the PGA Grand Slam and the EMC World
Cup), but they hadn't seemed to count for much.</LD>
<TE>   And now it's time to cover some old ground for Woods, who remains
the player to beat in any tournament he plays, in this case the
$3.6-million Buick Invitational that begins today at Torrey Pines.
For Woods, it's only his third tour event of the year, following the
Mercedes Championships the first week of January, where he tied for
10th, and Pebble Beach, where he closed with a 68 and tied for 12th.
For most, that's a decent start, but the perception persists that
Woods is somehow not a factor unless he starts winning.</TE>
<TE>   And, for the record, Woods indicates he may not be that far off.
"The strongest part of my game is probably the short game," he said
Wednesday. "I've had a lot of practice at it, unfortunately. I
haven't really hit the ball particularly well, but I'm working on a
few things this week to get my playing more consistent, and that's
going to take a little time. It's coming around. When I do trust it,
I hit good shots, and that's a good thing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a matter of getting up there and trusting when you feel
a little uneasy over certain shots. I tend to get back into some old
faults again and try and get out of there."</TE>
<TE>   Woods says there's nothing wrong with his swing that's the fault
of his new prototype titanium Nike driver that he used last week and
he's packing in his bag again this week for the Buick. Actually,
Woods is among the top players in driving accuracy (73.9%) and he is
averaging 309.2 yards a drive.</TE>
<TE>   Where Woods has said his troubles seem to be reflected in the
greens-in-regulation statistics, he's 17th compared to fifth a year
ago. He also ranks 154th in putting (1.852 putts per green), which
isn't close to his year-end average a year ago (1.775) that placed
him 102nd in the putting statistics. What's more, Woods' scoring
average is 70.38, compared to 69.25 at the stage of the season a year
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he has played only two tournaments, so it's a little
premature to start worrying about Woods' performance. He certainly
isn't worried.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I'm hitting the ball probably more solid this year than I
did last year [at this time], but I'm not scoring quite as well
because I'm not hitting my irons close enough. The last few weeks,
I've putted well. I've rolled the ball well, I just haven't gotten on
greens that have been that smooth. This week, the greens are perfect
out here, so it's going to be fun to get out there and play."</TE>
<TE>   The greens that Woods referred are on the newly redone South
Course, the object of a $3.3-million renovation by Rees Jones that
has put Torrey Pines in line as a potential site for the 2008 U.S.
Open.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone who's been asked, including Woods and defending champion
Phil Mickelson, has heralded the course. All 18 greens are new, there
are a dozen new bunkers and 500 yards have been added so it could be
played at a monstrous 7,600 yards. At the 18th, which has been
lengthened 75 yards, Woods says that depending on wind conditions,
it's still reachable with driver, two-iron. John Daly reached it in
two in his practice round Wednesday and remains a huge fan of using
the biggest club in his bag.</TE>
<TE>   "Golf courses should be built for people to hit drivers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Few hit drivers as far as Daly, but Woods can. And no one wins
more tournaments than Woods, who had 29 when he turned 26 on Dec. 30.
In the last three years, Woods has won 22 PGA Tour events and five
majors. He held all four major titles at once when he won the Masters
last April.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, what will he do for an encore? Next week, he is
probably going to play the Nissan Open at Riviera, although he hasn't
officially said so, and the World Match Play Championship is two
weeks later at La Costa. Then it's off to Florida for Bay Hill, the
Players Championship and then the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   That's the schedule, demanding as it may be. And, fair or not,
some may point out he's still five victories behind last year's
total. At this point, Woods will worry about next week when it's
time. He has a different mentality.</TE>
<TE>   "Just get better every week and hopefully I can continue to do
that. I felt I was progressing day after day. Last week, I was
hitting the ball more crisp. I just need to keep working on the
things I'm working on. It's coming together."</TE>
<TE>   He said it feels nice. The way Woods sees it, it's a weekly
proposition, up for renewal every Sunday. At this point, that's good
enough for him and it should be the same for everybody else.</TE>

<HD>Daly Enjoys His Own Form of Contraction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LA JOLLA</DL>
<LD>Thinking has sometimes been a risky proposition, even for the best
players, who often rely on instinct and muscle memory to carry them
through the tough spots.</LD>
<LD>   Along the same lines, John Daly says the best thing he ever did
was stop letting others think for him. In a novel approach, he
decided to think for himself.</LD>
<LD>   "I let contracts dictate my life," he said. "It was like, 'You
can't do this,' 'You have to do that.' It put a lot of pressure on
me, a lot of stress. The contracts said if I wasn't on my medication,
I was gone.</LD>
<TE>   "I was a walking zombie. There was just no energy in my life to do
anything. That was the price I paid for listening to everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Daly stopped ... stopped listening, stopped taking
anti-depressants and in essence stopped (or forfeited) his
sponsorship deals with such heavyweights as Callaway and Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Dorman of Callaway would not comment on the specifics of
Daly's deal and said instead that Callaway wishes only the best for
Daly.</TE>
<TE>   So far, this thinking thing is working out for Daly. As part of
his new alliance with the European PGA Tour, he tied for 39th last
week in Melbourne and tied for fourth at Phoenix two weeks ago. He
also tied for 34th at the Bob Hope. Neither number is as important as
Daly's world ranking, No. 47. Daly wants to play the Masters and
needs to remain in the top 50 to succeed. He's a lock for the World
Match Play Championship in two weeks at La Costa, where the top 64
players in the rankings are invited. This week he's playing in the
Buick Invitational at Torrey Pines, and he will play the Nissan Open
at Riviera next week.</TE>
<TE>   Daly, who turns 36 in July, hasn't won since the 1995 British Open
and saw his world ranking drop all the way to 506. Last year, Daly
made $828,914 and had four top 10s, his first such showing in three
years. He credits it all to a renewed focus and desire, which are
possible because he's not distracted by off-the-course problems.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to just think about golf. It's been a long time coming.
My mind just told me to quit listening to everybody and get off that
crap. I want to win, but I'm not going to force the issue," said
Daly, who says he's better prepared mentally for the rigors of
competing hard for a title.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest change is my bounce back," he said. "If I have a bad
hole, I make par or birdie on the next hole. In the past, it would
ruin my tournament. I don't get upset over shots like I used to.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a late maturer in life."</TE>
<TE>   A Good Idea</TE>
<TE>   News item: Lanny Wadkins, 51, says he plans to play a lot on the
Senior PGA Tour until June, when he replaces commentator Ken Venturi
at CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Uh, any thoughts about picking up a microphone and
practicing in the eight CBS events between now and June?</TE>
<TE>   Hot, Hotter, Hottest</TE>
<TE>   It was a royal meltdown Sunday at Pebble Beach when Pat Perez lost
his cool and chopped up the 14th fairway after knocking a shot out of
bounds, then chopped up the 18th fairway and tried to bend his
three-wood over his knee after first knocking his tee shot out of
bounds, then knocking his fairway shot into the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Nicklaus, who noticed, says he used to get mad, but kept it
to himself. As for Perez, Nicklaus said his anger over hitting the
balls in the wrong places was misplaced. "The golf club didn't do
that," he said. "It seems terrible to punish a club like that. I
think the tour definitely needs to control that."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Update</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus, by the way, is a physical mess. It's not because of his
hip replacement surgery, it's his back that forced him out of this
week's senior event in Florida. In fact, since the Senior British
Open last July, Nicklaus has played in three made-for-TV events and
withdrawn from three events, including the MasterCard Championships.</TE>
<TE>   How this will affect his chances of playing the Masters is
unknown, but it would be hard to believe that anything short of a
broken leg would keep Nicklaus from playing Augusta National.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia Time</TE>
<TE>   Who earned their PGA Tour cards at the following ages: 25, 22, 20,
17?</TE>
<TE>   Big-Timing It</TE>
<TE>   Daly says Little Rock, Ark., isn't that small a place and it has
some good things going for it: "TCBY, Dillards."</TE>
<TE>   More Daly</TE>
<TE>   His hometown of Dardanelle, Ark., is equally vigorous. "Wal-Mart,
McDonald's, what more do you need?"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia Answer</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Palmer, 25; Nicklaus, 22; Tiger Woods, 20; Ty Tryon, 17.</TE>
<TE>   The Price of Success</TE>
<TE>   Annika Sorenstam is going to be very busy this year because she
has to defend eight titles. She starts the season defending titles in
four of the first five events.</TE>
<TE>   Star Power</TE>
<TE>   Bill Gross, a businessman from Laguna Beach, paid a $7,500 entry
fee to play in the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, where his
partner was Kevin Sutherland. On Sunday, Sutherland-Gross made the
cut and were paired with Woods and partner Jerry Chang.</TE>
<TE>   Gross seemed to have a good time: "I'll tell you, I've faced
bullets in Vietnam and been on television cameras, but there's just
nothing like it."</TE>

<HD>Allison Is Energized</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Allison, hampered most of January by a sinus infection that
sapped his energy, said Wednesday that he feels much better and that
the virus should not affect his play if he continues taking the
medicine his doctors have advised him to use for the next two months.</LD>
<LD>   "The last two games before the All-Star break I started to get my
energy back," he said. "I had a little more jump."</LD>
<LD>   Allison leads the Kings with 38 points in 45 games, well off the
pace he set last season in scoring a career-high 95 in 82 games with
the Boston Bruins.</LD>
<TE>   Acquired in an Oct. 24 trade, he has been utilized in several line
combinations as Coach Andy Murray tries to find the right chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the biggest difference from previous years is that I
haven't had a lot of big games," said Allison, whose recent slowdown
(10 points in his last 17 games) has thrown him off the point-a-game
pace he had maintained into late December. "All my years in Boston
I'd go through stretches where I'd get three or four points [in some
games] and maybe in a 10-game period you're getting 16, 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, it's kind of like one-two, one-two. Part of that is, we've
had a lot of injuries. And I don't really have a line right now. I'm
playing with C.J. [Craig Johnson] and Nellie [Nelson Emerson], but
some periods we only play one or two shifts together [because of
penalties], then I'm with Bucky [Kelly Buchberger] and Herbie [Steve
Heinze] sometimes."</TE>

<HD>Lakers Can't Toe the Line</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: O'Neal sits out as Bulls win again, 97-89,
marking L.A.'s fourth loss in last five at Staples Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever vulnerable, ever fragile, the Lakers reached their season's
symbolic halfway point with yet another loss that defied reason,
other than the figure in gray on their gloomy bench.</LD>
<LD>   They said they couldn't wait for the woeful Chicago Bulls to get
to Staples Center. Remember? Said the thuggish Bulls would pay for
their ugliness.</LD>
<LD>   Then, on Wednesday night, with Shaquille O'Neal resting his big
right toe eight chairs from Phil Jackson, the Lakers lost again to
the Bulls, 97-89, at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   Including a road loss to the Clippers, the Lakers have lost four
of five games in their arena.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers went to the All-Star break clinging to Kobe Bryant.
They had won four games in a row, all on the road, all with O'Neal,
who was the conference's player of the week for that contribution.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant scored 38 points, and could not hold off the Bulls, in part
because he had eight turnovers. He was the only Laker with more than
11 points, and so the Bulls rode Marcus Fizer's 21 points and Kevin
Ollie's 15 to their second consecutive victory against the Lakers,
twice-defending NBA champions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not embarrassing," Bryant said. "It's just very upsetting. I
don't think we matched their intensity. I don't think we understood
how hard they played."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had 20 turnovers and missed 14 of 17 threes, and so
begged the Bulls to run and score easily. Six of the Lakers' 13
losses were to last-place teams.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about our ability to respond to game situations,"
Jackson said, "and the fact we didn't meet the qualifications, the
parameters, that this game demanded."</TE>
<TE>   Charmed by the Dallas Mavericks' zone defense three days before,
Jackson ordered the Lakers into a 2-3 alignment in the fourth
quarter, and the Bulls appeared uncomfortable with it. Late offensive
fouls by Fizer and Ron Artest were due, in part, to them charging
into the middle of the Laker defense, on consecutive possessions. On
the next, the shot clock expired on the Bulls, and the Lakers drew to
within 81-80 on Samaki Walker's layup.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the Bulls outscored the Lakers, 16-9, and went merrily
into their break, with 11 victories.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers played for the ninth time in 46 games without O'Neal.
They are 5-4 without him.</TE>
<TE>   By early in the second quarter it was clear the Lakers would win
only if Bryant could stay with the Bulls offensively, and if the rest
of the Lakers could defend the undertalented but game Bulls.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant scored only four points in the first quarter, but 10 in the
second, when he played only five minutes. He had 30 by the end of the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   While it seemed inconceivable the Lakers who beat the San Antonio
Spurs without O'Neal could lose to the Bulls without O'Neal, they'd
already lost to the Bulls with O'Neal, 31/2 weeks before.</TE>
<TE>   They lost, 106-104, in overtime in Chicago, the same night O'Neal
shined Brad Miller's ear, and then they played the next three games
without him.</TE>
<TE>   These are the Lakers, and if they showed nothing else in the first
half of the regular season, it's that they have no regard for the
regular season.</TE>
<TE>   They lost to every last-place team in basketball, and a couple
that should be, and looked remarkably indifferent in those games.</TE>
<TE>   In that spirit, it seemed, the Lakers played with one foot in the
All-Star break. They scored 40 points in the first half, fewer than
they had scored at halftime in all but two games. The offense lacked
flow, and their shots lacked touch, and the only thing that saved
them was the Bulls, who play like that every night and therefore won
10 in 46 games before Wednesday's game.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson had predicted that the events of the last meeting--the
simultaneous fouls by Miller and Charles Oakley, the air punch by
O'Neal, and the chippy loss at United Center--would not carry over,
and even had a colorful description for it.</TE>
<TE>   "This game is another stop along the point," he said. "As they
say, the caravan stops, the dogs bark and the caravan moves on. It's
what happens."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson started Slava Medvedenko at power forward and Samaki
Walker at center. Medvedenko scored 11 points in 21 minutes but
occasionally appeared confused on defense. Walker had eight
first-quarter rebounds, in part because the Lakers missed 16 of 24
first-quarter shots.</TE>
<TE>   There were boos for Miller when he was introduced, but they were
L.A. boos, and sure not to hurt anyone's feelings.</TE>
<TE>   Miller smiled broadly and smartly chest-bumped Artest.</TE>
<TE>   At center court, where the players--who often share agents, a
union, and previous rosters--touch fists or hug, Miller was ignored.
He shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   More boos came for Miller when he touched the ball, which wasn't
that often. All of the attention should be a boon to Miller,
practically unheard of before his flagrant foul brought O'Neal's
wrath.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley, who has a sore right wrist, did not play. Tyson Chandler,
the rookie from Dominguez High, started his third consecutive game
and scored eight points and took nine rebounds.</TE>

<LD>Unable to work out a deal for Oakland Coach Jon Gruden, the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers are close to hiring Baltimore defensive coordinator Marvin
Lewis, according to Web site reports.</LD>
<LD>   CNNSI.com and ESPN.com, citing unidentified NFL sources, reported
Wednesday night that Buccaneer General Manager Rich McKay could offer
the job to Lewis as soon as today.</LD>
<LD>   "I expect to talk to Rich again in the morning, one way or
another," Lewis told CNNSI.com. "I haven't been told yet that I have
the job, but there are those who say I'm Rich's choice."</LD>
<TE>   Neither the Buccaneers nor Lewis' agent, Ray Anderson, return
telephone messages from Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers began discussions Monday with the Raiders about the
possibility of hiring Gruden, who has one year remaining on his
contract. McKay was believed to be offering draft picks, players,
cash of a combination of the three as compensation.</TE>

<TE>   The agent for Buffalo Bill cornerback Antoine Winfield said U.S.
News and World Report misquoted the player about accepting gifts from
an agent while at Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Schaffer of All Pro Sports said Wednesday that Winfield's
interview with the magazine involved how much money he lost under
former agent Dunyasha Mon Yetts.</TE>
<TE>   "He never told them at any time that he took money illegally
because it never happened," Schaffer said.</TE>
<TE>   Schaffer said Winfield would not comment on the report.</TE>
<TE>   "We stand by the quotes attributed to Mr. Winfield," U.S. News and
World Report spokesman Ken Frydman said.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine reported Winfield said he violated NCAA rules by
accepting cash, trips to the Bahamas and Las Vegas, suits valued at
$1,500 and Ohio State tickets that he resold for profit.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew it was wrong," the magazine quoted Winfield as saying.
"If you got caught, you would be in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Schaffer said Winfield did say he knew Yetts while in college and
that he went with Yetts to Las Vegas after the 1999 draft, but the
trip was legal because it was after Winfield had completed his
eligibility. Violations would have made Winfield ineligible for the
1998 season.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State Athletic Director Andy Geiger said he was not aware of
the allegations until he read the magazine. Geiger said he did not
know whether there would be any penalties if the allegations are
true.</TE>

<HD>Red Wings Clear Way Past Rangers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When an opposing team fails to capitalize on a scoring chance or
can't clear the puck, the Detroit Red Wings take full advantage.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Rangers were the latest team to find this out.</LD>
<LD>   Sergei Fedorov, Kris Draper and Brent Gilchrist scored, and the
Red Wings extended their home unbeaten streak to 13 games with a 3-1
victory over the Rangers on Wednesday night.</LD>
<TE>   "When you make mistakes against Detroit, they usually end up in
the back of your net," said New York's Theo Fleury, who had a heated
exchange with Chris Chelios in the final period.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Lindros returned after sitting out a game with a sprained
right knee and centered Fleury and Mike York on the F-L-Y line, which
had been broken up in the last month because of injury and
ineffectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Petr Nedved's power-play goal at 7:09 of the third period ended
Dominik Hasek's hopes for his 60th career shutout, but the struggling
Rangers, who have lost 10 of their last 15, still couldn't knock off
the NHL's top team.</TE>
<TE>   Hasek made 26 saves and New York's Mike Richter made 32.</TE>
<TE>   Draper scored on a goal-mouth scramble late in the first period
after Fedorov prevented the Rangers from clearing the puck. When New
York failed to get the puck out of its zone again late in the second,
Gilchrist capitalized with his first goal since Oct. 25, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Fleury and Chelios went at each other with shoves and words midway
through the final period. Fleury was so angered by what Chelios
shouted at him that Fleury is going to call the NHL to complain on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very, very personal," said Fleury, who declined to give
specifics. "There's no place in the game for that at all."</TE>
<TE>   Washington 2, Minnesota 1--Ulf Dahlen had a goal and an assist at
Washington, and the Capitals ended a four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Olaf Kolzig made 29 saves for the Capitals, who killed five power
plays, including one over the final 1:26.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 6, Columbus 4--Jody Hull scored for Ottawa on a tip-in past
Ron Tugnutt while falling down with 2:40 remaining at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa's Patrick Lalime stopped 24 shots and passed Tugnutt for
the most victories with the Senators. Lalime is 73-48-14; Tugnutt was
72-51-25 in his four seasons at Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 3, Florida 2--Kevin Weekes, making a rare start in place
of All-Star Nikolai Khabibulin, made 37 saves at Sunrise, Fla., and
won for the third time in 10 starts with the Lightning.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 2, Dallas 1--Denis Arkhipov scored and had an assist,
and Mike Dunham stopped 33 shots at Nashville, helping the Predators
split the season series with Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, Phoenix 2--Tony Amonte scored twice at Phoenix and the
Blackhawks ended a two-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   Despite having the second worst penalty-killing unit in the
league, the Blackhawks held the Coyotes scoreless on four power-play
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 2, Calgary 0--Evgeni Nabokov stopped the 27 shots he
faced at San Jose to post his sixth shutout this season. Matt Bradley
and Adam Graves each had a goal and an assist.</TE>

<HD>Eldredge Plans to Take New Move for Spin</HD>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Old skaters can learn new tricks.</LD>
<LD>   Somewhere between last month's U.S. figure skating championships
and the first official Olympic practices, 30-year-old U.S. men's
champion Todd Eldredge learned how to consistently land a quadruple
toe loop. That's an encouraging omen for the six-time U.S. champion
as he approaches his third Winter Games and chases the one great
performance he hasn't had on the Olympic stage.</LD>
<LD>   Eldredge, who has landed only two quads in competition, said
Wednesday he has been hitting about 75% to 80% of his quadruple jump
attempts in recent weeks, up from about 60%</LD>
<TE>   "The percentages have gotten a little bit better, so confidence
obviously gets a little bit better as percentages get better," he
said after landing a quad toe-double toe combination during his
practice at the Salt Lake Ice Center. "It's definitely different, so
I feel a little bit better about it."</TE>
<TE>   He tried a quad at the U.S. championships but changed it in
mid-air to a triple, a switch that didn't keep him from winning. But
Eldredge, who was 10th at the 1992 Albertville Games and fourth at
Nagano in 1998, knows landing a quad will be imperative here against
such strong jumpers as Alexei Yagudin and Evgeny Plushenko of Russia
and U.S. compatriot Tim Goebel.</TE>
<TE>   He's not sure, however, if he will try the quad combination in the
short program next Tuesday or in the long program, next Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's strategy, with the draw, and how the other guys do," he
said. "But it's always Plan A, to go ahead and do it [in the short
program]. If we need it, we'll do it. If we don't, we'll go to Plan B
and hopefully be in good position for the long program.</TE>
<TE>   "If I skate early and all of the guys that are kind of the top
guys skate after me, then it kind of depends on how I feel that day.
If I feel great, then I'll do it. If I feel a little off, it's stupid
to risk making a mistake. I'll go out there and just skate clean and
put some pressure on those guys to go out there and do theirs."</TE>
<TE>   Goebel, who was the 2001 U.S. champ but finished second to
Eldredge last month, also took advantage of Wednesday's practice at
the Olympic venue. The third U.S. entry, Michael Weiss, skipped the
session.</TE>
<TE>   Goebel, a first-time Olympian who trains in El Segundo, arrived
Monday after spending about 10 days training in Colorado Springs,
Colo., to get accustomed to altitude. He spent much of Tuesday
touring the athletes' village and was impressed with the facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe it," he said. "I was expecting a few little
buildings for the athletes and a dining hall. It's so much more than
that. There's so much. There's a coffee shop, which is great because
I'm a coffee person. I like coffee. And they have the Internet
everywhere, which is great, so I can do my e-mail. And they have a
game room with X Box and PlayStation 2 and a lot of cool stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen a lot of people from other U.S. sports and that's
always nice. It's such a rare opportunity I get to see anyone out of
skating."</TE>
<TE>   Too Good to Be True</TE>
<TE>   An asterisk should accompany the 31-0-0 record compiled by the
U.S. women's hockey team.</TE>
<TE>   Because they were too good for even traditional rival Canada to
have challenged them much, the U.S. women played some games against
boys' teams to keep their skills sharp. And although they lost some
of those games, none of the results was counted in the official
record.</TE>
<TE>   Their opponents were select teams, 16- or 17-year-old boys who are
all-stars in their districts. From those games, said U.S. defenseman
Angela Ruggiero, came the Olympic team's sternest tests.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys haven't quite yet filled out physically, but they're
very, very skilled," said Ruggiero, formerly of Simi Valley. "You've
got to make faster passes against them and they're going to try to
beat you wide, and as a defenseman, that's great practice. They
abided by our [no-checking] rules, but those games were still very,
very physical, and we have been pushed.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be nice if some of the [women's] teams in international
play were at a higher level, but progress comes in small steps, and
they're going to take those steps by playing us. We've sort of set
the standard."</TE>
<TE>   Ruggiero, 22, was among the youngest U.S. players in 1998, when
women's hockey made its Olympic debut and the U.S. defeated Canada in
the gold-medal game. However, when the U.S. begins play Tuesday
against Germany at the E Center, there will be five players younger
than she is. For Ruggiero, who has completed two years at Harvard and
will return this fall after a two-year absence, Salt Lake City will
be familiar territory.</TE>
<TE>   "This time around there are 14 veterans," she said. "We know what
to expect from travel, competitions, even going to the Olympics, we
know what the processing is like and the opening ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest difference is the support we've gotten from the fans
and media who are paying more attention because we won last time. We
had 10,000 fans in Detroit, which is my adopted hometown now, and it
was great. People were surprised last time around that women's hockey
exists. Now it's, 'Oh, the women's hockey team is coming to town. We
should go.' There's still a lot of growth to be had, but being on TV
during the Olympics will really help the sport."</TE>
<TE>   The Peter Principle</TE>
<TE>   Like any good negotiator, Peter Stastny asked for a lot and got a
little less than he wanted, but enough to come away happy.</TE>
<TE>   Stastny, the former NHL standout who has become general manager of
Slovakia's Olympic hockey team, knew NHL teams wouldn't grant his
request to release all their Slovak players for all three preliminary
round games at Salt Lake City. But his pleas got him a game or two
from Ziggy Palffy, Lubomir Visnovsky, Pavol Demitra, Jozef Stumpel,
Miroslav Satan and others, and three games from Lubos Bartecko.</TE>
<TE>   Although Slovakia might have only 14 players in uniform for some
games because it kept roster spots open for NHL stars, Stastny is
hopeful his team can advance to the main round against Canada, the
U.S., Sweden, Finland, Russia and the Czech Republic.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy with where we are," said Stastny, who got four players
for all three games as well as two minor leaguers, to supplement a
roster built around Slovaks playing at home and in Europe. "I believe
it is beneficial for everybody, for the young players, for the
Olympic Games and hockey players around the world, to have these
players play for Slovakia."</TE>
<TE>   Stastny played for Czechoslovakia at the 1980 Olympics and was
still active in 1994 when Slovakia became an independent nation. He
carried his nation's flag into the opening ceremony at Lillehammer,
beaming all the while.</TE>
<TE>   "We fought to be at the Olympics, to have a chance to
participate," he said, "and at the age I was [37], I appreciated
being there. I have wonderful memories."</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Canadian snowboarder Ross Rebagliati's hopes of watching the
Olympics apparently have gone up in smoke. Rebagliati won gold at
Nagano only to have it taken away after he tested positive for
marijuana. His triumph was reinstated after he argued he had been
exposed to second-hand smoke at a farewell party, and the
International Olympic Committee remembered marijuana wasn't on its
list of banned drugs. He planned to be a spectator at Salt Lake City,
but he told a Canadian TV network last week that U.S. immigration
officials won't let him into the country because he acknowledged
using marijuana in the past.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. men's hockey coach Herb Brooks said he's concerned about
injuries to two key players. Goalie Tom Barrasso has a groin pull and
defenseman Brian Rafalski has a bad knee. "NHL players today are
paying a price to participate in the Olympics," he said. "It's a
really condensed schedule and it's a difficult thing to go through."
... Playing for Slovakia Sunday against Latvia will send Stumpel on a
4,200-mile odyssey of four games in four days in Boston, Salt Lake
City, Denver and Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   The Salt Lake City Games will be the first in which instant video
replay will be available to figure skating judges. The system was
first used at the 1999 European championships and has been used at
subsequent world championships.</TE>

<HD>Bidding Process Has Long Perked Up IOC</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Salt Lake scandal was actually business as usual,
and early warning signs were ignored.</DH>
<SE>INSIDE THE IOC: Second in a series</SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The International Olympic Committee knew years before the Salt Lake
City bid scandal erupted that cities vying to host the Games were
showering IOC members with lavish excesses, according to the
confidential minutes of the IOC's ruling Executive Board.</LD>
<LD>   The board was briefed about such improprieties as far back as the
1980s. In 1991 it was told about irregularities involving airline
tickets, and other "abuses and misconduct." But those allegations
were dismissed as isolated incidents and without thorough inquiry:
Because they involved only a few IOC members, the minutes say,
reports of "generalized corruption could in no way be taken
seriously."</LD>
<LD>   The records suggest that if the IOC in general and then-President
Juan Antonio Samaranch in particular had acted more aggressively, the
committee might have avoided the worst corruption crisis in Olympic
history.</LD>
<TE>   It came to light in late 1998 amid disclosures that IOC members or
their relatives were courted with cash and gifts totaling more than
$1 million as part of Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002
Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   In the days after the scandal became public, and as the search for
blame sharpened in intensity, the minutes show that longtime IOC
member Marc Hodler of Switzerland told his colleagues that
culpability was clear: "It was not the bid cities who were
responsible. The IOC was responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Ten IOC members were either expelled or forced to resign. Six were
offered the chance to plead their case before an extraordinary
all-members session of the IOC in March 1999. The minutes of that
meeting reveal a disbelief that anything improper had occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Sudan's Gen. Zein El Abdin M.A. Abdel Gadir, for instance,
acknowledged that Salt Lake bidders had made payments purportedly for
tuition and living expenses, to his son, Zuhair, at Southern
Mississippi. A Salt Lake Organizing Committee ethics report said the
payments totaled $17,000.</TE>
<TE>   Gadir also convinced the Salt Lake Organizing Committee to send
$1,000 a month to his daughter, Zema, in London--although, as it
turned out, he didn't have a daughter at all, and Zema was an
abbreviation of sorts for his own name.</TE>
<TE>   Moments before being expelled, the general told his colleagues on
the IOC, "It never occurred to me that there was the slightest link
between this ... and the bidding of Salt Lake."</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, who, according to
court documents, received $320,000 in cash and gratuities in
connection with the Salt Lake bid, also defended his actions at the
1999 IOC session: "Such simple concepts as hospitality and courtesy
have been qualified as attempts to bribe, attempts to corrupt, values
such as friendship and solidarity have been defined as offenses;
dialogue between the various members of the IOC have been seen as
barter and trafficking."</TE>
<TE>   The scandal in Salt Lake was born of losing the 1998 Winter Games
to Nagano, Japan--and a determination to do what it took to win the
2002 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The two leaders of the Salt Lake City bid, Tom Welch and Dave
Johnson, were indicted on federal fraud and other charges in July
2000. A few months ago, a U.S. judge in Salt Lake City dismissed the
case. Prosecutors have appealed the dismissal; a ruling is months or
even years away.</TE>
<TE>   But as the Executive Board minutes show, the case offered a window
into the culture of excesses that came to dominate the bid-city
process in the aftermath of the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics,
which proved it was possible to make money by playing host to the
Games.</TE>
<TE>   The unprecedented profit from those Games--$232.5
million--increased interest in becoming a host city. L.A., for
instance, was the only city in the world that wanted the 1984
Olympics. Immediately after the L.A. Games, six cities sought the
1992 Games.</TE>
<TE>   Because the IOC allowed members to visit cities bidding for the
Games, bid teams often spent lavishly to entertain and impress in
hopes of cultivating personal relationships and winning votes.</TE>
<TE>   "Salt Lake City [bidders] had not needed to buy votes but had been
told by IOC members that they would have no chance to win if they did
not do so," Hodler would tell the Executive Board in 1998. "Cities
that had bid and won said nothing because they wanted to maintain a
good relationship with the IOC members. Cities that lost and hoped to
bid again also felt compelled to remain silent. But that knowledge
existed, and everybody who ran an Olympic bid knew about these
things."</TE>
<TE>   But, as the minutes show, corruption concerns were long-standing.</TE>
<TE>   Samaranch, reflecting on the problem at an Executive Board meeting
in Los Angeles in February 1982, said he was "concerned" about member
visits to Seoul and Nagoya, Japan, the two cities that had sought the
1988 Games. He called it an "unpleasant situation" but said he did
not feel "any action could now be taken."</TE>
<TE>   In his 1985 biography, Peter Ueberroth, who headed the L.A. Games,
alleged that bidders from Seoul gave two round-trip, first-class
airline tickets to each IOC member. "The tickets were easily redeemed
for cash; many were," Ueberroth wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1991, in Lausanne, Switzerland, Samaranch told the
Executive Board there had been reports of "cases of abuses by
individual members."</TE>
<TE>   He asked Hodler to elaborate about information gleaned when the
IOC asked cities who lost bids for the 1996 Summer Games to describe
"any incidents of misconduct" involving IOC members.</TE>
<TE>   "From the information given by the candidate cities," Hodler said,
"it had emerged that the biggest abuses had been on air tickets." He
did not elaborate, but added that the board had "combated this by
issuing all members' tickets through the [travel agent] at the IOC
headquarters."</TE>
<TE>   He also said, "Other abuses and misconduct had been fewer than
five individual instances, so that the recent press reports of
generalized corruption in the IOC could in no way be taken
seriously."</TE>
<TE>   The IOC did not appoint lawyers, accountants or detectives to
inquire further, although leaders have since publicly conceded they
should have. Reports of irregularities would ultimately surface in
connection with Atlanta's winning bid and from Nagano, Sydney,
Toronto and other locales. Those cities denied wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the IOC sometimes seemed more intent on protecting
itself, particularly from members of the press, according to the
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   At an Executive Board meeting in Acapulco in November 1992 after
the Barcelona Games, Samaranch said he "was not concerned by what had
happened so much as what could happen." He added that he was
"particularly worried by the possibility of IOC members in contact
with bid committees for the Games in 2000 being trapped in seemingly
compromising situations with the media."</TE>
<TE>   Six years later, at that December 1998 meeting, Samaranch told the
board that they "had to protect Salt Lake City, because they had to
protect the Games. But before they protected Salt Lake, they had to
protect the IOC, and that was the main task they had to face."</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, Ashwini Kumar of India said at a March 1999
meeting that it was "very criminal" for the press to "keep heaping
criticism" on Samaranch.</TE>
<TE>   But in fact it was Hodler who almost single-handedly propelled the
Salt Lake story into an international event when he abruptly asserted
in December 1998 that he had long been suspicious of corruption in
the IOC. He went on to detail for reporters what he described as the
systematic buying and selling of the Games.</TE>
<TE>   He cited a pattern of ethical malpractice in the bidding and
selection of the Games in Atlanta, Nagano, Sydney and Salt Lake City
and said he was going public in hopes of effecting radical reform.</TE>
<TE>   Behind closed doors, he told the ruling inner circle he "had felt
that some members of the Executive Board wanted to avoid scandal by
ignoring the fact that there were a larger number of corrupt members
within the IOC than had been thought."</TE>
<TE>   Jacques Rogge of Belgium, who last July succeeded Samaranch as IOC
president, reflected on the events leading up to the scandal while
addressing the opening of the IOC's 113th session this week here in
Salt Lake: "Inappropriate structures and human weaknesses on both
sides were the roots of an evil that would have come to light here or
somewhere else."</TE>

<HD>Bad to the Bones</HD>
<DH>Despite Dangers, Skeleton Birthplace Is Mecca</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. MORITZ, Switzerland</DL>
<LD>The birthplace of the sled-riding sport called skeleton is built from
scratch each winter, a mountain of snow pounded and molded into a
U-shaped tunnel of blue ice that turns 10 corners from here to the
neighboring village of Celerina.</LD>
<LD>   This object of love, devotion--and perhaps a little madness--is a
track about four feet wide and is among the world's most famous
winter-sports landmarks, even though it is relatively unknown in the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   The object is to navigate a specially designed sled, one used only
on the Cresta, as fast as possible over the length of the run. The
challenge: do it without injuring--or even killing--yourself.</LD>
<TE>   It's not easy. Four have died trying to conquer the Cresta; many
others have suffered broken bones and other injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Skeleton is making its first Olympic appearance in more than 50
years, and the two previous times it has been part of the Games, in
1928 and '48, it was held at the Cresta.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise the run, as it has for 115 years, has remained the
passion of a private, British-founded, British-run club.</TE>
<TE>   It attracts locals and foreigners, eccentrics and speed freaks,
daredevils and those simply and desperately hoping to summon enough
courage to prove they are man enough to rocket through the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Any man can ride, providing he pays a fee of 450 Swiss
francs--about $265--for five rides. However, joining the St. Moritz
Tobogganing Club, founded in the 1880s, is a rather exclusive
privilege. The club has about 1,260 members.</TE>
<TE>   Women are not permitted to join and, for all practical purposes,
not allowed to ride, either. One day a year, certain women--typically
the wives of members--get to go down the course.</TE>
<TE>   The best riders compare a run down Cresta with the sensation of an
intimate dance. "You want to ride it perfectly," said Nico Baracchi,
a Celerina local who is among the finest Cresta riders in history.
"Sometimes it hurts us, punishes us. But riding it is an art."</TE>
<TE>   Added Clifton Wrottesley, a British lord and first-rate Cresta
rider who will represent Ireland in the skeleton at the Salt Lake
Games, "It's a strange sort of mistress, the Cresta. You can be so
close to success and lose it completely and literally in a fraction
of a second with a slight lapse of judgment. Because at that speed
you can't account for it."</TE>
<TE>   The best Cresta riders reach top speeds of nearly 80 mph and
average speeds in excess of 50 mph as they hurtle face-first over the
length of the course.  This in a sled weighing about 110 pounds that
has no turning mechanism.  Riders turn by shifting their body weight
and break by grating the tops of spikes attached to the tips of
special boots--or trying to, at any rate. The total drop is 514 feet,
or about 50 stories. Heating or waxing the blades of the sled is
forbidden.</TE>
<TE>   Better riders start their run at Top, the beginning of the course
at a hill above St. Moritz. Another starting point is called
Junction, about a third of the way down.</TE>
<TE>   Wrottesley described the Cresta experience this way: "Imagine
going down a highway at about 90 mph. Open the car door. Stick your
face about an inch or two from the tarmac. Then try to imagine you're
on an ice track with little else around you other than your skin
suit, as it were, between you and the ice wall."</TE>
<TE>   The camaraderie experienced by Cresta riders has taken root in at
least one Southern California contingent--Team L.A., they call
themselves--that takes annual trips to challenge the run.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I go down it, it takes my breath away," said Reese L.
Milner II, a Los Angeles investment manager. "But I ask myself at the
starting gate: Why?"</TE>
<TE>   The answer to his question was provided by another Cresta rider,
Los Angeles Philharmonic President John F. Hotchkis, 70, who said,
"It's a hell of a rush. You go like a shot. It's huge speed."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Brittingham, 40, an investor and philanthropist and another
member of the Southern California contingent, said the calculus of
riding the Cresta has long been a club mantra: "In lay terms, if
exhilaration is worth the fright, you do it."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "For a lot of us younger riders ... it feels a lot like
boogie-boarding. There's nowhere to fall; you're already on the
ground. You're carving an edge. You're holding an edge. You're
gaining a lot of speed.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the obsessive pursuit of a high-risk leisure activity."</TE>
<TE>   To the untrained observer, Cresta riding and skeleton riding seem
identical. Indeed, the basics are the same: a face-first sled ride
down a hill.</TE>
<TE>   Skeleton riders, however, go without rakes on the tips of their
shoes. They also are professionals who race on an international
circuit over dedicated bobsled runs; Cresta riders are amateurs and
there is, after all, only the one Cresta.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, the banks of the Cresta are convex, which
is why riders shoot out of the corners and, all too frequently, get
hurt. During the 2000-01 season, there were 615 "falls" in 10,772
starts--an injury rate of about 6%. Hotchkis had two ribs broken in
one accident.</TE>
<TE>   An out-of-control rider is all but certain to go out of the course
at Shuttlecock, a hard left that is the most infamous corner of the
run. Those who fall are dubbed members of the "Shuttlecock
Club"--assuming they can move fingers and wrists well enough to put
on a Shuttlecock tie.</TE>
<TE>   The banks of the bob run are concave, leaving little chance,
despite the great speeds skeleton riders attain, of shooting out of
the run.</TE>
<TE>   "The Cresta is designed to scare you witless," Wrottesley said.
"Skeleton is more about refining technique to the nth degree,"
finding precisely the right line through the ice.</TE>
<TE>   The differences between Cresta riding and skeleton riding as it
will be seen at the Salt Lake Games are of prime importance to
retired Lt. Col. Digby Willoughby, the secretary of the St. Moritz
Tobogganing Club.</TE>
<TE>   A veteran of the British Army's famed Gurkha regiment, Willoughby
earned his Military Cross for service in Borneo. He chain-smokes Silk
Cut cigarettes, keeps bottles of Scotch on the window ledge by his
office desk and is given to freely speaking his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "We want nothing to do with the Olympics," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, there is great pride in the club in history--and the
fact the Games--and skeleton--were twice held on the Cresta.</TE>
<TE>   As Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, observed in the foreword
to a 1975 book on the Cresta, "It seems to be a characteristic of the
British to take a perfectly ordinary, even juvenile amusement and
convert it into a highly organized, competitive sport or recreation."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the club's British origins, Jennison Heaton of the U.S.
won the 1928 race. His brother John took silver.</TE>
<TE>   In 1948, Nino Bibbia of Italy won gold. John Heaton, then 39 years
old, again won silver. In both Games, a British rider took
third--David Northesk in '28; John Crammond in '48.</TE>
<TE>   Bibbia won more than 220 races on the Cresta. Billy Fiske, the
first American killed in World War II, won a slew of Cresta races in
the 1930s; he also won Olympic gold medals in bobsled in 1928 and
1932. Fiske's red Cresta sled hangs in the bar at the Kulm Hotel in
St. Moritz, a couple floors above the Cresta offices in the basement,
in what once was a hotel kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   The origins of the name "skeleton" are lost in all that history.
There are several theories, including one propounded in a
Willoughby-produced fact sheet that it was the club nickname for
toboggan. Another is that it is derived from the German word for
sled, schlitten.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 Games will mark the first women's skeleton event in
Olympic history.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why women aren't allowed down the Cresta, Willoughby
replied: "I love it when people come and ask me that question.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we don't want them here.... If the membership decides
they would like to have women riding, I would send them down today."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the run remains any man's adrenaline rush, and an
obsessive compulsion to many. "Bottom line," Brittingham said, "at
the end, you're extremely drenched in sweat, and all you've done is
lay down."</TE>

<HD>While Bruins Save Season, Trojans Handle Dejection</HD>

<LD>One silly decision at the end of the first half. One monumental shot
at the end of the second half. A game lost. A game won.</LD>
<LD>   One great spurt, one great comeback. Two great free throws, one
shot for the ages.</LD>
<LD>   A celebration of great relief and unabashed joy. A mourning of a
slippery rebound stolen away, a sickness in the gut from watching a
no-chance shot hit nothing but the net. Barely in time for one team,
much too early for the other.</LD>
<TE>   One game won and lost so many times. One game chewed over, fought
over, screamed over, clawed at, grabbed for, taken away, given back,
snatched away again.</TE>
<TE>   What happened at Pauley Pavilion Wednesday night will be
celebrated and cried over forever.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA beat USC, 67-65, when Billy Knight, an unassuming senior who
has always done what was asked and most of the time done more, hit a
21-foot three-point shot at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   It is the kind of shot from which grand winning streaks start,
from where NCAA tournament momentum begins, from which a team gains
its heart and its steel will.</TE>
<TE>   This shot came so typically out of UCLA chaos.</TE>
<TE>   An 11-point lead with 5:53 left had been squandered. USC had
gotten back into the game, then announced its intention of sweeping
the Bruins for the first time since 1992 when David Bluthenthal hit a
three-pointer with 38.4 seconds left, when the Trojan defense made it
impossible for Matt Barnes to get his good shot off, when Brandon
Granville, after missing one free throw to start a one-and-one,
gratefully accepted a second chance and made two free throws with
33.9 seconds left to give USC the lead, 65-64.</TE>
<TE>   And now the Bruins needed to score to save their pride and maybe
their season. There could be no explaining away a lackluster first
half, when USC wanted every loose ball, took every second chance,
made almost all the big plays and built a nine-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   There certainly couldn't have been a rationalization of losing
that 11-point lead at home.</TE>
<TE>   So the Bruins had the ball and their chance and their messy,
crazy, unplanned, unscripted offense to save it. After lots of
directionless passing and with the clock ticking faster and faster it
seemed, UCLA freshman point guard Cedric Bozeman, who is offensively
hindered by a shaky shot and a lack of confidence, was forced into
throwing up an off-balance leaner which had no chance for anything
except to be rebounded.</TE>
<TE>   Which Dan Gadzuric did. And he shot it too, badly, and off balance
and the ball fell partly into the hands of Granville, who was lying
on the floor. Gadzuric leaned over to pick the ball up. He got the
ball and was surrounded by Trojans. So Gadzuric heaved the ball to
Knight who was as alone as a man with the need to make a last-second
three-pointer could ever hope to be.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the shot was easy. The lump in his throat had to be huge.
The basket must have seemed miles away. But Knight didn't hesitate.
He just shot. He didn't think. He just shot. He caught, he shot, he
saved a game, maybe he saved a season.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA Coach Steve Lavin said his team survived his own bad
coaching. He said he didn't use timeouts very well when USC was
overcoming the 11-point UCLA lead. He took the blame for the way UCLA
started the game. The Bruins seemed listless and lazy. This game
which they needed more than USC was grabbed at more ferociously by
the Trojans. Sam Clancy scored 17 points in the first half because he
fought harder for every inch of shooting room, for every ball, for
space, for breath.</TE>
<TE>   An unknown senior named Gennaro Busterna, who had scored 10 points
in his USC career, all this year in garbage time against Arizona, was
making three pointers, making steals, hustling as if he were a ringer
at a pool hall. Who was this guy?</TE>
<TE>   So the Trojans had a 39-30 lead and the ball and five seconds left
in the first half. Granville let the inbounds pass roll and roll. His
idea was good, to conserve time and get a better shot. His attention
was bad. He ignored Knight coming up, closer and closer to the ball.
Until it was too late and Knight went after the ball with the diving
and desperate Granville, who lost the ball out of bounds. Barnes got
an inbound pass and shot immediately and perfectly, the ball dropping
neatly through the net as time ran out.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins may have been behind, 39-33, but they danced off the
court. That steal and shot seemed a slap in the faces of the Bruins.
They had seemed too cool to act scared, too haughty to act needy for
this game. After Barnes shot, they burst onto the court to start the
second half.</TE>
<TE>   They played a masterly matchup zone. They cut off USC dribble
penetration. They sealed off the lane. Clancy only got seven more
points.</TE>
<TE>   "My team didn't always play well in the second half," Lavin said,
"but they played hard."</TE>
<TE>   From games such as this, amazing things can follow.</TE>
<TE>   We know what to expect from the Trojans. They will play full speed
all the time. They will not be discouraged. They will not let
themselves be conquered by the shock of this loss. We don't know what
to expect of the Bruins. Not yet.</TE>

<HD>Next Chapter for Booker Will Be at Florida State</HD>
<DH>Southland: St. Bonaventure running back has late change of
heart, chooses Seminoles over Notre Dame.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SONDHEIMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a suspense-filled, nationally televised news conference, running
back Lorenzo Booker of Ventura St. Bonaventure High turned a day of
indecision into a celebration for Coach Bobby Bowden and Florida
State.</LD>
<LD>   Booker, who holds state records for yards rushing (8,502) and
touchdowns (137) in his career, made an agonizing announcement
Wednesday afternoon at an Oxnard restaurant at the end of a hectic
day in which he decided Notre Dame would be his college choice, only
to change his mind.</LD>
<LD>   He said he made up his mind to sign with Notre Dame on Tuesday
night and woke up Wednesday expecting to sign a letter of intent with
the Fighting Irish.</LD>
<TE>   Minutes before his announcement, Booker was on his cell phone
speaking with Florida State recruiting coordinator John Lilly.</TE>
<TE>   Even after revealing his decision to sign with Florida State,
Booker looked dazed instead of relieved.</TE>
<TE>   Booker gave serious consideration to Notre Dame because it was
closer for his mother to travel and he was impressed with new Coach
Tyrone Willingham. But he has been a Florida State fan since
childhood and repeatedly watches the Seminoles' 2000 Sugar Bowl
victory over Virginia Tech on video.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't see myself in any other uniform," he said. "I knew I
wanted to go to [Florida State] from the start. It wasn't easy
changing my mind. I got war chant songs on my CD. Every time I start
a season in video games, I'm Florida State."</TE>
<TE>   Bowden visited the Booker home in Hueneme last week and made a
lasting impression.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame didn't come up empty on top Southern California
recruits. The Fighting Irish beat out UCLA and Washington for
All-American receiver Rhema McKnight of La Palma Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   McKnight said he made the decision Tuesday night, citing Notre
Dame's academic environment as the deciding factor.</TE>
<TE>   "Academics and athletics go hand in hand," said McKnight, who
plans to major in psychology. "The networking at Notre Dame is great.
You could graduate and go to South Dakota and find a job."</TE>
<TE>   McKnight also visited Florida and Oregon. He said the Gators were
front-runners until Coach Steve Spurrier suddenly resigned Jan. 4.</TE>
<TE>   McKnight, who played quarterback, running back, wide receiver and
defensive back last season, isn't sure what position he'll play at
Notre Dame, but he's confident he'll contribute early.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I can go there and do anything," he said. "Not to be cocky
or anything, but I feel like I can come out and make an impact right
away, no matter where I'm playing."</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Poly, the Southern Section Division I champion, had 10
players sign Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Hershel Dennis, Winston Justice, Darnell Bing and Manuel
Wright signing with USC and Marcedes Lewis choosing UCLA, defensive
back Chris Davis signed with New Mexico State, tailback Rory
Carrington and linebacker Pago Togafau signed with Idaho State, and
tailback John Henry Williams and defensive tackle Ernesto Villasenor
signed with Adams State, a Division II school in Alamosa, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Compton Centennial's Darius Sanders signed with Oregon to play
football and basketball. Sanders, a 6-foot-6 center who averages 16
points and 10 rebounds for the Apaches, starred as a defensive end on
the Lynwood football team in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor City Narbonne, the City Section Invitational champion, was
expected to have seven players sign this week.</TE>
<TE>   One player who did not sign was receiver Denny Flanagan of
Huntington Beach Edison. He committed to San Diego State last week
only to learn the Aztecs no longer had a scholarship available. Now
Hawaii has made an offer.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a hot commodity for somebody who didn't sign," Edison Coach
Dave White said. "It's going to work out."</TE>
<TE>   Ben Olson of Thousand Oaks, considered among the top quarterbacks
in the nation, signed with Brigham Young.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Frederick Collins, who rushed for 2,209 yards and led
La Quinta to consecutive Division IX titles, signed with San Diego
State.</TE>

<HD>Table Is Full for Toledo</HD>
<DH>UCLA: Despite poor finish on field, Bruins land all of
their commitments, including Long Beach Poly's Lewis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like a hungry man in a buffet line, UCLA piled its plate high with
recruits Wednesday and was only mildly chagrined at what it couldn't
grab.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins received letters of intent from each of the 24 high
school seniors who had made commitments. UCLA also signed two junior
college transfers in December, making this recruiting class equal in
size to the vaunted 1998 class ranked No. 1 in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   "Our coaches really did an outstanding job," Coach Bob Toledo
said. "We filled all of our needs. It's a balanced class--we are
bringing in players at all positions. You never get everybody you
recruit, nobody in the country does, but we earmarked kids and got
most of them."</LD>
<TE>   UCLA losing four of five games after a 6-0 start did not prompt
any players who made commitments to back out.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys were getting hit on pretty good [by other schools],"
Toledo said. "But we never had anybody waver."</TE>
<TE>   Several newcomers will have an opportunity to play next fall,
including tight end Marcedes Lewis of Long Beach Poly, the Southland
high school with the most prospects. Four of Lewis' teammates chose
USC.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, I couldn't care less [where they go]," Lewis said.
"I chose what was good for me. We'll always be friends, I'm not going
to let our schools tear us apart. They did what was best for them, I
did what was best of me."</TE>
<TE>   Although senior Mike Seidman and redshirt freshman Keith Carter
return at tight end, Lewis (6 feet 6, 240 pounds) is athletic enough
to play wide receiver at times. He also plans to play basketball for
the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion we got the best Long Beach Poly player," Toledo
said. "We got a real plum in Marcedes Lewis. He's the one we went
after the hardest and I'm really excited to have him in the program."</TE>
<TE>   Incoming safeties Eric McNeal of Gardena Serra and Jarrad Page of
San Leandro and Mike Nixon of Phoenix Sunnyslope will have an
opportunity to play right away because starting safeties Marques
Anderson and Jason Stephens were seniors. If one or more prove
capable, sophomore Matt Ware might not move from cornerback to safety
as planned.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo believes Justin London of Northside High in Roanoke, Va.,
and junior college transfer Patrick Pierre-Louis of Glendale might
shore up linebacker, another position of need because of the
departure of All-American Robert Thomas and four-year starter Ryan
Nece.</TE>
<TE>   "Linebacker is a position we can use some people and London is a
physical, mature guy who could play in the middle or over the tight
end," Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback also can be considered a position of need, although
senior Cory Paus ranks among the top five in most of UCLA's career
passing categories.</TE>
<TE>   Paus' performance mirrored that of the team--a strong start and a
dismal finish--and Toledo said incoming freshmen Matt Moore of Hart
and Drew Olson of Piedmont will be examined closely along with
redshirt freshman John Sciarra.</TE>

<HD>Busterna's Best Is Not Enough</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Bluthenthal, Sam Clancy and Brandon Granville exchanged knowing
glances and pregame chest bumps during warmups Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   The USC senior starters knew it was their last chance at pulling
out a win at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion, where the Trojans had not won
since 1993.</LD>
<LD>   They also knew that they had a shot at pulling off a season sweep
of the Bruins for the first time since 1992.</LD>
<TE>   But they didn't know that the Trojans' forgotten fourth senior,
seldom-used Gennaro Busterna, would play a major part in nearly
leading USC to victory.</TE>
<TE>   Busterna, who had not scored a point in his USC career until going
for 10 in six minutes of USC's 17-point loss at Arizona on Jan. 17,
had a career-high 12 points in the Trojans' 67-65 last-second loss to
UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Busterna, a junior college transfer from McCook College in
Nebraska, camped out in the left corner all night and had three
three-pointers on four of nine shooting from the field, three of
eight from beyond the three-point stripe, in a career-high 21
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt great, pretty pumped," Busterna said. "They told me to
just play my game and that's what I did.</TE>
<TE>   "I can always go back and say it would have been better if we had
won. But it hurts, it hurts real bad."</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Henry Bibby inserted Busterna when UCLA packed it in
down low with a 2-3 zone defense.</TE>
<TE>   "He averaged 25 points in junior college so we've always known he
can score," Bibby said.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to open up the zone with some outside shooters and he's
one of our best outside shooters."</TE>
<TE>   USC, which is 3-4 in Pacific 10 Conference play since opening up
5-0, is growing weary of losing games on last-second, desperation
three-point baskets.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans were beaten by Pepperdine, 78-77, on Dec. 6 at the
Forum when Craig Lewis banked in a shot and California's Shantay
Legans' 25-footer on Jan. 24 at the Sports Arena beat USC in
overtime, 92-91.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA guard Billy Knight's 21-footer from the right wing with time
expiring, after a nasty scrum under the basket, was the third shot
through the Trojans' collective hearts.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was going in, with our luck," USC freshman guard
Errick Craven said, "It was terrible.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody just doesn't like SC."</TE>
<TE>   Said Clancy, who had his eighth consecutive double-double with 24
points and 14 rebounds in a game-high 40 minutes: "There was only one
guy open on the court [Knight] and he got it."</TE>
<TE>   Henry Bibby said he had a "great look" at Knight's game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   "It's discouraging to lose but it's encouraging to see the  way
your kids were hanging in there."</TE>

<LD>Somewhere in the early hours of Wednesday morning, in the last gasp
of a long recruiting process, Pete Carroll burst into an office where
several of his assistants were huddled.</LD>
<LD>   The USC coach had heard that three of his top high school
prospects appeared headed in the same direction--elsewhere. The
Trojans had been pursuing the two best running backs in the state,
Lorenzo Booker and Hershel Dennis, and faced the possibility of
losing both. Offensive lineman Winston Justice was reportedly leaning
toward UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   An agitated Carroll looked at his staff and said: "Isn't this
fun?"</LD>
<TE>   In the following hours, through a flurry of last-minute phone
calls and a mostly sleepless night for Carroll, USC went from
disappointment to celebration by landing a group of recruits ranked
in the top 10 by several national recruiting publications.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans addressed their sagging ground game by winning over
Dennis and Justice, both from Long Beach Poly High, as well as Kyle
Williams, a tackle from Dallas, and Brandon Hancock, a massive
fullback from Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   The defense got two other Poly standouts, defensive back Darnell
Bing and defensive lineman Manuel Wright, and Justin Wyatt, a highly
rated defensive back from Compton Dominguez.</TE>
<TE>   "A remarkable effort," said Allen Wallace, publisher of SuperPrep
magazine, who ranked the recruits at No. 8 in the nation. "USC was on
the precipice of losing the most significant parts of this class but
the staff basically made it happen."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans did it with their coach's trademark optimism and
energy. On Tuesday night, amid reports that Dennis had decided on
Oregon, Carroll and assistant Kennedy Pola called the Poly running
back to make one more pitch. It got Dennis thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "I just had a good feeling about what they were telling me," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The way the system works, players can change their minds until
they fax a letter of intent to their chosen school. Coaches work the
phones until the last minute, talking to players, their parents,
aunts and uncles, anyone who will listen.</TE>
<TE>   So USC continued to call on Dennis, Justice and Booker, who was
reportedly headed for Notre Dame. Carroll ended up sleeping on the
couch in his office.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't sleep long. The fax machine started up at 4 a.m.
Wednesday with an early letter of intent from Mike Williams, a
6-foot-5 receiver from Tampa. Later came a commitment from Justice.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't promise anything to me," the 305-pound tackle said.
"And I kind of liked that."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't hurt that his Poly teammate was working on him.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and Winston were arguing," Wright said. "He was talking about
UCLA and I was talking about USC."</TE>
<TE>   There was still the matter of Booker and Dennis. As the day wore
on, USC coaches became convinced they would not get Booker. Carroll
called Dennis again and subtly told him as much.</TE>
<TE>   To that point, Carroll had not overtly mentioned one prospect to
the other. Still, he suspected two high-caliber backs would not
commit to the same school. "Anyone who expected us to get Hershel
Dennis and Lorenzo Booker in the same year was not thinking clearly,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it helped that Booker was headed elsewhere--he eventually
committed to Florida State. By 11 a.m., Dennis committed and the
Trojans had two of their three jewels. "We ended the day with a whoop
and a holler," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to addressing the running game, USC might have found a
punter, Tom Malone of Lake Elsinore, to replace the graduating Mike
MacGillivray. The secondary, which lost three starters, could get
help from Mike Ross, a St. Petersburg, Fla., recruit, and Ronald
Nunn, a transfer from San Francisco City College. And 245-pound Oscar
Lua, from Indio, is expected to push for playing time at linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   The celebrations come with disclaimers, however. The Trojans
remain thin at cornerback. And among the four Poly prospects, only
Justice has qualified academically.</TE>
<TE>   Wright and Bing recently retook the SAT and await their scores.
Dennis will take the test in March.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Wallace believes the Trojans took a step in the right
direction by attracting so many highly regarded prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're trying to recruit national-caliber athletes to a
program that has fallen on hard times, it's difficult," he said.
"This team was really on the hot seat."</TE>

<HD>Knight Comes to Rescue</HD>
<DH>College basketball: After a wild scramble, Bruin senior
makes three-pointer at the buzzer as UCLA avoids a sweep by USC,
67-65.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The best rivalries involve more than banal student chants that insult
the opposition. They overflow with a sense of entitlement. They hold
sacred a sense of history. They reveal unlikely heroes.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA and USC, teams stocked with veterans, understand this
profoundly.</LD>
<LD>   No wonder for 39 minutes and 59 seconds brains gave way to brawn,
finesse to muscle. It was sweaty and sloppy, with bad passes,
wrestling matches and mad scrambles.</LD>
<TE>   But at the end, the softest, silkiest touch determined the
outcome, a three-point shot off the left hand of Billy Knight,
caressing the bottom of the net, giving the Bruins a 67-65 victory
and setting off bedlam among the 12,810 Wednesday night at Pauley
Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA (16-6, 8-4 in Pacific 10 Conference play) remained in the
race for the title, pulling even with USC, which has the same record
and, amazingly, has scored two fewer points than the Bruins this
season--the margin of victory in this game.</TE>
<TE>   The players who had the most to lose--the seniors who knew this
probably was their last rivalry game--stepped up down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Seniors Sam Clancy, Brandon Granville and David Bluthenthal
sparked the Trojans to a late rally that erased an 11-point deficit
in the last six minutes. A three-point basket by Bluthenthal drew USC
within one and Granville made two free throws with 33.9 seconds to
play for a 65-64 lead.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA whittled down the clock, but freshman guard Cedric Bozeman
drove through the key and threw up a five-foot shot in traffic that
missed badly. Dan Gadzuric--another senior--grabbed the rebound,
missed a putback, grabbed the ball again and made a bounce pass to
Knight, who capped a 14-point game with the winner.</TE>
<TE>   "I caught the pass and it was slow motion, like 'The Matrix,'"
Knight said.</TE>
<TE>   And until the final shot, the game was nearly as violent. Clancy,
who recorded his eighth consecutive double-double with 24 points and
14 rebounds, and UCLA's Jason Kapono, who had 26 points and eight
rebounds, were the only hot shooters most of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone else seemed more intent on taking charges, throwing
elbows, even throwing the ball into the back of a head, as Bruin Matt
Barnes did to Trojan Errick Craven to save possession while falling
out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   "They really punked us last time we played," Barnes said,
recalling USC's 81-77 victory a month ago at the Forum. "We took that
to heart and weren't going to let it happen again."</TE>
<TE>   It took awhile for the Bruins to get going.</TE>
<TE>   "In the first half we came out scared and tentative," Coach Steve
Lavin said. "In the second half we really competed, but then we lost
our head and ran around without purpose."</TE>
<TE>   The first half ended the way the game did. Just when the fans
began to rain boos on the sloppy Bruins for falling behind by nine,
Knight and Barnes turned the momentum in the last three seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, who had missed a frantic three-point shot seconds earlier,
charged Granville, who was rolling the ball up the floor to keep the
clock from starting, and the ball ended up out of bounds off the
Trojan guard. Barnes took the inbound pass and fired in a three at
the buzzer to pull UCLA within 39-33.</TE>
<TE>   The distance on the scoreboard was due in part to four
long-distance shots from the left corner by three Trojans.
Seldom-used Gennaro Busterna made two of them and also made a layup
off a steal.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest factor was Clancy, who scored the first 10 Trojan
points and had 17 points and 10 rebounds in the half. Most of his
shots came inside five feet and three baskets came on putbacks.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA tied the score at 40 less than three minutes into the second
half, held USC to one field in the first 7:40 and led, 61-50, on a
seven-point streak by Kapono. But the Bruins did not make another
field goal until Knight's winner and USC pulled ahead when Granville
smartly drew several fouls away from the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "We just came out stagnant to start the second half," Clancy said.
"Once I started to assert myself, that led to [the comeback]."</TE>
<TE>   And finally to the incredible finish. For UCLA, a loss would have
been another in a string of midseason disappointments for a veteran
team that for the fifth year in a row lost to Stanford at home and to
Arizona on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so happy for the seniors to get this win in their last game
against USC in such dramatic fashion," Lavin said. "It meant a lot to
them."</TE>

<LD>Tracy Gahan scored 19 points to lead No. 12 Iowa State--subjected to
an emergency landing en route to Lawrence, Kan.--to a 75-50 Big 12
Conference victory Wednesday against Kansas.</LD>
<LD>   The Cyclones' chartered plane developed a problem with its landing
gear, but landed without incident in Des Moines only minutes after
leaving Ames. The team then traveled 230 miles by bus.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a little unnerving," Coach Bill Fennelly said. "We did not
find out until after we landed that it was a landing gear problem.
It's probably good we didn't know about it ahead of time."</LD>
<TE>   The Cyclones improved to 18-5 and 5-5. Kansas fell to 5-19 and
0-11.</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Connecticut 92, Seton Hall 40--Asjha Jones scored 17 points
at Storrs, Conn., as the Huskies (25-0, 12-0 in Big East) routed the
Pirates (11-12, 3-8).</TE>
<TE>   No. 13 Colorado 95, Nebraska 60--Jenny Roulier scored 17 points as
the Buffaloes (18-6, 8-3 in Big 12) routed the Cornhuskers (12-11,
2-8) at Boulder, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   No. 15 Texas Tech 61, No. 17 Texas 49--Jia Perkins scored 16
points at Lubbock, Texas, as the Red Raiders (14-7, 6-5 in Big 12)
handed the Longhorns (14-7, 6-5) their fourth loss in a row.</TE>
<TE>   No. 24 North Carolina 49, Villanova 45--Coretta Brown had 15
points at Chapel Hill, N.C., to lift the Tar Heels (18-6).</TE>

<LD>Women's college basketball is making gains at the box office.</LD>
<LD>   Perennial powers Connecticut and Tennessee are blessed with loyal
followings; witness the NCAA-record 24,611 fans attending their
midseason clash in Tennessee last month. But, according to NCAA
figures, women's attendance has been increasing slowly but steadily
in other areas.</LD>
<LD>   For the 2000-01 season, 6,519,667 fans (an average of 1,524)
attended women's college basketball games, including NCAA tournament
games. Both are NCAA records and represent a 2.5% increase from the
1999-2000 season.</LD>
<TE>   Fans have been turning up in large numbers this season at such
places as Iowa State, New Mexico, Texas Tech, South Carolina and
Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere but here.</TE>
<TE>   How depressing it must be for UCLA, USC, Pepperdine, Long Beach,
Loyola Marymount and other Southland teams to wonder if there are
more people watching YWCA pickup games.</TE>
<TE>   And when it comes to recruiting, how do you tell an impressionable
17-year-old how great it will be at your place when all she has to do
is turn on the TV and see 15,000 screaming fans at Vanderbilt or
Louisiana Tech.</TE>
<TE>   Not even a winning team will guarantee support. But something
needs to change.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to consider a tournament for the area teams.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Wooden Classic, it would be a one-day, one-game-a-piece
format. It would need UCLA or USC--and preferably both--to anchor the
event. Just make sure they don't play each other.</TE>
<TE>   For example, pit UCLA against Pepperdine and USC against Long
Beach State in a one-day doubleheader. Schedule the event at a
neutral site such as the Forum. If it becomes an annual event, the
Bruin and Trojan opponents would rotate.</TE>
<TE>   The event would need a corporate sponsor to help defray costs, and
an outside organization to put on the event, so it isn't the
participants' responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   It would have to be played in late November or early December to
avoid bumping into conference play. And it wouldn't hurt to tie it to
a holiday weekend, like Thanksgiving or Veterans Day, to make it
available to families and high school players. It would be important
to attract television coverage, but not necessarily in the first
year.</TE>
<TE>   By keeping it local, teams cut down on hotels, meals and other
costs they would otherwise face on the road.</TE>
<TE>   The main reason for the tournament is to spark more interest in
the local teams, to make basketball fans aware that women can play
the game and play it well.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA and USC, of course, would be the reluctant dragons. They
would argue they have little to gain and everything to lose,
especially in the RPI rankings that are influential toward getting
NCAA tournament berths. Or that they already have one or two of the
other teams on their schedules.</TE>
<TE>   To that, I say the Bruins and Trojans are already losing a lot, in
keeping area talent at home and building a respective fan base. Those
empty seats speak louder than your protests.</TE>
<TE>   Local women's college basketball needs an event that celebrates
the sport. A one-day event would create more attention than any
regular-season game.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of running a tournament varies. But after speaking with
several athletic directors who have run holiday tournaments, $20,000
was a legitimate figure for expenses. That is tip money in a
corporate budget, even during a recession.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike football, basketball schedules are not locked up years in
advance. It would not take long to hammer out an agreeable date.
Someone has to take the first step.</TE>

<HD>Now Percival Feels Relief</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jim Barrero</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Troy Percival said in October that he wanted to pitch for a team that
wanted to win.</LD>
<LD>   At the time, he never thought it would be the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   But after signing a two-year, $16-million contract extension to
stay with the club through 2004, the 32-year-old right-handed
reliever seems to have done a 180-degree turn in his attitude toward
the organization.</LD>
<TE>   It was obvious at an Angel media luncheon Wednesday that Percival
hasn't been this excited for spring training in quite some time.</TE>
<TE>   "Not since I was a first-year guy coming in hoping to make a
team," said Percival, who is entering his eighth season with the
Angels after being drafted in 1990. "Without question, you can feel
the difference. In the past, you'd come in always hoping that
something might happen.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, it's not about hoping anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Like many in the Angel organization, Percival is excited about the
team's off-season acquisitions of pitchers Dennis Cook, Aaron Sele
and Kevin Appier along with Brad Fullmer, a first baseman and
designated hitter.</TE>
<TE>   But the moves weren't something Percival really expected. He said
he would have given it "a 5% chance" at the end of last season during
a time he expressed frustration about the team leaking details of
confidential contract talks to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Now, everything seemingly has changed.</TE>
<TE>   "This level of commitment by Disney is beyond anything I've
experienced as an Angel," Percival said. "When it comes to making a
move later on, it looks like [Angel General Manager] Bill [Stoneman]
will have the freedom to put it over the top."</TE>
<TE>   Percival also was pleased that the team made him feel appreciated
for signing the extension.</TE>
<TE>   "They've shown me a lot of respect and made me feel like they
really wanted me to be here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Did it also help that Tony Tavares, who was accused of leaking the
contract details, resigned as Angel president on Jan. 4?</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, that played somewhat of a role," Percival said.</TE>
<TE>   But beyond that, Percival is excited to be surrounded by a
talented starting rotation and to have bullpen depth that probably
will limit the number of appearances he'll have to make of more than
one inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not throw three innings in relief now," Percival joked
with Manager Mike Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia joked back that he couldn't make any promises, but he
also knows that the pitching depth finally could carry the team where
it wants to go.</TE>
<TE>   "This is by far the best rotation we're going to have in our three
years here," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   A key addition is Sele, a right-hander who was 15-5 last season
for Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm as excited as everybody else is," Sele said. "You can look at
any team in this division and make the argument that anyone can win.
I think our chances are as good as anybody."</TE>

<LD>The Dodgers were on the verge of a deal to sign Kazuhisa Ishii after
a daylong negotiating session that broke the stalemate between the
team and the highly touted Japanese left-hander.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers bumped their three-year, $8-million offer up to four
years and more than $12 million, and agent Joe Urbon came off his
demands for a package that would guarantee Ishii at least $17
million.</LD>
<LD>   Urbon, Dodger General Manager Dan Evans and assistant GM Kim Ng
worked late into Wednesday evening in an attempt to resolve several
contractual issues, including how an option year and a no-trade
clause would be structured and the amount of the contract that would
be deferred.</LD>
<TE>   Ishii, who traveled from Tokyo to Los Angeles Tuesday, will
undergo an extensive physical exam today, and Urbon and Dodger
executives will attempt to hammer out the final details of the
contract. Barring any problems with the medical tests, Ishii would be
ready to sign a contract in time to beat a Friday 9 p.m. deadline to
come to terms with the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is one major issue and one minor issue that need to be
resolved," Urbon said, "but we're close to a deal."</TE>
<TE>   If a deal is consummated, the Dodgers will pay the Yakult Swallows
$11.26 million.</TE>

<HD>Miles Making a Mark With Defensive Play</HD>

<DL>BIRMINGHAM, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Everyone, it seems, has seen Darius Miles' handiwork with the
basketball this season. Even New York hoop scribes, among the more
cynical human beings on the face of the planet, enjoyed Miles'
fourth-quarter dash to the hoop and dunk in the Clippers' victory
Tuesday against the Knicks.</LD>
<LD>   There is more to Miles' game, however. His standout defensive play
against Latrell Sprewell of the Knicks helped rally the Clippers from
an 18-point second-half deficit to win, 112-110.</LD>
<LD>   Asked if he believed Miles, only 20, would some day be selected to
the NBA's all-defensive team, Clipper guard Quentin Richardson said,
"It's a given. He's one of those guys who will make it year in and
year out. He's long and wiry and has really good instincts. [Strong
defense from Miles] is nothing new to me. That's what 'D' does. He
wants to guard the best players. He told me to guard Clarence
Weatherspoon and said he would guard Sprewell."</LD>
<TE>   In addition to making four of five shots and five of six free
throws (for 13 points), Miles took six rebounds, had four assists and
two blocks in 32 minutes Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Darius enjoys it," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said of
Miles' devotion to defense. "The only guys who seem to hurt him are
the guys who really pound it inside against him. Guarding guys like
Antoine Walker [of Boston] are tough assignments for anyone."</TE>

<DH>Bazemore Thinks the Time Has Come for Him to End the Funny
Car Domination of 11-Time Champion</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new era in drag racing will unfold this week at the Pomona Raceway
when Powerade will replace Winston as the title sponsor of the
National Hot Rod Assn. season. It will be the first time in 28 years
that the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco brand will not be involved in drag
racing.</LD>
<LD>   Funny car driver Whit Bazemore is hoping that another era ends
this year--the domination of the irrepressible John Force as funny
car champion. Force has won 11 championships, the last nine in
succession.</LD>
<LD>   "He's got to lose sometime, so it might as well be this year, and
it might as well be me who does it," Bazemore said as he prepared his
Lee Beard-tuned Matco Tools Pontiac Firebird funny car for today's
first round of eliminations in the 42nd K&amp;N Filters Winternationals.
Pro time trials start at 1:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   "The way we're going at it, we're looking at this first race as an
extension of last year. We had the best record, even better than
Force, over the last half of 2001, so we hope to carry our momentum
on to the strip at Pomona."</TE>
<TE>   After car owner Don Schumacher put together a new team last year
with two veterans, Beard running the team and Bazemore running the
car, it took about half a year for the new group to jell. Things all
came together about the time the series reached Pomona for the 50th
anniversary meet last July.</TE>
<TE>   Bazemore qualified No. 1 and lost to Force in the finals. Over the
next 11 races, Bazemore was top qualifier nine times, won three times
and, most significantly, outscored Force, 1,069-967, to finish second
in final point standings. He also set the three fastest speeds in
funny car history--325.29 mph at Indianapolis, 325.45 at Chicago and
325.37 at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   When Force received his champion's award, Bazemore said, "Enjoy
it, it will be your last."</TE>
<TE>   "I was laughing when I said it, but down deep I'd like to think
that I was right," the 38-year-old Indianapolis driver said. "I
wasn't laughing, though, when I said I had some unfinished business
to attend to at Pomona. We should have won that final last November,
but we let it slip away from us."</TE>
<TE>   Bazemore had a remarkable series of eight consecutive elapsed time
runs in the 4.70s. He qualified at 4.741, ran 4.759 to beat Bob
Gilbertson, 4.743 to beat Johnny Gray and set a track record 4.736 in
sidelining Gary Densham in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   In the finals, against Del Worsham, Bazemore ran 4.757 but lost
because he red-lighted at the start and was disqualified.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have the same car at Pomona, so we think we'll be ready. I
drove my first pro fuel race there in 1988 and over the years I've
become more and more impressed with its tradition, so I enjoy more
and more coming each year."</TE>
<TE>   In that first race in 1988, the rookie Bazemore failed to qualify.</TE>
<TE>   "The fastest I'd been before that was about 160 or 170 [mph] in an
alcohol [powered] car on a eighth-mile track and there I was in a car
capable of doing 260 to 270 in a quarter-mile. I had trouble getting
it down the track. I wasn't as brave as I am now. It was terribly
intimidating, so when I had an engine problem I shut it off."</TE>
<TE>   With Beard as his crew chief, Bazemore may have an edge over other
funny car challengers such as Bruce Sarver, Ron Capps and former top
fuel champion Gary Scelzi in chasing Force. In 1992, when Cruz
Pedregon became the only driver to unseat Force during the '90s,
Beard was team manager.</TE>
<TE>   "If anybody knows how to beat Force, it's Lee Beard," Bazemore
said. "He's taught me an awful lot in one year."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Bazemore acquired a funny car teammate in Scotty
Cannon, best known for his Mohawk hairstyle.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll admit, I was skeptical about having a second driver because
I thought it would dilute my effort just when we were going so
strong, but now that Scotty and I have tested together, I see having
him alongside as a positive," said Bazemore. "I was very impressed
when he changed his driving style to mine, so that we could better
compare notes. It is quite unusual for a driver to adapt to another's
techniques, but he did, and for that I'm very grateful. In the long
run, I can't see it being anything but beneficial."</TE>
<TE>   In head-to-head matches with Force, Bazemore was 4-6 last year,
but won three of the last four.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to think about the guy in the next lane, but the problem
with that is that it's easy to get up for a guy like Force, but if
you do, then it's easy to let yourself down for someone not quite as
competitive. And you can't do that these days when races are
sometimes decided in thousands of a second.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to race the lane, making sure I do the absolute best I can
in every run. I'm more concerned about myself, about the job I have
to do, to minimize mistakes and make every run as perfect as
possible. On the other hand, there's no question the adrenaline runs
a little quicker when Force is in the other lane, so maybe I dig in a
little deeper, raise the bar a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Force has been facing these challengers for years. Capps, in Don
Prudhomme's car, came close in 1998, only to fall back in '99. In
1995 it was veteran Al Hofmann who crept within 305 points of Force.
Three times in the decade, 1999, 1997 and 1996, Force's closest
competitor was Tony Pedregon, his hand-picked teammate and protege.</TE>
<TE>   "This could be the toughest season since Don Prudhomme in the Army
car, [Raymond Beadle in] the Blue Max and [Kenny Bernstein in] the
Budweiser King raced," said Force. That was 1981, when Beadle won his
third consecutive title.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this will be a year like that. I have to be totally
focused. Last year at the beginning [event wins] were from Sarver, to
Capps, to Bazemore. It's all a matter of everyone keeping it together
for all 23 races."</TE>
<TE>   Scelzi is the wild card in funny car ranks. After winning three
top fuel championships for owner/tuner Alan Johnson, the team lost
its Winston sponsorship this year and decided to make a switch to
funny cars.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be an entirely new experience for the Fresno veteran, as
he drove alcohol funny cars for seven years before Johnson chose him
to replace Blaine Johnson in the family top fuel car after Blaine was
killed in an accident in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this might be Force's toughest year," said Scelzi. "If
you beat Force, you know you have done something. And even if
[someone] takes the championship from him, you are not going to
change his persona. You're not going to change the fact that he is
the baddest man ever to get in a funny car. Period."</TE>
<TE>   Both Bazemore and Force will have added responsibilities this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Bazemore was married to Michelle Mercer Dec. 8 on the island of
Anguilla in the British West Indies, and they have purchased a bus to
travel from race to race.</TE>
<TE>   Force, in addition to running his three-car funny car team, will
also manage the career of his 19-year-old daughter, Ashley, who will
run a full season of super comp events.</TE>

<HD>Drag Racing Gets Toyota, Johnson Entry</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Toyota Racing Development and funny car team owner Alan Johnson
announced Wednesday they have joined forces to compete in the NHRA
Powerade Drag Racing Series. The 2002 Toyota Celica makes its debut
today during qualifying for the 42nd K&amp;N Filters Winternationals at
Pomona Raceway.</LD>
<LD>   Toyota becomes the first import manufacturer to compete in the
series' nitro fuel ranks.</LD>
<LD>   "We wanted it to be at least equal to the Firebird, and in the
wind tunnel it's a little better," Johnson said. "Under the best
conditions the Celica [reduces] maybe 5% of drag; under poor
conditions, you'd have the same drag but 5%-10% more downforce."</LD>
<TE>   Gary Scelzi, who won three top fuel dragster championships, will
drive the Celica this weekend. Today's qualifying run takes place
less than a week after the body's completion; it was finished Friday.</TE>
<TE>   White Cap Industries, a supplier of construction hardware, tools
and material, was announced as the team's primary sponsor. Johnson
said there are plans for Bruce Sarver to drive a second funny car
entry in two weeks at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Bodywork was developed using the production Celica GT-S as a
baseline, and Johnson said designers at Swift Engineering in San
Clemente produced a competitive body in only nine weeks. Johnson
Racing won't have a second body available until Saturday.</TE>

<HD>O'Neal Rests, All-Star Game Is Up in Air</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal spent the early part of Wednesday evening in a slick
gray-on-gray suit, searching behind wooden doors for Coach Phil
Jackson.</LD>
<LD>   An hour before the Lakers would play the Chicago Bulls, O'Neal,
because of his sore and arthritic big toe, decided he would sit it
out. In the season of the Lakers' three-peat effort, O'Neal has
missed nine games, six because of the toe, three--some say--because
of the frustration brought by it.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal again walked through and around the assembled reporters
without talking, a habit he acquired even before he took a swing at
Chicago's Brad Miller.</LD>
<TE>   Jackson clearly supported O'Neal's choice to skip the game against
the Bulls, and he'd probably prefer to have O'Neal miss Sunday's
All-Star game in Philadelphia as well. That, however, remains up to
O'Neal, who did not play in last year's game because of a sore right
foot, and Don Nelson, the Dallas coach who won the right to coach the
Western Conference team.</TE>
<TE>   "It's out of my control," Jackson said of the All-Star weekend. "I
can control this game tonight, encourage him to sit it out, get some
rest. Sunday's game is another venue, an entirely different thing.
That's the league's game."</TE>
<TE>   Still, a substantial tour in the All-Star game would seem to
undermine the entire point of his resting against Chicago. The Lakers
had hoped to use the airiest part of their schedule to get O'Neal at
least eight days off and perhaps, if he also sat out Tuesday against
Washington, 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   "My message to Shaq will be, 'If you want to go to the game,
participate in the game, fine,'" Jackson said. "Any coach that's
reasonable asks the players on the team before the game, 'Who's
injured?' 'Who's sick?' 'Who wants to play minutes and who doesn't?'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker assistant Tex Winter underwent tests Wednesday and will have
more today to determine the cause of what appeared to be an incident
of acid reflux in Philadelphia last week. Doctors have determined
that Winter's irregular heart beat probably was caused by the bout.</TE>

<LD>The Dallas Mavericks showed the New Jersey Nets why they are the
NBA's best road team.</LD>
<LD>   Playing with little rest after a double-overtime victory over
Indiana and without suspended forward Juwan Howard, the Mavericks
used a game-ending 16-2 run to beat the Nets, 112-100, Wednesday
night at East Rutherford, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very proud of this team, coming into two hostile places,"
said Tim Hardaway, who made a three-point basket to ignite the late
run. "After double overtime in Indiana, we had enough courage to come
out here and play with only nine people. We played a heck of a
ballgame against the top team in the East."</LD>
<TE>   Hardaway had seven of his 11 points in the run that led Dallas to
a team record-tying seventh consecutive road victory and ended the
Nets' eight-game home winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks, who set a team record by making their 27 free
throws, is a league-best 17-7 on the road. It has won 23 of its last
28 games, the best run in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas, which didn't arrive at its hotel in New Jersey until 4
a.m., had contributions from almost everyone in its final game before
the All-Star break. Dirk Nowitzki had 22 points and Steve Nash had
18.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had the best start (35-14) I think I've ever had at the
halfway mark," Dallas Coach Don Nelson said. "I can't remember a
better one."</TE>
<TE>   Kenyon Martin had 26 points and Keith Van Horn had 21 for the
Nets, who were shut out in the final 4:25.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 111, Houston 109--Lamond Murray scored the go-ahead
basket with 21 seconds remaining and blocked a shot with nine seconds
left at Cleveland, helping the Cavaliers end a three-game losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually, those are the plays that beat us," said Murray, who
finished  with 12 points. "Tonight, we stuck  with it and it went our
way. It feels  good."</TE>
<TE>   Andre Miller scored 31 points for the Cavaliers, who had lost 15
of their last 16.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Francis took Houston's last shot, a running 14-footer. The
ball bounced around the rim and fell through the basket, but the
officials ruled the shot came after time had expired.</TE>
<TE>   Cuttino Mobley scored 29 points for Houston and Francis had 25.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 102, Boston 85--The Kings were missing Chris Webber,
who was sidelined with stomach flu, but Peja Stojakovic and Vlade
Divac made up for it at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Stojakovic scored 24 points and Divac had 15 points, 14 rebounds
and 10 assists, his seventh career triple-double.</TE>
<TE>   Antoine Walker scored 26 points for the Celtics, who lost for the
fourth time in six games.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings swept the season series against the Celtics for the
second consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 113, Portland 103--Wally Szczerbiak snapped out of his
scoring slump with 30 points, six rebounds and five assists for the
Timberwolves at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Bonzi Wells scored a career-high 35 points for Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 90, Phoenix 79--Brent Barry scored 21 and the SuperSonics
ended a three-game home losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Marion had 19 points for the Suns, who scored a season-low
27 points in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Vin Baker returned for Seattle after sitting out Tuesday because
of neck spasms and scored 17 points.</TE>

<HD>Speedskater Peterson to Carry U.S. Flag</HD>
<DH>Winter Olympics: Third-generation Olympian Shea selected to
recite the Athletes' Oath at Friday's opening ceremony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>An ongoing battle with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome has relegated short
track speedskater Amy Peterson to a maddening roller coaster of
up-and-down days. But the four-time Olympian will enjoy a day like no
other Friday, when she carries the U.S. flag into Rice-Eccles Stadium
for the opening ceremony for the Salt Lake City Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   Peterson, of St. Paul, Minn., was chosen Wednesday to carry the
flag in a vote of the eight team captains of the sports contested at
the Games. The same group chose skeleton team member Jim Shea Jr. to
recite the Athletes' Oath on behalf of the assembled competitors, an
honor previously given to his late grandfather, Jack, at the 1932
Lake Placid Games.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just the greatest honor," Peterson said. "It's an honor
anyway, and I think to carry the flag in a situation like this, after
Sept. 11, is an even greater honor.</LD>
<TE>   "My emotions right now ... tears are in my eyes. I can only
imagine what the emotions are going to be like Friday night when I
walk into the stadium."</TE>
<TE>   Shea is a third generation Olympian. His father, Jim Sr., competed
in Nordic combined and cross country skiing at the 1964 Innsbruck
Games, and his grandfather won two gold medals in speedskating at the
1932 Games. Jack Shea died in a car accident in Lake Placid Jan. 22,
ending his dream of seeing his grandson carry on the family legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "It personally means a lot, knowing that so many athletes have
voted for me," Jim Shea Jr. said, "and it really gives me a great
sense of pride. I am extremely thankful for the show of support."</TE>
<TE>   The choice of Peterson was a surprise. Less familiar a name than
skier Picabo Street or long track speedskater Chris Witty, who have
overcome similar daunting obstacles, Peterson has been a member of
the U.S. short track team since 1988, when it was an exhibition
sport. She won a silver medal in the relay at Albertville in 1992 and
bronze medals in the relay and 500 meters at Lillehammer in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson, 30, is an eight-time U.S. champion and was first overall
at the Olympic trials in December. However, she has struggled with
her illness most of this season.</TE>
<TE>   "September, October, November didn't really go so well for me,"
she said earlier this week. "I came out of it a little bit and
produced good enough results ....</TE>
<TE>   "I have good days and bad days. Hopefully [next Wednesday, in the
women's 1,500] I'll have a good day. That's my first event. I'm
definitely in a lot better place than I was two or three months ago."</TE>
<TE>   Still to be chosen are the eight U.S. athletes who will carry into
the stadium the tattered flag found at the World Trade Center site
and later displayed at the World Series and the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Each winter sport will select one representative to escort the
flag, and those athletes will be accompanied by an honor guard of
police officers and firefighters and others whose heroic actions
Sept. 11 spared New York and Washington even greater tragedies. The
athletes' names are expected to be announced today.</TE>

<HD>Kwan's Options</HD>
<DH>Village Is Out but Olympics Still Possible in the Future</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Will she or won't she?</LD>
<LD>   Will Michelle Kwan, who was criticized for not staying in the
Olympic village at the Nagano Games and supposedly depriving herself
of the full Olympic experience, bunk with other U.S. athletes at Salt
Lake City?</LD>
<LD>   And will the six-time U.S. figure skating champion remain in the
Olympic-eligible ranks after the Games? Or will she trade the
pressure of performing triple-triple combination jumps and fending
off younger rivals for the rigors of ice shows and occasional
made-for-TV competitions?</LD>
<TE>   Inquiring minds want to know.</TE>
<TE>   Seriously, nearly everything the four-time world champion does is
newsworthy. Kwan, favored at Salt Lake City to win the gold medal
that eluded her four years ago, offered hints on both fronts during a
lengthy conversation several weeks ago:</TE>
<TE>   * She won't stay in the Olympic village at the University of Utah
but intends to march in the opening ceremony. "It's going to be fun,
in the U.S., a hop skip and a jump away," she said.</TE>
<TE>   * After this season, she might take a sabbatical from
Olympic-eligible events or reduce her schedule while keeping her
eligibility, as Todd Eldredge did in 1999 and 2000. She will compete
at Salt Lake City without a coach, having ended a nearly decade-long
alliance with Frank Carroll in October, but has considered taking on
a new coach someday to guide her along whatever path she chooses.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be interesting to see what happens in the next few years,
who I will end up taking [lessons] from, if I'm taking from a coach,
or what will happen," she said. "I can go to different people and
sample, test who I'm comfortable with....</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I'll stay in and only do certain competitions, like
nationals and worlds and not necessarily do all the international
competitions. That's where it gets chaotic. It takes the whole months
of October, November, December, and it is rough on the body,
especially being on tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I've ever announced anything like, 'I'm turning
professional,' because it shuts the door on opportunity. For me, it
doesn't seem the professional life is any different from what I'm
doing. I'm doing programs. I'm doing shows. I'm doing tours. I don't
know if I'd be able to do more if I were professional. People think
when you're professional, you take it easier, but that's not true.
Sometimes I look at Brian [Boitano], and he's just amazing because he
trains the same amount, like he's competing for the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   While athletes' accommodations at the Olympics aren't usually an
issue unless they trash the premises, Kwan's living quarters became
something of an issue at Nagano after she was upset by compatriot
Tara Lipinski.</TE>
<TE>   While Kwan skipped the opening ceremony to get treatment on her
injured left foot and moved into a hotel with her family, Lipinski
was pictured having a fine time. The 15-year-old marched in the
opening ceremony, perched on the lap of Hawaiian-born Japanese sumo
wrestler Akebono and generally soaked up the Olympic atmosphere, a
contrast to Kwan's business-like approach.</TE>
<TE>   After Lipinski's spirited performance in the free skate had lifted
her past Kwan and to the top step of the medal podium,
second-guessers speculated that Kwan had been uptight because she
hadn't allowed herself to have fun at the Games. If she had relaxed a
bit more, according to that line of reasoning, she might have been
more uninhibited in the free skate and might have won.</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense, Kwan said. She has no regrets about opting for the
privacy of a hotel instead of being assigned to share a room or suite
with another female U.S. figure skater at the athletes' village, and
she will have a similar arrangement at Salt Lake City. Lipinski,
incidentally, also spent time in a hotel before the competition.</TE>
<TE>   After Kwan marches in the opening ceremony, however, she will
return home to practice at Lake Arrowhead for at least a few days.
The Games start Friday, but the women's competition doesn't begin
until Feb. 19, with the short program.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't change anything," she said of her Nagano arrangements.
"For me, it was important that I had enough ice time before I left
and that I could be in my comfortable surroundings. Everybody was
sick in the village. And I wanted my parents around. I wanted to be
able to do things, to go shopping or whatever.</TE>
<TE>   "Other athletes did it, but I'm the only one who spoke up about
it. I don't want to name names, but they didn't stay at the village,
either.</TE>
<TE>   "Just the fact that at every other competition I don't have a
roommate, it's very difficult to have a roommate and adjust to
different time schedules. I did what I thought would work best for
me."</TE>

<HD>Elections Boost Presence of U.S. in IOC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON and HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>In voting that boosted U.S. influence on the International Olympic
Committee, Jim Easton of Van Nuys was elected to a four-year slot as
IOC vice president and Sandra Baldwin of Phoenix, president of the
U.S. Olympic Committee, was made an IOC member.</LD>
<LD>   Baldwin, who since taking over in December 2000, as president of
the USOC, has made goodwill and international relations a priority,
received 69 "yes" votes, 25 "no." She needed 48 to become a member.</LD>
<LD>   She said afterward that she was "happy and pleased," and hopes "to
use the [IOC] position to continue to build good relations with the
Olympic family around the world."</LD>
<TE>   In the contested vice presidential race, Easton, head of the
international archery federation, defeated Paul Henderson of Canada,
president of international sailing federation, 52-32. The election
means the U.S. will enjoy, as it traditionally has, a slot on the
IOC's policy-making Executive Board.</TE>
<TE>   Also elected to the 15-member board were Lebanon's Toni Khoury and
Tommy Sithole of Zimbabwe. Khoury now receives a full four-year term;
he had initially been elected last July to fill the vacancy on the
board that was created when Belgium's Jacques Rogge was elected IOC
president.</TE>
<TE>   The elections Wednesday increased the IOC membership rolls by 10,
to 131. Also elected was the president of Belgium's national Olympic
committee, Francois Narman. Others made members include two
extraordinarily young Arab royals--Sheikh Tamin Bin Hamad Bin Khalifa
al-Thani of Qatar and Prince Nawaf Fahd Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia.
The Saudi prince was born in 1978, the Qatari sheikh in 1980.</TE>

<TE>   The World Anti-Doping Agency is due Friday to provide an update on
results collected from the 3,500 out-of-competition tests it has
conducted over the past year. The opening ceremony is that night, and
the timing of the WADA announcement has prompted unease in some
quarters that doping-related issues might overshadow the pageantry.</TE>
<TE>   "We are aware of some of the problems [that may arise]," IOC
Director General Francois Carrard said.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman Dick Pound, a Canadian IOC member, told the IOC's general
assembly earlier this week that 24 tests have returned "elevated"
results. He cautioned that "elevated" does not necessarily mean
"positive," and that there are any number of innocent reasons why a
result might come back "elevated."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Latvian bobsledder Sandis Prusis is back in the Olympics despite a
decree by the IOC that he should be banned because of a positive drug
test.</TE>
<TE>   Prusis tested positive for nandrolone Nov. 9 after a practice run
at the Olympic track in Park City and was suspended from the
Olympics. However, he appealed to the international bobsled
federation, which accepted his contention he had inadvertently
ingested the banned substance in a food supplement and made his
suspension retroactive.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC tried to ban him, but the International Court for the
Arbitration of Sport said the IOC's charter forbids the organization
from overruling the federations that govern various sports.</TE>
<TE>   "We were aware that there was a risk [in banning Prusis]. We took
it," Carrard said. "This step is very useful because although the
case of Prusis individually is solved, the message that is sent to
the international federation is very strong.... We need to amend the
charter."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Four-time Olympian Nina Kemppel is looking forward to
participating in the first mass-start cross-country ski race Saturday
at Soldier Hollow.</TE>
<TE>   Kemppel will compete in the women's 15-kilometer race, which used
to send skiers out onto the course at intervals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's much more fun for us," she said. "It's like a track race,
only we have sharp instruments in our hands.... We are notoriously
worse than the men. We're much more catty."</TE>
<TE>   Kemppel, the first female cross-country skier to qualify for four
U.S. Olympic teams, joked that she has learned to sharpen her elbows
to avoid getting knocked off the pace.</TE>
<TE>   "After about 5K, people get tired enough to stop fighting with
each other and start skiing," she said. "It is nasty. There was one
World Cup race, where I stepped on a Russian woman's ski and she
didn't like that very much. I don't know Russian curses but all of a
sudden she took her pole and stabbed me right in the backside. We
were wearing white, and there was a lot of blood.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like rush-hour traffic. You have tolerance to some point and
then it just snaps. It's road rage."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The International Ski Federation suspended Russian cross-country
skier Natalia Baranova-Masolkina for failing an out-of-competition
drug test Jan. 18 in Austria.</TE>

<HD>Bellflower Is Keeping It All in the Families</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lauren Peterson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cathy Fong watches her players during practices and games and can
barely see the field through all the family trees that make up the
Bellflower soccer team.</LD>
<LD>   The Buccaneers' varsity roster includes three sets of sisters.</LD>
<LD>   "It's fun," said Fong, the Buccaneers' coach. "All the parents and
families are there."</LD>
<TE>   There is another set of siblings on the junior-varsity squad.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of holds us together more because we are family," said
Jacki Goodban, a junior sweeper and team captain who is also freshman
fullback Bobbi Jo's sister.</TE>
<TE>   Each set of siblings includes a freshman and a junior.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Goodbans, there are Chrislyn and Allison Young and
Jessica and Danielle Montez on the varsity, and Christina and Raquel
Ramirez on the JV team.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer is a prime topic of conversation and a source of both
camaraderie and competition in each of the households.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk about it all the time, especially since we both play
defense," Bobbi Jo Goodban said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time we've played on the same team."</TE>
<TE>   That is much to the delight of their parents, who no longer need
to split up to watch the girls play at different sites.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the year I've always waited for," said Jackie and Bobbi Jo's
mother, Dawn Goodban.</TE>
<TE>   "It was something I knew that they'd enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   "They're so close and they do everything together."</TE>
<TE>   Bellflower (9-8-2, 4-4-1) needs victories in its last two Suburban
League games against Norwalk and Mayfair to remain in the hunt for a
playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of siblings: Ventura High also has a sister act, with
defenders Alicia and Natalia Coenen and goalkeeper Teressa Coenen
each adding a different dimension to the Cougars' squad.</TE>
<TE>   "They're three different girls, all pretty talented, all pretty
good players," Coach Mike Ishihara said.</TE>
<TE>   Alicia, a four-year starter, has good technical skills and has
played through a high-ankle sprain in order to complete her senior
season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my senior year and it was important to me to play, to be
part of the team," she said. "I didn't want to miss it."</TE>
<TE>   Natalia, a sophomore, is the most aggressive and physical of the
sisters.</TE>
<TE>   Teressa, a freshman, started in goal all season. Because her
position demands it, Teressa is more an instinctive, quick-thinking
type of player.</TE>
<TE>   "We're totally different," Natalia said. "We really don't see each
other as sisters on the field too much."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Coenens' efforts on defense, the Cougars (6-8-4,
2-5-1) have struggled because of a lack of offense. They ended their
season with a scoreless tie against Santa Barbara in a Channel League
game on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Solving injury riddle: Walnut (17-1-3, 7-0-2), ranked fifth in the
Southern Section Division II coaches' poll, is winning despite
injuries to two key players.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorer Kandace Wilson, a senior forward who will attend
Cal State Fullerton on a soccer scholarship, broke her right ankle
three weeks ago in an Olympic Development Program camp and is not
expected to return this season.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson had 18 goals and 12 assists to lead the Mustangs and the
team missed her firepower in Baseline League ties with Upland and Don
Lugo the week after she went down.</TE>
<TE>   "She's one of these young ladies who's awfully tough to replace,"
Coach Scott DeGraff said.</TE>
<TE>   Junior goalkeeper Christine Rostowfske broke her left wrist in a
practice around the same time as Wilson was injured and has been
sidelined since.</TE>
<TE>   Behind senior stopper Erin Diskin, backup goalie Roshena Chadha
has played well, and others have picked up the offensive slack for
Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, I feel pretty confident about our team," DeGraff said.
"They realize they can't rely on one person anymore. It's made them a
lot closer."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Shah Jehan, who cost $4.4 million as a yearling, will make his U.S.
debut Friday at Santa Anita, facing five other 3-year-olds in the
$75,000 Sham Stakes.</LD>
<LD>   Shah Jehan, owned by John Magnier and Michael Tabor, who also
campaign Johannesburg, the winner of last year's Breeders' Cup
Juvenile, won one of four starts last year in Europe, finishing
seventh in his last start, about 31/2 months ago. Originally in the
hands of Aidan O'Brien, who's also the trainer of Johannesburg, the
Mr. Prospector colt is now trained by Wayne Lukas, who was bidding
against Magnier and Tabor when the horse went through the Keeneland
sales ring. Tabor won the 1995 Kentucky Derby with Thunder Gulch, a
colt trained by Lukas.</LD>
<LD>   At 11/8 miles, the Sham has also drawn Hot Contest, who broke his
maiden on Dec. 30, and Cottonwood Cowboy, who was third in the Santa
Catalina Stakes on Jan. 19.</LD>
<TE>   Johannesburg, who finished the year undefeated in seven starts,
has not run since the Breeders' Cup and has begun light training in
Ireland. O'Brien said that no plan would be outlined until late this
month. One scenario has Johannesburg running once at home, then in
the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct on April 13 and the Kentucky Derby on
May 1. Another possibility is that Johannesburg would skip the Triple
Crown and concentrate on the British classics.</TE>

<TE>   Red Bullet is the 3-1 morning-line favorite in a field of 14 for
Saturday's $500,000 Donn Handicap at Gulfstream Park in Florida. Red
Bullet will be ridden by Jerry Bailey, who'll make another
cross-country trip to ride You on Sunday in the $200,000 Las Virgenes
at Santa Anita. ... Unbridled Elaine, winner of the Breeders' Cup
Distaff, has been retired because of ankle injuries. ... Early
reports on telephone and Internet betting in California show that
$839,097--an average of $139,850 a day--was bet the first six days
accounts were available.</TE>

<LD>Because of bad weather, Oaklawn Park canceled racing Wednesday,
meaning there will be a pick six carryover of more than $144,000 if
the action resumes today at the Arkansas track.</LD>
<LD>   If a player is going to Santa Anita or one of the various
simulcast sites, he or she won't be able to get in on the action at
Oaklawn. Santa Anita is only offering races 5-9 this afternoon and
the pick six there starts on the third race.</LD>
<LD>   In the second leg of the local pick six, Call Me Again will try to
break his maiden for a second time. The 5-year-old son of Phone Trick
defeated $25,000 maidens by seven lengths last Aug. 1 at Del Mar, but
was later disqualified from the purse money because of a medication
violation.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by the Thoroughbred Corporation and trained by John
Shirreffs, Call Me Again is the 5-2 second choice in today's race, a
six-furlong dash for $25,000 claimers. Most recently, the gray was
second at 26-1 behind $16,000 winners, beaten two lengths by veteran
Weinhard and finishing a nose in front of No Apollogee, who has seven
victories.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh, trainer Bobby Frankel will saddle the first and
second choices in the about 61/2-furlong turf race that attracted
nine runners.</TE>
<TE>   Beefeater Baby, who finished second in her first race in more than
six months on Jan. 6, is the 5-2 favorite and Langoureuse, who beat
lesser over the course on New Year's Eve, is 7-2.</TE>
<TE>   Other contenders include Nanogram, who has two wins down the
hillside for trainer John Sadler, recent upset winner Walts Wharf and
Slew City Liz.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The third is a $16,000 claimer for 3-year-old
fillies and mares where Be Nice will try for a repeat in her first
for Bob Hess Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Joe Badilla Jr. The leading quarter horse jockey in
2001 with 183 wins and more than $2.7 million in earnings, Badilla
will be back in action Friday night at Los Alamitos after taking some
time off to get completely healthy.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Dingle. The 3-year-old colt has been beaten a combined
93 lengths in his first four races. He runs in today's third at the
Fair Grounds in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  Exacta boxes in the third keying Sieze Her
with Bartley, Be Nice and Prospective Angel.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous Day/Meet Total: 4/94. Money: Previous Day/Meet
Total: $19/$582.20. Total money bet: $528.</TE>

<LD>Jim Beaumont, baseball coach at Manhattan Beach Mira Costa High for
14 years, resigned last week in a dispute with the administration,
which wanted to demote an assistant junior varsity coach for using
profanity last season.</LD>
<LD>   "We did not want Mr. Beaumont to resign, but we were unable to
come to a compromise," Principal Lynn McCormack said.</LD>
<LD>   Nine members of Mira Costa's baseball staff joined Beaumont in
resigning. Practice is scheduled to begin next week.</LD>
