<HD>Drum-and-Bass Highlights Nocturnal Wonderland</HD>

<LD>For the past eight years, Labor Day in Southern California has meant
Nocturnal Wonderland to ravers. But with pressure from government on
outdoor dance music events and the difficulties conducting last
year's Wonderland at Lake Havasu, the organizers decided to take this
year's festivities indoors and scale back.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of one all-day show, Insomniac took over the new Qtopia
club in Hollywood for concerts on Saturday and Sunday nights. The
Sunday show, called Bassrush, celebrated the frenetic world of
drum-and-bass, a popular genre of electronic music that is known for
the dizzying pace of its beats, its use of vocalists or MCs, and the
infusion of tribal percussion.</LD>
<LD>   More than a thousand fans packed the three-room club on Sunday for
a lineup that included the genre's biggest star, Roni Size, as well
as Adam F, DJ Craze, and Reid Speed. In the venue's other rooms,
Ninja Tunes' Mixmaster Morris wove old-school ambience and techno
from the early '90s for four hours, while DJ Trance and Mindbender
were among those spinning old-school breakbeats in the third room.</LD>
<TE>   Still, it was the drum-and-bass that was the main attraction.
Size, joined by the high-energy MC Tali, showed off his DJ skills in
a two-hour set that was noteworthy for its diversity. While Size gave
the crowd what it wanted in the form of fast-paced beats, he mixed up
the set with some reggae-tinged tunes and a calypso number. In
throwing in a few curveballs, the Englishman made his fastball seem
that much more impressive.</TE>
<TE>   Though Size was the top draw, everybody on the bill worked hard
and conveyed a love for the scene--there was no flying in, picking up
a check and dashing out the door. While Craze wrapped up his set, for
instance, Size stood behind him on stage pumping up the crowd. A
small gesture, but one the fans packed into that main room won't
forget soon.</TE>

<HD>'Signs' Steady at No. 1 During a 'Big Fat Greek' Weekend</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GERMAIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moviegoers spent another weekend investigating crop circles as Mel
Gibson's "Signs" topped the box office again, taking in an estimated
$16.5 million over the Labor Day weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The season's top sleeper hit, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" had its
best weekend in five months of release, climbing to second place with
an estimated $14.6 million from Friday to Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The only new wide release, the horror flick "feardotcom,"
premiered at No. 5 with $7.12 million, according to studio estimates
released Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Hollywood revenues were off for the seventh-straight weekend after
robust returns for the first half of summer. The top 12 movies
grossed $82.2 million over the four-day weekend, down 12.4% from last
year's record Labor Day weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Tracking revenues from early May, admissions were up 6.5%. The
industry took in $3.8 billion from early May through Labor Day, up
about 10% from the same period in 2001, according to Exhibitor
Relations.</TE>
<TE>   "Greek Wedding" expanded to 1,619 theaters, up 290 from the
previous weekend, averaging an impressive $9,017 per cinema, lifting
its gross to $82.3 million and putting it on track to reach $100
million.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of us were talking at the beginning about $20 million or $25
million if we're lucky, but no one ever dreamed of hitting $100
million," said Rob Schwartz, head of distribution for IFC Films,
which released "Greek Wedding."</TE>
<TE>   "Signs," the tale of a farmer coping with mysterious crop circles
and visitors from the skies, is on its way to $200 million. The film,
written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan ("The Sixth Sense"),
averaged $4,805 per screen in 3,437 theaters and has grossed $195.1
million in a month.</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 in early August, "Signs" slipped to second place behind
"XXX" for two weekends, then reclaimed the top spot last week.</TE>
<TE>   For the holiday, "Signs" drew a mix of first-time viewers and
repeat business, said Chuck Viane, head of distribution for Disney,
which released the film.</TE>
<TE>   "Labor Day has historically shown everyone that that is the
weekend the public either likes to repeat their viewing or catch up
with movies they haven't seen yet," Viane said.</TE>
<TE>   Two critically acclaimed films expanded to more theaters and
climbed into the top 10. Jennifer Aniston's dark comedy "The Good
Girl" came in at No. 9 with $3.6 million in 667 theaters, up 479 from
the previous weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The Robin Williams stalking thriller "One Hour Photo" was No. 10
with $3.33 million, expanding to 164 theaters after debuting at No. 7
a week earlier. "One Hour Photo" averaged a whopping $20,274 a screen
and goes nationwide Sept. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Distributor Fox Searchlight released "The Good Girl" and "One Hour
Photo" in late summer as alternatives to the onslaught of lower-brow
blockbusters earlier in the season.</TE>
<TE>   "August has been traditionally a really good time for
counter-programming after the big, high-concept sequels, sci-fi and
action movies," said Steve Gilula, Fox Searchlight head of
distribution.</TE>

<HD>'American Idol' Is Fox's Summer Salvation</HD>
<DH>Television* The wildly popular show, surpassing all network
expectations, will have its two-night finale broadcast from the Kodak
Theatre.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It began as little more than low-cost original programming to help
the struggling Fox network stay competitive during the
low-expectation summer months. It goes out tonight and Wednesday
night as a glitzy extravaganza that rivals some Hollywood awards
ceremonies for star power and glamour.</LD>
<LD>   "Entertainment Tonight" and "Access Hollywood" are among the media
outlets negotiating to secure the crucial first position for
interviews on the red carpet outside the theater on Hollywood
Boulevard. Celebrity arrivals will be broadcast live. Hollywood's
Kodak Theatre, the home of the Oscars, is undergoing one last
spit-and-polish for the live broadcast.</LD>
<LD>   The commotion is not over a gala awards show or the premiere of a
new movie blockbuster, but over the finale of a television
show--Fox's "American Idol," the talent-search-meets-"Survivor"
series in which several young contestants compete to become America's
new "superstar."</LD>
<TE>   "American Idol" may be about the making of a star, but the show
itself has blossomed into a cultural phenomenon, which is likely to
continue even after the winner is crowned at Wednesday night's finale
at Hollywood's Kodak Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The unscripted series, with its gimmicks of a talent show, a harsh
British judge and a viewer call-in poll, attained "water cooler"
status soon after its June premiere and has in the last few weeks
earned record ratings and provided a much-needed shot in the arm for
Fox, which is coming off a disappointing season in terms of ratings.</TE>
<TE>   More than 5,000 tickets to the final two nights sold out in
minutes, and E! Entertainment Television will broadcast a live
pre-show as if it were a major awards show. Celebrities have been
clamoring to get on the guest list. Ray Romano of CBS' "Everybody
Loves Raymond" wrote in more than a month ago for tickets for him and
his family. Megan Mullally of NBC's "Will &amp; Grace" wants in, as do
Ellen DeGeneres, "The West Wing's" Allison Janney and Dule Hill, as
well as Tori Spelling and Selma Blair.</TE>
<TE>   They all want to see two novice performers--nobodies only a few
months ago--face off in a final showdown. Outside the Kodak,
thousands of fans are expected to gather behind barricades.</TE>
<TE>   The two-night finale will be broadcast live from the Kodak to the
East Coast and tape-delayed on the West Coast. Tonight's installment
of "American Idol," at 9 on Fox, will feature a sing-off between the
two finalists, Kelly Clarkson, 20, from Burleson, Texas, and Justin
Guarini, 23, from Doylestown, Pa. Viewers will then call in to vote
for their favorites.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's two-hour production, which can be seen at 8 p.m., is
likely to be the highest-rated program of the summer and will be
followed by an avalanche of "American Idol" material. The winner will
be rewarded with a recording contract with RCA Records and will have
a single out Sept. 17, followed closely by two "American Idol"-linked
albums. An arena tour will follow.</TE>
<TE>   And like all show-biz sensations, it's already spawned plans for a
sequel. There's no date set for "American Idol 2"; Fox Entertainment
President Gail Berman had hoped to have a planning meeting last week
for the second round, but the key players were too preoccupied with
the finale for the first.</TE>
<TE>   All of the endeavors are being taken seriously by a slumping music
industry, whose executives have taken note of the show's massive
viewership.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the albums will debut extremely high on the pop charts;
they will have very big first-week sales," said Bob Bell, a buyer for
Wherehouse, one of the nation's larger music retailers. "There is a
huge potential because of the sheer number of people watching this
show--it's millions and millions. If even a fraction of the viewers
buy it, it would have the potential to debut No. 1."</TE>
<TE>   Bell cited the success of O-Town, a vocal group crafted on the
series "Making the Band," as a modest example of the type of success
the "American Idol" might achieve with music buyers: "They had a No.
1 single and did well out of the box, and that show did not catch on
the way this show has."</TE>
<TE>   "American Idol" is more than just the flavor of the waning summer
months. TV insiders say "American Idol" is a breakout hit that has
provided an invaluable launch pad for Fox's upcoming fall lineup,
providing numerous promotional opportunities from new and returning
series such as "Firefly," "The Bernie Mac Show" and "Fastlane."</TE>
<TE>   And timing is everything. Fox is coming off a season that produced
two critical hits, "24" and "The Bernie Mac Show," but no smash
viewer favorites. The network also lost two of its key series, "Ally
McBeal" and "The X-Files."</TE>
<TE>   "This show really established Fox in the industry as having a lot
of forward momentum," said Bob Flood, senior vice president and
director of national TV for Optimedia International, an agency that
purchases television advertising time for many major national brands.
"It provided a shot of much-needed adrenaline."</TE>
<TE>   Last Wednesday's "American Idol" installment, in which 23-year-old
single mother Nikki McKibbin was eliminated, attracted almost 17
million viewers, the second-highest-rated program of the summer. Only
a July repeat of a "CSI" episode scored higher. ("Idol" may be big,
but not on the level of another summer reality series: "Survivor"
drew more than 28 million viewers for its run-up installments in
August 2000, and the finale attracted nearly 52 million viewers.)</TE>
<TE>   Even Fox Entertainment's Berman was caught off guard by the frenzy
over "American Idol," which she regarded initially as a fresh show
that could take the place of summer repeats.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of the summer, Berman and Fox Television
Entertainment Group President Sandy Grushow discussed long-term plans
and how one of the goals was to find "an ad-friendly show along the
lines of 'Survivor' and 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire' that would
attract young adults.</TE>
<TE>   "We had modest expectations," said Berman of "American Idol." "We
just hoped it would bring young women to the network and keep our
lights on through summer. Needless to say, it has far exceeded our
wildest expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's "American Idol" was the top-rated show among the 18-49
demographic advertisers crave.</TE>
<TE>   The series was prominently sponsored by Coke and Ford, and weekly
segments showed the contestants using the products in specially
designed spots. Not surprisingly, executives for both Coke and Ford
said they were more than happy with their association with the show.</TE>
<TE>   "It really did exceed our expectations in terms of the 'water
cooler' aspect and all the media coverage as well as viewership,"
said Julie Eisen, senior manager of entertainment marketing for Coke.
"We had mainly wanted to support fresh talent. But we had no clue the
show would work as well as it did."</TE>
<TE>   Curt Jaksen, group communication director for J. Walter Thompson,
the Ford Division advertising agency, added: "Yes, we're happy with
our partnership. We're ready to take a deep breath and look at
'American Idol 2.' "</TE>
<TE>   One television expert speculated that the frequently harsh
treatment of contestants and the conflict-fueled chemistry between
the three "American Idol" judges--the sharp-tongued British record
executive Simon Cowell versus the more complimentary Paula Abdul and
the amiable music industry veteran Randy Jackson--helped "American
Idol" rise above the popularity of other music-related series such as
"Making the Band" and "Pop Stars."</TE>
<TE>   "The best of all the post-'Survivor' shows all add something new
to the mix," said Tim Brooks, co-author of "The Complete Directory to
Prime-Time Network and Cable TV Shows."</TE>
<TE>   "What this show added was brutal reality. With 'The Weakest Link,'
the put-downs were jokes. What makes 'American Idol' really work was
the painful depiction of what competition to reach the top is like.
That painful reality really strips away the artifice of television.
It had true appeal."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "Here, people really tuned in to see the judges. Simon
was nicely matched against Paula, who came across like Snow White.
Randy was the third of the troika. Simon could be real brutal in his
criticisms, but then he could be enormously supportive to them if he
felt they had something. That gave him credibility."</TE>
<TE>   Nigel Lythgoe, one of the series' co-executive producers, said he
knew "American Idol" would grow in popularity through the summer
"because you're letting the public be involved. We're asking the
public, 'Tell us who you want to be your next singing sensation.' "</TE>
<TE>   Lythgoe is one of the executives with 19 Entertainment, which
produces "American Idol" along with FremantleMedia. The companies
produced the show's predecessor, "Pop Idol," in Britain earlier this
year, which also became a cultural sensation. Auditions for "Pop Idol
2" are planned for May.</TE>
<TE>   "In the U.K., it became a moral obligation to vote," Lythgoe said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Ken Warwick, another co-executive producer, "More than 91
million people called in on the final night. The phone company went
haywire."</TE>
<TE>   Will Young, the winner of "Pop Idol," will perform on both shows
this week. Also scheduled for Wednesday are musical numbers featuring
the 10 finalists, as well as a look back at the show's previous
episodes.</TE>
<TE>   The "American Idol" onslaught will continue after the finale, with
a tour, records, a DVD and a Fox special later this month with the
reunion of "American Idol" finalists in a Las Vegas concert. Fox will
get a piece of the merchandising profits.</TE>
<TE>   The arena tour kicks off in Southern California with an Oct. 8
date at the Cox Arena in San Diego and returns to the region with a
Nov. 15 show at the Arrowhead Pond. Tickets for those shows go on
sale Saturday and Sunday, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   One "American Idol" fanatic who will attend both nights of the
finale is Janet Valdez, 18, of Downey, a student who spent all night
at the Kodak in order to score tickets. Valdez, who is studying music
business and history, has attended all the "American Idol" live
shows.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important to all of America that we get to pick the
next big star," said Valdez, wearing an "American Idol" baseball hat
given to her by a crew member. Her support has continued even though
her favorite, RJ Helton, was voted off three weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   As for the winner of the "American Idol" crown, it seems almost a
foregone conclusion that the winner will have a No. 1 record. But
will there be a situation where heavy hangs the head of the "American
Idol"? "As much as they may want it, the title of 'American Idol' is
a little cheesy, and it's going to be something that follows them the
rest of their lives," Lythgoe said. "So coming in second isn't so
bad. But so many of these kids are going to be stars."</TE>

<KH>Venice Film Festival</KH>
<HD>Queen of the Lido</HD>
<DH>After 44 years, Sophia Loren returns to Venice festival</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY COLBERT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a weekend reception held at the luxurious Excelsior Hotel on
Venice's Lido--the nerve center of the world's oldest film
festival--Jack Valenti, chairman of the Motion Picture Assn. of
America, and two other senior Hollywood figures huddled in a corner,
engaged in a lively debate.</LD>
<LD>   Their discussion, however, did not involve deals or strategies to
combat European quotas for American movies--or even the festival's
films. The topic was Sophia Loren's frocks.</LD>
<LD>   Opinion was divided sharply over which Armani outfit--an
off-the-shoulder black chiffon ruffle displaying the star's best
assets worn at the presentation of a life achievement award or the
fuchsia extravaganza of the previous evening, offsetting her
coloring--was more becoming. One opined that the cream linen day
dress couldn't be discounted. Another nostalgically recalled a bygone
movie era of more Loren contours and less dress, long before the
collaboration between the contemporary Italian designer and star. The
trio's appreciation of design minutiae was astounding.</LD>
<TE>   Loren last visited this event in 1958, winning best actress for
Martin Ritt's "Black Orchid." That year, when William Holden first
encountered the young starlet, he gushed, "I never saw so much woman
coming at me in my entire life." More than four decades later, the
67-year-old Loren apparently still has the same effect.</TE>
<TE>   Much to the dissatisfaction of Venetians, Loren has not returned
to the city except to shoot Vittorio de Sica's last film, "The
Voyage" (1974), opposite Richard Burton. Numerous attempts to lure
her to the festival to accept a life achievement award have failed,
until now. This elusiveness has created an even greater aura around
the icon, who resides in Switzerland. And greater demand.</TE>
<TE>   So her return as an honoree and star of younger son Eduardo
Ponti's debut feature, "Between Strangers," has been hailed as a
second coming, a phenomenon that taps her dual appeal: as a screen
goddess and family role model.</TE>
<TE>   Although critical reaction has been mixed to the Italian-Canadian
co-production inspired by the work of Ponti's idol, Krysztof
Kieslowski, public and press appetite for Loren has been voracious.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the ambitious film, which interweaves the stories of
three women of different generations facing life crossroads, opens in
Italy on Sept. 13, the half dozen public festival screenings quickly
sold out. Because of public demand, an extra one is scheduled for
Friday before the print's departure for the Toronto Film Festival.</TE>
<TE>   At its world premiere gala here, Loren received a rapturous
eight-minute standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Stunning in a vibrant red top and matching neck scarf offset by
elegant beige linen pants, Loren greeted a reporter at her hotel room
the morning after the gala. The color, combined with her auburn hair
and olive skin, lights up the room. If only Valenti and company could
see this. Despite a very late night, she shows no visible signs of
weariness. Undoubtedly, accustomed as she is to displays of public
affection, she's still buoyed by the previous night's outpouring.</TE>
<TE>   "I really felt moved to see people express such emotion," she
says. "You start to think 'Do I really deserve this?' But then I
erased the thought because I wanted to enjoy the moment and just go
with it.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always had a close relationship with my public, but
occasions like this really make you realize how much you become a
part of people's lives." She says this with quiet confidence, candor
rather than hubris. "Maybe they like your work or the way you lead
your life; maybe it's a special chemistry. But it's difficult not to
feel elated."</TE>
<TE>   Close up, Loren's skin and eyes bear none of the obvious
stretched-perfect lack of elasticity of cosmetic surgery. She has
repeatedly denied going under the knife, and without the trademark
tinted glasses, her green eyes heavily etched in kohl are piercingly
direct. Her appearance and poise bear a marked contrast to her
"Between Strangers" persona, Olivia, an unfulfilled mature woman
trapped in a loveless marriage to a disabled, bitter and controlling
husband (Pete Postlethwaite). Drably dressed in oversize dresses and
cardigans, hair flat and graying, eyes heavily wrinkled, the
character is stripped to the bare, fragile essentials. For an aging
actress whose career was launched by a beauty contest, it's a brave
outing.</TE>
<TE>   In a moment of vanity, she points out that it took 2 1/2 hours of
makeup to prepare her for each day's shoot. The physical
accouterments dismissed, the mental and emotional transformation
surely must have presented a huge stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't always have an easy life," Loren replies. "Those early
impressionable years were tough.... All this leaves a mark inside of
yourself. I've been fortunate to overcome this bitterness and
traumas. But my nature is both dramatic and optimistic," she says.
"It's a mix of both, so when I have these kind of roles, I let go
this internal baggage and put it there at the disposal of whoever
wants to use it."</TE>
<TE>   With her son at the helm, she felt more at ease. But, particularly
compared to some of her fellow actors in the film--Mira Sorvino,
Deborah Kara Unger, Gerard Depardieu, Klaus Maria Brandauer--it's an
economic performance that relies on body and eye language.</TE>
<TE>   She practiced that restraint off-screen by withholding advice
during the shoot. "I never push," she says. Not even with the
experience of 100 films behind her? "Oh no, they have to express
themselves," she says of her two sons. (The older, Carlo, is a guest
conductor with the Russian national orchestra and his own orchestra
in San Bernardino.) "Eduardo wrote the film; he knew what he wanted."</TE>
<TE>   On the subject of her younger son, Loren is, like most parents,
unstoppable. "He's so sensitive, so intellectual, analytical, has
such a feel for language." The list goes on. "I'm so proud both my
sons are leading such creative lives."</TE>
<TE>   Eduardo Ponti confides that it took some discussions to elicit the
restrained performance from his dramatic mother.</TE>
<TE>   "I explained there was a lot of opportunity in this movie for
emoting," he says. "She's emotional; she's Neapolitan. I knew her
instinct was to show her feelings --that's why people love her-- and
she was trying to be so conscientious that I asked her to internalize
the tension, keep the fire inside and only show it through her eyes."</TE>
<TE>   At a festival where explorations of female psyche have received
prominence, Loren beams satisfaction in acknowledgment of the change
of direction in female roles from her heyday.</TE>
<TE>   "I like that a lot," she says quietly. "Because for some
time--apart from as sex objects--women didn't count at all on screen.
Now it seems there's been a turnaround, and I'm fascinated by the
interest in depicting them as fully fledged, complex human beings."</TE>
<TE>   She's much more interested these days in characters on inner
journeys.</TE>
<TE>   But her passion for work has been somewhat limited by
circumstances beyond her control. Most of her favorite
directors--George Cukor, De Sica, Charlie Chaplin--are deceased.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Lina Wertmuller, a longtime favorite collaborator, is
very much alive and they're scheduled to shoot their next project,
"The House of the Geraniums," in February.</TE>
<TE>   "When you reach a certain age, you have to be more selective," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't want to become a caricature of my younger self.
You have to find the right story, adjust it to your personality,
feelings, age. I respect very much who I am today, and I want to put
this on the screen, not something else.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you have to accept each moment," she adds
philosophically. "You cannot be spared, so it's better to accept old
age with serenity. That way you can say goodbye to youth and open up
another door.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a strong will to express myself and to feel an entire
spectrum of emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "And now, especially now, that the children, though we are still
very close, have gone their own way, it's important to work, to throw
one's creative energies into projects--otherwise life can become a
little sad."</TE>
<TE>   Movies have given Loren a passport to so much--wealth, travel,
security, adulation, creativity--and yet her hunger is not quelled.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of career gratification, she says, "I'm in this business
because of my will to express myself, not because I want to take
something from it."</TE>

<LD>Roger Avary, the 37-year-old director of the upcoming film "The Rules
of Attraction," has spent a lot of time in the editing room lately,
thanks to the Motion Picture Assn. of America ratings board. Avary,
best known as the co-writer of "Pulp Fiction," has submitted his film
four times to the board. Each time it has come back rated NC-17--the
kiss of death for a major release.</LD>
<LD>   Avary sees "Rules," which is based on a Bret Easton Ellis novel
and features such hot young actors as James Van Der Beek and Shannyn
Sossamon, as a scabrous social satire about upper-crust college
students who indulge in a veritable orgy of sex, drugs, drinking,
suicide attempts and--did we mention sex already? In one deadpan
sequence, one of the characters, played by Kip Pardue, narrates a
home-video-style account of his summer vacation in Europe, where he
recounts his sexual encounters with the same blase intonation that he
uses to describe his visits to various fabled art museums.</LD>
<LD>   Avary says the MPAA board was not amused. "They objected to his
tone about sex being just as mundane as it was about the art museums.
They've been trying to get me to cut out more and more of the sex,
saying it was demeaning to women. It's gotten to the point where I
would prefer outright censorship. It would be more fair than what I'm
going through now."</LD>
<TE>   With the MPAA, sex is always Topic A. On the surface, the MPAA's
ratings system seems easy to understand, with its clearly marked R,
PG-13, PG and G ratings for movies. But in reality, the MPAA operates
a shadow rating system that can only be decoded by knowing Hollywood
insiders. If your movie is full of gross-out jokes about flatulence
and penis size--and is made by a major studio with scores of
promotional partners--it can get a PG-13 rating. If your movie deals
with sex from the point of view of smirky teenagers or sultry movie
stars--and is made by a powerful studio with big marketing
dollars--it can get an R rating.</TE>
<TE>   But if your movie deals with sex in a frank or unsettling manner,
as if it were actually close to reality--and it's being released by a
tiny independent distributor--it is almost guaranteed to get an NC-17
rating, a rating that virtually kills any hope of your film being
accepted by major theater chains and advertising buyers. That's what
has happened to "The Rules of Attraction," which is distributed by
Lions Gate, the company known for both its prestige films "Monster's
Ball" and "Amores Perros" and such controversial pictures as
"American Psycho" and "Dogma."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Ortenberg, president of Lions Gate Films Releasing, says the
company plans to release "Rules" in October on as many as 1,500
screens. But to reach that many screens, the film will need an R
rating. Movies that go out unrated, as "Y Tu Mama Tambien" did
earlier this year, have difficulty being booked in more than about
400 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   What rankles the indie film companies isn't just the MPAA ratings
board's inscrutable judgment calls about sex, but what they see as a
double standard in dealing with major studios and independents. The
MPAA is an entity created and controlled by the major movie studios.
The independent companies are not members; they pay a fee to
participate in CARA, the MPAA-affiliated Classification and Ratings
Administration organization that rates films and advertising
material. When a company disputes a ruling by the ratings board, it
goes before an appeals board made up almost exclusively of
representatives from the major studios and theater chains.</TE>
<TE>   "The MPAA is clearly stacked against us," says Ortenberg. "It's
just laughable what they put us through. There's a wholly subjective
set of rules and they are not equally applied."</TE>
<TE>   Historically, studios have used their clout to get their way. In
1966, in the waning days of the Production Code, Warner Bros. avoided
censorship of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" by arguing that the
studio had "a lot of money invested" in the picture.</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, two years after MPAA chief Jack Valenti essentially
created the current ratings system, the steamy "Ryan's Daughter" got
a PG after MGM chief James Aubrey argued that the studio needed the
more lenient rating to survive. Testifying in 1977 before a
congressional subcommittee (holding hearings on--surprise--the
disparity in movie ratings between studios and independents), Valenti
called the "Ryan's Daughter" ruling "one of the tarnishing marks of
the rating system."</TE>
<TE>   The MPAA is always under intense pressure from member studios to
give films a PG-13 rating, which can mean untold millions in extra
box-office revenues; the PG-13 rating itself came about as a way to
deal with the violence in Steven Spielberg's "Indiana Jones and the
Temple of Doom" without giving the movie a more restrictive R rating.
The system's inherent inconsistency can be infuriating. Many parents
were appalled that this summer's "Austin Powers" sequel had been
rated PG-13, despite a nonstop barrage of toilet humor. Time magazine
critic Richard Corliss described the rating as "sleazy," excoriating
Hollywood for its "infectious greed," saying "the only thing dirtier
than the gags in 'Goldmember' is the money that's made from them."</TE>
<TE>   Valenti adamantly denies the charges that the ratings board favors
studio releases. "That's patently a canard," he said phoning Friday
from the Venice Film Festival.</TE>
<TE>   "We've heard complaints from the independents for nearly 34 years,
but everyone complains equally. It all depends on whose ox is gored.
When it comes to the rating of movies, Sumner Redstone and Rupert
Murdoch and Michael Eisner have no more power than the lowest intern
at Lions Gate."</TE>
<TE>   Valenti insists that CARA operates independently from the MPAA,
although he acts as spokesman for both entities and was responsible
for hiring Joan Graves, who heads the board. He also says that
independents are welcome to join the MPAA and have been members in
the past, though he acknowledged that member dues, which can run in
the millions, could limit membership to deep-pocketed studio
conglomerates</TE>
<TE>   The rating system was started to fend off church-related
organizations from rating films themselves, which often led to
community bans. But the ratings board has become the worst kind of
censor itself, exercising its own subjective, often maddeningly
capricious opinions. This is especially true of the board's decisions
involving sexual content.</TE>
<TE>   "Femme Fatale," a stylish Brian De Palma thriller that's being
released in November by Warners, has received an R rating, despite
the presence of female frontal nudity and an explicit sex scene
between stars Antonio Banderas and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos. Yet when
tiny IFC Films took "Y Tu Mama Tambien" before the ratings board, it
got an NC-17 because of a similarly explicit sex scene. Because its
masturbation scene was played for laughs, "American Pie" got an R,
while "Rules" got an NC-17 for a more realistic masturbation scene.</TE>
<TE>   "The MPAA absolutely has different standards for comic sexual
suggestiveness and realistic sexuality," says Bob Berney, who headed
IFC's distribution wing when the company released "Y Tu Mama
Tambien." "It's always about the tone. With 'Y Tu Mama,' they
basically said, 'You can have sex in the movie, but we don't like you
having it for a long time.' "</TE>
<TE>   Avary's biggest beef with the ratings board isn't just its
inconsistency but the way its demands for trims distort the theme of
his film. "This is a film about moral decadence, but if you take out
the bad behavior, you rob the film of its message," he says. "I made
the film because Hollywood teen movies lie about what it's like to be
a teenager. What really disturbs the MPAA is that this film shows the
truth."</TE>
<TE>   The MPAA will never come out and say it, especially since their
deliberations are as closely guarded as Dick Cheney's meetings with
energy company lobbyists, but my guess is the ratings board (who are
all parents) found many of the kids in "Rules" creepy and repellent.
The horny boys in "American Pie" were so much more ... likable.</TE>
<TE>   I guess it shouldn't come as a shock that members of the ratings
board, like many Americans, are squeamish about sex unless it's
played for laughs, as in "American Pie," or given a sleek,
titillating sheen, as in thrillers like "Unfaithful" or "Femme
Fatale." But it's time the board stopped punishing filmmakers for
thinking seriously about sex.</TE>
<TE>   If we can celebrate movies that deal frankly--and often
graphically--with the horror of war or slavery or mental illness,
then we should provide the same respect to artists who grapple with
sex. If not, then the board should be honest enough to admit they'd
really be happier if American movies were all as infantile as a Mike
Myers or Adam Sandler comedy. At least then we'd have a refreshing
dose of candor, not the corrosive kind of hypocrisy that has given
today's rating system the moral heft of a feather boa.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sweet and Hot Music Festival has been a Labor Day weekend
destination for nearly a decade. This year's installment--the
seventh--once again took over most of the Los Angeles Airport
Marriott Hotel, delivering an appealing variety of pre-World War II
jazz and popular music.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday's performances revealed several intriguing aspects about
the music of that era, which generally reached from the Roaring '20s
through the Depression '30s and into the Wartime '40s.</LD>
<LD>   The first was the way music and dancing were inextricably linked.
The second was the vitality of the songs and their interpretations by
different artists. The third was the sense of optimism that was
especially apparent in the consistently buoyant rhythm in the music.
Serving as the soundtrack for a period in which society was grappling
with enormously powerful economic and cultural changes, it was music
that managed to accompany those transitions with a blend of
enthusiasm, confidence and maturity.</LD>
<TE>   It's a fair observation that a substantial portion of the overflow
crowds at the festival probably personally experienced some portion
of the Swing era. But it also was an audience that included numerous
participants still eager to call up the good old days on dance floors
in many of the event's eight venues.</TE>
<TE>   Many dressed in appropriate period outfits, and some of the
dancing was occasionally enlivened by the presence of youthfully
exuberant Swing fans.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's music was far-ranging, embracing the spirited tuba and
washboard stylings of the Reynolds Brothers (grandsons of early film
star Zasu Pitts), dance band rhythms of the Fulton Street Jazz Band
and the Mardi Gras Band, the Dixieland of Yoshio Toyama and his
Saints and the western Swing of Igor's Jazz Cowboys. With a few
anachronistic moments such as a "California Cool" set by trumpeter
Jack Sheldon's quartet and a thoughtful tribute to Lionel Hampton by
vibist Isla Eckinger's trio, the kaleidoscopic diversity of the
festival becomes apparent.</TE>
<TE>   One of the further pleasures of such a colorful event is the
occasional opportunity to experience previously unfamiliar but
first-rate talent. On Sunday, it was the singing of Rebecca Kilgore.
Although she has long been a fixture on the Swing revival circuit,
her attractive combination of a honeyed sound and brisk, impeccable
phrasing clearly deserves to be heard in a more stylistically
far-ranging musical setting.</TE>
<TE>   A convincing appearance in the highly competitive Diva Summit, in
which she was surrounded by the likes of Yve Evans, Lillian Boutte
and others, increased my curiosity to hear more from this talented
vocal artist.</TE>
<TE>   Appropriately, the evening wound down with a spontaneous jam
session in the hotel lobby. Driven by players from the Japanese
Saints, it was also open to anyone who showed up with an
instrument--a further testament to the pleasures of the Sweet and Hot
Festival.</TE>

<HD>50 Years Later, Still Singin' Praises of a Classic</HD>
<DH>Movies* 'Singin' in the Rain,' called by some the greatest
musical ever filmed, is being honored with a screening and reunion of
cast and crew.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Singin' in the Rain" is considered by many to be the greatest movie
musical ever made. But it began rather inauspiciously, according to
the writing team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green.</LD>
<LD>   "We were under contract with MGM," recalls Comden. "Our producer,
Arthur Freed, who had been a very good lyricist, said, 'Kids'--he
called us kids--'you are going to write a movie called "Singin' in
the Rain" and put all of my songs in it.' So what we were handed was
a stack of sheet music."</LD>
<LD>   Before becoming one of the top movie-musical producers at MGM,
Freed penned numerous songs with his partner, Nacio Herb Brown, for
early movie musicals, including "Singin' in the Rain," "Broadway
Melody," "You Were Meant for Me" and "You Are My Lucky Star."</LD>
<TE>   "We had to come up with a movie out of nowhere," says Green. "It
could be safely described as getting someone's catalog of songs that
had no relationship with each other [to] make up a movie. It was not
a difficult task; it was impossible. When we were finished, we felt
triumphant. We were very happy with our work."</TE>
<TE>   Though it only received two Academy Award nominations--for best
supporting actress (Jean Hagen) and scoring (Lennie Hayton)--"Singin'
in the Rain" has continued to grow in stature and popularity since
its release 50 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is celebrating the
movie with a special anniversary screening of the newly restored
digital presentation and a cast and crew reunion Thursday. Scheduled
to appear are stars Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, Cyd Charisse
and Comden. (Green recently broke his leg, so his status is
uncertain.)</TE>
<TE>   Because Freed and Brown wrote songs for early movies, Comden and
Green decided to set the story in the wild days of the late 1920s,
when Hollywood was moving from silent films to talkies.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Kelly, at the apex of his powers, stars as Don Lockwood, a
former vaudevillian turned silent-screen heartthrob who sees his
movie career going up in flames because his leading lady, Lena Lamont
(Hagen), has a voice that sounds like thousands of fingernails on a
chalk board and the studio wants their newest picture to be a
musical. Don, though, comes up with an ingenious plan to save his
career.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor plays Don's best friend, Cosmo, and a very young Debbie
Reynolds plays Kathy, an ingenue who helps Don and falls in love with
him.</TE>
<TE>   Directed and choreographed by Kelly and Stanley Donen, who had
done the 1949 hit "On the Town," and written by Comden and Green,
"Singin' in the Rain" boasts some of the most magical dance numbers
ever captured on screen. Among them are Kelly's deliciously romantic
proclaiming of love in "Singin' in the Rain," O'Connor's hilariously
acrobatic "Make 'Em Laugh," and the lavish, innovative "Broadway
Melody" ballet that features Charisse as a vamp who hooks hoofer
Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Home Video is releasing a new two-disc DVD set Sept. 24. It
features the restored film; commentary from the participants; two
documentaries, including "What a Glorious Feeling" about the making
of the film; excerpts from many original MGM musicals in which the
Freed-Brown songs were introduced; scoring stage sessions; a stills
gallery; and Reynolds' outtake musical number, "You Are My Lucky
Star."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the script is the star of this movie," says Peter
Fitzgerald, the writer-director and producer of "What a Glorious
Feeling."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the performances are standout amazing, but I believe the
script is really the engine this movie relies upon. It is such genius
storytelling.... It was very much a collaboration."</TE>
<TE>   Comden and Green were longtime friends of both Kelly and Donen.
"We had known each other since the start of Gene's career," says
Comden. "We knew him socially and personally. Naturally, we were
thrilled to write for him. They both knew the way our minds worked,
and we had a lot of crazy ideas. Somebody else might have balked at
them, but Gene and Stanley knew us and took it a step further. We had
entire shorthand among us. It was a very happy collaboration."</TE>
<TE>   Originally, Freed wanted his friend Oscar Levant to play the role
of Cosmo. Levant, who resembled a rumpled suit, was a noted pianist
and cynical wit. He had played Kelly's composer-buddy in the 1951
Oscar-winner "An American in Paris."</TE>
<TE>   Levant, says Fitzgerald, "was a full-swing drug addict and one of
the great pessimists of all time. He was wonderful in 'The Band
Wagon' and 'An American in Paris.' " But he was wrong for the young,
carefree Cosmo.</TE>
<TE>   And Kelly didn't want just a pal for this film; he was looking for
someone who could literally go toe to toe with him in the dance
numbers</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor, a former vaudeville performer, was best known as a
straight man to a talking mule in the popular "Francis" movies
produced at Universal. He had also starred in numerous youth-oriented
musicals at Universal, including "Chip Off the Old Block," and was a
host on the television variety series "The Colgate Comedy Hour."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the part was open at the time, and they said, 'Get that
kid,' " says O'Connor. "We were all having a very good time, though
it was difficult because of the dance routines; there were so many
routines in the picture. They had to keep on schedule, so we would
finish one routine in the daytime and then go immediately into the
next one. So you never knew which routine you were doing."</TE>
<TE>   Trying to find the right Freed-Brown song for O'Connor's solo was
a challenge for the filmmakers. The creaky "The Wedding of the
Painted Doll" was suggested but was quickly nixed. The creative team
agreed they wanted something like Cole Porter's jaunty "Be a Clown"
that Judy Garland and Kelly performed in "The Pirate." So Freed and
Brown wrote a new song, "Make 'Em Laugh," that sounds suspiciously
like "Be a Clown."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a direct rip-off of 'Be a Clown,' " says Fitzgerald.
"Nobody made a stink about it, certainly not Cole Porter. It was a
tremendous success. You'll notice when O'Connor falls on his back,
there is a long, slow fade for applause until the next scene because
it was a showstopper. Kelly could have very well have cut it, but he
left it in. He wanted everyone to shine."</TE>
<TE>   One whole day's worth of shooting on "Make 'Em Laugh," which finds
O'Connor wrestling with a dummy, back-flipping off walls and making
crazy faces, was actually ruined.</TE>
<TE>   "When they filmed it, no one checked the aperture of the camera
properly," says O'Connor. "It was all fogged up. So the whole day's
shooting was ruined. We had to go back and do it again. But for me it
kind of helped, because I knew it better and I was able to do better
in the number."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly choreographed the numbers to show off both his and
O'Connor's differences and strengths. "He was an athletic dancer and
I am an athletic dancer," says O'Connor. "But he was more ballet and
athletic, and it was always strictly comedy for me except for a few
things I did with Vera-Ellen in 'Call Me Madam.' "</TE>
<TE>   Charisse wasn't supposed to do the "Broadway Melody" number in
"Singin' in the Rain." Carol Haney, then one of Kelly's dance
assistants, had been doing the number in rehearsals.</TE>
<TE>   Recalls Charisse: "But it just so happened that Arthur Freed met
me one day walking into the rehearsal hall and he turned around and
said 'Cyd, how would you like to dance in the big finale with Gene
Kelly?'</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, I just had to stop breathing, because everyone was
saying on the whole lot what a great picture 'Singin' in the Rain'
was. I said I would love to. Arthur Freed had signed me under
contract and he was my mentor. He was always looking out for me."</TE>
<TE>   Charisse describes Kelly as a brilliant and creative dance partner
and choreographer. "People don't understand that he did as much as he
did in the choreography areas," she says. "He would set it up all
beautifully. I worked with Fred Astaire, and he was a different
personalty. Gene was a man of the street and Fred liked to be the
elegant dancer. [Astaire] did his own choreography with Hermes Pan,
but he was a not a choreographer for other people like Gene was."</TE>
<TE>   One of the hardest aspects of doing the movie, she says, was
learning how to smoke for one scene.</TE>
<TE>   "It came to the point where I had to be the vamp and smoke this
long cigarette with the smoke coming out of my nose," Charisse says.
"I had never smoked a cigarette in my life, so Stanley said, 'We are
going to stop everything' and they had to teach me how to smoke a
cigarette. That took some time. I went home a little sick to my
stomach."</TE>
<TE>   Though the film received great reviews and was a big box-office
hit, it was overshadowed by Freed's production of "An American in
Paris," which won the 1951 Academy Award for best film.</TE>
<TE>   "It stood under the shadow of 'An American in Paris,'" says
Fitzgerald. "But when I show 'Singin' in the Rain' to someone who has
never seen it before, they are just astounded by it. It's completely
fresh and entertaining and up to the minute as anything. It is the
eternal classic."</TE>

<HD>The Blockbuster Season Flickers to a Close</HD>
<DH>Movies* After a sizzling start spawned records at the box
office, summer fizzled as audiences found better things to do.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 2002 summer movie season opened with a roar and closed with a
whimper, with most of the blockbuster hits front-loaded in the torrid
first months. Whether the movies were less appealing or audiences
were saturated, attendance dropped off sharply in August.</LD>
<LD>   Box-office records were set--from the beginning of May through the
end of August, box-office gross was up about 10.4% from last
year--but there was less cheery news as well.</LD>
<LD>   Most family films flopped, and the playing field was so crowded
with big-budget popcorn movies that often they had only one weekend
to bring in an audience--usually teens--before another one came
along.</LD>
<TE>   "The speed with which films came and went was astonishing," said
20th Century Fox co-chairman Jim Gianopolus. "Summer is a great
playing time, but I think it does speak to the fact that the movies
have to deliver and satisfy audiences or you are history."</TE>
<TE>   History was certainly made by Sony's "Spider-Man," which opened
with an astonishing $114-million weekend en route to a $403-million
domestic gross. It was the start of a spectacular summer for Sony,
which also had $100-million-plus hits with "Men in Black II," "Mr.
Deeds" and "XXX." Sony films took in more than $1 billion in ticket
money this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Spider-Man" was followed two weeks later by Fox's "Star Wars:
Episode II Attack of the Clones" which--despite mixed reviews--ended
up taking in more than $300 million in domestic ticket sales. That
kicked off a winning streak for so-called "franchise" films like "Men
in Black II" and "Austin Powers in Goldmember,"</TE>
<TE>   By August, however, box office tailed off sharply, with many
weekends falling well below year-ago ticket sales.</TE>
<TE>   M. Night Shyamalan's sci-fi thriller "Signs" was the end-of-summer
breakout hit--it's on track to gross more than $200 million--but most
other major studio films, including Universal's "Blue Crush,"
Paramount's "Serving Sara" and New Line Cinema's "Simone," had less
than stellar openings.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the relatively slow business in August, audiences this
summer could find a broader than usual spectrum of movies at the
local megaplex. Theater owners saw good business by offering
independent films alongside the blockbusters.</TE>
<TE>   "I think truly this summer there was room for everybody," said
Jeff Blake, Sony's head of domestic and foreign distribution and
marketing. "A lot of movies held up very well, both from the level of
"Spider-Man" to a lot of little movies."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Pokorski, executive vice president and head film buyer for
Pacific Theaters, said business was good this summer, particularly
because surprise hits like "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" (a $5-million
film that had earned an estimated $82 million as of Monday) brought
audiences back again and again. He says he has not seen that kind of
repeat business since "Titanic" in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what that points to is that people are looking for good
stories. That is the biggest problem with Hollywood, that they are so
wrapped up with the blockbuster that they forget about the story,"
said Pokorski, who oversees the Grove, the Paseo theaters in
Pasadena, the Arc Light and the Galleria Stadium 16 at the Sherman
Oaks Galleria.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually you don't see these kinds of films in the summer. I think
that what you are finding is that the smaller films are catching a
bigger audience. And we have created access in all of our theaters
for all those types of movies."</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros. president of domestic distribution, Dan Fellman, said
the studio figured "Insomnia" and "The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya
Sisterhood," both of which were released in early summer, would serve
as good counterprogramming because they were aimed at the adult,
rather than teen, market. The strategy paid off; the movies have
grossed $67 million and $68 million, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at the competition, and they were the usual suspects of
sequels and popcorn action movies and family movies," he said. "We
felt we had an opportunity to open up some upscale adult movies."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that some smaller movies, including "My Big Fat Greek
Wedding," "Monsoon Wedding," "Y Tu Mama Tambien" and "The Good Girl,"
did so well this summer could be good news for adult audiences
seeking more introspective fare next summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of crowding adult movies into the fall and holiday
seasons, I think this opens up one more season for the adult
audience," said Jim Tharp, head of distribution for DreamWorks, whose
moody drama, "Road to Perdition," had grossed almost $100 million as
of Monday. That, however, does not mean audiences will see fewer
adrenaline-fueled seasonal blockbusters next summer.</TE>
<TE>   Already planned are "Charlie's Angels 2," "The Matrix Reloaded"
and sequels to "XXX," "Scooby-Doo" and "Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   As usual for summer hits, most of the movies that did well at the
box office were, in the industry jargon, "critic-proof."</TE>
<TE>   Poor to mixed reviews for "Austin Powers in Goldmember,"
"Scooby-Doo" and "Men in Black II" did not affect their box office;
each took in more than $100 million. "We are not talking about
reviews," said Warner Bros.' Fellman, who worked on the "Scooby-Doo"
release. "We are talking about results."</TE>
<TE>   It was not a great summer for family movies. With the notable
exceptions of "Scooby-Doo" and Disney's "Lilo &amp; Stitch," most films,
like Disney's "The Country Bears," Warner Bros. "The Powerpuff Girls"
and Sony's "Stuart Little 2," flopped at the box office. Although
Miramax's "Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams" made a healthy $69
million, it never reached the box-office heights of the original "Spy
Kids," which in 2001 took in almost $120 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The real casualty of the summer has been the G or PG movie, which
attempted to capture the interest of the family," said Marc Shmuger,
vice chairman of Universal Pictures. "But their interest was
gravitating toward the tent-pole PG-13 title."</TE>

<HD>A Year Later, a Daunting Task</HD>
<DH>Television faces the challenge of providing programming
that's fresh and meaningful on the 9-11 tragedy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In just half a century of mass consumption, television has evolved
into an all-purpose appliance for modern living. It's used to
baby-sit, to educate, to titillate. It's an easy laugh, a guilty
pleasure, a vicarious thrill. It's a 36-inch nightlight.</LD>
<LD>   But now TV finds itself taking on an infinitely more challenging
task: to remind people of an event no one has forgotten, and to do so
with fresh context and perspective for an audience that has been
inundated with similar albeit scattershot efforts for nearly a year.</LD>
<LD>   And so with the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
still days away, the onslaught of programming has begun. For a medium
that flourishes by providing tidy resolutions to messy plot lines in
60 minutes or less, it's going to be an interesting couple of weeks.</LD>
<TE>   With huge blocks of time committed across networks and cable, no
angle is being left unexplored, including some that probably should
have been. For every brilliantly conceived and executed show such as
PBS' "Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero," which examines, among other
issues, "Where was God on Sept. 11?," there are programs such as the
History Channel's "Relics From the Rubble," which shows how tough
it's been for museum curators to select just the right wreckage for
their upcoming 9/11 exhibits. One can't help wondering how the
gift-shop ideas are coming along.</TE>
<TE>   The need to establish historical touchstones for future
generations is real, but viewing the process by which they are
assembled comes off as largely inconsequential.</TE>
<TE>   That's the challenge for all the programming, because the calendar
has raised the bar for what viewers will be expecting.</TE>
<TE>   The sheer breadth of viewpoints and the eloquence with which they
are expressed are what make "Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero" a rare
achievement in documenting a national dialogue. Set against the
still-shattering images of Sept. 11, the variety of perspectives are
as startling as they are revelatory. There are religious leaders,
atheists, survivors, and the friends and loved ones of some of the
people who perished that day. Their words are by turns bitter and
hopeful, heartbreaking and uplifting.</TE>
<TE>   Several offered their takes on two World Trade Center office
workers who were seen joining hands before leaping to their deaths
far below.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most powerful prayer I can imagine," said writer and
English professor Brian Doyle. "It's everything we're capable of
against horror and loss and tragedy. It's what makes me believe that
we're not fools to believe in God."</TE>
<TE>   And then there was author Ian McEwan: "To me, it just seemed the
bleakest possible image of the whole thing," he said. "Humans brought
to the furthest edge of despair. I found no hope in that at all. If
there is a God, he's a very indifferent God."</TE>
<TE>   Some programs, such as the History Channel's "Inside Islam,"
appear to seek an easing of tensions by emphasizing the commonalities
of religion and culture, particularly at the top and bottom of the
program. It points out that Christianity, Judaism and Islam all claim
a common patriarch in the figure of Abraham, and that the Koran, the
holy text of Islam, refers to Jews and Christians as fellow "people
of the book," namely, the Bible.</TE>
<TE>   Yet between these conciliatory bookending segments, the
documentary lays out in bloody detail the religious and territorial
power struggles that regularly ripped across Europe, the Middle East
and Asia through the centuries.</TE>
<TE>   "Caught in the Crossfire" seems to have a similar aim, showing
three Arab Americans as just plain folk as they go about their New
York City jobs as a policeman, a journalist and a Christian pastor.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't change where I come from," says NYPD Officer Ahmed
Nasser, who moved to the U.S. from Yemen in 1986. "But I'm 100%
American. And I'm 100% Arab."</TE>
<TE>   If you feel the need to revisit Sept. 11 in its rawest form,
there's A&amp;E's "Minute by Minute: The Attack on the Pentagon." The
documentary delivers, as advertised, a tense account of that day from
inside America's military center, which represents a bit of a
departure from the WTC-centric view of most of these specials.</TE>
<TE>   Most also manage to at least touch on some of the things that make
this country worth standing up for, but none in more evocative detail
than ABC's six-part "In Search of America," narrated by Peter
Jennings. The show measures how the founding fathers' experimental
concept has been working out, and although the topics aren't tied to
the events of Sept. 11, strictly speaking, the timing feels just
right.</TE>
<TE>   "Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero" airs at 9 on PBS; "In Search of
America" airs at 10 on ABC; "Relics From the Rubble" airs at 10 on
the History Channel; "Inside Islam" airs Wednesday at 9 on the
History Channel; "Caught in the Crossfire" airs Wednesday at 10 on
PBS.</TE>

<LD>Jeffrey Paga's college pals had big plans for the evening, and those
plans didn't include hanging around the dorm room with their heads
stuck in a book.</LD>
<LD>   But Paga, who had felt fine all day, suddenly wasn't in the mood
to join them. He felt the flu coming on and figured he'd better stay
in, take some over-the-counter medicine and hit the sack early.</LD>
<LD>   By the next morning, however, he was dead, the victim of
meningococcal disease, a rare but growing threat that has doubled
among 15-to-24-year-olds in the last decade.</LD>
<TE>   Adam Busuttil was one of the luckier ones. Like Paga, a student at
Michigan State University, Busuttil fell ill with flu-like symptoms
that rapidly grew so severe he was admitted to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember seeing a respirator, and that was the last thing I
remembered for about a week," he says in tonight's "Nova" special
report, "Killer Disease on Campus" (KCET-TV, 8 p.m.).</TE>
<TE>   Busuttil eventually recovered, but as the camera pans over him,
you can see he didn't come through the experience unscathed: The tips
of his fingers had to be removed after being damaged by the rampaging
infection.</TE>
<TE>   Often incorrectly referred to as meningitis, meningococcal disease
takes several forms, of which meningitis, though serious, has a death
rate of only 5%, compared with 40% for meningococcal septicemia.</TE>
<TE>   The young--with immature immune systems that can be further
compromised by college-age rites such as close-quarters living, late
hours and drinking--are most susceptible.</TE>
<TE>   A vaccine is available, but tonight's program says the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention has ruled that the relatively small
number of cases (3,000 per year in the U.S.) do not warrant a
mandatory inoculation program, saying it wouldn't "be cost
effective."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's worth the money to you.</TE>

<LD>It's an average late-summer weekday in Hollywood. At the intersection
of La Brea Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard, tourists mill about the
Walk of Fame, keen for anything related to movie-making. Aside from a
few famous names in the sidewalk, there is nothing in sight. Three
blocks away, however, the crew of the forthcoming NBC crime series
"Boomtown" has commandeered much of Orange Grove Avenue, a tree-lined
street of tidy bungalows, many of them trimmed by white picket
fences.</LD>
<LD>   The neighborhood looks familiar, primarily because it's a popular
place to film, says Jodi Strong, whose company (Entertainment
Industry Development Corp.) monitors all location shooting in Los
Angeles and unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   "It's got a great look," she says of the street as she pulls her
SUV to the curb. Strong and her boss, Darryl Seif, walk up to the
shoot. Spotting them, the director shouts: "Nobody should be on the
sidewalk!"</LD>
<TE>   The director doesn't realize whom she's addressing. Usually, when
Seif and Strong show up on a set in Los Angeles, they inspire the
same type of paranoia that a police officer might. That's because
Entertainment Industry Development Corp. is contracted by the city
and the county to ensure that filming doesn't violate any laws or
annoy the neighborhood. Theirs is a big job, considering there are
150 location shoots taking place on any given day here. And it's good
business for the city and county. Location filming in Los Angeles
generates about $4.7 million a year for both governments.</TE>
<TE>   When the location manager's assistant spots Seif and Strong she
looks apologetic and quickly motions them over. "Our house is your
house," she says.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a busy summer for filming in Los Angeles. The number
of location shoots in July was 38% higher this year than in 2001,
Seif said. Last year, the pending actor and writer strikes slowed
summer productions. Then, Sept. 11 brought most everything to a halt.</TE>
<TE>   This year, downtown Los Angeles, where a third of all the filming
in the city takes place, has been crowded with big-budget shoots
including "Terminator III," Jim Carrey's new film "Bruce Almighty,"
"Charlie's Angels 2" featuring Demi Moore, and "Torque," a biker
picture starring Ice Cube. Later this month the crew for "The Italian
Job," a remake of the 1969 film, will be filming throughout the city.
It stars Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron.</TE>
<TE>   On this day's "Boomtown" shoot, the biggest concern seems to be
getting the actors to leave a peach-colored bungalow on cue. "What
seems to be the problem?" the director asks. "Is the little girl too
afraid to get going?" Tomorrow Seif and Strong have bigger fish to
fry, like deciding whether the "Charlie's Angels 2" crew can shut
down Hollywood Boulevard for a night to film an action sequence. "The
companies generally ask for the world," Seif noted. "And we bring
their feet back to the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Fade In</TE>
<TE>   Director Phillip Noyce knows an effective opening shot. By cell
phone from Telluride, Colo., he described the scene:</TE>
<TE>   "It was 3:30 in the morning and I was in my Hollywood Hills house,
behind my gate and wall, secure in the knowledge I would be working
on the next blockbuster movie. The phone rang. It was this strange
female voice."</TE>
<TE>   The voice told him an old story: I've got the perfect script, and
you're the perfect director.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Oh my God,' I thought, someone's penetrated my wall, worse
still, she's a writer and she's ringing in the middle of the night,"
he said. "I just wanted to get rid of her."</TE>
<TE>   The voice in the night belonged to Australia-based Christine
Olsen, who was pitching the true story of three aboriginal girls who
in 1931 traveled through the desert to escape a camp in western
Australia where they had been forced to live more than a thousand
miles from their parents.</TE>
<TE>   Based on a book by Doris Pilkington and Nugi Garimara, Olsen's
script described a time when aboriginal girls were taken from their
homes by a government-sponsored program and taught to be domestic
servants.</TE>
<TE>   After reading it, Noyce found himself in New York, talking to
Harrison Ford about a movie adaptation of a Tom Clancy book, and
realizing that "it was this real story of the three little kids that
kept spinning in my head--a real story as opposed to a manufactured
one."</TE>
<TE>   The little movie, "Rabbit-Proof Fence," about "three seemingly
powerless girls taking on the system," beat out the big one, said the
Australian director, who didn't work on Clancy's "The Sum of All
Fears." He previously directed "Clear and Present Danger" and his
other project this year was "The Quiet American."</TE>
<TE>   Noyce said his heart just wasn't in "the Herculean effort of
another $100-million movie, working with the studio system, and the
star system." There was "this tiny little film that my heart tells me
I should be making."The movie, being screened next week during the
Toronto Film Festival with a November premiere in Los Angeles, stars
Kenneth Branagh and David Gulpilil.</TE>
<TE>   When it opened in Australia earlier this year, the Miramax
marketing campaign created a controversy with a poster reading: "What
if the government kidnapped your daughter? It happened every week in
Australia from 1905 to 1971."</TE>
<TE>   Australian government officials said the movie gave an unfair
portrait of the country. One official distributed leaflets warning
constituents against seeing the movie.</TE>
<TE>   The movie provoked controversy because it challenged perceptions
about Australia's past, Noyce said. "The truth has been the opposite
of the Crocodile Hunter, the Mick Dundee image [that] they like to
project."</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing. I'm an itinerant singer
and guitar picker. I am what they used to call a troubadour."</TE>

<LD>HOLD THE ENLIGHTENMENT</LD>
<LD>   More Travel, Less Bliss</LD>
<LD>   By Tim Cahill</LD>
<TE>   Villard</TE>
<TE>   300 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Reading "Hold the Enlightenment: More Travel, Less Bliss," a
collection of essays by adventure travel writer Tim Cahill ("Pass the
Butterworms"), is like visiting a theme park that offers thrills for
all types, from easygoing Dumbo-caliber rides to the most
hair-raising roller coasters. Throughout these exploits--a midnight
trek through an Australian eucalyptus forest in search of a platypus,
hiking up the side of an active volcano in Ecuador, delving into the
killer psyches of dolphins--Cahill entertains, makes light of his
endeavors, and in his more thought-provoking pieces, investigates
those things in life that most frighten us.</TE>
<TE>   The 30 essays could be rated by the level of stomach-clenching
engagement each offers. On the most primary level are pieces that are
airy, if a bit gruesome, designed to garner guffaws. "Bug Scream,"
for example, tells of Cahill's many adventures with insects and bugs,
including the salt-hungry bees that take up residence in his sweaty
T-shirt, making their way toward his armpits as he treks through the
Congo. "Gorillas in Our Schools" recounts Cahill's classroom
adventures, teaching kids about wildlife and goading them into acting
like gorillas, while "Culinary Schadenfreude" highlights the strange
foods Cahill's eaten in foreign lands: snake in China, rooster head
soup in the Peruvian Andes and baked turtle lung in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   The next level on the thrill meter is made up of genuine
heart-pounding adventure tales. Cahill gets in the water with great
white sharks in South Africa, "one of the few places on earth where
the risk-obsessed can go to put their lives on the line," and
searches for the presumed extinct Caspian tiger in the mountains of
Turkey on the basis of rumors. He rafts through a seemingly pristine
stretch of the Columbia River in Washington which is also a nuclear
waste wilderness, and in "The Caravan of White Gold," hunts down
ancient salt mines in the Sahara while managing to lose one of his
fellow travelers. These escapades rely primarily on
hazardous-to-one's-health quests--reader adrenalin pumps fast and
furious throughout--as well as on Cahill's sharp writing and wry
humor. (Stranded in Black Rock Desert, temperature 110-degrees-plus,
miles from any civilization, his only map blown away and his truck
tires flat, he describes the solitude as "a little like bliss, only
hotter."</TE>
<TE>   The book's title is a jab at the search for enlightenment
characteristic of many travelers. Cahill's not after wisdom or
transcendence, he protests. Besides, "[e]nlightenment ... is a poor
career path for a writer." Yet there's a layer of sagacity and depth
suspiciously similar to enlightenment in a number of the
pieces--those I would consider the hairiest of the hairy, essays in
which the prickles raised on the back of one's neck have nothing to
do with risky behavior. Here, Cahill hikes far into the subterranean
territory of the human spirit, probing perils endemic to our mortal
condition.</TE>
<TE>   "This Teeming Ark," for example, profiles Cahill's 10-day journey
down the Congo river on a barge filled beyond capacity with people,
animals and dinner-to-be (since there's no refrigeration on the
barge, food is kept alive until mealtime), as he imagines the future
of the human race with overpopulation threatening. "Fully
Unprepared," is a meditation on human frailty, focusing on the trauma
of his own back surgery and the death of his first wife from a
disease that twisted her fingers and wrists and dissolved the bones
of her legs. In "Panic," Cahill sets out to examine the "high comedy"
of being a fearless adventurer who suffers from debilitating anxiety
attacks and ends up writing a heartfelt, incisive contemplation on
impairment. The collection's final entry, "Trusty and Grace" is an
emotion-laden piece about psalms, loyal dogs and the way in which
religious belief, however loosely grasped, has formed Cahill's view
of human suffering. "I tend to see the wilderness through the broken
prism of my faith," he confides. It is the pieces in which Cahill
wrestles not with great white sharks but with the vicissitudes of the
human plight that the book flashes with luminescence. In trying to
make light of enlightenment, he gives moments of hard-won wisdom,
along with insights that last longer than any amusement park ride.</TE>

<HD>Here's Picnicking With You, Kid</HD>
<DH>A film classic is a mellow draw for an outdoor film series
in Long Beach</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEVERLY BEYETTE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a drive-in movie with pizza and hot dogs, but no wheels. And,
as one moviegoer said, there was no danger of "driving off with the
speaker still in your window."</LD>
<LD>   Three thousand people thronged Marina Green along the waterfront
in Long Beach on Friday night to just enjoy being in Southern
California on a balmy late summer evening. They came to socialize and
to picnic and, oh, yes, to watch an American classic, "Casablanca,"
on a 20-by-30-foot outdoor screen.</LD>
<LD>   It was the third--and to date the most popular--in the Long Beach
Outdoor Film Series being presented on Friday nights through Sept. 13
by Partners of Parks, a community organization that funds programs
ranging from literacy to gang prevention.</LD>
<TE>   The crowd began arriving as soon as the gates opened at 6. They
came bearing beach chairs and blankets, picnic baskets and wine
buckets. They came in groups, they came as families and they came as
couples, who cuddled under blankets as night fell.</TE>
<TE>   Some simply plopped takeout pizza down on their beach towels;
others set up little tables with white cloths, wineglasses and
candles. Still others eschewed the picnic idea and queued up at the
concessionaires' booths for egg rolls, barbecue and popcorn shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   Dianne McNinch and Michael Blasdell of Long Beach couldn't decide
whether they were in Casablanca or Hawaii. They hadn't exactly come
for the waters, but they did bring a bubble machine--and a string of
colorful lights in fish shapes. "We figured tropical," said Blasdell.
"I love outdoor entertainment," said McNinch, and "since we live in
the best city in the world, why not enjoy it?"</TE>
<TE>   Rhonda Rivera of Lakewood brought her mother, Connie Meyer,
visiting from Scottsdale, Ariz., where, Rivera observed, "they don't
go outside" during the summer. Her daughters Roxanne, 11, and Erica,
10, were enjoying chips, dip and lollipops while waiting for their
dad, Charlie, who was braving the headache of parking.</TE>
<TE>   But small annoyances aside, a party spirit prevailed. In the front
row, a multigenerational group was celebrating a birthday. Said
Justine Friend, "My son used to take the TV outside and we'd barbecue
and all the neighbors would come. When we heard about this, we
thought it's better than TV." Would anyone care for grapes, or
perhaps shrimp cocktail?</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the few things you can bring high school kids to and
it's cool," said her friend Barbara Strong. In the spirit of things,
daughter Brooke, 14, borrowed a pale mink stole to toss over her
sweatpants and T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   A band played until dark, when the movie began. They played rock
and, of course, they played "As Time Goes By" and "Knock on Wood,"
which Dooley Wilson plays at Rick's cafe in the film.</TE>
<TE>   The Henderson family--Pam and Shonte and three kids--pitched a pup
tent, where baby Paejah, 1, could sleep peacefully while Ilsa and
Rick's destiny played out on screen.</TE>
<TE>   Way in the back, a tailgate party of sorts was in progress,
complete with a proper picnic table. "An extended softball team and
friends of friends," explained Jerry Walls, who'd made baked ziti but
confessed that "Albertsons made the chicken." At 49, the oldest in
the group of about 20, he also was one of the few who'd seen
"Casablanca," and he'd seen it about eight times.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, many people had come not as "Casablanca" fans, but
simply to take part in a big community picnic. Not atypical was
Sandra Abbott, who said, "I don't know what it's about. All I know is
it's Humphrey Bogart. I don't even know who the chick is." Her
mother, Judy, had never seen it either, but their friend Lillian
Sanchez had seen the movie "maybe 20 times" and has it on video.</TE>
<TE>   A group of a dozen friends were feasting on pizza and beer--er,
make that "apple juice," said one, noting that bringing alcohol to
the event was not encouraged.</TE>
<TE>   These friends--among whom are a software developer, a nurse, a
dietitian, a voice-over actress, a tile contractor, a high school
music teacher and a microbiologist--call themselves "the St. Matthew
crew," for a Catholic church in Long Beach where they worship and
where, public relations man Kevin Irion observed to appreciative
laughter, "they don't shut the door as we're approaching."</TE>
<TE>   Tony Umphenour, the microbiologist, is a cantor at the church.
"It's just fun to sit with your friends and say, 'Here's looking at
you....' "At 8 p.m., while there still were long lines at the food
booths--and a few people were squabbling with those behind them over
whether their chairs were blocking the screen--the film began rolling
in glorious black and white. The complimentary birthday cake marking
the 60th anniversary of "Casablanca" had been devoured.</TE>
<TE>   There were palm trees on screen and palm trees framing the huge
screen, silhouetted against a rosy sky. On one side, lights twinkled
in the city skyscrapers. On the other, the triple stacks of the Queen
Mary were illuminated. It was magical.</TE>
<TE>   The fee? $5 for those who could pay, no charge for those who could
not. Darren Held, executive director of the sponsoring Long Beach
Outdoor Film Series, said he hopes to clear at least $3,000 from each
event in the series for Partners of Parks. "Some pay a buck or two,
and that's fine."</TE>
<TE>   The series began Aug. 16, with "The Wizard of Oz," which drew a
crowd of 2,100. Attendance dipped to 1,500 for the Aug. 23 film,
"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me." Coming this Friday: "Pearl
Harbor." In marking Sept. 11, Held said, "we wanted to do a movie
that showed tragedy and triumph." The evening will be a bit of an
extravaganza, with a National Guard color guard, a parade of military
costumes from different wars, Pearl Harbor survivors and a Gen.
George Patton impersonator as emcee. The series will close Sept. 13
with "Shrek."</TE>
<TE>   Call it nostalgia, or a yearning for simpler, more secure times.
Whatever, one thing Held has learned is that "people just love the
classics. And there's a good chance they've never seen those classics
on the big screen."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, not one that is 20 by 30 feet, framed by palm trees and
a stone's toss from the Queen Mary.</TE>

<HD>Cafe Ole: L.A. Blend</HD>
<DH>Though Spanish predominates, the ambience is fluid at three
uniquely home-grown, Eastside coffeehouses</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like the aroma from a hundred cafes con leche, the sentimental
strains of an old Mexican ballad hang in the air outside Angeles
Bohemios Cafe and Gallery. It's Tuesday, Spanish-language open-mike
night, and the regulars sit tapping their feet and quietly humming
along as another nostalgic aria pierces the dull roar of Sunset
Boulevard traffic.</LD>
<LD>   Pedro, a big man with a thick mustache and beatific smile,
caresses the mike and launches into a polyrhythmic lover's lament.
Tonight nostalgia rules at this pan-Latino coffeehouse straddling the
area between Echo Park and Silver Lake. In days to come, the
prevailing mood will change many times, as Angeles Bohemios mixes
poetry readings with flamenco classes, Andean folk music with an
evening of protest songs. On Sunday morning you may encounter a
religious group planning strategy. But the pressed sandwiches, fruit
turnovers and rich, smooth coffee will be constants.</LD>
<TE>   Bug-eyed from too much industrial-strength brew and working
14-hour days, it can be easy for Americans to forget that
coffeehouses once were places to chill out and think, rather than
places to get wired and plug in your laptop. They were warm, funky
venues for connecting with long novels, politics, ideas and
intellectual comrades-in-arms--or maybe just the morning crossword
puzzle--versus today's soulless chain cafe-marts, with their
warmed-over hipster attitude and prefab consumerist sophistication
("How about a World Beat CD compilation to go with your Sumatran
skinny Frappuccino, sir?").</TE>
<TE>   Thankfully, three home-grown Eastside coffeehouses--Angeles
Bohemios, Espresso Mi Cultura Books and Coffee, and Luna Tierra
Sol--stand apart from the generic mise-en-scenes and global ambitions
of brand-name java joints. Not coincidentally, as their names
indicate, all are places where Spanish is regularly spoken, but the
sensibility is fluid and polyglot. (Translation: You'll find Al Borde
stacked next to the L.A. Weekly, and the clientele at these cafes can
be as mixed as the metropolis surrounding them.)</TE>
<TE>   Espresso Mi Cultura Books and Coffee, on Hollywood Boulevard in
Thai Town, just west of Western Avenue, might be described as an
Eastside version of Dutton's Brentwood Books, a friendly,
well-lighted hangout for segments of the city's growing Chicano
intelligentsia.</TE>
<TE>   Cartoonists and performance artists, writers and musicians are
among the regulars there craving "Mexican Mocha," a chocolate drink
with a shot of espresso topped with whipped cream, along with the
addictive chocolate-chip biscotti and other baked goods.</TE>
<TE>   Most nights you'll find a few people cruising the bookshelves,
flipping through copies of Rudolfo Anaya's Chicano coming-of-age
classic "Bless Me Ultima" or thumbing a packet of "Diego Rivera Art
Stickers." In one corner a young couple make eyes at each other,
oblivious to the older woman in the tan hat who's perusing a small
memorial art exhibition, "Remembering the Riots," an assemblage of
highly personal, somewhat chilling objects recalling L.A.'s 1992
conflagration.</TE>
<TE>   Political consciousness forms part of the atmospheric substrata at
Espresso Mi Cultura, as it does at the other two venues. But the
emphasis is on empowerment and community-building, not dogma, so that
politics becomes simply one more frothing ingredient in what Chicano
essayist-social critic Richard Rodriguez has described as the
browning of America. As Rodriguez might put it, "The message is the
mocha."</TE>
<TE>   Even activists, however, cannot live by coffee alone; the stomach
needs sterner stuff. Luna Tierra Sol, at the edge of Lafayette Park,
is happy to oblige with a menu that includes breakfast dishes such as
chilaquiles and eggs for $2.75 and lunch and dinner options like
vegetarian enchiladas, smothered in red or green sauce and dished up
with rice and beans--for under five bucks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really speak Spanish," says Priscilla, an upbeat,
third-generation Latina Angeleno, as she slides me my generous plate
of food, "but I dig accents."</TE>
<TE>   At night there's a nice, slouchy, film-noir feel to this
neighborhood, with its '20s and '30s vintage apartment towers and the
venerable Park Plaza Hotel. Luna Tierra Sol reflects this mood, with
its black and white photographs lining the walls of the small, homey
dining area, industrial glass and dark hardwood floors--a decor not
easily patented or franchised. Opposite the small kitchen, a group of
female students chats quietly over a background pulse of rock en
espanol.</TE>
<TE>   A worker-owned business, Luna Tierra Sol keeps its prices low and
its sympathies with L.A.'s working classes. It's in the process of
opening a sister cafe near Cal State L.A., in the heart of the City
Terrace neighborhood. For the Eastside's thirsting multitudes, it
can't come soon enough.</TE>
<TE>   Back at Angeles Bohemios, the karaoke crooners are departing for
the night, with a ritual exchange of pleasantries and handshakes.
Soon the metal awning will come down, a target for local taggers. No
matter. Tomorrow, a dark, companionable fragrance will signal that
Angeles Bohemios is again open for business, welcoming anyone who
gets a caffeine rush from the sheer, unfiltered pleasures of city

<HD>Updating Spanish in a Brave, New World</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJA MILLS</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A glance at some of the new words included in the latest University
of Chicago Spanish Dictionary would make you think editor David
Pharies didn't have to work very hard.</LD>
<LD>   The words "CD," "fax" and "URL" for example, translate into
Spanish as ... CD, fax and URL.</LD>
<LD>   But revising the dictionary was no easy job.</LD>
<TE>   A landslide of new terms has entered the mainstream since 1987,
the last time the popular dictionary was updated. More than 10
million copies of the dictionary have been sold since the first
edition was published in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   Pharies, a professor of Spanish linguistics at the University of
Florida in Gainesville, added thousands of them, including such signs
of the times as "bungee jumping" (puenting), "gene splicing" (empalme
genetico) and "smart bomb" (bomba inteligente).</TE>
<TE>   Pharies and a team of assistants spent 18 months overhauling the
dictionary for the just-published fifth edition. They labored in what
the professor dubbed "the dungeon," two windowless basement rooms in
a University of Florida classroom building.</TE>
<TE>   "I've suffered so much with poor dictionaries," Pharies said,
"that my goal is no one would have to put it down after consulting it
without being sure they have the right word."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, he said, he was going for what Spanish speakers call la
palabra justa, exactly the right word with the perfect connotation
for a particular situation. English doesn't have an expression that
evocative, Pharies noted, so it usually borrows the French mot juste.</TE>
<TE>   Take a seemingly simple word such as "deck," Pharies said. He and
assistant Irene Moyna could not write a one-word-fits-all
translation.</TE>
<TE>   Telling someone to "hit the deck," for example, doesn't work, word
for word, in Spanish. Instead, you say cuerpo a tierra, literally,
"body to [the] ground." Meantime, "deck" translates as cubierta if
you're talking about the deck of a boat, terraza if you're referring
to the deck on a house and baraja if you mean a deck of cards.</TE>
<TE>   What is striking about the new words Pharies included is how many
English terms Spanish assimilated.</TE>
<TE>   All kinds of computer terms, for example, have been adopted, or
adapted, from English, since the U.S. is the country developing and
selling much of that technology.</TE>
<TE>   "Scanner" became escaner. "Web site" became sitio web.</TE>
<TE>   "Words only flow in one direction," Pharies said. "They flow from
the dominant culture to the less dominant culture."</TE>
<TE>   "We have not borrowed that many words from Spanish, and usually
they're words for food, like 'taco' and 'tamale,' " Pharies said.</TE>
<TE>   Pharies predicted that English will begin assimilating more
Spanish words as the Latin population in the U.S. grows.</TE>
<TE>   "When English speakers decide certain concepts from Spanish are
cool and they want that to be part of their identity, then there will
be a big flow of Spanish words into English," Pharies said.</TE>
<TE>   Pharies said he does not believe the current influx of English
terms hurts Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "English has absorbed more foreign words than almost any language
you can imagine, and yet English is now the dominant language in the
world," he said.</TE>

<HD>Where Others See Blight, Artists Find Beauty</HD>
<DH>Ceramist Keiko Fukazawa and photographer Dennis O. Callwood
put a unique twist on graffiti</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEVERLY BEYETTE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In their wearable graffiti--high-tops, skirt and kimono on her, pants
and suspenders on him--Keiko Fukazawa and Dennis O. Callwood don't
exactly melt into a crowd.</LD>
<LD>   At first glance, the fabrics could be taken for colorful abstract
prints, but closer inspection reveals the graphics, with their
recurring themes of death and despair, angst and anger, as
unmistakably the work of juvenile taggers and gangbangers.</LD>
<LD>   Even if they were dressed in ubiquitous black from head to toe,
this couple still wouldn't fade into the woodwork--he, at 60, with
shaved head and closely cropped gray beard, surveying the world
through dark John Lennon glasses; she, at 47, with a chic, hard-edged
bob and a disarming way of protesting in quite good English that her
English is quite terrible.</LD>
<TE>   Both are artists, Fukazawa a widely collected cutting-edge
ceramist, and Callwood--whose day job for 21 years has been as a
county probation officer--an avant-garde photographer who explores
social issues such as racism and disenfranchisement through the lens
of his camera.</TE>
<TE>   Married for four years, they currently are exhibiting together for
the second time. Their show, "Art and Deviation," in the gallery at
USC's Institute for Genetic Medicine through Sept. 30, presents
graffiti as an art form rather than as urban blight. And they do it
in a unique way, incorporating it into their own art.</TE>
<TE>   That Fukazawa and Callwood came together in the first place is the
stuff of a sitcom. Meeting at a Christmas party in Pasadena in 1995,
they discovered a common bond: Her work is in the permanent
collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; he had recently
been represented in a group show at LACMA; both were teaching art to
the incarcerated.</TE>
<TE>   Callwood was instantly intrigued with Fukazawa. She found him
interesting and comfortable to talk to but recalls, laughing, "in the
middle of the conversation I got up to get more food." He gave her
his business card. "I had a friend, an artist, who liked exotic
people," Fukazawa says. "I thought maybe he was good for her. I never
thought of the possibility of our dating."</TE>
<TE>   Callwood persisted, but when he called her, she was always "busy."
Then, in April 1996, Fukazawa invited him as a guest artist to her
ceramics class at the California Institution for Men in Chino. It was
not romance that was on her mind; she just thought he could get
through to her students.</TE>
<TE>   But by November 1996, she said yes when he invited her to a MOCA
opening, telling her she could bring a friend. To his dismay, she
did--a male friend.</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred, he sent her a dozen yellow roses on Christmas Day. How
friendly, she thought, romance still not on her radar. She called to
thank him, and they decided to go to a movie. Over three months of
dating, she began looking at him differently; a year later they were
married. It was while Callwood was at Challenger Memorial Youth
Center, a juvenile correction facility in Lancaster, in the early
'90s that he became intrigued with graffiti as art.</TE>
<TE>   The camp director asked the staff to create some programs for the
teens incarcerated there, and he, quite naturally, chose art.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Callwood was readying photographs for a San Francisco
exhibit on the modern primitive movement--tattoos and body piercings
and the like. At camp, he saw tattoos galore and decided to
photograph these kids who were incarcerated for vandalism, robbery,
probation violation and, yes, tagging. When he showed them their
photos, "They started writing on them"--gang graffiti.</TE>
<TE>   Callwood realized his black-and-white photos and their graffiti
"went together as one piece." Later he would expand on the concept,
creating collages such as those in his "eyes" series in the USC
exhibit, in which photos of stick-on eyes on improbable objects such
as a sardine can or the bottoms of feet have been transferred to
canvas and embellished with graffiti borders. Some are playful, some
political, some both.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Callwood decided to create a "safe place" at camp for his
graffiti artists to express themselves, painting with acrylics on
designated walls. "They wrote about their girlfriends, their gang,
how they got involved and why." Using color markers, they decorated
fabrics. "The idea was, there was no right and no wrong" creatively.
The only rule: Rival gang members had to work side by side.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids didn't see themselves as artists," says Callwood. "They
saw it as a joke because a lot of them were incarcerated for
graffiti. And here I was saying it was great." But he believed in
their talent and wanted to "convince them to go back to school and
show them they could be good graphic artists."</TE>
<TE>   County policy forbids his following the 17-to 19-year-olds to see
how they fared after their release, but he knows of one who went on
to Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. Callwood's camp project
was phased out after three years when the camp became more
disciplinary, and in February, Callwood moved to a post at Camp
Routh, a fire camp in Tujunga.</TE>
<TE>   One former student, Gerardo Alvarez, 24, of Eagle Rock, who is now
a private security guard and, on the side, a tattoo artist, is quick
to say, "All the art I learned, I learned inside, basically," while
incarcerated in 1994-95 for assault and battery. Alvarez, who
specializes in tattoos with gothic themes, says he "had never written
on walls or the street or anything like that" before being sent to
camp, although he had been in a gang.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did Callwood's class hone his drawing skills, Alvarez
says, but it also improved his life. "Sometimes I was stressed out
while I was incarcerated. Being a teenager and losing your freedom
for a year.... One time I just didn't really care about my life. He'd
keep telling me, 'Keep drawing, keep drawing.' "</TE>
<TE>   Callwood remains intrigued with the possibility that graffiti,
which most dismiss as vandalism, can be channeled in positive ways.
"It is an art form, an expression unique to America and the whole
hip-hop culture," and a form being exploited by mainstream culture.
He understands that he will be criticized for glorifying graffiti but
emphasizes that in doing so he is not glorifying gang life.</TE>
<TE>   And he hopes that if people will take time to understand the kids'
expression of their anger and frustration and help them find markets
for their work, "we can remove the poverty and perhaps remove the
graffiti" from public spaces. "It is a language. They're pushing the
boundaries of this new language that is now going out to the world.
They're the ones who created it, and they should be going to
DreamWorks and to Disney and doing it themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, teaching ceramics to female drug abusers at the
California Rehabilitation Center at Norco, Fukazawa had begun
experimenting with break-it-and-put-it-back-together art. For one
project, she had the inmates write memories of their mothers on
ceramic shards. The result: a big black-and-white vessel that now
sits in her living room, which includes this inscription: "I remember
my mother for her Irish humor, her sainthood and her cinnamon rolls."</TE>
<TE>   This "reborn" vessel was, she says, "kind of a metaphor for the
breaking of these women's old reality, and putting back something
transformed."</TE>
<TE>   Around this time she met Callwood. She was intrigued with the
notion of letting his graffiti artists decorate shards from the
bisque pieces from her kiln with oil markers and then responding to
their art with her own as the unifying element. Soon he was taking
her broken pieces to the camp.</TE>
<TE>   She learned quickly that, in expressing themselves, the young
graffiti artists "had three or four things in their minds--a wife, a
girlfriend, a baby, whatever they left outside; time, watches,
killing time; a lot of death images, skeletons--and promoting their
gang's name."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes a kid would draw Garfield or Mickey Mouse. Fukazawa, in
turn, might draw a pop figure from Japan. As she became intrigued
with the "common thread" of violence that linked the graffiti with
centuries-old conflicts between ruling families, she would
incorporate a symbol such as a Medici crest. A geisha or an image
inspired by an erotic Japanese woodcut might be drawn on a vessel
next to graffiti with sexual content.</TE>
<TE>   Before smashing her pieces, some of which are 3 or 4 feet high,
she would draw grids inside to help her in reassembling them. Then
she'd cover the head of a hammer with a thick piece of fabric and
smack the bisque with the side of it to get clean breaks.</TE>
<TE>   From a distance, her graffiti ceramics are just pretty pieces in a
rainbow of colors. But close up, one sees images of fire, crosses,
daggers, swastikas, snakes, a hangman's noose. And there are
inscriptions: "Only my death will set me free." "9 more weeks until I
go home." Says Fukazawa: "Calligraphy is almost a dead art form. This
is a 20th century art form."</TE>
<TE>   If graffiti art was a big leap for Fukazawa, she has always broken
with tradition. In Tokyo, where she grew up, she was frustrated
because university art students were expected "to paint like the
professor," who was very traditional. "I was interested in abstract
painting."</TE>
<TE>   Later she apprenticed in a ceramics studio near Kyoto that turned
out pieces for the tourist trade. Again, "there were so many do's,
have-to-do's. Two years, that was enough. I said thank you very much,
I'm going to California. I'd read in a magazine of many things
happening on the West Coast in avant-garde ceramics, beautiful,
strong pieces." Home now for the couple is an art-filled 1920s
bungalow on a tree-lined Pasadena street where Fukazawa keeps a
studio. Callwood works from a studio on the Westside, an arrangement
that gives each physical and mental space. He crams a full workweek
at the fire camp into a 2 1/2-day shift starting Saturday and ending
Monday, devoting much of the other 4 1/2 days to photography. He
says, "I'm like two different people. At work, nobody thinks I'm a
serious artist, while other artists don't think of me as a probation
officer." During the school year, Fukazawa teaches two ceramics
classes at Cerritos College and two at USC.</TE>
<TE>   With their complicated career schedules, dinner may not get to the
table until 9 or 10, and, if she's the cook, it's apt to be fusion
dishes, Japanese and Western, such as spaghetti with codfish roe and
dried seaweed. Time spent together often means going to other
artists' openings, of which Callwood never tires. In turn, he says,
"she takes me to Japanese movies," although he long ago abandoned
attempts to learn the language.</TE>
<TE>   Both artists will soon be moving on. Callwood wants to do
portraits of the Chicano artists and writers who contributed to Con
Safos (Reflections of Life in the Barrio), a radical journal
published in East L.A. from 1968 until it folded in 1974. It
showcased Chicano art, literature and folk culture and explored the
social and political issues that were emerging with the explosion of
the Chicano movement. These men are aging now, and Callwood wants to
"let people know about them."</TE>
<TE>   Fukazawa, reared in a tradition-bound society where "nails that
stick out get the hammer," wants to "take a look at my country and my
adopted country" in exploring new directions. "I want to share
something as an immigrant artist."</TE>
<TE>   Their graffiti art is not for sale and won't be sold, Callwood
says, unless it is to set up a nonprofit organization to benefit
troubled youth.</TE>

<LD>"Still Life," by Paul Liegeois, is a beautiful arrangement of fruit
on a table. This painting does not tell a dramatic story, but the
artist creates drama through his use of vivid color. How many colors
can you find in the painting? How does color help you understand how
the different fruits and objects feel, taste or smell?</LD>
<LD>   Before he painted this inviting scene, the artist made many
preparations. First, he selected the fruits he wished to paint,
perhaps visiting the market to buy grapes, pomegranates, melon and
citrus fruits. The market is a wonderful place to see the variety of
colors that nature has to offer--as true for Liegeois almost 400
years ago in Paris as it is for us today.</LD>
<LD>   After he arranged the composition, the artist would then choose
his colors. In the 17th century when Liegeois worked, artists had to
make their own paints. The artist mixed colored powders into oil to
make the paint, a process that is kind of like cooking. Have you ever
added food coloring to frosting for cakes or cookies? Making paint is
similar to that process.</LD>
<TE>   Liegeois used color to create a feast for your eyes. To see how
other artists used color, go to the museum's Family Day event
"Exploring Color" on Saturday, Sept. 21 from 2 to 3 p.m. The special
exhibition "Learning to Look: Color" starts Friday and continues
through Jan. 6. For more information call (626) 844-6980 or visit

<LD>* My favorite dinosaur is a T. rex because it was the strongest thing
in the world. The T. rex was mean and always looked for food to eat.
The T. rex had sharp teeth and was a meat eater.</LD>

<TE>   * My favorite dinosaur is a velociraptor. I know that they hunted
by jumping up and slashing with razor-sharp toe claws. They were only
2 feet, 6 inches tall. Another thing I know is that they were vicious
and deadly. They were smarter than primates and other dinosaurs.</TE>

<TE>   * I have several favorite dinosaurs, but the spinosaurus is my
favorite. Its name means "spined reptile" and it was a 40-foot-long
theropod. The most interesting feature about it was its "sail"
(actually, 5-foot-tall spines) along its back.</TE>

<TE>   * My favorite dinosaur is the maiasaura because it was a good
parent and it had a cute face. Each maiasaura mother shaped her
7-foot-wide nest out of dirt and laid her eggs. It was a duck-billed
dinosaur. I wonder if it said, "quack, quack."</TE>

<LD>The stories must have sounded barbaric to the teenager sitting
wide-eyed among adults at the breakfast table:</LD>
<LD>   Thirty-three swats with a wooden paddle for violating the dress
code by wearing cuffed pants (a possible hiding place for cigarettes)
in junior high.</LD>
<LD>   Being forced to bend over, naked, in front of teammates on the
high school football team and take swats from the coach as punishment
for a D or F on a report card.</LD>
<TE>   Of being led, in tears, out of algebra class and forced to stand,
spread-eagle, against a hallway wall for two swats from a teacher for
whispering in class.</TE>
<TE>   Those punishments were meted out decades ago, the first two to
classmates of mine, the third to me, when I was in eighth grade. The
paddles were heavy and thick, often drilled with holes to cut the
drag as they whizzed toward your backside. And swats were the
punishment prescribed for everything from skipping class to cutting
up in the lunch line.</TE>
<TE>   "They hit you with wooden paddles?" asked the unbelieving teenager
at the table, a classmate's son, puzzled by the laughter accompanying
our recollections. "That's brutal! Didn't it hurt? Didn't your
parents care?"</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it was painful and humiliating. That was the point of it. And
if our parents found out that we'd been paddled, we--not the
teachers--were likely to face their wrath.</TE>
<TE>   Yet as we reminisced last month at my high school reunion, from
the comfortable distance of 30 years, those old-fashioned beatings
didn't seem so bad.</TE>
<TE>   Around the table with me sat a minister, a business owner, a
college administrator, a couple of teachers. We had all turned out
pretty well, despite the "brutal" treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe because of it, one classmate suggested. Sometimes the
fear of physical punishment was the only thing that kept him in line.
"I was bad with discipline," he recalled. "I might have been dead
without it."</TE>
<TE>   I couldn't help but think of that conversation as I prepared my
eighth-grade daughter to join the hundreds of thousands of students
starting a new school term in Los Angeles today. Last year was her
first in public school, and the biggest revelation--and
disappointment--for us both was the lack of respect students showed
for their teachers and their school.</TE>
<TE>   It was not uncommon for a child to curse a teacher or refuse to
obey even the simplest rule. My daughter saw standoffs in class
between teachers and students end with name-calling (by both),
threats (by the student) or tears (from the teacher). An entire
period could evaporate while a teacher struggled to deal with a
recalcitrant child.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is not a new one. For the last 20 years, Americans
surveyed on national polls have ranked "lack of discipline" as the
most serious problem facing schools today.</TE>
<TE>   Corporal punishment in schools is now, appropriately, considered
abuse, and most states have banned its use--as California did in
1986. But there is no quick-fix tool to take its place; nothing to
scare the bad actors straight. And sometimes it seems like the "good"
kids pay.</TE>
<TE>   Today, school discipline is viewed as part of a larger mission to
mold character and promote responsibility. And fear is no longer
considered an appropriate motivating tool.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not taking a board and swatting somebody that's going to
make a good human being," says Los Angeles School Board member Julie
Korenstein. "Discipline has to be part of the whole building of
conscience so children will learn to care if they do something that
can harm somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   We're more sensitive to children's emotional needs, more aware
that a troublemaker is likely a troubled kid, that bad behavior may
reflect many things--a cry for attention, a response to family
turmoil, a lack of coping skills, frustration over the inability to
read.</TE>
<TE>   And our children are growing up in a more aggressive and
permissive era, with blurred boundaries and less respect for all
authority figures. A generation ago, teachers were like an extension
of our parents, and discipline methods relied on that.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, when Willie Crittendon was an L.A. school principal
called upon to discipline a child for using foul language, he would
"get that child in my office, call the parent, hand the phone to the
student and say, 'Just repeat to your parents what you said in the
classroom.' Most of them would be too embarrassed to do it. They knew
Mama or Daddy would hit the roof."</TE>
<TE>   Today, parents are as likely to chastise the teacher or principal
who disciplines their child than they are to scold the student. "You
don't get the support you used to get," says Crittendon, who now
heads Los Angeles Unified School District's operations and safety
division. "You've got parents coming in saying, 'What did you do to
my child?'"</TE>
<TE>   And teachers tell me they sometimes opt to do nothing when a child
misbehaves rather than brave the anger of contentious parents or risk
the ever-present threat of a call from a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not calling for the return of the paddle, though I do think
the pendulum has swung too far if we're afraid to dispatch
troublemakers from the classroom for fear of hurting their
self-esteem.</TE>
<TE>   Gone from most schools are "detention centers," those classrooms
that functioned like holding pens for kids who couldn't or wouldn't
obey the rules. I spent enough class periods forced to sit in them,
bored, to consider good behavior its own reward.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, isolating misbehaving students is about the only thing
today that seems to pay disciplinary dividends. "We call it in-house
suspension," Crittendon says. "The child has to go to class, but they
can't have lunch with their friends, they have to go to the bathroom
alone, they can't go to a dance or [school] movie; they do paper
pickup while their buddies are off having fun."</TE>
<TE>   And detention rooms are being tried on some campuses today, with a
twist that aims to address the root of misbehavior, rather than just
punish the miscreants. Termed "opportunity" rooms, they provide
tutoring and counseling to students kicked out of class--"behavior
management strategies," the educators call them, rather than mere
discipline tools.</TE>
<TE>   Which all sounds good and may even work. But it will take time and
space and money ... and on today's troubled campuses, all those--like
patience-- are in short supply.</TE>

<LD>   The story so far: 10-year-old Deon has attended many Adoption Fair
Picnics without ever being chosen. Will Little Dude be disappointed
too?</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   The bus shudders to a stop. Here we are.</TE>
<TE>   Little Dude says, "I sure hope I get adopted."</TE>
<TE>   Trying to keep my voice kind, I say, "I don't want to disappoint
you, but there's something you should know. People go for the babies,
cute and cuddly. You might not be too old, but I am."</TE>
<TE>   Poor kid, he looks like a balloon that's lost its air. Quickly I
ask, "Want to go down that slide?"</TE>
<TE>   "Awesome!" he says. I skip around to wait for him at the bottom.
Uh-oh. There's a puddle.</TE>
<TE>   Little Dude shoots down the slide. I grab him before he lands in
the water. He grins up at me as I set him down. But then some bad
kids shove him into the puddle. He gets up all wet and muddy.</TE>
<TE>   Tears fill his eyes. Man, I hope he doesn't cry.</TE>
<TE>   I try to wipe off the mud with my shirttail. Leading him away, I
tell him, "Look what I brought!" I show him my good-luck stone.</TE>
<TE>   "What's that?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's for good luck," I tell him. "Here, now, touch it, and maybe
it will work for both of us."</TE>
<TE>   He touches it, and then he jams his hands onto his hips. "Look at
you! You're muddy too!" He tries to tuck my shirttail in. I finish
the job.</TE>
<TE>   I aim a high-five at him. He does the same, only his is a
low-five. We almost miss each other. That cracks us up.</TE>
<TE>   Little Dude notices a man pointing at us. "Look, they're talking
about us!" The man and his wife are both wearing white pants, white
shoes, and shirts of bright jungle colors with faces of parrots and
monkeys.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's see what they do next," I try to warn Little Dude.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, the lady goes over and picks up a baby with a pink
bow in her hair. She cuddles her, sets her down and blows her a kiss.</TE>
<TE>   "See?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yep. I see."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: Will Deon's good-luck stone work any miracles for him
or Little Dude?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Drug Maker Says Data Boost Hopes for Crestor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Europe's second-biggest drug maker, AstraZeneca, presented new
clinical data Monday showing its experimental cholesterol-lowering
drug Crestor was more effective than its biggest rival across a wide
range of doses.</LD>
<LD>   The Anglo-Swedish firm told a medical conference in Berlin that
its biggest new drug hope produced an 8.4% greater reduction in
LDL-cholesterol--or harmful cholesterol--than Pfizer Inc.'s Lipitor,
the world's top-selling drug.</LD>
<LD>   Previous trial data had focused on individual dose comparisons.</LD>
<TE>   Crestor, which has been deemed approvable by the Food and Drug
Administration pending further discussion on dose and label, is a key
plank of AstraZeneca's bid to reduce its reliance on ulcer pill
Losec, a $6-billion-a-year bestseller that is facing the threat of
cheap, generic competition.</TE>
<TE>   But its progress has been delayed by regulators seeking more
information about its use at high doses.</TE>
<TE>   Shares in AstraZeneca, which have been hit hard recently by the
delays to Crestor and problems with its experimental cancer drug
Iressa, were the biggest gainers in the FTSE 100 index, gaining 3.6%.
The stock is down nearly 50% from April's peak, however.</TE>
<TE>   AstraZeneca said last month that it would provide the FDA with new
clinical data in the first quarter of 2003 and no longer would seek
approval for the highest Crestor dose--80 milligrams--after rare
cases of muscle problems.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said this put back the likely launch of the treatment in
the key U.S. market to the third or fourth quarter of next year,
about one year later than initially expected.</TE>

<HD>Japanese Car Makers to Team Up on Hybrids</HD>
<DH>Autos: Nissan will buy key components from Toyota, a move
that could reinforce Japan's 'green' dominance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN and JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Significantly boosting the commercial viability of environmentally
friendly cars, two of Japan's largest auto makers said Monday that
they would collaborate in producing hybrid vehicles for the U.S.
market.</LD>
<LD>   Under the agreement, Nissan Motor Co. said it expects to buy key
components from Toyota Motor Corp. for about 100,000 hybrid Nissan
vehicles to be sold in the U.S. over a five-year period beginning in
2006.</LD>
<LD>   So-called hybrid cars emit less pollution by using an electric
motor to augment a gasoline engine. Toyota is the global leader in
hybrid cars, thanks to its Prius hybrid sedan, which has sold 98,000
models worldwide since its introduction in 1997. The Prius has been
most popular in North America, with 33,363 vehicles on the road since
the September 2000 U.S. roll-out.</LD>
<TE>   But to make the vehicles more profitable, Toyota needs far higher
volumes. Producing more components would help lower per-unit costs,
as would standardization.</TE>
<TE>   "An environmental technology must become widespread," Toyota
Executive Vice President Akihiko Saito said at the first-ever
Toyota-Nissan news conference. "It gives us great joy that Nissan has
given a high assessment to Toyota's hybrid technology."</TE>
<TE>   Nissan Executive Vice President Nobuo Okubo said, "We must move
beyond the efforts of just one company."</TE>
<TE>   Prompted by the tightening of emissions restrictions and
environmental concerns, auto makers worldwide have been racing to
develop technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Honda Motor Co. has developed a different type of hybrid from
Toyota's. Toyota's system, at times, runs only on electric power;
Honda's has no purely electric mode. Its Insight two-seater has sold
13,000 vehicles since 1999, primarily in the U.S. It is hoping to
sell 24,000 Civic hybrids, launched this year in the U.S., in North
America this year.</TE>
<TE>   Honda officials in the U.S. have said that the Insight probably
will be withdrawn from the market in about a year to make room for
production of more Civic and other hybrid models.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ford Motor Co. is preparing to market a hybrid version
of its small Escape sport utility vehicle in 2004--and
Ford-controlled Mazda is expected to follow suit with a hybrid
Tribute, its version of the SUV.</TE>
<TE>   Other major auto makers, including DaimlerChrysler and General
Motors Corp., also are preparing hybrids for the U.S. and overseas
markets.</TE>
<TE>   GM and Ford, the world's two largest auto makers, have pulled the
plug on efforts to develop marketable versions of battery-powered
electric cars.</TE>
<TE>   GM is reclaiming the two-seat EV-1 electric cars it has leased to
a small group of enthusiasts for several years, and Ford announced
last week that it will stop work on its Think electric vehicle and
sell the division because of low demand and lack of government
support. Ford has spent about $123 million on the Think unit and its
development, and GM spent more than $1 billion on the EV-1 program.</TE>
<TE>   The death of the two big electric-vehicle programs gives a big
boost to the development of the hybrid as the environmentally
friendly vehicle of choice until the auto industry can perfect the
fuel cell, which produces electric power from hydrogen on board the
vehicle and doesn't require storage batteries or external recharging.</TE>
<TE>   Hybrids got another boost recently when California's
zero-emissions mandate, which required auto makers to offer up to
100,000 electric cars and other low-pollution vehicles each year
beginning with the 2003 model year, was blocked by a court injunction
in a suit filed by GM.</TE>
<TE>   Auto industry executives expect the California Air Resources Board
to rewrite the mandate rules to permit more very-low-emission
vehicles, as hybrids can be.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's Toyota-Nissan agreement promises to widen the lead of
Japanese auto makers over U.S. and European manufacturers in selling
so-called green cars that produce lower carbon dioxide emissions and
cleaner exhaust. But environmental friendliness doesn't necessarily
translate into profitability. Though Toyota has indicated that it is
eking out profit on the Prius, there are many doubters.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan has maintained that it can't make money on hybrids with
such low sales. Nissan discontinued its Tino hybrid model in 2000
after losing substantial amounts on the few vehicles it sold.</TE>
<TE>   The cooperation of Toyota and Nissan, perhaps the fiercest
corporate rivals this country has ever seen, astonished the Japanese.
It would be as if McDonald's and Burger King said they were
collaborating on a healthy burger, with McDonald's selling some of
its secret ingredients and equipment to its archrival.</TE>
<TE>   But it is a sign of Nissan's financial turmoil that it seized on
Toyota's invitation to auto makers last year to cooperate on
environmentally friendly technologies.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew that volume would be key and if we pursued it
independently, we couldn't get the required revenues," Nissan's Okubo
said.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Nissan was neck-and-neck with Toyota for bragging
rights as Japan's top car maker in terms of sales and revenue. But in
the last several years, Toyota has substantially widened its lead
while Nissan faltered with an overly aggressive international
expansion plan, a run of unpopular models, poor cost controls and a
huge debt load.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Honda came on strong, narrowly overtaking Nissan as the
country's No. 2 auto maker. Nissan posted record profit for its last
fiscal year, but largely through massive cost cutting and its booming
U.S. operation.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Nissan will be installing a hybrid system under
development by Toyota, including the transaxle and inverter. Nissan
will install them in yet-to-be-announced models of its own--which
could include SUVs--and continue development of its own engine.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan insists that it too has technology to offer, including a
lead in development of a lithium iode battery.</TE>

<HD>Bright Spot Seen in Biotech Industry</HD>
<DH>In contrast to the dot-com bust, the bio sector shows
promise of growth, Southland real estate experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With demand for traditional office space in the doldrums, many in
Southern California's commercial real estate community are pinning
their hopes for future growth on the expanding biotechnology
industry.</LD>
<LD>   The gamble is far from a sure bet. Biotechnology firms, like other
high-tech firms, must compete for a smaller supply of venture capital
to grow. Developers across the nation have planned or built
facilities to house biotechnology firms that never materialized, and
many real estate executives remain leery of anything remotely
high-tech in light of the millions of square feet left empty by the
dot-com bust.</LD>
<LD>   But the biotechnology industry and the much broader health-care
sector are among the few industries that have continued to expand and
whose long-term prospects look relatively promising, say real estate
observers.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very fertile ground," said Gray DeFevere, a real estate
specialist at Colliers Seeley who works closely with regional venture
capitalists and related companies.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many Internet firms, most start-ups in biotechnology and
biomedicine have products to sell and long-term backers, said Craig
Peters, a real estate broker who works with biotechnology clients in
the Santa Clarita Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "You are going to see them around for quite a while and showing
some pretty explosive growth," said Peters of CB Richard Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego County, which is home to the region's biggest
concentration of biotechnology firms, new and existing companies are
expected to need as much as 3 million square feet of additional space
in the near future, according to office building owner Arden Realty
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "The biotech and life science industries are truly the main
drivers of demand in San Diego," Chief Operating Officer Victor
Coleman said during a recent conference call with industry analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a rapidly growing cluster of biotechnology and other
advanced biomedical businesses has set up shop in the north end of
Los Angeles County in the new office and industrial parks of the
Santa Clarita Valley. Nearly 20 biomedical companies--such as
AlleCure and Advance Bionics Corp.--occupy nearly 2 million square
feet of space in the massive Valencia Gateway office and industrial
zone, according to brokerage CB Richard Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   This year, biotechnology pioneer Alfred Mann purchased a 160-acre
chunk of Rye Canyon, a former Lockheed aerospace facility in
Valencia, and plans to build the Mann Biomedical Park.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with other industry groups in the Santa Clarita Valley,
"the biomed cluster is the fastest growing," Peters said. "The
expansion plans for various companies will more than double the size
of the cluster."</TE>
<TE>   Real estate developers also see continued expansion of
biotechnology facilities along the 101 Freeway corridor that runs
across the west San Fernando Valley and Ventura County, where
industry leader Amgen Corp. is on the verge of adding yet another
building on its Thousand Oaks campus that already includes more than
40 structures.</TE>
<TE>   In Agoura Hills, biotechnology firms and their suppliers have been
among the potential tenants that have shown interest in a new
67,000-square-foot office complex by the Los Angeles real estate
development firm Katell Properties.</TE>
<TE>   "Biotech is a target for us," said veteran developer Gerald L.
Katell.</TE>

<HD>Disney Channel Putting Classics Back in the Vault</HD>
<DH>Decision to rerun teen programs instead angers some viewers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Disney Channel executives, the decision seemed a no-brainer:
replace vintage Disney television shows that run in the dead of night
with newer, hipper fare targeted to a younger, more lucrative
audience.</LD>
<LD>   But the seemingly mundane programming change to replace the "Vault
Disney" classics with teen and preteen dramas such as "Lizzie
McGuire" and "Kim Possible" has created an uproar among older
die-hard Disney fans, who see the move as the latest affront to Walt
Disney Co.'s heritage. Internet chat rooms devoted to Disney fans are
abuzz with the pending demise of "Vault Disney." Some viewers are
penning protest letters to management relating their connection to
childhood heroes such as "Zorro." One fan has started a petition in
hopes of reversing the decision.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm dumbfounded," said Glendale schoolteacher Sue Schuck, 54, who
vowed to sell her Disney stock in protest. "We baby boomers pay for
the cable, the admission to Disneyland and the Disney products. We
watched these shows. They are part of our childhood."</LD>
<TE>   The decision is simply economics, Disney said. Rather than
spending money on airing older shows such as "Spin and Marty" and
"Davy Crockett," Disney wants to invest in new programs that resonate
with younger audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Targeting younger viewers has spurred the Disney Channel's growth
over the last decade, as it moved from a mostly premium,
subscriber-fee cable service to a much more widely distributed cable
network.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute underscores the dilemma the Burbank entertainment
giant faces as it tries to shore up its sagging bottom line: how to
keep its brand relevant to younger kids without offending the baby
boomers who cling to a very different, often nostalgic vision of the
Disney of their childhood.</TE>
<TE>   Such tensions have flared up across Disney's businesses in recent
years. Fans, for example, loudly protested a few years ago when the
company shut down Mr. Toad's Wild Ride at the Magic Kingdom in
Orlando, Fla., one of the original Walt Disney World attractions.</TE>
<TE>   Baby boomers also complained more recently about the newly
redesigned Disney Stores catering too heavily to children. Even as
Disney spent millions celebrating what would have been founder Walt
Disney's 100th birthday last year, some longtime devotees believed
the company didn't pay enough homage to him.</TE>
<TE>   "They are trying to walk this tightrope of keeping their classic
Disney going and appealing to a younger market and staying
contemporary," said Janet Wasko, a professor of communications
studies at the University of Oregon and author of two books on
Disney. "That's a difficult task for them because there is such
emotional attachment to Disney products and characters. People just
don't react the same when other companies change their product lines,
but Disney is different."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping current has been a major goal of the Disney Channel, whose
audience has grown in six years from 14 million households to more
than 80 million. In contrast to the struggling ABC TV network, the
channel has been an important moneymaker and marketing outlet for the
parent company, generating an estimated $250 million in operating
income this year, according to some estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Its success stems mainly from a combination of live-action movies
and original series, such as "Lizzie McGuire" and "Even Stevens,"
that target teens and preteens, a demographic coveted by advertisers
and retailers.</TE>
<TE>   The channel's latest creation, the animated drama "Kim Possible,"
tied with market leader Nickelodeon among 6-to 11-year-olds after
making its debut in June, according to Nielsen Media Research.</TE>
<TE>   The channel launched "Vault Disney" four years ago as an umbrella
for Disney classic television shows from the 1950s and '60s. To make
room for the newer entertainment, "Vault Disney" programs were pushed
further into the evening and early-morning hours. Ratings dwindled as
viewers got tired of seeing the same shows over and over, and Disney
focused its energies on developing programs.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday, the 1-to-5-a.m. block will be replaced with reruns of
prime-time channel shows. Until then, the channel is running "Davy
Crockett" and "Zorro" marathons so fans can watch the final episodes.</TE>
<TE>   Disney Channel executives say they are canceling "Vault Disney" to
create consistent programming on a 24-hour basis for kids.</TE>
<TE>   "The Disney Channel is a service for kids and their families; it's
not a general entertainment service for everybody," said Richard
Ross, president of entertainment for the Disney Channel. "We can't be
all things for all people."</TE>
<TE>   To critics who question how many kids would be watching TV at such
late hours, Disney executives argue that satellite TV feeds allow
millions of viewers to watch these shows earlier in the evening. For
example, a teen in L.A. could watch an episode of, say, "Kim
Possible" at 10 p.m. by picking up the East Coast feed of the Disney
Channel.</TE>
<TE>   Ross denies that the channel is turning its back on its heritage.
"This is not a slam on the vault programming," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ross notes that the channel Monday debuts a series called
"Mickey's House of Mouse" with 65 episodes. Some "Vault Disney"
titles are available on video and DVD, with several more to be
released next year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney is under heavy pressure from rivals such as Viacom Inc.'s
Nickelodeon and AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Cartoon Network to ensure that
its programs stay current, especially as kids programming
increasingly shifts from network television to cable TV.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, fans complain that removing such beloved classics is
shortsighted.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the need to keep their product current, but by doing
this they effectively have a Disney Channel without any Disney on
it," said Bill Cotter, author of a book on Disney television and one
of the consultants on the "Vault Disney" concept. "You can change
with the times, but you don't need to change 100%."</TE>
<TE>   Arlen Miller of Orlando, who buys and sells Disney merchandise for
a living, is equally baffled.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm furious about this," said Miller, 49, a lifelong fan of
"Zorro," the 1950s television series starring the wildly popular Guy
Williams as a masked avenger.</TE>
<TE>   "The Disney Channel is not just for 13-to 17-year-olds. They are
forgetting the foundation that they were created on."</TE>

<HD>Foreign Indexes End Lower on New Fears</HD>
<DH>Markets: Concerns about insurer finances and other reports
send shares down. South Korea's Kospi rises.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most major foreign stock markets ended lower Monday in the absence of
guidance from holiday-shuttered U.S. markets.</LD>
<LD>   In Europe, Zurich Financial and other insurers dragged shares down
on jitters over the companies' finances.</LD>
<LD>   Also, airline shares including Lufthansa sank after details of a
thwarted potential hijacking of a flight from Sweden last week
renewed fears over the sector's vulnerability to terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Stocks also were mostly weaker in Asia and Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street was closed for Labor Day, which left foreign investors
without a key source of direction and kept trading light.</TE>
<TE>   Shares in Zurich Financial slumped 11% after a Swiss newspaper
reported that the company, Europe's third-largest insurer, is poised
to announce the need to raise $2.5 billion in capital. The company
had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers came under additional pressure after brokerage Morgan
Stanley cut its recommendation on the sector to "cautious" from
"in-line," and raised the specter of radical restructurings in the
industry because of capital shortfalls.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers have been hit this year by heavy losses in their equity
portfolios as global markets have tumbled.</TE>
<TE>   The main Swiss market index fell 2.6% to 5,096.00 on Monday. In
Germany, the DAX index slid 2.8% to 3,609.41, while France's CAC-40
index dropped 2.8% to 3,272.76.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of France Telecom slid 10% in Paris after L'Expansion
magazine reported that the French government was in talks aimed at
replacing Michel Bon at the helm of the debt-ridden company.</TE>
<TE>   The report cited official disappointment at Bon's handling of
MobilCom, the group's troubled German affiliate.</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, the FTSE-100 index lost 1.1% to 4,180.90.</TE>
<TE>   British mobile phone giant Vodafone fell 3.6% on worries it will
have to dip into its coffers after a report in the Financial Times
that it is preparing to make a $7.9-billion hostile bid for SFR, the
French mobile phone company controlled by Vivendi Universal.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts warned that European markets are vulnerable to heavy
selling in coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the view the market in Europe is likely to retest the
lows we saw in July over the course of September and October," said
Jason James, European strategist at HSBC bank.</TE>
<TE>   "The main problem is overvaluation in technology, and very likely
large [secondary stock] issues in telecoms and possibly insurance. We
have not convincingly hit bottom yet and the U.S. market looks
overvalued to us," James said.</TE>
<TE>   In Asia on Monday, Japan's benchmark Nikkei average fell 1%,
ending at 9,521.63. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 1.5% to
9,896.98, and Taiwan's weighted index dropped 2.5% to 4,644.58, the
weakest level since Aug. 6.</TE>
<TE>   But South Korean stocks bucked the trend. The Kospi index jumped
2.1% to 751.98.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico City, the IPC index dipped 0.8% to 6,165.93, while
Brazil's Bovespa index was down fractionally.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican stocks fell after President Vicente Fox appealed to
lawmakers in his State of the Nation address Sunday for help in
passing measures the president says are needed to ensure sustained
economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition-controlled Congress has so far undermined the chief
pillars of Fox's domestic agenda by derailing a tax increase,
shelving his initial plan to deregulate the $10-billion electricity
industry and watering down an Indian rights bill.</TE>

<HD>Freight Line to Close Its U.S. Operations</HD>
<DH>Trucking: Consolidated Freightways says it will file for
bankruptcy protection. 15,500 workers will lose jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consolidated Freightways Corp., one of the nation's largest trucking
firms, said Monday that it was shutting down its U.S. operations
immediately and would move to liquidate the business.</LD>
<LD>   The 73-year-old company, noting that it could not secure needed
financing, said the action would put 15,500 people out of work, 80%
of them right away. The company conveyed the news on Labor Day to
many employees by directing them to call a toll-free number, which
had a recorded message from the company's chief executive, who grimly
told workers not to report for work today.</LD>
<LD>   More than 1,900 employees in California will lose their jobs, many
of them at Consolidated's huge terminal in Mira Loma near Ontario
Airport.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm frankly shocked," said John Husing, an economist who
specializes in the Inland Empire, a national hub for transportation
and warehousing. Although other freight carriers such as Yellow Corp.
are expected to fill the void, Husing nonetheless described the loss
of the Mira Loma operations as a significant blow to the
goods-movement support system for Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   In a news release Monday, Consolidated Freightways said it would
file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection today, along with filing a
quarterly financial statement that it had delayed. Though a Chapter
11 filing is normally used to reorganize debt and continue operating,
a company spokesperson said it would allow management to dispose of
the business more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Consolidated said operations of the CF AirFreight and Canadian
Freightways Ltd. subsidiaries are continuing.</TE>
<TE>   Consolidated, which has been struggling for some time, had been in
discussions with lenders to obtain additional financing--an amount
that was not released. But what apparently pushed the company over
the edge was an abrupt cancellation by one of the company's surety
bondholders of coverage related to Consolidated's self-insurance
programs for workers' compensation and vehicular casualty, which a
spokesperson said created an additional $30-million-to-$35-million
gap.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry for this action, but we have no other choice due to a
lack of financial resources," John Brincko, Consolidated's chief
executive since May, said in his recorded message. He said the
company would ask the Bankruptcy Court to enable the company to pay
the two weeks' wages owed to employees as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Employees at Consolidated, most of whom are represented by the
Teamsters union, will not receive additional severance, said
spokeswoman Sandra Sternberg, speaking from the company's
headquarters in Vancouver, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Teamsters officials could not be reached Monday for comment, but
rumors had been swirling in recent days about the company's deepening
troubles. The company said last month that it may be delisted from
Nasdaq because of its failure to file its second-quarter report on
time. The company, with annual revenue exceeding $2 billion, has lost
more than $146 million during the preceding six quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the company was one of 16 firms that hadn't
certified financial results due by Aug. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Economists attributed part of Consolidated's financial woes to the
depressed economy. But the company also was unable to compete with
major rivals such as Yellow and a host of smaller independent
truckers in major markets such as Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp., said there are plenty of other companies that will
pick up the slack. And as such, he said, Consolidated's shutdown
won't have a big effect on the state economy.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, some of Consolidated's customers will have to switch
carriers and could feel some disruption during the transition.
Consolidated said it would continue to make deliveries that are in
transit or in terminals. The company operates nearly two dozen
terminals throughout California.</TE>
<TE>   Consolidated Freightways has been the third-largest of the
so-called less-than-truckload companies, which enable truckers to
consolidate various shipments. Many smaller businesses rely on such
companies because they don't have enough volume to fill a truck but
need speedy delivery.</TE>

<HD>Investors Wary of September</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: The month has a bad reputation among market
watchers, but analysts say this year could be different.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been a cruel summer on Wall Street. After swooning to five-year
lows in late July, stock prices rebounded strongly only to falter as
the U.S. economy showed signs of weakening.</LD>
<LD>   In a fitting coda, the Dow Jones industrial average blew a
112-point gain Friday to end the day and the month with a loss. That
gave the widely watched index a five-month losing streak for the
first time since the summer of 1981.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as September dawns, investors are bracing for a variety of
challenges--not least among them history. Over the last half a
century, September has been the worst month by far for the stock
market. Some market watchers hope this year will be different, in
part because the pre-Labor Day selling has been so fierce.</LD>
<TE>   "They say, 'Sell in May and go away until late September,' " said
A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates in
Santa Barbara. "But I think because stocks were very weak in July,
there could be better action in September."</TE>
<TE>   But more than the past is haunting Wall Street. There's the threat
of war with Iraq, which would destabilize the Middle East, send shock
waves through global oil markets and rattle investors worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Also, next Wednesday is the first anniversary of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, which occurred only blocks from Wall Street and
forced the longest stock market shutdown since the Great Depression.
Concerns about some sort of terror strike could weigh on investors,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the wave of financial scandals engulfing
corporate America. Recent revelations, although dramatic, have
involved companies and executives already known to be in trouble and
have had little effect on the market. But a new scandal involving an
unsuspected miscreant could push investors over the edge--and out of
stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, though, will be the behavior of the U.S. economy
and the developing outlook for corporate profits for the rest of the
year and into 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is nervous about earnings for the remainder of this
year and, more importantly, next year," said Mike Kayes, chief
investment officer at Eastover Capital Management. "That's the key:
Will we see an earnings acceleration? If not, the market is not going
anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   The early trend isn't promising. Key players such as Sun
Microsystems Inc., RadioShack Corp. and Best Buy Co. lowered earnings
expectations last month, citing a slower-than-expected rebound in
corporate and consumer spending. On Friday, BellSouth issued a fresh
profit warning only five weeks after revising its outlook,
"highlighting the speed at which business conditions have apparently
deteriorated," Merrill Lynch analyst Adam Quinton said.</TE>
<TE>   The outlook is especially bleak among tech and telecom stocks. In
addition to Sun, Intel Corp., Novellus Systems Inc., Nortel Networks
Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. all have issued sobering news recently
about their prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the number of companies that have cut their third-quarter
earnings forecasts is up 30% from the same point last quarter, said
Ken Perkins, an analyst at Thomson First Call. And the number raising
profit expectations is down 32% from three months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, analysts now are predicting that third-quarter profits
for companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index will rise 11.2%,
down from the 16.6% increase they were forecasting July 1, according
to Thomson First Call. Fourth-quarter earnings are expected to
increase 22.9%, down from the previous prediction of 27.7%.</TE>
<TE>   "The natural adjustment from good economy to good profits isn't
happening," said money manager Kevin Jones of ICM Asset Management
Inc. For earnings, "I'd like to see the bar set a little lower."</TE>
<TE>   As companies struggle to meet Wall Street's profit forecasts, the
economy is sending decidedly mixed signals. Economic growth slowed
markedly in the second quarter, employment has been soft and consumer
confidence was dealt a heavy blow by the market's May-July sell-off.
The signs of economic weakness helped send the dollar to a loss in
August against the yen and euro, its sixth losing month out of the
last seven.</TE>
<TE>   But even as sentiment tumbles--and the bear market nears its 2
1/2-year anniversary--retail sales haven't collapsed and there are
scattered signs of a revival in the nation's factories, including a
report Friday that Chicago-area manufacturing activity rose for a
seventh month.</TE>
<TE>   Which is why investment pros will be paying close attention this
week as the first round of post-Labor Day economic reports are
released.</TE>
<TE>   "Just keep your fingers crossed that the reports are consistent
with the view that the economy continued to expand in August," said
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "That
will determine the outcome for the markets for the entire month of
September."</TE>
<TE>   A broader reading on the state of U.S. manufacturing, which makes
up one-sixth of the economy, will come today when the Institute for
Supply Management releases its monthly manufacturing index. In July
the index fell to 50.5, its lowest level since January. Analysts
expect the index to reach 51.6 for August, according to a Reuters
poll.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, August car sales and truck sales roll in. Economists
polled by Reuters are expecting auto makers to report 6.2 million car
sales and 7.9 million truck sales.</TE>
<TE>   "Auto sales give you a sense of what consumer spending did,"
Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Economists watch consumer spending closely because it makes up
two-thirds of economic activity. In recent months, consumers have
continued to spend freely, with robust July auto sales and new-home
sales hitting a record.</TE>
<TE>   August unemployment figures will be released Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "The health of the labor market is a critical input into the whole
issue of consumer spending," said Bruce Simon, chief investment
officer of Glenmede Trust Co. "That is one of the key factors in
support of the modest rebound we're experiencing."</TE>
<TE>   In July, a scant 6,000 new jobs were generated as firms kept a
tight rein on hiring. Although the unemployment rate was unchanged in
July from the June level of 5.9%, the gain in the number of jobs was
far below economists' expectations. For August, economists expect the
unemployment rate to be unchanged and for 37,000 new jobs to be
created.</TE>
<TE>   The pace of economic growth also is being closely monitored by
bond investors. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note has
declined by more than 1 percentage point since the end of March, as
some investors anticipated a faltering economy would keep inflation
in check and prompt the Federal Reserve to leave its target interest
rate at a 41-year low until next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Treasuries have done pretty well as people pushed back their
forecasts for when the economy will grow strongly again," said Ken
Anderson, fixed-income manager at Evergreen Investments. "We won't
see higher rates out of the Fed any time soon."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, with interest rates so low that investors may be lured
back to the stock market, and with many analysts saying stocks have
been beaten down to the point that they are starting to look like
bargains, it's possible that September might defy history this time
around.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that September has a bad reputation, but I think the
situation this [year] is much more likely to be positive than
negative," said Tim Kochis, financial planner with Kochis &amp; Fitz in
San Francisco. "We are still coming off a quite significant
revaluation of [stock prices] in July.</TE>
<TE>   "But all bets would be off if there is on Sept. 11 some evil
anniversary repetition of what happened last year, or if the rhetoric
turned to military activity against Iraq. That would obviously dampen
what might otherwise be a very positive month."</TE>

<HD>Microsoft, PacketVideo Extend Delivery Reach</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Deal gives the software giant key foothold in the
mobile multimedia market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. said Monday that PacketVideo Inc. has agreed to use
its digital media delivery format, in a deal that gives the software
giant a key foothold into the nascent market for mobile multimedia
content delivery.</LD>
<LD>   PacketVideo, which had previously been seen as a key Microsoft
rival in the race to bring rich video and audio content to mobile
phones and mobile devices, said that the deal with Microsoft would
help expand its range of customers.</LD>
<LD>   PacketVideo, a privately held company based in San Diego, develops
software to send and receive video and audio over wireless networks,
one of the key selling points for third-generation mobile phone
services.</LD>
<TE>   Microsoft, eager to extend the reach of its software beyond the
desktop, has been pouring resources into developing software to send
and receive content such as news, music and sports clips to a variety
of devices.</TE>
<TE>   While cross-town digital media rival software maker RealNetworks
Inc. has a slight lead in the market for its desktop media player,
Microsoft has been trying to get its software into a variety of
devices.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an extension of the strategy we've had," said Michael
Aldridge, lead product manager at Microsoft's Windows digital media
division.</TE>
<TE>   PacketVideo will offer the Windows Media 9 Series format alongside
its own proprietary wireless content delivery format.</TE>
<TE>   "Our customers are asking for support for Microsoft," said
PacketVideo President and Chief Executive James Brailean.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft is set to release Wednesday the beta version of Windows
Media 9, its latest digital streaming format formerly code-named
"Corona," along with new delivery and playback software.</TE>
<TE>   One of the challenges facing wireless carriers hoping to deliver
video and audio over 3G networks is the multitude of handsets and
software that have to be able to play digital video streams.</TE>
<TE>   PacketVideo already is deploying its technology in Japan through
NTT DoCoMo Inc., Japan's largest mobile phone carrier and pioneer for
3G services.</TE>
<TE>   Although 3G services are up and running in Japan, U.S. wireless
carriers have yet to launch full-fledged 3G networks and services,
causing some to question whether Microsoft and PacketVideo might be
jumping the gun.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood, Tech Piracy Efforts May Curtail Choices</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Meeting the demand for secure content could
limit consumers' use of TV shows, movies and songs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN and JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>REDMOND, Wash.</DL>
<LD>As the entertainment and technology industries publicly are locking
horns over electronic piracy, they privately are moving closer to a
consensus that consumer advocates fear may limit how people watch or
listen to movies and music.</LD>
<LD>   The fight focuses on how entertainment will be distributed in the
future, particularly the digital transmission of movies and music to
homes by broadcast and the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Studios and record labels want their products protected from the
widespread thievery popularized by services such as Napster. Spurred
by the threat of federal legislation, technology companies such as
Microsoft Corp. and RealNetworks Inc. are scrambling to prove that
their systems do more than the other fellow's to keep content under
lock and key.</LD>
<TE>   Microsoft has been particularly aggressive, launching a number of
efforts to satisfy entertainment moguls' hunger for security in a
digital age when content can be perfectly reproduced millions of
times. Other companies are making similar efforts, chasing what they
see as lucrative business at a time of flagging technology sales.</TE>
<TE>   But Microsoft, which faces its own considerable battle against
pirates, would give copyright owners unprecedented power.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking at their new innovation, and I was very much
impressed," Motion Picture Assn. of America President Jack Valenti
said after a trip to Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., headquarters. "Some
of the plans they had certainly could include my [member] companies."</TE>
<TE>   Those plans center on three efforts, including Microsoft's latest
Media Player, to be unveiled Wednesday in Los Angeles by company
founder Bill Gates.</TE>
<TE>   * Media Player 9, like competing offerings from RealNetworks and
Apple Computer Inc., is designed to make Internet video look more
like a TV broadcast, with less delay and crisper quality.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, it also will improve content owners' ability to
manage the rules they set for users, so that a song or clip can be
downloaded but not copied, or can be made to disappear from a
computer after a day or a week.</TE>
<TE>   "Giving the content owners flexibility in how they assign rights
and bring content to consumers has been a huge focus of ours," said
Will Poole, Microsoft corporate vice president for new media.</TE>
<TE>   Movielink, the fledgling multi-studio effort to offer films
online, is expected to use the Windows Media format, movie executives
said, though it may also use software from RealNetworks.</TE>
<TE>   Pressplay, one of the two major record label-owned music services,
already uses Windows Media.</TE>
<TE>   * Today, Hewlett-Packard Co. will announce a new type of home
computer based on Microsoft's Windows XP operating system and aimed
at the living room, a top unclaimed prize for Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   At a cost of $1,500 to $2,000, the XP Media Center Edition allows
viewers to surf the Web and watch cable or broadcast TV programming
and record that material on a high-capacity hard drive or DVD--but
not copy it, play it back on the bedroom television or e-mail it.</TE>
<TE>   "In the abstract, that certainly works for us," said Andy Setos,
president of engineering for Fox Group.</TE>
<TE>   "From a consumer perspective, it is obviously not optimal" to
prevent TV shows from being played back on other DVD players or
computers, said Mark Bony, product manager for HP's Pavilion line of
home PCs. But "this is a feature that Microsoft felt very strongly
about."</TE>
<TE>   * Microsoft's Palladium design initiative, begun with both content
protection and security in mind, would bar computer users from doing
some things in a walled-off part of their machines.</TE>
<TE>   The multiyear Palladium plan knits hardware and software to create
a virtual vault that would be protected from hackers. But a key
attraction for Microsoft is that it would encourage consumer deals
with trusted third parties--a bank, for example, or Blockbuster,
which could lend a video over the Internet for a day on condition
that it could check in the vault and delete unapproved content.</TE>
<TE>   In process for years, Palladium gathered momentum recently in
response to film industry feedback.</TE>
<TE>   "Microsoft has finally admitted that what it really needs to do is
Palladium," Fox's Setos said. The implication, he said, is that
"everything before Palladium is really not as secure as they'd like,
and we agree with them."</TE>
<TE>   A number of privacy and consumer activists are concerned. More
ominous for some are things Microsoft hasn't announced, such as
changes in its small-type licensing agreements with those who
downloaded a security patch for Media Player in the last month.</TE>
<TE>   Those agreements give Microsoft the authority to disable
bootlegged content or software Microsoft doesn't like--such as a
peer-to-peer file-swapping application or copying mechanism--on
consumers' machines.</TE>
<TE>   That provision has made entertainment executives very happy, a
Microsoft strategist said.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all of the proposals could be used to limit what
consumers do, potentially eroding what generally has been considered
the fair use of songs, television shows and movies.</TE>
<TE>   No law or court ruling has required companies to make it easy--or
even possible--for consumers to copy or customize copyrighted works
for personal use. That means it's up to tech companies to figure out
how to help consumers do that.</TE>
<TE>   A Microsoft lobbyist said without firm legal guidance on fair use,
the decisions belong in the marketplace. "If consumers are demanding
the right to make one copy, that's going to be something you have to
work out with your consumers," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Poole said the new entertainment arrangements will be good for
consumers, whatever restrictions are attached.</TE>
<TE>   "If we continue to do as good a job as we think we're doing,
consumers are going to get much more than they could get before," he
said, citing out-of-syndication television series and older recorded
music as examples.</TE>
<TE>   But it may not sit well with the audience, who ultimately will
decide with their wallets where the balance lies between security and
freedom.</TE>
<TE>   The record companies have learned that too many restrictions make
their services uncompetitive with pirated offerings. Their efforts to
peddle downloadable music that can't be copied or moved to portable
devices have been a near-total failure. Consumers instead flock to
unauthorized sites offering unfettered music for free.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, consumers may well reject the upcoming Microsoft
entertainment offerings, preferring to stay with DVDs or pirated
content until restrictions are eased. The longer it takes for
entertainment and technology companies to come up with a formula that
consumers embrace, the more difficult it may be to transform the
Internet from a pirates' haven into a legitimate distribution
pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Microsoft wants a world where digital rights
management technology controlled by Hollywood essentially rules the
roost. But if they sense that's the way the wind is blowing, of
course they are going to be the No. 1 vendor," said Joe Kraus,
co-founder of the Web portal Excite and advocacy group
DigitalConsumer.org</TE>
<TE>   The biggest spur to the intensified negotiations between Hollywood
and technology companies is legislation. For example, a bill by Sen.
Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) would require government-approved
anti-piracy devices in computers and consumer electronics.</TE>
<TE>   Another motivator is economics. Computer makers are mired in a
slump, and many believe only high-quality media content will drive
consumers to buy more machines and pay for broadband access to the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   In its dealings with the entertainment industry, Microsoft in some
respects is coming from behind.</TE>
<TE>   Apple has focused more closely and for longer on media consumers
and producers, and its tools are popular with entertainment
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Apple also has made friendly business-model overtures, making its
iPod digital music player incapable of transferring songs from one
computer to another.</TE>
<TE>   But Apple has gotten "nothing concrete" in return, Chief Executive
Steve Jobs said. Entertainment executives said Apple has been less
accommodating than Microsoft and even schizophrenic, urging consumers
in one ad to "rip, mix, burn" their own CDs, which is legal to do.</TE>
<TE>   We're trying to walk a middle path, helping copyright owners but
allowing users the rights they are entitled to," Jobs said.</TE>
<TE>   RealNetworks also has been offering content companies greater
flexibility, which is the main thing studios lately are seeking, said
Brad Hefta-Gaub, a vice president for product development.</TE>
<TE>   Although the original rights-management technologies were used
mainly to give consumers a free sample for a limited time, he said,
entertainment companies now want to use those technologies to create
rental businesses, flat-rate subscription services and a variety of
hybrids.</TE>
<TE>   The studios also have been seeking better sound and picture
quality from all three companies. Until the quality and convenience
match what consumers get from TV, Setos said, there's no point in
offering movies over the Net.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft has been playing catch-up to Real in providing
entertainment to accompany its media player.</TE>
<TE>   When it unveils the latest version of Windows Media Player on
Wednesday, Microsoft is expected to announce more music and video
content deals.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft can offer more direct access to more computer users than
Apple or Real, and its digital rights technology already has the
benefit of $250 million worth of research and development.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor in Microsoft's favor is a shared attitude about
piracy. Microsoft says 25% of its software used in the United States
is unauthorized, and the proportion is vastly higher in other parts
of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "There is much more similarity between Microsoft and Hollywood
than is generally recognized," said Andy Bechtolscheim, a Cisco
Systems Inc. vice president who has been promoting an open
distribution format that would require device users to seek
electronic permission from content owners for each viewing.</TE>
<TE>   But even some of Microsoft's closest allies in the computing
world, top chip maker Intel Corp. and Cisco, the biggest manufacturer
of specialized machines for routing Internet traffic, take issue with
the unbridled nature of Microsoft's Hollywood come-ons.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's a tenable position to say we're just going to
put technology out there and sure, it will step on consumer fair
use," said Don Whiteside, Intel vice president of legal and
government affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco's Bechtolscheim agreed. "Just because people have been able
to play it however they want, doesn't mean they will continue to be
able to," he said. "This ought to get people riled up."</TE>

<HD>Saudis, Venezuela Bicker Over Oil Quotas</HD>
<DH>Energy: OPEC will meet Sept. 19 to discuss possible changes
in export limits. The price of international benchmark Brent has
risen by one-third this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OPEC members quarreled openly Monday ahead of a meeting at which they
will decide whether to pump more oil to prevent high crude prices
that could stunt a global economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Saudi Arabia responded that talk of a specific Saudi position was
untrue after Venezuela said Saudi Arabia wished to extend current
output curbs when the oil cartel meets Sept. 19.</LD>
<LD>   Saudi Oil Minister Ali Ibrahim Naimi said in remarks forwarded by
the state-run Saudi Press Agency that adjustments to the Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' output ceiling would be made at
the meeting to be held in Osaka, Japan, by consensus and after
consultations between ministers.</LD>
<TE>   "There seems to be a breakdown in communications in OPEC," said
Nauman Barakat of brokerage Fimat International Banque. "It's
possible the Venezuelans are trying to push the Saudis into a
position that they don't want to take."</TE>
<TE>   The row harked back to OPEC before 1999, when a previously divided
cartel reunited around a series of drastic curbs that laid the basis
of a three-year price boom.</TE>
<TE>   International benchmark Brent crude oil, which has climbed by
one-third since the start of the year, closed 7 cents higher at
$27.54 a barrel Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Saturday that his country
firmly opposed boosting production, and that Saudi Arabia shared that
view.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela's oil minister reiterated the position Monday, arguing
that current prices contained a $4-per-barrel premium, reflecting
fears of a U.S.-Iraq war.</TE>
<TE>   Countries with oil-dependent economies are pressing the Middle
East-dominated group to relax supply quotas, arguing that lower
prices would strengthen the global economic recovery. After three
years of high prices and output curbs, many OPEC countries are
struggling to contain growing volumes of idle output capacity.</TE>
<TE>   The group pumped 9% over its agreed output ceiling in July, the
highest level of quota-busting since 1998, when OPEC bickering led to
an oil price war and financial crisis in exporting countries.</TE>
<TE>   OPEC ministers are keen to avoid a repeat of an OPEC meeting in
Jakarta in 1997, which preceded the last oil price crash. At that
meeting, OPEC raised its output ceiling to legitimize quota cheating
just before an economic crisis in Asia, which sharply shrank demand.</TE>
<TE>   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said Sunday that the cartel should
be careful not to tip oil markets into oversupply by raising
production too much.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be cautious. There is danger of putting too much oil into
the markets," Lukman said. "There is no danger of putting too little
oil in. We can always fix that."</TE>
<TE>   While OPEC is worried about oversupply, importing countries fear
price spikes this winter.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Energy Information Administration has argued that oil
stockpiles could get dangerously low by year-end if OPEC members
failed to boost exports.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Red Sea Group of Israel has acquired another commercial property as
part of its plan to build a Southern California real estate portfolio
of $350 million or more.</LD>
<LD>   Its latest purchase is a 101,000-square-foot office building in
Warner Center housing the headquarters of Wella Corp. USA, a
subsidiary of German personal care products maker Wella.</LD>
<LD>   The seller of the two-story building at 6109 DeSoto Ave. in
Woodland Hills was a group of individual investors that received
about $22 million for the property, said Red Sea Vice President Mitch
Kralis.</LD>
<TE>   Wella Corp. USA relocated its headquarters from New Jersey to the
Warner Center building in early 2001. Wella's lease of the entire
property--which includes a training salon and a small store--runs for
another eight years, Kralis said.</TE>
<TE>   Red Sea's first Southern California purchase was another property
entirely leased to a single tenant: AT&amp;T Corp.'s 288,000-square-foot
data center complex in Hawthorne. The Dallas-based U.S. Red Sea unit
is thought to have paid about $43 million in March for that facility.</TE>
<TE>   The Aug. 24 Warner Center deal was arranged by brokers Jeffrey
Goodfriend of Lee &amp; Associates, and Alan Levy and David Meir of
RE/MAX. Teachers Insurance &amp; Annuity Assn. provided mortgage
financing.</TE>
<TE>   Red Sea intends to buy $350 million to $500 million worth of Los
Angeles-area income properties within the next two years, said
Kralis, adding that Red Sea is bullish on Warner Center's long-term
future as the commercial hub of the western San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Center has seen some substantial real estate trades this
year, even though commercial real estate investment activity in
Southern California in general is down.</TE>
<TE>   An office and warehouse building a block away from Wella occupied
by movie-equipment maker Panavision was sold recently, reportedly for
$14 million. Investors also have agreed to purchase nearby Warner
Center Business Park for an estimated $55 million, as well as the
district's signature Warner Center Plaza high-rise towers for nearly
$340 million.</TE>

<LD>Nominations were due to the Securities and Exchange Commission by
Monday for the new Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and
former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker continues to be
Washington's inside favorite to head the new board.</LD>
<LD>   But some reports have said Volcker may not be interested.</LD>
<LD>   The oversight board was mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
corporate reforms that President Bush signed into law July 30.</LD>
<TE>   The new five-member board will have the power to regulate and
discipline the accounting industry, taking over for a much weaker
oversight board that dissolved itself earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC must fill the board's slots within 90 days of Bush's
signature on the bill.</TE>
<TE>   All of the members must be full-time and two of the five must be
certified public accountants.</TE>
<TE>   Several published reports have listed Volcker as the SEC's top
choice to chair the board. But the New York Times recently reported
that friends of Volcker say he may not want the job.</TE>
<TE>   Also reported to be candidates for the board are Donald J. Kirk,
former chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the
industry's rule-making body; and Arthur Levitt, former SEC chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the SEC must consult with Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill in
choosing the board's members.</TE>

<KH>A YEAR AFTER</KH>
<HD>Companies Prepared to Pause Purposefully to Mark Sept. 11</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS and LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, worker
productivity and consumer spending are expected to slow as Americans
take time to commemorate the day in ways public and private.</LD>
<LD>   They will pause, once again. And this time the slowdown will be
purposeful, with a sharpened sense of community and resolve.</LD>
<LD>   "It is my guess that every organization, company and individual
will find a way to commemorate the day somehow," said Frank Scanlan,
a spokesman for the Society for Human Resource Management in
Alexandria, Va. "Planting a tree, a moment of silence, meditating
alone at home ... it's appropriate if it takes time out of the usual
hectic day and it feels right."</LD>
<TE>   Businesses will give employees room to reflect and time off to
participate in church and community services. Retailers and other
marketers will pull back on advertising and promotions to respect the
mood of consumers, and the travel industry expects sluggish activity.</TE>
<TE>   This year "the country will be somewhat immobilized that day,"
said Thom Nulty, president of Navigant International Inc., a travel
management concern in Englewood, Colo., that handles travel for many
large companies.</TE>
<TE>   "We are projecting slower-than-normal travel that entire week,"
Nulty said. "It's not that people are afraid something will happen.
Psychologically they're feeling a need to not be traveling."</TE>
<TE>   Airports will be less crowded, with traffic expected to be subdued
and solemn pilots asking passengers to remember those who were lost.
Several online travel services, including Travelocity and Expedia,
have reported that bookings for the day's flights are down 20% as of
the last week of August from where they were at the same time last
year.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear what kind of economic effect this year's Sept. 11
slowdown will have on the travel industry, which lost $36 billion in
travel spending last year. Yet even in normal times, a Wednesday in
mid-September would be seasonally slow for most industries.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some companies are explicitly giving employees the week
off from travel, and agents said those that are still flying for
business are requesting return dates of Sept. 10 rather than Sept.
12. The worry is that if anything should happen Sept. 11 they don't
want to be stranded from loved ones as they were last year.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Schmidt, who owns a computer software company called Smartware
Inc. in Austin, Texas, said he gave his sales team the option of
flying on or around Sept. 11 "to give them some extra family time if
they needed it." Several employees still will be traveling to
appointments that day but most have chosen to stay home, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were finding that clients don't want to be spending the day
talking about systems upgrades when there's services to attend and
prayers to be said anyway," Schmidt said. "It's going to be a slow
week for us. But then again, I guess it should be."</TE>
<TE>   One small, privately held domestic carrier, Spirit Airlines, is
letting passengers fly free Sept. 11. The Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.-based
airline, whose 14 destinations include Los Angeles, said its 13,000
seats on 90 flights were snatched up in only a few hours after Spirit
announced the promotion Aug. 6.</TE>
<TE>   In Las Vegas, bookings remain about the same as they did leading
up to last Sept. 11, but officials expect subdued crowds, and some
shows have chosen to go dark.</TE>
<TE>   Stores are likely to be relatively quiet Sept. 11, retail experts
predict, but most will be open and conducting business as usual.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you'll see retailers mimic what consumers are doing,"
said Scott Krugman, spokesman for the National Retail Federation in
Washington. "They're going to quietly go about their day-to-day lives
on Sept 11."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to be a day when people are in a pretty somber
mood," said Michael Baker, director of research for the International
Council of Shopping Centers in New York. "I don't think it's going to
lend itself to a shopping spree."</TE>
<TE>   But with retailers already worried about softer sales in light of
a disappointing back-to-school shopping season, some may "hit the
panic button" and begin marking down merchandise, said Marshal Cohen,
co-president of market research firm NPD Fashion World. Last year,
retailers slashed prices to pull customers back into stores, and may
feel they have to follow suit this year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They won't call it a 9/11 anniversary sale, but it's certainly
going to be one," Cohen said. "Retailers are operating on a very
short leash. That means at any sign of trouble or short sales verses
the year before, they will push this promotions button and [cut
prices]."</TE>
<TE>   Still, overall revenue for the day and month almost certainly will
be stronger than last year, when stunned Americans sat glued to their
television sets and some shopping centers shut down completely. In
the days and weeks after Sept. 11, some consumers continued to shy
away from malls, fearing they could become the target of terrorists,
and sales there fell 8.1% last September, according to the shopping
centers council.</TE>
<TE>   In all, retailers lost about $6.3 billion in sales as a result of
terrorist attacks, according to the National Retail Federation.</TE>
<TE>   With the anniversary of that grim period nearing, some retailers
have decided to pull back on promotions and advertising, retail
experts say. Target Corp., for example, will suspend TV advertising
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Other major advertisers, too, are reluctant to run television
commercials on Sept. 11 for fear of being viewed as insensitive. Some
though are looking for "tasteful" ways to sponsor network programs.</TE>
<TE>   Companies such as General Motors Corp. and Pepsi-Cola Co. are
refraining from buying television ads, but a few, including Boeing
Co. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. plan to be on the air Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The four major networks are planning several hours each of Sept.
11-related programming.</TE>
<TE>   Most companies are planning some sort of gesture, however low-key,
to commemorate the day, according the Society for Human Resource
Management. A recent poll of its 170,000 members showed a moment of
silence to be the most popular workplace choice, followed by time off
to attend services or be with family, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The group also has recommended holding brown bag lunches with a
special speaker, having counseling services available and
distributing ribbons or flags to wear at work. Kmart Corp. is
encouraging employees to wear red, white and blue on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Sydney Kamlager of the Employers Group, a human resource
management firm with 2,000 members in Los Angeles and Orange
counties, said many companies are letting employees decide how to
spend Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Because there's never been a day like it before, we have to let
individuals set the mood, and allow the workday to go where it will,"
Kamlager said.</TE>
<TE>   Some 8,000 employees of Eastman Chemical Co. will participate in a
community service hosted by 35 churches at the chemical manufacturing
plant in Kingsport, Tenn., said spokeswoman Nancy Ledford. The
service, which will run throughout the day, is open to the town of
45,000 residents too.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a continuous operation in chemical manufacturing, 24 hours
a day, so we can't stop production or just slow down like that,"
Ledford said. "What we can do, though, is make sure our workers have
time to be part of something bigger here in the community and right
here on our plant."</TE>
<TE>   American Airlines and United Airlines, whose jetliners were used
by the terrorists, also are planning remembrances, especially to
honor the crew members they lost.</TE>
<TE>   Their employees will wear commemorative ribbons and will pause for
moments of silence. Their pilots will ask "passengers and crews to
reflect for a moment on the significance of the day," said United
spokesman Chris Brathwaite.</TE>
<TE>   According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, more than 170
communities nationwide have plans for formal Sept. 11 anniversary
events ranging from candlelight vigils to stadium-sized ceremonies.
With so much going on, it may not be reasonable to expect normal
production levels from employees, Scanlan said.</TE>

<HD>UAL Selects Oilman to Pilot Troubled Carrier</HD>
<DH>Aviation: ChevronTexaco's Glenn Tilton will try to turn
around United. He brings a fresh perspective but lacks experience
with unions and airlines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>United Airlines reached outside the airline business Monday and
tapped oil-industry veteran Glenn Tilton to be chief executive of the
embattled carrier and its parent, UAL Corp. United's No. 2 and 3
executives also resigned from the airline under pressure from
United's powerful unions.</LD>
<LD>   Tilton, vice chairman of oil giant ChevronTexaco Corp., was
elected chairman, CEO and president by UAL's board. The airline, 55%
owned by its employees, is teetering toward a bankruptcy
reorganization because United's financial condition is rapidly
eroding in the face of the slump in air travel and United's high
operating costs.</LD>
<LD>   But the election of Tilton, 54, will affect the future not only of
United's 84,000 employees and its millions of customers. It also
could have ripple effects for airline passengers, as United is the
nation's second-largest airline behind AMR Corp.'s American Airlines.</LD>
<TE>   Tilton hasn't yet outlined his plans, but the ways in which he
decides to steer UAL--in or out of Bankruptcy Court--also could
prompt changes by United's rivals in terms of service, routes and
fares as they strive to stay competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Tilton succeeds Jack Creighton, who became interim CEO last fall.
UAL had been searching for a permanent CEO the last few months, and
speculation was high that it would pick a non-airline executive to
bring a fresh approach to the struggling carrier. UAL lost an
industry record $2.1 billion in 2001 and is expected to lose an
additional $1 billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   Creighton is a former timber-products executive who had been a UAL
director. As the company looked for his successor, Creighton, 70,
tried to forge agreements with United's unions on multibillion-dollar
wage and other concessions to help right the airline. He made little
progress.</TE>
<TE>   Creighton, in fact, warned last month that United would have to
file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection this fall if it failed to
secure the necessary concessions from its employees, lenders and
vendors within 30 days. But some union officials said they were
reluctant to make changes until a new CEO was in place.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Line Pilots Assn. and the International Assn. of
Machinists--which have representatives on UAL's board and thus a key
voice in choosing the CEO--issued statements vowing to work with
Tilton on a recovery plan. But they also had said they'd work with
Creighton, and long-standing animosity between United's management
and employees continued to hinder progress.</TE>
<TE>   Now "they have to make huge changes" if United is to avoid filing
for Bankruptcy Court protection, said Ron Kuhlmann, vice president of
the aviation consulting firm Unisys R2A of Hayward, Calif. United
must quickly find ways of generating more revenue and reducing its
costs "no matter who the person is sitting at the head desk," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   Tilton said in a statement that "despite the significant
challenges we face, United is a company with tremendous strengths on
which we can build. Our highest priorities must be to restore
employee trust and revive investor and customer confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Tilton is assuming enormous challenges in running United,
an Elk Grove Village, Ill.-based carrier that has 1,900 flights a day
to several continents. It operates hubs in Chicago and Denver and is
the largest operator at Los Angeles International Airport. Among the
obstacles:</TE>
<TE>   * Tilton has no airline experience, and little experience as a CEO
and in dealing with a heavily unionized work force. Having spent most
of his career climbing the corporate ladder at Texaco Inc., he
finally became Texaco's CEO in early 2001 only to have Texaco
acquired by Chevron a few months later. Tilton became vice chairman
of the new ChevronTexaco under Chairman and CEO David O'Reilly.</TE>
<TE>   * Tilton doesn't have much time. United faces debt payments and
other bills of about $1 billion in the coming months, continues to
lose $1 million or more each day from operations and says it's unable
to borrow from the financial markets. United has applied for a
$1.8-billion federal loan guarantee to attain more financing, but the
government board in charge of the loan guarantees first expects
United to secure concessions from its employees, creditors and
suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   * While having to quickly come to terms with United's unions,
Tilton also must find others to run the airline in place of United
President Rono Dutta and Chief Operating Officer Andrew Studdert.
Their roles will be assumed by existing senior managers for the time
being, United said.</TE>
<TE>   Amid these problems, "it's going to be tough, when you've had the
history these guys have had," said Rich Gritta, professor of finance
and transportation at the University of Portland in Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Some Wall Street analysts said Monday they knew little or nothing
about Tilton.</TE>
<TE>   But one oil industry executive who has worked with him over the
years said that Tilton developed a reputation as a strong
communicator, especially during the anxiety-filled months before
Texaco's merger with Chevron.</TE>
<TE>   "Glenn is the kind of guy who's as comfortable with the person on
the shop floor as in the board room," said the manager, who spoke on
the condition that he not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   The unions representing pilots and mechanics were longtime critics
of Dutta and Studdert. Both resigned Monday "to afford Mr. Tilton
wider latitude to fill these key positions," United said. "This is an
opportunity for United's new CEO to put in place a team capable of
managing a multibillion-dollar employee-owned company," said Tom
Buffenbarger, head of the machinists union.</TE>
<TE>   Dutta and Studdert couldn't immediately be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Tilton, a native of Washington, D.C., earned a bachelor's degree
in international relations from the University of South Carolina in
1970, then joined Texaco as a sales trainee.</TE>
<TE>   He became president of Texaco Europe in 1992, president of Texaco
USA in 1994 and Texaco's CEO in early 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Tilton also was interim chairman of ailing energy trader Dynegy
Inc., in which ChevronTexaco has a 24.6% interest. He resigned that
post, along with his ChevronTexaco job, on Monday.</TE>

<HD>Vice Fund Hopes Cigarettes, Booze Pay Off</HD>
<DH>Mutuals: The portfolio's investments will focus on
so-called sin stocks, such as Philip Morris and Anheuser-Busch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHIE O'DONNELL</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Vanguard Group has a ship as its logo. T. Rowe Price Group Inc. uses
a bighorn sheep.</LD>
<LD>   To represent its new Vice Fund, Mutuals.com chose a cigarette, a
martini, dice and a gun sight.</LD>
<LD>   Vice Fund, which begins trading today, will be the first open-end
mutual fund focused on "socially irresponsible" investments, buying
shares of companies such as Philip Morris Cos., Anheuser-Busch Cos.,
Harrah's Entertainment Inc. and Lockheed Martin Corp., said
co-manager Dan Ahrens.</LD>
<TE>   So-called sin stocks perform well in good times and bad, said
Ahrens, who will run the portfolio for Dallas-based Mutuals.com with
Eric McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the new portfolio also shows that, with more than 8,300
mutual funds competing for investor assets, some money management
firms must turn to gimmicks to raise money, said Russel Kinnel,
analyst at fund tracker Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. "When you're
working at an obscure shop, running an obscure fund, you have an
incentive to do this kind of thing because that kind of name gets
more ink," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Portfolios such as Vice Fund have a narrow focus, subjecting
investors to bigger swings in price, some analysts say. When the
fund's industries are in favor, it can put up big returns because of
its concentration in those stocks; that and the catchy name help lure
investors' cash, Kinnel said. The flip side is such funds can incur
bigger-than-average losses too.</TE>
<TE>   Ahrens, 36, said Vice Fund will prove critics wrong. A
subscription phase for the fund, during which investors could buy
shares for $10 each, began Aug. 15 and ended Friday. Ahrens said he
didn't yet know how much money the fund raised in all.</TE>
<TE>   Mutuals.com, founded in 1994, has about $240 million in assets
under management. Four no-load mutual funds that invest in other
funds--so-called funds of funds--account for just under $100 million
of that. Managers of Vice Fund will pick their own stocks, Ahrens
said. He said his firm's experience in sifting through funds to
select offerings for its funds of funds will help.</TE>
<TE>   Ahrens is also vice president of distribution at Mutuals.com. He
started his financial services career in 1988, working in the
insurance industry before joining the firm in 1999. McDonald,
president of Mutuals.com, worked as a stockbroker for two firms in
Dallas before joining Mutuals.com in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Kinnel said he knew of only one other fund that focused on sin
stocks, a closed-end fund called Morgan FunShares Inc. (ticker
symbol: MFUN).</TE>
<TE>   Unlike open-end funds, whose shares are always redeemable at net
asset value, closed-end funds issue a specific number of shares that
trade on exchanges, similar to regular stocks. Shares of Morgan
FunShares, founded in 1994, recently traded at a 21% discount to net
asset value. They closed at $5.40 on Nasdaq on Friday; the price is
down 25% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan FunShares invests in companies whose products and services
tend to be habitual, said Robert Pincus, president of the fund.
Besides liquor, tobacco and gambling stocks, the fund also invests in
shares of chewing gum maker Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. and Coca-Cola Co.</TE>
<TE>   "These consumer companies have held up probably better than the
broad market," Pincus said.</TE>

<HD>Car Rams Into Crowd; 13 Hurt</HD>
<DH>Accident: Police are investigating why an elderly driver's
car lurched into pedestrians at the Balboa ferry pier. Three are
hospitalized.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thirteen people, including a 1 1/2-year-old boy, were injured Monday
after an out-of-control car tore through a crowd at the Balboa Island
ferry pier in Newport Beach, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The three people most seriously hurt were taken to Western Medical
Center-Santa Ana with internal injuries and broken limbs. The driver,
Mary Anne Nash, 87, of Newport Beach, was shaken but otherwise not
hurt. She was placed in a police car for questioning.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said the auto was traveling 25 to 35 mph when it plowed
into people as they disembarked the ferry, scattering them like pins
struck by a bowling ball.</LD>
<TE>   People were screaming and sunglasses and beach towels went flying,
witnesses said. One person who fell into the water was pulled to
safety by strangers. A woman's handbag had to be pried out of the
car's grill.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in the group getting off the ferry when all of a sudden you
saw garbage cans and then people flying in the air," said Mark
DeAntonio of Costa Mesa, who was out for a Labor Day bike ride.
DeAntonio said he jumped off his bicycle and leaped out of the way to
avoid the car, which stopped about 10 feet from him.</TE>
<TE>   The car came to a halt when its right tires dropped between a
pedestrian walkway and a vehicle ramp to the ferry. DeAntonio said
six to eight people were on the ground moaning in pain.</TE>
<TE>   Nash's car was second in line on Balboa Island, waiting for the
ferry to Balboa Peninsula when the accident occurred, officers said.
The 65-foot ferry, carrying a car and at least two dozen people, had
just docked. Police said Nash told them that she restarted her car
when it "suddenly lurched forward," swerved left, went onto the
sidewalk and crashed into pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   "She said the car just lurched, took off. Whether it malfunctioned
or not, I don't know. That's being investigated," said Randy
Scheerer, Newport Beach division fire chief.</TE>
<TE>   He said Nash's car traveled about 75 feet, scraped a wall, then
sheared off a row of newspaper racks. Police did not know how fast
Nash had been traveling, but witnesses estimated the car was
traveling about 25 to 35 mph. There were no skid marks, Scheerer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Nash had not taken alcohol or drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Shelly Shook and Shannon Maguire, both 14, had been pedaling their
bicycles near the ferry crossing.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw her pull out of the line and then there were tons of
people just flying after she hit them," Maguire said.</TE>
<TE>   The injured ranged in age from 1 1/2 to 62.</TE>
<TE>   Those most severely injured--Kathleen Bingley, 44, of Orange;
Marla Goldberg, 47, of Woodland Hills; and an unidentified
14-year-old from Las Vegas--were taken to Western Medical
Center-Santa Ana. Bingley was treated for internal injuries, Goldberg
suffered a broken arm and the teenager had a broken leg.</TE>
<TE>   The others who were injured were treated and released from Hoag
Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach. They included:
Scott, 47, and Jackie Andrews, 49, both of Las Vegas; John Ramirez,
31, of Long Beach; Gina Yenser, 31, Pat Rost, 62, and Denise Allen,
34, all of Las Vegas; Francis Gauthier, 39, of Quebec, Canada; John
Yarter 34, of Tustin, and Kenneth Breland, 40, of Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   The 1 1/2-year old from Costa Mesa was not identified, nor was the
extent of his injuries known.</TE>
<TE>   The ferries travel the 900 feet between the shops and beach houses
of Balboa Island and those of Balboa Peninsula.</TE>

<HD>Labor Day Starts This Party</HD>
<DH>Democrats: Local leaders emphasize their blue-collar roots
at an annual rally that traditionally kicks off the campaign season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a celebration of working people, Ventura County Democrats on
Monday emphasized the strengths of three women at the top of their
local ticket at a traditional Labor Day picnic kicking off the fall
campaign season.</LD>
<LD>   About 300 union members and Democratic activists congregated at a
seaside Oxnard park in a tribute to their party's blue-collar
traditions and in recognition of the emergency workers who responded
at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   "Going back to 9/11, it was the first responders who are now all
heroes. Who were they? Working men and women," said U.S. Rep. Lois
Capps (D-Santa Barbara).</LD>
<TE>   One after another, from the top of the local ticket to the bottom,
Democrats had the chance to polish speeches and line up volunteers to
take their messages to thousands of doorsteps before the Nov. 5
election.</TE>
<TE>   Picnickers applauded Capps and two other incumbent women seeking
reelection Nov. 5--all of whom represent portions of coastal Ventura
County.</TE>
<TE>   "The Best Man for the Job is a Woman," read a button on a straw
hat worn by county Democratic Party Chairwoman Sharon Hillbrant.</TE>
<TE>   Because of once-a-decade redistricting, Capps now represents
Oxnard, Port Hueneme and a bit of Ventura as well as Santa Barbara
and San Luis Obispo counties. Assemblywoman Fran Pavley (D-Agoura
Hills) also inherited a chunk of Oxnard to go with her Los Angeles
County district. Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara)
saw her portion of west Ventura County expand into Oxnard as well.</TE>
<TE>   A fourth woman lawmaker, state Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica),
is not up for reelection this year but also represents Oxnard after
redistricting.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, three Republicans--Tony Strickland, Tom McClintock
and Elton Gallegly--represented the city in the Assembly, state
Senate and the House of Representatives. But the rejiggering of
districts moved their districts out of Oxnard, a Democratic
stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a 180-degree political shift," Pavley said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson told the crowd that the new districts mean Oxnard finally
will have some clout in Sacramento because of Kuehl, Pavley and
herself. Both houses of the Legislature are dominated by Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "That's better than the nonrepresentation you've had the last many
years," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Pavley said of Jackson: "She and I work very well together and
agree on about everything."</TE>
<TE>   The preservation of Ormond Beach, a bird and wildlife sanctuary
and the county's largest privately owned, undeveloped stretch of
oceanfront, unified the candidates. "One of my highest priorities is
to acquire the land and restore [it]," Pavley said of 750 acres of
Ormond wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   The state Coastal Conservancy has bought about 270 acres and hopes
to soon close a deal for 270 more.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you like that--I'm represented at last," said Jean Harris,
co-founder of a group seeking to preserve Ormond Beach. "Fran even
talked about Ormond Beach. This is exciting, all these women doing
all the right things."</TE>
<TE>   At the top of the candidates' list of goals are coastal
preservation, environmental protection, affordable medications for
senior citizens and greater spending for education.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike two years ago, when costly campaigns were shaping up for
several local legislative seats, this fall's races involve what are
generally regarded as safe seats for incumbent Democrats and
Republicans alike. But a key message to loyalists Monday was not to
relax, but to campaign hard to get Democratic voters to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   Two-term Rep. Capps, for one, is challenged by Beth Rogers, a
wealthy businesswoman with strong Republican backing.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Republicans are not holding a campaign kickoff
picnic this fall. Instead, their big fund-raiser will be a Hall of
Fame dinner Sept. 7 honoring retiring Dist. Atty. Michael D.
Bradbury.</TE>
<TE>   Both Democrats and Republicans will begin voter registration
drives in earnest in the next week or two, and campaign offices are
now opening for candidates in both parties.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have increased their countywide registered voter
advantage slightly since the March primary election. There are now
160,567 registered Republicans, up about 2,000 since March, while
there are 150,393 Democrats, up about 800.</TE>

<HD>Dual-Language Classes Train for Diversity</HD>
<DH>Education: A Santa Ana school instructs students in both
English and Spanish to equip them to live in an increasingly mixed
society.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When classes begin today for students at El Sol Science and Arts
Academy in Santa Ana, all 60 kindergartners will plunge into their
lessons--in Spanish.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that the students don't know English. In fact, at least
half of them are fluent.</LD>
<LD>   Rather, teachers at the new charter school use Spanish, school
officials and parents say, because they are training the children to
be members of a increasingly diverse community.</LD>
<TE>   "Things are changing demographically," said Wendy Navarro, who has
two children in El Sol. "Look around. We have to accept that."</TE>
<TE>   As more than half a million students across Orange County return
to school this week and next, parents such as Navarro are likely to
see a student body that is slightly less white, slightly more Latino
and less likely to speak only English.</TE>
<TE>   No ethnic group has made up a majority of the county's student
population in a decade. But in Santa Ana, 92% of the students are
Latino and more than 41,000 of its 62,000 students are still learning
English.</TE>
<TE>   El Sol parents and officials are quick to stress that their school
does not offer a bilingual program--a touchy subject in this city
where some residents want to oust a school trustee for what they call
his illegal support of bilingual education.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, educators call it a dual-language immersion program. El
Sol is the only school in Orange County in which all students learn
in such a setting.</TE>
<TE>   A few others offer similar programs as an option.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to bilingual education, which uses a student's native
language as a bridge to make the transition to English gradual, dual
immersion uses two languages to achieve fluency in both directions.</TE>
<TE>   At El Sol, all students begin kindergarten learning their
curriculum in Spanish. They also devote 10% of their lesson time to
learning English.</TE>
<TE>   The ratio of English to Spanish instruction changes incrementally
each year. By the time students reach fifth grade, they will be
taught 50% in English and 50% in Spanish. The school's highest grade
is second, but ultimately it will be eighth.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to turn out students who feel comfortable with both
languages.</TE>
<TE>   El Sol and other dual-language immersion programs represent
another facet of the debate over bilingual education and how to
improve academic achievement in increasingly diverse communities.</TE>
<TE>   Since state voters four years ago passed Proposition 227, which
banned bilingual education from public schools, some parents in
heavily Latino districts such as Santa Ana's have complained that
their children continue to learn in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   Parents can request bilingual education for their children by
signing a waiver, but other students must be taught fully in English,
according to the law.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, some parents at Santa Ana Unified filed a
recall petition against school board member Nativo Lopez, accusing
him of encouraging principals to push waivers and to keep bilingual
education alive. Lopez has been an outspoken critic of Proposition
227 but denied trying to undermine the law.</TE>
<TE>   The recall petition will be put to voters if Lopez's opponents can
gather enough signatures by Sept. 12.</TE>
<TE>   While bilingual education has received much attention, there has
been little debate about dual-language immersion.</TE>
<TE>   District officials say the programs at Jefferson and Martin Luther
King Jr. elementary schools, also in Santa Ana, have proved
successful. Students in dual immersion outperform those in bilingual
or English-only classes in standardized tests, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   One reason may be that students in such programs tend to be high
achievers, said Howard Bryan, the district's director of English
Language Development and Bilingual Programs. The English speakers in
the program help Spanish speakers acquire English skills faster, he
said. "The students mix and they help each other."</TE>
<TE>   El Sol parents say that is true, but they also praise the school's
emphasis on sciences and arts and parental involvement, which is a
condition of enrolling children in the school.</TE>
<TE>   All parents must put in at least 20 volunteer hours each year,
helping with anything from classroom work to painting fences.</TE>
<TE>   "We get such gratification and the kids just love to have the
attention," said Cynthia Criollos, who has two sons in the school.
"And the parents, no matter where they are from, they have something
to give."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Criollos was putting the finishing touches on the
school's new garden. Some students had gathered at the campus for
orientation and were enthralled by the planters and the gardening
tools.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you say seeds in Spanish?" Criollos asked casually.
"Semillas," responded a group of giggly boys and girls.</TE>
<TE>   The campus, at Broadway and Halesworth Street, is not much to look
at right now.</TE>
<TE>   A refurbished old Victorian home serves as the offices, six
portable classrooms are lined neatly on a back lot, and a
54,000-square-foot building sits vacant with grand possibilities: new
classrooms, a cafeteria and a library.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest challenge for the school is getting funding for
facilities, said Susan Mas, El Sol's co-director and a Laguna Beach
Unified School District trustee.</TE>
<TE>   El Sol receives $5,915 per student from the state, similar to what
the Santa Ana district gets, but no funding to maintain facilities.
As a charter school, El Sol is governed by a parent committee. With
more independence comes less money.</TE>
<TE>   Last week the school got some good news, however. It qualified for
$1 million in interest-free bond proceeds to help build its campus.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to help tremendously in moving forward with
renovation plans," Mas said.</TE>
<TE>   "We can continue expanding our student enrollment by at least
another two grades by September 2003."</TE>
<TE>   El Sol began with 120 students in kindergarten and first grade
last year, and is opening classrooms for the first second-graders
Tuesday. That will increase total enrollment to 180.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the modest beginnings and a still-makeshift campus, there
is a waiting list of 83 students.</TE>
<TE>   The students are mostly from Santa Ana, but also from as far as
Newport Beach and Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Half the students come from Spanish-speaking families, the other
half from English-speaking homes. More than half qualify for
federally subsidized lunches.</TE>
<TE>   Parents praise the diversity.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it so much," said Miako Hurtado, a Japanese immigrant
married to a Mexican American. "It is a very unique school."</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, Hurtado also witnessed something she had never seen
before. Her daughter, Cecilia, 6, who is entering first grade, had
her first conversation with her Spanish-speaking grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   "It was amazing," the 32-year-old Santa Ana homemaker said.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish is also opening doors for Cecilia's friend Monica Mouet,
7. Monica's favorite television program is a Spanish children's
program, said her mother, Jennifer Doh.</TE>
<TE>   Monica is still shy about demonstrating her Spanish to strangers,
but she said there are no communication barriers on the playground or
the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "You can speak any language you want to," she said. "Because it is
a free country."</TE>

<HD>Could a Freeze Gun Put Flames on Ice?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The old ways of fighting fire with fire, water and foam may work, but
some inventors say they have better ideas: a freezing blast capable
of encasing a two-story home in ice, for example, and a blimp that
emulates a rainstorm.</LD>
<LD>   Inventors, emboldened by fires that have consumed 5.7 million
acres nationwide this year, are pitching their ideas to government
agencies and homeowners. But most of the next-generation gadgetry has
not caught on with the federal research center in San Dimas that
assesses new ideas.</LD>
<LD>   Undeterred by official rejection, though, the innovators go on
freezing and flooding stuff to make their case.</LD>
<TE>   Tim Beck's Cryocrete freeze gun--a converted fire
extinguisher--seems like a weapon no super villain should be without.
Through a hose, the device blasts a mixture of rice-sized dry and
regular ice pellets that freezes whatever it hits.</TE>
<TE>   "It can stop a fire cold," said Beck, a Torrance resident, who
once ran a kidney bank that used subzero liquids to preserve organs.</TE>
<TE>   Once frozen to a wall or roof, the sheet of ice draws more
moisture from the air, just as a cold martini glass does. And as it
warms over about two days, Beck said, the ice evaporates, leaving no
water damage and no sticky foam to clean up.</TE>
<TE>   Or at least that is the theory for the device, which has been
tested only on a small, staged fire eight years ago. In 1994, an oil
company gave Beck $500,000 to make prototypes of the freeze gun to
fight fires and a similar one crafted from a leaf blower that was
designed to freeze oil spills in the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   He extinguished a small fire in a steel container during a
demonstration for the Manhattan Beach Fire Department, which passed
on the idea and is sticking with fire and foam.</TE>
<TE>   Beck once envisioned firefighters spraying his Cryocrete to
extinguish raging blazes, but realized that might be a bit too
ambitious for the prototype.</TE>
<TE>   Now he is pitching the ice gun as a fire prevention tool to
homeowners associations in the crackling dry canyons of the Santa
Monica Mountains. With no freeze gun on the market, residents would
pay Beck to ice their homes when a fire breaks out nearby. Or at
least that's his hope.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Forest Service's San Dimas Technology and Development
Center has heard it all before, and says inventors like Beck usually
make the mistake of trying to revolutionize firefighting. The center,
one of two in the country, studies about 100 new ideas each year and
manages a $1.4-million budget to test and develop about 10 of them
annually.</TE>
<TE>   Beck asked the agency in June to consider using his technique to
fight a wildfire. In language better left in an advanced physics lab,
the technology center said the idea would not work on a large scale.</TE>
<TE>   To make the concept work, the government would have to buy tons of
dry ice and retrofit its equipment--rather than simply sucking up
free water from a lake with firefighting helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   This fire season more extravagant ideas than usual have rolled
into the technology center, including various takes on freezing and a
number of blimp designs.</TE>
<TE>   Wetzone Engineering of Irvine is offering its twist on the oldest
firefighting tool: rain. Wetzone has plans for a blimp the length of
three football fields, or 4 1/2 times the length of the Goodyear
blimp.</TE>
<TE>   One of the ships could hover above a fire, the company says,
dropping 20,000 gallons of water without having to refill. By
comparison, the giant Super Scooper planes can dump 1,600 gallons at
a time. The craft would be filled with water from a pump or by fire
planes dumping their loads into a catch basin on top of the blimp.
The blimp would then release a steady rain.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't hurt the environment at all, because it's the way
nature put out fires," said Thomas Gagliano, a spokesman for the
fledgling company.</TE>
<TE>   Hope for a new market in firefighting has brought on a space race
of sorts among airship manufacturers. About half a dozen firms are
trying to market modified blimps that could be used for water drops
or as mobile command posts for fire captains.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Blake, owner of Portland, Ore.-based Advanced Hybrid
Aircraft, said airship builders have confidence that firefighters
will see the value in hovering. For now, though, "The problem we're
all having is funding," Blake said.</TE>
<TE>   Gagliano and Beck acknowledged that their creations would cost
millions if used on a grand scale, but so do current technologies
that they say are less effective.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Bambarger, a Forest Service aviation specialist, said 90% of
the workable ideas for firefighting come, not from private inventors,
but from professionals within the Forest Service or other government
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "They're all good-hearted and really want to help us," Bambarger
said. "God bless them, but they don't really have the knowledge when
it comes to fires."</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service team in San Dimas studied the airship plans and
found that the artificial rain dropped from a blimp might dissipate
before it hit the ground, Bambarger said. And because blimps move so
slowly, 20 blimps would be needed in the Los Angeles region alone to
make sure one was within range of a fire.</TE>
<TE>   At an estimated $60 million a pop, Bambarger said, "It doesn't
make economic sense to have a watering can that does the same thing
as the aircraft we already have."</TE>
<TE>   Other well-intended inventors have submitted what they hoped were
cutting-edge proposals, such as using halon gas instead of flame
retardant foam because the gas leaves no residue. Good idea,
Bambarger said, except that halon has been outlawed because it can be
10 times more damaging to the ozone than chlorofluorocarbons, a
better known ozone destroyer.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to innovative firefighting, said Forest Service
Specialist Ralph Taylor, the ideas more likely to reach production
are subtle.</TE>
<TE>   Fire trucks throughout the West now use 60 to 100 "collapsible
Whiffle balls" in their water tanks to prevent the entire rig from
tipping over on hills. The balls, submitted as a prototype last year,
keep water from sloshing around and cost about $2 each.</TE>
<TE>   Last year also brought the $3.50 hose sock, a mesh filter that
protects small animals and fish eggs from being sucked into a tank
when a truck is refilling from a stream.</TE>
<TE>   But some high-tech gadgets do make the cut now and then.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the Forest Service and Encinitas-based Space Instruments
Inc. began testing an infrared system for determining quickly the
hottest spot of a fire after a lightning strike.</TE>
<TE>   Two such systems are now mounted on fire patrol planes and more
are planned for next year. The National Weather Service could already
pinpoint a lightning strike, but the new equipment gives firefighters
more accurate readings. And it doesn't require a blimp.</TE>

<HD>No Holiday From the Heat</HD>
<DH>Weather: People flock to beaches to escape high
temperatures while a brush fire strands drivers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH and RICH CONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the unofficial end of summer, the season's most uncomfortable
elements combined Monday for a sweltering, smoky, gridlocked close to
the Labor Day weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Most frustrating for vacationers was a pesky brush fire near
Castaic that forced the temporary shutdown of the Golden State
Freeway, California's primary north-south artery. Named the Freeway
fire, the blaze burned about 1,000 acres and backed up traffic as
much as 10 miles for several hours during the day. Fire authorities
said the fire was 90% contained Monday night, with full containment
expected by this morning.</LD>
<LD>   As holiday travelers crept home, the National Weather Service
issued warnings about the excessive heat, which may have caused a
death on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Another brush fire, in the Angeles National Forest near Azusa,
still wasn't contained Monday. Officials said someone apparently set
the blaze, but they were uncertain if it was deliberate.</TE>
<TE>   Thermometers soared over 100 degrees for the second day in many
cities. By midafternoon, it was already 106 degrees in Van Nuys and
104 in Ontario. By contrast, the normally sweltering desert
communities of Palm Springs and Thermal reached 102 and 100,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Also roasting Monday--at least in historical terms--was the Bay
Area, where Oakland reached 90 degrees, breaking a record of 87 for
the date that was set in 1975. Coastal Monterey hit 87, breaking a
record for the date set in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   The inland heat wave, caused by a lingering high-pressure area
over the West Coast, produced a near-record demand for electricity to
run air conditioners, causing isolated power outages.</TE>
<TE>   Cooling should begin today. According to the National Weather
Service, Southern California temperatures will drop several degrees
and even more Wednesday, when clouds and instability could bring
showers and thunderstorms from Santa Barbara to Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The triple-digit temperatures on Labor Day did not shrink crowds
at popular holiday gathering spots, however. Rangers at Frank G.
Bonelli Park in San Dimas had to close the gates shortly before noon
after an estimated 3,000 picnickers, swimmers and boaters filled the
San Gabriel Valley recreation area.</TE>
<TE>   Many people fled to the waterfront, where the largest crowds of
this summer were reported. On the beaches from Marina del Rey to San
Pedro, an estimated 300,000 visitors cooled off in gentle breezes
measuring in the high 70s and low 80s.</TE>
<TE>   "We've stretched lifeguards as far as we can stretch them," said
county lifeguard Capt. Dave Story.</TE>
<TE>   The region's brush fires only worsened the late summer heat. Near
Castaic, Geri Castillo watched her backyard thermometer soar from 110
to 125 degrees as the Freeway fire and its winds advanced toward the
mobile home park where she lives.</TE>
<TE>   "All the kids and their parents were in the pool trying to cool
off," Castillo said. "We've had fires that were close before, but the
heat wasn't as intense as it was this year."</TE>
<TE>   The Freeway fire had not damaged any structures by Monday evening,
and no firefighters were seriously injured. Firefighters expected to
fully contain the blaze by Monday night and have it mostly
extinguished by later today. The cause of the fire was under
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the beginning of really the worst part of our fire
season," said Los Angeles County fire spokesman Roland Sprewell.</TE>
<TE>   The real effect of the Freeway fire was felt along the Golden
State Freeway, where portions from Gorman to Castaic were closed
several times Monday and drivers pulled off to wait for the
interstate to reopen.</TE>
<TE>   In Valencia, just outside the entrance to Six Flags Magic
Mountain, cars had parked in every space at a Chevron service station
and were lined up three-deep for gas. Several drivers were filling
their overheated cars with water and extra coolant. Inside the
convenience store, the line for the cashier snaked through the aisles
as customers took advantage of a 2-for-1 special on bottled water and
asked the clerks for advice on how to get around the miles-long
traffic jam. Both directions of the freeway were open by about 6:30
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a long drive," said Julie Zavala, who woke up at
4 a.m. Monday to travel from her vacation spot in Mexico to her home
in Contra Costa County. Zavala and her family had been diverted
during other trips because of fires. "But this--we'll be home
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Several highways popular on holidays were shut down in the Angeles
National Forest, where several hundred firefighters struggled to box
in the 11,500-acre Curve fire that threatened two sensitive
wilderness areas.</TE>
<TE>   It had forced about 8,000 weekend campers and visitors to evacuate
on Sunday</TE>
<TE>   "You're getting heat from both sources. With the fire heat and the
extremely hot temperatures over 100 degrees, you almost can't absorb
enough liquids to handle it," said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman
Gwen Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Only two structures, including an abandoned ranger station, were
confirmed destroyed in the blaze, but officials were still assessing
potential damage to several remote cabins.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the fire is under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Flames, which roared through brush-covered terrain along
California 39 on Sunday to the Crystal Lake campground, slowed by
Monday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Full containment of the fire was not expected for several days
because of the inaccessibility of many hot spots, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Erratic winds could still whip the fire up and push it into nearby
wildlife preserves, including a big horn sheep habitat to the east.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to California 39, which is closed indefinitely, a
portion of Angeles Crest Highway normally traveled by hundreds of
Labor Day visitors was shut down Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The effort in the San Gabriel Canyon was being aided by
reinforcements shifted from another forest fire near Wrightwood,
which was more than 60% contained.</TE>
<TE>   No structures were threatened and only minor injuries to several
firefighters were reported.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, a hiker from Orange County died on a trail in the
Cleveland National Forest, where the temperature was 109.</TE>
<TE>   The body of Michael Curtin, 38, of Lake Forest was discovered by a
mountain biker on a trail in Modjeska Canyon. The biker, a physician,
could not revive Curtin.</TE>

<LD>The Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon for the Muscular Dystrophy Assn.
received a record $58.3 million in nationwide pledges through Monday,
a telethon spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Originating in Los Angeles, the telethon broke last year's record
of $56.8 million, said spokesman Bob Mackle. The 37th annual
broadcast was shown on about 200 stations.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis praised the "generosity and compassion" of contributors.
"That's America's real gift to people with neuromuscular
diseases--the knowledge that they're not alone in the fight, that
their friends and neighbors are behind us in the drive to beat these
devastating diseases."</LD>

<HD>A Dapper Strategist Battles Secession</HD>
<DH>Politics: Kam Kuwata isn't coasting, though opponents of a
breakup are better funded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What happened to the 6-year-old boy who, when handed a "Democrats for
Nixon" sticker back in 1960, promptly scratched off a few letters so
that it read "rats for Nixon"?</LD>
<LD>   He grew up to be one of California's most respected Democratic
strategists.</LD>
<LD>   Now, after years of directing winning campaigns for Sen. Dianne
Feinstein and Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, Kam Kuwata has signed
on to try to help Hahn defeat secession bids in Hollywood and the San
Fernando Valley.</LD>
<TE>   Kuwata lugs around a bulging canvas tote bag. He speaks softly and
often wears a bow tie. But under the dapper exterior is a man of
intense discipline and drive. Even though his side has raised about
$3 million, far more than the secessionists, and even though most
polls show Los Angeles voters leaning against breaking up the city,
Kuwata isn't coasting.</TE>
<TE>   "The dumbest thing in the world is to take one's opponents for
granted," he said, downing a cup of coffee at a Starbucks in Sherman
Oaks. "Whenever you put a microphone in front of [secession leader]
Richard Katz, he says they have 3,000 block captains around the city.
You have to take them seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Kuwata knows how to bruise an opponent. Last year, his team aired
a television ad depicting a crack pipe to suggest that Hahn's
opponent, Antonio Villaraigosa, was soft on drugs. Villaraigosa
accused Hahn of trying "to create a climate of fear"--the same kind
of criticism secessionists have leveled at the mayor during the
current debate.</TE>
<TE>   On any given day, Kuwata can be spotted shuffling through the
corridors of City Hall or hovering at the fringes of some
anti-secession event. Until recently, he waged the L.A. United
campaign from a cell phone. (Now he keeps a bare-bones office on
Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks.)</TE>
<TE>   Ear to the Ground</TE>
<TE>   On weekends, Kuwata said, he sometimes plunks himself down at a
coffee shop in the Valley, slyly positioning his newspaper to display
a secession-related story. Then he'll strike up casual conversations
to see what people think of the breakaway bid.</TE>
<TE>   "Kam holds his cards very close. He's always listening, absorbing
information to use to his advantage," said John Shallman, a fellow
Democratic consultant. "His clients get a lot of comfort from him.
He's not prone to wild mood swings. He's steady."</TE>
<TE>   By 6:30 or so each morning, Kuwata is usually on the
treadmill--and on the phone to Bill Carrick, another A-list
Democratic operative leading the anti-secession campaign. The two
have worked in tandem since Feinstein's 1992 Senate race.</TE>
<TE>   Carrick is the television ad expert, specializing in messages
designed to resonate with voters. Kuwata is the guy on the ground,
overseeing the day-to-day operations and picking up feedback about
whether the messages are sticking.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, campaigning against the cityhood measures on the
Nov. 5 ballot is like campaigning for an incumbent: You defend the
status quo and point out the risks of changing course.</TE>
<TE>   But the ground rules of this election, set by state law, have
complicated the usual strategies. To win, secession must attract a
majority of voters, not just within the areas seeking independence,
but citywide.</TE>
<TE>   That means Kuwata must fight his battle on three
fronts--Hollywood, the Valley and the rest of the city.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign is also muddled by the number of groups pushing for
or against secession. Kuwata spends much of his time trying to
coordinate various players--from council members and unions to
citizens groups and business moguls--who oppose a municipal breakup.</TE>
<TE>   "Kam is a very skilled adversary," said veteran GOP consultant Ken
Khachigian.</TE>
<TE>   "I have enormous respect for him. If I were pro-secession, I'd be
worried."</TE>
<TE>   Raised in Sierra Madre by a strong-willed single mother, Kuwata
always gravitated toward politics, especially civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   His mother's family was forced to live in a Japanese American
internment camp during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   A Call to Politics</TE>
<TE>   As a student at Pasadena High School, Kuwata worked to help
desegregate the school system. He went on to USC, where he spent his
free time volunteering for Democratic campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Kuwata's mother wanted him to go to law school, but instead he
went to Washington in the mid-1970s, joining Sen. Alan Cranston's
staff as a mail clerk.</TE>
<TE>   Kuwata became Cranston's press spokesman and, in 1986, helped the
liberal senator pull off a tough reelection campaign. He went on to
manage Feinstein's three Senate campaigns and has also worked on
Senate and gubernatorial races in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Kuwata is almost always on the winning team. One notable exception
was in 1998, when he ran Jane Harman's campaign for governor.
Harman's early lead shriveled after she was hit with a $5-million ad
blitz by rival Al Checchi.</TE>
<TE>   In last year's mayoral contest, Kuwata turned down an offer to
work for Villaraigosa and instead joined Hahn's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Darry Sragow, who managed the Cranston campaign, called Kuwata
"one of the great operatives in the state."</TE>
<TE>   Sragow said Kuwata is also a likable guy who knows how to have a
good time. "He's just one of those guys people love to kick back with
and toss down some bourbon and light up a cigar and wax
philosophical."</TE>
<TE>   These days, however, Kuwata is more likely to be found hanging
around a golf course than a bar. He quit drinking and went on a
health kick two years ago, dropping almost 60 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent day, he asked a reporter to meet him at a Whole Foods
Market instead of his office. Biting into an apple, he recounted how
his new diet and exercise plan helps him sleep better.</TE>
<TE>   The never-married Kuwata lives in one of Venice's wackiest
buildings: the one with the giant clown (or is it a ballerina?)
looming over Main Street. He can't remember if he's 47 or 48 (he's
48) because he doesn't celebrate birthdays. "I don't like the
spotlight," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he's always good for a zinger on the campaign trail. He once
compared Gray Davis, then battling Feinstein for the Senate seat she
later won, with a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, he derided the state agency that placed secession
on the ballot--and that Kuwata regarded as biased in favor of a
breakup--as "the French judge in the Winter Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   As the cityhood debate intensifies in the fall, Kuwata is
determined to win voters in even fervently pro-secession quarters of
Los Angeles, like the West Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to win everything. I want to win in the Valley, I want to
win in Hollywood," he said. "If you believe some of the naysayers, we
should write off the West Valley. But we're going after everybody.
We're not going to write off anybody."</TE>

<HD>County to Extend Needle Exchange Program to Santa Paula</HD>
<DH>Health: The project started last year in Ventura is an
effort to stem the spread of blood-borne diseases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Health-care volunteers soon will begin exchanging new needles for
used ones brought in by drug users in Santa Paula, as the Ventura
County Health Care Agency expands its year-old syringe replacement
program.</LD>
<LD>   The move into Santa Paula is part of an effort to take the program
countywide, where an estimated 905 to 1,460 residents are thought to
be infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, officials said. The
program's expansion was unanimously approved last month by the county
Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   Although Santa Paula Police Chief Bob Gonzales said he is
philosophically opposed to handing out needles to drug users, he told
county health officials that he would support their effort.</LD>
<TE>   "Being a law-and-order person, I don't support that we're going to
give people needles to further their addiction," Gonzales said last
week. "My job is to see that we eliminate the substance abuse
altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "But I have to be realistic. The fallout effect is that you pass
on diseases with dirty needles, and those diseases can be spread to
loved ones, family members and maybe even some of my police officers
who have to deal with these people."</TE>
<TE>   The county started its needle exchange program last year in
Ventura, where 5,355 syringes were turned in from September 2001 to
May 2002, health officials said. A total of 4,735 needles were given
out, "resulting in a net 620 fewer needles that can be found in
parking lots, parks or other places that could be hazardous to the
public," Dr. Robert Levin, the county's medical health director,
wrote in a report to the board.</TE>
<TE>   The needle exchange site in downtown Ventura is open for two hours
a week and is staffed by volunteers, many of them former addicts,
from the Ventura County Rainbow Alliance. Needle exchange volunteers
saw 381 clients in eight months, 16% of them homeless, Levin
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Levin and other health officials said the number of Ventura County
residents infected with blood-borne diseases is rising. Last year, 39
cases of AIDS were reported, as were 135 cases of hepatitis B and 625
of hepatitis C. By May of this year, there were 10 additional cases
of AIDS, 100 more of hepatitis B and 278 more of hepatitis C.</TE>
<TE>   About 16% of Ventura County men with AIDS reported using drugs
intravenously, while 27% of women infected with the virus said they
used intravenous drugs, such as heroin and crack cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Levin reported, a survey conducted two years ago of
homeless people in Ventura County found that 27% tested positive for
hepatitis C.</TE>
<TE>   "Hepatitis B, C and HIV are blood-borne diseases that continue to
be transmitted in the county and take a large toll on the health of
individuals and the community, and contribute to the increasing cost
of medical care," Levin wrote in persuading supervisors to expand the
needle exchange program.</TE>

<HD>Four New Campuses Opening in O.C.</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dust-covered desks and burgundy carpet remnants line the halls of Oak
Creek Elementary, where the smell of fresh paint hangs heavy.</LD>
<LD>   School starts Thursday, and Principal Tammera Parham said watching
workers put the final touches on the new Irvine school is like
"witnessing a miracle in progress."</LD>
<LD>   In Laguna Niguel, crews scramble to finish another campus, for 400
elementary students, and in Garden Grove residents gawk as workers
paint and plant grass at an old neighborhood school set to reopen
after being closed for 23 years.</LD>
<TE>   In San Juan Capistrano, nervous teens audition to enroll at a new
private arts conservatory as pianos are wheeled into classrooms and
dance floors are installed.</TE>
<TE>   Shifting population growth and a 1998 state proposition that
authorized $9.2 billion in school construction bonds continue to
translate to new public schools, and the growing demand for
alternatives to the public system is driving an increase in private
institutions. The four new campuses will be added to more than 800
other public and private schools in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   When classes start at Oak Creek, more than 500 students will swarm
the campus.</TE>
<TE>   Bustling around in black overalls and a striped T-shirt a week
before classes begin, Parham talks over the drone of drills and
trucks as she greets kindergartners and their parents registering for
school. Her office is a bit dim because not all the lights are
installed.</TE>
<TE>   "Our commitment has been to get the classrooms ready," she said.
"Everything else may not be perfect, but when the teachers can bring
those kids into finished classrooms on Thursday, that will be
perfection."</TE>
<TE>   The district selected the site, near the western end of the Oak
Creek development, in its effort to locate schools so that elementary
students will travel less than a mile and a half, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not so much easing the burden on the other schools, but
serving kids in the smallest radius we can," said Dean Waldfogel,
superintendent of the Irvine Unified School District. "We're trying
to minimize cross-town transportation and busing."</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel Elementary, which also will open Thursday with about
400 students, was built to relieve crowding at other area schools.
Attendance boundaries will be ignored the first year so students from
throughout Capistrano Unified School District can enroll.</TE>
<TE>   The district is waiting to redraw boundaries so they won't have to
be altered again next year when five more schools are scheduled to
open, district spokesman David Smollar said.</TE>
<TE>   Although tractors and trucks sit next to the school on an empty
acre of dirt--a future playing field--the classrooms are ready for
students, and teachers have already started to unpack their boxes.</TE>
<TE>   "What you see lying around will be gone in a matter of hours,"
said Associate Supt. Dan Crawford, stepping over a pile of purple and
white irrigation pipes. "We're way ahead of where we need to be to be
ready for classes to start."</TE>
<TE>   At the California Conservatory of the Arts in San Juan Capistrano,
auditions will be held until all 125 positions are filled for its
programs in dance, visual arts and musical theater. Students from
sixth grade through high school will attend academic classes
elsewhere and, after school, come to the conservatory for instruction
every day for up to three hours.</TE>
<TE>   Establishing the school as an after-school program allows students
from private schools and non-arts charter schools to develop their
talents, said David Greene, who founded and directs the school with
Nancy Melbourne, fellow Orange County School of the Arts founding
director.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, eight students, sitting in a semicircle of folding
chairs in a room where the carpet is still covered with plastic, were
accepted into the musical theater program after singing and
performing monologues.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine sixth-grader Kylie Guiral buried her face in her hands when
Green announced she had been selected.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm good at acting but bad at singing. Hopefully this program
will make me better," said Kylie, an 11-year-old version of actress
Sarah Jessica Parker who sang a song from "Annie" and recited a scene
from "The Diary of Anne Frank."</TE>
<TE>   In north Orange County, crews are renovating Garden Park
Elementary School in Garden Grove, set to reopen as a district school
after closing in 1979. The school was one of the first victims of
declining enrollment in the 1970s, and over the years has been leased
by community organizations and private schools.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, the district started reopening most of the 10 schools
that were closed as a growth boom swept west from the district's
campuses in Santa Ana. Garden Park is in the western part of Garden
Grove, the last area to regain the population to justify reopening a
school, said district spokesman Alan Trudell.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly $500,000 in renovations are to be finished by the time the
250-student school opens Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   New PTA President Michele Heim and her twin daughters, who will be
in second grade, walk past the school nearly every day and have seen
the old campus transformed into a new school, she said. Her daughters
are excited about helping to decide some of its essential components:
school mascot and colors.</TE>
<TE>   Kayla and Casey Heim are voting for pink and purple, and according
to the PTA grapevine, the top mascot contenders are eagles, panthers,
gators and geckos.</TE>
<TE>   "They get to decide who they're going to be--that was a big
selling point for them," said Heim, 35. "And for those of us on the
PTA, we can invent the school's reputation and make a difference from
the ground up."</TE>

Strike</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Welcome back. Good weekend? Hot enough for you?</LD>
<LD>   Nice being at work again, in a way--at least someone else is
paying for the AC.</LD>
<LD>   And the place is clean, carpets all vacuumed.</LD>
<TE>   The elves didn't do that. While you were maybe barbecuing or
napping or watching the game, someone was in your office, at night,
or over the holiday weekend, to make it so.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome back to work. Enjoy the fruits of the labors of Labor Day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. janitors' strike in the spring of 2000 altered the labor
landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the 1997 Teamsters strike against UPS succeeded in part
because everyone knew those nice young (mostly) men in brown shorts
and UPS was a faceless corporate entity, the first victory of the
janitors' strike was the public imagination. It was cinematic, easy
to cover, easy to cast--poor immigrants versus rich office people.
Janitors marched past skyscrapers downtown and along flower-scented
roads in Bel-Air, calling solidarity slogans to maids and gardeners.</TE>
<TE>   From Chicago to San Diego, the L.A. janitors' strike nudged
management elsewhere toward signing contracts. It inspired other
unions. It created strike-chic: knockoffs of the red "Justice for
Janitors" T-shirts were sold in the garment district like fake Fendi
handbags. A British director made "Bread and Roses," a film about the
strike.</TE>
<TE>   And now there's a children's book about the strike, "Si Se Puede,"
colloquially, "Yes, We Can," a rallying cry since the early days of
Cesar Chavez's farm workers.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, actor Edward James Olmos fought a cold and the traffic
from the Valley to the West Adams district to read aloud from the
vividly illustrated book to a group of children, many of whose
parents are janitors. It tells the story of Carlitos, whose widowed
mother is a janitor who helps lead a strike for higher wages. To help
her, Carlitos paints his own sign, "I love my mama! She is a
janitor!" and marches with her.</TE>
<TE>   They all sat under a marquee outside St. Joseph's, the
grandificent church--one adjective isn't enough to describe it, you
have to conflate two of them--that stands across from the secularly
charming Automobile Club building, so I've always thought of St.
Joseph's as Our Lady of Roadside Assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, resplendent in creamy vestments trimmed
with bright fabrics of Mexican weaving, swept by the group on his way
to say Labor Day weekend Mass, the day before he would open his new
downtown cathedral. He waved at Olmos, who waved back. (In Mahony's
days as a bishop in the Central Valley, some growers nicknamed him
"Red Roger" for his early and vigorous support of the farm workers
union. In L.A., he backed the janitors' strike with equal fervor--but
lost ground with labor for resisting the archdiocese's cemetery
workers in their fight to unionize.)</TE>
<TE>   As Olmos read, the book's author stood nearby, beaming. Diana Cohn
just moved to the Bay Area from New York and she doesn't speak
Spanish, but when she read about the strike, she figured this story,
she had to tell. Unions, she believes, "are the only anti-poverty
program that works."</TE>
<TE>   She's written other children's books but this is the first to be
political, so political that her mainstream publisher asked her to
"restructure" it--dilute the politics. Cohn went instead to Cinco
Puntos Press in El Paso, which wanted it at once, printed copies in
English and Spanish--including a paperback version to give to the
janitors union--and is giving some of the proceeds to a New York
workers' fund.</TE>
<TE>   The strike was "a really great story where all the threads came
together," Cohn says, "both social justice issues and really
important values." She shared her manuscript with a focus group of
janitor-parents and kids, whose suggestions--put in some Central
Americans, not just Mexicans, and add some adult men to the
story--Cohn took.</TE>
<TE>   One of them was Dolores Sanchez, who led her colleagues in the
strike. "I'm glad they wrote something," she said in Spanish on
Sunday, "so our children could understand what we do and why." The
book even helps explain her family: her children are 19, 15--and 11
months old, the youngest conceived before she got the benefits of the
new labor contract--among them, she says, health care insurance and
family planning.</TE>
<TE>   There's a small bit about health care in the book: with a new
contract and better wage, Carlitos' mother doesn't have to clean
other people's houses on weekends. They can go to the park and buy
ice cream and even afford medicine, so Carlitos' grandmother's "sore
bones feel so much better."</TE>

<HD>Strange Case of a Legal Oddity: She Puts Pen to Paper</HD>
<DH>Labor: South L.A. court reporter is the only one in
California to shun a steno machine in favor of shorthand on a
notepad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Court reporter Marian DuVal likes to do things the old-fashioned way.</LD>
<LD>   To start off, she's the only full-time stenographer in the state
of California who still uses the ancient tools of her trade: pen and
paper.</LD>
<LD>   Her colleagues work with state-of-the-art machines and software
that can instantly translate shorthand and beam it up to a judge's
computer screen. DuVal swears by her black ballpoint pen and
6-by-9-inch notepad.</LD>
<TE>   Sitting down recently in her tiny office in Kenyon Juvenile
Justice Center in South Los Angeles, DuVal ticked off a list of other
things that she prefers to do the way her ancestors might have.</TE>
<TE>   She said she grinds fresh chilies to make bean chili stew. And
when she bakes a coconut cake, she takes a whole coconut and shreds
its flesh.</TE>
<TE>   She keeps in touch--handwritten letters, of course--with friends
from her high school days in Chicago in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   She even walks two miles to work every morning, after taking the
train in from the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "By today's standards, I guess I'm old-fashioned," DuVal said.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Dube , a deputy public defender, said he thought he had
entered a time warp when he first walked into DuVal's courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   He was struck by the simple wooden chairs lined up to form the
public seating area and the scarcity of electronic equipment. There
was no microphone system, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   "This courtroom looked like it was designed to be reminiscent of
the Clarence Darrow era," Dube said. "I noticed that, in the middle
of all this, there's just a woman sitting there, scribbling away."</TE>
<TE>   Dube said he walked up to DuVal during a recess and asked what she
was doing.</TE>
<TE>   " 'In case you didn't know,' " Dube said she told him, " 'this is
the way we used to do it before we had machines.' "</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, colleagues and lawyers have quizzed her about why
she doesn't switch to the machine.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried it and I was just kind of bored with it," DuVal said of
the stenograph.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just stubborn," she said. "Writing's something I thought I
was good at, and I wanted to continue."</TE>
<TE>   She fell in love with the craft when she took a class in high
school that taught Gregg shorthand, which uses lines, curves and dots
to represent the letters of the alphabet.</TE>
<TE>   The movement of DuVal's right hand is barely visible as she
records a court proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   She writes in narrow columns, a different one for each speaker,
and holds her pen loosely so that her hand doesn't cramp.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody should be able to snatch the pen out of your hand," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, only 1% of all court reporters in the United States are
"pen writers" like DuVal, according to the National Court Reporters
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   DuVal has worked for Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charles
Scarlett for the last 14 years, and plans to continue until she
retires. "It's like family, working with this judge and the clerk,"
DuVal said.</TE>
<TE>   Scarlett said that what impresses him most about DuVal is how she
can handle caseloads that other court reporters would complain about.</TE>
<TE>   When DuVal was on vacation recently, the judge said the reporters
who filled in suggested that he allow a shift change between the
morning and afternoon calendars.</TE>
<TE>   "You've never heard such complaining," said Scarlett, who presides
over hearings in 40 to 50 cases a day.</TE>
<TE>   Substitute reporters also have begged Scarlett, who speaks quickly
and with a Southern drawl, to slow down while speaking from the
bench, the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   "Marian has never told me that I was talking too fast," Scarlett
said. "She is unflappable. She is accurate. She does not get upset
and she does not complain."</TE>

<HD>Bill Could Limit Pesticide Use Near Schools</HD>
<DH>Safety: Legislation would give the county more power to
regulate application at farms within a quarter-mile of campuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After nearly two years of wrangling, a bill aimed at giving
agricultural officials more power to regulate pesticide applications
near schools has made it to the governor's desk.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation, written by Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson
(D-Santa Barbara), would allow county agricultural commissioners to
place restrictions on the use of all pesticides applied on farms
within a quarter-mile of schools.</LD>
<LD>   Currently, only certain pesticides are subject to such
restrictions.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a long process, but I'm very pleased," said Jackson, who
believes the bill stands a good chance of earning the governor's
signature.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, our farmers don't want to injure our school kids," she
said. "Yet we have had policies in place that, when you get a few bad
actors, have had a serious and detrimental impact on our kids."</TE>
<TE>   The bill, which passed the Assembly last week and the Senate the
week before, was inspired by an incident two years ago in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors sued citrus rancher Dan Campbell and his foreman, Raul
Adame, for allegedly allowing the pesticide Lorsban to drift onto
Mound Elementary School, which is across the street from Campbell's
200-acre lemon orchard.</TE>
<TE>   Two students at the east Ventura elementary school were sent home,
and dozens of others complained of dizziness and nausea after the
incident.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell settled the case in April by agreeing not to spray near
the school while classes are in session and paying $25,000 in
penalties and restitution. The rancher also agreed to notify school
officials at least 72 hours before any scheduled pesticide
application on days that classes are in session.</TE>
<TE>   However, agricultural officials still faced a dilemma: The
pesticide in this case was an unrestricted chemical, meaning other
growers would be able to apply it without notifying school or farm
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's bill seeks to eliminate that problem by allowing
agricultural commissioners, when they deem it necessary, to place
conditions on the use of "nonrestricted" chemicals within a
quarter-mile of schools.</TE>
<TE>   David Buettner, a deputy agricultural commissioner in Ventura
County, said his office considers 29 schools to be adjacent to
agriculture. Of those, he said fewer than 10 have been the subject of
problems or complaints related to pesticide use.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation "may increase our workload to some degree,
although we've been dealing with these issues for quite some time,"
Buettner said. "The main thing it allows us to do is be proactive
rather than reactive."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura resident Mary Haffner is not comforted.</TE>
<TE>   She and other members of Community &amp; Children's Advocates Against
Pesticide Poisoning have butted heads with the county agricultural
commissioner in the past over what the group considers lax pesticide
use enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Haffner had two children at Mound School during the Lorsban
incident. She has since transferred them to another school.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad there is some legislation addressing the issue, but I
don't think it goes far enough," she said. "It relies very heavily on
the agricultural commissioner to be proactive. However, in the past
we have had some problems with the agricultural commissioner being
proactive."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's legislation was supported by a broad coalition of
groups, including the Ventura County Farm Bureau and the
Environmental Defense Center.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Cardenas, director of an Environmental Defense Center project
that seeks to reduce health risks associated with agricultural
pesticides, said he expects agricultural commissioners in the county
and the rest of the state to make good use of the expanded powers
they are likely to be given.</TE>
<TE>   And he expects environmental groups and community activists such
as Haffner to hold them accountable if they don't.</TE>
<TE>   "This bill accomplishes what we set out to accomplish, which is
protecting children," Cardenas said.</TE>
<TE>   If signed by the governor, the law would increase the maximum fine
for serious pesticide-related violations from $1,000 to $5,000. It
also includes language encouraging school districts to address in
their safety plans steps to take in the event of pesticide drift.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said in order to hold on to the broad base of support she
had built for the legislation, she was forced to narrow the scope of
her original legislation. It initially called for an increase in
regulatory oversight of pesticide application within a quarter-mile
of all sensitive sites, such as day-care centers, nursing homes and
hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   But she said she believes the legislation is a solid first step
toward preventing future pesticide-related problems.</TE>
<TE>   "As children return to school, the passage of this bill provides
hope that schools will soon be free of the threat of pesticide
drift," Jackson said.</TE>

<HD>Voters Cool as Candidates Warm to Task</HD>
<DH>Politics: Both Simon and Davis appeal for support and pick
up Labor Day themes on the traditional kickoff day for fall
campaigns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a day steeped in political tradition, Democrat Gray Davis and
Republican Bill Simon Jr. on Monday reached back to their party
roots, rallying loyalists and striving to muster some rare voter
enthusiasm in their contest for governor.</LD>
<LD>   For Davis, that meant appearances at a series of union-sponsored
rallies up and down the state, where he assailed Simon, selectively
touted his record on behalf of working men and women--and braved
hecklers urging him to sign a disputed farm labor bill.</LD>
<LD>   For Simon, the day brought a journey to the Richard Nixon Library
&amp; Birthplace in conservative Orange County and a trip to the State
Fair in Sacramento, where he attacked Davis, showed off his
family--and fended off questions about his ethics.</LD>
<TE>   Yet despite the stakes in November and a series of major
events--from Sept. 11 to the stock market swoon and scandals in
corporate America and the Catholic church--Californians seemed
decidedly uninspired as the calendar reached Labor Day, the customary
kickoff for the fall campaign.</TE>
<TE>   A survey released last week found that fewer than half of likely
voters were happy with the choice between Davis and Simon. That
sentiment was repeatedly seconded Monday, even as the candidates
pressed for advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Rosario Valdez, a banquet waitress who showed up at the governor's
breakfast stop at MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, referred to Davis as
"the lesser of two evils." Deborah Spencer, her companion and a
fellow union member, chimed in, "He doesn't seem to be for the
working class. It's mostly the businessman, the ones who have the
money."</TE>
<TE>   Over at the Nixon library in Yorba Linda, 34-year-old Derrick
Washington said he planned to bypass the governor's race when he
votes Nov. 5. "I really don't think we have a good candidate to vote
for," said Washington, who was visiting the library with a friend
before Simon arrived. "Bill Simon just had that [legal] judgment
against his family's firm.... Davis has just been raising money."</TE>
<TE>   With that disgruntlement as a backdrop, the candidates were
embarking on a nine-week home stretch of campaigning that will
culminate Nov. 5, when voters also sort out a host of other
contentious questions.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, voters will adjudicate the biggest municipal
divorce case ever, as secessionists in Hollywood and the San Fernando
Valley attempt to break away and establish separate cities. The vote
will be the culmination of nearly 30 years of activism by Valley
residents, many of whom feel disconnected from the political power
structure at downtown City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood measure is a relative newcomer, piggybacking on the
Valley's efforts mostly because of the money and energy of a wealthy
nightclub owner, Gene La Pietra, who is also running for the City
Council of a breakaway Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   On the state level, a certain amount of turnover in Sacramento is
guaranteed as a result of term limits, with 20 state Senate seats and
80 Assembly races on the ballot. (However, a party-protection plan
adopted by lawmakers when they redrew the state political boundaries
last year all but ensures little change in the partisan lineup.)</TE>
<TE>   Voters will also elect 53 House members--again, with little true
competition--and fill seven statewide offices in addition to
governor: lieutenant governor, attorney general, treasurer,
controller, secretary of state, insurance commissioner and
superintendent of public instruction. The last four are open seats,
because of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Californians will consider six statewide ballot
initiatives, including $15 billion in bond measures and others that
would allow election-day voter registration and expand the
availability of tutoring and after-school programs.</TE>
<TE>   Labor Frames Attacks</TE>
<TE>   But the marquee race is the contest for governor, and the two
leading contenders seized on Monday's campaign marker--and the
attendant media attention--to outline themes and reiterate the
attacks they have been sounding for the past six months.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech booming over loudspeakers at sweltering MacArthur Park
near downtown Los Angeles, Davis portrayed Simon as an enemy of
working people and paid tribute to those who "sew our clothes," "toil
in the fields" and "build our buildings."</TE>
<TE>   "For the last 16 years, working Californians have not had a friend
in the governor's office," said Davis, referring to the two
Republican administrations that preceded his election in 1998. "But
now they do have a friend in the governor's office, and now they have
a seat at the table. California is finally working for working
Californians again."</TE>
<TE>   Davis extolled his record on labor issues, taking credit for a
boost in the state minimum wage, restoration of mandatory overtime at
the end of an eight-hour workday and an increase in the state
benefits paid to workers injured on the job.</TE>
<TE>   "But, amigos, my opponent, Mr. Simon, wants to undo four years of
progress," the governor went on. "I restored the eight-hour day. He
wants to roll it back.... Let's send a memo to Mr. Simon: Mr. Simon,
you're going not going to roll back anything."</TE>
<TE>   Then, referring to his opponent's East Coast roots, Davis added,
"We're going to roll you back all the way to New Jersey!"</TE>
<TE>   Notably, Davis failed to mention one of the most vexing labor
issues now facing him, a Senate bill that would allow government
mediators to intervene in contract disputes between growers and the
United Farm Workers union. The bill is strongly supported by the UFW,
an important Democratic ally, and just as vehemently opposed by
growers. Davis, who has carefully cultivated a business-friendly
image, is striving to keep both sides happy.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the governor's reticence, the issue was clearly on the
minds of many who showed up at the labor rallies he attended in Los
Angeles, Pleasanton and San Diego. At MacArthur Park, many in the
crowd of about 800 wore stickers urging Davis to sign the bill. And
in Pleasanton, at the Alameda County labor picnic, the governor was
interrupted by hecklers chanting, "Sign the bill! Sign the bill!"
After ignoring them, Davis finally said, "Thank you. We hear you. We
hear you."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, as he stumped in Orange County and Sacramento, managed to
avoid any contrarians in the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   But the modest audience that greeted him at the Nixon
library--roughly a few dozen supporters mingling with library
visitors--pointed up the problems he faces in his struggling
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Since winning the Republican primary in a March upset, Simon has
stumbled through a series of pratfalls, his campaign riven by
dissension and growing increasingly desperate for dollars. His ties
to a controversial tax shelter and a $78-million judgment against his
family investment firm in a fraud case have been trumpeted in nonstop
advertising from Davis, whose massive campaign budget has allowed him
to command the TV airwaves virtually unchallenged. But Simon insisted
Monday that the campaign had only just begun, and he tore into the
incumbent with relish.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to talk the truth about Gray Davis' record and we're
going to talk the truth about Bill Simon's vision for California,"
the candidate said. "We are going to talk about how Gov. Davis has
failed as a governor.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question that Davis has been a pay-for-play
governor," Simon continued. "He's got scores of bills on his desk at
the same time he's taking money from people.... I pledge to you today
that I will do no fund-raising during bill-signing sessions."</TE>
<TE>   Addressing labor issues, Simon said he favors "streamlining"
workers' compensation and reverting to a flexible 40-hour workweek,
instead of the current law, which mandates that employers pay
overtime after eight hours in one day.</TE>
<TE>   "Earning overtime each and every day is not something that is good
for business or good for our people," Simon said. "It strangles small
businesses."</TE>
<TE>   But the GOP hopeful was also forced by reporters' questions to
defend his own ethics, as well as a decision to spend Labor Day at an
institution dedicated to a president forced to resign in disgrace.
"Richard Nixon was a fine public servant, and he had a track record
of serving the people," the candidate said.</TE>
<TE>   As for his own conduct, the businessman and neophyte candidate
said: "I have a high standard for ethics, all across the board.
That's been my track record. I've spent thousands of hours helping
others."</TE>
<TE>   Family Support</TE>
<TE>   While Davis traveled the state with other statewide candidates on
the Democratic ticket, Simon campaigned alongside his wife, Cindy;
daughter Lulu, 12; and sons William, 14, and Griffith, 9.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that it's all in God's hands and my dad will win the
election because I truly believe he can improve California," Lulu
told a bank of TV cameras, as several dozen supporters cheered.
William cut in, offering a dissenting opinion: "I hope that my dad
doesn't win the election in November because I don't want to move to
Sacramento."</TE>
<TE>   At that, the crowd burst into laughter and his siblings covered
their faces in horror.</TE>
<TE>   For all his difficulties, Simon advisors continually point to
Davis' sustained unpopularity and their candidate's remarkable change
of fortunes in March, when he came from far behind to beat former Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the Bill Simon story is told in the next two months, you
will see the same type of dramatic rise that we saw in the primary,"
Sal Russo, the campaign's chief strategist, said in an upbeat e-mail
to supporters last week. The Davis campaign, in turn, hopes to
burnish the governor's image by taking a more positive tone in its
advertising over the final few weeks. While the attacks on Simon will
continue, "We need to fill in the blanks on why they should vote for
our guy," said Paul Maslin, the governor's political pollster.</TE>
<TE>   Even with voters' evident distaste for the two major party
candidates, past elections have shown that California governors don't
necessarily have to be liked--or even well-regarded--to win
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, a Los Angeles Times poll gave Republican Gov. Pete Wilson
a 9-point lead around Labor Day, en route to a reelection romp over
Democrat Kathleen Brown. At the same time, precisely half of likely
voters said they disapproved of the job Wilson was doing as governor.</TE>
<TE>   Elections are about comparisons, "not just a referendum on a
particular guy in office," said Bruce Cain, a UC Berkeley political
expert.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen over and over again in California that, in the end,
Californians bite the bullet and vote for the best of the worst--or
at least the best of the choices they're given."</TE>

<HD>City Fights to Retain Subsidized Housing</HD>
<DH>Aid: Court orders are sought to stop apartment owners from
leaving a HUD program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In those contemplative moments when Susanne Chilton considers the
inevitability of change, she imagines it arriving with a gentle
touch.</LD>
<LD>   One by one her aging neighbors would leave their apartments
overlooking the ocean through a process she has come to define as
"attrition."</LD>
<LD>   "Rather than just throw us all out en masse ... we could just
gradually kick the bucket," said the 73-year-old resident of Venice.
"That's what we were hoping--that we could just live out our lives
here."</LD>
<TE>   For months now, that gentle touch she had hoped for has felt more
like a swift kick. The Venice building is one of several in the city
that owners are trying to remove from a federally subsidized program
for low-income tenants. Such a change could mean higher rents and the
possibility that some tenants would lose their homes.</TE>
<TE>   But in a rare move, the Los Angeles city attorney, encouraged by
Mayor James K. Hahn and several tenant advocates, sought court orders
preventing the owners from removing their property from the federal
program.</TE>
<TE>   City officials and housing advocates argue that the owners did not
notify public entities and tenants of their intent to leave the
program, as state law requires.</TE>
<TE>   "We will fight to protect the rights of seniors and families,"
Hahn said in a statement. "Many of these people live on a fixed
income and are legally entitled to time to make alternative plans or
get help finding other affordable housing."</TE>
<TE>   The filings are the latest salvo in a long-running attempt to
preserve affordable housing for low-income residents. The outcome of
this case, housing advocates say, is significant even beyond the 237
units that may be removed from the program.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001 and 2002 alone, housing officials said, some 325 units
have been pulled from the program commonly known as Section 8.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates fear the problem will worsen as more contracts between
the government and property owners, entered into in the late 1970s
and early '80s, expire and more owners exit the program seeking
higher rents on the open market.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Policy Shift</TE>
<TE>   The problem is compounded, advocates say, by a shift in federal
policy that favors giving tenants vouchers rather than reserving
buildings for low-income tenants. In theory, the policy gives tenants
more control, because the vouchers can be used anywhere owners accept
them, if the buildings comply with Section 8 standards.</TE>
<TE>   But in tough housing markets like Los Angeles, rents have
skyrocketed, and the number of owners willing to accept subsidized
tenants has drastically declined.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, 90% of voucher holders could find a place to live
before the vouchers expired, Los Angeles housing officials said. That
rate is now 45%.</TE>
<TE>   "With the vouchers, it's up to the private market to provide
sufficient affordable housing," said Craig Castellanet, staff
attorney with the National Housing Law Project. Advocates say the
purpose of the state law, which requires extensive notification of an
intent to exit the program, was to ensure that tenants had time to
find new homes or that officials could try to preserve the property
as low-income housing.</TE>
<TE>   If the situation can't be resolved, "what's the purpose of that
law?" said Christian Abasto, with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los
Angeles. Legal Aid is representing a group of tenants at L.A. Pro VI,
a collection of six buildings whose owners are also trying to remove
them from the program.</TE>
<TE>   If the housing officials had adequate warning, advocates say, they
could encourage or help a nonprofit housing group to purchase the
property.</TE>
<TE>   For several months, the Coalition for Economic Survival, a tenant
advocacy group, and other groups have tried to resolve the matters
through the Department of Housing and Urban Development, whose
Section 8 guidebook states that owners must abide by state and local
laws.</TE>
<TE>   But HUD officials argued that the agency has no role in enforcing
state or local laws. While advocates cried foul, HUD gave owners
approval to leave the program.</TE>
<TE>   "We have here our federal housing agency unwilling to take the
necessary steps to enforce their own laws and regulations and to
preserve the affordable housing that they're supposed to oversee,"
said Larry Gross, executive director of the coalition.</TE>
<TE>   HUD officials did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of federal intervention, the coalition, the Legal
Aid Foundation of Los Angeles and Neighborhood Legal Services of Los
Angeles County have tried to help tenants like Susanne Chilton.</TE>
<TE>   In her youth, Chilton worked as an aide for several members of
Congress. Later, she worked for Hughes Aircraft and for Rand Corp. as
an editor.</TE>
<TE>   Now she is lobbying to save housing for herself and other tenants.
The residents of the senior complex are not "free-loaders by the
sea," she said. They have lived fascinating lives, worked hard and
put years in the system.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't a day that goes by that we don't thank God for our
good fortune to live here, [but] I can't tell you what it's like to
look out and think, 'I wonder how many more days we have.' "</TE>
<TE>   The apartment building known as One Venice overlooks the Venice
boardwalk. On the corner across the street a shop sells tie-dyed
T-shirts and skirts. Up a bit farther on Venice Boulevard is the
Griffin Contemporary art gallery, restaurants and a tarot card
reading shop.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounded like paradise the first time I heard about it," said
Chilton, sitting in her living room, the patio door open to a view of
the ocean. In recent years, the funky flavor of Venice has found
itself competing with ritz. The asking price for each of the two
houses on the boardwalk next to the apartment is $2.4 million,
Chilton said.</TE>
<TE>   Amelia Peters, 88, says she was One Venice's first tenant. She
applied when the place was a dirt lot, with only a foreman's shack on
it. She was here for the ribbon-cutting ceremony, celebrating the
creation of beachside low-income housing for seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Unhappy Role</TE>
<TE>   "Section 8 has buildings all over the place, but they didn't have
anything nice like this," said Peters who has lived in Venice for 50
years.</TE>
<TE>   Back when she had steady work as an actress and dancer, Peters was
known as Billie Lane. A photograph album in her living room is filled
with black-and-white photographs of a stunning brunet, who appeared
in more than 300 movies, including as the doctor's daughter in "Gone
With the Wind."</TE>
<TE>   "I almost got to be a star," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Peters does not like the role she has now. Playing the part of an
"old lady about to be evicted" from her home is not something she
would have chosen. If she could do it over again, she would have
handled financial matters differently.</TE>
<TE>   "Who figured I'd live to be 88?" she said. "I never thought along
those lines."</TE>
<TE>   While the owners have a right to do what they want, the
management's failure to give tenants accurate notice is cruel, Peters
said. Most of her neighbors have no idea where they would move.</TE>
<TE>   One notice informed tenants that the owners planned to prepay a
HUD loan and opt out of the program effective Aug. 31, 2002.
According to one notice, rents would increase from $974 a month to as
much as $1,900. Parking spaces would cost an additional $100 or $300
a month.</TE>
<TE>   Under Section 8, the federal government pays the bulk of the rent.
Peters pays $208 a month in rent.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be kicked out--that's all I know," Peters said.
"They don't say that, but they don't say we get to stay either."</TE>
<TE>   A management company for the building did not return calls seeking
comment. A hearing on the city's request for an injunction is set for
today.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Renahan, who heads the city's Section 8 program, said
tenants who qualify will receive enhanced vouchers, enabling them to
pay higher rents. If an agreement can be reached between housing
officials and the building owner on new rents, tenants would be able
to keep their units even if the building leaves the program.</TE>
<TE>   Such an agreement was reached last week by housing officials and
the general partner of Arminta North and South in Sun Valley, Renahan
said.</TE>
<TE>   But what will happen with L.A. Pro VI and One Venice remains
unclear, although their Section 8 contracts have been extended for a
few months, giving the parties more time to talk.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been just absolutely dreadful," Chilton said. "It's like
being on death row and hoping for a reprieve."</TE>

<HD>Toll Runners Also Have to Elude These Guys</HD>
<DH>The agency that runs pay-to-ride roads in Orange County is
on the trail of scofflaws. One driver owes $60,914.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As head of collections for Orange County's largest tollway system,
nothing increases Joel Bishop's RPMs more than motorists who cheat at
every turn.</LD>
<LD>   Take the late-model Ferrari captured by a surveillance camera
rolling through the toll plaza at Newport Coast Drive on the winding
San Joaquin Hills toll road. It's in Newport Beach, where many homes
are worth millions of dollars. Yet the motorist is so chintzy that a
towel has been draped over the license plate to avoid a 50-cent toll.
Bishop would like to bring the scofflaw to justice, but the driver
remains at large.</LD>
<LD>   "No one is entitled to ride for free," says Bishop, a determined
road warrior whose personalized license plate reads, "PAYTOLL."</LD>
<TE>   Bishop is chief executive of VESystems, an Irvine company that was
hired two years ago by the Transportation Corridor Agencies to help
collect millions of dollars in unpaid tolls and penalties.</TE>
<TE>   The TCA, a government entity, operates 51 miles of tollways in
Orange County, including the San Joaquin Hills, the Foothill, the
Eastern and a short stretch of Highway 133. Tolls range from 50 cents
to $3, bringing in roughly $82 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Unpaid tolls amounted to $2.6 million in 1999, $2.85 million in
2000 and $1.7 million in 2001, with the number of violations
fluctuating from 1 million to 1.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The ones that are really egregious I take a personal interest
in," Bishop says. "We do a lot of research. We find out where people
work, where they go and who they are."</TE>
<TE>   VESystems and the TCA place the worst offenders on the agency's
hot list, the equivalent of the FBI's most wanted. Today, 13 drivers
are members of the exclusive club. One owes $60,914 in tolls and
penalties. Another $34,595. Still another is $31,624 in arrears.</TE>
<TE>   The most anyone has owed the Transportation Corridor Agencies is
$84,000. For at least two years the Inland Empire commuter cheated it
out of four or five tolls a day.</TE>
<TE>   TCA officials say the woman was finally apprehended and threatened
with a lawsuit. She is now on a payment plan and subscribes to
FasTrak, a system that uses dash-mounted transponders to
electronically bill her account.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop says he once helped track down a teacher after he received
tips from three sources that she was cheating the TCA. She did not
have license plates and apparently had bragged about how easy it was
to beat the toll plazas, where cameras are mounted to snap photos of
toll runners.</TE>
<TE>   The TCA finally found her when another informant gave Bishop the
vehicle identification number from her car. This led to a check at
the Department of Motor Vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "She lived close to me," Bishop said. "I started driving by the
car. I would see her on the road and start following her discreetly.
Eventually we got her, and her car was impounded."</TE>
<TE>   Finding chronic violators starts with scrutinizing photos from the
Transportation Corridor Agencies' enforcement cameras. They often
reveal a variety of techniques designed to deprive authorities of a
key piece of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   A common method is obscuring the license plate with a rag or tape
before hitting the toll road. Some motorists temporarily remove their
plates; others stash accomplices in trunks who block the plates with
their hands.</TE>
<TE>   Another photo reveals an arm with a notebook in hand stretching
from the lowered rear window of an SUV. Motorcyclists have adopted
similar methods, extending one hand over their small rear license
plates while using the other hand to steer.</TE>
<TE>   But those moves don't always work. Investigators cull the photos
for distinguishing characteristics of the vehicle that might lead to
an identification. They note the car's make, along with any damage,
decals, modifications and custom features. These clues can be relayed
to California Highway Patrol officers who patrol the tollways.</TE>
<TE>   Some drivers are so careless masking their plates that they leave
some numbers uncovered or use transparent materials that fail to mask
plate numbers when the photos are magnified.</TE>
<TE>   Other toll violators think they will never get caught because they
have kept their out-of-state plates after moving to California. The
CHP recently caught one violator and impounded his car. The Arizona
registration had not been renewed in more than two years.</TE>
<TE>   Once a toll cheater is found, Bishop hands the case to Frank
Barbagallo, the TCA's deputy director for customer services. He is
the agency's Judge Judy or Judge Dredd, depending on what measures
must be applied.</TE>
<TE>   So far, no one has been arrested, although they could be, but
Barbagallo has threatened some uncooperative motorists with civil
court action. When there is no way out, they generally come around.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the people with the highest number of violations are
really customers waiting to happen," Barbagallo said. "I feel sorry
for them, but I feel more sorry for the people who pay and have to
drive next to someone who doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   The Transportation Corridor Agencies has the power to garnishee
wages, impound vehicles, put liens on property and seek civil
judgments against people without the violator being present in court.</TE>
<TE>   Barbagallo says the process starts with an amnesty program for
first-time offenders with as many as six violations. They are
eligible--and encouraged--to become FasTrak customers.</TE>
<TE>   If problems persist, amnesty is no longer offered, and chronic
offenders cannot re-register their vehicles until they pay their
debt.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't get their cars until we come to some kind of
agreement," Barbagallo said. "I know I've got 'em at that point.
They've been laughing at us for a year and a half, and now it's my
turn."</TE>

<HD>What a Difference a Few Dots Make in Investigations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTOR GOLD</AU>
<BD>Victor Gold is national correspondent for Washingtonian
magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The trick to understanding what congressional investigatory
committees are up to--and I've been following them since Estes
Kefauver was scourging organized crime in 1951--lies in the dots the
committee members don't connect.</LD>
<LD>   Kefauver, for example, held televised hearings on illegal gambling
in major cities across the country. Notably skipped over were
Memphis, Nashville and Knoxville.</LD>
<LD>   Missing dot: What state did Kefauver represent in the U.S. Senate?</LD>
<TE>   Or take the Senate committee that investigated organized labor six
years later. One ranking member of the committee was presidential
hopeful John F. Kennedy. The committee counsel was his brother,
Bobby. The focus of the investigation was union operations in
Detroit. Teamster chief Jimmy Hoffa was called to testify, but not
United Auto Workers chief Walter Reuther.</TE>
<TE>   Missing dot: Which Detroit labor union chief was prominently
backing Sen. Kennedy's campaign for the presidency?</TE>
<TE>   Not that Democrats are the only ones to play the Capitol Hill
missing-dots game. Consider the current Republican-led investigation
of alleged insider trading involving ImClone's Sam Waksal and his
friend, Martha Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Let's take it dot by dot:</TE>
<TE>   * A federal regulatory agency, the Federal Drug Administration,
after long review, makes a decision that will adversely affect the
market value of a company (ImClone) on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   * A lawyer-lobbyist for one of the company's major business allies
(Bristol-Myers) puts a call in to Richard Pazdur, the FDA official in
charge of the review, asking Pazdur for advance information on what
the agency has decided.</TE>
<TE>   * Although news of the agency's decision has not yet been made
public, Pazdur tells Bristol-Myers' lobbyist of the adverse outcome,
informing him that a letter giving ImClone the bad news is on the
way.</TE>
<TE>   * The lobbyist gives this information to his client, who passes it
on to ImClone's CEO, Waksal.</TE>
<TE>   * Four days go by before the information privately leaked to the
lobbyist--information that FDA's Pazdur surely must have known would
affect ImClone's stock value--becomes public via a letter faxed to
the company.</TE>
<TE>   * During those four days, Waksal first calls the FDA, trying to
forestall the decision. Failing that, he unloads his ImClone stock.
His family and friends (among them, Martha Stewart) do the same.</TE>
<TE>   * When news gets out that Waksal, his family and Stewart have
unloaded their stock, the House Committee on Government Reform goes
into Congressional Outrage Mode, and the Justice Department indicts
Waksal for insider trading, i.e. trading based on information known
to the trader but not the general public.</TE>
<TE>   Missing Dot No. 1: When a public official (Pazdur) provides
information to a private company (Bristol-Myers) before that
information is made public, what responsibility does the public
official have for the stock-market scandal that follows?</TE>
<TE>   Missing Dot No. 2: If the House Committee on Government Reform is
truly interested in long-range reform rather than the headlines
gained from Martha Stewart-bashing, why isn't it looking into the FDA
practice of providing favored lawyer-lobbyists with confidential
information before releasing it to the public?</TE>
<TE>   Fill in the dots, complete the picture. Or would that take all the
fun out of Martha Stewart-bashing?</TE>

<HD>A Remedy in Iraq: Kurdish Autonomy</HD>
<DH>A division of the nation might send Saddam Hussein packing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID D. PERLMUTTER</AU>
<BD>David D. Perlmutter, an associate professor at
Louisiana State University, is a military historian.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saddam Hussein, unlike most megalomaniacs, has spells of sober
self-appraisal. In the midst of one, he told colleagues that when he
died the people of Iraq would "tear me into 500 pieces."
Occasionally, then, he appreciates that despite innumerable
"spontaneous popular demonstrations" of love for him and most of the
content of Iraqi print, radio and television praising his greatness,
he is, in fact, the most hated man in Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Yet he survives--through terror, of course, but also because many
Iraqis believe that Hussein, despite his disastrous helmsmanship of
the state, is its only anchor of territorial solidity. When he goes,
the thinking is, the nation falls apart.</LD>
<LD>   The United States should use this to its advantage.</LD>
<TE>   As it finds itself in a coalition of one to topple Hussein's
regime by outright war, it should consider instead the expedient of
robbing the Iraqi president of his last fragile justification for
power: Washington should assist in the breakup of Iraq by recognizing
the millenniums-old national aspirations of the Kurdish people. Then
Hussein's situation would become like that of Slobodan Milosevic, who
was ousted from power only when he failed to preserve Serb domination
of the sacred land of Kosovo.</TE>
<TE>   On the face of it, the moral sanction for an independent Kurdish
state is unambiguous. The Kurds have existed as an independent people
since ancient times. Unlike more prominent local aspirants for
nationhood--the Palestinians--the Kurds have a separate language,
culture, ethnic heritage and a continuous political precedent of
seeking statehood. Indeed, legally, there should be an independent
Kurdistan. The Treaty of Sevres, which delineated the breakup of the
Ottoman Empire after World War I, recognized that the Kurds deserved
their own state.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the devil's details for an independent Kurdistan in
what is now the "no-fly" zone of northern Iraq are great.</TE>
<TE>   Most regional powers, such as Turkey, Syria and Iran, oppose a
Kurdish state because they believe that it would encourage hopes--and
uprisings--for autonomy by their own Kurdish minorities. For example,
Turkey--our must-have ally for any war on Iraq--has been fighting a
decades-long insurgency war with Kurdish separatists. Other Arab
states oppose Kurdish liberation because they fear the precedent of
breaking up Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Such opposition could be overcome or dismissed on a case-by-case
basis.</TE>
<TE>   The Kurds (and the United States) could provide treaties and
assurances that Kurdistan's borders with its neighbors would be fixed
and extraterritorial Kurdish ambitions suppressed. Another "carrot"
could be that rebellious Kurds in border nations could emigrate to
the new Kurdish state. Turkey, in particular, would be happy to
siphon off all its Kurdish militants.</TE>
<TE>   Outside opposition, on the other hand, could be safely ignored. It
is one of the great ironies of Middle East politics that many Arab
leaders will blame European and Israeli colonialism for the region's
problems, yet consider the fictional national borders drawn up by
British and French cartographers to be inviolable from time
immemorial.</TE>
<TE>   In response, the United States can seize the moral mountaintop by
supporting the principle of freedom for all peoples who want their
own state. Or, put more practically, the price of an independent
Kurdistan is an independent Palestine.</TE>
<TE>   Europeans would join in recognizing a Kurdish state for that
reason alone, but also because Washington could convince them that it
would help avoid another Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   The regional consequences of Kurdistan are attractive as well.
Certainly a shrunken Iraq would be of even less danger to its
neighbors. Yet the U.S. would have to establish a strong military
presence, much like in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The Kurds would welcome permanent American bases and troop
deployments. This shift of U.S. power and personnel would lessen our
reliance on the increasingly hostile Saudi people and unreliable
Saudi regime. In addition, Al Qaeda would lose its greatest
recruiting slogan: that U.S. soldiers are trampling the holy sand of
Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   But the real unknown is the reaction of the Iraqi people. Would
they, like the Serbs, rise up to replace their failed dictator?
Hussein always has defied prophecies of his downfall. But the
erection of a secure and antagonistic state in what was the northern
fifth of Iraq would leave him clinging to power solely by fear.</TE>
<TE>   The gains are many and the risks surmountable for creating
Kurdistan. Recognizing the hopes and dreams of the Kurdish people
would allow the United States to do the right thing in the eyes of
the civilized world. It may also help it to dispose of its greatest
enemy.</TE>

<HD>The 'Pure' and Starving Poor</HD>
<DH>Environmentalists stifle modern agriculture in the Third
World.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York.</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>The apartheid system is gone, but many here at the World Summit on
Sustainable Development seem to want to bring back a form of
"separate and unequal"--for South Africa and for the rest of the
Third World--in the form of environmental regulation that would
stifle economic development.</LD>
<LD>   Politically correct greens, of course, recoil at the thought of
any kind of racism, but actions speak louder than words. So if
ecological activists from the developed countries of the north push
policies that would retard agriculture in the developing south,
consigning billions to permanent poverty, maybe they deserve to be
labeled "neo-apartheidists."</LD>
<LD>   This came clear to me as I stood inside the plush offices of
Nedcor, a major South African bank, serving as the temporary home for
the World Conservation Union. It may seem odd that a green group
would headquarter itself in the offices of a transnational company
that grew huge under apartheid, but after a while, it didn't seem so
strange. Throughout the building were special exhibits extolling
indigenous folkways, all making the point that maybe those
darker-skinned folks should keep doing what they've been doing all
these thousands of years. That is, don't bother to modernize.</LD>
<TE>   I couldn't help but think of the writings of 18th century
philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau, who praised the "noble savage,"
born "good and free" before he was corrupted by civilization.</TE>
<TE>   And so today, greens still seem intent on keeping Third Worlders
innocent of advanced civilization--even if that means keeping them
poor. One flashpoint issue is genetically engineered food. In the
last two decades, this food has become a part of our lives. Indeed,
genetically engineered-derived vaccines and medicines--targeted on
diabetes, meningitis, hepatitis, cancer--are lifesaving. Maybe that's
why I never hear about American environmentalists protesting the
advance of genetically engineered techniques; the greens of the U.S.
don't dare block American health therapies, which they themselves may
depend on.</TE>
<TE>   And while genetic engineering is common in foods grown in America,
it has provoked much opposition among global greens. So I happened
upon the premiere of a film on the evils of genetic engineering,
"Seeds of Dispute," produced by Biowatch, a green group. The show had
me going for a while--"Frankenfoods" and all that. I've seen enough
mad-scientist movies to know the risk of experiments run amok.</TE>
<TE>   But I also know that if an experiment proves itself, the greater
risk lies in not making use of the discovery. In fact, one of the
experts featured in the film was downright scary in his breezy
dismissiveness--or ignorance--of human history.</TE>
<TE>   I'm referring to Dominique de Bruin of a group called Gardens for
Africa, who noted on screen that humans have been farming for about
15,000 years. So far, so good. But then he continued with words that
gave his elitist game away: "We have managed to feed ourselves quite
nicely for 14,950 years." That is, things were fine until the
introduction of genetic engineering.</TE>
<TE>   One might ask: Is this a true statement? The answer: Only if the
words "hunger" and "starvation" entered the dictionary but recently.</TE>
<TE>   From the "seven lean years" to the Irish potato famine, hunger has
been a tragic constant in human history.</TE>
<TE>   Yet others are echoing the same back-to-the-good-old-days theme:
Skip Spitzer, based in San Francisco, writing in the Genetically
Engineered Food Alert, extolled "ecological farming" because it
"offers a viable model of a locally based, socially just,
environmentally and economically sustainable food system."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe. But maybe those are simply code words for keeping Third
Worlders in their familiar place--which may be noble but is
definitely poor.</TE>
<TE>   One who has had enough of poverty is Edwin Paraluman of General
Santos City, the Philippines. He's here too, to talk about doubled
yields he's reaped from genetically engineered crops on his 1
1/2-acre farm. He's been able to buy his first refrigerator, TV and a
motorcycle. And statistics bolster the anecdotes: According to the
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, hunger around the world has
fallen by about 95% in the last five decades.</TE>
<TE>   The greens of the north want pure food, and they also want the
people of the south to stay pure. For their part, poor southerners
want more food, period, and if they think genetic engineering will
help them, they will fight for it.</TE>

<HD>Dick Cheney's Nightmare of Peace</HD>
<DH>War could be just the thing to banish the Halliburton
specter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the dreams of Dick Cheney, to which I am not privy, I imagine
there are boldly contrasting scenes of victory and despair.</LD>
<LD>   In one fantasy, he leads a victorious U.S. Army to a hero's
welcome through the crowded streets of Baghdad, cheered wildly for
having been the most outspoken proponent of war against Saddam
Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   In his nightmares, meanwhile, he is led off in handcuffs, accused
of crimes committed while CEO of Halliburton, securing that company's
place in the ever-growing pantheon of post-boom corporate fraudsters.</LD>
<TE>   Peace, particularly the functioning of the economic order, has
turned out to be far riskier than the waging of war for this
administration. A typical American POW these days is a captain of
industry who played loose with his company's books, and both Cheney
and his alleged boss ran with that crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, we should probably leave the novelization of a hawkish
vice president's innermost thoughts to the likes of Tom Clancy.
Regardless of Cheney's best-and worst-case scenarios, there are
myriad other destinations still possible on the strange, grim trip
we've all taken since that bizarre election night not yet two years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the go-it-alone invasion of Old Mesopotamia that
Cheney is pushing could dangerously backfire in the ways a bunch of
Republican elders are predicting: Eroding allied support for the
campaign against Al Qaeda, further destabilizing the Middle East and
raising the likelihood that Hussein might launch whatever nasty
weapons he does have.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney, though, is unmoved by voices of moderation. He even argues
that the return of U.N. weapons inspectors to Iraq, something the
U.S. and our allies have been demanding for years, would only
strengthen Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the veep is worried that the inspectors might not find the
weapons of mass destruction that he, almost alone, is convinced are
already operational.</TE>
<TE>   As for the CEO-in-handcuffs nightmare, it would be wrong to deny
Cheney the presumption of innocence in any of the possible violations
by Halliburton being pursued by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Still, one can imagine Cheney bolting awake in a cold sweat and
moaning, "How could I have been so stupid as to make a video
effusively thanking Arthur Andersen for giving me 'good advice over
and above the normal by-the-books audit arrangements'?"</TE>
<TE>   There's just no way that sounds good when the SEC is looking into
whether Halliburton cooked the books like those of other companies
that the disgraced accounting firm helped to defraud stockholders.
Somehow, we Joe Blows thought corporate accountants should keep to
"normal by-the-books audit arrangements" when assessing the companies
we pour our retirement savings into.</TE>
<TE>   Color us naive.</TE>
<TE>   But, as with the Republican war skeptics, here too Cheney is being
bitten from behind. A conservative organization that successfully
hounded Bill Clinton for years, Judicial Watch, charged in a lawsuit
that "Vice President Cheney broke the law" with accounting tricks as
Halliburton's CEO.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney also might be wondering whether he wasn't a bit too greedy
in grabbing an $18-million profit on the sale of his Halliburton
shares shortly before the stock tanked. Whether it was insider
trading or just luck, the timing looks bad; no wonder, then, that a
CNN poll showed only 11% of Americans believed that the vice
president was telling the truth about his Halliburton history.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney is not dumb. He assuredly recognizes his future reputation
and domicile might be riding on a Republican sweep of the November
election.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine what a field day a Democrat-controlled Congress would have
looking into how Cheney was able to cash out with $30 million after
sending Halliburton down the road to possible bankruptcy, thanks to
his lack of "due diligence" on a merger deal?</TE>
<TE>   It might also take a close look at a decade of lucrative
government contracts Halliburton secured while Cheney was in and then
out and then back in the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Or, how about that whole Enron thing, so many corporate scandals
ago?</TE>
<TE>   A Democrat-controlled Congress might be able to finally get
answers to what exactly Enron's role was in the Cheney-led drafting
of the administration's energy policy. The VP has managed to keep
secret the minutes of meetings between himself and Enron
officials--including top Bush campaign contributor and then-Enron CEO
Kenneth Lay.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the elusive Cheney has a bunch of good explanations for all
of this bad-smelling stuff. Until he decides to publicly share them,
however, his passion on Iraq will remind many of us of the old saying
that patriotism is the last refuge of scoundrels. For Cheney and his
embattled cohorts in the White House, facing a potential second
recession in their first term, peace is just too risky. Better to go
back to sleep and dream of war.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On the day the Los Angeles Police Commission announced it had
narrowed the candidates for police chief to 13, a suspected gang
member walked up to three workers outside a Wilshire Boulevard Koo
Koo Roo restaurant and shot them to death.</LD>
<LD>   As this brazen triple killing illustrates, the most urgent task
for the next chief will be quelling a three-year surge in homicides,
most of them involving gangs. And not just when the bullets and
bodies land in Brentwood.</LD>
<LD>   What set the Wilshire Boulevard killings apart from the 425 other
homicides in Los Angeles so far this year was location. Brentwood's
polished high-rises are at least a mile from the nearest neighborhood
known for what is euphemistically called gang activity, and even
farther from the barrios and ghettos where young men with few
prospects slaughter bystanders and each other with numbing
regularity.</LD>
<TE>   The unspoken assumption in the rest of the city is that as long as
the mayhem is confined to neighborhoods where the chicken joints are
cheap and greasy, it's not our problem; those of us with skinless,
flame-broiled poultry tastes are safe. Outrage wanes once gangs go
back to where they "belong."</TE>
<TE>   This unwritten policy of containment condemns the city's poorest
residents to lives of terror. (You don't get used to gunshots, even
when you hear them every night.) And it promises everyone else only a
facade of safety, one easily penetrated by bullets. The geography of
fear recognizes no borders.</TE>
<TE>   In South Los Angeles' 77th Street Division, the body count so far
this year is 78--more than the 55 fatalities that resulted from the
worst rioting in modern U.S. history, which a decade ago racked that
very part of the city.</TE>
<TE>   In the days after the 1992 riots, Angenelos long accustomed to
leading separate lives flocked to South-Central--shaken and anxious
but eager to pitch in and rebuild a community, to be a community.
Today's rash of killings deserves no less a response.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles can't go on pretending that it is two cities, rich and
poor. Former LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks, whose own granddaughter was
killed by a gangster's bullet, worked to close the gap between
communities.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles needs a police chief who will pick up where Parks left
off--someone who can make clear to Brentwood entertainment attorneys
and El Sereno janitors alike that stopping gang slaughter is the
department's most urgent task. It needs a chief who will serve and
protect a single city.</TE>

<HD>Cleanup in Nicaragua</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Throughout Arnoldo Aleman's five years as president of Nicaragua, the
local rumor was that he--along with members of his family and inner
political circle--was getting "inexplicably" richer by the minute.
But rumor doesn't amount to evidence, and there was little the people
could do to prove corruption.</LD>
<LD>   Now, things are beginning to change. Enrique Bolanos won the
November presidential election on a platform that emphasized struggle
against corruption. Bolanos, the former vice president and a
businessman of spotless personal reputation, has kept his promise
by--surprisingly--going after his old boss, Aleman.</LD>
<LD>   Corruption in Nicaragua is nothing new. The Somoza family
ransacked the country for 40 years. And before leaving power in 1990,
Sandinista comandantes "expropriated" the houses of the rich for
themselves. That same year, before becoming mayor of Managua, Aleman
declared personal assets of $26,000. Upon leaving the presidential
office in 2001, he put his wealth at $1.4 million. The true figure is
believed to be much more.</LD>
<TE>   In early August, Bolanos publicly accused his predecessor of
having stolen nearly $100 million from government coffers. "Arnoldo,
I never dreamed you would betray your people like this," said
Bolanos. "You took the pensions from the retirees, medicine from the
sick, salaries from the teachers. You stole the people's trust."</TE>
<TE>   The country's acting attorney general exhibited the evidence:
checks and letters signed by Aleman that showed how millions were
tapped from government offices and diagrams that traced the
laundering of the funds through shell companies and offshore banks.</TE>
<TE>   Aleman unfortunately enjoys immunity from prosecution because he
remains head of the National Assembly. Bolanos has asked legislators
to strip Aleman's immunity when the Assembly reconvenes early this
month after summer recess. The president is up against a very tough,
entrenched political class.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Otto Reich helped by visiting
Managua last week to show support for Bolanos and disdain for Aleman,
a former protege of U.S. governments. The United States should assist
in investigation of charges that Aleman laundered money through banks
in Panama, the Caribbean and Miami.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. might also ask for Aleman's extradition under U.S.
money-laundering laws, which would make Bolanos' job easier.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors of the Central American nation should make it clear to
Nicaraguan legislators that granting immunity to leaders accused of
corruption jeopardizes regional free-trade agreements with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   As Reich warned in a recent speech on Latin American issues: "Good
governance is essential. Among the hazards we face on the path to
freedom and prosperity, corruption is the most insidious."</TE>

<LD>The Bush administration's decision to quit its appeal of a lawsuit
pitting farmers against the environment in the Sacramento-San Joaquin
river delta threatens to revive some of California's most bitter
water battles. And there's concern that the action signals a waning
of federal support for Cal-Fed, the program to end those old wars and
to restore the environment of the two rivers' delta and San Francisco
Bay.</LD>
<LD>   An Interior Department official says nothing's really changed and
the administration remains committed to Cal-Fed, the $8.5-billion
cooperative state-federal program to revitalize the delta. But
considering the Bush record on the environment--reciting platitudes
while unraveling good policy--it's prudent to remain skeptical. The
department and its U.S. Bureau of Reclamation will have to back up
those assurances with actions.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute started when the giant Westlands Water District sued
the Interior Department over interpretation of a 1992 law that
ordered the Bureau of Reclamation to dedicate 800,000 acre-feet of
water annually from its Central Valley Project to environmental
protection, primarily for the health of fish in the bay-delta system.</LD>
<TE>   Westlands claimed the criteria the bureau used actually resulted
in diverting 1.1 million acre-feet for the fish, cutting into the
farm district's allocation. (One acre-foot meets the household needs
of two families a year). A federal judge in Fresno ruled in favor of
Westlands. The Clinton administration and the Natural Resources
Defense Council appealed, seeking to uphold the rule.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Bush administration has dropped the appeal. Assistant
Interior Secretary Bennett W. Raley says the formula will be
simplified. The fish will get their 800,000 acre-feet, he added. But
Barry Nelson of the Natural Resources Defense Council says the fish
may actually lose 300,000 acre-feet if the accounting system is
changed.</TE>
<TE>   The allocation is a key provision of Cal-Fed, which is designed to
restore environments damaged by years of pumping water from the delta
and to stabilize water deliveries to farmers and Southern California
homes.</TE>
<TE>   If Cal-Fed is allowed to unravel after years of negotiation and
delicate compromise, the state will fall back into water warfare and
allocation of supplies by the courts. With water supplies shrinking
everywhere, such a war is unaffordable.</TE>

<HD>Creating a Timeless Place in an Ever-Changing City</HD>
<DH>Architecture: Jose Rafael Moneo sought to define what makes
a space sacred.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Around 6 Friday evening, a groggy, bespectacled man in a wrinkled
blazer slipped undetected into the rear entrance of the Cathedral of
Our Lady of the Angels. The construction workers were gone, the
opening was two days off, and the low sun threw orange light sideways
across the walls and windows.</LD>
<LD>   "When you stand here," said the man softly, "you feel the walls as
sources of light."</LD>
<LD>   "And when you stand here, the ceiling is like wings, folded,
protecting you."</LD>
<TE>   Then, as the man pointed up toward the cross behind the altar, a
security guard stepped up.</TE>
<TE>   "Architect?" inquired the guard.</TE>
<TE>   Architect, indeed. After six years of work bringing this building
from his imagination to the corner of Grand Avenue and Temple Street,
Jose Rafael Moneo of Madrid was taking a few covert minutes inside
the vast concrete-and-alabaster structure.</TE>
<TE>   "It is always rewarding, and at the same time sad, to finish a
work," Moneo said. Earlier in the day, speaking in Spanish to a
television interviewer, Moneo compared the vast church to a ship
still in dry dock.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward," he said, "to when the ship is finally out
in the ocean."</TE>
<TE>   Moneo, 65, has seen perhaps 80 of his building designs realized in
his career, has served as chairman of the Harvard University Graduate
School of Design's architecture department (from 1985 to 1990) and
has won the highest global honor in architecture, the Pritzker Prize
(in 1996, the same year he won the competition to design Los Angeles'
new Catholic cathedral).</TE>
<TE>   But before this, Moneo had never designed a religious building and
had never had such a high-profile project outside his homeland.</TE>
<TE>   After six years of monthly visits to Los Angeles from Madrid and a
vacation on the Spanish island of Majorca that lasted through most of
August, Moneo flew into California on Thursday night, just hours
ahead of the cathedral's last round of pre-opening news conferences
and walk-throughs. For the next week, he said, he'll be quietly
hanging around the site, watching it come to life.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have achieved most of what we were looking for," Moneo
said. He also professed deep respect for Cardinal Roger M. Mahony's
leadership on the project.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the architect said, he would have liked to have handled
more details himself, from the kneelers scattered in chapels around
the cathedral to the cardinal's chair by the altar (made by another
artist). Most volubly, Moneo has spent months on a futile campaign to
reduce the number of hanging lamps over the cathedral's pews.</TE>
<TE>   Many insiders on the project have fretted that the lamps, which
resemble downward-aiming trumpets and hold small speakers as well as
lightbulbs, mar the visitor's crucial first view of the altar from
the rear of the cathedral. Mahony has maintained that the pews need
that light. Moneo suggested dryly on Friday that as a worshiper in a
pew, "you don't need the same light that you need for surgical
intervention.... I am sure the cathedral, with half of the lamps we
have today, would be much nicer."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Moneo said, working with Mahony has been simpler than
dealing with bureaucracies, and much easier than dealing with the
Prado Museum in Madrid, where his design for an extension has been
bogged down for years.</TE>
<TE>   Onlookers have been struck by the stark surfaces of the church's
sand-colored concrete walls, but their designer has been living with
that idea for so long that his gaze travels easily and rapidly across
the church exterior. Inside, strolling the aisles and ambulatories,
Moneo pointed with satisfaction to several asymmetrical chapels along
the entrance ambulatory (the architect's nod to the diverse nature of
Mahony's flock); to the vast alabaster clerestory windows, which
filter light into sepia hues; to the tall concrete cross behind the
altar, which is visible to northbound cars on the Hollywood Freeway,
which happens to flow along the Camino Real route blazed by Spanish
missionaries in the 18th century.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing his stroll, he frowned at a porcelain Madonna he'd like
to see on a higher pedestal, and confessed that he would have liked
more input on the mausoleum beneath the cathedral and the cardinal's
residence across the plaza. He lamented the lost portico (vetoed by
Mahony, the architect said) that would have offered shade to
worshipers as they drew close to sculptor Robert Graham's bronze
cathedral doors. Yet he shrugged off the fake owl someone had
installed above the entrance to discourage birds.</TE>
<TE>   As for the artworks displayed in and around the cathedral, "Don't
ask me what features I like and don't like," Moneo said. "There are
some that I clearly don't like. But I don't need to share completely
with the cardinal his aesthetic tastes."</TE>
<TE>   The principal challenge in the job, Moneo said, was simply coming
to a definition of what makes a space sacred today, especially in a
community where so many different heritages intersect. Another was
crafting a building to last centuries in a city "that is continually
liberating itself and changing, always in the process of continual
renovation." If his job is done well, Moneo said, "the opinion of
people in 50 years won't be any different" from the popular opinion
that emerges in coming months and years.</TE>
<TE>   But that's still ahead. At 6:30 Friday evening, the bespectacled
man appeared at the mouth of the cathedral parking structure, asking
for a taxi that would take him to his Westside hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The parking-lot worker gave the man the same once-over the
security guard had. Was he, the worker asked in Spanish, the man who
designed the cathedral? Moneo nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "Felicidades," said the worker. "Es muy bonita." (Congratulations.
It's very pretty.)</TE>
<TE>   The architect nodded in thanks and headed off to launch his ship.</TE>

<HD>Eyeing 'Axis of Evil,' Russia Sees Bottom Line</HD>
<DH>Commerce: U.S. officials warn that trade with Iran, Iraq
and North Korea will cost Moscow goodwill. But the Kremlin needs
cash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>The more U.S. officials press Russia to abandon deals with Iran, Iraq
and North Korea, the closer Moscow's relations appear to become with
the nations President Bush calls the "axis of evil."</LD>
<LD>   Russia has plans for a $40-billion trade deal with Iraq and more
nuclear reactor sales to Iran and is pushing a project to link the
Trans-Siberian Railroad with lines belonging to North Korea.</LD>
<LD>   Whenever Russia cozies up to these states, U.S. officials like to
point out that losing American goodwill can be expensive. A good
relationship with the United States would be worth a lot more
financially to Russia than whatever Iran, Iraq or North Korea can
offer, they argue.</LD>
<TE>   Many observers speculate that Russia's cooperation with the three
countries has a political edge, designed to prod America and enable
Moscow to compete for global influence.</TE>
<TE>   But one motivation may be more fiscal than political. Russian
President Vladimir V. Putin is pursuing a more muscular and pragmatic
direction in Russian foreign relations--one in which the bottom line
is economic.</TE>
<TE>   "It has become clear in Russia that America thinks first and
foremost about pursuing its own economic and political interests. And
Russia, following suit, is starting to profess the same policies,"
said Alexander A. Konovalov, head of the Institute for Strategic
Assessment, a Moscow think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia has long had relations with all three states.... And it
would be stupid if Russia all of a sudden decided to sever all
business contacts with these three countries just as a concession to
Washington," Konovalov said. "Russia cannot afford to make such an
expensive gift."</TE>
<TE>   Russian analysts point to neighboring Ukraine, which under U.S.
pressure dumped a $45-million deal to supply turbines to a nuclear
power station in Iran four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Russia made the deal instead, and the power plant, in Bushehr on
the west coast of Iran, is now nearly complete. Russia has floated
draft plans to supply a total of six nuclear reactors to Iran,
despite intense U.S. opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia remembers very well the time when Ukraine pulled out of
the Bushehr project in exchange for American promises to invest money
in Ukraine's economy," said Anton Khlopkov, an analyst with the
Center for Policy Studies in Russia, a Moscow-based think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. never delivered, and now Ukraine is kicking itself for
having dropped out. Today, Ukraine is trying to restore ties with
Iran," Khlopkov said. "Naturally, Russia does not want to find itself
in that situation."</TE>
<TE>   Russia is Iraq's biggest trade partner, followed by France and
Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. De-Emphasis</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, one official sought to play down the threat
posed to U.S.-Russian relations by the planned business deals.</TE>
<TE>   He said that although the United States has registered its
objections to the Russian plans to build more nuclear reactors for
Iran, U.S. officials don't believe that the Iraq trade deal will
amount to much and don't see anything necessarily wrong with the
Russian-North Korean railroad plans.</TE>
<TE>   On the issue of North Korea, the U.S. official said that although
the North has been "politically isolated," the country has long had
business contacts with the Russians that the United States has not
found objectionable. North and South Korea have agreed on a joint
railroad venture, and the U.S. official noted that the United States
also plans talks with the North Koreans about possible joint
projects.</TE>
<TE>   The official, who asked to remain unidentified, said the discussed
plans for a deal with Iraq amount to "kind of a phony agreement.
Nobody expects anything to come of them." He added that the U.S.
simply wants the Russians to observe the terms of U.N. sanctions on
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Like the U.S. official, Russian analysts are skeptical of the
$40-billion deal, which Moscow insists wouldn't breach U.N. sanctions
against Iraq imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a strong suspicion that Saddam Hussein will not pay
Russia anything. All this talk about $40 billion is nothing but hot
air," Konovalov said. "It is merely an Iraqi propaganda gimmick."</TE>
<TE>   Still, U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has objected to
Russia's ties to the countries, warning that investors would shy away
from Russia if it made deals with nations such as Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that Russia decides that it wants to parade its
relationships with countries like Iraq and Libya and Syria and Cuba
and North Korea, it sends a message out across the globe that that is
what Russia thinks is a good thing to do, to deal with the terrorist
states," Rumsfeld said. "It's almost like self-executing."</TE>
<TE>   In response, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Boris Malakhov
warned against mixing U.S. foreign policy with the interests of
investors.</TE>
<TE>   "Mixing ideology with economic ties is a thing of the past, which
was characteristic of the Cold War that Russia and the United States
worked to end," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most Russian observers agree that Russia's cooperation with Iran,
Iraq and North Korea irritates but doesn't threaten its relations
with America.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 12 months, Putin has made several momentous
concessions to the United States: accepting U.S. troops in former
Soviet Central Asian states during the Afghanistan campaign;
abandoning Russia's fierce opposition to Washington's decision to opt
out of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and develop a national
missile defense shield; and softening its stance on expansion of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</TE>
<TE>   Putin's pro-U.S. stance, which rankles many bureaucrats in the
Russian military, intelligence and foreign service sectors, has so
far appeared to pay few dividends for him. America has offered little
in return, but Putin is hoping for future U.S. support to help his
country join the World Trade Organization and become more fully
integrated into the global economy.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Putin's willingness to shift ground on strategic weapons
treaties that were once immutable, he has refused to budge in the
face of U.S. pressure over trade with countries America seeks to
isolate.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's trade with the three states isn't new. After the fall of
the Soviet Union more than a decade ago, then-President Boris N.
Yeltsin enthusiastically embraced America and the West, but as NATO's
1999 expansion loomed, he became wary and distrustful.</TE>
<TE>   He fired his pro-Western foreign minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, in
1996 and replaced him with the pragmatic Middle East specialist
Yevgeny M. Primakov, who later became prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   Primakov was the architect of the policy to reinvigorate ties with
Arab countries and Iran, Iraq and North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Like Yeltsin, Putin has made an effort to cultivate powerful
European allies France, Germany and Britain, at times trying to split
the United States and Europe on matters such as Iraq policy--for
example, cooperating with France in early 2001 to campaign for a
suspension of sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia's policies have become more pragmatic," Khlopkov said.
"Today, the Putin administration calculates how much Russia may lose
through canceled contracts with the U.S. that would follow from its
decision to develop ties with, say, Iran."</TE>
<TE>   Of the three states, Iran is the most promising for Russia, with
the first stage of the Bushehr nuclear power plant alone worth $800
million to Moscow. A recent draft Russian policy on trade sketched
out a plan to build five more reactors over the next 10 years, which
could be worth about $6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Russia insists that its dealings with Iran will not enable Tehran
to develop nuclear weapons. U.S. officials, however, are convinced
that Russia has handed over sensitive technology that could be used
to do that.</TE>
<TE>   Economically speaking, Iraq and North Korea are less encouraging
prospects. North Korea's command economy is in dire straits, and Iraq
is subject to U.N. sanctions. The latter owes Russia $7 billion in
Soviet-era debt, or about $12 billion in today's terms.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very few economic benefits in Russia-North Korea
relations," Konovalov said.</TE>
<TE>   To underscore North Korea's limited potential, one need only look
to an announcement that came out of a recent meeting between Putin
and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il: North Korea had bought 260
Russian tractors, not the stuff of a vigorously pumping trade
partnership. Bilateral trade amounts to only $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We are supplying some equipment that cannot be called modern, let
alone offensive, to North Korea," Russian Defense Minister Sergei B.
Ivanov said last week.</TE>
<TE>   As for Iraq, Russian oil companies have large interests in the
country's oil, which accounts for 35% of Iraq's U.N.-approved oil for
export.</TE>
<TE>   'Regime Change' Fear</TE>
<TE>   Despite Moscow's disillusionment with Hussein's regime, Russia
fears that if he is toppled, U.S. and British oil companies will rush
into Iraq, pushing Russian companies out.</TE>
<TE>   Russia sees Bush's determination to topple Hussein as an eagerness
to let U.S. companies control the oil and gas industry in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "It's doubtful whether Russia can continue as the biggest economic
partner of Iraq if the regime is replaced," Khlopkov said.</TE>
<TE>   While Baghdad is under U.N. sanctions, Russia can neither expand
its trade nor hope for the return of Iraq's debt to the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts see the planned deal with Baghdad as Putin's way of
mollifying the anti-U.S. elements in the military and bureaucracy
here. But Foreign Ministry spokesman Malakhov insisted that the deal
would pay off for Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "We are preparing a long-term economic cooperation program with
Iraq," Malakhov said. "And if Russian business goes along, it means
there are direct interests and direct benefits."</TE>

<LD>A Peruvian general who was a key witness in a corruption case against
former spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos was found dead in an apparent
suicide, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Retired Gen. Oscar Villanueva, under house arrest on embezzlement
and conspiracy charges, also faced allegations that he used $20,000
in state funds to buy jewels for Montesinos to give to television
personality Laura Bozzo.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Villanueva was found in his brother's home, shot in
the mouth. He left two farewell letters. "It was an apparent
suicide," prosecutor Mercedes Velez said. Peru blames Montesinos for
widespread corruption under disgraced former President Alberto
Fujimori.</LD>

<HD>Rising Crime Drives Japanese to Fight Back With Gizmos</HD>
<DH>Asia: Fed up with the police, public turns to security
robots, special locks and panic rooms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>By the standards of industrialized countries, Japan is incredibly
safe. Few areas are too dangerous to walk at night, lost purses and
wallets generally are returned with valuables intact, and missing
bicycles often turn up the next day, after being "borrowed" by
drunken businessmen.</LD>
<LD>   So why are security-conscious Japanese snapping up high-end locks,
robots and panic rooms at a record pace?</LD>
<LD>   Because everything is relative, and crime in Japan has spiked in
recent years--albeit from a low base.</LD>
<TE>   "Japan always seemed like such a safe country," Akito Masunaga,
45, a trading company executive, said recently after installing extra
locks in his house. "Now it's a country surrounded by fear."</TE>
<TE>   Although Japan saw only 1,985 crimes per 100,000 people in 2000,
according to Interpol statistics--which is less than half the 4,123
in the U.S.--that represents a 25% rise over 1995 levels. During the
same five-year period, the U.S. experienced a slight decline.</TE>
<TE>   Throw in several high-profile attacks and mounting police
scandals, and it's easy to see why Japanese are lapping up security
equipment, services and gizmos in a quest for peace of mind.</TE>
<TE>   Kaori Sano, a 31-year-old employee of an apparel company, returned
to her Tokyo apartment late one night in July to find her door ajar
and her VCR, computer and watches gone.</TE>
<TE>   Police informed her that she was the fourth person in her building
to be robbed in recent weeks. Officers showed little interest in
catching the thief, she said, focusing instead on playing down the
value of her stolen items in an apparent bid to make politically
sensitive crime figures look smaller.</TE>
<TE>   A National Police Agency official denied any such practice and
said the real problem is a lack of personnel. "Crime rates just keep
rising, and the officers can't keep up," said the official,
requesting anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Sano hoped that her landlord would install a high-end magnetic
tumbler lock, but he added only another ordinary lock--and even that
took three weeks. Now Sano is considering spending hundreds of
dollars on additional safety devices, provided she can figure out
which offer the greatest security.</TE>
<TE>   "I always considered my neighborhood a good place for women living
alone," she said. "Now that something's happened to me, I feel so
vulnerable."</TE>
<TE>   Exact statistics on how much Japanese are spending on security
products and services aren't available, but analysts say the amount
is growing by leaps and bounds. Secom, Japan's largest security
company, says its home-protection business is expanding 20% annually.
Demand for Miwa Lock Co.'s high-end cylinders has tripled in the last
two years, while Asahi Glass reports strong interest in tempered
panes, which are much stronger than regular windows.</TE>
<TE>   The rate of theft in many categories has doubled in the last five
years, and experts say several factors related to Japan's changing
lifestyle are behind the increase.</TE>
<TE>   The breakdown of the extended family leaves houses unoccupied most
of the day. Impersonal city life blunts the protection neighbors
provided until relatively recently in close-knit communities, while
Japan's aging society means that more people are vulnerable to
attack. Finally, rising unemployment is prompting more people to turn
to crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Security is no longer something that can be taken for granted,"
said Norihiko Yoshida, an official with Secom. "It's no longer
something that comes for free."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the Japanese mind-set started to change after 1995,
when the devastating Kobe earthquake and a sarin gas attack in the
Tokyo subway made many people feel insecure. Although murder rates
have not risen in recent years, high-profile crimes have undercut
people's confidence.</TE>
<TE>   In July, a 16-year-old girl was kidnapped and killed in Gunma
prefecture, and the manager of a Tokyo convenience store was stabbed
to death by an auto thief trying to steal $5 worth of food.</TE>
<TE>   Although Japan has had nothing like the rash of high-profile child
abductions that have so rattled U.S. parents recently, it has had a
few. Generally, they've been committed by acquaintances of the
child's family trying to obtain a ransom to pay off crippling debts.</TE>
<TE>   Secom and toy maker Tomy have teamed up on a global positioning
system that allows parents to track their children over the Internet
for $4 a month. Though it's not clear what happens if the kidnapper
throws away the device, Secom will send a team after a missing
child--for $80 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of a growing public outcry, authorities have reduced
the age at which people can be tried as adults to 14 from 20,
installed security cameras in high-crime neighborhoods such as
Tokyo's Kabukicho and promised crime-busting countermeasures.</TE>
<TE>   But public trust in Japan's scandal-plagued law enforcement has
dropped as crime has spiked.</TE>
<TE>   "People are skeptical the police will handle their complaint
seriously," said Susumu Oda, professor of criminal psychiatry at
Tezukayama Gakuin University.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 319 police officers were dismissed, suspended or
reprimanded in the first six months of this year, according to the
National Police Agency, an increase of 30% over the previous year.
This included 40 found stealing and several who had molested crime
victims or prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't trust the police," said Nobuko Koshitaka, 31, who has
taken to traveling with a loud buzzer in her purse. "I feel like I
have to watch out for myself."</TE>
<TE>   Another low-tech option, Mace, is selling well, particularly among
young women.</TE>
<TE>   More expensive defensive devices include Misawa Homes'
limited-edition panic room--about 3 square yards at $4,000 to $8,000.
Residents under attack can retreat to this sealed-off area, which
boasts encased phone lines. A robot disguised as a chair in an outer
room can set off an alarm on hearing certain phrases such as "Give me
your money."</TE>
<TE>   Kyoto-based Exsight reports interest in its James Bond-style
gizmos, including bulletproof helmets, gas masks, stun guns, pepper
sprays in the shape of lipstick tubes and briefcases that spew smoke.</TE>
<TE>   And Sanyo Electric and robot maker Tmsuk have teamed up on a
four-legged droid they plan to introduce next year. It will notify
residents by phone if a window is broken while they're at work, then
bark at the window and respond to remote commands.</TE>

<HD>Expelling Kin of Suspects Approved</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Israeli court clears way for deportation of
brother and sister who it says were shown to have aided alleged
terrorist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>In a potentially far-reaching case that pitted human rights against a
nation's need for self-defense, Israel's highest court ruled today
that the army can expel the relatives of alleged Palestinian
militants.</LD>
<LD>   The army, backed by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, maintained that
banishing the families will deter potential suicide bombers from
attacking Israelis. Human rights experts countered that targeting
relatives is a form of collective punishment forbidden by
international law.</LD>
<LD>   Deportation is one of a number of draconian measures Israeli
authorities are resorting to in their fight to crush a 23-month-old
Palestinian uprising and wave of bombings and armed ambushes.</LD>
<TE>   Today's case involved three Palestinians whom the military wanted
to expel from their hometowns in the West Bank to the Gaza Strip
because of support they allegedly gave siblings who organized or
carried out terror attacks. The Gaza Strip is easier to control
because, unlike the West Bank, it is fenced in; the army says no
suicide bomber has ever emerged from Gaza and reached Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In its ruling, the court indicated that a relative's involvement
has to be clearly established. It said a brother and sister accused
of aiding another brother, an alleged terrorist, can be expelled. But
a third defendant, whose complicity the court said was not clearly
established, cannot be deported, the court ruled.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling means that the army does not have blanket power to
transfer relatives of suspects from the West Bank to Gaza but must
provide evidence of involvement case by case.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials said they were pleased that the decision went
as far as it did, but lamented that the court did not give the army a
freer hand. Attorneys for the Palestinians said they were glad that
actual acts, not the notion of deterrence alone, would serve as the
basis for relocating relatives. Still, they said they would continue
to fight any deportation of relatives.</TE>
<TE>   A special nine-judge panel--enhanced from the usual three
members--heard the case. Chief Justice Aharon Barak returned early
from a vacation to preside, reflecting the importance attached to the
matter.</TE>
<TE>   In a hearing last week, Barak and other judges questioned the
government's attorney, Shai Nitzan, on whether expelling the three
individuals would prevent specific attacks. They also wanted to know
about any concrete complicity on the relatives' part with the
militancy of the suspected terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Kifah Ajouri and his sister Intisar are accused of helping their
brother Ali, whom Israeli forces tracked down and killed last month.
Ali was accused by Israel of dispatching two suicide bombers to a Tel
Aviv neighborhood where they killed five bystanders.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli government attorneys contend that Intisar sewed the
explosive belts used by Ali's charges. Intisar denied the allegation,
telling a military court last month that she was a pharmacy student
who didn't know how to sew.</TE>
<TE>   Also facing deportation was Abed Nasser Assida, who is alleged to
have provided transportation to his brother Nasser, an operative with
the radical Islamic organization Hamas who allegedly staged two
deadly shooting sprees outside the Jewish settlement of Emmanuel. A
total of 19 people were killed.</TE>
<TE>   In last week's hearing, Nitzan argued that the expulsions do not
violate international law. The Geneva Conventions, he said, bar the
transfer of people from occupied territory to the state of the
occupier or to a third country. But expulsion from one part of
occupied territory--the West Bank--to another--the Gaza Strip--is
permitted, he argued.</TE>
<TE>   Barak asked why the three were not being put on trial, if the
charges against them are so critical. Nitzan said banishment was
quicker and thus served as more of a deterrent.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Assida and the Ajouris said the assistance they
provided their brothers amounted to little more than food and the
kind of shelter relatives routinely give one another.</TE>
<TE>   Dalia Kerstein, director of a human rights center representing the
Palestinians, said Monday that the court was under considerable
political and public pressure to endorse the expulsions. Sharon and
his army general staff have sold the public on the idea that the
deportations will end violence, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The justices take into consideration the atmosphere," she said.
"They don't want to confront everyone."</TE>

<HD>'Free' Whale Is Welcomed by Norwegians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OSLO</DL>
<LD>Keiko, the killer whale who became famous as the star of "Free
Willy," has turned up in a Norwegian fiord, six weeks after he was
returned to the wild from his pen in Iceland.</LD>
<LD>   "It's definitely him. We have tracked him from Iceland," Fernando
Ugarte, part of the team monitoring the orca's progress, said by
telephone Monday from a ship in the fiord.</LD>
<LD>   After Keiko spent most of his life in captivity, volunteers for
years trained him for life in the wild. He was released from his pen
in Iceland in July and swam nearly 870 miles to a western Norwegian
fiord.</LD>
<TE>   The orca surprised and delighted Norwegians, who petted and swam
with him, and climbed on his back as he splashed in the Skaalvik
Fiord, about 250 miles northwest of Oslo.</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers expressed tongue-in-cheek surprise over the whale
coming to Norway, since the oil-rich Scandinavian nation of 4.5
million people commercially hunts whales despite a global whaling
ban.</TE>
<TE>   However, Norway's whalers only hunt minke whales.</TE>
<TE>   Ugarte is monitoring the whale on behalf of the Ocean Futures
Society and the Humane Society of the United States. He said Keiko
was in excellent shape but still seems to prefer humans to other
whales.</TE>

<HD>7 Terror Suspects Arrested in Netherlands</HD>
<DH>Europe: Men are accused of being recruiters for Al Qaeda.
Authorities are unsure of their identities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>AMSTERDAM</DL>
<LD>Dutch authorities said Monday that they had arrested seven men
suspected of recruiting for the Al Qaeda terrorist network of Osama
bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   "We think they are providing financial and logistical support to
Al Qaeda and also recruiting young male persons for the jihad," or
holy war, national prosecutors' office spokesman Wim de Bruin said.</LD>
<LD>   Twelve suspects were originally arrested Friday, and eight, one of
whom was freed, were brought before a judge Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The seven men who remain in custody, ages 25 to 35, allegedly used
false passports and aliases.</TE>
<TE>   "They all claim to have nationalities not European.... We are
still investigating the identities of the suspects. We are not quite
sure of their real identities," spokesman De Bruin said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities arrested the seven in Rotterdam, Eindhoven and Den
Helder about a week after the Dutch intelligence service passed on
information to the prosecutors' office, De Bruin said.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement came shortly after prosecutors leveled fresh
charges against four other suspects already in custody accused of
plotting to attack U.S. targets in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Monday in Rotterdam, prosecutors charged the four--two
Algerians, a Frenchman and a Dutchman--with plotting to attack
Belgium's Kleine Brogel air force base, where anti-nuclear activists
believe the U.S. stores nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The four suspects, who remain in custody, had already been charged
with plotting to attack the American Embassy in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Frenchman Jerome Courtailler was arrested in Rotterdam along with
Algerian Mohammed Berkous and Dutchman Saad Ibrahim within days of
the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Police found fake passports, driver's licenses and credit cards in
their Rotterdam home, as well as videos featuring messages to
followers from Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Algerian-born Adel Tobbichi was extradited to the Netherlands from
Canada two months ago, accused of forging documents and belonging to
a terrorist organization suspected of plotting to blow up the U.S.
Embassy in Paris.</TE>

<HD>Details Emerge in Papua Attack, but Not Suspects</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Two Toyota Land Cruisers carrying American teachers and their
families slowly wound their way up the steep mountain road Saturday
toward the giant Freeport mine in Indonesia's Papua province. Behind
them were three trucks driven by local employees of the U.S.-owned
mine, the richest gold and copper mine in the world.</LD>
<LD>   As the vehicles approached mile 63 of the winding road 8,200 feet
above sea level, a dozen gunmen emerged from the trees and opened
fire, some with M-16 automatic rifles. Three teachers were shot dead,
two Americans and an Indonesian. Another 11 people were wounded,
including seven Americans, mine company officials said. One of the
injured was a 6-year-old girl.</LD>
<LD>   It was the bloodiest assault on U.S. citizens in Indonesia since
the country gained independence 53 years ago, historians here said.
But on Monday, as Indonesian officials offered further details of the
attack, who was responsible remained a mystery.</LD>
<TE>   Indonesian authorities blamed the ambush on the Free Papua
Movement, a group of poorly armed Papuan separatists who have waged a
low-level campaign for independence for the last four decades. The
rebel organization denied responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Rights activists and independence leaders in Papua, on the western
half of the island of New Guinea, insisted Monday that it was
unlikely the guerrilla group staged the attack and questioned whether
the military itself shot the travelers to justify a crackdown on
indigenous Papuans.</TE>
<TE>   "It is becoming more and more evident that the Indonesian security
forces are involved in creating provocations and instigating
violence," the pro-independence Papua Presidium Council said in a
statement. "The killing of foreign nationals has never been the
policy of Papuans promoting their political aspirations."</TE>
<TE>   Details of the attack still remained sketchy. Most of the wounded,
who were flown to Australia for medical care, were kept from
reporters. Mine company officials said the survivors never saw their
attackers.</TE>
<TE>   Police and soldiers were pursuing the gunmen Monday after
exchanging fire with them the day before, killing one, authorities
said. Papua Police Chief Made M. Pastika said the dead man dressed
and looked like a rebel fighter, with a beard and long curly hair.</TE>
<TE>   "He is from the separatist movement," Pastika said. "They call
themselves the liberation army of the Free Papua Movement. But we
don't know his name yet, because we could not find any
identification."</TE>
<TE>   Pastika acknowledged that it would have been "very difficult" for
rebels to evade security in the area and reach the road where the
ambush occurred, just four miles from the town of Tembagapura, which
is home to many mine employees. Thick fog may have helped conceal the
assailants' movements, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The gunmen appeared to have chosen their victims at random, the
police chief said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are just ordinary people, so this was not a specific
target," he said. "It seems that they just wanted to attack anyone
and create the impression that it is not a safe place."</TE>
<TE>   The two 8-seat Land Cruisers, which carried all the Americans and
at least one Indonesian, were hit first by the gunshots at about
12:40 p.m., he said.</TE>
<TE>   When the truck drivers reached the same spot minutes later, they
saw that something was wrong with the two vehicles. They approached
thinking that there had been an accident, and the gunmen opened fire
on them. Authorities say 10 to 15 men took part in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   All three of those killed were traveling in the Toyotas.
Indonesian officials identified the two dead American teachers as Ted
Burgon and Rickey Spear, although the spelling of their names could
not be confirmed and their hometowns were not made public. The slain
Indonesian teacher was identified as Bambang Riswanto.</TE>
<TE>   The three taught at an international school for the children of
employees of the Freeport mine, which is owned by Freeport-McMoRan
Copper &amp; Gold Inc. of New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Many Papuans see the mine as a symbol of how foreigners collude
with the Indonesian government and exploit the province's wealth,
leaving little for the native people.</TE>
<TE>   In the five decades since Indonesia became a nation, Saturday's
ambush was the most violent attack on Americans, said Ikrar Nusa
Bakti, head of the Center for Political Studies at the Indonesian
Institute of Sciences in Jakarta, the capital. Political leaders have
sometimes espoused anti-American views, but U.S. citizens have not
been targeted for killing.</TE>
<TE>   The idea that soldiers could pose as rebels and attack civilians
might seem implausible in other countries, but the Indonesian army's
track record prompted immediate speculation that it was responsible.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the military organized militia gangs in East Timor, then
an Indonesian province, to intimidate supporters of independence.
When the East Timorese voted in a referendum to break away, the
militias slaughtered 1,000 people and razed much of the province.</TE>
<TE>   Last November, Papuan independence leader Theys Eluay, the
chairman of the Papua Presidium Council, was abducted and slain.
Twelve members of the army's elite special forces branch, Kopassus,
have been accused of killing him and may soon face trial.</TE>

<HD>Russia Not in Favor of Iraq Attack</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Foreign minister, meeting with Baghdad
counterpart, urges more inspections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Russia added its voice Monday to a growing international chorus
warning against a U.S. attack on Iraq, saying such action could
undermine peace efforts in the Middle East and long-term security in
the volatile Persian Gulf region.</LD>
<LD>   In talks with his visiting Iraqi counterpart, Russian Foreign
Minister Igor S. Ivanov also urged Baghdad to allow resumption of
U.N. weapons inspections so that the trade sanctions that have
impoverished Iraq can be lifted.</LD>
<LD>   "The international community must have guarantees of nonresumption
of Iraqi programs of development of weapons of mass destruction,"
Ivanov told journalists at a joint news conference with Foreign
Minister Naji Sabri.</LD>
<TE>   "We believe it is a necessary condition for the settlement of the
situation and the lifting of sanctions against Iraq," Ivanov added,
noting that Russian companies were poised to help the Iraqis rebuild
their oil industry once the crisis is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Sabri insisted that the weapons inspections suspended nearly four
years ago were "only one element" of the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   He said his country must also be compensated for the "1991
aggression"--the Persian Gulf War destruction that left the economy
and infrastructure in ruins after a U.S.-led coalition expelled Iraqi
forces from Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   In South Africa, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz said
Monday that Baghdad had not ruled out a return of the
inspectors--though a day earlier during an interview with CNN he had
called such a step "a nonstarter."</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer later dismissed
suggestions that Aziz's comments represented a shift in Iraqi policy.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq changes positions on whether they'll let the inspectors in
more often than [Iraqi President] Saddam Hussein changes bunkers,"
Fleischer told reporters aboard Air Force One as President Bush flew
to Pittsburgh for a Labor Day appearance.</TE>
<TE>   While Ivanov pushed his guest to clear the way for resumed
inspections, he was equally adamant that a nonmilitary solution be
found to defuse tensions between Baghdad and Washington. Bush has
threatened to attack Iraq in punishment for its alleged development
of biological, chemical or nuclear weapons and has declared that he
wants to see an Iraqi "regime change"--the removal of Hussein from
power.</TE>
<TE>   "There are great and sufficient opportunities for finding a
political settlement of the situation around Iraq," Ivanov said. "Any
solutions with the use of force would not only further complicate an
Iraqi settlement but would seriously undermine the already difficult
situation in the Persian Gulf and in the Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Moscow would veto any U.N. resolution authorizing
invasion of Iraq if Baghdad continues to block the inspections,
Ivanov gave a noncommittal answer.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope that the question of use of force will not be put to the
Security Council and, therefore, the right of veto will not be
necessary," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Moscow's motivation in appealing for a political resolution is
probably based in large part on economic interests, as Russia is
already Iraq's biggest trading partner and has been negotiating a
deal in anticipation of eased sanctions that could be worth as much
as $40 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But as the Russian appeal for diplomacy coincides with an apparent
rift within the White House, as well as between the U.S. and most
North Atlantic Treaty Organization states, the position taken by
Moscow could further weaken the Bush administration's resolve to go
it alone in striking Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush has characterized a potential strike against Iraq as
an extension of the war against global terrorism, most European
allies have urged Washington to take its case first to the Security
Council. French President Jacques Chirac and, in particular, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder have opposed unilateral U.S. action.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, differences of opinion became clear even within
the administration, with Vice President Dick Cheney having insisted
that an attack is necessary regardless of whether weapons inspections
are resumed and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell saying the White
House would regard new inspections as a step in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   Sabri is one of several senior Iraqis dispatched by Hussein to
lobby permanent members of the U.N. Security Council against the U.S.
threat of force.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi foreign minister elicited similar support from Chinese
leaders in Beijing last week and is scheduled to head next for an
Arab League gathering in Cairo, where he is expected to find
additional backing.</TE>
<TE>   Sabri and Ivanov discussed Washington's recent intimations that an
attack on Iraq is necessary to spare Western countries from a nuclear
or biological weapons strike.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not found a single solid argument in those statements to
the effect that Iraq poses a threat to U.S. national security,"
Ivanov said. "These statements are political."</TE>
<TE>   Both Ivanov and Sabri presented their talks as friendly and
constructive, despite a meeting last week between a senior Russian
official in Washington and a visiting delegation of Iraqi opposition
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not opposition as such, but people who are working in the
interests of the U.S. and British secret services," Sabri said. As to
the influence of last week's meeting on ties with Moscow, he said,
"this matter has no effect on the depth of our relationship and
prospects for its developing."</TE>
<TE>   Ivanov also made little of the Washington contact, calling it "an
ordinary event" without meaning for Moscow's relations with Baghdad.</TE>

<HD>World Summit Reaches Pact to Sustain Planet</HD>
<DH>Environment: Details of consensus plan fail to please many
activists. But an assistant secretary of State describes it as 'a
real breakthrough.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa</DL>
<LD>After days of nearly round-the-clock discussions, bleary-eyed
negotiators at an international summit here reached agreement Monday
night on a broad plan to bring clean water, sanitation and energy to
the world's poor without further degrading the planet.</LD>
<LD>   The hard-won consensus plan, which has decidedly weaker language
than many delegates and environmentalists had hoped on increasing the
use of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, is
expected to be ratified today or Wednesday by more than 100 heads of
state or government assembled at the World Summit on Sustainable
Development.</LD>
<LD>   Although the final draft of the plan was not expected to be
released until today, its more than 70 pages contain dozens of
initiatives that aim to do everything from removing trade barriers
that burden the struggling economies of Third World nations to
restoring the oceans' depleted fish stocks and reducing by half the 2
billion people who lack access to basic sanitation.</LD>
<TE>   "We've made a real breakthrough with a plan of action,'' said John
Turner, an assistant secretary of State who headed the U.S. team of
negotiators. "We have moved forward on the fisheries issue, on
land-based sources of pollution. We've made some real steps toward
preserving biodiversity."</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Beckett, head of the British delegation, called the deal
"a victory for everybody who wants to put sustainable development at
the heart of everything we do."</TE>
<TE>   However, a number of environmental groups expressed disappointment
at details emerging from the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't seem to be making progress. We seem to be backsliding,"
said Michael Strauss, a spokesman for a coalition of environmental
and activist groups.</TE>
<TE>   The real measure of success for the plan, which is strictly
voluntary, will be actions taken in the years ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-day summit in Johannesburg was set up to implement
environmental promises made a decade ago by the Earth Summit in Rio
de Janeiro.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Rio summit has been credited with sharpening the
world's focus on environmental issues, few of those goals have been
accomplished in the intervening years.</TE>
<TE>   So the United Nations decided to bring world leaders here to forge
an implementation plan that would set specific steps to follow toward
Rio's twin aims of reducing poverty and preserving the environment.</TE>
<TE>   The late-night breakthrough Monday came after a raucous day of
debate and protest that included police dispersing pro-Palestinian
demonstrators with a water cannon and Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe lashing out at critics of his program to seize white-owned
farms.</TE>
<TE>   In defending his land redistribution system, Mugabe said the issue
has "pitted the black majority, who are the right holders and primary
stakeholders to the land, against an obdurate and internationally
well-connected racial minority, largely of British descent and
brought in and sustained by British colonialism--now supported by the
Blair government." British Prime Minister Tony Blair declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Mugabe Assails U.N.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing leaders from around the globe, Mugabe then took aim at
the summit's host, the United Nations, calling it an "outdated"
institution used to "dominate the world for the strategic national
goals of the rich north," a reference to the industrialized Northern
Hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   The battle between rich nations of the north and poor nations in
the south has dominated the talks here on the environment and
development. It surfaced again and again in the five-minute addresses
made by a parade of national leaders who took the podium.</TE>
<TE>   As often as not, speakers bashed the United States as the world's
richest nation and biggest polluter, responsible for about 25% of
emissions of globe-warming gases.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration continued to take heat for pulling out of
the 1997 international agreement signed in Kyoto, Japan, to reduce
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases responsible for global
climate change.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is no longer the time for an 'every country for itself'
attitude," scolded French President Jacques Chirac.</TE>
<TE>   Saufatu Sopoanga, prime minister of Tuvalu, pleaded for the
survival of his tiny South Pacific island nation, which is being
washed away by rising sea levels and severe storms that scientists
attribute to increasing global temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   "We want our islands to exist forever and ever and not become
submerged under water merely due to the selfishness and greed of the
industrialized world," Sopoanga said.</TE>
<TE>   He called for binding commitments to reducing emissions of fossil
fuels.</TE>
<TE>   But the new plan does little to advance the cause of reducing
emissions from burning fossil fuels. The language falls short of what
was sought by many nations to promote the Kyoto Protocol for curbing
emissions, or even to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.</TE>
<TE>   One of the final sticking points, which was resolved Monday, was
the fight over establishing specific goals and timetables to increase
the world's reliance on alternative energy--such as solar or wind
power or small hydroelectric plants.</TE>
<TE>   The European Union was pushing for a worldwide pledge that 15% of
all energy would be from these renewable sources by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and some oil-producing countries were opposed to any
specific percentages or timetables. The American delegation was
worried about what this might cost the U.S., which now gets 11% of
its energy from renewable sources--and most of that from large
hydroelectric plants that some critics consider not "green" enough to
qualify.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the U.S. and oil-producing allies seemed to wear down
their opponents. The compromise language in the plan does not set any
specific target for increasing the use of renewable energy.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it says that nations, "with a sense of urgency," should
substantially increase the global share of renewable energy.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the final piece," said Lowell Flanders, a senior U.N.
official tracking the negotiations. "They have a deal in all of the
paragraphs. Basically, it's done."</TE>
<TE>   An unidentified Canadian official told Reuters news service that
his delegation still hoped to reopen negotiations on women's
reproductive health.</TE>
<TE>   "With the exception of the one issue that Canada is going to raise
on human rights, the negotiations are over," the Canadian official
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Turner, the American assistant secretary of State, described
the Canadians' issue as one that raised a procedural question: Can
the text in a paragraph that was agreed upon months ago be reopened
for amendment? He didn't think it would be. "The world community has
focused on a positive path here," Turner said, "and doesn't want to
get consumed with issues that engaged a great deal of passion and
distractions."</TE>
<TE>   When the plan is compiled and made available for the world to
scrutinize, a number of environmental groups are certain to be
disappointed because negotiators failed to go as far as they wanted
them to on issues such as adopting an environmental code of
responsibility for corporations and making sure government subsidies
do not lead to environmental damage.</TE>
<TE>   Powell Due Today</TE>
<TE>   President Bush decided not to attend the Johannesburg gathering
and to send Secretary of State Colin L. Powell instead for the final
two days of the summit. To soften criticism of the president's
conspicuous absence, administration officials have been announcing a
series of partnerships and programs to bring food, water and energy
to impoverished nations and help preserve the rain forest in the
Congo Basin.</TE>
<TE>   Kofi Annan, secretary-general of the United Nations, opened
Monday's session with a call for world leaders to take responsibility
for the poor, for the planet and for the future.</TE>
<TE>   "Not far from this conference room--in Lesotho, Malawi,
Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe--13 million people are
threatened with famine," Annan said. "If any reminder were needed of
what happens when we fail to plan for and protect the long-term
future of our planet, it can be heard in the cries for help from
those 13 million people."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the emerging famine is blamed on severe drought. But
Mugabe has complicated matters by evicting hundreds of white farmers
from their land at a time when Zimbabwe desperately needs food.
Instead of ending up in the hands of landless blacks, some of the
farms reportedly have been doled out to reward Mugabe's friends and
loyal military officers.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of other nations in the British Commonwealth have
criticized Mugabe's actions, one likening them to "ethnic cleansing."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Agency for International Development officials have called it

<HD>Koreas' Typhoon Toll Rises</HD>
<DH>Disaster: As authorities in the South confirm 138 deaths,
the North says scores were killed. Damage estimate is put at nearly
$735 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>As the skies cleared over the Korean peninsula Monday, helicopters
swooped low over large swaths of the countryside entombed in mud and
found devastation from a weekend typhoon far greater than originally
believed.</LD>
<LD>   South Korean authorities raised the toll to 138 dead and 77
missing, while the first word filtered down from secretive North
Korea that it had not been spared. Although there were apparently
fewer casualties in the North, Typhoon Rusa seems to have complicated
the Communist country's already precarious food situation.</LD>
<LD>   "The typhoon left scores of people dead, many missing," North
Korea's official Korean Central News Agency reported Monday. "A large
area of farmland went underwater or was washed away, making it hard
to expect any harvest or crops from there."</LD>
<TE>   In South Korea, the brunt of the storm hit Kangnung, a resort on
the east coast squeezed between mountains and the sea. Nearly 3 feet
of rain fell Saturday and Sunday, triggering flooding and large
landslides. Most of the victims were buried alive in the mud or swept
away by the rushing waters.</TE>
<TE>   "The water's come up to my chest" were the last words that the
manager of an agricultural cooperative, Lee Sang Guk, 51, said to his
wife over a mobile telephone as he was out inspecting flood damage.
His body was found 22 hours later floating down a nearby stream,
South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported.</TE>
<TE>   Television footage shot from helicopters showed red-tiled roofs
peeking out from a sea of mud. Bridges, railroads and highway
overpasses had been wrenched into pieces by winds of up to 127 mph. A
man navigated his way with a pole through the flood waters on a piece
of Styrofoam as though it were a gondola.</TE>
<TE>   The rains washed away graves at a hillside cemetery near Kangnung.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother's grave--where has it gone?" cried Choi Young Cha, an
elderly woman interviewed by the Korea Broadcasting System.</TE>
<TE>   Across the peninsula in Geumsan, a small city known for its
ginseng production, large quantities of the precious medicinal root
were ruined by flooding. Meticulously cultivated rice paddies
throughout the country also were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   The overall damage was estimated by the National Disaster
Prevention and Countermeasures Headquarters at nearly $735 million,
although insurers said it would take at least a week to come up with
a reliable assessment.</TE>
<TE>   Major television networks and newspapers launched fund-raising
drives to help the victims.</TE>
<TE>   Before hitting the peninsula, Typhoon Rusa--the Malay word for
"deer"--swept over the Japanese island of Okinawa. Two U.S. Marines,
Lance Cpl. Richard Moore, 24, and Lance Cpl. Beatriz Rodriguez, 20,
were reported missing Friday night from a beach on the island and are
presumed dead.</TE>
<TE>   Rusa was the deadliest typhoon to hit the Korean peninsula since
1987, when Typhoon Thelma claimed 345 lives. But South Korean
meteorologists said this latest typhoon was more powerful. Older
Koreans still reminisce about the worst typhoon of modern times,
Sarah, which killed more than 800 people in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   Building standards are far better in flood-prone South Korea than
they were when the country was rapidly developing in the years after
the 1950-53 Korean War. But the high toll of casualties and property
loss from Typhoon Rusa is likely to fuel demands to improve the
quality of the infrastructure to better withstand storms. South
Korea's relative wealth and modernity make the extent of the
devastation surprising.</TE>
<TE>   According to statistics released Monday, the storm washed away 274
bridges, severed railways and roads in 174 locations, knocked down
10,000 electricity poles and flooded more than 17,000 homes.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday night, more than 1 million people remained without
electricity and nearly 500,000 had no drinking water. The South
Korean military was mobilized to distribute bottled water, bread,
blankets and instant noodles to victims in isolated areas by
helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   This year's monsoon season has been particularly deadly throughout
Asia, with rain-related disasters taking a total of more than 2,000
lives in China and India. Another typhoon, known as Sinlaku after an
Indonesian goddess, is reported to be heading toward the Korean
peninsula and is expected to arrive later this week.</TE>

which is usually to be able to register for classes before anyone
else. They have first choice for the classes and times that fit their
busy athletic and partying schedules.</LD>
<LD>   If they were actually interested in their own education,
nongraduation would not be a problem. Sloan states that athletes
learn discipline; clearly that is not the case.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Burdening Kids With Innocence," Commentary, Aug. 28:</LD>
<LD>   As a mother of four now-grown children, I was astonished and
disgusted by professor Jerry Griswold's attempt to place the blame
for pedophile killers not only on the "innocent" victims for being
what they are (powerless, weak, dependent) but also on society for
its natural desire to shelter its offspring from evil. And evil is
what we are dealing with--pedophiles who take advantage of a smaller,
weaker being to gratify desires that they either cannot or will not
control.</LD>
<LD>   When that lust is satisfied, the defenseless child is "silenced"
because deep down, the killer knows that society abhors his behavior.</LD>
<TE>   To say that the pedophile is "disappointed" because "innocence"
was destroyed by the perpetrator's very own actions is utter
nonsense. How can parents protect their children when this kind of
balderdash is considered serious scholarship by our universities and
printed in our "serious" media? I wonder what Griswold would write if
the body of his daughter or son was just dug up from under a concrete
slab.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Biggar</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I thank Griswold for his commentary. I would also add that,
insofar as Jean Jacques Rousseau is concerned, the role of educator
is not pleasant.</TE>
<TE>   Rousseau, like Plato before him, identified as our primary goal
the suppression of anger. Anger can be legitimate, as when Jesus
cursed the fig tree that bore no fruit (in other words, it wasn't
doing its job).</TE>
<TE>   Society will no doubt continue to market children, but we must all
do our best to make sure that we look after the best interests of the
individual children with whose care we have been entrusted.</TE>

<LD>We know that there is something wrong in the world when a teenager
can't enjoy a soda during lunch ("Schools to End Soda Sales," Aug.
28). As a high school student I know firsthand how many students are
overweight, but it isn't because they have been consuming too much
sugar; it's because they are lazy and don't get enough exercise.</LD>
<LD>   No matter how healthy a diet is, a person can't be healthy without
an appropriate amount of exercise. Instead of keeping students from
having a soda, these people should be trying to get students more
involved in physical activity, encouraging sports and offering
discounts at gyms.</LD>
<LD>   Students will find a way to get their sugar and caffeine fix
elsewhere, and I am 100% sure that overweight students will not
suddenly become lean, athletic and perfect examples of fitness. They
will just hate school a little bit more.</LD>
<TE>   I'm just relieved my school is in La Habra, where it seems common
sense is a bit more common.</TE>

<LD>With all the talk of possible biochemical and nuclear threats against

<LD>   I grew up in WWII England, and everyone knew exactly what to do
when the bombers were on their way. The sirens gave us the first
warning. The government supplied gas masks for every man, woman and
child. We all knew our local air raid shelter. Our parents knew
exactly what to do in a blackout.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, the present situation is much different from those days,
but it is potentially more devastating. What is the U.S. government
doing to prepare its populace in case such a horror occurs? Why have
no guidelines been given to us? Large cities, such as Los Angeles,
should especially have plans for their citizens. The way things
stand, I foresee only chaos.</LD>

<LD>The same-day registration proposed by Richard Riordan and Antonio
Villaraigosa (Commentary, Aug. 29) isn't going to solve the problem
of the steady decline in voter participation in California.
Politicians need to give voters more credit for no longer going to
the polls.</LD>
<LD>   Frankly, voters are fed up. They are fed up by mediocre candidates
whom the leaders of the state Senate and Assembly knight for
election, enabling them to get the lion's share of special-interest
money. They are fed up by redistricting, which has all but ruled out
competitive races in the state and nation.</LD>
<LD>   They are fed up with candidates who are beholden to special
interests that got them elected. They are fed up by elected officials
who are more concerned about advancing to offices with no term
limits, so they spend their time dialing for dollars. They are fed up
with legislators who skirt campaign laws. And they are fed up by the
actions of politicians that have brought this state to the brink of
bankruptcy after a very healthy surplus.</LD>
<TE>   Anthony R. Fellow PhD</TE>
<TE>   Professor of Media and Politics, Cal State Fullerton</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Despite what Riordan and Villaraigosa say, Proposition 52 is a bad
idea. Can we truly trust there will be no fraud when we allow
same-day registration and voting with only a driver's license needed
for identification? Especially in light of our state government
proposal to grant driver's licenses to illegal aliens.</TE>
<TE>   The reason why voter turnout is low and continually falling is
because people don't feel their votes count. Sadly, the feeling is
our political leaders will always follow the money and will always
act in the best interests of their major campaign contributors. We
have seen initiatives pass with overwhelming support only to be
blocked by opponents who take the measure to court the day after the
election.</TE>
<TE>   Until integrity can be reinstalled into the political system,
voter turnout will continue to fall.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Burgess</TE>
<TE>   Reseda</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Extrapolating from Riordan and Villaraigosa's case in support of
Proposition 52, the failure of eligible people to register to vote is
a serious, if not major, reason for lack of participation in
California elections. Maybe the inclusion of all those people who, on
election day, say, "Gee, I'd love to vote if I had only remembered to
re-register when I moved to Encino," would add more concerned
citizens to the process. Maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   But one thing's clear: Arguing about the mechanical aspects of
voting is a lot easier than trying to do something about the patently
adverse effect of ubiquitous campaign ads telling us not to vote for
the candidate's opponent because, well, he or she is such a slimy,
untrustworthy person. You want more participation? Tell us not how we
can vote but why we should.</TE>
<TE>   Edward M. Young</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Our voter registration system needs an all-around reform movement
to boost voter participation. Proposition 52 is a step in the right
direction in reviving the current system, dominated by insiders who
exploit the citizens' nonparticipation to pass policies that preserve
their status quo.</TE>
<TE>   Our society is divided between two types of people in politics:
those who, like Riordan and Villaraigosa, want a stronger,
more-educated community in which voting is a must and those who want
a community in which limiting voter participation is a must. Let's
say yes to Proposition 52 on Nov. 5.</TE>

<LD>The U.N. has authorized inspections of Iraq to search for weapons of
mass destruction. We have some pretty good ideas about where to look.
Let's visit a suspicious place with a team of inspectors and Special
Forces soldiers to protect them. We drop in from the air and shoot
nobody unless shot at. We do a local inspection, and if the weapons
are found, we destroy them quickly and get out. Then we drop in on
another suspicious place. This is better than a mass invasion. When
hard evidence for weapons of mass destruction is found, we thereby
justify firmer action, including war if necessary.</LD>

<TE>   If the Arabs are truly sick of Western interference, then they
should police Hussein themselves, if for no other reason than that
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction pose a danger to them, and
allocate a desirable section of their more than 5 million collective
square miles as a new Palestinian homeland. Percentage-wise, this
would be a tiny sacrifice compared with Israel doing the same, and it
would place the Palestinians near neighbors sympathetic to their
cause.</TE>

<HD>Field Geology Training Remains Rigorous</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine my surprise to learn that my research specialty has died. In
reflecting on the passing of geologist J. David Love (obituary, Aug.
28), it was announced that he "was one of the last great field
researchers in a profession that has been largely given over to
laboratory geoscientists." According to former Wyoming legislator Tom
Stroock: "We are never going to see a field geologist like Dave
again. They just don't train them like that. Dave's specialty was out
in the field, walking the fault lines, walking the escarpments and
touching the rocks."</LD>
<LD>   The heartening reality is that, at least at Caltech, we persist in
training them precisely like that in our courses and in recent
graduate theses as long on boot leather as any study penned by Love
or other geologists of his era. A similar approach is embraced in the
geology curricula at USC, UCLA, Stanford and Berkeley. With the
exception of a few Ivy League schools that over the last several
decades have allowed their field programs to weaken, Love's approach
to science is alive and well as the intellectual basis for 21st
century teaching and research in the geological and planetary
sciences.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I am disappointed that The Times has argued against tax cuts, the one
policy prescription that will improve the economy ("Tax-Cut
Hemorrhage," editorial, Aug. 29). Reducing taxes increases the
incentive to earn more, thus generating faster and larger economic
growth. If anyone questions this theory, one only has to look to a
tax heaven such as Hong Kong, which has incredible economic growth,
and to tax-and-spend countries in Europe that have very, very low
economic growth.</LD>
<LD>   The last thing we need is tax increases, which will take more
money out of the economy and thus slow the recovery. What we need now
are responsible legislators who can reduce governmental spending
whenever tax receipts are low. But don't hold your breath on that
one.</LD>

<HD>2 Held in Kidnap of Boy, 9</HD>
<DH>Crime: Officers arrest the men on suspicion of taking Palm
Desert child and beating his father.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two men suspected in last week's Palm Desert kidnapping of a
9-year-old boy at the center of a custody fight have been arrested in
Escondido, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department said Monday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Rodrique Edgar Van Blake, 27, and Elias Gutierrez, 28, were taken
into custody Sunday afternoon at their Escondido homes, said
Sheriff's Deputy Lisa McConnell. Both were arrested on suspicion of
kidnapping, burglary and assault with a deadly weapon in Wednesday's
beating of Michael Farber, the father of Nicholas Farber, McConnell
said.</LD>
<LD>   "They are both believed to be the suspects who entered the house
and abducted Nicholas," McConnell said.</LD>
<TE>   McConnell said the men arrested Sunday work in the San Diego
County city, but no information was given on their relationship with
the boy's mother, Debra Rose, 38, the alleged mastermind of the
violent abduction.</TE>
<TE>   Rose and her ex-husband are fighting over custody of their son,
who lives with his father. Rose lives in Colorado Springs, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Few details were given by the department, which will release more
information today.</TE>
<TE>   Two men burst into the Farber home and Michael Farber was beaten
before Nicholas was taken away, police have said. A so-called Amber
alert was broadcast and a park ranger in San Diego County recognized
the license plate on a motor home in a private campground. The
missing boy was found inside and Rose was arrested, along with a man
believed to be her companion, Michael James Riley, 48.</TE>
<TE>   Rose and Riley are being held on suspicion of conspiracy to commit
kidnapping, conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly weapon and
conspiracy to commit residential burglary.</TE>
<TE>   The four suspects are being held in lieu of $1-million bail.</TE>

<KH>CATHEDRAL OF OUR LADY OF THE ANGELS</KH>
<HD>L.A. Cathedral Is Dedicated</HD>
<DH>Ceremony: During the four-hour service, Cardinal Roger M.
Mahony calls the downtown church an 'anchor for the ages.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels was dedicated Monday, amid
ancient prayers and pageantry, as a cathedral for the ages and a
house of prayer for all people.</LD>
<LD>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony led a procession through the cathedral's
massive bronze doors to a four-hour service steeped in Catholic
ritual dating to the 4th century. Three thousand invited guests
expressed their devotion, then watched a sacred dance--a modern
innovation in the Western church--and the traditional anointing of
the altar and the building with aromatic holy oil.</LD>
<LD>   The 12-story cathedral, built to stand at least 500 years, is the
first major American cathedral to be built in three decades. Its
dedication as the mother church of the nation's largest and most
ethnically diverse Roman Catholic archdiocese culminated eight years
of an effort led by Mahony to build a monumental cathedral that he
vowed would be worthy of the City of Angels.</LD>
<TE>   "At long last, there is a noble great church at the heart of Los
Angeles," Mahony declared as sunlight, distilled to a phosphorous
essence by towering windows of Spanish alabaster, streamed into the
cavernous nave.</TE>
<TE>   He ended with a shimmering vision of a 21st century cathedral,
rooted in 18th century California history, committed to building a
just and inclusive community in the state's "most diverse and
decidedly most global city."</TE>
<TE>   "From this day forward," he proclaimed, "the stones of this
building will sing, echoes rolling down the ages, telling of love and
justice through the lives of all who come and go from this house of
prayer for all people."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony called the church an "anchor for the ages."</TE>
<TE>   The dedication liturgy on an unusually hot and humid day was
witnessed by a personal representative of Pope John Paul II, the
Vatican's ambassador to the U.S., 11 other U.S. cardinals and nearly
a thousand bishops, priests and deacons in vestments of matching hues
of white and adobe.</TE>
<TE>   Also present were more than 1,300 donors and parishioners, many of
them among the city's most prominent business, civic and
entertainment figures, as well as the Spanish architect, Jose Rafael
Moneo, who designed the cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   It was a moment of triumph and celebration for the church, which
for the last eight months has been shaken by local and national
scandals over the alleged sexual abuse of minors by priests and
bishops. For downtown business interests and civic leaders, Monday
marked a signal achievement in attempts to bring a new vibrancy to
the heart of the city.</TE>
<TE>   And for many of the Los Angeles archdiocese's 5 million Catholics
who never ventured to the old St. Vibiana's Cathedral, which
languished on the edge of skid row, the day marked an introduction to
their first mother church.</TE>
<TE>   St. Vibiana's, a Spanish Baroque building at the long-faded corner
of 2nd and Main streets, was severely damaged in the 1994 Northridge
earthquake. It has been sold by the archdiocese, and there are plans
to convert it into a center for the performing arts.</TE>
<TE>   The design of the Moneo cathedral--which, at 333 feet in length,
was designed to be a foot longer than St. Patrick's Cathedral in New
York--has drawn both praise and criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Its soaring angular rooflines and feathered concrete walls suggest
angels' wings in the abstract for some. Others have complained that
the monumental building's austerity and untraditional design are cold
and uninspiring.</TE>
<TE>   Demonstrators were on hand Monday to underscore their
long-standing criticism of the $189.5-million cost of the cathedral
and conference center in view of the ever-present needs of the poor
and marginalized. One sign proclaimed, "No Fat Cat Cathedral."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony announced at the end of Monday's service that the cathedral
complex had been "fully funded" by cash receipts and pledges.</TE>
<TE>   The $189.5-million "final cost" figure was also released Monday by
the archdiocese. Earlier estimates had put the cost at $200 million.</TE>
<TE>   There were also demonstrators who supported the cathedral. "We are
praying for you," a sign said. Still others used the occasion to
remind the archdiocese of the sexual abuse scandal, in which more
than 250 priests nationwide have resigned or been dismissed and
scores of bishops have been criticized for lax oversight. A large
papier-mache effigy of Mahony held a sign that read, "Suffer the
little children."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony made no reference to the scandal in his homily, although he
spoke in general terms about the redemption of sinners and the
transforming effect of God's word.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony has said in interviews that the cathedral will stand, as
cathedrals have through the ages, as a beacon of righteousness and
God's love even in the face of scandal and disappointment in the
church.</TE>
<TE>   Among the cardinals present were two whose resignations have been
demanded by many in their archdioceses--Bernard Law of Boston and
Edward M. Egan of New York. Mahony has been critical of Law in the
past, but an archdiocese spokesman said it is customary to invite all
American cardinals to such an event.</TE>
<TE>   But those controversies appeared to recede, at least for the
moment, during the dedication.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to feel I'm part of many centuries of devotion,"
Ernesto Vega, director of Guadalupe House in East Los Angeles, said
before the procession. Guadalupe House counsels Latino candidates for
the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to pray for those who come after me. Our mission is to
pray for the church in L.A., to pray for future generations," Vega
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was a day of firsts: the first procession into the cathedral,
the first blessing of the baptistery, the first time the cardinal
officially sat in his cathedra, or throne, and the first time the
altar was kissed.</TE>
<TE>   It was also the first time the cathedral's 6,019-pipe organ was
played during a Mass, the first time the Eucharist was celebrated
there and the first time the perpetual sanctuary candle was lighted
in the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, signifying the presence of the
consecrated bread and wine, which Catholics believe is the body and
blood of Jesus Christ.</TE>
<TE>   The organ swelled with Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" as the procession
passed through the bronze doors. Up the long ambulatory they
proceeded--men and women, rich and poor, the city's sung and unsung.
Their footsteps fell on newly polished stones of Spanish limestone.
They passed the Blessed Sacrament Chapel. They passed the Chapel of
Our Lady of the Angels. They reached a restored 17th century Spanish
Baroque Retablo, the gold-leafed backdrop of a forgotten altar. They
turned right, then right again to behold a soaring nave with gentle
natural light streaming through the alabaster windows. They filled
the pews.</TE>
<TE>   "Christus vincit (Christ has conquered)," they proclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   "Christus regnat (Christ reigns)."</TE>
<TE>   "Christus imperat (Christ is supreme)."</TE>
<TE>   A climatic moment came midway through the service, when the
building was liturgically transformed into a cathedral. What had,
according to tradition, been a mere building, was made holy in the
next few minutes as Mahony, wearing a linen apron tied with cardinal
red apron strings, liberally poured aromatic chrism--holy oil--on the
square, seven-ton, burgundy-colored altar of Turkish marble that he
designed. He then spent several minutes spreading the oil over the
surface with his bare palm.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, five Los Angeles auxiliary bishops and the
archdiocese's vicar general fanned out through the congregation with
bowls of holy oil and stained the cathedral walls, tracing three-foot
high crosses beneath 12 bronze and silver angels as a sign of
baptism. The stains are expected to be noticeable for months, if not
years.</TE>
<TE>   In another dramatic moment, thick plumes of incense smoke billowed
from a large basin set on the altar and rose almost 10 stories to the
cathedral's wood ceiling as a sign of prayers going to heaven.</TE>
<TE>   Next, 12 sacred dancers--diminutive Vietnamese nuns in navy blue
and white habits--gracefully glided around the altar and through the
cathedral with uplifted bowls of burning incense. The dance by the
Vietnamese Lovers of the Holy Cross filled the cathedral with the
sweet scent of chrism.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said the cathedral, resting on the heritage of the Spanish
missions built along El Camino Real by 18th century Franciscans, was
a milestone on a spiritual road to God and community.</TE>
<TE>   "Today," Mahony declared in his homily, which he read from a
TelePrompTer, "the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels joins the
storied ranks of the early missions, the first permanent structures
built across the California landscape.</TE>
<TE>   "It sinks its foundations in the very heart of the City of Los
Angeles, astride today's El Camino Real--today's less colorfully
named Hollywood Freeway--where it will stand and soar for many
centuries as a sign of God's enduring presence in our lives and
community."</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of those who have criticized the archdiocese for spending
so much on a new cathedral, Mahony said the cathedral would stand as
a champion for justice and a unifier in the secular city.</TE>
<TE>   His homily was replete with appeals for "a more humane and just
city." He spoke of "the longings of our larger city" and "links
across social classes." He called for "cooperative living." He said
the cathedral plaza should be a place where "the poor and rich
mingle."</TE>
<TE>   "God's word always calls us to move beyond our fears and
limitations, to take risks that will fashion us more and more into
God's image," Mahony said. "Anyone who comes here should continue on
their journey with a replenished spirit of respect for all other
peoples--in a special way, rendering thanks for the gift of ethnic
diversity in this great urban center. No traces of discrimination or
racism are to be found in this space. God's temple is a house for all
peoples."</TE>
<TE>   It was a theme repeated by Pope John Paul in a letter read by his
envoy, Vatican Cardinal James F. Stafford. "May this cathedral always
remain an eloquent symbol of communion and fraternity, of mutual
respect and understanding," the pope wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony sounded a note of caution, lest the archdiocese become
caught up with the cathedral, but not its meaning.</TE>
<TE>   "Is all this splendor and architectural artistry enough for us?"
he asked. "Can we rest content with the beauty arising from this
spot? We must answer an emphatic 'No!' Not as a kind of cultural
treasure was the cathedral built. As a vibrant symbol of God's
habitat in our city, this outer form must find an echo in the inner
graces of a people who listen intently to God's word, as it comes to
us as challenge and consolation," he declared.</TE>

<HD>Asian Workers Flex Their Union Muscles</HD>
<DH>Labor: Employees are organizing, despite the stance of some
Asian business owners, who urge them to show ethnic solidarity.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Chinese Daily News threatened pay cuts in what it called
salary reconstruction, employees' frustration erupted into the
unexpected: the formation of a union.</LD>
<LD>   The move pleased the AFL-CIO. And to the union federation it was
evidence that its efforts to lure Asian Americans are paying off.</LD>
<LD>   Even more surprising are recent efforts by Asian American workers
to organize in defiance of Asian bosses.</LD>
<TE>   In Los Angeles and Orange counties, there are at least six union
campaigns led by Asian American workers--two of them involving
Asian-owned businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "With Asian labor organizing, we're definitely on a major
upswing," said Quynh Nguyen, organizing director of the Asian Pacific
American Labor Alliance. "L.A. is a sign of what's to come. L.A. is
considered on the cutting edge of organizing."</TE>
<TE>   Since organizing under the AFL-CIO a decade ago, the alliance's
training efforts have increased the number of Asian American
organizers within the AFL-CIO from fewer than 10 to more than 100
nationwide. The organization has also been bolstered by AFL-CIO
President John Sweeney's calls on the union to reach out to immigrant
workers.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance "doesn't have the same resources and capacity as
other organizations, but it has been extremely effective at training
and recruiting," said Kent Wong, director of the UCLA Center for
Labor Research and Education and the alliance's first president.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a huge breakthrough for Asian American workers," Wong
said.</TE>
<TE>   About 12% of Asian American workers belong to unions nationwide, a
figure that has remained fairly steady in the last decade. Overall,
13.5% of American workers belong to unions, down from about 20% in
the early 1980s, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor.</TE>
<TE>   The formation last year of an Asian Pacific Islander Caucus in the
state Assembly has brought more visibility to the Asian American
labor movement.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Assemblywoman Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park) joined by members
of the Labor Committee and the Asian Pacific Islander Caucus, heard
testimony from mostly Asian immigrant employees about exploitation in
the workplace. The hearing produced a report by the UCLA labor center
and the alliance and could result in legislation next year, said
Denise Ng, a field representative for Chu's office.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the first of its kind," Ng said of the meeting. "People
came from all over the state to testify, and they waited for hours to
speak." Chu and her team are planning a similar hearing in the Bay
Area by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the alliance organized a town hall meeting of Asian
Pacific Islander working families, which featured workers'
testimonies and pledges by Chu and Assemblywomen Carol Liu (D-La
Canada Flintridge) and Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles) to support the
Asian American labor efforts, partly through better enforcement of
labor laws.</TE>
<TE>   Although there's a history of Asian American unionizing, including
that of Chinese railroad workers and Japanese and Filipino farm
workers, such efforts historically have not been as consistent or as
widely known as those by blacks and Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   And they rarely emerged within Asian-owned business, primarily
because of the loyalty many Asian Americans have felt to friends and
relatives who hired them, but also because racial discrimination has
prevented workers from finding work elsewhere, said L. Ling-chi Wang,
a professor of Asian American studies at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   But Asian American employers have also used this loyalty to
manipulate workers, urging employees not to fight with bosses to show
ethnic solidarity, said Katie Quan, a former seamstress who served
nine years as the Pacific Northwest head of the International Ladies
Garment Workers Union. "But when push comes to shove, workers really
understand that they have rights and that the boss is trying to
exploit them."</TE>
<TE>   Recent local struggles by Asian American workers have been fierce.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese Daily News, the largest Chinese-language paper in the
Los Angeles area, with a circulation of more than 100,000, refuses to
recognize its union. The management called last year's 78-63 vote
illegal and challenged the result with the National Labor Relations
Board in September after losing a regional decision. The paper said
vote results should be overturned because some supervisors supported
the union before the election.</TE>
<TE>   Lynne Wang, a Chinese Daily News reporter who has been the paper's
most vocal union supporter, said the opposite had occurred: A
supervisor had urged employees to vote against the union.</TE>
<TE>   NLRB guidelines say that the board should rule by Sept. 17, a year
after the case was appealed, but Bruce Meachum, a representative of
the Newspaper Guild, doesn't expect a decision soon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little strange and very unfair," Meachum said. "The
company uses this time to intimidate a lot of employees."</TE>
<TE>   But Steve Atkinson, a lawyer for the Chinese Daily News, said the
newspaper's workers are ignorant of the way American unions operate.
"That Asian community is not familiar with the way the [Communication
Workers of America] organizes," He said. "[Those] Asians were not
sophisticated enough to understand what they were being told was a
bunch of lies."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Gao, the business department manager at the paper, said
that, if a fair election were held, management would honor it.</TE>
<TE>   "If employees want a union, then that's good for them, let's have
a union," he said. But despite the outcome of the election, Gao
maintained that the conservative nature of Chinese workers, a
reluctance to speak up to superiors or rock the boat, makes it
difficult to tell if they're pro-or anti-union.</TE>
<TE>   Because unions in Asian countries do not resemble unions in the
United States, Quan and other labor experts said, Asian American
employers and employees can have skewed perceptions of American
labor.</TE>
<TE>   Unions in Taiwan, for example, have been heavily involved in
politics and some immigrants might assume that even a small union
here would play a similar role.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember trying to organize Taiwanese workers, and they were so
scared," said Quan, a labor policy specialist at UC Berkeley's Center
for Labor Research and Education. "They didn't want to be associated
with a political association."</TE>
<TE>   In Koreatown, the situation at Assi Plaza has grown so tense that
former workers have marched as many as eight hours a day since Aug.
1, urging a boycott of the market.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, 56 workers were forced off the job in what Assi's
office manger, Vincent Ju, called an unpaid "nondisciplinary leave of
absence" until the workers fixed a problem with Social Security
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Ju said the company's actions have "nothing to do with the union,"
but workers insisted the opposite. Ju countered that four workers
have been rehired.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of the workers involved at Assi Plaza are
Latino--only six are Korean--the picketing and union efforts have
been headed by the Korean Immigrant Workers Advocates, many of whose
members speak fluent Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   About 145 members of Assi's work force, which is roughly half
Korean and half Latino, voted last spring on whether to join the
fledgling Immigrant Workers Union. The election was too close to
call, and the case is before the NLRB.</TE>
<TE>   Though the union effort has been led by a Korean organization, a
former market employee, Chin Yol Yi, said the owners' race has
nothing to do with the organizing.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether they were Korean or any other race, if they had treated
us fairly for many years, the union issue would never have arisen in
Assi," Yi said through a translator.</TE>
<TE>   Yi is a member of the Immigrant Workers Union board and maintains
that he was fired in April because he was the only Korean employee
who was pictured on a flier urging support of the union. Management
said that Yi had given away several dollars' worth of sashimi to a
customer.</TE>
<TE>   The collaboration between Koreans and Latinos at Assi highlights
what many unionists hail as the future of labor organizing.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're united, we can obtain many things," one market employee,
Elodia Martinez, said in Spanish while taking a break from the picket
line outside the store. She carried a handmade sign with Korean
characters on one side and "Spanglish" on the other.</TE>
<TE>   Hopes for building such alliances were evident a few weeks ago
when Asian American and Latino workers crammed into East Los Angeles
College's student center for the alliance's meeting. They called for
unity in Chinese, Korean, Tagalog and Spanish. And Chu added to their
excitement when she shouted, "The bosses may have the money, but we
have the people, and we can win!"</TE>

<HD>13 Hurt as Car Rams Into Crowd</HD>
<DH>Newport Beach: Police are investigating why an elderly
driver's car lurched into pedestrians at the Balboa Ferry. Three are
hospitalized.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thirteen people, including a 1 1/2-year-old boy, were injured Monday
after an out-of-control car tore through a crowd at the Balboa Island
ferry pier in Newport Beach, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The three people most seriously hurt were taken to Western Medical
Center-Santa Ana with internal injuries and broken limbs. The driver,
Mary Anne Nash, 87, of Newport Beach, was shaken but otherwise not
hurt. She was placed in a police car for questioning.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said the auto was traveling 25 to 35 mph when it plowed
into people as they disembarked the ferry, scattering them like pins
struck by a bowling ball.</LD>
<TE>   People were screaming and sunglasses and beach towels went flying,
witnesses said. One person who fell into the water was pulled to
safety by strangers. A woman's handbag had to be pried out of the
car's grill.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in the group getting off the ferry when all of a sudden you
saw garbage cans and then people flying in the air," said Mark
DeAntonio of Costa Mesa, who was out for a bike ride. DeAntonio said
he jumped off his bicycle and leaped out of the way to avoid the car,
which stopped about 10 feet from him.</TE>
<TE>   The car came to a halt when its right tires dropped between a
pedestrian walkway and a vehicle ramp to the ferry. DeAntonio said
six to eight people were on the ground moaning in pain.</TE>
<TE>   Nash's car was second in line on Balboa Island, waiting for the
ferry to Balboa Peninsula when the accident occurred, officers said.
The 65-foot ferry, carrying a car and at least two dozen people, had
just docked. Police said Nash told them that she restarted her car
when it "suddenly lurched forward," swerved left, went onto the
sidewalk and crashed into pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   "She said the car just lurched, took off. Whether it malfunctioned
or not, I don't know. That's being investigated," said Randy
Scheerer, Newport Beach division fire chief.</TE>
<TE>   He said Nash's car traveled about 75 feet, scraped a wall, then
sheared off a row of newspaper racks. Police did not know how fast
Nash had been traveling, but witnesses estimated the car was
traveling about 25 to 35 mph. There were no skid marks, Scheerer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Nash had not taken alcohol or drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Shelly Shook and Shannon Maguire, both 14, had been pedaling their
bicycles near the ferry crossing. "We saw her pull out of the line
and then there were tons of people just flying after she hit them,"
Maguire said.</TE>
<TE>   The injured ranged in age from 1 1/2 to 62.</TE>
<TE>   Those most severely injured--Kathleen Bingley, 44, of Orange;
Marla Goldberg, 47, of Woodland Hills; and an unidentified
14-year-old from Las Vegas--were taken to Western Medical
Center-Santa Ana. Bingley was treated for internal injuries, Goldberg
suffered a broken arm and the teenager had a broken leg.</TE>
<TE>   The others who were injured were treated and released from Hoag
Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach. They included:
Scott, 47, and Jackie Andrews, 49, both of Las Vegas; John Ramirez,
31, of Long Beach; Gina Yenser, 31, Pat Rost, 62, and Denise Allen,
34, all of Las Vegas; Francis Gauthier, 39, of Quebec, Canada; John
Yarter 34, of Tustin, and Kenneth Breland, 40, of Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   The 1 1/2-year old from Costa Mesa was not identified, nor was the
extent of his injuries known.</TE>
<TE>   The ferries travel the 900 feet between the shops and beach houses
of Balboa Island and those of Balboa Peninsula.</TE>

<HD>Speeding Is Biggest Concern in Survey of Crossing Guards</HD>
<DH>Safety: Motorists who ignore stop signs also are cited as a
leading risk to schoolchildren.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the traditional school year kicks off, a new survey of crossing
guards has found that roadway conditions around elementary schools
are often dangerous, with most motorists speeding and ignoring
traffic laws near schoolchildren.</LD>
<LD>   Crossing guards from Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San
Bernardino and San Francisco counties reported that only a fourth of
all motorists drove under the mandatory 25 mph speed limit around
schools when children were present.</LD>
<LD>   The survey, the first of its kind by the California Institute of
Transportation Safety at San Diego State, found that the most common
traffic violation was committed by motorists who sped past children
in crosswalks, ignoring the crossing guards' red stop signs.</LD>
<TE>   Sheila Sarkar, the lead researcher and founder of the institute,
said the study recommends an increase in police patrols and added
roadway improvements to reduce speeding around schools.</TE>
<TE>   She said the goal of the study was to identify the working
conditions of crossing guards in Southern and Northern California.
"They are protecting the children, yet no one has made an attempt to
see their conditions," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Most crossing guards are older men and women who work about two
hours a day for an average of $8.59 per hour.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Phelps, a San Fernando Valley crossing guard for the last
four years, said the findings were no surprise to him.</TE>
<TE>   Phelps said he sees motorists routinely speed and ignore traffic
signals around children. His job is inherently dangerous, with
speeding motorists narrowly missing crossing guards on a regular
basis, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day, people fail to obey the speed laws," said Phelps, a
retired industrial photographer. "They go right through the
crosswalks while the crossing guards are there."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, crossing guards can't avoid danger.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, two guards have been killed in the last two years,
and several more throughout Southern California have been injured on
the job.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 52 crossing
guards were injured on the job in California in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 186 guards surveyed by the transportation institute, 3.5%
said they had been hit by a car on the job, and nearly 30% said they
had narrowly escaped being hit.</TE>
<TE>   About half said they had tried unsuccessfully to persuade traffic
engineers to make roadway improvements to increase children's safety
around schools.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the guards who participated in the survey said they took
the job primarily for the extra cash, but nearly half said they also
felt a need to protect the children. Many guards said they had formed
strong bonds with the children.</TE>
<TE>   More than 70% of the guards said they had never considered
quitting their job. But of those who had, most cited the dangers
posed by speeding, reckless motorists.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, police operate several programs to crack down on
drivers who speed, make illegal turns and double park around schools.
In South Los Angeles, police conduct a weekly sting operation to cite
motorists who drive through crosswalks while pedestrians are using
them. Each month, the sting nets nearly 500 violators.</TE>
<TE>   But Los Angeles Police Department officials say they don't have
the staff to patrol every school, every day.</TE>
<TE>   When school days begin and end, a frenzied swarm of motorists
pulls up to campuses throughout Los Angeles, said Sgt. Steven Smith
of the LAPD's South Los Angeles traffic bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Children who dart between cars to get to class on time are most at
risk of being hit, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is in a rush at that time of the morning," Smith said.</TE>

<HD>Two Men Found Shot to Death in Rented SUV</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two men in a rented SUV were found dead early Monday morning in
Studio City, shot several times in the chest and left in the burning
vehicle.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighters discovered the men's bodies about 1:45 a.m. on the
11600 block of Woodbridge Street.</LD>
<LD>   "It appears that the victims were killed at the scene and that the
fire was set in order to hide the crime," said Officer Eduardo Funes
of the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   One of the victims was identified as Michael Tardio, 35, of Los
Angeles. The name of the other victim, who was also in his 30s, was
being withheld until police had informed his relatives. Neither
victim had a criminal record, said LAPD Det. Mike Coffey, who was
investigating the double murder.</TE>
<TE>   The black Mercedes SUV, which one of the men had rented Saturday
in West Hollywood, had no bullet holes in it, Coffey said. The men's
bodies were found in the front seats.</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the crime scene on the quiet residential street, Coffey
said investigators could not determine if the men had been robbed.</TE>
<TE>   "We canvassed that whole neighborhood, and nobody had heard
anything," Coffey said.</TE>
<TE>   It did not appear that the shooter or shooters had fired into the
vehicle, and no weapons were recovered at the scene.</TE>

<HD>Keeping a 9/11 Victim's Dream Alive</HD>
<DH>Charity: Supporters persist in pursuit of a Burbank
doctor's efforts to fund a kidney dialysis center in his native
Ethiopia.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Terrorists killed Yeneneh Betru, but they could not murder his dream.
It survives in the physician's friends, his family, his neighbors and
even in strangers.</LD>
<LD>   They nurse it through the sale of flag-shaped lapel pins and
knitted baby caps, through proceeds from a theater performance and
private donations.</LD>
<LD>   They are preserving his memory by casting their attention on 4
million Ethiopians living in Betru's native city of Addis Ababa.</LD>
<TE>   Their hope is to open Addis Ababa's first public kidney dialysis
center--a mission that Betru, 35, had spent three years working
toward before Sept. 11, when he was on his way home to Burbank after
making arrangements for the dialysis machines in Ethiopia. After
stopping in Washington, he decided to fly back a day early. He
boarded American Airlines Flight 77, which later crashed into the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a question of 'Should we do it?' " said Ruth Betru, 29,
by phone from Addis Ababa of her brother's project. "We had to
continue it."</TE>
<TE>   Although other men might use their garages to tinker with their
cars, Betru used his to refurbish dialysis machines. Other times he
could be found on the phone, negotiating with the Ethiopian
government on an inexpensive and efficient way to ship medical
equipment to the Tikur Anbessa Hospital, or Black Lion Hospital, the
nation's largest.</TE>
<TE>   Before he was killed, Betru had gathered $15,000 worth of
equipment and fixed up six dialysis machines.</TE>
<TE>   But when friends and family tried to pick up his journey, hospital
administrators said they could not accept used machines--especially
old ones that might be hard to repair or to find parts for. Instead,
they needed four brand-new machines.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of training staff and maintaining the center, they
discovered, would total roughly $350,000.</TE>
<TE>   Other roadblocks--wary hospital administrators, transport taxes
and enough paperwork to give accountants migraines--slowed the
process. But friends and family persisted.</TE>
<TE>   Nurses at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, where
Betru worked in internal medicine, raised $7,000 by selling the lapel
pins and baby caps.</TE>
<TE>   Money poured in from the Red Cross, United Way, Operation USA, the
World Foundation for Renal Care, the Health Care Advisory Board and
even the Gamma Phi Beta Sorority at UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   All the proceeds from a Valley College performance of "Sweet
Charity" went to the future Dr. Yeneneh Betru Hemodialysis Unit.</TE>
<TE>   A North Hollywood company where Betru served as director of
medical affairs, IPC-The Hospitalist Co., set up its Salud Foundation
to funnel money toward the dialysis center.</TE>
<TE>   So far, about $60,000 has been raised, said Earl Gomberg,
executive director of IPC and the Institute for Better Breathing,
where Betru also saw patients. That covers the cost of some
equipment, which is being shipped from Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and colleagues had hoped to open the center Sept. 11, but
have had to target the end of the year instead. Before that, a
45,000-square-foot room must be secured for the center, transport
taxes must be paid and Ethiopian doctors and nurses must be trained
to operate the machines.</TE>
<TE>   As the one-year anniversary of the death of the gentle,
soft-spoken physician approaches, Betru's presence remains strong. It
lingers in a crape myrtle sapling, planted in July behind a row of
five palm trees at Providence St. Joseph in the doctor's honor.</TE>
<TE>   His relaxed appearance is frozen in a framed photo of him hanging
inside the waiting room of the Burbank-based Institute of Better
Breathing. A small plaque in a blue frame reads "In Loving Memory,
Yeneneh Betru, M.D., September 11, 2001."</TE>
<TE>   A two-tiered mail holder labeled with Betru's name still sits in a
sparse office there, too, waiting for the mail that has ceased to
come.</TE>
<TE>   To neighbor John Edmondson, 65, the one-story, white stucco house
next door will always be "Doc's House." Folks with breathing problems
would occasionally knock on Betru's door, Edmondson said, and despite
his long days, Betru would always check to make sure they were OK.</TE>
<TE>   With tears filling his light blue eyes, Edmondson described how he
bought a set of used golf clubs for Betru. A retired engineer,
Edmondson had promised Betru that they would hit the links someday.
They never got the chance.</TE>
<TE>   Inside Betru's one-story house with rust-colored shingles, George
Mandossian, 66, brushed his fingers over the stereo of the man whose
home he will move into next month.</TE>
<TE>   For the past year, it was in the dining room of this two-bedroom,
two-bathroom house that Gomberg convened weekly meetings of dialysis
specialists to discuss the project's logistics.</TE>
<TE>   A few houses down, James Miceli recalled how Betru opened his door
when he first moved in three years ago for a meet and greet, complete
with Ethiopian food.</TE>
<TE>   An avid member of Rotary International Universal City-Sunrise,
Miceli, 51, persuaded other Rotary members to apply for a matching
grant through the organization to benefit the future dialysis center.
The nonprofit organization has even pulled members of the Rotary Club
of Addis Ababa East into the project.</TE>
<TE>   When the center opens, a minimum of 50% of the 1,560 treatments a
year will be provided to poor families at no cost.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest of four children, Betru came to the United States as a
teenager to attend high school and college and, after obtaining his
medical degree in Michigan, anchored himself in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   About four years ago, while visiting his ailing grandmother in
Ethiopia, Betru discovered "the poor condition of the medical system"
there, said his brother Aron Betru, 26. His mission began when he
learned that not one dialysis center existed in Ethiopia at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "He always said, 'Life is short, do what you can,' " said another
brother, Sirak Betru, 34. "In his case, he ran out of life."</TE>
<TE>   His dream, however, presses on.</TE>

<HD>Ficus at the Root of Problem in Balboa</HD>
<DH>Streets: Arbor society has gone to court to stop city from
cutting down the sidewalk- destroying trees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once a landscaping staple in suburbs and planned communities, the
lush and leafy ficus has become a civic nuisance--its thick roots
buckling sidewalks and streets, breaching sewer lines and cracking
foundations of homes and businesses.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, cities have spent millions dealing with the
troublesome trees. Some have been creative about it. In Santa Monica,
city engineers have experimented with rubber sidewalks that bend with
the swollen roots. Most, however, have resorted to chopping down the
trees, often in the face of opposition.</LD>
<LD>   In historic downtown Balboa, such opposition has become a legal
battle.</LD>
<TE>   A group of tree-loving residents, calling itself the Balboa
Arborist Society, has gone to court to keep the city from ripping out
25 ficus, mostly along Main Street. City leaders say the mature shade
trees stand in the way of a $2.8-million improvement project, also
mostly along Main.</TE>
<TE>   The ficus backers won a temporary court injunction last week,
forcing the city to keep its hands off the trees until Sept. 16, when
a full court hearing is scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   While all agree that the aging trees are beautiful and add
graceful charm to Balboa's narrow streets, locals are divided on what
should be done with them.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just trying to put a new, fresh face on downtown Balboa,"
said Homer Bludau, city manager of Newport Beach, whose borders
contain Balboa. "This improvement project has been a major priority
that's now on hold indefinitely.... It's very difficult to move
forward with such uncertainty."</TE>
<TE>   The city had planned to cut down the mature ficus this weekend.
The trees, which form a green canopy, would be replaced with young
coral gum trees, slow growers with less aggressive roots. Once freed
of the thick ficus roots that run like tentacles along Main, the
street would get new walkways, curbs and gutters. "When I think about
the ficus, that they might not be there one day, it's very upsetting
to me," said Linda Grant, president of the group that sued the city.
She and her husband, Bud, estimate that they've spent $15,000 on the
legal fight to spare the ficus.</TE>
<TE>   "If they cut down these trees, I'd never be able to walk down this
street again. It would just kill me inside," said Grant, who recalls
climbing and even carving her initials in the trees as a child. "The
trees are magical. It's where fishers sit after a day's catch, where
birds sing and children play. They're comforting."</TE>
<TE>   Grant and other tree activists have lobbied City Hall to spare the
trees and have sung their own variations on songs, such as "Tie a
Yellow Ribbon Around the Ficus Trees," at City Council meetings. The
city commissioned a report on the trees last year, asking staffers to
study and create a profile for each ficus, planted in the 1960s. The
city even gave them a "special tree" designation for their age,
beauty and historic value.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was decided that the trees had to go.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't take removing any tree in the city lightly," Bludau
said. "I'm not too surprised by their opposition. The trees are
definitely beautiful. But they're the wrong trees in the wrong
place." Hardy and fast-growing, the nonnative ficus, imported from
India and the Mediterranean, have been planted all over Southern
California along neighborhood curbs and roadsides since the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   Their trunks can grow to 30 inches in diameter and their shallow
roots, which often break the surface, can spread 20 feet. Cities
including Orange, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Cerritos, Hermosa Beach
and Glendale have taken the ficus off their favored-tree list.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to kill a healthy, mature tree that is so tall and
magnificent and has been around so long, so it becomes an emotional
topic," said Frank Gibbons, a Cal Poly Pomona horticulturalist. "Good
trees grow slower, and it's hard to see the full potential and beauty
of these type of trees in our lifetime. I love ficus myself. But they
do become a maintenance problem and safety hazard when they get
older."</TE>
<TE>   Along Main Street, cracks in the sidewalk are apparent around half
a dozen ficus, and in the street are patches of asphalt similarly
roughened by the roots. Sewer lines and foundations have also been
damaged.</TE>
<TE>   The activists prefer that the city prune the roots, install
devices to block root growth or remove only the few trees actually
causing problems.</TE>
<TE>   "We just don't want a blanket removal of all the ficus trees,"
said Jan Vandersloot, a member of the tree advocates. "Just some
balance to keep the ambience."</TE>
<TE>   Some locals are ambivalent and concede that maybe the trees' time
has passed.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care one way or the other," said Mike, a stylist who has
worked at J.J.'s Hair Cutting on Main Street for 28 years. "I think
the trees are good for business; it's unique and charming, but I
wouldn't want the foundation of this building to crack."</TE>

<HD>Abe Lemons, 79; Basketball Coach Beloved for His Humor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD and JIM BARRERO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Abe Lemons, the Oklahoma-bred college basketball coach who became as
famous for his homespun wit as his 599 victories, died Monday after a
long illness.</LD>
<LD>   He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Lemons, who suffered from Parkinson's disease, died at home in
Oklahoma City. His declining health was accelerated after he broke
his hip in July.</LD>
<TE>   He won the 1978 National Invitation Tournament title while at
Texas and took eight teams to the NCAA tournament--seven from
Oklahoma City University and one from Texas--but Lemons' words will
live on longer than the on-court highlights.</TE>
<TE>   John Wooden, the former UCLA coach, on Monday called Lemons "the
most humorous coach I've ever known."</TE>
<TE>   Even illness didn't easily dull Lemons' wit.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember his hands used to shake, but he would say, 'I don't
have Parkinson's, all I have is rhythm,' " Wooden said. "Oh, I just
enjoyed him so very much."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Walters, Okla., on Nov. 21, 1922, Lemons played basketball
at Southwestern Oklahoma State in Weatherford as well as at Oklahoma
City before he began his career as a head coach at Oklahoma City in
1955.</TE>
<TE>   He stayed 18 years before leaving to coach at Texas Pan American
for three seasons, where he joked he would rather become a football
coach:</TE>
<TE>   "That way you can lose only 11 games a season," he said. "I lost
11 games in December alone."</TE>
<TE>   Lemons took over at Texas in 1976, revitalizing the Longhorn
program with his teams' hell-bent running game and a 110-63 record in
six seasons.</TE>
<TE>   But when DeLoss Dodds became athletic director, he and Lemons soon
clashed.</TE>
<TE>   Lemons charged into the stands to challenge some heckling Arkansas
fans in 1982, and he was fired at season's end, embittering him for
many years.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he returned to coach for seven more seasons at Oklahoma
City, where the basketball arena bears his name.</TE>
<TE>   When Lemons finally retired in 1990 at 67--ending a 34-year career
as a head coach with a 599-343 record--he acknowledged he might be
out of touch at last.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the media guide and see a guy's favorite music
is Heavy D, well ... who? That's a telltale sign I've lost it," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Much admired by fellow coaches, Lemons was a friend of former
Indiana coach Bob Knight, and made the trip to Lubbock, Texas, last
fall for Knight's debut as Texas Tech coach.</TE>
<TE>   Lemons was honored by some of the biggest names in coaching during
a banquet at a recent NCAA Final Four tournament, pulling out his
notes with shaking hands.</TE>
<TE>   "I had some notes, but with all this shaking, they've come out in
Spanish," he said. "And I can't read Spanish."</TE>
<TE>   His one-liners weren't always about basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Lemons liked to say he once came within two strokes of winning a
car in a golf tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a hole-in-one contest--and I had a three," he'd say.</TE>
<TE>   Track and field, he said, was the easiest sport to coach.</TE>
<TE>   "All you have to do is just tell them to stay to the left and
hurry back."</TE>
<TE>   Though his teams were successful, his attitude about rules was
decidedly unorthodox.</TE>
<TE>   "If I make a set of rules, then a guy goes out and steals an
airplane," Lemons would say. "He comes back and says, 'It wasn't on
the list of rules.' "</TE>
<TE>   Curfews? He didn't have them.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a curfew, it's always your star who gets caught."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he joked that whenever his teams played in Abilene, Texas,
he punished them by not allowing them in their rooms before 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be doing them a favor by letting them come in earlier," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lemons was crazy like a fox, though.</TE>
<TE>   "One day of practice is like one day of clean living. It doesn't
do you any good," he used to say.</TE>
<TE>   And he employed cagey strategy even in scheduling his opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll give a lecture in a clinic and look for the guy who's taking
notes. That's the guy I want to schedule a game with next year," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Or this: "Coaches who shoot par in the summer are the guys I want
on my schedule in the winter."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the prevailing wisdom was, Lemons reexamined it.</TE>
<TE>   "What's an education? It's good for the average guy, but if
somebody hands a poor kid $2 million to go around half-naked,
bouncing a ball, then he'd better take it.</TE>
<TE>   "Then, if he wants a diploma, he can always buy a college and put
his name on it. Like Oral Roberts did."</TE>
<TE>   Still, his most imitated line came after he chastised his center
for grabbing only one rebound in the first half of a game.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one more than a dead guy," Lemons said.</TE>
<TE>   Variations of that line--for any player who has only one rebound
or one basket or one block--are part of basketball lore, and will
live on.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone that didn't like Abe Lemons, there had to be something
wrong with them," Wooden said.</TE>

<HD>Bay Area Unites in Bid for Olympics</HD>
<DH>Sports: San Francisco would be the host city for the 2012
Summer Games, but events would be scattered across the region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>The bid to bring the 2012 Summer Olympics to California has San
Francisco's name all over it. Glossy brochures feature photos of the
Golden Gate Bridge and tout the city's international flair and
moderate summer climate as ideal conditions for competition.</LD>
<LD>   But the San Francisco proposal is really a regionwide bid. The
most high-profile events would take place elsewhere in the Bay Area,
and holding the Olympics here would require unprecedented cooperation
of cities and counties on everything from security and transportation
to funding and bragging rights.</LD>
<LD>   If selected, San Francisco would be able to show off its
picturesque bay views in such events as the sailing and triathlon
competitions. Its gleaming new waterfront ballpark would be home to
baseball games.</LD>
<TE>   But there would be no Golden Gate Bridge shining in the background
during opening and closing ceremonies, which would be held at
Stanford University, about 30 miles to the south in Palo Alto. So
would competition in 10 sports, including track and field, swimming,
diving and the pentathlon. Included in the proposed budget is $150
million to renovate the private university's Stanford Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The athletes would be housed in Mountain View--even farther south
than Palo Alto. An Olympic village is envisioned at the site of
Moffett Field, a former naval air station now under the auspices of
NASA and the Army Corps of Engineers. Plans call for the construction
of 2,500 residential units on the government-owned property, which
organizers hope would ultimately be turned into private housing in
partnership with a real estate developer.</TE>
<TE>   Originally the bid was supposed to be for a Bay Area Olympics, but
San Francisco won the title because the International Olympic
Committee requires that just one city be designated as host.</TE>
<TE>   "One reason we felt the bid was so strong was, it offers San
Francisco and Silicon Valley, the marriage of the two," said Anne
Cribbs, chief executive of the Bay Area Sports Organizing Committee,
the Palo Alto-based group that is spearheading the bid.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 3, the U.S. Olympic Committee will select San Francisco or
New York as the U.S. candidate to be host of the Games a decade from
now. The International Olympic Committee won't make a final selection
until 2005.</TE>
<TE>   An American city is widely considered a long shot, however,
considering that the U.S. has been host to four Games in the last 22
years. Winter Games were held in Lake Placid, N.Y., in 1980 and Salt
Lake City this year. Summer Games were in Los Angeles in 1984 and
Atlanta in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   A North American city may face even longer odds if Vancouver,
British Columbia, is chosen as host for the 2010 Winter Games. It was
announced Wednesday that the western Canadian city was among the four
finalists.</TE>
<TE>   If Vancouver is selected, many believe the International Olympic
Committee would be unlikely to select another North American city
just two years later. The other candidates for 2010 are Salzburg,
Austria; Bern, Switzerland; and Pyeongchang, South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   But the odds haven't dampened the optimism of San Francisco Mayor
Willie Brown, who said he was "ecstatic" to learn that his city is a
finalist among U.S. cities.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe we offer the best conditions for the athletes and the
most financially responsible bid," Brown said. "I am confident that
San Francisco will be chosen as the American candidate for the 2012
Games."</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for 10 sporting events within the San Francisco city
limits, including the triathlon, table tennis, taekwondo, boxing and
fencing and preliminary soccer and handball matches. Other
competitions would be in San Jose, Santa Clara, Oakland and Berkeley,
and some as far away as Monterey, Napa Valley and Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers say it is this decentralized model, drawing heavily on
existing facilities around the Bay Area, that makes the plan
financially attractive. In addition to Stanford, events would be at
UC Berkeley, San Jose State University and Santa Clara University,
and at professional sports stadiums, including the Oakland Coliseum
Arena, Network Associates Coliseum, 3Com Park and Pacific Bell
Ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   To shuttle spectators to various events, planners are counting on
the completion of some long-planned improvements in the region's
existing public transportation. The most ambitious of these is a
major extension of BART, the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system,
from San Francisco to San Jose. The line now doesn't go far enough
south to reach the San Francisco Airport.</TE>
<TE>   About 80% of the necessary funding for a BART extension has been
secured from state and local sources, but the region must compete for
the federal funds necessary to complete the project. Local
transportation officials hope that landing an Olympic bid would help
them beat other cities for those transportation dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you've got something like the Olympics coming to your
region, that's a leg up," said Trent Lethco, associate planner with
the Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission. "Salt Lake City
got $200 million in federal funds" for transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Already, planners say, the far-flung nature of the plan has
spawned a sense of cooperation among the Bay Area's often staunchly
independent municipalities and governing agencies, particularly on
the issues of security and transportation.</TE>
<TE>   "We've really brought together a lot of people just by bidding,"
said Cribbs, the committee chief.</TE>
<TE>   Political science professor Rich DeLeon of San Francisco State
agrees that the Games could have a unifying effect.</TE>
<TE>   "I've long lamented that there's been little regional cooperation
here," he said. "There's a very fragmented nine-county regional area
with over 100 cities. If they actually did land the Olympics, it
would spur meaningful regionwide cooperation around a common
project."</TE>

<HD>Dr. Sanford Palay, 83; Innovative Neuroscientist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Sanford L. Palay, a neuroscientist who helped explain how nerve
cells work and how "messenger chemicals" get to the brain, has died.
He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Palay died of kidney failure Aug. 5 in Concord, Mass.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1970s, Palay and his wife at the time, Victoria Chan-Palay,
did groundbreaking research on the cerebellum, the portion of the
brain that coordinates physical movement. That seminal work helped
explain the structures that dispense messenger chemicals and made the
cerebellum one of the best understood parts of the brain. They
detailed their research in a series of scientific papers and a
textbook, "The Cerebellar Cortex."</LD>
<TE>   Palay's individual research had begun to attract notice two
decades earlier when he was working at Rockefeller University in New
York. In 1953, he used what was then a new instrument, the electron
microscope, to study the synaptic transmission of nerve impulses. His
paper, "The Fine Structure of Neurons," and his subsequent research
helped provide a detailed anatomy of nerve cells.</TE>
<TE>   He also explored and explained the structure of cells that support
and protect neurons.</TE>
<TE>   Born to Russian immigrant laborers in Cleveland, Palay earned his
undergraduate degree in English at Oberlin College and his medical
degree from Case Western Reserve University. He became a generous
donor to Oberlin, giving countless neuroscience journals to its
library over the years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, he donated a large collection of 20th century Western and
Japanese prints, paintings and ceramics to the college's Allen
Memorial Art Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more important, the same year he donated more than 1,000
histological slides of human brain tissue to the school's
Neuroscience Department. The art-loving scientist described the
slides as "a precious resource that should be conserved as if they
were art objects from the Renaissance."</TE>
<TE>   "I am happy that this collection has found a home in Oberlin," he
said in 1999. "It should help to make the internal architecture of
the brain real for students of neuroscience."</TE>
<TE>   Palay served in the Army Medical Corps during the postwar U.S.
occupation of Japan. He then began his career teaching at Yale School
of Medicine before joining Rockefeller University.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, he was chief of the neurocytology section at the
National Institutes of Health, and from 1971 until his retirement in
1989, he taught neuroanatomy at Harvard Medical School.</TE>
<TE>   The author of more than 100 scientific papers and eight books,
Palay earned top awards from the American Assn. of Anatomists and the
American Philosophical Society. He edited the Journal of Comparative
Neurology for 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   Palay is survived by two daughters, a brother and two
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Pit Bull Victim Stresses Owner Responsibility</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kerrie Morgan knocked on a door in 1986 and it changed her life
forever.</LD>
<LD>   Crouching behind that door in Huntington Beach was a 100-pound pit
bull named Spike. Within seconds, the dog had sprung at her and
mangled her hands. Today--16 years, several operations and countless
tears later--Morgan said she has learned to cope with life minus a
left middle finger.</LD>
<LD>   What she still has trouble understanding is the carelessness that
led to the attack.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't have anything against pits," said Morgan, 44, a senior
animal control officer with the Orange County Department of Animal
Care Services. "There are other dogs out there that bite. What it
boils down to is having responsible pet owners. Had these people been
responsible, this never would have happened."</TE>
<TE>   The experience has come back to haunt her with the recent pit bull
attacks in Southern California. A 2-year-old La Habra boy suffered
massive lacerations in an Aug. 18 attack at a relative's home.
Several days later, a Los Angeles letter carrier was seriously
injured when a pit bull bit off part of her nose. And on Aug. 23, a
26-year-old Garden Grove woman was bitten 14 times by a pit bull that
had charged her from behind.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,000 Orange County residents have been bitten by dogs this
year, authorities say; the total for 2001 was about 4,000. Most bites
have been relatively benign. Most serious altercations have involved
pit bulls--and when a pit bull hurts someone, experts say, the damage
can be severe.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to understand," a Los Angeles Animal Services
spokeswoman said, "that you are dealing with a really powerful
animal."</TE>
<TE>   In Morgan's case, it was the breed's power that had brought her to
the dog owner's door in the first place. As an animal control
officer, part of her job is to respond to complaints regarding
potentially vicious animals. Spike had already bitten two people. So
Morgan was dispatched to the house to speak with his owner.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't afraid," she said, "because, unfortunately, I thought
that responsible people kept dogs from jumping out of doorways."</TE>
<TE>   In this case, she was wrong: The officer had barely gotten two
sentences out when the dog leaped at her without warning from behind
the open door. "It happened so fast," she said, "that all I saw was a
big black-and-white flash. He held on long enough to break my bone
and separate the finger from my hand."</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the much-publicized attack, the dog was put to
death. And Morgan began the life of a seriously injured victim with
post-traumatic stress.</TE>
<TE>   All told, she had three operations to completely remove the finger
and eliminate residual pain, lost eight months of work and underwent
two years of therapy to deal with the emotional aspects of the
trauma. Morgan said that on her first day back on the job she was
sent on another call to Huntington Beach. "I wasn't ready for that."</TE>
<TE>   She spent several months in a desk job. Eventually, thanks mostly
to her own determination that the incident not derail her career, the
now senior animal control officer was able to resume her original
duties and, later, get promoted to the level of instructor.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Morgan and her husband live in a three-bedroom Riverside
house that is paid for, in part, with half the proceeds from a
$300,000 judgment she won in a civil lawsuit against Spike's owner.</TE>
<TE>   The rest, she said, went for lawyers' fees and medical bills.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly to some, one of her favorite things about the house
is that it has ample space for two cats and an Australian shepherd
named Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a dog lover before, and I still am," Morgan said.</TE>
<TE>   She even likes pit bulls, which she sometimes deals with at work.
"There are some really nice pits," Morgan said. "The wrong one just
came out the door that day."</TE>
<TE>   Yet she has little tolerance for pit bull owners who don't control
their pets. "One of the big lessons of this experience," she said,
"is that not everybody thinks the way I do. I wouldn't open the door
with a nasty dog at large."</TE>
<TE>   To guard against those who would, Morgan said, she now takes
precautions when knocking on the doors of unknown dog owners. "I give
myself three feet and put my foot against the screen," she said.
"I've leaned on a lot of doors in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Her own door is guarded by a large German shepherd that's curled
up on the floor. The dog is a little ragged and stays silent--the
product of some taxidermist's art. Yet it does its job, giving
would-be intruders pause.</TE>
<TE>   It's most desirable quality, Morgan says: It doesn't bite.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Basic Safety Around Dogs</TE>
<TE>   * Don't approach an unfamiliar dog.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't disturb a dog that is sleeping, eating or caring for
puppies.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't pet a dog without allowing it to see and sniff you first.</TE>
<TE>   * Avoid eye contact with an unfamiliar dog.</TE>
<TE>   * Remain motionless when approached by an unfamiliar dog.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't scream while running from a dog.</TE>
<TE>   * If knocked over by a dog, roll into a ball and lie still.</TE>
<TE>   * Immediately report stray dogs or dogs displaying unusual
behavior.</TE>

<HD>Holiday Used as Political Pulpit</HD>
<DH>Rallies: Exhorting union members and activists to support
their platforms, public officials speak at area Labor Day events.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT and DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rev. Jesse Jackson used the platform to blast President Bush for
his administration's push for war against Iraq. Gov. Gray Davis
stepped onstage to urge Los Angeles workers to organize against his
GOP challenger, Bill Simon Jr. And Mayor James Hahn asked labor
activists to rise up against the secession movements in Hollywood and
the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   In a portable pulpit outside the UNITE union headquarters near the
lush grounds of MacArthur Park, federal, state and local leaders used
the Labor Day forum as a chance to make public pleas for action
against a variety of their foes.</LD>
<LD>   The event was originally set up to celebrate the opening of the
new UCLA downtown Labor Center, a 6,000-square-foot facility at the
UNITE building with a computer learning center and classroom space
for union leadership seminars and job training. Indeed, the event
included the usual ribbon-cutting ceremony.</LD>
<TE>   But mostly, it was a chance for Jackson, Davis, Hahn and nearly
two dozen other officials to rally some of their most powerful
constituents--union members.</TE>
<TE>   "Labor Day is not just a picnic festival," Jackson told about 500
people. "Workers are under assault.... We've lost 2 million jobs in
the last two years, and Bush is playing terror like a one-string
guitar."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he was particularly troubled by the Bush
administration's push for military action against Iraq, especially
when Bush himself has never served in battle.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like the chicken hawks and the draft-dodgers are driving
the generals out to war," Jackson said. "If they want to go to war
for the first time, let them go to war. We choose negotiation."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hahn focused his comments on efforts by the San
Fernando Valley and Hollywood to break away from Los Angeles and form
their own cities. The matter will be decided by voters in November.</TE>
<TE>   "United we are much stronger," Hahn told a cheering crowd. "That's
the message we want to send to the people of Los Angeles. Just so you
know, the candidates for office in this new Valley city are already
talking about doing away with the living wage, and they are
threatening the jobs and the pensions of our city workers.... We need
to stop this movement before it spreads."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, meanwhile, said the main person he wanted to stop was Bill
Simon.</TE>
<TE>   "My opponent Mr. Simon wants to take away many of the hard-won
rights we have gained over the last four years," Davis said. "We
cannot let him do that."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to giving elected officials a platform, the event
signaled a further thawing of the icy relationship between Hahn and
Los Angeles County Federation of Labor leader Miguel Contreras, who
supported Antonio Villaraigosa in his bid for mayor. Last Labor Day,
Hahn was a no-show at events supported by Contreras. But this year,
the two men stood together onstage. Joining them were U.S. Rep.
Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles)--another former mayoral candidate--and
Villaraigosa.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to be here today because it gives us an
opportunity to honor the men and women who put the food on our
tables, who teach our children, who work in our emergency rooms,"
Villaraigosa said. "They work not only for their families, they work
to make the United States the great country that it is."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Wilmington, several thousand dockworkers and their
supporters staged a Labor Day parade and rally to focus attention on
stalled contract negotiations with major shipping lines along the
West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The talks between the International Longshore and Warehouse Union
and the shippers broke down last weekend over health benefits and
other issues.</TE>
<TE>   Union negotiators were scheduled to meet today to decide their
next move, which could include a work slowdown at 29 ports in
California, Washington and Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't understand what labor is all about," James Spinosa,
the union's international president, told the crowd at Banning Park.
"We're not going to sit back and watch as they outsource and downsize
like they do in every other country. We're holding our ground right
here."</TE>
<TE>   However, Joe Miniace, president of the Pacific Maritime Assn.,
which is negotiating for the shipping lines, said in a telephone
interview that workers could be locked out of job sites within two to
three days of a slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   The dockworkers got a boost Monday from scores of teachers,
electricians, carpenters and others who marched in a show of
solidarity.</TE>
<TE>   Many at the rally called the longshoremen's fight key to their own
survival. If the dockworkers do not prevail, they said, it will send
a chilling message to other unions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be devastating to all of us," said Bruce Blake, a
truck driver and member of the Southern California chapter of
Teamsters for a Democratic Union.</TE>
<TE>   "The power we have is in the working people," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has asked President Bush to stay out of labor negotiations at
the Port of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said he wants to allow the Pacific Maritime Assn. and
the dockworkers to resolve their differences without federal
involvement.</TE>
<TE>   "Federal intervention at this critical juncture is not needed and
may well exacerbate the dispute with potentially adverse economic
impacts," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn wrote to Bush after reports that the president might call in
the National Guard or invoke a national economic emergency under the
Taft-Hartley Act in response to the labor deadlock.</TE>
<TE>   "As you know," Hahn wrote, "in the aftermath of Sept. 11, the City
of Los Angeles has given top priority to enhancing safety and
security at its port, a vital component of the local, state and
federal economy."</TE>
<TE>   Calling in the guard or declaring an emergency, he said, "could
have a long-term adverse impact on future labor-management
collaboration that is so critical to enabling the port to continue to
implement vital security measures."</TE>
<TE>   Miniace said he knew of no Bush administration preparations to use
Navy or other personnel to keep ports operating in the event of a
strike or lockout.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not aware of any such plan [and have] not been involved in
any such plan," he said in a telephone interview. He characterized
such federal intervention as being "on the far end of the spectrum
... out of the realm of possibility."</TE>

<KH>CATHEDRAL OF OUR LADY OF THE ANGELS</KH>
<HD>Opening Their Hearts to a New Spiritual Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE and STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are probably no words for what the opening of the Cathedral of
Our Lady of the Angels will mean to 84-year-old Mike Carcano's
family. But Msgr. Terrance Fleming came close early Monday when he
saw Carcano at the dedication and said simply, "Welcome home."</LD>
<LD>   Carcano had some of the deepest ties to Catholic Los Angeles'
previous mother church, St. Vibiana's. The old church was the Los
Angeles Archdiocese's cathedral center for 117 years before being
severely damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. And for 65 years,
Carcano was part of her flock.</LD>
<LD>   St. Vibiana's was the glue that held together Carcano's far-flung
clan of five children, 23 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren.
Every Sunday for decades, he would rouse them all with terse 5 a.m.
phone greetings ("Get up!") and drive as far as Whittier to pick up
the grandchildren, who would be altar servers. Every Sunday after
Mass, the family would gather at his home for homemade Mexican
brunches of steaming menudo, tortillas, tamales and bean burritos.</LD>
<TE>   After St. Vibiana's was closed, the family scattered to their
neighborhood churches and suspended their Sunday brunch tradition.
Now that the new cathedral has officially opened, the Carcano family,
12 of whom attended Monday's dedication, say they hope the weekly
gatherings can begin anew.</TE>
<TE>   "We've waited for this moment almost 10 years," said Carcano, who
played a ceremonial role connecting past and future by carrying in
the marble box of saints' relics from St. Vibiana's. "Now we can all
be together again."</TE>
<TE>   Other Catholics who attended the dedication under sweltering skies
also expressed excitement that the cathedral would become a sacred
gathering place for the greater church in a way St. Vibiana's never
could. As the diocese grew to the most populous in the nation, the
1,200-seat St. Vibiana's was considered inadequate for such special
occasions as Cardinal Roger M. Mahony's 1985 installation as
archbishop and Pope John Paul II's celebration of Mass there in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   New Traditions</TE>
<TE>   Catholics such as Adriana Vasquez, 36, a Catholic school
kindergarten teacher from Bell Gardens, fondly remember Sunday
mornings at St. Vibiana's. "They had mariachis at Mass, and I
remember the beautiful windows," she recalled. Yet as she waited on
the plaza level Monday for the ceremony to begin, she said she could
imagine new traditions at this gathering place.</TE>
<TE>   "This plaza, this space, reminds me of being outside churches in
Mexico," she said. "There are so many Latinos here. I can see Las
Posadas [a Christmastime pageant] here. I can see the procession for
the Virgin of Guadalupe here."</TE>
<TE>   Kiku and Clare Kurahashi, sisters and parishioners at St. Francis
Xavier Chapel in Little Tokyo, said that they rarely visited St.
Vibiana's, and that many Catholics found it inaccessible with its
wrought-iron gates and restricted public space.</TE>
<TE>   "But this is much more open," Kiku Kurahashi said, gesturing to
the open public plaza filled with milling guests and volunteers in
maroon jackets sharing post-ceremony sandwiches, soft drinks and
conversation. Added her sister, Claire: "It's time for the church to
go outward, not stay inward. This is a good foundation to build that
from."</TE>
<TE>   Some Catholics, however, confessed what Jaime Corado, 22,
described as "big challenges in my heart" to accept the cathedral as
his new spiritual home.</TE>
<TE>   For Corado, a Salvadoran immigrant and seminarian in his third
semester at St. John's in Camarillo, the old church on the fringe of
skid row was his first parish in the United States. It was a place
where parishioners would give him food and shoes, where he trained as
an altar server and where priests inspired him to enter the seminary
more than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The people of St. Vibiana's showed me the spirit of God. They
were like my family. They made me a gentle man," Corado said. "I miss
it."</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, he holds a letter that speaks to his future.
Cardinal Mahony has sent him an invitation to be an altar server at
Our Lady of the Angels. He looks forward to the relationship, but
feels a certain anxiety. "This place is supposed to be my new home,
but it doesn't yet feel that way."</TE>
<TE>   The new cathedral contains parts of St. Vibiana's that seemed to
comfort the old parishioners--most hearteningly, the brilliant
stained-glass windows installed in the mausoleum beneath the
sanctuary. When Minerva Amaro, 47, of the Pico Union district, saw
them, she said she choked up as a flood of memories rushed back.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Boudreaux, who was part of the mausoleum design team of J.
Stuart Todd, said his crowning career achievement will always be
linked to St. Vibiana's.</TE>
<TE>   "We saved the stained-glass windows," he said. "The whole subdued
design of the mausoleum is to centerpiece those windows."</TE>
<TE>   St. Vibiana's will become a performing arts center for Cal State
Los Angeles; preservationists were able to prevent the archdiocese
from simply tearing it down.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring the old cathedral's significance, 120 of St.
Vibiana's previous parishioners received the coveted invitations to
the dedication. Each of the archdiocese's other 287 parishes were
allowed to send only a few representatives, who joined the crowd of
cardinals, priests and nuns, well-heeled donors and political
heavyweights.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Fence</TE>
<TE>   The dedication seemed to be as much an event for those kept
outside the closely guarded chain-link fence as those invited in. In
addition to demonstrators debating the merits of the cathedral,
dozens of people from El Monte to South-Central to Riverside--kept
out because they didn't have a special invitation--couched their
disappointment by focusing on future visits.</TE>
<TE>   Some whiled away the time passing out religious items such as
scapulars or, in the case of Jose Francisco Lopez, selling hand-drawn
portraits of Jesus to the sidewalk crowd for dollar donations. "At
least the people here can leave with something," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Angel Gutierrez, 32, a warehouse worker and parishioner at
St. Emmidius in Lynwood, arrived at 7 a.m. decked out in black
stingray-skin shoes and a white ruffled shirt he said symbolized the
garb of saints in medieval times. For three years, he had driven by
the site regularly to watch the cathedral grow up--from the laying of
the concrete to the raising of the bell tower--and had wanted to be
present at the moment of the great building's baptism.</TE>
<TE>   Rivulets of sweat running down his face, Gutierrez said he would
be back today at 6 a.m. to ensure a seat for the first public Mass at
7 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Paul D'Amico, a 45-year-old employee of the U.S. Marine Corps
community services, drove three hours from the military base in
Twentynine Palms, only to find that he, too, was shut out. D'Amico
said he came this day in part to celebrate the raising of a cathedral
in a city filled with enough Catholics to support one; he had served
in countries such as Greenland, where priests were 800 miles apart,
compelling Catholics to "attend" Mass via satellite.</TE>
<TE>   Marta Reyes, 54, dressed up in a blue flowered dress and white
jacket, and spent 45 minutes on a bus from El Monte intent on
witnessing the dedication of the cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   She knew that St. Vibiana's has been her longtime cathedral, "but
to tell you the truth, I didn't even know where it was because I
don't drive." She had watched the freeway-side construction of Our
Lady of Angels from the window of her bus and was eager to step
inside.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not angry, but I'm disappointed. I thought this was going to
be for everybody," she said after being turned away at the chain-link
fence that cordoned off the cathedral's Temple Street entrance.</TE>
<TE>   "But Sunday, I'll come on Sunday," she said. "I just want to be a
part of a Mass."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A smoky brush fire scorched at least 10 acres of the Santa Clara
River bed near Fillmore on Monday, threatening a seniors-only mobile
home park before Ventura County fire crews blocked its path.</LD>
<LD>   Fueled by dry grass, oily river reeds and 106-degree temperatures,
the fire burned along the riverbed, igniting spot fires in various
directions as mild wind gusts pushed it east away from the city,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   One firefighter suffered heat exhaustion, said Sandi Wells,
spokeswoman for the Ventura County Fire Department.</LD>
<TE>   The fire started at midafternoon just west of the Santa Clara
River Bridge at A Street, and had traveled about 1 1/2 miles by
Monday evening. Authorities could not say when it would be
extinguished.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been so hot and the vegetation is so dry that it's
spotting," Wells said late Monday. "So we're having a number of small
fires ahead of the main fires. They're not huge, but if we have a
wind of any magnitude it could blow it across to the north side of
[Highway 126]. And that's an open area.</TE>
<TE>   "The head of the fire is still active, which means it's still
moving," she said. "But it's contained within the riverbed. It has
almost a natural line around it."</TE>
<TE>   Flames reached 50 feet in height and a column of black smoke rose
1,000 feet into the air, visible throughout much of the county and
drifting in the direction of Santa Clarita, Wells said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies said the fire came within about 200 yards of a
housing subdivision and about 50 yards of the Eldorado mobile home
park.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the 15 fire engines called in provided protection for the
mobile home park, Wells said. In all, about 150 firefighters
responded, including hand crews from the state Department of
Forestry. Two water-dropping sheriff's helicopters and two bulldozers
also were used in the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did hot weather stoke the Fillmore fire Monday, it set an
all-time record for the date in Simi Valley at 111 degrees, breaking
the 1982 mark by 2 degrees. It was 109 degrees in Ojai and 107 in
Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "Sunday and Monday were the two hottest days of the summer," said
Stuart Seto, weather specialist for the National Weather Service in
Oxnard.</TE>

<HD>Attacks Produced a Seismic Shift in the Political Agenda</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Scouring their speeches from the 2000 election, President Bush and Al
Gore, his Democratic rival, can both find moments when they urged
increased vigilance against terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   But terrorism wasn't a central, or even a secondary, issue in
their fiercely fought campaign. Neither candidate suggested that
defending against terrorism would soon become perhaps the preeminent
challenge facing the United States. Taxes, education, health care,
Social Security, even the moral climate in the capital, all attracted
far more attention from the candidates, and from the voters.</LD>
<LD>   That's a measure of how abruptly the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11
have compelled America to reorder its priorities. Just as the jumbo
jets slamming into the World Trade Center ignited fires hot enough to
melt steel, the threat exposed on that searing morning has
wrenchingly reshaped the agenda in Washington and the terms of
political debate.</LD>
<TE>   Across the country, dozens of federal agencies are shifting their
focus: stockpiling vaccines, reconstructing the security system at
the nation's airports, struggling to build systems to monitor foreign
students and visitors, dispatching more inspectors to examine cargo
containers in foreign ports and searching for new ways to monitor and
disrupt extremist groups at home and abroad. In all, this might be
the most comprehensive government mobilization since the frantic
months after Pearl Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's historic, and it's stunning in terms of how much we are
trying to do at once," said Donald Kettl, a University of Wisconsin
political scientist who studies federal administration.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Ridge, director of the White House Office of Homeland
Security, said that as many as 100 agencies and departments are
involved in the effort to stiffen the nation's defenses. "If you took
a look at all these agencies, you will find that ... as of 9/11, if
they didn't have a particular individual or team assigned to
[terrorism], they do now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, this massive mobilization in a climate of wartime
urgency appeared poised to mute political debate for the indefinite
future. That hasn't happened. After a few months of truce, the two
major parties again are banging heads in Washington over the full
range of domestic issues, and candidates still are scorching each
other with attack ads.</TE>
<TE>   But the new threat has changed the playing field on which the
parties are contesting their differences. It has compelled Congress
to appropriate billions of dollars for the military and homeland
defense--spending that over time is likely to squeeze domestic
priorities favored by Democrats and drive the parties toward
sharpened conflict concerning taxes and the federal budget.</TE>
<TE>   It has increased the relevance of national defense, which faded
after the Cold War, as a campaign issue in 2002, and almost certainly
will make credibility as commander in chief more important to voters
assessing presidential candidates in 2004 and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   And it has greatly strengthened Bush, whose performance in the
days after the tragedy appears to have resolved doubts many Americans
held about whether he was up to the job of president. Just before the
attacks, 40% to 45% of Americans were telling pollsters they doubted
Bush had the experience and intellect for the job; today,
three-fourths of Americans say they consider him a strong and
decisive leader who can manage the government effectively.</TE>
<TE>   "It has given him a credibility and a legitimacy that was
questionable before the attacks," said Andrew Kohut, director of the
Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, an independent
polling group. "He became every bit a legitimate president, and
questions about the 2000 election and his gravitas just disappeared."</TE>
<TE>   As one dividend for the White House, the heightened sense of
vulnerability and increased trust in Bush's foreign policy judgment
has created a backdrop that likely will make it tougher for domestic
critics to block an invasion of Iraq, if Bush chooses to launch one.</TE>
<TE>   At a more fundamental level, the powerful emotions that bound
together the country after the tragedy suggested Americans still have
a greater sense of connection than many social critics on the left
and right believed--especially after the bitter presidential election
that showed the country divided almost exactly in half between
political coalitions defined mostly by their cultural differences.</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't erased political conflict about issues such as gun
control, abortion or gay rights. But the surge of national unity
after Sept. 11 may put these disputes in a different perspective by
showing how much common ground Americans still share around those
fault lines.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear to me that America's self-perception has changed," one
senior White House official said. "There is a feeling that if you
scratch an American, there's an elemental decency beneath. That's a
source of national unity, and I think it's going to be pretty
durable."</TE>
<TE>   With so much in flux at once, the hard part for policymakers,
analysts and ordinary Americans alike is divining which changes are
durable and which are transitory. The shift in mission toward
combating terrorism looks like a lasting change for federal agencies
from the FBI to the Coast Guard. But the surge in public trust in the
federal government evident in polls immediately after the attacks
already has faded.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, while Bush appears to have crossed a fundamental
threshold in public confidence, that doesn't guarantee that concern
about the economy or disagreements over his policies won't erode his
support before 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Already clear, though, is that the struggle against terrorism will
consume much more of the federal government's attention and money
than seemed possible a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is, if we are serious about homeland security, we are
going to have to spend more money," said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman
(D-Conn.), chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Projecting forward from the amounts already approved, the
Democratic staff on the House Budget Committee recently estimated the
bill for increased homeland security and national defense after Sept.
11 (as well as cleanup of the attack sites and aid for the airline
industry) likely will reach about $600 billion over the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   That's almost certainly too low. In the national strategy it
recently released, Ridge's office said the $40 billion Bush requested
this year for homeland security should be viewed only "as down
payments to cover the most immediate security vulnerabilities."</TE>
<TE>   In dollar terms, the struggle against terrorism still isn't likely
to cost U.S. society nearly as much as our most demanding conflict,
World War II. When the country entered that war, federal spending as
a share of the economy soared from 12% in 1941 to almost 44% in 1944,
the year of D-day.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the Office of Management and Budget projects that,
even with today's additional costs, total federal spending in the
next few years will peak at about 20% of the gross national product,
before settling back into the 18% range where it is today.</TE>
<TE>   But as a management and organizational challenge, the war against
terrorism is probably the federal government's biggest undertaking
since World War II. Experts note that other massive government
projects--such as the lunar landing, the 1960s War on Poverty, or the
reorganization of the national security bureaucracy in the 1940s for
the Cold War--didn't simultaneously ask so many agencies to shoulder
new responsibilities or revamp operations.</TE>
<TE>   The sheer magnitude of the challenge now is, as Ridge put it,
"monstrously complex."</TE>
<TE>   A few examples show the scale.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is stockpiling
270 million doses of smallpox vaccine and enough antibiotics to treat
20 million people exposed to anthrax, while positioning about 600
tons of emergency supplies at secret locations around the country and
accelerating research at the National Institutes of Health on the
next generation of vaccines.</TE>
<TE>   To meet a congressional deadline requiring that all luggage
checked onto airplanes be screened for explosives, the Transportation
Security Administration is trying to deploy, by January, three times
the baggage screening equipment currently in use everywhere in the
world, the National Journal magazine recently reported. At the same
time, the agency needs to hire as many as 7,600 people a month to
meet its deadline to assume control of screening airplane passengers.</TE>
<TE>   On top of all this, Bush has proposed a massive restructuring of
the federal government: a new Department of Homeland Security that
would combine all or parts of 22 federal agencies and have 170,000
employees. Measured by staff, it would instantly become the
third-largest federal department.</TE>
<TE>   So much activity is underway on so many fronts that few, if any,
in Washington think they can keep it all in view. But long-term
implications of this focus are emerging.</TE>
<TE>   In political terms, the increased reliance on federal efforts to
protect Americans from terrorist threats could make it tougher for
conservatives to pursue the anti-government arguments common in the
1980s and 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Though polls show that overall trust in government has receded
almost to its levels before the attacks, "You are not going to have a
return to the discontent with government we had in the early 1990s,
because we need Washington," Kohut said. "That's not to say people
aren't going to have their complaints or worry about big government,
but it's a real climate shift."</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, the rising tab for defense and domestic security could
lastingly crimp Democratic hopes of offensives on issues such as
education, health care and prescription drugs. The competition for
resources may eventually force now-hesitant Democrats to challenge
some defense outlays or seek to retrench Bush's 10-year,
$1.35-trillion tax cut of last year, or both.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, debate may also develop about the strategy the
government has used to meet the terrorist threat--especially if the
U.S. suffers another major attack.</TE>
<TE>   Experts such as Kettl note that, for the most part, Washington has
responded to this challenge the way it did in World War II and the
Cold War: by centralizing power in the capital, either bulking up
existing agencies or creating new ones. Bush's proposal to create the
mammoth Homeland Security Department is a precise modern analogue to
Harry S. Truman's 1949 decision to unify the armed services in a
centralized Department of Defense.</TE>
<TE>   But against such a diffuse threat as terrorism, Kettl and others
argue, in time it may make more sense to follow the model of many
companies in the Information Age and decentralize authority and
initiative to officials closer to the front line of the problem. That
approach, for instance, would provide more freedom to field-level FBI
agents to pursue leads, rather than depending on analysts in
Washington to make connections.</TE>
<TE>   "We have responded to a 21st century problem with a 20th century
approach," Kettl lamented.</TE>
<TE>   It may take years, many false starts and perhaps some painful
reversals before Americans genuinely feel safer. And even then they
may have to live with more uncertainty about security than at any
point since the chilliest early years of the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   "If you believe in what we stand for in this country and accept
that we are ... a freedom-loving people ... very trusting [and] a
nation of immigrants," Ridge said, "endemic within that [is] that we
will never get to a failsafe, I-guarantee-you-you're-safe system."</TE>

<DH>A collection that rivals those of the Getty and other top
museums sits near Philadelphia, all but obscured by legal and
financial problems.</DH>

<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MERION, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Inside the Barnes Foundation, a French Renaissance chateau set in a
fenced arboretum on Philadelphia's western shoulder, hangs one of the
world's most spectacular art collections.</LD>
<LD>   Masterpieces are displayed literally from floor to ceiling:
Cezanne's "Bathers" and "The Card Players," Seurat's "Models," Van
Gogh's signed "Postman." The gallery is so crammed with priceless
works that Matisse's "Joy of Life" is confined to a stairwell.</LD>
<LD>   The Musee d'Orsay in Paris owns 94 works by Renoir. The Barnes has
181. The Museum of Modern Art in New York has 39 by Cezanne. The
Barnes owns 69.</LD>
<TE>   "A-plus, superb, glorious, as good as exists in the world," Barry
Munitz, president of the J. Paul Getty Trust, says of the
collection's masterpieces.</TE>
<TE>   For all its artistic treasures, however, the Barnes remains a
troubled and dysfunctional institution on its 80th anniversary,
weighted down by years of confrontations over art, education and
race. "Our mission has been overshadowed by turmoil," a Barnes
publication acknowledges, with some understatement.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation is suffocating under a crush of lawsuits and is
desperate for money. It has a poisonous relationship with its
neighbors, who videotape visitors and count people arriving inside
buses.</TE>
<TE>   The Barnes is hemmed in by court decisions and zoning rules that
dictate its admission (a mere $5), hours, parking, attendance and art
arrangement. It cannot move its paintings from the wall positions
they have held since 1951. It cannot lend or sell them.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the Barnes' glory, and some of its misery, can be traced
to the iconoclastic beliefs of its founder, Dr. Albert C. Barnes. A
self-made millionaire with a shrewd eye for art, Barnes is considered
a brilliant visionary and champion of social justice by many and a
paranoid and vindictive pedagogue by a few. (Thomas Hart Benton
called him "friendly, kindly, hospitable, and, at the same time, a
ruthless, underhanded son of a bitch.")</TE>
<TE>   The Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings Barnes bought
in France in the 1910s and 1920s were shipped directly to Merion but
not to be hung in a museum. Barnes used them as instructional tools
in gallery classes that taught his theories about art, aesthetics,
light, line, color and space.</TE>
<TE>   The paintings were hung next to African sculpture, Navajo jewelry
and Pennsylvania German blanket chests so that students could
appreciate the similarities among different works of art. Because he
focused on the art and not the artist, Barnes did not attach the
names of paintings or other identifying information. Even now, the
Barnes says it is not a museum; it's a school for art. Its trustees
are named not by curators or art experts but by a small university in
rural Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a Philadelphia letter carrier, Barnes made a fortune
patenting an eye antiseptic. An amateur painter, he attended high
school with painter William Glackens, who later educated Barnes about
art--and how to buy it. To some, Barnes was said to be astute but
overbearing. He offended Gertrude Stein by asking how much she had
paid for Picasso's portrait of her. Barnes "did literally wave his
checkbook in the air," Stein once said.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes died in a car crash in 1951 at age 78. His will and
indenture, along with the foundation's bylaws, are still being
interpreted, debated and dissected 80 years after he chartered the
Barnes "to promote the advancement of education and appreciation of
the fine arts."</TE>
<TE>   The foundation was paralyzed for half a century after his death,
with admission severely restricted and the gallery in disrepair. The
collection has never been fully inventoried. Until the 1990s, there
were no color photos of the paintings and no illustrated catalog.</TE>
<TE>   Kimberly Camp, who announced "We are broke!" shortly after taking
over as executive director in 1998, is struggling to raise money to
keep the foundation alive and still true to Barnes' vision of art as
a vehicle for racial and social justice. She calls it the "first
purposely multicultural collection" in the nation. "Barnes believed
in the power of aesthetics and art to enhance the perceptions of
everyday people and build critical problem-solving skills," Camp
said. And those perceptions "would help build a better democracy and
help eliminate segregation and discrimination," she said. Race is
never far from the surface at the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes, who was white, railed against the overt racism of his
time; he attended black churches and held gospel concerts at the
foundation. He battled white-run cultural institutions and left
control of the Barnes to Lincoln University, a historically African
American school.</TE>
<TE>   In his foundation's bylaws, Barnes stipulated that "the plain
people, that is, men and women who gain their livelihood by daily
toil in shops, factories, schools, stores and similar places, shall
have free access to the art gallery." He wrote of "the rare artistic
and mental endowments of the Negro."</TE>
<TE>   Barnes "hated snobs--those affected English-accent people who were
born with money and who thought therefore that that gave them the
right to things other people shouldn't have," Camp said. He despised
the upper crust art establishment, calling the Philadelphia Museum of
Art "a house of artistic and intellectual prostitution."</TE>
<TE>   He routinely refused the rich and famous permission to view his
masterpieces. When T. S. Eliot asked to drop by, Barnes responded,
"Nuts," according to a biography, "The Devil and Dr. Barnes," by
Howard Greenfeld. James Michener, turned away three times, finally
got in by claiming to be a steel mill worker. Walter P. Chrysler Jr.,
a millionaire art collector, was rejected via a scathing letter from
Barnes' "secretary" that was actually written by Barnes himself.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Albert Einstein was allowed to see the
paintings. So were writer Thomas Mann, actor Edward G. Robinson,
African American operatic singer Marian Anderson and actor Charles
Laughton.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the foundation is in an exclusive, predominantly white,
Main Line neighborhood with stately mansions. When the Barnes emerged
from relative obscurity in the mid-1990s, the crush of new visitors
irked the residents, one of whom has posted a sign on her manicured
lawn that reads: "Warning--Dog bites first, asks questions later."</TE>
<TE>   Both Camp and her predecessor, Richard Glanton, are African
American. In 1996, Glanton filed a federal civil rights lawsuit
accusing the foundation's neighbors and the township zoning board of
racism after neighbors protested his expansion plans. The courts
dismissed the suit, calling it "cynically brought" and "frivolous"
and ordered Glanton to pay the defendants' legal fees.</TE>
<TE>   But that wasn't the end of it. In March, the neighbors sued
Glanton and his lawyers for abuse of process, and they accuse Camp of
trying to evade strict zoning rules that restrict visitors and
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Marmon, an intense, fast-talking management consultant who
lives directly across Latch's Lane from the Barnes, has videotaped
and photographed visitors. He claims Camp is violating rules that
limit tour buses to 26 passengers. He says he has 70 photos of buses
with more than 60 passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Marmon and his neighbors lost a bitter mid-1990s battle to stop
Glanton from expanding visitation. They complained of traffic,
trespassers and the fumes of idling tour buses. Marmon compared
Glanton and other Barnes officials to "carpetbaggers," triggering the
civil rights suit.</TE>
<TE>   Glanton had failed to convince the courts to break the
foundation's bylaws and sell off some of the paintings. But he did
persuade a judge to allow a onetime world tour, "Great French
Paintings from the Barnes Foundation," from 1993 to 1995 that raised
$17 million to renovate the gallery.</TE>
<TE>   The Barnes, though still relatively unknown outside art circles,
was suddenly overrun with art lovers. Visitation was increased from 2
1/2 to three days and from 500 to 1,200 visitors per week.</TE>
<TE>   "They won the battle; they can run their museum on our quiet
residential street," Marmon said, predicting that the Barnes will
face persistent lawsuits. "But they also guaranteed they'll bleed to
death financially. This is going to be ugly."</TE>
<TE>   Marmon said he doesn't object to "those gorgeous paintings" at the
Barnes; he says he tours the gallery occasionally under an assumed
name. "It's the people who control them who have perpetuated this
evil in our community," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Camp, asked about Marmon and other neighbors, paused and said:
"There are several residents who have behaved in a--my attorneys say
I have to say it this way--in my opinion they exhibit unhealthy
social attitudes and sociopathic behavior. Daily. We are harassed
daily."</TE>
<TE>   Marmon recently gave his neighbors and township zoning officials
copies of a British newspaper article in which Camp is quoted as
saying of the neighborhood: "It is so insular that it has kept out
African Americans. After WASPs, Catholics and Jews, blacks are bottom
of the pile."</TE>
<TE>   "Tell that to my black neighbor, the accountant!" Marmon said,
describing himself and many of his neighbors as "liberal Jews."</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Tinari, an engineer who took classes at the Barnes, heads
a watchdog group called "Barnes Watch." Tinari claims a fund-raising
reception held by Camp at the foundation violates Barnes' bylaws,
which forbid "any society functions, commonly designated receptions,
tea parties, dinners, banquets, dances, musicales or similar
affairs." (A judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by Marmon seeking to
ban future fund-raisers.)</TE>
<TE>   Camp said fund-raiser traffic moved through a rear gate and did
not affect neighbors on Latch's Lane. When asked to describe the
event, Camp laughed and said: "It was Marmon and Nick Tinari across
the street, making faces and shifting from leg to leg, taking
pictures of people's cars and license plates."</TE>
<TE>   She described the neighbors' strategy as "keeping the foundation
tied up in court with ridiculous legal battles until we run out of
money and the state will take over and you people will be gone."</TE>
<TE>   The Barnes spent nearly $6 million on legal fees in the 1990s;
Camp has reduced the foundation's law firms from four to two. The
Barnes endowment, $10 million in 1951, was so poorly invested that it
was still $10 million almost four decades later. Camp spent the last
of it in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   A recent audit estimated that the Barnes needs $85 million to
ensure its long-term survival, including $15 million over the next
five years for a "stabilization fund."</TE>
<TE>   Several banks and foundations have donated $100,000 to $500,000
each, but the Barnes is still in a deep financial hole. And the
corporate funding has drawn the ire of Barnes Watch: "Dr. Barnes
would be appalled with the idea of using the artwork as a vehicle for
a corporate logo," Tinari said.</TE>
<TE>   Camp says it costs the Barnes $60 to admit each visitor for $5.
She said a more reasonable fee would be $10 or $12. She'd also like
to see annual visitation raised from 62,400 to as high as 150,000.</TE>
<TE>   The neighbors say Camp has turned the Barnes into a museum--not
the educational institution stipulated by Barnes. The foundation is
zoned as an educational institution with limited accessory use as a
gallery.</TE>
<TE>   The gallery has many accouterments of a museum--a gift shop,
headphone rentals, a $10-per-car parking lot. But visits are by
appointment only, and tour buses must park at a remote lot.</TE>
<TE>   With its idiosyncratic "ensembles," the Barnes is certainly no
typical art gallery. Impressionist paintings are hung over doorways
and beside metal works, Navajo blankets, ceramics and antique
chairs--all precisely the way they stood the day Barnes died.
Overlooking the main gallery is a magnificent mural, "Le Dance,"
painted by Matisse at Barnes' request in 1931. "It's an exploration,
not just a viewing," said Courtney Waring, Barnes' assistant
education director.</TE>
<TE>   A visit to the Barnes is both disorienting and breathtaking. "You
could go to museums around Europe and find two or three pieces you'd
give your life for. You'd do that for dozens of pieces at the
Barnes," Munitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Camp said the Barnes remains primarily an educational institution.
She emphasizes the art classes (tuition: $650 per academic year) and
the schoolchildren who visit.</TE>
<TE>   The Barnes earns half of its $4-million annual budget through
admission and parking, tuition, the gift shop and reproduction
rights, Camp said.</TE>
<TE>   Munitz, of the Getty Trust, which has given the Barnes $500,000
and technical expertise, said the foundation must raise "a prodigious
amount of money" to survive. The question, he said, is "whether it
can hold steady to its core beliefs but is still able to be
programmatically and financially alive."</TE>
<TE>   Munitz added: "They've bounced off the bottom. They are headed in
the right direction, but they have a long way to go."</TE>
<TE>   With a collection valued at roughly $25 billion, in Camp's
estimation, the Barnes is fabulously wealthy on paper. A single Van
Gogh from another collection sold for $82.5 million 10 years ago; the
Barnes has seven Van Goghs--and 60 Matisses, 44 Picassos, 18
Rousseaus and 11 Degases.</TE>
<TE>   Camp said the foundation has no plans to seek court permission to
sell any of its art. But the courts have granted permission to lend
paintings now in storage, many of which hang in the foundation's
private offices and have not been seen by the public in 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Camp said she will continue to raise money while fighting off
lawsuits and improving what a Barnes publication calls "strained
relationships with members of our community." "We are trying to
repair that relationship, but there is still such animosity that we
have not been able to get to a place of reason," Camp said.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Herman, a retired physician who lives across from the
Barnes, said Camp has "acted like a good neighbor, for the most
part." He added: "But we can't be too buddy-buddy until the
litigation is settled."</TE>
<TE>   Marmon said he would not object to 1 million Barnes visitors a
year, as long as the foundation agrees to his terms, which include
building a new driveway to the Barnes entrance that doesn't feed into
his street. He calls it the "Getty solution," a reference to the way
the Getty museum handled residents' complaints about traffic and
crowds.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the Barnes meets his demands, Marmon said, "we're trapped
in this cycle of confrontation, and sooner or later the Barnes goes
bankrupt."</TE>
<TE>   Camp said people are passionate about the Barnes because it is so
magnificent and so unique.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody in the past 50 years has done anything out of malice," to
the Barnes, Camp said. "They've just wrapped their arms around it so
tightly, they almost choked it to death."</TE>

<HD>With Unemployment Rising, Bush Vows to Focus on Jobs</HD>
<DH>Economy: In a speech to the carpenters union, the president
urges Congress to pass bills that would put Americans back to work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEVILLE ISLAND, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Faced with rising unemployment nationwide, President Bush vowed
Monday to work tirelessly to create jobs, and he called on Congress
to approve legislation that he said would put hundreds of thousands
of Americans back to work.</LD>
<LD>   "What I worry about is when I hear the stories of people who can't
work," Bush said in Labor Day remarks to members of the United
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America.</LD>
<LD>   "And so we've got to make sure that we continue to focus on jobs."</LD>
<TE>   The president also cited a number of positive economic
indicators--"interest rates are low ... inflation is low ...
productivity is up"--and he added:</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm not satisfied. And neither should you be. And neither
should the United States Congress."</TE>
<TE>   His remarks underscored anew his determination to escape the fate
of his father, who waged a popular war to liberate Kuwait only to be
turned out of the White House by voters who felt that he had paid
insufficient attention to the nation's economy.</TE>
<TE>   More Jobless Claims</TE>
<TE>   For three straight weeks last month, the Labor Department reported
that growing numbers of Americans had filed new claims for
unemployment insurance--a trend that surprised many economists.</TE>
<TE>   The number of Americans continuing to collect jobless benefits
jumped by 90,000, to 3.6 million, for the week ending Aug. 17, the
most recent period for which the information is available.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. unemployment rate--now at 5.9%--could hit 6.3% or 6.5% by
the fall, some economists fear.</TE>
<TE>   The carpenters union, which sponsored the Labor Day picnic where
Bush spoke, quit the AFL-CIO in March 2000 over policy disputes with
the strongly pro-Democratic Party labor federation. The
300,000-member union since has become one of the president's favorite
labor organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Its president, Douglas J. McCarron, flew here with Bush aboard Air
Force One--the second consecutive Labor Day that the two men have
spent together.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron also played a prominent role at Bush's economic forum in
Waco, Texas, on Aug. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's growing ties to the carpenters union is part of a concerted
effort to break the long-standing coziness between the labor movement
and the Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   The president also has assiduously courted the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, which also has broken with the AFL-CIO. The
Teamsters union has sided with Bush on some of his top initiatives,
including opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and
natural gas exploration.</TE>
<TE>   By exploiting rifts in the labor movement, the president not only
has drained support from Democrats but has also enhanced his standing
among blue-collar workers.</TE>
<TE>   "There are obviously some union leaders who have the willingness
to put national interests above partisan party interests," said White
House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer. "There are other union leaders
who are really appendages of the Democratic National Committee."</TE>
<TE>   In the two years before the 2000 elections, unions and their
members donated $90 million to candidates and parties--with 94% of
that going to Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   A Hectic Two Months</TE>
<TE>   The president's remarks in this Pittsburgh suburb along the Ohio
River also signaled the start of a hectic two months before the
November elections, in which the entire House of Representatives, 34
Senate seats and 36 governorships will be at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Bush returned to the White House on Sunday afternoon after a
monthlong working vacation at his ranch near Crawford, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Congress also returns to Washington this week, facing a panoply of
thorny issues, including passage of a federal budget and a decision
on whether to create a Department of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the agenda is the growing debate over Bush's plan to
effect a "regime change" in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The president sees this as a window to get things done for the
country, particularly in terms of enacting homeland security into
law," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush today is scheduled to host a bipartisan group of senators to
discuss the legislation, which was approved by the House but is
stalled in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks here, Bush also urged Congress to pass his energy
legislation and a terrorism insurance bill that would allow $8
billion worth of commercial construction projects to go forward.</TE>
<TE>   The legislative delay is preventing "300,000 workers" from
working, Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Day outing was Bush's 13th trip as president to
Pennsylvania, which he narrowly lost to Al Gore in 2000.</TE>

<HD>Charter School Students Scoring Below Their Public Peers,
Study Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Students in charter schools, often seen as an alternative to failing
neighborhood schools, are scoring significantly below public school
pupils in basic reading and math, a study shows.</LD>
<LD>   Charter school students were anywhere from half a year to a full
year behind their public school peers, researchers at the Brookings
Institution here concluded after reviewing 1999-2000 reading and math
achievement test scores of 376 charter schools in 10 states.</LD>
<LD>   The study, the first independent snapshot of charter school
performance across the nation, found that 59% of students at
traditional public schools scored better than charter school students
during the period studied.</LD>
<TE>   The findings don't necessarily reflect poorly on charter schools,
which often attract students who are looking for a way to improve
their skills, the authors caution.</TE>
<TE>   In a few states, such as Texas, these schools seek out such
pupils, said Tom Loveless, a senior fellow at the Brown Center on
Education Policy at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think
tank. "They're out looking for kids who are low-achieving," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne Allen, president of the Center for Education Reform, a
Washington organization that advocates for charter schools, said more
information is needed about how much students learn after they've
spent a few years attending a charter school.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the kids who were much more likely to fall through the
cracks before anybody else," she said. "That's who tends to leave
their school and join up."</TE>
<TE>   Charter schools are public schools that have signed an agreement
with their states to improve students' education, often by
unconventional means.</TE>
<TE>   Generally overseen by an independent board and given greater
freedom over budgets, hiring and purchasing, charter schools can be
opened by nonprofit groups, churches, universities, community
centers, parents, teachers and school districts themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Many charter schools specialize in helping children from
inner-city neighborhoods, with smaller enrollments and different
approaches to learning that aren't generally accepted in traditional
public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Charter schools have met with resistance by teachers unions and
many in the educational establishment who say they often hire
unlicensed and nonunion teachers. Because charter schools' finances
aren't always closely scrutinized, they sometimes close after only a
few years because of financial mismanagement.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, the schools' tenacity has earned them a
place in the education debate. About 2,400 charter schools served
more than half a million children during the 2001-2002 school year.
More than half of those schools--about 1,300--opened in the last
three years. Allen said nearly 400 are opening this fall.</TE>
<TE>   The Brookings study looked at schools in California, Arizona,
Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania,
Texas and Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers found that scores of urban charter school students
were no worse than others, but suburban and rural charter schools had
much lower scores. They also found that about 38% of charter school
students come from poor families--the same as in public schools.</TE>
<TE>   But charter schools serve a slightly higher percentage of black
and Latino students than their more traditional counterparts, the
study found.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congress returns today to a backlog of major issues--including U.S.
policy toward Iraq, homeland security and the federal budget--a pile
of unfinished business so vast that many lawmakers are resigned to
holding a lame-duck session after the November elections.</LD>
<LD>   The crushing workload has twin sources: partisan tensions that
have slowed basic budget decisions, and bipartisan determination to
tackle such time-consuming initiatives as creating a vast new
Department of Homeland Security.</LD>
<LD>   What's more, Congress immediately will be drawn into an escalating
debate about whether to go to war with Iraq--an issue that has been
catapulted to new prominence during the month Congress has been on
summer recess.</LD>
<TE>   Campaigns Come First</TE>
<TE>   Many crucial decisions may be put off until after election day
because congressional leaders are eager to send vulnerable incumbents
home to campaign in races that could determine which party controls
the House and the Senate next year.</TE>
<TE>   Even if final decisions are deferred, debate in Congress over the
coming weeks will influence which of two sets of issues are foremost
in voters' minds when they go to the polls Nov. 5: concerns about the
economy and corporate scandals--which Democrats want to spotlight--or
anxieties about terrorism and national security, which play to
Republican strengths.</TE>
<TE>   And the decisions left facing lawmakers this session have
consequences that will be felt far into the future. The homeland
security agency could give the president broad new powers for years
to come.</TE>
<TE>   The emerging budget, with its big increases for defense and
homeland safety, will affect how long the government will run a
deficit. And any decision to go to war with Iraq will require a huge
financial, military and political commitment.</TE>
<TE>   Although the legislative legacy of this session includes
accomplishments--a new law cracking down on corporate corruption, for
one, and major anti-terrorism initiatives--some incumbents facing
reelection worry that it will reflect badly on them if Congress does
not finish its work before the elections.</TE>
<TE>   "It will add to the perception that we can't get our work done,"
said Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who is in a tough fight for
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Sessions More Common</TE>
<TE>   Lame-duck sessions are historically rare, but becoming less so.
There have been six postelection sessions since 1971, three of them
since 1994. The last one was in 2000, when Congress finished budget
work under a cloud of uncertainty about who won the presidential
election. Before that, the House met after the 1998 election to vote
on President Clinton's impeachment.</TE>
<TE>   When the Senate reconvenes today, and the House returns Wednesday,
it will be for a session opening deep in the shadow of the first
anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon. Members of Congress will travel Friday to
New York City for a special session to commemorate the tragedy that
leveled the twin towers.</TE>
<TE>   The first issue before the Senate is legislation to create the new
Homeland Security Department. The bill has been approved by the
House, but the Senate version has been slowed by Democrats, led by
Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who object to rushing action on
such a significant change in government.</TE>
<TE>   Central to the debate is the Democrats' refusal to exempt agency
workers from civil rights protections, as President Bush has
proposed.</TE>
<TE>   He has threatened a veto on the issue, saying the administration
needs more flexibility to manage the security agency.</TE>
<TE>   "I refuse to accept a bill which ties my hands or the hands of
future presidents," Bush said. But Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.)
has accused the administration of "dragging this common cause into
the quicksand of controversy" in order to seize more power for the
executive branch.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional debate concerning Iraq will be spotlighted in the
House International Relations Committee, where chairman Henry J. Hyde
(R-Ill.) is lining up administration witnesses for hearings this
month. Other committees are expected to weigh in with hearings, but
it is not clear when--and in what form--Congress will bring the issue
of what to do about Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to a vote. Some
lawmakers say they hope it is not anytime soon, because their
constituents do not seem prepared for a U.S. attack on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "My calls are overwhelmingly negative," said Rep. Jane Harman
(D-Venice). "People are baffled."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats will be trying to ensure that the focus on national
security issues does not eclipse concerns about the economy and
corporate accounting scandals--which they made the topic of their
Labor Day weekend radio address.</TE>
<TE>   "Our economic prosperity has disappeared on the Republicans'
watch," said Rep. Martin Frost (D-Texas). "We must pull together to
get our economy back on the right track."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate's Democratic leaders plan to bring up legislation to
increase protections for people who participate in 401(k) retirement
plans--to avoid some of the troubles caused by this year's collapse
of Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans also are planning an initiative to demonstrate further
concern for the victims of corporate malfeasance and the roiling
stock market. Bush and House Republicans are considering a new round
of tax cuts to provide relief for people who suffer heavy investment
losses, and to give people more leeway in deciding when to withdraw
money from their 401(k) plans.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-Corporate Feelings</TE>
<TE>   Those measures are given little chance of passing the
Democrat-controlled Senate, but Republicans' interest is a sign of
political concern about anti-corporate sentiment among voters.</TE>
<TE>   "People are still very angry out here about corporate corruption,"
said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).</TE>
<TE>   An enormous challenge facing Congress is its year-end budget
debate. Lawmakers are way behind schedule, having passed none of the
13 appropriations bills needed to finance the government after Oct.
1, when the 2003 fiscal year begins.</TE>
<TE>   There is broad bipartisan support for increasing spending for
defense and homeland security, despite recent reports of a large and
growing budget deficit. To compensate, Bush and conservative House
Republicans want to clamp down on spending in other areas, but they
may not have enough votes to curb spending in politically popular
programs such as education right before an election.</TE>
<TE>   Bush gave a preview of the kinds of tough choices to come when he
announced in August that, in the name of fiscal discipline, he would
refuse to spend $5 billion of the $29 billion Congress provided in a
midyear spending bill--including funds for such popular programs as
aid for local firefighting forces and the Coast Guard.</TE>
<TE>   The longer it takes Congress to finish those must-pass spending
bills, the more time they will have to get other pending legislation
across the finish line, including a measure to rewrite federal energy
policy. Lawmakers say the bill probably will emerge from a
House-Senate conference committee if Bush gives up on his
proposal--vehemently opposed by Senate Democrats--to expand oil
drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</TE>
<TE>   Another major bill on the brink of final action is a rewrite of
the bankruptcy code, which is facing eleventh-hour opposition because
of abortion-related provisions. Gaining momentum is a long-stalled
bill to make the federal government an insurer of last resort for
damage caused by terrorist acts.</TE>
<TE>   Also likely to clear is a bill to beef up security in the nation's
ports and an election-reform measure to help states update aging
voting equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Less certain is whether the Senate will have the time to finish a
rewrite of the landmark 1996 welfare reform law; if not, it will be
put off to next year.</TE>

<HD>FBI Lauds Loosening of Surveillance Regulations</HD>
<DH>Security: Agents say old rules hamstrung them. Other say
revisions have gone too far, too fast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long before the world knew Buford Furrow for his violent rampage at
an L.A. Jewish community center, the avowed white supremacist was
familiar to the FBI.</LD>
<LD>   A follower of the racist group Aryan Nations, Furrow had been
among those watched for years by FBI agents who monitor the country's
home-grown terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   But when Furrow parted ways with Aryan Nations in 1998, agents no
longer had permission to trail him. "Because we were watching the
group and not an individual, we were not allowed to follow him,"
recalled one law enforcement official.</LD>
<TE>   Whether keeping tabs on Furrow could have prevented his 1999
attack in Los Angeles is anyone's guess. But current and former
agents insist the restriction illustrates how federal regulations in
place before the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon hamstrung the FBI's anti-terrorism efforts for years.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying--and I don't think anybody in the FBI is
saying--that if we had this law or this guideline changed we would
have been able to prevent Sept. 11," said Bill Gore, special agent in
charge of the FBI's San Diego office. "But there were certain
restrictions that needed revisiting."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last four decades, the regulations guiding the conduct of
FBI counter-terrorism agents have whipsawed back and forth, from
virtually nonexistent under former Director J. Edgar Hoover to highly
strict in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Restrictions were eased again after the terrorist attacks last
year. First the USA Patriot Act, approved soon after the attacks,
expanded the government's authority to monitor private conversations
and e-mail and eased the requirements for deporting noncitizens
suspected of endangering national security. Then regulations
announced in May, by U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft allowed agents to
search the Internet for terrorist material, attend any event open to
the public, and extend preliminary investigations for as long as a
year without approval from headquarters in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But recently, questions have been raised about whether the new
post-Sept. 11 guidelines went too far, too fast. The Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act court, concerned about new efforts to
broaden the bureau's spying abilities, recently ordered Ashcroft to
cut back on search warrants and wiretaps. The Justice Department has
appealed the decision.</TE>
<TE>   James X. Dempsey, deputy director for the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a Washington-based civil liberties group, believes that
the guidelines in place before Sept. 11 gave FBI agents plenty of
latitude to investigate suspected terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "What they were required to do is focus their investigations on
groups or individuals suspected of being involved in terrorism," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, agents complained for years that they faced more
restrictions pursuing international terrorists than they did on
teenage street gang members.</TE>
<TE>   They say rules adopted after Sept. 11 have greatly streamlined
their efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Under the old rules, for example, FBI agents asking the FISA court
for permission to use surveillance were required to identify
suspected terrorists as agents of a specific foreign power. But that
often proved impossible, either because a suspect could not be linked
to a specific hostile country or because the ability to make that
connection hinged on court-ordered surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   Some FBI agents say those problems led to the bureau not seeking a
warrant in the summer of 2001 against suspected "20th hijacker"
Zacarias Moussaoui, who was jailed in Minneapolis on an immigration
violation.</TE>
<TE>   "The intelligence guidelines were such that we were able to do
some basic checks and that was about it," said Nancy Savage, who
heads the FBI Agents Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "But when we were just trying to find out about someone who maybe
hadn't committed an act but we had reasonable belief was affiliated
with terrorist groups, we were really hamstrung."</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of attention has been paid since Sept. 11 to the college
and university records of potential terrorists or their associates,
but the FBI was restricted from examining those records until
recently.</TE>
<TE>   To obtain the student records of someone they suspected of being
involved in espionage, authorities were required to persuade a court
that there was justification to bypass the federal statute.</TE>
<TE>   But to do that could require them to disclose sources or present
classified information in a federal court not equipped to handle top
secret evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no way to protect that classified information" from
being released, Gore said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities now have greater access to the FISA court to make a
case for obtaining student records.</TE>
<TE>   Under the old Justice Department guidelines, FBI agents also faced
the time-consuming prospect of vetting anti-terrorism investigations
through headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   During the mid-1980s, a domestic terrorism unit had to wait for
FBI headquarters to authorize a full-scale investigation into a group
of white radicals called the Arizona Patriots, even though the FBI
had heard that they were plotting an armored car robbery.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI eventually got approval from Justice for an undercover
agent who infiltrated the group and determined that two members were
planning to blow up a synagogue in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   "Had he not been there, that might have occurred," former Phoenix
agent Ron Myers said. "And had we been stalled any longer, the
potential for other violence with this group was significant."</TE>
<TE>   The old rules also hampered the FBI in other, illogical, ways
current and former agents say.</TE>
<TE>   "If I wanted to go surf the Internet and check out public
entities, I could do that as John Q. Public," Los Angeles agent
Stephen Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   But until the new rules were in place, FBI counter-terrorism
specialists such as Moore were precluded from simply scanning Web
sites on a computer unless they had a reasonable suspicion that a
group was committing a crime.</TE>
<TE>   The same sorts of restrictions applied to agents who considered
monitoring a public gathering with a hunch--but no hard
evidence--that its participants were terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember one day sitting in the office and watching a bunch of
people demonstrating outside the federal building" in Westwood, where
the Los Angeles FBI offices are located, Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew some of the people in that crowd but we could not go down
there. We literally could not go on our own lawn because they had a
right to protest and we would be violating their rights with a
surveillance."</TE>
<TE>   Under the rules announced by Ashcroft in May, agents can take part
in the same activities available to the public--be it online browsing
or eyeing a demonstration.</TE>
<TE>   But many critics wonder if FBI agents will stop there.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we condemn the attacks of Sept. 11," said Wendy Patten
of Human Rights Watch. "But we have to be very careful, that in
pursuing this investigation, that we uphold the very values President
Bush has said were under attack on Sept. 11. Values like openness,
government accountability and the rule of law."</TE>
<TE>   In this new age of terrorism, current and former agents say the
FBI no longer can play by old rules.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the American public realizes now," Gore said, "that the
only way we are going to prevent future acts of terrorism is through
aggressive intelligence gathering in the United States and abroad."</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM SILVERTON, ORE.</KH>
<HD>Clock Is Ticking for Penny Meters</HD>
<DH>Coins: Town is phasing out its 1-cent parking in favor of
digital devices, dealing one more blow to the endangered piece of
change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SILVERTON, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Even here, in a town with a covered bridge and a painted tribute to
Bobbie, the beloved dog that found his way home from Indiana in 1924,
time is money.</LD>
<LD>   Silverton's broken penny-parking meters are being replaced, one at
a time, with digital ones that accept only nickels, dimes and
quarters. Many residents ignore the pun and gripe: It's too much
change.</LD>
<LD>   "They're cranky and protective, but that's OK," said City Manager
Bryan Cosgrove. "It's local tradition."</LD>
<TE>   To residents of this agricultural center about 40 miles southeast
of Portland, the penny-parking debacle symbolizes the ease with which
cherished aspects of their life could disappear. To them, Silverton's
values are represented as much by the meters as they are by the low
crime rate, clean streets and fresh pots of blooming flowers that
hang from immaculate gas lamps.</TE>
<TE>   Melia Ragone, the owner of Window Box Quilts on First Street--a
road lined with functioning penny parking meters--said tourists who
pull up outside and discover the machines bound into the store
feeling like they've already discovered a bargain.</TE>
<TE>   A penny buys you 12 minutes. A dime gets you two hours.</TE>
<TE>   "We asked the police chief how long it would take to lose all of
them, and he said 10 years," Ragone said, making it clear that a
decade in Silverton could pass in the blink of an eye.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the City Council's decision to let the copper-plated coin
die a slow, unheroic death in the ashtrays of motorists pulling into
parking spots appears to be the latest evidence that Silverton is
being dragged--kicking and screaming--into the modern world.</TE>
<TE>   First there was the brouhaha last spring over the old noon
whistle, a foghorn on a pole in the city hall parking lot that also
doubles as the volunteer firemen's signal.</TE>
<TE>   A few citizens and city hall workers complained about the volume,
and a measurement showed that the daily bleat exceeded noise levels
mandated by the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than risk being sued by someone who claimed they'd suffered
hearing loss, Cosgrove silenced the horn until officials could figure
out a way to make it comply with guidelines. That brought accusations
from many of the 7,500 townspeople that Cosgrove was moving too fast.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the penny parking decision was announced this summer,
many residents were phoning city hall and spitting out epithets like
"money-grubbers."</TE>
<TE>   But Cosgrove insists the decision is not profitable, just
practical. No one makes parts for penny meters any more, and many of
the 160 installed here back in the 1940s are busted.</TE>
<TE>   If it's any consolation--and many say it's not--Silverton joins
some other cities that will, in the next few years, lose all of their
penny parking meters to ones that accept only silver.</TE>
<TE>   Already watching their dinosaur meters become extinct are
Carrollton, Ohio; Fairfield, Iowa; Billings, Mont.; Tionesta, Pa.;
and Hinsdale, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Programs to slowly phase the old meters out may be trumped by
federal legislation to ditch the penny altogether, through price
rounding to the nearest nickel. Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.), who wants
only limited production for penny collectors, hasn't found a
co-sponsor for the bill. But it still threatens penny advocates like
Mark Weller, executive director of Americans for Common Cents, a
Washington, D.C.-based coalition of 10 national and local charities
that depend on the penny for thousands of dollars in donations each
year.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that there are still some of those meters in place
proves our point that the penny still matters, and rounding things to
a nickel is a real losing venture for the consumer," Weller said.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer concerns aside, a few folks in Silverton think the
celebrated penny parking meters really have brought joy to only two
women--the parking enforcement officers.</TE>
<TE>   "They get you if you're over two minutes," said Richard
Ridderbusch, co-owner of the Birdhouse Restaurant. "This is a real
hot debate in town. Everyone's got an opinion about it."</TE>
<TE>   Parking is monitored Monday through Saturday, and Officer
Christina Rudelis says she sometimes accepts tourists' $5 fines in
cash, as long as they seal the envelopes themselves.</TE>
<TE>   On a daily basis, she writes about five tickets, but remembers a
Saturday when she wrote 37.</TE>
<TE>   And if Rudelis is already mourning the penny parking, so are some
of Silverton's younger residents--who like to stay one or two cars
ahead of the law and put coins into nearly expired meters.</TE>
<TE>   Jamon Wanker, a 25-year-old glassblower who was raised here,
fished for a few coins and fed some meters as he walked one recent
afternoon with a friend. Reflecting on the nostalgia of penny parking
meters, Wanker was reminded of another melancholy subject.</TE>
<TE>   "I miss the horn," he said.</TE>

<HD>Would-Be Immigrants to U.S. in an Uncertain Holding Pattern</HD>
<DH>Security: Scrutiny after 9/11 prevents thousands living in
refugee camps from starting new lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Tightened security imposed after Sept. 11 has, at least temporarily,
prevented thousands of people living in squalid refugee camps from
starting new lives in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Increased scrutiny of applicants has produced a sharp decline in
the number of refugees--particularly Muslims--accepted by the State
Department for U.S. resettlement.</LD>
<LD>   Officials expect that only half, at best, of the 70,000 refugees
projected for resettlement during the year ending Sept. 30 will
arrive in the country.</LD>
<TE>   Before the terrorist attacks Sept. 11, many of those in limbo had
been approved for travel to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   And as one outgrowth of the new concern over terrorism, a higher
percentage of Muslims have remained on the waiting list for
resettlement than refugees of any other category.</TE>
<TE>   The ceiling for the Muslim-rich Near East and South Asia region is
15,000, but with less than a month left in the fiscal year, only
2,539 had been admitted from those areas, according to official
figures.</TE>
<TE>   During the last fiscal year, 12,060 refugees from these regions
were accepted, compared with a ceiling of 12,500.</TE>
<TE>   As part of post-Sept. 11 security measures, all male refugees
between ages 15 and 50 from Muslim countries who are candidates for
resettlement must undergo FBI scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI issues "security advisory opinions" on each candidate to
determine whether any could pose a security risk. The same check is
given to applicants for U.S. visas from Muslim countries.</TE>
<TE>   The declining number of admissions of Muslims and non-Muslims has
severe implications for those forced to wait. Virtually all have fled
persecution and now are confined to a dreary and sometimes dangerous
life at camps sponsored by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Of the world's 12 million refugees, the largest number are in
Africa. Five of the eight leading refugee-producing countries are in
Africa. That continent also is the region with the highest U.S.
ceiling for refugee resettlement: 22,000 for the current fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic countries that have produced the most refugees are
Afghanistan, Sudan and Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Dewey, the State Department's top official for refugees, said
he is hopeful that procedures can be streamlined.</TE>
<TE>   "The task is to balance the need to provide protection to as many
as possible who need protection and to protect the people of the
United States from evildoers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that racial profiling is a component of the
mandatory FBI evaluation of Muslim male refugee candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "If it takes profiling, then that's what you have to do," Dewey
said. "You know what the vulnerable sources are. So it's something
you can't take a risk with."</TE>
<TE>   Lavinia Limon, executive director of the private U.S. Committee
for Refugees, acknowledges that security concerns are important but
suggests they could be exaggerated in the case of refugees.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last 35 years, 2 million refugees have been admitted to
the United States," she said. "So far none have been implicated in
terrorist acts. The idea of using the refugee program to come to the
U.S. for terrorism is farfetched."</TE>
<TE>   She said the purpose of the refugee program is to rescue people
who are fleeing terror.</TE>
<TE>   She noted that people who are forced out of their own countries
gain U.N. designation as refugees by making the case that "they have
experienced repression and would experience it all over again if they
are forced to return."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Stein of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, an
anti-immigration group, says stricter security for refugee admissions
is justified.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason why flow is slow is the need to make sure we know who
we are dealing with," he said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LADYSMITH, Wis.</DL>
<LD>A tornado ripped apart a northwestern Wisconsin town Monday, leveling
a Baptist church and a gas station and injuring dozens of people,
witnesses and officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The twister hit Ladysmith--a town of 4,000 about 60 miles
northeast of Eau Claire--at 4:30 p.m., the National Weather Service
said. Television footage showed there was nothing left of several
downtown businesses.</LD>
<LD>   "Most of the town is a disaster. There's buildings missing, down,
torn apart--everything," said Christine Wright, an employee at a
downtown gas station. "They're shutting the town down."</LD>
<TE>   Gov. Scott McCallum declared Ladysmith a disaster area and planned
to visit today, spokesman Tim Roby said.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty people were treated at Rusk Memorial Hospital, with 18
released and the others with non-life-threatening injuries,
administrator Mike Shaw said.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Zajec, who owns a radio station in Ladysmith, told KARE-TV
in Minneapolis that the Baptist church and an Amoco gas station were
leveled and that the top floors of a motel and the fire department
roof were ripped off.</TE>
<TE>   "There was like no warning," she said. "It was just there ...
right in the center of downtown."</TE>
<TE>   A second tornado hit north of Wausau, said Roy Eckberg, a
meteorologist in the weather service's Green Bay office.</TE>

<HD>Battle Over Water in Rain-Soaked Paradise</HD>
<DH>Hawaii: Lines are drawn over a plan to tap Maui's aquifers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ULUPALAKUA, Hawaii</DL>
<LD>Sumner Erdman grazes his cattle on the wide slopes of southwestern
Maui, where pastures normally get 32 inches of rain a year. But last
year was so dry that his cows trampled down fences to get to water;
their calves were thin and thirsty. Standing here, Erdman can look
across the valley to the mountains, where there's so much
water--almost 500 inches annually--that it seems to hang suspended in
the air. From his vantage point, it is easy to see why this island,
in many people's minds a rain-soaked tropical paradise, is bracing
for a water war.</LD>
<LD>   There is in fact plenty of water on Maui, hydrologists say. But
it's not in the right place. Two decades of booming construction and
tourism in central and southern Maui have heavily drawn down the main
aquifer. And it will take even more water--10 million gallons more a
day--over the next two decades to serve the projected new homes, golf
courses and condominiums.</LD>
<TE>   So county officials are looking to plentiful aquifers on the other
side of the island. But a $49-million plan to build wells and
pipelines in eastern Maui has been tied up in a court challenge.
Conservationists fear it will damage streams in some of the island's
loveliest rain forests; small farmers and longtime residents complain
that the plan will pump much-needed water out of their neighborhoods
and ship it to the other side of the island to benefit powerful land
developers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, folks like Erdman complain that they've watched the
county spend millions delivering water to new commercial developments
while their own lines run dry. "The problem Maui has right now is
trying to come to some sort of middle ground on [development]. We're
very far from getting there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the high-altitude communities near Kula, above central Maui,
some residents have been waiting more than 10 years for reliable
water supplies. Elliott Krash and her neighbors have had to install a
private system that pumps water from below at significant expense;
many nearby residents have only low-quality water or very low
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "There are more than 800 people on the list" who are waiting for
reliable water supplies, Krash said. At a recent meeting to decide
how some newly available supplies might be apportioned, she said,
"there were people in tears. People yelling and screaming. People who
stood up and said, 'My father died waiting for this water.' "</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, critics are demanding a complete accounting of the
available water for this island of 117,600 residents. Maui is facing
one of the highest growth rates in the state, but it has never
conducted a sophisticated study of how much water it has--or even how
much is being pumped out of the ground every day.</TE>
<TE>   "We're already using more than a million gallons a day more [in
central and southern Maui] than we're responsibly supposed to take
out of the ground," said Jonathan Starr, a member of the Maui Board
of Water Supply. "There's no management. It's like the wild, wild
West."</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture always has had first dibs on water on Maui, home to
Hawaii's last big sugar cane plantations. The East Maui Irrigation
Co., the water arm of the powerful grower and developer Alexander &amp;
Baldwin Inc., controls 85% of the surface water available for
development. The company diverts about 160 million gallons a day out
of the eastern rain forests and streams and into its sugar cane
fields under a leasing contract  with the county. By contrast, the
county delivers only 35 million gallons a day to island residents.</TE>
<TE>   The company gradually is converting many of those fields to
commercial development, including a world-class resort at Wailea--a
community that looks like a tropical wonderland but is built on arid
land that sprouts cactus when it's not watered.</TE>
<TE>   County water officials say predictions of water shortfalls that
have come with such growth are premature. They can meet future
demand, they say, but it will take substantial investments in wells
and pipelines.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've basically been trying to do over the last 10 years is
to catch up with the fact that no additional water was developed
during the 1980s, and that was a really high growth time," said David
Craddick, water supply director. "We have the ground water
availability.... The problem is, the water is not where the people
are."</TE>
<TE>   For years, Maui has relied on water from the large Iao aquifer
under the central part of the island. But demand increased by nearly
750,000 gallons a day each year over the last decade, although it has
slowed a bit in the last couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, the island was pumping 9.7 million gallons a day out of
the aquifer. By 1996, that figure had doubled to what the U.S.
Geological Survey determined was the aquifer's maximum sustainable
yield.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Meyer, who recently retired as USGS regional director, said
the agency came to realize that, even at the usage level considered
sustainable, the aquifer was falling so much that salt from the
surrounding seawater was making its way in.</TE>
<TE>   The county since has eased back to 18 million gallons a day.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government's aquifer yield estimate is crucial in
determining who controls the water. If the county pumps too close to
the maximum, state law provides that the state water commission will
come in and manage the aquifer. (Meredith Ching, Alexander &amp;
Baldwin's vice president, recently was named by Gov. Ben Cayetano to
the panel. Conservationists who have petitioned for state control say
they cannot imagine a scenario under which Ching would favor granting
the state substantial new oversight over Alexander &amp; Baldwin's water
usage on Maui.)</TE>
<TE>   One thing almost everyone can agree on is that if Maui is to meet
the needs of future development, officials will have to look beyond
the Iao aquifer. The proposed wells in eastern Maui should easily
deliver that amount. But critics say the project is compromised by
the surface water already taken by East Maui Irrigation.</TE>
<TE>   Through an elaborate, 75-mile-long network of irrigation
ditches--considered one of the engineering marvels of the world when
it was completed in 1923--the water is collected from all over
eastern Maui and carried to the sugar plantations. Conservationists
fear that pumping out the ground water below the streams will leave
the waterways too dry to recover.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these streams are already diverted three or four times"
as they flow down the watershed, said Lucienne de Naie of the
citizens group Maui Tomorrow. "We're asking an awful lot out of our
streams. Where I live, there's now hardly any natural water at all,
except for when it's pouring rain."</TE>
<TE>   But Garret Hew, director of East Maui Irrigation, said the company
diverts only about 15% of the water in the streams. "Hawaii has a lot
of flashy streams, so when it rains, it pours, and our system can
only take so much. We have streams in east Maui that produce billions
of gallons when it's raining, and the rest goes straight into the
ocean," Hew said.</TE>
<TE>   An environmental impact study conducted by Maui's Department of
Water Supply backs that up. It says there is no connection between
the ground water and the six major streams in eastern Maui, except
very near the coast. "To sustain the argument that pumping from [the
aquifer] will affect stream flow, it must be shown that the water
table is intersected by the stream channels," the report said. "This
cannot be done."</TE>
<TE>   But Ed Wendt, who grows the traditional Hawaiian crop of taro in
eastern Maui, said he and his fellow farmers have seen dozens of
streams dry up.</TE>
<TE>   "There are perennial streams, and right now there's no water
coming down  them, or very little," he said. "You talk about the
scenic beauty of waterfalls, and they're diverting an outrageous
amount of water from them."</TE>
<TE>   John Minn, the county's planning director, said the island is in
the middle of a long-range planning effort that will look at water
supply as a critical component of growth.</TE>
<TE>   "We really need to look at the whole island and provide a more
integrated and cohesive set of policies," he said. "There are
challenges to our water system, there's no question about it."</TE>
<TE>   High up in the central mountains one recent day, water officials
tramped through the dense rain forest above the county reservoirs.
The air was thick with a constant drizzle, and water poured in
rivulets down the slopes and through the ferns.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like it'd be enough, huh?" said Mike Faringer, a water
treatment plant operator, as he stood in the mist. "But water isn't
the issue. Development is the issue. That's the reason they need more
water."</TE>

<HD>It's a Top-Notch Top Fuel Victory</HD>
<DH>Motor racing: At NHRA's prestigious U.S. Nationals,
Schumacher edges Dixon in final.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLERMONT, Ind.</DL>
<LD>Tony Schumacher raced to his second top fuel victory of the season
Monday in the NHRA's U.S. Nationals.</LD>
<LD>   He also won for the second time in the world's most prestigious
drag race by defeating season points leader Larry Dixon in the final
round. Schumacher drove his dragster to a performance of 4.663
seconds at 315.93 mph. Dixon lost traction near mid-track and posted
a 5.161 at 240.29.</LD>
<LD>   "What an incredible day," Schumacher said after the seventh
victory of his career. "Indy is a race you wait for all year. To win
Indy is incredible, and to win it two times in three years is
unbelievable.</LD>
<TE>   "My father has won this race, and his team has had a lot of
success here. I'm just glad we won it again."</TE>
<TE>   John Force, Jeg Coughlin and Angelle Savoie also were winners.</TE>
<TE>   Force got his sixth win of the season and the 104th of his career
by defeating Tommy Johnson Jr. in funny car. Force won for the fourth
time at Indy, running 5.028 at 280.02 to hold off Johnson. The loser
clocked a quicker time at 4.996 and finished faster at 308.43 mph,
but Force's rapid reaction time at the start gave him a lead that was
too much to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   Coughlin also used a quick start to move into the pro stock points
lead. Coughlin earned his fourth victory of the season and 27th of
his career with quick reflexes. He covered a quarter-mile
Indianapolis Raceway Park in 6.951 at 199.08. Jim Yates lost despite
a 6.934 at 200.08.</TE>
<TE>   Savoie got her fourth victory of the season and 26th of her career
in pro stock motorcycle, defeating Shawn Gann. Savoie clocked a 7.232
at 183.39 to defeat Gann, who posted a 7.263 at 184.22.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hobbled by a strained muscle in his left thigh, Ruben Sierra is
determined to make a difference as the Seattle Mariners try to make a
playoff push.</LD>
<LD>   Sierra came off the bench as a pinch-hitter and hit a tiebreaking
two-run single with two out in the eighth inning as the Mariners
handed the American League Central-leading Minnesota Twins their
fifth consecutive defeat, 5-2 on Monday at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a big hit," he said. "Thank God that I came through in the
condition I'm in right now."</LD>
<TE>   The Mariners stayed six games behind Oakland in the AL West and
closed within two games of the Angels in the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra singled to right off LaTroy Hawkins after Bret Boone
singled and Edgar Martinez walked to open the inning against Johan
Santana (8-6).</TE>
<TE>   After John Olerud's groundout moved Boone to third and
pinch-runner Luis Ugueto to second, Sierra singled.</TE>
<TE>   Desi Relaford followed with a double to score pinch-runner Charles
Gipson from first.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra batted for the first time since coming out of last Tuesday
night's game in Minnesota when he aggravated the injury he sustained
Aug. 19 in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to get healthy as fast as I can," said Sierra,
who was a key player for the Mariners when Martinez was out from
April 12-June 14 with a ruptured tendon his left leg.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra thinks he can be a factor for the Mariners in their last 24
games. He is hitting .281 with 12 home runs and 58 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting better, much better," he said. "I think I'm going to
be soon in the lineup. I'm going to be playing somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins, who are on their longest losing streak of the season,
still lead the division by 12 games over Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Rhodes (8-3) got the victory and Kazuhiro Sasaki earned his
34th save.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 8, New York 4--Nomar Garciaparra drove in three runs, and
Casey Fossum (3-3) won for the first time in seven starts this season
as the Red Sox won at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Shea Hillenbrand had three hits and scored twice for the Red Sox,
who trimmed New York's AL East lead to 6 1/2 games on a rainy day at
Yankee Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Rey Sanchez and Jason Varitek had two-run singles. Boston, which
had lost four in a row to its longtime rival, is 4 1/2 games behind
the Angels in the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso Soriano hit his 35th homer, stole his 38th base and drove
in two runs as New York lost for the fourth time in five games. Mike
Mussina (16-8) took the loss.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, Toronto 3--Joe Borchard homered for his first career
hit and the visiting White Sox won their season-high sixth
consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Borchard, whose contract was purchased from triple-A Charlotte
before the game, hit a two-run homer off Corey Thurman (2-3) in the
fourth inning for a 4-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 11, Detroit 1--Karim Garcia homered twice and had a
career-high six RBIs at Detroit as the Indians handed the Tigers
their ninth consecutive home loss.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia hit three-run homers in the first and sixth innings.

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Percival's Focus Is on Saves, Not ERA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>To Angel closer Troy Percival, few statistics are as useless as
earned-run average. If he blows a save opportunity, he failed. If he
saves the game, he did his job. And he loses no sleep if he gives up
a run or two along the way.</LD>
<LD>   But his 1.96 ERA, if it holds up, would be his best in seven
seasons as the Angel closer. Here's one reason: Never this season has
Percival entered a game with the Angels trailing. Closers usually
work an inning in defeat every now and then, if they haven't pitched
in a few days and need to stay sharp, but the four-time All-Star is
grateful that Manager Mike Scioscia has avoided using him that way.</LD>
<LD>   "Scioscia uses me so well," Percival said. "He doesn't mind not
using me for seven or eight days as long as I do my work. And I've
been able to get consistent save opportunities. The team has played
well enough and pitched well enough to keep me sharp."</LD>
<TE>   By avoiding prolonged losing streaks, the Angels have not been
forced to choose between using Percival for a mop-up inning or
letting him sit idle for a week. And, with the staff pitching
well--the Angels have not posted a team ERA below 4.00 since 1992,
but they're at 3.78 today--Scioscia and pitching coach Bud Black have
not been forced to use Percival because the rest of the relievers
have been ineffective or exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   And, as Percival acknowledges, there is nothing more likely to
inflate his ERA than using him in a non-save situation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's adrenaline," he said. "When the game's on the line, you have
a tendency to pick your mental game up a notch.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm not going full speed, I'm useless."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' first-round draft pick, Virginia Tech pitcher Joe
Saunders, is 3-1 with a 1.88 ERA in five starts at Class A Cedar
Rapids. The Angels signed him for a $1.825-million bonus, passing on
touted Texas high school pitcher Scott Kazmir, in part because they
were among many clubs that believed Kazmir might hold out for perhaps
twice as much.</TE>
<TE>   Kazmir, projected as a top-five pick, went to the New York Mets as
the 15th pick. He held out for two months before signing with the
Mets for $2.15 million, but Angel Scouting Director Donny Rowland
said he had no regrets about selecting Saunders.</TE>
<TE>   "We like Kazmir. We think he has a chance to be really good,"
Rowland said. "We think Saunders has a chance to be really good too,
and he should be quicker [to the major leagues]."</TE>

<HD>Hamstring Injury Ends Prior's Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After all the concern about Mark Prior's innings and workload, the
right-hander's rookie season is over because of a bad hamstring.</LD>
<LD>   The Chicago Cubs put Prior on the disabled list Monday with a
strained hamstring, an injury that will take at least three or four
weeks to heal.</LD>
<LD>   "It makes no sense thinking about getting him back for the last
week of the season," General Manager Jim Hendry said. "He did a
terrific job, obviously, but he's the cornerstone of our future and
we're not going to take any chances with him."</LD>
<TE>   Prior was injured Saturday in the first game of a day-night
doubleheader against the St. Louis Cardinals. Batting in the bottom
of the fifth, he ran to first base after a third-strike wild pitch by
Cardinal starter Luther Hackman. He then slid hard into second on a
fielder's choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was worried about how many pitches I'd thrown and how
many innings, and it's a hamstring," Prior said. "I guess if I've got
to go on the DL, I'd rather go on for a leg injury than an arm
injury."</TE>
<TE>   Prior, the No. 2 pick in the 2001 amateur draft from USC, went 6-6
with a 3.32 earned-run average in 19 starts with the Cubs. His 147
strikeouts were third-best on the team behind Matt Clement and Kerry
Wood, and he walked only 38 in 116 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez will miss his next scheduled
start against Roger Clemens and the New York Yankees because of a
strained left hip.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, 17-4 with a major league-leading 2.22 ERA, is not
expected to pitch until Boston returns home for a series against
Toronto that begins Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Chris Carpenter of the Toronto Blue Jays will undergo
season-ending surgery on his right shoulder Wednesday. Carpenter
underwent an MRI exam last week that showed he has a small tear in
his labrum.... Oakland Athletic reliever Jim Mecir began serving his
three-game suspension for hitting Royce Clayton with a pitch. Mecir
initially appealed, but he dropped the protest in time to serve his
suspension during a stretch in which the A's play only three games in
five days, giving ample rest to Oakland's bullpen.... Salomon Torres,
a one-time prospect who hasn't pitched in the majors in more than
five years, was recalled by the Pittsburgh Pirates and will start
today in Atlanta.... Texas pitcher Rudy Seanez was activated from the
60-day disabled list. Seanez, a right-hander, went on the disabled
list May 30 because of right shoulder tendinitis and a herniated
disk. He had back surgery June 25.</TE>

<DL>BIG BEAR</DL>
<LD>This is where it all began.</LD>
<LD>   Supposedly.</LD>
<LD>   Fernando Vargas will no longer talk about it and Oscar De La Hoya
says he doesn't remember it.</LD>
<TE>   But back when he couldn't seem to stop talking about it, Vargas
claimed his hatred of De La Hoya, whom he will face Sept. 14 in a
154-pound title fight at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay Events Center, began
on a snow-covered trail in this skiing/boating resort atop the San
Bernardino mountains 120 miles from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   It was 1993 and De La Hoya, the gold medal winner from East Los
Angeles, was a Latino hero to Vargas, who had learned his fighting
skills on the streets of Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas, an amateur then, said he was doing roadwork when he bogged
down in a heavy snow bank and fell.</TE>
<TE>   When he looked up, his frustration turned to excitement. Here came
De La Hoya, doing some roadwork of his own. Surely this rising star
would stop to lift up a kid following his own uphill path.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Vargas claimed, De La Hoya took one look at him, laughed
and continued on his way.</TE>
<TE>   When the story was relayed to Robert Alcazar, De La Hoya's former
trainer, he reacted with a laugh, saying, "No, no, Vargas has it all
wrong. What happened was, I was following Oscar on a snowmobile and,
when I saw Vargas laying there, I ran him over."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happened on that snowy road, it chilled the relationship
between De La Hoya and Vargas and ignited a feud that has become the
hottest in boxing.</TE>
<TE>   And the fact that they are still here, still using the high
altitude and wooded trails to prepare themselves for battle, has only
intensified the feud.</TE>
<TE>   Twice in recent weeks, they have crossed paths in their
early-morning runs around Big Bear Lake. The first time the fighters,
surrounded by their entourages, came face to face, Floyd Mayweather
Sr., De La Hoya's trainer, and Vargas exchanged insults.</TE>
<TE>   Mayweather mocked the outfit Vargas was wearing, saying it looked
like a rubber suit, commonly employed to sweat off excessive fat.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas, noting that he was finishing his run while De La Hoya was
just starting his, yelled back, "You'll have to get up earlier than
this to beat me."</TE>
<TE>   When they passed each other the next time, De La Hoya held up six
fingers, his way of telling Vargas he will go down in six rounds.</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult for the two men to avoid each other in this
community of 21,000. They are living in gated homes only half a mile
apart. They could almost practice their prefight stares by looking
over their back fences.</TE>
<TE>   But neither man is about to give up his spot in town. That puts
them in the minority.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After attracting fighters and trainers for a dozen years, the
heyday of Big Bear as Catskills West has faded. There are more
fighters going down the winding mountain roads in search of new
training facilities than there are fighters coming up.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Larry Goossen is credited with starting the Big Bear
craze. A member of the famed Goossen boxing family, Larry came to Big
Bear to train someone who had no interest in becoming a professional
fighter.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Wickliff was a successful businessman in his 40s who loved
boxing and wanted to play at the sport. He hired Larry, who set out
to find a training site. Goossen looked at Lake Arrowhead and several
other Southern California locales but wasn't impressed.</TE>
<TE>   Then one day, he got a call from Wickliff.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, I found the perfect spot," Wickliff told him. "I'm in Big
Bear."</TE>
<TE>   Goossen had never been there. Wickliff loved the remoteness of the
area and the fact Big Bear had a small airport he could use to
commute to his business obligations.</TE>
<TE>   Goossen set up his first gym at the airport in an unused hangar.
Within six months, he had built a gym in a building a couple of
hundred yards away.</TE>
<TE>   Larry's brother, Dan, began bringing up some of the fighters he
promoted, including Gabe and Rafael Ruelas.</TE>
<TE>   Soon there was a steady stream of big names making their way up
the mountain. De La Hoya started using Goossen's facility. Others who
came to Big Bear included Lennox Lewis, Riddick Bowe, Shane Mosley,
Vernon Forrest, Bernard Hopkins, Marco Antonio Barrera, Erik Morales,
Floyd Mayweather Jr., Johnny Tapia and Jorge Paez.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the seclusion, the isolation," De La Hoya said. "It's not
the same as before because everybody knows I train up here, but I can
still relax and concentrate."</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya's presence at the Goossen gym came to an end in 1995
when he fought Rafael Ruelas. Two boxers dividing time in a small
facility to prepare themselves for a blockbuster match against each
other proved to be an untenable situation. The tension came out in
angry confrontations between the two camps.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya realized he didn't need that. He bought property nearby
and built a luxurious, two-story cabin and has added a ring, weight
area and even a putting green. He also uses the facility as a
vacation retreat when he is not training.</TE>
<TE>   Others in the fight game, however, feel differently.</TE>
<TE>   Emanuel Steward briefly established a West Coast version of his
Detroit-based Kronk gym in Big Bear, but he soon abandoned it because
he didn't like driving the mountain roads and thought the rent for
the building was exorbitant. The gym is now a skateboard facility.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest said he didn't like the Big Bear area. Lewis complained of
boredom.</TE>
<TE>   Goossen himself moved away in 1998, tired of small-town life.</TE>
<TE>   Goossen even debunks the theory that fighters gain endurance by
training in an area where the altitude goes as high as 9,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys that are supposed to win, usually win," Goossen said.
"And those that are supposed to lose, usually lose. The altitude was
a selling point, but it really only helps fighters get in a little
bit better shape. If the altitude was really so good, if you get
better and better the higher you go, why don't fighters try to get on
board the space shuttle?</TE>
<TE>   "Really, the main advantage to Big Bear is getting away from
family and friends."</TE>
<TE>   The Goossen facility has been supplanted by a fitness center in
the rear, but it is struggling to find fighters. Vargas used to train
there, but has opted for a private facility.</TE>
<TE>   There are plans to build a new gym at nearby Lake Williams, but
persuading fighters to use it could be a tough sell.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer McCullar, executive director of the Big Bear Chamber of
Commerce, questions whether the influx of fighters has much effect on
the community.</TE>
<TE>   Kresse Armour, a City Hall employee, disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one more clean industry," she said. "The fighters bring
people who spend money up here. And every time Oscar De La Hoya
mentions Big Bear, we should thank him. He lets people know about
us."</TE>
<TE>   But whether or not the residents of Big Bear like having fighters
frequent their slopes and restaurants and stores, it won't matter if
the fighters don't like Big Bear.</TE>
<TE>   Even Mayweather, De La Hoya's trainer, isn't enamored of the
mountain environment.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a city boy," Mayweather said. "I don't like no woods."</TE>

<LD>Bill Bowerman, coach of the U.S. track and field team at the 1972
Munich Olympics, was renowned for doing things a bit differently than
his peers.</LD>
<LD>   He feuded often and openly with U.S. and International Olympic
Committee officials. He never recruited and rarely offered full
scholarships to his runners at the University of Oregon. Instead, he
found them weekend and summer employment in the lumber mills around
Eugene.</LD>
<LD>   Bowerman also handcrafted shoes for his runners and, later,
co-founded (with Phil Knight) the athletic shoe giant Nike.</LD>
<TE>   "Winning is nice," Bowerman told writer and Olympic marathon
runner Kenny Moore before the 1972 Games, "but you savor that victory
for an evening and you wake up the next morning and it's gone. I
believe we compete for every breath we draw, but competing well is
just not to be equated with winning."</TE>
<TE>   Add Bowerman: As the team was set to leave for Munich, a reporter
approached the coach in the departure lounge at Kennedy Airport in
New York. As Moore recalls, the interview did not go well.</TE>
<TE>   Reporter: "I have to file a story on the team's departure. So
what's the big news?"</TE>
<TE>   Bowerman: "So far as I know, there is none. We're all here. We
leave from Gate 29."</TE>
<TE>   Reporter: "Let me ask you about some of the big names. Randy
Matson. Al Oerter. Hayes Jones. How is Hayes Jones?"</TE>
<TE>   Bowerman: "Hayes Jones is no longer with us."</TE>
<TE>   Reporter: "You mean he died?"</TE>
<TE>   Jones retired after the 1964 Games. Matson failed to make the
team. Oerter retired in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Frank Shorter became the first American to win the
Olympic marathon in 64 years when he won the gold in Munich. Name the
most recent U.S. Olympic marathon champion.</TE>
<TE>   Narrowing the gap: Bob Ryan, columnist for the Boston Globe,
believes the days of U.S. basketball dominance are all but over.</TE>
<TE>   "International basketball is coming along far faster than even its
staunchest adherents dreamed it could when the Dream Team was foisted
on the world a decade ago," Ryan wrote from the World Championships
in Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "That team won its 13 games by an average of 43 points, and if
[U.S. Coach Chuck] Daly had been Ming the Merciless it could have
been far worse. By the 1996 Olympics the average margin had dropped
to 28, and in Sydney two years ago the experience was frightening.
The U.S. was very fortunate to defeat Lithuania by two, and the
average margin of victory in the final four games was a shade under
10.</TE>
<TE>   "And now the U.S., with a team of very good NBA players, has to
huff and puff and puff some more to defeat a Chinese team that is
missing its second-best player [Wang Zhi Zhi]? It truly is a whole
new basketball world, which is great."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Joan Benoit Samuelson won the inaugural women's
marathon in Los Angeles in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Abe Lemons, who died Monday at 79, gave one of his
last published interviews to Berry Tramel of the Daily Oklahoman
earlier this summer and proved he hadn't lost the sarcastic wit that
made him a favorite of writers:</TE>
<TE>   "I got a letter from [Bob] Knight. Hadn't heard from him in a
while. Two months. He's getting to be too big time, though I don't
see how anybody can get big time living in Lubbock."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Are on Cloud 19</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>It began as an early September showdown between National League West
contenders and ended with Arizona first baseman Mark Grace on the
mound in the ninth inning, cracking up as he did his best Mike
Fetters impersonation, pitching to a lineup that looked more like the
Las Vegas 51s than the Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   That's how much of a laugher Monday night's game was for the
Dodgers, who handed the defending World Series-champion Diamondbacks
their worst loss in franchise history, a 19-1 obliteration that
pulled the Dodgers within five games of Arizona in the division and
pushed them 2 1/2 games ahead of San Francisco in the wild-card race.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers, the same offense-impaired team that scored 19
runs--total--during a nine-game stretch July 14-22, amassed a
season-high 24 hits, matching their highest total since moving to Los
Angeles in 1958, while winning for the 18th time in 24 games.</LD>
<TE>   It was such a blowout the Dodgers batted around twice--when they
scored five runs in the second inning, which featured home runs by
Shawn Green and Brian Jordan, and eight runs in the seventh, which
featured home runs by Adrian Beltre and Mike Kinkade.</TE>
<TE>   "That's about three weeks' worth of runs for us," Manager Jim
Tracy said. "We scored early ... and just kept hitting."</TE>
<TE>   The game was so lopsided that by the seventh inning the Dodgers
fielded a lineup that included Kinkade, David Ross, Joe Thurston,
Jolbert Cabrera and Wilkin Ruan, whose first two major league hits, a
single and a double, both came in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   And it was so ugly that Grace, a 38-year-old left-hander, made his
major league pitching debut in the ninth, bringing a Bank One
Ballpark crowd of 35,372 to its feet and players from both teams to
the top steps of their dugouts.</TE>
<TE>   Grace retired Jeff Reboulet and Ruan on fly-ball outs before Ross
drilled his first major league homer, a 396-foot shot to left. Grace
then got Tyler Houston, a former Chicago Cub teammate, to fly to
right.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a new-found respect for pitchers," Grace said. "My butt
aches, my legs ache, my arm hurts. But if you can have five minutes
of fun in a game like this, it's worth it."</TE>
<TE>   Position players have made a mockery of games by
pitching--remember Jose Canseco blowing out his arm for Texas in
1993?--and Arizona Manager Bob Brenly said he would apologize to
Tracy later Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Not necessary. The Dodgers loved it.</TE>
<TE>   "He had good stuff," Tracy said. "He threw strikes. He's one of
the class people in this game, and he has been for a long time.
Obviously, he was having a little fun, and we respect that. But I
think he wants that pitch to Ross back."</TE>
<TE>   Grace complained he didn't have a scouting report on Ross.</TE>
<TE>   "He can obviously hit a 65-mph fastball," Grace said. "That poor
kid hit his first home run, and it's off Mark Grace. I feel sorry for
him."</TE>
<TE>   There was one benefit for Ross.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to tell everyone, my kids and my grandkids, that I hit
my first home run off a future Hall of Famer," Ross said. "I just
won't tell them who it was."</TE>
<TE>   At least Grace ended on a good note by retiring his old friend
Houston. "I've known him for a long time," Grace said, "and I have
bragging rights on him forever."</TE>
<TE>   Houston was impressed with Grace.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a tight little slider, a good fastball, and he hit his
spots well," Houston said. "I would have loved to have hit a home run
off him. I'm going to hear about this for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Beltre came within a double of hitting for the cycle, adding an
RBI triple in the fourth and a single in the sixth, and Mark
Grudzielanek had three hits. Houston and Ruan had two-run doubles in
the seventh, when the Dodgers established a season high for runs in
an inning.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's 18-run margin of defeat topped the previous record of
17, set in a 19-2 loss at Colorado on June 18, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   While Dodger hitters gorged themselves on starter Rick Helling
(seven runs, nine hits in 3 2/3 innings) and reliever Eddie Oropesa
(10 runs, nine hits in 1 2/3 innings), Odalis Perez (13-8) blanked
the Diamondbacks on two hits in six innings, extending his
scoreless-innings streak against Arizona to 14. Perez is 3-1 with a
1.80 earned-run average in his last seven starts.</TE>
<TE>   "Perez has been magnificent for us in his last six or seven
starts," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks, meanwhile, have lost six of nine games, scoring
one or zero runs in five of the games.</TE>
<TE>   But at least Grace provided some comic relief.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Houston's Role Has Diminished</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Tyler Houston expected to play a prominent role with the Dodgers when
he was acquired from Milwaukee in late July, probably spelling
then-struggling Adrian Beltre once or twice a week at third and Eric
Karros once a week at first.</LD>
<LD>   But since his July 26 Dodger debut, when he had four hits, four
runs batted in and three runs against San Francisco, Houston has only
seven hits in 48 at-bats (.146) and has started two of the last 16
games. After singling twice in his first three pinch-hitting
appearances, Houston has one hit in his last 10.</LD>
<LD>   And when Manager Jim Tracy decided to sit Karros against Arizona
on Monday night, he started left-handed-hitting Dave Hansen, who had
three hits in four at-bats during his career against Diamondback
starter Rick Helling, over the left-handed Houston.</LD>
<TE>   "I haven't been on this kind of schedule since 1997," said
Houston, who hit .302 with seven homers and 33 RBIs as the Brewers'
everyday third baseman.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough when you're used to playing; when you get an at-bat,
you want to at least have your timing to where you're close. But
that's the situation, and as long as I'm here, I have to deal with
that role."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers hoped the trade for Houston would light a fire under
Beltre, and it did--Beltre has raised his average from .238 to .273
since the deal and is hitting .373 (50 for 134) with seven homers,
nine doubles, 27 RBIs and 27 runs over his last 34 games.</TE>
<TE>   But Beltre's surge has relegated Houston to the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious why I'm not playing--when I got here, Adrian wasn't
hitting .270 with 17 homers," Houston said. "If it took me getting
here to turn him on, great. I want to go to the playoffs, and
whatever role I can help the team in, I'll do the best I can.</TE>
<TE>   "But I wouldn't be human if I said I don't want to play all the
time."</TE>
<TE>   Houston will be a free agent this winter and hopes to sign a
multiyear deal. He'd love to remain with the Dodgers and is willing
to polish his outfield skills to enhance his value, but he realizes
his chances of returning are dimming.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an awesome group of guys and coaches," Houston said, "but
I don't know if what I'm looking for at the end of the year is going
to be what they're looking for."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Struggling pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii, whose rotation spot was skipped
over the weekend, will start tonight against Arizona, "but that's all
I will commit to now," Tracy said. "We want to see where he's at, and
[how he does] will determine what we do with [Thursday's] off day."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii is 5-8 with a 6.14 earned-run average in the last three
months and leads the major leagues with 100 walks, and Tracy could
use the off day to push Ishii's next start back. And the Dodgers
still have the option of replacing Ishii with Kevin Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows he's not gonna sneak up on anyone anymore," Tracy said
of Ishii. "The novelty act has worn off. [Opponents] read the
scouting reports, just like we do. They're making him throw strikes,
and if he doesn't, they take a walk and paint a rosy picture [for the
next hitter]."</TE>

<TE>   Update--Arizona third baseman Matt Williams (swelling in his left
elbow) and center fielder Steve Finley (mild hamstring strain) sat
out Monday night's game because of injuries. Williams will probably
return tonight, but with the Dodgers starting a left-hander, Finley
will probably be given another day off. With Dodger shortstop Cesar
Izturis hitting .328 from the right side, Tracy might move the
switch-hitter back to the leadoff spot against left-handers.</TE>

<DH>St. Bonaventure High's Lewis emerges as one of the nation's
best receivers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It looks simple enough from a distance, the white baseball hat that
sits snugly on Whitney Lewis' head.</LD>
<LD>   Then you see it up close and realize it offers much less as sun
protection than as a window into Lewis' life:</LD>
<LD>   His carefree days as a toddler. His troubled teenage days, when he
found solace in front of the TV on Saturdays in the fall, watching
his favorite college football team. And perhaps his future days, when
he could return to the state where he was born ... as a football
star.</LD>
<TE>   On the back of Lewis' hat, written in small block letters, is his
last name. On the front is a light gray silhouette of the Texas
Longhorn.</TE>
<TE>   Football has always come easy for Ventura St. Bonaventure High's
Lewis, a 6-foot-2, 215-pound senior receiver considered to be one of
the top five high school recruits in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   On the first play of his first varsity game, he ran a post pattern
and pulled down a 28-yard touchdown pass over two defenders. Lewis
was 14 at the time. A freshman.</TE>
<TE>   He has improved with age, scoring 31 touchdowns and making 99
receptions the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Gutierrez, the Seraphs' offensive coordinator, is familiar
with speed and skill. Gutierrez played quarterback at San Diego State
from 1991-94, handing off to Marshall Faulk and throwing to future
NFL receivers Darnay Scott and Will Blackwell.</TE>
<TE>   "[Lewis] kind of reminds me of Will Blackwell as far as things he
can do in the air, one-handing balls, acrobatic moves.... He has that
grace in the air," Gutierrez said. "And he has that speed of Darnay
Scott, the fastest receiver to ever go through San Diego State."</TE>
<TE>   Football has been simple for Lewis, compared to being a child of
divorced parents.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis has lived in a rough-and-tumble area of Oxnard with his
mother, Sherri Laws, since his parents divorced six years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It was weird at first, when you're used to having your dad around
and all of a sudden he's not there," Lewis said. "It puts a lot of
pressure on me. It's like, you've got to be the man of the house,
you've got to take care of your mom. That's something I like doing,
where everything's on you and all the pressure's on you."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis said he sees his father, Byron, once or twice a month.</TE>
<TE>   "He keeps me level-headed," Lewis said. "A lot of people come up
to me and say, 'Whitney, you're the top recruit in the nation, you're
this and that.' As soon as I see [my dad], he says, 'You're nobody.
You stay level-headed. You're no different than anyone else.' "</TE>
<TE>   Lewis has managed to succeed, the lone misstep coming earlier this
year, when he was ruled academically ineligible for basketball and
had to sit out the second half of the Seraphs' season. He has since
improved his academics--"Without grades, you can't go anywhere," he
said wistfully--and is up to a 2.5 grade-point average for core
classes, St. Bonaventure Coach Jon Mack said.</TE>
<TE>   "He fits the mold for all the negative things in our society--on
his own a lot, lives in a rough neighborhood. He easily could have
fallen into negativity," Mack said. "Credit his mother, his primary
parent, and his father, who have helped him avoid drugs, alcohol and
gangs."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, but moved to California
with his parents before he was 2.</TE>
<TE>   He goes back almost every summer to visit family and has followed
the Longhorns for years, but he has not officially committed to
Texas. Lewis said he is also considering Florida State, Washington
and Miami, but he talks warmly of Texas as he adjusts his Longhorns
hat, given to him by a teammate's mother.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandpa used to take me to the Texas games all the time,"
Lewis said. "Whenever it was game week, everywhere you went there was
a Texas flag flying outside the house. It seems like a championship
game every week. Everyone's out there and everyone wants to cheer you
on. I wish I could have stayed there and grown up, but my mom and my
dad wanted to come out here."</TE>
<TE>   The eyes of Texas--and almost every other successful football
program in the nation, for that matter--have been fixed on Lewis for
years.</TE>
<TE>   As a sophomore, he had 52 catches for 879 yards and 17 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he had 47 catches for 901 yards and 14 touchdowns on a
run-oriented team. Quarterback Jack Swisher averaged only 10 passes a
game while Lorenzo Booker piled up 2,870 yards rushing and 50
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Booker is now at Florida State, which leaves plenty of work for
Lewis, who will play receiver, running back, defensive back and kick
returner this season.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis has been slowed the last two weeks by a hamstring injury,
but he had an impressive off-season, running a 4.34 in the 40-yard
dash at a high-school combine at USC in April. He also bench-pressed
305 pounds and lifted 590 pounds in the squat.</TE>
<TE>   The off-season training has prepared him for this season, when the
competition will be substantially tougher for St. Bonaventure, which
moves to Division IV in the Southern Section after winning three
consecutive championships in Division XI.</TE>
<TE>   The Seraphs have won 42 consecutive games and are chasing the
section record of 46 set by Temple City from 1969-73. Their first
five games are home against Dos Palos of Central California, at
Newhall Hart, home against Mission Hills Alemany and Saugus, and at
Ridgecrest Burroughs.</TE>
<TE>   St. Bonaventure then begins its first season in the Channel
League, a much more difficult collection of teams than in the tiny
Tri-Valley League.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis isn't afraid.</TE>
<TE>   "If we do what we've been doing, there should be no difference,"
he said. "I feel nobody in the nation works as hard as we do. We're
up here at 6:15 [a.m.] running on our own. We work on speed and we
work on weightlifting. There's no high school team anywhere that does
what we do."</TE>

<HD>Congaree Wins One for Baffert</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: After two losses, 4-year-old gives trainer
third straight victory in Del Mar Breeders' Cup Handicap.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>Trainer Bob Baffert has taken control of another race here besides
the Del Mar Futurity.</LD>
<LD>   Congaree's one-length victory over Kela in the $250,000 Del Mar
Breeders' Cup Handicap on Monday was the third in a row in the Grade
II for Baffert, who in eight days will try to make off with the
Futurity for the seventh consecutive year.</LD>
<LD>   Rebounding after two losses as the favorite--the second coming in
the San Diego Handicap, Del Mar's prep for the Pacific
Classic--Congaree, the 7-5 favorite, led throughout under new jockey
Mike Smith en route to his sixth victory in 12 starts.</LD>
<TE>   Racing without blinkers for the first time since he won the Lone
Star Park Handicap on May 27, his first race of 2002, the 4-year-old
Arazi colt ran the mile in 1:36 1/5.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Baffert, who had won the Del Mar Breeders' Cup the
previous two years with El Corredor, indicated Congaree will make his
next start on the turf at Santa Anita--the $250,000 Oak Tree
Breeders' Cup Mile on Oct. 5--possibly with an eye toward the
Breeders' Cup Mile on Oct. 26 at Arlington Park.</TE>
<TE>   "[Jockey] David [Flores] worked him on the turf for me and he
thought he handled the turf better," said Baffert. "He can't go 1 1/4
miles, so if he turns out to be a turf runner, we can go to the
Breeders' Cup. He's bred for the turf."</TE>
<TE>   Kela, the 8-5 second choice, was wide while rallying after being
last most of the trip in his graded stakes debut. The 4-year-old beat
out 10-1 shot Reba's Gold by a head and Euchre, the 7-2 third choice,
was a neck back in fourth place.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Making his first start since finishing fourth in the Preakness and
his first for trainer Todd Pletcher, Harlan's Holiday easily won the
$500,000 Pennsylvania Derby at Philadelphia Park.</TE>
<TE>   Narrowly favored at even-money over fourth-place finisher
Wiseman's Ferry in the field of five, the son of Harlan won by 4 1/2
lengths under Edgar Prado and completed the 1 1/8 miles in 1:51.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Starlight Stable, Harlan's Holiday has won seven of 13
and the $300,000 payday pushed his earnings to more than $1.8
million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lakenheath, the 3-1 third choice in a field of five, defeated 6-5
favorite With Ability by a head to win the $150,000 Arlington Matron
over a muddy surface at Arlington Park.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Matron was the middle leg of a national pick three; the other
winners were heavily favored Lone Star Sky in the $200,000 Cradle
Stakes at River Downs and Super High in the $125,000 Solana Beach
Handicap at Del Mar. The payout on a $1 bet was $38.60.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Harris Farms and trained by Carla Gaines, Super High, the
2-1 favorite while racing coupled with fourth-place finisher Top Of
Our Game, went wire to wire and won by 2 1/2 lengths under jockey
Garrett Gomez.</TE>
<TE>   The final time for the mile on turf was a stakes-record 1:33 3/5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AB What A Runner, the fastest qualifier, edged 13-1 shot Eye
Opening Episode and Meteoric to win the $2,050,000 All American
Futurity at Ruidoso Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Dennis and Kris Hill and trained by Bret Vickery, AB What
A Runner ($6.20) won by a nose and completed the 440 yards on a
sloppy track in 21.30 seconds. The 2-year-old Arizona-bred filly was
ridden by Jay Conklin and remained unbeaten in three starts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winless in eight races on the main track, Ibn Al Haitham is now
perfect in two races on the grass after he won the $100,000 Saranac,
the closing-day feature at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum and trained by Kiaran
McLaughlin, the 3-year-old Zafonic colt was ridden by Richard
Migliore and ran the 1 3/16 miles in 1:55 1/5. Miesque's Approval,
the 6-5 favorite, wound up fourth.</TE>

<HD>Armstrong's Team Cleared</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An exhaustive doping probe into Lance Armstrong's cycling team was
closed last week because of a lack of evidence, a French judicial
official said.</LD>
<LD>   After 21 months of inquiries, investigators found no proof that
the U.S. Postal Service team used banned substances during the 2000
Tour de France, the official told the Associated Press on Monday,
speaking on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   Armstrong won his second consecutive Tour title in 2000. He won
the Tour for the fourth consecutive year in July.</LD>
<TE>   "To me, it was like 'Oh, really? Great. Whatever,' " Armstrong
told the Austin American-Statesman. "We knew all along there really
was no case.</TE>
<TE>   "It took two years to announce something that we knew two weeks
into it that there was nothing there. The political process ran its
course.... They got into it, saw they were going to lose, and they
didn't know how to handle it. So it went on and on and on."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Postal's director of operations Dan Osipow also expected the
probe to be dropped.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a relief that it's officially over," Osipow said. "We've
expressed our innocence time and time again.</TE>
<TE>   "All along, we felt this conclusion would be found. It's taken a
lot longer than anyone expected."</TE>
<TE>   The judicial official said that none of the tests carried out on
blood and urine samples taken from Armstrong and his teammates two
years ago showed evidence the cyclists used banned drugs or underwent
banned medical procedures.</TE>
<TE>   The deputy director of the Tour de France, Daniel Baal, said the
decision to end the probe "means that all the doubts and all the
accusations [against U.S. Postal] had no foundation."</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 fans cheered Little League's newest champions at a
parade in Louisville, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   The 11 and 12-year-old Louisville team members started at their
home field and rode along Main Street to Slugger Field downtown.</TE>
<TE>   The players appeared tired as they gathered on a stage in front of
Slugger Field--home of the triple-A Louisville Bats--with Mayor Dave
Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   The team, led by Aaron Alvey and Zach Osborne, defeated Sendai,
Japan, 1-0, on Aug. 25 to take the world title.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Welsh broke the 50-meter backstroke short-course world record
at the Australian swimming championships in Melbourne.</TE>
<TE>   Welsh finished in 23.31 seconds, .11 of a second faster than the
former record in a 25-meter pool set by American Neil Walker on March
16, 2000, at Athens.</TE>
<TE>   Passings</TE>
<TE>   Jake Richardson, a defensive tackle for the Georgia football team
that defeated Texas in the 1984 Cotton Bowl, has died at the age of
38. Richardson, who died Thursday of kidney failure at Emory
Hospital, was a member of the Bulldogs from 1982-85.</TE>

<HD>Panthers Pick Peete to Start Over Weinke</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Carolina Panthers believe Chris Weinke is still their quarterback
of the future, even though they've benched him.</LD>
<LD>   Carolina Coach John Fox said Monday that 14-year veteran Rodney
Peete will start Sunday's opener because Weinke has yet to grasp the
offense and Peete will give the Panthers a better chance to beat the
Baltimore Ravens.</LD>
<LD>   "Chris is still a big part of our plans," Fox said. "We brought in
Rodney to help on and off the field, and this, in my opinion, is a
move to help our football team and help Chris."</LD>
<TE>   The decision did not sit well with Weinke, who started last season
as a rookie when Carolina went 1-15.</TE>
<TE>   He was expected to be the starter this season but struggled in the
exhibition season under the new offense Fox installed when he was
hired in January.</TE>
<TE>   "By no means am I happy about this, the timing of it is tough,"
Weinke said. "Any competitor wouldn't be happy about it. My goal is
to work hard, to go out there every day and prove that I'm capable of
this.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, my days as a starting quarterback for the Carolina
Panthers are not done."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive player of the year Michael Strahan agreed to a
seven-year, $46-million deal that will allow the NFL's single-season
sack holder to end his career with the New York Giants.</TE>
<TE>   The deal came three days before the Giants' season opener against
the San Francisco 49ers and only six months after an angry Strahan
declared that this would be his last season with the team after a
proposed $56-million deal fell apart.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very happy I will be in New York and that I am going to stay
here," Strahan said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Super Bowl MVP Mark Rypien won't be with the Seattle
Seahawks this season after all.</TE>
<TE>   Rypien, who appeared to have made the roster when the team made
its final cuts on Sunday, was waived.</TE>
<TE>   That means the Seahawks won't have to pay Rypien's $750,000
salary, of which $450,000 counted against the NFL's salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Jacksonville Jaguars signed 10-year journeyman quarterback
Kent Graham to give themselves some veteran experience behind Mark
Brunell.... The Minnesota Vikings agreed to terms with veteran
linebacker Greg Biekert, who was cut by Oakland. Biekert is expected
to start at middle linebacker. The Vikings also claimed former Dallas
Cowboy placekicker Tim Seder off waivers.... Tight end Desmond Clark,
who caught 51 passes last season for the Denver Broncos, was claimed
off waivers by the Miami Dolphins.</TE>

<HD>Day to Remember for Wood, Sosa</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now this is the kind of game Kerry Wood likes.</LD>
<LD>   Wood won for only the second time since the All-Star break and
Sammy Sosa hit his 494th career homer Monday as the Chicago Cubs
routed the Milwaukee Brewers, 17-4, and salvaged a split of a
doubleheader at Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   "It feels good," said Wood, who called his 1-3 record in his first
10 starts after the break "embarrassing" after his last loss.</LD>
<TE>   "When you're ahead by that much, guys can relax and you can have
fun a little," he said. "It was just fun to be out there playing
baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Wood (10-8) tied a major league record with four strikeouts in the
fourth inning and also hit a two-run homer, his first since May 2,
2000. Bill Mueller, Alex Gonzalez and Todd Hundley homered for the
Cubs, whose 17 runs were a season high.</TE>
<TE>   Wood gave up five hits over seven innings, striking out eight and
walking two.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewer pitching staff, meanwhile, was horrid. Former Dodger
Ben Diggins (0-1), who was traded to Milwaukee in the Tyler Houston
trade, gave up eight runs (seven earned) and recorded only four outs
in his major league debut. He walked six and struck out two.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa hit his first homer since Aug. 17 after sitting out nine
games because of a strained back. Sosa broke a tie with Lou Gehrig
and moved into 18th place on the career list.</TE>
<TE>   In the first game, Ronnie Belliard homered twice, ex-Cubs Eric
Young and Jose Hernandez had solo shots and Glendon Rusch (8-13) won
his seventh in a row against Chicago in Milwaukee's 4-2 victory. The
Cubs stranded 11, including men on third in the fifth and sixth
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 5, Pittsburgh 1--Greg Maddux won for the first time in a
month, pitching eight strong innings at Atlanta as the Braves won
their fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux (12-5) gave up seven hits and also sparked a three-run
rally in the third, singling up the middle and scoring Atlanta's
first run on a wild pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Chipper Jones hit his 22nd homer for the Braves.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 5, St. Louis 3--Aaron Boone homered for the first time
in 20 games and had three RBIs at St. Louis as the Reds ended a
three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Estes (5-11) gave up three runs and six hits in 5 2/3
innings for the Reds.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Dunn, who had been in an eight-for-67 slump, had three hits
and a first-inning RBI single.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 5, Philadelphia 1--Tomo Ohka pitched his second career
complete game, a six-hitter that led the Expos at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Ohka (13-6) got his second complete game in four starts.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 5, San Diego 2--Rookie Jason Jennings pitched seven
strong innings and drove in two runs at San Diego as the Rockies
ended a season-high nine-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Florida at New York, ppd.--The Met-Marlin game was postponed
because of rain and will be made up as part of a doubleheader today.</TE>

<HD>A's Streak Reaches 19</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Tejada has game-winning hit for second day in row
as Oakland ties AL record with 7-6 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Owners of baseball's longest winning streak in 55 years, the Oakland
A's have not only won 19 straight games, they also seem to have
developed a keen awareness of their senses.</LD>
<LD>   "We can smell it," said first baseman Scott Hatteberg.</LD>
<LD>   What they're smelling could be the smoke rising from their caps,
because at this point in their season, you would have to say that the
A's are playing as if they're on fire.</LD>
<TE>   They spotted the Kansas City Royals five runs Monday, then came
back and won, 7-6, in the bottom of the ninth on Miguel Tejada's
sharply struck, bases-loaded single into center field.</TE>
<TE>   For Tejada, the superstar act is becoming sort of routine. His
three-run home run in the bottom of the ninth defeated the Minnesota
Twins on Sunday, and the next day he beat a Royal infield of five
players positioned so close to the plate, they were nearly on the
infield grass.</TE>
<TE>   Said Tejada: "Right now, the big thing, we have a team right now
that nobody wants to win by themselves. We are a team right now."</TE>
<TE>   So it was Tejada against five infielders, but better forget those
odds. After all, what's one against five when you're playing like the
A's?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we know what pressure is," said second baseman Mark
Ellis. "We're just going out there and having fun."</TE>
<TE>   All right, if winning is the standard, then no team has had as
much fun since the 1947 New York Yankees, who won 19 in a row. The
1906 Chicago White Sox also won 19 straight.</TE>
<TE>   Now the A's can have the American League record for themselves if
they can knock off the Royals again Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   After that, there would be only two other post-1900 teams in front
of the A's--the 1935 Chicago Cubs, who won 21 in a row, and the 1916
New York Giants, who won 26 straight.</TE>
<TE>   The A's latest victory was historic enough that Cooperstown
noticed. Manager Art Howe's lineup card has been requested for
display in the Baseball Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   "When Cooperstown calls you, you know you're doing something
special," Howe said.</TE>
<TE>   "Its something we'll probably realize is more phenomenal when it's
over.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want it to end. I wouldn't put anything past these guys.
The atmosphere is fantastic."</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the A's atmosphere is in the stratosphere. Their
lockers are decorated with bobblehead dolls of each other. They like
to race toy cars across the carpet in the clubhouse. They are so laid
back, they are in danger of falling over backward.</TE>
<TE>   But as starting pitcher Barry Zito cautioned, it's all about
business on the field, and streak or no streak, the real deal is
coming down later.</TE>
<TE>   "Making history is nice, but if we play .500 ball the rest of the
way and don't make the playoffs, nobody cares about the season," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   It's a valid point, especially when you consider how surprisingly
little a 19-game winning streak can get you.</TE>
<TE>   When the A's started their run Aug. 13, they were 4 1/2 games
behind the Seattle Mariners. And 20 days and 18 more victories later,
they are only four games ahead of the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   That seems to be far from an insurmountable margin, given the
difficult schedule the A's have in front of them--eight games against
the Angels and six against the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   The A's are 36 games over .500 at 87-51, but there is pressure to
win every day and they're not having any part of it.</TE>
<TE>   When Kansas City built a 5-0 lead against Zito after four innings,
the announced crowd of 26,325 at Network Associates Coliseum fell
silent.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked gloomy," Hatteberg said. "We could have rolled over and
we didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the Oakland hitters began to make some noise. David
Justice began it with a two-run homer that just barely cleared the
fence at the 330-foot marker in right field. Four more runs in the
fifth chased Royal starter Runelvys Hernandez and the A's held a 6-5
lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Royals tied the score in the eighth against reliever Jeff Tam
and could have done even more damage if not for a double play started
by Tejada. The Royals threatened again in the ninth against Billy
Koch when they loaded the bases with one out, but Tejada began
another double play to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Terrence Long's triple to open the ninth, two intentional walks by
Jason Grimsley and Tejada's stinging line drive later, the A's were
running off the field, slapping hands, tipping their caps and
celebrating another victory.</TE>

<LD>   Six for Spitz</LD>
<LD>   Mark Spitz won his sixth gold medal, his fourth in an individual
event, with a victory in the 100-meter freestyle. As in his previous
races in Munich, including two relays, Spitz's time was a world
record. This victory also gave him the record for most gold medals in
a single Olympics. The record had been five, held by Italian fencer
Nedo Nadi in Antwerp in 1920. Australian Shane Gould, who had been
favored to win five gold medals, finished with three, placing second
in the 800 freestyle to Keena Rothhammer, 15, of Santa Clara, and
third in the 100 freestyle, won by Sandra Neilson of El Monte.</LD>
<TE>   Bobick Wins</TE>
<TE>   Fight, Eyes Gold</TE>
<TE>   Duane Bobick, from Bowlus, Minn., (pop. 270) won an easy decision
in his opening bout over Soviet Juriy Nesterov, then declared that he
would win the heavyweight division gold medal. It was Bobick's 60th
consecutive victory, including one over Cuba's Teofilo Stevenson in
the 1971 Pan American Games. Stevenson won his opening fight in
Munich in a first-round knockout of Poland's Ludwik Denderys.</TE>

<LD>Are you ready for some football?</LD>
<LD>   On the first Monday night in September, Kareem Kelly said yes.
Sometimes he said it too loudly. Other times, he said it too quickly.</LD>
<LD>   But on a sweltering evening when the USC Trojans were required to
address the nation, Kareem Kelly said it, again and again, the clear
voice of a team that last year spoke in a whisper.</LD>
<TE>   "It wasn't always real pretty," he said afterward, blood seeping
through his T-shirt, sweat falling from the dragon tattoo that snakes
around his right arm.</TE>
<TE>   "But in the end, we stood up, didn't we?"</TE>
<TE>   You could hear him all the way to Tuberville.</TE>
<TE>   When asked to describe the Trojans' 24-17 victory over Auburn in
the season opener at the sun-scorched Coliseum, it is easiest to
describe their maddening wide receiver.</TE>
<TE>   He was splendid. He was silly. He was tough. He was foolish.</TE>
<TE>   He was, in the end, the mirror image of a team whose first steps
were wildly cheered and occasionally questioned by most of the 63,269
at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans were a little bit good and a little bit nuts.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, they were tough enough, long enough, and there are
times this year that will be enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We won the game, but we've been down this road before," Kelly
said. "We're not going to blow off any opponents. I'm not going to
say anything to make anybody mad.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what's ahead. We know we have to get better."</TE>
<TE>   What they have to do is grab their most exciting player and hang
on and hope the ride begins and ends as neatly as it did Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Three minutes into the nation's toughest schedule, Kelly caught a
pass from Carson Palmer and broke two tackles in a fight into the end
zone for the season's first touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "I got the ball in that situation, I knew I had to score," he said
of the 14-yard reception. "That's the way it has to be this year."</TE>
<TE>   But then, in the third quarter, he gave it back by foolishly
trying to return a punt despite having two Tigers lunging at his
head.</TE>
<TE>   While he eluded the tacklers, a teammate was penalized for
clipping while trying to protect him, and the Trojans were pinned
deep enough to eventually set up Auburn's score-tying field goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I know, I should have called for a fair catch," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I really wanted us to get good field position and ... OK,
yeah, I know, I should have called for a fair catch."</TE>
<TE>   Early in the fourth quarter, while driving toward a possible
go-ahead touchdown, Kelly blew it again when he caught a screen pass
and ran across the field swinging the ball as if he were Barry
Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, he fumbled. And, yeah, Auburn recovered.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to do too much, score every time I touched the ball,
and I was wrong," Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   As he walked off the field, he was confronted by Palmer. Accounts
differ about what happened next, but the message was the same.</TE>
<TE>   Said Kelly: "I told him, please, get me the ball again."</TE>
<TE>   Said Palmer: "I told him, I'm going to come back to you."</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, in the biggest play of the game, it happened.</TE>
<TE>   On third down and 11 around midfield, Palmer found Kelly across a
middle that was so crowded, he was smacked and sandwiched and lost
his helmet.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't, however, lose the ball. And 18 yards later, he gained
the first down.</TE>
<TE>   Said Kelly: "Great receivers make that play. I have to make it."</TE>
<TE>   Said Palmer: "He was tackled. But he exploded through two guys up
the field anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Several minutes later, Palmer had completed the 8:39 drive--a
Trojan 8:39 drive!--with a quarterback sneak for the game-winning
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   While Auburn Coach Tommy Tuberville looked at Kelly and fretted,
the USC coaches embraced him and celebrated.</TE>
<TE>   Sort of.</TE>
<TE>   "He has to realize, he can't be running around like that out there
all the time ... he can't try to do everything," said offensive
coordinator Norm Chow with a grin. "You never want to take away that
attitude, but he has to quit deciding that we can only win the game
with him."</TE>
<TE>   Of course. After three years of inconsistency amid the perception
that he doesn't practice hard enough or jump high enough, Kelly knows
nothing will come easy in this final season.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what people think, I know what I have to show them, and
this is my last chance to do that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to show people that I'm a nice guy, not a jerk. I want
them to see my playing all out all the time."</TE>
<TE>   And when he's not playing, he's laughing and leading, at least
that's what happened early Monday when he spotted buddy Sultan
McCullough wearing a gray T-shirt when the rest of the team was
dressed in black and white.</TE>
<TE>   "He turned me in, and he's my friend!" McCullough said.</TE>
<TE>   "The coach tore me up. But it helped me be focused all day."</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it," said Kelly, laughing, the first Monday night hero of
the fall, a Hank Williams Jr. song in the making.</TE>

<HD>Spitz Cast Shadow Over Heidenreich</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After winning his fifth gold medal in Munich, Mark Spitz considered
withdrawing from his final individual race. One reason was that he
felt he needed rest for the 400-meter medley relay.</LD>
<LD>   Another was that Spitz--whose father, Arnold, often said,
"Swimming isn't everything; winning is"--didn't believe he could beat
U.S. teammate Jerry Heidenreich in the 100 freestyle.</LD>
<LD>   "Six gold medals is better than six golds and a silver," Spitz
said. But Spitz's coach, Sherm Chavoor, called him a chicken and
warned that he might be left off the relay if he didn't swim the 100.</LD>
<TE>   Spitz swam, setting a world record in 51.22 seconds. Heidenreich
was second in 51.65.</TE>
<TE>   Heidenreich, who would join Spitz the next day on the winning 400
medley relay team, won two gold medals, a silver and a bronze in
Munich. Swimming for Southern Methodist, he once beat Spitz's U.S.
record in the 200 freestyle by more than a second. But the
second-best swimmer of his era was not fast enough to escape Spitz's
shadow, especially with a demanding father--much like Spitz's--who
often would ask him, "Don't you ever get tired of coming in second to
Spitz?"</TE>
<TE>   Heidenreich, cocky and charismatic, returned to his native Dallas
after the Olympics and tried to maintain the facade created by his
nickname, "Mr. Wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   His life was anything but. He had difficulty finding jobs, then
holding them. A drinker since high school, he turned to drugs. He was
in and out of rehab.</TE>
<TE>   "He had tremendous pressure when he got back from the Olympics to
become successful," Larry Vanderwoude, a friend of Heidenreich, told
the Dallas Morning News. "His No.1 resentment was that Mark Spitz
became successful and Jerry didn't, that Mark made a lot of money and
Jerry didn't."</TE>
<TE>   In the late '80s, Heidenreich did something he vowed he never
would; he became a swim coach. In the pool, he found solace.</TE>
<TE>   But Heidenreich, whose father died in 1985, lost his brother to
pancreatic cancer in 1998 and his mother to emphysema in 2000. His
third marriage ended in divorce in 2001. His contract with a renowned
fitness center in Dallas wasn't renewed. He resumed smoking and
drinking. Shortly after, he suffered a mild stroke that resulted in
some paralysis on his left side and neurological damage.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, living with a girlfriend in Paris, Texas, and thinking
about coaching again, he couldn't swim in a straight line. On April
18, he took an overdose of pills and died on his bed. He left a
suicide note that, in part, said, "I just can't take it anymore." He
was 52.</TE>
<TE>   "There is always somebody that makes somebody great," Spitz told
the Morning News. "And Jerry Heidenreich was the reason I was great."</TE>

<HD>It's Not Same Old, Same Old, as Sampras Soaks In Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The sound came from deep within Pete Sampras. It was a howling,
yowling bellow of fear, of excitement, of desperate need, of
astounding conviction.</LD>
<LD>   Sampras had seen the tennis ball as it used to be, as larger than
life, approaching slowly, so slowly. Sampras was able to line up his
old friend, the one-handed backhand, plot a course for a return of
Greg Rusedski's second serve, make the ball curve and spin under
Rusedski's racket and then drop safely inside the line, a resounding
winner on a crucial point in the third-set tiebreaker of a five-set,
third-round victory Monday night at the U.S. Open.</LD>
<LD>   Before the ball landed, Sampras shook the tin walls of the main
stage here, Louis Armstrong Stadium, with a scream we've never heard
from the stoic champion.</LD>
<TE>   Sampras has vomited on this court, has wept in victory and in
exhausted defeat, has held up trophies and stood stone-faced as the
runner-up but never had he screamed like this, as if this single shot
validated him, validated his refusal to retire as a 31-year-old
winner of 13 Grand Slam titles, validated his inability to accept
that the whispers he hears are true, that he is slower, weaker, less
intimidating.</TE>
<TE>   A little later the beaten opponent, Rusedski, said: "He's not
playing great. I'd be surprised if he wins his next match against
[Tommy] Haas. To be honest with you, I'd be very surprised."</TE>
<TE>   But Sampras played great enough to beat Rusedski, 7-6 (4), 4-6,
7-6 (3), 3-6, 6-4, and advance to the fourth round. He played well
enough to bring the wet, shivering fans to the point of chanting his
name.</TE>
<TE>   All around the grounds there were astounding matches, night
matches everywhere after nearly two days of rain. But on every
changeover, the Armstrong aisles would be crowded with fans
scrambling up the wet steps. They'd heard the screams, the rumble of
an epic percolating, and they wanted to see. Would Sampras, the great
champion, walk away with his head buried in a towel, or his fists
pumping in triumph?</TE>
<TE>   For all his adult life, Sampras has defined himself by what he did
with a racket and a ball at this court, at Wimbledon's Centre Court
and at the big, covered stadium in Melbourne, Australia. For a
decade, Sampras ruled with supreme confidence and a game both elegant
and elemental.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a step-and-a-half slow coming to the net," Rusedski said.
"You can get the ball down. He's just not the same player. I mean,
he's a great player from the past."</TE>
<TE>   Sports are cruel and so are sportsmen, and that's what they say
when a man such as Sampras hasn't won a title in more than two years.</TE>
<TE>   Rusedski, once a U.S. Open finalist, tried to present his own
resume as something special--"It's not like I haven't been to a U.S.
Open finals, it's not like I haven't won 12 titles, it's not like I
haven't beaten [Andre] Agassi, Sampras, [Andy] Roddick, players of
that stature, it's not that I haven't been able to do it."</TE>
<TE>   But Rusedski hasn't been able to do it when it matters, when the
pressure is the greatest. Nobody has done it as often as Sampras, 13
times a winner in the finals of Grand Slams, and because of that
Sampras has seemed puzzled that so many seem so eager to have him
walk away from the game on someone else's terms, rather than his own.</TE>
<TE>   Why is Sampras demeaning himself? That's what other players wonder
quietly in the locker room. Why is he diminishing the memories,
leaving us with the fresh impression of a balding, hunched-over,
sad-eyed loser instead of the greatest player ever?</TE>
<TE>   This is why:</TE>
<TE>   "Let's go Pete. Let's go Pete. Let's go Pete."</TE>
<TE>   It is what the people want. Pete winning one more Slam title.</TE>
<TE>   It was that backhand service return winner, the one where Sampras
just let go, just swung with his heart and the ball whipped by
Rusedski. And it was the slam-dunk overheads, three of them, which
made the crowd roar.</TE>
<TE>   "The people and the atmosphere out on Louis was something I was
enjoying," Sampras said. "Those are moments that as you get a little
bit older, you kind of cherish a little bit more. The people were
really, really pulling for me."</TE>
<TE>   Sampras is slower. Rusedski is correct. Sampras arrives at the net
too late sometimes to crack the angular, unhittable volleys that made
him the king of Wimbledon. Rusedski also said Sampras offers up too
many second serves, and that someone young and strong such as Haas
will feast on those easy balls.</TE>
<TE>   Those second serves still huddle in the corners of the service box
or kick cruelly into the body of the receiver. They are not easy to
return, and when Sampras finds his rhythm, and he can, then the rest
of his game becomes smoother.</TE>
<TE>   Haas, seeded No. 3, has beaten Sampras three consecutive times. It
has been four years since Sampras beat the German. If Sampras loses
today, what happened Monday will be forgotten by everyone except
Sampras. He will hear, again, how he should quit, how he shouldn't
return to this stage.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Sampras will remember the cheers. He will still feel the
passion from the stands, and his hand will still tingle from the feel
of the two sparkling passing shots he hit in the final game Monday.
And that's still enough for Sampras. For now.</TE>

<LD>I presume as soon as the Dodgers got word of my birthday Monday they
immediately put 19 runs on the Diamondbacks to celebrate the fact I
am one year closer to retirement.</LD>
<LD>   But you can imagine the pressure the young Trojans must have felt
before the game in the locker room when Coach Pete Carroll said,
"Boys, we're going to win this one for T.J."</LD>
<LD>   Now I can't say for sure those were Carroll's exact words, but I
can't imagine what else he would have said to inspire the Trojans to
slip past Auburn, 24-17, Monday in the Coliseum.</LD>
<TE>   The game had been originally scheduled for Aug. 31, and while I
understand it was Buddy's 76th birthday and a special occasion, I
have a feeling "Win one for Hackett" wasn't going to work with these
guys. So they moved it to my birthday.</TE>
<TE>   As for those players who think they've won a trip to Tijuana, I
guess they still owe me a gift.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A GAME ball might be nice. I've got two, you know.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers gave me one and had it professionally painted to look
just like the ones they award to their players on those rare
occasions when they win a game. Apparently they thought I did
something really wonderful too, and all I was doing was leaving town
to move to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   I also received a game ball from the Raiders, who spelled my name
"Simmers." That was better than "Sinners," because then I would have
felt we had something in common.</TE>
<TE>   As a USC convert, I'm still learning about Trojan tradition and I
would certainly hope they do this for all their fans, but I
appreciate the fly over by four military jets and the fireworks after
the game to mark this day. I think the fact no one mentioned my
birthday before the fly over or the fireworks made it a much bigger
surprise, and I would imagine it was pretty hard for some of these
USC people to avoid talking to me all day. They sure know how to keep
a secret though.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ESPN/USA Today poll released earlier Monday had the Trojans
moving from No. 19 to No. 16 in the top 25 without having played. I
thought about slipping a note to Carroll before the game to tell him
the team's best chance of making it to the bowl championship series
title game was not playing this year, but I was afraid he might
interpret that as a wise crack rather than trying to help.</TE>
<TE>   I felt better when Auburn took the field, because the Tigers
weren't very good. The best thing they had going for them was a
running back nicknamed, "Cadillac," who kept breaking down with
cramps. That's something you'd expect from a running back nicknamed
"Escort."</TE>
<TE>   That reminds me, and I know I digress, but every few minutes when
you go to a USC or UCLA game these days, you're going to be reminded
that both institutions are contesting something called the Lexus
Challenge.</TE>
<TE>   I don't have any idea what the bogus competition is all about, but
the folks at Lexus had to be pretty ticked when DeShaun Foster got
into all that publicity last year for driving around in a Ford.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OK, BACK to the game, and if being a true-cardinal and gold fan
means living and dying with every Carson Palmer pass, I worry now
about how many more birthdays I'm going to have. I know he's hellbent
on completing every pass he throws, and I guess he's pretty good at
that when you include the 41 passes he has thrown to the opposition
over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer finished with 302 yards and a victory by falling forward on
his face, but if I have this right, so far he's thrown 40 touchdown
passes in his USC career and 41 interceptions. I'm pulling for him to
complete his education here with more touchdown passes than mistakes,
but I wonder if this is why Tommy Trojan is facing away from the
Coliseum from his post on campus--unable to watch any more when
Palmer goes back to pass.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to rooting for Palmer, I'll also be happy if the USC
brain trust learns to count to 12, but that might be a Pacific 10
thing and have something to do with the conference's academic
standards. The Trojans' failure to count to 12 gave Auburn the ball
back after a punt because of a penalty for having too many players in
the field, and the same kind of math problem led to Washington losing
at Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans are 1-0, and they have those numbers in the right
order. And I couldn't be happier--until I get my game ball.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE TROJANS open next season at Auburn on Aug. 30, and for those
fans who can't wait to make the trip, the name "Auburn," comes from
the Oliver Goldsmith poem: "The Deserted Village." Don't fret, I'm
sure there's a Motel 6 nearby.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN THE Trojans took the field for pre-game warmups, instead of
being greeted by cheering fans they heard a loud advertisement for
the House of Blues on the Mitsubishi screen atop the Carl's Jr.
scoreboard at the Miller Lite, Panasonic, Verizon and Los Angeles
Times' end of the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   That was immediately followed by an ad for Bank of the West, Lexus
and then finally Sipowicz telling everyone over his Nextel telephone
he doesn't do commercials, which was a relief for everyone who had
come to watch a football game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AFTER COLORADO State upset Colorado, quarterback Bradlee Van Pelt
called the Buffaloes "the worst No. 6 team we have ever played."</TE>
<TE>   Wonder what he will call the Bruins after Saturday's game in the
Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from James Heffon:</TE>
<TE>   "We've heard from Hootie and from the woman who wants to take the

<HD>Galaxy Aims to Reach Cup Title Match</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While some may see the U.S. Open Cup as an unneeded distraction that
can cause a team to lose focus in the heat of league play, the Galaxy
finds great dignity in defending a championship.</LD>
<LD>   It also helps that the Galaxy is two victories from repeating as
champion of the country's oldest soccer tournament, which dates to
1914, and that the team plays the Dallas Burn in a semifinal match
tonight at 8 at Cal State Fullerton's Titan Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously there's a lot of pride there because not only is it our
first domestic championship, but whenever you have something, you
want to keep it," Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said. "You don't want to
give it away.</LD>
<TE>   "Plus, Dallas is taking this very seriously too."</TE>
<TE>   As has been the case in the Open Cup, Matt Reis will replace Kevin
Hartman in the goal and Schmid won't be shy to go to his bench.</TE>
<TE>   All Major League Soccer clubs received byes into the Open Cup's
third round. The Galaxy beat the Minnesota Thunder of the A-League,
4-0, July 17 and the San Jose Earthquakes, 1-0, in overtime, Aug. 7.</TE>
<TE>   The Burn has two overtime victories--2-1 over the A-League's
Atlanta Silverbacks and 1-0 over the Colorado Rapids.</TE>
<TE>   The Open Cup's other semifinal is Tuesday between the Columbus
Crew and Kansas City Wizards.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's match can be seen live on Fox Sports World and Fox
Sports World Espanol, and tickets, which cost between $10 and $20,
can be purchased by calling 1-877-342-5299.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo Gets Real</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid's newest acquisition, Brazilian striker Ronaldo,
arrived in Spain on Monday and promised to bring "beautiful" football
to the top-ranked club in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a very great desire to come to Real Madrid and I hope to
respond with goals and some beautiful play so that I can live up to
everything that is expected of me," Ronaldo said at a news conference
trumpeting his arrival.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo, 25, led Brazil to the World Cup championship this summer
and signed a four-year contract with Real Madrid after leaving
Italy's Inter Milan in a $46.3-million deal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great day for Real Madrid," team President Florentino
Perez told Reuters. "The mixture of Real Madrid and Ronaldo is
perfect because of the universal appeal that both possess.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no doubt that he will help write many more glorious pages
in the history of a club that already has a past that is brimming
with success."</TE>
<TE>   Perez said the deal was made possible by Ronaldo taking a pay cut
and because Real Madrid agreed to compensate Inter Milan for the
financial loss it would suffer because of the broken contract with
Ronaldo's sponsor, Nike.</TE>
<TE>   Perez told television station Telemadrid that the club was covered
in case Ronaldo, who has battled knee problems the last three years,
is injured again.</TE>
<TE>   "The agreement with Inter includes a clause which allows us to
stop paying for the player if he suffers the same injury," Perez
said. "Ronaldo himself has also said that he will renounce his salary
if that happens."</TE>
<TE>   Arrivederci Ahn</TE>
<TE>   Ahn Jung-Hwan's goal in the World Cup helped co-host South Korea
upset Italy. But it also may have ended the midfielder's stay with
Italy's Serie A league team, Perugia, which announced Monday that it
had transferred Ahn's rights to an Asian business consortium in a
$3-million deal.</TE>
<TE>   "Ahn should be grateful to Perugia and [Coach Serse] Cosmi to have
grown here and been able to play a big role in the World Cup,"
Perugia President Luciano Gaucci was quoted as saying by the news
agency ANSA.</TE>
<TE>   After Ahn's game-winner, Gaucci was quoted as threatening to
dismiss Ahn because he had the audacity to score against Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Ahn, who had played sparingly for Perugia the previous two
seasons, had not joined the club since the war of words began. A
reported deal to send him to England's Blackburn Rovers fell through
last month.</TE>

<HD>A Wet and Wild Open Sprinkles In Some Fun</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Play doesn't begin until the evening because of
rain, but results are memorable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Fitting 17 singles matches into about a six-hour time frame was never
going to be easy, not as hard as slipping into one of Serena
Williams' self-dubbed catsuits, but still a tight fit on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Seventeen did not go into six at the U.S. Open, but it certainly
made for compelling theater on another inclement day. Rain forced
another unrelenting delay, trashing the schedule for the second day
in a row.</LD>
<LD>   Play did not start until 6:18 p.m. EDT, a fourth-round match
between No. 4 Lindsay Davenport and No. 13 Silvia Farina Elia of
Italy, which Davenport won quickly, 6-3, 6-1, in 58 minutes. In what
is believed to be an Open first, officials started a match after 11
p.m., sending out Younes El Aynaoui of Morocco and Wayne Ferreira of
South Africa. Aynaoui prevailed, 3-6, 7-5, 7-5, 7-6 (3), to close out
the schedule at 2:14 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   In between was some of the most entertaining tennis in the
shortest time period ever seen at the Open, in quality and quantity.</TE>
<TE>   Back-to-back on Louis Armstrong Stadium, came the roars of the old
lion of U.S. tennis (Pete Sampras) and, well, the young lion (Andy
Roddick).</TE>
<TE>   Those ear-shattering noises from that court were not from planes
flying overhead. First, the No. 17 Sampras, an Open finalist last
year, defeated Greg Rusedski of Great Britain, 7-6 (4), 4-6, 7-6 (3),
3-6, 6-4, followed by No. 11 Andy Roddick, who beat Alex Corretja of
Spain, 6-4, 6-1, 7-6 (6). Both were third-round matches.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras and Rusedski had nearly played a set Sunday before rain
suspended action. On Monday, Sampras had to sit around all day, and
then started against Rusedski in a fairly tight spot, serving at 4-5.
He got out of it by fighting off another set point, his third, in the
12th game.</TE>
<TE>   In the first-set tiebreaker, Rusedski led 3-1, but Sampras
finished strongly, winning six of the last seven points.</TE>
<TE>   But he was unable to sustain the momentum, dropping the second
set, 6-4, losing his serve in the third game. That was the pattern.
An emotional high point in the match would almost certainly result in
a low spell.</TE>
<TE>   For all of Sampras' troubles, there was a positive: Rusedski was
on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian-turned-Brit is something of a target in New York,
taking his share of verbal abuse here over the years after
consistently losing epics, tightening at the most critical moments.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoyed playing," said Sampras, who will meet Tommy Haas of
Germany in the fourth round. "That's why I'm still here because I
look forward to the challenge, and each match gets a little bit
tougher."</TE>
<TE>   Rusedski and Sampras have never been close, to put it mildly. On
the court, Rusedski complained to the chair umpire that Sampras was
getting favorable treatment. But that was nothing compared to
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, when it counted, I gave him a little bit too much
respect," Rusedski said. "You can't give a player that status, that
much leeway."</TE>
<TE>   So he quit respecting him on the spot and predicted he would lose
to Haas today. Rusedski then made another harsh comparison about
Sampras, who is five years older than anybody in his half of the
draw.</TE>
<TE>   "If he doesn't get to the finals, he's going to take a big drop,"
he said. "The men's game is tough. If you lose a step, look what
happened to [Michael] Chang so far. I mean, the guy was one of the
greatest players ever. He lost one step, half a step. This is very
tough."</TE>
<TE>   The calmest American male on the premises was No. 6 Andre Agassi,
who had little trouble against Jan-Michael Gambill, winning, 6-2,
6-3, 6-3, in the fourth round. Agassi, who has not dropped a set, was
asked to comment on Rusedski's remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "I would deduce from that comment that Greg really didn't like the
way he played," Agassi said.</TE>
<TE>   Calm is not always a word associated with Roddick. He finished at
about 12:15 a.m. local time, and his match against Corretja became
increasingly spirited. Late in the third set, Corretja called the
chair umpire a word not suitable for publication, and Roddick used
some choice words to capture his excitement.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to fight till the end," said Roddick, who will play
Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina tonight in the fourth round. "He
[Corretja] is in great shape. He has no problem going five sets. Alex
doesn't miss much. On the last point, I didn't want to miss."</TE>
<TE>   The last point, which was Roddick's fourth match point, came after
an intense baseline rally. The youngster was still breathing hard
during his TV interview. "I just finished about a 253-stroke rally,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Action was more orderly on the women's side. There were only two
upsets, most notably No. 11 Daniela Hantuchova's 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 (4)
victory against No. 8 Justine Henin of Belgium in the fourth round.
The 19-year-old Slovak hurt her ankle and right thumb in a
scary-looking tumble against Henin in the second set when the court
got slippery on Sunday just before action stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of the toughest matches I ever played," Hantuchova
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I hurt the ankle and I realized the thumb was even worse. During
the night, the ankle even started to hurt worse."</TE>
<TE>   She had the thumb and wrist wrapped but had the tape removed after
losing the second set. The second surprise was caused by No. 10
Amelie Mauresmo of France, who beat No. 7 Kim Clijsters of Belgium,
4-6, 6-3, 7-5.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Toledo Will Use Olson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA is sticking to the plan.</LD>
<LD>   Even though it turns out Colorado State is more formidable than
expected.</LD>
<LD>   Even though a Bruin victory is more necessary than ever to steer
attention back to football after cornerback Ricky Manning Jr.'s
arrest last week on felony assault charges.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, the plan still calls for freshman quarterback Drew Olson to
take the field at some point during the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Even though senior Cory Paus has never appeared more prepared.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Bruins can hardly afford a turnover or other
rookie mistake against an opponent that is 2-0 and defeated No. 7
Colorado on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to play Drew Olson in the second quarter," Coach Bob
Toledo said. "How much he plays, I have no idea. When we put him in,
I don't know yet."</TE>
<TE>   But Olson will go because Toledo wants to be ready for a
worst-case scenario--an injury to Paus.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a senior and then three freshmen quarterbacks who have
never played in a game," Toledo said. "Cory has had some injuries. I
hope he doesn't get hurt, but if something happens, that's why we're
going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Olson, who won the back-up job by beating out redshirt freshman
John Sciarra and freshman Matt Moore, has been giving his debut a lot
of thought--and even a little daydreaming.</TE>
<TE>   "All week I'm just going to prepare and study hard so I can give
the team an opportunity to succeed when I'm in there," he said. "I
don't want to be a freshman with his head spinning. That would let
down the team.</TE>
<TE>   "I've visualized throwing touchdown passes and doing things
correctly. Everybody does. That would be an awesome situation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Olson is only one of several Bruin freshmen who will be force-fed
into playing time.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of our guys are playing for the first time," Toledo said.
"I started getting a little nervous about how young we are. Ten
redshirt freshmen will play in this game and nine true freshmen might
play."</TE>
<TE>   Compounding the nervousness of youth will be the natural anxiety
of playing an opener. At home. Against an opponent whose two
victories have vaulted it to No. 19 in the rankings.</TE>
<TE>   "[Colorado State] definitely has an advantage of playing two games
because they are in game shape and have gotten rid of rustiness,"
Paus said. "But playing at home is a little advantage and we will be
excited to play our first game. I'd have to give them the edge as far
as having played two games and having in-game preparation."</TE>
<TE>   Bruin receiver Tab Perry can't imagine Colorado State hanging with
UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a decent team, but we're going to be better," he said.
"I don't believe in the rankings. That doesn't mean a thing. Not
having played isn't a disadvantage for us. We're more fresh."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colorado State Coach Sonny Lubick seconds Perry's motion, at least
about the polls.</TE>
<TE>   "We're flattered to be where we are and be mentioned," he said.
"But early on you can't put much credence in it. If we're ranked high
at the end of the year, I'll take a picture of it and hang it in the
locker room."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman defensive end C.J. Niusulu will sit out about four weeks
after having surgery to repair a torn cartilage in his right knee.
Niusulu, who is facing felony battery charges stemming from a July
fight at a Barstow drive-in theater, probably will be a redshirt.</TE>

<KH>USC 24, AUBURN 17</KH>
<HD>Trojans Put It in Drive</HD>
<DH>College football: They control fourth quarter of season
opener, eating up 8:39 on march to Palmer's sneak for the winning
touchdown with 1:26 to play.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC players knew they were on the national stage Monday night against
Auburn and they were determined to show that they could defeat a
Southeastern Conference team.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans and Auburn shared the spotlight in the first three
quarters, but USC hogged it in the final 15 minutes and won, 24-17,
before a crowd of 63,269 at the Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   "This was a great way to start the season," defensive end Omar
Nazel said. "We showed a lot of people that we are going to keep
coming. We showed them that we are going to play until the end."</LD>
<TE>   Senior quarterback Carson Palmer engineered the game-winning
50-yard, 13-play drive that ate up 8 minutes 39 seconds in the fourth
quarter. He capped it with a one-yard sneak with 1:26 left to break a
17-17 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer completed 23 of 32 passes for 302 yards and a touchdown
with two interceptions. He spread the wealth, completing passes to
eight receivers.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't face too many quarterbacks like him," Auburn Coach Tommy
Tuberville said.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, however, was not elated with his performance.</TE>
<TE>   "In the first half, I didn't feel comfortable," Palmer said. "I
missed a couple of huge balls. The second half was better. It still
is not good enough.... I expect to be perfect and I should be
perfect."</TE>
<TE>   Running back Malaefou MacKenzie, a sixth-year senior, turned in a
career performance for the Trojans, catching six passes for 117 yards
and gaining 33 yards in 10 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Kareem Kelly caught six passes for 66 yards,
including a 14-yard touchdown pass from Palmer on USC's first
possession.</TE>
<TE>   But USC won by dominating possession in the second half, which
limited opportunities for Auburn running back Carnell "Cadillac"
Williams, who gained 97 yards in 14 carries in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans controlled the ball for 9 minutes 23 seconds in the
third quarter and 12:12 in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a chance in the first half to get the game under control,
but we had some difficulties and it didn't happen for us," USC Coach
Pete Carroll said. "We responded the way we needed to in the second
half."</TE>
<TE>   USC outgained Auburn, 386-281, and Trojan defensive players said
the key was adjustments made at halftime, when the score was 14-14.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't do anything fancy, we just went back to our base
defense," linebacker Melvin Simmons said. "We kept it simple and
challenged them to beat us."</TE>
<TE>   The score was tied at halftime after USC scored on Palmer's pass
to Kelly with 12:05 left in the first quarter and a three-yard run by
Sultan McCullough with 12:04 left in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn stayed even with a 23-yard touchdown run by Williams in the
first quarter and a one-yard "run" by Ronnie Brown, who recovered a
goal-line fumble by quarterback Daniel Cobb in the air and barely
scored with 11 seconds left in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like we kind of fell apart in the second half," said
Williams, who finished with 94 yards in 21 carries. "It was team
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Auburn's downfall did not occur until the fourth quarter, after
David Davis kicked a 37-yard yard field goal to put USC ahead, 17-14,
with 7:05 left in the third quarter and Auburn's Damon Duval tied the
score with a 39-yard field goal with 14:41 to play in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   USC drove to the Auburn 19 on the ensuing possession, but lost the
ball when Kelly fumbled after catching a pass with 11:32 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, however, forced Auburn to punt, setting the stage for
the winning drive.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer completed passes of 18 yards to Kelly, eight yards to
fullback Sunny Byrd and nine yards to MacKenzie. McCullough rushed on
five consecutive plays before Palmer scored the game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   "We just kept grinding it out," said McCullough, who finished with
58 yards in 20 carries. "This team is different this year. The
offensive line did a great job."</TE>
<TE>   Both teams turned turnovers into touchdowns in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Williams gained 24 yards for Auburn on the first play, but two
plays later USC linebacker Mike Pollard caused and recovered a fumble
on a scramble by Cobb, giving USC the ball at the Auburn 41.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer then completed three passes during a five-play drive, the
final one the 14-yard strike to Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   USC forced Auburn to punt on the ensuing possession, but Palmer
gave the ball back to the Tigers when linebacker Karlos Dansby
intercepted a pass intended for Kelly at the Trojan 23.</TE>
<TE>   Williams didn't waste any time capitalizing. He took a handoff
from Cobb and ran through five potential tacklers on the left side
for a touchdown with 8:31 left in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   With the score 7-7, Auburn drove from its 20 to the USC 18 in the
final 3:30 of the first quarter. But on the first play of the second
quarter, Nazel intercepted Cobb's pass intended for Williams in the
right flat and returned it to the Trojan 40.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even see the ball, I just felt it hit my hands and I
took off running," Nazel said.</TE>
<TE>   USC drove to the Auburn 26 where, on fourth and one, Palmer
completed a 12-yard pass to receiver Grant Mattos.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough ran 11 yards off left tackle for a first down, then
rambled over right tackle for a three-yard touchdown to put the
Trojans ahead, 14-7.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn safety Junior Rosegreen set up Auburn's final scoring drive
of the half by intercepting a pass by Palmer at the Tiger nine-yard
line with 6:54 left.</TE>
<TE>   USC was penalized for having 12 men on the field on an Auburn punt
early in the drive.</TE>
<TE>   Eight plays later, the Trojans were called for a personal foul
after a four-yard run by Williams, giving Auburn a first down at the
USC 12.</TE>
<TE>   Brown rushed for 10 yards to give Auburn a first down at the two
with 11 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Two plays later, Cobb dropped back to pass, then scrambled toward
the right corner of the end zone. Safety DeShaun Hill knocked the
ball out of Cobb's hands and into the air, but Brown caught it at the
one and forced his way across the goal line for a touchdown.</TE>

<HD>Graf Lives a Longtime Dream</HD>

<AU>Rob Fernas, Gary Klein and Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Derek Graf said a dream came true Monday night when he started at
right guard for USC against Auburn.</LD>
<LD>   Graf, a fifth-year senior who persevered through four
injury-plagued seasons, drew the starting assignment in place of
freshman Fred Matua. The son of former Trojan lineman Allan Graf, who
played on USC's 1972 national championship team, said he thought
about the moment for years.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't even describe what I'm feeling right now," Derek Graf
said after the Trojans defeated Auburn, 24-17, at the Coliseum.</LD>
<TE>   Matua, who suffered a bruised knee Thursday, entered the game in
the first quarter and then began rotating series with Graf, but fell
short in his bid to become the first freshman to start an opener for
the Trojans on the offensive line since Travis Claridge in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "That's OK," Matua said. "I was just happy to contribute to such a
great win. This is a great way to start a career."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC is 14-10-1 against Southeastern Conference schools. Monday's
victory was the Trojans' first over an SEC school since Sept. 12,
1981, when they defeated Tennessee, 43-7, at the Coliseum in USC's
season opener.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn is 4-2 against Pacific 10 Conference teams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While USC gets a bye next week, Monday night's game was the first
of four Auburn will play in 18 days.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers took a red-eye flight home after the game and will
start preparations for Saturday's home opener against Western
Carolina. Auburn plays Vanderbilt on Sept. 14 and plays Mississippi
State five days later.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The crowd took part in a moment of silence before the game to
honor the memory of legendary Trojan assistant Marv Goux, who died at
age 69 in July, and John Argue, who was chairman of USC's Board of
Trustees and helped bring the Olympics to Los Angeles in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Argue died last month at age 70.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Monday's victory gave the Trojans a 79-23-8 record in openers.</TE>
<TE>   USC is 57-16-7 in season openers at home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carson Palmer scored the winning touchdown and passed for 302
yards, but USC's quarterback wasn't impressed with a performance that
included two interceptions and other mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth-year senior said he needs to work on "a ton of stuff."</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't play very well at all," he said. "In the first half I
was all over the place. At least I've got two weeks to work on it."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans have 11 days before playing at Colorado on Sept. 14.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With an assist from UCLA, Auburn quarterback Daniel Cobb was able
to continue playing football after a rare medical condition allowed
him to earn a sixth year of NCAA eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   After Cobb signed with Georgia in 1997, doctors discovered a blood
clot five inches from his heart that limited the flow of blood to his
right arm. He underwent surgery to remove his first rib to correct
the condition, known as Paget-von Schrotter Syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   He developed complications, but after seeing a vascular surgeon at
UCLA, Cobb played in his first football game in two years at Butler
County (Kan.) Community College in 1999--leading the team to the
national title--before transferring to Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   Cobb got off to a rough start in his return to Southern California
on Monday. His turnovers, a fumble and an interception, led to USC's
two first-half touchdowns. He also fumbled at the Trojan goal line in
the waning seconds of the second quarter, but the ball was caught by
tailback Ronnie Brown for an Auburn touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In heat that hovered around 90 degrees, everyone seemed to agree
that the Trojans seemed to have an endurance advantage during their
dominating second half.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in better shape than them," said defensive lineman Shaun
Cody. "It was that simple."</TE>
<TE>   Those sentiments were echoed in actions by Tiger running back
Carnell Williams, who suffered cramps late in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say what happened in the second half, it just seemed like
we fell apart," Williams said. "I didn't do a good job finding holes
... the cramps bothered me a little bit. It was in the back of my
mind."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kareem Kelly has caught a pass in each of his 36 USC games, one
game short of John Jackson's school record....The crowd of 62,269 was
the largest Coliseum crowd for a home opener since 1997 against
Florida State....The Trojans are unbeaten in their last five
regular-season games. ... Palmer now has more total yards than Rob
Johnson with 8,099, ranking second behind Rodney Peete, who amassed
8,640 yards....Palmer also passed Peete with 641 career completions,
and ranks second in that category behind Johnson, who has 676.</TE>

<HD>Wait Is Over for MacKenzie</HD>
<DH>Football: Oft-injured tailback plays significant role in
first game since 2000, helping USC beat Auburn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Malaefou MacKenzie waited a long time for Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   "It took six years, but it felt good to be out there," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes, it seems as if it has been that long since MacKenzie
played in a big game for USC. The oft-injured, sixth-year senior has
spent more time rehabilitating various injuries than showcasing his
talents at tailback.</LD>
<TE>   But that changed in the Trojans' 24-17 season-opening victory over
Auburn at the Coliseum. MacKenzie not only managed to get through the
game unscathed, he had a career night before a boisterous crowd of
63,269.</TE>
<TE>   He made his presence felt on USC's first play from scrimmage,
catching a short pass from quarterback Carson Palmer and turning it
into a 15-yard gain. MacKenzie continued to catch Auburn's defense
off guard, leading the Trojans with six receptions for 117 yards,
both career bests.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first 100-yard receiving game by a Trojan running back
since Mike Garrett had 122 yards receiving against California in
1964. Not bad for someone playing in his first game since the 2000
season.</TE>
<TE>   "It was awesome to be out there playing with my brothers," said
MacKenzie, who had 33 yards in 10 carries. "I try to contribute any
way I can."</TE>
<TE>   Sultan McCullough got the bulk of the carries at tailback, but
MacKenzie was frequently paired with McCullough in the backfield. By
lining up in the slot and sometimes going into motion, MacKenzie
found himself open several times on pass patterns.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the plan coming in," MacKenzie said. "We didn't know how
they would react to two tailbacks in the game. We caught them off
guard. [Auburn] got kind of lost. Carson saw that real easily and got
the ball to me."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer and MacKenzie hooked up for completions of 15, 19, 37 and
32 yards. MacKenzie's 16-yard run in the third quarter helped set up
a 37-yard field goal by David Davis that gave the Trojans a 17-14
lead, and MacKenzie caught a nine-yard pass on the winning drive,
ending with Palmer's one-yard sneak with 1:26 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so happy for the guy," Palmer said. "He stepped up. That's
what we expect from him.... The way we look at it, there's no
linebacker in the country who can cover him, and he proved that
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Said Coach Pete Carroll of MacKenzie: "He caught the ball great
and made some big-time plays for us."</TE>
<TE>   MacKenzie was granted a rare sixth year of eligibility by the NCAA
because he sat out two seasons because of "medical or extraordinary
circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   He sat out the 2001 season after a series of setbacks. He was
sidelined for USC's first two games because of a sprained right knee,
sat out the third while attending his father's funeral in Western
Samoa and sat out the next two after re-spraining his knee in
practice.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, he decided to leave the team and return to Western
Samoa for the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Such disappointments were nothing new for MacKenzie. He sat out
four games in 1999 because of a pulled left hamstring, after being
injured in USC's 1998 opener against Purdue and undergoing
season-ending surgery on his left knee. Although he became only the
third freshman to start at tailback for USC in 1997, he was hindered
much of the season by foot and shoulder injuries.</TE>
<TE>   After his knee surgery, MacKenzie wondered if he would be able to
play football again. But his faith remained strong and provided the
foundation for his numerous comebacks. He has been healthy since
having arthroscopic surgery on his right knee last spring.</TE>
<TE>   He called Monday's game "bittersweet." After everything MacKenzie
has endured during his USC career, maybe that's as good as it gets
right now.</TE>

<HD>Pierce's Shooting Lifts U.S.</HD>
<DH>Basketball: Forward scores 27 points in 106-82 second-round
win over Russia at World Championships.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Paul Pierce put on such a show, it made Reggie Miller's debut merely
a footnote.</LD>
<LD>   Pierce had another of his scoring blitzes Monday night, cementing
his status as the U.S. team's best offensive player. He made seven
consecutive shots and scored 20 of his 27 points in the third quarter
to lead the United States to a 106-82 victory over Russia in a
second-round game.</LD>
<LD>   Pierce has led the Americans in scoring in all four of their games
at the World Championships, including three in the preliminary round.</LD>
<TE>   "He's one of those scorers who scores a big number of points in a
very short period of time," U.S. Coach George Karl said. "It's kind
of fun to watch. I told him after the game that I like shows, and
that was a pretty good show."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, sidelined for the first three games by an ankle sprain,
provided a thrill after checking into the tournament. He made his
first appearance with 2:13 left in the second quarter, coming in to a
nice ovation after the U.S. opened a 50-38 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Miller committed a turnover the first time he touched the ball,
throwing a bad pass, but he quickly redeemed himself. After a Russian
missed a layup on a two-on-one fast break, Miller grabbed the rebound
and then found himself open at the three-point line. He made the shot
just before the buzzer to give the Americans a 54-44 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "If Reggie doesn't make those three points, maybe the game is more
interesting than it was," Russia Coach Stanislav Eremine said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. hadn't looked all that special in its previous two games
at the World Championships, with Germany keeping it close for three
quarters and China opening a big early lead.</TE>
<TE>   But this one was much more to the Americans' liking and Pierce was
the player who turned it into a rout.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce had 10 of the first 12 points of the second half for the
U.S. and scored consecutive three-point baskets later in the quarter
for an 80-59 lead. He followed a tip by Ben Wallace with another
three-point basket to put the U.S. ahead, 85-61.</TE>
<TE>   "I just tried to give us some energy. I always believe the most
important times of the game are the end of the half and the start of
the second half," Pierce said.</TE>
<TE>   His streak of seven consecutive baskets ended with 48 seconds left
in the third quarter when he had an airball from three-point range,
and he reacted with an embarrassed smile.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Miller scored 18 points for the U.S., which plays New
Zealand today and Argentina on Wednesday to complete the second
round.</TE>
<TE>   Zakhar Pachoutine had 16 points to lead Russia, which was without
its only NBA player, Andrei Kirilenko, who sat out with a sore left
ankle. Kirilenko said he aggravated the injury at practice Sunday and
he could be sidelined for the rest of the tournament.</TE>
