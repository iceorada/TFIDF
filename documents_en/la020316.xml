<DH>The Jewish Museum defends the imagery in a show it calls a
face-to-face confrontation with the evil of Nazism.</DH>

<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A controversial exhibition at the Jewish Museum has made art critics
out of an unlikely group: Holocaust survivors.</LD>
<LD>   After seeing only the catalog of the exhibition, which opens
Sunday and features contemporary artworks that use Nazi imagery, some
survivors' groups called for a boycott, claiming the show is
repugnant and trivializes the Holocaust.</LD>
<LD>   For months now the New York press has been overrun with angry
criticisms and passionate defenses of art few have seen. One
columnist even derided it as a "Holofest."</LD>
<TE>   The museum has already responded by putting up warning signs in
the galleries. But anguish over the show is growing. Last week 150
Orthodox Jewish high school students shouted protests in front of the
eminent cultural institution, a few blocks up Fifth Avenue from the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   It's hardly the first art show to generate controversy in New
York. In 1999, the Brooklyn Museum of Art's "Sensation" infuriated
some New Yorkers, including then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, by including
a painting of the Virgin Mary whose dress was decorated with elephant
dung.</TE>
<TE>   This latest show similarly offends some viewers by challenging
taste and dissing the traditional approach to the past.</TE>
<TE>   The museum staff clearly anticipated that it might be crossing
lines with the show, "Mirroring Evil: Nazi Imagery/Recent Art," and
went to great lengths to place not just the most unsettling works but
all 19 in context and to explain the artists' collective mission (in
the catalog, in discussion forums, and in wall labels) to show the
horror of Nazism in a new way.</TE>
<TE>   This is work by a new generation of artists that, according to the
catalog, has "turned away from what has become a standard focus on
the ... victims and instead stared directly at the perpetrators. More
important, they created works in which viewers would encounter the
perpetrators face to face in scenarios in which ethical and moral
issues cannot be easily resolved."</TE>
<TE>   But some viewers have not been able to get past their gut
reactions to the pictures in the catalog. Never mind that each work
has some noble intent or some high-minded explanation. They cannot
understand why the Jewish Museum, of all places, is exhibiting Polish
artist Zbigniew Libera's Lego boxes for building a concentration camp
or a set of poison gas canisters by New York artist Tom Sachs made
out of Hermes, Tiffany and Chanel packaging, or a photograph of
Buchenwald inmates in which British artist Alan Schechner has
digitally inserted himself holding a can of Diet Coke.</TE>
<TE>   Menachem Rosensaft, the most outspoken opponent of the exhibition,
is disgusted by those works and is particularly galled by six
lifelike busts of Josef Mengele that gaze down at the viewer with an
eerie vividness. The intent of the artist, Christine Borland, to
question the difference between "participating in evil and
representing it," is lost on Rosensaft, whose mother, Hadassah, spent
15 months in Auschwitz, where Mengele tortured Jews.</TE>
<TE>   "Mengele beat my mother twice and personally sent her sister to
the gas chamber," Rosensaft says. "His bust does not belong in that
museum."</TE>
<TE>   The founding chairman of the International Network of Children of
Jewish Holocaust Survivors, Rosensaft cannot understand why such an
important institution has given its imprimatur to the Lego box
exhibit, artwork or not. "This was not children's play," says
Rosensaft.</TE>
<TE>   Norman Kleeblatt, the curator of the show, explained that this
work and others make powerful points about how we remember the past.
The Lego set, he says, suggests "how the building blocks of good
could be turned into the building blocks of evil." Other works
attempt to connect the images of the Third Reich to modern-day
perfume ads and explore how Nazism has been glamorized and
commodified.</TE>
<TE>   "Nazi imagery has been showing up during the last 20 years in pop
culture more and more," Kleeblatt says. "How do we navigate the
materials that we are bombarded with?"</TE>
<TE>   In one memorable piece, Boaz Arad, an Israeli artist, tries to
show how images of authority can be manipulated. Arad reedited
several film clips of Hitler propaganda speeches in German so the
viewer hears him say, "Hello, Jerusalem. I apologize," in Hebrew.</TE>
<TE>   Kleeblatt says the exhibition is trying "to begin a discussion
with a new generation about the Holocaust at a time when an older
generation can chime in." Most of the 13 artists are in their 30s and
40s; only four are Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   The show has been the talk of the art world since the catalog came
out in December and a Wall Street Journal reporter showed it to
Holocaust survivors who, not surprisingly, were infuriated.</TE>
<TE>   While reserving judgment, although not gossip, about the works
themselves, New York art cognoscenti have been speculating that such
a provocative show at a not often provocative museum would probably
draw crowds. But nobody had actually seen it until this week.</TE>
<TE>   The media preview Wednesday drew an unconventional mix of art
critics in wire-rimmed glasses, stylishly dressed reporters from
Berlin and elderly Jews in black yarmulkes.</TE>
<TE>   When some art-worldlings commented that Tom Sachs' "Prada
Deathcamp" pieces were "harmlessly amoral," Michael Berenbaum, a
defender of the exhibition and Holocaust expert at the University of
Judaism in Los Angeles, shouted sternly, "Not amoral, immoral!"</TE>
<TE>   Pouring out onto Fifth Avenue on a rainy morning, the critics were
mostly favorable. Like a lot of Conceptual art, most of these works
needed a lot of interpretation, they agreed. Many were powerful and
well-crafted, they decided. But more than a few pieces were simply
banal, they sniffed.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Robinson, editor of Artnet.com, admired several of the
pieces and brushed off the clamor surrounding them. "None of the
artists are blowing themselves up in cafes," Robinson said. "This is
an art exhibit, that's it."</TE>
<TE>   He said that the benign Nazi characters in the TV series "Hogan's
Heroes," created in the mid-1960s, and foolish ones in a revival on
Broadway of "The Producers" (the hardest ticket to get this season)
had not stirred similar boycotts and protests.</TE>
<TE>   "Why aren't [the Nazis] as offensive in popular culture as they
are here?" he said, gesturing toward the stone museum walls. That
question is raised in a five-minute video running continuously
outside the exhibition. The video, created by Maurice Berger, a
cultural historian, includes a clip of a chorus line of Nazis singing
"Springtime for Hitler" from Mel Brooks' movie version of "The
Producers."</TE>
<TE>   As the music blared, Berger explained that the art show will be a
great success if it provokes thoughtful discussions about such
matters.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the show could confuse a younger generation of viewers
who might mistake some of the more flippant works in the show for
lessons of history, Berger said, "It's an art exhibition. It's not a
history exhibition."</TE>

<HD>If the Rock Star Thing Fails, There's Law School</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN BRONSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She's studious enough to get accepted to law school at age 20, savvy
enough to steer an obscure pop group briefly into the limelight and
smart enough to pen lyrics that affect critics and fans alike.</LD>
<LD>   But when Elizabeth Elmore's band, Sarge, broke up in 1999,
devoured by its own ravenous personalities, she reacted like the
small-town Midwestern girl she is. "I got all melodramatic and
angst-ridden," she said recently. "I was 23. The band was my life, my
family. I was horrified."</LD>
<LD>   Just over two years later, with Northwestern Law School again on
hold, Elmore has regrouped. The self-titled debut album from her new
Chicago-based quartet, the Reputation, is due in two weeks from the
indie label Initial Records, and the band plays three shows in the
Southland this week, starting Sunday night at Chain Reaction in
Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm feeling much better now," Elmore joked on the eve of a
three-week, do-it-herself tour of the West, but anybody who
scrutinizes her latest work might wonder.</TE>
<TE>   In her new material, Elmore professes to be spurned, burned, cast
out, reviled and simply benumbed by recurring relationship wars. Amid
punky guitar bursts and simple melodies, she purges, asserting her
independence, pricking mindless partyers and straddling the line
between spiteful and contrite in "The Uselessness of Friends."</TE>
<TE>   Any residual vitriol points to her experience with Sarge, which
seemed poised to emerge from the indie masses after its second album,
"The Glass Intact" (1998). By year's end Rolling Stone and Spin
magazines christened Sarge a "hot band," acclaim for which Elmore was
not ready.</TE>
<TE>   She recalls playing a coffeehouse in Gulfport, Miss., in
100-degree temperatures. "In front of 15 kids," she said. That night
she learned via e-mail of a glowing review in Spin, "and I just kind
of shut down. I couldn't quite accept that what we were doing was
worth all the attention."</TE>
<TE>   As the band soldiered on into 1999, neither could her friends in
indie circles. "I got vilified behind my back," Elmore said. "'Why
the heck was she in Rolling Stone?' 'What did she do?' I got lucky. I
know I got lucky. Yes, I know a lot of it was because I was a girl.
But people thought my head was so much bigger than it was."</TE>
<TE>   It took a certain self-possession to survive--after all, she was
conducting most of Sarge's business (she booked the entire Reputation
tour, and did some of her own promotional work), as well as juggling
other responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Said Reputation guitarist Sean Hulet, who knew Elmore then: "How
many people can say they're going to law school, playing in a touring
rock band and trying to work too? Oh, and she likes to have fun.</TE>
<TE>   "Elizabeth is very tenacious, and it's one of those traits that
can drive you crazy until you get to know her."</TE>
<TE>   A demure Elmore might not have made it out of her one-stoplight
hometown of Rochester, Ill., let alone bounced back from her band's
demise. But after a year and a half of hitting the law books, she
dipped her toe in the icy waters of solo touring before hooking up
with Hulet, bassist Joel Root and a rotating cast of drummers.</TE>
<TE>   The Reputation's pop/punk novellas, told through Elmore's
jaded-choirgirl vocals, are more polished than the songs that earned
Sarge its press in '98. Whether the Reputation can distinguish
itself, Hulet says, might depend on how the band gets pigeonholed.</TE>
<TE>   "We tour with the punk and indie set," he said, "but we're not
angular and fashionable enough to be an indie band and we're not
hard-core enough to be a punk band."</TE>
<TE>   So they are a pop band with an attitude--Elmore's.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure that when I'm 40 I'll look back and say, 'I was a bad
22-year-old,'" she said. "But now I'm a lot more laid-back and
even-keeled. And I know people need a little break from me
sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   The Reputation, Local H, Chevelle and Burning Brides play at 7:30
p.m. Sunday at Chain Reaction, 1652 W. Lincoln Ave., Anaheim.
Tickets: $10. (714) 635-6067.</TE>
<TE>   The Reputation also plays at 8 p.m. Monday at Spaceland, 1717
Silver Lake Blvd., Silver Lake, (213) 833-2843; and at 7:30 p.m.
Wednesday at the Glass House, 200 W. 2nd St., Pomona, (909) 469-5800.</TE>

<HD>Conga Room Goes Eclectic--and Celtic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't surprising that the highly regarded Celtic group Danu would
turn up in town for an appearance around St. Patrick's Day. What was
surprising was the fact that the venue for Thursday's performance was
that shrine to salsa, the Conga Room. Actually, as it turns out, it
really wasn't all that unexpected, since the Conga Room management is
on a campaign to expand the club's bookings.</LD>
<LD>   Danu was one of several Celtic groups on the forecasted schedule,
and jazz will soon become a significant presence.But it's obviously
going to take a while for the word to get out that the Conga Room has
gone eclectic, since the turnout for Danu was slim. And that was a
shame, because the seven-piece ensemble lived up to its advance
notices, delivering a program of jigs, reels and ballads with spirit
and enthusiasm.</LD>
<LD>   Danu's program relied heavily on traditional music, as well as new
material composed in traditional style. Much of it traced to the
band's new album, "All Things Considered." What made it especially
appealing, however, was the manner in which the band dealt with the
traditional tunes.</LD>
<TE>   There was fine flute playing from Tom Doorley, warm-toned singing
from Ciaran O'Gealbhain and a versatile combination of bodhran
drumming and Uilleann piping from Donnchadh Gough.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that a set of attractive arrangements--featuring a blending
of violin, flute and two accordions to produce subtle instrumental
textures not always found in small ensemble Irish music--and the
results provided a compellingly original, strikingly contemporary
view of traditional Celtic sounds.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not long ago, Linda Ellerbee traveled to Afghanistan and toured
war-ravaged Kabul with a camera crew, hearing from "the most valuable
asset this devastated country has."</LD>
<LD>   Its youth.</LD>
<LD>   The result is "Faces of Hope: The Kids of Afghanistan," Sunday's
rewarding 30-minute special airing on Nickelodeon under the banner of
one of TV's most honored resources, "Nick News With Linda Ellerbee."
What a remarkable series for youngsters this has been through the
years.</LD>
<TE>   Some of Sunday's program is a status report, with Ellerbee telling
viewers what she is observing as she walks through parts of the
decimated capital. Somewhere outside the city, a teenager says in
English: "We need some water. There is no helping in this village."
Another adds: "We were scared from these people who have weapons."</TE>
<TE>   Later Ellerbee visits an Afghan family of 10 in a house where the
eight children sleep in one room. "What do you like to do for fun?"
she asks one of them. Based on the happy face we see, being
interviewed on TV will do for a start.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the program, though, consists of Ellerbee asking local
children questions from their U.S. counterparts, who have been
recorded on videotape. This long-range kid-to-kid dialogue has a
distinctive resonance.</TE>
<TE>   American girl with braces: "If you would have one wish, or any one
thing, what would you wish for?"</TE>
<TE>   Teenage boy in Kabul: "If I want to be a literate man, I have to
have a computer."</TE>
<TE>   The reply affirms what Ellerbee took away from her brief visit to
this region whose children have never known peace until now.
"Everywhere we look in what seems to be a hopeless situation," she
says, "we find hope."</TE>
<TE>   "Faces of Hope: The Kids of Afghanistan" will be shown Sunday
night at 8:30 on Nickelodeon. The network has rated it TV-Y
(appropriate for children of all ages).</TE>

<HD>Book Recalls Shuberts' 100 Years in Theater</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KUCHWARA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Gerald Schoenfeld had never been to the theater before going to work
for the law firm that handled business for the Shuberts--the
quixotic, combative dynasty that controlled much of Broadway's real
estate in the 20th century.</LD>
<LD>   "The only Schubert I had ever heard of was Franz Schubert, the
great composer," Schoenfeld confesses in the recently published "The
Shuberts Present: 100 Years of American Theater," a mammoth coffee
table book published by Abrams that celebrates the centenary of the
theatrical empire founded by three brothers--Lee, J.J. and Sam
Shubert.</LD>
<LD>   It is a lavish book, filled with rare photographs, drawings and
sketches that pay homage to the theaters, the last of which, the
Ethel Barrymore, was built in 1928.</LD>
<TE>   These days, more than 50 years after his first taste of things
theatrical, Schoenfeld, 77, runs the Shubert Organization in New York
City and around the country. For the last 30 years, it has been his
job as company chairman to fill the firm's many theaters, a juggling
act that requires skill and shrewdness, not to mention a little luck.</TE>
<TE>   Luck was what he needed in 1972 when he and another lawyer,
Bernard Jacobs, took over the tottering Shubert empire, taking
control at a time when Broadway was in decline and more than a few
Shubert houses sat empty.</TE>
<TE>   "There were not many hit shows," Schoenfeld says in his
straightforward, understated manner. He and Jacobs turned things
around first with such hit productions as "Pippin" and "Equus," and
then, in 1975, with "A Chorus Line."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bonanza," Schoenfeld recalls. "A bellwether event
because it was a product of the not-for-profit theater and the
Shubert Organization. That show really changed the perception of the
Broadway theater as far as nonprofit theaters were concerned."</TE>
<TE>   "A Chorus Line" was followed by "Ain't Misbehavin'," "Evita,"
"Amadeus," "Dreamgirls" and "Cats," the long-running Andrew Lloyd
Webber musical that held forth at the Shubert's Winter Garden Theatre
for nearly 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   "The object is to fill these theaters," Schoenfeld says simply,
either by producing shows themselves or booking other producer's
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "And if you are not in a time of plenty, then you put in whatever
you can find," he says.</TE>

<LD>All too often, Nazi-looted art from private collectors is too hastily
returned without any guarantee those works will ever again be on
public view. To Christopher Knight's statement that "no credible
argument can be made for keeping stolen art" ("Wartime Loot Gets a
Too-Hasty Boot," March 8), I would add the phrase "without due
compensation for the works stolen." Monetary compensation, yes, but
possession of the great work, certainly not.</LD>
<LD>   In lieu of this, however, any art of this nature returned to
rightful owners should at least carry with it a legal guarantee that
the work shall remain on public view with a reputable institution in
the country to which the work is being returned.</LD>
<LD>   There is certainly international precedent for this. Many
countries refuse to extradite foreign citizens charged with crimes in
their home countries unless there is a guarantee the death penalty
will not be sought.</LD>
<TE>   Returning great art to descendants without such legal guarantees
is tantamount to handing that work of art its very own form of a
death sentence.</TE>

<TE>   Tibet's Place on the Map</TE>
<TE>   While Don Heckman gave a fantastic review of the Tibetan Gyuto
Monks Tantric Choir's recent performance at UCLA ("Gyuto Monks Create
a Dreamlike Experience," March 11), he did a great disservice to the
cause of Tibetan independence from China, by stating that their
monastery was originally in "Lhasa, China."</TE>
<TE>   I'll guarantee that if you ask any one of those monks or any other
Tibetans (not working for the Chinese government) where Lhasa is,
they will respond "Tibet!" The irony is that he wrote the article on
the 43rd Tibetan Independence Day, which celebrates the 1959 Tibetan
Uprising against Chinese occupation in Lhasa, Tibet!</TE>

<TE>   'Terminator' Script Talk</TE>
<TE>   In her article about "Terminator 3," ("Rage Against the Machines:
'T3's' Rocky Road," March 11), Rachel Abramowitz unfairly maligned my
client Tedi Sarafian and the script he wrote for "T3."</TE>
<TE>   The first draft of Sarafian's script, as mentioned in a recent
article in the Wall Street Journal, was good enough to convince
Arnold Schwarzenegger to attach himself to the project without James
Cameron's commitment, even though Arnold had said publicly that he
would not do the film without Cameron.</TE>
<TE>   Sarafian's script was also good enough to attract Jonathan Mostow
as a director, hot off two successful films. Sarafian's script was
also good enough for Andy Vanja and Mario Kassar to move the project
forward by structuring a deal with Schwarzenegger.</TE>
<TE>   I don't put much stock in whether Sarafian's script was panned or
received a rave on the Internet. Who knows if the people writing
about it even read the script?</TE>
<TE>   Reaction on one Web site at this early stage will have little
bearing on the quality or success of the film. What Sarafian and his
writing accomplished in helping to pull together this sequel is far
more important.</TE>

<TE>   A Blast From a Blaster</TE>
<TE>   During the past few months, Dave Alvin--along with pianist Bill
Bateman--sat in with the Blasters on several occasions and each time
he was generous in his praise, even suggesting that the current
lineup is "the best Blasters ever."</TE>
<TE>   To now see him quoted in print ("Original Blast," by Richard
Cromelin, March 9) as saying that "the name of the band has been
besmirched" and that it's up to him to "redeem the name of the band"
is extraordinarily disheartening for those of us who have worked so
hard to keep that name alive, and I believe it's a serious
misrepresentation.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Dave thinks his brother deserves to use the Blasters name
is between them, but Blasters fans can rest assured that the Blasters
legacy is well taken care of every time we hit the stage.</TE>
<TE>   With all due, and well-deserved, respect for Dave, Bill and Gene
Taylor, the Blasters today are as strong as they ever were, which is
to say the equal of any band in the world. The Blasters don't need
redemption. Long live the Blasters.</TE>

<TE>   Critiques of the Critics</TE>
<TE>   Is the role of a theater reviewer to write of his or her own
opinions or claim to speak for all theatergoers? Daryl H. Miller, in
reviewing A Noise Within's production of "Love's Labour's Lost"
("Shakespeare's 'Labour's' Lost," March 13), seems to think it is the
latter. He states that the play is "a bit of a slog" and seems to
find the work unsavable by even the best actors. Miller claims, "The
audience gets too little return on its considerable investment of
brain cells," and "Today's theatergoers are baffled by its elaborate
wordplay."</TE>
<TE>   Miller does not speak for me nor any other audience member. If he
doesn't like "Love's Labour's Lost" and finds it overtaxes his brain
cells, perhaps The Times should send a different reviewer.</TE>
<TE>   I was fortunate to be in the audience for last Saturday's matinee
and found it to be absolutely delightful. I wasn't baffled. My brain
wasn't tired. I came away refreshed and grateful that A Noise Within
has brought Shakespeare alive to feed minds and souls once again.</TE>
<TE>   PAULA VAN HOUTEN</TE>
<TE>   Glendale</TE>
<TE>   Lesson one of the theater: You will get negative reviews, and you
will sometimes disagree with them. Complaining about them in public
is not done by grown-ups; it is what separates the men from the boys.
Perhaps when Jerry Patch of South Coast Rep says in his Counterpunch
article ("Did 'Lobby Hero' Critic Have an Agenda?," March 4) that his
complaint about Jan Breslauer's review of "Lobby Hero" "is not about
a negative review," he is being sincere. Then again, perhaps he is
not. (Had the notice in question been a rave, there would be no
complaint!)</TE>
<TE>   While Patch never really clarifies his main point, he is quite
wrong--and worryingly drifting into theatrical political
correctness--with the notion that the critic must respect the talents
of the artists. Why? The critic is there to help raise the standards
of artistic excellence, a subjective determination arrived at through
a wide range of experience and education.</TE>
<TE>   Patch makes the wacky claim that Breslauer should have written a
good review because this kind of negative review does the theater no
good. The truth is precisely the opposite. One of the key ingredients
contributing to higher artistic standards in any community is tough
critics. Without them, theaters get lazy, and the public, trained on
this awful diet, mistakes mediocrity for excellence.</TE>

<TE>   Finding 'Once and Again'</TE>
<TE>   I enjoyed Brian Lowry's article about the fate of "Once and Again"
("A Reality Check for Lovesick Fans," March 13). Although hardly a
fanatic, I have always enjoyed the show and would definitely be among
the 6.3 million viewers whenever possible if I could just find it. No
wonder the numbers aren't higher. ABC keeps changing its time slot,
pulling it off and putting it on, and I found it again only by
accident two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   A show has a better shot at gaining, or at least keeping, an
audience if it remains in its original time slot throughout the
season. Perhaps that is the chief complaint of some of the show's
devotees--in which case, I join in the criticism.</TE>
<TE>   KELLY HOLLIS</TE>
<TE>   Valley Glen</TE>
<TE>   It astounds me that the ABC station serving Roanoke-Lynchburg, Va.
pulled "Once and Again" fearing the kiss between two teenage girls
("'Once and Again' Pulled Over Kiss," March 13). While the kiss did
happen, in all of its teenage innocence, the sexual tension building
between Grace Manning (Julia Whelan) and her teacher (Eric Stoltz) is
far more disturbing. So disturbing that I thought after watching the
episode, "That's what the prescreening adult content warning was
about." But alas, I guess homosexuality is a far greater crime than
the possibility of statutory rape!</TE>

<TE>   Fighting Words</TE>
<TE>   I cannot stress enough how strongly I feel about Fox TV's choice
to program celebrity boxing last Wednesday night. It is an utterly
vile, irresponsible and disgusting idea, and the programming
"geniuses" behind this should be jailed.</TE>
<TE>   I would also like to direct my ire toward the participants who put
themselves on display in this fashion. They are morally bankrupt, and
I find their acceptance of the Fox offer to be utterly despicable. No
amount of money should be able to sway people into fighting each
other on TV. Boxing is just a primitive display of animalism and
should have no place in any civilized society.</TE>
<TE>   I am ashamed to be a member of the human race. We need to take a
good look at ourselves if we find something "entertaining" about
people beating up on each other.</TE>

<HD>Ballad of a Very Unlikely Pop Star</HD>
<DH>Josh Groban's polished singing isn't made for radio, but
after some high-profile gigs, that's where he may be headed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Try as you might, you'd have trouble dreaming up a singer less likely
to become a pop star these days than Josh Groban, even if he does
have a 14-time Grammy-winning producer, composer and arranger in his
corner.</LD>
<LD>   This 20-year-old Angeleno is a throwback to an era of polished pop
singing. Groban is light-years removed from the hip-hop, hard rock
and teen-pop sounds dominating the sales charts. Yet his self-titled
debut album has sold more than 300,000 copies since its release in
November, and last week it shot from No. 100 to No. 50 on the sales
chart.</LD>
<LD>   "This album was never designed to get radio play," says the
record's producer, David Foster, whose Grammys have come for his work
with Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Barbra Streisand and Chicago,
among others. "But sometimes you can transcend all the problems, the
naysayers and all the things that shouldn't happen."</LD>
<TE>   Foster is right. Radio airplay--something considered indispensable
for breaking new artists--has been nominal so far.</TE>
<TE>   So how has this kid with a dark, rich voice managed to defy
conventional wisdom? You might say he's done it by becoming a charity
case.</TE>
<TE>   "I started hitting the nonprofit circuit with David," Groban
explains, referring to the charity events that Foster regularly
produces. Though they didn't pad his bank account, those appearances
put Groban in front of all the right PWMs--People Who Matter, from
television producers to celebrities to record executives.</TE>
<TE>   That exposure has led to a string of increasingly high-profile
television appearances and a burgeoning fan base keyed to his Web
site, www.joshgroban.com.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years ago, when I did the 'Unforgettable' song with Natalie
and Nat King Cole, the last thing on my mind was radio," Foster says.
"Who knew? I did it because I loved it, and I did this album because
I loved it.</TE>
<TE>   "A little part of me hoped it would transcend [a cult following],
but the big part of me said, 'I'm doing art now, and that's just the
way it's going to be.' But when you get both, it sure is nice."</TE>
<TE>   Groban came to Foster's attention three years ago, as a
last-minute replacement for Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, whose
delayed flight to L.A. kept him from a rehearsal for a Grammy Awards
performance. Foster sought recommendations from celebrated vocal
coach Seth Riggs, with whom Groban was studying at the time. Foster
flipped when he heard a tape of Groban's voice and invited him to the
rehearsal, where the teenager found himself harmonizing with Celine
Dion on Foster's song "The Prayer."</TE>
<TE>   Among those who heard Groban sing at the Foster-organized
inaugural for California Gov. Gray Davis in 1999 was television
producer David E. Kelley, who arranged two appearances on his show
"Ally McBeal."</TE>
<TE>   Groban also has found admirers in Rosie O'Donnell, who is having
him back on her show on April 16, as well as at "Larry King Live,"
"The Today Show" and "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno." He'll be
profiled on an upcoming edition of "20/20."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and then there was Groban's performance last month at the
closing ceremonies for the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, where
this boyish-looking man with tousled curls that match his dark brown
eyes sang before a worldwide audience of more than 1 billion people.</TE>
<TE>   How many more?</TE>
<TE>   "After a billion you kind of lose count," Groban says with an easy
smile as he sits in the living room of the Hancock Park house where
he's lived with his family since he was 3.</TE>
<TE>   Groban's mother, Wendy, says she and her husband, Jack, were
convinced of Josh's musical talent from the time he was very young,
but he didn't start to study singing seriously until his teens. Then,
while attending the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts, he
focused on musical theater because he realized that his voice wasn't
cut out for rock 'n' roll.</TE>
<TE>   After signing Groban to his Warner Bros.-affiliated 143 Records
label, Foster encouraged him to move from theatrical singing toward
pop. He also felt Groban's voice was ideally suited to Italian, which
led to the five numbers he sings in that language. It wasn't, Foster
says, an attempt to cast Groban as an American Bocelli, who prefers
opera over pop.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not touching classical music yet," Groban says. "I have too
much respect, and I know how sacred these songs are to people for me
to come out at my age and say, 'Here I am' [and then sing] 'Nessun
Dorma.' I look at [my album] as a pop CD with classical influences."</TE>
<TE>   As Foster sees it, Groban could fill the current void in pop male
ballad singers.</TE>
<TE>   "Where is today's Michael Bolton, or Bryan Adams, or Teddy
Pendergrass?" he says. "There are a lot of women doing that kind of
singing, but not a lot of guys."</TE>
<TE>   Now radio airplay is one of many things that might have seemed
unimaginable just a few months ago but now appears within the realm
of possibility.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since the [Olympic] closing ceremonies, there's been such a
great reaction from younger audiences that I feel I have a shot--a
hard shot, but a good shot--at radio," Groban says. "Some Top 40
stations are actually starting to play it, along with some modern
adult-contemporary and some oldies stations."</TE>
<TE>   "He's different," Foster says. "When you read the fan mail, you
see that people really love him and his music, and that they find it
refreshing. That's why there's 31 flavors at Baskin-Robbins."</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Successfully Raids the Vaults</HD>
<DH>Movies* Two DVD sets showcase archival footage and brim
with outtakes, behind-the-scenes footage and screen tests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DONALD LIEBENSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Film buffs who love the supplemental features on DVDs will treasure
four documentaries just released on disc by Image Entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   "Hidden Hollywood: Treasures From the 20th Century Fox Vaults" and
"Hollywood Screen Tests," each in two volumes, contain the type of
archival materials that have become staples of DVD releases: deleted
scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, outtakes and screen tests.</LD>
<LD>   Originally shown on cable's American Movie Classics, "Hidden
Hollywood" and "Hollywood Screen Tests" are the happy results of
archivists' efforts to find the best existing film and sound elements
for use in restoring and preserving classic movies, which have become
viable properties again, thanks to cable and home video.</LD>
<TE>   The first installment of "Hidden Hollywood," hosted by Joan
Collins, gathers "priceless gems" that ended up on the cutting-room
floor as well as rare and unusual footage, such as a vintage Fox
promotional reel previewing the studio's then-upcoming releases
(Joanne Woodward and Lee J. Cobb, for example, are visited on the set
of "The Three Faces of Eve").</TE>
<TE>   This 90-minute program boasts among its excavated treasures
Katharine Hepburn's first appearance on film, a 1932 screen test in
which she performs a scene from James Barrie's "The Animal Kingdom."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the running time is given to deleted musical numbers, some
of which had not been seen in more than 60 years. Shirley Temple
imitates Jimmy Durante in "Hop, Skip and Jump," a song excised from
"Little Miss Broadway" because studio head Darryl F. Zanuck thought
the sequence made the child star seem "more cheeky than cute."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the unkindest cuts of all are two dance sequences from the
extravaganza "Cafe Metropole." Legendary tap dancer Bill "Bojangles"
Robinson had been afforded the rare opportunity to portray himself
and appear as the sophisticated showman he had been on the stage.
Zanuck is said to have bowed to pressure from nervous theater owners
and cut Robinson from the film.</TE>
<TE>   Also included are Ethel Merman and Dan Daily's performance of
"Anything You Can Do, I Can Do Better," which was deleted from
"There's No Business Like Show Business"; Bert Lahr's baffling "The
Woof Song," understandably cut from "Love and Hisses"; and Al
Jolson's medley trimmed from "The Rose of Washington Square."</TE>
<TE>   "Hidden Hollywood II" unearths from the Fox vaults more musical
and comedy sequences long thought to have been lost. The real find is
W.C. Fields' contribution to the anthology film, "Tales of
Manhattan," as well as a darkly comic sequence deleted from "We're
Not Married!" in which Walter Brennan portrays a backwoods scoundrel
taking advantage of his married lover.</TE>
<TE>   Also included are rare outtakes of a smiling Buster Keaton
rehearsing a pie-throwing routine with Alice Faye for the film
"Hollywood Cavalcade" and Betty Grable's rendition of "Daddy,"
removed from "I Wake Up Screaming," originally titled "Hot Spot." Tex
Avery fans will recognize this song as the incendiary number "Red Hot
Riding Hood" performs to the infatuated Wolf.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood Screen Tests: Take 1," narrated by Robert Culp, offers
a nostalgic "before they were stars" look at budding stars trying to
make the most of their "first chance of a lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   Watching "Hollywood Screen Tests" is akin to paging through an old
high school yearbook, trying to pick out those most likely to
succeed. Would you have recognized the star quality in 19-year-old
Mia Farrow, then being considered for Liesel in "The Sound of Music,"
22-year-old Raquel Welch, seen turning the heat on James Coburn for a
shot at "Our Man Flint," or 28-year-old Sean Connery, testing with
Ingrid Bergman for "The Inn of the Sixth Happiness"?</TE>
<TE>   Also intriguing are 1961 and 1966 "personality tests" of,
respectively, a vivacious Ann-Margret, then being considered for the
remake of "State Fair," and Dustin Hoffman, in which the future
"Graduate" recites highlights from his resume.</TE>
<TE>   Intriguing dueling screen tests compare Adam West and Lyle
Waggoner, both vying for the coveted role of Batman in a proposed TV
series. Also from the "road not traveled" file are screen tests for
the remake of "State Fair" with Andy Williams and Barbara Eden and
Rich Little's test for the role that eventually went to Robert Morse
in "A Guide for the Married Man."</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood Screen Tests: Take 2" does not lack for star power
(Coburn, Bruce Lee, Martin Landau, Walter Matthau, Leslie Nielsen),
but its roster of "the newest sensations" is a poignant reminder of
the thousands whose Hollywood dreams were unfulfilled. Donna
Michelle, a 1964 Playboy Playmate of the Year, displays disarming
(and disrobing) comic timing in a scene with Adam West.</TE>
<TE>   Model Suzy Parker's test for the film "Kiss Them for Me" is
historic as being the only known screen test of her legendary costar,
Cary Grant.</TE>
<TE>   Also benefiting from their screen test partners are Carol Ann
Seflinger, cast as Rita Hayworth's daughter in "The Story on Page
One," and Kim Atwood, who improvises with Elliot Gould for Robert
Altman's "MASH."</TE>
<TE>   Each installment of "Hidden Hollywood: Treasures From the 20th
Century Fox Vaults" and "Hollywood Screen Tests" retails for $25. To
order, call (800) 624-3078.</TE>

<HD>A New Smile, but the Same Charm, From 'E.T.'</HD>
<DH>Movies* Steven Spielberg's 1982 classic is being
re-released with digital upgrades and new scenes, so what seemed cool
20 years ago doesn't appear clunky today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL MALLORY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When E.T. finally comes home to movie theaters next week, moviegoers
will encounter a more active, more expressive and far more limber
little alien than they first saw 20 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Spielberg's "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" is perhaps the
most notable of the modern classics to be made during the
transitional period of the mid-1970s and '80s, when special effects
were still pupating in a pre-digital cocoon. Now it joins the likes
of "Star Wars" and "The Exorcist" in receiving a digital face-lift
for contemporary audiences.</LD>
<LD>   Considering that the film is the fourth-highest-grossing picture
in history, having taken in $400 million domestically in its initial
release, it would be reasonable to question why something so unbroken
needed to be fixed. But producer Kathleen Kennedy says updating the
effects was not the initial concern.</LD>
<TE>   "It was really an evolutionary process," she says. "Once the
decision was made [to re-release the film], the thought came up that
we could put some scenes back in, which is a fairly typical
discussion when you're talking about a reissue. There was a scene in
the bathroom that we loved [but that was cut because it didn't quite
work], and this was an opportunity to actually do it the way Steven
had originally intended it to be done, and that led to discussions of
how other shots could be enhanced."</TE>
<TE>   Although they were state-of-the-art at the time, there is no
question that some of the film's original effects have simply aged
less than gracefully over 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "What worked in 1982 doesn't quite hold up," says Industrial Light
&amp; Magic's Bill George, who supervised the visual effects for more
than 140 shots that were reworked for the re-release. "We remember it
a certain way, but when I went back and looked at the film, I was a
bit shocked at how some of the stuff looked."</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for George (whose first assignment for Industrial
Light &amp; Magic was working on the spaceship for "E.T.'s" initial
release) was to live up to everyone's memory of the film while
satisfying today's more effects-savvy moviegoers.</TE>
<TE>   Even more daunting was that to produce the highest-quality image,
the original negative had to be obtained from Universal and scanned
into a computer. "There was a tremendous amount of trust coming from
the studio, and also of us convincing them that we'd be very careful
with it, in order to get that original negative to scan in," George
says.</TE>
<TE>   Work on the project began in summer 2000. Because the re-release
had not been announced by Universal, the project was kept quiet, even
at the effects house, where the film was referred to by its original
working title, "A Boy's Life."</TE>
<TE>   Original director of photography Allen Daviau was consulted on the
project, although Spielberg was the key force driving the new work.
"[Spielberg] went through the film and pointed out shots that he
wasn't happy with or wanted to change," George says. "As we worked on
it, other shots [that needed work] became clear."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the new effects are simply enhancements of the background
plates through the addition of smoke, cloud or elements such as
moving grass. Smoke was also added to the effects shots, which in the
original were so free of atmosphere, George says, that they stood out
from the rest of the film.</TE>
<TE>   Other shots, such as the one in which E.T. causes the bicycle
belonging to Elliot (the lead youngster, played by Henry Thomas) to
fly, had been filmed on miniature sets with a motion-control camera,
which precluded any kind of movement in the trees. George's team
added gently wafting branches, swirling mist and a shower of rocks
tumbling down the face of the cliff as the bicycle goes over the
edge.</TE>
<TE>   The most noticeable work was done on E.T. himself. Originally the
character was brought to life through a combination of sophisticated
hydraulically controlled puppets created by Italian effects master
Carlo Rambaldi (who shared that year's special-effects Oscar with
Industrial Light &amp; Magic's Dennis Muren and Kenneth F. Smith), a crew
of very small actors who donned body suits for long shots and the
expressive hands of a mime named Caprice Rothe, who performed the
character's close-up hand action in an arm-length glove.</TE>
<TE>   The hydraulic E.T., no matter how advanced it was for the time,
still suffered from what Kennedy calls "bad days," when the proper
performance could not be pulled out of it. That was why the bathroom
scene, in which E.T. playfully submerges himself into the filled tub
at Elliot's house, had to be cut out of the original release.</TE>
<TE>   There were other days when the problems were smaller but telling.
"When we looked at the movie again after so many years, Steven and I
were laughing because we could remember, 'Oh, yeah, that's where his
lips got caught and we had to accept a funky smile,'" Kennedy says.
"Now we can go in and adjust the area where his lip got caught."</TE>
<TE>   For each new shot, the Industrial Light &amp; Magic team would
digitally replace only as much of E.T. as was necessary for the
performance. Sometimes it was only the face, sometimes the head and
neck, occasionally it was the entire creature.</TE>
<TE>   George says that care was taken not to over-animate. "We spent a
lot of time studying the character," he says. "He is so charming and
had such a quality about him that we wanted to match, but at the same
time, because of the limitations of the puppet, we wanted to do
things it couldn't do. We wanted it to be different, but not too
different, and that's sometimes a hard line to follow."</TE>
<TE>   The most dramatic change in the new version, in George's view, is
the scene in which the spaceship leaves E.T. behind. The 1982 version
contained a static shot of the character wistfully looking toward the
heavens, which bothered George. "Why would he stop?" he asks. "He
should be continuing to run after the ship." The new sequence shows
E.T. nimbly running after the rising ship, stopping only when he
realizes it is hopeless, then sadly dropping his head.</TE>
<TE>   What really made the effects supervisor stop and think was the
decision to redo the film's signature shot, the image that became the
corporate logo for Spielberg's pre-DreamWorks company, Amblin
Entertainment: the boy on the bicycle flying across the full moon.</TE>
<TE>   Never in any previous digital spruce-ups had a shot so closely
identified with a movie been completely redone. (When "The Exorcist"
was being readied for a 2000 re-release, director William Friedkin
reportedly refused to let effects artists digitally remove the
visible piano wires that floated Linda Blair to the bedroom
ceiling--he did not want the shot touched.)</TE>
<TE>   "It was the kind of shot that caused me to pause and go, 'My gosh,
what am I working on here?'" George admits.</TE>
<TE>   The original shot was done with a mechanical puppet on a miniature
bicycle. Although the model was engineered to move realistically, its
molded clothing was immobile. For the redo, a real boy who looked
like an 8-year-old Henry Thomas was filmed seated on a bike, which
was attached to a pivoting platform on a blue-screen stage.</TE>
<TE>   With a fan providing wind resistance, the boy duplicated the
movements in the original. Those images were digitally assembled over
the original background plates, and the scene was duplicated exactly,
except that now, Elliot's Halloween cape billows in silhouette as he
rides in front of the moon.</TE>
<TE>   The reissue also provided the opportunity to change something that
had always bothered Spielberg: the depiction of policemen chasing the
kids with their guns drawn. "That was something that Steven regretted
the moment he looked at the movie," Kennedy says, "so that seemed to
be a really obvious change." The guns were removed by digital artists
and replaced with walkie-talkies.</TE>
<TE>   Both Kennedy and George hope today's audiences will not play "spot
the fix," and simply accept and enjoy the new effects as an intrinsic
part of the film, as invisible as the digital remastering of the
soundtrack (though for the film's Los Angeles premiere today, a
benefit at the Shrine Auditorium, the music track will be provided
live by John Williams and a 100-piece orchestra, and mixed on the
spot). The film opens in general release on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   However, those who prefer the original--guns, stiff clothes, funky
smiles and all--can take comfort in the fact that the original
version of "E.T." will still be available even after the new version
comes out.</TE>
<TE>   "We're protecting the purists," Kennedy says.</TE>

<LD>   Ethiopians Unhappy With Film Portrayal</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Ethiopian officials have complained that "Beyond Borders," a movie
starring Angelina Jolie being filmed in Namibia, gives a biased
portrayal of their country. The film focuses on the 1984 drought and
ensuing starvation rather than the progress that has been made since
then, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "The portrayal of happenings of 1984 in the film does not reflect
the true image of Ethiopia today," said Tegenaw Goshu, spokesman of
the Ethiopian Embassy in South Africa, claiming that producers were
unwilling to work with organizations in his country to give the
needed context. "The portrayal of negative images about Ethiopia does
not help the whole of Africa. The media should strive to include [a]
positive image of our continent."</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Jolie falls in love with a doctor who travels to
Cambodia, Chechnya and Ethiopia to help war victims.</TE>
<TE>   The actress, who serves as a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, said that she had been wanting to shoot
the film for three years, and that the script was one of the best
she's encountered.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nash Denies Rumors About His Past</TE>
<TE>   John Nash, the schizophrenic math whiz whose life is portrayed by
Russell Crowe in the Oscar-nominated movie "A Beautiful Mind," says
allegations that he is homosexual and anti-Semitic are untrue.
Critics have charged that these and other aspects of his life were
left out of the movie--including rumors that he had an affair and was
lacking as a father.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with CBS' "60 Minutes," airing Sunday, Nash denies
any bias against Jews but admits he may have said things while
delusional that could convey that impression.</TE>
<TE>   "I did have strange ideas during certain periods of time," he
said, adding that he heard voices then. Nash, 73, and his wife,
Alicia Nash, also denied that he is gay. "That's just not true,"
Alicia Nash said. "I should know."</TE>
<TE>   The mathematician said that he's now close to his son John Stiers,
his child by a previous relationship, and gave him some royalties
from the movie.</TE>

<TE>   SAG Bears Down</TE>
<TE>   on Nonunion Shops</TE>
<TE>   The Screen Actors Guild has instructed members of its San Diego
branch not to sign nonunion contracts for Russell Crowe's "Master and
Commander," Variety reports.</TE>
<TE>   The seafaring drama, adapted by Peter Weir from a Patrick O'Brian
book series, is due to begin filming in Baja California this summer.
The union has a May 1 deadline for "Global Rule One," which changes
its enforcement of work rules to include disciplining members who
work nonunion outside the United States. The movie represents an
effort to stem migration of film and TV productions to offshore
locations.</TE>
<TE>   SAG spokesman Ilyanne Kichaven said that the union had contacted
Twentieth Century Fox, which developed the film, and Miramax Films,
which--with Universal Pictures--is investing in it. The union plans
to contact Crowe after the Academy Awards ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Tenenbaums' Tops Movie-Trailer Awards</TE>
<TE>   "The Royal Tenenbaums" was the big winner at the third annual
Golden Trailer Awards, held at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on
Thursday night, winning the prize for best comedy, best music and
best of show. The awards honor movie trailers on artistic merit.</TE>
<TE>   Other winners in the competition, selected by a panel of industry
judges that included actor Ben Stiller, director Brett Ratner and
producer Kathleen Kennedy: "Memento" (best drama, most original),
"Monsters, Inc." (best animation/family) and "Amelie" (best foreign).
And the trashiest? "Series 7--Redband," which was also voted best
independent.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   The High Cost of Warhol Viewing</TE>
<TE>   The Museum of Contemporary Art is revving up for what it hails as
"the first comprehensive exhibition of the work of Andy Warhol to be
presented in Los Angeles in 30 years." And, for the first time in its
21-year history, it's charging a special ticketed price above its
usual admission fee for the right to take a peek.</TE>
<TE>   Adults wanting to see the show at MOCA--the only North American
venue in which it's being presented--will have to fork out $12 on
weekdays and $17 on the weekend. For children, the fee is $6 and $8.
On top of that, there's a $5 charge for the audio tour--and $10 for
valet parking.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition, which features 150 works by the artist, runs May
25 through Aug. 18.</TE>
<TE>   The top price is not an all-time high among Los Angeles museums.
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art charged adults $17.50 on
weekdays and $20 on weekends to get into its Van Gogh masterpieces
show. For its Winslow Homer and Picasso exhibits, however, the top
price was $15 on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at the incredible response to the Warhol show in London
and Berlin, and realized we'd have to issue special tickets as a way
of controlling the numbers," said Katherine Lee, MOCA's acting
director of communications. "And given inflation--and the price of
other entertainment options--these prices are pretty reasonable.
Still, we realize that $50 for a family of four can be a challenge
for some. That's an incentive to buy a $60 annual membership to the
museum, which gives you two free Warhol tickets."</TE>

<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   Playhouse Troupe</TE>
<TE>   Is Moving Up</TE>
<TE>   The resident company at the Pasadena Playhouse will take over the
building's upstairs Balcony Theatre in June, following an independent
production of "Late Nite Catechism," which is scheduled to open on
April 4 in the 120-seat space.</TE>
<TE>   The theater company had been seeking a larger second space in Old
Pasadena but can't afford it, according to executive director Lyla
White. The upstairs space, to be leased from the complex's new owner,
Greg Varon, will be used for readings, workshops, classes and
cabaret.</TE>

<HD>For Parties, There's Tomorrow</HD>
<DH>Highlights are intermittent during the kickoff of the
four-day event at UCLA, featuring musicians and spoken-word artists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What if Sonic Youth gave a party and nobody came? UCLA's Royce Hall
was about a third full on Thursday for the first show of All
Tomorrow's Parties, an eclectic, four-day music festival curated by
the New York art-rock band. Though the rest of the weekend promised
bigger draws, from Eddie Vedder to Sonic Youth itself, ATP opened
with an often tedious five-hour show featuring spoken-word artists
and free-jazz luminary Cecil Taylor.</LD>
<LD>   Highlighted by veteran underground poet Lydia Lunch's political
anger and radical icon John Sinclair's jazz love letters, the program
of mostly short sets was thematically consistent with the festival's
purpose, delivering a wide range of respected, obscure-to-renowned
artists. Most were somehow connected to a musical style or scene, and
all were worth learning more about, even if their presentations
didn't necessarily convey that.</LD>
<LD>   Food for thought? The black-clad Lunch offered a feast of
righteous vitriol, starting with a diatribe against the war on
terrorism and blazing ever more furiously. She charged purposefully
through a dizzying number of related points about American hypocrisy,
religion, freedom, prison and the greed of politicians.</LD>
<TE>   For her efforts she earned props from Sinclair, the '60s-era White
Panther Party leader, who dedicated his "Full Circle" to Lunch and
noted its relevance in light of "recent U.S. activities." He brought
along trumpeter Charles Moore and reed player Ralph Jones to enhance
his kinetic recitation style, and, along with such other political
bits as the atomic-bomb-referencing "Fat Boy," offered paeans to John
Coltrane and Taylor that reflected his lifelong love and
understanding of jazz.</TE>
<TE>   And you might have needed a PhD's worth of musical insights to get
Taylor, a veteran maverick who spent more than an hour blending
rhythmic poetry interludes with dynamic, percussive piano
improvisation that bubbled from sweet, almost conventional melodies
into frenetic, throbbing treatises on worlds both microscopic and
cosmic.</TE>
<TE>   At least you wanted to figure out what Taylor was up to, which
wasn't the case with the droning, wrist-slittingly dull turn by lo-fi
singer-songwriter-guitarist Smog (a.k.a. Bill Callahan).</TE>
<TE>   The cavernous hall tended to swallow the less dynamic performers.
Poet Nathaniel Mackey might have been more compelling in a smaller
space, as his works inspired by Taylor and other jazzmen intriguingly
intertwined verbal interpretations of the music with thoughts on
language and black travails through history. Likewise,
Warhol-associated poet Gerard Malanga's reading dragged, although his
ruminations on William Burroughs' end days and a poignant piece
titled "Leaving New York" were affectingly reflective.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran photographer, poet and wanderer Ira Cohen, associated with
the Beat poets but not one of them, was more theatrical, flashing
often fascinatingly surreal images of various far-off lands. Wisely
providing background on some of his inspirations, he also fulfilled
another of the festival's objectives: giving those not in the know
some tidbits for further exploration.</TE>

<HD>Understated 'Snow White' Is a Fair Treat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes it pays to play it straight.</LD>
<LD>   Since its first full-length animated feature in 1937, "Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs," Disney has freely adapted fairy tales with
magical results, but Sunday's "Wonderful World of Disney"
presentation, a live-action "Snow White: The Fairest of Them All" (7
p.m., ABC), works without straying far from the Brothers Grimm story
or adding musical interludes.</LD>
<LD>   As the evil stepmother, Miranda Richardson is no cackling villain
in the Cruella DeVil mode. With understated devilishness and frailty,
she personifies the perils of vanity and jealousy at the heart of
this morality tale. Richardson shows us a little of ourselves each
time she demands, "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of
them all?" And she sends shivers by whispering of her stepdaughter,
"Never mind her. She wouldn't know pleasure if it pinched her."</LD>
<TE>   Writer-director-producer Caroline Thompson has a visual flair that
serves the story without getting in the way.</TE>
<TE>   In this telling, Snow White (Kristin Kreuk) is born from a drop of
blood in a flutter of apple blossoms, a blessing for a peasant
couple. Her arrival also brings a curse that claims her mother, but
salvation comes suddenly when tears from her father (Tom Irwin) melt
the icy tomb of a devious creature, the Granter of Wishes (Clancy
Brown). Snow White's father gets nourishment for his starving baby, a
kingdom and a queen, but the creature also owes a debt to its vile
sister (Richardson): She gets an instant makeover, a king and, of
course, a stepdaughter to menace.</TE>
<TE>   Fans of the animated original may be hard-pressed to call this
"Snow White" the fairest of all, but as family entertainment, it's
more than fair.</TE>

<HD>An Actor Looks Back on a Confusing 'Time'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON WAXMAN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guy Pearce is struggling with the whole Hollywood thing.</LD>
<LD>   First noticed as a transvestite in the 1994 "The Adventures of
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," then cast in the Oscar-winning "L.A.
Confidential" and the critically lauded "Memento," Pearce is reeling
from his experiences in string of commercial studio movies.</LD>
<LD>   Here's what he's learned: Directors get replaced midstream.
Scripts get changed, radically, between takes. An actor may break a
rib and still be expected to carry on with action scenes. And the
movie you act in may not be the movie you finally see on-screen, a
week before opening.</LD>
<TE>   So it went with "The Time Machine," the $85-million science
fiction movie, which opened last week and is based on the novel by
H.G. Wells. Pearce plays Alexander Hartdegen, the scientist who
travels from the early 20th century to the year 802,701 and ends up
battling a mutant species that munches on Homo sapiens for their
survival.</TE>
<TE>   A monster-fighting action hero played by the same guy lauded in
Time magazine for giving "the best performance last year not to be
nominated for an Oscar"? (In "Memento." And more on that later.)</TE>
<TE>   "I had this dualistic approach," Pearce, 34, says of the "Time
Machine" script. "I thought, 'Oh, wow, that would be fun.' The other
side was saying, 'No, you don't make children's movies. Do important
things.' But I'm trying to loosen up, to broaden the spectrum." But
Pearce quickly learned some tough lessons, among them that, in the
pecking order of things, the lead actor doesn't necessarily come
first.</TE>
<TE>   "'The machine is the star of the movie.' That's what I was told,"
he says, laughing. "I said, 'Why doesn't the machine do all the
interviews?' I can laugh at it now."</TE>
<TE>   The experience was a bruising one, literally and figuratively.
Director Simon Wells was overwhelmed and unable to finish the film.
Key scenes hit the cutting-room floor; other sequences were added.
But mostly, he says, his difficulty with "The Time Machine" is "not
so much about what happened but about my not being satisfied with
what I offered up as a performance."</TE>
<TE>   The studio behind the film, DreamWorks, disagrees. "He's a very
self-critical, exacting actor. He takes his craft extremely
seriously," says Walter Parkes, a producer of "The Time Machine" and
head of the motion picture division of DreamWorks. It's no secret
that "The Time Machine" was plagued with difficulty. Wells,
great-grandson of H.G. Wells, was given the project as his first
live-action film; he previously directed the animated epic "Prince of
Egypt."</TE>
<TE>   Time Machine" proved overwhelming, according to Parkes and Pearce,
and the novice filmmaker had to be removed for exhaustion a few weeks
before the end of the shoot and replaced with Gore Verbinski ("Mouse
Hunt").</TE>
<TE>   There were some real surprises when Pearce saw the finished film
two weeks ago. The opening sequence--in which the dean of Columbia
University finds Hartdegen conducting experiments with his students
outdoors--was removed. At the end of the film, Pearce was surprised
to see his character holding hands with the female lead, Samantha
Mumba.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not my hand; it's not her hand," says Pearce, resigned. "It
wasn't how I saw the character."</TE>
<TE>   After three weeks on "Time Machine," Bird was replaced with the
director of "Home Alone 3," Raja Gosnell. Says Pearce, "I couldn't
quite understand the experience."</TE>
<TE>   After "The Time Machine," he withdrew for a while, hiding in a
bark hut on a beach in northwest Australia for a month. Crazy? "Not
as crazy as working in Hollywood," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Pearce gave one of last year's most arresting performances in
"Memento," a daring noir film with a tiny budget and no proper
distributor.</TE>
<TE>   The film, about a man who has lost his short-term memory and is
trying to solve the murder of his wife, is darkly comic and dramatic,
and both it and Pearce received rave notices. Many film lovers were
disappointed when he failed to win a best actor nomination last
month, especially given the mixed reviews for other nominees.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm coming to terms with the fact that if I want to do a
particular kind of film--expressing myself, indulging in a story
that's self-indulgent--there's every possibility no one will want to
see it," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, Pearce feels he must find a way to keep his balance
in the precarious movie world of commerce and art.</TE>
<TE>   "If I choose a studio-based film, there's a lot of money at
stake," he reflects. "The film will have a certain flavor. Either I
accept that or I don't." Pause. "'Rob Roy,' 'Braveheart,' movies that
have a sort of wink-wink at the camera, I'm able more and more to
accept that as valid entertainment. As long as I can balance the two,
I'll keep it interesting in my life."</TE>

<HD>Flogging Molly Leads a Rowdy Celebration</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With St. Patrick's Day just around the corner, Los Angeles septet
Flogging Molly started the revelry a little early at the Troubadour
on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   For its first night of a three-night stand at the club, the
punk-rock band that bleeds green played it fast and furious for a
sold-out crowd that lustily sang along with clenched fists held
aloft.</LD>
<LD>   Flogging Molly's rowdy party music celebrates its own Irish-ness,
but for leader Dave King, being Irish is not just a matter of ethnic
pride, it's a marketing hook--King didn't hesitate to plug more than
once during the set the brewery that's sponsoring the band's tour.</LD>
<TE>   Like gangsta rappers who peddle a cartoon version of urban
oppression, Flogging Molly plays up the profane, hard-drinking
hooligan stereotype.</TE>
<TE>   Flogging Molly's sound, which lashed the melodic lilt of
traditional Irish dance music to punk velocity and attitude,
features, in addition to the usual electric guitar and bass, a
full-time mandolin player, an accordionist and a fiddler who doubles
on penny whistle.</TE>
<TE>   The material is relentlessly zippy, with virtually every tune
powered by a jackhammer drum beat.</TE>
<TE>   The band used these tools to stir up a ruckus in a hurry, but its
sound was gratingly monochromatic.</TE>

<HD>Consumers to See Higher Travel Costs</HD>
<DH>Airlines: End to commissions means agents will boost fees,
but online bookings may curb ticket prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ and BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumers and companies braced for higher travel costs Friday amid
forecasts that other carriers will follow Delta Air Lines Inc. and
stop paying commissions to travel agents. But some analysts said
consumers would benefit from the change.</LD>
<LD>   The end of commissions means many travel agents will levy higher
fees for booking consumers' airline reservations, raising travelers'
costs, industry officials and travel lobby groups said. Most agents
already charge fees because the airlines had been slashing
commissions for the last several years.</LD>
<LD>   With most carriers expected to match Delta and eliminate base
commissions in coming weeks, travelers face "a price increase brought
on by the airlines," said Thom Nulty, president of Navigant
International, a major travel services concern.</LD>
<TE>   In turn, that will drive more travelers to the Internet, where the
airlines and third-party firms such as Travelocity.com Inc., Expedia
Inc. and Hotwire are battling for reservations. That's one of the
airlines' goals because it's cheaper for them to distribute tickets
via the Web than through travel agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Ending basic commissions could save the U.S. airline industry
about $1 billion a year, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Brian Harris
said in a bulletin Friday. And the growing use of Internet bookings
helps keep downward pressure on airline ticket prices, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "It will accelerate the online penetration" of the travel
business, said Karl Peterson, chief executive of Hotwire, whose
founders include six major airlines. The Internet's share of the
airline reservations market is "in the low teens," but that will grow
sharply, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Travel agencies, which still handle the bulk of airline tickets,
put a brave face on the prospective loss of commissions.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to refocus our efforts, because travel is not the same
anymore," said Sally Feldman, who runs Fly Away Travel Agency in
Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Shadrick, president of TraveLeaders in Irvine, said agents
no longer have to fret about when the airlines will next cut their
commissions. "There's nothing to take away from us now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Mark Ray, a managing director for John Hancock Financial
Services in Boston, said the change "will be a net benefit for
consumers" because they'll be able to choose between using a travel
agent--and paying a fee for help--or trying to get a cheaper seat
themselves by using the Internet. He likened it to the banking
industry, in which consumers can get free checking accounts if they
always use automated teller machines, or pay a fee to get help from a
bank employee.</TE>
<TE>   Investors, however, didn't signal that they expect big gains for
Internet travel firms, and share prices of the publicly traded firms
finished mixed Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses already were using more online booking and other
lower-cost services provided by travel agencies to weather the
recession "and we expect that activity to accelerate" if the airlines
scrap the agents' commissions, said Melissa Abernathy, a spokeswoman
for American Express Co., a corporate travel manager.</TE>
<TE>   Nulty said Navigant--which handles about $6 billion of clients'
travel arrangements annually--and many others like it charge a set
fee for their services. But they also give the airlines' commissions
back to clients, helping customers offset part of their travel costs.</TE>
<TE>   Now, corporations won't get that savings because the airlines
won't be paying commissions, Nulty said. "I'm hearing concern from
customers because the airlines are imposing a price increase on them
and they don't like it," he said. "Even though it's only $20 per
ticket or whatever, it's $20 more than they would like to spend."</TE>
<TE>   Some agencies said they expect corporate customers will demand
renegotiated contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd even expect some companies to start trying to book their own
trips, either by phone or over the Internet, just to avoid the larger
fees," said Wido Schaefer, president of the 11-office TravelStore
agency in Southern California.</TE>

<HD>Andersen in Merger Talks With KPMG</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH and JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Andersen accounting firm worked Friday to sell all or part of the
company to rival KPMG, while trying to dissuade its foreign
affiliates from striking independent deals after the firm's
indictment on obstruction-of-justice charges a day earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Also Friday, the federal General Services Administration suspended
Andersen, which handles more than $60 million in government
contracts, from receiving new contracts from federal agencies as long
as it is under indictment.</LD>
<LD>   After seeing potential deals with two other rivals falter this
week, Andersen stepped up negotiations with KPMG, the lone Big Five
accounting firm still willing to explore a business combination,
according to people familiar with the matter.</LD>
<TE>   They said the merger talks center on how to structure a deal that
would allow KPMG to buy Andersen's foreign affiliates and other
portions of the company that might not carry liability from its audit
of Enron Corp. Already, Andersen partner firms in Spain, Chile and
Canada have talked about arranging separate mergers.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG would acquire the U.S. operations of Andersen at a later
date, once its Enron liabilities were determined, sources familiar
with the talks said.</TE>
<TE>   A decision on whether to move forward with the merger is expected
to come as early as today, one source said.</TE>
<TE>   However, others familiar with the talks cautioned that the deal
could fracture, just as negotiations with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu
and Ernst &amp; Young broke up earlier this week over the liability
issue.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Justice Department unsealed an indictment that
accused Andersen and its senior managers of shredding and destroying
thousands of Enron- related files and e-mails after learning that the
Securities and Exchange Commission was examining Enron's accounting.</TE>
<TE>   The company has admitted that its employees destroyed the
documents but has said the criminal charges are unwarranted and vowed
to fight them.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting industry experts likened the criminal indictment to a
death sentence for Andersen, but sources close to the company
indicated that executives were determined to find a way forward.</TE>
<TE>   If the KPMG talks collapse, one source said, another option for
Andersen would be to restructure the company as a much smaller
business--akin to the second tier of accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   Such a reorganization may require putting the firm through
bankruptcy proceedings in hopes of shielding the new company from
existing liabilities, said Arthur Bowman, publisher of Bowman's
Accounting Report.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Dorton, an Andersen spokesman, said the firm "is looking
at many options" but declined to elaborate. KPMG also declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is seeing a daily erosion of major clients. On Friday,
Sara Lee Corp., Brunswick Corp., and Northeast Utilities joined the
list of about 50 companies that have dismissed Andersen since
December.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has lost about 50 of its 2,300 public company audit
clients in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   That represents about $200 million in business since December,
according to a Times review of accounting firm fees listed in
Securities and Exchange Commission filings.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen collected $4.3 billion in U.S. revenue last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Although I say this with great pain, the Andersen name has become
radioactive," said Bill Cummings, an accounting professor at the
University of Northern Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Cummings said the rate of client losses will accelerate in the
next month, when most large companies select auditors for the coming
year.</TE>
<TE>   Executives fear that Andersen won't be able to complete their
audits and would be a liability with shareholders, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dorton said that the firm "remains committed to providing high
quality" for its clients and that it "continues to be hard at work"
on its many engagements.</TE>
<TE>   But the company's woes mounted Friday after the GSA concluded that
Andersen, along with Enron, did not meet federal ethics standards.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of suspension is not to punish a contractor or an
individual, but to protect the government from contractors that do
not have a satisfactory record of business ethics and integrity," the
GSA said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen will meet with the GSA on Monday to discuss the
suspension.</TE>
<TE>   "The quality of our government work is unaffected by the
indictment, or Enron, and if they have concerns that the issues
raised in the indictment might affect it, we will make whatever
changes to reassure GSA that there is integrity and oversight and all
the proper controls," said Ira Goldstein, Andersen's managing partner
for government services.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's government contracts include work for the Defense
Department, Justice Department, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, State Department and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services.</TE>
<TE>   The GSA issued a 12-month suspension against Enron, its major
subsidiaries and former leaders, including former Chairman Kenneth L.
Lay and former President Jeffrey K. Skilling.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's contracts with the government total about $35 million,
according to the GSA.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Securities and Exchange Commission officials planned to
meet over the week- end to detail emergency relief measures announced
Thursday for audit clients of Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   The full package of regulations is due to be filed Monday,
spokesman John Nester said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC will accept financial statements audited by Andersen but
will require companies to obtain assurances from the accounting firm
that it can perform the work properly.</TE>
<TE>   Companies that cannot obtain such assurances or that decide for
other reasons not to have Andersen complete the work would be allowed
to file unaudited financial reports, providing they obtain audited
statements within 60 days, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   For the bulk of corporate America that operates on a calendar
year, annual financial reports are due at the commission March 31.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the field work for those reports already has been done, so
experts doubt that many firms will file unaudited statements.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Says City Slowing Its Broadband Roll-Out</HD>
<DH>Internet: Company says reconstruction work for high-speed
services is being delayed by lack of electricity from DWP.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a boost from federal regulators, the largest cable operator
in Los Angeles said Friday that its roll-out of high-speed Internet
services didn't have the power needed to get out of low gear--and
blamed the city for the delay.</LD>
<LD>   Of the five cable operators serving Greater Los Angeles, Adelphia
Communications Corp. has offered high-speed cable modem service to
the smallest percentage of its service area--a little less than 40%.
By contrast, AT&amp;T Corp., Cox Communications Inc., Charter
Communications Inc. and Time Warner Cable say they have made cable
modems available to at least 93% of their subscribers.</LD>
<LD>   Cable modems have three main advantages over dial-up Internet
access: They're up to 20 times faster, they're always connected to
the Internet, and they don't tie up a phone line. The service, which
typically costs $20 to $30 more a month than a dial-up account, is
widely viewed as one of the critical precursors to the distribution
of music and movies via the Internet.</LD>
<TE>   Aiming to promote high-speed Internet access, the Federal
Communications Commission said Thursday that cable modems were an
information service, not a cable service, greatly reducing the threat
of local regulation.</TE>
<TE>   But Lee Perron, Adelphia's vice president of corporate affairs in
Southern California, said the main hurdle for his company had not
been regulation; it had been getting the Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power to provide electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Before it can offer service to former customers of Century
Communications Corp., which Adelphia bought for $5.2 billion in 1999,
Adelphia must replace Century's antiquated cables with high-capacity
two-way systems that allow data to flow in and out of a home.</TE>
<TE>   Perron said reconstruction work in the Sherman Oaks and Westwood
areas was only about 40% finished. In the Eagle Rock area, only 5% of
the system has been redone.</TE>
<TE>   Perron and Larry Windsor, regional government affairs manager for
Adelphia, said the construction was being delayed by the DWP, which
had been slow to provide power, and the Department of Public Works,
which had dragged its feet on trenching permits.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia has about 500 miles of network to install and is building
only 25 to 30 miles a week because of the administrative delays,
Perron said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have literally approximately 500 power supplies [for the new
system] already hung on the poles," Perron said. "Some of them have
been there for a year and a half. We're just waiting for them to get
turned on."</TE>
<TE>   DWP officials had no immediate response to Adelphia's complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Windsor said the explanation from the DWP and Public Works had
been the same: Hiring freezes had backed up the flow of work. The
firm has been asking city officials, including City Council members
Jack Weiss and Cindy Miscikowski, to help Adelphia press city
agencies to pick up the pace.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Hansen, a spokeswoman for Weiss, said his aides had passed
along Adelphia's concerns to the DWP. Miscikowski's office had no
immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   Perron said Adelphia planned to start offering cable modem
services in neighborhoods where its cables had been upgraded, even
though the rebuild was far from complete. The company plans to launch
services in West Los Angeles and Sherman Oaks within 60 days, and in
Eagle Rock within 90 days, he said.</TE>

<HD>State Jobless Rate Falls to 6.1% in February</HD>
<DH>Labor: Loss of 4,700 jobs last month gives a mixed view of
the economy. Picture is brightest in parts of Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's jobless rate declined to 6.1% in February, adding to the
recent spate of upbeat news pointing to an economy on the mend.</LD>
<LD>   February's drop from January's revised 6.4% rate marked the
largest monthly decline in state unemployment since March 1994. Most
regions of the state, including hard-hit Silicon Valley, saw
unemployment ease.</LD>
<LD>   Southern California continued to post some of the lowest
unemployment figures in the state, led by Orange County, which saw
its February rate drop to 3.6% from 3.9% in January, and San Diego,
whose rate declined to 3.7% from 4.1%. Los Angeles County likewise
saw its unemployment fall to 6.4% in February from a revised 6.6% the
month before.</LD>
<TE>   Still, California's employment picture remains decidedly mixed.
The state also reported Friday that California employers cut their
payrolls by 4,700 jobs last month, while January's revised job gains
were only about half of the 30,200 jobs previously reported. Compared
with February 2001, California has 51,200 fewer nonfarm payroll jobs
than it did a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   It might seem counterintuitive that unemployment could be falling
if employers aren't hiring. But Michael Bernick, director of the
state Employment Development Department, credits the drop in
joblessness to a rise in self-employment, a phenomenon typically seen
during periods of anemic job growth, as people who can't find work
create their own.</TE>
<TE>   A record number of Californians--16.5 million--were working in
February, with an estimated 1.6million of them involved in activity
that doesn't show up on someone else's payroll.</TE>
<TE>   "These figures show the dynamism of the California economy,''
Bernick said. "It reflects the strong entrepreneurial ethos at work
here."</TE>
<TE>   Illustrating that spirit are people such as Sarah Ratliff. Laid
off from her marketing job in January, the Fillmore, Calif., resident
opted to launch her own event-planning business, Purple Works Party
Planning.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to work for someone else and get laid off again,"
said Ratliff, 35. "Starting a business was a way to have some
control."</TE>
<TE>   The February decline in California's jobless figures mirrored the
performance of the U.S. jobless rate. As reported last week, U.S.
unemployment declined to 5.5% from 5.6% in January, its second
straight monthly drop and the lowest rate since October.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some analysts say it's premature to conclude that
California and U.S. rates have peaked. Employment is a lagging
indicator that often continues to rise even after an economic
turnaround is underway. In addition, employment statistics are
notoriously difficult to adjust for seasonal variation during the
winter months, a task made even trickier this year given mild weather
in much of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Roth, chief economist with the California Department of
Finance, said the statewide unemployment rate may creep up to about
6.5% over the next few months if sluggish job growth continues.</TE>
<TE>   February's decrease in nonfarm payroll jobs "was a
disappointment," Roth said. "We probably won't generate enough new
jobs to keep the unemployment rate from going up a bit."</TE>
<TE>   Economists also point to the challenges of interpreting monthly
data that typically undergo revisions the next month.</TE>
<TE>   January's revised jobless rate turned out to be higher than
initial calculations, for example, because of a large number of
unemployment claims reported after the preliminary figures were first
tallied. Tens of thousands of unemployed Californians laid off in
late 2001 delayed filing until January 2002 in order to take
advantage of higher benefits phased in after the first of the year.
The resulting spike in unemployment in January was the largest
monthly increase since February 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Four sectors--construction, wholesale trade, retail and
government--added a total of 20,200 jobs in February. Construction
showed the largest increase, adding 8,500 jobs. But those gains were
more than offset by a combined loss of 24,900 jobs in services,
manufacturing, transportation, public utilities, finance, insurance
and real estate.</TE>
<TE>   Employment in services posted the largest decline, down 17,600
because of continued losses in tech-related jobs such as computer
programming.</TE>
<TE>   The Latino unemployment rate edged down to 7.2% in February from
7.3% in January, but the rate for blacks jumped to 9.1% from 8.6% the
previous month.</TE>
<TE>   Colusa County posted the state's highest unemployment at 26.1%.
San Luis Obispo County posted the lowest at 3.1%.</TE>

<HD>4 Pension Funds Oppose HP Deal</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dissident Hewlett-Packard Co. director Walter Hewlett gained ground
in his bid to scuttle the Compaq Computer Corp. acquisition, as four
state pension funds said they would vote against the Palo Alto
computer company's proposed deal.</LD>
<LD>   Officials for the New York State Teachers' Retirement Fund, the
New York State Common Retirement Fund, the State of Michigan
Retirement Systems and the Public Employees' Retirement Assn. of
Colorado said they planned to vote their 15.5 million HP shares,
representing about 0.8% of the shares outstanding, against the
$20-billion deal.</LD>
<LD>   Retirement funds in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin said
they planned to vote in favor of the deal. Together, they represent
more than 8.5 million shares, or about 0.43% of HP's shares
outstanding.</LD>
<TE>   Walter Hewlett has been battling Chief Executive Carly Fiorina to
determine the future of the world's second-largest computer maker.
With three days to go before Tuesday's vote, shareholders
representing 23.01% of the company's stock have indicated they will
oppose the deal; shareholders representing 8.75% have said they will
vote in favor of it.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Friday, HP said the combined company would have earned 16
cents a share in HP's fiscal first quarter. By itself, HP had profit
of 25 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   HP shares fell 35 cents to $19.05 and Compaq fell 37 cents to
$10.33, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Enron Inspires Congress to Try Reform</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Differences between Democrats and Republicans
may make it difficult to pass many of the bills introduced.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As Enron-triggered legislation sweeps through Capitol Hill, and with
it the prospect of watershed reforms, a battle is shaping up over how
far Congress should go in riding herd on corporate America.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly three dozen bills have been introduced that would affect
company pension plans, accounting and corporate whistle-blowers,
among other subjects. Taken together, the legislation amounts to a
rewriting of the ground rules for publicly traded companies.</LD>
<LD>   But as the focus in Congress shifts from televised investigative
hearings to the work of crafting legislation, sharp differences have
emerged between Democratic and Republican lawmakers on a number of
key issues.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats want to go further in restricting accounting firms from
providing consulting services for companies they audit, contending
that such a step is necessary to prevent lucrative contracts from
compromising their duty to the investing public. Republicans want to
increase the budget for the Securities and Exchange Commission to
pursue corporate wrongdoing, but Democrats want to increase it more.</TE>
<TE>   Just about everyone on Capitol Hill wants to better protect
workers from the same fate that befell Enron employees who were left
with virtually worthless company stock in their retirement accounts.
But Democrats and Republicans differ--even among themselves--about
the best way to do it.</TE>
<TE>   And then, there is the perennial disagreement between Democrats
and Republicans over whether reforms are best left to regulators and
corporations themselves or should be imposed by legislation.</TE>
<TE>   With these divisions, some say that Congress will end up passing
relatively weak laws or that the major changes would be implemented
by companies themselves eager to restore public confidence and
investment.</TE>
<TE>   "Although both sides want to claim the mantle of 'Protector of
People's Pensions' in time for the November elections, substantive
disagreements do exist regarding what reform should look like," said
Patrick Basham, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute think
tank in Washington. "These disagreements--in tandem with the
overriding need for something to club the other side over the
electoral head with--will probably forestall the enactment of any
major reforms until next year at the earliest."</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, expect that Congress will adopt significant
legislation on corporate governance--eclipsing business reform
measures sparked by abuses in the savings-and-loan industry in the
late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "The S-and-L crisis was a set of corporate failures and ... it was
hard to focus on just what went wrong," said John W. Dienhart, chair
of business ethics at Seattle University. "Enron, on the other hand,
is a single, high-profile company with high-profile personalities,
internal whistle-blowers and a suicide [by a former executive]. The
targets are big and the money trail fairly clear. This gives
legislators many pegs on which to sell legislation to their
constituents and fellow lawmakers."</TE>
<TE>   There also is a political imperative: Many lawmakers would rather
be remembered as reformers than the recipients of the political
contributions that Enron doled out in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "If we do nothing, if we don't learn the lessons of Enron and
apply the steps to stop it from happening, there is nobody,
Republican or Democrat, who thinks this is not going to happen
again," said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the House Ways and Means Committee passed a bill,
dubbed the Employee Retirement Savings Bill of Rights, that would
permit workers to sell company stock from their 401(k) plans after
three years and pay for investment advice with pretax dollars
deducted from their paychecks.</TE>
<TE>   "We are still learning the lessons of Enron's collapse," said
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.). "But two things are
already clear: We need to restore the confidence of pension holders
and investors. And we need to restore basic standards of corporate
accountability."</TE>
<TE>   Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2 after
questions about its accounting practices and the revelation of
off-the-books partnerships that hid hundreds of millions of dollars
in losses caused its stock to plummet, costing investors billions of
dollars and more than 6,000 Enron employees their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   New rules for accountants, securities analysts, financial
disclosure, pensions and off-shore tax shelters have been proposed.
They are designed to ensure that companies provide an accurate
picture of their finances, auditors deliver the unvarnished truth
about a company's books and investors are aware of conflicts of
interest at Wall Street firms advising them on stock purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the more radical proposals, such as one to create a
federal Bureau of Audits to take over the job of auditing company
books, are unlikely to get to a vote.</TE>
<TE>   But many measures stand a good chance of passing. These include
proposals to:</TE>
<TE>   * Create a new board to police accountants.</TE>
<TE>   * Require corporate insiders to disclose sales of company stock in
a more timely manner.</TE>
<TE>   * Prohibit such stock sales when other employees are subject to a
lockdown on their 401(k) retirement accounts.</TE>
<TE>   * Require companies to disclose more financial information,
including off-balance-sheet transactions such as the ones that helped
undo Enron.</TE>
<TE>   There also is strong support for increasing the SEC budget.
But--as with many of the Enron-inspired reforms--Democrats and
Republicans disagree over how far to go. President Bush's 2003 budget
proposed $481 million for the SEC, a 6% increase. Congress wants to
hike that figure--House GOP leaders advocate $700 million; House
Democratic leaders $876 million.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say that the accounting industry, corporations
themselves and federal regulators, such as the SEC, are moving faster
than Congress to address problems spotlighted by Enron's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "The market will fix some things even before any legislation would
take effect," said Dana Hermanson, director of research of the
Corporate Governance Center at Kennesaw State University in Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, change is already evident, said Robert E. Litan, economic
studies director at the Brookings Institution think tank in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Even without any legislative or regulatory reforms, corporate
America has already changed the way it does business," he said.
"Boards are asking tougher questions, especially audit committees.
Managements are feeling more market pressure to provide more detailed
and useful disclosures. Accounting firms have been frightened by the
prospect of liability suits and more government regulation into
tightening up their audits."</TE>
<TE>   Others are more skeptical of whether business will reform
itself--or if Congress can be effective in mandating change.</TE>
<TE>   "The most difficult problem in the Enron situation," said David S.
Ruder, a former SEC chairman and now a professor at Northwestern
University School of Law, "stems from attitudes by managements of
some corporations that they are entitled to try to 'game' the system,
seeking to find ways to evade accounting rules and disclosure laws
and regulations without being in technical violation.</TE>
<TE>   "The SEC seems to be trying to address this approach, but the
solutions are very difficult," he said. "As has been frequently
observed, you can't create good moral conduct by legislation."</TE>
<TE>   But Congress, which in the words of Rep. Sam Johnson (R-Texas) has
become "all-Enron, all the time," seems determined to try.</TE>
<TE>   "It's to no one's interest to have the average investor on the
street wondering if his $200 is really safe," said Rep. Richard H.
Baker (R-La.), chairman of the House Financial Services subcommittee
on capital markets. "At the end of the day, we will have something."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The strongest industrial production numbers since June 2000 and a
consumer sentiment survey suggesting confidence remains steady pushed
stocks higher Friday. But analysts said Wall Street still seemed
guarded as investors await more proof that companies are benefiting
from the improving economy.</LD>
<LD>   "The economic news is making us feel a little bit better, but I
think the key to the market going forward is that first-quarter
[profits] need to get better," said Nick Sargen, global market
strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. "We've got to start seeing
consistent evidence that earnings have turned for the positive."</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 90.09 points, or 0.9%,
at 10,607.23. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 13.12 points, or
1.1%, to 1,166.16. The Nasdaq composite index gained 14.16 points, or
0.8%, to 1,868.30, snapping a four-day losing streak.</LD>
<TE>   Winners led losers by 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange and by
6 to 5 on Nasdaq. Trading was moderate, even though Friday was the
quarterly expiration date for stock futures and options.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow rose 0.3%, Nasdaq fell 3.2% and the S&amp;P 500
lost 0.2%. It was the fifth straight weekly advance for the blue-chip
Dow, the longest such string since Sept. 1, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks turned positive early Friday on a Federal Reserve report
showing a bigger-than-expected 0.4% increase in output at the
nation's factories, mines and utilities during February.</TE>
<TE>   The data was the strongest evidence yet that manufacturing is
emerging from its long downturn and that the recession that began a
year ago is easing.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a University of Michigan report was said to show
consumer sentiment at higher-than-expected levels. The consumer
confidence index rose to 95.0 this month after standing at 90.7 at
the end of February, according to Dow Jones News.</TE>
<TE>   Investors bid financial stocks higher, including American Express,
which gained $1.54 to $42.15. Manufacturing stocks also advanced.
General Motors rose 85 cents to $60.75, while Caterpillar rose $1.13
to $59.79.</TE>
<TE>   Drug maker Merck, which raised concerns about the successor for
its popular Vioxx painkiller, weighed on the Dow, losing $3.69 to
$59.75.</TE>
<TE>   Tech stocks were mixed on concerns the beleaguered sector will
turn around at a slower pace than the rest of the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle tumbled 84 cents to $12.60 after reporting disappointing
third-quarter results and warning that its returns won't improve
before summer.</TE>
<TE>   But Microsoft rose $1.27 to $62.49, rebounding from losses this
week caused by concerns its growth would be less vigorous than hoped.</TE>
<TE>   "The focus of the marketplace has moved away from technology
stocks since they're likely to be slow growers for a while," said
Todd Clark, head of listed equity trading at Wells Fargo Securities.
"A year ago, if tech or telecom weren't doing well, it was poison for
the overall market. That's no longer true."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, fixed-income investors locked in longer-term yields
that had reached eight-month highs. The yield on the benchmark
10-year Treasury note fell to 5.33% from 5.41% on Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Nordstrom Getting Back on Its Feet</HD>
<DH>Retail: After three tough years, the chain sees positive
response from Wall Street to its turnaround plans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Nordstrom Inc. opened its first new department store in Los
Angeles County in eight years Friday, the Seattle-based retailer
appears to be on the mend.</LD>
<LD>   After three disappointing years, Nordstrom is enjoying an
improving stock price, rising earnings and positive Wall Street
response to the company's turnaround plans.</LD>
<LD>   So far, however, much of the better showing comes from improved
financial management. Back under the control of the family that gave
the company its name, Nordstrom promises to focus on increasing
revenue this year.</LD>
<TE>   But as President Blake Nordstrom acknowledges, that goal will be
no easy feat in today's rough retail environment, which has been even
harder on department stores.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not where we want to be. But what encourages us in these
challenging times is that every day we're taking a step forward,"
Nordstrom said Thursday during ceremonies leading up to opening of
the new store in the Grove shopping complex next to Farmers Market in
Los Angeles. "Customers vote with their dollars and they have
choices. We need to create a reason for them to shop with us."</TE>
<TE>   Since about 1999, Nordstrom customers have not had enough reasons.
The company--famous for shoes to fit any foot and service reminiscent
of an upscale haberdashery--seemed out of touch with much of the
American public.</TE>
<TE>   Nordstrom's once-successful women's apparel business withered as
the offerings became too modern for its more traditional customer
base.</TE>
<TE>   And as more Americans turned to value-priced stores, rewarding
discounters Target Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. with huge sales
gains even in the highflying days of the late 1990s' boom economy,
Nordstrom seemed to stand alone as the store least likely to offer
shoppers a deal.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, until an unprecedented sale after Sept. 11, Nordstrom
steadfastly refused to deviate from its policy of holding just three
promotions a year even as competitors rushed to advertise a new
special every weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Nordstrom's biggest reason for holding off on markdowns pointed to
another problem, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   The company's systems were so antiquated that--unlike other large
chain stores that employ sophisticated technology capable of quickly
tracking the most specific details about sales--Nordstrom had scant
information about what was selling and what wasn't. That made it
nearly impossible to decide quickly on markdowns.</TE>
<TE>   For about three years, sales have grown as the company has added
stores, which now total 133. But sales in stores open at least a year
have hovered between flat and falling.</TE>
<TE>   Same-store sales are considered an important measure of a
company's health because they measure sales from consistent
locations, excluding new and closed stores.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings suffered as well. Operating income in 1999 was $277.6
million on revenue of $5.03 billion. In 2001, with revenue of $5.5
billion, operating income slipped to $131.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street punished the company's stock. From a high of nearly
$45 in early 1999, the stock had plunged as low as $13.80 in
September.</TE>
<TE>   For the last 18 months, since the Nordstrom family took back the
job of running the company from ousted Chairman and Chief Executive
John Whitacre, Nordstrom has been trying to catch up.</TE>
<TE>   Blake Nordstrom, under his father, board Chairman Bruce Nordstrom,
spent much of last year tightening the corporate belt, reforming
financial operations and updating stores' systems. That meant
slashing expenses, cutting inventory and slowing growth.</TE>
<TE>   Their opportunity, the Nordstroms say, is to capitalize on the
financial fixes to make merchandise and service fixes.</TE>
<TE>   Recapturing lost customers and gaining new customers, analysts
say, is a tougher proposition.</TE>
<TE>   Balancing the company's merchandise mix is just one of the
challenges, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Nordstrom, they say, must continue to keep inventories lean while
broadening its price range, appealing to value-seeking shoppers and
its more traditional, well-heeled base--which these days can be the
same consumer shopping on different days or for different occasions.</TE>
<TE>   There are some signs of improvement. Despite a tough year in 2001,
Nordstrom's fourth-quarter earnings beat estimates and rose 80% over
the same period a year earlier, despite a 3.4% decrease in same-store
sales.</TE>
<TE>   The improvement came from fewer markdowns than the company
anticipated and better cost controls, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street has rewarded the company stock, which closed Friday up
9 cents at $25.98 on the New York Stock Exchange, near its 52-week
high and nearly double its September low.</TE>
<TE>   "They're making improvements under Blake Nordstrom," said Bob
Buchanan, a department store analyst with A.G. Edwards. "But their
overall value message to the customers is insufficiently strong at a
time when the customer increasingly demands strong value. There's a
reason why Wal-Mart and Kohl's are showing huge gains. It's because
people are getting a deal there."</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the service issue. Once the industry envy,
Nordstrom's service has declined along with that of just about every
other American retailer.</TE>
<TE>   The difference is that Nordstrom used its customer relations as a
point of differentiation--an increasingly important goal as
department stores are struggling to avoid the sameness that forces
even tougher price competition.</TE>
<TE>   "Nordstrom must be careful not to let the value formula overtake
its image as a service-driven company," said Morgan Stanley analyst
Bruce Missett.</TE>

<HD>OPEC Agrees to Maintain Its Oil Production Targets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed Friday to
maintain its oil production targets through June, saying prices would
have to rise another 20% before members boost output.</LD>
<LD>   The group's price benchmark needs to top $28 a barrel before
members reverse supply cuts, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said. The
cartel's average oil price currently stands at $22.79, just within
the group's desired range of $22 to $28.</LD>
<LD>   But oil ministers from Saudi Arabia and Iran, OPEC's biggest
producers, also said they may be willing to sell more oil after June
to avoid fears of shortages.</LD>
<TE>   OPEC nations are seeking higher prices to shore up state budgets
that rely on oil sales for as much as 90% of revenue. Demand for oil
is rising at a rate only half that of the 1990s. But higher prices
will only curtail economic growth, some analysts warn.</TE>
<TE>   Oil prices have jumped this year, with near-term crude futures in
New York closing Friday at $24.51 a barrel, up from $19.84 on Dec.
31.</TE>
<TE>   But oil ministers, meeting here Friday, said prices are inflated
by $2 or more a barrel because of traders' concern that the U.S. may
attack Iraq as part of its war on terrorism, disrupting Middle East
oil shipments.</TE>
<TE>   A $10 increase in the price of crude oil can add 0.5 percentage
point to the U.S. index of consumer prices and shave economic growth
by a similar amount, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development estimates.</TE>
<TE>   OPEC members, however, say they are anticipating that the rise in
prices so far won't interfere with a global economic recovery this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a range between $22 and $28" for oil prices, Lukman said.
"So why should we raise [output] if it's not above $28?"</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>French bank BNP Paribas completed its $2.4-billion purchase of Los
Angeles-based United California Bank, which it will merge with Bank
of the West in San Francisco to create the state's fourth-largest
bank.</LD>
<LD>   After buying United California from UFJ Bank Ltd. of Japan, BNP
Paribas, through its BancWest Corp. subsidiary in Honolulu, has $34
billion in assets and 350 branches in California, six other Western
states, Guam and Saipan. United California, created last year when
Sanwa Bank California merged with Tokai Bank of California, will
become part of Bank of the West.</LD>
<LD>   The combined institution will eliminate the equivalent of 500 to
600 full-time positions from a work force of 6,000, mostly through
attrition, said Don J. McGrath, president of BancWest and chief
executive of Bank of the West.</LD>

<LD>Fresh economic data showed the U.S. manufacturing sector pulling out
of a deep slump and consumer sentiment on the upswing, reinforcing
notions that the economy is emerging from recession.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Reserve said industrial output rose 0.4% in February,
its strongest gain since mid-2000. With January figures revised
upward, production posted its first back-to-back monthly gains since
August and September 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, the University of Michigan released a poll showing
that consumers were more upbeat in early March. The survey of
consumer sentiment rose to 95 from February's 90.7--the highest
reading since December 2000.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co. is considering selling a 20% stake in its
property and casualty reinsurance unit to the public and spinning off
the remainder to investors later this year, people familiar with the
situation said.</LD>
<LD>   An initial public offering for shares in Employers Reinsurance
Corp., a unit of GE's financial arm GE Capital, could raise $2
billion, and the unit as a whole could fetch about $10 billion, the
people said.</LD>
<LD>   Employers Reinsurance has suffered declining profit in recent
years, as claims exceeded forecasts and reinsurers cut prices to gain
market share. It posted a loss last year because of $386 million in
claims on policies for the World Trade Center and the airplanes used
in the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The sale also may increase the chance that GE Capital will buy
CIT, the financial services company owned by Tyco International, said
Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Michael Regan.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of GE fell 22 cents to $40.19 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Reliant Energy Inc. had a profit in the fourth quarter after a loss a
year earlier from Latin American businesses and investments.</LD>
<LD>   Net income was $46.6 million, or 16 cents a share, contrasted with
a loss of $299 million, or $1.04, a year earlier, the company said.
Revenue fell 14% to $8.44 billion. Its trading unit's profit was
reduced by $68million, or 17 cents a share, from business with Enron
Corp., which filed for bankruptcy protection in December.</LD>
<LD>   Reliant delayed releasing results because of bookkeeping errors at
Reliant Resources Inc., the trading business it spun off in April.</LD>
<TE>   Reliant Energy shares rose 36 cents to $24.76 on the NYSE. Reliant
Resources gained 69 cents, or 4.9%, to $14.70.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant Resources had fourth-quarter net income of $33.3 million,
or 11 cents a share, including Enron costs.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting errors led to a restatement of earnings in the
second and third quarters, which added $134 million to net income.
Second-quarter income was $316million, or $1.08 a share, and
third-quarter income was $355 million, or $1.21.</TE>
<TE>   The trading unit had reported net income of $274 million, or 93
cents, in the second quarter and $290 million, or 99 cents, in the
third.</TE>

<HD>A Special Afghan New Year</HD>
<DH>Holiday: Immigrants say the end of Taliban rule will add to
the spring celebration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Afghan New Year's celebrations, banned under the Taliban, are back.</LD>
<LD>   Observed on the first day of spring, March 20 this year, the
holiday greets the new season with singing, dancing and aromatic
traditional foods. This year it also ushers in a new day.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a celebration of Afghanistan's liberation from the Taliban,"
said Laila Possani, one of the organizers of a spirited early
celebration Friday at Huntington Beach's Old World Banquet Hall.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a big deal this year, and not just because of New Year's,"
said Possani, manager of Radio Afghanistan in Encino. The station,
which broadcasts 24 hours a day in the Afghan languages of Dari and
Pashto, sponsored Friday's event, the first in a series of local
observances.</TE>
<TE>   "We are happy to celebrate again," she said of the event, which
drew several hundred Afghan expatriates from across Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that culture makes your identity. No matter how long
we've been [in the United States], we don't want to lose that
culture."</TE>
<TE>   When the Taliban came to power in 1998, the holiday was banned
because its roots were not religious, and predated Islam, Possani
said. Afghans living in Southern California "were very disappointed,"
she said. "We stopped having big celebrations here because we were so
sad about what was going on in Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   Historically, the holiday's themes have been hope and rebirth.
"It's the first day of spring," Possani said, "when farmers parade
with their animals and plant new trees."</TE>
<TE>   Lorraine Sakata, a professor of ethnomusicology at UCLA and author
of a book on Afghanistan, said she once spent the spring holiday in
the western part of Afghanistan before the Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a time for celebration and picnics," she said. "They would
bring special foods, set up swings in the parks for the kids and
schedule special programs of music and dance. It was a wonderful
time."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's gathering had an air of solemnity. Many celebrants were
dressed semi-formally--women in cocktail dresses, men in dark suits
with ties.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very historical for us," said Wali Mojadidi, 44, of Lake
Forest. "Now we are celebrating in the country and out of the
country. Hopefully, we can all go over and celebrate there, maybe
next year."</TE>

<HD>A Special Afghan New Year</HD>
<DH>Holiday: Immigrants say the end of Taliban rule adds
significance to the springtime celebration.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Afghan New Year's celebrations, banned under the Taliban, are back.</LD>
<LD>   Observed on the first day of spring, March 20 this year, the
holiday greets the new season with singing, dancing and aromatic
traditional foods. This year it also ushers in a new day.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a celebration of Afghanistan's liberation from the Taliban,"
said Laila Possani, one of the organizers of a spirited early
celebration Friday at Huntington Beach's Old World Banquet Hall.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a big deal this year, and not just because of New Year's,"
said Possani, manager of Radio Afghanistan in Encino. The station,
which broadcasts 24 hours a day in the Afghan languages of Dari and
Pashto, sponsored Friday's event, the first in a series of local
observances.</TE>
<TE>   "We are happy to celebrate again," she said of the event, which
drew several hundred Afghan expatriates from across Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that culture makes your identity. No matter how long
we've been [in the United States], we don't want to lose that
culture."</TE>
<TE>   When the Taliban came to power in 1998, the holiday was banned
because its roots were not religious, and predated Islam, Possani
said. Afghans living in Southern California "were very disappointed,"
she said. "We stopped having big celebrations here because we were so
sad about what was going on in Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   Historically, the holiday's themes have been hope and rebirth.
"It's the first day of spring," Possani said, "when farmers parade
with their animals and plant new trees."</TE>
<TE>   The holiday is observed widely in the Islamic world but especially
in Afghanistan, which has strong agrarian roots, Possani said.</TE>
<TE>   Lorraine Sakata, a professor of ethnomusicology at UCLA and author
of a book on Afghanistan, said she once spent the spring holiday in
the western part of Afghanistan before the Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a time for celebration and picnics," she said. "They would
bring special foods, set up swings in the parks for the kids and
schedule special programs of music and dance. It was a wonderful
time, corresponding with new beginnings."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's gathering had an air of solemnity. Many celebrants were
dressed semi-formally--women in cocktail dresses, men in dark suits
with ties.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very historical for us," said Wali Mojadidi, 44, of Lake
Forest. "Now we are celebrating in the country and out of the
country. Hopefully, we can all go over and celebrate there, maybe
next year."</TE>

<HD>Billboards Take a Low-Key Approach to Preventing AIDS</HD>
<DH>Health: Bilingual campaign avoids graphic images to reach
out to minority communities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aiming to spread the message of "loving responsibly," county
officials are launching a $1-million HIV prevention campaign that
shies away from explicit images but is intended to reach at-risk
minorities.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign consists of text-only bilingual billboards that
include AIDS awareness messages such as "Respecting Yourself and
Valuing Your Partner," and "Caring for Our Gay Sons and Brothers."</LD>
<LD>   The billboards also display a telephone number for counseling and
HIV testing sites.</LD>
<TE>   The billboards will be placed in Compton, South-Central, East Los
Angeles and other predominantly black and Latino communities.</TE>
<TE>   The ads take a conservative approach at a time in which AIDS
campaigns have been criticized for using explicit images.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials are reviewing AIDS prevention grants in San
Francisco and elsewhere, prompted by concerns that recent marketing
efforts might not be working and exceed the bounds of good taste.</TE>
<TE>   Provocative ads have also caused controversy in other states where
several ads showing homosexual couples and messages alluding to
bisexuality have been discontinued by media companies and government
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting them into this statement of loving responsibly is the
first step," said Charles L. Henry, director of the Los Angeles
County health department's office of AIDS programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to engage them into thinking about what [loving
responsibly] means. We feel that the message will be very impactful
without having to use explicit language or suggestive images."</TE>
<TE>   But some say that the county's ads are too plain to get their
point across.</TE>
<TE>   "Pictures would catch people's attention more quickly because it
gives them something to think about," said Joe Erskine, 56, an
African American truck driver who commutes between Culver City and
Alabama. He said he would not be offended if he saw an ad displaying
homosexual couples "because we are in L.A. It's so prevalent here."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign strives to reach black and Latino men having sex with
men and women, but the issue of bisexuality is not addressed in the
ads.</TE>
<TE>   Men constitute 90% of the cases of people living with AIDS in Los
Angeles County. Of that 90%, at least 65% are infected through sexual
contact with other men, according to county statistics. Though the
number of infections among minority men is growing, reaching those
men in prevention campaigns can be difficult because bisexual
behavior often is not openly acknowledged or discussed.</TE>
<TE>   "People are not sharing the full extent of their sexual activity,"
Henry said, adding that the goal is to make people think not only
about their risk, but also about the risk in which they are placing
their partners. Gunther Freehill, one of the campaign designers, said
that by making the ads uniform and nonspecific, they will avoid
turning some people off.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking for a very broad audience. I don't want to
narrowcast it in a way that's going to exclude the people who need to
come to the table.... If you are too explicit, some people will shut
down and say, 'This is not happening in my community,'" Henry said.</TE>
<TE>   James Benjamin, a 23-year-old African American who lives in
South-Central Los Angeles, said he doesn't know if explicit pictures
including homosexual couples would translate well in his community.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nothing that people would accept easily," he said while
sitting at a barbershop in the Crenshaw district.</TE>
<TE>   Because black and Latino groups have been particularly difficult
to reach, AIDS prevention groups are seeking more creative ways to
get the message across.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the HIV Prevention Trials Network, a worldwide AIDS and
behavioral studies research firm with offices in Los Angeles,
launched a prevention program called Fighting HIV Through R&amp;B. The
program offered free tickets to rhythm and blues concerts to lure
African Americans to get tested for HIV.</TE>
<TE>   About two years ago, the health department used a 1953 Chevy
lowrider to bring the AIDS prevention message to various car shows,
hoping to appeal to Latino car aficionados.</TE>
<TE>   And this year, AIDS Project Los Angeles released a booklet with
more than a dozen personal stories from HIV-positive Latinos in an
effort to encourage dialogue about AIDS prevention.</TE>
<TE>   AIDS Project Los Angeles is taking a more direct approach,
addressing the issue of bisexuality in a poster campaign in the San
Fernando Valley. The posters use images of homosexual couples.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Wongvipat, manager of prevention programs, said that using
sexy images among certain communities could be very efficient and
that the county should not use a "one-size-fits-all" approach.</TE>
<TE>   Freehill said the health department has conducted several focus
groups and plans to use pictures and more personal messages during
future phases of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the county might not address the issue of bisexuality
directly.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing we want to do is get caught up in a debate about
identity," Henry said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to engage them in a discussion about their behavior."</TE>
<TE>   The lack of pictures did not bother Miguel Humberto Lopez, who
read one of the ads during a workout at El Centro del Pueblo, a
Latino support center in the Rampart district.</TE>
<TE>   When he saw the text, he was concerned because he had been having
unprotected sex with several women. He discreetly stopped his
workout, asked for a pen and paper, and said he would call (800)
367-2437 to get testing information.</TE>

<HD>Plans for New Interchange by LAX Revived</HD>
<DH>Traffic: Proposal for Arbor Vitae exchange on 405 Freeway
upsets airport expansion foes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last April, Mike Stevens thought he'd won.</LD>
<LD>   He and other airport expansion foes had successfully lobbied the
Southern California Assn. of Governments to keep a new interchange
for the San Diego Freeway in Inglewood from being added to a list of
regional transportation improvements. But in a reversal, the regional
planning agency last week voted to put the so-called Arbor Vitae
exchange back on the table--fueling fears of those who live in the
area that plans for greatly expanding Los Angeles International
Airport are not as dead as some city leaders have said.</LD>
<LD>   "We were appalled and mystified," said Stevens, president of the
group LAX Expansion No!</LD>
<TE>   Before a transit improvement project can be funded, it must be
placed on the regional transportation plan by the governments
association. The interchange east of the airport would ease the flow
of traffic from the freeway to LAX.</TE>
<TE>   For opponents, that raises concerns that a plan to bring many more
jets and passengers to the airport is alive, despite Los Angeles
Mayor James K. Hahn's statements that the $12-billion expansion
favored by his predecessor, Richard Riordan, has been shelved. Hahn
instead is proposing a smaller renovation project that would focus on
security and air safety.</TE>
<TE>   "The only purpose of the [interchange] is to support traffic to"
LAX, said Harry Rose, director of communications for the Osage
Neighborhood Assn. "I think my community is going to get rolled."</TE>
<TE>   But interchange backers say it is needed to ease freeway
congestion between Century and Manchester boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no interchange at Arbor Vitae [Street] and there is a
lot of traffic at Century and Manchester," said Renee Berlin of the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority's planning department. "It will
improve east-west access in the area, improve safety and improve
traffic time."</TE>
<TE>   John Vassiliades, the California Department of Transportation
project manager for the Arbor Vitae interchange, said the project is
simply "to provide relief to congestion.... This should not be held
hostage to LAX expansion."</TE>
<TE>   The project was conceived in 1976, he said. Funding was set aside
in 1980 for construction in 1983-84. But the project was often
postponed for various reasons--from funding issues to calls for
environmental studies to the outcry from anti-airport expansion
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Vassiliades said the project--which would widen the Arbor Vitae
overpass from six to eight lanes, add an offramp from the northbound
freeway to Arbor Vitae and create an onramp from Arbor Vitae to the
southbound freeway--is still in the design phase. Plans for the north
half of the interchange are not yet funded.</TE>
<TE>   Work is expected to begin in 2004, he said. Construction is
expected to last a year and cost about $55 million.</TE>
<TE>   When completed, the interchange would provide new access to the
Forum and Hollywood Park, Vassiliades said.</TE>
<TE>   Increased traffic is what worries Stevens and other activists.
"We're concerned about the pollution it will bring ... the diesel
trucks coming off the 405 and spewing their carcinogens," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens says he feels betrayed by Southern California Assn. of
Governments members who voted for the interchange, especially local
representatives.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually when the 405 bottlenecks, it's in Inglewood," said Glenda
Wina, press deputy for county Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke,
whose district includes Inglewood. Burke is a proponent of the
interchange who "wants to see traffic alleviated," Wina said. "That's
what this is about."</TE>

<HD>2 Homes, 5 Cars Hit by a Suspicious Fire</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An early morning fire Friday in Pasadena that burned two homes,
destroyed five cars and killed a dog is being considered arson by
fire officials.</LD>
<LD>   Battalion Chief Fred Law of the Pasadena Fire Department said the
3:30 a.m. blaze in the 600 block of North Orange Grove Boulevard
apparently started in an apartment building's carport and quickly
spread to the neighboring homes, causing about $360,000 in damage.</LD>
<LD>   The Saucedo family members were unaware that the fire had spread
to their home until police began pounding on their door. The family
rushed outside.</LD>
<TE>   "We could hear explosions, but didn't know what it was," said Ruby
Saucedo, 20, who with her family spent Friday morning trying to
salvage the few water-soaked belongings retrieved from the gutted
house. The family's Chihuahua could not be rescued from the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Law said it appears that a 1996 Mustang parked in the carport was
the point of origin for the fire.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost a split second" after the Mustang ignited, he said, "all
five cars were fully involved."</TE>
<TE>   The explosions Saucedo heard, said firefighters at the scene, were
the sounds of car tires popping.</TE>
<TE>   Law said the intensity of the fire--which broke windows, singed
eaves and melted window blinds in the nearby apartment building--led
investigators to conclude that a flammable liquid had been poured on
or near the first car.</TE>
<TE>   The owner of the Mustang said she had no idea who would have set
fire to her car, which had been parked in the carport since 7 the
night before.</TE>

<HD>Foundation Awards Aim to Boost Stature of Urban School
Districts</HD>
<DH>Philanthropy: Eli Broad announces the $500,000 annual
grants for scholarships linked to performance gains.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles billionaire businessman Eli Broad, a public school
graduate, on Friday announced the creation of an annual $500,000
award meant to help rebuild confidence in urban public education by
showcasing examples of success.</LD>
<LD>   The prize will go toward college and technical scholarships for
graduates of the big-city district that makes the greatest overall
gains in student performance while also shrinking the persistent
differences in achievement between minority students and their white
counterparts. Broad also announced that his family would quadruple
its stake to $400 million in the Broad Foundation, which is offering
the annual prize. The foundation aims to improve the management
skills of administrators, teachers union leaders and school boards in
the belief that better leadership and labor relations will foster
improved student achievement.</LD>
<LD>   Listed by the Chronicle of Philanthropy as one of the five most
generous givers to charity in the U.S., Broad made the announcements
at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., flanked by U.S. Secretary of
Education Rod Paige and high-ranking members of Congress.</LD>
<TE>   "Just about everyone's dissatisfied with public education, and
while we keep reading about the failures, I hope this will spotlight
success and get the public to believe that public schools can
succeed," Broad said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the scholarship prize, the foundation also will pay
for educators to visit the winning district and for the recipients to
send people on the road to share the secrets of their success. The
new prize would be among the most lucrative in the field of education
and the only one to honor a district, rather than a distinguished
individual.</TE>
<TE>   Each year's winner of the Broad Prize in Urban Education will be
selected from a group of about 100 of the nation's big urban
districts, most of which serve large numbers of poor and minority
students and have seen the flight of middle-class families.</TE>
<TE>   A team of education leaders that includes the former
superintendents of schools in New York, Philadelphia and Memphis; the
heads of national education organizations; and the president of the
American Federation of Teachers, will choose finalists by sifting
through test scores, dropout and attendance statistics and
information about teachers' qualifications and performance. The final
selection is to be made by a jury of business and political leaders.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Paige said the aims of the Broad prize fit well
with those of the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate leaders have been strong supporters of the testing and
accountability provisions of the administration strategy and have
launched campaigns in many states to bolster political and community
support.</TE>
<TE>   Paige said public schools should "benefit the whole public, and
the business community is part of the public." He said Broad's effort
"transcends expedience" and described him as "just a good and moral
person and a great corporate citizen."</TE>
<TE>   Broad, a child of Jewish immigrants from Lithuania, graduated from
Detroit's Central High School and then from Michigan State
University. He founded the home building business now known as KB
Home in Detroit and now chairs SunAmerica Inc., a leading financial
services company specializing in retirement savings.</TE>
<TE>   A patron of the arts and an avid supporter of higher education,
Broad has made major contributions to the School of Arts and
Architecture at UCLA and to other universities. He's also leading an
effort to make Grand Avenue in downtown Los Angeles a lively
boulevard, and he was a leader of the campaign to raise money for the
Walt Disney Concert Hall now under construction</TE>
<TE>   Broad became involved in K-12 education in 1999 out of concern
that changes in the economy and the labor market were widening the
gap between rich and poor and threatening the existence of the
nation's middle class.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to helping train superintendents, union leaders and
school board members nationally, Broad's foundation has funded
leadership-related projects with the public schools in Los Angeles,
San Diego, Oakland, Long Beach and Sacramento.</TE>

<HD>Accident That Killed 2 Sisters Was Preventable, Critics Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PORTERVILLE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Family and friends of two sisters buried alive in a 20-foot-deep sand
pit Wednesday said the accident could have been prevented.</LD>
<LD>   A section of the fence around the property was damaged after a car
accident, and that allowed children at a nearby school to use the
cemetery property as a shortcut home, Principal Lorenzo Cruz said.</LD>
<LD>   "When somebody hit that fence and knocked it down, they should've
fixed it right there and then," said Tina Freeman, whose daughter was
a friend of a girl who died in the accident. "There's a school right
across the street. People should be more responsible."</LD>
<TE>   Sisters Andrea Cavazos, 12, and Alyssa Ortiz, 9, were killed after
they tried to retrieve a basketball in the pit. A third girl, Miranda
Hernandez, 11, was listed in stable condition Friday.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, work crews cut down the banks of the sand pile at the
21-year-old pit, owned by Porterville Cemeteries District. The
cemetery uses the 150-foot-wide pit to store excess soil.</TE>
<TE>   Cemetery board member Darrell Taylor said the cemetery is
cooperating with the investigation.</TE>

<HD>A Missed Chance to Illuminate Complex Ties Between Family
Life, Faith</HD>
<DH>THINGS YOU GET FOR FREE; By Michael McGirr; Atlantic
Monthly Press; 304 pages, $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORA GALLAGHER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unhappy families have a private language, a conspiracy among members
to keep from the world the secret of their unhappiness. How does
faith affect this drama? Does it become a part of the unhappiness? Or
does it try to break it open?</LD>
<LD>   These questions struggle just beneath the surface in "Things You
Get for Free," Michael McGirr's memoir about travels with his mother.</LD>
<LD>   McGirr is an Australian Jesuit priest who takes his mother to
Europe for six weeks, a honeymoon she once planned with her husband
but never got to take.</LD>
<TE>   They travel a well-worn map in high summer: Italy, France,
England, Germany and Scotland, a prepackaged bus tour that visits
four countries in seven days, but the main attractions for them are
Catholic shrines: the church of St. Alphonsus and the Sistine Chapel
in Rome, Sacre Coeur in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Their traveling companions provide a little color: the couple who
call themselves Max and Min and drink early and often; the
hypochondriac wife who borrows everyone's sweaters and gobbles pills
at breakfast; the couple who announce that they are breaking up at
the beginning of the trip.</TE>
<TE>   McGirr tries to write funny, but the material he leaks between
jokes pulls us toward something far more serious. Vignettes about his
father are interspersed among the chapters: Often depressed, a
gambler, he was addicted to an over-the-counter drug and died of
renal failure after a six-year struggle, leaving his wife and two
young sons, one of whom, Michael, joined the Jesuits a year later,
when he was 17.</TE>
<TE>   It was a decision with mixed motives, one of which was an attempt
to suppress his grief. And the person who knew this from the
beginning was his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Maureen McGirr, known throughout the book as Mum, stands center
stage, a devout Roman Catholic of the old school. She finds solace in
Catholic shrines, devotion to Mary, "miraculous" medals, prayers for
personal intervention. Mother and son differ in their Catholicism:
"Her faith leaps over detail in its eagerness to get to the safe
harbor of 'trust God' or 'let Gold' or 'let God work it out,'" McGirr
writes. "My faith depends on life becoming more dense, chaotic,
inexplicable." She has never accepted his vocation, but what becomes
clear, as the book wears on, is that he may not have accepted his
vocation either. She knows this. He does not.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the good scenes in the book, McGirr's version of his
mother's faith is turned on its head: Mum and Michael visit St.
Peter's Basilica, "for 70 years, the physical center of Mum's
religion," on the feast day of St. Peter and St. Paul. He rushes
forward with other tourists to see the statue of St. Peter, which on
his feast day wears "a triple tiara." She hesitates, taking in the
extravagance of gold leaf, bronze and marble, and forms half a
sentence: "When you think .... "</TE>
<TE>   Her son, irritated to be held up by her musings, asks, "What?"</TE>
<TE>   "When you think that Jesus had nothing," she replies. And he falls
silent, realizing that his Mum's quiet devotion is a little more
complex than a simple glide to the first safe harbor.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the book, he seems to have a greater respect for her
faith and an understanding of its origins, while she meets his
excitement, for instance, in Paris in the chapel where Ignatius'
first vows were honored, with a more chilly reverence. When he ends
up in conversation with a young woman on the tour, she recognizes a
flirtation.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you make any friends [on the tour]?" he asks her.</TE>
<TE>   "I know you did," she replies.</TE>
<TE>   Though we don't hear the end of that story in this book, the
jacket copy says that McGirr is now a former Jesuit priest.</TE>
<TE>   McGirr is best when describing things--the Pieta, the papers in
Cardinal Newman's study, the corridor leading to the rooms where
Ignatius lived for the last years of his life. He's less gifted with
people.</TE>
<TE>   The parent who is most alive on the page is the one who is dead,
his dad, the one who cannot retaliate for truths told. Given
Michael's father's depression, addiction and death, family life was
hard, yet mother and son do not speak of it. How their separate
faiths (under the tent of the same church) penetrate or alleviate the
family's pain is never examined. How religious faith enters into the
hidden world of families is often neglected--in memoir (and in
church)--and so we have very little information about how these two
huge spheres, so influential in our lives, coincide.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell the truth," McGirr quotes Emily Dickinson, "but tell it
slant." If only he had taken longer to dive beneath the material of
his life and come up with a bolder book. This tale is told too much
at slant, and at the promising crossroads of faith and family life,
this is a deep regret.</TE>
<TE>   Nora Gallagher is the author of the memoir "Things Seen and
Unseen: A Year Lived in Faith" and the forthcoming "Practicing
Resurrection: A Memoir of Discernment."</TE>

terrorist attacks.</LD>

unforgettable and woeful day of Sept. 11," the 62-year-old prelate
said as he presided over a memorial service.</LD>

<LD>GENOA, Italy--A Roman Catholic priest has promised to cut back on the
number of times he rings the church bells after a parishioner called
in her lawyer to complain.</LD>
<LD>   Sonia Sander, who lives near the church, said the priest ignored
her repeated complaints that the bells at Santa Maria Immacolata kept
her awake at night.</LD>
<LD>   The volume of the ringing was measured at 80 decibels, well above
the legal limit of 30, Sander's lawyer, Laura Buffa, said.</LD>
<TE>   Buffa and the Rev. Amos Romano reached a 30-day trial agreement
limiting the bell-ringing to five times on Sundays and holidays and
three times on other days.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--Two leading Orthodox Jewish groups have taken a position
on cloning, saying that they support using the process to cure
diseases but oppose it for reproductive purposes.</LD>
<LD>   In therapeutic cloning, a cloned embryo is created for research or
medical treatments and destroyed before developing into a fetus.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers hope to create embryonic stem cells that could develop
into compatible organs and replace a patient's ailing heart, liver or
kidneys.</LD>
<TE>   The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, which represents
nearly 1,000 synagogues, and the Rabbinical Council of America
concluded that an embryo does not have the status of a person in
Jewish tradition.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the Torah commands Jews to heal the sick, to be
God's "partner in safeguarding the created," the organizations said
in a prepared statement this week.</TE>

<LD>VANCOUVER, British Columbia--More than 60 bishops of the Evangelical

Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan and Palestine continue to
suffer as innocent victims of the violence in the Middle East," said
Mark Hanson, the presiding bishop of the 5.2-million-member
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli military forces have been occupying Dar al-Kalima Model
School, on a Bethlehem hilltop. The forces have destroyed some of the
school's windows, as well as a ceramic cross.</LD>
<TE>   Since it opened in 1998, American Lutherans have donated more than
$150,000 to the creation of the 240-student school.</TE>

<LD>GREENVILLE, S.C.--The president of Bob Jones University says that he
wants to shed the school's fundamentalist label because the term has
been equated with terrorist in the minds of many people since Sept.
11.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Jones III has suggested using the word "preservationist" to
describe Christians with a fierce belief in the Bible's literal,
inerrant truth.</LD>
<LD>   "Instead of 'Fundamentalism' defining us as steadfast Bible
believers, the term now carries overtones of radicalism and
terrorism," writes Bob Jones III in his "President's Corner" column
on the university Web site, www.bju.edu/aboutbju/aboutbju.asp?section
=president.</LD>
<TE>   University spokesman Jonathan Pait said the university remains
"unashamedly fundamentalist."</TE>
<TE>   Pait accused the media of lumping Christian fundamentalists with
Islamic fundamentalists.</TE>

<HD>Priest Urges Return of Sacred Ethiopian Objects</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LONDON--The Scottish priest who last year found a tabot--an Ethiopian
sacred wooden tablet--in his church and returned it to
representatives of the Ethiopian Church has become the chairman of a
new group formed to press for the return to Ethiopian sacred objects.</LD>
<LD>   The loot, among many objects taken from the country as war booty,
was taken after the defeat by British troops in 1868 of Emperor
Theodore at his mountain stronghold of Magdala. Fifteen elephants and
200 mules were needed to carry it away, according to scholars.</LD>
<LD>   It was apparently auctioned off, with the proceeds used to pay the
troops.</LD>
<TE>   That was how a Scottish officer who had served at Magdala was able
to give the tabot he had acquired to Edinburgh's Episcopal Church of
St. John, where the present rector, the Rev. John McLuckie,
discovered it. In January it was given to a delegation led by
Archbishop Isaias and including the Ethiopian ambassador to the
United Kingdom.</TE>

<LD>NEW YORK--A new survey has found that more than 1 million U.S. Jewish
households, or 44%, are affiliated with a congregation, up from
880,000 families in a parallel survey a decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   But the American Jewish Identity Survey 2001 also indicates
secularism is a growing force.</LD>
<LD>   About 1.7 million people who called themselves Jewish by identity,
parentage or upbringing describe their households as atheist,
agnostic, secular, humanist or as having no religion.</LD>
<TE>   The results are an increase of 53% from a 1990 survey.</TE>
<TE>   About 1.1 million adults identify with the Reform branch, 940,000
with the Conservative branch, 300,000 with Orthodoxy and 75,000 with
other groups.</TE>
<TE>   The study of 1,668 Jewish households was conducted by the Center
for Jewish Studies at the City University of New York.</TE>

<HD>Canine DNA Leads to Conviction in Burglary, Assault</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a hard-fought trial in Ventura County Superior Court, a Simi
Valley burglar and would-be rapist was proved guilty by a hair.</LD>
<LD>   A dog hair.</LD>
<LD>   It belonged to a black-and-white Shih Tzu named Casper, whose
furious barking the night of Sept. 22, 2000, alerted his owner to an
intruder in her bedroom. When the man fled after a brutal rape
attempt, he left with the dog's hair on his pants.</LD>
<TE>   Those fibers were later matched to Casper by scientists and
introduced as evidence. Last month, they helped convict 24-year-old
Soum Laykham of residential burglary and assault with intent to
commit rape in one of the state's first criminal cases involving the
use of canine DNA.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really, really great evidence," said Senior Deputy Dist.
Atty. Lisa Lee, who persuaded a judge to let her admit Casper's
genetic paw prints over defense objections that there are no
generally accepted scientific methods for testing dog DNA.</TE>
<TE>   Although attorneys could find no existing California case law on
the subject, Judge Kevin J. McGee ruled that the procedures for
testing canine DNA are not new and are generally the same as those
used for testing human DNA.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only did Casper bark and save her from being raped," Lee
said, "but Casper was key in getting this guy convicted."</TE>
<TE>   Laykham, who lived next door to the 60-year-old victim, was
sentenced last week to six years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't filed a notice of appeal, but Lee expects the case will
be challenged before a state appellate court and anticipates that pet
DNA will become a widely used forensic tool.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are going to be a lot more cases like this coming
down," she said.</TE>
<TE>   So-called genetic fingerprinting was developed in the mid-1980s by
a British geneticist and entails extracting DNA, deoxyribonucleic
acid, from samples of blood, hair, skin or semen to establish an
individual's genetic code or pattern.</TE>
<TE>   Such testing has been used for more than a decade in courtrooms
across the nation to convict or exonerate criminal suspects. In fact,
in 1989 Ventura County prosecutors became the first in California to
introduce human DNA to establish the identity of a killer. But the
use of pet DNA as forensic evidence is relatively new.</TE>
<TE>   The first introduction in a criminal case is believed to have been
in Canada in 1996, when prosecutors used cat hairs on a bloody jacket
to link a man to the slaying of his estranged wife.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Washington state prosecutors used DNA from a dog to help
convict two men of a double homicide in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The two defendants were accused of killing a young couple and
their dog after demanding drugs and money.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, prosecutors presented evidence that clothes linked to
the defendants bore bloodstains from the dog.</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle case is believed to be the first in the United States
in which canine DNA was presented as evidence in a criminal trial.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, prosecutors in other states have used genetic testing
on pets to solve crimes. But the use of such evidence in California
criminal courts is rare. "I could not find another case that talked
about dog DNA," Lee said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Simi Valley case, the shaggy little dog whose hair helped
identify the attacker is being credited with preventing a rape.</TE>
<TE>   According to court records, it was Casper's barking that alerted
the victim to a man standing in the doorway of her bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   As the intruder approached, she threw a box at him, grabbed the
phone and called 911. He knocked the phone out of her hand and hit
her in the face. As they struggled, he tried to rape her. When the
living room phone rang, the woman told her attacker it was the police
and he took off.</TE>
<TE>   An officer found the woman bloodied and bruised. She described the
attacker, noting a tattoo on his inner left forearm.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, detectives stopped Laykham at his apartment complex.
He matched the description, and the victim identified him, records
show.</TE>
<TE>   But when Laykham denied the charges, Simi Valley detectives
remembered the dog and decided to check the suspect's clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Laykham provided police with a pair of pants, Sgt. John Parks
said. The detective also rolled tape over a second pair, picking up
hair that was dissimilar to the suspect's own dog, a chocolate pit
bull mix.</TE>
<TE>   The hair and a reference sample taken from Casper were sent to a
Davis-based lab and matched by scientist Joy Halverson, who also
testified in the Seattle case. Halverson has developed a genetic
database of about 470 dogs of various breeds.</TE>
<TE>   A statistician determined that the odds the hair on Laykham's
pants came from a dog other than Casper were about 1 in 230 million
when compared with all breeds in the database, Lee said.</TE>

<DH>Recreation: City's first school once sat on the 2-acre
downtown site. Details such as concrete scoring reflect its history.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The second of three new downtown parks in Anaheim will be dedicated
today at a ceremony featuring family activities and, in keeping with
the park's name, free cherry pie.</LD>
<LD>   George Washington Park at 250 E. Cypress St., built where the
city's first school once stood, is on 2 acres with picnic and play
areas, a rose garden, gazebo and bandstand. Its construction is part
of a push to provide more open space for residents, said Chris Jarvi,
director of community services.</LD>
<LD>   "It's fairly small, but it's a very nice piece of landscape
architecture," Jarvi said. "Even the concrete scoring mimics early
scoring in the 1900s. When you look around, you can see the detail
and construction of the early years were incorporated into the park."</LD>
<TE>   In September, the city opened Oak Grove Park at 905 S. Anaheim
Blvd. Ross Park near Manchester Avenue and Santa Ana Street is set to
open this fall. George Washington Park is where an elementary school
was built in 1879 and operated until the late 1970s, when the school
district sold the property to the city. Planners took pains to
reflect that history in the park's design, Jarvi said. A plaque
chronicles the uses of the property over the years. The gazebo was
designed with the Craftsman-style architecture of the early 1900s,
and fencing around the park is decorative wrought iron.</TE>
<TE>   The city bought the property from the Anaheim City School District
in the 1970s and converted the old schoolhouse into a community
center. When the Downtown Community Center opened in 1988, the school
was razed. City officials held on to the property with the goal of
converting it into a park for strolling and picnicking.</TE>
<TE>   "Finding land for parks has become more and more difficult"
because Anaheim has little vacant land, Jarvi said. "For a number of
years now, the school district has been selling off its closed sites
to developers, and when homes are built, it's a double whammy because
you've got more people coming in."</TE>
<TE>   The city's solution has been to buy old buildings, then convert
the land to parks. An example was Walnut Grove Park, which opened in
September at 905 S. Anaheim Blvd. Businesses and homes once occupied
the 3-acre site, which now has basketball courts, ball fields, a
playground and picnic areas.</TE>
<TE>   Ross Park, built where a lumberyard used to be, will be nearly 6
acres with a playground, picnic areas, lighted ball fields and
basketball courts.</TE>

<HD>Drunk Driving St. Pat's Hazard</HD>
<DH>Safety: Deaths and injuries are more likely on this holiday
than on other days. 'It's all surrounding alcohol,' one safety
advocate says.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>California motorists are 21% more likely to be killed or injured in
an alcohol-related crash on St. Patrick's Day than they are on other
days, according to an analysis released in time for the holiday
honoring Ireland's patron saint.</LD>
<LD>   The study by the Auto Club of Southern California found the risk
of being involved in a drunk driving accident jumps on March 17 by
21% in Los Angeles County, 19% in San Diego County and 64% in Orange
County.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the higher risks drivers could face Sunday, most police
departments in Los Angeles and Orange counties deploy no special
enforcement efforts to crack down on drunk drivers. The free taxi and
shuttle rides often offered on New Year's Eve are also rare on St.
Patrick's Day.</LD>
<TE>   The holiday was established to honor the Catholic bishop who
helped bring Christianity to Ireland in the 5th century. But in
America, many people complain that the holiday has primarily become
an excuse for drinking. "St. Patrick's Day is a drinking holiday,"
said Tina Pasco, executive director of Mothers Against Drunk Driving
in Los Angeles. "It's all surrounding alcohol."</TE>
<TE>   Many Irish Americans say they are disappointed that the true
meaning of the holiday has been lost in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "It was intended to be a religious celebration," said Brother
Edwin Guidera, a member of the Brothers of St. Patrick, a religious
nonprofit group based in the Orange County community of Midway City.
"We celebrate by attending Mass."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Irish pubs and restaurants throughout Southern California are
expecting to entertain record crowds this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year we get bigger and bigger crowds," said Julie Keegan,
manager of Keegan's, an Irish pub and restaurant in Torrance. She
expects more than 900 patrons on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Keegan said her bartenders will make an effort to call a taxi for
customers who drink more than their share.</TE>
<TE>   "We take the keys off the customers who have had too much," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Several law enforcement officials said most of their special
enforcement efforts are rolled out for other heavy-drinking holidays,
like New Year's Eve, Labor Day and Memorial Day.</TE>
<TE>   The Auto Club analyzed California Highway Patrol data on
alcohol-related traffic injuries and deaths for 1991 through 2001.
The study compared the data for the last 11 St. Patrick's Days with
other days falling four weeks before and after March 17.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, an average of 45 people have been injured
or killed in alcohol-related crashes on St. Patrick's Day since 1991.
On non-holidays during that same period, an average of 37 people a
day have been killed or injured due to drunk drivers, according to
the analysis.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, an average of 13 motorists have been killed or
injured on St. Patrick's Day since 1991. The equivalent casualty
figure for non-holidays was 11, according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, an average of 14 people have been killed or
injured in alcohol related accidents on St. Patrick's Day, compared
with the nine killed or injured on more typical driving days,
according to the Auto Club.</TE>
<TE>   In general, drunk driving accidents have been on the decline for
years. Experts give part of the credit to increased law enforcement
efforts and to greater outreach programs by groups like MADD.</TE>
<TE>   But drunk driving accidents jumped for the first time in 14 years
in 2000, by nearly 5% statewide. Final statistics for 2001 are not
yet available.</TE>
<TE>   "When we look at these St. Patrick's Day crash statistics--along
with the fact that annual alcohol-related crashes have recently risen
for the first time in 14 years--we see a real cause for concern about
this weekend," said Steven Bloch, the Auto Club's senior researcher.</TE>

<HD>Strong Economic Year Is Forecast, but With a Caveat</HD>
<DH>Conference: Experts are bullish on region's future, but say
officials must account for the negative side of growth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County's economy should remain strong in 2002, with more
jobs, low unemployment and higher household incomes, due in large
part to the increasing prosperity of its three east county cities.</LD>
<LD>   But to sustain that growth and maintain the quality of life for
county residents, civic leaders must work together to better manage
everything from transportation and education to health care and the
environment.</LD>
<LD>   That was the message delivered Friday by economists at the first
community assessment conference staged by Cal Lutheran University and
UC Santa Barbara. The event, attended by more than 100 educators and
business people, was held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.</LD>
<TE>   "It's up to the community to define the quality of life," said
Charles Maxey, dean of CLU's business school. "We don't believe
economic development and quality of life are opposite ends of the
continuum."</TE>
<TE>   Discussions about quality of life should examine the relationship
between such factors as employment growth and housing affordability.
Other things to look at would be traffic, pollution and education, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Public health statistics, graduation rates and support of the arts
should also be used to measure progress, Maxey added.</TE>
<TE>   A potential problem for Ventura County is the income disparity
among its residents, said Cal Lutheran economics professor Jamshid
Damooei, director of the university's Center for Leadership and
Values.</TE>
<TE>   The average household income in the county in 2001 was estimated
at $71,800--and nearly $115,000 for those employed in technology or
biotech firms such as Amgen.</TE>
<TE>   But the number of children living in poverty doubled in the 1990s
to more than 35,500, or 16.6% of the total, Damooei said.</TE>
<TE>   "While we're looking into our prosperity, we have to remember that
children are our investment for the future," Damooei said. "They are
the real assets."</TE>
<TE>   And with Latinos making up a third of local residents--and
projected to become the majority of the county population--extra
efforts must be directed at helping them achieve greater academic
performance and motivating more Latino teenagers to pursue college
degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite obvious that those who will be living a comfortable
life in the future will have a higher level of education, more
skills, and be prepared for a far more technologically advanced
workplace," Damooei said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such concerns, the county's economic outlook--especially
in Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Moorpark--continues to be
impressive.</TE>
<TE>   The gross county product--the combined value of goods and
services--is estimated at $45.6 billion for 2002 and should grow to
$61 billion by 2006, according to a report by CLU and the UCSB
Economic Forecast Project.</TE>
<TE>   In the east county alone, the gross regional product should grow
from $16.7 billion this year to $24.6 billion in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Retail sales in the east county are estimated to be $3.2 billion
in 2002 and grow to $4.9 billion in four years. And total jobs in
Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks are projected to grow from 91,344 this
year to 110,704 during the same period.</TE>
<TE>   "It's blessed, that's all you can say," quipped Bill Watkins,
executive director of the UCSB Economic Forecast Project.</TE>

<HD>FAA Crash Report Doesn't Ease Grief</HD>
<DH>Airlines: A finding that a troubled co-pilot downed
EgyptAir Flight 990 does little to help relatives of O.C. victims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON and TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed in 1999, Gail Seidman's mother,
Tobey, was one of those who died.</LD>
<LD>   Seidman was highly skeptical Friday on learning that a federal
report on the crash is expected to say that the disaster was
deliberately caused by a co-pilot.</LD>
<LD>   "My knee-jerk reaction is still that it was terrorism," said
Seidman, 48, a structural engineer who lives in Vallejo. "9/11 only
solidified it for me. But the government will never admit it. They
won't go there."</LD>
<TE>   Seidman's mother, who lived in Irvine, was one of 10 Orange County
residents killed in the crash. Seidman and others who lost loved ones
said knowing the reason for the crash, in which 217 people died,
would not ease their pain.</TE>
<TE>   Eryn Bowman, who lost her mother-in-law, Judith, said she feels
outrage that an EgyptAir supervisor reprimanded co-pilot Gamil El
Batouty hours before the New York-to-Cairo flight.</TE>
<TE>   "That to me was extremely maddening," said Bowman of Huntington
Beach. "To so tactlessly inform him just hours before he was in the
air that it would be his last transatlantic flight--who in their
right mind would do that? "Nothing would increase or decrease the
anger that we felt or still feel," Bowman said. "Whether this was
revenge or suicide, we don't care. What angers us is the
irresponsibility of EgyptAir."</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported Friday that the National Transportation Safety
Board's conclusions, expected to be released in a few days, will
likely say that the jumbo jet was brought down by methodical,
determined acts of a veteran co-pilot.</TE>
<TE>   The latest revelations were no surprise to Arthur Wolk, a
Philadelphia-based attorney who sued EgyptAir on behalf of the
families of five Orange County victims. Two of the surviving families
have settled; the others are pursuing legal action against the
airline.</TE>
<TE>   The theory that the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane Oct.
31, 1999, off the coast of New England has been explored in the
litigation involving the Orange County plaintiffs, Wolk said.
"Whether it was to avenge what he perceived as unfair treatment by
his airline superiors or whether it was to cause the death of the
Americans or Egyptian soldiers on board, one may never know," Wolk
said.</TE>
<TE>   But clearly, he said, the co-pilot caused the crash.</TE>
<TE>   "The flight-data recorder shows he was in the cockpit by himself,"
Wolk said. "If he wasn't promoted to captain, you've got to wonder
why he was left at the controls alone. When the captain returned to
the cockpit and began trying to pull the plane out of the dive, the
co-pilot shut the engines off and worked against the pilot. There is
no way this could have been an accident." Seidman said she believes
what she always believed: that El Batouty, working for terrorists,
crashed the plane to prevent a group of American-trained Egyptian
military officers from returning home.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all political. We need Egypt right now because of the
volatile politics" in the Middle East, she said. "The U.S. will put
its best foot forward to keep them on our side instead of getting to
the truth."</TE>
<TE>   In her lawsuit against EgyptAir, Seidman said she has rejected
settlements that are "way, way, way less" than the $2.7 million the
Federal Aviation Administration has calculated as the monetary value
of a life lost in a plane crash.</TE>
<TE>   She said she only recently began coping with her loss.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been life-altering. My whole way of life was ripped out from
underneath me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Dealing with her pain has made her more empathetic and tolerant,
more aware of the pain of others, she said. "9/11 brought me to my
knees. It brought me to the fetal position."</TE>
<TE>   Bowman said her family hopes the release of the report will bring
some closure.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to keep having these reports come out," Bowman said.
"There's always something we have to read....We can't get on until
all this ends. We're not free to have our memories because something
is continually being thrown in our face."</TE>

<HD>Greuel Edges Past Cardenas to Win 2nd District Election</HD>
<DH>Council: Final tally gives entertainment executive a
242-vote victory in bitter battle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a week after the election, Wendy Greuel declared victory
Friday over Assemblyman Tony Cardenas for the Los Angeles City
Council's 2nd District seat. A final tally showed her winning by 242
votes.</LD>
<LD>   With 29,252 ballots cast, Greuel won 50.41% of the vote to
Cardenas' 49.59%, according to county Registrar-Recorder Conny B.
McCormack, who said Friday's tally includes all of the votes her
office has been able to find.</LD>
<LD>   Greuel, a 40-year-old Van Nuys resident, broke out the champagne
with friends and family members after hearing the results at her
office at the entertainment firm DreamWorks SKG.</LD>
<TE>   "I am ecstatic that I won by 242 votes," she said. "I believe I
was the underdog. I took on a seated incumbent state assemblyman. But
I have been here all along, fighting for the Valley's fair share."</TE>
<TE>   Although the campaign was one of the most bitter battles seen in
local elections in some time, Cardenas (D-Panorama City) called
Greuel on Friday to concede and wish her well.</TE>
<TE>   The two spent a combined $1.7 million on the race for the east San
Fernando Valley seat, with Greuel tapping entertainment industry
leaders to out-raise her opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Although disappointed to lose by a slim margin, Cardenas said he
will not ask for a recount.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a mandate for me and it wasn't a mandate for her, but
she won the election," he said. "She earned the right to represent
the district and I wish her well."</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas, 38, will probably get another chance next year because a
redistricting commission has proposed to split the 2nd District into
two districts, with a new one having a heavy concentration of Latino
voters. If that happens, Cardenas said, he will run.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to serve on the City Council," he said. "If the
redistricting turns out that way, you better believe I will seek to
represent that area."</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said she hopes to take the oath of office soon, although
she may have to wait until the county certifies the results April 2
to officially assume the post.</TE>
<TE>   She already has begun working on top priorities, including
reopening a council field office in the Sunland-Tujunga area.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said she will hold community forums with city managers in
the district.</TE>
<TE>   "It is about making sure the community gets the basic services,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The vote tally released Friday was from a special election held
March 5 to fill a vacancy created when Joel Wachs resigned from the
City Council to head an art foundation in New York City. Wachs had
represented the 2nd District for three decades.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel campaign attorney Stephen Kaufman said a recount would not
be wise because the margin of victory is unlikely to be overcome in a
hand count of ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas said he decided against filing a challenge, even though
five precincts opened late on election day.</TE>
<TE>   "This district has gone long enough without a council person,"
Cardenas said.</TE>
<TE>   "As an assemblyman who represents 40% of the council district, I
look forward to working with Wendy."</TE>
<TE>   Election officials also said Friday that Proposition Q, the
$600-million police bond measure, has extended its support to 66.83%,
just over the two-thirds vote needed for passage, with possibly a few
thousand ballots still to be counted.</TE>

<LD>   With 29,252 ballots cast, Greuel won 50.41% of the vote to
Cardenas' 49.59%, according to county Registrar-Recorder Conny B.
McCormack, who said Friday's tally includes all of the votes her
office has been able to find.</LD>
<LD>   Greuel, a 40-year-old Van Nuys resident, broke out the champagne
with friends and family members after hearing the results at her
office at the entertainment firm DreamWorks SKG.</LD>
<TE>   "I am ecstatic that I won by 242 votes," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe I was the underdog. I took on a seated incumbent state
assemblyman. But I have been here all along, fighting for the
Valley's fair share."</TE>
<TE>   Although the campaign was one of the most bitter battles seen in
local elections in some time, Cardenas (D-Panorama City) called
Greuel on Friday to concede and wish her well.</TE>
<TE>   The two spent a combined $1.7 million on the race for the east San
Fernando Valley seat, with Greuel tapping entertainment industry
leaders to out-raise her opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Although disappointed to lose by a slim margin, Cardenas said he
will not ask for a recount.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a mandate for me and it wasn't a mandate for her, but
she won the election," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "She earned the right to represent the district and I wish her
well."</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas, 38, will probably get another chance next year because a
redistricting commission has proposed to split the 2nd District into
two districts, with a new one having a heavy concentration of Latino
voters. If that happens, Cardenas said, he will run.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to serve on the City Council," he said. "If the
redistricting turns out that way, you better believe I will seek to
represent that area."</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said she hopes to take the oath of office soon, although
she may have to wait until the county certifies the results April 2
to officially assume the post.</TE>
<TE>   She already has begun working on top priorities, including
reopening a council field office in the Sunland-Tujunga area.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said she will hold community forums with city managers in
the district.</TE>
<TE>   "It is about making sure the community gets the basic services,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The vote tally released Friday was from a special election held
March 5 to fill a vacancy created when Joel Wachs resigned from the
City Council to head an art foundation in New York City. Wachs had
represented the 2nd District for three decades.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel campaign attorney Stephen Kaufman said a recount would not
be wise because the margin of victory is unlikely to be overcome in a
hand count of ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas said he decided against filing a challenge, even though
five precincts opened late on election day.</TE>
<TE>   "This district has gone long enough without a council person,"
Cardenas said.</TE>
<TE>   "As an assemblyman who represents 40% of the council district, I
look forward to working with Wendy."</TE>
<TE>   Election officials also said Friday that Proposition Q, the
$600-million police bond measure, has extended its support to 66.83%,
just over the two-thirds vote needed for passage, with possibly a few
thousand ballots still to be counted.</TE>

<HD>Navy Assures Cooperation Over El Toro</HD>
<DH>Development: Spitzer, Silva discuss options in sale of
former Marine base with officials at Washington meeting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two county supervisors were told at a Washington, D.C., meeting that
the Navy will work with Orange County officials to assure that when
the El Toro Marine base property is sold, its future use will be
consistent with Measure W, passed by voters last week.</LD>
<LD>   The county initiative changed what the 4,700-acre base can be used
for, limiting development to a sports complex, museum, university and
housing, among other uses. It prohibits the land from being used as a
commercial airport.</LD>
<LD>   Navy officials affirmed their commitment this week to sell the
land now that Orange County voters have killed the possibility of
putting a commercial airport there.</LD>
<TE>   In an effort to quickly deal with the passage of Measure W,
Supervisors Todd Spitzer and Jim Silva met Wednesday with H.T.
Johnson, assistant secretary of the Navy for installations, and
Duncan Holaday, Johnson's deputy, to discuss the base's future,
Spitzer said Friday. Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) also
attended the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   County Wants Out of Base Maintenance</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said he and Silva told the Navy that the county wants to
stop paying for maintenance at the base and subsidizing activities
there, which costs about $7 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   The county also wants the Navy to honor five-year leases for
existing tenants, including a golf course, horse stables and a
recreational-vehicle storage facility.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy shot a bombshell across our bow" with the announcement
last week that it intended to sell the base, Spitzer said. "The
county can't afford to move slowly."On Tuesday, supervisors will
discuss their El Toro options while the Navy will outline its plan
for disposing of the land on April 23.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Chuck Smith said late Friday that he wants the county
to stop spending money on the former Marine base, including planning
for a park. He rejected Spitzer's suggestion that the county and
Irvine--which borders the retired military base--embark on a
development plan for El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   "We should stop the planning process completely and work with the
Navy to sell the base," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   "I have too many little kids in Santa Ana that need medical care
to waste taxpayer dollars when we could be doing things like free
clinics."</TE>
<TE>   Smith said the base likely will be sold in pieces, depending on
how contaminated the land is and what can be built under the
restrictions of Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   Smith and Supervisor Tom Wilson asked Navy officials on Friday to
give up a chunk of the military land for free by signing a letter on
behalf of Cal State Fullerton, for 300 acres for a satellite campus
at El Toro. The university has a five-year agreement through the
county to build a 90-acre campus there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the right thing to do," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith and Wilson also want to open up 853 units of former base
housing along Irvine Boulevard for affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   Silva was returning from Washington on Friday and couldn't be
reached for comment on the meeting with Johnson and Holaday.</TE>

<HD>Hearing Set for Coach in Sex Case</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A preliminary hearing has been set for a Moorpark High School
wrestling coach accused of having sex with a 14-year-old student.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Paul Fonseca, 23, is scheduled to appear in court again
April 2, when he could change his not guilty plea, said Deputy Dist.
Atty. Tamara Bogosian.</LD>
<LD>   If not, a preliminary hearing will begin April 15.</LD>
<TE>   Fonseca remained in jail Friday in lieu of $50,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, another high school wrestling coach accused of having
sex with students pleaded not guilty Friday to the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Newbury Park High School coach Jeffrey S. Magruder faces five
charges--including unlawful intercourse with a minor and using
alcohol to commit rape--involving three teenage girls at Thousand
Oaks High School.</TE>
<TE>   He has posted $100,000 bail and was released from Ventura County
Jail. Bogosian said additional charges may be filed as investigators
conduct more interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Magruder, who previously coached at Thousand Oaks High School, has
been head wrestling coach at Newbury Park High School for the past
two years. He was arrested on March 8 after Ventura County sheriff's
investigators received a tip from a school employee.</TE>
<TE>   His arrest was the latest in a string of recent sexual allegations
by students against Ventura County teachers or coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Camarillo High School science teacher Chad Wenzlick
Pridgen, 30, was charged with 33 felony and misdemeanor counts for
allegedly trying to seduce and have sexual relations with nine male
students. He is to appear in court Thursday to set a preliminary
hearing date, prosecutors said.</TE>

<LD>A motorist being chased by police was killed early Friday when he
crashed into the center divider of the Orange Freeway in Anaheim and
was struck by several cars as he tried to run across northbound
lanes, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The chase, at up to 90 mph, began late Thursday in the 300 block
of South Lemon Street when police were alerted to a possible auto
theft, said Anaheim Police Sgt. Rick Martinez.</LD>
<LD>   A man driving a Honda Accord with its lights off led police down
Broadway and sped through a red light before turning south onto the
Orange Freeway.</LD>
<TE>   Police said the driver slammed into the center divider near the
Ball Road exit, jumped from the car and bolted across northbound
lanes. Several cars hit him, and he was dragged more than 350 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez said it is unclear why the man fled. The car does not
appear to have been stolen, he said.</TE>

Adams Way, right, a street that got its name in 1999. Adams, the

<DH>Activism: Guerrilla Girls' billboard assails dearth of
awards for female filmmakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Anatomically Correct Oscar. He's white &amp; male, just like the
guys who win!" booms the billboard at the corner of Highland and
Melrose avenues.</LD>
<LD>   In all modesty, that's not quite correct. The pale, pudgy
10-foot-tall man shown standing on a pedestal is depicted
strategically covering himself with his hands by feminists who are
using the billboard to protest perceived bias against women in movie
directing, producing and editing.</LD>
<LD>   The Hollywood billboard was commissioned by Guerrilla Girls, a
17-year-old group that in the past has used drawings of a truly
anatomically correct Oscar in its crusade for more film industry jobs
for women.</LD>
<TE>   Guerrilla Girls may be rebellious. But they're also realistic:
They modestly decline to claim credit for the recent election of
women to head three of the town's top show business unions.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't show a penis on a billboard. You can't have genitalia
in American advertising. It's common knowledge," explained the
Westside artist who calls herself Kathe Kollwitz, who helped acquire
the 50-foot billboard.</TE>
<TE>   And it's common sense that you don't want to do any unseemly
bragging when there appears to be a crack in that glass ceiling you
have been complaining about for so long.</TE>
<TE>   So the group's frontal assault against what it claims is rampant
discrimination in Hollywood is prim and prudent--for now.</TE>
<TE>   "Best Director has never been awarded to a woman," states the
billboard. "94% of the Writing awards have gone to men. Only 3% of
the Acting awards have gone to people of color."</TE>
<TE>   The $4,500 sign was rented for the month by Guerrilla Girls and a
companion protest group that calls itself Alice Locas in recognition
of early moviemaker Alice Guy Blache.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood billboard is being cheered by women. But even in its
G-rated version it is prompting angry e-mails from irate males, said
Kollwitz, who stays anonymous by using the name of early 20th century
German printmaker Kathe Kollwitz for her protest work.</TE>
<TE>   "They basically want to say that the Oscars is a meritocracy. To
them there are no women who deserve to be directors. To us, the low
figure--only two women ever nominated, only 7% of directors being
female--shows either conscious or unconscious discrimination," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The protesters draw their statistics from an annual survey
conducted by San Diego State University communications professor
Martha Lauzen. Her most recent figures suggest that directing jobs
aren't the only thing in short supply for women.</TE>
<TE>   "In the top 100 domestic grossing films of 2000, women were
cinematographers in 2%, writers in 13%, editors on 13%, executive
producers on 17% and producers in 22%," Lauzen said. "Combined, women
comprised 17%" of studios' work force.</TE>
<TE>   "That says that women remain dramatically underrepresented behind
the scenes in the film industry. The percentage has remained stable
for the last three years."</TE>
<TE>   Lauzen said there is "a rather substantial and enduring
misconception in the film community and among the general public that
things have gotten dramatically better."</TE>
<TE>   One reason is that women now fill high-profile positions at some
studios and industry unions.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Screen Actors Guild, the Directors Guild of America
and the Writers Guild of America-West are now all led by women.</TE>
<TE>   In separate elections last weekend, "Valley Girl" director Martha
Coolidge was picked as the first woman president of DGA, and "Little
House on the Prairie" actress Melissa Gilbert was named head of SAG.
Last fall, Victoria Riskin, whose films include "The Member of the
Wedding," was elected first woman president of WGA-West.</TE>
<TE>   None of the three was available for comment Friday. Lauzen
cautioned against expecting the women to shake up filmmaking culture
overnight.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have to be realistic about the ability of one
individual to change an entrenched system of hiring practices," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrilla Girls leaders agree.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it's not window dressing," Kollwitz said of the guilds'
voting. She declined to credit her group's long-running campaign for
influencing the women's election, even though it may have
"contributed to an atmosphere" of change.</TE>
<TE>   To keep up the pressure, protesters are hoping to infiltrate the
March 24 Academy Awards show and paste stickers bearing the drawing
of the earlier, fully "anatomically correct Oscar" in Kodak Theatre
restrooms, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences--who
say they support the feminists' "satire and parody"--said they are
prepared to do some restroom peeling.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be hanging around the ladies' rooms now to see what I can
find," joked academy spokesman John Pavlik.</TE>

<LD>Global climate changes can affect global peace and stability, former
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said Friday at an environmental
conference in Marina del Rey.</LD>
<LD>   "If droughts continue, if climate changes and food sources are
undermined ... we will see social tensions getting worse," he said
through an interpreter.</LD>
<LD>   Gorbachev, president and founder of Green Cross International, was
the closing speaker at "Confronting Climate Change: Averting a Global
Environmental Crisis," a one-day meeting presented by Global Green
USA, Green Cross' U.S. affiliate. Green Cross, founded after the 1992
Earth Summit, has affiliates in 26 nations.</LD>
<TE>   Nowhere are climate problems more evident than in the Middle East,
Gorbachev said.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless something is done to increase the fresh water supply in
[Arab] countries, we could have a crisis of enormous proportions in
that region. That is another reason ... to put an end to what is
happening in the Middle East right now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gorbachev, 71, said the United States should do its part to reduce
emissions and develop sustainable water sources.</TE>
<TE>   Global Green USA leaders agreed that the United States lags behind
other First World nations in addressing climate change.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration is still debating" whether climate change
is occurring, said Walker Wells, a sustainable urban communities
program director. "You see a lot of cities saying, 'We're beyond all
that.'"</TE>

<HD>George Gutekunst, 83; 'Found' Markham Book</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Gutekunst, a former Sausalito restaurateur whose rediscovery
of African bush pilot Beryl Markham's memoir, "West With the Night,"
gave new life to a little-known 1940s literary gem and propelled it
to the top of the bestseller lists, has died. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Gutekunst died March 6 at his home in Sonoma of complications from
a heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   A former merchant seaman, Gutekunst was the garrulous co-owner of
Ondine, a landmark French restaurant across the bay from San
Francisco. The waterfront restaurant, with its spectacular view of
the city skyline and the Golden Gate Bridge, attracted everyone from
plumbers, cowboys and college professors to politicians, sports
figures and Hollywood celebrities.</LD>
<TE>   "Whenever someone interesting came in, whether famous or not, he'd
invite himself to their table, bringing drinks or a souffle, and chat
with them," said Gutekunst's son, Eduardo.</TE>
<TE>   One of his longtime friends was Ernest Hemingway's son, Jack, who
would invite him on fly-fishing trips near Hemingway's home in
Ketchum, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   Gutekunst had always avoided asking Hemingway questions about his
famous father. But on one fishing trip in the early 1980s, he
couldn't resist.</TE>
<TE>   Before he could finish his question, however, Hemingway abruptly
cut him off with, "Why don't you take a look at my father's letters."</TE>
<TE>   Gutekunst did just that, and it was while reading "Ernest
Hemingway's Selected Letters, 1917-1961," that something caught his
eye: A 1942 letter Hemingway had written to his editor, Maxwell
Perkins.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you read Beryl Markham's book, 'West With the Night'?
Hemingway wrote. "I knew her fairly well in Africa and never would
have suspected that she could and would put pen to paper except to
write in her flyer's logbook.... She has written so well, and
marvelously well, that I was completely ashamed of myself as a
writer.... This girl can write rings around all of us who consider
ourselves as writers.... I wish you would get it and read it because
it really is a bloody wonderful book."</TE>
<TE>   Gutekunst couldn't believe what he was reading.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Hemingway, don't get me wrong," he told writer James
Hamilton for a 1987 California magazine profile, "but [he] had been
savaging every writer from Stendahl to James Jones in the worst kind
of macho way, and all of a sudden he praises this unknown book by a
woman. I had to find out why."</TE>
<TE>   Gutekunst tracked down Markham's book in the local library.</TE>
<TE>   "West With the Night," which takes its title from Markham's most
memorable accomplishment--she was the first to fly solo east-to-west
across the Atlantic--poetically chronicles her unconventional life in
Africa up through the historic 1936 flight that made her an
international figure.</TE>
<TE>   Markham's book was critically acclaimed when it was first
published by Houghton Mifflin, but an American reading public
preoccupied by war virtually ignored it and the book went quickly out
of print.</TE>
<TE>   Gutekunst, who read the book in a single sitting, said he was
"astonished at its beauty and richness."</TE>
<TE>   Convinced the book should be reprinted, he passed it on to a
writer friend, Evan S. Connell. Equally impressed, Connell turned it
over to William Turnbull, publisher of North Point Press, then a
small Bay Area publishing house, which agreed to gamble on reprinting
the book.</TE>
<TE>   "West With the Night" was republished in 1983, with an initial
5,000 copies. By mid-1988, 500,000 copies of the book had been sold
and it had spent 79 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list.</TE>
<TE>   Markham's unconventional life struck a chord with modern readers.</TE>
<TE>   Born in England, she moved to Africa at age 4 with her divorced
father, who bought a farm in Kenya. She learned to hunt
boar--barefoot and with a spear--with the Nandi Murani tribe. At 17,
she began training thoroughbred racehorses and, after learning to
fly, she pioneered scouting elephants for hunters from the air.</TE>
<TE>   After her transatlantic flight, she moved to California to work as
an advisor on flying films for Paramount Pictures and, out of boredom
when her third husband went to war, she wrote her book.</TE>
<TE>   After returning to Africa, she trained eight winners of the Kenya
Derby horserace.</TE>
<TE>   "She represented some kind of magical past, something that a woman
did but that can't ever be done again because the world in which that
took place is gone," Gutekunst said in a 1988 interview.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Moberly, Mo., Gutekunst was raised in Salem, Ore., where
he developed his love of reading as a child.</TE>
<TE>   After studying history at Willamette University and graduating
with honors, Gutekunst joined the merchant marine. He sailed for 11
years as a ship's steward and was active in union activities with the
Marine Cooks' and Stewards' Union in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the merchant marine, he worked as a waiter at
various San Francisco restaurants. But the Cold War was raging and
Gutekunst's involvement in radical politics in the 1940s caused him
to lose jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In 1957, using his somewhat meager life savings and money he
raised from friends, Gutekunst opened Ondine.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if he was a card-carrying [Communist] Party member,
but he certainly would have designated himself as a communist for
social reasons," said Eduardo Gutekunst. "He just wanted social
equality."</TE>
<TE>   Gutekunst never made a dime off the Markham renaissance he set in
motion.</TE>
<TE>   But his rediscovery of "West With the Night"--and the ensuing book
royalties--had a dramatic effect on Markham's life.</TE>
<TE>   She had been living in obscurity and near poverty in Kenya,
relying on the generosity of friends to live in a small cottage on
the grounds of the Nairobi Jockey Club.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of her republished memoir soared after the airing of a 1986
PBS documentary on Markham that Gutekunst arranged, raising more than
$100,000 and putting up $20,000 of his own money.</TE>
<TE>   During filming in Nairobi, he finally met the woman whose prose
had impressed him.</TE>
<TE>   When he arrived at Markham's cottage, he found her surrounded by a
few friends and the camera crew.</TE>
<TE>   "She was still quite beautiful, and rather imperious," he said in
1987. "She thanked me for 'finding' her book--that was the word she
used--and she never brought up the matter again, which I thought
showed a lot of class. Instead, she asked me if I drank. I said, 'Of
course!' 'Oh, splendid!' she cried. 'None of these chaps 'round me
here seem to drink. Do let's have some of the chilled vodka.'"</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Markham tripped over one of her dogs and broke a leg. She
died of complications in a Nairobi hospital at age 83.</TE>
<TE>   The man who rediscovered Markham suffered a heart attack three
days after hosting his annual Super Bowl party at his home.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that made his parties special was that he had a unique
ability to assemble people that wouldn't normally find themselves in
the same room," said his son, George.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew people from everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his sons, he is survived by four grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Man Guilty in Slaying of Friend's Parents</HD>
<DH>Crime: But Garden Grove police say they are still
investigating the gruesome 1999 murders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD and STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Mater Dei High School honors student was convicted Friday of
slashing to death his best friend's parents in their home after
spending a wild night of partying with the couple's son and other
graduates of the private school.</LD>
<LD>   Gerald Thomas Johnson, 21, sat silently as the court clerk read
the first- and second-degree murder verdicts, which resolve only part
of the mystery surrounding the slayings of Jose R. Najera and Elena
Castro Najera in Garden Grove two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Police have long suspected that Johnson's friends--including the
couple's son--knew more about the killings than they told
investigators, and the prosecutor could not put forth a clear motive
for the attack.</LD>
<TE>   Behind Johnson in Orange County Superior Court on Friday, the
sister of the slain woman choked back tears and clasped the hand of
her son, Gabriel Gonzalez. When sheriff's deputies grabbed Johnson to
escort him back to a jail cell, Gonzalez rose too.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope you rot in hell!" he shrieked at Johnson, who never looked
back.</TE>
<TE>   The confrontation marked the climax of an emotional three-week
trial in which defense attorneys accused the Najeras' son, Jose Jr.,
of stabbing his parents, then framing his best friend, Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Najera was the first to discover the bloody bodies of his parents
on the morning of Dec. 28, 1999. The couple's son had returned home
after spending the night at Johnson's home partying with fellow
graduates of Mater Dei High School.</TE>
<TE>   The slayings left Najera as the sole heir to his family's home and
$77,000 in cash his parents kept in a safety deposit box.</TE>
<TE>   Police never named Jose Najera Jr. as a suspect but publicly
voiced doubts that he had told them everything he knew about the
night of the murders.</TE>
<TE>   Najera, now 21, was called as a witness in the trial but refused
to answer questions, invoking his 5th Amendment right against
self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, jurors said they hoped police would continue to
investigate the slayings.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such a brutal murder. I wouldn't want to see anybody walk
away from this," juror Ronald Roys, 65, said.</TE>
<TE>   Both victims were stabbed more than 20 times in an attack that
Garden Grove police describe as the most gruesome the city has seen
in 20 years. On Friday, police said they are still on the case.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very happy with the outcome, but it's still unresolved,"
said Sgt. Mike Handfield, who supervised the homicide probe. "We
think that some others were involved in this, and we intend to do
everything we can to find those answers."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the jury of six men and six women was convinced by a
battery of physical evidence that prosecutors used to show that
Johnson was at the murder scene.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators found a bloody ski cap beside the Najeras' bed
containing strands of hair and saliva that were linked to Johnson
through DNA tests. At Johnson's home, police also discovered drops of
blood that matched that of Jose Najera Sr.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such strong, convincing DNA evidence, along with the blood
trail back to the house," Roys said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of
Jose Najera Sr., 42, and second-degree murder in the case of his
wife, 42. Johnson faces a mandatory punishment of life in prison
without parole when he is sentenced May 24.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's verdict brought little relief to relatives of the
Najeras, who said they continue to grieve for the couple, who had
emigrated from Mexico 23 years before their deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "It closes a door, but it doesn't bring them back," said Gonzalez,
who had a close relationship with his uncle. "My mentor is never
coming back. I'm the person I am today because of him. He believed in
me."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Jury Convicts Man in Grisly Double Murder</HD>
<DH>Crime: Former Mater Dei student found guilty in 1999
stabbings of friend's parents. But Garden Grove police are still
investigating.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Mater Dei High School honors student was convicted Friday of
slashing to death his best friend's parents in their home after
spending a wild night of partying with the couple's son and other
graduates of the private school.</LD>
<LD>   Gerald Thomas Johnson, 21, sat silently as the court clerk read
the first- and second-degree murder verdicts, which resolve only part
of the mystery surrounding the slayings of Jose R. Najera and Elena
Castro Najera in Garden Grove two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Police have long suspected that Johnson's friends--including the
couple's son--knew more about the killings than they told
investigators, and the prosecutor could not put forth a clear motive
for the attack.</LD>
<TE>   Behind Johnson in Orange County Superior Court on Friday, the
sister of the slain woman choked back tears and clasped the hand of
her son, Gabriel Gonzalez. When sheriff's deputies grabbed Johnson to
escort him back to a jail cell, Gonzalez rose too.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope you rot in hell!" he shrieked at Johnson, who never looked
back.</TE>
<TE>   The confrontation marked the climax of an emotional three-week
trial in which defense attorneys accused the Najeras' son, Jose Jr.,
of stabbing his parents, then framing his best friend, Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Najera was the first to discover the bloody bodies of his parents
on the morning of Dec. 28, 1999. The couple's son had returned home
after spending the night at Johnson's home partying with fellow
graduates of Mater Dei High School.</TE>
<TE>   The slayings left Najera as the sole heir to his family's home and
$77,000 in cash his parents kept in a safety deposit box.</TE>
<TE>   Police never named Jose Najera Jr. as a suspect but publicly
voiced doubts that he had told them everything he knew about the
night of the murders.</TE>
<TE>   Najera, now 21, was called as a witness in the trial but refused
to answer questions, invoking his 5th Amendment right against
self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, jurors said they hoped police would continue to
investigate the slayings.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such a brutal murder. I wouldn't want to see anybody walk
away from this," juror Ronald Roys, 65, said.</TE>
<TE>   Both victims were stabbed more than 20 times in an attack that
Garden Grove police describe as the most gruesome the city has seen
in 20 years. On Friday, police said they are still on the case.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very happy with the outcome, but it's still unresolved,"
said Sgt. Mike Handfield, who supervised the homicide probe. "We
think that some others were involved in this, and we intend to do
everything we can to find those answers."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the jury of six men and six women was convinced by a
battery of physical evidence that prosecutors used to show that
Johnson was at the murder scene.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators found a bloody ski cap beside the Najeras' bed
containing strands of hair and saliva that were linked to Johnson
through DNA tests. At Johnson's home, police also discovered drops of
blood that matched that of Jose Najera Sr.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such strong, convincing DNA evidence, along with the blood
trail back to the house," Roys said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of
Jose Najera Sr., 42, and second-degree murder in the case of his
wife, 42. Johnson faces a mandatory punishment of life in prison
without parole when he is sentenced May 24.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's verdict brought little relief to relatives of the
Najeras, who said they continue to grieve for the couple.</TE>
<TE>   "It closes a door, but it doesn't bring them back," said Gonzalez,
who was close to his uncle. "My mentor is never coming back. I'm the
person I am today because of him. He believed in me."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Bruce Moore argued that the elder Jose Najera
most likely struggled with his assailant in the middle of the night,
tearing hair from the intruder's head before succumbing to stab
wounds. Najera's wife, Moore told jurors, probably interrupted the
killer a short while later and was herself attacked.</TE>

<HD>Kathryn Dronenburg, 55; Phonics Lessons Advocate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD LEE COLVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kathryn Dronenburg, a teacher who as a member of the California Board
of Education was one of the earliest and most knowledgeable voices
advocating the importance of phonics lessons in learning to read, has
died. She was 55.</LD>
<LD>   Dronenburg, of El Cajon, died at home March 9 after battling
cancer for more than two years.</LD>
<LD>   Dronenburg was appointed in 1990 by Gov. George Deukmejian,
joining the state board soon after the state had imposed the "whole
language" philosophy of reading instruction on the public schools.
Under that approach, children were expected to intuit the structure
of words and to develop a love of reading through repeated exposure
to literature. In the early 1990s the state also engineered a
dramatic shift in math lessons that downplayed the importance of
teacher-led lessons and practice and instead expected children to
work in groups to discover math fundamentals.</LD>
<TE>   Dronenburg, who had taught elementary school for four years before
starting her family, raised questions about both movements.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1990s, evidence was mounting that the teaching of math
and reading had gone awry, and parents and teachers from around the
state began complaining that children were not learning. When those
complaints reached the state board, Dronenburg proved to be an ally,
and over the next several years she would be a patient but forceful
voice who brought grace as well as classroom experience to the
debate.</TE>
<TE>   By the time she left the board last spring, the state had done an
about-face in its approach to math as well as reading. When a new
reading policy that stressed skills as well as literature was passed
in 1996, Dronenburg said she was "thrilled and emotional" about the
action.</TE>
<TE>   "She was one of the first to listen to parents," said Michael
McKeown, a San Diego parent who was an outspoken critic of the
state's "fuzzy math" philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things she had going for her was that she was such a
charming person that she was willing to do the things required but
was never anxious to hurt someone's feelings or be brutal about it."</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Dronenburg, her husband of 35 years, said Dronenburg had
returned to teach first grade in a San Diego school in the fall of
1998 after the couple's youngest daughter went back to college. To
make sure her students got a good grounding in phonics, she bought
her own reading materials.</TE>
<TE>   "We went out and purchased it for her kids because she believed so
strongly in it," he said. "She always loved teaching, that was her
passion."</TE>
<TE>   Dronenburg brought the same passion to the state board. "She put
in the time," he said. "She was always prepared, she would really
study and work so she understood everything, and that's why she was
so successful."</TE>
<TE>   Dronenburg was born in Hayward but moved as a child to San Diego,
where she graduated from Crawford High School. She graduated from San
Diego State University with honors in 1967 and later earned a
certificate as a reading specialist.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her husband, she is survived by three daughters,
Kristen Lee Palenchar of Solano Beach and Amy Mae Dronenburg and
Stephanie Ann Dronenburg, both of El Cajon; two sisters, Anita Graham
of La Jolla and Elizabeth Mustol of La Mesa; and a grandchild, Alexa
Kay Palenchar of El Cajon.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial donations may be made to the PTSA Kathy Dronenburg Fund
for Reading at Juarez Elementary School, 2633 Melbourne Drive, San
Diego, CA 92123.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be at 2 p.m. Sunday at College Avenue Baptist
Church, 4747 College Ave., San Diego.</TE>

<HD>Man Convicted in Couple Swapping</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jury finds him guilty of running a sexual-encounter
business without a permit out of his Van Nuys residence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Van Nuys man who said he invited dozens of couples to his home to
share spouses on weekends was convicted Friday of operating a
sexual-encounter business without a permit.</LD>
<LD>   A jury found John Lynch, 50, guilty on five counts of zoning
violations, which is punishable by a maximum $5,000 in fines and 30
months in jail.</LD>
<LD>   "We just want to make sure it stops," said Michael P. Pizzuti, the
deputy city attorney who prosecuted the case.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm happy that this will allow this neighborhood to regain some
sense of dignity."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Mateljan, Los Angeles city attorney spokesman, said Lynch
was charged with five misdemeanor counts of zoning violations after
undercover police officers attended five parties between September
and December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Pizzuti had argued that couples with an interest in trading
spouses for sex had paid to come to Lynch's residence and spend the
night.</TE>
<TE>   Home Was Listed in Swinger Magazines</TE>
<TE>   Lynch's home, known as "The Velvet Swing," is listed in swinger
magazines. Lynch has told reporters that he has invited as many as 40
couples to his home on Fridays and Saturdays.</TE>
<TE>   Police started investigating after neighbors complained to city
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Under city ordinance, owners of sexual-encounter businesses must
obtain a permit from the city Planning Department, and the businesses
must be at least 500 feet from residential areas, Mateljan said.</TE>
<TE>   Sexual-encounter businesses are legal if owners obtain a permit in
Los Angeles, Pizzuti said.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch and his attorney, Roger Jon Diamond, could not be reached
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Debre Katz Weintraub set
sentencing for Monday.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man accused of breaking into a home he believed belonged to actress
Meg Ryan pleaded no contest to trespassing charges Friday in Malibu
Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   John Michael Hughes, who once falsely told a judge that he and
Ryan were married, faces up to one year in prison when he returns to
court for sentencing next week. Ryan has said she never met Hughes.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-year-old Florida man, who was convicted last year of trying
to enter President Bush's Texas ranch, is not expected to receive any
prison time beyond what he has served since his arrest after the Jan.
6 incident.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Loni Petersen said Friday that she would not
recommend additional jail time if "his mental condition continues to
improve."</TE>
<TE>   Judge Lawrence J. Mira will conduct a sentencing hearing Thursday,
at which time Petersen will offer testimony from a physician about
Hughes' progress.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes was charged with simple and aggravated trespassing for
breaking into the Malibu home of Tomas and Andrea Ryan, who are not
related to the actress.</TE>

<HD>More Contemplate a Monastic Calling</HD>
<DH>Vocations: Once seen as dying out, monasteries are
renovating or expanding their facilities to accommodate a surge in
new members.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the stillness of a balmy spring day, as a breeze floats through
the Joshua trees and a clanging bell summons the men to prayer, the
presence of God is palpable.</LD>
<LD>   At least that is how Brother Vincent Ng justifies leaving his
cushy life in Hong Kong in his 40s for this Catholic monastery in an
isolated swath of Antelope Valley desert.</LD>
<LD>   The most recent newcomer to St. Andrew's Abbey in Valyermo is one
of hundreds of men nationally who have made monasteries their homes
in the last seven years--a resurgence for a religious lifestyle that
conventional wisdom said was dying.</LD>
<TE>   Although the number of incoming parish priests has dropped 7% each
decade since the late 1960s, monasteries, from St. Andrews, 35 miles
east of Palmdale, to South Carolina, have seen such a surge in
interest in the monastic life that they are renovating or expanding
their structures to accommodate new members.</TE>
<TE>   More Vigorous Recruitment Cited</TE>
<TE>   Theology experts attribute the increase to more active recruitment
and to some Catholics' desire for a religious lifestyle they consider
more progressive and spiritually fulfilling than those offered by
other traditional institutions.</TE>
<TE>   "The monastic impulse is loose in the world," said Michael Downey,
theologian for Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, who leads the Archdiocese of
Los Angeles. "The number of people who hear this deeply contemplative
call has skyrocketed."</TE>
<TE>   The expansion at St. Andrew's includes tripling the size of the
abbey's acclaimed ceramics factory, rebuilding its wood-and-rock
chapel and adding rooms to house 50 monks instead of 30.</TE>
<TE>   For other monasteries that had become stagnant, the addition of
just a few new acolytes can mean rebirth and a drive to put a new
face on aging institutions:</TE>
<TE>   * Mepkin Abbey in Moncks Corner, S.C., is in the midst of a
10-year, $8.3-million building program in response to membership
growth and more than 15,000 tourist visits each year. The riverfront
monastery has accepted 11 candidates in the last seven years and
turned around an institution that a decade ago was quietly preparing
to fold.</TE>
<TE>   * Of the 50 monks at Mt. Angel Abbey in St. Benedict, Ore., 11
joined in 2000. The spike in growth, along with a corresponding jump
in enrollment at its seminary, has prompted the abbey to launch a
$25-million capital campaign to renovate the church and college and
build a welcome center in the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   * Prince of Peace Abbey in Oceanside, within a jet's roar of Camp
Pendleton, has four monks joining its current 25 within the next year
and recently finished a set of renovations that included modernizing
the electrical system and rebuilding its housing.</TE>
<TE>   Most monks attribute the interest in monastic life to God's desire
to see them flourish, although some laypeople have more temporal
explanations.</TE>
<TE>   Sheila Briggs, a USC religion professor and expert on theology and
the Catholic Church, said monasteries are attractive because they
provide spiritual companionship and are untouched by some of the
trials that have troubled parish priests, such as the ongoing scandal
over molestation.</TE>
<TE>   "The suspicion that those scandals have caused hasn't affected the
monasteries," Briggs said. "They exist more in the margins, but it's
a fringe that remains part of the institutional church."</TE>
<TE>   The life of a monk--taking vows of celibacy and poverty and making
lifetime commitments to long periods of prayer, scripture reading,
manual labor and contemplative silence--means they can better focus
on a single-hearted pursuit of God than parish priests, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are able to have a broader spiritual experience.... The
whole focus is on discovering your own spirituality, rather than
administration. If what you want to do in your life is help
people--what used to be the parish priest's unique domain--there's
now a whole network of [charitable] organizations out there that
don't require any sort of spiritual commitment," Briggs said.</TE>
<TE>   Monasteries' more aggressive recruitment efforts, such as
vocational retreats, a monastery "matchmaking" service and Web sites
that feature chanting, electronic postcards and virtual tours, have
publicized the lifestyle to people who otherwise might not have
considered monastic communities, said a researcher with the Center
for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown University.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of sitting back and waiting for God to do it, they're
beginning to realize that young people respond to marketing," said
Mary Gautier, senior research associate. "Granted, vocations do come
from the Holy Spirit, but Jesus never said, 'Stand back and let me do
all the work.'"</TE>
<TE>   St. John's Abbey in Collegeville, Minn., the largest U.S.
monastery with 190 men and its own monk-staffed fire department,
holds periodic "Monastic Explorer" weeks and a six-week "Monastic
Experience" summer session. Two to five men have joined the abbey
each year since the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Taking religious recruitment to the next level, a Florida woman
who bills herself as a "monk headhunter" started Vocations Placement
Service, a nonprofit organization that in its four years has sent
about 700 men on retreats to help them decide if the monastic life is
right for them.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty of those people have joined monasteries, and hundreds more
are still trying to figure out what they want, said Natalie Smith, a
former marketing executive who runs the Web site and toll-free
number.</TE>
<TE>   "Each vocation director was operating in a vacuum, and potential
monks were having to do everything on their own--from finding the
right monastery to deciding if they should even become a monk," Smith
said. "We're modernizing the process and taking the mysticism out of
it."</TE>
<TE>   At St. Bernard's Abbey in Cullman, Ala., officials admit that
recruitment efforts were unfocused and inefficient before they began
working with Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not ad men," said Father Francis Reque, vocation director.
"Hooking up with Natalie was really a godsend."</TE>
<TE>   Since starting to work with Smith two years ago, St. Bernard's has
hosted more than 100 men ages 16 to 60, with 10 men scheduled for
this month alone. Seven are now in the process between application
and solemn vows, including a retired Army colonel and a Cuban priest
who came to the United States after raising seven orphans in the
Dominican Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Abbey's Newcomers Are a Diverse Group</TE>
<TE>   The men who have joined the Antelope Valley monastery in the last
few years are just as diverse, including a 26-year-old who dropped
out of UC San Diego when he sensed God's call.</TE>
<TE>   "I encounter different struggles in this lifestyle that are much
more meaningful to me than what I was doing before," said Brother
James Brennan, St. Andrew's youngest monk, who said "a great sense of
peace" overwhelmed him the first time he came to the monastery.</TE>
<TE>   He is an earnest man with an easy grin, and his dark hair flops
across his face when he jumps up to serve clam chowder during the
midday meal. "Even the normal stuff takes on a new purpose when
you're living a life dedicated to your ideals," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brennan and other new monks must spend a year of observation at a
monastery before they are allowed to join, a period that another new
monk said was fulfilling rather than frustrating.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe God is very patient," said Brother Lazarus Tumath, 52,
a former Bay Area accountant who joined St. Andrew's last year. "If
you have a true calling, the feeling that this is your home is never
going to leave you. It just makes you more sure that you're
surrounded by people who are on the same spiritual page as you."</TE>
<TE>   That communal nature will be emphasized in St. Andrew's renovated
monastery, with a refurbished chapel able to hold 200, instead of the
current 70.</TE>
<TE>   The new buildings will be positioned so that guests at the
2,000-acre property will first be greeted with a welcome center that
will house the gift ship and bookstore, currently located in an old
apple cellar.</TE>
<TE>   New monk Ng, 46, said he had been running a lucrative electronics
export business before coming to St. Andrew's last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I wish this vocation didn't come to me," he said as he
watched a foursome of ducks paddling through the pond in the
monastery's tea garden. "I was more comfortable with what I was doing
before. But it's my calling, and I can't ignore it."</TE>

<HD>Davis Delays Ban of MTBE</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH and DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis announced Friday a one-year delay on banning the
pollutant MTBE from the state's gasoline supplies, explaining that he
wants to avoid price hikes and shortages as the state moves to use
ethanol as a substitute.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement was met with sharp criticism from municipal water
officials and environmentalists who noted that a study directed by
the state continues to find MTBE, a possible carcinogen, leaking into
ground water.</LD>
<LD>   The ban, which Davis called for in 1999, was originally intended
to take effect at the end of this year. MTBE, or methyl tertiary
butyl ether, has been widely detected in drinking water wells across
the state after leaking from underground gas tanks. Leaks have
persisted even after the installation of new, reinforced tanks.</LD>
<TE>   The use of MTBE, an oxygenate that reduces air pollution while
boosting engine power, became widespread in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in Redondo Beach, Davis said that the state's gasoline
will be MTBE-free by January 2004. He said the delay will allow a
more orderly transition and protect California drivers from paying as
much as $3 a gallon at the pump, as one consultant had predicted.</TE>
<TE>   "You elected me to prevent harm to California," Davis told elected
officials and South Bay residents gathered outside the new Redondo
Information Tech Center.</TE>
<TE>   He warned that a hasty transition could make the state hostage to
"another out-of-state energy cartel." He was referring to Midwestern
producers of ethanol, the most commonly available oxygenate that can
be substituted for MTBE. The federal Clean Air Act requires the use
of oxygenates in gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   The governor said he wanted to avoid a "second energy crisis," a
reference to the dramatic spike in electricity prices last year
following the state's deregulation of energy.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen this movie before, and I am not going to allow
Californians to be held hostage by another energy cartel," Davis
said.</TE>
<TE>   He also blamed the delay on the Bush administration and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency for its denial last summer of
California's request for a waiver of the federal mandate that an
oxygenate--such as MTBE or ethanol--must be added to the state's
gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   He said he has spoken to President Bush directly and is not
optimistic that the administration will change its mind.</TE>
<TE>   The delay sparked anger among water providers and officials whose
water supplies have been contaminated.</TE>
<TE>   Cities Worry About Their Water Supplies</TE>
<TE>   "A one-year delay from the broader perspective may not seem like a
big deal, but it will be a big deal for any of those communities who
have to shut down their wells from MTBE," said Craig Perkins,
director of public works management for Santa Monica, where seven of
the city's 11 wells were shut down because of MTBE contamination.
"It's a very big deal for us."</TE>
<TE>   William Mills, general manager of the Orange County Water
District, expressed a similar view.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed. We would like to see [the ban] occur on
schedule," Mills said. "The sooner we get the additive out of our
gasoline, the less threat posed by this chemical to our water
supplies."</TE>
<TE>   Marguerite Young, the California director of the environmental
group Clean Water Action, said she was sympathetic to the position
that Davis was placed in but disagreed with his decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he was faced with a Solomon-type decision, and we clearly
wish that he had found it possible to stick with" the original
deadline, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento lobbyist V. John White, who represents the Sierra Club,
said Davis' decision to delay the ban "is not a positive." But White
and some other environmentalists believe Davis can repair the damage
by earmarking money for a cleanup of MTBE. Two bills are pending in
the Legislature that would raise fees on oil companies and generate
$200 million a year, much of which would be used to clean up MTBE.</TE>
<TE>   Upcoming Election Casts Shadow Over Decision</TE>
<TE>   In announcing the delay, Davis vowed to guard water supplies but
did not elaborate, saying that more information would be available
next week.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' decision to put off the ban reflects an election year
gamble that it is more risky to cause a big run-up in gas prices than
to provoke the ire of environmentalists, municipal water officials
and residents of communities with tainted water supplies.</TE>
<TE>   "If the question is, 'Could Gray Davis afford to have a shortage
of gasoline?' the answer is, 'No governor could,'" said Democratic
consultant Darry Sragow.</TE>
<TE>   "Californians take certain things for granted. One is getting
where we want in cars. No one in public office is going to want to
mess with that," he added. "Californians desperately want clean air,
but not at the expense of having to wait in long lines to get
gasoline."</TE>
<TE>   If Davis had not delayed the ban, there was at least a chance of a
price spike by November, noted Winston Hickox, the head of the
California Environmental Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Hickox said that oil companies generally change their fuel
mixtures on Nov. 1. If ethanol had not been available, he said,
"there could have been a price consequence."</TE>
<TE>   More likely, Hickox said, the price spike would have occurred
early next year. The state estimates that it would consume as much as
900 million gallons of ethanol a year, or roughly half the ethanol
now produced in the nation. Given the demand, the governor feared it
could have left the state subject to price manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Fears of Manipulation by Ethanol Makers</TE>
<TE>   But unlike the electricity crisis of last year, when Los Angeles
and other areas served by municipal power authorities were spared,
the entire state could suffer in an ethanol shortage.</TE>
<TE>   "Our view is there is one major company [that] controls a huge
segment [of the ethanol market], and the top seven companies control
70%," Hickox said. "The profile of that causes the governor concern."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' action comes as Congress continues to debate energy
legislation. The Senate legislation requires that ethanol be added to
gasoline nationally by 2004, with levels rising to 5 billion gallons
by 2012. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) plans to seek a delay in
the requirement for California.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics questioned why Davis would delay the ban despite the
fact that an ongoing six-county study by an agency overseen by the
State Water Resources Control Board has shown that MTBE continues to
leak.</TE>
<TE>   The study, ordered by the Legislature, is being conducted in
Sacramento, Yolo, San Diego, Riverside, Humboldt and Mendocino
counties.</TE>
<TE>   The board of the California Groundwater Resources Assn. wrote the
governor last week to urge him to not delay the ban. In its letter,
the board said the California Energy Commission was supposed to
develop a timetable to remove MTBE from gasoline no later than the
end of this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the CEC has failed to live up to its responsibility not
only to you as Governor but also to all Californians," wrote the
board, which represents hydrologists and other water professionals in
the state.</TE>

<HD>Writing on Wall for Mural Program</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A mural inspired by North Hollywood community members and unveiled
Friday will be one of the last funded by the Los Angeles Cultural
Affairs Department, marking an end to the Great Wall Unlimited
Neighborhood Pride Program.</LD>
<LD>   The 8-foot-by-13-foot mural, painted by Chicano artist David
Zamora Casas, covers a wall outside the Valley Recreation Center's
swimming pool building. It's one of 15 that the Social and Public Art
Resource Center has commissioned for each of the City Council's
districts.</LD>
<LD>   "We're joyful for the celebration, but we're also sad because it's
the end of an era of these kinds of murals," said the center's
founder, Judith Baca.</LD>
<TE>   The Neighborhood Pride Program began in 1988, creating 105 murals
from Watts to Chatsworth, in an effort to give community members a
voice in the artwork in their environment. "This program is really
important because it's grass-roots," Baca said. "Pieces are made out
of a relationship between the community and the artist."</TE>
<TE>   The city, which provided $189,000 for the 15 murals, decided to
stop financing the program in order to focus on conserving and
restoring existing murals, said Pat Gomez, city art collections and
murals manager for the Cultural Affairs Department.</TE>
<TE>   The program is also meant to help fledgling artists get noticed.
This is Casas' first mural.</TE>
<TE>   Casas, who is from San Antonio, moved to North Hollywood in July
to begin gathering input from residents.</TE>
<TE>   "The community wanted me to do something with sports," Casas said.
"That's why I chose spheres--to represent circles and cycles."</TE>
<TE>   Three local students assisted the artist. "It's about peace and
love and to respect other people," said 11-year-old Milton Reynoso,
one of the helpers.</TE>
<TE>   Made up of a series of 10 circles, the mural depicts such themes
as birth, death, war and maternity, Casas said.</TE>
<TE>   He said a colorful pinata painted in the upper-right corner
symbolizes "life filled with sweets and surprises, but sometimes
destined to be smashed."</TE>

<LD>The head of the FBI's San Francisco office for the last four years
has been appointed to the bureau's No. 2 position in Washington--and
has been serving as acting director in recent days while his boss
travels in Asia.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce J. Gebhardt, named executive assistant FBI director for
criminal investigations and cyber crime on Feb. 27, will serve as
acting director of the FBI whenever Director Robert Mueller is out of
the country.</LD>
<LD>   Mueller was named U.S. attorney in San Francisco in 1999 and
served in that position for two years, working with Gebhardt on major
criminal investigations in Northern California.</LD>
<TE>   FBI agents said Gebhardt's promotion gives Mueller, who took over
the top job seven months ago, a trusted right-hand man as he carries
out a promised FBI management overhaul while helping to lead the war
on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Mueller admired Bruce when they were both in San Francisco and
working some major fraud cases together," said Andy Black, FBI
spokesman in San Francisco. "He's getting a guy he knows he can trust
to use common sense and make sound decisions during a very critical
time."</TE>
<TE>   Gebhardt, 54, has been an FBI agent for 27 years, many of those in
California between assignments in Washington. In 1978, he was
assigned to an organized crime squad in San Francisco, later
supervised drug investigations in Los Angeles, and helped lead the
Unabomber task force set up in San Francisco in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked with Bruce as a street agent in L.A. and as a personal
friend before he became the special agent in charge up there," said
retired agent John Hoos, a former spokesman for the FBI's Los Angeles
office.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a street agent's SAC," Hoos said. "He fights for his
troops. He never forgot where he came from.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a hard-charger," Hoos added. "He gave it 125% on the streets
every day."</TE>
<TE>   In announcing the promotion, Mueller said he is confident that
Gebhardt will keep the FBI "on the cutting edge" of criminal and
cyber crime investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller, 56, is out of the country for talks with Asian law
enforcement and government officials about the war on terrorism. His
trip includes stops or possible stops in Malaysia, Singapore,
Indonesia and the Philippines before an expected return next week.</TE>
<TE>   "I look forward to serving as Director Mueller's executive
assistant director for criminal and cyber crimes," Gebhardt said in a
statement Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is an unprecedented and critically important period in the
FBI's history, as we reorganize and retool to address the multiple
challenges in the criminal and terrorism areas."</TE>

<HD>Nixon Rift Much More Than a Sister Act</HD>
<DH>Politics: The flap over a multimillion-dollar bequest is
part of a power grab by library executives, a foundation board member
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE, PHIL WILLON and STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a simmering controversy over the stewardship of the Richard M.
Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace, advocates for the former president's
feuding daughters sought to frame the dispute Friday in sharply
different terms--and to lay some of the bad blood to backroom
politicking within the Nixon Foundation itself.</LD>
<LD>   One board member said Friday that legal challenges over a
multimillion-dollar bequest to the foundation are part of a power
grab by library executives and an attempt to bypass the foundation's
24-member board of directors.</LD>
<LD>   The board member, former Nixon aide Ken Khachigian, said several
board members opposed taking legal action over the bequest by Nixon
chum Bebe Rebozo, but were overruled by the foundation's executive
committee.</LD>
<TE>   Those lawsuits have pushed what was a private dispute between
Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower into courtrooms in Orange
County and Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got a couple folks who are employed by the foundation who
are trying to accumulate more power," Khachigian said. "A minimum of
three of us felt this action should not be taken. The full board was
not consulted, and I think it should have been. I think this is
inappropriate and unfortunate."</TE>
<TE>   While the roots of the dispute grow from a philosophical
difference between the sisters over how to preserve their father's
legacy, other personality conflicts brew. Cox has been adamant about
maintaining control over the Rebozo bequest because, according to a
source familiar with foundation affairs, Rebozo once told her that he
did not want his money in the hands of library executive director
John H. Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   Rebozo's will specifies that Cox, Eisenhower and Robert H.
Abplanalp must determine how the foundation spends the bequest.</TE>
<TE>   The source added that the sisters' estrangement was fueled by
Taylor and Dimitri K. Simes, president of the Nixon</TE>
<TE>   Center in Washington, D.C., which is also supported by the
foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "Taylor and Simes have worked very hard to separate the two," he
said. "That's part of their controlling the library, and there came a
point when they succeeded. They want control, total control. That's
what's going on here."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor dismissed that analysis as the fruits of bitterness over a
1997 reorganization of the foundation board in which he sided with
Eisenhower in establishing a 24-member independent body rather than a
family-controlled committee.</TE>
<TE>   Letters written in February by Cox and Eisenhower--both board
members--paint the dispute in stark and challenging terms.</TE>
<TE>   "It is sad that my father's library has been used to create a
public controversy about the Nixon family, which only harms my
father's legacy," Cox wrote to the board, condemning the lawsuits as
"senseless," "unwise and meritless."</TE>
<TE>   She wrote, "I am deeply concerned that Bebe's wishes and will be
faithfully implemented....My father would expect no less."</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower was equally direct a day later in a reply to fellow
board member Abplanalp.</TE>
<TE>   "It pains me to have a dispute with you and Tricia, but my
father's legacy is at stake," Eisenhower wrote.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is a bequest that could be worth as much as $20
million--rather than the $12-million estimate provided earlier to The
Times. Part of the problem in sizing the bequest is that much of it
is in real estate holdings whose values cannot be readily determined,
said Nicholas Christin, a Miami lawyer representing the Rebozo trust.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the Rebozo will, the Nixon Foundation would receive
65% of the estate, which could be worth $30 million.</TE>
<TE>   Christin said the lawsuits surprised him.</TE>
<TE>   "These were minor differences. I thought we were at the 5-yard
line, ready to go in for a touchdown," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Rebozo trust believes that the Nixon sisters and
Abplanalp must decide how the money is spent.</TE>
<TE>   In the court filings, attorneys for the library foundation
questioned nearly $1 million paid to three Rebozo trustees from the
estate. Christin, though, said there was nothing untoward about the
payments, and that the bulk of the estate would have been released to
the foundation long ago if the Nixon sisters and Abplanalp could
agree on how the money would be managed.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd be happy to distribute when we get the instructions,"
Christin said. "The trustees always expected these people would work
out agreements."</TE>
<TE>   Christin noted that the lawsuits could erode the estate with legal
bills.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody would be far better off without litigation,"
Christin said. "It certainly doesn't reduce costs that they chose to
file litigation in Florida and California."</TE>
<TE>   Although the current dispute revolves around Rebozo's money, the
sisters' falling out dates back to the months after Nixon's death,
when differences over how to preserve Nixon's legacy first surfaced.
The Rebozo controversy isn't the first time that split has rocked the
foundation.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the foundation halted a project to establish an institute
at the library named after the late Nixon advisor Elmer Bobst when
letters and phone messages surfaced containing anti-Semitic comments
by Bobst.</TE>
<TE>   The Nixon Foundation was divided over the issue. Some of those
involved, including Cox's husband Edward Cox, wanted to keep the
letters quiet--and keep the money, said Taylor. But the board agreed
to turn back a $6-million grant from the Elmer and Mamdouha Bobst
Foundation, including $850,000 of $1.5 million it had already
accepted. The rest had been spent on plans for the institute. On
Friday, one partisan in the current dispute said that the Nixon
Foundation still has not returned the money, which Taylor
acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always been a strong feeling that the Bobst Foundation
ought to have some funds returned to it," he said. "We have members
of our board who believe it should be returned. We have members of
our board who feel there should be a halfway-point meeting."</TE>
<TE>   While the drama unfolds behind the scenes, there was little talk
of the controversy Friday in Yorba Linda, where the library is based
and where Nixon and his wife, Pat Nixon, are buried.</TE>
<TE>   But as word spread among library visitors who hold the Nixon
family in high regard, the reigning emotions were surprise and
consternation.</TE>
<TE>   "You always hate to see siblings crossed up over
anything--especially over money," said the Rev. Sewell Hall of
Atlanta, in town to deliver a series of sermons at the Tustin Church
of Christ.</TE>
<TE>   For some, the falling out spoke of a failure in a family that
remained solid--at least on the outside--through the turmoil of the
Watergate era and the president's resignation from office.</TE>
<TE>   "That is very discouraging--I hate to hear that," said Jo Ella
Evans, in town for two weeks from Monroe, Ind. "I always thought they
were pretty united. They would have had to be to have gone through
everything they went through. I wish it wouldn't be like that."</TE>
<TE>   Carl Sferrazza Anthony, a Los Angeles-based historian specializing
in first ladies, said the Nixon sisters were extremely close as
children and that seemed to evolve into a close adult relationship as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower's 1986 book about their mother, "Pat Nixon: The Untold
Story," included warm references to Cox and detailed how the two
women sought to shore up their father during the dark days of
Watergate. Eisenhower also quoted liberally from Tricia's diary.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd have to be close for Tricia to open her diary," Anthony
said.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony said that Cox is more "politically savvy" than Eisenhower
and quicker to take umbrage over attacks on their father's legacy,
even though she has avoided public appearances. Eisenhower,
meanwhile, has been a well-regarded ambassador for the Nixon Library,
remaining loyal to her father, even as she's maintained the
open-minded perspective of a historian, Anthony said.</TE>
<TE>   "She's not a ferocious, sink-or-swim person. She's a very fair,
judicious person," Anthony said. "It's really impossible for me to
imagine Julie ever doing something as rash as instituting a lawsuit."</TE>

<LD>A baby sitter was arrested Friday after a 6-month-old boy in her care
suffered a fractured skull, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Martha Morales, 28, was being held at Orange County Jail on
suspicion of felony child abuse.</LD>
<LD>   "There was possible blunt force trauma severely to the head," said
Jim Amormino, Orange County sheriff's spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   The boy's parents took him to Morales' home on Via Santa Maria
before they went to work Thursday morning, Amormino said. When
Morales' husband came home, he found Morales giving CPR to the baby
and called 911, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The infant was in critical condition Friday at Mission Hospital
Regional Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still investigating what happened, but the baby was in
perfectly good health when he was dropped off," Amormino said.</TE>

<LD>The always exciting police blotter of the Seal Beach Sun reported
that "a male and female were seen in their car behind a business and
thought to be snorting cocaine."</LD>
<LD>   But, the item said, "police checked the scene and the two subjects
were just eating Japanese food with chopsticks."</LD>
<LD>   Hope the false alarm didn't cause the two diners to lose their
tempuras.</LD>
<TE>   Another one you won't see on "Cops": The Sun also carried a
complaint from a resident who "had been at a bar the previous night
and had seen a video game there that shows a nude female when someone
wins."</TE>
<TE>   At a Seal Beach bar? Shocking.</TE>

are "doing well and send him money. They live in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Replies the investigator: "Well ... I hope they wind up someplace

<TE>   Needless to say, the investigator grew up in the east Boston area.</TE>
<TE>   Suburban Insult of the Day: I made the mistake of saying that
Reseda had been ignored by the cultural world and promptly heard
about two songs that mention the Valley community (not favorably):
"Free Fallin'" by Tom Petty and "Screenwriter's Blues" by Soul
Coughing.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Elliot Zwiebach has contributed a third: "Errol Flynn" by
Amanda McBroom.</TE>
<TE>   Zwiebach says it's "about a child recalling her late father, an
actor always billed several names below Flynn," who was a carouser a
la Flynn and walked out of her life when she was very young.</TE>
<TE>   Zwiebach sets the scene with this verse:</TE>

Banning in the mood to write a limerick--an L.A. type of limerick:</TE>
<TE>   A commuter exceedingly wise</TE>
<TE>   Moved away from his home in Van Nuys.</TE>

<TE>   It's the 405 I despise."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: One of artist Sandra Beebe's works on display in Long

nightmarish because it's a close-up of two parking meters, one with

<LD>Down slope from the whooshing freeway traffic in Long Beach lie eight
peaceful acres of lemon grass, cabbage, fava beans and citrus--and a
community within a community that has been tending the garden for a
generation.</LD>
<LD>   From Hmong immigrants to affluent gay lawyers and settled seniors,
301 amateur gardeners have been feeding themselves and the needy with
their bounty from the Long Beach Community Garden.</LD>
<LD>   "We range from people on welfare to millionaires, from black,
white, Asian, Latino, Hmong, and from every part of the United
States," said Lonnie Brundage, president of the nonprofit garden's
board.</LD>
<TE>   "And they all come together to garden, a minimum of once a week,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach group has the largest membership of any community
garden in the western United States and the third largest in the
country, according to the American Community Gardening Assn. Only two
larger community gardens exist, one in Dayton, Ohio, the other in
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Collectively, the Long Beach gardeners each year produce and
donate a whopping 100,000 pounds of fresh fruit and vegetables to
local charities, from shelters for homeless and battered women to
those serving AIDS patients.</TE>
<TE>   From the garden, tucked in a pocket between the 605 Freeway and El
Dorado Nature Center Park on Spring Street, the garden food bank
committee makes daily deliveries of freshly picked produce to 10
groups.</TE>
<TE>   One of the recipients is the Santa Maria House, which delivers hot
meals to homebound AIDS patients through its Helping Hands program,
and to poor women recovering from breast cancer through its new Her
House program.</TE>
<TE>   "We serve low-income women, many of them with children, many of
whom don't have insurance, so their income has dropped to pay for
medical costs," said Nancy Lamons, chief executive of Santa Maria
House Corp. in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "We have women who are living without pain medication while going
through cancer treatment. People just don't realize they are out
there," she said of the population the program serves.</TE>
<TE>   Most food banks donate canned or nonperishable foods, but the
community gardeners supply ailing people with what often is the only
fresh produce they get.</TE>
<TE>   "That is so important to us," Lamons added. "They really do help
us a lot; we are very grateful for them."</TE>
<TE>   This time of year, the bounty may be cabbage, carrots, artichokes,
beets, lettuce, lemon grass, mustard greens, beans or leeks--produce
that will have been picked that morning by gardeners who pluck what
they can't use from their 20-by-30-foot plots.</TE>
<TE>   The garden boasts an orchard of citrus and stone fruit trees that
are maintained by a grove master. Its picked fruit is put out under a
gazebo, where member gardeners can have a share.</TE>
<TE>   Although the community garden is 26 years old, many of Long
Beach's 461,000 residents don't know it exists. Until a few years
ago, it was located at what is now the Town Centre shopping area, on
Carson Street.</TE>
<TE>   Gardeners must be able to demonstrate, through utility bills and a
driver's license, that they are Long Beach residents. Applicants
typically are on a waiting list for several months before a plot
opens up.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Dayak, 72, lucked out.</TE>
<TE>   "When I retired in 1989, the first thing I did was get a garden
plot. I got right in," said Dayak, sporting a straw hat and relaxed
grin. "This is the best therapy there is--this and golf. The
camaraderie out here is outstanding."</TE>
<TE>   Brundage and her husband, who are also retired, moved to Long
Beach to be near their daughter. Brundage was recovering from heart
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "It was only about two months after that, and I wasn't fully
recovered, when I started my garden here," she said. "My only regret
about moving here was that I didn't have any room for a garden," said
Brundage, who grew up on a Florida citrus farm.</TE>
<TE>   The community garden was started on what had long been an inmate
honor farm that supplied the Long Beach City Jail. It was shut down
after an inmate sued, charging that the farm work was forced labor,
said Ernie Trait, 76, who started cultivating his plot just two
months after the garden opened in May 1976.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm probably the only one around that was around in the
beginning," Trait said. Back in the early days, he recalled, people
gardened to the accompaniment of live music from parties held at an
adjacent park.</TE>
<TE>   There are a fair number of older gardeners, Brundage said, gazing
out over the plots on a warm Sunday morning. "A lot of people out
here have had heart replacement, hip replacement, knee replacement,
strokes."</TE>
<TE>   As she walked around the garden, Brundage visited with different
people, offering recipes for this or that crop. She knows who is in
the hospital and can't make it out to water, and who just lost their
job. She is the community's mother hen.</TE>
<TE>   Most communities require some governance to maintain order, and
the garden is no different. The orchard and other common areas
require upkeep from periodic work parties, at which everybody pitches
in. Members divvy up the chores through committees.</TE>
<TE>   There have only been a few problem cases, including a man who
chug-a-lugged a case of beer, then scared everyone as his car
screeched past them in the parking lot. He got the boot.</TE>
<TE>   More often, it is a breach of gardening manners--unintended though
it may be--that gets someone ousted.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually the rules are about things that affect other gardeners,"
Brundage said. "If you have weeds, those can grow into another
garden, or the seeds can blow there. Also, we have a little bit of
theft. If someone stole from someone else's garden, or is caught
drinking, they'd be asked to leave. Some people," she added, simply
"lose their garden for not gardening."</TE>
<TE>   For most who spend time here, however, working in such a
cosmopolitan setting offers a rich blend of culture and horticulture.</TE>
<TE>   People tend their plants in different ways. The Hmong, for
example, pick lettuce leaves without removing the whole lettuce head,
Brundage said.</TE>
<TE>   But one Hmong gardener has watched those around him, and lately
he's been adopting some of their techniques, from the garden layout
to mulching.</TE>
<TE>   People interested in the garden can find out more by calling
Lonnie Brundage at (562) 597-0926.</TE>

<HD>Jean-Paul Riopelle, 78; Canadian Abstract Expressionist
Painter</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jean-Paul Riopelle, 78, an Abstract Expressionist painter and
sculptor who was the first Canadian to have a painting sell for more
than $1 million, died Tuesday at his home on Ile-aux-Grues on the St.
Lawrence River east of Quebec City. The cause of death was not
disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Montreal, the only son of an architect, Riopelle began
painting at age 8. He later studied engineering at Montreal
Polytechnique but switched to the serious study of art in the early
1940s.</LD>
<LD>   Riopelle served as a fighter pilot near the end of World War II,
and after the war moved to France, where he built an international
reputation in the 1950s and mingled with the intellectual celebrities
of the era.</LD>
<TE>   He was a member of the informal group of expatriate artists known
as the Ecole de Paris or School of Paris, which included Marc
Chagall, according to the Artcyclopedia Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Riopelle's works were exhibited around the world. In 1989, one of
his paintings sold for $1.4 million at a New York auction. It was the
largest amount paid for a Canadian painting at the time and the first
to exceed $1 million, according to media reports.</TE>

<HD>Sir Raymond Firth, 100; Anthropologist Who Studied Pacific
Cultures</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sir Raymond Firth, 100, a social anthropologist known for his studies
of Pacific cultures, died Feb. 22 in London, the London School of
Economics announced this week.</LD>
<LD>   The New Zealand-born anthropologist was most famous for his
studies of the Tikopia people in the British Solomon Islands. His
1936 book, "We the Tikopia," a study of the social organization of
the 1,200 islanders, was followed by nine more books on the Tikopia.</LD>
<LD>   "He is their prime ethnographer and the historian young Tikopians
read to find out who their pagan grandparents were and how they
lived," professor Peter Loizos of the London School of Economics
wrote last year on Firth's 100th birthday.</LD>
<TE>   Educated at Auckland University College, Firth went to London in
1924 to study for his doctorate. He focused on the economics of New
Zealand's Maoris.</TE>
<TE>   Firth lectured briefly at the University of Sydney before
returning to the London School of Economics as a lecturer. He was
named head of the university's school of anthropology in 1938. Firth
became a professor at the University of London in 1944 and took
emeritus status after his retirement in 1968. He was knighted in
1973.</TE>

<LD>Gilmore Schjeldahl, 89, an electronics and plastics pioneer whose
inventions changed many industries and made an early contribution to
the U.S. space program, died Sunday at his home in Lenox, Mass.</LD>
<LD>   Schjeldahl founded five businesses in Minnesota, of which the
best-known is Sheldahl, which was named G.T. Schjeldahl Co. when he
started it in 1955. Its first major success was a bag-making machine
developed for Continental Can Co. That led to his experimentation
with the flexible polymer Mylar, which he used to make high-altitude
research balloons and air-supported buildings.</LD>
<LD>   In 1960, his company built Echo I, a 100-foot-diameter balloon
satellite sent into orbit by NASA. It was then the largest object
ever fired into space, and its success bolstered NASA's reputation
and advanced coast-to-coast communications in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Schjeldahl, a North Dakota native, held 16 patents, including one
for a lamination technique that produced Northwest Airlines' first
plastic-lined airsickness bag.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elizabeth Boyden Howes, 94, a pioneer in the integration of
psychology and religion who founded retreat centers in California,
died of natural causes March 6 at her home in Berkeley.</LD>
<LD>   Howes was an analyst in the Jungian tradition who studied early in
her career with New Testament scholar Henry Burton Sharman and
psychologist Fritz Kunkel. Her studies led to a lifelong interest in
combining the wisdom of Gospel texts with the insights of psychology,
especially those found in the work of C.G. Jung, with whom she later
studied.</LD>
<LD>   With Kunkel, Howes founded the Pines, a retreat center near
Yucaipa. In 1955, she founded, with colleagues Sheila Moon and Luella
Sibbald, the Guild for Psychological Studies in San Francisco; and
Four Springs, a 300-acre retreat near Middletown, about 85 miles
north of San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   Howes' published works include "Jesus; Answer to God, Intersection
and Beyond" and "The Choicemaker," co-authored with Moon. She also
was a co-editor of "The Choice is Always Ours: An Anthology of the
Religious Way," which was published for 50 years.</TE>

<HD>Board Says It Was Misled on Contract</HD>
<DH>L.A. Unified: Trustees may rescind approval of an adult
literacy plan produced by a firm based in the office of Sen.
Polanco's friend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying they were misled about the location and expertise of a firm
offering an adult literacy program, members of the Los Angeles Board
of Education say they may overturn their decision earlier this week
to buy it for $6.3 million.</LD>
<LD>   District leaders said they believed they were giving the project
to Reality Based Learning of Redmond, Wash., when they awarded the
money to a tiny California start-up with a similar name.</LD>
<LD>   Pressure to drop the program grew Friday as school trustees
learned that the contracted firm, RBL California, is based in the law
office of J. Arnoldo Beltran, a close friend of state Sen. Majority
Leader Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) and that Beltran is a
registered agent for the firm.</LD>
<TE>   Polanco had lobbied the board for the contract for about a year
and argued aggressively for it at Tuesday's meeting, angering Supt.
Roy Romer, who opposed the contract.</TE>
<TE>   According to a 1999 investigation by The Times, Polanco allegedly
steered city attorney contracts in small municipalities around Los
Angeles County to Beltran's law firm.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the four school trustees who approved the project in a
4-3 vote during Tuesday's board meeting said they were inclined to
reconsider their vote at next week's meeting. The fourth, Julie
Korenstein, did not return phone calls Friday seeking comment. Only
one board member would have to change a vote for the project to be
quashed.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the board said some members may have approved the
measure to curry favor with Polanco, whose influence is important in
many of Los Angeles' heavily Latino communities and in the current
redrawing of board members' district boundaries. Board members who
supported the measure said they did so on the program's merits.</TE>
<TE>   Romer has also vowed to block the deal. He said he was outraged to
learn that Reality Based Learning California has no finished product
and only three employees</TE>
<TE>   "I do not intend to let this district be victimized," he said. "I
know all my options, and I'm not about to let this happen."</TE>
<TE>   Polanco did not return calls Friday seeking comment, but in an
earlier interview he said he had no vested interest in RBL California
and advocated the program because "it will be good for the kids." The
program he represented to the board on Tuesday was a Web-based
children's literacy program that could be modified for
Spanish-speaking adults.</TE>
<TE>   He denied misleading the board about the California company
because the program's chief designer, Gary Andersen, also had founded
the Washington-based firm. Andersen is still a board member of the
Washington firm but left it in October 2001 to form RBL California
with two software programmers. Andersen said it was a coincidence
that Polanco's friend, Beltran, is listed as the registered agent on
RBL California's articles of incorporation.</TE>
<TE>   "The senator never mentioned to me that he's a close friend of
his," said Andersen, adding that another California contact referred
him to Beltran.</TE>
<TE>   Beltran did not return phone calls Friday to his Los Angeles
office seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said Friday that he is also upset to learn that William
Chavez, who previously had been Polanco's chief of staff, lobbied for
Andersen in Sacramento last year while Chavez simultaneously was on a
$10,000-a-month retainer for lobbying legislators on behalf of the
Los Angeles school district.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said he was troubled that Chavez seemed to be at
cross-purposes. "I think it's a potential conflict if you have a
lobbyist with multiple clients trying to sell things to the
district."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez said he did not consider his actions to be lobbying since
he just introduced Andersen to the assistant superintendent of adult
schools, not to board members.</TE>
<TE>   The episode has moved the district to take a closer look at how it
procures goods and services and how it tracks lobbyists' potential
conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's meeting, district lawyers warned trustees that
Polanco had apparently violated the state's open meetings law by
holding several individual meetings with board members in search of a
consensus on a specific proposal. District Inspector General Don
Mullinax said Friday that he has opened an investigation into that
possibility. Polanco denied any violation of those rules.</TE>
<TE>   Board members Genethia Hayes, David Tokofsky, Jose Huizar and
Korenstein voted for the proposal anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes made the motion proposing that the board adopt the adult
literacy program and said she based her decision on a visit she made
to Redmond to see how RBL Washington's methods were being used in
schools there.</TE>
<TE>   "My motion had to do with the Reality Based Learning in
Washington," Hayes said Friday. "If there was another company in
California, I didn't know about that." She and two others said they
are reconsidering their votes.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen said the program would use real pictures of scenes around
Los Angeles to give English-learning parents practical knowledge of
the language. For example the program would take users on a virtual
bus ride to the Los Angeles Zoo to teach them how to read signs and
instructions in English.</TE>
<TE>   But Andersen acknowledged that his ideas were still in the
conceptual stage and that he does not own the children's literacy
program that Hayes and other board members saw in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "We're writing the code from the ground up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Lim, president of RBL Washington, said his corporation has no
affiliation with the California firm and no agreement to share
software. Lim said he has asked Andersen to change his company's
name.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship between Beltran and Polanco was the subject of an
investigation by The Times in 1999 into allegations that the two used
the threat of recall elections to muscle elected officials into
giving Beltran's firm city attorney contracts. Polanco and Beltran
denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco took Andersen's program before the board Tuesday over
Romer's strong opposition. Romer accused Polanco of using his
position as Senate majority leader to ram through a specific
contract, rather than encouraging a more general discussion on
policy. Polanco described how he had visited every board member with
Andersen in tow, lobbying for passage of the proposal.</TE>

<LD>Forecasters say cool, unsettled conditions will bring the chance of a
few rain and snow showers in Southern California toward the end of
this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The National Weather Service originally thought it might be the
biggest storm of the year, but wind shifts now mean most of the
precipitation probably will pass to the north and east.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the same old story this winter," said Bill Hoffer, a weather
service meteorologist in Oxnard. "Once again, a lot of stuff will hit
the High Sierra, but most of it will miss us."</LD>
<TE>   Hoffer said there's a 20% chance of rain in the Los Angeles Basin
Sunday afternoon, increasing to 40% Sunday night before dropping off
to 30% Monday morning.</TE>
<TE>   He said downtown Los Angeles should get a quarter inch to half an
inch of rain "at the most," with up to twice that much in the
foothills, before the storm moves east Monday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Several inches of snow are expected above 4,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Skies should remain partly cloudy for most of next week, but no
more rain is expected. Temperatures will be a little cooler than
normal in the coastal and intermediate valleys, with daytime highs in
the mid-60s following overnight lows in the 40s.</TE>
<TE>   At the Civic Center downtown, total rainfall for the year that
runs from July 1 through June 30 stood at only 4.10 inches Friday
night, less than a third of the normal total for the date of 12.36
inches.</TE>

<HD>Release of Reagan Papers Expected to Attract Historians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Capping months of anticipation, archivists at the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library released nearly 60,000 pages of presidential
papers Friday, a move expected to draw a wave of scholars,
researchers and historians to the mountaintop museum near Simi
Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The materials, approved for public review by the National Archives
earlier this week, include everything from Reagan's weekly radio
addresses and annual State of the Union speeches to reports on civil
rights, voting rights and human rights.</LD>
<LD>   The collection also includes the office files of dozens of Reagan
staffers, including such notables as Colin Powell, Edwin Meese and
Oliver North.</LD>
<TE>   Only a few news crews were on hand for Friday morning's unveiling,
but library Director Duke Blackwood said he expects the presidential
records to spur plenty of attention.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time we can open more documents that tell the story of the
Reagan administrations, we feel it's important," Blackwood said. "I
think we are going to have, from a research standpoint, a steady
stream of interest."</TE>
<TE>   The documents were among about 68,000 pages of Reagan records that
had been withheld from public review under the Presidential Records
Act of 1978, which allows former presidents to keep under wraps
papers that contain confidential advice and information.</TE>
<TE>   The law sets a 12-year period of confidentiality, meaning Reagan's
papers should have been available for public inspection last January.</TE>
<TE>   However, in a controversial move, President Bush issued an
executive order late last year to override the 1978 act, barring
archivists from releasing any former president's records until the
sitting president and the former president's representative give
their approval.</TE>
<TE>   The order was challenged by historians and journalists eager to
get at the confidential communications from Reagan's White House.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the National Archives cleared 8,000 pages for
release earlier this year, followed by the 59,850 pages of documents
disclosed Friday. Still at issue are 150 additional pages of Reagan
papers currently under review by the White House.</TE>
<TE>   There is no scheduled release date for those documents.</TE>

<LD>The proposed University of California campus near Merced moved
another step closer to reality Friday with the final acquisition of
7,030 acres, including a golf course, for the campus site, university
officials announced.</LD>
<LD>   The land was acquired from the Virginia Smith Trust in the
successful completion of a deal that was announced a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Also Friday, the officials said, a partnership created by the
university and the trust acquired 1,240 acres from a rancher for a
planned community south of the campus. The two transactions totaled
$15 million, they said.</LD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city is pursuing its first lawsuit under a new initiative that
lets prosecutors file civil charges in addition to criminal charges
in hate crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Oakland recently filed the suit on behalf of George Rothman, 85,
who says that for 10 years he has been harassed and stalked by
neighbors because he is Jewish and has black friends.</LD>
<LD>   Rothman alleges that his neighbors called him racial epithets,
harassment that he said has escalated over the last year. One
defendant said the dispute is a neighbor-to-neighbor squabble.</LD>
<TE>   The Oakland initiative was enacted shortly after Sept. 11 in an
attempt to quell hate crimes--defined as violence, intimidation or
threats against a person based on race, gender, sexual orientation or
age.</TE>

<HD>Judge Reinstates Bias Suit Against Stanford</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge has decided that a former Stanford University medical student
can proceed with a lawsuit alleging that school officials failed to
protect her from professional reprisals for reporting sexual
harassment in 1991.</LD>
<LD>   Barbara Zylbert--who graduated with an honors medical degree in
1996--charges that university officials sabotaged her career in the
decade after she filed a sexual harassment suit against a prominent
Stanford cardiologist.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, citing new and different facts, a Santa Clara County
judge reversed his January decision that released Stanford from the
lawsuit. But the judge reinstated only one of Zylbert's five
complaints against the university--that she was not allowed to
complete her residency training at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center.</LD>

complaining of sexual harassment.</TE>

<HD>Fighting Secession a Tricky Task for Hahn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With poll results showing citywide support for San Fernando Valley
secession, the onus is on Mayor James K. Hahn to persuade voters to
keep Los Angeles together.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor's political consultants say that those behind the
movement to break up the city are selling snake oil. They also say
their planned $5-million campaign against secession in the fall will
make voters see the light.</LD>
<LD>   But experts not affiliated with either side say that Hahn could
alienate voters if he conducts the campaign in a way that disparages
secession supporters. Hahn advisors have said the campaign might try
to frighten voters with warnings of higher taxes and reduced
services.</LD>
<TE>   "A negative campaign could backfire on the opponents," said county
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who sits on the commission charged with
analyzing the secession proposal and heads the committee that is
hammering out the details of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky, who has not taken a position on secession, chided the
mayor for calling it a "harebrained" idea at a public meeting last
week.</TE>
<TE>   "Forty-six percent of the people on first impression say they
support the idea," Yaroslavsky said. "They don't like to be called
harebrained."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the Los Angeles Times released the results of its
latest poll on Valley secession, which showed 46% of voters citywide
favor a municipal breakup, 38% oppose it and 16% are undecided. Among
Valley voters, the poll found 55% in favor, 36% opposed and 9%
undecided. To win, the secession proposal must pass in both the
Valley and the city at large.</TE>
<TE>   The support citywide increased by 10 percentage points from a year
ago, when the last Times poll on secession was conducted.</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to pinpoint a reason for the change. One
possibility is that disenchantment with the mayor, whose approval
ratings have dropped, contributed to frustrations about the city.
Another is that secession seems more credible than it did a year ago.
The state agency that oversees the process said an independent Valley
would be financially healthy.</TE>
<TE>   The poll also followed months of public hearings on the proposal
as well as negotiations between the city and secessionists on the
terms of a split.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good wake-up call for people who are opposed to
secession," said Bill Carrick, a media consultant hired by Hahn for
the anti-secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to have to wage a real serious campaign here."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's task could be more difficult if, as expected, secession
proposals for Hollywood and the harbor area are placed on the
November ballot with the Valley plan.</TE>
<TE>   None of the secession bids has yet been approved to go before
voters, but the state agency that oversees the incorporation of new
cities has said it intends to complete its analysis of the three
proposals in time for the November election.</TE>
<TE>   Secession proponents said their campaign will emphasize the
findings of state regulators that a Valley city would be financially
viable and would not harm residents in the rest of the city.</TE>
<TE>   They say that they, too, plan to raise several million dollars for
a campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are pretty encouraging [poll] numbers," said former state
Assemblyman Richard Katz, who serves on the board of the organization
spearheading the secession drive. "It shows that there is an
instinctive feeling among the voters ... that this would be a good
idea."</TE>
<TE>   Because the proposal already has solid support in the San Fernando
Valley and fairly high approval in the southern end of the city, a
key battleground could be the middle swath of L.A., where voters
expressed the most skepticism, said William Fulton, president of the
Ventura-based Solimar Research Group, which specializes in urban
planning issues.</TE>
<TE>   "The important campaign is the Wilshire Boulevard campaign," said
Fulton, whose 1997 book "The Reluctant Metropolis" documents the
rapid growth of the Los Angeles area.</TE>
<TE>   "The mid-section of the city wants to stay together and the
extremities want to secede."</TE>
<TE>   Raphael Sonenshein, a political scientist at Cal State Fullerton
who follows regional politics, cautioned that support for secession
could dwindle considerably by November.</TE>
<TE>   So far, he said, most information that voters have received about
a possible municipal breakup has been positive. By November, after a
massive campaign about the possible negative impact of secession,
that might change.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think support is going to get a lot bigger," Sonenshein
said. "Everything out there is giving the impression that [seceding
is] a pretty easy thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Sonenshein and others said that secessionists must tap into
existing frustration with the size and complexity of the city, and
opponents must persuade people that secession would make things
worse.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson called Friday for the
demolition of an illegal billboard in his district and the
prosecution of its owner.</LD>
<LD>   Bernson, unhappy with delays in city enforcement of billboard
ordinances, said his own survey of 5% of the signs in his northwest
San Fernando Valley district turned up at least three unlicensed
billboards.</LD>
<LD>   Tearing down one of them would provide the grounds to challenge a
state law that makes illegal signs legal after five years.</LD>
<TE>   "I think that's horse manure," Bernson said.</TE>
<TE>   The council recently ordered an inventory of the estimated 10,000
billboards in the city, but Bernson wanted faster action and sent his
staff out to identify suspect signs for scrutiny by the Building and
Safety Department.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors reported Friday that of 104 billboards surveyed, three
were apparently erected without permits and six others had been
altered so that they did not comply with original permit
specifications.</TE>
<TE>   Bernson said he wants to force a court decision on whether state
law is binding on the city. The 1983 statute legalizes signs in
existence for five years that have not been cited by the city.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to take down one of the illegals and test the state law,"
Bernson said. "We have to test it. Otherwise we have no enforcement
authority."</TE>
<TE>   The city has asked the owners of the three allegedly illegal signs
to produce proof that permits were issued.</TE>

<HD>Bernson Seeks to Challenge Billboard Statute</HD>
<DH>Enforcement: Valley councilman targets unlicensed signs
that automatically become legal after five years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson called Friday for the
demolition of an illegal billboard in his district and the
prosecution of its owner.</LD>
<LD>   Bernson, unhappy with delays in city enforcement of billboard
ordinances, said his own survey of 5% of the signs in his northwest
San Fernando Valley district turned up at least three unlicensed
billboards.</LD>
<LD>   Tearing down one of them would provide the grounds to challenge a
state law that makes illegal signs legal after five years.</LD>
<TE>   "I think that's horse manure," Bernson said.</TE>
<TE>   The council recently ordered an inventory of the estimated 10,000
billboards in the city, but Bernson wanted faster action and sent his
staff out to identify suspect signs for scrutiny by the Building and
Safety Department.</TE>
<TE>   Building inspectors reported Friday that of the 104 billboards
surveyed in Bernson's district, three were apparently erected without
permits and six others had been altered so that they did not comply
with the original permit specifications.</TE>
<TE>   Bernson said he wants to force a court decision on whether state
law is binding on the city. The 1983 statute legalizes signs in
existence for five years that have not been cited by the city.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to take down one of the illegals and test the state law,"
Bernson said. "We have to test it. Otherwise we have no enforcement
authority."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant City Atty. Sharon Siedorf Cardenas said she believes the
city can move against illegal billboards, but Bernson said such a
case would likely end up in a court dispute over the effect of state
law.</TE>
<TE>   The state Business and Professions Code states that there shall be
a "rebuttable presumption" that a billboard is legally erected if it
has existed for five years without written notice of the city that it
is illegal. That grandfathering of illegal billboards means the city
would have to pay the owner fair market value to have it removed,
something city officials say would be prohibitively expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors said they could not find permits for signs at 16940
Chatsworth St., 17650 Chatsworth St. and 166121/2 Roscoe Place. The
city has asked the owners to produce proof that permits were issued,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   If the owners cannot furnish that proof, the city will move to
take civil or criminal action against them, said David Keim, the
city's head of building code enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "On all of them, we are going to do some sort of prosecution," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Keim said that it appears from printing on the billboards that two
are owned by Clear Channel Outdoor and one is owned by Vista Media.
Representatives of the two companies did not return calls for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Keim told a city task force on sign issues Friday that his office
is developing a plan to inventory all billboards in the city and take
enforcement action as required over a four-year period.</TE>
<TE>   Bernson's pilot project in his district showed that it is
time-consuming to research ownership and permit status on billboards,
and will help building officials determine what kind of budget and
staffing will be needed, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Judge Allows South Gate Recall Drive to Proceed</HD>
<DH>Politics: The targeted officials' complaints about printing
flaws on petitions are rejected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge ruled Friday that a voter recall drive targeting South Gate's
leading officials can go forward, bringing a high-stakes election one
step closer to reality.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Dzintra I. Janavs rejected the targeted
officials' claims that the recall should be thrown out because of
printing flaws on the petitions.</LD>
<LD>   The decision means that an election seeking to oust the city
treasurer and his three City Council allies could occur as early as
summer.</LD>
<TE>   Recall organizers, who say they have collected more than 8,000
signatures, said the ruling served to restore voter confidence in the
crisis-racked city.</TE>
<TE>   California Secretary of State Bill Jones has said the city's
electoral process is so riddled with cronyism and electoral
subterfuge that it ranks as the worst in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "It just shows that the will of the people is stronger than the
political manipulation that has taken place by the City Council
majority," said Joe Ruiz, the recall's lead organizer. "We will
prevail."</TE>
<TE>   But Vice Mayor Xochilt Ruvalcaba, one of the recall targets,
called the judge's decision unfair and said she looked forward to an
appeal that could overturn the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "It just sends a message that you don't have to follow the law,"
she said. "Just do whatever you want."</TE>
<TE>   The central issue in the case revolved around the format used on
the one-page recall petitions, which contain the proponents' reasons
for the recall and the targeted officials' responses.</TE>
<TE>   The officials cried foul because, among other things, their
responses distributed to voters appeared in lighter type than the
proponents' statements.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge brushed aside this argument as a minor, technical
issue.</TE>
<TE>   She chastised the city's attorneys for assuming that voters would
not bother to read the entire petitions before signing them.</TE>
<TE>   "I frankly don't see how this is particularly misleading," Janavs
said.</TE>
<TE>   The decision comes two weeks after Jones ordered the city to turn
over its electoral process to the Los Angeles County
registrar-recorder's office or the city's elected city clerk, Carmen
Avalos.</TE>
<TE>   The council majority last year replaced Avalos with an elections
consultant in an action that Jones said reeked of electoral
manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Recall organizers want to oust Ruvalcaba, Treasurer Albert Robles,
Mayor Raul Moriel and Councilwoman Maria Benavides because of alleged
corruption. The officials deny the accusations.</TE>

<HD>VA Services May Move From Valley</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is considering a plan to move
rare and expensive patient diagnostic procedures from its Sepulveda
Ambulatory Care Center to its West Los Angeles facility as a
cost-savings measure, an agency official said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Although a final decision has not been made, those who rely on the
clinic for medical and counseling services say the move would portend
the eventual closure of a facility that primarily serves veterans
living in the San Fernando Valley and northern Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposal, rare and costly nuclear medicine procedures
would be performed at the Wadsworth Veterans Administration Medical
Center in West Los Angeles, said Charles Dorman, executive director
for the Veterans Affairs Department's Greater Los Angeles Ambulatory
Care Services.</LD>
<TE>   Patients needing specialized dermatological or radiological
examinations would see their primary care physician at Sepulveda, and
that doctor would then set up a teleconference with a specialist at
Wadsworth, Dorman said. General radiology would remain available at
Sepulveda.</TE>
<TE>   Dorman said before any changes are made, the agency will consult
with Rep. Howard P. "Buck" McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), Rep. Howard
Berman (D-Mission Hills) and with a newly formed veterans advisory
council. Those meetings are expected to take place in the next few
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Dorman said the potential changes are considered necessary because
annual federal appropriations have not kept pace with the rising
number of patients seeking care at medical facilities in the agency's
Desert Pacific network, which serves Los Angeles, San Diego and San
Bernardino counties as well as greater Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "The workload has grown in Los Angeles, but it has not grown as
fast as in Las Vegas and San Diego and San Bernardino counties,"
Dorman said. "To meet those needs, we have to shift resources from
Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Some Veterans Fear Clinic Will Be Closed</TE>
<TE>   Even so, veterans such as David L. Folck of Mission Hills consider
the potential loss of nuclear medicine, radiology and dermatology
services another step toward the eventual closure of the North Hills
campus, despite a promise made in November by U.S. Secretary of
Veterans Affairs Anthony J. Principi to keep it open.</TE>
<TE>   "Many vets who have learned about this cutback at Sepulveda are
not happy about it and want the VA to cease cutting back services,"
Folck said. "Many veterans are willing to demonstrate and be heard on
this."</TE>
<TE>   Dorman said he is sympathetic to the veterans' concerns and
encourages them to press their congressional representatives to make
veterans' medical care a mandatory funding appropriation.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are used to having services nearby, you feel like they
are being taken away," he said. "We are looking for a way to maintain
or improve care, but it may not be as convenient."</TE>

<HD>Strawberries Sweeten Job Picture</HD>
<DH>Economy: County unemployment drops from 5.5% in January to
4.7% last month, thanks partly to robust harvest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reflecting a brightening national economy and the local strawberry
harvest, Ventura County employers added 4,400 jobs last month as
unemployment plummeted.</LD>
<LD>   The number of local jobs had fallen during the previous two
months, but February's sharp increase made up those losses and
resumed a pattern of monthly gains that had dated back to 1996.</LD>
<LD>   The county's jobless rate fell from 5.5% in January to 4.7% in
February, compared with a February figure of 6.4% in California and
6.1% nationwide, without seasonal adjustments.</LD>
<TE>   There were 19,800 jobless workers last month out of a work force
of 423,900, a higher number of unemployed than seen in February 2001
or 2000 but very low from a 10-year perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with a year before, jobs were up 6,800 in February, with
growth nearly even between farm and nonfarm employment.</TE>
<TE>   "The state and national recovery is certainly underway, and
there's a spillover effect here," said Mark Schniepp of the
California Economic Forecast in Santa Barbara. "We still are doing
particularly well in Southern California. We predicted a spring
recovery, so this is no surprise."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the biggest job gains were apparently fueled by a robust
strawberry harvest, which rolled in early because of mild weather and
a larger planting for the winter.</TE>
<TE>   Farm-related employment increased by 2,800, to 23,200, in a month.</TE>
<TE>   Farms employed 3,300 more workers in February than in the same
month in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We have more acres of the early strawberries, so that may account
for some of that," said Kerry DuFrain, deputy agricultural
commissioner for the county.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the county has 10% more acres in strawberries this year
than last.</TE>
<TE>   Off-the-farm employment increased by 1,600 jobs during the month,
with local education accounting for 500, manufacturing adding 400 and
the service industry 400.</TE>
<TE>   The local economy is riding out the downturn better than the state
and nation because heavy manufacturing and Internet businesses, the
nation's weakest sectors, are not big employers in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never found anything fundamentally wrong with the economy,"
Schniepp said. "There was a lot of knee jerk after Sept. 11, but
Southern California hasn't shown any systemic problems, and the same
with Ventura County. It's just amazing how the [Ventura Freeway]
technology corridor remains so resilient."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's unemployment rate was 12th lowest in the state,
while Orange County ranked third and San Diego County fourth, with
rates of 3.6% and 3.7%. Los Angeles County's rate of 6.4% was 24th.</TE>
<TE>   San Luis Obispo County ranked first out of 58 counties with a 3.1%
jobless rate.</TE>
<TE>   Schniepp said he expects steady job growth for the rest of the
year, with the only impediment being the availability and
affordability of housing.</TE>

<HD>Resignation of Head of Police Panel Is Urged</HD>
<DH>City Hall: Caruso is said to have slurred Rep. Waters. Some
call the demand a political move by backers of Parks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Los Angeles City Council members, Nate Holden and Jan Perry,
demanded Friday that Mayor James K. Hahn force Police Commission head
Rick Caruso to quit because of an insulting remark he allegedly made
about South Los Angeles Congresswoman Maxine Waters.</LD>
<LD>   A ranking Hahn aide, Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook, responded by
decrying what he called "shameless political tactics" by backers of
another term for Police Chief Bernard C. Parks to discredit Caruso in
the struggle over Parks' future.</LD>
<LD>   The five-member Police Commission will decide if Parks is to have
another five-year term. Holden, Perry and Waters all support
retention of Parks.</LD>
<TE>   Caruso was appointed by Hahn, who opposes a second term for the
chief.</TE>
<TE>   Holden, citing an anonymous letter, started Friday's political
fireworks by saying Caruso had "used the B-word to describe Waters"
at a Feb. 28 meeting with five ranking police officers over noise
problems at the Grove, a new shopping center Caruso developed in the
Fairfax district.</TE>
<TE>   Waters, traveling in New York, said later she felt that if Caruso
had made the remark he is not fit to serve.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's all right for the president of the Police Commission to
refer to women in such a foul manner, he should never be in the
position to make policy about disciplining police officers who use
the same type of language," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the officers who attended the meeting said they regarded
the conversation with Caruso as private and would neither confirm nor
deny that he had made the remark.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso declined to comment beyond a statement released by Joe
Gunn, executive director of the Police Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "The board holds Congresswoman Waters in high regard and are very
complimentary of her lifetime work on behalf of her constituents,"
the statement read. "However, the board will continue to focus on its
primary goal, ensuring that the process underway to determine if the
chief of police should be given a new five-year contract remains
fair.... The board will not be sidetracked by issues which appear to
influence this process."</TE>

<HD>Mayors of S.F., Miami at Odds</HD>
<DH>Tourism: Willie Brown's quip about crime in the Florida
city prompts a chilly response.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Mayor Willie Brown, whose colorful shoot-from-the-hip public
prognostications sometimes land wide of the mark, has apparently
misfired again.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking to reporters during a European trip to drum up foreign
visitors for his tourist-ailing city, Brown fired off a quip about
crime in Miami that prompted a terse letter of response from that
city's mayor.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Manuel Diaz on Tuesday sent Brown a letter saying he was
"dismayed" by Brown's comments to French reporters that suggested
Miami isn't safe for tourists.</LD>
<TE>   The brouhaha started when a French reporter told Brown that he had
been concerned for his safety during a recent San Francisco trip, to
which the mayor replied: "I think you've got us confused with Miami."</TE>
<TE>   Diaz isn't laughing.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me take a moment to share with you some rather enlightening
information about crime in the city of Miami," the mayor wrote, going
on to say crime there has dropped over the last eight years--making
it "clear that your comment about Miami is, at best, a
mischaracterization of the facts."</TE>
<TE>   Diaz finished his chilly one-page missive with another scold: "In
the future, I hope you will refrain from making comments that
unnecessarily impugn the character of another city and its
residents."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, still abroad Friday, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   But his aides had this response to Diaz: Lighten up.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor's comments were tongue-in-cheek," said spokesman Ron
Vinson. "He didn't mean any harm in what he was saying."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Penton, a spokeswoman for Diaz, said the mayor heard about
Brown's comments from a Miami Herald reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "He was, like, taken aback," she said. "He didn't say anything; he
didn't have to. The look on his face said it all."</TE>
<TE>   Brown's comments were particularly irresponsible, Penton said, in
light of the Sept. 11 attacks, which have major cities across the
country trying to woo skittish tourists, especially foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   "So here comes Brown, who's in Europe to promote foreign tourism
for his own city, taking knocks at one of his colleagues," Penton
said. "Not good."</TE>
<TE>   Brown is scheduled to return today from a weeklong trip to London,
Paris and Rome as part of a junket by the city's Convention and
Tourism Bureau. Aides said he has not seen Diaz's letter, adding that
Brown may not even know about the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Serving his second term as San Francisco mayor, Brown has
previously made news with his off-the-cuff comments, once referring
to then-backup San Francisco 49ers quarterback Elvis Grbac as "an
embarrassment to humankind" after a loss in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz and Brown have met at least once at a U.S. Conference of
Mayors convention, and their relationship was described as cordial.</TE>
<TE>   Brown would like to keep it that way, staffers said.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor is a person who in certain situations likes to have fun
with things," Vinson said. "He considers Mayor Diaz a colleague and
would never do anything to intentionally cause problems for his
city."</TE>

<LD>The stories about priest-pedophiles in Boston and recent dismissals
of priests in Los Angeles and Orange County have resonated in every
corner.</LD>
<LD>   RITA LUTHER spoke with a Carmelite priest about the impact these
events have had on those who serve the Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   FATHER MATT EWING</TE>
<TE>   72, retired Carmelite priest living in Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I feel very sad. I feel very self-conscious as a priest. I sort of
hide my collar when I am out in public. I'm ashamed, really, of the
church. And I'm angry.</TE>
<TE>   But, the flip side of anger is depression, so I think it even
touches me there.</TE>
<TE>   I thank God that I'm retired so that I don't have to answer the
unspoken questions of the parishioners. And to preach on a subject
such as this, knowing that in our own ranks are people who are
violating this very sacred trust--how hollow can you sound? You would
almost choke on the words.</TE>
<TE>   There are not many difficulties that as a priest and a therapist I
have not encountered. I'm a licensed marriage, family and child
counselor and have a doctorate in clinical psychology.</TE>
<TE>   I have been honored to serve the Carmelites as a teacher, as a
vocation director, as a pastor and as a superior of a Carmelite
community.</TE>
<TE>   I have also worked for the Catholic Psychological Services of the
Los Angeles Archdiocese and now have my own private practice.</TE>
<TE>   I volunteer at the Rose Vista Maternity Home in Mar Vista
counseling the young women about their lives after their babies are
born. I encourage them and discuss whether any beliefs that they
might have could be integrated into a better foundation for their
lives.</TE>
<TE>   I am well-acquainted with the failings of our wounded human
nature.</TE>
<TE>   Yet a sacred trust has been broken. The irreparable damage and
harm that have been done to children, the hurt to parents and
guardians and the shame and disgrace to the church are almost
impossible to repair or heal.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks be to God that there is a faith that is very difficult to
uproot in people who are grounded in the love of God. And thanks also
that this faith goes along with a justifiable outrage at these crimes
and the negligence of those in charge.</TE>
<TE>   I know of a priest who, 25 years ago, reported to the chancery
office the possibility that one priest may have been guilty of this
crime. He was told that the accused had the recourse to the sacrament
of confession!</TE>
<TE>   Pedophilia is a chronic mental disorder. People afflicted with
this illness need psychological counseling, and I believe they should
be expelled from the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   We are told we are priests forever, but now with a fuller
understanding of this mental illness and the exposure of its presence
in the church, Rome has spoken: You are out!</TE>
<TE>   Things have changed. I see it in my approach to people.</TE>
<TE>   There used to be a saying that "hugs keep the therapist away." Not
anymore. Hugs are out of the question. When I see a young person, I
make sure there are [other] people around.</TE>
<TE>   Rome is in favor of psychological testing to screen people out.
But the concern is that the screener and the vocational directors
might be a part of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   You see the bind we could be in? It's almost like being in
quicksand. The more you struggle to get out, the more you sink.</TE>
<TE>   God can get good out of evil, and this is evil. It is going to
take a lot of decisive action, honesty and adherence to the Bible,
tradition and the teaching authority of the church.</TE>
<TE>   Right now it seems like we're in the process of rearranging the
deck chairs on the Titanic.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, we have hope in God's promise to be with us all days.</TE>

<BD>Arlene Schindler lives in Los Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most of my friends are currently unemployed. They used to work at
dot-coms or sitcoms.</LD>
<LD>   It's bad enough to be unemployed, but your chances of getting
hired come to a screeching halt when you reach your 40s.</LD>
<LD>   Becoming invisible after 40 is not just a quandary for movie
stars; it impacts many people who are looking for work in Los
Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Like it or not, especially with the recent economic downturn, most
large companies generally hire younger, less costly workers. Numerous
unemployed are forced to reinvent themselves, look for new careers,
new skills, at what's supposed to be the greatest income-producing
time in their lives. Forty to 55 used to be considered the prime
earning years. Now many experience the panic and anxiety of
outplacement and the need to "recareer."</TE>
<TE>   I graduated college in the 1970s. But I don't dare put that year
on my resume. It might frighten a prospective employer who was being
toilet trained during that same era.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, we live in a world of "equal opportunity employers." But many
recruitment ads utilize the euphemisms of discrimination. For
example, many a job description asks for a college degree and three
to five years' experience. This is doublespeak for saying, "We want
someone 30-ish or younger."</TE>
<TE>   I know this to be true because I actually interviewed for one of
these spots. When I showed up at the company, everyone there was
30-ish. I was the only one without a toe ring.</TE>
<TE>   People suggest looking for a job on the Internet. There are
thousands of jobs there, right? But there are hundreds of thousands
of people applying for those spots. Any employer who has posted a
position on the Internet will tell you of being inundated with
responses. Most don't even acknowledge your application; they can't
with such volume.</TE>
<TE>   Others explore taking temporary jobs while looking for full-time
work. Many temp agencies are swamped with hundreds of prospective
candidates--all highly qualified--to handle a few dozen positions.</TE>
<TE>   Many displaced workers need to recareer. This involves taking
training programs to learn new skills.</TE>
<TE>   Some large corporations are promoting campaigns that say, "We hire
55 and older." That's great. Maybe tax incentives can be offered for
those firms that do hire people 40 and older. Extending unemployment
benefits would also help.</TE>
<TE>   On behalf of the unemployed, I hope our elected officials will pay
attention to the job struggle many of us are undergoing and will
respond to our emergency needs. Otherwise, they may soon join us.</TE>

<HD>Boundaries for Arbitrators</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been nearly three years since the American Arbitration Assn.,
the American Medical Assn. and the American Bar Assn. jointly
recommended that legislators prohibit managed care companies from
forcing members to settle health care disputes through private judges
or arbitrators. This week lawmakers began taking sensible steps
toward that goal. On Tuesday the American Arbitration Assn. announced
it would begin barring its members from settling disputes unless both
judges and patients voluntarily agreed to the out-of-court process.
Since then, legislators introduced six bills to eliminate secrecy,
financial conflicts and excessive fees from mandatory arbitration.</LD>
<LD>   Lawsuits are not the most efficient way of resolving medical
disputes. The desire to unclog the court system was what prompted the
move to alternative dispute resolution methods like arbitration in
the '80s. Today the courts are even more hard-pressed, lacking the
resources to handle the thousands of arbitration requests that
managed care companies receive from their members each year.</LD>
<TE>   But the arbitration system in California is unfairly rigged
against health care consumers. While California businesses, employers
and health plans continue to require employees, consumers and
patients to agree to have private arbitrators handle health care
disputes, the arbitration industry, ranging from individual
arbitrators operating out of their houses to large national
corporations, is largely unregulated.</TE>
<TE>   That's why both HMO leaders and Sacramento legislators should
embrace a package of bills introduced this week that would clarify
that private judging corporations are not entitled to absolute
immunity for any wrongdoing in mandatory consumer arbitrations and
would require private judging corporations to report the results of
arbitration proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   HMOs, legislators and managed care patients have a common
interest: By improving the credibility, accountability and
objectivity of arbitration, they can guarantee basic due- process
rights for HMO patients, while quieting the clamor for expensive
court trials.</TE>

<LD>Ever had an argument via e-mail? :( Wanna have one now? Well, be very
careful. E-mail disagreements are not only more likely to escalate
than person-to-person discussions, it seems they also leave a written
trail for hard feelings to follow. A couple of little-noticed new
studies indicate, first, the growing importance of e-mail
communications in everyday business and personal lives beyond the
superficial "How R U?" messages and, second, the invisible dangers
increasingly inherent in the informal, intimate and yet strangely
disconnected format of e-mail. As the use and depth of e-mail mature,
the implications for society and individual relationships mount too.</LD>
<LD>   In the early days of e-mail, way, way back late last century,
personal e-mail was merely a hasty electronic postcard not used for
subtle or sophisticated messages but just for reaching out to someone
quickly and simply. It's perfectly suited for hectic superficial
times when really listening is so rare that statements often require
repeating. It's perfectly suited for hectic superficial times when
really listening is so rare that statements often require repeating.
Such stamp-free missives do survive during times of crisis: A UCLA
study found that immediately after Sept. 11, 100 million
Americans--around 57% of all e-mailers--sent or received expressions
of concern.</LD>
<TE>   But as Internet use and e-mail familiarity have grown, so has the
expectation for and content of e-mail. New research by the Pew
Internet and American Life Project finds the Internet less a novelty
now and more a purposeful tool for work and communicating more
weighty, urgent contents to colleagues, friends and family. E-mail is
easy, quick, informal. That's the appeal--also the danger. E-mails
invite assumptions about casualness, understandings, confidentiality.
Assumptions are the land mines of communications. Few invest the
intellectual effort composing e-mails that they would, say, a formal
letter. Ray Friedman was intrigued with e-mail protocols and
disputes, especially after escalating exchanges with an editor
sundered a friendship. He teaches conflict and negotiation at
Vanderbilt University.</TE>
<TE>   Beware, his new study lists many dangers. Conversations provide
instant audio and often visual feedback; e-mails don't. When talking,
people take turns point by point, adjusting their presentations and
responses as they read their partner; e-mails are unidirectional,
delivering 12 firm points quickly but in a peremptory lump. By No. 6
the recipient is livid, by No. 12 apoplectic, which shapes his or her
thermonuclear response. Nor have emoticons, those terribly cute
little punctuation marks misused to depict sideways smiley faces :),
crying :~(~~ , anger &amp;gt;&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;&amp;lt; and Marge Simpson *****:-),
proved all that effective, especially among males. Instead, they can
seem forced and, well, stilted :I ===</TE>

<LD>While President Bush's energy plan is stalemated in the Senate, the
administration is rushing oil and gas leasing programs in wild and
scenic areas throughout the West, including a part of the Los Padres
National Forest in Ventura County that provides sanctuary for the
endangered California condor.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Forest Service wants to throw open as many as 750,000
acres of the sprawling six-county forest to exploration and possible
drilling, although the focus is on 140,000 acres that appear to have
the highest potential for oil reserves. Most of that area had been
protected by the Clinton administration from new road construction
but now faces industrial invasion in the name of national energy
security. Some of these tracts are adjacent to the Sespe Condor
Sanctuary north of Fillmore.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, there appears to be only a minuscule amount of oil in the
Los Padres, a potential 84 million barrels, according to the forest's
draft environmental impact statement. That is less than 1% of the
nation's reserves, or nine days' supply from the North Slope of
Alaska via the trans-Alaska pipeline.</LD>
<TE>   The forest's proposal is particularly untimely. Los Padres
officials are in the midst of drafting a forestwide land and resource
management plan. Under a directive from Congress, this plan is
designed to study all potential uses of forest lands, and threats to
them, and provide a balance that best serves the land and the nation.
The planning study would decide, for instance, where oil and gas
development would be appropriate and where it would not. The plan
won't be completed until 2004. It makes no sense to go ahead with oil
development now and possibly learn later it was a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Forest officials say the leasing proposal has to proceed because
of legal rulings that oil and gas lease applications take precedent
over any planning process. But this is a non sequitur. No
applications are on file because no one can apply until the forest
officials completes the leasing study.</TE>
<TE>   There's another thing wrong with this picture. The Bush
administration has been rolling back a host of Clinton administration
environmental initiatives on the excuse that affected local
governments and businesses were not adequately consulted before
action was taken. Now, elected officials, tourism leaders and
environmental groups in the Los Padres region say that their views on
the oil and gas leasing are not being adequately considered. They
strongly oppose the expansion of oil production in the forest,
certainly before the comprehensive forest plan is completed. This is
coming from local and business interests, whose views are usually
backed by the administration. In this instance, the Bush
administration can do what's expedient for its political allies and
do the right thing at the same time.</TE>

<LD>In "L.A. County's Vanishing Past" (Opinion, March 10), Marc Haefele
quotes Roy Ritchie, director of research at the Huntington Library,
as saying that at one point court records up to the 1890s were
"loaded on a skid, ready to be dumped" when the Huntington intervened
to save them. For the record, at no time has the Los Angeles Superior
Court loaded up court records that have not been preserved on
microfilm to be dumped, nor has the court destroyed original records
older than 1920.</LD>
<LD>   While the Huntington Library for years expressed a desire to
acquire historical court records (something the court also wanted,
since the Huntington had the resources and facilities to keep them
from deteriorating, which the court did not and still does not have),
the court was legally bound to maintain its records permanently. In
1996, however, after two years of negotiations, an agreement was
reached that enabled records from 1850, which was the inception of
the court system in Los Angeles, to 1879 to be maintained on loan by
the Huntington for preservation and storage for an extended period.
The agreement also provides that the Huntington will catalog the
records and make them available to the public with the proviso that
they be returned to the court should a legal need arise.</LD>
<TE>   This agreement enabled the people of California to remain owners
of the material, as the law requires, yet allowed for the
preservation of historical documents. The court, on Sept. 20, 1996,
issued a news release announcing this agreement.</TE>

<LD>The Times' March 9 editorial "Secession, Enron-Style" raises
unsubstantiated doubts about what has been an open and public
financial review process. To equate the work done by the consultants,
Public Financial Management of Newport Beach, to the
behind-the-scenes dishonesty of Enron executives and Andersen
auditors is irresponsible. The Local Agency Formation Commission has
held 87 public meetings throughout Los Angeles to discuss, among
other things, the financial feasibility of the three proposed
independent cities in the harbor area, Hollywood and the Valley. I am
unaware of any comparable public meetings held by Enron or its
auditors to discuss the accounting methodology. There have been no
allegations of misconduct by anyone connected to the LAFCO process.</LD>
<LD>   It is irresponsible for The Times to smear LAFCO and its
consultants--and the process of independence being pursued by
communities with legitimate grievances against how the city is being
run--without stating a factual basis for the claim. We welcome the
California state controller's audit.</LD>

far this year, so I have had to assume the job of sweeping in front
of my own home. Will someone please tell me again why I pay taxes?</TE>

<LD>Re "Public's Anger Simmers Over Airport Searches," March 11: In
traveling to Orlando, Fla., recently, our family faced a double
whammy of missed and canceled flights, as well as special searches
and luggage X-rays apparently brought on by the fact we had changed
airlines--involuntarily. Fortunately, the screeners were
professional, and my cuticles are now safe from the threat of a
certain small shaving kit implement.</LD>
<LD>   But it would seem that these efforts should be targeted toward
people who better fit the terrorist profile than a family with young
children. It appears that the federal government is practicing a kind
of random, democratic political correctness in its approach to
airline security--which would waste time and money and not make us
safer. Let's hope things aren't what they appear and that there's a
good tactical reason for this that's not evident.</LD>

<TE>   Going through airport security for a recent round-trip,
cross-country flight, I was subjected to a random search twice. Both
times the security employee searching my carry-on bag missed an
inside pocket. I no longer want to fly, not due to a fear of flying
but due to knowing that the airport and airline security measures are
an ineffective facade.</TE>

<TE>   "LAX Needs Better Evacuation Plans," the March 9 letter describing
the situation at LAX when there was a terrorist scare, reminded me of
my experience three weeks after the [Sept. 11] attack while I waited
for a flight to Europe.</TE>
<TE>   I had a serious foot injury and needed a wheelchair. Despite
efforts by a friendly passenger and myself, no wheelchair was ever
provided. I sat on my suitcase on the floor for more than two hours.
This is in sharp contrast to the service at the airport in Sydney,
Australia, where wheelchairs are readily available and polite agents
approach the waiting passengers to provide information and
assistance.</TE>
<TE>   LAX has a long way to go as far as service is concerned. Airports
in Paris, Rome and London have been implementing security measures
for many years. We need to learn from policies at other, experienced
airports.</TE>

<LD>I think David W. Kay (letter, March 8) is on to something by
suggesting a $50 surcharge for Orange County residents who use either
LAX or Ontario airports. However, I have one better for him. The fee
should be directly proportionate to the percentage that one's city
voted for Measure W. For example, Aliso Viejo would have the highest
fee of $93, while Newport Beach would have the lowest fee of $15.
Since I am from Huntington Beach, I would be obliged to pay $39.</LD>
<LD>   Now sure, South County cities would have the highest fees overall.
But this should not be a major problem. Especially when one considers
that they raised millions of dollars promoting a phony "Great Park"
proposal that they knew the Navy would never support. So what's a
little extra fee to the folks from wealthy enclaves like Monarch
Beach and Coto de Caza?</LD>

<LD>John Whitbeck's "Ideology Hiding Behind a Word" (Commentary, March
10) puts forward the premise that "terrorism" is an "epithet" and a
term of abuse with no intrinsic meaning. He brings up the old canard
that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter and says
that if the Palestinians had access to F-16s to gain their freedom,
they would use them. This ignores a fundamental fact about terrorism:
It is a violent attempt to induce political change through attacking
specifically civilian populations.</LD>
<LD>   There are other ways to gain peace and liberty, as Gandhi and
Martin Luther King both could have attested.</LD>
<LD>   The violence in Israel can be placed cleanly at the feet of Yasser
Arafat and his PLO leadership, which rejected Bill Clinton's attempt
to bring peace in late 2000. Arafat could not accept that offer
because his and the PLO's aim is the destruction of Israel.</LD>
<TE>   Osama bin Laden's murder of innocents at the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon cannot go unanswered. Perhaps Whitbeck would prefer
that President Bush tell Americans that there is no danger and that
we should return to business as usual? Unfortunately, Whitbeck's
claim is as fatuous as the claims of all the other apologists for the
wholesale, bloody murder of innocents, and Americans have now
awakened enough to reject these opinions based on fantasy.</TE>

<TE>   Whitbeck's opinion on the war on "terrorism" is shared by many of
us who are alarmed at how our president and his administration, in
their zeal to protect the world from itself, are slowly leading this
country into a "big brother" state on the pretext of fighting
terrorism. The liberties that we enjoy as citizens are the backbone
of what has made this country unique in all of world history.</TE>
<TE>   Ask the Israelis if their security state has made them any safer.
The only true winners I see in this scheme are a burgeoning
government bureaucracy and corporations that benefit from spying on
and locking up unpopular dissenters, which then will allow the
president and his donors to do whatever they want.</TE>
<TE>   Salvador Jimenez</TE>
<TE>   City of Industry</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So Whitbeck believes terrorism is a word with "no intrinsic
meaning." How about this definition: an attack on civilians without
any warning, any chance for the victims to defend themselves and
usually no self-identification so that the victims are unable to
strike back at the perpetrators. A brief look at the history of the
subject shows quite plainly that terrorism is without a doubt a real
and distinct tactic, one most frequently used by those who want to
wage war without suffering the consequences of counterattacks and
much less frequently a tactic used by the weak against the strong.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Goss</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The term "terrorism" is properly applied to violence directed
toward innocent noncombatants with the aim of creating a general
state of terror in the targeted population, as opposed to violence
directed against military targets. Whitbeck says that the U.S. uses
the term to "assert an absolute right to attack any country it
dislikes" and that "no one dares to criticize the U.S. for doing
whatever it deems necessary in its war on terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Is that so? There have, in fact, been demonstrations in Muslim
nations as well as in Europe and on dozens of U.S. college campuses,
not to mention newspaper headlines rivaling those that once announced
the Normandy invasion accusing the U.S. of "torture" at Camp X-Ray in
Cuba. Nothing like the Vietnam antiwar demonstrations, to be sure,
but then again, maybe the reason the criticism is muted by comparison
is simply that most non-Muslim people around the world happen to
agree with the U.S. policy.</TE>
<TE>   This is all bad enough, but Whitbeck doesn't stop until he hits
the ground. In the last paragraph, he accuses the U.S. of suspending
"all the rules of international law and domestic civil liberties." I
assume that his excuse for such hyperbole is that he has by now
worked himself up into a paroxysm of self-righteousness. I suggest
quite a few rewrites, tutoring in critical thinking and a Valium
before he again submits something for publication.</TE>

<LD>"Civil Liberties Take Back Seat to Safety" (March 10) seems to
suggest that American citizens are losing their civil liberties, by
making a point of how noncitizens are being detained for immigration
violations and suspicion of being part of a terrorist network.</LD>
<LD>   The reporters noted sympathetically how one student from an Arabic
country was being deported for a visa violation, and how unfair it
was, despite a previous Supreme Court ruling that judged otherwise.
The short history lesson I got was that American citizens suffer more
than their enemies when we try to protect ourselves against foreign
threats.</LD>
<LD>   The article states that "civil liberties have shrunk." Well, yeah,
3,000-plus Americans were murdered by foreign terrorists on American
soil on Sept. 11. That's why we went to Afghanistan to kill the
enemy.</LD>

<TE>   Your article claims that "the rights enjoyed by U.S. citizens have
grown to an extent that the founding fathers probably never
imagined." The writers should have added, "and would not have
approved."</TE>
<TE>   As the founding fathers understood rights, we have been steadily
losing them, during times of both war and peace, for much of the last
century. The founding fathers envisioned rights as guarantees of
opportunity, not results. What has grown is a set of privileges,
masquerading as rights, that guarantee results to members of
special-interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   Creeping erosion of the 2nd, 9th, 10th and parts of the 1st and
5th amendments to the Constitution have rendered them mere shadows of
their former selves. The founding fathers would be horrified to see
those rights, which they risked their lives to see recognized,
treated with such contempt.</TE>

<TE>   Thanks for putting some attention on our government's ocean of
silence concerning the Sept. 11 attacks ("Gains and Gaps in Sept. 11
Inquiry," March 10). There are many unanswered questions about the
rather odd sequence of events that occurred that day--and since. But
even your article fails to address a rather obvious one.</TE>
<TE>   If, as you say, there has been no (or little) information obtained
about the middle management responsible for the planning and staging
of the attacks, how can the administration be so certain that it all
leads back to Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda?</TE>

<LD>So, here we are in Any Big City USA. Some guy with a martyr complex,
a citizen of some Middle Eastern country, slips through the airtight
security surrounding actual citizens of our country, and he detonates
his suitcase nuclear device. So now what, Condoleezza Rice? Now what,
President Bush? Who gets the retaliation? No. 1 on the Bush
administration "hit" parade? The country where the terrorist is a
citizen? The country that provided him with the finances and security
clearance assistance? The country where his mother and father live?
How much of his DNA will need to be left for us to figure out where
to send our bomb? I mean, like, nuclear deterrence is a real
deterrent, duh?</LD>
<LD>   This country's administration is out of touch with reality. Who
feeds them their 80% approval statistics? I personally know no one
who approves of the Bush administration, and I do not live in a
narrow little world of look-alikes, think-alikes, worship-alikes.
These people need to be stopped before they permanently ruin our
country, our relationships with the international community and our
Earth. You go, Tom Daschle! You go, Michael Moore! Our country needs
you.</LD>

<TE>   For decades, U.S. defense policy against the Warsaw Pact rested
upon the threat of nuclear retaliation in the event of a massive
conventional attack against NATO. During the Persian Gulf War, the
U.S. did not exclude the use of nuclear weapons if Iraq deployed
chemical or biological weapons against U.S. troops.</TE>
<TE>   The willingness to use nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances is
essential to the credibility of America's global security policy.
Maintaining a nuclear arsenal without planning for the use--however
unwelcome--of such weapons defies logic. U.S. flexibility in
considering nuclear options is a bitter but critical tool in credibly
defending our national and allied interests in this new age of
catastrophic terrorism.</TE>

<TE>   Given the disingenuous backpedaling of Secretary of State Colin
Powell and Rice (March 11) and the curious assertion from Sen. John
Warner (R-Va.) that there are some (unspecified) new weapons of mass
destruction, it is likely that the decision to abandon the "no first
use" policy is part of the Pentagon's new disinformation effort. Rice
as much as admits this by claiming a deterrent effect, which could
not occur if the policy remained a secret.</TE>
<TE>   A plan of such massive stupidity is a sophomoric parody of "Dr.
Strangelove," but even as disinformation this plan provides the
rhetorical justification for many nations to reconsider nuclear
weaponry as part of their conventional arsenals. Nice job, guys!</TE>
<TE>   Maybe there are others in government who would benefit from Prozac
as much as the besieged Taliban did (March 11).</TE>

<TE>   What can you be thinking of with the screaming March 9 headline:
"U.S. Works Up Plan for Using Nuclear Arms"?</TE>
<TE>   Do you think the nations targeted, already unstable, do not read
newspapers? What do you think their reaction will be? Oh, dear? Or,
fire up the nukes and get in first.</TE>
<TE>   There are some things that should be kept within the purview of
Congress. This is one of them. You have chosen the path of
irresponsible reporting at its worst.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If the U.S. is seriously considering using nukes against even some
nonnuclear states (Syria, North Korea, Iran, Iraq), how can we
credibly demand that these or any other states not develop their own
weapons of mass destruction? If the U.S. ever had any claim to moral
leadership, the Nuclear Posture Review has destroyed it. Like the
Russians, I am wondering whether my (unelected) leaders have lost
touch with reality. They are making "Dr. Strangelove" look pale by
comparison to their own mad fantasies.</TE>

<LD>Re "Charter School in Flap Over Attendance," March 12: I must admit I
am somewhat concerned over the parents' and district's ability to
excuse inappropriate behavior and lack of responsibility on the part
of the students who had these excessive absences.</LD>
<LD>   I feel that, as an educator, we are constantly being asked to dumb
down our standards when, in fact, our society, i.e., the corporate
world, would not tolerate such behavior or excuses. Also, if parents
continuously come to the defense of their child and try to minimize
or rationalize their child's inappropriate behavior, the child will
be hurt emotionally because he or she will not be given the
opportunity to develop both maturity and responsibility.</LD>
<LD>   Children need to learn responsibility and that their behavior and
attitudes produce either positive or negative consequences. I applaud
the teachers at the school who made this tough decision and hope that
they will not back down and cave in to the "meddling" parents.</LD>

<TE>   I was a student at Pacific Palisades High from 1996 to 2000. I
think the attendance policy is fair and so is the appeal process. The
six-day policy in reality reflects 12 days in its impact, because
each class meets every other day due to block scheduling, where each
class is about 110 minutes. I did not have to appeal but know people
who did have to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   If students gave a doctor's note or airplane ticket to show where
they were, they won the appeal. The policy is there to stop people
from being truant. I had some of the teachers mentioned in the
article and support them, even though it is against district policy.
Also, this policy teaches responsibility, which is something our
society seems to shun lately.</TE>

<TE>   The controversy at Palisades High, centered on LAUSD guidelines
that say that students who hand in their work and make up tests
should pass regardless of attendance, brought back an unpleasant
professional memory. Some years ago, I attempted to fail a
12th-grader in my journalism class who, in the first 15 weeks of the
semester, had recorded more than 20 absences, had not completed 13 of
the 15 weekly assignments and had not passed the midterm. She had no
excuse other than laziness.</TE>
<TE>   Her parent got the principal's ear, and I was ordered to give this
girl makeup work (which she didn't complete). Justification for this
order was LAUSD policy that every student must be given a chance to
pass every class--even after 15 weeks of "zero" performance.</TE>

<LD>Re "Identity Theft Rampant, Officials Say," March 11: We have had two
cases of identity theft in our business, one in the amount of $56,000
and one in the amount of $250,000. In both cases the police
departments involved were absolutely uninterested in even taking a
report.</LD>
<LD>   In the first case, I was told that since the bank would reimburse
me for the forged checks that it was the ultimate loser and I had
absolutely no status in the case. Bank of America was also
uninterested in making a police report or following through, since
the amount involved was too small for it to bother.</LD>
<LD>   In the second case, we contacted everyone from the Secret Service
on down. Each agency told us someone else was responsible. In both
cases we were unable to find any government agency that was the
slightest bit interested. What is a citizen to do about this growing
problem?</LD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The United Methodist Church's mandatory retirement age of 70
discriminates against gifted and qualified pastors and should be
repealed, the church's Committee on Older Adult Ministries said.</LD>
<LD>   The 24-member committee plans to ask the church's highest
legislative body, the 2004 General Conference, to repeal the ban.</LD>
<LD>   The policy currently mandates that church pastors and laypeople
elected to church agencies retire at age 70.</LD>
<TE>   The panel cites two contradictory statements on the issue--the
church's Constitution that contains the age cap, and a resolution
passed in 1988 and upheld in 2000 that calls for the elimination of
the mandatory retirement.</TE>

<HD>Mean Season for Lakers, Clippers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>March used to be the time when the NBA dropped out of sight while the
NCAA tournament took over. But the Lakers and Clippers hooked up
Friday for a game that really mattered, with implications that could
be felt from now until late April.</LD>
<LD>   We can finally call Lakers vs. Clippers a rivalry now. The Lakers
can't just coast. They have to summon some championship-caliber poise
to win, as they did in Friday's 98-92 victory.</LD>
<LD>   And the Clippers won't back down to anyone. Michael Olowokandi was
even willing to go toe-to-toe with Shaquille O'Neal, as he did in two
little flare-ups that earned them a pair of double-technicals and a
late-game ejection. (Afterward, Olowokandi said that if O'Neal didn't
like players being physical against him, "He should grow up.")</LD>
<TE>   For the most part, things were cordial, though. Even the Lakers
had to smile at some of the Clippers' athletic feats, and there were
lots of handshakes and hugs afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always going to be a good game against us," Clipper forward
Darius Miles said. "I think they give us a lot of respect now....
Every time we play it's a fun game. We shake their hand after the
game, win or lose. They shake our hand after the game, win or lose.
It's going to be all right."</TE>
<TE>   In what might be the ultimate sign of respect, Phil Jackson
actually acknowledges the presence of the Clippers. He even thinks it
worth the time to send a message to them. When Jackson's ready to
engage in psychological warfare with a team, that's a sign it has
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   So here was Jackson, before Friday night's game against the
Clippers, looking ahead to a possible playoff matchup.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important, if we're in first and they're eighth, that we
have the ability to play them well enough to make them think about
the next time they play us," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to their previous meeting, a 95-90 Clipper victory,
Jackson said, "They came back off a game in which we really dominated
the first half and played a spectacular third quarter and were able
to gain some confidence about playing against us. We're going to have
to take that out of them if we want to recognize the fact that they
could be eighth and we could be first in our conference."</TE>
<TE>   Both teams came in right on the heels of their targets. The Lakers
were half a game behind the Pacific Division- and Western
Conference-leading Sacramento Kings (they caught them with the
victory), the Clippers half a game behind Utah for the eighth spot in
the West (they're now 11/2 behind after the Jazz won in Detroit).</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, we're to the point where Jackson is taking things
seriously. Come spring he often talks about sending messages, as if
he were endorsing a two-way pager. Jackson can go ahead and enter
mark.cuban@dallasmavs.com in his "to" field, because the Mavericks
come to Staples Center for another big showdown on Sunday. If there's
any contender that has major feelings of inadequacy about beating the
Lakers, it's Dallas. The Lakers hope to drive them back to the couch
for more therapy.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers are slowly erasing doubt. They've shown they can win
on the road, they've shown they can hang with the Lakers. Friday
night counted toward both categories, since this was officially a
Laker home game.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers weren't as caught up in the mind games and matchups
as Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get in the playoffs, we wouldn't care if we were playing
the New England Patriots," Gentry said. "We're just trying to get
there."</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons the Clippers have done so well without the
injured Lamar Odom is that Gentry has an easier time finding minutes
for Miles.</TE>
<TE>   Miles showed the total package Friday. He worked the baseline with
some polished moves. He D'd up Kobe Bryant and blocked three of his
shots. He threw down an alley-oop from Jeff McInnis. For a little
something extra, he tossed in a running three-pointer from 28 feet
just before halftime to give him 11 second-quarter points.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Miles' show, the Clippers hung in the game because they
worked the offensive boards to get 28 second-chance points. They used
to get destroyed in that category.</TE>
<TE>   They used to be the guys who got blown out of games, but it was
the Clippers who put together a 22-2 second-half run to turn a
10-point deficit into a double-digit lead.</TE>
<TE>   But the Lakers got back to executing their offense, so well that
even Jackson was satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   As far as previews go, this wasn't a completely accurate
indication of how the Lakers will fare in the playoffs, because they
won't be playing back-to-back games in the postseason. They were
coming off a game at Golden State on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But this could provide a glimpse of where they'll be seeded. The
Lakers have four sets of back-to-back games remaining.</TE>
<TE>   They have no more games against the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   Unless ...</TE>

<HD>Al Finally Pulled the String on Chucky</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU> Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Skip Bayless of the San Jose Mercury News, on Raider owner Al Davis:</LD>
<LD>   "Like Scrooge, Davis has seen a ghost the past four seasons--his.
For the first time since he took over the Raiders in 1963, Davis was,
in effect, forced off the stage by his head coach.</LD>
<LD>   "When Davis asked the mirror on the wall who was the slickest of
them all, it said, 'My man Chucky.' Jon 'Chucky' Gruden became the
snarling face of Raider Nation. Raider fans finally had the perfect
poster-boy coach--one who looked like the homicidal horror-movie
doll. Players loved Chucky almost as much as the fans.</LD>
<TE>   "But Chucky turned on his master. Davis lost his leverage in the
locker room and on talk shows. Davis became the doddering 72-year-old
who got in Gruden's way. No more."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Bayless: "Al Davis reclaimed front-and-center control of his
'Raiduhs.' Not only did he get rid of Gruden, but he 1) fleeced Tampa
Bay for two first-round picks, a second and a third, and $8 million;
2) said all the right things about Gruden, while Gruden said the
wrong things about Raider fans, alienating many; and 3) replaced
Gruden with the un-Gruden, Bill Callahan, the perfect low-ego coach
for Davis."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the men's NCAA West Regional single-game
record for blocked shots?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Attention! Florida officials removed a fan from the first day of
spring football practice after he refused to stand to watch the
Gators. New Coach Ron Zook has instituted a rule requiring coaches,
players and spectators to stand throughout all practice sessions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Zook: The Orlando Sentinel reports that not long after he was
hired, he told Athletic Director Jeremy Foley, "You need to get me a
cell phone that works in the shower. That'll give me 10 more minutes
to recruit."</TE>
<TE>   According to that paper, he is so hyper that when a reporter asked
him how much coffee he drinks, he chuckled and said, "Are you kidding
me? I drink coffee when I want to come down."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Next question: Texas Tech Coach Bob Knight, commenting on his new
workplace: "My wife has said, 'Nowhere in the world will people
understand [you] more than in West Texas.'" Asked by a reporter what
that meant, Knight said, "I don't try to interpret my wife. Do you
interpret your wife? That may be why I get along better with my wife
than you do with yours."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Space lady: Nancy Lopez, who announced she's retiring as a
full-time LPGA Tour player after this season, grew up in Roswell,
N.M., where some people believe a flying saucer crashed in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   She told USA Today a fan drew a connection between her and the
"incident."</TE>
<TE>   "This lady walked up to me and started staring at me," Lopez said.
"Then, she says, 'Are you an alien?'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Shaquille O'Neal of Louisiana State, 11, against
Brigham Young in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: University of Mississippi guard Dave Sanders on his
eating habits: "We don't have any McDonald's All-Americans. Now, I do
love to eat at McDonald's. If they counted all the money I spent at
McDonald's, then I'd be an All-American."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's should, at least, reward Sanders' loyalty with a free
Big Mac and fries.</TE>

<HD>It's Grin at All Costs for Bearcats</HD>
<DH>West: Even Huggins has to smile while watching Cincinnati
roll to 90-52 win over Boston University. Logan has 27 points.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Steve Logan on the layup. Logan from the baseline. Logan from the
lane, from the free-throw line, from 20 feet, from 22 feet, from 25
feet. Logan with the steal and the slam. Logan 23, Boston University
16 at halftime.</LD>
<LD>   And it was Cincinnati 90, Boston University 52 when this West
Regional first-round game was over. The Bearcats (31-3) are seeded
No. 1 and were not willing to give the No. 16-seeded Terriers of the
America East Conference an inch of breathing room, an ounce of hope.</LD>
<LD>   Cincinnati found an immediate weakness in the Boston defense:
everywhere that Logan went.</LD>
<TE>   The Terriers (22-10) lost to UC Irvine this season, lost to
Columbia, Vermont and Hartford. A nine-game winning streak against
fellow America East denizens did not prepare them for the fierce and
nonstop pressure applied by Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Logan would add only four more points in the second half to finish
with 27, plus eight assists and two steals. And still the crowd booed
when he scored his four more points.</TE>
<TE>   That's how out of hand the game was.</TE>
<TE>   "We played mostly for pride in the second half," Boston's Billy
Collins said. "Most of the guys knew we couldn't win the game."</TE>
<TE>   This was Cincinnati Coach Bob Huggins' 500th victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think I'd last this long," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the second half the Bearcats were doing a little
hot-dogging.</TE>
<TE>   "Give me the ball," shouted Bearcat forward Jamaal Davis. He was
standing 22 feet from the basket, unguarded. Logan had the ball.</TE>
<TE>   He thought about Davis' request. No Terrier seemed willing to
challenge Logan or Davis, so Logan flipped the ball to Davis and
Davis swished the three-point basket to put Cincinnati ahead, 54-22.</TE>
<TE>   A little smile tugged at the mouth of Huggins. Huggins never
smiles and he stopped before either Logan or Davis could see him. But
he did ... Huggins did smile.</TE>
<TE>   Logan, a senior from Cleveland who used to play in local gyms with
and against USC's Sam Clancy, is listed as 6 feet tall. He might be
5-10. His shorts nearly sweep the floor, they are so long and his
legs are so short. But Logan can create shots. And he can take jump
shots. And he always makes things happen.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his 23 points, Logan had three assists and a steal in the
first half. At one point he motioned to Terrier defender Kevin
Fitzgerald to come closer. Fitzgerald stood still, about two feet
away, so Logan shot the ball from 22 feet. The shot was good and
Logan grinned. Fitzgerald slapped his own head.</TE>
<TE>   When Logan stole the ball from Terrier star Chaz Carr and fed
Immanuel McElroy for a slam as Carr backed away, the score became
67-27 and the crowd at Mellon Arena booed. "Get your starters out of
there," a Boston fan shouted with 10:55 left.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA tournament isn't about coddling the weak, though. It is
about setting a tone.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the tone set.</TE>
<TE>   With 2:39 to play and Cincinnati leading, 88-47, Bearcat fans
behind the bench stood up and held up letters spelling
"Congratulations Coach Win #500."</TE>
<TE>   Huggins smiled again. Getting 500 wins is worth a grin.</TE>

<HD>Idol Thoughts Lift Creighton</HD>
<DH>Midwest: Taylor imitates Jordan with basket that gives
Bluejays 83-82 upset of Florida in double overtime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Maybe there's something in the floor boards at the United Center that
still springs magic for uniform No. 23.</LD>
<LD>   Friday, with the clock winding down and the game on the line,
Creighton guard Terrell Taylor took the ball at the top of the key,
did a crossover dribble and popped a three-point shot with 0.2 of a
second left to lift Creighton to an 83-82 double-overtime victory
over Florida in a first-round Midwest Regional game.</LD>
<LD>   "I swear," Taylor said afterward, "that before the game I watched
a DVD of Michael Jordan."</LD>
<TE>   Creighton (23-8) became the third No. 12 seed to defeat a No. 5,
joining the upset ranks with Missouri over Miami and Tulsa over
Marquette.</TE>
<TE>   Creighton advances to Sunday's second-round game against Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, No. 5 Florida needed a last-second shot to beat No. 12
Butler in the first round, then made a run to the national title game
against Michigan State.</TE>
<TE>   The Gators didn't get bailed out this time, though, ending their
disappointing season at 22-9.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no answer for Taylor," Florida Coach Billy Donovan said of
Creighton's junior guard.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor certainly played like Jordan, his idol. He led all scorers
with 28 points after finishing the first half without a point. He was
0 for 5 from behind the three-point line in the first half but made
eight of 10 long shots in the second half and the two overtime
periods.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad for a reserve, huh? That's right. Taylor earned the
Missouri Valley Conference's sixth-man award this year only because
Creighton Coach Dana Altman had benched the guard for disciplinary
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't do what we asked him to do over the summer and fall,"
Altman explained.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor did everything that was asked Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Florida seemed in control of the game when center Udonis Haslem's
two free throws gave the Gators an eight-point lead with 2:42 left in
regulation time.</TE>
<TE>   But two three-point shots by Taylor in the last 1:33 tied the
score at 69-69. It was tied again, at 73-73, after the first
overtime, but Florida appeared to have held off the pesky Bluejays
when Matt Bonner's basket and free throw with 45 seconds left gave
his team an 82-78 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, though, cut that lead to two with his basket with 35
seconds left, setting up the dramatic finish.</TE>
<TE>   Creighton got the ball back with 29.4 seconds left when Florida
guard Orien Greene was called for a five-second violation on an
inbounds pass.</TE>
<TE>   With 4.5 seconds left, Florida's Justin Hamilton nearly made a
steal against Ismael Caro but deflected the ball away and just
clipped the out-of-bounds line.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know how close that was," Donovan said.</TE>
<TE>   After a timeout, Creighton put the ball in play and Taylor made a
Taylor-made move on defender Brett Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   "I did a little crossover move and got a good look," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Good look?</TE>
<TE>   "Looked like a pretty contested shot to me," Altman joked.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan screamed for a technical foul after Creighton players left
the bench to celebrate with 0.2 of a second left, but didn't get the
call.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't see anybody run on the floor," Altman said with a grin.</TE>
<TE>   Florida tried a full-court pass but couldn't get off a final shot.</TE>
<TE>   Creighton was able to hang with the more talented Florida team by
making 13 of 30 three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the great equalizer in college basketball," Donovan said of
the three-point shot.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Korver, Creighton's leading scorer this season, finished with
16 points before fouling out.</TE>
<TE>   Haslem led Florida with 20 points.</TE>

<LD>AT ST. LOUIS</LD>
<LD>   Kentucky vs. Tulsa: The matchup between the fourth-seeded Wildcats
and the 12th-seeded Golden Hurricane is filled with story lines.
Kentucky Coach Tubby Smith got his first head job when Tulsa hired
him in 1991. He guided the Golden Hurricane for four seasons and
twice took them to the Round of 16. "It's always tough, it's always
emotional, when you play a team where you once worked," he said. He
also must be concerned about the focus of his Wildcats, known as Team
Turmoil this season. They played with unity and passion in their
opening-round rout of Valparaiso, but this year they have regularly
followed a superlative outing with a stinker. Said Wildcat guard
Keith Bogans: "We know in the past we've played good games and then
had letdowns.... We know we'll have our hands full." Tulsa is quicker
than Kentucky, but far smaller and without any of the NBA prospects
that litter the Kentucky roster.</LD>

<HD>No Opening-Round Encore for Hampton</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Most of the sellout crowd was roaring, hoping for a chance to see a
repeat of the celebration that became a television highlight staple a
year ago.</LD>
<LD>   No. 15-seeded Hampton was closing in on another victory over a No.
2-seeded team, looking to make Connecticut this season's Iowa State.</LD>
<LD>   The Huskies, however, intensified their defense over the final
three minutes and closed the game with a 7-0 run for a 78-67 victory
Friday in the first round of the East Regional at the MCI Center.</LD>
<TE>   "First thing: If that's a 15, what's a 14 or a 13 look like?" a
very relieved Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun said of Hampton. "We had
them put away three, four times in the first half, but there was no
quit in them. I am unbelievably impressed with them.</TE>
<TE>   "Down the stretch, I know everyone was rooting for David, but I
was pulling for Goliath."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Hampton stunned Iowa State, 58-57, to become only the
fourth No. 15-seeded team to win a first-round game. The postgame
celebration, with Coach Steve Merfeld swinging his arms and legs
wildly while being picked up from behind by a player, became one of
the most repeated film clips in NCAA tournament history.</TE>
<TE>   "We never felt we were going to lose that game, not before it, not
during it, not now," said Tommy Adams, who led Hampton with 23
points. "It's tough dealing with the loss, but Connecticut made stops
when they had to."</TE>
<TE>   Hampton (26-7) got within four points of the lead three times in
the second half, and trailed 71-67 with 3:08 remaining after a
breakaway dunk by Adams following a Connecticut turnover.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the crowd of 17,725 was cheering for the Pirates, but
Connecticut (25-6) shut them down on the final five possessions.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the Huskies' 10th without a loss in first-round
games under Calhoun.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Caron Butler led the Huskies with 21 points and center Emeka
Okafor had 12 points, 15 rebounds and five blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina State 69, Michigan State 58--The backdoor was
closed. The three-point shots weren't falling. North Carolina State
had only 18 points at halftime and leading scorer Anthony Grundy was
in foul trouble.</TE>
<TE>   So the Wolfpack turned to Plan B.</TE>
<TE>   With freshmen Julius Hodge and Ilian Evtimov leading the way,
North Carolina State took the ball straight to the basket. Converting
layups and three-point plays, the No. 7-seeded Wolfpack rallied from
a 12-point halftime deficit and won going away against the Spartans
in the second game at the MCI Center.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina State (23-10) plays Connecticut in Sunday's second
round.</TE>
<TE>   Hodge scored all of his 16 points in the second half, including
back-to-back three-point plays that tied the score at 37-37. Evtimov
had 10 of his 12 points after halftime.</TE>
<TE>   The Wolfpack shot 25% in the first half and 67% in the second to
win their first NCAA tournament game in 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad to have it end on kind of a sour note," Michigan State
Coach Tom Izzo said. "They didn't beat us with backcuts; they didn't
beat us with threes. They beat us with dribble-drives and free
throws. We took one option away, we took the second away and they
found a third one."</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State (19-12) shot a season-low 32%. Marcus Taylor--the
Big Ten's leading scorer at 16.8 points a game--had 18 but made only
five of 22 shots. The Spartans had reached the Final Four in each of
the previous three years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maryland 85, Siena 70--Juan Dixon is leaving nothing to chance in
his final NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   A determined Dixon scored 29 points as the top-seeded Terrapins
(27-4) cruised past the undermanned Saints (17-19). Maryland will
play Wisconsin--an 80-70 winner over St. John's--in the second round
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon, a senior guard, made 10 of 17 shots and all four of his
free throws. He drove to the basket, pulled up for jumpers and deftly
passed to open teammates when Siena double-teamed him.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to come out and be aggressive," said Dixon. "This
is my last time going through this, and I want to tell myself that I
went out being aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon turned a 10-point lead into a 50-31 advantage during a
three-minute stretch of the first half. First, he made two free
throws and made a three-point shot. He then drove to the basket and
passed to Tahj Holden, who was fouled on a dunk and made the free
throw.</TE>
<TE>   Siena, which had to win four games in the Metro Atlantic Athletic
Conference tournament and a NCAA tournament play-in game to reach the
field of 64, trailed in double digits throughout the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Prosper Karangwa, who scored a career-high 31 points in the
play-in victory against Alcorn State, was held to seven points on
three-of-eight shooting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin 80, St. John's 70--Bo Ryan had coached in plenty of NCAA
tournament games before Friday, winning four Division III national
championships at Wisconsin-Platteville. His first as a Division I
coach was something special.</TE>
<TE>   Using Ryan's trademarks of balanced scoring and taking care of the
basketball, Wisconsin (19-12) maintained control in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great thrill," said the 54-year-old Ryan, the Badgers'
third coach in as many years. "Personally, I've waited a long time to
be in a game like this. I didn't say much about that to the players,
but it sure is fun to be a part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Penney scored 19 points to lead five Wisconsin players in
double figures.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus Hatten had 28 points for St. John's (20-12) on 12-for-33
shooting.</TE>

<HD>Win Doesn't Upset Georgia</HD>
<DH>East: It avoids fate of other favored teams with 85-68
victory over Murray State.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>It turned out that two first-round upsets in Chicago were enough for
one day, but that didn't stop Georgia Coach Jim Harrick's heart from
racing a bit when the Murray State Racers briefly threatened to make
it three upsets in the four-game set.</LD>
<LD>   No. 14 Murray State held a one-point lead with 16 minutes left in
Friday's late game but No. 3 Georgia finished with a surge to earn an
85-68 win at the United Center.</LD>
<LD>   Georgia will face Southern Illinois on Sunday in a second-round
East Regional game.</LD>
<TE>   Murray State (19-13) actually hung tough well into the second
half, cutting the Georgia lead to 64-59 with 8:40 left on Justin
Burdine's basket, but several key shots by Georgia sophomore forward
Jarvis Hayes doomed any Murray State comeback hopes.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes finished with a career-high 31 points, while his brother
Jonas chipped in 14 off the bench in relief of center Steve Thomas,
who played only 16 minutes because of illness.</TE>
<TE>   "This was my first NCAA [tournament] game," Jarvis Hayes said. "I
just wanted to go out and make a statement."</TE>
<TE>   Georgia (22-9) also got a big game from sophomore point guard
Rashad Wright, who had 16 points, 10 assists and did a stellar
defensive job on Murray State star Burdine after Harrick made the
defensive switch midway through the first half.</TE>
<TE>   "Point guards help you in the NCAAs, believe me," Harrick said of
Wright.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, at UCLA, Harrick rode the heroics of point guard Tyus
Edney to the national championship.</TE>

<HD>Aztecs' Little 5 Run Into Big Ten</HD>
<DH>Midwest: Illinois looks like a title contender with a 93-64
victory over San Diego State.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>With the scent of Creighton's upset of Florida still wafting in the
rafters, upstart San Diego State took the United Center court Friday
afternoon against Illinois and proved, um, that the tournament
selection committee doesn't get everything wrong.</LD>
<LD>   Making use of its many advantages--height, skill, close-to-home
court--fourth-seeded Illinois knocked No. 13 San Diego State halfway
back to Sea World, 93-64, in a first-round Midwest Regional game.</LD>
<LD>   "When it happens, you want to take the drop-chute through the
floor and not talk to anyone," San Diego State Coach Steve Fisher
said.</LD>
<TE>   Illinois (25-8) advances to Sunday's second-round game against
Creighton, which defeated Florida in double overtime.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego State (21-12) watched from the locker room as Creighton
pulled off the upset and hoped to use it as "little-guy" motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought we could come out and do the same thing," Aztec
forward Randy Holcomb said. "We were anxious to get on the floor.
Maybe we should have waited a few more minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Holcomb, a Chicago native, watched Creighton's Terrell Taylor
score 28 points in the victory over Florida. Taylor wears uniform No.
23 in honor of Michael Jordan, and so does Holcomb.</TE>
<TE>   But the 6-foot-9 Holcomb was simply overmatched by Illinois'
interior strength and finished with only nine points, eight fewer
than his season average.</TE>
<TE>   "Most times, I'm one of the biggest guys on the court," he said.
"Tonight, I was a two-guard compared to those guys."</TE>
<TE>   Illinois led by only 15 points at the half but pulled away after
intermission like a bullet train from a station. The second half
became a three-point shooting and alley-oop pass exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois guard Frank Williams, trying to make amends for a subpar
season, conducted a second-half clinic and finished with 25 points
and eight assists while making five of six three-point shots. He made
three consecutive three-pointers in one stretch, giving Illinois a
24-point lead, then provided the trail-end lob pass on two thunderous
dunks by Luther Head that pushed the lead to 28. Head finished with
19 points.</TE>
<TE>   Al Faux led San Diego State with 27 points.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to explain his late-season resurgence, Williams said, "This
is a new season for us. Now is the time to go."</TE>
<TE>   Head's breakaway layup with nine minutes left put the Illini up by
37 points at 76-39 and prompted Coach Bill Self to empty the bench.</TE>
<TE>   After muddling through most of the regular season, Illinois now
has to be considered a title contender.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher said Illinois was by far the best team the Aztecs had
played this season, quite a statement considering San Diego State
lost at Duke by 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   "We were more competitive at Duke," Fisher said. "But they are a
great team. But what we saw today was a better team. That doesn't
mean Illinois is better than Duke."</TE>
<TE>   The Aztecs ended on a downer, but Fisher was quick to put the ugly
defeat in context. Three years ago, Fisher went 5-23 in his first
season as he rolled up sleeves and tried to rebuild the program from
scratch. The Aztecs improved to 14-14 last season and this season won
the Mountain West Conference's automatic bid and advanced to their
first NCAA tournament since 1985.</TE>
<TE>   "We've come a long way," Fisher said, "yet we all know we've got
miles to go."</TE>

including this pass by Damir Krupalija from his knees. The Illini led
by as much as 37.</CP>

<LD>   "If you cut that guy open you'll find wires and stuff inside him,"
Gentry said of Maggette. "It's looking good. He'll probably play in
another two weeks."</LD>
<LD>   That's good news for the Clippers, who have been without Maggette
since Feb. 22, when he went on the injured list because of two
dislocated bones in his right hand. He also has had arthroscopic
surgery on his left knee.</LD>
<TE>   Maggette's recovery from both injuries is progressing faster than
expected. Gentry suggested recently that the Clippers might be forced
to finish the season without Maggette, Lamar Odom and Keyon Dooling.</TE>
<TE>   Odom has a sprained right wrist and ankle and Dooling has a
sprained left ankle. Neither is close to returning to the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As expected, the Clippers signed Tremaine Fowlkes for the rest of
the season after the second of his 10-day contracts expired. Fowlkes
has replaced Maggette as the team's starting small forward. Maggette
had replaced Odom.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely feels good," said Fowlkes, who was playing with the
Columbus (Ga.) Riverdragons of the National Basketball Development
League when the Clippers signed him to a 10-day contract Feb. 23. "I
knew I could play at the next level. It was a question of being in
the right place at the right time."</TE>
<TE>   Fowlkes was averaging 5.2 points and four rebounds in nine games
before Friday's game against the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the Clippers, Dallas and San Antonio ahead, it was a bad time
to be down a power forward, so the Lakers activated Samaki Walker
from the injured list, in time for Elton Brand, Dirk Nowitzki and Tim
Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   "We could probably be one hair safer, waiting until Sunday," Laker
Coach Phil Jackson said. "But this is a good game [for him.]"</TE>
<TE>   Jackson thought Walker, who started at center Friday, played
decently against Brand in previous games. The Lakers go home-and-home
against the Mavericks on Sunday and Tuesday, then play the Spurs on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Jackson is convinced Robert Horry is fatiguing, despite
Horry's big rebounding numbers, 71 in his previous 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about tiring, Horry said, "I'm not. At least I don't feel
like it."</TE>
<TE>   Walker, who started the season's first 50 games, hyperextended his
right elbow on Feb. 17 in Portland. He was averaging seven points and
seven rebounds. Though there was some question if he would be
activated Friday, Walker pressed medical personnel on the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't bring any dress clothes to sit on the bench," he said,
laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Jelani McCoy returned to the injured list.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The disquieting images from Thursday's victory at Golden State
might have been Danny Fortson, screaming profanities from the bench
at Shaquille O'Neal as O'Neal put the game away from the free-throw
line.</TE>
<TE>   Fortson, in graphic language, questioned O'Neal's manhood. Asked
if anyone had called him that before, O'Neal smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "And got away with it? Never," he said. "But, you know, it's
playoff time. If it wasn't ... "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lindsey Hunter, who has played in 271 consecutive games, and Rick
Fox, who has played in 234 in a row, have the third and fourth
longest active streaks in the NBA. Shandon Anderson (398) and John
Stockton (342) rank first and second.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Ride Tides of March</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: They rally past Clippers, 98-92, and catch
Kings in West. O'Neal, Olowokandi ejected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thing is, the Lakers don't really do March, desperate Marches being
so Del Harris and all.</LD>
<LD>   But even they have felt the season change, from dreary to
something a bit more urgent, if not entirely encompassing. Heck,
they'd play along.</LD>
<LD>   So, on a Friday night when the playoffs felt near and the Clippers
were edgy, the Lakers pressed through their usual back-to-back
lethargy and stepped into a flat-footed tie with the Sacramento Kings
atop the Western Conference and Pacific Division.</LD>
<TE>   They beat the game-again Clippers, 98-92, before a polite Laker
crowd at Staples Center. Kobe Bryant scored 14 fourth-quarter points
to lead the Lakers back from a deficit of 10 points with less than
nine minutes left, and the Lakers scored 30 points to the Clippers'
14 in the final 8:11.</TE>
<TE>   "It had all the complexities of a Laker-Clipper game," Laker Coach
Phil Jackson said, smiling, after the teams shared six technical
fouls.</TE>
<TE>   In a game Shaquille O'Neal was unable to start because of a bout
with nausea and in which he lacked his usual touch around the basket,
Bryant scored 33 points after his own poor offensive start. His jump
shot began to fall halfway through the final period, a development
that then allowed him to attack the Clipper interior. Bryant and
Derek Fisher each hit a late, critical three-pointer and the Lakers
made nine of 12 free throws down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "Their best player beat us," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said. "We
can't let that happen.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just disappointed that we lost to Kobe at the end of the
game, because obviously he's going to take the big shots, especially
if Shaq's not in the game."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal and Clipper center Michael Olowokandi were ejected with 19
seconds left, both receiving the second of double-technical fouls for
shoving under the Laker basket. Earlier in the quarter, they received
technicals for the same conduct on the Clipper end. On the way off,
Olowokandi pointed toward the parking lot, becoming the second player
in two nights to call out O'Neal, beginning with Golden State's Danny
Fortson.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, by one witness's account, O'Neal was restrained from
storming the Clipper locker room in search of Olowokandi. Twenty
minutes after the game, O'Neal still sat near the players' parking
lot, awaiting Olowokandi, who never came.</TE>
<TE>   "Beat it," he said to a bystander. "You don't need to see this."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the sudden courage shown by opposing centers--Brad
Miller, Fortson and Olowokandi, in particular--O'Neal said, "The refs
let them do whatever they want, and then these bums think they can
play."</TE>
<TE>   He said he did not know when it would end against Olowokandi, who
made one of 10 shots for four points. Told Olowokandi had left,
O'Neal sighed, stood up and walked off.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll see him, though," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Laker theory was that Olowokandi was frustrated, shut down
after playing so well since the All-Star game. Olowokandi said
O'Neal, who had 16 points and 13 rebounds on a toe that burned again,
simply couldn't handle him.</TE>
<TE>   "He needs to grow up. He needs to understand people are going to
fight back," the Clipper center said. "We were going back and forth,
saying things. He was saying, 'Watch the [elbows].' He's being
catered to too much. He is big, he is strong. It's only fair that
other people match that strength.</TE>
<TE>   "He said I was bullying him. He does the same thing to everybody
else. He hits and then he wants to whine when he gets hit. We're not
going to back down. I really do hope we play them in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   These are contentious games, now that the Clippers aren't resigned
to losing.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers caught the Kings in the loss column for the second time
in about a week, so there was that. They have won 11 of 13, and the
schedule toughens in the final month, starting with two games against
Dallas in three days and San Antonio on Wednesday. They end the week
in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   As Jackson saw it, the last of four regular-season games against
the Clippers was critical only if the Lakers play themselves into
being the top-seeded team in the Western Conference playoffs and the
Clippers play past Utah for the eighth spot. And that is from where
the Clipper edge came. The Jazz won in Detroit, so the Clippers stand
11/2 games behind Utah.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers had won four in a row and seven of eight, but missed
a chance to beat a vulnerable team.</TE>
<TE>   They turned a 64-54 deficit into a 78-68 lead with a 24-4 run,
only for the Lakers to score the next 11 points for a 79-78 lead,
setting up their surge in the final six minutes.</TE>

<LD>How it must hurt you to have to run letters about USC's beloved
ex-Bruin Henry Bibby, instead of another half-dozen about Steve
Lavin, as you have run weekly for some time now. Lavin may not be the
coach of the century, but unless you haven't noticed, there aren't
many John Woodens and Coach Ks out there.</LD>
<LD>   There are ups and downs in most coaches' careers and USC's
inability to focus on North Carolina Wilmington will be one of the
downs for Coach Bibby, balancing out last year's surprise Elite Eight
finish.</LD>

<TE>   The latest issue of Sports Illustrated had arrived, bringing with
it predictions of a Trojan romp through the South bracket, including
a victory over Duke.</TE>

or questionable substitutions: Instead I blame Sports Illustrated.
Curses!</TE>

<TE>   On Thursday, before USC's game against North Carolina Wilmington,
Bill Plaschke lauds Henry Bibby, saying he is on the rise, the coach
of the future.</TE>
<TE>   Next day, after USC is upset, Plaschke blasts Bibby for poor
management of his players during the game.</TE>
<TE>   Which is it, Bill, does USC keep him or fire him?</TE>

<TE>   After beating UCLA, Arizona and Stanford (twice) this year, the
people over at USC were talking about building a basketball
tradition. After Thursday's disappointing performance, that tradition
can be summarized as "one and done."</TE>
<TE>   Someone should remind the Trojans that one Elite Eight appearance
does not make a tradition.</TE>

<TE>   Unfortunately, he was right.</TE>
<TE>   The good news (I guess) is that nobody in his right mind will try
to steal Henry Bibby from us now.</TE>
<TE>   The bad news is that the term "USC basketball" remains an
oxymoron.</TE>

<LD>   Just when you're looking forward to a quiet, painless season of
preordained ineptitude--a season where you've already thrown your
hands in the air before the first pitch of opening day--they reel you
in just a little. A gentle "well ... maybe" is whispered in your ear
by the itinerant muse of baseball fandom that flits into Los Angeles
every March until the end of July when the team is sunk and you can
swear you hear him giggling every time you open the morning sports
section.</LD>
<TE>   I am a sitting duck for the taunts of this mischievous wayward

because there's merit to their hope, and merit to one's hope is like

<LD>Can somebody please explain how the NCAA tournament selection
committee picks the teams for the "regional" brackets?</LD>
<LD>   USC is in the South Regional? Well, the Trojans are from Southern
California, so maybe that explains it. And North Carolina Wilmington
is definitely from the South, but they travel to Sacramento to face
the Trojans? Who thought that up?</LD>
<LD>   UCLA is in the West Regional, so that makes geographic sense. But
the Bruins play in Pittsburgh? That's not West, unless you live in
Philly. And the Bruins' first opponent is Mississippi. If the New
Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons can be in the NFC West, I guess
this makes sense.</LD>
<TE>   Tony Cortese</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The only sense I could make of the NCAA brackets was when I saw
that Sacramento is in the South and the Midwest. That explains why
the bureaucrats in the state capital never pay any attention to the
interests of anybody in the Pacific time zone. They're two or three
time zones away, so by the time somebody calls for help they're
already out to lunch. And they never come back.</TE>

<TE>   I don't wish to belittle those basketball teams in Duke's section
of the NCAA tournament draw, but how fairly done is a selection
process that makes it so obviously easy for any one team to waltz its
way into the Final Four?</TE>
<TE>   It appears that either the selection committee was incompetent and
the regional selections were accidental, or the selection committee
was competent and the regional selections were deliberately skewed.</TE>
<TE>   In either event, please award those august gentlemen prescription
eyewear. And, please, let's not hear that the selections were just
"luck of the draw."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis Redding</TE>
<TE>   Arcadia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The selection committee's bias against the West can be easily
quantified by looking at the average RPI of the top eight seeds in
each bracket. In the West's lower bracket, where they stuck Gonzaga,
the average RPI of the 2, 3, 6 and 7 seeds is 11.5. In the East upper
bracket, where they put favored Maryland, the average RPI of the 1,
4, 5 and 8 seeds is 23.0--or exactly double the West lower bracket!
The committee claims it bases its actions on RPI, not the polls, but
this shows the teams in the West got cheated if you look only at RPI.</TE>

<TE>   If Stanford is so opposed to the Pacific 10 tournament, then I
suggest that the Cardinal refuse the invitation next year. This will
save the alumni from wasting money on tickets to see such an
uninspired effort. With no band, cheerleaders, mascot, etc., Stanford
showed a total disregard for the great college atmosphere shown by
the other teams at Staples Center.</TE>

<HD>Oh, Those Bruins: What Will They Do?</HD>

<LD>By now it's a well-known fact that large numbers of UCLA fans have
taken to rooting against their beloved Bruins on the quite sensible
principle that six or seven years of Steve Lavin is preferable
to--yikes!--25 years. Imagine having to watch Lavin-ball in Pauley
Pavilion in 2020! Imagine the horror of having to listen to another
20 years of Lav's appalling gibberish in that jackhammer voice.</LD>
<LD>   But the true author of the decline and fall of the only two Bruin
sports that matter is Pete Dalis. His worst mistake, the one that
sealed the deal, was falling for tear-stained Steve during his
memorable crying jag after the NCAA tournament loss to Minnesota.
Dalis is the one who handpicked such notorious lemons as Walt
Hazzard, Jim Harrick, Lavin and Bob Toledo.</LD>
<LD>   He'll soon be retiring to the links of Bel-Air Country Club, and,
no doubt, we'll be hearing all sorts of sappy talk about "his
legacy." But has anyone considered the possibility that Dalis was a
Trojan "mole" all these years? Oliver Stone, call your office.</LD>

<TE>   Diane Pucin, did Steve Lavin run over your dog? Steal your purse?
Refuse to acknowledge you at a news conference? "Missing the NCAA
tournament would be a favor to most Bruin fans." [March 10] Did she
take a survey? Can I see her statistical sample?</TE>
<TE>   Rarely have I seen a column as vituperative as this one. It isn't
good enough if UCLA makes it through a round or two or three at the
NCAA tournament? Final Four or nothing this year, right Diane? No
wonder there is a "massive unhappiness bubbling among Bruin fans"
with this type of reasoning.</TE>
<TE>   More than 90% of the colleges in this country would be thrilled
with the six-year record of Coach Lavin. I am writing this before the
NCAA tournament begins because, whatever the outcome, Coach Lavin
will be back next year. And deservedly so. Unlike Ms. Pucin.</TE>

<TE>   Dear Steve,</TE>
<TE>   Don't worry about the mediocre record, the sloppy play,
inconsistent and unprepared players, and last-minute coaching gaffes.
Your job is safe.</TE>

<TE>   About the coaching (or lack thereof) at UCLA, I think I have the
solution. Would John Wooden be willing to donate a DNA sample for
history's first human clone? If you want the best, go for the
original. We have the technology!</TE>
<TE>   Tim Gaul</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a die-hard USC fan, I would love to see Bruin Coach Steve Lavin
get an ironclad lifetime contract, but let's face it, Lavin is
already gone.</TE>
<TE>   Wildroot Charlie's so-called "motion offense" is nothing more than
a euphemism for "coachless basketball." This variation of playground
hoops puts all the responsibility on the players and takes the
coaches off the hook. Have a bunch of high school All-Americans run
down the floor, look for the tall tree in the middle, and if he's not
open, pass it around until somebody gets an open look, then shoot it!</TE>
<TE>   No matter how far UCLA gets in this year's Big Dance, the Bruins
will have done it on pure athleticism with no help from that useless
bunch of suits and ties called a coaching staff. Even Arthur Murray
used to put footprints on the floor!</TE>

possible fake punt or field-goal attempt).</LD>

<LD>Lighten up, America. Charles Barkley's joke about Augusta National
lengthening its course for the Masters being an act of "racism" was
precisely that--a joke.</LD>
<LD>   This is the same guy who said he wanted to run for governor of
Alabama; who had the media believing he was going to make a Michael
Jordan-style comeback; and who, when he played for the Houston
Rockets, told reporters he wished the team would acquire a player who
had "a larger butt" than he did.</LD>
<LD>   Charles is going to continue to regale us with his bizarre
comments for as long as the media provide him a forum to do so.</LD>

<LD>   Oregon vs. Wake Forest: The Ducks beat the Demon Deacons, 67-66,
in the first round of the Rainbow Classic on Dec. 28, 1999. Wake
Forest started five seniors in beating Pepperdine, 83-74, and all
five played against Oregon two years ago. In the only other meeting
between the schools, Oregon beat Wake Forest, 76-58, in 1967. Today's
winner, though, advances to Madison, Wis., for the Sweet 16.</LD>

<TE>   Kansas vs. Stanford: By pushing top-seeded Kansas to the final
minute in the first round, 16th-seeded Holy Cross punctured the
Jayhawks' aura of superiority. That has given No. 8 Stanford
confidence heading into today's second-round game, and the Jayhawks'
vulnerability appears to be increasing. Star guard Kirk Hinrich, who
severely sprained his left ankle against Holy Cross, might not play
against Stanford. "It feels a lot better," said Hinrich, who
underwent treatment Friday and did not practice. Coach Roy Williams
said he would make a game-time decision on Hinrich after seeing him
in warmups today.</TE>

<HD>Mississippi St. Pulls Inside Job With Austin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>The low post was crowded early. Mario Austin didn't waste much time
clearing it out for himself.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-foot-9, 255-pound Austin scored 14 unanswered points during
a seven-minute first-half stretch, rallying No. 3-seeded Mississippi
State from an eight-point deficit to a 70-58 victory over McNeese
State in the first round of the Midwest Regional at American Airlines
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Austin finished with 25 points and nine rebounds. McNeese State
Coach Tic Price tried stopping Austin with an assortment of
defenders, including 7-foot-1, 210-pound Raynell Brewer and 6-11,
288-pound Larry Jackson.</LD>
<TE>   It didn't matter. Austin made eight of 13 shots--all from inside
the paint--despite being double and triple-teamed after 6-9 teammate
Michal Ignerski left the game with an injured right thumb midway in
the first half. Ignerski, the team's second-leading scorer, is
questionable for Sunday's second-round game against Texas--a 70-57
winner over Boston College Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest problem about Austin was that he showed up for the
game," Price said. "I was hoping the bus driver would take him to
another facility."</TE>
<TE>   Said Austin: "All I wanted to do was make their big men run. I
knew as long as I was running [my teammates] would find me because
their big men couldn't run with me."</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi State (27-7) struggled early to recapture the momentum
of last week's Southeastern Conference tournament championship run.
The Bulldogs trailed 21-13 nine minutes into the game, but used a
12-0 run to take a 31-25 lead at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Southland Conference champion McNeese State (21-9) fell behind by
as many as 19 points in the second half and finished with a
season-low point total.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Texas 70, Boston College 57--Freshman point guard T.J. Ford, who
led the nation in assists at 8.5 per game, showed another dimension
in leading the Longhorns (21-11) with 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   Ford, who also had seven assists, got the Longhorn offense going
early, setting up fastbreak layups and three-pointers while pulling
up for several jumpers that resulted in baskets and helped Texas take
a 22-point lead three minutes before halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Boston College point guard Troy Bell, who broke out of a four-game
scoring slump with 27 points, led a rally that cut Texas' lead to
five with 12:48.</TE>
<TE>   But Ford scored five consecutive points and the Longhorns
maintained a double-digit lead the rest of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We went a while without scoring and I knew I had to do something
for my teammates," Ford said. "I just started attacking the defense."</TE>
<TE>   Boston College (20-12) made its earliest exit from the NCAA
tournament in its last 10 trips.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andrei Kirilenko knew he was getting a chance because of rare
circumstances Friday night, and he made the most of it.</LD>
<LD>   Kirilenko started in place of the ill Karl Malone and scored a
career-high 27 points to lead the Utah Jazz to a 100-97 victory over
the Detroit Pistons at Auburn Hills, Mich.</LD>
<LD>   "We knew that with Karl out, everyone on the team had to play over
the top," the rookie said. "He's our leader on offense and our leader
on defense. But this was a big game, and we really needed to win it.
I want to play in the NBA playoffs."</LD>
<TE>   Utah ended a four-game losing streak despite the absence of
Malone, who had flu-like symptoms and missed a game for health
reasons for the first time in nearly 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   Donyell Marshall and Jarron Collins added 16 each for Utah, while
John Stockton had 14 points and 10 assists.</TE>
<TE>   "Karl's a Hall of Famer and our best player, so one guy isn't
going to replace him," Collins said. "Every guy on the team has to
step it up when he's not on the floor."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Stackhouse, who missed Detroit's previous game with hip and
shoulder injuries, led the Pistons with 24 points, and Cliff Robinson
had 19.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit opened a 96-90 lead with less than three minutes to play
after a jumper and a three-point basket by Jon Barry. Utah tied the
score at 96 when John Starks and Stockton hit consecutive three-point
baskets.</TE>
<TE>   After Collins drew a charge on Damon Jones, Starks missed a jumper
but Collins grabbed the rebound. Stockton hit the go-ahead basket
with 40 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz made enough free throws down the stretch to secure the
win, and Stackhouse couldn't get a good shot off before the final
buzzer.</TE>

<TE>   Orlando 124, Denver 102--Tracy McGrady had 30 points, nine

<HD>Falcons Sign Dunn for Six Years, $28.5 Million</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warrick Dunn thinks he'll have no problem sharing the spotlight in a
backfield that includes Michael Vick and Jamal Anderson.</LD>
<LD>   After signing a six-year, $28.5-million contract with the Atlanta
Falcons on Friday, Dunn talked about the relationships he envisions
with his new teammates. Dunn will advise Vick, last year's No. 1
overall draft pick, to be patient as the starting quarterback.</LD>
<LD>   "He has skills," Dunn said. "It's just a matter of time.</LD>
<TE>   "When they develop, it's going to be scary. Let's just hope they
develop."</TE>
<TE>   The Falcons, who have gone 16-32 over the last three years, are
promising Dunn he'll get the ball between 20 and 25 times a game.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson led the Falcons to the Super Bowl in 1998 but is coming
off his second reconstructive knee surgery in three years. Last month
he agreed to a restructured contract that will pay him $2 million
instead of $5 million and delay a bonus that helped the Falcons save
$3.5 million under the salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's cap charge for 2002 is $4.5 million, which further
fuels speculation he could be cut. But Anderson indicated he wants to
work with Dunn.</TE>
<TE>   "[Atlanta Coach] Dan [Reeves] asked me what I thought of a new
back coming in like Warrick," Anderson said. "I like him. It's like
this--I'm the mail, and Warrick can be FedEx. I can do the heavy
lifting. When you need a quick strike, Warrick is your guy."</TE>
<TE>   The Falcons also announced that Joe Gibbs is one of three new
minority owners.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots signed kicker Adam Vinatieri, whose 48-yard field
goal as time expired gave the franchise its first Super Bowl
championship, to a multiyear contract.... The Indianapolis Colts
re-signed tackle Tarik Glenn, their designated franchise player, to a
six-year, $30-million contract, including a $10-million signing
bonus.... Unrestricted free-agent running back James Allen, a
1,000-yard rusher for the Chicago Bears in 2000, signed with the
Houston Texans.</TE>

Sporting News radio network to host a daily show that will be
broadcast in Los Angeles on KMPC (1540) from 7-9 a.m. beginning March
25.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Brennan, president of the Sporting News network, said that
negotiations with Brown had been ongoing, and when Jay Mariotti and
Jim Litke left the network Thursday, it created an opening for Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Since Mariotti and Litke were doing a four-hour show, the 9-11
a.m. time slot still needs to be filled, and Brennan said an
announcement about that would be forthcoming.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine men's volleyball assistant coach Jeff Stork, a
three-time U.S. Olympian, was hired as the women's head coach at Cal
State Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   Stork beat out four other finalists for the job, which opened when
Lian Lu retired in December after eight seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Stork will remain with the Waves while working on a part-time
basis at Northridge until the end of the current men's season.</TE>
<TE>   Stork was the setter on the gold medal-winning 1988 U.S. Olympic
team. He also was a 1992 and 1996 Olympian.</TE>

<LD>Now that Bob Knight has thrown out his ceremonial first-round defeat,
can we finally get this NCAA tournament started?</LD>
<LD>   For 40 days and 40 Knights, the sport of college basketBob has
been held hostage by a glower and a sweater. Every time you tuned
into ESPN, you were pummeled with shameless wall-to-wall huckstering
for a very bad movie about Bob Knight. ("Brian Dennehy is Bobby
Knight!" It was a laugh riot.) With your season on the brink of
madness, you switched over to CBS, which couldn't stop plugging a new
show featuring a star who startles grown-ups with his infantile
behavior and the unbelievable words that come out of his mouth--yet
one more Bob Knight vehicle, evidently.</LD>
<LD>   "Baby Bob," CBS is calling it.</LD>
<TE>   Friday night, the cross-promotion got a little out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   First you had No. 6 Texas Tech against No. 11 Southern Illinois in
the East Regional. Bob Knight favored in a first-round game. Amazing.</TE>
<TE>   Then CBS interrupted it, frequently, with promos for "Baby Bob." A
television program about a baby boy who talks like an adult. Amazing.</TE>
<TE>   But not quite as amazing as CBS play-by-play broadcaster Tim
Brando telling viewers waiting for the second half of Texas
Tech-Southern Illinois, "When Baby Bob opens his mouth, you won't
believe your ears. Here, we have Big Bob."</TE>
<TE>   Big Bob getting another Big L in the opening round of the Big
Dance. After losing four first-rounders in his last six NCAA
appearances with Indiana, Knight opened his Texas Tech tenure with a
76-68 defeat to the mighty Salukis, champions of the Missouri Valley
Conference, pride of Carbondale.</TE>
<TE>   Big Bob was headed for summer hiatus, but CBS couldn't stop
plugging.</TE>
<TE>   With Tech down by nine points midway through the second half,
Brando began musing about the Red Raiders' most recent game, a
40-point loss to Kansas in the Big 12 conference tournament.
Ordinarily, this wouldn't qualify as a positive for a team heading
into the NCAAs. Unless, according to Brando, that team is lucky
enough to have its bench graced by the Wizard of Lubbock.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many coaches out there who would love to have the
knowledge to prepare a team after that kind of loss," Brando
rhapsodized. "You want it to end and end quickly and move on to the
next game. The accomplishment of this team, [going] from nine wins to
23, is pretty incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, but what about those first-round losses? Brando couldn't
ignore them, not when a graphic listing them all was soon staring him
in the face.</TE>
<TE>   He could, however, try to alibi them away.</TE>
<TE>   "But those years were in Indiana," Brando said. "[This is] a
refreshing breath of new Texas air for Bob Knight."</TE>
<TE>   And: "You know, I've always felt this way about those types of
stats--you have to get there a lot to create those types of numbers.
And he's been there many, many times."</TE>
<TE>   Knight was about to lose for the seventh time in nine NCAA games.
This time, he would lose to Southern Illinois Coach Bruce Weber, a
longtime Purdue assistant. Brando attributed Weber's success Friday
night to "all those years coaching against Knight." Well, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, as the last seconds ticked down on the Red Raiders'
season, Brando christened it "a remarkable year for Bob Knight....
You talk about the perfect fit. I think that new sweater does fit
well in Lubbock."</TE>
<TE>   Right about then, Steve Lavin was in Pittsburgh, giving his UCLA
players final instructions before their NCAA opener against
Mississippi--and probably wondering what he has to do to get Brando
as his play-by-play man.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he had Verne Lundquist, who described Lavin as "the
much-criticized UCLA coach ... the topic of incessant conversation on
radio talk shows in Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   Lundquist and his partner, Bill Raftery, had done their homework.
They were also in the process of watching the Bruins slice
Mississippi's defense to shreds. That type of talent, coupled with a
19-11 regular-season record, does tend to get UCLA observers
conversing incessantly.</TE>
<TE>   "He does take some heat, doesn't he?" Raftery said of Lavin.</TE>
<TE>   "He enjoys what he's doing, he enjoys his team and they seem to
enjoy him. Everybody expects so much; we all know what John Wooden
accomplished. I think it's the toughest job in the country. Nobody
has forgotten the past."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin won this one, 80-58. Nobody still has forgotten the past. Or
the temperature on the thermostat. All this victory did for Lavin was
buy him some time, until Sunday's better-win-it-or-else matchup
against the West Region's No.1-seeded team, Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   The final buzzer was still ringing in his ears when Lavin shook
hands with Mississippi's 36-year-old coach, Rod Barnes. Sizing up the
scene, Lundquist described them as "two young men in a profession
that will make you age in a hurry."</TE>
<TE>   One of them does have a knack for winning first-round NCAA games.
Maybe that doesn't count for much in Westwood. But it does one-up a
certain legend in Lubbock now getting ready for fishing season.</TE>

<LD>UCLA owns L.A. again.</LD>
<LD>   The weekend belongs to the Bruins, the cavorting, slamming,
cramming, jamming Bruins who left skid marks on the backs of the
Mississippi Rebels on Friday night in an NCAA West Regional
first-round game at Mellon Arena.</LD>
<LD>   USC has been exposed and deposed. Pepperdine is a pleasant memory.</LD>
<TE>   Whoosh. Mississippi was left behind, an 80-58 loser, a cipher from
almost start to finish, a team chosen by the NCAA to play patsy, to
feed into UCLA's oh-so-certain opinion that it would, as usual, be
UCLA once the tournament started.</TE>
<TE>   So it is into the second round of the NCAA tournament for the
Bruins, who last we saw were leaving Staples Center with their heads
down, their faces long, their words argumentative, their spirits
sagging.</TE>
<TE>   "We gotta keep on doing this 40-minute thing," said freshman Dijon
Thompson. It was as if Thompson had discovered the theory of
relativity. He spoke in wide-eyed wonderment. Yes, basketball games
last 40 minutes and playing hard and well for all of those minutes
can offer surprising results.</TE>
<TE>   Rico Hines, a fifth-year senior and leader of UCLA's five-man
second unit on this evening, spoke passionately of having printed the
words "Final Four" on his sneakers. "One of my goals six years ago
when I decided to come to UCLA was to get to the Final Four," Hines
said. "My roommate from high school, Nate James (Duke), he has a
ring. My good friend Cameron Dollar, he has a ring. They both told
me, 'Just be a leader up there. We all have rings and you don't.'"</TE>
<TE>   So the Bruins have found their legs, their hearts, their love of
the game, their free spirits, their enthusiasm. It showed up in
practice Thursday when Hines and Billy Knight were diving across the
scorer's table for loose balls. It showed up even earlier, last
Sunday, when the Bruins arrived for practice before the NCAA bids
were announced, focused and convinced they would get a bid and that
they could prove deserving.</TE>
<TE>   There is no denying that UCLA has talent. "This is a Final Four
team," said a media member who watched the Bruins' second team, the
one with the freshmen, step up and shoot with confidence. It would
have taken too long to explain about California at the Pac-10
tournament or Arizona State at Pauley or all the other mysterious
dead spots the Bruins hit during the bumpy season.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," an Ole Miss fan said when Dan Gadzuric nearly pulverized
the rim and the backboard on one of his dunk shots. Wow, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins had fun. Before the game the players gathered in a
circle, arms around each other, laughing and dancing in the tunnel
leading to the floor. They were kids, just kids, about to run onto a
court and play some ball.</TE>
<TE>   After the opening tip, they scattered as if they were pool balls
knocked out of the rack by a cue stick. They tumbled about in no
particular direction. They threw the ball away, they threw it in the
basket, they outjumped some rebounds, they stole some others, they
almost gave away all of a 15-point lead in less than two minutes, but
they gained most of it back in two more minutes.</TE>
<TE>   It was breathless basketball played in waves. Coach Steve Lavin
was substituting five players at a time. An entire team--Jason
Kapono, Knight, Gadzuric, Matt Barnes, Cedric Bozeman--knelt at the
scorer's table once in the first half. They were called back to the
bench as the backups--Thompson, Andre Patterson, Ryan Walcott, T.J.
Cummings and Hines--kept scoring. And then the backups gave up a
couple of open shots and the starters were back on their knees at the
scorer's table. The starters came back, made some stops, made some
baskets, made some plays.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half, when the backups were back in, Hines was
giggling, Walcott laughing from deep in his belly, Patterson and
Gadzuric exchanging high-fives after Cummings jumped about 20 feet to
cram down a slam dunk.</TE>
<TE>   This game was a catharsis, a purging of all the bitterness of the
last two weeks. This game was a pin taken to the balloon surrounding
the memory banks.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, in a torrent, the Bruins remembered they could play this
game.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly Knight remembered he could shoot. Thompson recalled he
had spring in his legs and a light touch around the basket. Barnes
stood at center court talking to Thompson, a senior counseling a
freshman, a veteran giving the rookie some tips.</TE>
<TE>   "We just flew towards the ball," Hines said. "Hopefully we'll have
that total team effort again."</TE>
<TE>   Knight, who had a game-high 21 points, spoke about what the
postseason means. "You hear all this talk about how teams are hot
coming into the tournament," Knight said, "but that doesn't mean
anything. It's what you do once you get here."</TE>
<TE>   That's maybe not the lesson you'd want young men to learn. That
just getting by until March is OK. But the Bruins of Lavin keep doing
that. Just getting by, then rolling themselves out to turn
expectations into triumphs.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the Bruins will still pay a price for bobbling the regular
season. They played themselves down to a No. 8 seeding and now will
confront a fierce, proud top-seeded team, Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   During the postgame media session, it was announced that the
Cincinnati-UCLA game would be all alone on the agenda Sunday, a
single game televised to the entire nation. Knight raised his
eyebrows and smiled. It was happening just like always. The spotlight
is bright and the Bruins can count to 40. Minutes that is.</TE>
<TE>   Drives you crazy, doesn't it Bruin fans? But here they are, stars
again.</TE>

<DH>College basketball: Winning seasons not enough at Fresno
State, and coach finally retires at 71.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Weary of turmoil--and worn out by more losses this season than anyone
could have expected--Jerry Tarkanian retired as Fresno State's
basketball coach Friday at 71.</LD>
<LD>   "You know what is so painful--and unless you're a coach, you don't
really understand this--is, you're in the hotel room and getting
ready to go to the game ... and you figure, 'God, we're the
underdog,'" Tarkanian said.</LD>
<LD>   "My last 10 years at UNLV, we lost 33 games. This year I lost 15.
You figure that one out."</LD>
<TE>   Tarkanian was almost as famous for his battles with the NCAA as he
was for the running, pressing Nevada Las Vegas teams that went to
four Final Fours and won the 1990 NCAA title.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, the bald, droopy-eyed coach known as Tark the
Shark leaves behind a legacy as one of the greatest coaches not yet
in the Hall of Fame--an honor that has eluded him in no small part
because of persistent NCAA recruiting allegations and his players'
legal scrapes.</TE>
<TE>   Tarkanian ends his career with 778 major-college victories after
losing to Temple in the National Invitation Tournament on Wednesday,
the final game of a 19-12 season he had once hoped might take him to
one last Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   After four decades, Tarkanian finally had enough.</TE>
<TE>   Few coaches have ever outdone him.</TE>
<TE>   The only ones who won more Division I games are Dean Smith--who
holds the record of 879--Adolph Rupp, Bob Knight and Lefty Driesell.</TE>
<TE>   His winning percentage--the highest in history when he left UNLV
in 1992--ranks fifth at .794, behind Clair Bee, Rupp, John Wooden and
Roy Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Tarkanian ended his career by returning to his alma mater, taking
Fresno State to the NCAA tournament twice in his seven seasons at the
school.</TE>
<TE>   But he will be remembered for the days at UNLV when Runnin' Rebel
games began with indoor fireworks and drew ritzy fans to courtside
seats known as Gucci Row.</TE>
<TE>   "He had great athletes, they loved to run, and defensively no one
got kids to work any harder, I don't think, than Tark did," said
Arizona Coach Lute Olson, a rival for most of their careers after
taking over a Long Beach State program Tarkanian had left behind, on
probation, in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   Duke's Mike Krzyzewski--the opposing coach in two of the defining
games of Tarkanian's career--called Tarkanian's record amazing.</TE>
<TE>   "He was consistently excellent for a long period of time,"
Krzyzewski said. "In the late '80s, they were one of the two or three
to beat.</TE>
<TE>   "Jerry had consistent high levels of success because his teams
played hard defensively. He's one of the truly remarkable defensive
coaches."</TE>
<TE>   Duke was on the losing end of the biggest margin in NCAA
championship game history in 1990--a 103-73 UNLV victory led by Larry
Johnson, Greg Anthony and Anderson Hunt, the most valuable player of
that Final Four who never made it in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, in one of the great upsets in Final Four history,
Duke beat an undefeated UNLV team that had won its games by an
average margin of almost 28 points, defeating the Rebels in a
semifinal game.</TE>
<TE>   NCAA scrutiny accompanied Tarkanian nearly his entire career.</TE>
<TE>   "I always say that I shouldn't talk about the NCAA and I always
do," he said. "They've been my tormentors my whole life. It will
never stop."</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA tried to suspend Tarkanian for two years in the late
1970s, but he never sat out, taking his fight to the U.S. Supreme
Court before losing.</TE>
<TE>   UNLV eventually struck a deal with the NCAA to allow the Rebels to
defend their 1990 title, accepting ineligibility for postseason play
in 1992 as punishment for the alleged recruiting violations that
dated to 1977.</TE>
<TE>   But after a picture of three former UNLV players in a hot tub with
convicted sports fixer Richard Perry was published in 1991, Tarkanian
agreed to leave UNLV after the 1992 season--an agreement he
unsuccessfully sought to rescind.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, UNLV was put on three years' probation for alleged
violations involved in Tarkanian's recruitment of Lloyd Daniels.</TE>
<TE>   Tarkanian got a small measure of satisfaction in 1998 when the
NCAA settled a decades-old lawsuit by paying him $2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Though Tarkanian's legacy is linked to Las Vegas, he had made his
mark in Southern California much earlier.</TE>
<TE>   At Riverside City College, he won three consecutive state junior
college titles in the 1960s before moving to Pasadena City College,
where he won another.</TE>
<TE>   Long before he became known for pressure man-to-man defense, he
was known for a ferocious zone.</TE>
<TE>   "His zone in those days was the toughest thing I ever saw," said
Bill Mulligan, who came up through the high school and junior college
coaching ranks with Tarkanian and coached against his UNLV teams when
he was at UC Irvine. "As far as how he's changed the game, it's hard
to imagine that prior to UNLV, Tark was a 1-2-2 zone man, slow it
down. Then he got to Vegas and it became a track meet."</TE>
<TE>   Mulligan, who considers Tarkanian a friend, wonders at some of the
players Tarkanian accepted. The behavioral problems seemed to grow
worse during his time at Fresno State.</TE>
<TE>   "His philosophy is, 'There are no bad boys,'" Mulligan said. "He
really feels that way. He's very sincere about that. He's not a
phony. With the guys he gets, I didn't think he needed to do that. I
thought he could get a better class of kids."</TE>
<TE>   Speculation about possible replacements includes UC Irvine Coach
Pat Douglass, Brigham Young Coach Steve Cleveland and UCLA assistant
Jim Saia.</TE>

<HD>Sampras' Weapons Don't Desert Him</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>Pete Sampras was huddled in his courtside chair with a towel hanging
over his head on changeovers, hiding out from the chilling desert
winds with gusts up to 30 mph.</LD>
<LD>   This hardly would appear to be the place for Sampras to pull
himself together. For years, he joked about the desert curse.
Ordinarily, the cold, the desert and the wind would combine for a hat
trick of doom.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Sampras turned in his best result since reaching the U.S.
Open final in September. He defeated Rainer Schuettler of Germany,
6-2, 6-4, in the quarterfinals of the Pacific Life Open on Friday
night at the Tennis Garden, producing some sharp groundstrokes
designed to please his new coach Jose Higueras for a few minutes.</LD>
<TE>   In today's semifinals, the 10th-seeded Sampras will face the
player who defeated him in the Open final, No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt of
Australia. Hewitt and Sampras are 4-4. In the other semifinal, No. 9
Tim Henman of Great Britain meets 31-year-old Todd Martin, a
wild-card entrant. Martin, who upset No. 2 Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia, 7-6 (5), 6-3, in the quarterfinals, is 3-3 against Henman.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt, Martin and Henman played during the day. Sampras might as
well have been in another tournament with the evening temperatures
falling below 60 degrees. His serve was broken once, late in the
second set, but he saved six break points.</TE>
<TE>   "Very cold," Sampras said. "It reminded me of playing Hamburg a
bunch of years ago when it was cold and windy. It was pretty nasty
out there. We were both struggling. Under the circumstances, I felt
like I hit the ball very well and moved very well."</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt presents a vastly different challenge. Sampras felt he came
in to the net too often at the U.S. Open and needs to pick his spots,
saying Hewitt is "oozing with confidence right now.</TE>
<TE>   "He's playing the best tennis probably right now," Sampras said.
"He's serving well and we all know about his return of serve, passing
shots and his wheels."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, ESPN commentator Cliff Drysdale said Hewitt had the walk
of invincibility, but Hewitt, though on a nine-match winning streak,
wasn't buying it. Drysdale's words came when Hewitt was making a good
player, Thomas Enqvist of Sweden, look rather ordinary in their
quarterfinal, winning, 6-4, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   "A bit silly maybe," Hewitt said of the concept.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he couldn't envision the way the walk would look. Arrogant,
perhaps?</TE>
<TE>   But Hewitt, who is 32-4 since the start of the U.S. Open, doesn't
display arrogance after his matches. Nor do Martin and Henman. Hewitt
speaks about taking it "one match at a time." Martin won't even
promote his own cause for the U.S. Davis Cup team.</TE>
<TE>   As for Henman, Martin issued genuine, extensive praise about his
semifinal opponent, saying the Briton was one of his favorite guys on
the tour.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the self-effacing semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Henman advanced after a ragged start, defeating Gaston Gaudio of
Argentina, 6-3, 6-2, and Martin beat Kafelnikov for just the third
time in 10 matches.</TE>
<TE>   Martin was two for two on break-point opportunities, and saved 10
of 11 break points. The way he's playing, it is hard to believe he
needed a wild card.</TE>
<TE>   "I called up and begged," Martin said. "Fortunately, I was able to
sneak in ahead of one of the young guys who would also have been a
prospective wild-card candidate. I'll be sending Christmas cards to
both of them for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Kafelnikov thought he played better than Martin, and Martin
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I did a little post-match interview on the court, and I said the
same thing," Martin said. "I think Yevgeny probably did outplay me.
[But] during those critical moments, he didn't outplay me."</TE>
<TE>   Of the semifinalists, Hewitt looked the most in control. His only
out-of-control moment was when his forehand bounced off the net post
and hit a 13-year-old ball girl in the face. A concerned Hewitt asked
her how she was and later met her in the players' lounge.</TE>
<TE>   "She looked like she had a delayed reaction a little bit," Hewitt
said. "First off, it had hit her. I don't think she realized what had
quite happened, then she probably felt the pain. I just asked her a
couple of times if she was all right. She said yes a couple of times.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she was trying to hold back the tears on national TV."</TE>

<HD>Knight Has Another Bad Day</HD>
<DH>East: Coach is 2-7 in last seven NCAA appearances after his
Texas Tech team falls to Southern Illinios.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The kids executed the offense beautifully, played stifling defense,
outhustled their opponent and did the little things their demanding
coach demanded.</LD>
<LD>   And you know what?</LD>
<LD>   There wasn't a thing Bob Knight could do about it.</LD>
<TE>   Crowning a monumental day in Chicago for the Missouri Valley
Conference, No. 11 Southern Illinois sent No. 6 Texas Tech packing
Friday with a 76-68 victory at the United Center in a first-round
East Regional game.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Illinois (27-7) will play Georgia on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Southern Illinois played both smarter and harder than
we did," said Knight, Texas Tech's coach.</TE>
<TE>   Knight's team, which finishes 23-9 one year after going 9-19,
bowed out of the NCAA tournament with hardly a whimper. Since his
last Sweet 16 appearance with Indiana in 1994, Knight is 2-7 in seven
NCAA tournament appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Illinois took it to Texas Tech at both ends of the court,
on offense and defense. The Salukis' smothering defense and intensity
held Texas Tech to 38.8% shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The game started with the focus on the controversial Knight,
entering the tournament on a wave of publicity after his successful
first season in Lubbock. Knight, though, was somewhat subdued on the
bench and the focus quickly turned to the better team.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-year Southern Illinois Coach Bruce Weber saw plenty of the
opposing coach when Knight was at Indiana and Weber was a longtime
assistant at Purdue under Gene Keady.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Weber said Keady offered some words of encouragement in
preparation for his game against Knight.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Don't let that S.O.B. beat you,'" Weber said Keady.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Southern Illinois played tougher than Texas Tech and
wore the Red Raiders down.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted a chess match but we had to out-tough them," Weber
said.</TE>
<TE>   Knight has the reputation as the staunch disciplinarian, but it
was Weber who made the hard decision to bench two stars, Rolan
Roberts and Jermaine Dearman, for the start of Friday's game because
they showed up late to a practice this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't sleep that night over the decision," Weber said. "But
it's over and done with. I hope they learned a hard lesson. We
survived it."</TE>
<TE>   More than survive, Dearman and Roberts responded with big games.
Dearman finished with 17 points and 11 rebounds; Roberts had 12
points and four rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Dearman and Roberts dominated inside and allowed teammates to shut
down Andre Emmett, one of three Texas Tech scoring cogs who average a
combined 50.5 points. Emmett finished with nine points and made only
four of 17 shots. Center Andy Ellis and forward Kasib Powell each
finished with 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked up somewhere in the second half and Emmett didn't have
double figures," Roberts said. "I think we did a good job on their
big three."</TE>
<TE>   Southern Illinois led by only three points at the half but opened
the second half with a 9-0 run and controlled the game's flow. The
Salukis' lead swelled to 16 points with six minutes to play on
Dearman's follow shot.</TE>
<TE>   Knight's Red Raiders cut the lead to six points two times in the
final 1:05 but the outcome was never in serious doubt.</TE>
<TE>   The victory capped a great day for the Missouri Valley Conference,
which scored two wins in Chicago. Earlier, No. 5 Creighton upset No.
12 Florida in a double-overtime thriller in a first-round Midwest
regional game.</TE>
<TE>   Creighton only got into the NCAA tournament by defeating Southern
Illinois in the conference tournament title game, leaving the Salukis
to sweat out Selection Sunday before gaining an at-large berth.</TE>
<TE>   "You think about Creighton beating Florida, and I think Southern
Illinois is a better team than Creighton," Knight said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Southern Illinois won both regular-season meetings before
losing in the conference title game.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal was to get to the Sweet 16, if you can believe that,"
Weber said. "People thought I was nuts."</TE>

<HD>Line Change for UCLA</HD>
<DH>West: Bruins have a new look in tournament, as Knight gets
hot and reserves provide energy in 80-58 romp over Mississippi.
Cincinnati is next.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>What game was UCLA playing?</LD>
<LD>   There were hockey-like substitutions, a football mentality and a
barrage of home run balls.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever this amalgam was called, it certainly didn't resemble the
fitful brand of basketball the Bruins played the last two months. And
somehow it worked brilliantly, resulting in the demolition of
Mississippi, 80-58, Friday night in the first round of the West
Regional at Mellon Arena.</LD>
<TE>   Coaches from Cincinnati--the Bruins' second-round opponent
Sunday--walked away scratching their heads. How are they supposed to
prepare?</TE>
<TE>   Based on this game the Bearcats can ignore Jason Kapono. The
Bruins' leading scorer had a career-low two points in 24 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   They ought to double-team freshman Dijon Thompson. The reserve
came in averaging 4.0 points and scored a career-high 16 on
six-of-eight shooting.</TE>
<TE>   And Billy Knight, well, maybe Cincinnati ought to walk him
intentionally. He was UCLA's home run hitter with five three-point
baskets, including one to beat the first-half buzzer and three in a
row to begin the second half when the Bruins (20-11) opened a
double-digit lead they never relinquished.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be really tough to prepare for us," said Matt
Barnes, who scored only six points--seven below his average--in 23
minutes. "Cincinnati won't know what to prepare for."</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi (20-11) certainly didn't. The Rebels tried
unsuccessfully to shoot over the zone defense employed by Bruin
starters, then became flustered by the full-court press employed by
the five reserves that came off the bench at once like a hockey
substitution.</TE>
<TE>   "We came out with an aggressive mentality, we were going to come
out swinging," senior Rico Hines said. "We heard they were
aggressive, so we wanted to be the aggressors ourselves and force
them to shoot poorly."</TE>
<TE>   Wonder why Mississippi is called Ole Miss? Because that's all they
do. The Rebels missed 41 of 62 shots, including 25 of 35 three-point
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Jason Harrison was 0 for 9, with all the shots coming
from long range.</TE>
<TE>   "We had good looks," Harrison said. "They didn't go down."</TE>
<TE>   So UCLA (20-11) reached 20 victories for the 15th consecutive
season and Coach Steve Lavin's NCAA tournament record improved to
10-5.</TE>
<TE>   And the sour taste of the Bruins' 8-9 record the last two months
became more distant as the lead grew.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to see how our players bounced back from a losing
streak," Knight said. "Some teams come into the tournament hot, but
that doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is how you play
here."</TE>
<TE>   It became clear early which team was playing well enough to
continue its season.</TE>
<TE>   Ole Miss missed and missed and missed in the first half, shooting
33.3% and sinking only six of 19 three-point attempts. Only eight
shots came inside the arc; three went in.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA substitutes Thompson, Hines, Andre Patterson, T.J. Cummings
and Ryan Walcott entered en masse with 9:43 left in the first half
and the Bruins ahead, 11-10. They exited 5:35 later, the lead having
grown to 28-16 thanks to 10 points by Thompson and six Rebel
turnovers caused by a rabid Bruin press.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin sent the five starters to the scorer's table earlier, but a
Rebel turnover changed his mind. Barnes didn't care, waving for the
Bruins on the floor to stay put.</TE>
<TE>   When the starters did return, UCLA promptly blew all but three
points of the lead in less than a minute. Cedric Bozeman and Barnes
combined for seven of the team's eight first-half turnovers,
repeatedly underestimating the quickness of the Rebels and forcing
passes.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Harper, who led Ole Miss with 19 points, got hot briefly and
Lavin was tempted to go back to the reserves. However, he stuck with
the starters and a put-back by Knight, a dunk by Gadzuric and the
three-pointer at the buzzer by Knight sent the teams off the floor
with UCLA ahead, 36-26.</TE>
<TE>   Knight didn't leave his touch in the locker room, making three
consecutive three-pointers in the first two minutes of the second
half.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in a slump the last four games," Knight said. "So in
practice I started shooting a lot. I felt it. I liked the rims in
there."</TE>
<TE>   A dunk by Gadzuric and leaner by Barnes stretched the lead to
49-26, but two baskets by Mississippi triggered another mass
substitution. Again the reserves created havoc, forcing two quick
turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   The last 10 minutes were essentially garbage time, with Lavin
experimenting with various lineups and Ole Miss becoming Rebels
without a cause. No Bruin played more than 27 minutes and 10 played
at least 12 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The reserves scored 42 points, a season high.</TE>
<TE>   "It was exciting watching [the reserve unit]," Barnes said. "I had
a great time being a spectator for us."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin made a similar mass substitution two weeks ago in a loss to
Oregon, but this time replaced Bozeman with Hines on the reserve
unit.</TE>
<TE>   Will he use the two-platoon system Sunday? Cincinnati must be
expecting as much.</TE>
<TE>   "The five reserves play better together than when they go into the
game one at a time and try to blend with the starters," Lavin said.
"It's like musicians who practice and play together, then make
beautiful music.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got the veteran group playing jazz and the reserves come in
with their R&amp;B."</TE>
<TE>   For one night at least, the beat went on.</TE>

<HD>Season Got De-Pressing for Trojans</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Tired from Pac-10 tournament and
19-point comeback, USC had nothing left.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>On a series of plays in which he would normally have elevated and
thrown down ferocious dunks in some poor unfortunate soul's face, Sam
Clancy, second-team All-American, blew two layups and a put-back.</LD>
<LD>   Two minutes later, Errick Craven dug deeply enough to find his
lightning-quick first step, blowing by a defender. But instead of
slamming it home with a left-handed jam to raise the roof and USC's
spirits, Craven could only look on helplessly as his layup rimmed
out.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans could have taken a four-point lead and deflated North
Carolina Wilmington in the process by converting those overtime
chances. Instead, they were spent, having used up every ounce of
energy they had in erasing a 19-point deficit in the last nine
minutes of regulation. Their full-court press, which had sparked so
many runs this season, sapped their strength when they needed it
most.</LD>
<TE>   "The hole we dug was just too deep," Clancy muttered. "We couldn't
get out."</TE>
<TE>   And so the 18th-ranked Trojans' season closed at 22-10, as did the
college careers of Clancy and fellow seniors Brandon Granville and
David Bluthenthal.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans' 93-89 overtime loss to unheralded North Carolina
Wilmington on Thursday in the NCAA tournament South Regional sparked
more questions than answers regarding a program purported to be
experiencing a renaissance:</TE>
<TE>   * Did the Trojans, a popular pick for the Final Four, peak too
soon this season, or did they merely punch themselves out in coming
back from the massive second-half deficit to force the extra period
against the Seahawks?</TE>
<TE>   * Were they taking the Seahawks too lightly, and why didn't the
Seahawks even blink when USC unleashed its press?</TE>
<TE>   * Did a season's worth of pressing, and, more recently, three
games of full-court pressure in three days in the Pacific 10
Conference tournament tire the Trojans beyond recovery?</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of expectations for USC," Coach Henry Bibby
said. "I thought we were a very, very good basketball team, but maybe
not as good as everybody thinks we are."</TE>
<TE>   Turns out Bibby's ubiquitous baseball cap with the Final Four
symbol on it was more delusional than inspirational and he admitted
to having used smoke and mirrors on occasion.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we had some flaws," he said. "I don't think we shot the
ball well outside at times. I didn't think we executed what we needed
to during the course of the season. I didn't think we rebounded the
basketball well.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a few things that we had shortcomings on. We covered
up a lot of things with our defense. Our defense was really good. Our
defense carried us all year ... our press carried us all year. They
tricked a lot of people. We won a lot of games with that. We were
disguising some things that we were doing. Sometimes it catches up to
you."</TE>
<TE>   It caught up to the Trojans on Thursday night at Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Resorting to the press so much this season, USC wore itself out
and the Trojans' legs became heavier than the expectations they had
created for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   An argument could be made that the Trojans' season actually ended
with more than five minutes remaining in the first half of the
conference tournament title game March 9.</TE>
<TE>   Having pressed Stanford into oblivion in a first-round game, and
then used the press to get by Oregon in a semifinal, USC was
dominating Arizona via the press. The Trojans were forcing turnovers
and getting steals by the handful as they held a 13-point lead,
33-20, with 5:35 until halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Then they hit the wall of fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   From that point until when North Carolina Wilmington led by 19,
68-49, with 9:46 remaining in regulation, the Trojans had been
outscored, 129-90.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans were half a step behind the Seahawks most of the
night. USC missed 12 free throws in the second half and made only two
of nine shots in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   The frustration, though, of knowing what you want to do and not
being able to do it bubbled up much earlier and USC was on the verge
of breaking down mentally.</TE>
<TE>   With Clancy picking up two fouls in the first 3:24 against
Wilmington, he could not play as aggressively on defense. And after
he was beaten in the post, he glared and extended his arms at
Bluthenthal, who had failed to come over and help.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Craven yelled at Desmon Farmer after the reserve guard had
taken an ill-advised three-point shot late in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   But the Trojans, who had been beaten four times this season on
last-second shots, pulled it together in time to force overtime when
Craven nailed a three-pointer from the right corner with 7.9 seconds
left.</TE>
<TE>   But that was all USC had. The tank was empty.</TE>
<TE>   And now, with the three senior starters' eligibility expired, some
would say that USC's cupboard is similarly bare, a nagging prospect,
given USC's missed opportunities this season.</TE>
<TE>   "That's been the question all year," Granville said. "We never
felt like we were out of games, but we just couldn't figure out why
we'd go through so many offensive lulls."</TE>
<TE>   USC has a summer to think about it.</TE>

<LD>   Missouri vs. Ohio State: Missouri forward Kareem Rush's lip is
still badly swollen after requiring 21 stitches when he took an elbow
in the first-round victory over Miami. "I'm 100%," he said. "You
know, it's just a busted lip." The Tigers, playing their best
basketball of the season after entering the tournament as a
12th-seeded team, must try to slow Ohio State guard Brian Brown, who
scored a career-high 33 points in the Buckeyes' victory over
Davidson. The only Ohio State player to score more points in an NCAA
tournament game was Jerry Lucas, who scored 36 against Western
Kentucky in 1960. Ohio State was 2-0 against Illinois and 3-0 against
Iowa. Missouri lost to Illinois and split with Iowa. "They've beaten
some people who beat us," Missouri guard Clarence Gilbert said.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Wyoming vs. Arizona: Wyoming is the giant killer of the moment
after slaying Gonzaga. The Cowboys, one of the nation's top 10
rebounding teams, like the way they match up with Arizona too. "With
a good point guard and a couple of good post players, I think we can
match up well and play the game," said forward Josh Davis, who
blocked five shots, grabbed 14 rebounds and scored 11 points against
Gonzaga. Wyoming had 12 blocks and its defense contributed to
Gonzaga's season-low 26.8% shooting. Donta Richardson, responsible
for much of the defense that hounded Gonzaga's Dan Dickau into a
seven-for-24 shooting game, figures to be on Jason Gardner. Arizona
forward Luke Walton's brother Chris played against Wyoming for San
Diego State in the Mountain West Conference. "I talked to him on the
phone, but we're going to let our coaches do the scouting," Luke
said. "I'm not going to listen to what he says." Wyoming Coach Steve
McClain, 39, once attended Arizona Coach Lute Olson's basketball camp
when Olson was coach at Iowa.</TE>

<HD>Oklahoma Makes Its Statement in Game</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>When Oklahoma's players gathered for their pregame huddle at
midcourt, Illinois Chicago's players were already there--and the
Flames weren't about to move.</LD>
<LD>   Some bumping and shoving led to snickers from Illinois Chicago
players and coaches, who were proud of their take-that approach. The
Sooners didn't let that good feeling last long.</LD>
<LD>   Forward Aaron McGhee threw around his 6-foot-10, 250-pound body
for 26 points and 12 rebounds, and guard Hollis Price came out of the
game twice because of injuries but still managed to score 17 points
in the No. 2-seeded Sooners' 71-63 victory Friday in the first round
of the West Regional at American Airlines Center.</LD>
<TE>   In Sunday's second round, Oklahoma (28-5) will play Xavier, a
70-58 winner Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever we step on the court, we feel like we own it," said
forward Daryan Selvy, who scored nine unanswered points in an 18-3
Oklahoma run that broke the game open midway through the first half.
"So they were invading our territory. We were serious. I don't know
what their intention was."</TE>
<TE>   Martell Bailey, who led the shoves for Illinois Chicago despite
being the team's smallest player at 5-feet-10, said the intention was
to let the Sooners know the Flames weren't to be taken lightly.
"Coach [Jimmy Collins] told us not to fear anyone," Bailey said. "I
felt we were there first, so we shouldn't have to move."</TE>
<TE>   While Oklahoma struggled with its three-point shooting (two for
18), it defended Illinois Chicago (20-14) well on long-range shots.
The Flames were five for 22 on three-point shots after being the
sixth-most accurate team (41.8%) in the country from behind the arc .</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Xavier 70, Hawaii 58--With guards Romain Sato and Lionel Chalmers
turning up the defensive pressure in the second half, the No.
7-seeded Musketeers (26-5) rallied from a nine-point halftime deficit
and won going away.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii (27-6) missed its first 11 shots of the second half, and
Xavier went on an 11-1 run to take its first lead since the opening
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Predrag Savovic, who scored 16 points for the Warriors in the
first half, was forced into numerous bad shots while being guarded by
Sato in the second half and didn't get a basket until 5:25 remained.
Warrior point guard Carl English, harassed by Chalmers, had seven
turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii scored more points in the last three minutes of the second
half (10) than in the first 17 (eight), but Xavier sealed the victory
by making 12 of 14 free throws in the final 1:16.</TE>
<TE>   Sato finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds, and Chalmers had 15
points, six rebounds, six assists, five blocked shots and five
steals.</TE>

<HD>First Base Becomes Land of Opportunity</HD>

<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>Neither Angel Manager Mike Scioscia nor anyone on the team's coaching
staff has said anything to him directly, but Jamie Burke is well
aware of the opportunity. First baseman Shawn Wooten is out, possibly
for four months, because of a thumb injury he suffered Wednesday and
the Angels are hoping that one or several players will seize the
chance to fill the void.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an unfortunate way to create opportunities--but it does,"
Scioscia said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Benji Gil probably will get most of the at-bats the
right-handed-hitting Wooten would have received. But the versatile
Burke and Jose Nieves, Jeff DaVanon and Clay Bellinger are in the mix
and battling for a roster spot.</LD>
<TE>   Like Wooten, Burke can play first base, third base and catcher. He
hit a solo home run to left field in his only at-bat Friday against
the Chicago White Sox and is batting .333 (six for 18) with four runs
batted in. "Playing the same positions as Wooten might open some
things up, but I don't look at it that way," said Burke, who played
the last two innings at third base in the Angels' 12-5 exhibition
victory. "No one is going to hand me or anyone else anything. I have
to go out, play hard and try to earn a spot."</TE>
<TE>   Burke, 30, was selected in the ninth round of the 1993 draft out
of Oregon State. He twice batted better than .300 at double-A Midland
and was hitting .336 in 149 at-bats at triple-A Edmonton in 1999 when
he injured his left elbow and underwent surgery. He hit .240 in 2000
at Edmonton and .219 last season in triple-A at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good contact hitter and he uses all fields," Scioscia
said. "He hasn't got the opportunity to really get his feet on the
ground in the major leagues, but he's got the makeup and the talent."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Adam Kennedy hit a grand slam and drove in six
runs. Kennedy's home run to right against Matt Guerrier was his first
of the spring. He has 11 hits in 26 at-bats.... Left-hander Scott
Schoeneweis gave up three runs and seven hits in four innings....
Third baseman Troy Glaus, who strained a stomach muscle Thursday
while batting against the Colorado Rockies, was not scheduled to make
the trip. He is listed as day to day.</TE>

<HD>Reed to Stay With Twins</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Given the chance to become a free agent, Rick Reed backed down Friday
and decided to stay with the Minnesota Twins.</LD>
<LD>   Reed, scheduled to be the fourth starter in a rotation that's
already one of the strongest in the American League, withdrew the
trade demand he filed following the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   The pitcher has guaranteed salaries of $7 million in 2002 and $8
million in 2003, the final seasons of a three-year, $21.75 million
contract that also contains an $8-million club option for 2004.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The city's board of aldermen approved a deal to finance a new
ballpark for the St. Louis Cardinals. The St. Louis County Council
and the Missouri legislature also must approve the deal. The ballpark
in downtown St. Louis would seat 49,000, and the Cardinals hope to
move there from Busch Stadium in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Yankee pitcher Andy Pettitte threw two perfect innings in
a minor league intrasquad game. Pettitte was scratched from his start
on March 8 after straining a left elbow muscle. The Yankees also
released pitcher Allen Watson, who was attempting a comeback after
two shoulder surgeries.... Cleveland backup catcher Eddie Taubensee
will miss at least the first two months of the season due to pain in
his lower back.</TE>

<HD>Richardson Says He Will Fight Contract Buyout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson said he would fight a buyout
of his contract, beginning with a meeting Monday with the university
president.</LD>
<LD>   "I did not resign or retire, nor did I request to be bought, and I
have not been bought out of my contract," Richardson said in a
statement, his first public comment since Chancellor John A. White
announced his decision March 1 to buy out the final six years of
Richardson's contract for $3 million.</LD>
<LD>   Richardson said he had authorized his lawyer, John Walker, to
provide documents to University of Arkansas system President B. Alan
Sugg "which I believe support my position" in advance of the meeting
Monday. The meeting is part of Sugg's review of Richardson's
dismissal.</LD>
<TE>   Arkansas announced it had bought out Richardson's contract after
he had twice publicly said he would leave if the university would buy
him out. Documents obtained by the Associated Press indicated that
Richardson was unhappy with wording in a new contract for his
television show before he made the disparaging statements.</TE>

<TE>   Melanie Davis became the first woman to referee a Division I men's
NCAA tournament game Friday, working the first-round game between San
Diego State and Illinois in the Midwest Regional at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope this opens the door for other ladies to come in," Davis
said. "If not, I'm going to take this moment and cherish it."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has officiated men's games in the Southwestern Athletic
Conference for more than 10 years and has done the conference
tournament championship game the last two seasons. She was chosen to
work the NCAA tournament just as the other referees were, said Hank
Nichols, the NCAA's national coordinator of men's basketball
officiating.</TE>
<TE>   Each conference ranks its referees based on their work during the
season, and then submits the top ones to the NCAA to be considered
for the tournament. Davis was the SWAC's top-ranked referee, Nichols
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is history-making," Nichols added. "But I wasn't thinking
about that in terms when we did it."</TE>
<TE>   It was a big deal to Davis. When she got her packet of information
for the tournament, she was so nervous she couldn't open it.</TE>
<TE>   "I waited three or four hours to open it," she said. "I set it on
the dresser and kept staring at it and staring at it. I was worried
at first, but I'm glad it happened."</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with policy, the NCAA did not announce the referees
before the tournament. So there was no fanfare as she walked onto the
floor, with few people aware of the milestone.</TE>
<TE>   Davis won't know until after the weekend whether she'll work the
later rounds of the tournament.</TE>

<TE>   USC's overtime loss to North Carolina Wilmington on Thursday night
got a 4.2 TV rating with a 9 share in Los Angeles. Those numbers were
lower than the national overnight rating and share of 5.0/11 that CBS
averaged for its two sessions of first-round NCAA tournament
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   CBS averaged a 7.3/12 overnight national rating and share for its
prime-time coverage, which included the USC game.</TE>
<TE>   The 5.0 is 6% better than the 4.7 rating CBS got for the opening
round last year and the highest since the first round drew a 5.1 in
1993. The 7.3 is 22% higher than the 6.0 for last year's first round
prime-time coverage and equals the highest since 1991.</TE>

<LD>DIVISION I</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach Poly (30-3) vs. Westchester (30-2)</LD>
<LD>   8 p.m., Long Beach Arena</LD>
<TE>   Westchester, ranked No. 5 in the nation in one poll and looking to
repeat its state championship feat of 1998, will have its hands full
with a strong Poly frontcourt. Guard Brandon Heath scored 20 of his
28 points in the first half of Westchester's 91-74 semifinal victory
over Clovis West last Saturday. Heath, who has committed to San Diego
State, is one of four Comets headed to the next level, along with
Hassan Adams (Arizona), Brandon Bowman (Georgetown) and Ashanti Cook
(New Mexico). Junior Trevor Ariza, who scored 16 against Clovis West,
will be a top recruit next season. Poly, trying to reach its first
state championship game since 1984, will attack Westchester in the
post. Marcedes Lewis, who has signed to play football at UCLA, scored
five points down the stretch in a 76-66 semifinal victory over
Fairfax. The Jackrabbits have two other 6-7 post players: Reggie
Butler scored 22 points against Fairfax and Bobby Jones, a transfer
from Compton Dominguez, scored 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION II</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Mater Dei (29-4) vs. Riverside King (29-4)</TE>
<TE>   4 p.m., Long Beach Arena</TE>
<TE>   Third-seeded King, making its first regional final appearance in
its brief history, will do well to keep the score close going into
the fourth quarter. The Wolves win when they get big games from
standouts Marvin Lea and Leon Rosborough and yeoman-like performances
from a handful of role players, including three-point specialist Bret
Goodman. Lea scored 32 points and Rosborough had 18 as the Wolves
defeated Redondo Union, 66-57, in a regional semifinal to avenge a
loss to the Sea Hawks in the Southern Section Division II-A final.
Top-seeded Mater Dei has won 22 in a row and is looking for a second
consecutive state title after winning the Division I championship
last season. The Monarchs' success is no secret, considering their
second team is nearly as good as their first. Guard Wesley Washington
had 19 points and forward Mike Strawberry added 18 in Mater Dei's
88-79 semifinal victory over Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION III</TE>
<TE>   Compton Centennial (30-1)</TE>
<TE>   vs. Torrance Bishop Montgomery (26-6)</TE>
<TE>   Noon, Long Beach Arena</TE>
<TE>   If Centennial is to break the playoff hex of Bishop Montgomery, it
will need to get the ball into the hands of one of its star players
in crunch time. Neither forward Darius Sanders nor guards Gabriel
Pruitt and Sterling Byrd got off a shot on the Apaches' final two
possessions in their 57-55 loss to the Knights in the Southern
Section Division III-A final. That defeat, Centennial's first of the
season, marked the fifth time the Apaches have lost to the Knights in
the playoffs over the last three seasons. Two-time defending state
champion Bishop Montgomery has defeated Centennial in three
consecutive section finals and two straight regional semifinals. The
top-seeded Knights will need the interior tandem of Fred Washington
and Gavin Lee to play at its best to topple the second-seeded
Apaches.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION IV</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Horizon (27-4) vs. Bakersfield Garces (29-4)</TE>
<TE>   7 p.m., Long Beach City College</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Horizon has enough talent to contend for the Division I
title but can't because the playoff divisions are based on
enrollment. Standout junior forward Nate Carter looks to lead the
Panthers, the San Diego Section champions. Carter had 28 points in a
77-63 semifinal victory over North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake.
Garces, which won the Central Section title, is led by Kyle Shiloh,
who made five of nine three-pointers and had 24 points in a 73-64
semifinal victory over Los Angeles Verbum Dei.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION V</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Price (29-6) vs. Reedley Immanuel (28-4)</TE>
<TE>   3 p.m., Long Beach City College</TE>
<TE>   While guard Derrick Williams has led the way most of the season
for top-seeded Price, Paul Simon had 16 points and Darren Morrison
and Kalief Washington added 12 each in the Knights' 56-46 semifinal
victory over La Jolla Country Day. Williams, who has been hampered
during the playoffs by an ankle injury, had six points. Third-seeded
Immanuel, the Central Section champion, edged San Luis Obispo Mission
Prep, 51-50, in a semifinal after Jeff Warkentin made a free throw
with 31 seconds left in overtime. Price defeated Immanuel, 69-59, in
the regional final last year.</TE>

<HD>Lewis Era Coming to a Close</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marcedes Lewis has recently instilled a little March sadness in his
coaches and teammates at Long Beach Poly High, where those close to
the likable two-sport standout brace for the end of one of the most
magnificent athletic careers in school history.</LD>
<LD>   "Every time I come to this point in the career of one of my great
athletes, I get a sense of nostalgia," said basketball Coach Ron
Palmer, who has guided two-sport stars such as Tony Gwynn and Willie
McGinest over a venerable 23-year career. "I'm going to miss him."</LD>
<LD>   Lewis, bound for UCLA as a tight end who is expected to moonlight
as a walk-on forward in basketball, acknowledged he'll be a little
teary himself when he walks off the court for the final time as a
high school player.</LD>
<TE>   First, he'd like to leave another team or two in tears.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis and the third-seeded Jackrabbits (30-3) will get a chance at
8 tonight when they take on top-seeded Westchester (30-2) in the
Southern California Regional Division I final at Long Beach Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Some have compared the task of beating Westchester in basketball
to that of defeating national power Concord De La Salle in football.</TE>
<TE>   According to Lewis, it's "nowhere near" the same.</TE>
<TE>   "De La Salle was totally different," said Lewis, recalling the
electric atmosphere surrounding Poly's 29-15 loss to the Spartans in
October. "They had their [116-game] winning streak. That game meant
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Lewis realizes a victory over Westchester would put him one
step closer to accomplishing the rare feat of winning a section
football title and a state basketball title in the same season.</TE>
<TE>   It would also put Poly back in the state championship game for the
first time since 1984, also the last time the Jackrabbits won the
title.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, it would be great," Lewis said matter-of-factly.</TE>
<TE>   While Lewis hopes eventually to make his living playing football,
his enthusiasm for basketball is evident as he sprints up the court,
blocks shots and throws his 6-foot-7, 240-pound body around.</TE>
<TE>   Against Los Angeles Loyola in the first round of the regional
playoffs, Lewis scored a career-high 30 points and pulled down 14
rebounds as he overpowered smaller defenders.</TE>
<TE>   For the season, Lewis has averaged 16 points, 11 rebounds and four
assists along a front line that also features 6-7 forwards Bobby
Jones and Reggie Butler, who are also expected to sign with Division
I colleges. Unlike Jones and Butler, 200-pounders whom Lewis
describes as "light in the butt," Lewis is dubbed "The Enforcer" by
his coach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot tougher dealing with him than someone who's 6-7 and
190," Westchester Coach Ed Azzam said. "Whoever's guarding him is
going to need lots of help."</TE>
<TE>   You would never guess it judging by his basketball talents, but
Lewis grew up with a football mentality, savoring the more physical
game with the oblong ball.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know what a basketball was," he said. "I used to watch
basketball, but I could [not] care less. I was out for passing and
catching the ball and running people over. I was just football,
football, football."</TE>
<TE>   As he grew older, someone suggested using his height on the
basketball court. But Lewis didn't play the game until high school,
where he averaged 20 points and was MVP of the freshman team.</TE>
<TE>   That caught the attention of Palmer, who slipped Lewis a piece of
paper listing necessary improvements in his game heading into his
sophomore year.</TE>
<TE>   "Work on the 15-foot jump shot, shoot with both hands around the
basket and make free throws," recalled Lewis, a member of the varsity
team for the last three seasons. "I took that paper and worked on
everything and have been improving every year."</TE>

<HD>Cal Is Mightier Than Penn</HD>
<DH>South: Balanced Bears get off to fast start and appear to
be hitting their top form with an 82-75 victory over Quakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Round 1 of the great Golden State vs. Quaker State grudge match went
to California by knockout, with forward Joe Shipp standing over a
fallen Pennsylvania defender after a dunk, celebrating and jabbering
like Ali.</LD>
<LD>   The Bears stopped Penn, 82-75, Friday in a South Regional
first-round game, using an early 10-0 run to seize a lead they never
relinquished.</LD>
<LD>   Round 2 promises to be tougher. No Ivy League softy is
third-seeded Pittsburgh, which will take on No. 6 Cal (23-8) in a
second-round game Sunday, again in front of a full-throated partisan
throng at the Mellon Center.</LD>
<TE>   "Our goal will be working hard on defending Pitt," Cal Coach Ben
Braun said. "I told the team after [beating Penn] that they are as
ready as any team I've had."</TE>
<TE>   It showed early. Nine Bears scored in the first half, with Shipp,
center Solomon Hughes and guard Brian Wethers leading the way with
three baskets each.</TE>
<TE>   Guards Shantay Legans, A.J. Diggs and Dennis Gates crisply moved
the ball around the perimeter, 6-foot-11 post players Jamal Sampson
and Hughes found openings inside and forwards Amit Tamir and Ryan
Forehan-Kelly made outside shots.</TE>
<TE>   This is an equal-opportunity outfit, a deep, varied roster of
players who share the ball and complement one another beautifully.</TE>
<TE>   Shipp is closest to star status, and he scored 20 points against
11th-seeded Ivy League champion Penn (25-7), 15 in the second half.
He made 11 of 14 free throws, four of seven shots and one NBA-length
three-pointer that stretched the lead to 68-59 with three minutes to
play.</TE>
<TE>   And there was the dunk, no doubt the game's enduring memory for
the Bear forward and his Shipp-mates. He took a pass from Diggs with
12:20 left, gathered steam and jammed the ball over Penn's Koko
Archibong, who fell on his back with Shipp standing over him,
exultant.</TE>
<TE>   Braun was screaming, "Lay it in!" but apparently Shipp didn't hear
him.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one time you are glad to see [a dunk] because he had to go
over the defender," Braun said. "I told Joe to lay it up, but it was
huge. It was an emphatic play."</TE>
<TE>   Cal was ferocious on defense as well, shutting down talented Penn
forwards Ugonna Onyekwe and Archibong. Onyekwe, who averages 17.7
points, scored 16, but he disappeared for long stretches, taking only
two shots while Cal built an eight-point halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Archibong made one of nine shots in the first half and five of 17
in the game, also finishing with 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Sampson and Hughes altered a lot of their shots," Wethers said.
"Jamal, especially, is hard to shoot over. He extends to about nine
feet."</TE>
<TE>   With the interior sealed, Penn was left to launch three-pointers,
making 11 of 24. Jeff Schiffner made three in a two-minute span in
the first half and added another in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "They were real good defensively and we needed to shoot better in
order to win," Penn Coach Fran Dunphy said.</TE>
<TE>   By losing, the Quakers deprived fans of an all-Pennsylvania
second-round matchup between Penn and Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, in this corner, from the Pacific 10 Conference ...</TE>
<TE>   "We came out fighting and that's how we plan to play," said
Wethers, who scored 19 points, mostly on slashing runners through the
lane.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears advanced past the first round for the first time since
1997, when they defeated another Ivy League opponent--Princeton--and
beat Villanova to make a Sweet 16 appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, they lost to Fresno State in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a lot more focused, a lot more ready, a lot more hungry,"
Wethers said. "Last year, we were just excited to be in the situation
we were in. This year, we want to make a run."</TE>

<HD>Brown's Status for Opening Day Still in Doubt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Kevin Brown continued to progress in his recovery from elbow surgery
Friday night, throwing two scoreless innings in the Dodgers' 2-1
split-squad victory over the Florida Marlins, but it does not seem
likely the right-hander will be able to build up enough stamina to
open the season with the team.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, who experienced elbow stiffness after his last start, threw
only 28 pitches Friday night, his second spring start, and he is
clearly behind other pitchers. Most starters have made four spring
appearances by now and are throwing 50-60 pitches in four to five
innings.</LD>
<LD>   Barring any setbacks, Brown will make only three more spring
starts, which may not be enough to increase his workload to the
six-inning range.</LD>
<TE>   Most starters throw six or seven innings in their final spring
tuneup, gradually increasing their pitch count each game until they
reach 90-100 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "Could he be where he needs to be between now and opening day? You
better believe he could," Manager Jim Tracy said. "Because it's Kevin
Brown, and Kevin Brown is a completely different guy from anyone that
I've ever seen. With someone else, I don't know that the process
would work."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers hoped Brown would be ready to pitch opening day, but
they must temper those short-term hopes with the long-term reality
that Brown has four years and $60 million remaining on his contract,
and another major setback after September's surgery to repair a
tendon could be devastating.</TE>
<TE>   If he's not ready to open the season, Brown could spend a week or
so in extended spring training, making one or two more starts.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to push him," Tracy said. "We're going to see how
he feels [today] and proceed normally. He's in a rehabilitation
process, and he's progressing very nicely."</TE>
<TE>   Brown needed 20 pitches to complete the first inning Friday night,
opening the game with six straight balls, but he retired the side in
order on eight pitches in the second.</TE>
<TE>   His fastball reached 92 mph, below his usual 95-96 mph, "but the
most important thing was that he came off the mound pain-free," Tracy
said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who turned 37 Friday, was in no mood to discuss his
performance.</TE>
<TE>   "All I've got to tell you is I felt fine," Brown said. "My arm
felt good."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Terry Mulholland was impressive in a split-squad game
against Atlanta on Friday, throwing three hitless innings and
allowing only one baserunner in the Dodgers' 3-1 split-squad victory
at Kissimmee, Fla. Mulholland, 39, who is fighting for a bullpen job,
has a 1.50 earned-run average in 12 spring innings.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pitching like two 20-year-olds," pitching coach Jim Colborn
said. "He's definitely not pitching like he's 40."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Lo Duca had two hits and a run batted in, and Giovanni
Carrara threw two hitless innings. The game marked the first meeting
between Atlanta's Gary Sheffield and the Dodgers' Brian Jordan since
they were swapped in a trade in January. Sheffield was hitless in two
at-bats, and Jordan doubled once in three at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After getting rocked for seven runs in 42/3 innings of his first
two appearances, left-hander Omar Daal, who is in a battle with
Odalis Perez and Eric Gagne for the fifth rotation spot, responded
with two strong outings, three scoreless innings against Houston on
Sunday and four scoreless innings against Florida on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   "My first two games were not good, but I hadn't pitched in three
months," Daal said. "But I'm keeping the ball down and my location is
better, that's the key. I'm getting more confidence and feeling
better."</TE>
<TE>   Marlin closer Antonio Alfonseca, whom the Dodgers, Cubs and
Orioles have expressed trade interest in, allowed one hit and a walk
in a scoreless sixth inning.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Are Pleased With Tie</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Even though playoffs are out of reach, they
continue to play well down the stretch, as 1-1 draw with Chicago
shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This was one more step to the "we're finished" line.</LD>
<LD>   The Mighty Ducks skated hard, even out-worked the Chicago
Blackhawks, currently the fourth-best team in the Western Conference,
but all they had to show for it was a 1-1 tie in front of an
announced 11,360 at the Arrowhead Pond on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Everything came out a push. The Ducks' German Titov and Chicago's
Steve Sullivan exchanged third-period goals. Goalie Jean-Sebastien
Giguere, a bright spot in a bleak Duck season, stopped 39 of 40
shots, but was matched by Chicago's Jocelyn Thibault. Both teams had
chances, both teams wasted chances.</LD>
<TE>   It got the Blackhawks a much-needed point as they drive toward the
playoffs. It got the Ducks a day closer to the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope there is no quit in this group," Coach Bryan Murray said.
"I think that's the biggest thing for me. I want to see them continue
to play hard every night, try to win the game against the good teams
we're going to run into."</TE>
<TE>   Murray got his wish Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks came up with a solid game against the Blackhawks, whose
front-line center, Alex Zhamnov, returned after missing four games
due to a hip injury.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not giving up, we're trying every game," defenseman Oleg
Tverdovsky said. "Of course it is kind of tough, knowing that the
second year in a row we're out of the playoff race a few months
before the season is over. It's hard to have that extra energy
because you don't really have a goal."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, however, are inching toward vacation as best they can.
They are 10-5-1 in their last 16 games, a run that would have been
more impressive had it occurred when they were in sight of the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   They can settle for trying to make things miserable for other
teams. They have two games left with St. Louis, Phoenix and Dallas,
and one left with San Jose and the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we approach the game like that," defenseman Keith
Carney said. "We just try to concentrate on getting better and
finishing up the season as strong as we can. We don't necessarily
think about trying to spoil things for other teams."</TE>
<TE>   Titov gave the Ducks the lead 6:39 into the third period, although
it was Tverdovsky who did the busy work.</TE>
<TE>   Tverdovsky took a pass right of the net, danced around one
Blackhawk, then whipped a shot that was blocked before it got to the
net. The puck, though, drifted to Titov, who flipped a shot in.</TE>
<TE>   The lead lasted less than three minutes. Eric Daze flicked a shot
on goal that Steve Sullivan redirected between Giguere's legs for a
1-1 tie 9:09 into the period.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had the better of play in the first period, outshooting
the Blackhawks, 14-7.</TE>
<TE>   Yet they could not beat Thibault, even on an aggressive power
play.</TE>
<TE>   With Kyle Calder off for holding the stick, the Ducks managed four
quality scoring chances, the best being Matt Cullen's point-blank try
on a rebound that Thibault, who stopped 32 of 33 shots, dived to his
right to get his stick on.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere was equally impressive in keeping the game scoreless
through two periods.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks played without defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski, who
received a two-game suspension Friday for elbowing Pittsburgh
defenseman Michal Rozsival in Wednesday's game.</TE>
<TE>   Vishnevski elbowed Rozsival in the face midway through the first
period. No penalty was called, but Rozsival did not return.</TE>

<HD>Stevens Shops for a Star</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Jockey will go coast to coast this weekend in
search of a late-developing Kentucky Derby horse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HALLANDALE BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>In Florida one day and back home in California the next, jockey Gary
Stevens goes windmill-tilting this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Stevens will be at Gulfstream Park today to ride High Star in the
$1-million Florida Derby, then Sunday will ride Puerto Banus in the
$250,000 San Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita, and although both colts
are longshots, it's the kind of a year when a late-developing horse
could win the Kentucky Derby.</LD>
<LD>   Stevens, a three-time Kentucky Derby winner, was disappointed and
perplexed after Point Given, the favorite, ran fifth at Churchill
Downs in the only race he lost all last year. Still shopping for a
Derby mount this year, Stevens didn't have to be asked twice when
trainer Nick Zito, a two-time Kentucky Derby winner, called recently
to ask if he'd ride High Star in the Florida Derby. Zito even threw
in a bonus, the chance for Stevens to ride another of his
3-year-olds, Governor Hickel, in the $150,000 Swale on the Florida
Derby undercard.</LD>
<TE>   "Any time Gary comes east, I'll ride him," Zito said. "I haven't
had the chance to ride him much over the years, but I know we have a
tremendous winning percentage together. Gary's the ultimate best.
He's one of the three brainiest jockeys there are. The other two are
Jerry Bailey and Chris McCarron."</TE>
<TE>   McCarron came from California to ride Zito's second Kentucky Derby
winner, Go For Gin, in 1994. Bailey will be riding Siphonic, who'll
be the odds-on favorite Sunday in the San Felipe.</TE>
<TE>   High Star, who finished only 11/2 lengths behind Repent, one of
the early favorites for this year's Kentucky Derby, when they raced
late last year, was ridden by Jorge Chavez in both of his wins, but
Chavez is tied up with Booklet, the 4-1 second choice in the Florida
Derby behind 5-2 favorite Harlan's Holiday. John Ward Jr., who trains
Booklet, used Chavez to win the Kentucky Derby with Monarchos last
year.</TE>
<TE>   At Santa Anita on Sunday, six horses will oppose Siphonic in the
11/16-mile San Felipe. The others running are Tracemark, Gobi Dan,
Medaglia D'Oro, Shah Jehan, U S S Tinosa and Puerto Banus, who runs
for the Point Given team of Prince Ahmed Salman and trainer Bob
Baffert. Puerto Banus ran second, 41/2 lengths behind U S S Tinosa,
in the 11/8-mile Sham at Santa Anita on Feb. 8.</TE>
<TE>   "My horse [U S S Tinosa] was drawing away in the last race,"
trainer Jerry Hollendorfer said. "He was impressive. I worry that
we're cutting back in distance, but I think this is the best path.
We'll see what our horse can do against the major players, and he
does like the Santa Anita track."</TE>
<TE>   Third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, Siphonic won the Hollywood
Futurity in December, but in his first start this year, in the Santa
Catalina on Jan. 19, under Bailey, he almost went down leaving the
gate and finished second, 51/2 lengths behind Labamta Babe, who since
has been injured.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer David Hofmans vanned Siphonic from his Hollywood Park
headquarters over to Santa Anita for a half-mile workout on
Wednesday. Siphonic broke well and was clocked in 47 seconds, fastest
time of the morning for that distance.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Patrick Biancone, who has Mayakovsky, the 6-5 morning-line
favorite in Sunday's $200,000 Gotham at Aqueduct, believes that Came
Home, not Siphonic, is the best California contender for the Kentucky
Derby. In Mayakovsky's last race, before a fractured left hind leg
sent him to the sidelines, Came Home beat Biancone's horse by two
lengths in the Hopeful at Saratoga in September.</TE>
<TE>   "Came Home would be my first pick," Biancone said. "He's an
exceptional horse. He's a monster."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Squirtle Squirt, last year's champion sprinter, is to undergo
arthroscopic surgery on his left knee and will be out at least three
months.... Bien Bien, who won four Grade I races at Santa Anita and
Hollywood Park, finished second in the 1993 Breeders' Cup Turf and
earned $2.3 million, died Tuesday, apparently of a heart attack,
after being bred to a mare in England. Bien Bien, 13, sired
Bienamado, who earned $1.2 million.</TE>

<LD>DIVISION I</LD>
<LD>   Lynwood (31-0) vs. Harbor City Narbonne (27-3)</LD>
<LD>   6 p.m., Long Beach Arena</LD>
<TE>   Lynwood is quicker and applies exceptional full-court pressure;
two-time defending state champion Narbonne is taller. Lynwood scores
in transition; Narbonne in the half-court set. It will be critical
for Narbonne to handle the ball effectively. The Gauchos' three
losses were to teams similar to Lynwood, and against another similar
team, Long Beach Poly, in the regional semifinal, they committed 28
turnovers in a 58-52 victory. If Lynwood forces 28 turnovers, Janice
Bright, Sade Wiley-Gatewood &amp; Co. probably will have a field day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION II</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton Troy (29-3) vs. Redondo Union (25-7)</TE>
<TE>   2 p.m., Long Beach Arena</TE>
<TE>   Ever since halftime of the Southern Section Division II-A
championship, at which point Redondo led North Torrance, 9-8, the
fourth-seeded Sea Hawks have been on a tear. They outscored North
Torrance in the second half, 33-22, then beat Spring Valley Mount
Miguel, 69-26, and top-seeded Ventura, 50-34, in Ventura--no easy
feat. The latter got the attention of third-seeded Troy, which lost
to Ventura, 61-43, in the Division II-AA finals. Redondo's success
hinges on its defense, which has limited its two previous regional
opponents to 20.8% shooting. Troy, with victories over Escondido
Orange Glen and a come-from-behind 57-54 victory over second-seeded
Bakersfield Stockdale, needs a big game from its pressure defense in
order to set up easy baskets in transition and avoid a half-court
game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION III</TE>
<TE>   Lakewood Artesia (26-5) vs.</TE>
<TE>   Torrance Bishop Montgomery (26-5)</TE>
<TE>   10 a.m., Long Beach Arena</TE>
<TE>   Second-seeded Bishop Montgomery, the Southern Section III-A
champion, has won the last two state titles. Junior guard/forward
Noelle Quinn is one of the most talented athletes in the Southland.
Quinn's passing is phenomenal and her shooting is terrific. Guard
Nykia Peace is a similarly competent scorer. The Knights also have
some size in 6-0 Melissa Loera, who will try to negate Artesia's 6-2
center, Cacie Pope, whose role has expanded since 6-3 Lauren Ervin
quit the team. Brittany Thomas has scored 63 points in the last two
games, and Brittany Imaku and Christian Jackson are averaging 12
points in the playoffs for top-seeded Artesia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION IV</TE>
<TE>   La Jolla The Bishop's (26-3)</TE>
<TE>   vs. Playa del Rey St. Bernard (23-7)</TE>
<TE>   5 p.m., Long Beach City College</TE>
<TE>   Second-seeded St. Bernard, led by Georgia-bound 5-6 guard Alexis
Kendricks and 6-1 junior post player Shannon Clay, will be looking to
improve upon last year's showing against top-seeded The Bishop's,
which defeated the Vikings, 57-45, in the semifinals and went on to
win the state title. This year's Knights are a different team, with
only one senior. Mallorie Winn, a 5-11 point guard and the daughter
of The Bishop's Coach Fentriss Winn, has made an oral commitment to
play at Georgia Tech next season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DIVISION V</TE>
<TE>   La Jolla Country Day (25-5) vs. Los Angeles Pilgrim (28-3)</TE>
<TE>   1 p.m., Long Beach City College</TE>
<TE>   It might be a tall order for third-seeded Pilgrim to beat
top-seeded Country Day, the defending Division V state champion.
Pilgrim has won Southern Section Division V-A titles six of the last
seven years, including the last four. But the Patriots lost to
Country Day, 72-38, in the second round of the state playoffs last
year and may not match up this time, either. The Patriots' best
player is 5-foot-8 senior forward Amber Cunningham, who is averaging
19.4 points and 8.9 rebounds. The key for Pilgrim will be stopping
5-11 sophomore guard Candice Wiggins, who averages 29.8 points, 13
rebounds, seven steals and five assists.</TE>

<LD>The last game of the season determines the state champion, but the
girls' basketball game creating the season's biggest buzz takes place
tonight at Long Beach Arena, not a week from now in Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   Lynwood and Harbor City Narbonne take the floor in the Southern
California Regional Division I final to settle an issue that has
lingered all season: Who's No. 1?</LD>
<LD>   "For us, this is the game of the year," said Lynwood senior Janice
Bright, a guard who will play next season at Nebraska. "We're No. 1,
and they think they can still be No. 1.</LD>
<TE>   "We worked real hard to get where we are. [Narbonne] always had
the big name and we never really got any credit, and now we're the
team to beat.... But we're not going to lose."</TE>
<TE>   With a victory, Narbonne (27-3) has a chance to win a third
consecutive state title. Lynwood (31-0), if it wins the next two
weekends, has a chance to win a mythical national title--which
Narbonne won the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't see that type of talent in one place very often," said
Terri Bamford, coach of La Jolla Country Day, one of the teams' three
common opponents, along with Long Beach Poly and Lakewood Artesia.
"Both teams are from L.A., both are rivals, both are so talented....
There's no way the state title game can match the regional game."</TE>
<TE>   Lynwood and Narbonne are Nos. 1 and 2 among all schools in the
most recent state rankings and Nos. 1 and 6 in the nation. The
Northern finalists, San Jose Archbishop Mitty (26-6) and Sacramento
Kennedy (30-4), were nowhere to be seen in the state rankings until
this week, when Archbishop Mitty appeared at No. 16 and Kennedy at
No. 20. Both Southern finalists are confident, for sure.</TE>
<TE>   "[Coach James Anderson] told us you can only play off heart and
emotion for so long, and the team with the most talent will win,"
said Narbonne guard Lisa Willis, who will play next season at UCLA.
"And I'm telling you, we have the most talent, so we will win.</TE>
<TE>   "Lynwood is very good, but I feel they cannot match up with us. If
we play how we're supposed to play, it shouldn't be a very close
game. I'm not saying we'll beat them by 40, but there won't be a lot
of timeouts called in the last two minutes."</TE>
<TE>   For Narbonne to win, post players Willnett Crockett (6-2, senior),
Indi Johnson (6-2, junior), Amber Pruitt (6-0, senior) and Jamie Funn
(6-2, junior) must get an opportunity to exploit their size advantage
inside, and that probably won't happen unless sophomore point guard
Camille LeNoir has a good game handling the ball. If LeNoir gets an
early basket, it will also help her confidence and her defense, and
when LeNoir is comfortable, it helps Willis get into the game.</TE>
<TE>   For Lynwood to win, it must play an up tempo game, create
turnovers and score in transition.</TE>
<TE>   "They must tire out Narbonne," Artesia Coach Scott Roczey said. "I
think Lynwood is better conditioned."</TE>
<TE>   Lynwood also won't give up. The Knights trailed Artesia by 13 with
three minutes remaining before rallying for a 70-68 victory in
overtime, and Narbonne has, at times, been lethargic.</TE>
<TE>   If officiating plays a role, Narbonne may be better able to
withstand foul trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "If [guards] Sade Wiley-Gatwood or Janice Bright get in trouble,
Lynwood's going to be hurting," Roczey said, "but if Narbonne's posts
get in trouble, they have two or three others they can bring in."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Lynwood was 28-2 and looked unbeatable going into its
game against Narbonne in the regional final, which it lost, 67-41.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I think Lynwood can beat them? Yes," Poly Coach Carl Buggs
said. "If Lynwood's hitting their outside shots early.... [But] if
both teams are playing at their best, I have to give the edge to
Narbonne just because of size. That size is something else. You don't
get many second opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   Not until next year, anyway.</TE>

<LD>In what he called his best round of the year, Tiger Woods birdied
five of the first 10 holes and wound up with a seven-under-par 65 on
Friday, giving him a four-shot lead over Scott McCarron heading into
the weekend in the Bay Hill Invitational at Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Woods, looking for his first victory of the year, was at 12-under
132 and had the third-largest lead after 36 holes in his career. He
led the 2000 NEC Invitational by seven shots and the U.S. Open at
Pebble Beach by six shots after two rounds, both times going on to
win by double digits.</LD>
<LD>   McCarron had a bogey-free 67 and was at 136, with Ernie Els (67)
and Angel Cabrera of Argentina (70) another stroke back. John Daly
followed his 67 with a 71 and was at 138.</LD>
<TE>   Host Arnold Palmer said he won't play in the tournament anymore.
He didn't turn in a card, but it would have been an 87, his worst
score ever in the Bay Hill Invitational. Thursday he shot 86.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Annika Sorenstam shot a two-under 70 for a share of the lead at
137 with Kim Saiki after 36 holes in the Ping Banner Health at
Phoenix. Sorenstam won last year with LPGA Tour-record scores of 59
in the second round and 27-under 261 for four rounds.</TE>

<LD>Game-winning goals by Lubomir Visnovsky on Thursday night against the
St. Louis Blues and Philippe Boucher on Monday night against the
Chicago Blackhawks continued a two-year trend for King defensemen.</LD>
<LD>   After leading the NHL in points by defensemen last season, the
Kings are second this season to the Detroit Red Wings, even though
All-Star Rob Blake was traded 13 months ago and Mathieu Schneider,
their top-scoring defenseman last season, has sat out 26 games.</LD>
<LD>   "That's been a big plus, the offensive production of our
defensemen," Coach Andy Murray said Friday. "Our system is based on
our defensemen getting up with the attack and being involved. But I
guess we are somewhat surprised that we've gotten as much as we've
gotten. If you looked at our defensemen, to say that we're second in
the league, people might say, 'Wow.'"</LD>
<TE>   Led by Jaroslav Modry, who has racked up a career-high 38 points,
King defensemen have contributed 23 goals and 108 assists.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Based on opponents' records, the Kings' remaining schedule is the
toughest among the Western Conference playoff contenders.... The
Kings are 4-3-2 in their last nine home games, even though they have
not scored more than two goals in any of those games.... Since losing
10 of their first 12 one-goal games, the Kings have won 10 of their
last 16.... Although he sat out the first three weeks of the season
before his trade from the Boston Bruins, King center Jason Allison
was tied for fourth in the league in assists and was second in
power-play points before Friday's games. He was tied for the league
lead in power-play assists.</TE>

<LD>In an effort to keep 5-foot-5 point guard Jason Harrison from
matching up against 6-6 Cedric Bozeman, Emmanuel Wade started for
Mississippi instead of Aaron Harper and guarded Bozeman.</LD>
<LD>   Like everything else Ole Miss tried, the strategy backfired.</LD>
<LD>   Making only his fourth start of the season, Wade, a 6-3 guard,
missed all five of his first-half shots, contributing to the Rebels'
abysmal 33.3% shooting. He made two three-point shots in the second
half, but UCLA already had a huge lead en route to the 80-58 victory.</LD>
<TE>   When Bozeman was replaced by 6-1 Ryan Walcott, Harrison defended
him. But he was no more effective with the ball, missing all seven
shots he attempted in the first half and all nine in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "They played real good," Harrison said. "They were on and we
weren't. We couldn't make any shots and it really made us climb
uphill."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Guard David Sanders scored career high totals of 23 and 26 points
in his last two games, making 23 of 34 shots (68%) in the last three
games and 10 of 16 three-point shots in the last four.</TE>
<TE>   But against UCLA he was only three of nine for seven points, and
he was as cold from long range as most of his teammates, making one
of four.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Rebels pride themselves on tenacious man-to-man defense, but
the unit of five UCLA reserves used a man-to-man, full-court press
that startled Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew their bench was a force," Harrison said. "But we couldn't
have predicted that they would do what they did. They took us out of
our game."</TE>
<TE>   The Rebels, who committed 18 turnovers, were 2-7 in games they
gave up more than 70 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coach Rod Barnes' record is 86-46 in four seasons, including NCAA
tournament appearances. The 38-year-old was the Naismith national
coach of the year in 2001, taking the Rebels to the Sweet 16.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a strong role model for other young coaches because of the
way he lives his life," UCLA Coach Steve Lavin said. "I have the
utmost respect for him."</TE>

<LD>Patrick Jackson made six of eight three-point shots and scored 28
points to lead Ball State past Saint Joseph's, 76-54, Friday night in
a first-round National Invitation Tournament game at Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   Ball State (22-11) made 11 of 23 three-point shots. The Cardinals'
next NIT opponent is Louisiana State on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Saint Joseph's (19-12) used a 19-7 run in the first half to build
its biggest lead at 30-21. But Ball State made four consecutive
three-point shots, two by Jackson, in a three-minute stretch to cut
the deficit to 35-32 at halftime.</LD>
<TE>   Ball State then opened with second half with a 20-7 run and St.

<HD>Waves Move Up to Business Class</HD>
<DH>Women's basketball: No longer happy just to be in
tournament, Pepperdine takes a serious-minded approach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NORMAN, Okla.</DL>
<LD>The pressures and joys of the women's NCAA tournament were spelled
out Friday by Pepperdine forward Sarah Richen and Villanova guard
Trish Juhline.</LD>
<LD>   This is the second tournament bid Richen's team has received in
the last three seasons. But the 23-7 Waves do not view tonight's West
Regional first-round game at the Lloyd Noble Center as a reward for
winning the West Coast Conference regular-season and tournament
titles.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been here before," said Richen, a 6-foot-2 senior who
averages 8.9 points. "We're happy to be here and we're having a great
time but there's business to be done. We're gonna have to do what is
needed to win."</LD>
<TE>   Juhline was more bubbly about her 19-10 team, which tied for third
in the Big East and reached the conference tournament semifinals
before falling--as everybody has this season--to Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still just as excited as we were last year," said Juhline,
a 5-10 junior who leads the Wildcats in scoring at 14.2 points a
game.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how many times you've been here ... you try your whole
college career to get here once. Any time after that is
unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine is seeded eighth in the regional, Villanova ninth. The
Waves, who average 73.6 points, like to play an up-tempo game.
Richen, 6-2 forward Nadja Morgan and 6-3 center Shannon Mayberry give
Pepperdine an inside attack, and guards Damaris Hinojosa and
Shandrika Lee unload from the outside when opponents pack the Waves'
frontcourt. Hinojosa, with a 13.6-point average, and Morgan (12.6)
lead the Waves in scoring.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a little stronger on the inside than us," Villanova
Coach Harry Perretta said. "Morgan concerns me a lot, because we
don't have a dominant inside scorer. We'll try to play them straight
up, but if we have to help out on [Morgan] it opens up the
three-point line for them. That's something we don't want to do."</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats, who average 60.9 points and are led by Juhline and
Mimi Riley (11.9 points a game), are willing to use every tick of the
30-second clock before shooting. Patience isn't simply a virtue for
the Wildcats, it's a strength. They depend on opponents getting itchy
while they run their sets, waiting for the best opportunity to score.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people call it boring basketball," Pepperdine Coach Mark
Trakh said. "Watching [Perretta's] system on tape, I'm really
impressed. His kids really know how to play the game. It's the
collective group knowing what they have to do to defeat the people
they defeat."</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats definitely know about long-distance shooting. They
launched 757 three-point shots this season, making 249, and outscored
opponents from behind the arc, 747-300. They have made at least one
three-pointer in 144 consecutive games.</TE>

<HD>Pittsburgh Plays It Smart With Knight</HD>
<DH>South: Point guard shrugs off injuries, scores 17 points to
lead Panthers to 71-54 victory over Central Connecticut State.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Playing nearly 40 minutes with a pulled leg muscle and a sprained
finger was simply exercise for Brandin Knight.</LD>
<LD>   Mental exercise.</LD>
<LD>   The junior point guard had nine assists, five steals and 17 points
in leading Pittsburgh past Central Connecticut State, 71-54, Friday
in a first-round South Regional game before a loud partisan crowd at
Mellon Arena.</LD>
<TE>   "That was Brandin leading and that's why I call him the Einstein
of point guards," Coach Ben Howland said. "Great players make plays
and he made the plays."</TE>
<TE>   Knight was impatient with queries about the thigh injury he'd
suffered days earlier in the Big East tournament final.</TE>
<TE>   "The leg is fine and that's it," he said. "The answer is not going
to change. So please, no more questions about the leg."</TE>
<TE>   Fourteenth-seeded Central Connecticut State (27-5) came in with
the nation's longest winning streak at 19 games and pulled within
43-40 with 9:38 to play. But Pitt guard Julius Page made a
three-point basket and the third-seeded Panthers (28-5) pulled away
for their first tournament victory since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Page made four of six from long range and scored 16 points.
Corsley Edwards scored 16 points for Central Connecticut and Damian
Battles had 15.</TE>
<TE>   Although Knight, brother of NBA guard Brevin Knight, made only one
of eight three-point shots, his defense and passing kept the Panthers
comfortably ahead down the stretch. He had seven of his assists in
the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been looking forward to playing in the NCAA tournament since
I came here," Knight said.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't miss this opportunity for the world. I decided to go
out and play with a clear mind, not worry [about the leg] and I'm
glad we came out with the win."</TE>

<LD>Merle Duckett, longtime swimming coach at Palisades High, opened a
sports page last fall and surveyed the boys' water polo roster from a
not-so-nearby private school.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly every player listed the same hometown, Pacific Palisades.</LD>
<LD>   "That would have been our swim team," Duckett said of the players.</LD>
<TE>   Duckett wasn't completely serious. The Dolphins return the nucleus
of a team that finished second to Granada Hills last season at the
City Section Championships, but the newspaper clipping provided a
clear example of the challenges the Palisades' swimming program has
faced in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Existing in a section that doesn't field water polo is just a part
of it.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Palisades is a math and science magnet school that
draws students from all over the city, many in the affluent coastal
community that surrounds the 2,500-student school take advantage of
the academic environment at private schools, Duckett said.</TE>
<TE>   "Smaller classes and maybe the private schools have a little
higher academic standing," Duckett said.</TE>
<TE>   This coastal flight has particularly taken the steam out of the
girls' swim team, which won the City championship 13 times between
1981 and '94, but went home empty-handed six consecutive seasons
before ending the drought last May.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in a downslide," Duckett said. "The enrollment was
dwindling with a lot of kids going to schools like Harvard-Westlake
and Loyola."</TE>
<TE>   But the Dolphins have reemerged as the team to beat in the City
this season, thanks to a tight-knit group of returning swimmers.</TE>
<TE>   Katie Dwyer, a senior who helped set a school record in the 200
freestyle relay last season, has been swimming at the Palisades YMCA
with many of her teammates for years.</TE>
<TE>   "We all swam together when we were little," Dwyer said, "and we
all just happened to go Pali."</TE>
<TE>   Palisades has all but one of its swimmers back from last season,
making it a favorite to win its 16th City title.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Dwyer, the Dolphins are led by the section's most
valuable swimmer, sophomore Cara Davidoff, as well as the remaining
members of the 200 and 400 freestyle relay teams. Davidoff won the
50- and 100-yard freestyle events at the section final last season at
Long Beach Belmont Plaza, and also led the Dolphins' 200- and
400-yard relay teams to victory.</TE>
<TE>   Palisades placed in nearly every event, accumulating 287 points to
defeat runner-up Woodland Hills El Camino Real (260). Granada Hills,
winner of the last six titles, was fourth.</TE>
<TE>   With the two best swimmers on the boys' team, juniors Gregory
Walther and Adam Bateman, returning, Palisades should make another
run at Granada Hills for the City title.</TE>
<TE>   Granada Hills ended Venice's streak of six consecutive titles last
season. Palisades finished second and Venice was seventh. The City
finals are scheduled for May 22 at USC.</TE>

<LD>   North Carolina Wilmington vs. Indiana: The Seahawks of Wilmington
provided the NCAA tournament's biggest upset on the first day of
March Madness, beating USC, 93-89, in overtime of a first-round South
Regional game. So what's the message for today, when the Seahawks
play fifth-seeded Indiana in a second-round game at Arco Arena?
"We've had a saying all year," Coach Jerry Wainwright said. "Dream
big, focus small." The Seahawks will need to be focused to pull off
another upset. Indiana is coming off a dominating 75-56 victory over
Utah. Today's winner moves on to Lexington, Ky., for the Sweet 16.</LD>

<TE>   Duke vs. Notre Dame: Duke won national titles in 1991 and '92
while Mike Brey--now the Notre Dame coach--was an assistant under
Mike Krzyzewski, who is 13-0 against former Duke assistants. "I hope
he's real uncomfortable over the next 24 hours, and is distracted and
feeling guilty," Brey said. While eighth-seeded Notre Dame has a
similar style to Duke and runs some of the same sets, Krzyzewski
believes Brey's inside knowledge of the Duke program is negligible.
"We won't lose because Mike knows my playbook, because I don't have a
playbook," Krzyzewski said of his free-wheeling team. "We may lose
because his kids outplay us." Some comments from Notre Dame's David
Graves should catch the attention of Duke. "Duke has gotten blown out
too this year," Graves said. "They're vulnerable and they can be
beaten, we understand that. I don't even think we have to play our
best game to beat them. We've got to play a solid game and make them
uncomfortable, not let them drive and pitch and shoot threes." The
last time Notre Dame advanced past the second round was in 1987. Duke
defeated Winthrop, 84-37, in the first round as Carlos Boozer, Mike
Dunleavy and Jason Williams combined for 55 points. Notre Dame
defeated Charlotte, 82-63, as Matt Carroll and Ryan Humphrey each
scored 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alabama vs. Kent State: The patience of Mark Gottfried, the
Crimson Tide's fourth-year coach, has been rewarded. He chose to play
several youngsters his first two seasons to see what they could do.
"Our talent wasn't very good," Gottfried recalled. "We signed a bunch
of freshmen, the guys who are now juniors, made the decision to play
them early, wanted them to grow with the program." Erwin Dudley was
the Southeastern Conference's player of the year. Rod Grizzard
averages about 15 points. Terrance Mead and Kenny Walker are also key
contributors for the Crimson Tide. No. 2 seed Alabama hasn't advanced
past the second round since 1991. The Crimson Tide struggled in its
opening-round win over Florida Atlantic, needing 33 points from
freshman point guard Maurice Williams to pull out an 86-78 win. No.
10 seed Kent State, meanwhile, will be trying to extend its winning
streak to 20 after upsetting Oklahoma State, 69-61, on Thursday.</TE>

<DL>INDIAN WELLS</DL>
<LD>Nigel Sears has coached elite players and his experience enables him
to recognize the signs of an impending breakthrough. Just before the
tournament here, he had a chat with his young protege, Daniela
Hantuchova of Slovakia.</LD>
<LD>   Her near misses--three-set losses against Venus Williams, Jennifer
Capriati, Justine Henin and Lindsay Davenport--were the first sign.
The second was her willingness to work hard.</LD>
<LD>   Sears recalls, "I said to her one evening, 'Look, you're working
great in practice. I don't know when you're going to break through
and I know you're going to break through. I can't tell you whether
it's going to be next week, or Miami or Amelia Island or Charleston.'
She looked at me and said, 'This week, please.'"</LD>
<TE>   Asked and answered.</TE>
<TE>   "She really means it," Sears said. "She wants it now and is not
the type to say, 'One day.' She's not a one-day dreamer."</TE>
<TE>   Hantuchova, 18, will be playing in her first WTA final today
against second-seeded Martina Hingis of Switzerland in the Pacific
Life Open at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. She is the
second-lowest-ranked player, at No. 26, to reach the final.
Australian Jenny Byrne, then ranked 64th, lost in the 1989 Indian
Wells final.</TE>
<TE>   Hingis, champion here in 1998, is three years older than
Hantuchova and has won 40 titles. She was only 14 when she reached
her first final, at Hamburg on clay in 1995, losing, 6-1, 6-0, to
Conchita Martinez of Spain.</TE>
<TE>   "I got killed. I don't remember the scores," Hingis said,
laughing. "Also in Rome, I played her too. Gee, that was my second
[final]. I always had to play her. As long as she could, [Martinez]
gave the youngsters a pretty good lesson."</TE>
<TE>   Hingis hasn't done poorly in that department, either. After losing
her No. 1 ranking late last year, she began 2002 in peak physical
condition, having taken an enforced rest after tearing ligaments in
her right ankle in October.</TE>
<TE>   She started the year by winning at Sydney and losing to Capriati
in the Australian Open final after holding four match points. Since
then, Hingis has won at Tokyo and reached the semifinals at
Scottsdale, Ariz., has not dropped a set here in five matches and has
remained in the spotlight with her romance with Spanish golf pro
Sergio Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   For Hingis, Indian Wells represented an opportunity to regain some
confidence and ranking points in the absence of Venus and Serena
Williams, Capriati and Davenport. She will move back to No. 3 on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of levels it down a little bit that the top players
weren't here," Hingis said. "So I felt like, 'Well, this is an open
draw for me.' Kim [Clijsters] was injured coming into the tournament,
so I'm pretty much the favorite. So I just try to take my chance and
take advantage.... Nobody here, so go for it."</TE>
<TE>   Hantuchova held the same philosophy. Her side of the draw opened
after Clijsters had lost early, and she overcame a mental block by
finally beating a top player, Henin, in the third round.</TE>
<TE>   "She's always aspired to be in a big arena," Sears said. "She's
dreamed of being a big star. She's not interested in the small
tournaments. She has that mentality."</TE>
<TE>   Before they started working together, Sears asked Hantuchova to
identify her ultimate goal in tennis.</TE>
<TE>   "She said, 'No. 1,' just like that," Sears said. "And that was
good. She thinks big and I respect that."</TE>

<LD>What happened: It was a sloppy first half. Mississippi had 10
turnovers, UCLA eight. But the first one belonged to CBS, which
showed four minutes of commercials before joining the game after 1:40
had already been played. The way things started out it appeared as
though the erratic play of UCLA freshman Cedric Bozeman would hurt
the Bruins again. He dropped the ball out of bounds and then had a
bad pass shortly after CBS joined the game. And Matt Barnes, who
disappeared a few weeks ago, still hasn't shown up. But the play of
Billy Knight, and freshmen Dijon Thompson, Andre Patterson and Ryan
Walcott more than made up for Bozeman's bobbles and Barnes'
disappearance. UCLA had a 15-0 run to take a 28-13 lead. But three
consecutive three-pointers by Aaron Harper keyed an 11-0 run by
Mississippi, which got within 29-26. The Bruins finished the first
half with a 7-0 run to take a 36-26 lead.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: UCLA started its big first-half run after
Walcott replaced Bozeman. Thompson scored 10 points during the run.</LD>
<LD>   Winning number: Thompson made three of four shots and two of three
three-point shots during the big first-half run.</LD>
<TE>   Wrong number: Mississippi made only nine of 27 shots in the first
half and was six of 19 from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: UCLA--Knight 10, Thompson 10, Patterson 5, Dan
Gadzuric 5. Mississippi--Harper 12 (all on three-point shots, as he
made four of seven), Kendrick Fox 5.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: UCLA--Barnes 5, Gadzuric 5.
Mississippi--Harper 6, David Sanders 4.</TE>

<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>With "Final Four" scribbled on his shoes, fifth-year senior Rico
Hines played his best game of the season Friday, joining three
freshmen and a sophomore on a UCLA reserve unit that blinded
Mississippi with energy and intensity.</LD>
<LD>   Hines made his first three-point basket of the season, scored a
season-high seven points and had two steals in 16 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know if any of the guys knew I did it," he said of the
shoe art. "Getting to the Final Four was one of my goals when I
signed a letter of intent.</LD>
<TE>   "My roommate from high school, Nate James, got there with Duke.
Now I want to get there with my team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the four games leading up to the NCAA tournament, freshman
Dijon Thompson had dramatically improved his scoring, averaging 7.5
points in 12 minutes a game.</TE>
<TE>   The versatile 6-foot-7 wing from Redondo Union High made 10 of 15
field-goal attempts (66.7%) during the span, a vast improvement over
the previous 19 games, when he was 18 of 57 (31.6%).</TE>
<TE>   But no one could have expected his dynamic performance against
Mississippi, scoring a career-high 16 points on six-of-eight
shooting. He also had three steals and three rebounds in 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been more confident lately, especially when I play with the
reserve unit," he said. "With the second group, it's like I have to
score. We knew we'd be that spark and play important minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Now he's ready to play alongside veterans Jason Kapono, Matt
Barnes and Billy Knight without pressing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready to go out there with anybody now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This was the Bruins' second 22-point victory of the season over a
Southeastern Conference opponent.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins defeated Alabama, the No. 2-seeded team in the South
Regional, 79-57, on Dec. 8 in the John Wooden Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi split with Alabama, losing by 20 points at Tuscaloosa
and winning by 28 at Oxford.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What happened: The Bruins picked up where they left off, going on a
13-0 run at the start of the half to take a 49-26 lead. Billy Knight,
who made a three-point shot as time expired in the first half, made
three straight three-pointers to start UCLA off on the right track.
And Mississippi's Jason Harrison missed two more three-pointers
during the Bruin run. The Rebels' Justin Reed made a hook shot and a
layup to make it closer and Emmanuel Wade later made two
three-pointers in a row to cut UCLA's lead to 55-40. But everything
else went UCLA's way. Even Rico Hines was making shots.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: Not only did the Bruins have a big night
offensively, their defense was outstanding. Ole Miss made only 21 of
62 shots (34%) and 10 of 35 three-pointers.</LD>
<LD>   Winning number: The Bruins made 16 of 17 free throws. And UCLA's
reserves outscored the first unit, 42-38.</LD>
<TE>   Wrong number: Matt Barnes, Jason Kapono and Cedric Bozeman might
just as well have stayed home. Barnes made two of five shots, missing
all three of his three-point shots. Kapono made one of four shots and
had two points. It was goose eggs for Bozeman, despite his 13-inch
height advantage over Harrison. Bozeman finished with three turnovers
and Barnes had six.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: UCLA--Knight 11 (three of three on
three-pointers), Hines 7, Dijon Thompson 6. Mississippi--Justin Reed
10, Aaron Harper 7, Emmanuel Wade 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: UCLA--T.J. Cummings 6, Knight 4.
Mississippi--Reed 5, Harper 3.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jess Hansen never looked for a teammate, never looked to pass to
someone else to take the final shot.</LD>
<LD>   After leading her team back from a 13-point deficit, Hansen
figured it was time to be the hero.</LD>
<LD>   Hansen's leaning 16-footer between two defenders with 1.1 seconds
left helped UC Santa Barbara stun Louisiana Tech, 57-56, Friday night
in the first round of the East Regional at Austin, Texas.</LD>
<TE>   The victory extended the 12th-seeded Gauchos' winning streak to 22
and sends them to Sunday's second-round game against fourth-seeded
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The loss sent the fifth-seeded Lady Techsters (25-5) home after a
first-round loss in the NCAA tournament for the first time since
1992. Louisiana Tech was ranked eighth at the end of the regular
season.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen's buzzer-beater capped a frantic finish in which she scored
all of her 13 points in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   The Gauchos (26-5) trailed, 44-31, with 12:50 left. Hansen sparked
the rally with three three-point baskets and Kayte Christensen's
turnaround jumper gave Santa Barbara its first lead of the half,
55-54, with 2:14 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Brooke Lassiter put Louisiana Tech up, 56-55, with 1:39 left with
two free throws. It had a chance to extend its lead with 8.9 seconds
left when Christensen missed an eight-footer for the lead and Cheryl
Ford was fouled on the rebound.</TE>
<TE>   But Ford missed the front end of a one-and-one. UC Santa Barbara's
Lindsay Taylor grabbed the rebound and passed to Hansen, who dribbled
up court for the game winner.</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana Tech tried to set up one last play, but the 6-foot-8
Taylor blocked the inbounds pass by 5-9 Amber Obaze. With only 0.4
seconds left, Louisiana Tech couldn't get off a last shot.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever put them as a 12 seed didn't do their homework,"
Louisiana Tech Coach Leon Barmore said. "They were the toughest
opening-round opponent we've ever had."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other East Regional games:</TE>
<TE>   Texas 60, Wisconsin Green Bay 55--Asha Hill scored 14 points in
the second half for the Longhorns at Austin, Texas. Hill made all of
her shots--including four for four on three-point attempts and two
clinching free throws in the final seconds--for fourth-seeded Texas
(21-9).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duke 95, Norfolk State 48--Alana Beard scored 29 points as the
top-seeded Blue Devils raced to a 28-2 lead and led by as many as 55
at Durham, N.C. The Blue Devils (28-3) won a school-record 19th
consecutive game. Norfolk State ended 22-9.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Texas Christian 55, Indiana 45--Kati Safaritova scored 12 points
to help eighth-seeded TCU (24-6) win at Durham, N.C. Indiana (17-14),
making its first NCAA tournament appearance since 1995, shot only 24%
and committed 20 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Drake 87, Syracuse 69--Maureen Head scored 21 points to lead
seventh-seeded Drake at Waco, Texas. Leading 50-44 with just under 17
minutes remaining in the second half, the Bulldogs (24-7) went on a
17-3 run to put it out of reach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baylor 80, Bucknell 56--Steffanie Blackmon had 21 points and 11
rebounds for second-seeded Baylor (27-5) at Waco, Texas. Baylor shot

13 of her 16 points in the second half and Mandy Shafer made two key
three-point baskets for fifth-seeded Florida International at State
College, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   FIU (27-5) held Creighton scoreless over the last 4:47, with

with 2:17 left.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Behind triple security doors in an obscure industrial complex,
Boeing Co. engineers at the firm's little-known but pioneering Anaheim
unit are quietly working on a system that could alter the future of
warfare.</LD>
<LD>   Resembling a war room that seems modeled after a "Star Wars" movie, a
10-foot-high screen displays a satellite image of a region, with moving
squares and triangles identifying fighter jets, bombers and spy planes. A
second screen shows detailed infrared images of a building targeted for
possible attack. A third provides a live feed from a foot soldier wearing
a small video camera on his helmet.</LD>
<LD>   The images were part of a mock military operation in an unidentified
Middle Eastern region but provided a rare glimpse at what Boeing
officials believe represents the methods of war for the 21st century.
What the Pentagon has in mind over the next decade represents a huge leap
over even the seemingly sophisticated battle-management system it has
used in the Afghan conflict.</LD>
<TE>   Under the concept known as integrated battle space, U.S. military
leaders will have unprecedented access to information from anyplace
around the globe, tracking ships, planes, vehicles and individual
soldiers from a command and control center that could be thousands of
miles away. In essence, it would bring together disparate systems so they
can talk to one another and provide a common picture of the battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers would carry hand-held computers linked to satellites that
would provide not only their own precise location but also where the
enemy might be. The command center also could transmit detailed maps and
images of enemy compounds to soldiers anywhere in the world. Instead of
radio commands, marching orders may come via e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   "It represents a fundamental reversal of the way wars have been fought
for the past 2 1/2 centuries," said John Pike, director of
GlobalSecurity.org, a Web-based think tank in Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years ago, Norman Schwarzkopf had to pack up a small town and
move it to Saudi Arabia to fight the Gulf War. You won't have to do that
anymore. It'll be a lot like telecommuting."</TE>
<TE>Many Accomplishments</TE>
<TE>   And again, engineers in Anaheim are leading the way. A former Rockwell
International Corp. operation that Boeing acquired in 1996, the unit has
been a major technology center for decades, developing defense and
aerospace systems that have reshaped aerospace history.</TE>
<TE>   The guidance and control system for the Minuteman intercontinental
ballistic missile was developed in Anaheim, altering the course of the
Cold War. The division also developed major components of the Apollo
space program that put the first man on the moon. It did much of the
pioneering work on night vision during the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Now, it is the development center for the nation's multibillion-dollar
missile defense program and is competing to reshape and modernize the
Coast Guard.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the unit won one of its biggest trophies, a contract to
develop combat systems for the Army that has a potential value of at
least $4 billion over the next five years. As the lead system integrator,
a Boeing team will draw up plans for a system of new weapons and
technologies that the Army hopes will turn it into a lighter, faster and
more lethal force.</TE>
<TE>   The Army contract was a huge win because it validated a risky push by
Boeing officials to focus its resources and engineering talent on a
business that seemed more like a pie in the sky than a potential
revenue-generating operation.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when most defense contractors were focusing on developing
next-generation weapons, Boeing two years ago began looking at producing
a system of systems that would integrate disparate weapons and
technologies to provide a coherent strategy for fighting a war. A major
byproduct of the move was the creation of the Battlefield Integration
Center, a $16-million, 11,000-square-foot compound in Anaheim where much
of the integrated battle space is getting developed and tested.</TE>
<TE>   The timing could not have been better. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks and the subsequent military action in Afghanistan, scores of
Pentagon officials have visited the Anaheim facility. Army officials
cited Boeing's work on integrated battle space as one of the reasons for
the company winning the contract against Lockheed Martin Corp. and
General Dynamics Corp. Unlike the competitors, Boeing has had few Army
contracts.</TE>
<TE>Quest for Battle Data</TE>
<TE>   Military strategists have been after the Holy Grail of battlefield
intelligence--the ability to constantly monitor all military
activities--for decades in hopes of lifting the so-called fog of war, but
with the recent convergence of advanced communication equipment, highly
sensitive intelligence-gathering sensors and powerful computer chips, the
dream is becoming a reality.</TE>
<TE>   "Battles have been won or lost on incomplete information," said Loren
Thompson, a longtime Pentagon consultant and lecturer of defense policy
at Georgetown University. "This is one of the ways superior information
is going to dictate victory."</TE>
<TE>   Some elements of the integrated battle space already are taking shape,
particularly with military operations in Afghanistan. For the first time,
the commander of U.S. forces fighting overseas is running the operation
from within the U.S. at the headquarters of the Central Command in Tampa,
Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Some military leaders have said Army Gen. Tommy R. Frank should be
closer to action. Frank has defended the decision, saying he is getting
all the information he needs, thanks to the advances in high-speed
communications and information technology. The distant command center may
represent the emergence of a new way of fighting, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We can view and we can access any battle space," Air Force Chief of
Staff Gen. John P. Jumper said at a recent defense conference. "When air
and space combine together in the right ways . . . we can find, fix,
track, target, engage and assess anything of significance on the face of
Earth."</TE>
<TE>   But Jumper added, "Right now, I would argue, these are capabilities
that exists in bits and pieces. It is our job to pull it all together, to
be able to think in terms of integration."</TE>
<TE>   One vivid example was displayed last fall when, for the first time,
the White House was able to watch a live video feed of an attack on
Taliban forces in Afghanistan transmitted by a flying spy drone. The
video transmission was relayed by satellite to the Florida command
center, which then sent it on to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In another mission, an Army special operations soldier was able to
call in an airstrike, communicating directly with an Air Force bomber.
Previously, the Army would have had to request a strike through central
command, which then would relay the information to Air Force command to
carry out a strike, wasting invaluable time.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the top defense contractors are scrambling to tap the growing
market for integrated battle space, and all of the armed services are
developing their own concepts for the technology, also known as network
centric warfare, but Boeing engineers hope to field a system of systems
that can be used and seen across all the services.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Lockheed Martin Corp. has been a key player in creating such a
system for the Navy, while Raytheon Corp. has been looking to fuse many
of its weapons and systems for the Air Force. Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman
Corp. is making a hostile bid for TRW Inc. so that it can tap the
company's space and defense-electronics expertise and have the businesses
it needs to field its own version of an integrated battle space.</TE>
<TE>   Defense analysts said winning the Army contract was a major boost to
Boeing's effort in what many believe is the growth business of the
future.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing officials said they began talking about bringing together
various businesses that the aerospace firm operates to provide the
integrated battle space concept in 2000. The company made it a major
business initiative as Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld began pushing
for bringing the military into the digital age.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had some of Rumsfeld's people in here and this has been music
to their ears," said Roger Roberts, vice president of Boeing Integrated
Defense Systems. "We believe the vision for [an integrated battle space]
can be realized within the decade."</TE>
<TE>   The work could be lucrative. Boeing believes that putting together
various elements of the integrated battle space, including work in
unmanned aerial reconnaissance aircraft and equipping an older generation
of Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, already
represents a market of perhaps $7 billion to $8 billion a year. That
could grow to more than $20 billion in the next decade, Boeing officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe this will be a major growth area for us," said James F.
Albaugh, president of Boeing's Space and Communications unit. He noted
that one key reason for acquiring the satellite-making business of Hughes
Electronics for $3.8 billion last year was to tap its expertise in
space-based communications, which will be integral to developing the
requirements for an integrated battle space.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately, part of the effort could include equipping airborne
tankers--a constellation of which is constantly in the air to refuel
fighters and bombers--with antennae and electronic equipment that allow
the aircraft to relay data and communications from the battlefield to
far-flung command and control centers.</TE>
<TE>   "The technology is already here," said Ret. Lt. Gen. Carl O'Berry, a
former deputy chief for command, control, communications and computers
for the Air Force and now head of Boeing's strategic architecture unit.
"We just need to integrate it."</TE>

<HD>Raising the Bar on Chocolate</HD>
<DH>Specialty chocolatiers are introducing darker and not-so-sweet
'varietal' and 'estate' products, hoping profits will flow like wine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Swishing the smooth, dark blend around in his mouth, Gary Guittard
searches for the right words. "Astringent," he decides, "with some floral
notes."</LD>
<LD>   Zinfandel? Or maybe Merlot?</LD>
<LD>   No, chocolate. It's a semisweet made from Ecuadorean cocoa beans, just
one of the new "varietal" and "estate" chocolates hitting the market.</LD>
<TE>   Designed to attract would-be connoisseurs, these high-end chocolate
bars are made from different varieties of cocoa beans grown on
plantations around the world, from Venezuela to Trinidad to Madagascar.</TE>
<TE>   Just as different varieties of grapes bring their flavors to wine,
Guittard and other chocolatiers insist, the type and terroir of certain
cocoa beans bring subtle but distinct flavors to the chocolate they
produce.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuelan beans are spicy and nutty. Ecuadoreans have the floral
aroma of the rain forest.</TE>
<TE>   Chocolate lovers, they're betting, like wine lovers, will be willing
to shell out more for a little taste of what they believe to be the
finest the world has to offer. Like $3 to $7 for a 3-to-4-ounce bar.</TE>
<TE>   "If people hear something is the strongest in the world, they want to
taste it and say they like it," says Guittard, president of Guittard
Chocolate Co. in Burlingame, Calif. Right or wrong, he says, "it's got
snob appeal."</TE>
<TE>   Some believe these so-called origin bars and the flowery language used
to describe them is just marketing hype, a ploy to make people spend more
money on chocolate at a time when consumption appears ready to level off
in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   But if these cocoa pioneers have their way, the labels on chocolate
bars soon could be as crowded as wine labels--with descriptions of
special blends of beans, information about where the beans are grown,
cocoa percentages and, in some cases, even vintages so people can nibble
on a "good year." Chocolate shops could more closely resemble Starbucks,
with people choosing the blend of their beans as well as the fillings.</TE>
<TE>   And more Americans would choose chocolate to fit their mood rather
than simply look for "something sweet."</TE>
<TE>   That's still a long shot. Today, varietal chocolate is still very much
in its infancy, catching the fancy mainly of pastry chefs and foodies
looking for something new and exciting.</TE>
<TE>   But growing sales of these bars at gourmet shops such as Dean &amp;
DeLuca, at supermarkets such as Andronico's and Bristol Farms and online
could be an indication that American tastes are changing.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen a big increase in gourmet or specialty chocolates . . .
particularly in the dark, semisweet and 70% cocoa stuff, versus the
American milk chocolate," says Kevin Davis, president of Bristol Farms.
"People are fine-tuning their taste for chocolate."</TE>
<TE>   No one knows exactly how sales are progressing because most of the
premium chocolate makers and confectioners are private companies that
don't release sales figures.</TE>
<TE>   But there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that darker, not-so-sweet
chocolate is making inroads on America's beloved milk chocolate. That's
similar to how more complex, varietal wines began moving in on sweet
carafe wine in the U.S. in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers "have experienced better olive oil, coffee and wine in
recent years," says Pierrick Chouard, who heads Vintage Chocolates, an
Elizabeth, N.J.-based importer of Michel Cluizel varietal chocolates from
France. "Maybe they are finding out that the flavor of the food is not
linked to a [manufacturer] in Switzerland but to the place that it is
grown."</TE>
<TE>   Reviews in Wine Spectator and other publications describe these
chocolates in the same rhapsodic terms they would a California Cabernet
or a French Bordeaux. Venezuelan chocolate is "silky and smooth with
hints of black and red fruits," says Wine Spectator reviewer Sam Gugino.
Sumatran-bean chocolate, he says, has a "nice balance of cream, earth and
fruit, though it finishes a bit short."</TE>
<TE>   Executives at specialty chocolate enterprises naturally encourage
these wine-like comparisons.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to be the Chateau Mouton Rothschild of chocolate," says
Bernard DeClos, who imports varietal chocolate from French manufacturer
Valrhona.</TE>
<TE>   As far as big companies go, only Godiva, the large chocolate company
owned by Campbell Soup Co., appears to be considering a line of varietal
chocolates in the U.S. Hershey Foods Corp. and Nestle, the two giants in
American chocolate, are sticking to the proven mass market.</TE>
<TE>   Godiva officials say they are weighing whether to take a chance on
pure dark bars or to fill them with something sweet, such as a ganache or
praline cream.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to understand the role of origins," says Michael Simon,
Godiva Chocolatier's vice president of marketing. "We want products that
have a wide breadth of appeal for our consumers."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, consumers have begun demanding a broader range of
chocolate to choose from, whether it's more levels of bittersweet
chocolate or a new "dark milk" chocolate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no longer acceptable to just say dark chocolate, milk chocolate
or semisweet," says Michael Schneider, editor in chief of Chocolatier
magazine. "It's just not specific enough."</TE>
<TE>   Americans' chocolate consumption has been climbing over the last two
decades, as chocolate has found its way into more foods. It rose from 8
pounds per person each year in 1983 to 12 pounds today. That's still well
below the 22 pounds that the Swiss eat each year. However, some believe
that U.S. chocolate consumption is close to leveling off, having almost
fully penetrated the vast American market for snack foods.</TE>
<TE>   What Americans are eating is a little more expensive than it has been
in years past, says food marketing consultant Joan Steuer. Given the
rising sales of companies such as Godiva, she believes that consumers are
indulging in small bits of finer chocolate more often.</TE>
<TE>   Steuer calls it the "class-going-mass" phenomenon. As gourmet items
such as Ghirardelli chocolate have found their way into supermarkets and
drugstores, people's expectations have been raised.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same trend that has been going on with artisan cheese,
breads and microbreweries," she says. "There's a desire to look at the
origins of things and how they are made."</TE>
<TE>   There are two main types of specialty chocolate: blends and
single-origin, or estate, chocolate. Blends use cocoa beans of different
locales to achieve different flavors.</TE>
<TE>   Guittard's new E. Guittard Founder's Reserve line includes blends made
from cocoa beans grown on select estates in Ecuador, Colombia and
Venezuela, including his special L'Harmonie blend from a proprietary mix
of estate-grown beans. The beans from these regions are purported to have
stronger flavors than the mild African beans used in most candy bars.
African beans are used in small amounts to create these blends.</TE>
<TE>   Single-origin bars are for the chocolate purist. They are made from
beans from a single source, much like estate-bottled wine.</TE>
<TE>   Valrhona's $6 Gran Couva bar, for instance, is made from beans grown
on one company-owned plantation in Trinidad, where it controls production
from start to finish.</TE>
<TE>   Michel Cluizel has a line of both single-origin Gran Cru chocolates
and varietal blends designed to leave chocolate lovers with several
layers of flavor in their mouths.</TE>
<TE>   Pastry chefs and confectioners argue constantly about which is better,
single-origin chocolates or blends, just as winemakers argue the pros and
cons of estate wine.</TE>
<TE>   Even more important, Guittard says, is how the beans are handled once
they are taken from the pods of the cacao tree. If they are dried too
fast after harvesting or dried by fire, they can develop off or smoky
tastes. If they aren't fermented long enough, the beans remain bitter and
don't develop a strong chocolate flavor.</TE>
<TE>   The roast is important too. A dark roast can turn bitter even the most
mellow bean.</TE>
<TE>   Chocolate is made by roasting cocoa beans, removing the shells and
then crushing and heating the "nib," or meat of the bean, until it forms
a thick paste called chocolate liquor.</TE>
<TE>   The liquor is combined with cocoa butter, sugar, milk and vanilla. It
is mixed and then "conched," or stirred under heat for a few hours to a
few days to reduce undesirable odors and reduce the size of the
particles.</TE>
<TE>   It's then poured into molds for bars or wafers.</TE>
<TE>   The best chocolate, Schneider says, is the chocolate with the most
cocoa butter.</TE>
<TE>   This gives it that melt-in-your-mouth quality that lingers after the
chocolate is gone. Big chocolate manufacturers such as Mars Inc., Nestle
and Hershey usually use a smaller percentage of cocoa and less cocoa
butter, more sugar or sometimes sorbitol (a sweetener) to give their
products a longer shelf life.</TE>
<TE>   Chocolate doesn't have to be expensive to be good. Strict government
standards for chocolate in the U.S. keep unwanted fillers and oils out of
most candy.</TE>
<TE>   "I eat M&amp;Ms, and I don't care who knows it," Schneider says.</TE>
<TE>   But when he wants something decadent or different, he says, he turns
to premium artisan chocolate.</TE>
<TE>   Confectioners and pastry chefs at fine restaurants are buying most of
the darker varietal chocolate and giving people their first taste.
Restaurants are peddling Valrhona chocolate cake, Scharffen Berger
chocolate ice cream and Guittard enrobed caramels for dessert.</TE>
<TE>   Gourmet specialty stores such as Williams-Sonoma and Dean &amp; DeLuca
also are beginning to stock it, as are Whole Foods and other high-end
supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   However, just because these varietal chocolates are gaining acceptance
doesn't mean consumers will be willing to pay a big premium for them, as
they do for fine wine.</TE>
<TE>   Chocolate, after all, doesn't provide the same buzz that wine gives
those who drink it.</TE>
<TE>   It's a more fleeting pleasure. Chocolate, unlike a good Burgundy,
doesn't mature and evolve over time. "Nobody is opening 95-year-old boxes
of chocolate," Schneider says. "You can't. It would be disgusting."</TE>

<DH>Conflict: Zinni calls on Sharon, Arafat to halt the violence. In
Gaza, 8 Palestinians die in separate incidents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>U.S. envoy Anthony C. Zinni tried to push Israeli and Palestinian
leaders toward a cease-fire Friday, as residents of this battered city
emerged from their homes for the first time since Israeli tanks withdrew.</LD>
<LD>   Israel had sent more than 100 tanks into the Palestinians' most
important city Monday night in what it said was an effort to destroy
militias based here. As the gunmen fought, or hid, within a civilian
population of 60,000, tanks crushed cars, reduced stone walls around
gardens to rubble and felled lampposts and utility poles.</LD>
<LD>   The bullets and shells that flew during gun battles between Israeli
troops and Palestinian militias damaged dozens of homes and businesses.
Most of the commercial district remained closed Friday, hours after the
tanks withdrew Thursday night.</LD>
<TE>   In central Manara Square, someone had leaned metal plates from an
Israeli tank against the paws of one of four stone lions that stand
sentry over the square's long-broken fountain. Gunmen boasted that the
plates were evidence of the fight they had put up against the vastly
better trained and better armed Israeli troops.</TE>
<TE>   But the death toll told a different story. Twelve Palestinian police
officers and gunmen died here in the fighting. One Israeli soldier was
killed. The armed men who flooded the streets here to chant nationalistic
slogans and demand revenge at the funerals Friday had offered only
sporadic resistance when the troops took control of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Zinni, who began his mission by meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon on Thursday night in Jerusalem and demanding a full pullout
of Israeli forces from Palestinian-controlled areas, came to Ramallah on
Friday night to demand that Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat
rein in militants and enforce a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   The two emerged smiling from a 90-minute session at Arafat's Ramallah
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Zinni, a retired Marine Corps general, described his meeting with the
Israeli and Palestinian leaders as "extremely positive. I think everyone
is committed to get out of this terrible situation."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush "has laid out a vision and a plan," Zinni said. "I'm
here to help both sides implement that plan, and I am encouraged that we
are going to identify the mechanism that will allow us to implement that
plan. I think that, in the next few days, we can start in the
implementation of the plan that we have brought."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat said he was committed to the peace process and hoped that
"President Bush, the son," will complete the peace process between Israel
and the Arabs that his father began at the 1991 Madrid peace conference.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, meeting Friday with U.S. troops in North Carolina, said he was
"very pleased" with the Israeli withdrawal from Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things we've got to do is to work with both parties to
establish the conditions for eventual peace. And I appreciate Prime
Minister Sharon's decision" to pull out, he said. "Gen. Zinni is in the
region now. We're hopeful that he'll have an impact on setting the
conditions for peace."</TE>
<TE>   But Israel's largest military operation in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip since the 1967 Middle East War, launched two weeks before Zinni's
arrival, has left deep scars among Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Israel said it had no choice but to go after militias inside
Palestinian-controlled areas after a string of deadly attacks on
Israelis. Arafat, Sharon said, was encouraging the attacks rather than
trying to stop them.</TE>
<TE>   Troops rounded up thousands of men for questioning, occupied or blew
up homes and killed dozens of people as they searched for wanted men,
their explosives laboratories and weapons. Many Palestinians in Ramallah
said Friday that they are convinced that Israel, or at least Sharon's
government, has little interest in peace.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, eight Palestinians died in several incidents in the Gaza
Strip. Among them was an Islamic Jihad militant shot dead by troops as he
tried to infiltrate a Jewish settlement, and two Palestinian policemen
shot dead in separate incidents. The army said they were planting bombs
at two border crossings.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday evening, a woman and four children died in an explosion that
each side blamed on the other. Zeina Awawda, 45, was driving in a donkey
cart with three of her four children and her nephew near the Palestinian
refugee camp of Bureij when there was a huge explosion, Palestinian
witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a crime the Israelis committed against a mother and her
children," said Abdel Razek Majaydeh, chief of Palestinian police in
Gaza. Israeli tanks had withdrawn from the area overnight. But a
spokesman for the Israeli army's Southern Command, who declined to be
named, said the cart was blown up by a bomb placed by Palestinians, "who
apparently were trying to hit our military vehicles."</TE>
<TE>   Some Ramallah residents voiced hope Friday that Israel's pullout from
their city and from the West Bank towns of Kalkilya and Tulkarm was the
prelude to a cease-fire after 17 1/2 months of fighting that has killed
about 1,400 Arabs and Jews.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard the United States ordered them to leave," said Abdul Daas,
41, referring to a telephone call that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
made to Sharon before Zinni arrived in Jerusalem. "I think this time, the
end is in sight."</TE>
<TE>   He sat in the ruins of his Chicken Hut restaurant near Manara Square
as he spoke. Bullets and shrapnel had shattered the eatery's glass front
and damaged its refrigerators and cooking units. A second Chicken Hut he
owns in another part of town sustained similar damage, he said. Repairing
both of them would cost $20,000, he estimated, but he was determined to
rebuild.</TE>
<TE>   A naturalized U.S. citizen who owns restaurants in Virginia, Daas said
he moved his family to Ramallah when it appeared that Israel and the
Palestinians were going to sign a final peace treaty. "I came here three
years ago to try to help out my country," he said. "I'm not going to
leave. I'm not going to run away from this problem."</TE>
<TE>   The events of the last 17 1/2 months had taken their toll, financially
and emotionally, he said. But they haven't caused him to despair of
achieving Palestinian statehood.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. interest now is to finish up this problem so that they can
be ready for other problems, like Iraq," he said. That is why, Daas said
confidently, Zinni has been sent to the region: to put an end to the
fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Not far from Daas' ruined restaurant, Intissar Bakr, 23, sat with her
two small sons and a group of neighbors in the Kaddoura neighborhood near
Ramallah Hospital. The charred wrecks of half a dozen cars lay within a
block of the small group huddled on a debris-strewn sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting raged here when the Israelis moved in Monday night, Bakr
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were absolutely terrified," she said. "It was hell."</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli tank shell hit steel tanks filled with cooking gas outside
the Ali Baba "broasted" chicken restaurant next to Bakr's apartment as
the battle continued, she said. The tanks exploded in a ball of flames,
leaving the restaurant a burned-out shell, destroying the nearby cars,
blowing out windows in apartments on either side of the street and
shaking her building to its foundations.</TE>
<TE>   "The children screamed hysterically," she said. Her family members
fled to a neighbor's home as their apartment filled with thick dark
smoke. They returned Friday to find their windows shattered, walls pocked
with bullet holes and the water and electricity cut.</TE>

<HD>Lindh Stayed in the Taliban Out of Fear, His Lawyers Say</HD>
<DH>Courts: U.S. knows that their client never harmed Americans or
conspired, the defense contends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawyers for John Walker Lindh, the American Taliban prisoner
captured in Afghanistan, said in court papers released Friday that he
never rejoiced over the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and that he remained
with his front-line fighting unit only because he feared he would be
killed if he tried to leave.</LD>
<LD>   Providing the first detailed look at his defense, Lindh's attorneys
also rejected the government's claim that Lindh attempted to kill
Americans during the Afghan war, saying he was attempting to run away
when shooting broke out in a prison camp and he was wounded in the leg.</LD>
<LD>   Lindh never "intended or attempted to take any actions to attack U.S.
military forces or did anything other than remain with Taliban forces in
a defensive position," the lawyers asserted.</LD>
<TE>   The revelations, made public in federal court filings in Alexandria,
Va., provide a preview of how defense attorneys for the son of a
prominent Northern California lawyer hope to win his release.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's trial on murder conspiracy charges is set to begin in August.
If convicted, he faces a maximum prison term of life without parole.</TE>
<TE>   The defense, while unveiling strategic points of their case, also
complained that the government has known all along that Lindh, 21, never
conspired or harmed any Americans and that, once he was captured, he told
his U.S. interrogators that he was "disillusioned" by the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But, the defense claimed, the government never released that side of
the story, even though it would have helped the defense and, they said,
would have provided a more balanced picture of Lindh when much of the
U.S. was angry over his role in the war.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the defense argued, Washington was too busy generating public
opinion against the man many Americans immediately viewed as a traitor.</TE>
<TE>   Government prosecutors did not immediately respond in court to the
defense assertions, and repeated requests for comment from the U.S.
attorney's office went unanswered.</TE>
<TE>   Since Lindh was charged and then later indicted by a federal grand
jury, the government has characterized him as a young man who tossed
aside his American citizenship after he left the United States to study
Islam in Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have said he trained in a foreign terrorist camp, met with
suspected terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden and pledged allegiance to
the Taliban regime. The government has also released e-mails Lindh sent
home to Marin County that prosecutors say show he had no remorse over the
Sept. 11 attacks and had forsaken his American upbringing.</TE>
<TE>   Further, the government has said Lindh conspired to kill Americans in
the Afghan war, including CIA specialist Johnny "Mike" Spann, who died
during an uprising at the Qala-i-Janghi prison there.</TE>
<TE>   But the defense provided a starkly different story Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's lawyers said government officials have released only partial
summaries of their interrogations with their client and have conveniently
left out key portions of his statements that would tend to exonerate him.</TE>
<TE>   "Significantly," the lawyers said, "there are important
inconsistencies between these two versions of what Mr. Lindh allegedly
said to his interrogators in December."</TE>
<TE>   As a key instance, the defense pointed to Lindh's statements about the
Sept. 11 attacks in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "The December summaries, for example, report that Mr. Lindh was
obviously disillusioned when he learned of the attacks on the World Trade
Center and wanted to leave his Taliban unit but could not do so for fear
of death," the defense said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet the reports in mid-January--at a time when Mr. Lindh's case was
the subject of frequent negative public commentary by government
officials, intense media coverage and almost daily public opinion
polls--omit reference to these statements."</TE>
<TE>   The defense said there are other government reports that are similarly
"incomplete and inconsistent," in which "names, dates, times, conditions
and other relevant information are missing to varying degrees."</TE>
<TE>   To bolster their case that Lindh was not the sinister renegade
depicted by the government, the defense also cited statements from some
government officials that they said show their client tried to help the
U.S. cause.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, they said, Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, stated at one point that Lindh "has provided, at least
from the Afghan viewpoints, some useful information and probably will
continue to do so."</TE>
<TE>   The defense also sought to knock down the government's argument that
Lindh was among the prisoners trying to shoot their way out of the
Qala-i-Janghi camp. Spann, who had just finished interviewing Lindh when
the riot broke out, was killed.</TE>
<TE>   "He had nothing to do with Mr. Spann's death," the defense said.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, they quoted from an FBI affidavit by Special Agent Anne Asbury
containing Lindh's account of the uprising at the prison. Lindh told U.S.
interrogators that "after the interview [with Spann], he was moved to a
lawn where others whose interrogations had been completed had been
moved," according to the affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   "Shortly thereafter, Walker [as he was known then] heard shots and
screaming from the basement. Walker further stated that, upon hearing
this, Walker got up and tried to run, but was shot in the leg and
collapsed in the yard," the affidavit said.</TE>
<TE>   "Walker stated that he remained lying in the yard until he was brought
to the basement by his comrades. Walker claims not to have seen what had
happened to the two Americans who had interviewed him."</TE>
<TE>   Once he was captured, Lindh was kept in harsh conditions while he was
being interrogated, including for a while stripped naked and placed in a
large metal container, the documents said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the defense complained, he was paraded in front of U.S.
military forces so that troops could pose for "souvenir photographs" with
the now-famous prisoner.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors must respond to the defense assertions by March
29. A pretrial hearing in the matter is scheduled for April 1.</TE>

<HD>The Collapse of Mexico's 'Invincible' Drug Cartel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA
</DL>
<LD>He was the muscle for Mexico's most feared drug cartel, and he was
looking to use it. As revelers filled the streets of Mazatlan for its
annual carnival, Ramon Arellano Felix cruised the beach strip like a
shark, hunting for a rival.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, he ended up the victim, killed in a shootout with police who
had stopped his white Volkswagen for driving in the wrong lane.
Officially, it was a chance confrontation: The officers opened fire after
Ramon brandished a weapon and ran. But some think the police were gunning
for the 37-year-old enforcer, possibly as proxies for Ismael Zambada, the
rival drug boss whom Ramon was in town to kill.</LD>
<LD>   Either way, the death of Ramon Arellano Felix on Feb. 10, followed by
the capture of his brother Benjamin, 50, in Puebla on March 9, was
stunning proof that the luck of the world's most wanted drug traffickers
had taken a wrong turn after a decade of seeming invincibility.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout the 1990s, the Arellano Felix gang had maintained an iron
grip on the smuggling of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamines
up the Tijuana-San Diego corridor. They had corrupted officials and
police with millions of dollars in bribes and intimidated others with
spectacular killings, of police chiefs, prosecutors and even children.</TE>
<TE>   The demise of the brothers, literally or figuratively, made law
enforcement officials happy and hopeful that the government of President
Vicente Fox was finally delivering on its promise of a crackdown on drug
trafficking.</TE>
<TE>   But the victory over the Arellano Felixes has its dark side.
Authorities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border predict a bloody
struggle for dominance over this key piece of "narco-geography."
Challenges to their cartel will come from outside and within, said
Michael G. Garland, former head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration's Mexico unit.</TE>
<TE>   "You can expect a period of violence, first to settle vendettas and
then as people try to position themselves to take over," said Garland,
who said he believes that the Arellano Felix organization has been
"mortally wounded."</TE>
<TE>Struggle Seen as Having Little Effect on Supply</TE>
<TE>   The first victim apparently has already fallen. Rodolfo Carrillo
Barragan, a law professor and attorney who represented the Arellano Felix
clan in its dealings around Mexico, was found dead in the garage of his
Tijuana condominium Monday night with a bullet wound to the head.</TE>
<TE>   Typical of the wild speculation running rampant here, some theorize
that he was killed by his own employers because he knew too much of the
cartel's inner workings. Others think he was hit by an outside gang
trying to sow chaos amid the Arellano Felix ranks.</TE>
<TE>   The oncoming struggle for cartel predominance will do little to impede
the flow of drugs to the United States, experts agree, because consumer
demand is still strong and the corrupt infrastructure that smugglers use
remains in place.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the capture and death of the Arellano Felix brothers was a
blow to drug trafficking, Arturo Guevara Valenzuela, the federal attorney
general's delegate in Baja California state, responded: "Let me answer
that question with a question. Will the capture in any way affect demand
for drugs in the United States? Doubtful."</TE>
<TE>   For years, while other traffickers were being jailed, the myth and
mystery of the Arellano Felixes' longevity and invincibility only grew.</TE>
<TE>   But in reality, the sprawling family empire founded on corruption and
violence was reeling even before the brothers' downfall. Arrests of key
lieutenants, increasing pressure from competing gangs angling for a piece
of the Tijuana-San Diego turf and the rising heat from Fox's newly
reinforced anti-drug forces in Baja had boxed in the Arellanos.</TE>
<TE>   Fox quietly moved 1,300 units of the Federal Preventive Police into
Baja earlier this year--units that Baja observers say are actually army
soldiers. State Atty. Gen. Antonio Martinez Luna said the presence of the
units has made a huge difference in anti-drug enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Erroll Chavez, special agent in charge of the DEA's San Diego office,
also gave credit to the Mexican government. "There had been progress for
the last five years, albeit a bit slow," he said, "and it gave us reason
to believe that President Fox would deliver on his promise."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, Tijuana was the scene of immense carnage as the Arellano
Felix cartel consolidated its grip on the Tijuana-to-Mexicali turf, or
"plaza," as the drug-smuggling corridor is referred to. The Arellanos
ruthlessly attacked anyone who threatened their franchise.</TE>
<TE>   They weren't above killing children to make a statement, as shown by
the massacre of three families in Ensenada in 1998 who investigators say
were impinging on the Arellano Felix marijuana monopoly. J. Jesus
Blancornelas, editor of Tijuana's Zeta newspaper, barely survived an
assassination attempt that killed a bodyguard in 1997. San Diego
Union-Tribune reporter Greg Gross was also on the Arellano Felix hit
list, said the DEA's Chavez, prompting Gross' employers to transfer him
out of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Former DEA agent Garland testified to the brutality. "If you are late
paying the Arellanos, you won't get a nicely worded letter saying your 30
days were up," he said. "But you might get a finger of your child in the
mail."</TE>
<TE>   The Arellano Felixes established their violent pattern soon after
arriving in Tijuana in the mid-1980s. They had learned violence at the
feet of a master, their uncle Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, a gangster
from Sinaloa state who, with Rafael Caro Quintero, was imprisoned for the
1985 torture-murder of DEA agent Enrique S. Camarena.</TE>
<TE>   Before going to jail, Felix Gallardo divided up his smuggling domain
geographically in hopes of avoiding a free-for-all. His nephews took over
cigarettes and alcohol in Tijuana, expanding to marijuana and cocaine.
The Arellano Felixes quickly perceived the importance of controlling the
Tijuana-San Diego plaza, an ideal smuggling platform.</TE>
<TE>   "Mules," or drug couriers, could easily blend in among the tens of
thousands of people who move daily across the border there. The crossing
point is highly coveted: There are dense metropolitan areas on either
side where smugglers can hide and where drugs can be stored in warehouses
without attracting notice.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to cross 2 tons of cocaine, where would you rather
cross it--San Ysidro or Del Rio, Texas, where you are hundreds of miles
away from a transportation hub?" said Donald E. Robinson, special agent
with the FBI in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   As former DEA agent Garland points out, the Arellano Felix cartel was
typical of Mexican traffickers in that it never learned to cooperate with
rivals, like Colombian cartels did, and vicious fighting broke out. The
cartel insisted on a massive cut of any drugs that moved through its
turf, which other mobsters resisted.</TE>
<TE>   One especially recalcitrant trafficker was Ismael Zambada, who
reportedly refused to pay $20 million to the Arellano Felix gang for the
right to use the northern Baja corridor to smuggle drugs into the United
States. Ramon was reportedly in Mazatlan in February to kill Zambada in
revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Gonzalo Curiel said there is also evidence that
Zambada--who is believed to have been behind the killing of Tijuana
Police Chief Alfredo de la Torre in February 2000--was encroaching on the
Arellano Felixes' heroin traffic, another reason for Ramon to make his
fatal trip to Mazatlan.</TE>
<TE>All the Trappings of a Multinational Firm</TE>
<TE>   As it grew, the Arellano Felix organization took on the
characteristics of a transnational corporation. Benjamin flew to
Colombia, Peru and Panama to seal multi-ton drug deals worth $40 million
each. They developed monopolies of not just cocaine but heroin, marijuana
and methamphetamines.</TE>
<TE>   Among the businesses that the U.S. Treasury Department alleges the
gang has used to launder its cash is the Farmacia Vida chain, which also
has served to secure the cartel primary ingredients for methamphetamines.</TE>
<TE>   There were complicated logistics to work out, with most shipments of
drugs in recent years arriving via boat either on the Pacific Coast of
central Mexico or directly to Baja.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agent Robinson said the preferred maritime logistics currently
involve high-speed cigarette boats that bring drugs up to Mexico from
Colombia. They're refueled along the way by "logistical support vessels,"
or, as Robinson described them, "floating gas stations."</TE>
<TE>   There was also the crucial task of corrupting U.S. immigration and
customs agents to ensure that big shipments were waved across the border.</TE>
<TE>   But that has been getting tougher to do, officials say. U.S. Atty.
Patrick K. O'Toole, in charge of the San Diego-based Southern District of
California, said "two or three" agents have been prosecuted per year
since 1990, whereas virtually none were prosecuted in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the cartel suffered a major blow in March 2000 when Jesus
"El Chuy" Labra, the financial mastermind of the cartel, was arrested.
Then, in May 2000, Ismael Higuera Guerrero, the gang's so-called chief
operating officer, was captured in Ensenada.</TE>
<TE>   As for Benjamin Arellano Felix, he may have been done in simply by
solid police work. Authorities had gotten wind of regular courier
deliveries of cash from Tijuana to Benjamin, who was hiding out in
Puebla, east of Mexico City, and they simply tracked them, sources said.
Also, one of Benjamin's daughters suffers from a rare dermatological
condition, and her treatment left leads for agents to pursue.</TE>
<TE>   In a macabre twist, Benjamin also provided the proof that closed the
case on his brother.</TE>
<TE>   The body of the man shot to death in Mazatlan had been cremated, and
the bloodstains on the victim's shirt were the only evidence authorities
had to go on for identification. This week, DNA tests using blood drawn
from Benjamin confirmed what was widely believed: The dead man was indeed
his brother.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Priests Anguished, Angry Over Sex Scandals</HD>
<DH>Clergy: At a workshop on abuse, some say they fear to hug children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roman Catholic priests in Los Angeles expressed frustration and
anguish Friday as they attended a mandatory archdiocesan workshop on sex
abuse ordered by Cardinal Roger M. Mahony.</LD>
<LD>   The archdiocese characterized the session as regularly scheduled
training planned months ago. But it came at a time when many priests
already feel under siege--victims of the national furor over clergy sex
abuse that began earlier this year in Boston.</LD>
<LD>   "Catholic priests feel they're being picked on," said Father John Raab
of the Claretian Renewal Center in Los Angeles, one of more than 200
priests who attended the workshop at St. Agatha Church in southwest Los
Angeles. "People feel that, because the Catholic Church has so much
centralized money, it gets the lawsuits and news."</LD>
<TE>   Several priests lamented that the furor has caused them to shrink back
from normal gestures of affection, such as hugging children.</TE>
<TE>   Father Roger Labonte of Holy Family Church in South Pasadena said he
has found himself hesitating over whether to place his hands on a
parishioner's head during absolution rituals, straighten an altar
server's collar or even take some neighborhood children to a movie. After
Mass last Sunday, he said, several children ran to him, hugging his legs,
but he kept his arms straight at his side.</TE>
<TE>   Labonte, a Canadian native who said that touch is important in his
culture, said the self-imposed restrictions are "just not me."</TE>
<TE>   "I can't pick the children up and hug them and squeeze them," said
Labonte, 48, who quit an accounting career eight years ago to become a
priest and is particularly popular with children, who are drawn to his
youthful energy. "I think we're guilty until proven innocent and that's a
sad thing."</TE>
<TE>   Father David O'Connell of St. Frances X. Cabrini Church in Los Angeles
said he now simply shakes hands with everyone, children and adults alike,
to be safe. While that change saddens him, he said, it is for the good of
the church.</TE>
<TE>   "If it will help people trust in us as priests, it's better that way,"
said O'Connell, an Irish native and labor activist who last week helped
Los Angeles International Airport workers demonstrate for higher wages.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony ordered all priests in public ministry to attend the workshops,
which are being held this week and next week throughout the region. The
workshops reviewed the Los Angeles Archdiocese's sexual abuse policies,
offered advice on how to maintain "healthy boundaries" and instructed
priests on legal reporting requirements for suspected child abuse.
Priests were also asked to sign a statement saying they had received a
copy of the sex-abuse policies.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocesan spokesman Tod Tamberg said the signed statements were
required by a multimillion-dollar legal settlement last year involving a
former Orange County priest and a man who was one of his high school
students. The settlement covered both the Diocese of Orange and the Los
Angeles Archdiocese, which includes Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa
Barbara counties. The workshops were planned independently, Tamberg said.</TE>
<TE>   For many of the priests, the workshop provided the first time to
gather and share their feelings since allegations of widespread abuse in
the Boston Archdiocese fanned the issue into a national firestorm. During
a question-and-answer period, according to those present, priests raised
several concerns, including whether to hug a child on a playground, keep
confessions confidential and whether innocent priests would be duly
protected with legal representation.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the national debate has focused on the oversight of priests
found to have engaged in child molestation who were reassigned instead of
fired. The Los Angeles Archdiocese recently dismissed or forced the
retirement of a number of priests, sources have said. The archdiocese has
declined to comment on those reports. The Los Angeles Police Department
this week said it had begun examining whether any of the departed priests
may have committed a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony addressed Friday's training session, according to those
present, telling priests he had suffered sleepless nights over the furor,
that no suspected child abuser was working in the archdiocese and that
any priest found guilty of child abuse would be dismissed and encouraged
to leave the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   The new dismissal rules reflect a consensus among medical experts that
pedophilia is incurable. Previous archdiocesan policies, first
promulgated by Mahony in 1988, allowed the possibility of treatment and a
return to ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the news focus on accountability, several of the priests said
they felt besieged by a public perception of rampant sex abuse in the
priesthood. Father Greg Boyle, who helps rehabilitate hundreds of gang
members through jobs in his Homeboy Industries, said he now feels
solidarity with the legions of good Los Angeles police officers who were
tainted by a few bad cops in the Rampart corruption scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to say, 'That's not me,' " Boyle said.</TE>
<TE>   At least one priest said he welcomed the furor. Father Tracy
O'Sullivan of St. Raphael Church said the church in general had "made
mistakes" in covering the problem up in the past and that the current
public outcry would help correct that error.</TE>
<TE>   As society in general has become more open in confronting pedophilia
with new laws and better understanding of the illness, the church has
struggled to keep up with the changes, O'Sullivan said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's healthy what's going on," O'Sullivan said.</TE>

<HD>Oscar Fever Is Pushing the Envelope of Civility</HD>
<DH>Awards: The fight for best picture turns ugly, with much of the
nastiness targeted against 'A Beautiful Mind.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the Academy Awards race heads into the final stretch, the
campaign for best picture has turned increasingly nasty, much of it
centered on an alleged smear campaign against best picture nominee "A
Beautiful Mind."</LD>
<LD>   The Universal Pictures film, an early favorite to win Oscar's top
prize, has been under attack by what the studio says are cheap shots,
falsehoods and innuendo designed to sway academy voters.</LD>
<LD>   Behind the scenes, in a flurry of phone calls and e-mails, studios
have been accusing one another of spreading damaging stories to the
entertainment media. Those accused include 20th Century Fox, which is
promoting its best picture nominee, "Moulin Rouge," and Miramax, which is
promoting "In the Bedroom" for the top award. Both studios vigorously
deny the allegations. Voting for the Academy Awards ends Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   This year's Oscar campaigning has been so nasty that it has invoked
comparisons with some of the nation's most infamous political campaigns,
including Richard M. Nixon's "dirty tricks"' and the tactics used by the
late Republican strategist Lee Atwater to help George Bush defeat
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no longer a whisper campaign; it's more a yelling campaign,"
said Terry Press, marketing chief for DreamWorks, which owns the foreign
rights to "A Beautiful Mind." "I feel every day like we all need to take
a shower, and I don't want to feel that way."</TE>
<TE>   Among the reasons cited for the intensity of the campaign are the
heightened influence of the Internet and the mainstream media's
increasing tendency to mine it for stories; the millions of dollars at
stake for the studios, which profit mightily from an Academy Award; and
the rabid competition to win the best picture title. Universal, in
particular, has waged an aggressive, expensive campaign to promote the
Oscar chances of "A Beautiful Mind," including color inserts in
home-delivered editions of the Los Angeles Times.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time this happens [next year], whoever is being attacked
should put their foot down and say, 'Not again,' " said Terry Curtin, who
heads publicity at Universal. "Everybody has participated in letting it
get too far."</TE>
<TE>   For those outside Hollywood, the Academy Awards would seem to be a
time of celebration, when the industry honors its own in a glamorous
event viewed by a worldwide audience. But to the studios, it has become
an increasingly serious business as Oscar ad campaigns have grown more
expensive and the financial implications of the awards have risen.</TE>
<TE>   Many Hollywood observers trace the growing nastiness to the 1998 best
picture battle between Miramax ("Shakespeare in Love") and DreamWorks
("Saving Private Ryan")--a battle won by Miramax at great cost.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Godsick, vice president of domestic marketing for Fox, said
the responsibility is shared by the Internet, the media that cover
entertainment and the dozens of groups that give out awards.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that for anything to change, it's going to have to be
self-policed," Godsick said. "Maybe that is the evolution that will come
out of this year. Maybe people will learn from this."</TE>
<TE>   This year's campaign turned ugly around the time of the Golden Globe
nominations in December. Reporters were alerted by a Miramax Oscar
consultant about a Matt Drudge piece stating that scenes from Sylvia
Nasar's book "A Beautiful Mind" involving its subject, John Nash, and his
alleged homosexual liaisons, had been taken out of the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Mainstream media critics had previously accused "A Beautiful Mind" of
being flawed, saying the filmmakers had left out many aspects of Nash's
life to make the movie more palatable and dramatic. Indeed, the film
takes such liberties with certain facts that the studio describes it only
as being "inspired by" Nash's life.</TE>
<TE>   The situation is reminiscent of the sinking Oscar chances for
Universal's 1999 film "The Hurricane." Makers of that movie were accused
of watering down and changing the facts of the story to enhance their
film. The studio learned from the debacle and responded forcefully to
allegations of inaccuracy in "A Beautiful Mind."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Universal's efforts, Internet writers like Drudge, FoxNews.com
columnist Roger Friedman, Jeffrey Wells at reel.com, various Internet
Oscar sites and journalists from the New York Post, the Times of London,
Entertainment Weekly and other outlets continued to refer to what
Universal called unsubstantiated claims about Nash's personal life.</TE>
<TE>   The situation reached a crescendo in late February, however, when
Drudge and the New York Post, quoting a 1967 letter Nash wrote, called
the mathematician "a rabid anti-Semite." What was left out of context was
that Nash was suffering through a bout with paranoid schizophrenia when
he wrote the letter.</TE>
<TE>Attacks on Nash Draw Heated Response</TE>
<TE>   The effort to paint Nash as an anti-Semite was seen by many in
Hollywood as a flagrant attempt to discredit "A Beautiful Mind" with the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' many Jewish members (the
academy does not do a demographic breakdown of its membership). Before
Universal could respond, the hosts of the popular ABC daytime show "The
View" were commenting on how Nash's anti-Semitic views should have been
included in the movie. Suddenly, talk radio was telling listeners to call
in with their votes on whether Nash was anti-Semitic or not.</TE>
<TE>   Universal went on the counter-attack. "Beautiful Mind" director Ron
Howard said that he took the accusations against Nash personally and felt
that the Nobel Prize-winning professor's reputation was being unfairly
tarnished--sentiments echoed last week by Universal Pictures Chairwoman
Stacey Snider in the Hollywood Reporter. At an academy nominee luncheon
in Beverly Hills, usually a celebratory affair, Howard compared the
anti-"Beautiful Mind" campaign to smears against the Dukakis campaign in
1988.</TE>
<TE>   In an op-ed piece this week for The Times, author Nasar tried to set
the record straight on Nash's personal life. She concluded that most
journalists were interested in hearing "tabloid fare." Movie critic Roger
Ebert wrote a column defending "A Beautiful Mind," calling "the mugging
of this film . . . the most disturbing element of this year's Oscar
race." On Sunday, in an interview on CBS' "60 Minutes," Nash will
reportedly say allegations that he is homosexual and anti-Semitic are
untrue.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax Co-Chairman Harvey Weinstein, whose studio has often been at
the heart of cutthroat Oscar competition, tried to distance himself from
the fray by knocking on "A Beautiful Mind" star Russell Crowe's hotel
door in Los Angeles after the Oscar luncheon and showing him his academy
ballot, saying he would vote for Howard for best director. (Of course,
Miramax does not have a competitor in this category.)</TE>
<TE>   "In the midst of the campaign things tend to seem more intense, but it
does seem like the volume has been raised this year," said Matthew
Hiltzik, a spokesman for Miramax. "We have a great relationship with
Universal, and we share their disappointment at this nonsense taking away
from a great film like 'A Beautiful Mind.' "</TE>
<TE>   If anything, this year's campaign illustrates the enormous power the
Internet and tabloid journalism have amassed over the last five years,
observers say. And it is not exclusive to Hollywood's Oscar campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   "One would be hard pressed to say that winning the Academy Awards is
analogous to electing the person that will be the leader of the free
world, but in everything we find that the printed word has been
cheapened," said California Democratic political consultant Kam Kuwata.
"There was a time when people would distinguish between Walter Cronkite
and a National Enquirer. Those lines are being blurred, and that is a
very dangerous situation in anything."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, as Nasar stated in her Times article, when she spoke before a
group of students at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism,
they asked her about the Oscar campaign and the more titillating aspects
of Nash's life, not about his Nobel Prize or his groundbreaking math
theories.</TE>
<TE>Winning Can Mean Millions of Dollars</TE>
<TE>   Winning an Oscar--or an Oscar nomination--means millions of dollars
for a picture. The biggest gains come from what is called the ancillary
markets--DVD, home video and international sales. For example, "Moulin
Rouge's" DVD sales went up 160% the week of the nomination, and it has
taken in more than $2 million in the month and a half since its
release--nearly 30% above projections, Godsick said.</TE>
<TE>   Reforming the system will be difficult. For one thing, studio Oscar
advertising in Hollywood trade papers and consumer publications such as
the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times has skyrocketed in recent
years, with estimates of a 20% increase this year alone.</TE>
<TE>   Legally, the academy cannot put a cap on spending because it would
immediately be slapped with a restraint-of-trade lawsuit, said academy
Executive Director Bruce Davis. Ultimately, it is the studios that must
pull in the reins on one another, he said.</TE>
<TE>   This year's campaign has been a source of irritation for longtime
members of the academy, such as publicist Johnny Friedkin. His anger over
the amount of money spent on advertising and negative campaigning has
been building in recent years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very depressed," said Friedkin, a member of the academy for 30
years. "There is enough smog in the air without all the [nonsense] that
is being thrown out there. [But] I don't think it matters. I think it's
the picture and the performance that win in the end. Part of the game is
to get them to watch the cassette and then," he said, paraphrasing former
Clinton aide James Carville, ". . . It's the picture, stupid."</TE>

<HD>Chinese Premier Touts His Record</HD>
<DH>Politics: As the end of his term looms, Zhu Rongji credits himself
with shepherding the economy through Asia's crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji offered a spirited defense of his job
performance Friday, citing the country's continued economic
growth--especially through the Asian financial crisis--as his main
achievement in the last four years.</LD>
<LD>   Abandoning some of the self-deprecating modesty that has won him charm
points in the past, Zhu told reporters that he has delivered on nearly
all the promises he made in 1998, when he became China's No. 3 leader.</LD>
<LD>   Under his government, he said, China has kept its currency stable,
turned around its faltering state sector, begun reforming its banks,
streamlined its bureaucracy, overhauled its health-care system and met
its goals in several other areas--a glowing litany of success that made
many in his audience raise their eyebrows.</LD>
<TE>   Although he acknowledged that there is "room for improvement" and that
some tasks remain unfinished, Zhu said he has "a clear conscience."</TE>
<TE>   "On the whole," he declared on live national television, "I'm
satisfied with the progress."</TE>
<TE>   The pronouncement came during Zhu's annual news conference at the
close of China's parliament, a yearly media event that affords one of the
few opportunities here for unscripted exchanges between a high-ranking
Chinese leader and domestic and international journalists.</TE>
<TE>   The news conference was probably Zhu's last as premier because a
successor is slated to take over at this time next year.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the 70-minute question-and-answer session, Zhu's comments
often took on a valedictory tone, as if he were trying to set the seal on
his legacy as premier, even though he has a year left on the job.</TE>
<TE>   "This government has made good on its promise," he said. Zhu added
that he took special pride in having shepherded the Chinese economy
through the Asian financial crisis and kept economic growth on track. So
far this year, he said, the Chinese economy is up 7.6% compared with last
year.</TE>
<TE>   There has been speculation in recent months that Zhu, 73, might stay
on for a second term despite his previous assertions of being old and
ready to retire. At the news conference, however, he primly skirted
questions asking whether he would hold on to his post.</TE>
<TE>   "I have answered countless such questions in the past, and every time
I answer, my answer gives rise to unjustifiable speculation," Zhu said.
He told the audience to "be patient--the answer will be out fairly soon."</TE>
<TE>   Although his scheduled term is almost over, the remaining 12 months
could be crucial as Zhu guides his country through the first year of its
entry into the World Trade Organization. Membership in the WTO, which
will eliminate many of the protective barriers that shielded Chinese
businesses in the past, is expected to throw millions of urbanites and
farmers out of work. Protests by the economically disaffected in China
are already widespread.</TE>
<TE>   Zhu said that his "biggest headache," the issue that nags at him most,
is how to boost the income of China's 800 million farmers, who have not
shared equally in the nation's rising wealth.</TE>
<TE>   Although many residents of China's cities have prospered, farmers have
seen their incomes flatten or even drop. The gap between China's rich and
poor has widened to what some experts fear is a dangerous extent, and it
could worsen under WTO obligations.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no easy solution," Zhu said. "The fundamental way out is to
restructure China's agriculture because right now we're suffering from a
glut of grain and other agricultural products."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the government plans to cut rural taxes and tap into its
550-billion-pound grain reserve in order to ease the burden on farmers,
which Zhu called the "central task of this government."</TE>
<TE>   Zhu's image as a champion of the common person and his no-nonsense
manner have made him China's most popular national leader. Although in
reality troubles beset all the reforms he ticked off as underway or
completed--in the banking sector, for example, and in the realm of social
security--many Chinese regard Zhu as an honest politician amid a sea of
crooked officials out to fatten their own wallets.</TE>
<TE>   His annual news conferences, too, are eagerly anticipated by
journalists weary of constant rehashing of Communist-speak. In 1998, at
his first media appearance as premier, the Beijing press corps was wowed
by Zhu's from-the-hip style, especially in contrast to his predecessor,
Li Peng, widely regarded as a party parrot.</TE>
<TE>   Flashes of Zhu's trademark humor were in evidence Friday. When a
reporter asked what his biggest headache was, Zhu's first response was,
"To be honest, I suffer from headaches all day long."</TE>
<TE>   He also took issue with a description of him in a Hong Kong newspaper
as a short-tempered man who banged on tables and benches and tried to
stare down opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true I've banged on tables; it's true I've stared at people. If
you can't stare, aren't you just a vegetable? But I've absolutely never
banged on benches, because that would've really hurt," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And I don't think anybody would buy the story that I did this to
scare ordinary people. I've never intimidated ordinary citizens--just
greedy, corrupt officials, thank you."</TE>

<HD>Temple Supporters March in India</HD>
<DH>Religion: Police keep the peace and bar the Hindu procession in
Ayodhya from reaching the disputed site where a mosque once stood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AYODHYA, India
</DL>
<LD>The power of compromise and a heavy police crackdown prevented
religious violence here Friday when Hindu nationalists delivered two
carved stones for a temple they want to build on the site of a demolished
mosque.</LD>
<LD>   Indian police detained more than 18,000 people in at least three
states and cordoned off the northern town of Ayodhya to avert a new wave
of violence in a country still shaken by the deaths of more than 650
people in Hindu-Muslim riots in recent weeks.</LD>
<LD>   But Ashok Sanghal, international president of the hard-line Vishwa
Hindu Parishad group, insisted that there will be no backing down from
the ultimate goal of building a temple on the site, which the VHP claims
is the birthplace of Lord Rama, an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu.</LD>
<TE>   "We will get an opportunity to build the temple, I'm sure--very sure,"
Sanghal said as about 70 supporters of the Ram temple movement held a
short procession through Ayodhya.</TE>
<TE>   The VHP had planned to march at least 10,000 devotees through Ayodhya,
but 8,000 police and paramilitary forces closed off the town to all but a
few dozen hard-liners, who were stopped short of the disputed site where
the 16th century mosque was taken apart by a Hindu mob in December 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The group's elderly spiritual leader, Ramchandra Das Paramhans, had
said he would risk death to insist on Hindus' right to pray on undisputed
government land next to the site of the former mosque. But in the end, he
did what the government and police told him to do.</TE>
<TE>   Das' followers delivered two carved stones for their planned temple to
the holy man's residence here. Each sandstone piece was about a yard wide
and came from a workshop where masons continued to chip away at pillars
and other parts of the proposed Hindu temple Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The stones, called shilas, were then handed over to a representative
of Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee "for safekeeping," but only
after Sanghal stood atop a car for about half an hour to calm his angry
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no compromise," Sanghal said before the ceremony, stressing
his view that Vajpayee is an ally of the Ram temple movement, not an
enemy. "The shilas will be handed over to the central government, which
now looks after the entire temple. They'll keep them somewhere secure.
I'm very happy."</TE>
<TE>   The temple activists had wanted to go about another half a mile past
Das' residence to the site of the mosque. But India's Supreme Court
banned any religious ceremonies on a 67-acre site that includes the spot
where the mosque once stood.</TE>
<TE>   Das had threatened to defy the court order and hold a symbolic prayer
ceremony, or puja, at the site, but he agreed to a last-minute
compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Sanghal blamed the disappointing development on journalists, who had
turned out in such large numbers to cover the confrontation that they
almost outnumbered the Hindu devotees marching through town.</TE>
<TE>   "Journalists hinder puja!" Sanghal shouted to the angry crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "Uncle," a supporter cried out to Sanghal in respect, "when will the
Ram temple be built?"</TE>
<TE>   "Shut up," Sanghal scolded the man. "Who are you? Aren't you going to
listen to Ashok Sanghal?"</TE>
<TE>   By keeping its radical followers in line Friday, the VHP proved that
it can control potentially violent mobs when it chooses.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights activists, opposition politicians and Muslim leaders have
accused the organization of leading Hindu attacks in the recent unrest,
which began when a Muslim mob set fire to a train Feb. 27. The blaze
killed 58 people and sparked India's worst communal violence since
Ayodhya's mosque, the Babri Masjid, was demolished.</TE>
<TE>   In Ahmadabad, site of much of the violence, police said today that
they shot two Muslim men dead overnight in separate incidents when they
fired to disperse clashing Hindus and Muslims. They said a 20-year-old
Hindu was stabbed to death and his father wounded by unidentified
assailants.</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has close links to
the Ram temple movement, and although the prime minister has repeatedly
said he will let the courts decide the fate of the site of the razed
mosque, opposition parties accuse him of siding with Hindu hard-liners.</TE>
<TE>   As they prepared for their procession to Das' residence, some of the
holy man's followers chanted anti-Muslim slogans, such as one that
proclaimed India a place for Hindus and the Hindi language and taunted,
"Circumcised men should go to Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan, India's majority Muslim neighbor, is a favorite target of
Hindu nationalists, who have used the current threat of war with Pakistan
to mobilize support for their view that only Hinduism is a force for
unity and strength in India.</TE>
<TE>   They also cite the period during which Muslim Mughal emperors ruled
India as a time of humiliating, destructive assault on Hindu culture.
They say they are still working to reverse the damage by insisting on
Hindu dominance in a country where Muslims make up an estimated 140
million of the 1-billion population.</TE>
<TE>   "Thirty thousand [Hindu] temples were destroyed by the Muslims,"
Sanghal said, as about 15 guards from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, who
normally protect India's frontier with China, guarded him in Ayodhya with
AK-47 assault rifles.</TE>
<TE>   "And we have not destroyed even a single mosque in this country," he
insisted. "This is our history, a history of tolerance and nonviolence."</TE>
<TE>   "What about Babri in 1992?" a reporter asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Babri was not a masjid [mosque]," Sanghal snapped. "It was actually a
functioning [Hindu] temple by order of the court."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Diplomat Charged as Spy in Yugoslavia</HD>
<DH>Balkans: Envoy is held 15 hours before being released. Federation's
former army chief also is arrested and accused of espionage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VIENNA
</DL>
<LD>In an incident that U.S. diplomats described as "outrageous," an
American envoy in the rump Yugoslavia was summarily arrested and held
incommunicado for 15 hours by military police.</LD>
<LD>   The diplomat was detained Thursday by plainclothes officers along with
a former chief of staff of the Yugoslav army, Momcilo Perisic, according
to Paul Denig, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in the Yugoslav capital,
Belgrade. Perisic is now a deputy prime minister of Serbia.</LD>
<LD>   The two men and two others, both Yugoslav, who were detained with them
were charged with espionage. The allegation is that Perisic was passing
documents to the diplomat. The diplomat "was physically assaulted and
arbitrarily arrested," Denig said.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. government is "outraged by the unwarranted detention of a
U.S. diplomat," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomat was seized and "roughed up" at a restaurant just outside
Belgrade before being bundled off to a holding cell, Denig said.
Diplomatic sources said they were unaware whether he and Perisic had
exchanged any documents.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomat was released Friday, but the others remained in custody
early today.</TE>
<TE>   Yugoslav military court officials identified the diplomat as John
David Neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   The incident is a sharp reminder of how far what remains of the
Yugoslav Federation has to go before the rule of law and democratic
principles become the norm there. It appears to have resulted from
escalating tensions within the government in Belgrade, which is under
intense pressure to hand over evidence and extradite individuals
suspected of war crimes committed during the 1990s conflicts in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Kosovo, a province of the dominant Yugoslav
republic, Serbia. Washington has set a March 31 deadline for that
cooperation to be complete.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the U.S. will evaluate Belgrade's progress on several
fronts and decide whether to continue to supply millions of dollars in
foreign aid and endorse international monetary support for Serbia and
Montenegro, Serbia's last remaining partner in the federation. On Friday,
before news of the arrest was widespread, William Taylor, coordinator for
U.S. government assistance for Eastern Europe, had appeared on the
independent Belgrade radio station B-92 and said that Yugoslavia had not
yet done enough to meet U.S. demands.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, the effort to comply with the U.S. requirements has put
Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, who is pushing an array of
reforms, at odds with more nationalist Yugoslav President Vojislav
Kostunica, who controls the army.</TE>
<TE>   The military is one of the few institutions in Yugoslavia that still
functions at the federal level. It has also remained largely unreformed
since the era when strongman Slobodan Milosevic controlled the
government. A number of prominent army figures are fearful that they will
be extradited to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia in The Hague, where Milosevic is on trial, for their role in
the bloody Balkan wars.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest appears to have been a warning, largely directed at
Djindjic, of the risk he runs if he complies with the United States'
demands. However, it also puts a strain on the fragile relationship
between Belgrade and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Although that relationship has gradually improved since U.S. warplanes
led the 1999 North Atlantic Treaty Organization airstrikes that forced
Serbian forces out of the majority ethnic Albanian region of Kosovo and
led to the toppling of Milosevic, the rapprochement is in its early
stages.</TE>
<TE>   The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the diplomat's
arrest "could significantly influence the relations between our two
countries."</TE>
<TE>   Djindjic was quick to condemn the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a blow to the international credibility of the country," he
said, adding that it was his understanding that allegedly secret
documents being handed by Perisic to the diplomat had been planted.</TE>
<TE>   Kostunica, who returned from a European Union meeting in Barcelona,
Spain, late Friday, said he had been only "superficially informed" of the
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Officials met late into the night at the Serbian government's offices
to determine how to handle the incident, while the U.S. ambassador
expressed his dismay in no uncertain terms.</TE>
<TE>   "The embassy has delivered forceful protests about these actions to
the Yugoslav military and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs," Denig said.</TE>

<LD>U.S. military helicopters evacuated three Philippine soldiers
wounded in a clash with Muslim extremists, officials said today. It was
the closest American troops had come to the government's battle against
rebels.</LD>
<LD>   A Philippine military spokesman said two U.S. helicopters were
deployed to Basilan island late Friday after Abu Sayyaf guerrillas
ambushed a Philippine army patrol, killing one soldier and wounding
three. The fighting had apparently subsided by the time the helicopters
reached the site.</LD>
<LD>   About 660 U.S. soldiers are in the southern Philippines to train
troops to better fight the rebels.</LD>

<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>At least 10,000 Rwandan troops have launched an offensive in
eastern Congo in a major resumption of the country's 3 1/2-year war,
France's ambassador told the U.N. Security Council on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Jean-David Levitte said fighting in the region of Moliro, a
government-held town in Katanga province, was "particularly serious."</LD>
<LD>   "It seems that seven battalions of Rwandan troops--10,000 people at
least--are engaged in an offensive action," he said. "It is a serious
resumption of the war."</LD>
<TE>   Rwanda denied that any of its troops were engaged in combat, but a
Rwandan-backed rebel group confirmed the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Azarias Ruberwa, secretary-general of the Rwandan-backed rebel group
Congolese Rally for Democracy, known as the RCD, blamed the Congolese
army for the resumption.</TE>
<TE>   "We are acting in legitimate defense. . . . We are victims of attacks
by the government," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Karenzi Karake, the Rwandan army chief of operations, said all Rwandan
troops in the region were in Kalemie, 185 miles north of Moliro on Lake
Tanganyika.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, said they did not believe
that the Rwandan army was involved and that any fighting was likely to be
between the RCD and the Congolese army.</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council on Thursday demanded an end to all fighting in
Congo just as the Congolese government pulled out of talks on the future
of the Central African nation as a protest against recent attacks.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the council scheduled talks for Tuesday on the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Levitte demanded that the U.N. peacekeeping mission monitoring a 1999
cease-fire in Congo "shed light on what is now happening in Moliro."</TE>

<LD>A drifter was convicted of murder and arson for starting a blaze in
a backpackers hostel in Australia that killed 15 young travelers from
five nations.</LD>
<LD>   Friends and family of the victims wept and others yelled "Yes!" after
a jury in Brisbane delivered a guilty verdict against Robert Paul Long,
38, a homeless fruit picker.</LD>
<LD>   Long had pleaded innocent to murder and arson charges linked to the
June 23, 2000, blaze at the Palace hostel in Childers, a farming
community about 190 miles north of Brisbane, the Queensland state
capital. He faces a mandatory life sentence. Australia has no death
penalty.</LD>

<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ABOARD THE USS JOHN C. STENNIS
</DL>
<LD>With a blue pennant that bore the straightforward message
"September 11" flying overhead, Vice President Dick Cheney watched from
the flight deck Friday as this aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea
launched F/A-18 Hornets for duty over Afghanistan, 700 miles away.</LD>
<LD>   Then, in a speech looking ahead to the wider reach of the war on
terrorism, the vice president told several thousand sailors: "The United
States will not permit the forces of terror to gain the tools of
genocide."</LD>
<LD>   The vice president spent about four hours aboard the Stennis, joining
a parade of morale-boosting visitors who have included, said sailor
Bobbie Brown of Greenville, S.C., the chief of naval operations and the
actress Pamela Anderson.</LD>
<TE>   Cheney is on a high-stakes diplomatic mission intended to gain support
for a wider war against terrorism and, in particular, for the
administration's campaign to counter Iraq's efforts to develop weapons of
mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   On the Muslim Sabbath observed throughout the region, Cheney turned to
the Americans aboard the 6-year-old nuclear-powered carrier. The ship was
about 70 miles off the coast of Oman. It has been on station since
mid-December after leaving its home port, San Diego, a month earlier.</TE>
<TE>   On a carrier deck, the crews wear bright jerseys of red, green, yellow
and purple to designate their jobs as they conduct the ballet of man and
machine crucial to every launch and landing of aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Even the normally sartorially reserved Cheney added a touch of color:
He wore a bright pink button-down shirt, its sleeves a beacon under his
white life vest with "VP" stenciled on the back.</TE>
<TE>   As he crosses the Middle East, the vice president has been using
speeches to troops to send a public reminder to the region that the
United States won't relent in its war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, he was on the Sinai Peninsula, speaking at the
intersection of Gunslinger Alley and Bowie Boulevard to members of the
Arkansas National Guard on peacekeeping duty there.</TE>
<TE>   Declaring the mission of U.S. military personnel "vital and historic,"
Cheney has been telling the troops that the United States is fighting
"for the defense of the civilized world."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on the Stennis, from which the air wing delivered many of the
strikes on terrorist caves and camps in Afghanistan, Cheney listed the
countries now receiving U.S. assistance on the anti-terrorism campaign:
the Philippines, Georgia, Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   "Wherever threats are forming against the civilized world, we will
respond, and respond decisively," he said, in an unmistakable message to
the Middle Eastern countries on his itinerary.</TE>
<TE>   "Our next objective is to prevent terrorists, and regimes that sponsor
terror, from threatening America or our friends with weapons of mass
destruction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby on the massive hangar deck, members of Cheney's entourage used
a black felt-tip pen to scrawl angry messages to Al Qaeda on a missile
waiting to be loaded beneath an airplane.</TE>
<TE>   The trip is taking Cheney through a broad swath of the Middle East but
not Iraq, Iran, Syria and Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   The ship, which carries an American flag recovered from the wreckage
of the World Trade Center, barely slowed its tempo for Cheney's visit. As
he toured the Combat Direction Center, the darkened space lighted by the
glow of multiple computer screens shuddered each time a fighter jet was
launched--at times about every minute.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Jim McDonnell said that 7,000 sorties have been flown from the
vessel in support of the Afghanistan campaign and that 86 missions were
expected to be launched Friday--some of them for training and others over
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The flight to the war zone takes about 1 1/2 hours, and aircraft are
generally away from the ship for about five hours. They refuel over
Pakistan or Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   With the vice president standing less than 50 yards from the catapult
that flings the planes off the deck, operations appeared to go
flawlessly. But a week ago, a F-14 fighter jet was lost as it tried to
land. The crew was rescued.</TE>

<HD>Yemeni Man Targets U.S. Embassy in Grenade Attack</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANA, Yemen
</DL>
<LD>An unemployed Yemeni man tossed one or two sound grenades at the
U.S. Embassy in Sana on Friday, hitting a wall but injuring no one,
Yemeni and U.S. officials said. The attack came a day after Vice
President Dick Cheney visited Yemen.</LD>
<LD>   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said two grenades were thrown but caused no
injuries or damage. "They were noisemakers" rather than weapons, he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   Yemeni police, however, said only one grenade was thrown. They said
the man was reaching for a second grenade in his pocket when Yemeni
security guards outside the embassy opened fire and arrested him. It was
not immediately known whether he was wounded by the gunfire, they added,
speaking on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   The alleged attacker was a 25-year-old high school dropout named Samir
Yahya Awadh, according to Faris Sanabani, editor of the Yemen Observer
newspaper. Awadh was unemployed and had no known political affiliations,
Sanabani said.</TE>
<TE>   An Interior Ministry statement said his family had described him as
psychologically disturbed.</TE>
<TE>   Yemeni police and soldiers closed off streets around the embassy and
searched vehicles. Witnesses had reported seeing a car speeding from the
site after the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   The blast comes a day after Cheney visited Sana airport for two hours
of talks with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh on the war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney was notified about the embassy incident, which members of his
entourage in Oman on Friday characterized as an isolated incident, a U.S.
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Security in Yemen has been a top concern of the United States since a
boat laden with explosives slammed into the Navy destroyer Cole in
October 2000, killing 17 American sailors in an attack that the U.S.
links to Osama bin Laden. The destroyer was on a routine refueling stop
in Aden harbor.</TE>

<HD>Marines Close to the Front, Far From the Action</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: The 13th Expeditionary Unit, on refueling duty, has
seen little sign of the enemy despite its proximity to the war's
bloodiest battle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ZORMAT, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>As missions go in this war, pumping gas from a big helicopter to a
smaller one isn't among the more glamorous. But this is what Marines from
the 13th Expeditionary Unit are doing in the high desert, seven miles
west of the front line of the war's bloodiest battle.</LD>
<LD>   There is little sign of the enemy, though the Marines aren't so sure
about the ragged-looking Afghan locals with Kalashnikovs, just a few
hundred shimmery yards across the sand.</LD>
<LD>   "Go on out, take a knee and keep an eye out," advises Maj. Kevin Moss,
the 37-year-old pilot of one of the two CH-53E Super Stallions that
landed in this eastern village to refuel and rearm two Cobra gunships
combing a nearby ridge for Al Qaeda cavern hide-outs. "You never know
who's paying them," he says of the distant figures who, according to his
security briefing, are "friendlies."</LD>
<TE>   Out slog a squad of Marines, one with the name Goat on his helmet, to
dig holes in the sand. Cpl. Joseph Giannini, a 21-year-old from
Bakersfield, eyes a fortification at the edge of the village that looks
like a washed-out sand castle. It isn't exactly what he wants to do in
this war, but it's better than scraping and painting a ship off the coast
of Pakistan, as some members of his unit are doing.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a couple of little scares," Giannini said, when asked for
the obligatory war story. "We landed in an LZ [landing zone] the other
day and we saw a bunch of people coming over the mountaintop, forming
groups. We saw them from 1,000 yards away. All we saw was things shining
on them. I didn't know if it was weapons or not, but I don't want to take
a chance on anyone. They tell us they're friendly one day, and the next
day they're shooting."</TE>
<TE>   With its wheels half-buried in the sand, the Super Stallion is a fat
target, a cross between a shipping container and a science-fiction
locust. It weighs 37,500 pounds empty but is carrying a refueling tank
with 4,000 pounds of jet fuel in addition to the 9,000 pounds of fuel in
the helicopter's own tanks, according to Moss.</TE>
<TE>   Bristling with rockets and cannons, the wasp-like Cobras carve showy
turns overhead before landing in a sand-blasting whirl. Crew Chief Jason
Palmer, 44, of Spokane, Wash., hauls a hose to the tank and fills it in
about as much time as it takes to fuel a large SUV. It's the NASCAR pit
stop of aviation. Then the Cobra sweeps off, hugging the terrain, out and
up to a series of snowy ridges stamped on the horizon like they were
minted on a coin.</TE>
<TE>   Moss (call sign: Algae) and his 29-year-old co-pilot, Capt. Brian
Fanning (call sign: Chimpy), came in from Bagram air base, about 100
miles north, flying low enough to flutter laundry and scatter sheep. "In
this flat terrain, you're not going to hear or see us until we're a mile
away," Moss said. "In the worst case, a guy picks up a SAM
[surface-to-air missile], but the time he's got left to react is too
short."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing like that happens much, though there has been some small-arms
fire from villages. "We're not really allowed to do anything about that,"
Palmer says. "You can't go in and wax a whole city."</TE>
<TE>   During a flight, though, one of the two door gunners fires off a few
rounds into the sand for the benefit of a CNN film crew on board. The
sound of the gun is like a chain caught in a metal propeller.</TE>
<TE>   Hours of withering sunshine and sandblast showers go by. Two men
leading two mules, a man walking with a camel and a caravan of reporters
go by, along with three sets of Afghan government soldiers in beaten-up
SUVs heading to the front. Fanning, of Pacific Beach, Calif., shaves in
the reflection of the cockpit window. He and pilot Bill Collier (call
sign: Slick) whip out their Beachcomber Bar T-shirts and pose for a
photograph, the war front a backdrop. Back home, they'll tack it on the
wall of that Pacific Beach watering hole: Welcome to Beachcomber Bar,
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The day's only test of combat readiness comes when an Afghan soldier
starts across the sand toward the helicopters. Moss cradles his M-16. The
man sees this and holds out an empty water bottle. They get him a fresh 1
1/2-liter bottle and throw in an MRE--Meals Ready to Eat--packet for good
measure. He strolls back to his comrades.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a week before, Moss and other members of the 13th Marine
Expeditionary Unit, based in Camp Pendleton, were aboard the amphibious
ship Bonhomme Richard in the Arabian Sea. Most of the unit's members are
still aboard, a sore point among Marines who are eager to get into what
has amounted to the most concentrated ground action since the war began
in October.</TE>
<TE>   Short on fighting, they grouse over food. MREs have gotten fancy.
There's Thai chicken and teriyaki beef. Vegetarian fare usually has the
best candy, for no reason known to these men.</TE>
<TE>   You learn to get creative with the ingredients: Take the lemon-lime
beverage powder, add some crushed up crackers, sugar, coffee creamer and
water, and you have something like a lemon-merengue pie, Palmer says.
Cocoa powder, two instant coffee packets and a nondairy creamer get you a
field mocha, another adds. Skip the coffee and add some water, and that's
GI pudding.</TE>
<TE>   They say there is a way to use the water-activated heat packets inside
the MREs to make bombs that go off like hand grenades. They don't
recommend it in a war zone.</TE>
<TE>   By late afternoon, the men have refueled the two Cobras more than half
a dozen times each, and gone aloft to top off their own tanks from a
KC-130 refueling plane.</TE>
<TE>   When the mission's over, the crew and the men who set up the perimeter
get back in the Super Stallions and the aircraft lift off, dipping,
ducking and banking over a broken country. Nothing happened to the
Marines, and that's something. When they get to Bagram air base, they'll
stroll across the runway. They'll be sunburned and dirty. They'll have
been to the war zone.</TE>

<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>The West piled pressure on Africa on Friday to condemn the
reelection of President Robert Mugabe and join international isolation of
the Zimbabwean leader.</LD>
<LD>   European Union officials said leaders of the economic bloc, attending
a summit in Barcelona, Spain, would issue a tough statement today on the
election, roundly condemned as fraudulent by Zimbabwe's opposition party,
the U.S., Europe and white Commonwealth members.</LD>
<LD>   Mugabe's defeated challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, has denounced last
weekend's vote as "daylight robbery," saying tens of thousands of his
supporters were stopped from voting or cowed by violence in which more
than 100 people died.</LD>
<TE>   In a move likely to provoke further Western condemnation, Mugabe on
Friday enacted a media law criticized as aimed at muzzling freedom of
speech.</TE>
<TE>   But reaction among African nations to Zimbabwe's vote has so far been
largely positive.</TE>

<HD>Karzai Appeals to Expatriates in Berlin to Return Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>Afghan leader Hamid Karzai said Friday that he hoped to stay in
power beyond his initial six-month term, and he implored expatriates to
return home and help rebuild Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The prime minister said he and his Cabinet were working to restore
Afghans' confidence in government and to establish international
credibility. But the process will take time, he said, and his appointment
by the upcoming tribal assembly, or loya jirga, would provide necessary
stability.</LD>
<LD>   "Now we are responsible, we are in charge and we have to serve the
people . . . [and] we should try and be the government even after the
loya jirga," Karzai said.</LD>
<TE>   Karzai was named interim leader after a U.S.-led coalition drove the
Taliban rulers from power in Afghanistan. His term began in December and
lasts until June, when the assembly convened by the 87-year-old exiled
king, Mohammad Zaher Shah, selects a government to rule Afghanistan for
18 months, until elections.</TE>
<TE>   One expatriate, 34-year-old Akbar Mazari, said Karzai was his
country's best chance.</TE>
<TE>   "He has great contacts--America, Germany, France, Russia, Great
Britain. It is like a company--it is important to have people with
contacts," said Mazari, who fled Kabul after the 1979 Soviet invasion and
is an insurance salesman in Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's minister of women's affairs, Sima Samar, who was with
Karzai on the three-day visit to Berlin, which ended Friday, said she
would try to ensure that the assembly includes at least 25% women.</TE>
<TE>   Echoing his message to Afghan expatriates living in Moscow, where he
stopped before Germany, Karzai said he needed educated citizens to return
home to help make the country self-sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Germany has one of the largest Afghan communities outside Asia and the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   "We have resources--fertile land and many other resources we can use
to make the country wealthy," Karzai said. "We don't want Afghanistan to
be a long-term receiver of funds only; we want to be able to help other
countries too."</TE>
<TE>   He said his top priorities were establishing a national army and
police force, bringing electricity and water to all citizens, building
roads and establishing banks.</TE>

<HD>Pearl Case Indictment Won't Aid Extradition, Pakistan Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. indictment of the key suspect in the kidnapping of slain
Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl will not hasten his extradition
to the United States, Pakistani officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   A U.S. court indicted Muslim extremist Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh on
Thursday out of concern that Pakistani authorities might release him. But
Pakistan says it reserves the right to prosecute Saeed before considering
whether to give the United States a chance to try him.</LD>
<LD>   "Investigations are going on," Foreign Ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed
Khan said. "Once the investigations are completed, it would be decided
whether he has to be tried here or to be extradited."</LD>
<TE>   Pakistan does not have an extradition treaty with the U.S., although
officials of the governments are considering ways Sheikh might be handed
over. The issue is unlikely to cause friction between the countries
because Pakistan is an ally in the U.S.-led war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   A federal grand jury in Trenton, N.J., indicted Sheikh on charges of
conspiring to take Pearl hostage and then kidnapping him. Because the
Jan. 23 abduction resulted in the reporter's death, Sheikh could face the
death penalty if he is brought to the United States and convicted.</TE>
<TE>   The charges were filed in New Jersey because Sheikh is accused of
sending e-mails to Pearl that were relayed through the Journal's computer
network there, officials said.</TE>

<HD>FAA Rescinds More Relaxed List of Carry-Ons</HD>
<DH>Safety: OKd last month were baseball bats, syringes and other items
banned after Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<AU>JACK NELSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In a move they now say was a mistake, federal aviation security
officials issued confidential instructions last month permitting
passengers to carry baseball bats and other items that could be wielded
as weapons aboard jetliners.</LD>
<LD>   The instructions to security screeners--effective when the government
assumed control of airport checkpoints on Feb. 17--expanded the list of
"permitted items" to include baseball and cricket bats, hockey sticks,
ski poles, pool cues and golf clubs.</LD>
<LD>   A copy of the revised list of carry-on items was made available to The
Times by a security source who disagreed with the new policy. Baseball
bats and many of the other items were forbidden when security was
tightened immediately after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   After inquiries by The Times on Friday, Transportation Department
officials said the new policy was a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "The Transportation Security Administration is rescinding the security
directive in question and substituting a new one with a more restricted
list of what is permitted beyond security and thus in passenger cabins of
airliners," the agency said in a written statement issued late Friday. It
asked travelers to check with their airline if they have any questions.</TE>
<TE>   The episode is likely to add to the confusion among travelers--and
airport security screeners--about what can and can't be taken aboard an
aircraft. Independent security experts said it also represents
questionable judgment by officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would anybody need a baseball bat on an airplane?" asked Billie
H. Vincent, a former head of security for the Federal Aviation
Administration. "It's an extraordinarily bad idea. Sure, you don't want
[a bat] to get banged up. But you can put it in a box or wrap it up."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to take back the rule means "someone looked at this and
finally woke up," said Vincent, now an aviation consultant.</TE>
<TE>   The new carry-on list had not been widely publicized but was spelled
out in instructions issued to airport screeners.</TE>
<TE>   Publicly, the FAA Web site continues to advise travelers that baseball
and softball bats, ski poles, hockey sticks and golf clubs are not to be
brought into the passenger cabin.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA Web site says that any "athletic equipment that could be used
as a weapon" must be packed in checked baggage, which is stowed in the
cargo hold. Officials say passengers should follow a simple rule with
regard to carry-on items: "If in doubt, leave it out."</TE>
<TE>   Several Transportation Department officials said that the new carry-on
list was the subject of internal discussions before it went to the 429
airports now under federal jurisdiction. One official recalled a
discussion about holding an event to publicize the relaxed rules. But
others said they became concerned when they saw baseball bats on the
list.</TE>
<TE>   The guidance to screeners also contained a list of 55 "prohibited
items," which includes billy clubs. Vincent said a baseball bat can be
used in much the same way as a billy club. "You don't have to swing it.
You can poke someone in the gut."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the prohibited items--such as automatic weapons, bows and
arrows, and dynamite--appeared on the list for obvious reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Others probably would not be considered dangerous by most people.
Included in this category are children's transformer robots; some can be
turned into toy guns. Bullwhips and power drills were also listed as
prohibited.</TE>
<TE>   The list of permitted articles contained 25 items, including
toothpicks and medical syringes with a doctor's note. Other allowed items
were harder to fathom, including "restraining devices."</TE>

<HD>Tipper Gore Huddles to Mull Senate Run</HD>
<DH>Politics: Democrats, including Sen. Clinton, encourage the wife of
the former vice president to seek the Tennessee seat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Cutting short a trip to California, Tipper Gore was scheduled to
huddle with friends and family this weekend to discuss whether to run for
the U.S. Senate from Tennessee, according to several sources who have
spoken with her.</LD>
<LD>   "Clearly, there are enough people making a convincing argument that
she doesn't want to dismiss it out of hand," a Gore family intimate said
Friday. "She wants the weekend. She knows she's got to move quickly."</LD>
<LD>   Leading Democratic strategists still think it most likely that Gore,
53, will not join the race for the Senate seat her husband, former Vice
President Al Gore, once held. But several said that, after his decision
not to run again for it, she appeared to be seriously examining the
possibility.</LD>
<TE>   And that prospect drew a notably enthusiastic response from several
party leaders, including Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), the former
first lady whose political path Tipper Gore would be following.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton actively encouraged Gore to seek the seat Sen. Fred Thompson
(R-Tenn.) is vacating, saying the possibility of her candidacy was
generating "a lot of excitement" among Democratic senators.</TE>
<TE>   "If she decides to run," Clinton said on CNN on Friday, "I am going to
be her most enthusiastic supporter."</TE>
<TE>   Added a top party operative: "It would be fair to say that, such as it
is, the Democratic establishment thinks it is an interesting proposition.
. . . She is very intelligent, very attractive and [would make] a very
exciting candidate. She can raise an awful lot of money in a very short
time, which is important in this race."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the nationwide publicity her candidacy would generate, it
would potentially add Tennessee to the relatively small list of tightly
contested Senate races that will determine which party controls the
chamber after the November election.</TE>
<TE>   Former Gov. Lamar Alexander, a two-time contender for the Republican
presidential nomination, is the front-runner for the Republican nod. Also
in the field is Rep. Ed Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   On the Democratic side, Rep. Bob Clement has scheduled a news
conference Monday in Nashville, where he was expected to announce his
candidacy. The other three Democratic House members from the state have
effectively ceded the field to Clement, announcing they would not run if
he did.</TE>
<TE>   Gore intimates said she had been urged to consider the race by
Tennessee supporters who believe the party needs a stronger nominee to
beat Alexander.</TE>
<TE>   One top Democratic operative familiar with the discussions said the
general expectation is that if Gore enters the race, Clement will
withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   A Gore candidacy also could have ramifications for her husband's
future. Democratic political analysts said that if she wins, it might
improve Al Gore's prospects if he runs for president again by
demonstrating renewed strength in the home state he lost in 2000. Had he
carried Tennessee, he would have claimed the White House.</TE>
<TE>   But these Democrats also cautioned that if Tipper Gore loses the
Senate race, it might deepen the belief among his critics that Al Gore
was fatally damaged in his 2000 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   One reason a Tipper Gore candidacy would cause surprise is that she
never appeared to enjoy the public limelight as her husband ran for
office.</TE>
<TE>   Although warmer than her husband in public, she never seemed
enthusiastic about interaction with, or scrutiny from, the press.</TE>
<TE>   "She doesn't mind talking to the press when it comes to specific
issues that she cares about," said one advisor. "But when it comes to her
private life, or anything other than these key issues she is focused on,
she does tend to shy away."</TE>
<TE>   Before Al Gore won the vice presidency as Bill Clinton's running mate,
Tipper Gore was best known for her work as the founder of the Parents
Music Resource Center, which lobbied for the establishment of a parental
advisory rating system on rock albums.</TE>
<TE>   During the Clinton administration, Tipper Gore was most visible for
her work on behalf of the mentally ill. She revealed that she had
undergone treatment for depression after her son, Albert III, was
seriously injured in a car accident in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   If she wins a Senate seat, Gore will not only be serving with Hillary
Clinton but potentially with Elizabeth Hanford Dole, the wife of former
GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole. Elizabeth Dole is running for the U.S.
Senate in North Carolina.</TE>

<HD>Yates Draws Life Sentence</HD>
<DH>Crime: Jurors quickly decided fate of Houston woman who killed her
five children. She has a chance of parole--at 77.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>A slumped, blank-faced Andrea Pia Yates was sentenced to life in
prison Friday after a jury agreed in half an hour to spare the life of
the mentally ill housewife, who drowned her five children in the bathtub.</LD>
<LD>   The panel of four men and eight women had deliberated just 35 minutes
when the jury buzzer rang. Yates' family came running, the audience
rustled in their seats and Judge Belinda Hill rushed in the side door and
raced to the bench so fast nobody had time to stand. "Verdict, verdict,
verdict, verdict," Yates' husband, Russell "Rusty" Yates, chanted to
himself, twitching his legs and twining his fingers.</LD>
<LD>   As Hill read Yates her fate, the convicted woman turned to her
attorneys and asked what the legal language meant. Defense lawyer Wendell
Odom spoke into her ear, and Yates nodded. A few minutes later, she
shuffled from the courtroom, giving a sidelong glance toward her mother,
brothers and sister.</LD>
<TE>   Yates, 37, a former nurse who struggled with mental illness for years,
had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Earlier this week, the jury
rejected her insanity claim after just a few hours of deliberation and
found her guilty on two counts of capital murder. The panel had to decide
between life in prison and death by injection. But the jury decided Yates
doesn't pose a future threat to society. She will be 77 before she is
eligible for parole.</TE>
<TE>   Yates was tried in Harris County, in a court system that accounts for
roughly one-third of the convicts awaiting execution on the state's death
row. But in a radically uncharacteristic move from the Houston district
attorney's office, prosecutors passed up the chance to present evidence
in the punishment phase and stopped short of asking for a death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing I can do will restore their lives; the death penalty can't
restore them," prosecutor Joseph Owmby told the jury in his closing
statement. "If you want to sentence her to life rather than a death
sentence, you will have done the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Owmby said he wanted the jury to pick a punishment. "I
didn't think the facts in this case warranted me recommending the death
penalty."</TE>
<TE>   The other prosecutor, Kaylynn Williford, avoided asking for death
outright but insinuated in her closing argument that she considered
execution an acceptable punishment. "Those children never had a chance,"
Williford said. "You need to think about the pain those children endured,
and the terror and fear. . . . Mrs. Yates had the benefit of friends and
family and the health system, and she turned her back on that."</TE>
<TE>   Williford meant to push for execution without asking for it directly,
she later explained. "Everyone talks about making this a women's issue, a
political issue. But the issue to me is five dead children."</TE>
<TE>   It's been nearly nine months since Yates poured dry cereal for the
children, then summoned them to the bathroom and killed them one by one.
Noah, 7, John, 5, Paul, 3, Luke, 2, and 6-month-old Mary were buried
together on the outskirts of town after a funeral in a church they'd
never attended. Each of them would have celebrated another birthday since
then. Williford mounted their portraits on a sheet of poster board and
asked the jury to take it with them into their deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   The dead children themselves have been eclipsed these past weeks by
their mother's trial. Aside from murmurs of "yes," "no" and "not guilty,"
Yates' voice is seldom heard. Nevertheless, the gaunt woman in baggy
dresses and schoolmarm spectacles became an unlikely lightning rod for
women's rights groups, mental health advocates and justice system
critics.</TE>
<TE>   Her case spurred public debate about methods of prosecuting the
mentally ill and the dangers of postpartum depression. This week, a human
rights group filed a complaint with the state of Texas. Yates was
over-medicated, prematurely discharged from the hospital and given
inappropriate drugs, the Citizens' Commission on Human Rights-Texas
charged.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a difficult defeat for us, but it raised certain issues in
the mind of the public," defense lawyer Odom said. "If we did that, it
wasn't in vain."</TE>
<TE>   Standing outside the courthouse, defense lawyer George Parnham read
aloud from a note penned by Yates from jail. Without apologizing, Yates
says she regrets any pain she caused her family and that mental illness
"brought me to a place" that allowed her to kill the children.</TE>
<TE>   The note continues with a brief eulogy for each child: Inquisitive
Noah, John's "cute grin." "Precious Paul," "beautiful Luke" and
Mary--"such a loving baby with big blue eyes."</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God I was blessed with such a precious family," the letter
concludes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Rusty Yates took the lectern at an impromptu sidewalk news
conference. Ever since he had stepped dry-eyed from his brick house the
morning of June 21 and told reporters Andrea Yates wasn't in her right
mind when she'd drowned the children the day before, he has made a very
public point of standing behind his wife.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, he decried the mental health system that "miserably failed
us," the judge who denied his constitutional right to talk to reporters
and the prosecutors who put his wife on trial. He railed against Texas
law. He criticized his wife, who he says never told him she was thinking
of hurting the children. He bemoaned the news reports that "vilified" his
family. He pointed out, wistfully, that he and his wife won't be able to
have any more children, "and that's something that's important to us."</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been worse if she got the death penalty--but it
wouldn't have been a lot worse," he said as a warm rain began to fall.
Asked whether he bears any responsibility in his children's deaths, Yates
hesitated, then said, "I don't think that's a fair question.</TE>
<TE>   "As a man, it's my responsibility to protect my family from outside
the house. A family can't protect itself from a psychotic person. What
can you do?</TE>
<TE>   "If it hadn't been drowning them, it would have been smothering them
at night or poisoning them at breakfast."</TE>
<TE>   Yates said he didn't know whether he would divorce his jailed spouse.
"It'll be difficult being separated, not having the companionship."</TE>
<TE>   During the monthlong trial, Yates and his family sat on one side of
the courtroom and Andrea Yates' mother, siblings and friends sat on the
other side. The two groups didn't glance at each other, nor did they
speak to one another in the courthouse corridors.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Yates has been on medication since her arrest and slowly is
coming back to herself, her psychiatrists say.</TE>
<TE>   "She'll live the rest of her life knowing what she's done," Parnham
told the jury Friday. "If it's punishment you want, there can be no
greater punishment."</TE>

<HD>Ridge's Refusal to Testify Irks Lawmakers</HD>
<DH>Politics: Congress wants updates on homeland security. The White
House has asserted executive 'prerogative.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As the director of homeland security for President Bush, Tom Ridge
oversees one of government's fastest-growing sectors at a time of intense
interest in bolstering public safety. Not surprisingly, Congress has been
clamoring to quiz him.</LD>
<LD>   But unlike other top government officials who appear regularly on
Capitol Hill to update lawmakers about their activities, Ridge has turned
down repeated requests to testify--a decision that has sparked increasing
anger among congressional Democrats and some Republicans.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the dispute led to a heated exchange between the White
House and Congress. Bush asserted executive "prerogative," an argument
that had echoes of Vice President Dick Cheney's refusal to provide
lawmakers information about the private consultations he conducted in
devising the administration's energy policy last year.</LD>
<TE>   That standoff has resulted in a lawsuit filed by Congress'
investigative office. And the flap over Ridge is the latest example of
what some see as a White House that prefers to play it close to the vest
in providing Congress information on matters ranging from pressing policy
issues to contingency plans for a "shadow government" in case Washington
is attacked.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say White House aides such as Ridge who are not subject to
Senate confirmation traditionally have been shielded from requests to
testify. National security advisor Condoleezza Rice and chief economic
advisor Lawrence B. Lindsey, for example, do not appear at formal
hearings on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush's position may have as much to do with practical politics as
legal principles.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping Ridge off the Capitol Hill stage, the analysts say, Bush is
seeking to maintain tight control over the still-developing homeland
security campaign. He is also, in a larger sense, attempting to set
limits on congressional oversight of his administration.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole notion is, 'Hey, I'm in charge. I have my advisors, I'll
make my decisions and we'll move on,' " said Thomas E. Mann, a
presidential and congressional scholar at the nonpartisan Brookings
Institution.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers insist they have a right to know more about what has become
a federal priority. Bush has asked for $37.7 billion for homeland
security in the coming year, nearly double the current budget of $19.5
billion.</TE>
<TE>   In rebuffing congressional requests for Ridge to defend the proposal
before Congress, Bush risks alienating powerful lawmakers from both
parties who have their own ideas about a domestic issue that potentially
touches every community in America.</TE>
<TE>   If Bush prevails, it would be a victory in his effort to bend a
divided Congress to his will. But Mann, like other analysts, questioned
whether the strategy is "tenable politically."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Sens. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) and Ted Stevens (R-Alaska),
leaders of the Senate Appropriations Committee, sent Bush a letter urging
him to reconsider his position.</TE>
<TE>   Other lawmakers have chimed in.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not minor," said Rep. Ernest J. Istook Jr. (R-Okla.). Istook,
the chairman of the House panel that oversees funding for the White
House, is usually a strong Bush backer, but homeland security policy
"involves billions of taxpayer dollars. More importantly, it involves
millions of lives."</TE>
<TE>   Istook aired his complaint in a hearing Thursday in which another
White House official, budget director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., was being
grilled on the Bush spending plan for the coming fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Ridge, Daniels holds a job subject to Senate confirmation.
Senior officials in that category, both Cabinet and sub-Cabinet officers,
testify before congressional committees all the time.</TE>
<TE>   So do many hundreds, even thousands, of other people in any given
Congress. Many are private citizens. Some work for the executive branch
in positions that are not subject to Senate confirmation. First Lady
Laura Bush briefed the House Education and Workforce Committee on
Thursday about teaching issues (though her public appearance was not
described as a formal hearing). A House Appropriations subcommittee also
heard that day from Phil Larsen, a special assistant to the president for
management and administration, whose appointment was not
Senate-confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Often, the testimony is simply a media spectacle orchestrated by
lawmakers. But in recent decades it also has become an increasingly
integral part of the government operations. Congress has become ever more
assertive in questioning administration officials about how federal
dollars are spent.</TE>
<TE>   At the news conference he held Wednesday, Bush sought to explain his
position on why Ridge had not been sent to Capitol Hill hearings. "That's
part of the prerogative of the executive branch of government, and we
hold that very dear," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials note that congressional leaders have
been briefed privately by Ridge--and the president himself--on domestic
security issues.</TE>
<TE>   "He's consulting with Congress, like other members of the president's
staff," said Ridge's spokesman, Gordon Johndroe.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge, 56, a former Pennsylvania governor and House member, was named
to the newly created White House post five months ago. A central player
in the federal response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he is
coordinating a massive campaign to shore up the nation's defenses against
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the sky-high approval ratings Bush has received for his
leadership of the war on terrorism, the public may not quarrel with his
position on the testimony issue. But that doesn't mean it is risk-free.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of potential political costs to something like this,"
said Joel D. Aberbach, a UCLA political scientist. "I would assume that
many Republicans [and] Democrats are probably uncomfortable seeing the
role of Congress trivialized."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats, in particular, are lashing out at the no-testimony
policy. Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) this week suggested that
Congress could pass a resolution seeking Ridge to testify, or even haul
him up to Capitol Hill with a subpoena. Those are unlikely scenarios, but
they show the depth of congressional resentment.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Sens. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) and Bob Graham
(D-Fla.)--the top members of the Senate Select Intelligence
Committee--said they believe Ridge should accede to the requests.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), another who has sought Ridge's
testimony, noted that Ridge in recent months had taken public questions
from reporters and mayors--"virtually everybody except Congress. I think
it's rather strange. He's going to be in charge of a very significant
effort that costs a great deal of money."</TE>

<HD>FAA Orders Inspections of Airbus A300s</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The government said Friday it would order inspections of Airbus
A300-600 aircraft that experience side-to-side movements similar to those
of American Airlines Flight 587, which went down Nov. 12 in New York. All
260 people on board and five on the ground died.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Aviation Administration directive also would affect Airbus
A310s, which have similar nonmetallic composite tails. In some cases,
airplanes would be grounded until the inspections were made.</LD>
<LD>   FAA spokesman Les Dorr said the directive won't take effect until
early April, but airlines would voluntarily do inspections in the
interim.</LD>
<TE>   The FAA announcement is its second since the National Transportation
Safety Board said Monday that it found previously undetected damage to
the tail of an American Airlines Airbus that swayed while trying to land
in May 1997 at West Palm Beach in Florida. Two people were injured in
that incident.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the week, the FAA said it would order ultrasound
inspections of tail assemblies of Airbus planes that either hit
turbulence or had sharp rudder movements. The airlines voluntarily agreed
to the inspections, Dorr said.</TE>
<TE>   American Airlines said two Airbus A300-600s experienced strong
side-to-side movements. An ultrasound check of one plane found no
problems, and results on the second craft are expected next week, the
airline said.</TE>
<TE>   One Federal Express plane and three foreign jets also had similar
stresses, Airbus spokeswoman Mary Anne Greczyn said. She said all the
tails are being removed and inspected using ultrasound.</TE>

<LD>President Bush rallied U.S. troops here Friday and then viewed a
deafening, action-packed tactical demonstration by Special Forces at
nearby Ft. Bragg, home to units deployed in Afghanistan and elsewhere in
Central Asia.</LD>
<LD>   Bush used his visit--the latest of several he has made to military
bases since the war on terrorism began--to urge support for his defense
spending request. The House faces a key vote next week on the federal
budget, which includes Bush's proposal for the largest hike in money for
the Pentagon in two decades.</LD>
<LD>   The presidential visit also came just a week after a Ft. Bragg soldier
and an airman from adjacent Pope Air Force Base were killed in action in
Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   Bush met privately with the widows of Army Chief Warrant Officer
Stanley L. Harriman and Air Force Tech. Sgt. John A. Chapman, and then
reported that the women had told him: "Don't falter."</TE>
<TE>   The president added:</TE>
<TE>   "These people just lost a loved one, and they're just as resolved
about winning this war on terror as I am. And I was very impressed by
their steadfast support for what we're doing and their understanding of
the sacrifices necessary to defend freedom."</TE>
<TE>   At Ft. Bragg, Bush watched a simulated hostage rescue by Special
Forces. The training exercise took place on a movie-like set in a
fictional developing nation, dubbed "Pineland."</TE>
<TE>   The scenario included several dozen soldiers posing as a mob of
anti-American street demonstrators. Upon Bush's arrival in a third-story
observation deck, they began chanting: "U.S.A. go home!" Some shook their
fists at the commander in chief. Bush responded with a chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   The simulation also included attack helicopters depositing troops onto
rooftops and the ground to rescue imaginary hostages in a cinder-block
building dubbed a U.S. Embassy.</TE>
<TE>   Although the soldiers fired blanks in their assault rifles, they
detonated real stun grenades after they knocked down a door and burst
into the building, moving quickly from room to room and floor to floor.</TE>
<TE>   The president also saw several participants "shot dead" and placed in
the muddy street, as well as a separate demonstration of an airplane
refueling two copters.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the exercise, which lasted more than an hour, Bush wore ear
and eye protectors and watched from behind a thick, plastic pane on a
rooftop.</TE>
<TE>   "That was exciting," he said afterward. "I think we're well trained.
I'm glad they're on my side."</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving, Bush ate a lasagna lunch with military personnel at
Ft. Bragg--the country's largest Army post, with about 42,000 soldiers,
and home of the 82nd Airborne Division and the Special Operations
command.</TE>
<TE>   In earlier remarks to an estimated 4,000 soldiers, their families and
local residents at the Cumberland County Coliseum, Bush called on
Congress to adopt the defense budget "as the first order of business--so
we can plan for this war."</TE>
<TE>   Bush has proposed increasing defense spending by $48 billion, to $379
billion. The House will vote next week on the annual budget resolution,
which sets overall spending and revenue targets for various categories of
federal activities, such as defense. Bush's request for the Pentagon
should pass in the GOP-controlled House but could run into problems in
the Democrat-controlled Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The president received a thunderous welcome from the flag-waving crowd
jammed into the local arena, and he was quick to return the admiration,
calling the gathered troops "the world's finest fighting soldiers."</TE>
<TE>   The audience erupted in cheers and applause as Bush noted that his
proposed defense budget contains a new round of pay raises for the
military.</TE>
<TE>   "The price of freedom is high. But it's never too high as far as I'm
concerned," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He reiterated his commitment to pursue the war on terrorism as it
enters what he has called its second stage.</TE>
<TE>   Bush described the new phase as "a sustained campaign, a tireless,
relentless campaign, to deny sanctuary, to deny safe haven to terrorists
who would threaten citizens anywhere in the world, threaten our way of
life, threaten our friends, threaten our allies."</TE>
<TE>   Repeatedly interrupted by ovations, Bush vowed: "We will not slow down
until the threat of global terrorism has been destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   The president also stressed anew his determination to take the
military campaign to nations beyond Afghanistan that pose a potential
threat with weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "I have made it clear that we will not let the most dangerous regimes
in the world team up with killers and, therefore, hold this great nation
hostage.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever it takes to defend the liberty of America, this
administration will do."</TE>

<HD>AIDS Vaccine Likely Still a Decade Off, Doctor Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Important unanswered questions remain in the development of a
broadly effective AIDS vaccine, which could be a decade or more away, a
top AIDS researcher said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "Do I think in five years we are going to have a vaccine that is going
to prevent AIDS? Probably not," Dr. Anthony Fauci told the President's
Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS.</LD>
<LD>   He said clinical trials are underway on a vaccine that seems to have
at least a partial effect, and "some global health good could come of
that."</LD>
<TE>   In countries with high rates of AIDS infection, a vaccine of even
modest effectiveness can have an effect, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, researchers said at an AIDS conference that a new vaccine
is showing promise in early testing among humans, but they cautioned they
are still years away from proving that it works.</TE>
<TE>   The approach, called prime-boost, is highly effective in monkeys and
early results indicate the same could be true in people.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still a lot of important unanswered questions," Fauci said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts believe a vaccine is the only way to stop the worldwide AIDS
epidemic, which has killed 20 million people and infected 40 million
more.</TE>
<TE>   Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, outlined his agency's AIDS
research for the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he thought an eventual AIDS vaccine would be a onetime
injection or would need annual repeats like the flu vaccine, he indicated
that periodic boosters probably will be needed.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Hank McKinnell, head of the drug company Pfizer Inc.,
announced his company is freezing the price of Viracept, a widely used
AIDS treatment.</TE>
<TE>   He said Pfizer will not raise the price of Viracept for two years.
Pfizer's wholesale price for the drug is $2.02 per tablet; the dosage is
one tablet twice a day.</TE>

<HD>Interceptor Rocket on Target in Test</HD>
<DH>Defense: The most complex of its kind so far, it was the sixth
trial of a prototype of a ground-based missile system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>An interceptor rocket smashed into a dummy warhead Friday night 140
miles above the Pacific Ocean in the fourth successful test of its kind,
a Pentagon spokeswoman said.</LD>
<LD>   The interceptor, launched from a tiny Pacific island near the equator,
destroyed the dummy warhead at 6:41 p.m. PST, spokeswoman Cheryl Irwin
said.</LD>
<LD>   The test was the sixth of a prototype of a ground-based missile
defense system. The interceptor successfully "killed" the dummy warhead
in three of the previous five tests, including the most recent one in
December. The military also is developing ship-based and other types of
antimissile systems.</LD>
<TE>   The military launched the target missile from Vandenberg Air Force
Base in California at 6:11 p.m., Irwin said. The interceptor took off
4,800 miles away from Meck Island in Kwajalein Atoll at 6:32 p.m. and
collided with the dummy warhead in space nine minutes later, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's test was the most complex of its kind so far, although it was
still a developmental test, not an operational one. The dummy missile
jettisoned three balloons to try to fool the interceptor. The most recent
test included only one decoy balloon.</TE>
<TE>   The interceptor used its own sensors to pick out the warhead, track it
and move in to collide with and destroy it, a Pentagon statement said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is pressing ahead with development of the
antimissile systems, saying the United States needs a defense if a rogue
country such as North Korea develops and fires long-range missiles at
U.S. shores.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush announced last year that he was pulling the United
States out of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which bans such
missile defenses. Russia and some other countries have criticized the
move.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic missile-defense critics say the program is too costly and too
easily defeated with simple countermeasures or by firing a larger number
of missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Designing, testing and building a system of land- and sea-based
missile defenses would cost between $23 billion and $64 billion by 2015,
the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say long-range missiles are much less of a threat to the
United States than terrorist attacks using chemical, biological or
nuclear weapons built in or smuggled into the country.</TE>
<TE>   "This is kind of a sideshow that doesn't have any basis in real
threats," said Chris Madison of the Center for Arms Control and
Non-Proliferation.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz told Congress last month
that the Pentagon hopes to have four prototype antimissile rockets
stationed in Alaska in two years.</TE>
<TE>   The full set of tests won't be finished until 2006 or 2007. The
Pentagon hopes to test the ground-based system every three months until
it's ready, agency spokesman Lt. Col. Rick Lehner said.</TE>

<HD>Boston's Official Catholic Newspaper Questions Celibacy Policy for
Priests</HD>
<DH>Dogma: Prelate says it's not meant as challenge to church. Experts
say it reflects public outrage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston, staggering under the
weight of a national sex scandal, published a stunning editorial in its
official newspaper Friday that questioned whether priests should remain
celibate.</LD>
<LD>   Late Friday, Boston's archbishop, Cardinal Bernard Law, issued a
statement contending the editorial was not intended to question the
church's position on celibacy. Law, the senior cardinal in the United
States and the paper's publisher, said the editorial was merely a
reflection of issues raised by others.</LD>
<LD>   Experts, however, said the fact that a major archdiocese would delve
into one of the church's most fundamental laws reflects how deeply the
church's U.S. hierarchy has been touched by public outrage. In past
weeks, dioceses in numerous states have been accused of or admitted
knowingly employing priests with a history of molesting minors.</LD>
<TE>   The editorial in the Boston Archdiocese's newspaper, the Pilot, also
raised the question of whether the priesthood attracts too many gay men.
And it promised to explore next week the question of ordaining women--a
topic that Pope John Paul has forbidden to be discussed within the
church.</TE>
<TE>   "These scandals have raised serious questions in the minds of the
laity that simply will not disappear," wrote Msgr. Peter V. Conley, the
paper's executive editor, in the editorial.</TE>
<TE>   "They're asking questions the pope doesn't want to discuss," said
Arthur Jones, editor-at-large for the National Catholic Reporter, an
independent weekly newspaper with a liberal reputation, who applauded the
editorial.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to Cardinal Law's statement, Father Christopher Coyne, a
diocesan spokesman, said, "The editorial simply restates the questions
that have been raised by the laity in the listening sessions and says in
light of all this we should respond with appropriate answers."</TE>
<TE>   The editorial offered no solutions and only raised the provocative
questions: "Should celibacy continue to be a normative condition for the
diocesan priesthood? . . . Does priesthood, in fact, attract a
disproportionate number of men with a homosexual orientation? . . .
Lastly, why are a substantial number of Catholics not convinced that an
all-male priesthood was intended by Christ and is unchangeable?"</TE>
<TE>   The church allowed married priests prior to the 11th century.</TE>
<TE>   In Boston, recent allegations that defrocked priest John J. Geoghan
molested 130 children while being moved from parish to parish sparked
national outrage. Since January, the Boston Archdiocese has given
prosecutors the names of close to 90 priests suspected of child abuse
over 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of priests in a total of 11 states also have been accused this
year of sexual misconduct with children. In Southern California, as many
as a dozen priests have been ordered to retire or resign.</TE>
<TE>   Jones speculated that the purpose of the Boston Archdiocese's editor
is to "get the conversation past this priest [Geoghan] and on to the
issues."</TE>
<TE>   The debate over whether priests should be allowed to marry or whether
women can serve as priests has continued within the Roman Catholic Church
since the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the mid-1960s. But the
editorial in a diocesan newspaper took both liberals and conservatives
within the church by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Soto, the auxiliary Bishop of Orange, warned that inserting
celibacy into the molestation debate was inappropriate because there is
no linkage between celibacy and pedophilia.</TE>
<TE>   "Celibacy has always been challenged, more now than probably ever,"
Soto said. "But to insert [that debate] into the current scandal is
inaccurate and could lead to inaccurate speculation about what lies at
the heart of this crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Soto defended the doctrine of celibacy in a written statement last
year, saying the priesthood "is a demanding discipline that requires
prayer and sacrifice from those who assume it. This long-standing
tradition with the church is very countercultural for a society that
knows no limits or boundaries."</TE>
<TE>Vatican Says Pope's Position Hasn't Changed</TE>
<TE>   In Rome, a Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Ciro Benedettini, said: "The
pope has spoken to this. He has said celibacy remains, it is a great gift
to the church. He has spoken clearly in favor of celibacy."</TE>
<TE>   The 100,000 copies of the diocesan paper will be distributed to Boston
parishioners over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   In a related development, the nation's Catholic bishops announced they
would tackle the problem of pedophilia at their June 13-15 meeting in
Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   The bishops have asked their Ad Hoc Committee on Sexual Abuse to
present recommendations and guidelines to help the church "address this
problem more effectively," the bishops' administrative committee said in
a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Any recommendations, however, would probably be voluntary because the
bishops conference does not have the power to make national policy for
the 194 U.S. dioceses.</TE>

<HD>Detainees Advised to Eat Meals</HD>
<DH>Protests: Guantanamo captives told that disobeying rules won't
speed their release.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba
</DL>
<LD>A U.S. general told captives Friday he could do nothing to speed
their release as he toured the facility and officials said they'd given
"The Arabian Nights" and other books to the detainees.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking from a security tower above Camp X-ray, Marine Brig. Gen.
Michael Lehnert told the 300 detainees their fate is in the hands of the
U.S. government and urged them to eat. Some of the men have refused meals
to protest their indefinite detention.</LD>
<LD>   "Nothing you or I can do will either delay or speed action of those
who will determine your future," Lehnert told the men, some of whom have
been at the outpost since January. The speech by Lehnert, the commander
of the detention mission, was in English but was translated into several
languages.</LD>
<TE>   Although a hunger strike that began two weeks ago fizzled this week
with the last of three men accepting food, 12 inmates refused lunch
Thursday and 13 declined dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "Some still believe they can solve their problems through
disobedience," Lehnert said. "Refusing food is not the answer. You only
punish yourself. You do not hurt me. You do not hurt the guards."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, military officials said they had distributed books
including "The Arabian Nights: Tales from a Thousand and One Nights," a
collection of occasionally lurid Persian, Arabian and Indian folk tales
handed down through several centuries. In Arab countries, editions are
often censored to remove sex scenes.</TE>
<TE>   "We distributed story books in Arabic [including] . . . 'Arabian
Nights,' " said Lt. Abuhena M. Saiful-Islam, a Muslim chaplain. "We are
trying to get some more religious books."</TE>
<TE>   This week, 38 sets of eyeglasses were handed out. Previously, only
copies of the Koran had been given out.</TE>

<HD>Oregon Family of 6 Found Dead</HD>
<DH>Crime: Authorities say a landscaper apparently shot his wife and
children before killing himself weeks ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>McMINNVILLE, Ore.--A father apparently shot his four children and
wife to death in their bedrooms, then used the rifle to kill himself,
authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The shootings are believed to have occurred nearly three weeks before
sheriff's deputies found the bodies Thursday night, said Yamhill County
prosecutor Bradley C. Berry.</LD>
<LD>   The motive was unknown, but evidence indicated Robert Bryant, 37,
killed his family, Berry said.</LD>
<TE>   The children, ages 9 to 15, were last at school Feb. 22, and
investigators believe the shootings occurred the following day.</TE>
<TE>   School authorities made several attempts to contact the family after
teachers noticed the children's absence, said Karen Richey, assistant
superintendent for the McMinnville School District.</TE>
<TE>   "We had people knocking on the door several times," but no one
answered, she said. School officials weren't alarmed because it is common
for students to be absent during flu season, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Two sheriff's deputies were in the vicinity Thursday night on an
unrelated call when neighbors approached them to express concern about
the family. The deputies used a ladder to look into a window and spotted
the bodies.</TE>

<HD>White House Releases Wildfire Funds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The White House has agreed to release $280 million in wildfire
money that had been approved by Congress last year, after several weeks
of intense lobbying by Democratic and Republican lawmakers.</LD>
<LD>   The Forest Service money is intended as an emergency fund--but $200
million of that will be spent to repay accounts that the Forest Service
tapped to cover the costs of firefighting, forest rehabilitation and
community aid.</LD>
<LD>   The remaining $80 million has been promised for the Forest Service by
the Office of Management and Budget, but with a restriction that it can't
be spent until July 1, the start of the final quarter in the fiscal year.</LD>
<TE>   That money is to be used to thin national forests of the dense
underbrush that is considered a source of fuel for wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   Without the $280 million, which had been appropriated by Congress in a
budget signed last year by President Bush, the Forest Service would have
been forced to cut some critical programs, lawmakers said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time that the administration and OMB recognized the will
of Congress," said Sen. Conrad R. Burns (R-Mont.), ranking minority
member on the Interior Appropriations subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   "We are approaching our fourth year of drought, and we must do
whatever possible to be proactive in preventing fires," Burns said.</TE>
<TE>   Burns was among a handful of lawmakers who wrote to the White House,
demanding that the wildfire money held back from this year's budget be
released to the Forest Service immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Burns' letter, which was sent to the president on Wednesday, noted
that without the money, the Forest Service would have problems replacing
aging trucks and aircraft, and repairing roads vital to reaching Western
fires.</TE>

<HD>Survivors of EgyptAir Crash Victims Skeptical, Angry</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>When EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed in 1999, Gail Seidman's mother,
Tobey, was one of those who died.</LD>
<LD>   Seidman was highly skeptical Friday on learning that a federal report
on the crash is expected to say that the disaster was caused deliberately
by a co-pilot.</LD>
<LD>   "My knee-jerk reaction is still that it was terrorism," said Seidman,
48, a structural engineer who lives in Vallejo, Calif. "9/11 only
solidified it for me. But the government will never admit it. They won't
go there."</LD>
<TE>   Seidman's mother, who lived in Irvine, was one of 10 Orange County
residents killed in the crash. Seidman and others who lost loved ones
said knowing the reason for the crash, in which 217 people died, would
not ease their pain.</TE>
<TE>   Eryn Bowman, who lost her mother-in-law, Judith, said she feels
outrage that an EgyptAir supervisor reprimanded co-pilot Gamil El Batouty
hours before the New York-to-Cairo flight.</TE>
<TE>   "That to me was extremely maddening," said Bowman, of Huntington
Beach. "To so tactlessly inform him just hours before he was in the air
that it would be his last transatlantic flight--who in their right mind
would do that?</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing would increase or decrease the anger that we felt or still
feel," Bowman said. "Whether this was revenge or suicide, we don't care.
What angers us is the irresponsibility of EgyptAir."</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported Friday that the National Transportation Safety
Board's conclusions, expected to be released in a few days, probably will
say that the jumbo jet was brought down by the methodical, determined
acts of a veteran co-pilot.</TE>
<TE>   The latest revelations were no surprise to Arthur Wolk, a
Philadelphia-based attorney who sued EgyptAir on behalf of the families
of five Orange County victims. Two of the surviving families have
settled; the others are pursuing legal action against the airline.</TE>
<TE>   The theory that the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane on Oct.
31, 1999, off the coast of New England has been explored in the
litigation involving the Orange County plaintiffs, Wolk said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it was to avenge what he perceived as unfair treatment by his
airline superiors or whether it was to cause the death of the Americans
or Egyptian soldiers on board, one may never know," Wolk said. But
clearly, he said, the co-pilot caused the crash.</TE>
<TE>   "The flight data recorder shows he was in the cockpit by himself,"
Wolk said. "If he wasn't promoted to captain, you've got to wonder why he
was left at the controls alone. When the captain returned to the cockpit
and began trying to pull the plane out of the dive, the co-pilot shut the
engines off and worked against the pilot. There is no way this could have
been an accident."</TE>
<TE>   Seidman said she believes that Batouty, working for terrorists,
crashed the plane to prevent a group of American-trained Egyptian
military officers from returning home.</TE>
<TE>   "We need Egypt right now because of the volatile politics" in the
Middle East, she said. "The U.S. will put its best foot forward to keep
them on our side instead of getting to the truth."</TE>
<TE>   In her lawsuit against EgyptAir, Seidman said she has rejected
settlements that are "way, way, way less" than the $2.7 million the
Federal Aviation Administration has calculated as the monetary value of a
life lost in a plane crash. She said she only recently began coping with
her loss.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been life-altering. My whole way of life was ripped out from
underneath me," she said. Dealing with her pain has made her more
empathetic and tolerant, more aware of others' pain, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "9/11 brought me to my knees. It brought me to the fetal position."</TE>
<TE>   Bowman said her family hopes the release of the final NTSB report will
bring some closure.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to keep having these reports come out," Bowman said.
"There's always something we have to read. . . . We can't get on until
all this ends. We're not free to have our memories because something is
continually being thrown in our face."</TE>

<DL>MARANA, Ariz.
</DL>
<LD>An airplane used by the Army's Golden Knights skydiving team went
down Friday after colliding with a civilian aircraft after a training
jump at a rural airport, a military spokeswoman said.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Warrant Officer Lowell K. Timmons, the military pilot, was
killed, the Army said. No hometown or age was available for Timmons.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Col. Marian Hansen said the four Golden Knights parachutists
aboard had jumped from the UV20 Porter turboprop plane before the
collision. The plane landed in a crumpled heap in a dry riverbed a mile
north of the Marana Airport.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a terrible tragedy whenever we lose one of our soldiers," Hansen
said.</TE>
<TE>   The civilian plane, a Cessna, landed safely, said Keith Holloway, a
spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, which was
investigating the crash along with the military.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Knights are based at Ft. Bragg, N.C., but the competition
team involved in Friday's crash had been practicing at the Marana
airport, about 20 miles north of Tucson, said Douglas Smith, a spokesman
for the Army Recruiting Command.</TE>
<TE>   He said the team trains in Arizona during the winter.</TE>

<HD>Winter Returns to Northern Plains</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS
</DL>
<LD>One of the biggest snowstorms to hit the northern Plains this
winter dumped more than a foot of snow on parts of South Dakota and
Minnesota, stranding travelers and closing hundreds of schools.</LD>
<LD>   Freezing rain knocked out power to homes across northern Iowa,
southern Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin, and hundreds of traffic
accidents were reported, including two deaths when a taxi slid into a
tractor-trailer near Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   In western Wisconsin, authorities were searching for a single-engine
plane that disappeared early Friday. The pilot, believed to be the only
person on board, reported icing just before air traffic controllers lost
contact with the plane.</LD>
<TE>   About 200 travelers spent the night on cots at Minneapolis-St. Paul
International Airport after about 300 flights were canceled Thursday.
Children in nearly 350 school districts in southern Minnesota and western
Wisconsin got the day off after classes were canceled.</TE>
<TE>   "We're catching up for lost time this winter," said Bob Weisman, a
meteorologist at Minnesota's St. Cloud State University, where 14 inches
of snow fell and there were still flurries Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Snow was still falling Friday in parts of Wisconsin, but the skies
were expected to clear by evening.</TE>
<TE>   To the west, the storm left as much as 2 feet of slushy snow in
Wyoming, a welcome sight to ranchers and farmers who have seen an
abnormally dry winter.</TE>
<TE>   In South Dakota, many cattle are having their young, and the harsh
weather will affect calving, said Julie Williams, a veterinarian at
Mid-River Veterinary Clinic in Chamberlain, S.D.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota had been basking in relatively balmy weather for most of the
winter. Snowmobile and ice-fishing contests had been postponed or delayed
across the state, and ice sculptures quickly melted at the St. Paul
Winter Carnival in late January.</TE>
<TE>   The storm was a reminder of what a Northern winter usually looks like.</TE>

<LD>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had a growth removed from his
neck Friday, the Pentagon announced.</LD>
<LD>   Scans and examination of the growth--called a lipoma--indicated it was
benign, a Pentagon statement said, adding that the tissue was sent for
tests to confirm that.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. John Casler removed the growth from Rumsfeld's neck in a 90-minute
operation, and Rumsfeld returned to his office afterward, the statement
said.</LD>
<TE>   The lipoma was discovered March 9 during Rumsfeld's annual physical
examination at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.</TE>
