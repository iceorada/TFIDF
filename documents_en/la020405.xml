<HD>Promising 'Crush' Takes a Bad Turn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John McKay's "Crush" begins as a captivating romantic comedy and
then, at the very moment it's most involving, takes a wholly
gratuitous and disastrous swerve and just keeps on going from bad to
worse. Left in the lurch are three skillful actresses--Andie
MacDowell, Imelda Staunton and Anna Chancellor--as a trio of
fortysomething single women in England who gather nearly every
weekend to commiserate with each other over their lucklessness in
love and sex.</LD>
<LD>   They live in a storybook Gloucestershire village right out of a
Thomas Kinkade painting. MacDowell's Kate is the American
headmistress of a clearly posh and ancient school. Chancellor's
Molly, a brittle and elegant three-time divorcee, is a gynecologist.
And Staunton's Janine is a pert police inspector who is either
divorced or widowed, with a teenage son.</LD>
<LD>   Never married, Kate is giving up hope when, during a funeral, her
eyes lock with those of Jed (Kenny Doughty, a notable newcomer), a
handsome 25-year-old organist. She doesn't recognize him as the
former student she last saw when he was 14, but he knows her
instantly. Almost as instantly they're off in the bushes together.
Kate tells herself she has experienced a one-time-only thrill, but
she has actually plunged headlong into a reckless romance.</LD>
<TE>   When they learn what's going on, Molly and Janine fear for their
friend's welfare, which is not unreasonable. But Molly is so
upset--read downright jealous--about what she regards as an
unsuitable relationship that she is determined to break up the
romance. Janine knows Molly is ready to go too far but is putty in
the hands of her arrogant, strong-willed friend. They behave in a
manner that is entirely despicable, yet the picture proceeds all the
way to an ever more contrived finish without Molly learning the full
measure of her so-called friends' perfidy--and without any
acknowledgement or comment on this state of ignorance.</TE>
<TE>   What a shame McKay went for melodrama instead of continuing with
an amusing yet also realistic account of how a somewhat older woman
and a younger man cope with the age difference--which would be
inconsequential were the man the older member of the couple. What a
shame too that MacDowell has never been more radiantly beautiful and
is as beguiling as the film is repellent. "Crush" is a lot nastier
business than it is prepared to admit.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for sexuality and language. Times guidelines:
adult themes and a lot of frank sexual talk.</TE>

<HD>'Teddy Bears': A Bit Too Cuddly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the Oscar telecast, Nathan Lane delivered a crack about the
Weinstein brothers of Miramax and then mock-apologized. "The rich and
powerful," he said. "We make fun of them because we love them." Maybe
it's true, because there's a whole lotta love in "Teddy Bears'
Picnic."</LD>
<LD>   Allegedly based on a real-life retreat where people like Dick
Cheney go to relax amid nature while spending the rest of the year
trying to destroy it, "Teddy Bears' Picnic" (no real relation to the
song) does for industrialists, politicians, pro-football owners and
lawyers what Christopher Guest's "Best in Show' did for dog
owners--but without the skewer. Which is odd, because a place like
Zambesi Glen--the name given Harry Shearer's summer camp for
not-so-wayward, very rich boys--is a sitting duck for really vicious
humor. What we get instead is "Caddyshack" crossed with the Royal
Order of Raccoons.</LD>
<LD>   The first mistake of "the Glen," where "fellowship" is used as a
verb and the rich and infantile get to abandon "the dreary burdens of
power and privilege," is letting women in.</LD>
<TE>   During a special one-time-only luncheon that more or less
discombobulates the staff, wives and mistresses are permitted to tour
the grounds to see the various "lodges" devoted to the members'
various fields of endeavor and then are kindly asked to get out.
("Women after dark ... it's just not right," shudders the chef,
played by Shearer). It's also the beginning of the crisis that
befalls Zambesi, because lawyer Whit Summers (John Michael Higgins)
has brought his wife, Katy Woo (Ming-Na), a reporter for Channel 6
news. And when Polaroids leak out of the Glen exposing their various
arcane rituals--dancing in drag, irrigating redwoods, consulting the
sacred pelican--the world gets clued in to what's going on inside.</TE>
<TE>   The cast is a real all-star team of little-seen talent--Kenneth
Mars is hilarious as NFL team owner Gene Molinari, whose abuse of his
son Dom (Bob Einstein, a.k.a. Super Dave Osborne) carries the kind of
edge the whole movie should have had. Howard Hesseman, as the
commercial director brought in to save the annual "follies," is
another performer you'd like to see more of, as is Robert Mandan
("Soap"), whose Stanton Vandermint is the consummate insider. But
instead, Shearer (whose various comedic achievements include the
"Simpsons" voice of Ned Flanders) tilts at power with a feather
duster instead of an ax, and nobody's the least bit bloodied when the
whole thing's over.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: Unrated.</TE>

<HD>Rossdale and Co.: A Few Golden Moments</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gavin Rossdale knows what to do on stage. At the Universal
Amphitheater on Wednesday, the Bush frontman slashed eagerly at his
guitar, hopped and kicked at all the right moments and pointed to his
audience while yelling, "Los Angeles!" a lot. The man even writes the
occasional catchy rock single, enough for an equal handful of epic
rock moments.</LD>
<LD>   Those moments didn't come nearly often enough during Bush's
100-minute concert, supporting the band's newest album, "Golden
State." At its best, when all the studied elements came together,
Bush was truly worthwhile, but the long periods between hits
frequently fell flat.</LD>
<LD>   Most often derided in its heyday as a grunge rip-off, Bush is
actually more of a chameleon, as likely to write a song aping the
Cure as Nirvana. That's worked for the British quartet whenever the
band's chaotic hard-rock and pop hooks coalesced into radio-ready
singles, which happened frequently enough to make Bush among the most
successful bands of the '90s.</LD>
<TE>   When Rossdale stepped out during the encore to begin the slow,
dramatic strumming that opens the hit "Glycerine," accompanied only
by somber waves of organ, it made for a perfectly paced, satisfying
rock star moment. And yet those peaks were balanced by surprising
missteps, such as Rossdale's performance of the new ballad
"Inflatable," which somehow degenerated into off-key moaning.</TE>
<TE>   More satisfying was a wound-up version of the Cars' "Just What I
Needed," which brought the show to an energetic peak. As always, a
catchy song was Bush's best defense.</TE>

<HD>A French Relic Has 5 Strings Attached</HD>
<DH>Music* Bare-shouldered women who loved violin music were in
a quandary until they dreamed up a variation on the theme.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATTHEW BARAKAT</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Va.</DL>
<LD>In the world of musical instruments, the pardessus de viole--a short,
stumpy stringed instrument--is a refugee.</LD>
<LD>   Its history is closely linked to the fickle musical and cultural
tastes of 18th century France. Italian violin music was all the rage
then, but aristocratic French women who wanted to play it had a
problem: Fashion required that they bare their shoulders, and it was
a faux pas for a lady to rest anything on a bare shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   Thus the popularity of the pardessus. Similar to a violin, it is
played on the lap instead of under the chin. The pardessus also has
five strings, rather than the violin's four.</LD>
<TE>   Its brief period of popularity 250 years ago captured the
attention of Tina Chancey, one of perhaps four or five people in the
United States who play the pardessus professionally.</TE>
<TE>   Chancey said hardly any of her friends who are professional
musicians have even heard of the pardessus (pronounced PART-eh-soo).</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most obscure of the obscure instruments," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Chancey, who wrote her doctoral dissertation on the instrument,
said she was drawn to it initially because of its history as an
innovation driven by women who wanted to embrace a new style of
music.</TE>
<TE>   She quickly came to appreciate the pardessus for its musical
qualities, however. She described its sound as a close mimic of the
human voice.</TE>
<TE>   "It was invented for such a silly reason," said Chancey. "But it
just turned out to be such a poetic, expressive instrument."</TE>
<TE>   The Arlington resident received two grants in the late 1980s from
the National Endowment for the Arts to support her work on the
pardessus. In 1990, she played it in her first solo recital at
Carnegie Hall.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, she and Catharina Meints, a cellist with the Cleveland
Orchestra, recorded six sonatas written for two pardessus by
Barthelemy de Caix, an 18th century French composer.</TE>
<TE>   A few thousand copies of the CD have been sold, said Linda
Feldmann, a spokeswoman for its distributor, Dorian Recordings of
Troy, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   She said many music lovers are looking for recordings featuring
historical instruments.</TE>
<TE>   "Something like Barthelemy de Caix is not going to go platinum,"
she said. "But there are people out there who have heard enough
Vivaldi. They've heard enough Corelli. They're open to exploration."</TE>
<TE>   Chancey estimated that about 300 pardessus survive from the 18th
century. She owns one of them, made in 1745, and uses it for
recordings and performances instead of a modern one she had built.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing like an old one," she said. "It just really
sounds great."</TE>

<HD>'Celebrity Boxing' Courts Buttafuoco, Bobbitt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joey Buttafuoco and John Wayne Bobbitt could be the next marquee
matchup as Fox seeks more scandalous or once-famous names to
participate in "Celebrity Boxing," with the next special tentatively
planned for the May rating sweeps.</LD>
<LD>   Sources say Buttafuoco, a central figure in the so-called "Long
Island Lolita" case, and Bobbitt--who gained public notoriety after
his penis was severed by his wife, then reattached--constitute one of
three matches on the drawing board.</LD>
<LD>   Fox declined comment Thursday, but network sources said no
contracts have been finalized and that the timing of the special is
contingent on lining up three appealing bouts.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, the two other matches may be slightly less
tabloid-esque in nature, with more legitimate celebrities and
athletes being approached.</TE>
<TE>   The first "Celebrity Boxing," televised in mid-March, generated
vast media attention and strong ratings. The program averaged about
15.5 million viewers, winning its time slot and gradually gaining
audience during the hour.</TE>
<TE>   The main event for that telecast was to have featured Buttafuoco's
onetime paramour, Amy Fisher, who was forced to withdraw at the last
moment because of parole concerns. She was replaced by Paula Jones,
who faced off against Tonya Harding.</TE>
<TE>   Fox is hoping to turn "Celebrity Boxing" into an ongoing franchise
of occasional specials, after drawing mediocre to poor ratings with a
series of titillating concepts.</TE>
<TE>   That roster included the network's sequel to the dating show
"Temptation Island" and the unorthodox quiz show "The Chamber," which
subjected contestants to elemental forces, including intense heat,
cold and wind.</TE>
<TE>   The previous "Boxing" special also pitted former child stars Danny
Bonaduce ("The Partridge Family") and Barry Williams ("The Brady
Bunch") against each other, and rapper Vanilla Ice (a.k.a. Robert Van
Winkle) versus "Diff'rent Strokes" star Todd Bridges.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Quietly authoritative, unprepossessing, pointedly stylish in his
approach to different composers, Max Pommer made an impressive debut
as guest conductor with the Pacific Symphony on Wednesday at the
Orange County Performing Arts Center.</LD>
<LD>   The German musician, a native of Leipzig, offered a familiar but
unhackneyed program that satisfied through its variety. Its mellow
conclusion was Haydn's "Surprise" Symphony, given a bright,
thoroughly detailed and fluent reading by the game players of the
orchestra, who seemed to be enjoying this experience as much as the
listeners.</LD>
<LD>   Pommer provided a well-guided tour of the work's colorful musical
scenario. Tempos flowed naturally, unstraitjacketed; orchestral
balances maintained equilibrium--string and winds complementing each
other effortlessly. The Menuetto had an elegant bumptiousness. And,
at the "surprise" chord in the Andante, Pommer shared a
conspiratorial smile with the audience. Charming.</LD>
<TE>   Handsome playing characterized the entire performance. At the
beginning, there was Handel's "Royal Fireworks" music in all its
bright display, crisp stylishness and perfectly balanced
instrumentalism. After intermission, Pommer led a lush and gorgeous
revival of Elgar's sentiment-drenched Serenade for Strings.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, then, the one sagging place in this program was in
what is perhaps Mozart's most beloved of piano concertos, No. 23 in
A, wherein Angela Hewitt was the pedestrian soloist.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian pianist makes all the right musical gestures without
the expected musical results. She is good, competent, efficient, but
she is uninspired. This vehicle suffered from flat tires and traveled
nowhere.</TE>

<HD>Good-Natured Charms Spice 'American Chai'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anurag Mehta's "American Chai" is the latest serious comedy to
explore the cultural gap between immigrant Indian parents and their
American-born offspring. Taking its title from a spiced milky Indian
tea, it is a perceptive, good-natured movie starring the
writer-director's brother Aalok, a gifted musician with a winning
personality. Second-generation Americans of any ethnic background are
likely to recognize something of their own experiences in varying
degrees in those of Aalok Mehta's Sureel.</LD>
<LD>   Sureel is nearing graduation from a university not so far from his
parents' handsome split-level home in an upscale northern New Jersey
neighborhood, clearly a bedroom community for Manhattan and an
enclave for Indian emigres. From a very early age, Sureel learned how
to circumvent the dictates of his bossy, ultraconservative father
(Paresh Rawal). In the father's view, Sureel and his younger brother
are Indians, not Americans, and are to be raised as if they were
growing up in India.</LD>
<LD>   So skilled is Sureel in the art of dissembling that he has managed
to deceive his father into believing he is majoring in premed instead
of music. As far as his father is concerned, music is fine as a hobby
but an impractical professional goal. Nevertheless, Sureel follows
his dream with a rap group whose members are everything but African
American.</LD>
<TE>   Still, a moment of truth looms for Sureel, who has to resist an
arranged marriage. The strain of pursuing one goal while pretending
to pursue another is beginning to tell on him and his relationships
when he crosses paths with Maya (Sheetal Sheth), an beautiful dancer
whose fusion of traditional Indian and modern dance inspires him to
pursue a similar course in music. Maya's parents have similarly
insisted that she regard dance as a sideline, but she so impresses
Sureel that he gives her the confidence to apply for a prestigious
two-year scholarship in London. Naturally, attraction between Sureel
and Maya grows, but they proceed slowly in the direction of romance;
this is one aspect of their cultural conditioning they are willing to
respect.</TE>
<TE>   Sureel comes to believe that his father will respect his goals if
he demonstrates some success as a musician, and as he begins to
experiment in fusing Indian and American music as Maya has in her
dance, he also becomes convinced that while Indian Americans are well
represented in the classic professions, they need to be much more
involved in the arts.</TE>
<TE>   Mehta and Sheth are surrounded by solid presences, including Josh
Ackerman as Sureel's best friend and fellow musician and Reena Shah
as his fiancee. Aasif Mandvi is their husky, crudely comical pal who
fancies himself an expert on women. "American Chai" pulls together
nicely at its ending, but not before Sureel's father has a chance to
see himself in his son.</TE>

<HD>Translating a Masterpiece</HD>
<DH>Charlotte Rampling's performance fleshes out a Chekhov
classic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When you're reading Chekhov, author-illustrator Edward Gorey once
said, you wonder why you read anyone else. Michael Cacoyannis' new
film of the great Russian writer's final masterpiece, "The Cherry
Orchard," illustrates what Gorey was talking about.</LD>
<LD>   Something of a one-man band (writer, director, producer,
co-editor), Cacoyannis is best known for the 1963 film "Zorba the
Greek" as well as his passionate restagings of the Euripides trio of
"Electra," "Iphigenia" and "The Trojan Women." He wrote the "Cherry
Orchard" script from his own English-language translation, and though
it is overly broad at times, leading to the inevitable overplaying by
some of the minor characters, these are small defects compared with
the production's virtues.</LD>
<LD>   Heading that list is an exquisite performance by Charlotte
Rampling, whose work as Lyubov Andreyevna Ranevskaya, the matriarch
of the great estate the cherry orchard sits on, is the film's
dazzling centerpiece.</LD>
<TE>   With this role following her much applauded appearance in Francois
Ozon's "Under the Sand," Rampling, after more than 35 years in the
business, is clearly at the peak of her powers.</TE>
<TE>   Cacoyannis, as is his tendency, has made it his business to
enthusiastically open up a play that takes place largely inside the
four walls of the Ranevskaya manor house. Working with
cinematographer Aris Stavrou and production designer Dionysis
Fotopoulos, Cacoyannis makes this turn-of-the-century world come to
life, a process aided by his deft use of the piano music of
Tchaikovsky played by Vladimir Ashkenazy.</TE>
<TE>   One immediate difference from the play is that this "Cherry
Orchard" starts well outside Russia proper, in the France where
Lyubov has exiled herself for five years after the accidental death
of her son. Her living situation has become so precarious that her
17-year-old daughter Anya (Tushka Bergen) comes to Paris with her
governess to bring her home.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the estate, everyone is in a tizzy about their mistress'
return. This group includes her feckless brother Gaev (Alan Bates),
interested only in working out difficult billiard shots; his ancient
servant Feers (Michael Gough, previously seen as Bruce Wayne's butler
in the "Batman" movies); the idealistic former tutor and perennial
student Trofimov (Andrew Howard); and Lyubov's adopted daughter Varya
(Katrin Cartlidge at her best), who functions as a kind of overseer
in her mother's absence.</TE>
<TE>   Having easily the most serious business with the mistress is
Lopakhin (Owen Teale), a former peasant who has grown into a savvy
and successful businessman. He reminds Lyubov and her brother that
the estate will be sold for back taxes unless they take drastic
action. He has a plan, which includes cutting down the orchard and
constructing summer villas, but the two won't hear of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Never have I met people as irresponsible, impractical and
irrational," Lopakhin complains. "You must face facts." Facing facts,
however, is the one thing these people have been raised not to do.</TE>
<TE>   Shot in Bulgaria, Cacoyannis' "Cherry Orchard" excels at making
the Ranevskaya estate feel especially authentic. The family orchard,
celebrated across the province for its size and beauty, has never
looked so out-and-out gorgeous, and the manor house, an impressive
ruin that is grand but quasi-dilapidated, is equally memorable.</TE>
<TE>   Because the film takes care to show us peasants still in
quasi-religious awe of the mistress 40 years after emancipation of
the serfs, this "Cherry Orchard" more than most gives us a sense of
why the family was so disconnected from reality, why they felt their
world and way of life could not possibly come to an end.</TE>
<TE>   Looking aristocratic, luminous yet careworn in Jane Hamilton's
exemplary costumes, Rampling gives a performance that could not be
improved upon as the gracious and genteel mistress of the estate,
oblivious, irresponsible yet deeply emotional, an aesthete to her
core. Lyubov's grace, bearing and refusal to believe what is
happening to her is central to Chekhov's sympathetic yet unblinking
view of a world that is soon to be no more.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, inevitably, it is Chekhov's brilliance we are saluting
here, his sure sense of a society coming apart from inside ("When
several cures are presented for the same disease," says Bates' Gaev,
"it means it's incurable") and his way of allowing all manner of
significant issues to emerge naturally from his wonderful characters.</TE>
<TE>   For if we disregard the occasionally overdone script and the
actors who hit things too hard, we are left as always with Chekhov's
effortless humanity, the sheer psychological acuity he brought to the
loves, hopes and inchoate longings of his characters. It was the
director Stanislavsky, who famously argued with Chekhov about the
staging of "The Cherry Orchard" for its 1904 premiere, who summed him
up: "It was only that he looked at the present without falsifying it.
He was not afraid of the truth."</TE>

<HD>Small-Town Girl Finds Big-City Success in Jazz</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can an ambitious and talented girl from the small Midwest farming
community of Windom, Minn., find success and happiness in the big
city? Let's say there's a fair chance. New York City's entertainment
world is rejuvenated every year by eager talent from the small towns
of America.</LD>
<LD>   But what if the girl's primary goal is to work as a jazz composer?
Now we're talking serious long shots, which makes the accomplishments
of Windom favorite daughter Maria Schneider all the more remarkable.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last decade, Schneider has organized and led her own jazz
orchestra, conducted numerous other ensembles (including the Carnegie
Hall Jazz Orchestra) in programs of her music, received several
Grammy nominations and been honored with a series of awards in Down
Beat magazine's critics' and readers' polls.</LD>
<TE>   The Maria Schneider Jazz Orchestra makes its debut appearances
tonight and Saturday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center's
Founders Hall. Her 18-piece ensemble is the largest to perform in the
299-seat venue, and seating will be in a traditional concert setting
rather than the nightclub-style table-and-chairs setup often used for
jazz performances. Her group also plays Sunday at Cal State
Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider, 41, was hardly an overnight success. Jazz doesn't have
an official glass ceiling, but far fewer females than males are
working as instrumental performers or composer-arrangers. So when she
arrived in New York in the mid-'80s, her options appeared limited,
despite her master's degree in composition from the Eastman School of
Music.</TE>
<TE>   Her break came with an invitation to work as musical assistant to
much-admired arranger-composer Gil Evans. But that was only the first
step up the ladder.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked at a club called Visiones with my orchestra every Monday
night for more than five years," she recalls. "The guys in the band
made $20, and I made $15. So I had to build a whole list of guys who
were very good but not very well known."</TE>
<TE>   She adds with a laugh, "That put me in the weird position of
wanting them to be successful with their own careers but not so
successful that they couldn't continue working with me."</TE>
<TE>   Schneider, with typical modesty, fails to mention that players
were eager for the opportunity to perform her music, which is both
technically challenging and creatively rewarding.</TE>
<TE>   Many of her finer works are chronicled in her three critically
praised albums: "Evanescence" (a 1994 tribute to Evans), "Coming
About" and "Allegresse" (all on the Enja label).</TE>
<TE>   In addition, there is a somewhat more unusual album, available
only as a promotional item.</TE>
<TE>   "It's called 'Days of Wine and Roses,'" says Schneider. "I had
worked at a vineyard in Germany, and they named this wine after me:
Maria Schneider Riesling. So I asked if I could make a live recording
with my band to market with the wine. Which was a great idea, since
I'd never done a live album.</TE>
<TE>   "We recorded at the Jazz Standard in New York, live to two-track.
And it came out really well--kind of like the feeling of sitting in
the club, actually listening to the band." She adds that Maria
Schneider Riesling is sold in Southern California at Bristol Farms
markets, packaged with the album.</TE>
<TE>   Writing and leading a large acoustic jazz ensemble may seem
anachronistic in an era when the guitar has been king and rock,
rhythm and blues, rap, hip-hop and electronica have been dominant.
But Schneider, fascinated with jazz as a teenager, eager to compose
in the genre, turned to the only outlets available.</TE>
<TE>   "In college," she says, "if you wanted to write for jazz musicians
and to write orchestrated music, the only ensemble that was available
was the big band. But I was always interested in approaching it from
a different perspective, using mutes and woodwinds and so forth so
that it had a chamber group sound and not just a combination of
trumpets, trombones, saxophones and rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   That innovative approach has remained an essential aspect of her
art. Consider, for example, the analogy she makes about composing and
playwriting.</TE>
<TE>   "My pieces," she says, "are a lot like plays, with the musicians
as the actors. I try to create stories and have the music develop and
go through different dramatic phases."</TE>
<TE>   Schneider also believes strongly in the descriptive power of music
and in its capacity to simulate experiences.</TE>
<TE>   "In my piece 'Hang Gliding'" on her "Allegresse" CD, she says, "I
tried to create an actual physical impression--the vicarious
experience of what it felt like for me to hang glide over a place
like Rio de Janeiro, of bobbing on top of a thermal, diving through
the air."</TE>
<TE>   Later this month, Schneider makes a sentimental journey home to
Windom, where she will perform with her orchestra for the first time
in her native Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   "Literally back home," she says, "in an auditorium that had gone
to ruin and has now been renovated. And that's very special to me,
because I want people in Windom to know that I would not be doing
what I'm doing if I hadn't had all those performance experiences in
that space--dancing, playing recitals and so forth.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I did something at Carnegie Hall, I walked out
onstage, and my impression was, 'Wow, this feels exactly like how the
high school auditorium in Windom felt when I went out to do my first
piano recital.'"</TE>
<TE>   The satisfying circularity of taking her art back to the place
where it began is understandably emotional for Schneider.</TE>
<TE>   "Half my pieces are really based on experiences I had there," she
says. "The truck stop where I was a waitress, the people I knew, the
experiences I had. The people who come to hear us in Orange County
are going to hear all sorts of stories about Windom, Minn., when I
describe my pieces, and actually experience it in a vicarious sort of
way when I play them.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the fact that I'm from a small town," Schneider adds.
"Windom was the greatest. But now that I've been in New York for
about 17 years, New York is the greatest too. Maybe I just think any
place I am is the greatest. And maybe that's the way it's supposed to
be."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In its inaugural season, the Music of Changes series is taking a risk
with its format of devoting entire concerts to one composer, chosen
via competition. But at least you do get a chance to sample a wide
spectrum of a composer's chamber music and get a feeling for his or
her style.</LD>
<LD>   This was certainly the case in Wednesday night's encounter at the
Colburn School's Zipper Hall with Colombian-born Alba Potes, now a
U.S. citizen who teaches in Philadelphia. Her program covered a
decade of work, including a number of solo pieces, two tiny song
cycles, and the world premiere of a chamber quintet commissioned by
Music of Changes.</LD>
<LD>   In her preconcert talk, Potes said that she didn't feel obligated
to write Colombian music per se, and the results suggested that,
indeed, musical nationalism is not her main agenda. Her work is
mostly atonal, often fragmented in flow and spare in gesture, with
not much of a role for strong rhythm and, in "Touches" for solo
cello, it contains only the barest wisps of folk flavor.</LD>
<TE>   Potes can stimulate the senses when she gets a palette of unusual
timbres to play with. The most evocative piece happened to be the
world premiere of " ... and the breeze carries a scent of Cadmias,"
in which you could feel the sultry heat of her native city, Cali,
augmented by imaginative washes of percussion and plunks from the
piano strings. Also "Everyone Sings a Song of Peace at Least Once," a
workout for the hands and voice of percussionist Brian Bartel, had
some verve and vivacity.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, many of these pieces did not live up to the
appetite-whetting descriptions in the program notes.</TE>

<HD>Allen Trio Extols Individuality</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pianist Geri Allen's opening set at the Catalina Bar &amp; Grill
Wednesday night had a cool, somewhat detached quality--not
surprising, given the sparse size of the audience. Nor could one
reasonably expect to hear an intuitively intimate, musically
integrated group of performances from a trio assembled solely for the
gig.</LD>
<LD>   That's not to fault any of the individual artists. Allen's
multifaceted career has taken her through everything from avant-garde
jazz to lyrical balladry. Bassist Robert Hurst and drummer Ralph
Penland are two of the Southland's most dependable rhythm section
players--first call for every kind of jazz gig.</LD>
<LD>   But great individual talent doesn't always result in completely
selfless ensemble playing. And Allen was wise to keep the set focused
on the fine improvising of the individual players (as well as
herself), offering each ample time to stretch out and display their
own virtuosic wares.</LD>
<TE>   That stretching-out took place over the course of a program of
material reaching back into a number of Allen albums. Some of the
high points: "Drummer's Song" and "In the Middle" from the album
"Twenty One"; "Dolphy's Dance" from the album "Maroons."</TE>
<TE>   Here too, however, Allen ran into a bit of a snag. Jazz audiences
depend upon familiar or reasonably accessible harmonies to provide a
reference point during improvisations.</TE>
<TE>   And this is the case even when the process takes place
unconsciously, which is one of the reasons why the chord pattern of
the 12-bar blues, with its inherent qualities of movement, repetition
and resolution, is so pleasing to listeners.</TE>
<TE>   Allen's pieces were filled with attractive, darting melodies and
surging undercurrents of rhythm. But they offered little in the way
of immediately referential harmonies.</TE>
<TE>   The result was that, once the soloing began, the improvisations
surfaced as quick-fingered displays of technique rather than
potentially more intriguing extensions and variations flowing from
the opening themes.</TE>
<TE>   Since each of the players possesses strong, imaginative musical
skills, there were more than a few passages in which their
inventiveness prevailed. But this essentially anarchistic musical
approach more often left something to be desired.</TE>
<TE>   And by the close of the set, one couldn't help but wish that there
had been at least one standard tune, even a straight-ahead blues, to
help pull the audience into a more connected enjoyment of the music.</TE>
<TE>   The Geri Allen Trio at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga
Blvd., Hollywood. Tonight, late set only at 10:30 p.m. $16 cover.

<HD>Two Rising Stars, Two Paths to Fulfill Potential</HD>
<DH>Norah Jones captivates in singing other writers' lyrics;
John Mayer sings his own but with less conviction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's an old saying in boxing that a good big man can always beat a
good little man, and the parallel in pop music is that a good
singer-songwriter can connect more consistently than simply a good
singer.</LD>
<LD>   In contrast to the pre-rock era, when singers just sang and
writers just wrote, the tendency of today's most gifted songwriters
is to follow the path of Bob Dylan and the Beatles and record their
own material. That makes it difficult for nonwriting singers to come
up with enough memorable new songs to keep listeners enthralled.</LD>
<LD>   So John Mayer went into Wednesday's "rising star" pairing at the
House of Blues in West Hollywood with a decided edge over Norah
Jones.</LD>
<TE>   By the end of the evening, however, Jones' captivating vocals
inspired a new pop truism: A potentially great singer can touch us
more consistently than simply a good singer-songwriter.</TE>
<TE>   Both young artists are highly touted. Their debut recordings are
in the national Top 100 sales chart. Rolling Stone magazine lists
them among the 10 pop acts most worth watching in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Mayer, the evening's headliner, is a 24-year-old singer-songwriter
from Atlanta whose songs are mostly framed with the intricate,
sometimes sophisticated musical design that is in pop favor these
days. Think Dave Matthews and David Gray.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas-based Jones, 22, writes an occasional song but relies
mainly on others for material. Though critics have cited everyone
from Billie Holiday to Nina Simone to Patsy Cline in describing her
whispery, restrained style, Jones brings a strong personal stamp to
her vocals that works against such easy categorization.</TE>
<TE>   While schooled in jazz, Jones employs the instincts of a soulful
pop singer, with a strain of country running through her music and
phrasing.</TE>
<TE>   Backed tastefully by Lee Alexander on bass and Adam Levy on
guitar, Jones sat passively at an electric piano, saying little
between songs and offering little visual punctuation during them.
It's as if she saves all her energy and emotion for the vocals.</TE>
<TE>   She opened with "Turn Me On," an old song by John D. Loudermilk, a
country-pop writer whose tunes, like Roger Miller's, often had a wry,
novelty edge. You could imagine Loudermilk chuckling to himself as he
put together the images in this tale of sexual yearning: "Like a
flower waiting to bloom/Like a lightbulb in a dark room/I'm just
sitting here waiting for you/to come home and turn me on."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, however, reached for the song's deeper, underlying sense of
desire, and she hit the target superbly, sending an immediate signal
of the thoughtful, artful edge in her approach to music. She doesn't
exhibit a lot of range as a singer, sticking to a soft, melancholy
tone that would make the Leonard Cohen songbook ideal for her, but
her control and conviction make every note seem fresh and affecting.</TE>
<TE>   After following with a version of Hank Williams' "Cold, Cold
Heart" that showed more of a personal stamp than her somewhat
straight reading of the country classic on her "Come Away With Me"
album, Jones turned to some original material that for the most part
proved equally well-suited to her approach.</TE>
<TE>   Her own compositions, including the album's title number and
"Nightingale," are pleasant but routine expressions of longing, but
her musical cohorts on the album (Alexander and guitarist Jesse
Harris) have provided some truly absorbing tunes. Among them: Harris'
"Don't Know Why," a gently understated tale of romantic
second-guessing, and Alexander's "Lonestar," a disarming daydream.</TE>
<TE>   Jones could have an appealing career if she simply concentrated on
classic material, but her chief challenge is to keep finding worthy
new numbers that reflect her sensibilities as she matures.</TE>
<TE>   Mayer, who was joined by a three-piece band for his nearly
two-hour set, was the crowd favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Like Jones, he is blessed with pinup good looks, which led to lots
of shrieking from the female fans near the front of the stage.</TE>
<TE>   There's a rich, fresh-faced exuberance and charm to his
songs--from the self-affirmation of "No Such Thing" to the open
sensual celebration of "Your Body Is a Wonderland"--that is easy to
embrace.</TE>
<TE>   Like Matthews and Gray, he's a writer with an obvious gift for
designing striking musical frames. To move to the next level,
however, he needs to inject more character and depth to the stories
inside the frames, in the manner of, say, Sting, another obvious
model, or Rufus Wainwright, a young rival with more original flair.
Mayer shows hints of that potential in "St. Patrick's Day," a winning
tale of romantic optimism.</TE>
<TE>   All too often, however, Mayer seems stuck in musical ideas that
are both narrow and familiar. Only during his extended, blues-driven
guitar solos does he seem to consistently step beyond the boundaries
and reach for something deeper inside.</TE>

<HD>Celebrating the Garage Spirit of Rock</HD>
<DH>Steven Van Zandt will be a hands-on host as his show
recalls the energy and spirit of garage bands. It all started with
the Kingsmen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steven Van Zandt remembers buying the record that changed his life.
"It would have to be the classic 'Louie Louie,'" he said. "That's
where it all started."</LD>
<LD>   It all is Van Zandt's singular career, most prominently as Bruce
Springsteen's E Street Band guitarist-sidekick in the 1970s and '80s
and again in the last two years with the band's reunion, plus his
role as writer and producer with his own Disciples of Soul, Southside
Johnny and the anti-apartheid landmark "Sun City" project. Van Zandt
has also achieved visibility in a different setting, playing the
scowling mobster Silvio Dante in HBO's "The Sopranos."</LD>
<LD>   Still, he's also referring to a whole movement of American rock
music that can be traced to the inspiration of the Kingsmen's 1963
three-chord tour de force, which--with its mumbled vocals, fumbled
notes and fuzzy guitars--sent Van Zandt and a generation of musicians
to their garages to try to do it themselves. It's a music and spirit
that Van Zandt will be celebrating with a new syndicated radio show,
"Little Steven's Underground Garage." The weekly two-hour program
premieres this weekend, airing in Los Angeles on KLSX-FM (97.1) on
Saturdays at 10 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   "It's one of those songs that before that time would have just
been a local, crazy hit and then quietly die," Van Zandt said. "But
when those things break through, they have a profound effect on the
national psyche: 'Whoa! Anybody can do this?'"</TE>
<TE>   Van Zandt took the initial inspiration to heart, starting his own
first garage band (called the Source) in 1966 at age 16 in his
working-class suburban New Jersey neighborhood. He was hardly alone.
Kids around the country grabbed electric guitars and repaired to
their respective garages, bashing out their own roughhewn echoes of
the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, the Who, the Yardbirds
and other British rockers--themselves influenced by American blues,
rock and soul. And while Van Zandt's teen band never had much impact
outside its garage, others actually had hits.</TE>
<TE>   After the Kingsmen emerged from the Pacific Northwest, garage rock
reverberated from Boston (the Standells' "Dirty Water") to Chicago
(the Shadows of Knight's version of Van Morrison and Them's "Gloria")
to Texas (the 13th Floor Elevators' "You're Gonna Miss Me") to San
Jose (Count Five's "Psychotic Reaction").</TE>
<TE>   "I use the [mid-'60s] British Invasion as the heart and soul of
garage music," he said of the show's philosophy. "Everything before
led to that invasion, and everything since came from it."</TE>
<TE>   Van Zandt is not the first to push a revival of this music. As
early as 1973, Lenny Kaye, a rock critic and later guitarist for
Patti Smith, compiled an anthology of the music titled "Nuggets,"
which with its raucous spirit and do-it-yourself ethic proved a
touchstone collection for the nascent punk of the Ramones and others.
It continued in the '80s with such scenes as L.A.'s Paisley
Underground led by bands including the Dream Syndicate, Rain Parade
and the Bangles, and again to some extent with the '90s grunge of
Nirvana and Pearl Jam.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Rhino Records issued a four-CD "Nuggets" collection going
deeper into the genre's treasure chest--followed last year with
four-CD "Nuggets II," exploring the '60s phenomenon outside the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   For the last year, Van Zandt has been one of the organizers of a
weekly "Cave Stomp" night at a New York club, showcasing mostly new
acts inspired by the original garage rockers. And around the world,
new bands in that mode are cropping up--notably the White Stripes
from Detroit, the Strokes from New York and the Hives from Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   All of this will figure in the programming of the show. "It's
going to be a whole wide range of garage--as I define it," said Van
Zandt. "It's completely subjective, but I'll start with the British
Invasion, go into the classic 'Nuggets' stuff of the later '60s. I'll
go into the punk stuff with Iggy Pop, and later the Ramones and the
'70s stuff, then the first real wave of later garage started by [Bomp
Records label owner] Greg Shaw, the '80s stuff of bands like the
Vipers and Chesterfield Kings. It will be quite a range from the
almost 40 years of garage."</TE>
<TE>   The garage spirit is also exemplified by the way Van Zandt
approached the business side of the venture, handling most of the
arrangements himself rather than farming the show out to a
syndication firm to find stations around the country to carry it. For
sponsorship, he lined up the Hard Rock Cafe chain, which had already
been involved in the "Cave Stomp" shows, and gave the company a "Hard
Rock presents" credit in the show's title. Pepsi and Unilever also
signed on as national sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm completely hands-on," he said. "It's a do-it-yourself kind of
thing, and we take it literally. It was such a longshot when we
started that everyone was trying to be positive and supportive, but
you could tell they thought, 'No way.' But the time has come for
this, and I'm not taking no for an answer. I said, 'We'll find 25 or
35 cool stations that will put this on,' and we're finding them."</TE>
<TE>   In a time marked by prepackaged pop acts, Van Zandt believes that
the underground resurgence of garage rock can again affect the
national musical psyche with the kind of exposure he hopes to give
it. Although he said the trend remains "very much under the radar,"
it has already had a profound effect on him, spurring his return to
music with his own "Born Again Savage" album released two years ago
and his reteaming with Springsteen the same year after leaving the E
Street Band in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   "It really got me back into music," he said. "Which I thought was
impossible."</TE>

<TE>   Boldly they rode and well,</TE>
<TE>   Into the jaws of Death,</TE>
<TE>   Into the mouth of Hell</TE>
<TE>   Rode the ... network anchors.</TE>
<TE>   That's not quite the way England's 19th century poet laureate,
Alfred Tennyson, wrote "The Charge of the Light Brigade." Nor is this
the Crimea.</TE>
<TE>   But good morning, America, isn't that ABC's Charles Gibson,
usually genial in New York, now greeting viewers as window dressing
from Jerusalem? Also MSNBC anchor Brian Williams, doing triple duty
from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv on NBC's "Today" and "Nightly News" as
well as on his own cable newscast?</TE>
<TE>   And if any Los Angeles viewers had two TV sets tuned
simultaneously to CBS and CNN at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, they saw a pair
of bush-jacketed Dan Rathers, one on videotape anchoring "The CBS
Evening News" from Jerusalem, the other live from Jerusalem checking
in with Larry King.</TE>
<TE>   "Danger is my business," Rather informed his rapt CNN interviewer
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Cameras to the right of them, cameras to the left of them, cameras
in front of them, into the bloody maw of Israeli-Palestinian violence
they charged: Last week ABC's Peter Jennings and NBC's Tom Brokaw
jetting in for a look, this week "Good Morning America" co-host
Gibson, Williams and battle-tested Rather surging to the forefront of
their networks' coverage, as President Bush on Thursday urged Israel
to "halt incursions" and withdraw from territory it has recently
occupied.</TE>
<TE>   It's been the biggest gathering of media Mt. Rushmores abroad
perhaps since the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when Rather
and Jennings were airlifted to West Berlin to join at the hip with
Brokaw in front of the Brandenburg Gate, before scaling that
once-notorious freedom barrier on ladders like Batman.</TE>
<TE>   That historic event delivered optimism, euphoria and chills up the
spine. Now comes the Middle East, where the loudest, most deafening
blast of Jewish-Arab hatred in years features relentless Palestinian
suicide bombings that slaughter Israeli civilians and powerful
Israeli forces grinding up defiant Palestinians while rolling across
the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The presence of news stars is hardly needed to signify the
enormity of what is happening now. Network anchors by tradition,
though, are not only journalist-presenters but human exclamation
points. The message (a questionable one) is that having them on the
scene somehow lifts the level of reporting and commitment.</TE>
<TE>   So naturally KABC-TV brought Los Angeles viewers Travels With
Charlie by satellite early Thursday. "Can you tell us a little bit
about those [control zones]?" an "Eyewitness News" anchor asked
Gibson, the station's designated expert in one of those curious TV
dialogues where journalists quiz each other.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Jennings, too, interviewed Gibson. On the Fox News Channel,
commentator Tony Snow interviewed anchor Brit Hume. On MSNBC, an
anchor and reporter interviewed NBC's Washington bureau chief and
"Meet the Press" host Tim Russert.</TE>
<TE>   And on CBS Thursday morning, prior to Bush saying he will send
Secretary of State Colin Powell to the Middle East, "Early Show"
co-host Jane Clayson asked Rather from New York: "Can you tell us
what will break this impasse?" To his credit, Rather said he didn't
know.</TE>
<TE>   By then, however, he'd already etched himself into this ugly
history by reporting at length Monday and Tuesday about a Palestinian
car bomber whose explosive detonated prematurely at a checkpoint
between East and West Jerusalem that Rather and his crew had passed
moments earlier. They peeled back, camera rolling.</TE>
<TE>   Although this was a relatively minor explosion that killed only
the bomber, CBS played it big because of the Rather group's close
proximity and because it had footage. "There was this muffled
varoom," he told Clayson, assigned by her show to debrief Rather this
week. "Take care, and be safe," she later told him.</TE>
<TE>   "This war is not about journalists, [and] frankly too much can be
made of this," Rather said after describing the bomb incident again,
this time to the inquiring King.</TE>
<TE>   "Does it not give you ... a greater understanding what it's like
living day after day there?" King wondered.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to walk the ground, be here, to experience it,"
Rather replied.</TE>
<TE>   Other feet have preceded him. The shriveled foreign presence of
the networks in the last decade notwithstanding, Israel is one place
abroad where they still maintain bureaus, along with veterans with
the talent and experience to probe beneath the surface. As in CBS
correspondent Bob Simon's notably smart and balanced story on
Wednesday's "60 Minutes II" about "transfer"--a proposal for removing
Arabs from the area--that has gained stature among mainstream
Israelis after this latest crush of suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   It's no wonder that Simon's piece stood out.</TE>
<TE>   So-called golden ages are rarely what they're said to be, and it's
not as if network news ever earned the icon status amnesiacs grant
it. Television by definition is too dependent on pictures to inform
the public fully, moreover. And even before he passed CBS anchorship
to Rather, Walter Cronkite was accurately branding TV news
essentially a headline service. That title not only still applies
today, but the stories beneath the headlines seem generally shorter
and thinner than ever.</TE>
<TE>   The networks can still rise to an epic challenge, evidenced by
Sept. 11, when they, and ABC News and Jennings in particular,
distinguished themselves in the initial aftermath of terrorist
attacks on the U.S. in coverage that Americans tuned to by the
multitudes. The present Israeli-Palestinian war is another of those
times when TV's combat reporting is sometimes high, given limits
placed on media by the Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Brokaw, Jennings and Rather appear to be the John Cameron
Swayzes of this age, destined to be rendered obsolete, along with
many of their colleagues and the eroding tradition they represent, by
economics, changing tastes, shrunken news holes and the technologies
of the Internet and cable.</TE>
<TE>   "Dan Rather, on the scene in Jerusalem," King announced at one
point Tuesday. You can't escape the feeling, however, that this
brigade's war-zone charge may be one of its last.</TE>

<HD>Playful Film Overcomes Trouble With Its Plot and Timing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Big Trouble" has been in nothing but big trouble. Not for what it is
but for a situation it inadvertently found itself enmeshed in that
it's now trying to escape.</LD>
<LD>   "Big Trouble" is a pleasant diversion, a lightly amusing criminal
comedy with a plot so complicated even the people in it can't quite
believe what's happening. It's based on a novel by Dave Barry, one of
America's truly funny columnists, and it's directed by Barry
Sonnenfeld, who did "Get Shorty" and "Men in Black." So far, no
trouble.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, one of the film's manic moments has two of the
dumbest criminals imaginable hoodwinking overworked airport security
personnel and getting both a handgun and an enormous nuclear device
onto a plane. Not the best of luck for a film that was scheduled to
go into theaters just days after Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   That scene may never play the way it was intended, but now that
"Big Trouble" is finally being released, it can otherwise stand on
its own as a playful trifle that feels so much like a genial knockoff
of "Get Shorty" that it might as well be called "Get Shorter."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to director Sonnenfeld, both films share a pair of
featured actors (Rene Russo and Dennis Farina) as well as a droll
sensibility filtered through assorted high livers and low lifes, hit
men who believe in manners, rent-a-cops who can't tell a squirt gun
from the real thing and desperate people "tired of living from foot
to mouth."</TE>
<TE>   On the debit side, non-charismatic star Tim Allen, who plays
newspaper-columnist-turned- advertising-man Eliot Arnold, will never
be mistaken for John Travolta. On the other hand, "Get Shorty" didn't
have this film's psychedelic toad, an impressive animal, well worth
the three "toad puppeteers" it employs, able to spray whoever's handy
with a potent liquid hallucinogen.</TE>
<TE>   Novelist Barry said he got the core idea for "Big Trouble," which
shares a fondness for Florida gothic with the works of Carl Hiaasen,
when his son was in a game that demanded a nighttime squirt gun
attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I started," he says, "with what would happen if kids showed up to
squirt the kid in the house at the same time professional killers,
hit men, showed up really to kill the owner of the house." That would
be Arthur Herk (an energized Stanley Tucci), described as "one of the
few Floridians not confused when he voted for Pat Buchanan."</TE>
<TE>   His stepdaughter and "Ghost World" refugee Jenny (Zooey Deschanel)
is supposed to be squirted by Eliot's son Matt (Ben Foster), which is
how Eliot (upgraded from an ordinary scribe to a Pulitzer Prize
winner by writers Robert Ramsey &amp; Matthew Stone) ends up meeting
Jenny's long-suffering but still attractive mother, Anna (Russo).</TE>
<TE>   Also involved in the madness are the law-breakers, exasperated
$25,000-a-pop hit man Henry (Farina) and the two most cretinous
criminals in the greater Miami area, Snake (Tom Sizemore) and Eddie
(MTV's Johnny Knoxville), bad guys of such limited brainpower they
can't figure out how to deal with the "Departures/Arrivals" sign at
the airport.</TE>
<TE>   With criminals you get lawmen, in this case Janeane Garofalo and
Patrick Warburton as overmatched Miami cops and Omar Epps and Dwight
"Heavy D" Myers as FBI men in awe of the powers they have under
"Special Executive Order 768-dash-04."</TE>
<TE>   Add to this mix a blissed-out space cadet named Puggy (Jason Lee),
who moved to Miami for the Fritos; a gorgeous maid named Nina (Sofia
Vergara); two laconic Russian arms dealers; and one very powerful
weapon and you have the kind of continual chaos Sonnenfeld is
especially adept at orchestrating.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't even get into Martha Stewart, the Discovery Channel
and that trouble-making toad, all of which have key parts to play in
the film's brisk 85 minutes. "The longer I stay around here," someone
says, "the weirder it gets." He's got that right.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for language, crude humor and sex-related
material. Times guidelines: It's all in good fun.</TE>

<HD>A Woman at Whims of Fate in 'Maelstrom'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Denis Villeneuve's "Maelstrom" is the right title for a portrait of a
young Montreal woman, coming apart in the aftermath of an abortion,
whose story is, incredibly enough, being narrated by a fish as he is
being hacked to death in a fish market.</LD>
<LD>   In this stylish, breathless film, very much the dynamic work of a
young man of talent, passion and brashness, Villeneuve misses no
opportunity to give cosmic dimensions to his heroine's predicament.
As she finds herself overcome by guilt for aborting her pregnancy,
Marie-Josee Croze's Bibi plunges into a downward spiral in which
fate, coincidence and romance loom large. Villeneuve dares much and
pulls it all off.</LD>
<LD>   No sooner does Bibi leave the abortion clinic than she is
confronted by her irate brother, her partner in a successful chain of
clothing boutiques, for having let their business slide into
financial disaster. In the meantime, she is counseled by her
well-meaning friend (Stephanie Morgenstern), a veteran of three
abortions and an academic whose good advice is undermined by her
intellectualizing. She's so self-satisfied by her opinions and how
grandly she delivers them she fails to grasp that Bibi is sliding
into despair.</LD>
<TE>   Then fate walks in, making everything infinitely worse for Bibi,
only to be followed by a coincidence that carries with it the
possibility of a redemptive romance and a terrible irony. So dire are
the straits for Bibi that Villeneuve offers two possible endings,
underlining the role of chance in our destinies and the need for us
to take responsibilities for our actions.</TE>
<TE>   This is a nervy, risky film, and Villeneuve has inspired Croze to
give herself over completely to the tormented persona of Bibi. He has
done the same with Jean-Nicolas Verreault as the charming young man
whose sudden presence in Bibi's life promises a redeeming romance
that carries with it a specific potential for bringing her more grief
than she can bear.</TE>
<TE>   "Maelstrom" has been shot in high-contrast muted color by Andre
Turpin with a self-confidence that matches that of Villeneuve, and
the film has been enveloped in Pierre Desrochers' suitably sweeping,
turbulent score. Best of all, amid much sturm und drang, Villeneuve
displays a dark, jaunty saving sense of humor. "Maelstrom" is a
splendid instance of a surrealist vision that serves to heighten the
impact of genuine emotions experienced by believably real people.</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: some nudity, sex, complex adult themes.</TE>

<HD>Hoping to Catch That Wave</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* Surf bands, celebrating endless summer since the
'60s, hope for future Grammy recognition and plan a weekend reunion
concert.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new Grammy category for surf music?</LD>
<LD>   "I'm filling out the paperwork," says John Zambetti, a voting
member of the Grammy-bestowing recording academy. He's also singer,
songwriter and guitarist for the surf band the Malibooz.</LD>
<LD>   "Why not? They've got polka and merengue categories," he says.
"Surf music has had a worldwide influence. People should really take
a look."</LD>
<TE>   Zambetti knows the odds are slim, so for now he's content to
champion the music through his group's music and such events as
Saturday's Endless Summer Reunion surf music concert and fund-raiser
at the Galaxy Concert Theatre in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   The Malibooz will share the bill with three other Southland surf
bands: the Blue Hawaiians, the Torquays and the Sandals, the 1960s
San Clemente group that composed and performed the musical score for
"Endless Summer," director Bruce Brown's 1966 classic surf film. The
beneficiary is the nonprofit Huntington Beach International Surfing
Museum.</TE>
<TE>   "Southern California gets put down a lot, as if there is no
culture here," says Zambetti, who works as an emergency room
physician in Lancaster and lives in Malibu. "To me, surf music really
synthesizes all the different aspects of Southern California culture:
The music echoes the sounds of the ocean; the guitar work is a
[culturally diverse] mixture of Middle Eastern and Spanish music
[with rock], and the lyrics celebrate the Southern California
lifestyle. Maybe it's a little rosier than it really is, but it's a
reflection of something that's truly ours, and we really should
embrace it."</TE>
<TE>   Surf music grew out of the instrumental rock tradition of such
late-'50s hits as Duane Eddy's "Rebel Rouser," the Champs' "Tequila"
and Link Wray's "Rumble," records that put the sound of the electric
guitar front and center.</TE>
<TE>   Such instrumentals quickly became a favorite among surfers, mostly
dance-happy teens whose parties didn't need lyrics or singers.</TE>
<TE>   Two Southland acts working simultaneously launched the surf music
craze: Orange County's Dick Dale and the Deltones and South Bay surf
band the Belairs.</TE>
<TE>   Those acts inspired brothers Brian, Carl and Dennis Wilson,
cousins Mike Love and friend Al Jardine to mimic the surf sound and
add vocal harmonies when they formed the Beach Boys.</TE>
<TE>   The tide went out on surf music the minute the Beatles and other
British rock groups stepped ashore in the mid-'60s. At least that's
the conventional wisdom, and it's true to the extent that few surf
bands, especially the instrumental groups, had any significant effect
on the charts after 1966.</TE>
<TE>   But when director Quentin Tarantino opened his 1994 film "Pulp
Fiction" with Dale's "Misirlou," a surf music renaissance that had
begun in 1979 hit high gear.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since the music was featured in 'Pulp Fiction,' the number
of bands playing, recording or performing surf music just keeps
growing," says John Blair, a surf music historian and leader of the
surf band Jon &amp; the Nightriders.</TE>
<TE>   "'Pulp Fiction' had the same effect on surf music in 1984 that 'O
Brother, Where Art Thou?' has had on bluegrass and mountain music. I
think the conditions were similar then: Kids had gotten tired of
hearing the same stuff and musicians are looking for something
different to play."</TE>
<TE>   Blair, who organized Saturday's concert, can name two dozen bands
playing surf music in Southern California and a dozen first-wave
groups that are still active.</TE>
<TE>   He also keeps a list of at least 70 bands around the world playing
surf music, in Norway (Beat Tornadoes), Finland (Laika &amp; the
Cosmonauts), Japan (Surf Coasters), New Zealand (Hollow Grinders),
Croatia (Bambi Molesters), Germany (Los Banditos) and Israel
(Astroglides).</TE>
<TE>   Today's bands generally fall into one of two camps.</TE>
<TE>   The first holds tight to the original model of reverb-drenched
music played on Fender Stratocaster guitars through Fender Dual
Showman amplifiers.</TE>
<TE>   Those were the key tools that guitar-maker Leo Fender created in
conjunction with Dale, who reportedly destroyed 40 Fender amplifiers
before he and Fender came up with a design that could withstand
Dale's drive to re-create in music the exhilarating feeling he got
riding a surfboard.</TE>
<TE>   The other camp strives to expand surf music with more complex song
structures, varied instrumentation and, in those that incorporate
vocals, thematic issues that go beyond beach parties and hot rods.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to re-create the past," says Gaston Georis of
the Sandals, which is giving its first live performance Saturday
since the band broke up in 1968. "We've all evolved as musicians and
as human beings in different ways."</TE>
<TE>   "We're still going to play some of the 'Endless Summer' music,"
adds Belgium-born Georis. "We're not there to snub our nose at
anything or anyone."</TE>
<TE>   And what of Grammy recognition?</TE>
<TE>   "If doesn't happen, it doesn't happen," says Zambetti. "But it
would be nice to recognize something that's really part of American
culture."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Sandals, the Blue Hawaiians, the Malibooz, the Torquays and
the Reventlos play Saturday at the Galaxy Concert Theatre, 3503 S.
Harbor Blvd., Santa Ana. 6 p.m. $18-$100; proceeds benefit the
Huntington Beach International Surfing Museum. (714) 957-0600.</TE>

<HD>'A Season on the Brink' Creators Cry Foul</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the predominantly negative reviews began to appear for sports
network ESPN's first made-for-TV movie, "A Season on the Brink," the
film's creative team wasn't surprised. In fact, it had assembled its
own negative review for the network--in the form of a memo detailing
changes it felt were necessary--before the project was shown last
month.</LD>
<LD>   "I watched it at home, and I was heartsick," said writer-producer
David Rintels. "The picture was just unrecognizable."</LD>
<LD>   "Bad reviews are always painful," added director Robert Mandel,
"but it's extra painful when you get bad reviews for something you
didn't do."</LD>
<TE>   Based on the best-selling book providing a behind-the-scenes look
at former Indiana basketball coach Bob Knight, the movie turned out
to be a success for ESPN commercially. Even though many critics
derided the film (The Times' Howard Rosenberg called it "pointless
and utterly numbing"), the initial simulcast on ESPN and ESPN2 drew
more than 5 million viewers, a strong performance by cable standards.</TE>
<TE>   Still, ill feelings the production left behind underscore tensions
that exist between creative personnel and networks as TV executives
increasingly put their imprint on the production process, exerting
control over decision-making and responsibilities once left under the
aegis of producers.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of "Season on the Brink," which starred Brian Dennehy
as Knight, an ESPN executive was on the set throughout the
production. After filming was completed, the network sent its own
camera crew to Bloomington, Ind., shooting footage that was inserted
into the movie. ESPN also brought in its own team to reedit the
film--according to the filmmakers, keeping them out of the editing
room.</TE>
<TE>   "They just came in like Attila the Hun and rode rampant through
the thing," said Dennehy from Chicago, where he is starring in a
stage production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night." "The fact is
that they were arrogant and high-handed about the whole thing....
They wouldn't listen. They wouldn't use the talent that they had
hired."</TE>
<TE>   Added Dennehy's longtime manager, Susan Smith: "Never in my
experience has a film been so completely taken away from the creative
group."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Shapiro, ESPN's senior vice president and general manager of
programming, was credited as an executive producer on the film, which
is also unusual. Shapiro acknowledged that the network was closely
involved in the production but insisted those plans were made clear
from the outset and that ESPN collaborated freely with the
filmmakers. "We always told them, knowing sports more than anyone
else, that we were going to be hands-on," he said, calling
disagreements over the changes "just part of the compromise and the
tussle and bustle of doing a project."</TE>
<TE>   Producers of made-for-TV movies nevertheless complain about
greater encroachment by executives. Many are reluctant to publicly
discuss the shift, for fear of alienating those who can order their
projects--an especially scary proposition, industry sources noted,
given that the major networks are producing fewer movies and
miniseries than in years past, making producers more reliant on cable
channels.</TE>
<TE>   Networks such as MTV, VH1, Court TV and ESPN have all added
original movies to their programming menu in recent years, though in
some instances producers say such channels insist on a level of
influence beyond the traditional norm.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran TV producers also point out that the current environment
is a departure from the way the TV movie business was conducted in
its heyday, when producers were empowered to pursue a specific
creative vision once the script was approved.</TE>
<TE>   'There's a Fear of Being Identified'</TE>
<TE>   "These are things that would have never taken place 20 years ago,"
said Jerry Isenberg, a former producer and network executive who
teaches at the USC School of Cinema-Television. "The whole culture at
the [program] buying level is a desire for producers to lay down and
for creative people to do what [the networks] want. There's a fear of
being identified as someone who is willing to fight."</TE>
<TE>   Isenberg, in fact, went so far as to draft a "creative bill of
rights" during his tenure as chairman of the Caucus for Television
Producers, Writers and Directors--an honorary group consisting
primarily of those who have worked in TV production--with the hope of
establishing parameters delineating where the network's authority
ends and the producer's begins.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley Brooks, the executive producer of "Season on the Brink,"
declined to be interviewed. Other members of the creative team,
however, say that ESPN's reediting altered the film's structure, with
several scenes that would have better connected the basketball
footage to the central plot line and more fully explored Knight's
character either excised, trimmed or rearranged.</TE>
<TE>   "None of this has ever happened in my experience in the business,"
said Rintels, whose TV credits include the historical dramas "Day
One," "Sakharov" and "World War II: When Lions Roared."</TE>
<TE>   According to Shapiro, the post-production process was rushed
because ESPN was committed to televising the movie March 10, after
NCAA tournament pairings were announced; still, he said the producers
were kept "very much involved" and the movie largely adhered to
Rintels' screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   "If he didn't like the finished product, that means he didn't like
his script," Shapiro said.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN, meanwhile, is already developing its next dramatic project,
about the terrorist attack against Israeli athletes at the 1972
Olympics in Munich. As for "A Season on the Brink," Shapiro made no
apologies, saying the network spent millions on the production and
was within its rights to "push for the product that we envisioned."</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way it'll be in the future too," he said. "Nobody
knows our fans better than we do."</TE>
<TE>   Dennehy said the experience soured him on working for the network
again and that ESPN would have difficulty "getting serious people
involved" in the future. Still, he added that producers have little
recourse in such situations.</TE>
<TE>   "Inevitably, whoever pays the piper calls the tune," Dennehy said.</TE>

<HD>'Lucky Break' Creates Disarming Diversion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Lucky Break" is an amiably engaging British prison comedy with just
enough serious shading to set off its humor; it was directed by "The
Full Monty's" Peter Cattaneo with the same affection for the
vicissitudes of game but feckless men that made the earlier film a
hit.</LD>
<LD>   Developed from an idea of Cattaneo into a script by Ronan Bennett,
"Lucky Break," however, has a strong enough personality not to be
merely a reworking of "Monty," despite certain similarities.</LD>
<LD>   James Nesbitt's Jimmy Hands and Lennie James' Rudy Guscott are
lifelong pals who've grown up to be notably inept crooks who blow
their one big chance of a major payday and land in a prison run by
Christopher Plummer's Graham Mortimer, a decent sort who loves
musicals and idolizes Lord Nelson.</LD>
<TE>   Jimmy arrives in a defiant mood, but his lot improves when
Mortimer discovers that he loves musicals too. Mortimer has been
attempting to fuse his twin passions by trying his hand at writing a
musical about the hero of the Battle of Trafalgar. Jimmy is swiftly
enlisted to help mount an inmate production.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy has been urged to sign up for an anger management course
conducted by the head of the prison support unit, Annabel (Olivia
Williams), and it's clear romance is afoot. In the meantime, he's got
lots of changes to go through, and there's a plot, which won't be
revealed here.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its easy charm, "Lucky Break" doesn't forget that it is
set in a prison. The downside of Mortimer's preoccupation with the
musical is the obtuseness of a hateful chief guard (Ron Cook); when
he is caught in an embarrassing moment by Jimmy's cellmate Cliff
(Timothy Spall), there's hell to pay."Nelson the Musical" is amusing,
a cheery travesty that boasts a traditional yet appealing love song
by Nesbitt and Williams. It strikes just the right note between the
amateur and the wistful: Its book and lyrics were written by the
estimable Stephen Fry, marvelous actor and wit.</TE>
<TE>   Nesbitt makes a fine leading man, and Plummer misses none of the
amusing nuances of Mortimer, so enchanted by his own creation's being
brought to a somewhat ragged but vigorous life. Williams and others
in key support are also effective. Lightly reflective and
consistently entertaining, "Lucky Break" is an easy-to-take
diversion.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What could be stranger than a movie narrated by a talking fish? How
about a movie that begins with an abortion performed to a cover of
"Good Morning, Starshine"? Better yet, how about both in the same
movie? For those daring enough to take the plunge, that's precisely
what awaits them in the new French Canadian film "Maelstrom," only
the latest in a long line of English- and French-language Canadian
pictures to push the envelope of conventionality.</LD>
<LD>   "When you put a talking fish in your movie, you expect people to
ask you questions about it," jokes the film's writer-director, Denis
Villeneuve. "For me, it was the idea of a narrator that is coming
from another time and space, that has a primitive link with us. The
fish was the most beautiful way of making a link between telling a
story and death." Centering on the emotional odyssey of a young
Montreal woman as she struggles to rebuild her life in the aftermath
of a deadly hit-and-run accident, "Maelstrom" traffics in themes that
are simultaneously dark and redemptive: joy wrought through tragedy,
bliss as a byproduct of agony.</LD>
<TE>   Scenes like "Maelstrom's" abortion sequence, however, are
particularly key to understanding a major difference between
Hollywood and Canadian cinema, a distinction that is rarely made in a
town that prefers to see Canadian films as merely a subset of
American independent cinema. For where Hollywood traditionally sees
horror in the collision of sex and death, Canadian filmmakers find
something provocative, even meaningful.</TE>
<TE>   Films as far-reaching as Atom Egoyan's "The Sweet Hereafter,"
David Cronenberg's "Crash," Denys Arcand's "Love and Human Remains,"
Lynne Stopkewich's necrophilia-themed "Kissed," Mort Ransen's
"Margaret's Museum" and Don McKellar's apocalyptic "Last Night" all
touch, to varying degrees, on similar themes--sex and death, the life
cycle encapsulated in narrative form.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very dark vision. And that has mystified many of us," says
Piers Handling, head of the Toronto International Film Festival. "I
think there's a desire to look below the surface at another reality.
And what they find is disturbing. It's dark. It's sexual. And you
don't typically perceive Canadians as being dark or sexual or
troubled."</TE>
<TE>   Toronto Sun film critic Bruce Kirkland notes, "There's an ennui
about being in a small country that's a flea on the elephant's skin.
It allows you to brood, to be sad in secret, to be obsessed with
things like the reality of life, the reality that there is also death
attached to it. So morbid things are not treated in a morbid way."</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years ago these films and filmmakers might have been
labeled the "Canadian New Wave," if anyone had bothered to recognize
it as such. Today, it stands nameless and unheralded, though the
defining characteristics of this challenging cinematic movement
remain as forceful and unmistakable as ever. Films focus on intensely
humanistic tales marked by dark and morose themes and employ
unconventional narrative structures, depictions of a world in which
life lessons are learned not so much through the Hollywood model of
overcoming adversity as by the Canadian example of staring it
squarely in the face.</TE>
<TE>   Like many national film movements, Canada's was reactionary in
origin, formed in opposition to the constraints of "realist" cinema
that included not only studio movies but also home-grown
documentaries. The so-called tax shelter era of the '70s, when
government incentives helped encourage a stream of cheap Hollywood
knockoffs, proved the last straw.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the true artists that you would consider part of a New
Wave of Canadian cinema are those like David Cronenberg who were
reacting to the tax shelter era, who actually tried to create
something that was personal, individual and idiosyncratic, something
that ran counter to the expectations of commerciality," Kirkland
says.</TE>
<TE>   Handling explains that Quebec cinema was already looking below
surface reality in the '60s because of the French New Wave. "But in
English Canada, we needed a key figure who was going to smash the
idol, to some extent the idol of documentary realist cinema. David
was the one who did that. Even Atom Egoyan admits the influence of
Cronenberg. And the thing to remember is that Cronenberg didn't leave
the country."</TE>
<TE>   The other major hallmark of Canadian cinema has been its
near-total rejection of straightforward narrative. It can be seen in
the brazen non-linearity of virtually all of Egoyan's work, the
twisted surrealism of experimentalists like Guy Maddin and John Paizs
or the labyrinths of interwoven story lines in Jeremy Podeswa's "The
Five Senses" and Francois Girard's "The Red Violin"--a collective,
concerted attempt to both dispose of the old narrative forms and
invent new ones.</TE>
<TE>   Given such a distinctive imprimatur, one might question why more
widespread recognition of Canadian cinema as a movement on par with
the likes of present-day Iranian cinema has proved so elusive. To be
sure, charting the evolution of any film movement is an inexact
science. There exist no fixed criteria or governing body to identify
them as such, only the accumulated acceptance of audiences, festivals
and scholars. Those who have made the cut hold an honored place in
the evolution of the art form--German Expressionism, French New Wave,
Italian Neo-Realism, Britain's Angry Young Men, the Czech and
Japanese New Waves, among others.</TE>
<TE>   But Canadian cinema has struggled for acknowledgement, in part
because even Canadians, despite their support for liberal government
arts funding, have been loath to embrace it, opening the door for the
Hollywood marketing machines.</TE>
<TE>   "Canadian audiences are slaves to American advertising and hype,"
says Kirkland. "And it's puzzling, because they embrace Canadian
music with enthusiasm. When Nelly Furtado wins a Grammy, Canadians
celebrate. And yet we're never proud when a Canadian makes
penetrating cinema that's full of interesting ideas, like Egoyan's
'The Sweet Hereafter.' There's something missing in the Canadian
psyche in terms of embracing Canadian cinema."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, those who have been close to the movement from its
roots defend it on artistic and economic grounds. "I think what these
Canadian films have in common is a realization that to stand out in
the extremely crowded marketplace, the best opportunity was auteur
films," says Robert Lantos, who produced "The Sweet Hereafter" and
"Crash." "What I think distinguishes Canadian film as a movement is
that those who have excelled have had a very unique, personal,
out-of-the-mainstream point of view."</TE>
<TE>   Lantos and his company, Serendipity Point Films, remain important
players in shepherding the work of filmmakers like Bruce McDonald,
whose genre-splicing "Claire's Hat" debuted at last year's Toronto
Film Festival. But Lantos is also representative of what may be the
most significant factor in the seeming invisibility of Canadian
cinema as a movement--its diversity.</TE>
<TE>   Though Canadians often speak of themselves as "two solitudes," a
reference to the cultural divide between the English- and
French-speaking populations, the reality is more complex. Many of the
players are immigrants; Lantos is Hungarian, Egoyan is Egyptian
Armenian, and "Double Happiness" director Mina Shum was born in Hong
Kong. Moreover, the most honored Canadian film of the last year,
director Zacharias Kunuk's "Atanarjuat--The Fast Runner," is Inuit,
the first such film ever made by Native Canadians.</TE>
<TE>   Even those who would be a part of a Canadian New Wave question its
existence. "It's always weird when people talk to me about filmmakers
like Atom Egoyan," says Villeneuve, whose admits that his "Maelstrom"
more closely resembles the magical realism of the late Jean-Claude
Lauzon ("Leolo"). "I admire their work, but I don't know them....
Maybe, truly, there is a Canadian cinema. But here, in Quebec,
they're separate worlds."</TE>
<TE>   Americans, meanwhile, are more likely to see Canada as merely an
awkward appendage to their own world, overlooking the historic film
contributions of Canadians such as Dan Aykroyd, Jim Carrey, Norman
Jewison, James Cameron and "America's Sweetheart" Mary Pickford, even
as they upbraid their northern neighbor for luring so-called "runaway
productions" with tax incentives and lower labor costs. Not that such
attitudes are likely to stem the rising tide of challenging Canadian
movies. In addition to "Maelstrom," "Atanarjuat" and "Claire's Knee,"
American audiences will soon see the release of Egoyan's
much-anticipated "Ararat" as well as the French-language "Soft-Shell
Man," directed by "Maelstrom" cinematographer Andre Turpin.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in the view of observers like Kirkland, recognition from
other countries is ultimately less important than preserving Canada's
cultural diversity, of which its cinema is merely one component.
"That's the paradox of Canadian culture, that it embraces all of
these disparate cultures and ethnic groups and sensibilities and
histories."</TE>

<LD>   CNN's Dobbs Refutes Charges of Bias</LD>
<LD>   CNN financial journalist Lou Dobbs on Thursday denounced as
frivolous complaints voiced in several newspaper articles that past
ties with the Arthur Andersen accounting company create a potential
conflict of interest in his commentaries on the firm.</LD>
<TE>   The host of the nightly financial news program "Moneyline" has
editorialized on his show against the Justice Department's indictment
of Andersen for obstruction of justice. Though people who committed
crimes in the Enron case should be prosecuted, he concedes, innocent
people are being hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Dobbs has acknowledged accepting a speaking fee during an
Andersen-sponsored event and hiring the company as auditor for an
Internet venture he started while on hiatus from CNN. (He gave up his
controlling interest in the company upon rejoining CNN last year.)</TE>
<TE>   Reporters "who don't like my position or want to connect some
rather frivolous and, I think, rather tenuous dots and impugn the
sincerity of my position, I think they're the ones who have something
to answer for, certainly not me," Dobbs said during an appearance on
CNN's "American Morning."</TE>

<TE>   Union Objects to Kirov 'K-19' Soundtrack</TE>
<TE>   The Kirov Orchestra, which appeared at the Kennedy Center in
February, picked up some extra work during its visit--recording the
soundtrack for Paramount's upcoming "K-19: The Widowmaker," starring
Harrison Ford. And, according to the Washington Post, the American
Federation of Musicians is upset.</TE>
<TE>   Union President Thomas Lee wrote a letter to James W. Ziglar,
commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
complaining that the orchestra entered the country "under false
pretenses."</TE>
<TE>   "The Kirov was admitted to the United States expressly as an
accompaniment to opera and ballet performances," Lee wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "They were not admitted to steal work from American recording
musicians, undercut American wages and permit Paramount Pictures to
dodge payroll taxes. If they are going to lie by omission about the
pretense under which they wish to enter this country, then future
entry into this country, by all rights, should be denied them."</TE>
<TE>   Don Franzen, a lawyer acting on behalf of the Kirov, said Thursday
the orchestra disputes the union's allegations.</TE>
<TE>   An INS spokesman said that it would be premature to draw
conclusions without examining "a statutory and case history on the
range of permissible activities for [the Kirov's] type of visa." The
group is scheduled to come to Washington every year for the next
decade.</TE>
<TE>   A Paramount spokesman said the studio was only distributing the
movie and had no part in creative decisions. No one from the
production company could be reached.</TE>

<TE>   AOL Time Warner Execs Top Power List</TE>
<TE>   Despite its plummeting stock price, AOL Time Warner has landed two
executives at the top of the 2002 Power List published in the May
issue of Premiere magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The company's chief executive, Richard Parsons, and chief
operating officer, Robert Pittman, grabbed the spot from last year's
winner, Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone, who is now No. 2. The duo
oversees a vertically integrated media empire that has "crushed the
competition with the sheer weight of its size, synergy and franchise
savvy," the magazine observes.</TE>
<TE>   Others on the list of Hollywood's most influential folks, in
order: Vivendi Universal's Jean-Marie Messier and USA Interactive
Chair Barry Diller; News Corp.'s Rupert Murdoch; Disney chief Michael
Eisner; director Steven Spielberg; Universal Studios President Ron
Meyer and Universal Pictures Chairman Stacey Snider; and Warner Bros.

<TE>   Post-Terrorism Play Headed for Big Screen</TE>
<TE>   "The Guys," a one-act play by Anne Nelson about the aftermath of
the Sept. 11 attacks, will be made into a movie starring Sigourney
Weaver and Anthony LaPaglia.</TE>
<TE>   The project will be directed by Weaver's husband, Jim Simpson, who
also directed a production of the play in New York that originally
starred Weaver and Bill Murray. The story is about a fire captain who
lost eight men in the collapse of the World Trade Center towers and
the editor who helps him write the eulogies he must deliver.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson is a journalism professor who assisted a firefighter in
composing eulogies for the men he lost and, at Simpson's suggestion,

<HD>Confessional Emotion From Joe Henry</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intimate confessions concerning love, desire and revolution dropped
from Joe Henry's lips during his performance at Largo Wednesday, the
first night of a weekly residency. Yet they were not personal
admissions of any sort.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the tunes played like movie shorts from inside the head
of the veteran songwriter, whose critically acclaimed music has
gradually morphed from hushed country-folk to the loop-laden
electro-jazz cabaret of last year's "Scar" album.</LD>
<LD>   For 90 minutes, the singer-guitarist unreeled stark portraits of
characters caught up in or reflecting on odd-to-desperate emotional
situations. Along with material from "Scar" and "Fuse" (1999), he
presented several new songs, including the viscerally romantic "Flesh
and Blood," written for pioneering soul singer Solomon Burke, whose
forthcoming album Henry produced.</LD>
<TE>   "Subtitles help," said the Pasadena-based musician before
explaining the plot of "This Afternoon," a new number about a Cuban
boy entertaining tourists on the cusp of Castro's 1959 takeover.</TE>
<TE>   Though his stellar band could not reproduce all the subtleties of
the recordings, the players carefully crafted a sensual, generally
languorous sound that ebbed and flowed from torchy soul to an almost
Velvet Underground gurgle.</TE>
<TE>   But the most distinctive instrument was Henry's voice, a
conversational velvet rasp he played the way a jazz musician uses his
horn. Crisply clipping off phrases or forcefully spitting out words,
he enunciated pain, hope and need with clarity. You didn't need
subtitles to understand the feelings.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Henry at Largo, 432 N. Fairfax Ave., L.A. Wednesday and April
17, 9 p.m. $15. (323) 852-1073.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only 13 months ago, Bart Exposito made his L.A. solo debut with a
series of promising paintings that appeared to be the love children
of streamlined RVs and old-fashioned TVs. Rendered with the steady
hand of a sign painter, these goofy fusions of abstraction and
representation also added a touch of Sputnik clunkiness and a slap of
skateboarder verve to their hard-edged shapes, whose homey futurism
matched that of the Jetsons. At once charming and cheeky, Exposito's
crisp images had one foot firmly planted in the world of playful
self-effacement and the other in that of big, bold ambitions.</LD>
<LD>   At Daniel Weinberg Gallery, a beautifully installed group of new
works on canvas and paper by the 31-year-old artist makes last year's
paintings look like 5-year-old computer technology--fine for its
time, but unbelievably plodding and crude when compared to the
up-to-the-minute stuff that's available today.</LD>
<LD>   It's thrilling to see an artist advance so dramatically. Gone are
the gimmicks Exposito had used to disguise his paintings as
multi-panel props and 3-D installations. No bet-hedging
indecisiveness bogs down his increasingly confident images, which are
consummately composed, in both senses of the term.</LD>
<TE>   Pictorially they are organized with an eye toward maximum
efficiency. Exposito compresses loads of visual energy into flat,
evenly painted pictures, carefully calibrating subtle color shifts
and high-keyed accents to intensify their vitality.</TE>
<TE>   Linear elements often echo one another, creating jittery movements
and spinning sensations. Although straight lines define the contours
of nearly all of the modular shapes in these clean paintings, there's
not a right angle to be found.</TE>
<TE>   Out-of-whack geometry is Exposito's specialty. It allows him to
push asymmetrical formats and radically skewed setups to such
extremes that the results look graceful, amazingly contained despite
the loopy idiosyncrasies of their simple, sometimes lumpy components.</TE>
<TE>   The rounded corners of Exposito's multi-sided shapes suggest the
user-friendliness of ergonomically designed appliances. They also
recall works by Philip Argent, Casey Cook and Stephen Heer,
contemporaries who are also making paintings that put some kick back
into the phrase "new and improved."</TE>
<TE>   The compositional sophistication of Exposito's art is not merely
formal. It is matched by a sense of emotional composure. Intellectual
refinement and tasteful restraint are evident in the decisions that
determine each piece's scale, palette, structure and rhythm. At once
mature and spunky, elegant and fun-loving, Exposito's paintings make
a virtue of immediate gratification by making its satisfactions last
a lot longer than usual--well into the future.</TE>

<TE>   Calame Finds Beauty Where Others See Grunge</TE>
<TE>   The system Ingrid Calame uses to make her paintings has not
changed since she began exhibiting in 1994. She still traces stains
from the street and sidewalk onto sheets of translucent Mylar,
overlaps them to form dense linear patterns and transfers these messy
networks to square aluminum panels. The L.A. painter then fills in
the actual-size silhouettes with industrial-strength coats of enamel,
creating broken rainbows whose jarring color combinations have a
noxious beauty that is not for the fainthearted.</TE>
<TE>   What has changed is the look of Calame's art. At Karyn Lovegrove
Gallery, a dozen 2-foot-square panels are significantly more
pictorial than any of her previous works. In other words, each
looks--and behaves--more like a painting than a found object.</TE>
<TE>   The installation highlights this transformation. Beginning in the
entryway and ringing the main gallery, the sequence formed by
Calame's panels recalls the frames of a comic strip. (Her titles,
"V-E-E-Uuww!" "ka-KINK-kun" and "cgup, cgup, cgup, cgup," for
example, function onomatopoetically, like the words that punctuate
action-packed scenes.) You look at the jampacked paintings in search
of a narrative.</TE>
<TE>   But there's no continuity from one to the next. Each concrete
abstraction has the presence of a fantastic 3-D map of a universe, in
which accidents and intentions intermingle more promiscuously than
usual. With no key or guide, you must navigate the dizzying spaces of
Calame's paintings by the seat of your pants, making up your own
rules as clues accumulate.</TE>
<TE>   The stains Calame has traced are more painstakingly detailed than
before. Many have the lacy delicacy and meticulous filigree of
elaborate ornamentation. Their edges are more jagged; sharp,
saw-toothed shapes predominate, and thin splinters resemble shards of
shattered glass. Some seem to be rendered at microscopic scale. The
most complicated are represented by dozens of tiny fragments, all
painted the same synthetic shade.</TE>
<TE>   Although a Luddite would approve of the low-tech, handmade
simplicity of Calame's labor-intensive works, their zigzagged
contours recall digitally transmitted enlargements, which depict
curved lines as right-angled steps. This gives her shapes the
presence of paper cutouts, the best of which evoke Alex Katz's early
collages and Henri Matisse's late masterpieces.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's absurd to think of some of the splotches and spills
that collect on the ground all over the city as being more
sophisticated than others, that's exactly what Calame's paintings
demand. A connoisseur of the marks made by the gunk and crud of
mundane mishaps, she resurrects the ghostly traces of only the most
attractive accidents.</TE>
<TE>   The beauty Calame captures resides in the irregular--in misfits,
exceptions and extremes. Although she begins with the grunge everyone
walks across without giving it a second thought, she selects, edits
and composes so effectively that the results invite viewers into a
world of perverse refinement and unexpected delight.</TE>

<TE>   Schnabel's Series Oversize, Overblown</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s, Jim Shaw organized "Thrift Store Paintings," an
exhibition of amateur artists' works he had purchased in secondhand
stores. In the early 1990s, Charles Ray made a series of oversize
female manikins, whose power to dwarf viewers increased as you
approached them. Robert Therrien's gigantic dining room set from 1994
shrunk viewers even further, transforming the ordinary world into a
playground for the imagination.</TE>
<TE>   Julian Schnabel's new series of 13 "Big Girl Paintings,"
simultaneously on view at Gagosian Gallery's Beverly Hills and
Manhattan branches, brings these works to mind, along with those of
several other contemporary artists from whom the New York painter
borrows a bit too freely for his own good.</TE>
<TE>   Each of Schnabel's six pictures in Beverly Hills covers between 75
and 90 square feet of canvas. This is about 35 to 40 times the size
of the modest painting that inspired them, a straightforward portrait
of a young blond woman wearing what appears to be a high school
uniform. (Some of the paintings in New York are even bigger,
measuring in at 166 square feet.)</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, Schnabel purchased the original portrait, signed by D.
Childress, in a Houston junk shop. Loading his own brush with purple
pigment, he laid a long brushstroke over the eyes of its now
anonymous sitter and added a few signature blobs, most notably a
finger-like shape that curls suggestively toward her neck.</TE>
<TE>   His new paintings, in weighty, specially made frames modeled on
those found in make-your-own frame shops, are overblown copies of his
retouched version of Childress' picture. Formally, they recall a
series of collages by Robert Heinecken, in which black rectangles
block out the subjects' eyes. They also evoke John Baldessari's
brightly colored dots, which cover people's faces in his recycled
images.</TE>
<TE>   As a group, Schnabel's paintings mimic Amy Adler's photographed
drawings, serial works that much more effectively emphasize the
significance of slight variations amid seeming similarity. As for
paint-handling, Schnabel adds nothing to the repertoire of gestural
realism that isn't given more punch by any number of painters,
including Roger Herman and John Sonsini.</TE>
<TE>   The Sunday-painter naivete that gives Childress' little picture
its charm is no mask for Schnabel's disingenuousness.</TE>

<TE>   Alexander: Sculpture as Popular Entertainment</TE>
<TE>   Andy Alexander's "Light as a Feather, Stiff as a Board" builds
upon the rapidly evolving genre of landscape sculpture. At China Art
Objects Galleries, the young artist's single piece is a diorama
builder's fantasy: an approximately 8-by-4-foot chunk of the
countryside so filled with highlights that the real thing pales in
comparison.</TE>
<TE>   Combining Ouija-board mysticism and horror movie theatrics with
just the right touch of narcissistic self-involvement, this
tricked-out sculpture features leafless trees (whose limbs writhe
anthropomorphically), rolling hills (which trace the shape of the
artist's supine body), and a red Plexiglas river (which snakes,
vein-like, through twisted gullies). Set on a light-box that
functions as a low pedestal, Alexander's playful self-portrait is
awash in a rosy glow. Its atmosphere is sexy, schlocky, hellish and
right on the money.</TE>
<TE>   A movie camera, cast from amber-tinted resin, rises like a full
moon from the hill under which Alexander's head appears to be buried.</TE>
<TE>   Embedded on the hill's other side, right where his cranium would
be, is a small monitor. It plays a looped snippet of "Evil Dead II,"
whose soundtrack fills the gallery with eerie music.</TE>
<TE>   Embracing artifice as if there'd be no tomorrow without it,
Alexander's sculpture demonstrates that popular entertainment is not
art's enemy.</TE>
<TE>   His only goal is to create a multilayered object that worms its
way into your imagination. When that happens, there's no telling what
comes next.</TE>
<TE>   China Art Objects Galleries, 933 Chung King Road, Chinatown, (213)
613-0384, through April 27. Closed Sunday through Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>The Good Old, Bad Old Days</HD>
<DH>With its gross-out gags, 'Van Wilder' resurrects the
slapstick antics of the 'Animal House' era.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE SEYMOUR</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I guess it all depends on when you turn 24. Once you pass that
barrier, sight gags about bodily fluids and sphincter discharges
begin to lose their--what is the word?--resonance. Still, the makers
of such touchstones of gross-out-low-life-dirt-bag American slapstick
as "National Lampoon's Animal House" (1978) and "Caddyshack" (1980)
are pretty good about sending you on your way with enough awful
memories and snappy insults to sustain you well past your first
career humiliation.</LD>
<LD>   "National Lampoon's Van Wilder" fulfills this mandate, but barely.
Those 24-and-unders who are looking for their own "Caddyshack" to
adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep looking, if only
because they've probably become inured to the shock of seeing
alcohol-induced vomit flying out of school bus windows. In these
reined-in days of safe sex and bottled water, the knockabout excesses
of "Animal House" now seem Elizabethan when compared with the uplift
of a "Shallow Hal" or the mealy-mouthed sentimentality of "American
Pie."</LD>
<TE>   Maybe that's why, intermingled with the stench of secreted fluids
of various kinds (and from various animals), there's an aura of
golden-oldie nostalgia permeating this tale of an enterprising,
laid-back trickster named Van Wilder (Ryan Reynolds) who's happily in
his seventh year of undergraduate studies at mythical Coolidge
College. Being in college is more than a journey to Van, it's a
career. That is, until his rich and apparently absent-minded dad (Tim
Matheson, playing father to the kind of hipster he played in "Animal
House") decides to withhold his tuition payment.</TE>
<TE>   Van must use all his charm, wit and mental agility to raise funds
for his continued enrollment and to fend off a solemn student
newspaper reporter (Tara Reid, delivering the minimum daily
requirement of avidity) who's out to deflate his status as Coolidge's
800-pound party gorilla. Naturally, Van digs her blue eyes and wants
nothing more than to steal her from the standard fraternity
fascist-achiever Richard Bagg (Daniel Cosgrove) who wants to make her
his trophy wife.</TE>
<TE>   Roughhouse scatology is piled on like players in a rugby
scrimmage. Van's supernaturally endowed bulldog figures prominently
in one gag involving eclairs and Bagg's frat house. As someone who's
at least 2-times- 24, I preferred the exchange in which Van's
henchman Hutch (Teck Holmes) suggests medical attention may be needed
to "fix" the dog. To which Van suavely replies, "That's up to him."</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds delivers these and other lines well enough to make you
want to see him in something that doesn't require cleaning up
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong sexual content, gross humor, language
and some drug content. Times guidelines: Way too coarse for children.
As for teens: You'd definitely prefer they didn't see it, but you may
have a hard time stopping them.</TE>

<HD>Bermingham Gives Many Voices to 'Non-Vital Organs'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daryl H. Miller, Philip Brandes</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First, there was the synthesizer, threatening pit musicians' jobs.
Now comes a sound-mimicking machine capable of supplanting whole
rosters of actors.</LD>
<LD>   She is Gigi Bermingham, able to reproduce all manner of regional
accents, as well as impersonate singers ranging from Julie Andrews to
Cher. And, get this: Once she has introduced several such characters,
she can deftly shift from voice to voice, so that they talk to one
another.</LD>
<LD>   To demonstrate these talents, Bermingham has written an amusing
character study called "Non-Vital Organs," based on a story by her
and Diana Hamann. She performs it solo in a City Stage presentation
at the Hudson Guild Theatre in Hollywood. Well, almost solo. Fellow
actor D.K. Pierce also provides vocal effects (yapping dog,
whimpering baby, etc.) from just offstage.</LD>
<TE>   Bermingham's central creation is the talkative, animated Darlene
Michaels, whose colorful past is revealed through interactions with
other characters. These include Sarah Pritchard, a British expatriate
and wealthy singing coach to the stars, who is Darlene's employer and
surrogate mother; Genevieve Lapompette, Sarah's French maid; and
Brandi Smolenski, a flirtatious expectant mother who speaks with a
New Jersey whine.</TE>
<TE>   Among the bombshells: The aged, tart-tongued Sarah explains that
her first glimpse of Darlene--at the time a prostitute and inhalant
addict--came as the younger woman was looking up from an open can of
paint. "There was a white circle on her face, like a fallen halo,"
Sarah recalls, in one of many sharply written lines.</TE>
<TE>   The characters have self-revelatory moments, too, as when the
put-upon French maid--who is forever harried by Sarah's attacking
Shih Tzu--is given a moment's reprieve to sing a deeply felt
rendition of "La Vie en Rose," delivered in a dead-on Edith Piaf
vibrato, while Kathi O'Donohue's lights turn the scene appropriately
rose-colored.</TE>
<TE>   The story isn't terribly weighty, but it delivers some nice
thoughts about nurturing instincts and the need for connection.
Pierce's contributions, along with atmospheric effects by sound
designer Bob Blackburn, are deftly woven together with Bermingham's
multiple personalities, under Richard Kuhlman's direction.
Christopher Michaels' set design, with its well-stocked knickknack

<TE>   A Thought-Provoking  'Talented Tenth'</TE>
<TE>   A personal midlife crisis parallels a cultural one in Richard
Wesley's "The Talented Tenth," as a successful black businessman
begins to question his aspirations in much the way that the larger
African American community has been reevaluating its own goals after
the civil rights era.</TE>
<TE>   Wesley gives theatergoers a lot to think about--so much, in fact,
that one begins to worry that he's trying to compress a whole social
history course into one sitting. But this material comes alive when
acted well, as it was in a 1997 production in Hollywood that featured
Robert Guillaume.</TE>
<TE>   It pulses once again in a production at 4305 Village Theatre in
Leimert Park, directed by Claudette Roche, who was executive producer
of the '97 show, as well as an actor in it. The theater, open for a
year now, is advancing into the arena of Actors' Equity Assn. 99-seat
productions with this show.</TE>
<TE>   The years advance from the 1960s to 1990 as Bernard (Basil
Wallace) transitions from a life of political activism at Howard
University to an increasingly comfortable existence as an executive
with a small chain of radio stations. Then, out of the blue, a larger
chain comes along to swallow his company, just as he also nears a
crisis in his marriage to Pam (Cynda Williams-Plummer).</TE>
<TE>   Bernard's response to these challenges isn't always constructive.
Indeed, he sometimes seems determined to lay waste to everything
around him, including his affair with the younger Tanya (Karen Malina
White) and his long-standing friendships with fellow Howard grads Ron
(M. Darnell Suttles), Marvin (Andre Mayers) and Rowena (Shelley
Robertson).</TE>
<TE>   Time shifts aren't always clear in Roche's staging, but she does a
fine job of re-creating real life. Time and again, an actor's
response to a situation is so true that the audience laughs with
recognition.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the script resolves Bernard's crises before convincing
us he's really learned anything from them. But Wesley's message comes
through loud and clear: Keep building on success, rather than
settling for what has been accomplished already.</TE>

<TE>   'Joleta' Reveals a Family's Secrets</TE>
<TE>   Marrying plot intricacies worthy of Jane Austen and the emotional
expressiveness of contemporary African American voices, Harriet A.
Dickey's "Joleta" at the Stella Adler Theatre proves a gripping,
tightly scripted generational saga about a family uncovering dark
secrets in its painful history.</TE>
<TE>   As in previous stagings, this revival of the Towne Street
Theatre's popular production sports different casts on alternating
weekends (most of the actors are veterans of the show). Clear,
insightful direction by Nancy Cheryll Davis-Bellamy emphasizes
stereotype-free characters, no matter which cast you end up seeing.
In addition to its fine ensemble performances, Dickey's play spins a
suspenseful yarn.</TE>
<TE>   Sparks fly when a present-day reunion brings four sisters back to
their parents' uneasy household, where their gravely ill mother
(Michelle Davison) quietly agonizes over her missed opportunities. A
bad decision in her youth trapped her in a loveless marriage to an
egotistic blowhard (Lou Beatty Jr.). His less glamorous brother
(Vincent Isaac), who truly loved her, ended up in prison for murder.</TE>
<TE>   The daughters' long-simmering suspicions about their paternity
come to a boil with the homecoming of their paroled uncle. Smoothly
crafted flashbacks re-create their mother's tortured confession, in
which the fates of the younger incarnations of this triangle (Dalila
Brown-Geiger, Trevor Gordon and William L. Johnson) are shaped by the
wiles of the uncle's conniving ex-wife, Joleta (Lira Angel).</TE>
<TE>   In the ensuing moral quagmire of fidelity, skin color, work
ethics, and passion, pent-up skeletons practically cascade from the
closet, but the production's focus on believable, emotionally honest
performances keeps melodrama at bay.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While it may be true that you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's
ear, tonight's Disney Channel movie "Tru Confessions" proves that it
is possible to reverse the process (8 p.m.).</LD>
<LD>   Based on the award-winning children's book of the same name by
Janet Tashjian, the movie manages to trivialize and trample the 1997
work's delicate themes of living with a developmentally disabled
family member.</LD>
<LD>   Trudy "Tru" Walker (Clara Bryant) is a self-absorbed high school
freshman whose irritation with her father (William Francis McGuire),
mother (Mare Winningham) and twin brother Eddie (Shia LaBeouf)
provides the sour centerpiece to the movie.</LD>
<TE>   Eddie, whose disabilities were caused by being deprived of oxygen
for a crucial few minutes at birth, is portrayed as an exuberant
puppy of a lad whose clumsy antics, crying jags and loud outbursts
exasperate the household. Nearly every scene involving him ends in
anger and harsh words. But Tru and her parents are ultimately too
involved with their own lives to dwell too long on the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Then a video contest is announced by a local cable station, and
Tru sees it as a way of furthering her career plans for becoming a TV
personality. The fact that Eddie's plight will be the focal point
seems almost an afterthought. This is a steep departure from the
book, in which the project was also seen as a means of bringing
awareness and added research to developmental disabilities. This Tru
is more worried about her classmates' reaction to the video.</TE>
<TE>   From the tinkling piano that accompanies what pass for
introspective moments to the shallow burst of enlightenment at the
end that attempts to pave over the wall-to-wall unpleasantness that
has gone before, "Tru" simply rings false.</TE>

<HD>Solid Cast Soldiers On, Fighting a Losing Battle in 'High
Crimes'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Films about women in a whole lot of trouble must be making a whole
lot of money because here's another one. They don't all star Ashley
Judd, but after "Kiss the Girls," "Double Jeopardy" and now "High
Crimes," it's starting to seem that way.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that Judd, who has a knack for spunky vulnerability,
hasn't done good work in these films. Or that Morgan Freeman, her
co-star here and in "Kiss the Girls," isn't one of the acting wonders
of our world. Or that director Carl Franklin, whose films include
"One False Move" and "Devil in a Blue Dress," doesn't have a gift for
involving, character-driven thrillers.</LD>
<LD>   The problem with "High Crimes," acceptable though it is, is that
it's not close to anyone's best work. The generic nature of the
material seems to have defeated all comers, making it difficult for
the participants to fully engage in the task at hand. Given the
talent involved, there are of course segments that hold our interest,
but the spark, the magic is not there often enough.</LD>
<TE>   "High Crimes" is adapted (by Yuri Zeltser &amp; Carey Bickley) from a
successful thriller by Joseph Finder, and perhaps that is one reason
for its shortcomings. The film turns out to have an almost limitless
supply of false alarms, red herrings, reversals of expectations and
plot twists that are not as surprising as they should be. Perhaps
these played well on the page, but here they tend to feel overly
familiar.</TE>
<TE>   That description especially fits the opening gambit of a young
married couple so blissfully, down-to-their-toes happy that you know
as well as you know your own name that it is not going to last. Meet
Marin County lovebirds Claire and Tom Kubik (Judd and Jim Caviezel).</TE>
<TE>   While Tom does some unspecified work with his hands, Claire is a
successful attorney, a zealot for the causes she believes in, which
include defending the rights of the accused. "We are all at risk,"
she is fond of saying, "until justice is redressed."</TE>
<TE>   This Bay Area fantasy life is shattered when, in a major display
of force, the FBI arrests Kubik and whisks him off to a Marine base
in the mythical Southern California city of San Lazaro. Not an
attorney for nothing, Claire flies down to spring her man, but she is
in for rather a large shock.</TE>
<TE>   It seems Tom Kubik is not really Tom Kubik. He's Ron Chapman, a
former covert Marine Corps operative who's going to be charged in
military court with killing nine people in an incident in El Salvador
15 years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Tom/Ron (a typical Caviezel role that calls for the actor to look
lost and haunted) insists that it's all a mistake; not only is he
innocent, he's being framed to take the fall for some powerful
higher-ups. What's a girl to do?</TE>
<TE>   After some run-ins with obdurate military types and after meeting
the inexperienced attorney assigned to defend her husband (Adam
Scott), Claire knows she needs "someone who's beaten the Marine Corps
before and is hungry to beat them again."</TE>
<TE>   That would be motorcycle-riding, earring-wearing,
prostitute-defending, recently sober Charlie Grimes.</TE>
<TE>   Casting Freeman as Grimes is as good a move as "High Crimes"
makes. Acting can't be as easy as watching Freeman makes it appear,
but his effortlessly engaging performance as the man who reminds
exasperated civilian Claire of the old saw that "military justice is
to justice what military music is to music" is this film's main
attraction.</TE>
<TE>   The same can't be said for the role of Jackie (Amanda Peet), the
tiresomely flaky sister who's pretty much standard issue for
high-powered attorneys. Claire and phone psychic Jackie have been
estranged for years, and she's such a continual irritant it's easy to
see why. Intended as comic relief in a film that would be better
without it, Jackie ends up loosening the tension in a project that is
already not as tight as it needs to be. It's not more humor that's
needed in "High Crimes," it's more focus.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for violence, sexual content and language.
Times guidelines: beatings, murders and risque material.</TE>

<HD>Talk About Alienation</HD>
<DH>A baffling stage update of 'The Graduate,' that classic
movie about 1960s angst, fails to connect. But sales are brisk,
thanks to its movie-star cast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA WINER</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--Whatever the reason for a Broadway adaptation of "The
Graduate"....</LD>
<LD>   Oh, never mind. There simply is no reason.</LD>
<LD>   An icon is shattering at the Plymouth Theatre. And, as it turns
out, the sound it makes is not a bang or a whimper or even the
wistful sound of silence. Instead, Terry Johnson's schlocky stage
version of the 1967 zeitgeist movie classic opened Thursday after two
befuddling years in London, and the only sound that registers is the
dispiriting clang from $5.3 million--the largest advance sale for a
straight play in Broadway history.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, Kathleen Turner, still game at 47, drops her towel for a few
long seconds to reveal the importance of careful lighting from
behind. For all the skin, however, there is not a moment when this
tough trucker of a Mrs. Robinson suggests how it felt when Anne
Bancroft got emotionally naked for America.</TE>
<TE>   Don't be fooled. My incredulity here has nothing--or next to
nothing--to do with boomer nostalgia and panic over revisionist
cultural history. The producers and Johnson, who also directs, have
come up with a brilliant cross-generational casting formula that
plays on an older generation's fantasies of Jessica Rabbit's voice
and Turner's legs in their 1981 "Body Heat" debut.</TE>
<TE>   Turner kicked off the London cavalcade of female grown-ups wanting
to expose their physical resiliency in the role. In addition, there
is the genuine appeal of Jason Biggs--most memorably seen having his
way with baked goods in "American Pie"--as Benjamin Braddock, the
role that identified both the youthful Dustin Hoffman and youthful
alienation as marketable standards. Add Alicia Silverstone, the
adorably petulant Cher in "Clueless," as Elaine Robinson, and "The
Graduate" should not be so last-century anymore.</TE>
<TE>   But what, then, is it? Try boring. And pointless. Johnson,
plucking plot from the movie and from Charles Webb's novel, jerks us
around from farce to soaper to slapstick to romantic comedy until
theatergoers with a weakness for coherence and consistency of style
may justifiably sue for whiplash. Rob Howell's set is a sophisticated
concept involving double-decker blond-wood shutters, and his
costumes, including hairstyles, avoid being '60s cartoons.</TE>
<TE>   For cartoons, we have the characters--such chipper bubbleheads as
Benjamin's mother (Kate Skinner), who squeaks, "I read in the Digest
that young people are disillusioned." After Benjamin's affair with
his parents' friend comes out, we get a family therapy session in
which Benjamin throws a beanbag chair on the head of the hippy
shrink.</TE>
<TE>   You following this? After a while--and the first act feels long
enough to age a generation--we begin to recognize the genius of the
Mike Nichols-Buck Henry film, which told us everything on the basis
of a meticulously selected minimum of scenes. Johnson fills in the
scenes with conversation and, surprise, the people are not merely
unbelievable but incredibly dull.</TE>
<TE>   Biggs is an admirable combination of nerdy and curious, but the
world he rejects is not the rich, sleek Los Angeles that nailed a
growing anti-materialistic sentiment. These families are pretty tacky
in their luxuries, so pathetic that rebellion lacks gravity. There is
so little weight in the drama that Elaine and her mother get
cutesy-drunk together after the revelation, and when Benjamin tells
Elaine that her mother actually seduced him, Silverstone stomps her
little feet, waves her little fists and throws herself on his bed as
if told she couldn't go to the prom.</TE>
<TE>   As anyone knows who saw Turner in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" or
"Indiscretions" on Broadway in the '90s, she is at least as much a
Broadway stage creature as a movie star. She has one of those
look-at-me, confident qualities that dares you to doubt her. We don't
blame her for trying to find a Mrs. Robinson other than the slinky,
elegant Bancroft, but this blowsy, common version drains the
liberating joy from the inappropriate affair.</TE>
<TE>   And about that nudity. If, indeed, it is essential to the
verisimilitude of the material, then why does Benjamin wear his
undershorts during hot scenes in the sheets? And who hails a taxi in
L.A.? And who needs other pop songs when you have Simon and
Garfunkel? In 1967, it seemed "The Graduate" was about Benjamin.
Years later, it was hard not to care more about Mrs. Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   But this thing on Broadway isn't about anybody or anything--unless
the box office counts.</TE>

<LD>"Graydon wanted to call it a 'Bob-umentary,'" said producer Robert
Evans, with his characteristic dark diction. Evans was talking about
the movie chronicling his life, titled "The Kid Stays in the Picture"
after his 1994 memoir of that name. And the Graydon in question would
be Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, who produced the movie,
which will be released in June.</LD>
<LD>   "You've never seen anything like it," the 71-year-old Evans
promised. "It's not a documentary. It's a performance piece."</LD>
<LD>   Over lunch on a recent afternoon, Evans told stories from his life
as he paced the floor, not touching his poached salmon salad, which
had been served on a table in the screening room of his Beverly Hills
home.</LD>
<TE>   Behind him, quilted on a pillow, was the credo "Rejection leads to
obsession."</TE>
<TE>   The pool, into which a clothed Ali MacGraw famously jumped shortly
before becoming his third wife, could be glimpsed through the glass
doors.</TE>
<TE>   Evans avoided indexing his memoir, he said, "so people couldn't
buy the book and look for their names." Still, the book, and Evans'
six-hour narration of it on audio tapes, got quite the response.
"Roman Polanski called six months ago from Paris: 'I'm listening to
your tape and laughing so hard I crashed into a tree.'"</TE>
<TE>   Evans also recounted how he went from millionaire to having only
$37 to his name.</TE>
<TE>   "That's been my life," he added by way of explanation. "Money
never mattered." But with the book, the tapes, and now the movie,
things have improved a bit, he acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   And now there's another project in the works: a second installment
of his autobiography.</TE>
<TE>   The new book, originally titled "Seduction," was renamed "The Fat
Lady Sang," and begins with Evans' stroke in 1998 as he toasted
director Wes Craven at his house.</TE>
<TE>   Again, he's picked up the "comeback" theme.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been counted out [many times]," he said, adding that he went
from "royalty to infamy" in his career. "I've been used and abused."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, there has been plenty of drama on the stage that is
Evans' life.</TE>
<TE>   He was discovered poolside by actress Norma Shearer in the 1950s
at the Beverly Hills Hotel, and went from hotel guest to actor to a
head of Paramount Pictures, where he green-lighted such movies as
"Rosemary's Baby," "Love Story," "Harold and Maude," and "The
Godfather" in the late 1960s and early 1970s. As a producer, he made
"Chinatown" and "Marathon Man," among others.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the 1980s, came a fall from grace when he was linked
through a business partner to the notorious "Cotton Club" murder
case, involving the 1983 slaying of New York impresario Roy Radin.
Evans was never indicted.</TE>
<TE>   "It goes beyond any fictional drama," he said of his life.</TE>
<TE>   "People didn't think I had the [guts] to fight back." But, he
said, "I haven't been afraid of anything."</TE>

<TE>   Fleiss a Would-Be Auction Hero</TE>
<TE>   Heidi Fleiss is once more teetering on the edge of the
fund-raising auction block, this time for the Junior League of
Pasadena. According to Fleiss, the plan is to offer dinner with her
and boyfriend Tom Sizemore to the highest bidder. But league
president Carrie Rabkin says the couple's involvement in the April 13
fund-raiser is still pending. "We have no ... paperwork from her,"
Rabkin said Thursday. "At this point, I don't see her as being an
auction item."</TE>
<TE>   Accounts differ about how Fleiss connected with the Junior League.
Rabkin says Fleiss called the league to offer herself as an auction
item. Fleiss says the league contacted her, and promised paperwork
that never arrived. This is the second time recently that the former
Hollywood madam has been considered as an auction prize. In February,
a Los Angeles-area Catholic high school announced (prematurely) that
dinner with Fleiss and Sizemore would be a top auction prize at its
fund-raiser. The school's principal nixed the plan days later, after
it raised concerns among parents as well as officials at the Los
Angeles Archdiocese. (The school must remain unnamed to protect the
innocent.)</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe this," says Fleiss. "I didn't know I was in such
demand! I guess it was the rejection that created a bit of a buzz."</TE>
<TE>   At a separate fund-raiser on Saturday, a brush with royalty will
be the prize. Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, has donated an
auction item for the John Wayne Cancer Institute Auxiliary's Odyssey
Ball: an opportunity for eight people to join her for tea at the
Regent Beverly Wilshire hotel.</TE>

<HD>Mideast Strife's Long Reach</HD>
<DH>Fear, anger envelop U.S. relatives of Israel, West Bank
residents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been at least two weeks since Bajis Dodin slept through the
night. Where once he might have watched a television show or read a
book before he and his wife turned out the light, now he watches the
news, in Arabic and English, flipping through the channels for hours.
Then he lies awake, staring into the dark, searching his soul for
hope.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes he picks up the telephone and dials the numbers he knows
by heart, trying again to get through to his brother, his sister, his
uncles and cousins who live in towns on the West Bank. Many nights
the phones are down, but they are the only link left. A letter can
take months, and it has been days since Dodin was able to communicate
by e-mail--very few Palestinian homes, he said, have electricity
anymore.</LD>
<LD>   In the morning, only the sky over his Riverside home has
lightened. Dodin's thoughts remain weighted with worry, for his
elderly mother and the rest of his family who, he said, struggle to
procure the bare necessities for survival--food, water, shelter from
the fighting. He has tried to send them money; he has tried to get
many of them out. Nothing, he said, has worked.</LD>
<TE>   Peace between Palestinians and Israelis has often been tenuous and
bloody conflict not extraordinary. But never has the region known a
time like this; in the last two weeks, Arab suicide bombers have
killed and maimed on an almost daily basis, Israeli soldiers and
tanks have demolished buildings and opened fire on crowds, and every
day brings death to both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Southern Californians have families living in the
cities and settlements of Israel and the West Bank. From across an
ocean and a continent, they have watched and prayed for a solution
when none seems forthcoming. Their reactions, no matter what side
they're on, are remarkably similar: anger and fear; frustration--with
the warring factions, with the U.S. government, with the media;
depression bordering on despair and, of course, exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot concentrate," Dodin said. "I cannot think. I am strained
always, tense and nervous. I try to keep away from my family, from
even my children so not to take out my anger on them. It is a
nightmare. I do not see an end."</TE>
<TE>   In a house in Irvine, sleep is also elusive. Beverly Jacobs
e-mails her daughter, Rachel Jacobson, trying not to ask the
questions that roil in the vivid dark. The 14-year-old son of Jacobs'
cousin was recently outside a restaurant when an Arab shot an Israeli
Jew; the boy took cover and called his parents on the cell phone,
asking what he should do.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a call a mother should ever get," said Jacobs. It is
the call she hopes she never gets. For seven years now, Jacobson and
her husband have lived in Israel; their 2-year-old was born there.
There is a second child on the way. Every day, Jacobson drives half
an hour to her job as an art therapist in a Jerusalem hospital; every
day, Jacobs worries that her daughter's car will break down or she'll
get a flat tire or something will happen to isolate her, to keep her
from getting to her home and child.</TE>
<TE>   "She told me the other day, something was wrong with one of the
wheels, and I said, 'You have to get that fixed, right away, right
away, ' and she said, 'Yes, Mother, we know that.'"</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs would like her daughter to come home, at least for a while,
but she knows better than to say such a thing--for Jacobson, Israel
is home. And so Jacobs confines her conversation to everyday things.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter is trying to live her life without letting events
interfere," Jacobs said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been calling more often than usual, but we really make an
effort to make the conversation as normal as possible, which is very
hard."</TE>
<TE>   "Every morning you wake up and it's like a lottery," said Yuval
Rotem, the L.A. consul general of Israel. "Who will be hit? What will
have happened? Every morning, I check into the Internet. If there's a
story close to Tel Aviv [where his parents and sister live], I call.
If it's Jerusalem, where my friends from the foreign service live, I
call. Every day I call. It is a constant toll of anxiety and fear,
especially for those of us over here."</TE>
<TE>   Rotem has been in Los Angeles for 21/2 years. It is his second
stint in the U.S.; he was serving in the consulate in New York during
the Gulf War, which he said was also very difficult.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, the events of the past few weeks have been
unprecedented. The killings that occurred during Passover, he said,
marked a shift in the reactions of the Jewish community. "Before,
there was the belief that they would not touch holy days," he said.
"Then the line was crossed."</TE>
<TE>   A little more than a month before the holy days began, Barry Weiss
and his wife had decided not to spend Passover in Israel as they have
for the past several years. And even when events tragically proved
their decision wise, they remained torn. "The emotional side says,
'Why aren't we there?' and the sensible side says, 'We've got three
children, there are no safe places, it isn't reasonable.'"</TE>
<TE>   Many members of Weiss' wife's family immigrated to Israel in the
mid-'80s, and the family has suffered injury and loss in the
conflict. Last year, a rock was thrown through the windshield of a
cousin's car, killing their 4-month-old baby. Last week, another
cousin was injured in one bombing; another attack in a shopping mall
killed family friends and neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't go an hour without checking in by phone or Internet,"
Weiss said. "It's much more nerve-racking than a military conflict.
These are aimed at civilians."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he and his wife try to do what they can to help from
their home in  West Hollywood. "We try to fill in the gaps of worry
with charity and prayer; we do what we can on a political action
level, to get information out so people know what's happening."</TE>
<TE>   For Palestinian Americans, the fear and the resolution are the
same, but the anger and frustration have an extra level.</TE>
<TE>   "My family is under occupation, and they are resisting
occupation," said Dodin. "Their lives are hell. They can't drive on
the roads; their kids can't go to school; they have no lights; they
have to get their water in small buckets; they go to sleep with a
tank in front of their house; they wake up with a tank in front of
their house. But then we hear from the media that Israel is under
siege."</TE>
<TE>   When friends and colleagues ask how he is coping, he said, they
don't really want to hear what is happening. And when they do express
their support or outrage, they will only do it in whispers. "Everyone
is afraid to show support of the Palestinian people because then they
will be branded anti-Semitic. People tell me, 'Don't send me that
kind of e-mail at work because I'll get in trouble; give me a hard
copy.' It bothers me that in the United States, you can't speak your
feelings."</TE>
<TE>   According to Michel Shehadeh, West Coast regional director of the
Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the Palestinian community, which
is scattered throughout Southern California, has also come together,
in fear and outrage, as they try to help their families on the West
Bank and to correct what they see as a pro-Israel bias of the
American media.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't sleep here," said Shehadeh, of the Garden Grove-based
office. "For the past 10 days, we stay on the phone and we watch
television. It's never been this way before. It's hell."</TE>
<TE>   His sisters and cousins live in a village near Ramallah, and
whenever the phones are working, they gather in one house and call
him.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell them we haven't forgotten them, that we are with them,"
he said, his voice shaking with fatigue and emotion. "We tell them
that we are with them always."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "I would rather be with them. It's harder being away."</TE>
<TE>   Shehadeh and his colleagues have participated in rallies and plan
to do so again. They write letters to editors and politicians and try
to make people see their point of view--that the root of the conflict
is the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and that the
suicide bombers are men driven to the edge by oppression that leaves
them no hope.</TE>
<TE>   "We cry and scream," he said. "We just don't believe how biased
the media is, how out of context they portray Palestinian life. We
don't get equal time. Our story is not getting out."</TE>
<TE>   And neither are any of his family. "They are resolved to stay," he
said. "This is their home, and they will either stay or be killed."</TE>
<TE>   Seven thousand miles away from the tanks and the screams and the
blood, those with families living in danger share wakeful nights and
prayer-filled days. They share fear, fury and frustration and,
perhaps most disturbing, they share the inability to see when, and
how, the fighting will end.</TE>
<TE>   "It is well past who is to blame," said Weiss. "I think there's a
solution; there's no reason two cultures can't live in peace. But
it's crossed the line now. So many immoral and unjust things are
happening. It's hard to know what will happen next."</TE>

<LD>What Does It Take to Be</LD>
<LD>   Alive on Earth?</LD>
<LD>   Is there life on Mars? As the new Mars Odyssey program sends back
pictures of the red planet, we return to that age-old question: Are
Martians really short and green with big eyes and no noses, like we
see on TV?</LD>
<TE>   To understand what Martian life might be like, scientists first
look at what we already know about life on Earth. Do you know what it
takes to be "alive" on Earth? Try this experiment at home:</TE>
<TE>   What you will need: bean seeds; two zipper baggies; paper towels;
stapler; masking tape.</TE>
<TE>   Step 1: Place a paper towel in each baggie.</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: Staple through the center of each baggie in a row from
side to side (see picture).</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Add about five beans and a bit of water to each baggie.
The beans should stay above the staples; let the water fall to the
bottom.</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Close the baggies.</TE>
<TE>   Step 5: Tape one baggie to a window and the other inside a dark
closet.</TE>
<TE>   Step 6: Leave the baggies alone for five days.</TE>
<TE>   Can you predict what will happen? Will any of these seeds sprout?
Which ones? Why? What do beans need to "come alive" and grow? Soil?
Fresh air? Light? Water?</TE>
<TE>   There are many different life forms to see at the Natural History
Museum. From elephants to cockroaches, all are fit to survive in
different environments. For more information, call (213) 763-3517 or
visit www.nhm.org.</TE>

<HD>For Writers, Food Is the Subject du Jour</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At some point in America's recent past, cuisine became food for
thought as well as for bodies. Knowledgeable and literate food
writing has become a staple of American journalism, a fact that may
be formally ratified May 1, when this year's National Magazine Awards
are handed out in New York.</LD>
<LD>   The two favorites for the criticism prize are food
writers--Jonathan Gold, a former Times contributor who reviews New
York restaurants for Gourmet, and Alan Richman, a onetime
sportswriter who travels the world for GQ. No restaurant critic or
food writer ever has won a general journalistic prize for criticism.
And if Gold or Richman wins, it will mark the end of an era in which
American cooking was transformed from a domestic necessity to an
expressive art, and eating from an indulgence to an act of aesthetic
appreciation.</LD>
<LD>   How did this happen?</LD>
<TE>   Food historian Barbara Haber, curator of books at Harvard
University's Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies and author of
the forthcoming "From Hardtack to Home Fries: An Uncommon History of
American Cooks and Meals," thinks two factors have been at work: The
eclipse of American puritanism and the legitimization of the sensual.
"It is no accident," she says, "that even today, people equate food
and sex. I live in New England, where traditionally food was quite
bad and you didn't complain because it was somehow rude to be
concerned with the senses. If you wanted to be edified, you went to
Symphony Hall or the Museum of Fine Arts, not to the table. Eating
and sexuality were forbidden topics. That's behind us now."</TE>
<TE>   Haber also notes what she sees as the significance of Gold's and
Richman's gender, though she also adds that both are "real writers
with real writers' voices." The movement of so many male journalists
into food writing, she says, has had real consequences. "It is an
unavoidable fact," Haber says, "that food writing traditionally was
considered womanish, and any occupation that has been feminized
usually has low status."</TE>
<TE>   Haber believes that the maturation of women's history projects in
American universities has played an essential role in creating an
intellectual foundation for the boom in food writing. Investigating
food, she says, "is now a major trend in social history. Food is a
window on our material culture. Wars have been fought over
foodstuffs. I've seen a complete turnaround in attitudes toward my
own work because so many of my colleagues now recognize that studying
food is an economical way to do deeply interesting history."</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton File</TE>
<TE>   It is possible that no one in human history has been cajoled,
condemned, praised, advised, analyzed or just plain muttered over by
as many paid pundits as former president Bill Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Now the folks who pay others to opine--and profit thereby--would
like nothing better than to turn the two-term chief executive into a
columnist on his own.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, for example, Clinton met with Michael O'Donnell,
publisher of the San Francisco-based online magazine Salon.com. On a
number of occasions since he left the White House, Salon has worked
with Clinton's staff to recycle his speeches into op-ed pieces with
what both sides felt was some success. In the course of their most
recent conversation, according to Clinton's spokeswoman, Julia Payne,
O'Donnell raised the possibility of formalizing the arrangement by
engaging the former chief executive to write a regular column for the
struggling cyber-mag.</TE>
<TE>   Sources familiar with the conversation now say that Salon shortly
will present Clinton with a formal proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "The president," said his Washington-based lawyer, Robert Barnett,
"has received dozens of offers to do one-off articles, series of
articles and syndicated columns, domestic and international. Right
now I have a folder of proposals three inches thick in my desk
drawer. He has not accepted any of them and has no current intention
to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "Since leaving office," Barnett said, Clinton "has received
hundreds and hundreds of offers. There have been media opportunities,
corporate opportunities, endorsement opportunities and teaching
offers. He is very grateful for them, but right now his focus is on
his charitable work, completing his memoirs and on his speeches."</TE>
<TE>   That's understandable, since Clinton commands up to $200,000 per
speech, a rate that is producing a multimillion-dollar yearly income,
while the $10-million advance Knopf paid for his book is the largest
nonfiction book deal in U.S. publishing history. Moreover, according
to Barnett, foreign interest in acquiring rights to his forthcoming
memoirs is extremely strong, particularly in the lucrative British,
German and Asian markets. Neither O'Donnell nor Salon editor David
Talbot was available for comment. But to provide an ex-president with
an audience, it seems, it takes a global village--of the real rather
than the virtual sort.</TE>
<TE>   On the Burner</TE>
<TE>   Yxta Maya Murray is professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School
and the author of two novels, "Locas" and "What It Takes to Get to
Vegas," which is set in East Los Angeles' boxing gyms.</TE>
<TE>   "At the moment I'm copy editing the manuscript of my new novel,
'The Conquest,' which is about a rare-book restorer who works at the
Getty Museum and is restoring a book about an Aztec juggler, a woman,
who is taken by Cortez from Tenochtitlan in Mexico to the Vatican.
It's based on an actual historical incident. Cortez brings her to the
Vatican as an entertaining present for the pope. She, however, has an
alternative mission in mind while in Europe, which is to assassinate
Charles V, the Holy Roman emperor, in retaliation for Europe's crimes
against Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "The question for the woman restorer at the Getty is: Who actually
wrote the book on which she is working? Experts believe it was an
insane Spanish priest who wrote a series of novels in the 16th
century--he's a completely fictional character--but the restorer
suspects that the juggler wrote it as an autobiography. So it's a
literary/historical detective story, and I think it's the first novel
set at the Getty. "</TE>

<HD>Double Exposure</HD>
<DH>Identical twin models Jaclyn and Kristy Hunt stand out in a
crowd, even in Paris.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Even in this city accustomed to scores of beautiful models strolling
its boulevards, Alhambra natives Kristy and Jaclyn Hunt almost always
command a double double take.</LD>
<LD>   It's not just that the brown-eyed brunets are 5 foot 11 and thin
enough to glide into size 4 designer gowns. They're also identical
twin models who've quietly been generating a small buzz within
fashion circles.</LD>
<LD>   As remarkable as their striking looks is the sameness of their
mannerisms, thoughts, tastes and aspirations. The constant companions
complete each other's sentences, like an old married couple. They
studied the same courses in college, pursued the same interests as
children and only now do they spend some time apart--both live in
South Pasadena except when Kristy visits her Florida boyfriend.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a twin thing," explained Jaclyn. The difference in their
faces and their personalities comes through when the reticent young
women relax and grow chattier at a cafe near Paris' famed Hediard
gourmet store. Kristy is quieter, but more droll. Jaclyn has slightly
finer bone structure. Both are direct and matter of fact.</TE>
<TE>   "I call them thinking men's beauties," said Stasia Langford, their
booking agent at LA Models, where they launched their 9-month-old
career. "Women find them interesting and men don't know, but there's
something about them."</TE>
<TE>   The 23-year-old twins possess an unconventional, slightly exotic
appeal, a blend of their German-Mexican lineage. When they were
teenagers, their looks caused L.A.-based photographer Norma Zuniga to
chase them across a South Pasadena parking lot to hire the
then-undiscovered girls. As Zuniga excitedly approached their car,
the teens were apprehensive.</TE>
<TE>   "We cracked the window only a little bit because we thought she
was psycho," recalled Kristy, who is quieter but more sarcastic than
her twin. Zuniga became a friend who coached the reserved,
inseparable girls through photo sessions in which they sometimes were
completely silent.</TE>
<TE>   The twins have matured to resemble a cross between models Stella
Tennant and Rudi Gernreich's muse Peggy Moffitt, whose '60s
bowl-shaped haircut they now sport. It's a look that helped them win
acclaim in their first days as professionals.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, when they finally heeded advice to go professional,
they attended local open calls for new talent. They struck a chord at
LA Models. "It's very rare that you find such interesting girls with
height whose look is very right-now," said Langford, who immediately
sent their photos to New York Model Management, a companion agency
with many high-fashion clients.</TE>
<TE>   Within the first 10 days of their June arrival in New York, the
twins scooped up a month's worth of nonstop assignments at a range of
international magazines. With their career just 2 months old, they
shot an elaborate, 16-page spread of haute couture in German Vogue
with revered fashion and art photographer Ruven Afanador. Days later,
they scored a spot in a high-profile Banana Republic campaign, a
breakthrough coup that sometimes eludes other beginning models for
years.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say that 70% of this business is personality," said
Langford. "These girls are really easy- going, and people like them.
That's half the battle." It's the other half that's getting harder.</TE>
<TE>   The twins spent most of March idling in Paris hoping to earn
high-profile runway exposure from the fall pret-a-porter previews
that just ended. They also hoped to make connections with magazines,
stylists and photographers. But they landed little runway experience
and sprinting to last-minute calls for show castings and magazine
shoots grew tiresome.</TE>
<TE>   Their luck, though, improved off the runway. Top fashion
photographer Paolo Roversi hired them for a lingerie shoot, a tough
assignment for even more experienced models that they completed with
aplomb.</TE>
<TE>   "It was supposed to be semi-nude because it was lingerie," said
Jaclyn.</TE>
<TE>   "It ended up that Jaclyn was completely nude," Kristy said, "and I
was wearing stockings and shoes."</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't awkward at all," Jaclyn said, explaining that the setup
was private and comfortable. They also understood that the shots
wouldn't be published beyond Roversi's portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, their professional composure in such a trying
situation stems from their naivete. "At the time, we didn't know who
[Roversi] was," said Kristy. "In a way, if we don't know who they
are," said Jaclyn, "it helps us not be nervous."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to learning who the top fashion photographers, models
and designers are, they're also learning how to budget, because
modeling agencies don't front their travel expenses, causing them a
degree of worry.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not getting a lot of work," Kristy said as she and her
sister waited backstage at the only runway show they worked in
Paris--for the virtually unknown French designer Julie Schouvey.
"Shows are really, really tough," said Cheri Bowen, who represents
the twins at New York Model Management. "There are 15 places in a
show, and there are 25 huge supermodels. There are few slots for a
new girl." It takes years, Bowen said, for models to create
relationships with the runway image makers. "As soon as they get one
of those people to like them," she said, "that's when they will get
their season."</TE>
<TE>   Runways also aren't receptive to women with busty figures. Though
their C-cup shape would be celebrated elsewhere, most designer
samples are cut for less amply proportioned women. Their Paris agent,
Marcus Pettersen, said newcomers often work fewer than three runway
shows in their first try. But few are honored with a shoot by
photographers such as Roversi. "It's a very big thing," Pettersen
said. "I think I was more thrilled than them."</TE>
<TE>   For their upcoming trips to New York, London and Milan, they will
concentrate on print work. The freer, risk-taking environment of
magazine shoots is a good fit for the twins, who are often described
as "editorial" in industry parlance, because they have an
avant-garde, atypical look that fits with high-fashion magazines.
Their biggest success has been with German Vogue, where Afanador
cleverly used them to ease logistics.</TE>
<TE>   "In shooting couture, it takes so long to do each look because
everything is so involved,'' he said. "Just to get a model dressed
for a couture shoot sometimes takes three times as long as a regular
shoot. The clothes are so layered and intricate. Having the two of
them who were so identical made our time be more efficient," Afanador
said.</TE>
<TE>   With two models, the pace was never interrupted, and Afanador
could freely indulge in elaborate hair and makeup, which created some
spectacular shots. Though he had never before met the twins, he said
he was struck by their photos and their "special skin--like
alabaster. I could tell by instinct that they had this quality that
was more like a painter's model," he said. "I'm always attracted to
this kind of look, instead of a look that is a fashion, trendy model
look."</TE>
<TE>   Afanador's shots make up a significant part of the twins'
portfolio, which includes other photos of them as a pair. They have
decided to work only as a team, a decision that could both help and
hurt their nascent career. Bookings may come easier because they
occupy a rare niche, but jobs for twins are limited.</TE>
<TE>   "The disadvantage is that sometimes they are only looked at as
twins," Langford said. "Once they run the gamut of the novelty
factor, then you say, now what?"</TE>
<TE>   The two are preparing themselves; they both graduated from Loyola
Marymount in Westchester in 2001 with degrees in animation and have
plans for more education. Instead of hitting Paris nightspots, the
serious-minded twins--who sport hip-hugger jeans and pepper their
speech with such youthful slang as "sucky"--stayed in an apartment
far from the city's core to study for their graduate entrance exams.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that keeps us going," said Kristy, "is that we know we
are working toward graduate school. This is something to do in the
meantime, and we like to travel."</TE>
<TE>   Watching them chase jobs in Paris was an eye-opener, said their
mother, Carmen Hunt, a speech communication professor at El Camino
College. Their father, Fred Hunt, is also a teacher. "You have to
have a real sense of confidence when you walk into a casting and
someone in a second says, 'Thank you, you're out of here,'" Carmen
Hunt said. "It takes courage to go on.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very lonely business," she said, "but they have each
other. That's what makes it work."</TE>

<HD>Heeeere's Jennifer!</HD>
<DH>Jack Nicholson's daughter has designed an eponymous
clothing line that reveals the same devilish spirit as her father's
famed grin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE and MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The best thing about being in fashion is that I don't have to lie
about my age anymore," says Jennifer Nicholson. After a short string
of small roles, the 38-year-old daughter of Jack Nicholson and his
first wife, Sandra Knight, has given up acting to launch an eponymous
clothing line.</LD>
<LD>   A lifetime vintage collector, Nicholson takes her inspiration from
the fanciful '50s. Short skirts are fashioned from a country club
tennis racquet print or delicate pink dotted swiss, and have layered
lace rears. "Waitress shirts" are each emblazoned with the name of
one of the designer's five dogs (Ruby, Pablo, Lola, Trixie and Gus).
And ladylike jackets with three-quarter-length trumpet sleeves, in
blue seersucker, pink baby corduroy or denim, fasten in front with
oversized safety pins.</LD>
<LD>   Nicholson describes her style as "1950s debutante on acid."
Although not an actual debutante, she offers that she did go to the
Marlborough School for Girls and join the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority
at USC. Still, "I was always on the fringe," she says with that
devilish grin that is all Jack.</LD>
<TE>   Pieces range from $250 to $1,000, and Saks Fifth Avenue has placed
an order for fall. Until then the collection is available at Pearl,
Nicholson's newly opened store on Montana Avenue in Santa Monica,
which also carries clothing from As Four, Fake London, Fausto
Puglisi, Henry Duarte, Imitation of Christ, James Coviello, Mayle and
Wink.</TE>
<TE>   The store is named after yet another pet. Pearl the bulldog is
dead, but her portrait hangs above the cash register near a cabana
that serves as the changing room.</TE>
<TE>   Nicholson, who has also worked as an interior designer (she
decorated her father's Mulholland Drive mansion), designed the beachy
space herself.</TE>
<TE>   Her dad's reaction? "Proud papa," she says. "He loves clothes."</TE>
<TE>   Ties: The Condensed Version</TE>
<TE>   Steve Valentine had hoped to get his Demi-Ties--a cross between a
necktie and an ascot--around at least one famous neck on Oscar night.
Didn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   But the neckwear newcomer isn't discouraged. After all, the former
public relations flack knows a thing or two about the highs and lows
of pitching a peculiar product, which is what he did just before the
Academy Awards. He schlepped across town, knocked on doors, took
meetings and did his best to put his ultra-cropped,
Edwardian-inspired ties in the hands of the handlers of Hollywood's
leading men.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all new to me," says Valentine, 42, who operated his
namesake public relations firm for more than 10 years before shutting
it down.</TE>
<TE>   His dream to design "a different necktie" became a reality last
summer. "I had nice suits and great shirts, but my ties were just too
traditional. I wanted a bolder look," he says. "I wanted to take it
up a notch."</TE>
<TE>   So with shears in hand, he whacked off the bottoms of his ties and
began wearing his creations to clubs and restaurants. The geek-chic
look drew lots of attention. Months later he bought a $100 Kenmore
sewing machine and learned to stitch his shrunken silhouette of a
tie--5 inches wide and 6 to 8 inches long, or slightly above the
shirt's third button when worn.</TE>
<TE>   Soon people "were following me into elevators to find out where I
got the tie." Made of raw silk, rich brocades, damask, upholstery and
vintage fabrics, the ties are adorned with buttons, tassels, fringe
and beading. Others are hand-painted by L.A. artist Miguel Angel
Reyes with images from sculptures such as "The Thinker" and the Venus
de Milo. Valentine, who lives in Marina del Rey, also hopes to add
vests and belts to the line.</TE>
<TE>   His ties may not have made it to the red carpet, but they are
still getting out and about. Waiters at Chaya Venice and Confete
Latin Brasserie in West Hollywood are donning them, and they are soon
to be worn by waiters at downtown restaurant Cicada and the staff at
the Hotel Sofitel. Demi-ties, $75 each, at Traffic Men in the Beverly
Center; www.demi-tie.com.</TE>

<LD>In the crowded lobby, Carol Henry checks her watch. Twenty minutes to
go ...</LD>
<LD>   At 8:30 p.m., when the concert hall lights flicker, she and her
husband, Warner, head to their balcony seats. Two weeks ago, as a
reluctant host family for the first Rachmaninoff International Piano
Competition and Festival, they had not expected to feel this way,
this invested. But by Tuesday, the couple had eased right back into
the roles that they had buried when their three grown children left
home. Here, at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, the Henrys feel like
nervous parents all over again. On this mild spring evening, though,
the couple's hopes will flutter with cadenzas and pivot on the
explosion of piano chords played by 29-year-old Jan Krzysztof Broja.
The lanky, boyish pianist is their house guest, and they have dreams
for him now. . A competition finalist, Broja is about to step onstage
and join members of the Pasadena Symphony. This is his night, after
days of playing alone on a grand piano in the Henrys' Pasadena living
room, usually in a sweatshirt, pants and socks.</LD>
<LD>   In late March, Broja flew from his bachelor's apartment in Warsaw,
Poland, to the couple's 10,000-square-foot home overlooking the
Arroyo Seco gorge near the Rose Bowl. He brought only a backpack.</LD>
<TE>   Broja is a little shy, polite with a quick smile, the type that
made Carol Henry fly into mom mode. One day, she talked him into
taking a ride down Mulholland Drive. Another morning, she got him to
take a quick break to watch herons dipping into the koi pond.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Henry keeps him stocked with bandages for his fingertips,
which are bruised from keyboard pounding. And he practices 10 hours
or so a day, in a living room with 24-foot-high ceilings. Neither
Carol nor Warner Henry plays the piano, though all three of their
kids took lessons. "This!" Carol Henry says recently, a hand cupped
to her ear to catch his powerful opening notes in the third movement
of Rachmaninoff's Concerto No. 3. "Listening to this all day, it's
just fabulous."</TE>
<TE>   The Henrys urged Broja to play the piano any time, day or night,
though he rarely practices past 10 p.m. They had only one request.
Could he take a break from practicing on the night of Warner's 64th
birthday, when the couple had planned a dinner for 15? Of course,
Broja replied. But would it be OK if he played a little recital for
the guests? He did and added a surprise. Broja logged on to the
family's computer and listened to an online recording of the Beatles
song "When I'm 64." He printed out the lyrics. During the birthday
party, he had everyone sing along while he played the piece for the
first time.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight jurors will announce the top finishers among the six
finalists, including a grand prize winner who will receive $30,000,
donated by Alexandre Rachmaninoff, the grandson of the famous Russian
composer. The first-place winner also will be awarded a grand piano
valued at $28,000 and, if organizers can swing it, a concert date at
a major U.S. venue. (Organizers include the Russian Ministry of
Culture, the city of Pasadena and Master Classes International, a Los
Angeles-based nonprofit that brings international concert artists to
California.)</TE>
<TE>   A recent newspaper article reports that Broja is an audience
favorite, along with 23-year-old Alessio Cioni of Italy. The two
pianists are the only finalists who have chosen to play
Rachmaninoff's notoriously difficult third concerto, a draining piece
that was popularized in the movie "Shine."</TE>
<TE>   "I was in tears when I read the [press]," Warner Henry says. "I
was so touched for [Broja] ... I've told him, 'You are both
controlled and play with great power, and at the same time, you're
lyrical and it all comes through.'"</TE>
<TE>   Broja, who performs in solo recitals throughout Europe, says it
helps to know that the Henrys are pulling for him from the darkness
of the audience. "Of course, this is very important because you feel
alone when you're far from home," he says. "When you play a [solo]
concert, you're the king of the stage, but you don't know what you're
doing when you're in competition."</TE>
<TE>   In Pasadena, for the Rachmaninoff competition, hospitality
chairwoman Peggy Phelps spent 11/2 years lining up and visiting 30
volunteer households. Half of the homes had grand pianos; Kawai, the
piano maker, loaned grand pianos to the other 15, sending a master
technician from Japan to tune the instruments according to each
competitor's specifications.</TE>
<TE>   The volunteer hosts include Pasadena-area residents who live in
condominiums and bungalows, along with single people and families
with children, says Jonathan Glus, the city's executive director of
cultural affairs. Glus was overwhelmed by offers from potential
hosts, including a retired woman who lives in a small apartment and
owns two Steinway grand pianos. "It's very heartwarming," Glus says.
"Pasadena, as old as this city is, has the tradition of culture being
the center of civic activity. This demonstrates that yet again."</TE>
<TE>   None of the hosts has reported any problems, other than
communication difficulties with competitors who don't speak much
English. A Chinese competitor brought along her mother, but that
wasn't a problem. The mother headed for the kitchen and took over as
the family cook.</TE>
<TE>   The Henrys originally had no plans to take in a pianist. But they
agreed to do so as a favor to a friend who was in charge of
recruiting host families. The Henrys warned their friend that their
schedule was packed with volunteer commitments to the Los Angeles
Opera and other organizations. They could offer a bed and open their
kitchen to someone, but other than that, they had family obligations
and no time to fold a stranger's life into theirs.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Henry had worried about an upcoming visit with her
grandkids. Maybe Broja would be bothered by three little kids running
through the house. He wasn't. Now, their son and daughter-in-law call
daily from the Bay area. When can Broja come visit? How is he doing?</TE>
<TE>   The Henrys have noticed only a couple signs of nerves. Before his
early rounds of play, he ran his fingers through his wavy brown hair
a lot. And this week, Broja, a tea drinker, is asking for coffee.</TE>
<TE>   On the night before a final round, he joins the Henrys and a
family friend for a glass of Chardonnay and then a dinner of beef
fillet, squash and asparagus. Conversation turns to travel, movies
and family. Carol Henry mentions that after hearing him play, their
7-year-old grandson, Cameron, has declared that he wants to become a
pianist. "It's very complicated," Broja notes with a pained grin.
"You should tell this to Cameron before he gets involved."</TE>
<TE>   Broja drums his fingers on the table, hearing notes in his head.</TE>
<TE>   Rachmaninoff, who died in Beverly Hills in 1943, once played here
at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. For Tuesday's final round,
featuring three of the six finalists, tickets sell for up to $120.</TE>
<TE>   Broja is scheduled to play last. He walks onstage with the
symphony's conductor, Jorge Mester. The young pianist is wearing a
charcoal-gray collared shirt and black pants. No jacket, no tie, no
expression.</TE>
<TE>   Broja bows quickly to acknowledge the applause, screws down the
piano seat and shakes out his fingers at his sides. Then he plays.</TE>
<TE>   He is loose, leaning into the energy of Beethoven's Fifth Piano
Concerto. On occasion he ends a passage with a flourish, an arched
hand lingering at brow level.</TE>
<TE>   When he finishes, about 45 minutes later, the applause is warm and
prolonged. The corners of Broja's mouth tug up a bit. "I've been
listening to that piano music now for days," Carol Henry gushes. "But
to hear it with the orchestra and to watch the embellishments! I felt
so proud. I wanted everyone up there [in the balcony] to know he was
my kid."</TE>
<TE>   Carol and Warner Henry work their way through the crowd and track
Broja down backstage.</TE>
<TE>   He is grinning.</TE>

<HD>The Skinny on Where to Find Long Shorts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: This is the third or fourth spring season that
I've noticed predominantly short shorts in the stores. Am I the only
gal who can't let it all hang out? I actually have pretty slim legs,
but they ain't what they used to be, and I am desperate to cover them
from the knee up. Do the designers really want to see our cellulite
and varicose veins? Also, car seats get hot in the summer, and it's
nice to have some protection for the back of the leg. Can you please
ask the designers what they're thinking? And does anybody carry
longer shorts? I like mine with slim legs, which are even harder to
find.</LD>
<LD>   --PICKY</LD>
<LD>   Dear Picky: We strongly suspect that the preponderance of short
shorts has to do with wanting to cash in on the lucrative youth
market, which manufacturers, designers and retailers have been
chasing for some time. And when it comes to that market (we're
talking teens and 20s), sexy is in, hence the ubiquitous belly
shirts, see-through lace blouses, miniskirts, etc. (all the better to
show off those piercings and tattoos).</LD>
<TE>   But there are some sympathetic souls who understand your plight,
and haven't abandoned women who want more coverage. We found several
different styles of longer shorts, some even with the slim leg you
desire. At Gap.com we found narrow denim utility shorts for $38
(www.gap.com, or call [800] 427-7895). L.L. Bean has Tencel/cotton
shorts for $44 (www.llbean.com, or call [800] 441-5713), and Talbots
offers slim-leg seersucker Bermuda shorts for $68 and pleated twill
shorts for $44 (www.talbots.com, or call [800] 825-2687).</TE>
<TE>   At Chadwick's of Boston, there are Cambridge Country walk shorts
for $16 (www.chadwicks .com, or call [800] 677-0340), and J. Jill has
long cotton drawstring shorts for $39 (www.jjill.com, or call [800]
343-5700). Spiegel also carries two styles of slim Bermuda shorts for
$39 and $49 (www.spie gel.com, or call [800] 527-1577).</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: I started scrapbooking several months ago,
and am hopelessly addicted. What does this have to do with fashion?
Whenever I take family pictures, my husband is wearing the same shirt
in a small range of colors--a polo in either light blue or light
gray. On rare occasions he'll wear a tailored shirt, but also in
light blue. I've practically pleaded with him to wear different
colors and styles--maybe a sweater now and then?--but he won't budge.
My scrapbook layouts would look so much better if he'd just vary his
wardrobe. It's much easier with the kids, since they're just
toddlers. But what to do about my husband?</TE>
<TE>   --THINKING OF CROPPING HIM OUT</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dear Thinking: We have many friends who are also scrapbooking
fanatics, so we understand your plight. While you can't always
control what everyone wears (you must leave room for candid shots
too), it would be nice if, for key planned pictures, family members
wore pastels in spring, brights in summer, jewel tones during the
winter holidays, etc. After all, what's the point of investing that
much money in supplies and equipment if someone's going to wear a
pale blue shirt in a photo showing colorful fall foliage?</TE>
<TE>   It's often difficult to get men to stray from their wardrobe
comfort zones, but we don't think you should give up. Start by
suggesting different tones of shades he's familiar with, such as
royal blue, slate blue, navy or charcoal gray. Be sure to pour on the
compliments when he tries something on. Don't ooze insincerity, but
make sure he knows how terrific he looks. By the way, it wouldn't
hurt to get your friends to throw in a nice word or two as well, and
don't forget to show him how great your layouts look when the family
is sartorially coordinated.</TE>
<TE>   Once he starts getting positive feedback he'll be more likely to
explore other color ranges, such as sage, topaz or maybe even
burgundy, and maybe even branch out to sweaters and different styles
of shirts.</TE>
<TE>   It's important to have patience during this process; a scrapbook
isn't built in a day, and neither is a man's overhauled wardrobe. If
your husband is completely stubborn about trying new clothes, don't
push him. It's far more important to have happy family photos, even
if the colors are a little off.</TE>

<HD>Kate Shelley: Heroine of Honey Creek</HD>
<DH>Part 5: The story so far: Kate has helped rescue a train
crew and kept the Midnight Express from plunging into the creek.</DH>

<LD>Kate went home to Ma and the kids, hoping for a hot bath and a long
sleep. But that was not to be. As soon as word spread of her heroic
action, people began to knock at the door of the little farmhouse.
Neighbors brought cakes and pies and cookies. Reporters came, wanting
to write her story.</LD>
<LD>   Kate's fame grew as more stories were written about her. People
read the stories and wanted to help the family. They raised money to
pay off the mortgage on the farm. Kate spoke at meetings throughout
the state. She received money for speaking and helped Ma pay for food
and clothing and things they needed to run the farm. She was also
given a lifetime pass on the railroad. What she liked best was a gold
medal given to her by the state of Iowa.</LD>
<LD>   Schoolchildren loved to hear Kate's story. Soon Kate became a
teacher. In 1901, 20 years after she crawled across the bridge and
saved the train, another honor came to Kate. A new iron railroad
bridge was built across the Des Moines River. It was named for her.</LD>
<TE>   In 1903, Kate became the station agent in her town. She worked
there until her death in 1912. Today, people still remember her name
and her bravery as a teenager. Throughout the state there are
plaques, parks and museums honoring the memory of Kate Shelley, the
heroine of Honey Creek.</TE>

<HD>Simple Cease-Fires Won't Lead to a Lasting Peace</HD>
<DH>Talks must focus on ending the occupation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUSSEIN IBISH</AU>
<BD> Hussein Ibish is communications director of the
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Israeli tanks besieging everything from the Church of the Holy
Nativity to Yasser Arafat's compound, President Bush has finally
taken the war between Israel and the Palestinians seriously enough to
dispatch Colin Powell to the region.</LD>
<LD>   All previous peace missions, including those of Anthony Zinni's,
have been total failures for two fundamental reasons.</LD>
<LD>   First, no U.S. official has ever been allowed to tie American aid
to Israeli policies, leaving them with little leverage over Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon.</LD>
<TE>   Second, the fixation on having an immediate cease-fire while not
addressing the ongoing causes of the conflict is an inherently
unworkable strategy, because it fails to replace the violence with a
viable political process.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's speech Thursday suggests that there has been at least some
movement toward addressing the fundamental realities that fuel the
fighting. He called for an end to the Israeli occupation based on
U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, which does not allow acquiring
territory by war.</TE>
<TE>   The president was, however, careful to include a phrase about
"secure and recognized borders" for Israel, which some Israelis
interpret as authorizing them to keep land seized in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush also called for the creation of a viable
Palestinian state and for an end to the building of Israeli
settlements. These statements reflect a growing realization that, for
the conflict to be resolved, there must be as much attention to the
Palestinian need for freedom and statehood as there is to Israeli
needs for security and recognition.</TE>
<TE>   No one can argue with Bush's condemnation of suicide bomb attacks
against Israeli civilians. They are reprehensible and unjustifiable.
However, like so many other American politicians and commentators,
the president seems to notice or condemn only attacks on Israeli
civilians. The fact that more than 1,000 Palestinian civilians, many
of them children, were killed in the past 18 months seems to be
irrelevant or justified to many people. The deliberate targeting of
Palestinian civilians by Israeli forces has been documented by every
human rights group that has looked into it. Outrage over suicide
bombings cannot be allowed to eclipse the equal immorality of other
forms of murder.</TE>
<TE>   There is also the question why Secretary of State Powell is
waiting another week to go on this urgent mission. It is hard to
avoid the suspicion that the administration expects Sharon will
ignore Bush's demands, and that the Israeli leader is determined to
continue, at least for a few more days, his futile campaign to crush
the Palestinians by brute force.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the president's rhetoric suggested that he buys into the
absurd Israeli line that its violent occupation of the Palestinian
people is somehow analogous to America's war against Al Qaeda. Such a
fundamental error would make it impossible for the U.S. to play any
constructive role in resolving the conflict between the Israelis and
the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, there is no evidence that the administration is yet
willing to confront the pro-Israel special interest groups in the
U.S. that furiously resist anything less than unconditional support
for Israel's colonial occupation.</TE>
<TE>   But the most troubling aspect of Bush's rhetoric concerns Arafat
himself.</TE>
<TE>   By placing blame for the current situation on him personally and
calling for the development of a new Palestinian leadership, the
president played into the hands of Sharon and other Israeli
extremists who seek to personalize the conflict and make Arafat,
rather than the occupation, appear to be its root cause.</TE>
<TE>   What would change if Arafat were gone tomorrow? The checkpoints,
the Jewish-only roads and settlements, the Israeli occupation forces
and the 3.5 million Palestinians determined to resist and end that
occupation by any means necessary would all still be in place. The
only obvious effect would be to further radicalize the Palestinian
population.</TE>
<TE>   We can no longer afford to pretend that this is all about one
man's real or supposed failings, or that it is "a war on terror" or a
problem that can be dealt with in gradual stages.</TE>
<TE>   What the Palestinians are engaged in is a desperate and ruthless
war of national liberation of the most classic kind.</TE>
<TE>   We are far beyond the stage where simple cease-fires and
confidence-building measures will be effective. Difficult as it may
seem, the only realistic way out is to start serious talks designed
to end the occupation completely and use that as a basis for building
a workable cease-fire that can become a permanent peace.</TE>

<HD>Hard as He Tries, He Can't Be Un-Clinton</HD>
<DH>Bush yielded to political pressure and reversed his Middle
East policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD> James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York. E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reality bites. One could almost hear President Bush chewing the
inside of his cheeks Thursday as he announced that he was dispatching
Secretary of State Colin Powell to the Middle East, reversing his
"hands off" policy--a policy that had clearly failed.</LD>
<LD>   Bush is proud, but he's a politician, too, and so he ended up
yielding to one of the most powerful forces in politics: regression.
Yes, regression, the statistical concept that explains why the
policies of one president change so little from the policies of the
previous president.</LD>
<LD>   Every White House starts out with a degree of contempt for its
predecessor, determined to do things differently. But the full
measure of Bushite contempt for the Clintonians became clear in
February, when Ari Fleischer gibed that after "an attempt to shoot
the moon and get nothing, more violence resulted."</LD>
<TE>   His argument was that the Camp David negotiations in late 2000
actually escalated the fighting. The White House spokesman quickly
apologized for his precise choice of words, but it was obvious that
he was merely expressing the general sentiment of his colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11 hardened Bush's resolve to be the
un-Clinton, convincing the Texan that the time of pinstripes was past
and the era of uniforms lay ahead.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech to Congress nine days later, the president unveiled
the sharp edge of his new doctrine: "Either you are with us or you
are with the terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Such black-and-white phrasing was applicable to Al Qaeda, but most
of the rest of the world has proved decidedly grayer. And as the
months passed, world attention turned to other issues.</TE>
<TE>   Commentator John Simpson wrote last week in the Telegraph--the
most conservative and pro-American of the British dailies--that the
United States now is virtually alone in the world, not realizing that
the events of Sept. 11 are "a part of history." He added, "For most
governments around the world, the destruction of the Taliban in
Afghanistan closed the account."</TE>
<TE>   Many, perhaps most, Americans wouldn't agree, of course, but
America is just 5% of the world. And the views of the other 95% count
for something. That was proven Thursday, as pressure from other
nations forced the Bush administration to detour, at least
temporarily, from its effort to focus on a "regime change" in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   As the president said Thursday, Powell will be heading to the
Middle East "to seek broad international support" for some sort of
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Bush's shift was so sudden--the White House gave reporters
just an hour's notice of his remarks--that key supporters were caught
by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Project for the New American Century wrote Bush
an open letter, praising him for his laissez-faire Middle Eastern
policy. That was April 3. On April 4, with terrorism undiminished,
Bush announced that Powell would begin negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Schmitt, executive director of the project and one of the
signatories, did not hide his disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "A little bit of a mission impossible," he lamented in an
interview, adding, "it's actually kind of dangerous" to send
America's top diplomat on a mission with so little chance of success.</TE>
<TE>   But, of course, Bush's newfound engagement is just beginning. The
realities of leading a peace coalition, as well as a war coalition,
will inevitably force the president to make further changes in his
original policy. And who knows? Maybe he will "shoot for the moon"
and actually try to reach an agreement to stop the killing.</TE>
<TE>   And that's where the concept of regression comes in.</TE>
<TE>   More than a century ago, the British social scientist Francis
Galton, studying the height of children, noticed something
interesting. Tall parents tended to have tall children, as one might
expect, but the children were not, on average, as tall as their
parents. And the same was true of short parents; their children were
short, but not as short as their parents. This is the so-called
"regression effect," in which extremes tend to collapse toward the
middle.</TE>
<TE>   What's true for kids is also true for presidents. Bush wanted to
be different from Clinton but found himself yielding to the political
equivalent of regression. And so his policies have taken a familiar
turn, toward the muddled middle, into the deep rut of presidential
precedent.</TE>
<TE>   Bush might not like it, but that's the problem with reality. It
has to be reckoned with, even when it hurts.</TE>

<HD>Missing: Realistic Take on Arafat</HD>
<DH>Daniel Pipes is director of the Philadelphia-based Middle
East Forum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL PIPES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thursday, George W. Bush gave one of the oddest speeches in two
centuries of presidential rhetoric. What made it so very strange was
that it contained two starkly contradictory parts.</LD>
<LD>   For convenience, let's call them Speech A and Speech B.</LD>
<LD>   In Speech A, Bush lambasted Yasser Arafat for deploying terror
against Israel and informed the Palestinian leader that his
predicament today, surrounded by Israeli tanks, "is largely of his
own making."</LD>
<TE>   By name, the president listed four groups (Al Aqsa Brigades,
Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad) and accused them not just of
opposing the peace process but also of seeking the destruction of
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Bush proceeded to endorse Israeli efforts at self-protection:
"America recognizes Israel's right to defend itself from terror." He
warmly identified himself as "a committed friend of Israel" and noted
his concern with the country's long-term security.</TE>
<TE>   In sum, Speech A condemns Arafat and backs Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In Speech B, the president drew policy implications opposite from
what might be expected. Rather than concluding that Arafat's having
broken his word and resorted to terrorism renders him unfit for
further diplomacy, Bush gave him yet another chance by calling on the
Palestinian Authority to stop terrorist activities.</TE>
<TE>   Yet more implausibly, he appealed to "responsible Palestinian
leaders [to] show the world that they are truly on the side of
peace."</TE>
<TE>   Then, rather than endorse Israeli actions of recent days to root
out the terrorist infrastructure on the West Bank as steps entirely
in accord with the U.S. war on terrorism, Bush surprisingly called on
the Sharon government to halt its incursions into
Palestinian-controlled areas, begin to withdraw from cities it
recently occupied, cease settlement activity in occupied territories
and help to build a politically and economically viable Palestinian
state.</TE>
<TE>   In sum, Speech B backs Arafat and condemns Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Whence comes this illogic? From two mistakes. One is to believe
that Arafat can change his ways, ignoring the fact that he entered
the terrorism business in 1965 and has never abandoned it. This man
is irredeemable, and any diplomacy premised on his behaving in a
civilized way is doomed to failure. (Curiously, the U.S. government
itself makes no parallel mistake of negotiating with the Taliban's
Mullah Omar or Iraq's Saddam Hussein.)</TE>
<TE>   Second, the president seems not to understand the purpose of
Palestinian violence against Israel. It is not directed at winning an
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza. Had the Palestinians
wanted just that, they could have taken it on a silver platter during
negotiations at Camp David in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, this violence has a much more ambitious set of goals: the
destruction of the Jewish state itself. To be sure, when speaking to
a Western audience, this point is downplayed or denied, but one has
only briefly to eavesdrop on Arabic-language television, radio,
mosque sermons, classrooms or cafe discussions to see the wide
consensus for eliminating Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In light of this Arab rejectionism, it sounds a bit plaintive and
irrelevant when the president expresses a hope that Palestinians will
agree to an immediate cease-fire and an immediate resumption of
security cooperation with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's decision to send Secretary of State Colin Powell to the
Middle East looks utterly forlorn. Why should Palestinians agree to a
cease-fire when they are at war and think they are doing well, as all
evidence suggests?</TE>
<TE>   To watch Bush dealing with an increasingly acrimonious
Arab-Israeli theater leaves me with two impressions: His larger
vision--to support Israel against terrorism--shows a clear
understanding of the situation. But his limited understanding of the
issues leads him to adopt superficial, even counterproductive
policies.</TE>
<TE>   If the U.S. government wants to help tamp down the current
violence, it has one attractive option: encourage Israel to defeat
the forces of terrorism as it sees fit and remind the Arab states, as
the president has so often done since September, that "you're either
with us or against us in the fight against terror."</TE>
<TE>   That policy has the virtues of moral clarity, of consistency and
of helping to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.</TE>

<HD>Rich White Men Can't Be Allowed to Hog the Political
Process</HD>
<DH>Campaign financing, despite recent reforms, isn't
suffieciently inclusive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY O. SHELTON and SPENCER OVERTON</AU>
<BD>Hilary O. Shelton is the director of the NAACP's
Washington bureau. Spencer Overton is a law professor at UC Davis and
a board member of the Fannie Lou Hamer Project, a national
organization that works to reframe campaign finance reform as a civil
rights issue.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the 1964 presidential election, Fannie Lou Hamer led a group
of black Mississippians to the Democratic National Convention in
Atlantic City. At the convention, she testified that the all-white
Mississippi delegation did not fairly represent Mississippi's people
because she and other African Americans were prevented from voting
through violence and discriminatory devices such as literacy tests.
The national networks aired her testimony, and the next year
President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act.</LD>
<LD>   Now that President Bush has signed federal campaign reform
legislation that bans "soft money" contributions, the next step
requires an embrace of the inclusive democratic values put forth by
Hamer and full public financing of campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   Hamer, who died in 1977, viewed participation as a right and
sought to remove barriers to political participation by all
Americans, regardless of race, gender and economic status. In
contrast, most conventional campaign finance proposals, including the
ban on soft money, aim to reduce the corrupting influence of
individual wealthy interests over government.</LD>
<TE>   Broadening the campaign reform movement to include Hamer's
democratic values would mean at least two things. First, the
movement's leadership and membership would expand to reflect the
diversity of America. At present, suburban upper-middle-class
good-government activists provide most of the support for
conventional reform proposals. Second, an inclusive movement would
promote reforms that make democracy more accessible for racial and
ethnic minorities, women and the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Even after soft money contributions are banned, campaign funding
will be controlled by a narrow, homogenous group that will make
"hard" money contributions of up to $2,000 per election. Studies of
these contributors show that 80% are male, 81% have household incomes
over $100,000 and more than 95% are white. This prosperous white and
mostly male class determines which candidates can run credible
campaigns. It also gives preferential access to politicians and to
the leadership of political parties, greatly determining which issues
will be at the forefront of the legislative agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Public financing of elections would help end the monopoly that
private money has had as an obstacle to participation. Some might say
that government cannot afford to replace the $2.7 billion in private
money contributed to candidates and parties in the last election
cycle, but any tactic that can more squarely focus the attention of
our federal officials on key community concerns such as racial
profiling, health-care disparities, police brutality and education
reform must be given a chance. Public financing of campaigns would
promote advancements in improving the lives of the overwhelming
majority of Americans who are not a part of the less than 7% of the
population that funds federal elections. A more inclusive democracy
would give everyone a sense of first-class citizenship and would
avoid the frustration and disillusionment that flow from systems that
rely primarily on private dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired," Hamer proclaimed in
explaining her activism. The future of campaign reform requires a
bold vision that speaks to the concerns of the "sick and tired" and
includes all Americans in our democracy.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The town of Mammoth Lakes wants us to believe that 300,000 people
arriving by passenger jet would not cause the funky but charming
village to mushroom into a massive international resort amid the
magnificent eastern Sierra landscape. In fact, the town's latest,
flawed environmental study argues that the area ecology would improve
because Southern Californians could fly to Mammoth rather than spend
six or more hours on the road driving there.</LD>
<LD>   Got it? Fewer cars on U.S. 395, less pollution. The problem is,
Southern Californians may be reluctant to fly to Mammoth through
Chicago or Dallas, which is where the planes--the Boeing 757s the
town is eager to expand its little airport to accommodate--would
originate. And by the way, Mammoth's argument for expanding the
airport is that those planes are integral to a proposed $800-million
makeover that developers hope will turn the town and ski area into
another Aspen or Vail.</LD>
<TE>   Intrawest, the ski area's Vancouver-based majority stockholder, is
transforming the town and has an agreement with American Airlines to
bring in an estimated 33,000 visitors during the first winter of
expanded airport operation, with a potential of almost 10 times that
in future years. But service cannot start until the town spends an
estimated $29 million--to be provided by the Federal Aviation
Administration--to lengthen by 1,200 feet and widen by 50 feet the
single runway at Mammoth-Yosemite Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The town has failed miserably in its contorted attempts to
demonstrate that expanding the airport, about five miles away on a
plateau 7,000 feet above sea level, can be done without significantly
affecting the environment. The latest effort reiterates its earlier
head-in-the-sand finding that there would be no major impact
"directly, indirectly or cumulatively." The state attorney general's
blunt retort: Do it again and do it right or we'll see you in court.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, the FAA also kissed off the environment, even while
acknowledging that the jet service would spur tourism. Faced with
legal threats, the agency decided to study the project more
thoroughly. Its updated decision is expected soon.</TE>
<TE>   The reality is that no one has done what needs to be done: to
conduct a comprehensive examination of the combined effects of the
air service and town growth on the region, including construction,
now underway, of an entire village with $600,000 condos, a golf
course and a gondola linking the town with a ski area that sits, in
part, on public forest. The study needs to examine the alternative
benefits of flying the planes into Bishop's airport, 40 miles to the
south, 3,000 feet lower than Mammoth and not subject to winter
weather as severe.</TE>
<TE>   Mammoth Lakes is at the heart of a spectacular natural playground,
a public asset that so far has escaped the hasty overdevelopment that
has marred other gems, such as the Lake Tahoe basin. Mammoth town
leaders have a responsibility to make certain that their quest for
more visitors does not spoil the eastern Sierra for everyone.</TE>

<HD>Fat Deductions From the IRS</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grab a doughnut and digest this: The Internal Revenue Service, the
maligned bureaucratic ogre that emerges like a groundhog every April
around the 15th, has announced that obese people can deduct
out-of-pocket expenses for weight-loss efforts (Yay!). But
restrictions are tight (Boo!). You can deduct diet expenses without
deducting pounds for the rest of your possibly shortened life (Yay!).
But you can amend only three past returns, meaning recent corpulence
is deductible but older fat isn't (Boo!).</LD>
<LD>   Obesity and weight-loss advocates hailed the decision because it
makes obesity a separate disease, tied to some 300,000 taxpayer
deaths per year, instead of some voluntary condition achieved by,
say, overeating or underexercising. Estimates say 54 million
Americans are obese--30-plus pounds heavier than healthy. That's
about 1.62 billion pounds of obesity, enough to flatten even the
sturdiest couch. But with a tax write-off as an official incentive to
pork up so we can perpetually struggle against weight to forever save
taxes, we might be able to nudge that obesity stat closer to 2
billion pounds in no time.</LD>
<TE>   This new healthy tax write-off business can take on an oversized
life of its own. Here are some other tax deductions to consider:
Since diet foods aren't tax-deductible, maybe investments in
super-sized fast foods should be--to reach the optimum obesity
write-off level quickest. The same thinking suggests tax deductions
of 28 cents for every mile driven, instead of run or biked. No
write-offs for wine or carrots, which might be healthy, but a tax
write-off of, say, 50 cents for every can of beer consumed might work
(30 cents for light beer). And clothing deductions are musts; how can
the IRS provide tax incentives to fatten up to slim down without
expecting new clothes at each stage? Plus, naturally, mileage
deductions to shop for them. A deduction for TV remote batteries
makes sense. The IRS allows weight-loss write-offs only if, with
medical expenses, they total at least 7.5% of the obese one's
adjusted gross income. So as well as eating more, many of us seeking
to qualify will also no doubt seek sizable pay reductions.</TE>

<LD>President Bush's welcome change of strategy Thursday provides a road
map to end the slaughter in the Middle East. His dispatch of
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell offers a navigator for the
journey.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's declaration that "enough is enough" was days overdue, as
was the evenhanded tone of his remarks. Bush switched from relentless
denunciations of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat and
silence on Israel's invasion of Palestinian cities to chastising both
sides; from an insistence that a cease-fire be a prelude to political
talks to the pragmatic stance that the antagonists can follow
military and political tracks simultaneously.</LD>
<LD>   The president was right to criticize Arafat and denounce the vile
suicide bombers--including an 18-year-old woman last week--who
destroy their own promising lives and those of innocent Israelis.
Arab nations need to pair their support of Palestinians with
thunderous declamations against the acts of deluded men and women who
believe themselves to be martyrs.</LD>
<TE>   Without betraying the United States' long-standing loyalty to
Israel or minimizing Israelis' suffering, Bush revealed that he
understood this: Even in times of relative peace, many Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza endure cramped, fearful lives. His use of
the term "humiliation" was apt and echoed the laments of many
Palestinians, from doctors to shopkeepers, forced by Israeli soldiers
to wait for hours at checkpoints to learn whether they can cross to
jobs, parks, mosques. Such delays and bullying destroy the
Palestinian economy and rob dignity from those in the occupied
territories, most of whom oppose terror. Bush said Israel had
accepted the eventual establishment of an independent Palestinian
state, side by side with Israel, but added the important nuance that
it must be "politically and economically viable."</TE>
<TE>   Powell's arrival next week gives Israel more time to search for
terrorists in the cities into which it has sent tanks and troops,
though not as much time as the government of Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon wanted. Israel is right to defend itself aggressively against
the terrorists who want to drive the area's sole democracy into the
sea. But wholesale attacks on Palestinian cities create more
extremists. By suggesting a realistic vision of a Palestinian state,
Bush gives those in the occupied territories a reason to rein in the
violence, a goal to negotiate toward. Arafat has squandered past
opportunities. His followers should not let him do so again.</TE>

<LD>Re "High-Paid Jobs Latest U.S. Export," April 2: The reasons that
Americans are into cheap goods fall under two categories: They don't
have enough income to keep afloat and to buy better goods, or they
haven't learned that real quality goods last longer and work better.</LD>
<LD>   We are in a throwaway society; rather than fix something, we go
out and buy a cheap replacement ("cheap" meaning low-cost and
sub-quality). People here do not make wages that would cover the cost
of better, American-made products because those industries have sold
out and opted to locate in countries where the workers are also up
against a wall economically.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign workers don't get paid enough to afford the very things
they make, either. The only real way Americans could get an even
break is to place high tariffs on anything imported--and keep those
who have sold out and left from coming back in for a period of years.</LD>
<TE>   Workers are not the problem; it's the corporate greed and
companies' cutthroat management.</TE>
<TE>   Besides tariffs, other countries such as those in Central America
and Asia would do well to require that any company opening up shop
there purchase housing for the workers, educate them, send their kids
to college and initiate other socially elevating projects as a
condition of being a manufacturer.</TE>
<TE>   Only by elevating culture through education of the masses in new
technology can a global economy really work for the global market.</TE>
<TE>   Anything less is a total rip-off, and any so-called "American"
company that sells out and goes offshore should be banished and
blackballed for killing another portion of the American economy here
at home.</TE>

<TE>   After reading about the export of more and more American jobs to
overseas locations, I imagine that U.S. workers must feel like this
is just another form of terrorism. In the end, won't it gut the
American worker base and devalue the dollar? Should profit come ahead
of loyalty and patriotism?</TE>

<HD>State's Private Prisons Face Closure Over Costs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your April 2 editorial, "Prison Guard Clout Endures," suggested that
the state's plan to close five privately run prisons was some kind of
political deal made with the correctional officers' union.</LD>
<LD>   That couldn't be further from the truth.</LD>
<LD>   The experience in California and other states with contract
prisons is that they are not cost-effective. We anticipate the state
will save $5.1 million annually when the contracts expire on June 30.
All of California's contract prisons were designed for
minimum-security inmates, and the state has a surplus of
minimum-security prison beds. Proposition 36, the drug diversion
initiative, is projected to reduce California's minimum-security
population by some 5,000 inmates in the next few years.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, contract prisons have been an administrative problem.
Although some have been well managed, others have employed poorly
trained staffs and have failed to provide programs for inmates that
are mandated by state law.</TE>
<TE>   Last November, all state agencies were asked to develop
recommendations for reducing budgets in response to the recession and
declining revenues. Closing the five contract prisons was one of our
agency's recommendations. The contract prisons are not suitable for
maximum-security prisoners, who comprise the fastest-growing segment
of our inmate population. We have proposed establishing a new
maximum-security prison in Delano to house those prisoners. Your
editorial referred to building "new public prisons at $500 million a
pop." The cost of building the Delano facility is projected at $335
million.</TE>

<LD>Re "Mahony Says Victims' Requests Led to Secrecy," April 3: Cardinal
Roger Mahony said that the current sexual abuse crisis in the Roman
Catholic Church is "one of the most difficult things" he has been
through. I do not feel his pain. Dealing with sexual abuse by a
priest or other authority figure is by far more grueling than trying
to handle a political crisis. After all, Mahony receives a salary and
(eventually) a pension for guiding his business through this storm.
We victims of clergy abuse have only memories. And these don't pay
the bills.</LD>

<TE>   Re Steve Lopez's column, "Victims Crushed in a Priestly Silence,"
April 3: Will someone from the Catholic Church please explain why
John Lenihan was not sent to prison for his very serious crime of
molesting a 14-year-old and subsequently causing her to become
pregnant? Is the church above the law? This whole case in itself is
so shocking as to be incomprehensible. And apparently this priest was
simply transferred to another church where he continued committing
the same crimes. It would seem the time has come for this man to
serve time.</TE>

<TE>   Re "'Lock 'Em Up' Isn't Enough," Commentary, April 1: I couldn't
believe that Jay Adams would still be singing that same old song:
treatment, not punishment, for sex offenders. After all, isn't the
mess the Catholic Church is in today exactly because some shrinks
convinced the church that sex offenders could be cured? How many
secular sex offenders have gone on to re-offend and even kill
innocent children?</TE>
<TE>   Adams tells us there are 60,000 sex offenders on parole or in
prison in California alone. (Kind of lessens the impact of 55
offending priests in the entire U.S., doesn't it?) He tells us this
to show how expensive it is to commit them. As the mother of a child
who was victimized at 6 years of age, I'd say it's worth it to keep
these creeps away from women and children.</TE>

<TE>   As a Catholic woman, I was excited when I read "A Cloud of Sexism
Over the Church" (Commentary, March 29). Thank you, professor Robert
McElvaine, for your insightful article. I believe that fear has
driven the leaders of my church to ignore the women, and celibacy is
very much a part of that fear.</TE>
<TE>   Women are the very heart of the church, holding responsible
positions and doing God's work. We are coming in the back door, so to
speak, as wives of ordained deacons. I am one of those women and have
seen a gradual acceptance of deacon couples in ministry. It seems a
shame that I was never ordained, having taken all the formation
training with my husband. In my heart I am ordained: "The two shall
be one."</TE>
<TE>   I hope one day to see optional celibacy and the ordination of
women. To paraphrase McElvaine: He and she will rise.</TE>

<LD>Thanks for reminding us about the "lost" freeways that were never
built, such as the Laurel Canyon Freeway ("Freeways' Missing Links
Can Frustrate Commuters," April 2). Although many believe that Los
Angeles has an extensive network of freeways, many more were planned
that would have greatly increased mobility across the region. In
fact, Los Angeles ranks near the bottom in freeway miles per capita
for U.S. urban areas. No wonder we have such crushing congestion!</LD>
<LD>   The Laurel Canyon Freeway would have provided a critical link from
the Valley into the Mid-Wilshire district and down to LAX. While many
extol the virtues of mass transit--and no one wants to live
right next to a freeway--over 95% of us are still dependent on
the freeways and major arterial surface streets.</LD>

<LD>Re President Bush's Thursday speech on the Middle East conflict:</LD>
<LD>   Finally, President Bush responded to national and international
calls for U.S. pressure on both sides of the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict that has claimed so many innocent lives. Sending Secretary
of State Colin Powell must be more than a symbolic gesture, and U.S.
insistence on Israeli withdrawal of troops from Palestinian cities
under siege must yield evidence that steps toward peace are possible.</LD>

<TE>   I must be missing something. Suicide bombers attack the United
States, and we bomb the whole country of Afghanistan. Suicide bombers
attack Israel, and when Israeli ground troops go into Palestine, we
tell them to get out. What right have we to do that? Especially
since, given the difference in the size of our populations, Israel
has had a greater percentage of its people killed than we have.</TE>
<TE>   Lorraine Knopf</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is sad that, at a time when the world is facing a true
calamity, Robert Satloff ("Don't Blame Bush: The Peace Process Was
Already in Ashes," Commentary, April 3) would make it a priority to
worry about President Bush's image instead of offering real
solutions.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, it is not relevant whose fault it is. How do we
solve the problem? Bush wanted to be the leader of the free world,
and he can't escape the responsibility that goes with that office.</TE>
<TE>   Sanford Thier</TE>
<TE>   Venice</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unless Bush stops all financial aid and delivery of U.S. military
goods to Israel, he is in effect holding out all Americans to the
world as accessories to Israeli war crimes against the Palestinians
and making us hostages to international terror. The security
interests of the American people require that the U.S. be a totally
neutral power broker in the Middle East. The decades-long alignment
with Israel has outlived any utility it might have had during the
Cold War and should be brought to a swift end, starting now.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Milo Somers</TE>
<TE>   Loma Linda</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the Middle East, the enemies of peace are on both sides. In
each case, they are those who strive for a one-state solution.
Tragically, neither side can achieve this without committing
atrocities. Neither side can afford to bequeath such a poisonous
legacy to its future generations. Let's implement the Saudi peace
proposal. It is almost too late--the breakdown of the values of
coexistence there imperils coexistence in our multinational,
multicultural and multireligious world everywhere. The world needs to
be a democracy of all its communities. Such a democracy is not easy
but still much better than any unilateralist alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Kotowski</TE>

<TE>   I want to tell the American people that not all Palestinians
support Yasser Arafat. There are many Palestinians like me who want
to live in peace with the Jews. A long time ago I didn't accept
Israel, but just as Mexico has long ago accepted that California will
never be returned, it is in the best interests of the Palestinian
people to do the same with Israel. Allah does not see suicide bombers
as martyrs. He sees them as murderers. There are many who fear for
their lives if they say they want to live in peace with the Jews.
Please remember that not all Muslims are terrorists and not all
Palestinians support Arafat.</TE>

<TE>   We are justified in judging the suicide bombings by Palestinian
extremists as despicable acts. However, the civilized world believes
in fairness and, therefore, it must offer a substitute method to
enable an occupied people to answer the excesses that inevitably
accompany a long-term military occupation. I suggest that we send the
Palestinians some of our civilized weapons along with military
advisors to teach them to bomb in a civilized way.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia May Sell Half Its Systems to Pay Debt</HD>
<DH>Cable: Founder agrees to offer operations including L.A.
assets, which could be valued at as much as $5 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To restore stability in the face of a plunging stock price, Adelphia
Communications Corp. plans to sell up to half of its cable systems,
worth as much as $8 billion, to pay off some of its debt, according
to investment bankers in contact with the company's advisors.</LD>
<LD>   John Rigas, the 77-year-old founder of Adelphia, has agreed to put
up for sale operations including his prized Los Angeles systems,
which he acquired only two years ago, sources close to the company
said.</LD>
<LD>   Investment bankers say the company could sell systems serving 3
million of its nearly 6 million cable subscribers nationwide. The Los
Angeles systems, which serve 1.3million subscribers, could sell for a
respectable sum--as much as $5billion--because they are in the most
desirable neighborhoods. However, Rigas could face a big tax bill on
any cash sale, reducing the company's proceeds.</LD>
<TE>   Late Thursday night, Adelphia, the nation's sixth-largest cable
company, confirmed the hiring of Salomon Smith Barney, Credit Suisse
First Boston and Bank of America to help sell cable assets to reduce
the company's nearly $15billion in debt. The Adelphia board,
controlled by the Rigas family, which owns and manages the company,
met before the announcement for a status report from the advisors,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's shares have plummeted 51% since Rigas officials
disclosed last week that the company had guaranteed $2.3 billion in
loans to off-balance-sheet partnerships owned by the family.
Adelphia's shares fell $1.04 on Thursday to close at $10 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether
Adelphia properly disclosed the off-balance-sheet practices. More
than 10 class-action shareholder suits have been filed against the
Rigas family and Adelphia, which is based in Coudersport, Pa.
Shareholders claim the Rigases violated securities laws and misled
investors by failing to disclose that the firm guaranteed loans to
family-owned partnerships that used the money to buy Adelphia
securities.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a group of dissident Adelphia shareholders is
pressuring the family to step down from day-to-day management because
of conflicts of interest. Wall Street sources said the group is being
led by Gordon Crawford, an influential Los Angeles money manager at
Capital Research &amp; Management, which owns 4.7% of Adelphia. Crawford
has assembled a group that represents more than 50% of shareholders,
sources say.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard no support [for the Rigases] in any quarter," said
Wallace Weitz, one of Adelphia's biggest shareholders. Weitz is part
of the dissident group, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford's plan is to bring in a new management team, led by cable
pioneer Leonard Tow, to replace Rigas, Adelphia's chairman and chief
executive, as well as Rigas' three sons, all of whom are top
executives at the company.</TE>
<TE>   But because the Rigas family controls Adelphia's voting shares,
any management shake-up may be hard to achieve.</TE>
<TE>   Tow, who along with Rigas helped build today's cable industry,
knows Adelphia intimately. Tow became Adelphia's largest independent
shareholder, with a 10% stake today, after the 1999 sale of his
company, Century Communications Corp., whose largest cable operations
were in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Tow nor Crawford would comment.</TE>

<HD>Fewer Can Buy Homes</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Percentage of state's residents able to afford
a median-price home falls to the lowest level in five months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Housing affordability in California dropped in February to its lowest
level in five months as double-digit price appreciation pushed more
properties out of the reach of potential buyers, the California Assn.
of Realtors reported Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The percentage of households in California able to afford a
median-price home fell 5 percentage points to 31%, meaning that less
than a third of the state's residents have enough income to buy such
a home.</LD>
<LD>   "These [affordability] rates are not the lowest we've gone, but
they're heading in a dangerous direction," said CAR President Robert
Bailey. "We're freezing people out of the home-buying market again."</LD>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the median price for a home in February
rose 18.8% over last year to $267,000, according the CAR figures,
resulting in a 5-percentage-point drop in affordability to 33%. In
Orange County, where the median home price rose 12.3% last month to
$370,000, affordability dropped 1 percentage point to 30%.</TE>
<TE>   Though nowhere near the historic lows that marked the housing boom
of 1989-1991--affordability in California was 21% in 1989--the
current slide is expected to force a drop in housing stock as anxious
buyers race to buy homes before prices go still higher.</TE>
<TE>   Lagging new-home construction and spiraling prices have created a
26-point affordability difference between California and the rest of
the nation, where affordability has held steady at 57% over the last
several months.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just outrageous," said Ira Spears, an agent at Century 21
Grisham-Joseph in Whittier. "Working-class people can't afford a
starter home at $300,000. I'm finding that ... large families are
looking for small houses or condos again."</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, a home buyer in Los Angeles County would have had to
earn at least $59,046 a year to afford a median-price home of
$224,700, according to CAR data. Today, that buyer would have to earn
$68,252 for the same home, which now sells for $267,000.</TE>
<TE>   Last month's low mortgage interest rate of 6.85%, which
historically would have given the affordability index a boost, was
not enough to offset the huge increase in the median price of a home
in California, which was up almost 20% from a year ago, at $289,550,
Bailey said.</TE>
<TE>   "At this pace, we're going to see a further drop in the supply,"
Bailey said. "This market is out of balance."</TE>

<HD>Breakup of Andersen Gains Steam</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Much of tax group will join Deloitte. Other
partners discuss forming their own firms or joining rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accounting firm Andersen moved closer Thursday to transforming itself
into a leaner, audit-oriented firm by agreeing to sell much of its
U.S. tax practice to Deloitte &amp; Touche and preparing for the layoff
of as many as 7,000 workers next week.</LD>
<LD>   But the firm also is perilously close to splintering in the U.S.
as partners in almost every domestic office participate in talks to
spin out into their own firms or to bolt in groups to both larger and
smaller rivals.</LD>
<LD>   Talks include individual partners looking to take their book of
clients to a new firm, industry and specialty groups within offices
looking to move en masse and groups of Andersen offices looking to
band together to form regional firms.</LD>
<TE>   "I would be hard pressed to tell you of an Andersen office that is
not in discussions at this moment with another Big Five, national or
regional firm," said Allan Koltin, a Chicago consultant working with
several Andersen offices to help structure some of the deals.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the beginning of the endgame," Koltin said. "We are going
to see other deals announced now, and soon, essentially the majority
of Andersen will be spoken for."</TE>
<TE>   The transactions endanger a plan by former Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul A. Volcker to reinvent Andersen as a smaller firm
focusing on audits and tax preparation.</TE>
<TE>   Koltin and others are examining ways to shield new partnerships
from Andersen's liabilities. The accounting firm is a target of
lawsuits for its work for companies such as energy trader Enron Corp.
and telecommunications concern Global Crossing Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing the transaction with Deloitte, which will get
roughly 350 of Andersen's 560 tax partners and many of its offices,
neither firm said how they planned to deal with the liability issue.</TE>
<TE>   Koltin said a template is developing by which acquiring firms will
pay into a fund that would free them from liability, possibly through
the structure of a formal bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen called the Deloitte deal "an agreement in principle,"
which it anticipates will be completed by the end of this month.
Deloitte described the deal as a "memorandum," adding that "the two
firms continue to work through the issues and the agreement is
subject to due diligence."</TE>
<TE>   Terms were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   People familiar with the transaction said Deloitte will pick up
only a portion of the business, mostly in the big cities. Some of the
specialty practices within the tax group and some of the smaller
offices have been told they can now go out and cut their own deals
with other firms.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear whether all of the Andersen tax partners will go
along with the transaction. A similar agreement for Andersen to
transfer its overseas partnerships to KPMG fell apart after
individual practices overseas decided to cut deals with other firms.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts by Andersen partners to find new business homes has
intensified in the last week as the firm's international structure
disintegrated and as a stream of client defections has turned into a
flood.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has lost about $500 million of its $4.3 billion in U.S.
revenue since Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December and
expects to lose an additional $500 million in the near term,
according to internal estimates. The expected layoff could extend to
as much as 25% of Andersen's 28,000 U.S. employees. Sources said
Andersen's Chicago headquarters will be especially hard hit.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is struggling to survive a criminal indictment on an
obstruction-of-justice charge for destroying Enron-related documents
sought in a federal probe. A trial is scheduled for May 6, but many
clients are not waiting to see if the firm is proven innocent. They
are hiring other auditors out of fear that Andersen won't have the
critical mass to conduct large global audits even if it does survive
the federal indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has handed control of the firm to Volcker, who is trying
to execute a rescue plan. Success of the Volcker proposal is
contingent on the Department of Justice suspending or dismissing its
indictment and on settlement of the class-action lawsuits. Volcker
said he would scuttle much of Andersen's tax consulting practice to
transform the firm into a company that primarily provides auditing
and tax preparation services.</TE>
<TE>   An Andersen source said the intervention of a federal mediator has
resulted in some progress in settlement talks between the firm and
attorneys representing Enron investors and employees.</TE>
<TE>   The source acknowledged that multiple merger talks were taking
place among Andersen's scattered offices but said it was clear during
a three-hour teleconference for partners Thursday that there was
still considerable support for the Volcker plan.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Gorrell, managing partner of the U.S. Andersen partnership,
said the deal announced with Deloitte on Thursday was "consistent"
with Volcker's vision for the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "While our firm will retain appropriate tax expertise in a manner
consistent with these reforms, Deloitte will provide a significant
number of our people with continuing career opportunities and our
clients with continued quality service from recognized and respected
professionals,'' Gorrell said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Andersen partner who supports the plan said core staff
are working hard to implement the proposal, but virtually all
involved see it as a "long shot."</TE>
<TE>   Based on conversations with partners, Koltin said the Volcker plan
has "tepid support at best" and that most partners would rather move
to a new or existing firm. He said partners hoping to form regional
firms believe they can create organizations that will keep many
mid-market accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Many partners have hired bankruptcy attorneys, either individually
or in groups, to examine how they can use payments to what would
remain of the Andersen partnership to relieve the new or acquiring
firms of Enron and other liabilities, Koltin said.</TE>
<TE>   Legal theories abound over how to best deal with the liability
issue, said Bob Bunting, chairman of Moss Adams, the nation's
12th-largest accounting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Bunting said that although the bankruptcy route might provide the
most security, its time-consuming nature might not staunch the
dissolution of business quickly enough so that deals could get done.</TE>
<TE>   Moss Adams, which is actively pursuing groups of Andersen
partners, is wrestling with the liability issue but believes it might
be solved by a wide enough splintering of the Andersen firm.</TE>
<TE>   "If you buy a piece of the business and pay a fair market value
for it, that might work," Bunting said. "But no one has ever done
this before, so there are a lot of what ifs."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's partnership rules require a payment of $1.50 for every
$1 in annual recurring revenue that a partner takes from the firm.
But Koltin and others expect that the partnership will agree to drop
that threshold by half because the price is too high for the risk
involved in purchasing a piece of Andersen's U.S. business.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Andersen Worldwide, the confederation of the 84
Andersen partnerships, said Thursday that Aldo Cardoso was named
acting chief executive. Cardoso succeeds Joseph Berardino, who said
in March he would step aside to make way for the Volcker plan.</TE>
<TE>   Cardoso, based in Paris, will continue to serve simultaneously as
chairman of the Andersen Worldwide Board of Partners. Cardoso's main
role at Andersen Worldwide will be to oversee the orderly mergers of
the overseas partnerships with rival accounting firms.</TE>

<HD>Enron CEO: Big Pay, Big Task</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. won Bankruptcy Court approval Thursday to pay $1.32
million a year to its new chief executive after the Securities and
Exchange Commission and a Florida pension plan dropped objections.</LD>
<LD>   The job for restructuring specialist Stephen F. Cooper could prove
as big as the payday: Piece together a much smaller company that can
emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings or find a way to divvy up the
paltry leftovers to the satisfaction of creditors.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC and the Florida State Board of Administration dropped
their protests to the hiring of Cooper after his employment contract
was amended to provide more protections for creditors and investors
and eliminate a $5-million bonus.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, Enron agreed to support the naming of a special
examiner with broad investigatory powers to examine the energy
company's downfall. Lawyers for the various parties reached a
tentative agreement during a private conference Thursday with U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, who is expected to enter the
order early next week.</TE>
<TE>   "Paying Cooper $1.32 million is not that bad. I suspect that's a
relative bargain for what he's got to pull off," said Chris
Ellinghaus, an energy analyst with Williams Capital in New York.
Cooper, a principal with New York consulting firm Zolfo Cooper, has
said he intends to sell assets and reorganize Enron as a much smaller
company focusing on natural-gas pipelines and power plants, but the
details of his plan remain a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   After Gonzalez approved his contract Thursday, Cooper told
reporters outside the New York courthouse that his goal is to bring
Enron out of bankruptcy "as quickly as humanly possible," suggesting
that a year might be enough time.</TE>
<TE>   That would be an extraordinarily quick trip for the largest U.S.
corporate bankruptcy ever filed. Complicating matters, the Enron
bankruptcy has become enormously contentious as creditors and law
firms have taken potshots at each other in recent weeks, claiming
conflicts of interest, and the SEC has weighed in on an early version
of Cooper's employment contract using unusually harsh language.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Cooper can salvage a version of Enron and repay the more
than $31 billion owed to creditors is the subject of great skepticism
in the investment community. But progress is being made, Enron
watchers believe.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper, who has steered dozens of companies through bankruptcy
proceedings, has "turbocharged" Enron's efforts to reorganize, Enron
bankruptcy lawyer Martin Bienenstock said in court Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   So far, through a series of piecemeal deals, Enron has reached
agreements to sell assets that would bring in more than $2 billion in
cash and has indicated that up to $9 billion in assets will be shed
over the next year. Before Cooper's hiring Jan. 29, Enron sold its
core energy trading business to UBS Warburg in a no-cash deal that
would give Enron a cut of any future profit.</TE>
<TE>   With Cooper at the helm, the company has announced plans to close
its broadband system, which will save $2.5 million a year, has
successfully negotiated the removal of top executives and directors
associated with Enron's meltdown and has proposed a novel way to keep
crucial employees by linking bonuses to how much cash is raised
through asset sales.</TE>
<TE>   Enron executives also have hinted they might not sell Portland
General Electric, the Oregon utility promised to Portland-based
Northwest Natural Gas Co. in a $3-billion deal that has been pending
for several months.</TE>
<TE>   But doubters abound. Even if Cooper reorganizes Enron into a
natural-gas pipeline and power company, it would be fairly small in
an industry where bigger is seen as better, said Andre Meade, a
utilities analyst with Commerzbank Securities in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The brief furor over Cooper's employment contract illustrated how
heated Enron's bankruptcy proceedings have become.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC blasted the contract as too generous and riddled with
conflicts of interest because many on Enron's creditor committee are
current or former clients of Zolfo Cooper, or investors in a fund run
by Cooper.</TE>
<TE>   The terms of the contract, which did not require Cooper to take on
the fiduciary responsibilities of a corporate officer, "cast doubt on
the fairness of Enron's handling of its bankruptcy case and on the
bankruptcy process as a whole," the SEC said in its objection filed
last month.</TE>
<TE>   The Florida State Board of Administration, the pension plan that
lost $334 million through Enron investments, also questioned Cooper's
independence and sought a trustee to replace him at the helm of the
Houston company.</TE>
<TE>   The pension plan and other shareholders are troubled that many of
the big banks on Enron's creditor committee, which selected Cooper to
run Enron, had a role in some of Enron's infamous off-balance-sheet
partnerships, said Florida pension plan lawyer Andrew J. Entwistle,
who called them "aiders and abettors" of Enron's alleged accounting
frauds.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the objections were eliminated when Cooper agreed to
assume fiduciary duties at Enron, recuse himself from decisions

<LD>Cable television prices increased at more than twice the rate of
inflation in the 12 months ended last July 1, according to a Federal
Communications Commission report.</LD>
<LD>   The average monthly rate for basic and expanded cable programming
and related equipment rose 7.5% to $36.99 from $34.42, the FCC said.
The consumer price index, a measure of inflation, rose 3.2% over the
same period.</LD>
<LD>   The 7.5% increase in cable television costs follows a 5.8% rise in
the same period a year earlier, the FCC's annual cable television

<HD>EchoStar, Disney Settle Programming Dispute</HD>
<DH>Television: The satellite broadcaster agrees to restore
ESPN Classic and continue carrying ABC Family cable channel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Satellite broadcaster EchoStar Communications Corp. settled a legal
fight with Walt Disney Co. on Thursday, agreeing to restore
Disney-owned ESPN Classic to its nationwide system and continue
carrying the company's ABC Family cable channel.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute began in December, when EchoStar threatened to stop
broadcasting ABC Family. EchoStar, the No. 2 satellite company, then
dropped the ESPN Classic channel Jan. 1.</LD>
<LD>   EchoStar argued that it had the right to stop carrying ABC Family
because the channel changed owners. EchoStar also cited weak ratings
and the need to make room for additional channels because of new
federal rules that require satellite providers to carry all local
broadcast channel in their markets.</LD>
<TE>   Disney sued to block EchoStar from dropping ABC Family, which
Disney bought in November as part of a $5.2-billion deal with News
Corp. In January, a federal judge temporarily barred EchoStar from
dropping ABC Family, pending resolution of the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said EchoStar also objected to Disney's proposed rate
hikes for ESPN Classic, which it delivered to 4 million customers.</TE>
<TE>   Disney argued that EchoStar was using the threat of removing ABC
Family as a ploy to lower fees and had no justification for quitting
the 10-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   Under the settlement, EchoStar said it would restore ESPN Classic
by mid-month.</TE>
<TE>   Disney also dropped an action filed in federal court in Miami
against EchoStar related to the broadcasting of local channels and
the regions in which it is allowed to show specific channels.</TE>
<TE>   Company representatives would not discuss further details of the
settlement. Sources close to the matter said neither side had much to
gain by continuing the fight.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute came at a bad time for Disney, which was in the midst
of relaunching ABC Family as a secondary outlet for programs from its
ABC broadcast network. And EchoStar is trying to win government
approval for a takeover of its larger rival Hughes Electronics Corp.,
which owns DirecTV.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar, meanwhile, confirmed Thursday that it would stop
marketing Internet access using satellites, a service promoted as
justification for the company's planned $33-billion purchase of
Hughes. The company said the service was uneconomical.</TE>
<TE>   Disney shares rose 12 cents to $22.56 on the New York Stock
Exchange; EchoStar gained 51 cents to $27.73 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>FCC Chairman Sets New Deadlines for Digital Technology</HD>
<DH>Media: To increase usage, major TV networks are asked to
provide at least 50% of their prime-time shows in the format.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the transition to digital TV stuck in low gear, a top federal
regulator Thursday tried to prod cable and satellite operators, set
manufacturers, broadcasters and networks to pick up the pace.</LD>
<LD>   Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael K. Powell laid
out a new set of voluntary deadlines, calling for more digital
programming this fall and more support from cable and satellite
services by Jan. 1. He also urged set manufacturers to build digital
tuners in at least half their big-screen sets by 2004.</LD>
<LD>   The deadlines were included in letters Powell sent to the chairmen
and other leading members of the House and Senate Commerce
committees. Although they aren't binding, they provide a measuring
stick for Congress to judge the various players' commitment to
digital TV.</LD>
<TE>   The letters don't address the biggest barrier for consumers: the
high price of digital TV sets. To watch a local broadcaster's digital
channel, consumers typically must spend at least $2,000, which is
eight times the average price of a conventional color TV.</TE>
<TE>   But they do answer one of the biggest complaints by local TV
stations, which Powell is scheduled to face next week at the annual
National Assn. of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   When the FCC mandated the switch to digital in 1997, its
regulations applied only to local broadcasters, not to any of the
other groups that could make or break the transition.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC gave commercial stations until May 1 to have a digital
signal on the air. But more than three-fourths of those stations
probably will miss that deadline, and well under 1% of all homes have
the special receivers needed to tune in local digital signals.</TE>
<TE>   Many policymakers and industry groups have blasted the sluggish
shift to digital, with broadcasters, cable operators, set
manufacturers and programmers accusing the others of undermining the
new format.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasters have lobbied hard for federal action, imploring the
FCC to require cable and satellite operators to carry the local
digital stations and to force TV manufacturers to include digital
tuners in their sets.</TE>
<TE>   Powell, whom President Bush appointed chairman of the commission
last year, has favored imposing fewer regulations. His letters,
however, pressure the various industry segments to increase their
support for digital TV or risk being slapped by Washington with a new
set of requirements.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Powell called on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, HBO and
Showtime to provide at least half of their prime-time programs in
high-definition TV or other enhanced digital TV format, starting in
the 2002-2003 season. All but Fox and NBC already may do that.</TE>
<TE>   Starting next year, Powell said, cable and satellite operators
should carry as many as five channels that meet the 50% level. And
set manufacturers should include digital tuners in all their sets by
the end of 2006, with earlier deadlines set for large and mid-size
screens.</TE>
<TE>   Powell's effort drew guarded praise from broadcasters, cable and
satellite operators and set manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good for the chairman to return the spotlight to this
issue," said Jeffrey A. Joseph, a spokesman for the Consumer
Electronics Assn. But he added, "We have some great concerns about
the tuner [deadlines].... These voluntary things have a funny way of
finding their way into legislative or regulatory mandates."</TE>

<HD>Edison Chief's Earnings Doubled to $3 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edison International Chief Executive John E. Bryson's pay nearly
doubled to $3.12 million last year as the utility owner swung to a
$1.03-billion profit.</LD>
<LD>   Bryson's base salary remained unchanged at $950,000, according to
a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He
received a $1.35-million bonus after forfeiting one in 2000 because
of the California power crisis. Other compensation rose to $818,000
from $650,000 a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Edison owns Southern California Edison, California's No. 2
electric utility, which incurred billions of dollars of costs in the
fourth quarter of 2000 and the first half of last year after paying
more for power than state law allowed the utility to charge
customers. Electricity prices had soared, partly because of a
regional drought and a lack of new generators.</LD>
<TE>   The filing said the compensation committee considered Bryson's
leadership during the power crisis and his successful effort to keep
the management team in place and communicate with policymakers,
shareholders, staff and customers.</TE>
<TE>   The filing also cited the talks leading up to the utility's
settlement with state regulators. Southern California Edison reached
an agreement with the Public Utilities Commission in October to use a
portion of customer bills to pay billions of dollars in debt. Last
month, Edison paid $5.5 billion in debt using $1.8billion in loans
and cash on hand.</TE>
<TE>   Edison reported 2001 per-share earnings of $3.18. It posted a loss
of $1.94 billion, or $5.84 a share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Bryson didn't receive any stock options as compensation last year.
In 2000, he got 1.27 million options.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Rosemead-based Edison rose 5 cents to $16.80 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>President Pushes Lawmakers to Expand Trade</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Bush seeks 'fast-track' authority. Democrats
want help for U.S. workers hurt by foreign competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Thursday gave Congress less than three weeks to act
on legislation to expand U.S. trade, but Democrats said no progress
was possible until the administration agreed to help workers laid off
because of foreign competition.</LD>
<LD>   Bush challenged the Senate to begin work by April 22 on two
controversial bills. One would give him "fast-track" authority to
negotiate new trade agreements, and the other would grant trade
preferences to Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador.</LD>
<LD>   The president said U.S. credibility and South American stability
were at stake. "These bills are good for America; these bills are
good for our friends," Bush said in a speech to State Department
officials.</LD>
<TE>   But he was silent on a third measure that Senate Democrats insist
must be part of the legislative package: more aid for U.S. workers
who lose their jobs because of imports.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats said they were willing to approve the fast-track
and Andean trade legislation by Memorial Day, but only if the deal
included additional trade adjustment assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "The political reality is that other legislation to expand trade
simply cannot move until action is taken on trade adjustment
assistance," said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus
(D-Mont.).</TE>
<TE>   The exchange reflected an effort by Bush, whose free-trade
credentials were tarnished by his recent decision to slap big tariffs
on foreign steel, to shift the spotlight to what he characterized as
congressional foot-dragging on trade.</TE>
<TE>   But some congressional aides and trade experts said the strategy
could backfire if it creates the impression the president had no
compassion for Americans whose lives were disrupted by trade
expansion.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the problems with free trade is we never compensate the
losers," said Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy
Institute, a corporate-financed think tank. "We always say that there
are more winners than losers, and that's true. But there are losers,
and we're not helping them."</TE>
<TE>   Fast-track authority, which lapsed in 1994, would let the
president negotiate trade agreements that Congress could accept or
reject but not amend. "While we've been marking time, our competitors
have been working," Bush said. "While we have been delaying, they've
been trading."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he needed fast track to advance U.S. interests in a new
round of global trade talks, negotiate a hemisphere-wide Free Trade
Agreement of the Americas and complete pending trade pacts with
Chile, Singapore and other countries.</TE>
<TE>   Even more pressing, Bush said, is congressional action on renewing
the Andean Trade Preferences Act, which let Colombia, Peru, Bolivia
and Ecuador ship some products to the United States duty-free until
it expired in December.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has temporarily waived tariffs on imports from the four
countries, but the deferral will end May 16--hence the April 22
deadline for Senate action.</TE>
<TE>   The president, who recently visited South America, said Andean
leaders told him the trade preferences helped provide economic
alternatives to cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   The president's remarks contained no reference to the future of
U.S. workers whose jobs are eliminated when U.S. firms shut down or
move operations to other countries in response to low-cost imports.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1962, the government has provided extended unemployment
benefits, vocational training and other services to trade-displaced
workers. About 35,000 Americans received such assistance in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats want to renew the program, which expired late
last year, and expand it to farmers, fishermen and workers in
"secondary" industries affected by increased imports.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has advocated a limited expansion of trade
adjustment assistance. But it wants to deal with the issue after the
fast-track and Andean trade measures have been enacted.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's silence on the issue was not an oversight, insisted one
Democratic aide who requested anonymity. "We pushed them pretty hard
to mention [it] in the president's speech today," he said. "It wasn't
like it was just forgotten."</TE>

<HD>Gemstar CEO Offers Stock for Debt</HD>
<DH>Media: Henry Yuen pledges 7 million shares as loan
collateral to avoid having to sell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc., which disclosed this week that
it booked as revenue money it hoped to win in a lawsuit, said
Thursday that Chief Executive Henry Yuen pledged 7 million of his
Gemstar shares to pay back money he borrowed in October to exercise
stock options.</LD>
<LD>   The deal will allow him to avoid having to sell stock, Yuen said.</LD>
<LD>   With the bank loan coming due and the stock price falling 27% this
week in the wake of the firm's accounting controversies, Yuen
renegotiated the loan terms Wednesday to increase the number of
shares being used as collateral and to give him up to two years to
repay the debt.</LD>
<TE>   The company did not disclose the amount of the loan or other
details. Some of the proceeds from the loan were used for personal
debts, which the company also declined to disclose.</TE>
<TE>   Yuen owns or has options to buy 31.8 million shares of the
Pasadena company, which publishes TV Guide magazine and makes
software that runs on-screen television program guides.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar said Yuen's debts "are unrelated to and are not
obligations of Gemstar."</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday Gemstar also said its board had extended its
authorization for the company to buy back as much as $300 million of
its stock.</TE>
<TE>   Before Yuen's loan and the buyback were announced Gemstar shares
rose $1.27 to $10.87 in regular Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Stacey Bingler Forbes at Janco Partners Inc. in Denver
said the company was being cautious in releasing information the day
after Yuen completed his new loan arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   "The company didn't want to panic the market when it sees 7
million shares out there, and it also wanted to show that Henry is
confident the stock price will come back," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The stock has been particularly volatile this year. It started out
the year at $28.04, lost about 40% in a month, rebounded and then
slid by Monday to half its value from year's start.</TE>
<TE>   The stock plummeted 37% on Tuesday to a three-year low of $9.01
after Gemstar disclosed it had booked as revenue $107.6 million in
accounts receivable due from Scientific-Atlanta Inc., a maker of TV
set-top boxes, that is the subject of a patent dispute with the
company.</TE>
<TE>   The receivables represent license fees that Gemstar says it's owed
by Scientific-Atlanta. Scientific-Atlanta has said it doesn't owe any
patent fees to Gemstar and hasn't paid them.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very aggressive accounting," said analyst T.K. Mackay at
Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. "That issue is much more of a concern
for us than the chief executive's loans."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts criticized Gemstar for failing to disclose the revenue
sources sooner.</TE>
<TE>   Investor concerns about accounting have increased after
undisclosed debt led to Enron Corp. making the largest U.S.
bankruptcy filing. KPMG audited and approved Gemstar's financial
statements.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar said Thursday that it's in compliance with securities laws
and will "vigorously defend" the actions brought against it.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday the company was hit with three more lawsuits filed by
shareholders, claiming that Gemstar improperly booked revenue that it
won't receive unless it wins litigation against a rival.</TE>
<TE>   One suit, filed by Wolf Popper in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles, said Gemstar's financial results were "artificially inflated
by the improper recognition" of the expected $107.6 million in
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit said the revenue was not assured and caused Gemstar's
stock to "trade at inflated prices." The suit said the company
improperly recorded more than $100 million in revenue associated with
the litigation, citing a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Separate lawsuits were filed against Gemstar by firms Robbins,
Umeda &amp; Fink and by Schiffrin &amp; Barroway. Those suits claim that
Gemstar misled shareholders by booking $20 million in revenue last
year from a swap of intellectual property for advertising on its
on-screen program guides. Representatives of Robbins Umeda and
Schiffrin &amp; Barroway couldn't be reached to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Another suit was filed against Gemstar on Wednesday by William
Lerach, who also is the lead attorney for shareholders suing Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer James S. Granelli contributed to this report
and Bloomberg News was used in compiling it.</TE>

<HD>Carlyle Group May Make Asia Global Crossing Bid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Carlyle Group and other investors may bid at least $250 million for
Asia Global Crossing Ltd., which operates undersea communications
cables in Asia, the Asian Wall Street Journal reported, citing
unidentified sources.</LD>
<LD>   Carlyle, a U.S. private equity firm with more than $12.5 billion
of assets, may team up with Emerging Markets Partnership, Citic
Pacific Ltd. and Softbank Asia Infrastructure Fund to try to buy Asia
Global Crossing, the paper said.</LD>
<LD>   "We are talking to several people, but I can't say if it's any of
those folks," said Madelyn Smith, a spokeswoman for Asia Global
Crossing. Christopher Ullman, a Carlyle spokesman, declined to
comment.</LD>
<TE>   Asia Global Crossing is 58% owned by Global Crossing Ltd., which
filed for bankruptcy protection in January with $12.4 billion in
debt. Asia Global Crossing hired financial advisor Lazard Freres to
raise funds after sales slumped and Global Crossing refused in
December to lend it $400million.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies missed a Monday deadline for submitting a required
report on sales, profit and other information to the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. The companies cited investigations into the
parent company's accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., controlled by billionaire Li Ka-shing, and
state-owned Singapore Technologies Telemedia Ltd. own stakes in Asia
Global Crossing and have offered to buy 79% of the parent for $750
million.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft Corp. and Softbank Corp., Japan's biggest Internet
investor, each own 14.9% of Asia Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't comment on speculation and rumors about potential
investments," said Microsoft spokesman Mark Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   In related news, Asia Global Crossing said it has reached
agreement with KDDI Corp. and NEC Corp. on easing payment schedules
on loans.</TE>
<TE>   Asia Global Crossing will pay the cable unit of KDDI $45 million
this year instead of the $95 million it was due to pay.</TE>
<TE>   NEC was owed $240 million this year by Asia Global Crossing. The
new agreement spreads that payment out until 2005.</TE>

<HD>Gumbel Is Saying Goodbye to Morning TV</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Co-host of the third-place 'The Early Show'
is ready to 'turn the page' on his professional life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>After nearly two decades in morning television, Bryant Gumbel quit
Thursday as co-anchor of CBS' third-place "The Early Show," saying he
wants to do something else with his life.</LD>
<LD>   Gumbel's contract with CBS expires in May and negotiations hadn't
been going smoothly, leading to increasing speculation in recent
weeks that he might leave.</LD>
<LD>   No replacement was named and the anchor's departure date has yet
to be set, but the show is expected to continue with its current
format. "I don't anticipate a radical redesign of the program," CBS
News President Andrew Heyward said.</LD>
<TE>   The morning program, launched 21/2 years ago on the Viacom
Inc.-owned network, remains well behind General Electric Co. unit
NBC's "Today" show and "Good Morning America," on Walt Disney Co.'s
ABC, in the ratings race.</TE>
<TE>   CBS has long struggled in the morning time slots, where change in
viewing patterns is slow. The program has benefited from a
synergistic relationship with CBS' hit "Survivor," as the booted
contestants came on each week to talk about their experiences. Profit
has jumped to an estimated $50million, up from about $8million to
$10million.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the show, which averaged 2.7 million viewers in the first
quarter of 2002, draws less than half the audience of 6.4 million
watching ratings leader "Today" and is well below the 4.8 million
averaged by "Good Morning America." Both also bring in substantially
higher profits--an estimated $250 million in the case of "Today,"
which runs for three hours, compared with two for both CBS and ABC.
The morning has become more important for the networks as the
economics of prime-time television become more challenging.</TE>
<TE>   Heyward nevertheless stressed that it was Gumbel's decision to
move on and thanked the anchor for helping make CBS more competitive
in the morning. Pointing to Gumbel's pending second marriage, Heyward
said, "I take him at his word that he wants to start a new chapter in
life.... It's an intense, demanding existence."</TE>
<TE>   "Bryant put this show on the map," said Steve Friedman, the show's
senior executive producer who previously worked with Gumbel at
"Today," where Gumbel anchored for 15 years. Friedman said he
believes "there were circumstances that came up in the negotiations
that led Bryant to believe it wasn't worth it, not money-wise, but
time-wise, commitment-wise. He only knows one way to do it, and
that's 100%."</TE>
<TE>   Gumbel, 53, is expected to continue to anchor HBO's "Real Sports."
He wasn't available for comment and declined to discuss his plans,
saying in a statement, "As I prepare to begin a new chapter in my
personal life, it makes sense to me to turn the page on my
professional life as well. Morning television has been a wonderful
experience for me, but there are other interests that I'm eager to
pursue."</TE>
<TE>   Gumbel joined CBS in 1997, but the prime-time magazine built
around him, "Public Eye," never clicked. CBS--paying him about
$5million a year--pushed him to return to mornings, surrounded by a
new $30-million street-side studio in New York and paired with
co-host Jane Clayson.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite his reputation as a brilliant interviewer and success
at "Today," Gumbel's morning viewers didn't really seek him out
again. For every viewer who appreciated his interviewing skills,
there were others who found his style too prickly. Many CBS affiliate
station managers were unhappy with him in the job, feeling that the
show would never grow beyond third place.</TE>
<TE>   Gumbel's exit gives CBS an opportunity to improve the show's
fortunes, but it will be a difficult opening to exploit. CBS will be
hard-pressed to find any star of his stature to fill the post, which
could mean a slow rebuilding process. "There's a lot of work ahead,"
Friedman said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the morning competition has gotten more complex in the
last six months as Fox News Channel and CNN, with new anchor Paula
Zahn, have made gains.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is an opportunity if CBS chooses to seize it," said
"GMA" executive producer Shelley Ross, who called Gumbel "one of the
great interviewers" in the business. "Once they decide on someone
there'll be the excitement and a flurry of publicity. Then it'll
settle back and they'll be in a rebuilding phase."</TE>
<TE>   NBC declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Clayson's contract is up in the fall. Executives didn't provide
any concrete assurances that she would remain with the program, but
they are likely to want some consistency. "We're not contemplating
wholesale changes based on Bryant's departure," Heyward said.</TE>
<TE>   Clayson pointed out that the show's ratings have steadily
improved. "In a business where viewers' habits change at a glacial
pace, that's pretty good," she said, adding, "I look forward to being
a part of the show, whoever sits next to me."</TE>
<TE>   Heyward said it was too early to talk about a short list of
replacements, but a number of names were being floated anyway. The
network already had put out feelers to frequent substitute anchor Jim
Nantz, a CBS Sports commentator, industry executives said, but it's
unlikely he's interested.</TE>
<TE>   CBS News' Russ Mitchell and game show host Tom Bergeron also have
substituted. Other names included correspondent Jon Frankel; Antonio
Mora, who just left as "Good Morning America's" news reader for an
anchor job at CBS' Chicago station; and Jack Ford, who recently left
ABC when a "GMA" post didn't come through. Some also think CBS could
turn to White House correspondent John Roberts, long considered a
possible heir to Dan Rather's evening news chair.</TE>
<TE>   "This would be a good place to groom someone to be Dan's
replacement," said news consultant Andrew Tyndall, who monitors the
network newscasts. He added that CBS, having failed with a big star
in Gumbel, might try to "promote from within and pocket the
difference in salary."</TE>
<TE>   Gumbel is expected to work out the timing of his departure in the
next week.</TE>

<HD>Shoemaker Sentenced for IPO Scheme</HD>
<DH>Courts: Steven Madden admitted to conspiring with two
brokerage firms to inflate share prices from 1994 to 1997.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steven Madden, who parlayed platform sneakers and other trendy
footwear for young women into a $200-million-a-year business, was
sentenced Thursday to 41 months in prison for manipulating initial
public offerings.</LD>
<LD>   Madden, the former chief executive of the company that bears his
name, admitted last year that he conspired with two brokerages to
inflate IPO share prices. The scheme earned him $3.1 million and cost
investors almost $100 million, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in Manhattan ordered Madden to
serve 41 months in federal prison and pay $3.1 million in
restitution. Madden could have received as many as 51 months.</LD>
<TE>   "I was guilty of stupidity, arrogance, greed," Madden told the
judge.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want the chance to get back my name."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate case, Madden has pleaded guilty in Brooklyn to
federal securities charges.</TE>
<TE>   He will be sentenced later this month to a concurrent jail term of
41 months, his lawyer, Joel Winograd, said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Long Island City, N.Y.-based Steven Madden Ltd. rose 16
cents to $17.34 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The sentence was announced after the markets closed. Madden will
resign as the company's chief of creative activities before he
reports to prison Aug. 15.</TE>
<TE>   In his guilty plea, Madden admitted his involvement in fraudulent
IPOs underwritten by Stratton Oakmont Inc. and an affiliated
brokerage, Monroe Parker Inc., from 1994 to 1997.</TE>
<TE>   In those deals, the two brokerages hid their stake in a company by
moving securities into a "nominee" account owned by Madden. Under the
scheme, brokerage officials would transfer substantial quantities of
IPO securities to Madden, who agreed to sell them back to the
brokerage at pre-arranged prices when trading began, an agreement
sometimes called "flipping."</TE>
<TE>   The firms artificially inflated stock prices by promoting
securities to unsuspecting investors, usually by misrepresenting a
company's prospects. Later, the brokerages sold their stake, which
usually triggered a drop in share price.</TE>
<TE>   One of those offerings was the 1993 IPO of Steven Madden Ltd.,
authorities say. Company shares almost tripled on the first day of
trading in 1993.</TE>

<HD>Mattel Accuses Retailer of Infringing Toy Patents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mattel Inc. sued Urban Outfitters Inc., accusing the retailer of
stealing the largest toy maker's Magic 8 Ball and Rock'em Sock'em
trademarks and patents.</LD>
<LD>   Mattel objects to Urban Outfitters' sale of shirts with an image
of the Magic 8 Ball and Rock'em Sock'em Robots toys. The suit also
named Funworks Toy &amp; Gift Inc., which made and supplied shirts with
the clairvoyant orbs, and Stussy Inc., which sold the retailer shirts
depicting the robots.</LD>
<LD>   The copyright, trademark and trade-dress infringement lawsuit asks
the court to stop the sale of and destroy all the allegedly illegal
Magic 8 Ball Rock'em Sock'em shirts. It also asks for unspecified
punitive and actual damages.</LD>
<TE>   "Mattel has suffered and continues to suffer damage to its
business reputation and goodwill" because of the defendants' acts,
Mattel says in the suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia-based Urban Outfitters and Irvine-based Stussy
declined to comment on the suit. Closely held Funworks of Vancouver,
Canada, could not immediately be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo-based Mattel acquired the rights to the 56-year-old
Magic 8 Ball when it bought Tyco Toys in 1997. The toy, which
resembles a billiard eight ball, has a window that displays answers
to players' questions.</TE>
<TE>   Rock'em Sock'em Robots, created in 1966, are blue and red robots
that throw punches at each other. When one robot strikes the other's
chin, that robot's head pops up on a spring.</TE>
<TE>   Mattel shares fell 22 cents to $20.28 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Urban Outfitters shares rose 95 cents to $22.90 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Questions Commitment by AOL to Open Technology
Standards</HD>
<DH>Computers: E-mail by Internet access provider suggests
rivalry played large role in joining Liberty Alliance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. on Thursday challenged America Online's commitment to
open technological standards as the nation's largest Internet access
provider urged a judge to force Microsoft to adhere to such
standards.</LD>
<LD>   While questioning an AOL witness testifying for nine states
seeking antitrust penalties against the software giant, Microsoft
lawyer Richard Pepperman produced an internal AOL e-mail suggesting
AOL joined a high-profile Internet standards group only after it
seemed Microsoft would join first.</LD>
<LD>   The Liberty Alliance, created by Sun Microsystems Inc., was
founded to develop a common way for Internet users to identify
themselves for electronic commerce.</LD>
<TE>   The alliance includes General Motors Corp., American Express Co.
and Nokia.</TE>
<TE>   AOL, a unit of AOL Time Warner Inc., joined in December, just
before the deadline for founding members.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperman said AOL did so for a public relations boost, citing an
e-mail that said joining after Microsoft "mitigates a major reason
for our participation" and gives Microsoft "a significant win
[regarding] positioning on inter-operability for press and partners."</TE>
<TE>   AOL Vice President John Borthwick, who wrote the e-mail, said news
coverage was a factor in the timing of the decision, but AOL also
delayed its decision because it was unsure whether the Liberty
Alliance "was really going to matter."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft has not joined the group, but discussions are ongoing.</TE>
<TE>   Nine states want U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly to
force Microsoft to create a stripped-down version of the company's
flagship Windows software that could incorporate competitors'
features. The states also want Microsoft to divulge blueprints for
its Internet Explorer browser.</TE>
<TE>   During Thursday's testimony, Microsoft said AOL placed
preconditions on negotiating how its identity service, Magic Carpet,
would work with Microsoft's version.</TE>
<TE>   Borthwick acknowledged that AOL dropped out of those talks after
Microsoft refused to change its Windows operating system so a Magic
Carpet icon would appear on a computer desktop when the computer is
turned on.</TE>

<HD>Northrop CEO Got $3-Million Bonus</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Kresa also got options worth as much as $17.4
million for exceeding goals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp. Chief Executive Kent Kresa received a
$3-million bonus last year along with options that could be worth as
much as $17.4 million as a reward for exceeding the company's
financial performance goals, according to a regulatory filing.</LD>
<LD>   Kresa's pay package, excluding the options, rose 11% to $4.76
million from $4.29 million. His base salary rose to $1.2 million from
$1.02 million. He received a $462,070 long-term incentive payout
along with $95,874 in other compensation.</LD>
<LD>   Kresa got options to buy 216,230 shares with strike prices of
$78.55 to $93.30, which could be worth as much as $17.4 million if
the share price rises 10% or more annually over the life of the
grant. An annual increase of 5% or more would value the options at as
much as $7.2 million.</LD>
<TE>   "Growth occurred throughout the organization with strong
performance in all major programs," the Los Angeles-based company
said in the filing. "Overall customer satisfaction was outstanding."</TE>
<TE>   Northrop entered the shipbuilding business last year through its
$5.2-billion acquisition of Litton Industries Inc., owner of
shipyards in Louisiana and Mississippi. Northrop shares rose 21% last
year, while its peers in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 aerospace and
defense index fell 19%.</TE>
<TE>   The firm also won a key subcontracting role on Lockheed Martin
Corp.'s $200-billion Joint Strike Fighter contract, and its Global
Hawk aerial drone was deployed in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop has made an unsolicited offer to purchase TRW Inc., a
leading subcontractor on the missile defense program, for $11.4
billion. Cleveland-based TRW has urged shareholders to reject the
offer as too low.</TE>

<HD>Restoration Hardware Retools to Boost Sales</HD>
<DH>Upscale retailer overhauls stores and products.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Restoration Hardware Inc., the upscale home-goods retailer that made
its name selling to nostalgic baby boomers, next week will unveil its
own attempt at restoration.</LD>
<LD>   After three straight years of losses stemming from overexpansion,
the Corte Madera, Calif.-based chain will inaugurate remodeled
stores, a fancy new product mix, revamped catalogs and an overhauled
Web site.</LD>
<LD>   The goal is to entice well-heeled customers over 45--who already
might be fans of Restoration's simple and classic furniture--with
goods such as extra-thick Turkish towels and luxury Italian bedding.</LD>
<TE>   Restoration executives say their new model will succeed in part
because it fills a void in the middle-to-top tier of home goods,
between the exclusive world of custom interior designers on one end
and higher-price housewares and furniture chains on the other.</TE>
<TE>   But that can be a difficult niche, especially because many
shoppers in recent years have moved away from middle-tier offerings,
choosing either very high-end or bargain goods.</TE>
<TE>   But Friedman maintains that the new Restoration Hardware will draw
some customers from interior design clients in search of more
moderate prices on replacement or less important items.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of the new shoppers, he says, will come as aging
customers of stores such as Pottery Barn grow out of the trendier,
more moderately priced furnishings and look for a more lasting,
higher-quality alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to Restoration Hardware's challenges are the inherent
difficulties of the large-scale furniture business and the persistent
problems many retailers face as they tackle a store-based and
direct-to-consumer business.</TE>
<TE>   All of which adds up to a high-stakes program for the firm and its
new leader, Chief Executive Gary Friedman.</TE>
<TE>   Having teetered on the brink of bankruptcy 18 months ago,
Restoration must prove its new concept to investors and consumers in
short order.</TE>
<TE>   And for Friedman, who left the presidency of Williams-Sonoma Inc.
a year ago after being passed over for the top job, the new and
improved Restoration Hardware offers a chance to demonstrate that he
is more than just the brilliant merchant behind the cooking supplies
retailer and its Pottery Barn unit.</TE>
<TE>   "People are willing to pay more for higher-quality items, so I
think the conceptual potential is fantastic," said Anne-Marie
Peterson, an analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners.</TE>
<TE>   "But operationally, what they are doing is pretty complex.
Retailers who have been in those businesses successfully for years
still struggle with many of those issues."</TE>
<TE>   Still, as with any retail overhaul, central to the new stores is
the new merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   One of Friedman's first moves at Restoration was to overhaul the
merchandise, clearing out 7,000 of 9,000 items in the average store
in favor of new products and reducing the number of products by 30%.</TE>
<TE>   "We were way over-assorted in Slinkies and pickup sticks and auto
bingo and things like that," Friedman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've edited that back quite a bit, probably by a half to
two-thirds, but what you'll find is that those items will still be
sprinkled throughout the store."</TE>
<TE>   The new buying team, composed largely of former Williams-Sonoma
merchandisers, promises greater depth in many product areas that had
been doing well and new items designed to boost profit margins and
sales.</TE>
<TE>   It plans to lower prices on many beds, for example, in order to
increase sales of night stands, dressers and other matching products.
Whereas previous collections have had one bed per furniture style,
the new formula calls for three in the same amount of floor
space--with pictures of the expanded offerings displayed alongside
floor models from the same collection.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest change will come in textiles, a high-margin
product group that Friedman says will go from 4% of the product mix
to 20% by year-end.</TE>
<TE>   New will be $300 sets of 464-thread-count Italian sheets, Belgian
linen window treatments selling for $90 to $160 and hand-knotted
Persian rugs.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman projects sales increases of 15% per year to $4 million to
$5 million per store, and sales from catalogs and the Web to grow
from $23 million in 2000 to $300 million over the next five years.
Earnings, Friedman said, will rise 30% to 50%--enough to make the
company profitable for the first time since 1998, when it went
public.</TE>
<TE>   To get there, Friedman had to slow the company's growth, closing
three stores last year and planning to shut 68 more under-performing
sites over the next two years. No new stores are planned until 2003,
when the company is scheduled to open 12.</TE>
<TE>   "Furniture is an extremely tough business, but sometimes when
things are really challenging, the right person can come in and find
tremendous opportunity," said Ted Janus, a partner with Palo Alto
Investors, which began buying shares of Restoration Hardware in
November.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we have a first-class merchandiser in there going after
an exciting demographic."</TE>

<HD>Job Losses in Retail Accelerating</HD>
<DH>Labor: Sector could rival telecommunications and automotive
as having the largest downsizing this year, researcher says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The pace of retail job cuts, which increased dramatically after Sept.
11, has accelerated in 2002, and this year's losses could be the
worst in at least two decades as the industry consolidates, according
to a new study.</LD>
<LD>   During the first three months of this year, 51,078 retail job cuts
were announced, including the 22,000 job losses Kmart Corp. announced
after its bankruptcy filing, according to a survey by Challenger,
Gray &amp; Christmas Inc., an employment research and recruiting firm.</LD>
<LD>   That is already halfway toward matching last year's record of
96,741 cuts, Challenger said.</LD>
<TE>   Based on the first-quarter figures, merchants are eliminating an
average of 17,026 jobs a month, and John Challenger, chief executive
of the research firm, expects that pace will continue, with this
year's total estimated to exceed 200,000.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be the year in which retailers come to terms
with changes of consumer behavior that was precipitated by the
recession," Challenger said. He said the losses would be the worst
since the 1980s.</TE>

<LD>US Airways Group Inc. named Neal Cohen chief financial officer and
changed eight other executive positions as new Chief Executive David
Siegel began assembling his management team.</LD>
<LD>   Cohen, 41, has held financial positions at Northwest Airlines
Corp. and General Motors Corp., US Airways said. He will succeed
Thomas Mutryn, 48, who is leaving the airline. A company spokesman
said he was unaware of Mutryn's plans.</LD>
<LD>   Siegel, who joined US Airways last month, brought in six new
executives, including Cohen, and promoted three veterans of the
Arlington, Va.-based company. Siegel follows former CEO Rakesh
Gangwal in trying to reduce costs and revive sales amid a business
travel slowdown and the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The airline's other moves include naming Greg Taylor, senior vice
president of planning, as head of the US Airways Express unit, and
promoting Michelle Bryan to executive vice president and general
counsel from senior vice president of human resources.</TE>
<TE>   The changes take effect Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares closed up 34 cents at $6.10 on the NYSE,
before the executive appointments were announced.</TE>

Marriott will move out of Marriott's Bethesda, Md., headquarters,

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First-time jobless claims surged last week to the highest level in
four months, boosted by a new law permitting workers whose benefits
had expired to apply for an extension.</LD>
<LD>   State unemployment offices received 460,000 new applications last
week, up 64,000 in the week that ended Saturday, the Labor Department
said. A week earlier, initial claims rose by 20,000.</LD>
<LD>   The law, signed March 9 by President Bush, was part of a package
to help cushion the blow of the recession that started last year. The
resulting jump in claims over the last two weeks is masking a slow
improvement in labor markets, analysts said. Unemployment fell in
February to a four-month low of 5.5%.</LD>
<TE>   The four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes out
volatility in the weekly numbers, rose to 403,750 last week from
384,000.</TE>

<HD>Kmart Seeks Court's OK on CEO Payment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp. is seeking U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval to pay Chief
Executive James Adamson $1 million in salary and an additional $4
million if the discount retailer emerges from bankruptcy protection
before July 31, 2003, according to court documents.</LD>
<LD>   After that date, the payment will decrease $7,299 a day. If Troy,
Mich.-based Kmart is still under bankruptcy protection after April
30, 2004, no payment will be made.</LD>
<LD>   Adamson also is eligible for a bonus of 125% of his base salary,
or $1.25 million.</LD>
<TE>   In other news, investors David Tepper and Joseph Harrosh recently
bought preferred securities of Kmart that are convertible into common
stock in a gamble that their value will rise as the retailer
reorganizes.</TE>
<TE>   The investors, buyers of stocks and bonds of companies at or near
bankruptcy, , acquired stakes in Kmart's 7 3/4% trust convertible
preferred securities for a fraction of their $50 face value.</TE>
<TE>   Tepper, a former Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. executive, and Harrosh are
among so-called vulture investors who take stakes in troubled
companies, typically at depressed levels.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the preferred shares have more than doubled to
$10.30 from a low of $5.08 in January. Kmart's common shares, which
have fallen 75% this year, closed down 6 cents at $1.37 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>* Passenger traffic for major U.S. airlines fell 8.8% in March,
improving from an 11% drop in February as carriers cut fares to
recover from the terrorist attacks and a slump in corporate travel.
The decline in miles flown by paying passengers on the nine largest
U.S. airlines is the smallest drop from a year-earlier month since
the Sept. 11 hijackings.</LD>
<LD>   * The International Monetary Fund issued a glowing report on
Russia's economy, which it expects will grow by 3.6% this year. The
IMF report says year-end inflation probably will fall to 13%.</LD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BP said refining oil and selling fuel were less profitable in the
first quarter than at any time in the last decade as inventories
swelled and competition increased at filling stations in the U.S. and
Europe.</LD>
<LD>   The difference between the price the British company pays for
crude oil and what it gets from refined fuels dropped by 30% from the
fourth quarter. Margins from selling fuel through about 26,800 gas
stations narrowed 45%. Oil and gas production also fell short of some
analysts' forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   Pressure from rivals kept retail margins "unsustainably small,"
spokesman Shaun Harley said, overshadowing a 23% gain in crude prices
in the first quarter. A drop in air travel after the Sept. 11 attacks
and a warm winter in the Northern Hemisphere hurt demand for jet fuel
and heating oil.</LD>

<LD>Monsanto Co. will cut up to 5% of its work force and close some

restructures its business while awaiting regulatory approval of new
bio-engineered crops.</LD>
<LD>   Monsanto is forecasting earnings-per-share growth of 4% to 6% this

<LD>   The company is focusing on crops rather than slower-growing
chemicals, Chief Executive Hendrik Verfaillie said.</LD>
<TE>   Monsanto, which has 14,600 employees, will cut fewer than 700 jobs

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenet Healthcare Corp. has been sued by a union that claims it
understaffs its hospitals and violates California labor laws by
failing to pay for work breaks.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet spokesman Harry Anderson said the Santa Barbara-based
company "absolutely rejects" the allegations. The United Nurses Assn.
of California/Union of Health Care Professionals is in negotiations
at two hospitals, and the suit appears to be "an attempt to try this
in the courts," he said.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, which seeks class-action status on behalf of as many as
7,000 Tenet registered nurses in Southern California, asks the court
for an order to force the hospital operator to provide adequate staff
to allow employees to take lunches and breaks. It also seeks back
wages and unspecified damages.</LD>
<TE>   The union, a branch of the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees, filed the suit in Los Angeles County
Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet shares closed unchanged at $67.40 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying its mortgage volume is setting records, New Century Financial
Corp. issued the latest in a series of upbeat projections, sending
its stock up 15% to an all-time high in heavy Nasdaq trading.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the Irvine company, which specializes in home loans to
borrowers with flawed or limited credit histories, rose $3.21 to
$25.12. A year earlier they had sold for $7.</LD>
<LD>   New Century said it expects to earn $4.15 to $4.35 a share this
year. At the end of January, it had projected earnings of $3.60 to
$3.80, an estimate it increased to $3.90 to $4.10 in late February.</LD>
<TE>   Despite a recent spike, mortgage rates remain attractive to New
Century's typical customers: borrowers who consolidate high-interest
credit card debt and other loans into relatively low-interest home
loans. New Century originated or purchased a record $2.65 billion in
loans in the first quarter, up 157% from the year-earlier period.</TE>

<HD>Moody's Cuts Nortel Rating to Junk Status</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nortel Networks Corp. had its credit rating cut to junk by Moody's
Investors Service Inc., triggering a provision in the company's bank
lines that gives creditors title to its assets in the event of a
bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's reduced Nortel's senior unsecured debt rating three levels
to "Ba3," the third-highest junk grade, from "Baa3," the lowest
investment grade. The reduction affects $5 billion of Nortel debt.</LD>
<LD>   The cut to junk trips a clause in the company's loan agreement
that requires Nortel to pledge assets to back up debt, and banks and
bondholders will benefit equally.</LD>
<TE>   Nortel has about $4 billion of untapped credit from banks, which
typically rank ahead of bondholders in staking claim to assets.</TE>
<TE>   "It is good news for bondholders that they now have the security
here," said Ziki Slav, who follows Nortel for Dresdner Kleinwort
Wasserstein-Grantchester.</TE>
<TE>   He recommends buying bonds of the telecommunications equipment
maker because of the provision.</TE>
<TE>   Nortel shares fell 11 cents to $4.24 on the NYSE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. asked a Delaware Chancery Court judge to issue an
order saying it doesn't have to comply with a request for thousands
of documents from dissident director Walter Hewlett.</LD>
<LD>   Hewlett sued the company last week in an effort to invalidate
proxy votes he says tipped the balance in favor of HP's planned
$18.7-billion acquisition of Compaq Computer Corp.</LD>
<LD>   He claims the company bought votes from Deutsche Bank in exchange
for part of a business loan package.</LD>
<TE>   In papers made public, Hewlett-Packard's lawyers asked Judge
William Chandler III to block Hewlett's "oppressive" subpoenas that
"would involve locating, gathering and reviewing hundreds of
thousands (if not millions) of pages of documents" within two weeks.
"The request seeks literally every scrap of paper relating to the
proposed integration of HP and Compaq" from a team of 1,000, company
lawyer Robert Payson said in the motion.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler will hold a hearing in Wilmington, Del., Sunday on HP's
motion to dismiss the case. He has scheduled a three-day trial
beginning April 23.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Hewlett-Packard disclosed in a regulatory filing that Chief
Executive Carly Fiorina was paid $1 million in salary last year--the
same as in 2000--but she did not receive a bonus because the company
didn't meet its financial goals. Fiorina received a $1.8-million
bonus in 2000. She received an option grant for 1 million shares,
down from 1.3 million shares in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   HP was down 12 cents at $17.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. said the Securities and
Exchange Commission will launch a formal review of the telephone and
data services company, covering the same accounting issues as the
agency's previously announced informal review.</LD>
<LD>   Denver-based Qwest said it had received in March an informal
inquiry from the SEC regarding its accounting policies, practices and
procedures in 2000 and 2001.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the company said the SEC staff recommended action
against the carrier for excluding certain information, most related
to its acquisition of US West Inc., in a January 2001 earnings
release. Qwest, the No.4 U.S. local telephone company, said it is
cooperating fully with the SEC and will continue to do so.</LD>
<TE>   Qwest shares closed at $7.26, down 29 cents, on the NYSE. Qwest

<HD>Stocks Break Losing Streak</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Indexes rise slightly as investors seek
consumer, industrial sectors, but Mideast fears keep gains in check.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks broke a losing streak to rise slightly Thursday as investors
sought the relative safety of consumer and industrial stocks after
firms in the drug and software sectors warned quarterly profits will
miss forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   An upbeat profit forecast by Dell Computer lifted Dell's stock 56
cents to $26.75 and helped some computer hardware-related issues.</LD>
<LD>   But that optimism was offset by warnings of disappointing profits
from drug giant Bristol-Myers Squibb and security software maker
Check Point Software.</LD>
<TE>   And fears about escalating violence in the Middle East held the
market's gains in check.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow industrials rose 36.88 points, or 0.4%, to 10,235.17,
breaking a four-session losing streak. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index inched up 0.1% to 1,126.34. The Nasdaq composite index gained
5.40 points, or 0.3%, to 1,789.75.</TE>
<TE>   Advancing stocks led decliners by about 9 to 7 on the New York
Stock Exchange; winners held a slim advantage on Nasdaq. Volume was
moderate, but higher than it has been in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers, the most-active stock on the NYSE, plunged $5.55,
or 14.7%, to $32.15, after warning profit will suffer because of
lower demand for its medicines.</TE>
<TE>   Other drug makers' shares also were dragged down, including
Pfizer, which lost $1 to $39. The Amex pharmaceutical index fell 2.4%
to its lowest since September.</TE>
<TE>   Check Point, the third most-active Nasdaq issue, dropped $5.39, or
19.6%, to $22.07 after saying first-quarter revenue and profit will
miss estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Among other stocks that were slammed on new earnings warnings were
SonicWall, a computer security company, which lost $2.54, or 25%, to
$7.54, and InFocus, a video projection maker, which lost $3.25, or
18.8%, to $14.</TE>
<TE>   As those shares slumped, buyers turned to some consumer-related
issues. Home Depot rose $1.20 to $48.15, Hot Topic gained $2.19 to
$23, Avon Products added $1.34 to $55.85 and Kellogg jumped $2.11 to
$34.86.</TE>
<TE>   Oil prices slipped after President Bush called on Israel to begin
withdrawing from West Bank towns, raising hopes of easing tensions in
the Middle East and reducing the risk of an oil embargo.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, May crude oil futures fell 98
cents to $26.58 a barrel, after touching a high of $28.35 earlier in
the day.</TE>
<TE>   "Tough talking from the White House contracted the war premium" on
oil prices, said Peter Gignoux of investment bank Schroder Salomon
Smith Barney.</TE>
<TE>   Investors were spooked early in the day by a government report
showing a spike in the number of Americans filing for first-time
jobless benefits in the latest week.</TE>
<TE>   This countered recent signs suggesting the U.S. economy was
strengthening. Today the government will report key employment
figures for March.</TE>
<TE>   Among Thursday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Stocks of energy companies followed oil lower, with the
Philadelphia oil services index down 2.1%. Among the major oil
companies, Exxon Mobil, a Dow stock, lost 54 cents to $43.15, and
ChevronTexaco shed $2.21, to $87.79. Oil and gas producer Anadarko
Petroleum fell $2.23 to $54.49, and Noble Drilling lost $1.11 to
$39.85.</TE>
<TE>   * GM, up 79 cents to $60.14, helped underpin the Dow. Merrill
Lynch raised its second-quarter and full-year earnings estimates for
GM, saying the auto maker's production was running stronger than
expected.</TE>
<TE>   Other industrial issues gaining ground included Monsanto, up $1.30
to $32.76, and United Technologies, up 61 cents to $73.46.</TE>
<TE>   * 3M rose $1.21 to $114.12. After the close of trading, 3M said
its first-quarter profit will be at the high end of, or above,
expectations.</TE>

<HD>Pitt: Let Shareholders OK Options</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Attention is on protecting investors as SEC, Big
Board consider new corporate governance rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt on Thursday
called for giving shareholders a greater voice in corporate decisions
to award stock options to employees.</LD>
<LD>   Pitt's comments, in a speech in Chicago, came in advance of a vote
the commission plans for next week on tightening corporate disclosure
requirements.</LD>
<LD>   In a related development, the New York Stock Exchange, under
pressure from investors and the SEC to better protect shareholders,
is considering rules to reduce conflicts of interest on corporate
boards.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC will vote Thursday on whether to propose rules that would
force companies to disclose more information about their finances and
do it more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposal, companies would have to file quarterly and
annual reports sooner after the end of a fiscal period. They also
would have to provide timely information about trading by company
executives in the company's stock and other securities.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, only the insiders themselves must disclose such
information--not the companies. For some kinds of transactions,
insiders have until 45 days after the end of a company's fiscal year
before they must report. Other transactions must be reported within
10 days after the month in which the transaction took place.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed rules also would require firms to disclose in their
annual reports whether they provide access to this information on the
Internet or, if not, to explain why.</TE>
<TE>   One proposal would cut the deadline for filing annual reports to
60 days after the end of a fiscal year from 90 days. Quarterly
financial filings would be required within 30 days instead of 45.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals are among several Pitt has supported since Enron
Corp.'s collapse, amid calls from Congress and others for stricter
financial reporting.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt had advocated speeding up corporate disclosure before the
Enron crisis.</TE>
<TE>   If the SEC votes to propose the rules, they would be open to
public comment before the commission votes to make them permanent.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech Thursday, Pitt said conventional wisdom has long
held that granting options to corporate managers was supposed to
align their interests with those of shareholders. But investors
sometimes can be left holding the bag when a firm fails, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Companies do not have to account for option grants as employee
costs, yet they can take tax deductions as employees exercise
options. In addition, companies can establish broad options plans
without asking for shareholder approval.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies should be required to make full disclosure and submit
such plans to a shareholder vote," Pitt said.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate boards also would do well to consider requiring officers
to demonstrate long-term growth and success before they can exercise
their options, thus helping to abolish "perverse" incentives to
manage earnings or engage in fraudulent accounting, Pitt said.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me that options are potentially troublesome if they
are structured to reward short-term performance," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt also said the SEC has asked the NYSE and the Nasdaq Stock
Market to conduct a review to determine whether companies that list
in their markets meet the highest ethical standards.</TE>
<TE>   The NYSE's board may require that companies listed on the exchange
have only independent directors sit on their audit and compensation
committees, according to people familiar with the matter.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting Thursday, the board also discussed requiring listed
companies to separate the job of chairman from that of chief
executive. Other proposals include writing new rules for external
auditors and codes of conduct for internal auditors as well as
forging a stronger definition of independent director, the sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   An NYSE spokesman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the world's biggest stock market appointed a
13-member panel to examine corporate governance issues. The panel
will report its findings in June. The suggestions then must be
formulated as rules to be put before the board and NYSE members
before becoming official.</TE>

<LD>Greenhouse gas--The Your Wheels column in Wednesday's Highway 1
section incorrectly referred to carbon monoxide instead of carbon dioxide
as a so-called greenhouse gas linked to global warming. Although carbon
monoxide is considered an indirect contributor to global warming,
scientists say carbon dioxide from auto emissions is a more serious
problem.</LD>

<HD>Radioactive Items in Home Lead to Arrest</HD>
<DH>Raid: Agents remove briefcases, desk, suit from the
Westminster house of a scientist. Levels pose no risk, authorities
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD and MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A scientist barred two years ago from handling radioactive material
was arrested Thursday after federal environmental agents determined
that his Westminster home was contaminated with the radioactive
substance Carbon 14.</LD>
<LD>   State and county investigators descended on Riad Mohamad Ahmed's
Maidstone Street home, removing three briefcases, a man's suit and a
desk that allegedly tested positive for radiation.</LD>
<LD>   Carbon 14 contains low levels of radiation and is found naturally,
but can be linked to cancer when ingested or inhaled. Prosecutors
said the levels at Ahmed's home posed no risk to the neighborhood but
required swift action, given a history of contamination problems at
laboratories run by Ahmed since the 1980s.</LD>
<TE>   "He's been a lab experiment gone wrong for the last 15 years,"
said Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Nick Thompson. "I have zero
tolerance for the illegal handling of these materials."</TE>
<TE>   The raid followed a report released last week by the Environmental
Protection Agency citing a Feb. 6 search of Ahmed's home in which
agency officials allegedly discovered radioactive contamination.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed, 61, who conducts research for a company that makes hair
products, was taken into custody and then to a hospital after he
complained of heart problems. He faces one charge of illegally
possessing radioactive material, which carries a maximum of six
months in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities began scrutinizing Ahmed in the mid-1980s, when state
and local officials accused him of mishandling dangerous materials at
a lab in Sunland. In 1997, Ahmed again ran afoul of regulators after
an explosion at a laboratory he kept in Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   No one was hurt, but prosecutors allege that the blast spewed
Carbon 14 throughout the neighborhood and required such an extensive
cleanup that federal environmental officials declared the area a
Superfund site.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like Chernobyl, not to the degree of the radioactivity,
but because the contamination was so widespread," said former Los
Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Miller, who handled the case.</TE>
<TE>   "They had to strip the place down to the studs. They were in there
for months. Guys in moon suits."</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed pleaded guilty in Los Angeles Superior Court in October to
one misdemeanor charge of illegally disposing of a radioactive
substance in connection with the explosion, prosecutors said. A judge
ordered him to repay the Environmental Protection Agency its
$1.4-million cleanup cost.</TE>
<TE>   By then, state officials had revoked Ahmed's license to handle
radioactive materials, said Ken August, a spokesman for the
California Department of Health Services.</TE>

<HD>Family of Four Found Dead in Santa Clara</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police discovered a family of four dead in their upscale Santa Clara,
Calif., home Thursday in an apparent murder-suicide.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a horrific scene," said Santa Clara Police Detective Kurt
Clarke. "It's awful."</LD>
<LD>   The detective would not reveal how the 42-year-old man,
38-year-old woman and their two daughters, ages 4 and 12, had
died--or who among them is believed to have done the killing.</LD>
<TE>   Police were summoned to the scene shortly after noon. The father's
boss, worried because the man had not shown up at work for several
days, went by his house to check on him. The father worked in the
high-tech industry, police said.</TE>
<TE>   After knocking on the front door, the boss walked around to the
back of the house, where he peered in the window and saw a body.</TE>
<TE>   He called 911, and when police came, they found three more bodies.
They are notifying the next of kin, Clarke said.</TE>
<TE>   These are the first homicides in Santa Clara this year, police
said. The city with 102,000 population is between Palo Alto and San
Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Manny Deoliveira said there was nothing unusual about the
family, whose names have not been released, but he had heard the
couple had marital problems.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no signs of violence," he said, adding the couple had
attended neighborhood watch meetings during the past year.</TE>

<HD>Activists Seek to Block Homes</HD>
<DH>Adams Canyon: Development opponents push their own ballot
measure. Builder says the project would help Santa Paula's economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Paula growth-control activists are launching an attempt to
derail a November ballot proposal that would allow for construction
of 2,250 homes in neighboring Adams Canyon.</LD>
<LD>   The activists are proposing to place the Adams Canyon Agricultural
Preservation Initiative on the fall ballot. If approved, the measure
would amend Santa Paula's General Plan to prohibit development in the
canyon northwest of the city.</LD>
<LD>   Resident Mike Miller, who is helping spearhead the
counter-initiative, said Pinnacle Development's plan would more than
double the geographic size of Santa Paula, creating more traffic and
other problems for the small blue-collar city of 30,000. The new
suburb would include hotels, golf courses, two schools and a shopping
complex.</LD>
<TE>   "They're basically saying 'We can have our way with this small
town,' " Miller said. "I take exception to that."</TE>
<TE>   But Greg Boyd, project manager of the Arizona-based developer,
said activists such as Miller are taking an extreme position. He said
the city needs more development to help prop up the local economy.</TE>
<TE>   "[Activists] don't ever want to see another house built," he said.
"We don't think that's healthy. The city's dying, and without some
growth and economic opportunity, we think it's going to get even
worse."</TE>
<TE>   The 5,413-acre canyon, with its orange groves, herds of cattle and
oaks scattered between its rugged hillsides, provides a serene
backdrop to an increasingly heated battle over its future.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Santa Paula revised its General Plan to accommodate
future growth in Adams Canyon. But that revision sparked a Department
of Justice investigation over whether the city's at-large voting
system perpetuated racial discrimination against Latinos running for
City Council.</TE>
<TE>   As part of a settlement with the federal government, the city will
ask voters in November to decide whether to carve up the city into
council districts.</TE>
<TE>   Activists argued that building luxury canyon homes would primarily
attract rich whites and bolster a white power structure, despite
Latinos making up two-thirds of the city's population. They also
argued the development would forever change the city's character and
drain resources from crumbling neighborhoods and struggling Main
Street shops.</TE>
<TE>   But the City Council pressed forward, with the majority convinced
that upscale housing was the only way to reinvigorate the city's
lagging tax and business base. In 2000, the Local Agency Formation
Commission gave a green light to the city's preliminary expansion
plans.</TE>
<TE>   Later that year, however, slow-growth activists convinced a
majority of the city's voters to adopt a measure that effectively
blocked the Adams Canyon development. The Save Open Space and
Agricultural Resources initiative established a growth boundary
around the city.</TE>
<TE>   Any proposed development outside that boundary would require voter
approval before it could be annexed into the city.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Pinnacle, working with canyon landowner Arnold R.
Dahlberg, began asking residents for input on the development
proposal called The Ranch at Santa Paula. The developer also sought
suggestions on parks and affordable housing that would be included if
its project were approved.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Pinnacle announced its campaign to place a measure on
the fall ballot that would essentially redraw the SOAR growth-control
boundary to accommodate Adams Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the SOAR coalition, which includes Miller, Latino
activist Bob Borrego and City Councilman John Procter, fired back and
announced that it would launch its own initiative. If successful, the
measure would take Adams Canyon out of the city's General Plan,
making the outcome of Pinnacle's ballot initiative irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said amending the city's General Plan is a natural
extension of the SOAR campaign of two years ago. "The first thing out
of the mouths of these developers when they came to town was, 'Hey
we're just doing what's called for in your General Plan,' " Miller
said. "The General Plan should be in accord with the [SOAR] line."</TE>
<TE>   Boyd called the SOAR coalition hypocritical. "First, it was 'We
think voters should have to approve it.' Now, it's 'We want to
establish it once and for all that voters can never approve
anything,' " he said. "You could go back and forth with this
forever."</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles' children need more after-school programs and more safe

<HD>Alarcon May Run for Mayor of Valley City</HD>
<DH>Politics: The state senator remains neutral on secession,
but says he will probably seek the office if the issue lands on the
November ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY and SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State Sen. Richard Alarcon announced Thursday that he will probably
run for mayor of a proposed San Fernando Valley city, assuming there
is a vote for secession in November.</LD>
<LD>   Alarcon (D-Sylmar), who has represented 850,000 Valley residents
for 31/2 years, would be the first candidate for an office that would
appear on the same ballot with a secession plan. If a secession
election is held, it would also include 14 City Council races for the
new city.</LD>
<LD>   "Given all of the work I have done with the city of Los Angeles
and especially the San Fernando Valley, I can't imagine not
presenting my candidacy for mayor and not giving the voters an
opportunity to consider it," Alarcon said. "I have tentatively
decided to run if the support is there."</LD>
<TE>   But Alarcon, a former city councilman, also said he remains
neutral on the issue of secession. That puts him in the awkward
position of preparing to run for mayor of a city that he isn't sure
should exist.</TE>
<TE>   He did, however, express general sympathy for secessionists'
complaints about Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Los Angeles, and to me the San Fernando Valley is part of
Los Angeles," he said. "But I am also concerned that the San Fernando
Valley is not getting its fair share of services."</TE>
<TE>   The Local Agency Formation Commission is set to decide next month
whether to schedule secession elections for the Valley, Hollywood and
the harbor area.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon, 48, is seeking reelection to the Senate in November,
which would raise legal questions if he mounts a mayoral campaign at
the same time. He said he has received tentative opinions from City
Atty. Rocky Delgadillo and an attorney for the state Legislature that
he could run simultaneously for both jobs.</TE>
<TE>   If secession passes and he wins both races, Alarcon said he would
resign from the state Senate. A special election would be held to
fill his seat.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon said he expects a dozen or more candidates to seek the
office of Valley mayor.</TE>
<TE>   His announcement comes at a time when the secession movement is
drawing more attention citywide--including among Latinos and African
Americans, two groups that had previously not been involved.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a Times poll showed increasing support for secession
among Latinos in the Valley. A small number of Latino activists and
business leaders--many of them political opponents of City Council
President Alex Padilla--have joined the secession drive in the
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Rev. Frederick O. Murph of the Brookins AME
church in South Los Angeles said he was considering supporting
secession. He formed a committee to hold community meetings and form
focus groups on whether the city should be made smaller.</TE>
<TE>   Murph said he planned to ask the state Legislature to fund a study
on the effect that breaking up the city would have on African
Americans. Much of Murph's motivation appeared to come from his anger
at Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, who antagonized many black
Angelenos by refusing to support a second term for Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Councilman Nate Holden, who had previously
criticized secession, said a breakup "looks more and more inviting to
me every day."</TE>
<TE>   Holden said African Americans and others in his South Los Angeles
district would have more clout if the Valley, Hollywood and harbor
area seceded, because the remaining city would be much smaller.
Blacks would make up a larger part of a smaller Los Angeles, he
reasoned, and therefore would carry more weight at City Hall and win
more council seats.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn called Murph's announcement "political opportunism," and said
that secession would especially hurt those in South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of anything that would be worse for the African
American community or the minority communities in this city than to
break up this great city of Los Angeles," Hahn told reporters in
Pacoima on Thursday morning. "I think some people need to take a time
out here and reflect on the seriousness of the situation. There is no
hope of ever putting this city back together again if we split
apart."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn could not be reached from comment on Alarcon's announcement.</TE>
<TE>   The early timing of that announcement could give Alarcon an
advantage over other candidates, according to Valley political
activists, including at least one board member of the secession group
Valley VOTE.</TE>

<HD>Proposal to Ferry Water Is Opposed</HD>
<DH>Resources: Bill seeks to block a plan to use large bags to
tote water from two north coast rivers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A proposal to siphon water from two north coast rivers and tug it to
San Diego in water bags the size of a World War II battleship is
under fire from state lawmakers eager to block the plan.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblywoman Patricia Wiggins (D-Santa Rosa) and other lawmakers
representing the rugged northern coastline began pushing legislation
this week that would give county elected leaders virtual veto power
over such projects.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a clear-cut case of a community that needs to be
consulted before its resources are pillaged," said Matt Reilly,
Wiggins' chief of staff. "To the people who live there, it's their
backyard, and they should have a say."</LD>
<TE>   Wiggins' bill (AB 2924) was denounced by Ric Davidge of Alaska
Water Exports, the firm that wants to use 850-foot-long polyfiber
bags to tote water from the Gualala and Albion rivers in Mendocino
County south to San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extraordinarily unfortunate that people would introduce
legislation to try to stop a project that is clearly the most
ecologically benign proposal to date to deal with the problems of
water in California," Davidge said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal by Davidge, a former aide to Reagan Interior
Secretary James Watt, has attracted a storm of opposition from a
collection of environmentalists, tourist businesses, and farmers in
Mendocino and Sonoma counties. Residents ridicule it as a water grab
that would wreak environmental damage to the rivers and sully views
along the pristine coastline.</TE>
<TE>   More than 300 foes turned out last month to confront Davidge
during a forum at Sea Ranch, an exclusive coastal enclave just south
of the Gualala River. Later three dozen people took their protest to
the river, standing on a bridge and holding up placards saying, "Honk
if you like fish" and "No water bags."</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, a pipeline would be buried up the spine of each
river to capture heavy winter flows. The bags, which float below the
ocean surface, would be filled via a pump aboard an offshore buoy.
Tow boats then would slowly tug the massive bags south to San Diego,
where 40,000 customers could be supplied by the 20,000 acre-feet of
water reaped each year.</TE>
<TE>   Wiggins' bill, supported by state Sen. Wesley Chesbro (D-Arcata),
would block state water officials from allowing the export of water
from California's north coast rivers unless local county supervisors
granted permission.</TE>
<TE>   The water bag proposal is under review by the state Water
Resources Control Board, which might hold hearings in the next few
months. The Coastal Commission also has asked to review Davidge's
plans.</TE>
<TE>   While sure to win support among Democratic lawmakers from Northern
California, Wiggins' bill could potentially run into some opposition
from Southern California lawmakers uneasy about setting a precedent
that could complicate other efforts to boost water exports from the
north.</TE>

<LD>An appeals court ruled Friday that the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office can prosecute Bell Gardens Councilwoman Maria
Chacon, reversing a lower court decision that recused the office on
grounds of conflict of interest.</LD>
<LD>   The lower court ruled that a conflict existed because the chief of
investigations for the district attorney's office, Steve Simonian,
once worked for the city of Bell Gardens.</LD>
<LD>   But the appeals court decided that Simonian's participation in the
case was not sufficient to warrant the recusal of the entire office.
The court ordered Simonian not to participate any further on the
case.</LD>
<TE>   Chacon is accused of pressuring Bell Gardens City Council members
to appoint her city manager.</TE>

<HD>Planned Closure of Bike Lane at Border Crossing Draws
Criticism</HD>
<DH>Safety: Legislator says INS and customs officials can take
other measures to avoid accidents at the busy port of entry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A decision by U.S. officials at the busy U.S.-Mexico border to close
a bicycle path used by Tijuana residents is provoking the ire of
bicyclists and their supporters in both countries.</LD>
<LD>   After crossing procedures at San Ysidro were tightened because of
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the number of people entering the
U.S. by bicycle increased twentyfold, as border crossers sought to
avoid long delays in automobile lanes or pedestrian walkways.</LD>
<LD>   But the INS and Customs Service announced this week that, starting
Monday, the bicycle lane at San Ysidro--said to be the world's
busiest port of entry--will be closed to prevent collisions between
cars and bikes.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Congressman Urges Alternative Strategies</TE>
<TE>   Reaction has been swift and angry.</TE>
<TE>   "This plan is totally ridiculous," said Rep. Bob Filner (D-San
Diego), whose district includes San Ysidro. "If there are concerns
about bikes mixing with cars, find a way to keep them apart without
shutting them out."</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Guzman, who pedals across the border at San Ysidro and takes
the San Diego trolley to his job as a maintenance worker in a
downtown high-rise, said the bicycle lane "has been wonderful" since
the Sept. 11 crackdown.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting in line with other pedestrians, he said, "will add many
hours each week to my wait and keep me from being with my children.
It's very unfortunate."</TE>
<TE>   But officials insist that bicyclists have been spotted weaving in
and out of the 24 northbound lanes to get to the bicycle lane. Also,
they say, bicyclists are ignoring signs that say, in English and
Spanish, "No Bicycle Parking."</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a lot of near misses and close calls," said John
Ramirez, community affairs director for the San Diego office of the
INS. "We want to do something before we have a tragedy. We feel we've
dodged the bullet so far."</TE>
<TE>   Building a protected bicycle lane as suggested by Filner and
others would be expensive and time consuming, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The wait for cars is commonly two--and sometimes as much as
four--hours as 42,000 vehicles each day make the northward trek. The
wait for pedestrians can also be two hours or more.</TE>
<TE>   Metal detectors have been installed in the pedestrian lanes, and
pedestrians and motorists have been subjected to more intense
questioning and inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Bicyclists are allowed to go to the front of the automobile lane.
Under the rule to take effect Monday, cyclists will be required to
walk their bikes across the border and stand in the same line as the
estimated 32,000 pedestrians who cross each day.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day we've seen children on small bicycles trailing behind
their parents moving in and out from between cars," Ramirez said.
"Even though the cars are moving slow, it wouldn't take much for a
very bad accident to occur."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Police Sgt. Elsa Castillo said officers have noticed
"bicyclists riding on the wrong side of the road, cutting in and out
of traffic, and riding on sidewalks even though the sidewalks are
very congested."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Crossings Rose to 2,000 Daily Before Declining</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, about 100 bicyclists crossed the border each day
by walking through the indoor pedestrian entrance. After the bicycle
lane opened, the number of bicyclists increased to nearly 2,000, but
it has declined sharply as the auto and pedestrian lanes have begun
moving faster, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   One day, officials counted 700 bicycles locked to public and
private property near the trolley station. As a goodwill gesture, the
trolley district has opted not to enforce an ordinance against
chaining bikes to trolley station fences.</TE>
<TE>   Berta Gonzales, vice president of the San Ysidro Chamber of
Commerce, said closing the bike lane will hurt small retail
businesses near the border that depend on customers from Tijuana.
Bicycle rentals are expected to be especially hard hit.</TE>
<TE>   "This will hurt us all very badly, and the worst thing is that
they didn't talk to us at all about it," Gonzales said. "Our
employees will have trouble getting to work on time, and our
customers will stay away."</TE>
<TE>   Border businesses have already been hurt by the tightened security
measures. The San Diego City Council declared the area to be in an
economic state of emergency and appealed to the federal government
for financial assistance to keep businesses from going bankrupt.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the federal government has not responded, local officials
said.</TE>

<HD>Landmark School Bond Put on Ballot</HD>
<DH>Education: Voters will decide about half of the
$25.6-billion issue on Nov. 5, the rest in 2004.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Legislature voted final approval Thursday of a landmark bill that
would put before voters a $25.6-billion school construction bond
issue, the state's biggest ever.</LD>
<LD>   The borrowing plan would be split in two for voter approval. The
first $13.3-billion issue would appear on the Nov. 5 ballot. The
remaining $12.3 billion would be on the ballot in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   With no votes to spare on a bipartisan tally, the Senate sent the
proposal to Gov. Gray Davis for his promised signature. An hour
later, Democrats and a few Republicans in the Assembly voted narrow
passage of a $2.1-billion bond issue bill to finance housing programs
for low-income Californians.</LD>
<TE>   The housing program, by Senate Leader John L. Burton (D-San
Francisco), is scheduled to be voted on by the Senate next week and
delivered to Davis. The governor is expected to embrace it as part of
his proposed aid to the homeless initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who had urged the Legislature to enact a multiyear school
finance program, praised approval of the school construction bond
bill as "historic." He noted that it will be California's biggest
bond issue for schools. "Believe me, we need it," Davis said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, voters approved a $9.2-billion bond issue for public
schools, colleges and the university systems. At the time, it was the
most expensive ever. But its revenue has run out, and schools are
still struggling to meet enrollment and modernization demands.</TE>
<TE>   State school officials said that at least $21.1 billion in new
state bond funds is needed over the next four years to catch up with
demands of the expanding enrollment and to improve aging
schoolhouses, most of which are more than 30 years old.</TE>
<TE>   The state funds would match bonds approved at recent elections by
local voters.</TE>
<TE>   The plan earmarks $11.4 billion from the Nov. 5 bond issue for new
school construction and modernization projects at K-12 schools,
including $4.8 billion for projects that had been filed with the
state by Feb. 1 but for which funds had not been approved.</TE>
<TE>   An additional $3.45 billion would be earmarked for construction of
schools in fast-growing areas: $1.4 billion for upgrading older
schools and $1.7 billion for "critically overcrowded" schools, such
as in the Los Angeles Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Higher-education building projects would receive $1.65 billion,
including $746 million for community colleges. At campuses of the
University of California, $408.2 million would be allocated; at
California State University, $495.9 million. Other higher education
projects would be financed by $651 million in lease revenue bonds.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta), who represents regions around
Palm Springs, complained that suburban districts would not get their
fair share while Los Angeles Unified would get more than its share.</TE>
<TE>   "This bond is not fair," Battin said.</TE>
<TE>   The $2.1-billion housing bond issue, which Assembly supporters
said would help resolve an acute shortage, would be the biggest of
its kind in state history.</TE>
<TE>   It would include $910 million for construction of multifamily
housing; $195 million for local emergency housing; $15 million for
low-income UC and Cal State student housing; and $200 million for
migrant farm labor shelter. It also would provide assistance for down

<HD>Progress Reported in Negotiations to End Strike by School
Bus Drivers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Labor negotiations made progress Thursday between the Los Angeles
Unified School District's biggest transportation contractor and its
school bus drivers, but no settlement was reached to end a strike
that has disrupted 20,000 students' schedules.</LD>
<LD>   The talks ended at about 8 p.m. even as the drivers union failed
to expand their strike to another company. Both sides agreed to
resume negotiations at noon today.</LD>
<LD>   Union representatives said they were optimistic that the
negotiations, mediated by federal labor officials, could lead to a
settlement soon. The meeting was the first since an estimated 700
Teamster drivers for Laidlaw Education Services bus company went on
strike Tuesday morning, forcing the school district to find
alternative transportation for students.</LD>
<TE>   Federal mediator Linda G. Gonzalez said only that the negotiations
were "ongoing" and that "there's no telling" how long they will last.
She shuttled between two rooms in her Glendale office, talking to the
two sides and calling them together at times to confirm points of
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday morning, striking Laidlaw drivers from Teamsters Union
Local 572 lined up in front of the downtown bus yard of Atlantic
Express in an effort to persuade that company's 250 drivers to join
the strike. Atlantic Express is the school district's second-largest
bus operator, and its unionized drivers belong to the same Teamsters
local as the Laidlaw strikers.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, strikers blocked the Atlantic Express driveway with
a tractor trailer. Los Angeles police ordered the vehicle moved and
detained one striker, who was released later. All but 14 Atlantic
Express drivers crossed the picket line and drove their regular
routes, according to company and union officials.</TE>
<TE>   Laidlaw drivers, who make between $8 and $15 an hour, say they
want parity with drivers employed directly by the district, who earn
between $15 and $24 an hour. Laidlaw drivers also complain that their
health and retirement benefits are inferior.</TE>
<TE>   Don Owens, a spokesman for the national Teamsters' headquarters,
said that the two sides in Thursday's talks were close to agreement
on wages and health benefits, but he declined to give specific
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "Retirement is the main sticking point," he added, speaking
outside the Glendale site.</TE>
<TE>   Executives for Laidlaw were not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   By using district-employed supervisors and other companies, the
district has managed to keep bus service going for the students
usually served by Laidlaw. Buses, however, ran about an hour late on
average Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Athletic events and field trips were curtailed as the district
prioritized pickup for students in special education and those taking
the Stanford 9 assessment tests.</TE>
<TE>   With its own drivers and contracted services, the district usually
shuttles a total of 75,000 students over 710 square miles every
school day.</TE>
<TE>   The failure to add Atlantic to the strike appeared to be a setback
for the Laidlaw drivers, who don't have a local strike fund or
visible support from other unions. Local Teamsters leaders have used
the insult "scabs" against fellow members who, employed directly by
the district and by Atlantic Express, have replaced strikers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the union local is only recently emerging from a
federally mandated reorganization after a corruption scandal 18
months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Carla Bruno, vice president of the Atlantic Express bus line, said
that all Atlantic routes were covered Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Our drivers belong to the same union," said Bruno. "But this is
not an Atlantic Express strike; this is a Laidlaw strike."</TE>
<TE>   Bruno added that Atlantic's contract with Local 572 prohibits
drivers from striking.</TE>
<TE>   District-employed bus supervisors who are members of Local 572
also have a no-strike clause in their contract, according to members
and district officials.</TE>

<HD>Accused Officer's Photos Barred</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge says papers publishing them would hinder
sex-case inquiry. Media vow to appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fueling what attorneys called a classic 1st Amendment battle, a San
Bernardino County judge Thursday barred two newspapers from
publishing photographs taken in court of a police officer accused of
assaulting 11 women while on duty.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Robert Fawke said using the pictures would hinder Officer
Ronald VanRossum's ability to get a fair trial by compromising the
investigation. VanRossum's 6th Amendment right to a fair trial
outweighed the press' 1st Amendment right to publish the photos, he
said.</LD>
<LD>   "I am balancing the public's right to know with his [6th]
Amendment rights," Fawke said. "And he has a constitutional right to
a fair trial."</LD>
<TE>   Attorneys representing the Los Angeles Times and the
Press-Enterprise of Riverside said the judge's ruling violates the
Constitution and promised to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be asking the courts to act as quickly as possible," said
Alonzo Wickers, representing The Times. "We will argue the judge does
not have a basis to restrain the newspaper from publishing photos."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute began last Friday at a hearing for VanRossum, a
14-year veteran of the San Bernardino Police Department arrested last
week and charged with 27 counts of kidnapping, rape and battery.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said VanRossum, a patrolman who worked the night and
graveyard shifts, targeted women walking alone in the San Bernardino
area, many of them drug addicts or with a history of prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing in San Bernardino Superior Court, several
members of the media requested permission to take VanRossum's
picture. Fawke granted all requests. But defense attorneys and Deputy
Dist. Atty. Jon Ferguson objected as deputies brought VanRossum into
the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   The defense and prosecution argued that because investigators are
still interviewing potential witnesses and victims in the case, no
photographs of the defendant should be taken. "We want witness
memories to be a product of their own recollections rather than some
intervening fact introduced by the newspaper," Ferguson said outside
court Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   After attorneys raised objections at last week's hearing, Fawke
rescinded his approval of the photographs. But by then, photographers
from The Times and Press-Enterprise had pictures of VanRossum. Fawke
warned the news organizations that he would hold them in contempt of
court if they published the photos.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the two newspapers said many court rulings have
established that 1st Amendment rights trump 6th Amendment rights in
such circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Mirell, a 1st Amendment attorney in Los Angeles not
involved in the case, agreed that the law appears to be on the side
of the news media. "There is a long line of U.S. Supreme Court
decisions which establish the principle that the media is free to
publish information it has lawfully obtained," he said. "Once that
information is out of the bag, the courts are precluded from
attempting to stuff it back into the bag."</TE>
<TE>   Mirell cited several cases that have tested the issue, known as
prior restraint. The term refers to attempts to keep the media from
publishing information or photographs.</TE>
<TE>   The most famous case involves the New York Times in its fight with
the White House in 1971 to print excerpts from Pentagon papers, which
outlined the United States' growing involvement in the Vietnam War.
White House attorneys asked the U.S. Supreme Court to bar the paper,
and the Washington Post, from further stories on the documents. But
the court ruled that not even their claim of national security was
enough to uphold prior restraint.</TE>
<TE>   "As regretful as a judge may be for having issued an order
[allowing photos], the remedy can not be suppression of those photos.
Clearly, that would violate the 1st Amendment's prohibition against
prior restraint," Mirell said.</TE>

<HD>Two Rescued After Plane Crash</HD>
<DH>Accident: Men escape unharmed after hitting mountain in
Cleveland National Forest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pilot Dariush Javadi checked his flight instruments, charts and fuel
level before he took off, but what he should have reviewed was his
wardrobe.</LD>
<LD>   Javadi and his nephew, both of Orange, were airlifted to safety
Thursday after a chilly night huddled in a Cessna 152 that crashed
into a mountain.</LD>
<LD>   "I usually don't wear closed shoes when I'm not working," said
Javadi, 42, an airline mechanic. "Maybe I'll take a pair of socks
along next time."</LD>
<TE>   Javadi credits the thick brush and soft soil of Santiago Peak for
saving his life and that of his nephew, Nima Javadi, a flight
instructor.</TE>
<TE>   "The trees helped, and the ground was full of dried leaves and
tree bark, and it formed like a cushion," Javadi said.</TE>
<TE>   "If it had been just rocks on the ground, it wouldn't have been
pretty."</TE>
<TE>   Javadi, who took up flying two years ago, said there were two
impacts--the first slowed the aircraft by bending a wing. It then
came to rest on a hill.</TE>
<TE>   When daylight broke, Javadi discovered the aircraft was about 20
feet from a 60-foot plunge down a cliff.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a religious person, but maybe an angel was looking out
for us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Javadi got into trouble about 25 minutes after taking off from
Long Beach Municipal Airport.</TE>
<TE>   He was on his way to Temecula to practice nighttime landings, and
though the sky was clear, Javadi said, he became disoriented.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I lost track of where we were in relation to our ground
reference," said Javadi, who owns the plane. "Normally, I don't make
mistakes, but I also know I'm not beyond it."</TE>
<TE>   Javadi asked his nephew, who was reclining in his seat, if he
could help clarify their position. Nima Javadi fumbled frantically
through flight charts. Seconds later, both men saw the treetops.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern was to slow down, so I powered down and put the nose
back," Javadi said. "When we hit the hillside, we were probably doing
about 50 knots," or about 46 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Once the men made sure the plane would not shift and there were no
fuel leaks, they notified the control tower of their position: 3,000
elevation and about eight miles west of Interstate 15 near Indian
Truck Trail Road.</TE>
<TE>   Because they were in the Cleveland National Forest, they decided
to stay overnight inside the plane.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't know where we were going," said Nima Javadi, 25. "And
we didn't know what kind of animals we'd find out there."</TE>
<TE>   Wearing sandals, jeans and a short-sleeved shirt, Dariush Javadi
stuffed his feet in a torn seat cushion. His nephew was wearing
khakis, a long-sleeved shirt and boots, so he gave his uncle his
flight gloves.</TE>
<TE>   "It also helped that the plane was on a 30-degree angle and I was
pressed against my nephew's body," Javadi said. "We kept each other
warm."</TE>
<TE>   After keeping in contact with authorities throughout the sleepless
night, the men were airlifted to Inland Valley Regional Medical
Center in Wildomar about 8:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Personnel from the U.S. Forest Service, the California Department
of Forestry and the Riverside County Sheriff's Department search and
rescue team joined in the rescue.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after his ordeal had ended, Javadi felt lucky to be talking
about it on his nephew's cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like I've hit the lottery," he said. "Not too many
people get a chance to talk about something like this. It's amazing."</TE>

<HD>Man Charged in Slaying of Deer at Scout Camp</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A camouflaged man who allegedly snuck into a Yorba Linda Boy Scout
Camp, killed a deer with arrows, then cut off the animal's head as a
trophy, was charged Thursday with many fish-and-game violations.</LD>
<LD>   A man who accompanied him was charged with a misdemeanor because
police say he did not participate in the killing.</LD>
<LD>   The charges stem from an Oct. 11 incident in which Darin Jay
Hofmann, 26, of Chino and Eric Martin, 24, of Redlands allegedly
roamed through the Firestone Boy Scout Reservation toting compound
bows and the head of an eight-point mule deer.</LD>
<TE>   Although it was out of season and the park was off-limits to
hunters, the men told a fish and game officer they frequently hunted
in the hilly camp. Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Nick Thompson
said the men also endangered Scouts who may have been hiking or
camping in the area and risked traumatizing youths who may have
stumbled upon the deer's carcass.</TE>
<TE>   Hofmann will appear in court Friday on charges of felony animal
killing, hunting out of season, trespassing and wasting game meat,
among others. Martin, charged with a misdemeanor, will appear in
court later. Hofmann was convicted in 1988 of a similar game-code
violation when he crept onto the property of a Glendora cemetery,
captured a swan and broke its neck. Hofmann had just attended a
nearby house party and brought the dead bird back and left it on the
host's front lawn. Thompson said the defendant had also tossed a dead
squirrel into the man's car on an earlier outing and apparently did
so because the vehicle owner was opposed to the killing of animals.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this crime is pretty egregious," Thompson said. "Not only
does he cast a bad light on hunters who obey the law, but his history
is troubling. He appears to kill animals for the sheer pleasure of
it."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Hofmann nor Martin could be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>D.A. Supports Taking DNA From Prisoners</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas is pushing for legislation
that would authorize state prison officials to use "reasonable force"
to obtain DNA samples from inmates.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed law would cover inmates who are required to give a
DNA sample but have refused to. Rackauckas said the samples could
help law enforcement link inmates to unsolved crimes. "I am tired of
victims having to overcome hurdles in order to obtain justice,"
Rackauckas said in a written statement released by his office
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   A 1998 law requires prisoners convicted of crimes such as sexual
assault and murder to provide DNA samples.</LD>
<TE>   Those samples are added to a statewide database used to link
crimes. The database, which currently has 167,000 samples, has
connected 83 violent crimes to inmates, according to the district
attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   But 900 prisoners statewide have refused to provide a sample.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas said 12 other states allow prison officials to use
"reasonable force" to obtain DNA samples.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Jim Brulte (R-San Bernardino) and Assemblyman Lou
Correa (D-Anaheim) are working with Rackauckas on the legislation.</TE>

<HD>Judge Orders Removal of PUC Member</HD>
<DH>Court: Henry Duque bought stock in phone firm with business
before panel. He denies wrongdoing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A judge ruled Thursday that Henry M. Duque, the lone Republican on
the California Public Utilities Commission, should be removed from
office because he violated conflict-of-interest laws by buying stock
in a telecommunications company regulated by the commission.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco Superior Court Judge Alfred Chiantelli also fined
Duque $5,000 and ordered him to pay court costs and attorney's fees
for a consumer group that sued to strip Duque of his $107,000-a-year
job.</LD>
<LD>   The judge gave Duque 10 days to voice any objections before the
ruling becomes final.</LD>
<TE>   Through his attorney, Duque said he would challenge the ruling if
it becomes final and will seek permission to stay in office during
the appeal. His term expires on Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Duque, a seven-year veteran of the PUC, invested $10,000 in 1999
in Nextel Communications, a mobile phone company that sometimes has
business before the panel. Duque reported the investment on financial
disclosure statements filed with the state. Then in August 2000--two
days after a San Francisco Chronicle reporter inquired about the
stock--he disposed of the stock.</TE>
<TE>   With the official blessing of the state attorney general, the
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights later in 2000 sued Duque
on behalf of the public. During a one-day trial in December, Duque
said he relied on the assurances of his stockbroker that Nextel was
regulated by the federal government, not the PUC, and was not aware
of the company's business before the commission.</TE>
<TE>   "I told [my broker] I could not and would not own stock in
companies we regulated," Duque testified. He said he provided no list
of companies the PUC regulated because there was none.</TE>
<TE>   However, the judge's ruling said, "Reliance on his stockbroker is
insufficient ... because Duque had a duty to keep himself informed of
his investments so that he would not be in conflict with his position
of trust. His failure to fulfill this duty should not serve as a
defense, otherwise the law would encourage willful blindness.</TE>
<TE>   "This court does not find that Duque is dishonest," Chiantelli
added. "This is not a case of bad faith but bad judgment."</TE>
<TE>   The judge specifically faulted Duque for failing to seek a
definitive legal opinion on whether Nextel was regulated by the PUC,
especially after the commission in February 2000 issued notice that
it was establishing consumer protection rules that would apply to all
telecommunications companies.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Remcho, who is representing Duque, said Duque is
disappointed with the ruling but gratified that the judge did not
conclude he was deliberately violating any law.</TE>
<TE>   "In our view, the law provides no penalty for innocently holding
the stock, let alone the harsh remedy of exclusion from office,"
Remcho said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Pamela Pressley, attorney for the Foundation for Taxpayer and
Consumer Rights in Santa Monica, said, "This is a big victory for the
public's interest in having public officials stay completely free of
financial conflicts. As PUC commissioners, they have to decide major
issues that affect these companies. Ultimately it may seem harsh, but
that is reality."</TE>
<TE>   Although the lawsuit contended that Duque's office was vacated the
moment he purchased Nextel stock, Pressley said there is no legal
provision to erase the hundreds of votes he has cast since then.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC regulates not only retail natural gas and electricity
rates but also many matters that affect wireless phone companies,
including area codes and agreements with wired phone companies.</TE>
<TE>   The judge noted that there were five instances in which issues
related to Nextel or wireless carriers arose at the PUC. In March
2000, for example, Duque voted for an interconnection agreement
between Pacific Bell and Nextel as a consent-agenda item approved en
masse by the five commissioners. In November 1999, Duque voted
against Nextel's interests after wireless carriers filed petitions
for the allocation of phone codes in the 310 area code.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer gave the foundation permission in November
2000 to pursue Duque's removal from office on behalf of the people of
the state. Lockyer spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said Thursday, "The
judge has affirmed what we would come to expect--that a PUC
commissioner would be sure to avoid a financial conflict of
interest--and the Constitution clearly says you can't have one and be
a commissioner."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Republican Richard Bilas resigned from the PUC for
health reasons and out of frustration with commission policies. That
left Duque, a former banking executive who was appointed in 1995 by
Gov. Pete Wilson, as the last GOP commissioner. He and Bilas often
were on the losing end of 3-2 votes.</TE>

<HD>Worker Falls in Chemical Vat; 9 Go to Hospital</HD>
<DH>Accident: Two Garden Grove employees suffer burns, 7
rescuers feel effects of the industrial cleaning solution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine people were injured Thursday in a chemical accident at a Garden
Grove wheel-manufacturing plant after a worker fell into a
14-foot-deep vat of cleaning solution, fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The victim apparently became unconscious after hitting his head on
a metal grate inside the vat, which contained tetrachloroethylene, a
cleaning product, fire and company employees said.</LD>
<LD>   A second employee at the firm, Roadster Wheels on Industry Street,
suffered chemical burns in trying to rescue the man and later
complained of breathing difficulty. Company officials said the victim
was the owner's son and the worker who came to his aid was his
brother.</LD>
<TE>   Both were taken to the burn center at UCI Medical Center in
Orange.</TE>
<TE>   The cleaning chemical is a colorless liquid used as a degreaser
and drying agent. It is nonflammable and smells like ether. It is
moderately toxic and an irritant to eyes and skin.</TE>
<TE>   Five firefighters and two employees from an ambulance firm also
were taken to a hospital after complaining of difficulty breathing
and irritated skin.</TE>
<TE>   The identities of those involved were not released, including the
names of the brothers.</TE>
<TE>   ''You have to understand that this is an emotional time for us
right now,'' a company spokesman said. Both men remain hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   The first victim was too heavy--at about 300 pounds--for his
brother to pull him out, authorities said. Firefighters tried to lift
him out, but the walls of the vat were too high. Eventually they
rigged a line over a beam above the vat to pull both men out, said
Battalion Chief David Barlag.</TE>
<TE>   The worker wore street clothes and had no protective clothing or
equipment, which might have prevented or lessened his injuries,
Barlag said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to police, Cal/OSHA was investigating the accident to
determine how and why the man had fallen.</TE>

<HD>Security Grilles Fail Inspection</HD>
<DH>Schools: Quick-release screens ordered two years ago still
aren't in place at almost half of L.A. Unified sites, inspection
determines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly half of the Los Angeles city schools inspected in a new safety
program had classrooms where students could become trapped behind
security grilles in an emergency, an analysis of district records
shows.</LD>
<LD>   Inspectors have cited 151 of the 315 campuses they evaluated for
failure to comply with a 2-year-old policy requiring a quick-release
grille to be installed in every classroom that has anti-break-in
grilles bolted over its windows.</LD>
<LD>   The district is still short about 8,000 of the latched or
breakaway grilles, which cost about $250 apiece, more than twice the
cost of the fixed grilles.</LD>
<TE>   Gene Krischer, a school watchdog whose complaints about grilles
inspired the 2000 board policy, said he still worries constantly
about the possibility of a tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   "God forbid if ... a student [got] injured or killed," Krischer
said. "This would be a blow to the district [that] it would never
recover from.''</TE>
<TE>   During their first systematic safety examination in decades,
inspectors have also found thousands of other violations of state law
and school board policies covering everything from the absence of
safety management plans to the improper use of hazardous chemicals.
The ongoing inspections, which have covered about half of the
campuses in the district, offer a strong indication of safety
conditions districtwide.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say that this indicates a significant percentage of
noncompliance with many of the standards," said Angelo Bellomo,
director of the district's Office of Environmental Health and Safety.
"It certainly suggests to me there is a lot of work to do."</TE>
<TE>   He described the conditions, however, as similar to those found in
most large urban school districts. And he noted that the inspections
have not uncovered any imminent hazards to students, such as the lead
and asbestos findings that caused portions of several schools to be
closed for cleanup over the past 2 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not think there is cause for alarm," Bellomo said of the
overall findings. "I think there is cause for action."</TE>
<TE>   About 60% of the problems can be resolved by improved safety
procedures at the schools, inspectors said. The rest will require
extra funds--an unlikely prospect during a year in which an estimated
$400 million must be cut from the district's $9-billion budget.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three-Part Plan to Bring Compliance</TE>
<TE>   The safety program, covering all of the district's campuses and
administrative sites, is intended to break an entrenched practice of
ignoring problems because there is no money to fix them.</TE>
<TE>   Bellomo said the program will keep a focus on safety and begin
steps to bring all schools into compliance over time.</TE>
<TE>   The program has three parts. The first was preparation of a
guidebook bringing all state, local and district regulations into a
single document. The second is a model safety plan now in development
that every school can adapt for its own circumstances. The third will
be annual inspections to keep up the pressure for compliance.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to find these conditions and we want to correct them,"
Bellomo said.</TE>
<TE>   In this first round of inspections, the conditions documented vary
widely from school to school. Twenty-four schools sailed through with
only five or fewer citations.</TE>
<TE>   On average, there were nearly 26 violations per school, with five
classified as high-priority, meaning they are serious violations of
law requiring immediate attention.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Problems in Less Affluent Areas</TE>
<TE>   Overall, schools on the Westside and in the west San Fernando
Valley had fewer problems than those in less affluent areas.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, University High School in West Los Angeles had two
high-priority violations, both dealing with peeling paint, and only
three altogether. By contrast, the 116th Street Elementary School in
South-Central Los Angeles had 72 violations, 19 classified as
serious. They ranged from inadequate lighting to a cracked playground
surface.</TE>
<TE>   More typical is South-Central's 109th Street Elementary School, an
old campus with one original building and dozens of portable
classrooms of various ages. Although it appears fairly
well-maintained, inspectors found 32 violations.</TE>
<TE>   Students entering one second-grade classroom must step over an
electrical cord connecting the overhead projector to one of the few
outlets in the room. The teacher, Maria Fregoso, has made a mural of
construction paper to mask a corner where the paint is scaling off.
Some mornings, the odor of mold fills the building.</TE>
<TE>   Plant manager Florida Daniels traced the problem to a storm drain
that leaks into a wall.</TE>
<TE>   After she made calls to three different departments, Daniels said,
a sheet metal crew responded a month or so ago.</TE>
<TE>   "They wrote something down," Daniels said. "They haven't been
back."</TE>
<TE>   Like many other schools, 109th Street Elementary was also cited
for fixed security grilles.</TE>
<TE>   Across the district, the lack of breakaway grilles represented one
of the most troubling violations--not only because of the potential
risk, but also because district officials had told the board nearly a
year ago that the problem was solved.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very disappointed," board member Julie Korenstein said. She
wrote the board policy requiring latches after learning that
thousands of fixed grilles were being installed on classroom windows,
often in violation of a state law requiring at least two escape
routes from every classroom.</TE>
<TE>   The board policy is more stringent than the state law, calling for
at least one escape window in every classroom, whether it has one
door or two.</TE>
<TE>   Korenstein said she insisted on the tougher standard because of
the possibility that both of a classroom's doors could be jammed in
an earthquake. That happened at one school during the 1994 Northridge
earthquake, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In an April memo, Lynn Roberts, who was then in charge of
maintenance and operations, told Korenstein that workers were
manufacturing and installing the quick-release grilles as fast as
possible, and that at least one bolted grille had been removed in all
classrooms that still lacked a quick-release mechanism.</TE>
<TE>   "In an effort to comply with this order, [maintenance and
operations] removed any permanent grilles that did not adhere to the
new instructions given by the Board of Education" that each class
should have one window escape route, the memo said.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts said there was not any intent to mislead the board. The
memo should have said that all classrooms were in compliance with the
city ordinance but not the board policy, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But the inspection program also has turned up instances where
classrooms with only one door still have fixed grilles, in violation
of the state law.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't surprise me if there were a few out here," Roberts
said, conceding that work crews could have missed some. "They were
directed to go out there and remove them. That's what I was told,
that we had done that."</TE>
<TE>   Doug Dunivan, director of maintenance, said the grille replacement
is taking years because the board never provided extra money to pay
for manufacturing and installing the new equipment.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the district's shop had to work on making the safety
grilles piecemeal, along with its other duties.</TE>
<TE>   So far, more than 12,000 breakaway screens have been made, but not
all have been installed, Dunivan said.</TE>
<TE>   After grilles, the second most common serious violation was the
presence of prohibited chemicals, logged at 123 schools. Inspectors
cited 115 schools for failure to have a required fire extinguisher in
place and 117 for potentially hazardous peeling paint. Peeling paint
poses the risk of exposing children to lead.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the less serious violations involved poor upkeep.</TE>
<TE>   Failure to maintain school grounds and equipment in good repair
was cited at 218 campuses and unsafe storage of items on high shelves
at 214.</TE>
<TE>   Electrical cords were being improperly used in place of fixed
wiring at 156 schools, and inadequate lighting was cited at 106.</TE>

<HD>Carpool Lanes May Be Delayed</HD>
<DH>Freeway: State turns down MTA request to speed up funding
for project on I-5 in San Fernando Valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A vital carpool lane extension on Interstate 5 in the San Fernando
Valley could be delayed by up to four years after a state agency
Thursday turned down a request to speed up funding for the project,
local officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The slowdown is the result of the California Transportation
Commission's approval of a five-year budget that does not include
$193 million requested by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
to help complete carpool lanes in both directions on the Golden State
Freeway, between the 134 and 170 freeways.</LD>
<LD>   MTA officials said the funding would have allowed them to complete
the job by 2007. Now they will likely need until 2011. MTA Chief
Executive Roger Snoble decried the decision, saying carpool lanes in
the Valley are "one of the few things we can do and do quickly to
provide some congestion relief."</LD>
<TE>   The state commission approved $650 million to help pay for other
key Los Angeles County freeway improvements. It did not OK the I-5
carpool lane project because the MTA simply failed to indicate it was
a priority, the state agency's top official said.</TE>
<TE>   The decision on the San Fernando Valley carpool lanes was met with
deep disappointment at the MTA's downtown Los Angeles headquarters,
where Snoble has touted the creation of a full-fledged network of
carpool lanes throughout the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials acknowledged they had not made the lanes a priority
in initial funding requests, but said they shifted gears in recent
months to make it clear to state officials how crucial the lanes are
in their plans.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we could keep the door open and we had a chance to work
something out," said Snoble, who added that he is certain the project
will be built. Now, it's likely his agency will have to wait for the
next budget cycle by the state officials, Snoble said. The MTA could
also look to other sources, such as a bond issue.</TE>
<TE>   Also disappointed was Richard Katz, co-chair of the San Fernando
Valley Transportation Strike Force, a group trying to implement
transit improvements in the area. He said the decision shows that the
state transportation commission "can't figure out what is important"
to the Los Angeles area and that its members spend too much time
"driving around in Northern California."</TE>
<TE>   But commission Executive Director Diane Eidam defended the
decision. "Our priority was to fund the projects they had an absolute
priority for," she said. "It just was not feasible this time around."</TE>
<TE>   Eidam noted that the MTA could have another shot at the money in
two years, when the state commission reexamines its budget.</TE>

<HD>Police Want No Part in Enforcing Immigration</HD>
<DH>Law: Justice Department proposal calls for officers to turn
in illegal border crossers. Civil liberties may be at risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a post-Sept. 11 world, it seems a most logical proposal: Why not
let state and local police help the obviously overwhelmed federal
government find and deport illegal immigrants?</LD>
<LD>   But the Justice Department idea floated this week has already run
into fierce opposition--from immigrant advocates and law enforcement
agencies in California and elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, still preliminary, could result in greater leeway for
state and local officers in enforcing immigration laws. Yet many
officers are definitively saying, "No thanks."</LD>
<TE>   "We already have enough to do," said Dave Cohen, a spokesman for
the San Diego Police Department. The same sentiments were echoed
among police officials in Los Angeles and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The debate pits heightened terrorism concerns against
long-entrenched arguments linked to civil liberties, the nation's
history as a haven for immigrants and refugees, and the importance of
large-scale immigration to the United States' economy.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say three of the 19 Sept11 hijackers were in the country
illegally. One of the presumed core plotters--Nawaf Alhazmi, a Saudi
national and former San Diego resident who helped crash a jet into
the Pentagon--received a speeding ticket in Oklahoma, but his expired
visa went unnoticed as the state police officer recorded his
California driver's license.</TE>
<TE>   Why, many ask, should local police maintain a hands-off policy
toward immigration-law violators? Especially at a time when the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, with 2,000 agents in the
nation's interior, clearly cannot handle an illegal immigrant
population now believed to have soared past 8million?</TE>
<TE>   "Taxpayers have a reasonable expectation of cooperation--close
cooperation--between every level of enforcement in our government,"
said Bill King, a former Border Patrol sector chief and top INS
official in California, who is retired. "Take a look at L.A.: It's
the illegal alien capital of the country. And they certainly don't
have enough resources in the INS to do the job."</TE>
<TE>   That's not the way things are viewed at LAPD headquarters, where
the notion of enforcing immigration statutes was greeted like the
arrival of an unpleasant in-law.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of our immigrant population here and our diverse
communities, we don't want to alienate anybody, or give anybody any
fear," said Sgt. John Pasquariello, an LAPD spokesman. "That's just
not our policy. Hasn't been for 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   It was in Los Angeles, capital of the current wave of immigration
that took off in the 1970s, that the issue of local police and
immigration policy first came into intense focus.</TE>
<TE>   The rapid demographic shifts convinced former Police Chief Daryl
F. Gates--hardly a misty-eyed liberal--that it was time for officers
to get out of the immigration business.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Touchstone of Law Enforcement</TE>
<TE>   The result: Special Order 40, a trailblazing 1979 directive that
generally prevents officers from quizzing people about their
immigration status or turning otherwise law-abiding citizens over to
the INS. The measure has become a touchstone of law enforcement here
ever since, despite complaints that police frequently violate its
terms and spirit.</TE>
<TE>   New York, San Francisco, Chicago and other cities followed with
similar policies.</TE>
<TE>   Underlying this philosophy is a fundamental policing goal: to
encourage new arrivals who may not speak English--many from homelands
where police were feared as thieves or torturers--to come forward and
report crimes, either as victims or witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   But advocates of stricter immigration controls argue that now
priority must be given to averting infiltration by foreign
malefactors.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the ... federal government's inability to locate suspected
terrorists within our borders, there can be no justification for not
providing local law enforcement with the training they need to help
in this effort,'" said Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.), who heads a
congressional group favoring cuts in immigration.</TE>
<TE>   People who share Tancredo's views have long tried to bring local
police into the immigration fight. In a similar vein, the authors of
Proposition 187, the successful 1994 California ballot initiative
later largely struck down by a federal judge, included a provision
requiring state and local police officers to turn in suspected
illegal immigrants to the INS.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by the California measure, Congress in 1996 authorized
the deputizing of state and local police to enforce immigration law.
The INS devised a training regimen, but the response was tepid. Only
officials in Salt Lake City responded seriously; civil rights and
Latino activists in Utah successfully fought back the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, the late 1990s economic boom served to reduce opposition
to immigration, as both major parties wooed the growing numbers of
Latino voters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   September Attacks Have Revived Interest</TE>
<TE>   But officials say Sept. 11 has led to revived interest in enhanced
cooperation between local police and the INS. That is what prompted
the Justice Department to declare this week that it was reviewing an
internal legal opinion that bars state and local authorities from
making arrests for civil violations of immigration law, such as being
in the country illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say immigration dragnets by local police would be
counterproductive to fighting terrorism, forcing people deeper
underground and leaving police less time to combat violent crime.
Critics immediately cited a likely wave of racial profiling.</TE>
<TE>   "This would overburden local police, and you wouldn't get any of
the anti-terrorism targeting that you want," said Robert Bach, a
former high-ranking INS official in the Clinton administration. "It's
a back door to bad immigration enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   Wrong, said King, the 35-year INS veteran. "It would help get rid
of illegal aliens, because any cop can identify an illegal alien in
two seconds flat. They're breaking the law and nobody's doing
anything about it."</TE>

<HD>Conflict Hits Home</HD>
<DH>Decision: Melissa Kahn must return to Israel to finish her
studies, but the region's continued violence gives her pause.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Medical student Melissa Kahn has two choices: Board a plane Saturday
for Israel and live in fear she may not see her husband and toddler
again. Or stay at her parents' Calabasas home and forfeit a pathology
degree she is six weeks shy of earning at Tel Aviv University,
through a New York school's study-abroad program.</LD>
<LD>   As violence continues in the Middle East, major school systems
nationwide, including the University of California, have urged their
students in Israel to return home. Other study programs in the
country have reported a drop in applications, and the U.S. State
Department this week offered to evacuate diplomats' dependents.</LD>
<LD>   Kahn, 28, said she wants to finish her graduation requirements in
America, but Sackler School of Medicine in New York expects her to be
in Tel Aviv by 8 a.m. Tuesday. "What if something happens to me? I
have a daughter," said Kahn, sipping coffee at her parents' kitchen
table on a weekday morning during her Passover vacation.</LD>
<TE>   At first Kahn, a thin woman with a bouncing bob haircut, appeared
calm, but as she reflected on her plight, her blue eyes teared up,
and she began nervously swinging her right foot.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel comfortable going back," said Kahn, who has heard
bombs explode near her Tel Aviv apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Marcia Warner, the executive director of the Sackler medical
program, said the school tries to work with students, but generally
they must follow curriculum guidelines to obtain a degree--and that
means completing many of their requirements in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "Each student makes his own judgment," Warner said. "But we have
certain standards."</TE>
<TE>   Warner declined to comment on Kahn's situation without reviewing
academic records and other materials. She also cited confidentiality
issues.</TE>
<TE>   Sackler officials said highly trained guards protect the Tel Aviv
campus, and the university brings in experts to inform the faculty
and students about the conflict. The officials said the violence has
not spread to the campus.</TE>
<TE>   The school issued a memo Thursday telling students it will
reimburse them for using taxicabs, so they can avoid public
transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn said the school should be more flexible with its U.S.
students. She needs to finish two three-week hospital rotations for
her degree and says she should be allowed to do so at a California
institution.</TE>
<TE>   She has discussed that possibility with doctors at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, where she is to begin her residency on June 24. A
hospital spokeswoman declined to comment without knowing specifics.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Harvey J. Fields of Wilshire Boulevard Temple said he
understands "the skittish feelings about going to a part of the world
where there is a lot of danger." But he encourages Jews and non-Jews
to visit Israel to show their support for the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Exercise caution and good sense" by avoiding volatile areas such
as the Gaza Strip and West Bank, said Fields, who recently returned
from a two-week trip to Israel. "There is no reason not to go."</TE>
<TE>   Kahn said she feels torn. "I have a deep love for the Jewish
homeland," Kahn said. "It's a sacred place.... I would like to
support Israel."</TE>
<TE>   She paused and looked out the kitchen window at a jet flying above
the San Fernando Valley. Her daughter Emma, who turns 2 in May,
usually waves "bye-bye" at airplanes, knowing that her mother is
scheduled to be on one soon.</TE>
<TE>   "If I have to, I will get on that plane," Kahn said, sighing. "My
husband and daughter can't come to Israel, because if something
happened, 'Poof!' That would be the end of the Kahn family."</TE>

<HD>Priests' Accuser Passes Lie Detector</HD>
<DH>Church: Lori Haigh says two O.C. clerics ignored her pleas
for help. Test's administrator says, 'She's telling the truth.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lori Haigh, who won a million-dollar settlement from the Roman
Catholic Church this week, passed a lie-detector test Thursday in her
attempt to prove allegations that two priests--now top officials in
the Diocese of Orange--ignored her pleas for help 20 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   In a press conference Monday, Msgr. Lawrence J. Baird, the
high-profile diocesan spokesman, threatened Haigh with a defamation
of character lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   She had earlier in the day named him as the unidentified priest in
her lawsuit who she claims kissed, hugged and rubbed himself against
her after she confessed to him a relationship with another priest.
She said she was 16 at the time.</LD>
<TE>   Haigh, now 37, also named Msgr. John Urell, vicar general of the
Orange diocese, as the other unidentified priest in the lawsuit. She
alleges that he called her a liar when she told him about her sexual
relationship with Father John Lenihan and told her to stay away from
the church.</TE>
<TE>   Urell, who was out of town this week, has denied the allegations,
church officials said. The monsignor handles the accusations of
priest sexual abuse for the diocese.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just yet another indiction of a victim telling the truth
and being further victimized by a priest who threatened a defamation
lawsuit," said Katherine K. Freberg, Haigh's attorney. "We challenge
Msgr. Baird to take a lie-detector test from a qualified
polygrapher."</TE>
<TE>   Baird and other church officials could not be reached for comment
Thursday evening.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh's lawsuit alleged Lenihan sexually molested her, got her
pregnant at age 16 and paid for the abortion. Lenihan has not
admitted to any of the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   The two-hour lie-detector test, which was paid for by Haigh, was
administered in Los Angeles by Dr. Edward I. Gelb, past president of
the American Polygraph Assn.</TE>
<TE>   He said Haigh scored "plus-15" on the test, adding that only
plus-4 is needed as conclusive evidence that she was not lying about
her meetings with Baird and Urell.</TE>
<TE>   "She's telling the truth," said Gelb, whose celebrity clients
include the parents of JonBenet Ramsey and Snoop Dogg.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh, a San Francisco mother of two, said she quickly set up the
test because she felt "re-victimized" when Baird told the media he
did not remember meeting her, has never made "inappropriate contact"
with anyone in 33 years as a priest and has "no idea what motivates
her to make such an insidious allegation."</TE>
<TE>   Haigh had attended Baird's press conference, saying she didn't
think he could lie to her face.</TE>
<TE>   "It crushed me," she said. "It reminded me of Urell telling me in
his office that I was lying. And there was Baird, telling the world I
was a liar."</TE>
<TE>   In settling Haigh's lawsuit, Bishop of Orange Tod D. Brown said,
"[I am] deeply sorry for the hurt caused by the actions of Father
Lenihan, and extend my apology to Ms. Haigh."</TE>
<TE>   Haigh said she broke down and cried when Gelb told her the test
results.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't control myself," she said. "I haven't cried like that
in years. It was a great release."</TE>

<LD>I've never been in the public relations business, so Cardinal Roger
Mahony can feel perfectly free to ignore the advice I have for him
regarding the sex abuse scandal. But it seems to me the Los Angeles
archdiocese is in desperate need of assistance.</LD>
<LD>   In an effort to "clear the air," Mahony met with a Los Angeles
Times reporter this week, which was a very good idea on his part. But
it seems to me that "clearing the air" entails answering some
questions, and as reporter Larry B. Stammer pointed out in his story,
the cardinal did not exactly knock the ball out of the park in this
regard.</LD>
<LD>   It would have been nice to finally find out how many priests
Mahony dismissed recently, so we don't have to keep referring to a
number between six and 12. Heck, it would have been nice to at least
have the span narrowed a little. I mean, Mahony could have said, "OK,
it's between seven and 11 priests, or between eight and 10." Over the
course of several weeks, taking little steps, he might have gradually
worked his way to the truth.</LD>
<TE>   But no. We got nothing out of him.</TE>
<TE>   I've seen a memo that suggests the number is eight. If it's true,
what does the cardinal have to lose from sharing this with us? By not
telling us the real number, we're left with no choice but to wonder
if maybe it's even more than between six and 12.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was between eight and 14. Or maybe the cardinal doesn't
even know himself, and is embarrassed to admit it.</TE>
<TE>   Now here's another question: Was it out of line for me to think
that in clearing the air, the cardinal might actually explain what
these six to 12 priests did, where they did it and to whom?</TE>
<TE>   Can't we at least get ballpark figures on the number of victims?
Was it between six and 12, 12 and 24, or 24 and 48?</TE>
<TE>   Again, nothing but stonewalling.</TE>
<TE>   If you're not going to answer basic questions, all you accomplish
is to keep getting those very questions tossed back at you.</TE>
<TE>   I know this to be true because just Thursday, I e-mailed the
cardinal a few questions that have been gnawing at me.</TE>
<TE>   To name just one, I still don't understand how an undisclosed
number of priests, some of whom the cardinal admits have been through
the criminal justice system, only recently became a matter of
concern.</TE>
<TE>   I thought a zero-tolerance policy was just that, and then we find
out that known sex offenders were hanging around doing who knows
what?</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal e-mailed me back to say he wasn't answering any of my
questions.</TE>
<TE>   His prerogative, of course. But it's just not good PR.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal did tell Stammer he's concerned that releasing any
names would invade the privacy of the victims, which sounds
wonderfully compassionate and even makes perfect sense until you
consider that we don't publish the names of sex abuse victims unless
they want us to.</TE>
<TE>   So I don't know what to think, except that maybe the archdiocese
isn't providing the names of these sex offenders for a reason other
than all-around warmth and goodness.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the diocese is afraid that the priests who were still on the
payroll had multiple victims, and that if the names were published,
it would bring more lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "Cardinal Egan released all the names in New York, and I'd like to
see Mahony do the same thing," Sue Griffith said Thursday as she
prepared to leave her home in Long Beach and join in a demonstration
outside archdiocese headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "As names get out there, victims are coming forward, and they're
the ones who have been suffering in silence and in pain, secrecy and
shame."</TE>
<TE>   Griffith speaks from experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I am the mother of the first victim of Father Ted Llanos to come
forward in Long Beach. Because we were finally able to get his name
out, 20 more victims came forward.</TE>
<TE>   "Cardinal Mahony says his policy of taking care of the victims has
been in place since 1988, but in our case the church used every legal
technique available to keep it from going public.</TE>
<TE>   "When I met with Cardinal Mahony, I told him: 'You know, out of
everyone in the church we've talked to about the molestation of our
son, nobody was outraged, and you're not either.' He said, 'I used to
be outraged; now I'm just saddened.'"</TE>
<TE>   With that, Griffith headed into Los Angeles to keep the heat on, a
mother on a mission, asking nothing more than the truth.</TE>

<HD>Margaret McHugh, 93; Aide to 2 Supreme Court Chief Justices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAEME ZIELINSKI</AU>
<BD>THE WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Margaret Krueger McHugh, the personal secretary to
Chief Justices Fred Vinson and Earl Warren, who was treasured by her
bosses for her firm-handed efficiency and unflagging discretion and
who frequently found herself amid events of great moment, has died.
She was 93.</LD>
<LD>   McHugh died of congestive heart failure March 28 at the Casey
House hospice in Rockville, Md.</LD>
<LD>   She was among the first at the court to greet former California
Gov. Warren in 1954 when he began his 16-year career as chief
justice, and she was with him when he left, helping the ailing
justice compose his memoirs and attending to the estate of the jurist
and his wife, Nina.</LD>
<TE>   McHugh would shuffle past Warren in the Supreme Court's walk-in
safe as he was reading the drafts she was typing on the momentous
Brown vs. Board of Education decision in 1954, and she wrote the note
passed to the chief justice in 1963 to inform him that President
Kennedy had been shot in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Working at the court from 1946 to 1969, she clipped the wings of
generations of young and preening law clerks and kept the chief
justice's work schedule, making sure deadlines were met, opinions
were filed and appointments were on time.</TE>
<TE>   "She had to keep us on the mark and wasn't overly impressed by our
credentials," said Phillip Johnson, a former Warren clerk and now a
law professor at UC Berkeley. "But she had her kindly side and loved
for us to bring our babies in to be introduced to her and the chief."</TE>
<TE>   Warren, writing about his six-day workweeks in his posthumously
published memoirs, recalled going in on Saturdays. "I did not require
my staff to be present, but [she] was always there," he wrote. "I
told her many times that it was not necessary for her to do so....
She was never absent on a business day throughout my 16 years on the
court."</TE>
<TE>   The chief justice never called his secretary by her first name or
her family nickname "Peggy." She was always "McHugh." She saw Warren
for more time than probably anyone else in the building, and her role
was more than that of secretary; she was also a confidant.</TE>
<TE>   In his 1997 Warren biography, "Chief Justice," Ed Cray wrote of
how Warren, distraught at the controversy surrounding Justice Abe
Fortas and a bribery scandal, confided in McHugh in 1969 after a
private meeting with Nixon administration Atty. Gen. John Mitchell.
"Why would Fortas accept $20,000 a year? It doesn't make any sense.
He has to go."</TE>
<TE>   She also was privy to Warren's thoughts about President Eisenhower
and his secretive lobbying of the chief justice in the midst of the
debate over the Brown decision that ruled school segregation illegal.</TE>
<TE>   "Dwight Eisenhower was just completely opposed to the segregation
decision, and the chief justice knew that," she recalled in the Cray
biography.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 22, 1963, she delivered a folded note to a court
attendant, who handed it to Warren: "It was reported that the
president has been shot while riding in a motorcade in Dallas,
Texas."</TE>
<TE>   Though she was witness to history and granted a few interviews for
biographies of Warren, McHugh was a close-mouthed throwback to a
generation of Washington major-domos who rarely spoke of what they
had seen. Her family said she had turned down lucrative book offers.
She kept secret her role in handling the Warren estate.</TE>
<TE>   McHugh was born and raised on a farm in Lincoln Township, Wis. She
attended the University of Wisconsin at Madison and graduated with a
bachelor's degree in English in 1936 from George Washington
University.</TE>
<TE>   She had moved to Washington in the 1930s and worked as a secretary
to Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. during the New Deal era.
She continued working in this capacity for his successor, Fred
Vinson, and then followed Vinson to the Supreme Court when he was
named chief justice in 1946 by President Truman. After Vinson stepped
down, Warren retained her because, he wrote, she "knew every facet of
staff relationships."</TE>
<TE>   Although she never talked much about her obvious affection and
loyalty for Warren, McHugh did say: "He liked things done right. I
liked things done right, so we had no problem there." Warren died in
1974.</TE>
<TE>   McHugh's husband, Robert, whom she married in 1936, died in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   She leaves no immediate survivors.</TE>

<BD>From staff and wire services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two men were arrested Thursday on federal charges that they altered
used aircraft parts and falsely certified other parts as new.</LD>
<LD>   Amanullah Khan, 53, and Ziad Jamil Gammoh, 52, owners of United
Aircraft &amp; Electronics in Anaheim, were indicted on 10 counts of
conspiracy and fraud.</LD>
<LD>   The indictment, issued Wednesday by a federal grand jury in Santa
Ana, accuses Khan and Gammoh of issuing false certifications that
were sent along with the parts to private and military customers.
None of the parts were associated with any crashes or mechanical
failures, said U.S. attorney's spokesman Thom Mrozek.</LD>
<TE>   If convicted on all counts, the men could be sentenced to 140
years in prison.</TE>

<DH>Suit: Incoming head of Performing Arts Center won't be
chairman but will stay on board.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The incoming chairman of the Orange County Performing Arts Center,
whose stock fraud lawsuit against two of the center's largest donors
led to their resignations from the board, said Thursday he will not
take the center's top job.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Tierney, scheduled to become chairman in July, will remain
on the 51-member board, said Roger Kirwan, the center's current
chairman.</LD>
<LD>   Kirwan said he did not expect the defendants in the lawsuit, Henry
Samueli and Henry T. Nicholas III, founders and top executives of
Broadcom, to rejoin the board. Neither of them could be reached for
comment.</LD>
<TE>   Kirwan said Tierney told him of his decision Thursday morning. He
made his official announcement at the board's regular meeting later
in the day.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he was very reluctantly doing it because he felt it was
causing problems for the center, and he had spent 16 years working on
behalf of the center and had no desire to cause problems for the
center and would step aside rather than see that happen,'' Kirwan
said.</TE>
<TE>   The board reacted first with surprised silence. Then board members
stood and applauded, Kirwan said. "There was great sadness on
everyone's faces, including tears on many members' faces,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tierney, who is head of the fitness and nutrition company BodyWise
International Inc., could not be reached for comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In a news release, he said, "Obviously, it was never my, nor
anyone's, intent to cause a problem for the Center. I hope that by my
stepping aside, we can properly direct our energies to fulfilling the
Center's mission and move forward with our expansion."</TE>
<TE>   Three board members in addition to Tierney are among the 26
plaintiffs in the Broadcom lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, which the Broadcom executives dismissed as frivolous,
contends that Broadcom inflated sales and earnings by improperly
accounting for certain expenses.</TE>
<TE>   This boosted Broadcom's stock price, which allowed Nicholas,
Samueli and William J. Reuhle, chief financial officer, to sell at
least $80 million in stock options before the company's shares
dropped drastically last fall, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Kirwan said the executive committee will recommend its choice for
chairman at its meeting in two weeks. The full board will vote on the
candidate at its next meeting, in May. That person would take over in
July.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit and the board resignations created tensions among
Orange County arts leaders and charity benefactors since its filing
was reported in The Times last month.</TE>
<TE>   "People are taking sides on this issue," Zelma Allred, a member of
the performing arts center's executive committee, said last week.</TE>
<TE>   The situation has led to strained social encounters at charitable
events. At a UC Irvine awards ceremony two weeks ago, Samueli and his
wife, Susan, found themselves in the same ballroom as Tierney and his
wife, Elizabeth.</TE>
<TE>   "Conversation has become awkward at arts gatherings," said Martin
Hubbard, executive director of Opera Pacific. "It has changed the
dynamics of what's being talked about and how it's being talked
about."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy comes at a delicate time for the performing arts
center, which is in the midst of a $200-million campaign to build a
2,000-seat concert hall and a 500-seat theater next to the
3,000-capacity Segerstrom Hall.</TE>

<HD>An Out of the Way Scene, but Not an Isolated Case of
Violence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A small bouquet of flowers is tied to a pole in the carport. It seems
an unlikely place for a reminder of yet another act of violence, but
that's the way it is. The terrible things people do to each other and
themselves happen anywhere, anytime.</LD>
<LD>   This time it was outside an apartment complex in San Clemente, way
down on the southern tip of Orange County and, despite being hard by
the rumble of the San Diego Freeway, somewhat off the beaten path.</LD>
<LD>   That said, there's no such thing as off the beaten path when it
comes to violence. Near this killing scene is a state park. Right
behind the apartment complex is a community baseball diamond. But
these otherwise reassuring suggestions of the idyllic life guarantee
nothing.</LD>
<TE>   Like a lot of us, I've been absorbed recently by the violence in
the Mideast. Neighbor can't get along with neighbor. Disputes that
should be resolved aren't. And so we see an endless procession of
death marches and funerals in Israel and the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   With that violence scrawled daily on a giant world canvas, I went
down to San Clemente late in the afternoon two days after the
shooting that involved two neighbors. What happened down there
sounded like nothing less than a miniaturized, personalized version
of what we see and read every day from the Mideast.</TE>
<TE>   Marisa Hidalgo saw its aftermath, about 9 a.m. Monday. She lives
in an apartment across a driveway that separates her building from
the row of carports for the neighboring apartments. "It's traumatic,"
she says, talking from a second-floor balcony. "I could close my eyes
later and still see it."</TE>
<TE>   What she and others saw were the bodies of two men, one who had
lived directly upstairs from the other. It's not clear what kind of
relationship the neighbors had, except that the Sheriff's Department
says the man who was shot had gone upstairs a couple of weeks ago and
asked the other man to keep the noise down.</TE>
<TE>   The department says their meeting wasn't an angry one. But in
recent days, police say, the upstairs tenant had received an official
notice from management about noise coming from his apartment. He had
that note when he confronted his downstairs neighbor Monday morning
in the carport.</TE>
<TE>   Shot dead was Jaroslav Liska, 47. He was carrying groceries and
was on the way to spend a day at Disneyland with his girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   After shooting Liska, police say, 25-year-old Peter Mehran shot
himself. The two bodies were probably 15 feet apart when Hidalgo saw
them.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see people killed every day," she said, still shaken two
days afterward. "For me, this is burned into my memory."</TE>
<TE>   Hidalgo's downstairs neighbor is Lisa Patterson. The two kidded
that they've learned to accommodate each other. When you live in such
close quarters, Patterson says, you'd better find ways to make peace
because you can always find things to irritate you about how other
people behave.</TE>
<TE>   "It all comes down to how mature people can be," Patterson says.</TE>
<TE>   There's no need to stretch the analogy of one man shooting another
to that of Israelis fighting Palestinians. No need because we know
all too well that disputes that should be resolved between neighbors,
either international or local, too often serve up nothing more than
funerals.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say that Mehran apparently had plans to kill his
brother who lives in San Diego, and that confronting Liska may have
been an irrational reaction to the notice from management about the
noise complaint. However, neighbors reported some arguing in the
carport, and authorities have concluded that Mehran's shooting of
Liska wasn't random.</TE>
<TE>   No, Mehran knew who he was killing before he took his own life.</TE>
<TE>   The answer to why goes with him to that familiar place where most
crazed gunmen end up--their graves.</TE>

<HD>Family in Sex Case Targets Schools</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Attorney is hired to learn what Camarillo
educators knew of alleged abuse involving teacher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While a criminal investigation continues into a Camarillo teacher
accused of having sex with students, an attorney has been hired by
the family of an alleged victim to determine how much and when school
officials knew about the alleged activity.</LD>
<LD>   Brenda Andrade of Ventura said she represents one of 11 alleged
male victims of Camarillo High science teacher Chad Pridgen, 30, who
is scheduled to be arraigned today on six new charges.</LD>
<LD>   The boy's father wants to know whether teachers and administrators
knew or should have known teens were frequenting Pridgen's home for
weekend parties that authorities say included alcohol, pornography
and sexual abuse, Andrade said.</LD>
<TE>   "Given that so many boys were allegedly molested and the extended
time period in which this happened, he finds it difficult to believe
the school had no knowledge of this alleged abuse," Andrade said.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Koch, an Oxnard Union High School District trustee, said she
was unaware of accusations against Pridgen before his arrest and that
officials would have taken any complaints very seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "As a member of the school board I can say, unequivocally, that if
there was ever even a hint of anything going on, and it came to the
attention of someone at the school, it would be investigated
immediately," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Gary Davis is on vacation this week and could not be reached
Thursday. The school district's attorney, Jack Parham, also was
unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Andrade said she intends to file a civil claim against Pridgen
within two months seeking damages and alleging sexual abuse, child
abuse and infliction of emotional distress. She also said she may
represent other alleged victims.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the school district is sued over negligence depends on
what the private investigator finds, Andrade said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the school was somehow put on notice that something off-color
was happening and didn't do something to investigate it, I think
that's unconscionable, and we would definitely be filing a lawsuit,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen is accused of having oral sex with or trying to seduce 11
teenage boys, all but two of whom are Camarillo High School students.</TE>
<TE>   A teacher of upper-level chemistry and environmental science
courses, Pridgen also coached boys' soccer and girls' and boys'
tennis.</TE>
<TE>   He has been on unpaid leave since his arrest Feb. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say the alleged sex acts occurred at Pridgen's
Camarillo residence, where students had gathered nearly every weekend
for nearly two years.</TE>
<TE>   Other students, however, say they had been to Pridgen's house for
after-school and weekend get-togethers but that nothing illegal or
inappropriate occurred.</TE>
<TE>   One of those students was Jason Schechter, a former Pridgen
student now studying aerospace engineering at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Schechter, Jason Schechter's father, said he knew his son had
spent time at his teacher's home and was not concerned. He is one of
the parents who maintain Pridgen's innocence.</TE>
<TE>   "I've known him as a teacher and a coach," Schechter said. "He has
been to our house, we talked to him, and we trust him."</TE>
<TE>   But the issue has prompted trustee Koch to consider looking into a
policy that would inform parents and students that unchaperoned
contact with a district employee outside of school is not acceptable,
and that any violation should be reported.</TE>
<TE>   Koch said it is wrong for a teacher to regularly have students in
his or her home and will ask the superintendent to look into the
possibility of implementing such a policy.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make sure we're doing everything we can do to protect
our students," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At the arraignment today, prosecutors plan to ask a judge to at
least double Pridgen's $250,000 bail, according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Pridgen violated a term of his release--that he
have no contact with minors without their parents' direct
supervision--when he got a job at a Sherman Oaks talent-scouting
agency working with children and teens.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen also violated another condition of his release,
prosecutors argue, when he purchased a plane ticket to Washington,
D.C., last month. A court order requires he remain in California
until the case is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen's Los Angeles attorneys have repeatedly declined to
comment on behalf of their client.</TE>

<HD>Randy Castillo, 51; Drummer With Heavy Metal Bands</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Randy Castillo, a popular drummer with leading heavy metal acts, most
notably Ozzy Osbourne and Motley Crue, has died. He was 51.</LD>
<LD>   Castillo died March 26 at his home in Los Angeles after a long
battle with cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Albuquerque, he began playing music at a young age.
Initially he tried the trumpet but lost interest and turned to the
drums.</LD>
<TE>   By the time he was in high school, Castillo was playing in local
bar bands at night and distinguishing himself in school bands as
well. As a senior, he was named to the All-State symphonic band.</TE>
<TE>   After high school, he played in a number of bands that toured the
Southwest, performing in bars and at high school dances.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo emerged as a drummer with the Motels briefly in the early
1980s and then with Lita Ford's band.</TE>
<TE>   He joined Osbourne in 1986, and played with him for long periods
over the next 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo participated in several Osbourne albums, including "The
Ultimate Sin" and "No Rest for the Wicked," and appeared on three
DVDs, including the documentary "Don't Blame Me."</TE>
<TE>   After leaving Osbourne, Castillo toured with Motley Crue,
replacing Tommy Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo toured with the band until he became ill with a stomach
ailment.</TE>
<TE>   Further tests revealed an unrelated cancer.</TE>
<TE>   A report on the band in The Times said Castillo made a positive
addition to the group.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of their renewed strength as a band has to do with the
addition of drummer Castillo," the article said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, he appeared with other bands, including the
Wumblies and the Offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo is survived by his mother and three sisters, all
residents of Albuquerque.</TE>

<HD>Debate Over Redistricting for School Board Goes to Council</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Contentious debate continued Thursday when a map that proposes new
district boundaries for the Los Angeles Board of Education was
presented to the City Council for further review.</LD>
<LD>   Critics contend that the map disenfranchises the San Fernando
Valley and was chosen because it protects selected incumbent board
members.</LD>
<LD>   The council's Ad Hoc Committee on Redistricting must implement new
boundaries by July 1. Boundaries are redrawn every 10 years to
reflect demographic shifts.</LD>
<TE>   A commission in charge of the task spent weeks debating two map
proposals before recommending one two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Known as the Los Angeles Redistricting Commission for the L.A.
Unified School District, the panel voted 9 to 6 for a map that would
place the southwest Valley in a district based on the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   It also would move Board of Education President Caprice Young from
a district based in Hollywood and Koreatown into a West Valley
district that could give her a better chance at reelection because of
its majority of white registered voters.</TE>
<TE>   The opposing map would have kept the southwest Valley in a Valley
district but moved the Cahuenga Pass area to a district that included
the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   Each board member represents 635,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley, with a population of 1.44 million, requires
representation by the equivalent of 2.2 board members, meaning that
one member will represent part of the Valley plus some neighborhoods
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Board member Julie Korenstein, who backed the defeated map, told
the council committee that the favored proposal "will help fuel the
fires of the San Fernando Valley secession movement."</TE>
<TE>   She said the Cahuenga Pass area identifies more with the Westside
than the southwest Valley because of access to freeways. Backers of
the defeated map had said it is quicker to drive from the Westside to
North Hollywood than to Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The committee will meet again Thursday at City Hall.</TE>

L.A.</TE>

<TE>   "The committee's job is to be a referee in an excruciatingly
difficult situation," said Councilman Jack Weiss, who chairs the
council panel. "I think the task of drawing new boundaries for the
LAUSD is even more excruciating than it is for the City Council."</TE>
<TE>   On the commission for the LAUSD, members Diana Dixon-Davis and
Irma Hopkins voted for the defeated map and wrote a minority report
that said the panel acted unfairly and ignored overwhelming public
support for that option.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners Michael Keeley, George Cole and Eric Alderete, who
presented the final report to the council committee Thursday, had a
chance to reflect on the redrawing process.</TE>
<TE>   They said there were not enough public comments at their community
meetings and that most of the testimony was not provided by
individual residents but by organized labor groups such as United
Teachers-Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "The frustrating part was trying to really connect with parents
and community members," Cole said.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss said his impression from the committee's first meeting was
that "LAUSD is extremely out of touch, and something is seriously
wrong with the current system to connect parents to representatives."</TE>
<TE>   The committee will meet again Thursday at City Hall.</TE>

<HD>Renters Serve Notice to Landlords</HD>
<DH>Protest: Advocates and angry tenants who say the system is
rigged against them rally in downtown L.A. to push for new state
laws.</DH>

<LD>Luz Reyes made the journey because her rent is increasing $300, and
there is no way she can pay it.</LD>
<LD>   Esperanza Santiago came because the city is forcing her eviction
from the garage she has lived in for 12 years, and she has nowhere to
go.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick O'Rourke trekked here to tell his story of complaining
about unsafe conditions in his building, then being forced to move.
He had no means of fighting back.</LD>
<TE>   In a rally held Thursday outside the downtown Los Angeles
courthouse where eviction cases are heard every day, scores of
tenants gathered to protest a legal system and public policies that
they say are stacked against them.</TE>
<TE>   The event was also the kickoff of a statewide campaign to win
passage of legislation that would increase protection for tenants.</TE>
<TE>   Tenants say a wave of unfair evictions and other abuses have gone
unchecked in the region's tight housing market, filling them with
intimidation and fear.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is nervous," Reyes said, clutching her daughter with
one hand and a rent-increase notice in the other. "We are low-income
people. We don't have the money to pay the rent. We don't know where
we're going to live."</TE>
<TE>   For advocates and tenants who complain of being voiceless, the
campaign is the start of what they hope will grow into a stronger
lobby for tenants' rights.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for us to come together and make this legislation
stick," Abdullah Muhammad, a member of the Assn. of Community
Organizations for Reform Now, told the crowd of protesters.</TE>
<TE>   In most cities, tenants are given a 30-day notice when a landlord
plans to sell the property, upgrade or move in--which are known as
no-fault evictions. But advocates argue that 30 days is not enough
time to find housing, particularly with low vacancy rates.</TE>
<TE>   Under a pilot program in Los Angeles, Santa Monica and West
Hollywood, landlords are now required to give 60-day notice in
no-fault evictions.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Bill 1403, proposed by state Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa
Monica), would give communities the option of joining the pilot
program, requiring the 60-day notice when the rental vacancy rate is
less than 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Kuehl also proposed the legislation that created the program.</TE>
<TE>   "The 30-day notice had caused an enormous amount of dislocation,
anxiety and pain," Kuehl said. "To double the time doesn't alleviate
the pain, but it's an improvement over the previous law."</TE>
<TE>   Another tenants rights bill would strengthen the law against
retaliatory evictions. The proposal by Assemblywoman Carole Migden
(D-San Francisco), AB 2330, would prohibit landlords from evicting
tenants who participate in a tenants association or who exert other
rights under existing laws.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation would also allow tenants who are charged two
months' rent as a security deposit to pay in installments.
Additionally, tenants who have lost their jobs would be able to use
part of their security deposit as an emergency rent payment. The
tenant would then pay the deposit back in installments.</TE>
<TE>   The bills are opposed by the Apartment Owners Assn. of Greater Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "The job of the apartment owner is to provide a commodity, which
is housing--we're not a credit union," said Charles Isham, executive
vice president of the group.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's rally drew tenants from throughout the city facing a
range of problems.</TE>
<TE>   Yong Pak said she wanted to do something to "help with all the
evictions of poor people." She added: "We're trying to come together
for them."</TE>
<TE>   Gustavo Hernandez, a tenant who said he beat an unfair eviction in
court, sounded a note of victory amid the chorus of sad stories.</TE>
<TE>   "There are laws, but if we don't raise up in protest, [landlords
are] not going to follow them," Hernandez said.</TE>

<HD>3 Rescuers of Woman Trapped Under Car to Be Honored</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lester Morales ignored the hot metal of the car's chassis cutting
into his hands as he strained to help the screaming young woman.</LD>
<LD>   She was trapped. A two-car accident had wiped out her bus stop and
left her pinned on the sidewalk by one of the vehicles. The motor
hummed as the front end of the 2,700-pound car pressed down on her.
The driver, still inside, also cried for help, complaining that she
was pregnant and that her back hurt.</LD>
<LD>   Morales' colleague, Enrique Hurtado, tried desperately to find a
way to lift the car. The two gang intervention workers, assisted by
others in the growing crowd, managed to get the trapped woman away
from the wreckage after a few frantic minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Although she had serious injuries, including a broken pelvis, Dawn
Gant survived.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how long I was going to be under the car if they
didn't help me," the 26-year-old vocational/technical school student
said recently from her Los Angeles home, where she is recuperating.
Gant, who attends East Los Angeles Skills Center, hopes to continue
studying construction after she recovers.</TE>
<TE>   City officials who plan to honor the men during the City Council
meeting today say that Morales and Hurtado, along with another gang
intervention worker, Danny Diaz, may have saved Gant's life. If she
had not been freed from under the car before emergency workers
arrived, the officials say, she could have suffered more severe
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "She could have been burned really badly if she stayed there much
longer," said Los Angeles Police Officer Thomas Fox, who responded to
the accident at Soto and Multnomah streets on Feb. 15. "Or she could
have suffocated there."</TE>
<TE>   Morales, Hurtado and Diaz say that they are proud of what they did
but that they feel somewhat uncomfortable when people refer to them
as heroes. Their jobs involve trying to help save people, albeit from
the dangers of gangs. Each of them says that all he wanted to do was
everything possible to help Gant--a stranger--make it out of the
accident alive.</TE>
<TE>   They describe their actions that day as a combination of
adrenaline and reflexes generated by a scary experience.</TE>
<TE>   Around 2 p.m., Morales, Hurtado and Diaz, who work for Public
Health Foundation, a nonprofit group that operates a city-sponsored
gang intervention program, were in Hurtado's truck headed back to
their office in Boyle Heights after a meeting in El Sereno. Morales
was sitting in the front passenger seat and Diaz was in the back as
they traveled south on Soto Street.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, they saw a blue Ford Mustang crash into the back of a
gold Honda Accord. After the impact, the Mustang continued south on
Soto, while the Honda was forced off the road.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the car was out of control and it went onto the sidewalk,"
Hurtado recalled. "The lady saw it coming at her but she couldn't get
away from it."</TE>
<TE>   Hurtado stopped at a red light, put his truck in park, and dashed
down the street to where Gant lay pinned to the pavement. Morales ran
to the scene too. Meanwhile, Diaz jumped into the driver's seat,
followed the Mustang for several blocks, and called 911, before the
motorist decided to return to the scene.</TE>
<TE>   At Soto and Multnomah, Morales and Hurtado were trying to lift the
car off Gant. Morales, a powerfully built 23-year-old, tried to
reassure Gant that she would be OK.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked her what her name was, but she was just screaming and
crying," said Morales, who was at the front end of the car. "She kept
telling us to help her."</TE>
<TE>   The car was heavy, he remembered. They would not be able to hold
it up much longer.</TE>
<TE>   Hurtado, 32 and husky, yelled at the bystanders to help. Several
other men helped lift the car a bit higher. A few others pulled Gant
from underneath the car.</TE>
<TE>   When they let the Accord drop to the pavement, it scraped
Hurtado's left thigh, leaving a nasty bruise. Morales looked down at
his hands and saw blood trickling from the lacerations.</TE>
<TE>   A bit later an emergency response team and Los Angeles police
officers arrived at the scene. No citations were issued and the
pregnant driver did not suffer any serious injuries, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Hurtado, director of the Aztec Fire Fuels Crew operated by the
foundation, submitted an incident report to city officials when he
returned to his office.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Nick Pacheco, whose district includes Boyle Heights,
drafted a motion for the council to honor the men at today's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Morales said it took a while for him to digest the afternoon's
events.</TE>
<TE>   Later that day, while sitting in a waiting room at the medical
center, where he would receive 13 stitches on his hands, he thought
about what he and the others had done. "It hit me. We saved this
lady's life."</TE>

<HD>High School May Limit Dances Due to Drinking</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Drunk students at Eureka High School dances have forced Principal Bob
Embertson to take a drastic step--limiting the number of such events
next year.</LD>
<LD>   Embertson recently wrote to parents, urging them to talk with
their children about the increasing alcohol problem at school.</LD>
<LD>   The drinking probably will mean only the junior and senior proms
will be held next year, rather than the five or six dances of
previous years, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "You see everything," Embertson said. "The funny drunk, the morose
drunk, the sick drunk and the ugly drunk."</TE>
<TE>   At the March 8 Sadie Hawkins dance, about a third of students
given a breathalyzer test were found to have been drinking, he said,
and almost all were over the 0.08% blood-alcohol level, the
California legal limit for driving.</TE>
<TE>   Embertson said alcohol has always been a problem, but it has
gotten much worse this past year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A man accused of kidnapping and killing 7-year-old Danielle van Dam
repeatedly asked for an attorney during a nine-hour police interview,
but his request was never granted, his lawyer said.</LD>
<LD>   In the days after Danielle's disappearance, police grilled David
Westerfield about the missing girl to the point that he started to
unravel, Westerfield's attorney, Robert Boyce, said in court
documents filed in Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   Westerfield, 50, is accused of kidnapping and murdering the girl,
who vanished from her home Feb.1.</LD>
<TE>   Her body was found three weeks later along a rural road east of
San Diego. Westerfield has pleaded innocent and will stand trial May
17.</TE>

<HD>Voters to Decide on Tax to Help Hospital</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Voters in this North Coast town will be asked to decide in June if
they are willing to pay $75 more a year in taxes to save their
hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Recent estimates show Jerold Phelps Community Hospital is running
a $32,000 monthly deficit.</LD>
<LD>   The hospital is operated by the Southern Humboldt Community
Healthcare District.</LD>
<TE>   Officials blame the financial shortfall on high service costs and
low federal Medicare and state Medi-Cal reimbursements.</TE>
<TE>   The special mail-in election June 25 asks voters to approve a
boost in parcel taxes supporting the hospital from $25 annually to
$100.</TE>
<TE>   Two-thirds of the district's voters must approve the tax hike.
Supporters say that if the measure fails, the hospital probably will
close, forcing patients who need emergency services to drive 40
minutes to Fortuna.</TE>

<LD>More than 50 reported cases of salmonella poisoning since January
have prompted state health officials to warn consumers to avoid an
illegally produced cheese popular among Latinos.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the cases linked to the soft white cheese--queso fresco--
occurred in San Mateo, Santa Clara and Alameda counties.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 36 people studied so far, 14 were hospitalized, including
seven children, said epidemiologist Dr. Michele Cheung.</LD>
<TE>   Officials have been unable to identify the maker or distributor of
the cheese, which is available at grocery stores, but also can be
purchased from street vendors and homemakers in the Bay Area.</TE>

<LD>A Ventura police officer shot and killed a knife-wielding car theft
suspect Thursday night after a struggle while trying to arrest him,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect, who was not identified pending notification of his
family, was shot shortly before 7 p.m. at the Topper Motel &amp; Liquor
Store in the 1600 block of Thompson Boulevard, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "During the arrest, the suspect brandished a knife," Sgt. Brock
Avery said. "The officer felt his life was in jeopardy."</LD>
<TE>   The suspect, who was in his 20s or 30s, was wanted on suspicion of
stealing a sport utility vehicle and possessing stolen mail and
personal checks. He was taken to Ventura County Medical Center and
pronounced dead upon arrival. Avery said two uniformed police
officers, whom he declined to identify, had a warrant to arrest the
man and received a tip that he was at the motel. When they arrived
about 6:45 p.m., the officers spotted the suspect inside a stolen
Ford Bronco.</TE>
<TE>   "The detectives approached him and then a struggle ensued" outside
the vehicle, Avery said.</TE>
<TE>   Only one of the officers fired his service weapon, Avery said. He
was placed on paid leave, which is standard procedure.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first officer-involved shooting in Ventura since May
13, 2001, when an officer shot a suspect armed with an assault rifle.</TE>

<HD>Bus Station Sculpture a Traffic Stopper</HD>
<DH>Art: The $2.2-million 'transfer center' is set to open June
12. Reaction to the unorthodox design is muted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's nothing that Ralph Kramden would have recognized as a bus
station.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, nobody has ever seen a bus station quite like
the structure going up on the north side of Pacific View Mall.</LD>
<LD>   After four years of planning and occasionally vigorous opposition,
Ventura will open a 36-foot-tall, multicolored sculpture featuring
timetables, benches, restrooms, loading bays and drinking fountains.
Passengers waiting at the site off Telegraph Avenue will cluster
inside what bureaucrats call a "bus transfer center." Artist Dennis
Oppenheim calls it a work of "whirling metamorphoses" and has titled
it "Bus Home."</LD>
<TE>   Construction started last week on the piece that depicts a bus
swooping over an arch and transforming itself into a suburban house.
The grand opening of the $2.2-million project is June 12.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one answer to the question of how we can approach
Ventura's identity," said Kerry Adams Hapner, an official with the
city's public art program. "It enhances the quality of life for
people here. It will attract attention to the mall and help to bring
in new businesses. Overall, it raises the bar in terms of urban
design."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is cheered by the sight of the steel skeleton rising
in the mall's parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "I drove by it today and wanted to get out my dynamite," said
Christy Weir of Ventura. "It's one more sign of the city's
inferiority complex; we have to do something completely weird and off
the wall in order to be different."</TE>
<TE>   About half the project is being financed by federal transit funds.
The city's share is about $848,000, much of which can be used only
for transportation projects. More than $163,000 comes from public art
fees levied on builders of private and public projects.</TE>
<TE>   Before its approval by Ventura's City Council in 2000, the design
was criticized by residents who said it was ugly. The city also was
accused of needlessly recruiting design talent from New York when a
local artist could have done the job.</TE>
<TE>   Oppenheim, 63, has exhibited in galleries and museums throughout
the world and received commissions for public art in places such as
South Korea and Argentina. He was among about 50 artists who applied
for the bus job, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   After he was selected, Oppenheim came to Ventura and spent a few
hours sitting on a bench at the current transfer center, a drab
arrangement that isn't much more than a cement slab and a few
benches.</TE>
<TE>   "Bus stops can be depressing places, especially when the
overwhelming majority of the population have cars," he said. "You
sit, you wait, you're tired. And whatever makes you depend on a bus
is just another reason for you to be a little bit sad."</TE>
<TE>   Oppenheim said he intended his design to be both zany and
uplifting.</TE>
<TE>   "It aggrandizes the simple act of waiting for a bus to nearly the
level of hallucination," he said. "I've never seen anything quite
like it."</TE>
<TE>   Oppenheim has worked in a variety of styles, sometimes
incorporating items as unlikely as mechanized marionettes, conveyor
belts and batches of cotton candy. His work has occasionally verged
into bizarre metaphors, with such images as Raggedy Ann and Andy
dolls having sex.</TE>
<TE>   He is working on a commission at the Sacramento airport involving
giant metallic birds cantilevering off a parking garage and hovering
over a garden. The birds, which have a wing span of 20 feet, will
incorporate actual birdhouses.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be open for birds to go inside and do whatever birds do,"
he said. "It's a little bit radical."</TE>

<HD>Homicide-Free in Huntington Beach</HD>
<DH>Crime: No one's been killed in Surf City in 21/2 years, a
trend not matched since the '60s. Emergency-room staff, paramedics,
police share credit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>November 27, 1999, is a day the detectives in Huntington Beach's
homicide bureau consider a milestone. The beaten body of 29-year-old
Bridgette Ballas, an account executive for Calvin Klein, was
discovered by a passerby in a gutter on Huntington Street that day.</LD>
<LD>   And the community hasn't recorded another slaying since.</LD>
<LD>   The streak of peacefulness has met with a mixture of pride and
puzzlement in the city of nearly 200,000 people. Huntington Beach
hasn't had so few homicides since the 1960s--and no one is sure how
long the streak will last.</LD>
<TE>   The lull is all the more remarkable considering the city was
averaging five to six homicides a year through most of the 1980s and
1990s--many of them gang-related.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians place the credit with cops, saying the department's
community policing and anti-gang efforts have helped drive down not
just homicides but many other crimes as well.</TE>
<TE>   Police officers, meanwhile, praise paramedics and emergency-room
doctors for saving victims of violent crime.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not for a lack of people trying to kill each other," said
Det. Steve Mack. "We've certainly had some attempted murders; people
stabbed in the heart, shot in the head, shot in the face with a
shotgun."Since the Ballas murder in 1999, detectives have arrived at
several crime scenes they were sure would become murder
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 23, 2001, Steve Wagner was shot three times in the head
with a .25-caliber pistol; his girlfriend Frankie Flex was strangled
and left for dead.</TE>
<TE>   On April 13, 2001, Lydia Matthews was stabbed by her husband 17
times.</TE>
<TE>   On July 13, 2001, Patrick Tasselli was stabbed in the leg and an
artery was severed.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 19, 2002, Benito Rosas was shot point-blank in the face
with a shotgun.</TE>
<TE>   All of those victims were taken to UCI Medical Center's Level One
trauma center in Orange--and survived.</TE>
<TE>   "They work some miracles," said veteran police Lt. Chuck Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors at the emergency room have a more scientific
explanation."There are injuries that are going to be fatal," said Dr.
Marianne Cinat, a trauma surgeon at UCI. "But what we have in place
is a system that allows us to immediately treat life-threatening
injuries so that we give a patient their best possible chance at
survival."</TE>
<TE>   The trauma center can mobilize a team that includes surgeons,
nurses and others within minutes of getting a call from paramedics
about a critically injured patient.</TE>
<TE>   The team can stabilize the patient and quickly get him or her into
an operating room. Paramedics also play a crucial role by quickly
assessing the condition of victims and communicating with trauma
doctors on what treatment will be needed when they get to the
hospital, Cinat said.</TE>
<TE>   "Where the bullet goes we have no control over," she said. "Once
they get to the hospital, even then, we can't save them sometimes,
but the decisions we make aren't just pure luck.</TE>
<TE>   The decisions and the sequence of events are based on years of
experience and training."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lack of slayings, the homicide bureau remains active.
The detectives handle a variety of cases, including kidnappings,
robberies and assaults. Last week, they investigated the kidnapping
of a Huntington Beach man who was found in a Long Beach motel.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trial Is Pending in 1999 Murder Case</TE>
<TE>   They also made an arrest in their most recent slaying, the 1999
case of Bridgette Ballas. It came six months after her murder. The
detectives allege that Ballas was raped and murdered by a neighbor as
she was returning home from a night out with friends. A trial is
pending. Detectives also are reexamining 20 unsolved homicides.</TE>
<TE>   One high-profile shooting in the city last year was investigated
by the Orange County district attorney's office. The case involved a
fatally injured 18-year-old who was fired at by police who later said
he was holding a toy gun. Prosecutors determined the shooting was
justified. Homicide detectives David Dirkin and Mack said they are in
no hurry to take on another murder case.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't go into homicide to work the homicides," Mack said. "I
went into it to arrest the people who commit them."</TE>

<HD>Natural Gas Facility Pitched</HD>
<DH>Energy: Company proposes to build a terminal near Oxnard's
Ormond Beach, with an offshore docking station.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARRI KARUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles-based energy company is proposing to build a
$250-million liquefied natural gas terminal next to an Ormond Beach
power plant in Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   Oxy Energy Services, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp.,
is seeking to purchase 261 acres near the Port of Hueneme to build a
receiving terminal. A pier or underwater pipeline would connect the
terminal with a docking station about 4,000 feet offshore.</LD>
<LD>   The facility would be the first of its kind on the West Coast and,
according to the company, help California import more natural gas to
fuel its power plants. An Oxy spokeswoman emphasized that the project
is in preliminary stages.</LD>
<TE>   But Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez predicted vehement opposition
because of safety concerns and the potential for spills or other
environmental accidents. He noted that a similar project proposed
near Santa Barbara 25 years ago failed when residents there objected
over similar fears.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be up to [Oxy Energy] to prove the concerns of the
residents--and probably the people of California--wrong," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Sharkey, mayor pro tem in neighboring Port Hueneme,
agreed. He also expressed concern about increased air pollution from
incoming tanker ships.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people who are very emotionally attached to
the Ormond Beach area and have worked many years trying to preserve
it," Sharkey said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Company Defends Industry's Record</TE>
<TE>   Oxy Energy spokeswoman Jan Sieving said the public is generally
misinformed about liquefied natural gas. She said there is no
potential for spills because the fuel dissipates when it hits the
air, and that the industry has had an excellent safety record
internationally for the last 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Sieving said similar facilities have been constructed and operated
safely around the world, including terminals in Massachusetts,
Maryland, Georgia and Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   "Natural gas is environmentally friendly," Sieving said. "That's
what all these power plants being built are going to be fueled by. If
they can take out some of the oil-fueled plants, then it's better for
the environment."</TE>
<TE>   Sieving noted that 37% of California's electricity is generated by
power plants fueled by natural gas, and that the 11 plants under
construction across the state will also be fueled by natural gas.</TE>
<TE>   California imports about 84% of its natural gas supply from other
Western states and Canada, according to Occidental.</TE>
<TE>   Sieving said the Oxnard facility would employ about 30 workers,
generate at least $2 million in annual tax revenue and allow
California to import natural gas from several countries along the
Pacific Rim, creating competition and helping to keep energy costs
down.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ships Would Deliver Offshore</TE>
<TE>   The project calls for an onshore receiving terminal that would be
built on about 95 acres next to Reliant Energy's Ormond Beach plant.
Oxy does not have a contract with Reliant. Sieving said the company
does not plan to develop the remaining 166 acres. The entire site is
owned by Southern California Edison.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a docking station would be built offshore. A
pipeline--constructed either underwater or along a pier--would
connect it to the terminal. The liquid natural gas would be pumped
from the tanker ships at the docking station and piped to the
receiving station, where it would be converted back to its gaseous
state.</TE>
<TE>   There would be about one ship delivery per week, with the ship
docking offshore for about 14 hours, Sieving said.</TE>
<TE>   The project would need to be approved by various governing
agencies, including the city of Oxnard, the California Coastal
Commission and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</TE>

<HD>Out of the Ivory Tower, Into the Legal Trenches</HD>
<DH>Law professors' high-profile cases bring fame and riches,
but can also rile alumni and lead to conflict charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From advising O.J. Simpson to defending medical marijuana, law
professors are increasingly visible in the courtroom.</LD>
<LD>   Legal scholars have consulted on the side for decades, but their
work in court has appeared to jump in recent years because of the
highly publicized and often controversial cases many now take.
Motivations range from money and fame to altruism and intellectual
challenge.</LD>
<LD>   "It's becoming more transparent," said Harvard Law professor
Laurence Tribe, who has argued 30 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court
since 1980. In decades past, little of the outside work by law
professors generated publicity. "It was consulting on the q.t. more
or less," Tribe said.</LD>
<TE>   Law schools generally permit faculty to spend 20% of their time on
outside work, and about 50% of law professors take private cases,
sometimes without pay, sometimes as expert witnesses for large fees.</TE>
<TE>   Private legal work can fatten a professor's pocketbook, enhance
the reputation of the law school and draw more students to his or her
classes.</TE>
<TE>   Some law professors become famous. Millions of people saw
Harvard's Alan M. Dershowitz portrayed in "Reversal of Fortune," a
movie based on the law professor's book about his defense of
socialite Claus von Bulow.</TE>
<TE>   But stepping outside the ivory tower for litigation also can lead
to charges of conflict of interest, alumni anger and claims that
students are being short-changed.</TE>
<TE>   Tribe is among the best-paid of law school legal advocates. A
constitutional law expert, Tribe says he does much of his outside
work for free, but "my standard rate is well above $500 an hour."
Among current paying clients is Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., which
hired him to help in its bankruptcy petition.</TE>
<TE>   Taking on a private client can require soul-searching, he said.
"There can be a conflict between one's intellectual integrity on the
one hand and the position one finds oneself taking in a brief."</TE>
<TE>   Some law professors say they will argue whatever it takes in the
heat of a court battle, regardless of whether it conflicts with views
they have espoused in scholarly journals, Tribe said.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it easier to look at myself in the mirror and not feel
ashamed when I just decline to take cases that put me in a position
where I have to argue something I really don't believe," Tribe said,
adding that, of course, "it is always possible to fool oneself."</TE>
<TE>   Scholars also risk the appearance of conflict when they litigate
before courts that they regularly comment upon for the media or legal
publications.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clara University law professor Gerald Uelmen is a leading
expert on the California Supreme Court and on occasion argues cases
before it.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly don't feel awkward," said Uelmen, who also worked as
a criminal defense attorney for Simpson. "I certainly wouldn't
comment on cases I have been directly involved in or at least without
disclosing that involvement."</TE>
<TE>   Uelmen said he tries assiduously to be objective in his commentary
on jurists. Likewise, Tribe said he writes critical articles on U.S.
Supreme Court opinions without being concerned that they might cost
him a vote or two when he argues before the panel.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's hurt my batting average," said Tribe, who has
won about two-thirds of the cases he has argued before the court.</TE>
<TE>   Few professors take on trials because that would remove them from
the classroom. Those who do often take leaves or sabbaticals.</TE>
<TE>   To win tenure, professors must publish scholarly work on top of
teaching and handling private clients. Uelmen said professors can
often "double dip" by using research that went into a brief on a case
for an article in a law journal.</TE>
<TE>   Students sometimes work with professors on outside legal cases.
Uelmen said his dean allowed him to teach a seminar on a case in
which he defended a voter initiative that allowed for the use of
marijuana for medical reasons. He said he received some financial
support from medical marijuana groups, mostly for expenses. The case
went to the U.S. Supreme Court last year and is now back before a
federal district judge in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "I had 12 students working with me, researching and writing the
brief," Uelmen said. "When we argued the case, the law school helped
fly them to Washington, so they had front-row seats."</TE>
<TE>   Students can work without pay on cases that professors take
without charge, but professors generally reimburse those who do
research for paying clients.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to make sure that the purpose is to advance the
student's education and not to advance the professor's wallet," said
Jonathan Varat, dean of the UCLA School of Law.</TE>
<TE>   Private legal work, if controversial, can spur angry reactions
from alumni and donors. University of Southern California professor
Erwin Chemerinsky, who has helped litigate a civil rights case on
behalf of terrorist suspects detained at the U.S. naval base in
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, said he and his dean received hate mail as a
result of his private work. The school has been strongly supportive
and has never interfered, Chemerinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Chemerinsky is appointed to cases by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals and has argued and won cases before the appellate court. He
said he receives no pay for his case work but uses it as a teaching
tool.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, I am training lawyers, so I think having practical
experience makes me better as a teacher," Chemerinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Uelmen said the top professors tend to be those who remain at
least somewhat involved with the courts and litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "They have much more credibility with the students," he said.
"They are much more up-to-date as to the issues of consequence being
litigated out there."</TE>
<TE>   Most law schools have policies that professors must follow if they
engage in private litigation. At the University of California, the
administration is "ambivalent" about outside work, said UC Berkeley
Law professor Stephen Barnett.</TE>
<TE>   "On the one hand, professional school faculty members are
encouraged to practice their profession," Barnett said. "On the other
hand, they are encouraged to limit the time they spend doing that."</TE>
<TE>   Law professors at the University of California earn from $114,000
a year to as much as $196,500 a year. Elsewhere, salaries range from
$80,000 a year to more than $200,000, amounts that usually exceed the
pay of faculty in other departments.</TE>
<TE>   The disparity between what lawyers can earn teaching and
practicing has grown substantially in recent years and may have
spurred some professors to take on private cases, said Cardozo School
of Law professor Barry Scheck. First-year law graduates often make
more than the professors who taught them, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Scheck has taken on legal cases for pay, including the Simpson
trial, in addition to his work for Cardozo and its Innocence Project,
which he and Peter Neufeld founded in 1992. The project has used DNA
evidence to win the release of 104 prisoners nationwide who were
wrongfully convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Scheck used his DNA expertise in representing Simpson, who was
acquitted of killing his former wife and her friend.</TE>
<TE>   Although critics say Scheck was hypocritical in attacking
prosecution DNA evidence in the Simpson case, Scheck said his work in
the trial led to substantial improvements in the training of law
enforcement and laboratory technicians who handle DNA evidence.</TE>
<TE>   While the Simpson verdict was controversial, Scheck said he
believes the trial enhanced rather than hurt his reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "It gave me a different level of notoriety, and so it was easy for
me to convert that into effective influence for what I always knew
was a much more important goal," the freeing of the innocent from
prison.</TE>

<HD>Court Allows Suit to Proceed in Fatal Shooting by Police</HD>
<DH>Litigation: The appeals panel cites inconsistencies in
accounts of the 1999 Claremont incident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIPTON BLISH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An appeals court has cleared the way for a civil suit to proceed
against two Claremont police officers who killed an 18-year-old man
three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Tracy Lee sued the city and the officers who shot her son, Irvin
Landrum Jr., during a traffic stop. The mother of one of Landrum's
two daughters joined in the wrongful-death suit.</LD>
<LD>   In a ruling made public Thursday, a three-judge panel of the U.S.
9th Circuit Court of Appeals found enough inconsistencies in the case
to send it to trial.</LD>
<TE>   "The day of reckoning is upon us," said J. Anthony Willoughby,
Lee's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Landrum's shooting has generated controversy in the city for
years. Some of those who had protested celebrated Thursday's news.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the one we have been waiting for," said Halford
Fairchild, who led protests for years in front of City Hall and
helped organize the Irvin Landrum Jr. Justice Organizing Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney for the two officers said he would recommend that
they appeal the decision and take the matter to the full 9th Circuit
panel.</TE>
<TE>   Landrum was shot early on the morning of Jan. 11, 1999, after
Officers Hany Hanna and Kent Jacks pulled him over for allegedly
speeding.</TE>
<TE>   During the stop, officers said, Landrum pulled a gun. They shot
him three times, and he died six days later.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shooting Ignites Charges of Bias</TE>
<TE>   His death, subsequent inconsistencies in the officers' stories and
the discovery that a gun found next to Landrum had once belonged to a
retired Ontario police chief fueled furious protests. That Landrum
was African American heightened tension in the city and led to
charges that its police officers are biased.</TE>
<TE>   Hanna said that Landrum had fired at him and that he had seen a
muzzle flash. But forensic reports found that the gun had not been
fired.</TE>
<TE>   The officers argued, through their attorney, that under the stress
of the moment Hanna misconstrued what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "In his mind, under the stresses of the incident, he saw a muzzle
flash," said Eugene Ramirez, an attorney representing the city and
the officers. "We believe it was a justifiable shooting."</TE>
<TE>   That inconsistency and others, the judges said, "could lead a
reasonable fact finder to question the officers' accounts of the
incident."</TE>
<TE>   They also cited the fact that Landrum had gunpowder on his hands,
although the gun hadn't been fired and had no fingerprints on it.</TE>
<TE>   There also are discrepancies between the accounts given by the
officers. Hanna, for example, said Jacks called out a warning that
Landrum had a gun. Jacks' account did not include that warning.</TE>
<TE>   Protesters have said the officers tried to cover up the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "The officers lied," Fairchild said. "Not only did they lie
initially, but they lied in their request for summary judgment. We
know they lied about the muzzle flash. We know they lied about the
gunshot."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Paul Held said the city has left the matter with the
attorneys and the city's insurance agency, which is responsible for
the case.</TE>
<TE>   Any decision to try to settle the case before it goes to trial is
not the city's to make, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The city's position is that we have now received several reports
from independent investigators, and there is not a basis for finding
that the officers acted inappropriately despite the fact that the
outcome was so tragic," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The officers were cleared of wrongdoing by a Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department investigation and by the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, who marked what would have been her son's 22nd birthday last
week, said, "I am looking forward to moving on and having some
closure. But it has been three years now, and I don't hurt any less
than I did on that day."</TE>

<HD>Drug Smugglers' Tunnel Filled With Concrete</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TIERRA DEL SOL, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Workers began destroying a tunnel beneath the U.S.-Mexico border that
authorities believe was used to smuggle tons of marijuana and cocaine
into California during the past two to three years.</LD>
<LD>   A construction crew on Thursday began pouring concrete into the
portion of the 1,000-foot tunnel on U.S. soil.</LD>
<LD>   An anonymous tip led authorities to the tunnel, which runs from
the eastern outskirts of Tecate, Mexico, to a private home in Tierra
del Sol, a rural community 60 miles east of San Diego. U.S. officials
found 500 pounds of marijuana near the entrance of the tunnel when
agents entered it through the empty home Feb. 27.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration originally planned to
destroy the tunnel with explosives. Officials changed their minds out
of environmental concerns and the U.S. landowner's fear that it would
reduce the value of his property.</TE>
<TE>   The owner said he was not aware of the tunnel and was not charged
in the case.</TE>

<HD>Minority Levels Rebound at UC</HD>
<DH>Education: The percentage admitted tops 19%, higher than in
1997 when affirmative action was in place.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The University of California announced Thursday that it has admitted
a greater proportion of underrepresented minority students for the
fall freshman class than it did in 1997, the last year before it
instituted a ban on affirmative action in admissions.</LD>
<LD>   The proportion of Latino, African American and Native American
students admitted topped 19%, compared to 18.8% five years ago, the
last time race and ethnicity could be considered as a factor.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout the UC system, the number of Latino students offered
admission set a record for second straight year. The number of
admitted African American students also rose, although not to record
levels, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   UC officials expressed satisfaction with the rebounding minority
figures, which they said reflected not only the shifting demographics
of the state, but concerted efforts by the university to reach out to
underrepresented students.</TE>
<TE>   ''We've been seeing steady progress in this regard,'' said Dennis
Galligani, UC's associate vice president for student academic
services. ''And this year we were able to reach 19.1%, so that's very
good news.''</TE>
<TE>   The percentages of Latinos and African Americans also rose at
UCLA--the UC system's most popular campus--but remained virtually
unchanged from last year at the university's flagship campus, UC
Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Across its eight undergraduate campuses, the UC admitted 48,369
California high school seniors for its fall class, a 4.9% increase
from last year, according to the figures released Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The figures do not include out-of-state or international
admissions, which make up a relatively small proportion of the
student population at the state's leading public university system.</TE>
<TE>   Among the patterns: Young women make up an increasing proportion
of the admitted freshman class--about 57%.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, a new admissions policy that allows consideration of
personal factors as well as grades and test scores appears to have
had only modest impact on the ethnic makeup of the new freshman
class, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The increases among underrepresented minorities were most dramatic
at UC San Diego, where the proportion of Latino, African American and
Native American students in the incoming class rose nearly 3% from
last year. Still, they totaled only 14.4% of the roughly 16,000
students offered admission--the second-lowest in the UC system, just
above UC Davis at 14.3%.</TE>
<TE>   UC San Diego admissions director Mae Brown said officials were
''delighted to see the changes.''</TE>
<TE>   UC officials said they have worked hard to boost the number of
black, Latino and Native American students, which dropped
precipitously after the university banned affirmative action. UC
regents voted last year to rescind the ban but by that time their
move was mainly symbolic. A statewide initiative, Proposition 209,
prohibiting the use of race, ethnicity and gender as criteria for
hiring or admission by any state body had been passed.</TE>
<TE>   The university system has come under considerable pressure from
the Legislature to show more progress in broadening the racial
diversity of its student body, especially at its most competitive
campuses.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who has often been critical
of the university's efforts, applauded the progress but said more
remains to be done.</TE>
<TE>   ''We've had five years to try to let underrepresented minority
students know that the unwelcome mat was no longer out at the UC,''
Bustamante said. ''The Legislature has intervened again and again to
make sure the UC reaches out to these groups. I'm glad to see that
we've made progress, but we still have a long way to go.''</TE>
<TE>   The competition for slots at the system's most selective campuses
remained extraordinarily tough.</TE>
<TE>   At UCLA, letters of admission were sent to about 9,350 students,
or 21%, of the record 43,369 who applied--a figure that again made
UCLA the most popular campus not only in the UC system but
nationwide, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Of those admitted to UCLA's fall class, 3.3% were African
American, up slightly from 2.9% last year. Latinos also posted gains,
making up 13.3% of the admitted class compared to 12.1% last year.
Asian Americans again will represent the largest share of UCLA's
incoming freshman class, about 42%, up slightly from last year.</TE>
<TE>   ''The admission of freshmen this year reflects the fact that we
continue to attract a very diverse population of students,''
admissions director Vu Tran said.</TE>
<TE>   At Berkeley, about one in four applicants was admitted, with the
campus extending offers to 7,393 students, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But the proportion of underrepresented minorities admitted to the
flagship campus grew only 0.4%, the statistics showed, and the
proportion of African American students remained virtually unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   With the letters sent out, UC now begins the next phase of the
admissions cycle as it tries to persuade those admitted to enroll.
The best students often have offers from multiple UC campuses and
private universities. They have until May 1 to decide.</TE>

<HD>Tony Young, 64; Career TV, Film Character Actor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Young, who starred in the short-lived CBS television series
"Gunslinger" in 1961 before fashioning a prolific career as a
character actor in television and films, has died. He was 64.</LD>
<LD>   Young died Feb. 26 of lung cancer at his home in West Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   He was born in New York, the son of Carleton G. Young, the voice
of the original "Ellery Queen" on radio. Tony Young made his way west
in the 1950s and graduated from Los Angeles City College. He also
served in the U.S. Air Force.</LD>
<TE>   He appeared in a number of western TV series from Warner Bros. in
the late 1950s, including "Bronco," "Laramie" and "Cheyenne," before
getting his starring shot in "Gunslinger" in 1961. The hourlong
series featured Young as an undercover agent for the U.S. cavalry who
was posing as a gunfighter.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Young made frequent appearances on shows such as
"Mannix," "Mission: Impossible" and "It Takes a Thief." He also
appeared in films, including "Charro!" "Play It as It Lays" and "The
Outfit."</TE>
<TE>   Young is survived by longtime companion Kathy Balaban; a daughter,
Julie Young; a sister, Penny Young-Gossner; and a brother, Stephen
Young.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is scheduled for Saturday at All Saints
Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills.</TE>

<DH>Hockey: Kings shut out Red Wings, 3-0, picking up
much-needed victory in tight playoff race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With playoff tickets going on sale Saturday, the Kings on Thursday
night set about trying to make sure that they're worth something.</LD>
<LD>   Their 3-0 victory over the motivationally challenged Detroit Red
Wings, featuring goals by Aaron Miller, Jason Allison and Kelly
Buchberger and 31 saves by goaltender Felix Potvin, ended their
five-game winless streak and, more important, greatly improved their
chances of making the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   "We needed these two points badly, a lot more than they did," said
Potvin, whose shutout was his fifth of the season, "and we battled
for them."</LD>
<TE>   In front of 18,621 at Staples Center, the largest home crowd in
franchise history, the Kings moved into a tie with Phoenix for the
fifth spot in the Western Conference, five points ahead of the idle
Vancouver Canucks and Dallas Stars.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings and Canucks have five games to play, the Stars six.</TE>
<TE>   In winning for the first time since March 23, when a 3-0 victory
over the San Jose Sharks moved them a season-high 14 games above
.500, the Kings extended their home unbeaten streak to eight games.
The Kings are 6-0-2 at Staples Center since March 2, when the
Columbus Blue Jackets beat them, 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   And they seemed to have solved their penalty-killing problems with
the simplest solution possible: Don't take penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "You're darn right," said assistant coach Mark Hardy, who oversees
the penalty-killing unit, which had given up 10 power-play goals in
five games.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings had only two power-play opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good step," King forward Ian Laperriere said. "We beat a
pretty good team out there. We got back to basics and just worked
hard.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we've turned it around."</TE>
<TE>   For a struggling team such as the Kings, whose 0-3-2 slide had
loosened their grip on a playoff slot, the high-flying Red Wings
presumably would not be high on a list of ideal opponents.</TE>
<TE>   But King Coach Andy Murray begged to differ.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's perfect that it's Detroit," Murray said before the
game, "because it's going to demand full attention to detail and it's
going to make sure that we bring our game back in order to have a
chance....</TE>
<TE>   "I think [if we win] it sends a message to the rest of the league.
If you're sitting in Vancouver tonight, if you're sitting in St.
Louis, if you're sitting in Dallas, if you're sitting in Edmonton,
you're counting on the Kings losing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you can affect the mental psyche of some of these other
teams, who are maybe watching the scoreboard, by going out and
winning a game that nobody thinks you're going to win."</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings, however, aren't exactly steaming into the playoffs
after dominating the league from the start of the season.</TE>
<TE>   After the Red Wings clinched home-ice advantage throughout the
playoffs, Coach Scotty Bowman started giving players time off.
They've won only one of their last six games, among them a 1-1 tie
Wednesday night against the Ducks, and had four regulars missing from
their lineup Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to wake up because we are just not into the game, I
think," said Red Wing goalie Dominik Hasek. "It's sad to say. It's
very sad to say something like that. Teams like L.A. are fighting and
playing desperate hockey. We can't beat them the way we're playing
right now. It's very frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Murray expected them to be excited about playing the Kings,
and not only because the Kings eliminated the Red Wings from the
playoffs last spring.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've got a rivalry with them," Murray said. "Over the
last three years every game we've had with them seems to have been a
one-goal, heated game. It seems to be something that's built up here
for a bit.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons is, we've been as successful against them as
any team in the league over the last three years. They don't like
that."</TE>
<TE>   They also didn't like giving up two goals in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Hasek had matched Potvin save for save until Miller stepped into
the play, took a cross-ice pass from Cliff Ronning and rifled a shot
from the right point past the goaltender with 6:41 to play in the
second period.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's goal was his first in 27 games and fifth of the season,
matching a career high. It was his first point in 19 games and gave
the Kings a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Allison increased the Kings' advantage to 2-0 with 2:06 left in
the period, lifting a shot over Hasek after Adam Deadmarsh corralled
a loose puck in the Red Wing zone, and carried it up the left wing
before feeding a pass in front to Allison.</TE>
<TE>   Buchberger scored his sixth goal at 15:06 of the third period.</TE>

<HD>Even Now, Race Is Heating Up in West</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels already have played three games, but in a critical sense
the season truly starts today. The Angels play the first of 19
consecutive games against their American League West rivals, and if
they play as poorly now as they did last September, the season will
be a long and painful one.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels lost 17 of their final 19 games last season, all
against the Texas Rangers, Seattle Mariners and Oakland Athletics.
The Angels had a winning record last season against the AL Central,
against the AL East and in interleague play, but their abysmal 17-41
record within the division doomed them.</LD>
<LD>   No matter how improved the Angels consider themselves, no more
than two playoff invitations can be extended to AL West teams.</LD>
<TE>   "These are huge," outfielder Darin Erstad said. "We have to play
very good baseball right now. If we struggle in April, we're going to
be in a big hole. We're playing confident baseball now. We're looking
forward to these games."</TE>
<TE>   The optimism is tempered somewhat by the fact that the Angels will
play this weekend's series at Texas with a 23-man roster instead of
the usual 25. Infielder Scott Spiezio's suspension extends to
Saturday, with third baseman Troy Glaus serving his suspension Sunday
and Monday.</TE>
<TE>   And closer Troy Percival, hampered by a strained rib cage, is out
at least until Monday, when doctors will determine whether the Angels
should let him resume pitching or put him on the disabled list. A
bone scan and MRI examination Wednesday were negative.</TE>
<TE>   "When you hear 'MRI test,' you think the worst. It's like a
curse," Manager Mike Scioscia said. "But we only need to find an
answer for the short term."</TE>
<TE>   In Percival's absence, Scioscia indicated Al Levine, Ben Weber and
Donne Wall all might get a chance to close.</TE>

<HD>Bad Hamstring Puts Park on Disabled List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chan Ho Park, hit hard in his first game for the Texas Rangers, was
put on the 15-day disabled list because of a strained right
hamstring. The move was made retroactive to Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Park, the prize pitcher in the off-season free-agent pool, signed
a $65 million, five-year contract with Texas. Park originally hurt
his hamstring during a spring training game against Minnesota on
March 27. He aggravated it in his start Monday on opening day against
Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   The former Dodger gave up six runs and five hits over five innings
in his Ranger debut, an 8-3 loss to the Athletics. He struck out
five.</LD>
<TE>   To fill his spot on the roster, the Rangers recalled right-hander
Francisco Cordova from triple-A Oklahoma. Cordova will join the club
today in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Buck Martinez has a message for Pedro Martinez: Stay out of my
clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   And the Toronto manager is displeased with any Blue Jay player who
might have made the Red Sox pitcher feel welcome Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   When Martinez paid a brief, friendly visit to the Blue Jay locker
room during a rain delay at Fenway Park on Wednesday, he violated one
of baseball's unwritten rules, according to the manager.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto closer Kelvim Escobar, a longtime friend of Pedro
Martinez, said the Boston ace seemed headed for another destination
when he came upon the open clubhouse door during the rain delay. He
wandered in, said hello to several Blue Jays and left after a few
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Camaraderie between opponents can undermine a player's competitive
edge, the manager said. Buck Martinez said he doesn't even approve of
the common practice of opposing players greeting each other with hugs
and handshakes before games.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get out there and you're supposed to spike a guy at
second base or knock a guy down at home, it's like, 'Geez, I just
said hi to that guy,'" he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's a different era," he said. "I know a lot of players
have the same agents. I know they go to dinner from time to time. But
to walk into another clubhouse in full uniform is ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Finley, who missed his spot in the Cleveland Indian rotation
the day before his wife appeared in court to face charges she
attacked him, was expected to rejoin the team tonight in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Actress Tawny Kitaen Finley made a brief court appearance in Santa
Ana on Thursday and was ordered to reappear in court April 29 on two
misdemeanor charges of inflicting corporal injury and battery. If
convicted, she faces up to one year in jail and a $6,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Kitaen Finley will be allowed to live in the couple's Newport
Beach home while Finley will stay elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Greg Maddux threw for 20 minutes in the bullpen and expects to
start Sunday when the Atlanta Braves play the New York Mets. Maddux,
who missed his opening-day assignment Monday because of an inflamed
nerve in his lower back, received a cortisone shot on Wednesday....
Jose Mesa agreed to a $4.75 million, one-year contract extension with

<HD>De La Hoya-Vargas on Hold</HD>
<DH>Boxing: WBC champion injures left wrist, postponing May
fight. Promoters hope to reschedule for Sept. 14.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The same left that has thumped many of Oscar De La Hoya's opponents
into submission over his boxing career has knocked out the
super-welterweight champion's eagerly anticipated May 4 fight against
Fernando Vargas.</LD>
<LD>   De La Hoya's chronically tender left wrist flared up while
training in Big Bear last week, sending him to three doctors. He said
he was acting on the recommendation of an orthopedic surgeon when he
postponed the unification championship fight to rest and rehabilitate
the injury, which was diagnosed as a severe sprain of the third
metacarpal joint.</LD>
<LD>   It is the second consecutive fight that De La Hoya, 29, has had to
postpone or cancel because of the wrist. He underwent arthroscopic
surgery in November for torn cartilage in the wrist, shelving his
planned Dec. 8 fight against Roman Karmazin.</LD>
<TE>   "He hit a sparring partner on the top of the head last Thursday
[March 28]," Dr. Tony Daly, who prescribed the rest, said of De La
Hoya's latest injury. "He thought he could go on but he couldn't."</TE>
<TE>   A May 4 bout was impossible, his doctor said.</TE>
<TE>   "He could not train for three or four weeks," Daly said. "So he
would have gone into the [Vargas] fight as a one-handed fighter,
basically. Plus, it's not just rest. There's physical therapy
involved."</TE>
<TE>   Promoter Bob Arum of Top Rank said that with De La Hoya's rest and
rehab, he was hopeful the fight could be rescheduled for Sept. 14 at
Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "Besides not training for the next few weeks, Tony doesn't want
him fighting until August at the earliest," Arum said. "If we're
going to wait that long, why not wait until September, which is a
better pay-per-view environment."</TE>
<TE>   If the fight does happen then, it will have been almost 15 months
since De La Hoya's last fight. De La Hoya (34-2, 27 knockouts) took
the World Boxing Council's 154-pound title from Javier Castillejo on
June 23, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas (22-1, 20 KOs), the World Boxing Assn. junior-middleweight
champion, last fought on Sept. 22, when he beat Jose "Shibata" Flores
for the vacant title.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas' camp made light of the postponement.</TE>
<TE>   "Fernando's handling it well because it's not unusual for Oscar De
La Hoya to be indecisive," said Rolando Arellano, the 24-year-old
Vargas' manager. "I'm fighting, I'm not fighting. I'm coming back,
I'm retiring. I have a hand injury, you're asking for too much money.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew this was a probability when we started this. We were
laughing about it. Three days ago we said he'd probably come up with
an injury ... rather than face a very turbulent situation. We've
already gone through this with him once before."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than wait until September to face De La Hoya, Vargas'
handlers may pursue another fight in the interim.</TE>
<TE>   "In the event it is a true injury," Arelano said, "we wish him
well and a rapid recovery because we want him in the ring."</TE>
<TE>   Arum said he understood the frustration felt by Vargas' promoters.</TE>
<TE>   "The Main Events guys got really [upset]," Arum said. "But that's
a normal reaction. I know I was [upset] when [Marco Antonio] Barrera
pulled out [against Erik Morales]. But what can you do? The guy got
hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Arum, though, said De La Hoya's most recent injury could have been
avoided.</TE>
<TE>   "He did not do the proper rehab after the surgery," said Arum, who
only recently rejoined De La Hoya after a less-than-amicable split.
"He should have been wearing a steel brace on the wrist in training
and he wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Arum said De La Hoya was in good spirits.</TE>
<TE>   "No. 1, he's disappointed," Arum said. "But ... he was afraid that
this was a career-ending injury and that is not the case."</TE>

<HD>'80s Lakers Would Still Steal the Show(time)</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers have won consecutive NBA titles, but they are not better
than the Laker "Showtime" teams of the 1980s, according to Byron
Scott, now the coach of the New Jersey Nets.</LD>
<LD>   Scott, a member of those dynasty teams, told Fred Kerber of the
New York Post: "They've got two great players in Shaq and Kobe and
they've got a bunch of guys who are pretty good. With no disrespect
to those guys, we had five guys who probably could have been
All-Stars every year."</LD>
<LD>   Of the matchups, he said O'Neal would have scored on Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, but Kareem would have scored right back. "There's no
way Shaq would have stopped Kareem. Nobody could stop that sky hook."</LD>
<TE>   At shooting guard--Bryant against Scott himself--Scott
acknowledged that Kobe would have won that battle. However, he said
Magic Johnson would have given the edge to the earlier Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "They wouldn't have had an answer for Magic. Kobe would have had
to guard Magic, and Magic was just a beast in the post."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which NBA team holds the record for the highest
winning percentage in home games in a season?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eastern bias: Jon Heyman of Newsday commenting recently on Mo
Vaughn: "Three days into his Mets' career, Vaughn's already made more
friends than he found in three years in Anaheim, a baseball wasteland
if there ever was one.</TE>
<TE>   "Vaughn is an Easterner all the way, and Southern California has
all the intensity of a deflated beach ball. Out there, patrons
sometimes select seats by their tanning potential."</TE>
<TE>   You're right, Jon. It's usually sunny and clear here--but you
wouldn't know about good weather.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Still bitter: Reuters reports that U.S short-track speedskater
Apolo Anton Ohno, who won the gold medal when his South Korean rival
was disqualified, was voted by Korean college students as "most
unwelcome" at soccer's World Cup, a Seoul magazine reported.</TE>
<TE>   The poll of 442 college students on the most unwelcome figure gave
Ohno 174 votes to only 68 for Osama bin Laden.</TE>

<TE>   Alcott on the move: It's a busy week for LPGA Hall of Fame golfer
Amy Alcott. She threw out the first pitch at the Dodger game on
Wednesday night and she's the tournament host of the Office Depot
Championships that begin today at El Caballero Country Club in
Tarzana.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Uninvited: Texas Ranger third baseman Herbert Perry: "I guess I'm
the only one of Steve Spurrier's former Florida quarterbacks who
isn't going to Washington with him. I'm afraid that tells you about
my quarterbacking."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1993, North Carolina defeated
Michigan's "Fab Five" team, 77-71, in the men's NCAA championship
game at New Orleans.</TE>

<TE>   Trivia answer: The Boston Celtics, .976, 40-1, in 1985-86.</TE>

sure was nice while it lasted. If this is the end of Michael Jordan
as a Washington Wizard, at least let us agree that it was great
fun....</TE>
<TE>   "Michael Jordan was the best thing to happen to the Washington
Wizards in 20 years. If it only seems to have lasted 20 minutes,
well, they were a great 20 minutes."</TE>

<HD>Clippers Don't Get Results</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Better team play doesn't work as Mavericks
are simply too much in 115-90 rout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>The Clippers showed up, played with energy and passion, seemed to
enjoy each other's company on the basketball court and still got
thumped by 25 points. File it under the category: this stuff happens.</LD>
<LD>   After all, the Clippers are virtually out of the playoff race and
don't have much left to play for. Their opponents Thursday, the
Dallas Mavericks, are playing for the Midwest Division championship
and the best possible record they can achieve.</LD>
<LD>   In other words, the Clippers' 115-90 loss to the Mavericks before
a sellout crowd of 20,050 at the American Airlines Center was fairly
predictable. It was, however, a giant leap forward from Wednesday's
lackluster performance against the Utah Jazz at Salt Lake City.</LD>
<TE>   There was no bickering and there were few lapses in judgment or
maturity Thursday. The Clippers played hard and simply lost to a
superior team reaching its peak.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Clippers were within 78-73 early in the fourth
quarter before the Mavericks finished with a 37-17 run. This was more
about what the Mavericks accomplished than what the Clippers failed
to do during their third consecutive loss and sixth in the last seven
games.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a lot of weapons," Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said of
Midwest-leading Dallas. "I thought we played well in the first half.
We did a pretty good job, but we had a breakdown on screen and rolls.
I thought our effort was good, but we gave up too many points in the
second half. And we didn't score like we did against them earlier in
the season."</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time in four games the Clippers failed to reach
100 points in splitting the season series with Dallas. Center Michael
Olowokandi led the Clippers with 19 points but did not start because
he missed the team breakfast. It didn't seem to matter, though,
because Olowokandi helped get the Clippers out to an 11-point lead in
the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Dirk Nowitzki couldn't guard Olowokandi in the first half. Neither
could Raef LaFrentz. Or Evan Eschmeyer.</TE>
<TE>   So Dallas Coach Don Nelson turned to Shawn Bradley--all 7 feet 6
of him. Bradley will never be confused with a future hall of famer,
but by holding, pushing and generally annoying Olowokandi for most of
41/2 minutes late in the second quarter, he helped the Mavericks take
their first lead.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi torched the Mavericks for 13 points in the first half,
but he scored only three after Bradley entered the game with Dallas
trailing, 40-35. By halftime, after guard Steve Nash darted through
the Clippers to score with mere seconds to play, the Mavericks held
their first lead, 44-43.</TE>
<TE>   Things stayed tight until the fourth, when the Mavericks surged.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers opened the final quarter on a 5-0 run, drawing within
78-73 on two free throws by Elton Brand with 10:41 remaining. Brand
would score 13 points and take nine rebounds, failing in his bid to
match Swen Nater's franchise record with 54 double-doubles in a
season.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next 31/2 minutes, Dallas outscored the Clippers, 21-6,
warming up for Saturday's showdown with the San Antonio Spurs. The
Mavericks also would outscore the fading Clippers, 37-22, in the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "The defense was great," Dallas guard Nick Van Exel said. "The
Clippers didn't get as many open looks at the basket. We slowed
Olowokandi down. We changed our defensive mind-set and we tried to
get him out of the game as best we could and make other players beat
us."</TE>
<TE>   The other Clippers struggled to find any consistency. Corey
Maggette was typical of the Clippers. Maggette made several strong
moves to the hoop, but was one of five from behind the three-point
arc.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers missed 14 of 18 three-pointers Thursday, a night
after missing 13 of 14 in their 99-87 loss against Utah. The Clippers
shot 43% against the Mavericks, an improvement over their
37.8%-shooting against the Jazz.</TE>
<TE>   "They just outplayed us in the second half," Gentry said of the
Mavericks. "They got some separation on us. They made some plays and
we didn't."</TE>

<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Center Michael Olowokandi skipped the team's breakfast Thursday
morning and Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry did not start him against the
Dallas Mavericks. Olowokandi would play 34 minutes in relief of Sean
Rooks, scoring 19 points and taking eight rebounds.</LD>
<LD>   Olowokandi also would express his regret for missing the
meal--sort of.</LD>
<LD>   He said he was absent because he chose to sleep late after playing
35 minutes, scoring seven points on two-of-15 shooting, in
Wednesday's loss to the Utah Jazz at Salt Lake City.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel bad if I disgraced myself in any way," he said after the
Clippers' 115-90 loss to the Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was a team meeting to assess video[tape] or something like
that, I would have been there."</TE>
<TE>   According to Olowokandi, Gentry simply wanted to count heads at
breakfast. The players were then free to return to their rooms to
sleep. Gentry refused to elaborate except to say that Olowokandi
violated a team policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't get in until 2 in the morning," Olowokandi said. "I did
violate the team policy. I have no regrets. I need my rest,
especially at this point in the season where we're playing so many
back-to-backs [games on consecutive nights]."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers play four of their final six games at Staples Center,
including Sunday against the Denver Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   The final five: Monday at Seattle, April 12 against Sacramento at
home, April 13 against Minnesota at home, April 16 against Memphis at
home and April 17 at Golden State. The Clippers (37-39) need four
victories to have their third .500 season since the franchise moved
from San Diego before the 1984-85 season.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's game was the Clippers' sixth and final appearance on
national cable television this season. They were 4-2 on either TNT or
TBS this season. They were on TV nationally only once last season.
Their last appearance before that was during the 1997-98 season.</TE>

<HD>On the Surface, U.S. Is Fine</HD>
<DH>Davis Cup: With Sampras playing on his beloved grass, Spain
is a decided underdog.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Ninety-nine times Pete Sampras has emerged victorious on grass as a
professional, which includes winning Wimbledon seven times.</LD>
<LD>   Of those 99 matches, how many have been played in the United
States?</LD>
<LD>   None.</LD>
<TE>   Strange, but true.</TE>
<TE>   The leading grass-court player of all time finally is able to take
his show off the foreign road, starting here today in the Davis Cup
quarterfinals against Spain. Sampras will play Alex Corretja in the
second singles match, after teammate Andy Roddick's opener against
Davis Cup rookie Tommy Robredo at Westside Tennis Club.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course I know he has the advantage because he's been playing
like hundreds of matches on grass and I probably play like eight or
10 in my whole life," Corretja said.</TE>
<TE>   What is viewed as a revenge match on grass against Spain--which
beat the United States, 5-0, on clay in the semifinals in 2000 at
Santander, Spain--also could end up reviving Sampras' year.</TE>
<TE>   His aura and confidence took a big hit last month in Miami when he
was dispatched in straight sets in the third round by Chilean
qualifier Fernando Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe has noticed a difference in
Sampras since he hit the grass courts. After all, surface matters.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously he played a terrible match in Miami, which he would be
the first to admit," McEnroe said. "He went back and worked a few
hard days with [Jose] Higueras and came here with a great attitude.
He's been working hard in practice. We've been doing drills with him
on the court, which was foreign to him for a long time. Grass
obviously makes him feel real comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "When he serves and volleys, his awareness level is a little
higher, which I didn't see in Miami. I saw him serving and coming in
and not really being that intense. He knows on grass you've got to
serve, come in and be ready to go, be ready to jump."</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe and his assistant, Jim Courier, watched Sampras practice
on the grass this week and marveled at his athleticism.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, he's still one of the couple of favorites at Wimbledon,"
McEnroe said. "The way I see him in practice is good enough to win an
Open. It's a question of week in, week out, of doing it on the tour
and doing it in his matches."</TE>
<TE>   Sampras declared the court to be in good shape, noting that the
USTA brought over the man in charge of the grounds at Queen's Club in
London. He said the bounces were true, and the balls were slightly
lighter and softer than the ones used at Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the grass is pretty identical [to Wimbledon]," he said.
"I don't know how the other guys feel, but I think it's playing very
true. Not too many bad bounces out there. I think it's one of the
best grass courts we have in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Said Corretja: "Right now, we don't have any grass courts in
Spain. We feel proud the U.S. team chose to play on grass. Because
they show some respect and they kind of feel they need to play on our
worst surface to beat us."</TE>
<TE>   About a year and a half ago, the situation was reversed. But the
Americans weren't using the word "respect" when the Spaniards
selected clay for their semifinal match. Andre Agassi and Sampras
were injured and stayed home, and ultimately, the U.S. was shut down
and shut out. It was John McEnroe's last appearance as captain.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Hit Nothing but Skids</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Scoreless streak reaches 24 innings after 3-0
loss to Giants in which they get only three hits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few not-so-fun facts for the Dodgers to ponder while coming to
grips with their first three-game home sweep at the hands of the
hated Giants in 20 years, a midweek mashing completed with San
Francisco's 3-0 victory before 32,064 in Dodger Stadium Thursday
night:</LD>
<LD>   * The Dodgers, who thought a balanced lineup with more speed and
contact hitters would generate more offense than last season, are
batting .136 (12 for 88) as a team and averaging 0.67 runs in three
games.</LD>
<LD>   * The Dodgers have not scored in 24 innings, a streak dating back
to the third inning of Tuesday's season opener, and they were
outscored, 24-2, in three games against San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   * Gary Sheffield, the malcontent who was traded to Atlanta because
the Dodgers couldn't stand any more of his verbal outbursts, is
batting .462 with three home runs and seven runs batted in for the
Braves.</TE>
<TE>   It may be too early for the Dodgers to panic, but it's not too
early to have some serious concerns about a team with a $102-million
payroll and an offense that could file for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're three games into the season, we're not 25 or 30 games in,"
Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "I never like to lose, but I don't
anticipate tweaks or any kind of major overhaul after three games.
That's not a real good message to send to your ballclub as a guy in
charge."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers gained one moral victory Thursday--they kept Giant
slugger Barry Bonds in the park, no minor feat considering Bonds had
ripped four home runs and driven in nine runs in the first two games.</TE>
<TE>   They also got their first decent start of the season, as
23-year-old left-hander Odalis Perez threw five shutout innings,
striking out six, before being touched for three runs in the decisive
sixth.</TE>
<TE>   But rookie right-hander Ryan Jensen gave up three hits in seven
shutout innings, Felix Rodriguez threw a scoreless eighth and Robb
Nen a scoreless ninth for his first save, as the Giants swept the
Dodgers in Los Angeles for the first time since Sept. 24-26, 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen also kept pace with fellow pitchers Livan Hernandez (two
hits, two runs, one RBI Tuesday) and Russ Ortiz (two-run homer
Wednesday) with two singles, including a leadoff hit to center to
start the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Tsuyoshi Shinjo flied to right, and Rich Aurilia singled sharply
to center to put two runners on for Bonds. After a visit from Dodger
pitching Coach Jim Colborn, Perez plunked Bonds in the right shoulder
with his first pitch to load the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Sanders lofted a full-count pitch to deep left for a
sacrifice fly and a 1-0 lead. Perez hit J.T. Snow to load the bases,
and David Bell followed with a broken-bat single to center, scoring
Aurilia and Bonds for a 3-0 lead. Tracy summoned reliever Paul
Quantrill, who struck out Pedro Feliz to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   After suffering lopsided losses (9-2 and 12-0) in the first two
games, all Tracy wanted Thursday was to have a chance to make some
decisions that would matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this lineup going to work? I didn't know after the first two
games, because I did a couple of managerial things in the first two
innings, and then all I could do was sit back and watch," Tracy said.
"It's important to get to the point where we're playing baseball the
way I envisioned in spring training."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers reached that point Thursday, as Perez blanked the
Giants for five innings and the offense generated scoring
opportunities in the second and third. But a Dodger offense that is
supposed to manufacture runs suffered a few breakdowns on the
assembly line.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Green doubled off Jensen to open the second but was stranded
when Brian Jordan flied to right, Adrian Beltre struck out swinging
at a breaking ball in the dirt and Eric Karros flied to right.</TE>
<TE>   That couldn't match the third inning for Dodger frustration,
though. Mark Grudzielanek opened with a single and beat Jensen's
throw to second on Perez's bunt, putting runners on first and second.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Roberts advanced the runners with a sacrifice bunt, but Cesar
Izturis followed with a weak grounder back to the mound.
Grudzielanek, who broke for home on contact, was tagged out in a
rundown by catcher Yorvit Torrealba, who then fired to second to nail
Izturis for the final out of the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not getting scary," Beltre said. "We're three games into
this, and things are going to happen. Guys are probably trying to do
too much. Everyone wants to win, but we just have to start swinging
the bats better."</TE>

<LD>No one expects the Dodgers to erase 10-run deficits, such as the one
they faced in the fourth inning against the Giants Wednesday night,
but an early three- or four-run deficit might be just as daunting an
obstacle for their offense.</LD>
<LD>   In placing speedy Dave Roberts and Cesar Izturis and contact
specialist Paul Lo Duca in the first three lineup spots, Manager Jim
Tracy has made it clear he is favoring little ball over the long ball
this season.</LD>
<LD>   But unless the Dodgers score early, add to their lead throughout
the game and get much better starting pitching than they did in the
first two games--9-2 and 12-0 losses--they won't manufacture many
wins, and they won't mount many comebacks.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not going to be a big home run-hitting team; we're going to
be a scrappy team that has to put the ball in play to score runs," Lo
Duca said. "So we can't afford to fall behind early. I know it
happened in the first two games, but it's not going to happen all
season."</TE>
<TE>   It seems ironic that a team with a $102-million payroll is relying
so much on three top-of-the-order players who will make a combined
$812,500 this season, but as Roberts ($217,500) and Izturis
($215,000)--and, to a certain extent, Lo Duca ($380,000)--go, so will
go the Dodger offense.</TE>
<TE>   If those three batters don't get on base at a high rate, the
Dodgers' top two power hitters, Shawn Green and Brian Jordan, won't
have many RBI opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely odd--the impact guys at the top of the order
[usually] seem to make more money--but I do think how Cesar and I go,
the offense will go," Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not because I think so much about Cesar and I, but it's like any
lineup. If you can get things going at the top of the order, you can
get the offense going. No one likes hitting with the bases empty."</TE>
<TE>   Who says pitchers can't hit? San Francisco starter Ryan Jensen
singled in the third and sixth innings Thursday night, giving Giant
pitchers five hits in the series. Livan Hernandez had two singles,
two runs and an RBI Tuesday, and Russ Ortiz hit a two-run homer
Wednesday night.... Tracy, who used 114 different lineups while
trying to compensate for a barrage of injuries in 2001, used the same
lineup for the third consecutive game Thursday night. Only twice last
season did he use the same lineup for three consecutive games.</TE>

<HD>Staff Questions Are at Fever Pitch</HD>
<DH>Baseball: What was supposed to be a solid foundation for
the Dodgers is already showing cracks, but Evans isn't panicking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodger rotation is already under the microscope and stirring
concern despite an encouraging effort Thursday night from left-hander
Odalis Perez in a 3-0 loss to the San Francisco Giants at Dodger
Stadium. The season has only started, but the Dodgers are on the
defensive and searching for answers again.</LD>
<LD>   "The stuff that we counted on, our pitching, really hasn't been
there so far," second baseman Mark Grudzielanek said. "We also
haven't done a thing offensively, so it magnifies it even more when
you lose [big].</LD>
<LD>   "But there's no question that you can't help but look at [the
rotation]. We have to hope that everyone gets comfortable here rather
quickly."</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers believe the rotation will provide a solid foundation
for a team not expected to be one of the major leagues' top run
producers. However, the Nos. 1 and 2 starters began poorly, and the
Giants completed a season-opening sweep although Perez pitched
effectively and aggressively for 52/3 innings in his Dodger debut.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown and Hideo Nomo were chased early in consecutive
blowout losses, and the rest of the new-look unit has issues too.</TE>
<TE>   Will Andy Ashby's surgically repaired right elbow cooperate for 30
or more starts? Can talented but jittery Japanese left-hander
Kazuhisa Ishii overcome his anxiety and contribute in his first
season in the big leagues? And although Perez provided some optimism
Thursday, he was inconsistent in parts of three seasons with the
Atlanta Braves.</TE>
<TE>   "These next [two] games are big in the sense that we just need to
see some [positive] signs," catcher Paul Lo Duca said. "Is Andy fully
back? Can Ishii do this at an every fifth-day level? We obviously
want to win them, but to see how the guys throw is more important."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball officials said the Dodgers won't contend in the National
League West unless the rotation excels because of their deficiencies
on offense, and the team's architect acknowledges the group is off to
a shaky start.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, no one liked what happened the first couple of days,"
General Manager Dan Evans said of the Dodgers being outscored, 21-2,
in losing the first two games. "The problem is that the focus is
immense simply because it's the first two games of the season, but we
know that our pitching staff is going to be solid.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that was an aberration, and we're not concerned about
where we are over the long haul of 162 games. Things happen at this
time of the year. The key is not to overreact as a result of one or
two games."</TE>
<TE>   The fans' reaction was predictably bad.</TE>
<TE>   They booed Brown in a 9-2 opening-day loss, directing their
frustration at the staff ace who gave up nine hits--including two
home runs--and seven earned runs. Many questioned whether Brown, who
did not possess his typical sharp command, should have started the
opener after struggling in spring training.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander, who also underwent elbow surgery last season, is
struggling with his release point and gradually building endurance,
and one NL executive said it might have been wiser for the Dodgers to
work him in slowly. They could have put Brown at the back end of the
rotation, giving his elbow more time to recover, instead of giving
him another starring role.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo wasn't much better than Brown in a wild three-inning outing
in Wednesday's 12-0 loss. Manager Jim Tracy yanked the right-hander
in the first start of his second stint with the Dodgers after he
walked six and threw only 44 strikes in 88 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo also gave up six hits, including a homer, and four runs. The
Dodgers gave Nomo a two-year, $13.25-million contract after he had a
5.34 earned-run average in the second half of last season for Boston.</TE>
<TE>   He was 3-1 with a 1.80 ERA this spring, but scouts said Nomo was
throwing in the mid-80s without much movement on his pitches against
the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got some experienced baseball people here, and we know
where our strengths are and where our weaknesses are," Evans said.
"Yes, we've had a [few] bad games and everybody knows it.</TE>
<TE>   "Does that change the way we view our club and our [pitching]
staff in general? No. I understand the fans would be concerned....
but I think we will have more quality outings than bad ones."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger fans are keeping their fingers crossed.</TE>

<DH>This Good Ol' Boy May Be Ornery at Times, but His Attitude
and Passion to Succeed Have Made Him One of Racing's Greatest</DH>

<LD>John Force is fired up.</LD>
<LD>   The office of the world's most recognizable drag racer is a flurry
of activity, voices raised, everyone trying to be heard. And Force is
in the middle, typically getting in the last word.</LD>
<LD>   Right now, Force would like to stick his cowboy boots through the
phone and kick his attorney's you-know-what. He's passionate, but is
he mean? Some in this loyal extended family think so. Force calls it
intensity, but the line is blurry.</LD>
<TE>   "I get wound up, but I ain't mean," Force says defensively.
"That's what it takes to win 11 championships. You have to live it
every day.</TE>
<TE>   "That's probably what made me a success."</TE>
<TE>   And what a success he is. Force is at the Strip at Las Vegas Motor
Speedway for the SummitRacing.com Nationals this weekend, trying to
put away the 100th national event funny car win in his National Hot
Rod Assn. career. It will put him in rarefied air with the likes of
Winston Cup drivers Richard Petty, who had 200 wins, and David
Pearson, who had 105.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, A.J. Foyt won 79 times, the late Dale Earnhardt 76
times and Mario Andretti 65.</TE>
<TE>   But Force is restless for any number of reasons. There's a snag in
a land development deal. He could sell some stock at a huge profit,
but he's balking because it's a sponsor that has shown faith in him.
He doesn't like the location of a decal on the transporter truck.
He's trying to determine if he really did talk to Steven Tyler of
Aerosmith that morning or whether someone was playing a hoax.</TE>
<TE>   And one other thing. He lost in the first round of his most recent
race, the Gatornationals, when he failed to make a weekend pass under
five seconds for the first time in years. Three weeks between races
have been too long for someone who is unsure if he can ever be a guy
who finishes second, third or fourth every week.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was ever motivated going into a race ..." Force says before
jumping back and forth between thoughts, topics and stream of
consciousness as he is prone to do. "I know they talked about
[winning the 100th in] Gainesville, but I had so many irons in the
fire--I was filming commercials for [series sponsor] Powerade and I
lost my focus and we lost the first round--well, the car dropped a
cylinder and we just got outrun [by Dean Skuza]--but I really wasn't
in the game."</TE>
<TE>   He'll drive his Castrol-sponsored Mustang in Vegas with,
appropriately, an Elvis Presley theme for Force, a huge Elvis fan. He
has won at every track on the schedule except this one, and it will
be the first national event for Force's daughter, Ashley, 19, driving
a supercomp dragster.</TE>
<TE>   It's a special week that could get a lot more special.</TE>
<TE>   "If the track's good, we can run with the power boys because we
are the power boys, and if the track's loose, I can drive with the
best," Force says, not exaggerating the truth. "I want to get it over
with. I want to do it because my daughter's going to be there, and
now that she's driving, she'll know what it means to win because
she's been trying to win. I want to do it because I want to stand up
there with all the guys and say we did it as a team."</TE>
<TE>   The team concept is very important to Force. A homage to Vince
Lombardi hangs on his office wall, and he insists his three funny car
teams--with drivers Tony Pedregon, who won in Gainesville, and Gary
Densham, who set the national speed record in the season
opener--share their bonuses evenly; he doesn't want one of his crew
dogging it if Pedregon needs a part from the Force trailer.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1993, Force has won 78 times in 190 events (41%), and been
second 33 times (17%). He has won the series championship 11 times,
including the last nine.</TE>
<TE>   He credits three entities for getting him here. His parents,
Harold and Betty, supported him in the early years with all the money
they had--which wasn't much. His cousin, Gene Beaver, affectionately
called "Uncle Beavs"--whose ashes are in a small trophy in Force's
office--sold Force a Vega funny car and taught him the ropes when he
had no license, no money and no clue. And Austin Coil became Force's
crew chief in 1985 on one condition.</TE>
<TE>   "Coil said if I'm going to work for you, you have to agree to let
me teach you how to drive," Force says. "That's when he put a
throttle stop on the car. That's when we ran Odessa, El Paso, every
[bad track] across the country and I said, 'Why are we running all
these junk racetracks? They don't pay enough money.' He said because
if you can learn to run on every track in the country, when you get
to those national events when it rains, you'll be able to go right
down a slick road.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I tell my daughter, anyone can win on a good track;
can you win on a bad track?"</TE>
<TE>   Winning on bad tracks has been good to Force, who at times seems a
walking contradiction. He makes $25,000 for a two-hour appearance and
could eat at the finest steakhouse every night, yet his refrigerator
is sparsely stocked with peanut butter, bologna and cheese--the
staples of his childhood. He never goes anywhere without a St.
Christopher medal around his neck, but ignores the seat belt in his
Jaguar when he makes a quick trip from the shop to his house. He may
be a good ol' boy on the outside with a thing for 1950s memorabilia,
but few know he collects candles, antiques and paintings that
decorate his Yorba Linda townhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "When I'm home is when I'm there [at the track]," Force says from
his deck overlooking a man-made lake. "When I'm up there in that bed,
I'm afraid that someone is stealing my fame or stealing my sponsors,
or winning a race because I ain't there."</TE>
<TE>   So his addictive personality races forward in a straight line
aimed at winning, too often at the expense of the relationships he
holds dearest.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't know any other way to do it. But with four
daughters--three in their teens--he's trying.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm thinking is I want more time with my children--being
with Ashley made me realize what I missed," says Force, 52. "I called
Kenny Bernstein the other day. I said, 'Kenny, I think I'm going to
have a heart attack,' He goes, 'Well, you've run all those teams, you
don't know how to have a life--why don't you focus on your kid? I
said I want to. He said, 'I'm going to win this [top fuel]
championship and I'm going to retire. I'm going to beat that [Larry]
Dixon kid just to prove I can beat him, and then I'm going to
retire.' I said, 'Kenny, I don't know how to retire.'</TE>
<TE>   "It scares me. You know what my biggest fear is? Getting hurt so I
can't drive. If I wasn't driving, I wouldn't know what to do with my
life."</TE>
<TE>   Force says that every Sunday morning motorcycle ride that he takes
with Coil ends five miles down the road at a signal light when they
start talking about how to make his funny car a little bit faster.
They invariably head back to the Yorba Linda shop that will one day
be part of a racing-themed complex he refers to as "Graceland."
Ultimately, Force wants a destination where his fans can tour his
shop and, eventually, a museum, apparel/collectible store, theme
restaurant and hotel.</TE>
<TE>   But being among the most marketable stars in motor sports has its
downside.</TE>
<TE>   "[The fans] don't know that they send their collectibles and
you're down here until midnight signing them and you're wondering why
you don't have a life," Force says. "But they buy the stuff, they pay
the bills, you owe them an autograph, don't you? ...</TE>
<TE>   "That's the problem with too many superstars. They get too much
money, too many Ferraris and they forget why they came. They forget
what made them a star and the people who got them there and the fans
who got them there, and that's what I don't want to lose."</TE>
<TE>   Force can't forget his roots. A natural workaholic and a truck
driver by trade, he grew up in a 33-foot stainless steel trailer
house--which is smaller than his bus--that was occupied by a family
of seven, including four boys. He slept on the foldout couch in high
school, but only after his father finished watching "The Tonight
Show." Force joined the Teamsters and started driving a truck--he
still has his Class 1 license enabling him to drive one of his seven
transporters--and has always maintained an affinity for the working
class.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the fear of being poor," Force says. "I always say I ain't
never going back to that trailer house. If anything, that's what made
me a success. The fear of that trailer house. That's why I pay cash
for everything, so if the day ever comes where I get hurt, they can't
take it from me."</TE>
<TE>   They can't take away his victories, or his legacy. When he gets
No. 100, he'll simply set a new goal. He says he'll drive for another
five years, at least.</TE>
<TE>   Voted No. 2 among the NHRA's all-time greatest drivers behind Don
Garlits--who preceded him--Force can be secure in his spot in racing
history.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want my legacy to be that I won the most races or had the
most trophies or made the most money," Force says. "When I saw what
Richard Petty had, what Darrel Waltrip had, what Dale Earnhardt
had--the fans. They always took the time for the fans, and a lot of
the guys don't. If my legacy would be that I had the most fans, then
we won. Even if you never won a championship, you won, because people
loved you the most."</TE>

<HD>Buckeye States His Case</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Ohio-bred U S S Tinosa, the fourth choice in
the Santa Anita Derby, could be ready to make an impression.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ohio might be one of Kentucky's border states, but finding an
Ohio-bred colt at the Kentucky Derby is harder than turning up a
Michigan fan in Columbus.</LD>
<LD>   In 127 years, only one Ohio-bred has won the Derby--favored
Wintergreen, who didn't win another race in 1909. In the last 36
years, only five horses from the Buckeye state have run in the Derby,
which really isn't much of a surprise. Ohio breeds about 1.5 million
more hogs than horses.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, in 1999 there were only 635 thoroughbred foals bred in
Ohio. That's compared to Kentucky, the leader on the list with 9,826.
Three years ago, 11 states bred more thoroughbreds than Ohio.</LD>
<TE>   But two of those 635 Ohio-breds--Harlan's Holiday and U S S
Tinosa--have advanced to what might be called the Kentucky Derby
semifinals. Harlan's Holiday won the Florida Derby three weeks ago
and with one prep to run--the Blue Grass at Keeneland on April 13--is
a lukewarm favorite for the Kentucky Derby. U S S Tinosa, who's also
trained by an Ohio-bred--Jerry Hollendorfer, who sneaked off from
school in Akron to bet horses--is the 6-1 fourth choice on the
morning line for Saturday's $750,000 Santa Anita Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Should Hollendorfer go all the way with U S S Tinosa at Churchill
Downs on May 4, he'll be the biggest horseman to come out of Ohio
since Leonard Slye. Never heard of him? Well, a little later, after
Ohio, he became Roy Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   Although U S S Tinosa, named after a well-decorated U.S. submarine
that sank 16 enemy ships in World War II, has a solid and consistent
record, he has raced largely in the shadows of the big time.
Hollendorfer didn't expose the gray colt to Santa Anita until
February, when he won a minor stake, beating no one who's running
Saturday. On March 17, in his last start, U S S Tinosa finished
second, two lengths behind Medaglia d'Oro, in the San Felipe Stakes.
Medaglia d'Oro's final Kentucky Derby warmup will be the Wood
Memorial at Aqueduct on April 13.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is that Jerry, a guy who doesn't say much, is saying
that he's going to win Saturday," said Peter Abruzzo, a Chicagoan who
races U S S Tinosa in a partnership with Barry Thiriot. A victory by
his colt would give Abruzzo a 44th birthday present a day early.</TE>
<TE>   To win the 65th Santa Anita Derby, U S S Tinosa will have to beat
Came Home--the 6-5 favorite who has lost only once in six starts--and
Mayakovsky, the 3-1 second choice who's coming off a sharp
33/4-length victory in Aqueduct's Gotham three weeks ago. Rounding
out the eight-horse field for the 11/8-mile race are Jack's Silver,
Lusty Latin, Proud Citizen, Easy Grades--the 9-2 third choice--and
Danthebluegrassman, the Bob Baffert trainee who beat U S S Tinosa
twice at shorter distances at Golden Gate Fields early this winter.</TE>
<TE>   U S S Tinosa's breeding is hardly fashionable. His sire, Foxhound,
has gone back to England, where he currently stands for a fee of
about $5,000. The dam, Angel Puss, was bought by Jim Eigel's Rosemont
Farm for $4,200.</TE>
<TE>   David Eigel, a son of the Rosemont owner, named U S S Tinosa after
his father-in-law, who served on the 311-foot sub. Eigel sold U S S
Tinosa at a yearling auction for $40,000. Jim Tilton was the trainer
of the horse for five races restricted to Ohio-breds--two of them
resulting in victories. U S S Tinosa was then moved to Arlington
Park, where in his debut under Hollendorfer the colt won an ungraded,
one-mile grass race last October.</TE>
<TE>   Abruzzo, who races a large stable in Chicago, saw that race. He
and Hollendorfer, meeting by chance in a box seat when the trainer
ran third with Mula Gula in the 2000 Arlington Million, had been
doing business together last summer, and after U S S Tinosa's
victory, Hollendorfer called to say that he had a $250,000 option to
buy 50% of the horse. Abruzzo didn't have to be asked twice.</TE>
<TE>   Hollendorfer brought U S S Tinosa back to his year-round base in
Northern California, and before his first race at Golden Gate, Tilton
sold his interest to Thiriot, an Oregonian in the fried chicken
business. Abruzzo is in several businesses, including a tuxedo-rental
chain that has 28 stores.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the most I've ever spent on a horse," said Abruzzo, who
bought his first horse, a standardbred, about 20 years ago. "I run a
lot of horses in various partnerships, because while I like to have a
big stable, I don't believe in putting all my eggs in one basket. The
way this horse has developed, it kind of makes you wish you owned all
of him."</TE>
<TE>   Aware of Ohio-breds and their unimpressive reputation in the
Kentucky Derby, Abruzzo practically issued a disclaimer:</TE>
<TE>   "It might say Ohio-bred on his papers, but he can run and I think
the Kentucky Derby distance [11/4 miles] will be really good for him.
He's really not much of an Ohio-bred--he was really raised in
Kentucky."</TE>
<TE>   Rosemont Farm is in Lexington, Ky., not far from Keeneland. David
Eigel likes to raise Ohio-breds because they're eligible for a lot of
restricted races at Thistledown, the Cleveland track that he favors.
U S S Tinosa won his first race at Thistledown, beating stakes
company after failing twice against maidens at River Downs near
Cincinnati. Overall, U S S Tinosa has three victories, four seconds
and two thirds in 10 races, with earnings of $238,259.</TE>
<TE>   Considering their small representation in the Kentucky Derby since
1966, three of the five Ohio-breds have entered the race with
reasonable credentials. Air Forbes Won had won the Wood in 1982 and
was undefeated in four starts when he ran seventh at Churchill Downs
as the 5-2 favorite. In 1988, Kingpost won the Jim Beam--now the
Spiral--at Turfway Park before running 13th in the Derby. In 1980,
Execution's Reason, the Arlington-Washington Futurity winner,
finished 11th in the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Next might be U S S Tinosa, backed by a tuxedo man who's looking
for the perfect fit.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Aidan O'Brien said Thursday that Johannesburg's only
Kentucky Derby prep will be the Gladness Stakes, at seven furlongs on
grass, Sunday at the Curragh near Dublin.... Kent Desormeaux, who
rides U S S Tinosa, leads the country in purses with $3.5 million.
Desormeaux won the 1997 Santa Anita Derby with Free House and in
1998, after finishing second at Santa Anita, won the Kentucky Derby
with Real Quiet. Desormeaux also won the Kentucky Derby with Fusaichi
Pegasus in 2000. Desormeaux, whose right ankle was sore from a
starting-gate accident Wednesday, took off his mounts Thursday.</TE>

<LD>Those who like quality racing and large fields are in luck for the
next three weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Keeneland will begin its spring meet today with not a single
claiming race, the shortest field numbering seven and with 94 horses
entered in nine races.</LD>
<LD>   The main event is the $100,000 Transylvania Stakes for 3-year-olds
at a mile on the turf.</LD>
<TE>   Stage Call, a son of Sadler's Wells, is the one to beat.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Winstar Farm and trained by Elliott Walden, the
Irish-bred won the Hopemont by 111/4 lengths in his U.S. debut over
the Keeneland turf Oct. 26.</TE>
<TE>   He has trained well for his first race of 2002 and will be ridden
by Pat Day, who was the leading rider at Keeneland's fall meet,
beating Robby Albarado, 25-21.</TE>
<TE>   From the inside out, the rest of the field includes Classic Hero,
Back Packer, Flying Dash, a German-bred who won two of four in Europe
and will be ridden by Jerry Bailey in his U.S. debut for trainer Neil
Drysdale, Political Attack, Mr. O'Brien, Dutch Royalty and Ide Be
Spencers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at Gulfstream Park, Jostle, one of the best 3-year-old
fillies in the country in 2000 but winless in five races last year,
will make her first start for Walden in the $75,000 Banshee Breeze
Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Fit For A King, a 9-year-old, will try for his
seventh victory in a row in the seventh at Santa Anita. The turf race
at about 61/2 furlongs also attracted F J's Pace, Lookn East, Road To
Slew, who is making his first start since winning the Crystal Water
Handicap on March 24, 2001, and Munjiz.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Mansilver. The Idaho-bred gelding is two for two for
trainer Jeff Mullins and will try to remain perfect as he tries a
mile for the first time in today's fifth at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  Derek Ryan. The trainer has won only three of 53 races
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Free Shot in the third,
Exzacta Max, Emerald Yvett, Ginger Roo, Sheza Gladiator and Aetha in
the fourth and Pick Of The Valley and Mansilver in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/199. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $11.80/$1,169.80. Total money bet: $1,234.</TE>

<HD>Johnson Practices, Expects to Play Saturday</HD>

<LD>Left wing Craig Johnson, sidelined the last 21/2 weeks because of an
eye injury, was cleared Thursday to return to practice this morning
and is expected to return to the King lineup for Saturday night's
game against the Edmonton Oilers.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson, sixth among the Kings with 13 goals, was injured in the
first period of a 3-2 victory over the San Jose Sharks on March 18
when Shark captain Owen Nolan checked him face-first into the glass
at San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   The force of the impact opened a cut above Johnson's left eye and
tore the retina in his right, which had been damaged in January when
struck by a high stick by defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski of the Mighty
Ducks.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson, who leads the Kings with a plus-minus rating of plus 13,
underwent surgery to repair the retina the next day and sat out the
last eight games.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm anxious to get back," he said. "It's always tough to be
injured, especially at this time of the year. You want to be in there
battling with your teammates, but it was an injury that I really
couldn't control.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to wait for everything to heal because if you go back too
soon you risk the [possibility] of the same thing happening."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Andy Murray is still looking for consistency from rookie
left wing Jaroslav Bednar, who was back in the lineup Thursday night
against the Detroit Red Wings after being scratched in two of the
previous three games.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very capable of being as good as a [Cliff] Ronning or a
[Adam] Deadmarsh or those top-level players," Murray said of Bednar,
a Slovak who has been up and down with the Kings after leading the
Finnish league in goals last season, "but which game's he going to
bring? ...</TE>
<TE>   "He's a guy [who] I think in his mental approach works from the
glass half empty. I don't know if he totally believes in himself and
knows how great he can be, so we try to build him up a little bit and
tell him. He needs to feel better about himself."</TE>

<HD>Suddenly, Lakers on Wrist Watch</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Tests reveal only a sprain for O'Neal, but
team wants to make sure he won't be rushed back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Laker season paused uncomfortably for several hours on a bright
and chilly Thursday afternoon, long enough for Shaquille O'Neal to
drive into Cambridge for diagnostic tests on a wrist whose health
threatened the organization's hopes for a third consecutive NBA
title.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal, the MVP of the last two NBA Finals, was confirmed to have
a sprained right wrist and no new breaks, a certain relief to the
Lakers with the playoffs two weeks away. A series of X-rays and a CAT
scan did reveal two old fractures in O'Neal's wrist, though they
healed long ago and are neither believed to be affecting his current
ailment nor slowing his ability to recover.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal, who did not play Wednesday in a 94-92 loss at New Jersey,
is doubtful for tonight's game against the Boston Celtics. He will
receive twice-daily treatment and resume playing when the pain
subsides.</LD>
<TE>   In a period in which the seasons of elite players Allen Iverson,
Michael Jordan and Vince Carter were ended by serious injury, O'Neal
has played on an achy right big toe for most of the season, and
recently began to feel tenderness in his wrist.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal played Tuesday in Washington with a light wrap, and awoke
the next morning unable to flex his wrist back. He was examined by
Net physicians, who recommended he not play, and Thursday was
examined by Dr. Alan Ertel, the Celtic hand specialist, at Mt. Auburn
Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said Wednesday that he did not know the origin of the
sprain. He took a hard fall over a row of chairs at Staples Center
last Friday, though it appeared his right hand was free as he fell on
his left side.</TE>
<TE>   While they mulled the chances of resting O'Neal and still holding
off the Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs for home-court
advantage in the second or third round of the playoffs, the Lakers
practiced at a downtown Boston gym.</TE>
<TE>   They prepared for the Celtics without Coach Phil Jackson, who,
according to a team official, "did not feel well," and stayed at the
team hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Power forward Samaki Walker, who doubles as O'Neal's backup at
center, also did not practice and is doubtful for tonight's game
because of a viral infection that caused severe vomiting Thursday
morning.</TE>
<TE>   More than ever, it would appear the Lakers are thinking about
getting sound, and finding momentum before the playoffs arrive, and
now waiting on O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "We know how well we're capable of playing and how Shaq really
kicks it up in the playoffs," guard Brian Shaw said. "We know that,
so we're not overly concerned if we don't get it.</TE>
<TE>   "Our main concern is for him to get healthy and get ready. If he
had to miss the rest of the games the rest of the way, so be it."</TE>
<TE>   There was no sense that O'Neal would sit out the last seven games
of the regular season. Last year at this time, the Lakers also
appeared unstable. Then, Kobe Bryant was recovering from injuries,
and the team was recovering from discord. Everything seemed to heal
at once.</TE>
<TE>   "This is still a championship team," assistant coach Frank Hamblen
said. "It's familiar ground to them. I'm sure it's in the back--or
the front--of all of our minds, what happened last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we were a little complacent. But now it's our time to get
our acts together."</TE>

it for the Lakers. Paul Pierce, averaging 26.3 points, had 33 points.
Bryant had 27 and Shaquille O'Neal, fresh off the injured list, had
17 rebounds. The Celtics defeated the Pacers on Tuesday, also after
being down by 18. Walker averages 22.2 points and 8.0 three-point
attempts. The Celtics have won four of five games. Point guard Kenny
Anderson, recovering from a sprained ankle, is expected to come off
the injured list today and start against the Lakers.</TE>

<LD>Chances are John Cooper or Paul Jones will saddle the winner of
tonight's third race at Los Alamitos, the first 2-year-old race of
2002.</LD>
<LD>   The two trainers will send out two-thirds of the six-horse field
in the 300-yard race for juveniles.</LD>
<LD>   Jones, the meet's leading trainer, will be represented by Shell Ha
and Ima Ham; Cooper's entrants are Loves That Gold and BW
Annihilator.</LD>
<TE>   A chestnut daughter of Holland Ease, Shell Ha has impressed in her
workouts and will be ridden by Ramon Sanchez. She went 220 yards in
12.70 seconds on March 9 and came back two weeks later to run the
same distance in 12.40.</TE>
<TE>   The other youngsters in the field are Rock N Race, who is trained
by Chuck Treece, and Amover, a gelding trained by Blane Schvaneveldt.</TE>
<TE>   Both Rock N Race and Amover were both sired by thoroughbreds. The
former's dad is Apollo, while the latter's father is Red, a
stakes-winning sprinter who was trained by Henry Moreno.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Grim Fandango. 2. Velte. 3. Shell Ha. 4. Royal Ladys
Reward. 5. DDF De Great Saiga. 6. Mr Sunset Saint. 7. Kitas Weapon.
8. Stylish Manner. 9. Hitarun.</TE>
<TE>   Four!  In the first, let's use Grim Fandango, Kid Charismatic and
Shamrock Mint, single Velte in the second, use Shell Ha and BW
Annihilator in the third and Royal Ladys Reward, Boy Hero and Valerio
in the fourth. Total cost: $18.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Shamrock Mint will get Lasix after a
disappointing try in his debut, but keeps Alex Bautista and is
eligible to improve second time out while Valerio switches to Joe
Badilla Jr. as he makes his second start for Schvaneveldt after a
long layoff.</TE>

<HD>LPGA Seeks Stability in L.A.</HD>
<DH>Golf: Frustration grows as tour event begins today at
fourth different Southland location in as many years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The LPGA Tour is back in the Los Angeles area this week and, not
surprisingly, it's at a new venue.</LD>
<LD>   The Office Depot Championship begins today at El Caballero Country
Club in Tarzana, continuing a frustrating trend where the tour
bounces from course to course yearly.</LD>
<LD>   El Caballero is the fourth different LPGA Tour course in as many
years and the Los Angeles stop has also had four different names in
the last six years. It's no wonder attendance at the event has been
dwindling annually.</LD>
<TE>   The instability has hampered tour efforts to build tradition in
the area, a task difficult enough in a town where sports fans
gravitate to the Lakers and Dodgers, golfers would rather be out
playing than watching and the beach and entertainment industry steal
spectators.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knows that better than Amy Alcott, an LPGA Hall of Fame
member who grew up and still lives on the Westside and is doing her
best to establish an LPGA presence in her hometown.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so tough in a city where there is so much going on," Alcott
said. "But it means a lot to me to have a tournament here. This is a
great golf town and I want to see it have a successful tournament."</TE>
<TE>   For that, it needs stability.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the tournament was at Wilshire Country Club. The year
before, it was at Wood Ranch Golf Club in Simi Valley and from
1997-99, it was at Oakmont Country Club in Glendale. The tour has
visited Los Angeles and Orange Counties 24 times since 1955 and has
been played at 12 different courses.</TE>
<TE>   The Oakmont members voted the tournament out after its three-year
deal ended. After Wood Ranch, tournament organizer KJ Sports bowed
out with financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles looked to be without a tournament, as it had been from
1993-96, until The City of Hope expressed interest in moving its
South Carolina tournament closer to its Los Angeles headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be nice to find one place where we could have one
tournament year after year and build some tradition," said Annika
Sorenstam, the No. 1 player in the world. "I don't know why we're
moving every time. I think it's great to have a tournament [in Los
Angeles], but it would be nice to play in one place and get to know a
course."</TE>
<TE>   It also has an impact on fans, who must seek out where the
tournament will be from year to year, rather than taking comfort in a
familiar place.</TE>
<TE>   "When you move around, it's tough for people to find out where
you're playing every week," Sorenstam said.</TE>
<TE>   Kellee Booth, an Orange County native who still lives in Rancho
Santa Margarita, attended every LPGA tournament at Mesa Verde Country
Club in Costa Mesa from 1979-86 and at Los Coyotes Country Club in
Buena Park from 1989-92. She said the experience gave her direction.</TE>
<TE>   "That had a big impact on me," said Booth, a third-year pro. "I
remember watching Nancy Lopez winning out there and thinking 'this
would be a cool way to make a living.' It would be nice if the
tournament was in a stable location."</TE>
<TE>   Tournament director Laurie Petersen, who had only 90 days to find
a course and a sponsor when she took over last year, said she is
looking for the same kind of stability. The tour and its sponsors
have a three-year contract to hold a Los Angeles event. El Caballero
is only committed for one year, though Petersen said it is her option
to move.</TE>
<TE>   "But I have no intentions of doing that," Petersen said. "You want
to keep the same dates, the same title sponsor and the same location.
Those are the things we're trying to do with this tournament."</TE>
<TE>   The LPGA would also like to build a tradition in Los Angeles. Rob
Neal, tour vice president of business affairs, sees the current
sponsorship and venue as a step in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the Los Angeles market is important to any sports
organization," Neal said. "Now that we have some stable ingredients,
I think we have all the pieces in place for that."</TE>
<TE>   Alcott has high hopes. She is happy with the venue and would like
to see the tournament join the list of five other tour events that
have been played continuously at the same course for 22 years or
longer.</TE>
<TE>   "All my history is here in Los Angeles," Alcott said. "I'm proud
of that and I would like to give back to the golf community here and
have the best tournament on tour."</TE>

<HD>Superbike Event Is a First for Fontana</HD>

<LD>Eddie Lawson and Wayne Rainey, two lifetime friends who forged
careers as national and world motorcycle champions while fiercely
competitive against each other, will be back in the spotlight this
weekend as grand marshals of the Yamaha Superbike Challenge at
California Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   Lawson, from Upland, won four world Grand Prix championships from
1984 to 1989. Rainey, from Downey, won three in a row from 1990 to
1992 and was on his way to a fourth when a crash at Italy's Misano
circuit in 1993 severed his spinal cord at the mid-chest level.</LD>
<LD>   "Wayne and I have been buddies and competitors since we were 7 or
so and racing against each other at the old Trojan Speedway," Lawson
reminisced at his Upland home. "Now we're into SuperKarts, but we're
both looking forward to watching the superbikes at Fontana.</LD>
<TE>   "I think a lot of changes have taken place with the perception of
motorcycles since Wayne and I started out. Back 20 years or so, the
public idea of a biker was a Hell's Angel on a Harley. Now, it's cool
to ride a motorcycle, even a Harley. It took a couple of generations
to lose that bad image.</TE>
<TE>   "And for a good image, there's nothing as exciting as watching a
couple of riders going through a turn at 150 [mph]
handlebar-to-handlebar. They'll be doing that at California
Speedway."</TE>
<TE>   In a racing analogy, Lawson calls superbikes the NASCAR of
motorcycles--production-looking but built for competition--while
Grand Prix bikes are similar to Formula One cars, built specifically
for racing. Grand Prix is the premier event on the world platform,
with riders earning as much as $9 million a year, but, like F1, it
has not captured the attention of the American public, which focuses
on superbikes.</TE>
<TE>   Lawson has not ridden the 2.3-mile, 21-turn motorcycle course at
Fontana on a bike, but he has driven it in a car.</TE>
<TE>   "It has long straightaways with tight corners, which is great for
passing, which makes it great for spectators. And it's a track where
you can see all the way around. If the people come out, I think
they'll be amazed how much fun it is to watch a national championship
road race."</TE>
<TE>   The Yamaha Superbike Challenge, the second and third rounds of the
AMA Chevy Trucks U.S. Superbike Championship series, is the first
top-level motorcycle road race in the greater Los Angeles area since
1996 when superbikes raced at the Pomona Fairplex parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   There will be two 100-kilometer races, one Saturday at 2 p.m. and
one Sunday at 3:30. Favorites include Honda's Nicky Hayden, 20,
winner of the Daytona 200--a race Lawson won twice--and winner of the
last four superbike races; Suzuki's Mat Mladin, defending AMA
superbike champion; Kawasaki's Eric Bostrom, runner-up to Mladin last
year and defending 600 Supersport champion; and Yamaha's Anthony
Gobert, 600 Supersport runner-up last year.</TE>
<TE>   These days, their motorcycle careers over, Lawson retired and
Rainey disabled, their passion is 250-powered SuperKarts, faster than
world-class Grand Prix bikes.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't imagine what a blast it is to get up around 175 [mph]
in one of those things, with your butt an inch or less from the
pavement. And compared to race cars, they're downright cheap. You can
build a championship SuperKart for $15,000, a fraction of what guys
spend on formula cars.</TE>
<TE>   "And if speed is what they want, the SuperKarts were eight or nine
seconds a lap faster than the Busch Grand National [stock] cars at
Laguna Seca. And they're safe, as safe as you can be going that fast.
I've been around them for 10 years and only seen one guy get upside
down and he did a stupid thing. They're so light that if they spin,
they'll stop almost immediately instead of sliding down the track
hitting things the way cars behave."</TE>
<TE>   Rainey, despite his paralysis, drives a SuperKart that Lawson
hand-built and presented to his former rival.</TE>
<TE>   "Wayne's as tough in the kart as he was on a bike," Lawson said.
"I know, he beat me in a heat at the last race."</TE>
<TE>   American Speed Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Martin, Rusty Wallace and Darrell Waltrip are among drivers
who sent time racing on short tracks with the American Speed Assn.
before moving up to NASCAR's Winston Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Busch, a 16-year-old high school student from Las Vegas, is
hoping to follow the same path. Actually, racing in the ASA this year
is a bit of a detour for Busch.</TE>
<TE>   He was primed to race in NASCAR's Craftsman Truck series this year
for Jack Roush before a new NASCAR rule barred him from driving in
their touring series until his 18th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be back in the No. 99 truck May 2, 2003," Busch said. "This
year I'm in the ASA driving for Noah Yoder. It's good for me. The
competition is tough, the whole field separated by half a second, so
it'll be good experience until I get my truck ride back."</TE>
<TE>   Before NASCAR decided that someone who couldn't buy cigarettes
until he was 18 couldn't advertise them either, Busch drove in six
Craftsman races for Roush last year. He had the fastest time in
practice last November at California Speedway only to be removed from
the truck moments before qualifying when it was ruled he could not
drive in an event sponsored by Marlboro.</TE>
<TE>   Busch, younger brother of Winston Cup driver Kurt Busch, will be
in Yoder's No. 07 Ford when the ASA makes its second appearance at
Irwindale Speedway this weekend with the TireRack.com 300.</TE>
<TE>   Although his car has a Ford chassis, it is powered by a Chevrolet
Vortec engine used by every car in the series.</TE>
<TE>   "We call it a Monte Taurus," Busch said. "It's good training for
the trucks. Both run on radial tires and the ASA car weighs 3,000
pounds, which is comparable with the 3,300-pound trucks. They drive
like a Southwest Tour car, or the late models I drove at Las Vegas."</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Busch, 23, won his first Winston Cup race two weeks ago at
Bristol, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   In the ASA opener at Lakeland, Fla., Busch qualified second and
held the lead briefly until a mechanical problem cost him 10
positions while sitting in the pits getting repaired. He finished
11th.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty neat, running for Yoder. He's a Ford dealer in
Hicksville, Ohio, and has a great organization, with volunteers
working on pit stops. I spent all spring break back in Hicksville
working on the car."</TE>
<TE>   Although Sunday's 300-lap main event will be Busch's first time on
the half-mile oval, he has raced several times in legend cars on the
tiny third-mile oval inside the main track.</TE>
<TE>   Qualifying is at 4 p.m. Saturday, with the track's weekly program
to follow. The 300-lap main event, Sunday at 1, will be televised
live over TNN with former Winston Cup champion Buddy Baker doing the
commentary.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Grand Prix</TE>
<TE>   Chris Pook, founder of the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach and
newly named president of CART, will return to the seaside race next
week as grand marshal.</TE>
<TE>   "There couldn't have been a better choice," said Jim Michaelian,
who replaced Pook as president of the Grand Prix Assn. of Long Beach.
"What better time to recognize his efforts than to honor him on his
first return to Long Beach as CART president and chief executive
officer."</TE>
<TE>   Pook will take part in pre-race ceremonies on April 14.</TE>
<TE>   Last Laps</TE>
<TE>   Riverside's Everett Burns, whose son Todd won the late model main
event last week at Irwindale Speedway, will be racing in the super
stock feature Saturday night at Perris Auto Speedway, where he won
his first main event two weeks ago. Also on the busy program will be
street stocks, lightning sprint cars, California champ trucks and
cruisers.</TE>
<TE>   The speedway motorcycle season will have its annual preview on
April 13 when defending U.S. champion Chris Manchester takes on the
Costa Mesa regulars at the Orange County Fairgrounds oval. The weekly
speedway season will start May 4.</TE>
<TE>   Necrology</TE>
<TE>   Ray Brock, one of racing's biggest supporters from his days as an
editor for Hot Rod magazine to his working with Wally Parks to create
the National Hot Rod Assn., died of a heart attack last Tuesday. He
was 74. Brock also helped start the SEMA Show, one of the largest
specialty equipment trade expositions in the country, and was a
member of the SEMA Industry Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held Tuesday at 11 a.m. at the Petersen
Automotive Museum. His family requests that donations be sent to the
NHRA Motorsports Museum or the Petersen Museum.</TE>

<HD>Lenard's Leaner Helps Denver Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Denver Nuggets dropped out of the playoff picture long ago, but
they're sure shaking up the brackets.</LD>
<LD>   Voshon Lenard scored 15 points and hit a leaner with 11.2 seconds
left as the Nuggets ended the Minnesota Timberwolves' four-game
winning streak with an 88-87 victory Thursday night at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   The victory was Denver's second straight at home over a team in
playoff position. The Nuggets beat Utah, 98-90, Tuesday, and have won
seven of their last 13 games against potential playoff teams.</LD>
<TE>   "I am not surprised by our play," Lenard said. "I knew we could
win and play like this. We are starting to get to a point where
people are starting to understand and starting to feel each other. It
is too bad it is happening this late in the year."</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota, which has won six of nine, is a game ahead of Portland
for the fifth playoff spot in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Garnett had 21 points, 18 rebounds and seven assists to lead
the Timberwolves. Wally Szczerbiak added 16 points, five rebounds and
five assists.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota took an 87-83 lead after Anthony Peeler hit two
three-point baskets from the corner. Denver's George McCloud followed
with three free throws with 34 seconds left after he was fouled on a
three-point attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's Chauncey Billups was then called for a backcourt
violation after losing the ball, setting up Lenard's 16-foot shot
along the baseline. Peeler had a shot for the win, but was long from
the corner after Denver double-teamed Garnett in the post.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 88, New York 80--Rasheed Wallace scored 25 points and
Dale Davis had a season-high 18 rebounds at Portland. The Trail
Blazers officially eliminated the Knicks from playoff contention.</TE>
<TE>   The Knicks (28-46) will miss the playoffs for the first time since
the 1986-87 season, when the team finished 24-58.</TE>
<TE>   Latrell Sprewell was ejected with 3:44 left in the third quarter
for shoving Portland's Bonzi Wells.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 95, Indiana 94--Reggie Miller missed a fadeaway
three-pointer at the buzzer as the Hawks won at Atlanta, sending the
Pacers to their fifth loss in six games. Indiana, which never led,
fell into a tie with Toronto for the eighth and final Eastern
Conference playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   Pacer forward Ron Mercer missed his third consecutive game with
back spasms.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 105, Cleveland 101--Darrell Armstrong scored 11 of his 18
points in the final six minutes and Tracy McGrady had 35 points and
14 rebounds to lead the Magic at Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando rallied without starting small forward Mike Miller, who
reinjured his left ankle early in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Miller is listed as day-to-day.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 102, Houston 78--Tim Duncan had 22 points and 11
rebounds, giving him 20 or more points in 22 consecutive games, for
the Spurs at Houston. San Antonio is 15-4 in the second night of
back-to-back games, best in the league.</TE>
<TE>   Cuttino Mobley scored 24 points for the Rockets, who lost for the
eighth time in 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 76er guard Speedy Claxton will miss at least three
games because of a mild concussion.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Ricci had a goal and two assists as the Sharks took a big step
toward the first division title in franchise history, beating the
Phoenix Coyotes, 5-2, Thursday night at San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Rathje had a goal and an assist, and Teemu Selanne scored the
go-ahead goal as the Sharks (41-25-8-3, 93 points) used a decisive
second period to open a four-point lead on the surprising Coyotes
(37-25-9-6) and the Kings (37-25-11-4) atop the Pacific Division. All
three teams have five games left.</LD>
<LD>   It was the third straight victory for the Sharks, who wrap up a
six-game homestand Saturday against Detroit. San Jose needs only
three points in its final five games to improve its point total for
the sixth consecutive season.</LD>
<TE>   Though the game was likely the Sharks' most important this season,
they struggled in the first 30 minutes. But after tough guy Andrei
Nazarov scored early in the second period to put the Coyotes up, 2-1,
the Sharks answered with four consecutive goals.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 3, Philadelphia 1--At Montreal, the Canadiens moved into
the final Eastern Conference playoff position, handing the Flyers
their fifth loss in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal, winner of four consecutive games, is two points in front
of idle Washington for eighth place in the East.</TE>
<TE>   Andrei Markov had a goal and an assist and goaltender Jose
Theodore stopped 23 shots. Richard Zednik and Bill Lindsay also
scored for the Canadiens.</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 2, Boston 1--Oleg Kvasha scored at 3:29 of
overtime, but the Bruins added to their Eastern Conference lead at
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Kvasha put the puck between defenseman Hal Gill's skates near the
Boston blue line, then cut past Sean O'Donnell, who knocked him to
the ice. But as he was falling, Kvasha shot the puck between goalie
Byron Dafoe's legs.</TE>
<TE>   The Islanders, outshot 40-16, nearly won in regulation, but Glen
Murray scored with 2:16 left.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins gained one point from the overtime loss and are five
points ahead of Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   New York Rangers 4, Toronto 2--Pavel Bure scored twice, including
the go-ahead goal midway through the third period at Toronto. Bure
was standing alone at the side of the net as linemate Eric Lindros
fought off a Maple Leaf defender and fed him a loose puck. The
Russian easily put in the winner.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Barnaby added a goal as New York, badly outplayed by
Toronto most of the game and outshot, 37-24, got its third
consecutive win thanks to the solid goaltending of 18-year-old rookie
Dan Blackburn.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary 4, Minnesota 3--Jarome Iginla scored his 48th goal and
added two assists at Calgary, Canada. With five games remaining,
Iginla is nine goals ahead of Washington's Peter Bondra in the race
for the Rocket Richard Trophy as the NHL's top goal scorer.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 4, Pittsburgh 2--Dave Andreychuk scored twice at Tampa,
Fla., to reach 20 goals for the 17th time in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus 2, Nashville 1--Deron Quint scored his first goal in 19
games and Espen Knutsen had two assists at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>

<LD>It didn't take long to see that the Kings were not going to take any
nonsense from the Detroit Red Wings and their fans Thursday night at
Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   With the Kings desperately in need of a victory after going
winless over their last five games, they were the aggressors all
night in a 3-0 victory.</LD>
<LD>   Defenseman Aaron Miller, center Jason Allison and winger Kelly
Buchberger will get much of the credit for providing the scoring, and
goaltender Felix Potvin will earn his praise for recording his 24th
career shutout, but the Kings' true heroes were their penalty
killers.</LD>
<TE>   After giving up 10 power-play goals during their winless span, the
Kings did not come close to giving up one against the Red Wings. That
was important considering that the Kings' penalty-killing unit had
led the NHL for most of the season, but entered Thursday's game
eighth because of its recent stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems that everyone wants to talk about your penalty kill when
it's struggling," Miller said about the Kings, who were two for two
playing a man short against Detroit. "We were first in the league for
nearly 70 games. It doesn't always go the way you want for a lot of
different reasons but we worked on it and addressed it and it was
better tonight."</TE>
<TE>   The key to their penalty-killing unit's success on Thursday was
that the Kings, themselves, stayed out of the penalty box. That's
something they didn't do too well the last five games when they
averaged six penalties a game.</TE>
<TE>   "We had just a couple of power plays in the first period and
that's all we had," Detroit forward Igor Larionov said. "After the
first, we went 50 minutes without one, and sometimes it's tough to
get goals like that."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings certainly didn't start the game with too much
discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Over the first 10 minutes, the Red Wings found themselves with a
man-advantage twice, thanks to a Jaroslav Modry high-sticking penalty
and a hooking call on Adam Deadmarsh.</TE>
<TE>   But the King penalty killers were ready for the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Center Eric Belanger got things going when he won the first
faceoff against Detroit's Tomas Holmstrom and the Kings kept things
simple enough to frustrate the Red Wing power play.</TE>
<TE>   For Detroit's first power play, the Kings limited the Red Wings to
only one shot. They did not make any questionable passes and were in
position to back up one another when needed.</TE>
<TE>   "We [knew] that we were really that close to getting back where we
were a couple of weeks ago," winger Ian Laperriere said. "It's just
little things that we were not doing right.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been thinking that we've been working hard but we haven't
been. It's like we think it's going to come back easy because we were
so successful for much of the season. But when things don't go well,
you have to remember to go back to the basics and keep it simple."</TE>
<TE>   On the Red Wings' second power play, the Kings ended up having the
best scoring chance over the two-minute span. Again, it was Belanger
in the middle of the action.</TE>
<TE>   After picking up a loose puck in the neutral zone, Belanger skated
up ice while fighting off Detroit's Darren McCarty and barely missed
scoring against goaltender Dominik Hasek.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I had him but I couldn't lift the puck over him," said
Belanger, playing in his second game after missing nearly two months
because of a wrist injury.</TE>
<TE>   "We're happy with the way we played. We know that we're good, but
teams go through slumps during the year. Good teams find a way to
bounce back and our penalty killers did so tonight."</TE>
<TE>   It's not as if the Kings had lost confidence because of their
recent shaky play, but their effort had definitely become a concern.</TE>
<TE>   "There's never been a sense of panic in the dressing room,"
defenseman Mathieu Schneider said. "I think fatigue played a part
[with five games in nine days]."</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the Red Wings have enough talent and skill to win games
when they don't give a total effort, the Kings don't have that
luxury.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if we cruise at all, we're usually down three or four
goals," King Coach Andy Murray said before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line for us is that we've given up 19 goals over a
five-game span [before Thursday]. That's almost an average of four a
game and you can't do that in this league.</TE>
<TE>   "And, we've given up most of them on the power play, 10 of the 19.
Our defensive play and penalty killing definitely has to be better."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, it was again.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gary Sheffield is doing his best to keep up with off-season workout
partner Barry Bonds.</LD>
<LD>   Sheffield homered for the third consecutive game and Andruw Jones
and Chipper Jones homered during a seven-run sixth inning as the
Atlanta Braves defeated the Philadelphia Phillies, 11-2, Thursday
night at Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   "I couldn't have hoped for anything better, except maybe winning
all three games, but the main thing was winning the series,"
Sheffield said.</LD>
<TE>   Sheffield, acquired from the Dodgers in an off-season trade for
outfielder Brian Jordan and pitcher Odalis Perez, hit a three-run
homer in the first inning to raise his runs batted in total to seven.
After going three for five, he's batting .462 (six for 13).</TE>
<TE>   The 33-year-old outfielder credits Bonds for getting him into the
best shape of his life. Sheffield and his wife spent two months with
Bonds at the San Francisco outfielder's home during the winter,
working out each day.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been asking me for years to work out with him during the
off-season and I finally said yes," said Sheffield, who talks to
Bonds regularly by phone.</TE>
<TE>   "I never bought into it, but after he hit 73 home runs, you just
got to buy into it.</TE>
<TE>   "I had told him I was hitting 30-40 home runs without it [the
workout regimen], but he told me eventually I will need it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a motivation factor more than anything. We'd get up at 6
a.m. and work out until 2 p.m."</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Furcal and Andruw Jones singled and Sheffield hit the first
pitch he saw from Terry Adams (0-1) over the left-center field fence
for a 3-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a hanging slider. Not a good pitch. He did what he usually
does with it," said Adams, a teammate of Sheffield's last season with
the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "He's definitely relaxed out there. You can see the way he's
playing. He's happy to be in Atlanta."</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies cut it to 3-2 off Jason Marquis (1-0) on Mike
Lieberthal's RBI double in the fourth and Scott Rolen's first home
run in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves broke it open in the sixth, sending 10 batters to the
plate with seven getting hits and scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus Giles, pinch-hitter Mark DeRosa and Furcal had RBI hits
before Andruw Jones hit a two-run home run--his first--and Chipper
Jones followed with his first.</TE>
<TE>   Both home runs came off reliever Ricky Bottalico.</TE>
<TE>   Marquis went six innings. The right-hander gave up five hits, two
runs, walked three and struck out eight.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say enough about what Sheffield has done the first three
games. Hopefully it's a sign of what he will do the whole season,"
Marquis said.</TE>
<TE>   "He certainly makes every pitcher's job much easier."</TE>
<TE>   Adams, making his Phillies' debut after signing a free agent
contract during the off-season after two years with the Dodgers, gave
up eight hits, six runs, walked two and struck out six in 52/3
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta third baseman Vinny Castilla was scratched from the
starting lineup because of a sore left foot.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 3, New York 2--Kevin Young hit a two-run homer and the
Pirates moved over .500 for the first time since 1999, defeating the
Mets at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Anderson gave up three hits over 62/3 innings. He gave up a
leadoff home run to Joe McEwing in the first inning, then walked
Roberto Alomar and hit Mo Vaughn in the shoulder with a pitch. But he
got Mike Piazza to hit into a double play and retired Edgardo Alfonzo
on a grounder to third to end the threat.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 6, St. Louis 1--John Thomson worked seven strong innings
and Juan Uribe and Benny Agbayani homered for the Rockies at St.
Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson gave up a run and seven hits, striking out three and
walking none, and induced 14 pop-ups.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals scored in the first on Fernando Vina's leadoff
single, stolen base and a sacrifice fly by J.D. Drew, but didn't get
a runner past second the rest of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 1, Montreal 0--Brad Penny pitched a four-hitter and Derrek
Lee homered for the third game in a row to lead the Marlins at
Montreal, in front of a sparse crowd of 4,551.</TE>
<TE>   Penny, who struck out three and walked two in recording his second
career shutout, got Vladimir Guerrero to fly out to the warning track
in center field to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 3, Chicago 1--Sammy Sosa hit his second home run, but
Fred McGriff's error set up two Cincinnati runs and the Reds won at
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Casey doubled to start the Reds' second and McGriff let Aaron
Boone's grounder skitter through his legs, sending Casey home. Boone
scored on Jason LaRue's two-out double off the wall in left-center.</TE>

<HD>Berkman Hits Third Home Run for Astros</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Lance Berkman insists there is no agreement between him and Houston
Astro owner Drayton McLane.</LD>
<LD>   But Berkman keeps hitting home runs, just in case.</LD>
<LD>   Berkman tied a club record for homers at the start of a season
with his third in three days, leading the Astros over the Milwaukee
Brewers, 6-3, Thursday at Houston.</LD>
<TE>   Berkman's three home runs repeated what Chris Truby accomplished
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Each game, [McLane] has said if I don't hit a home run I have to
get my hair cut," Berkman said. "He thinks we have a deal, but I
never agreed to it."</TE>
<TE>   Berkman, who has let his shaggy hair grow down over his neck in
back, didn't put much emphasis on the club record. He was surprised
to learn the major league record for home runs at the start of the
season is four consecutive games, shared by Willie Mays (1971) and
Mark McGwire (1998).</TE>
<TE>   "You don't really think about a record like that," Berkman said.
"All it means is I had three home runs in three games and we have 159
games to go. If this is all I do, it will be a terrible year.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't be thinking about the major league record tomorrow, but
it would be neat to tie, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't surprise the Astros.</TE>
<TE>   "I call him Cave Man because of the long hair and he's big and
strong," winning pitcher Shane Reynolds said. "He is such a great
hitter. He could wake up and step out of bed and get a hit. He works
at the game, but he absolutely loves it and he's a great hitter."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jimy Williams likes what he sees in Berkman.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really swinging the bat well," Williams said. "He's driving
the ball and hitting with power.... He's just a very good hitter."</TE>
<TE>   The game at Astros Field drew 21,528, the smallest crowd in three
seasons at the park formerly called Enron Field. That broke the mark
set Wednesday night when 23,381 fans showed up.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds (1-0) gave up two runs and seven hits in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Jamey Wright (0-1) went 41/3 innings, giving up four runs and
seven hits, and walking six. Wright remained winless against the
Astros. He is 0-6 with a 6.71 earned-run average in 10 starts against
them.</TE>
<TE>   Berkman's RBI single started the scoring in the first. His two-run
homer in the fourth gave Houston a 3-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   A squeeze bunt by Reynolds scored Morgan Ensberg for a 4-0 lead in
the fifth, and Richard Hidalgo had a two-run single in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Ochoa hit a two-run homer for the Brewers in the seventh. It
was Ochoa's second homer of the year.</TE>

<HD>Memory of Old Cowboy Is Percival's Motivation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you need a reason to cheer for the Angels this season--and after
all the heartache, who doesn't?--look no further than the framed
jersey hanging in the middle of their clubhouse.</LD>
<LD>   The number on the back is 26.</LD>
<LD>   The name across the shoulders reads Autry.</LD>
<TE>   The reason to cheer sits directly across from that jersey,
staring, shaking his head, spitting tobacco juice into a cup, staring
again.</TE>
<TE>   "This year is our best chance to win something for him," says
reliever Troy Percival, talking about another old cowboy named Gene
Autry. "In the back of my mind, that's what it's still about."</TE>
<TE>   Reflected in the glass of that framed jersey, Percival's face is
unshaven, his hair is buzzed, his eyes are squinting.</TE>
<TE>   Reflected in the young smiles around him, it is the countenance of
an old glove.</TE>
<TE>   The kind that thwacks so sweetly each spring.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to know how lucky I am?" Percival asks. "I'd have given
my left arm to play this game. That's how lucky I am."</TE>
<TE>   It is our good fortune that for seven seasons he has played in
Anaheim, longer than any current Angel but Tim Salmon, long enough to
become baseball's best unheralded pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   More important, long enough to become its most vocal link to the
club's late, beloved founder.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Autry used to come to the clubhouse after games and have a
beer with the boys and tell stories," he recalls. "I was lucky enough
to hear some of those stories."</TE>
<TE>   Percival, 32, still keeps a small pocket knife given to him by an
Autry friend.</TE>
<TE>   "I was told the knife was a gift from Mr. Autry, because I was one
of his favorite players," Percival recalled. "I'll never forget
that."</TE>
<TE>   He never forgets any of it. He moved his locker across the room
last season simply because he wanted to dress where Chuck Finley once
dressed.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some legacies here, and I want to follow them," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there is one legacy he is trying to escape, that of being
baseball's best reliever never to appear in a playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   This season he will probably become the Angels' all-time leader in
games pitched. Yet the only games he remembers are the ones the
Angels did not play, the playoff games enjoyed by others, the empty
Octobers.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't stand to watch an entire playoff or World Series game,"
he says. "But I've never missed a Mariano Rivera appearance. I'll
watch him and think, what would that be like?"</TE>
<TE>   During the off-season, angry at the club for revealing contract
negotiations, upset at six years of futility, he was preparing for a
trade that would allow him to experience that playoff feeling
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I told my friends, well, OK, I've got to go do that," he recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Angels acquired two veteran starting pitchers, and a
starting bat, and Percival started thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "What if I could make the playoffs and never have to leave the
team that I've always loved? Are you kidding me?" he recalls.</TE>
<TE>   So, in a statement as bold as those Jolly Rancher red jerseys, he
stayed.</TE>
<TE>   He signed a two-year contract extension that provided fans with a
closing argument.</TE>
<TE>   This was not another annual Angel off-season mirage.</TE>
<TE>   This was real. They are truly trying to make the playoffs. Even in
baseball's toughest division, they absolutely have a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never seen it set up like this," Percival says.
"Everything we needed, we got. It was like the organization was
finally saying, 'It's time.'"</TE>
<TE>   Because one of baseball's most underrated torches deserves a
chance to light up an autumn night, you hope he's right.</TE>
<TE>   Because loyalty in the face of frivolity deserves to be rewarded,
you hope Troy Percival will be there.</TE>
<TE>   He's the Angel who has always wanted to be an Angel, an All-Star
who grew up in Riverside and never left home.</TE>
<TE>   For fun last winter, he and best friend Darrell Goedhart would sit
around on folding chairs in Percival's garage, shooting the breeze
while 1980s music played on the radio.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes Percival would accompany Goedhart, a former minor
leaguer turned iron worker, to a job site.</TE>
<TE>   "I go out and see how he sweats and how hard he works and it just
reminds me how fortunate I am," Percival says.</TE>
<TE>   It is this sort of blunt attitude that made him mad at the Angels
last fall, when he threatened to leave after word of contract
negotiations leaked.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most other players, he wasn't angry about the money, he was
angry about the leak.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the sort of guy who still thinks that stuff should be
private," he said. "Nobody wants to feel sorry for anybody making a
million bucks."</TE>
<TE>   Percival wanted an apology. But when president Tony Tavares
resigned, he decided that was good enough.</TE>
<TE>   It was the same straight approach that caused the much-publicized
tiff between Percival and former teammate Mo Vaughn during spring
training.</TE>
<TE>   Percival correctly said the Angels would not miss Vaughn's
leadership because Darin Erstad was their leader.</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn, now with the Mets, acted as if someone had just stolen his
last doughnut, cursing and ripping Percival in the New York media for
never appearing in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   How did Percival respond?</TE>
<TE>   "Well, if you take out all the expletives, the guy was right," he
says with a shrug. "We haven't made the playoffs. It wasn't worth
barking back at him over that."</TE>
<TE>   He knows the howling can only occur on the field, which is where
he was headed Wednesday afternoon after undergoing an MRI exam on a
painful rib.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors said that he will not be allowed to pitch until next week.
Percival shows up at the clubhouse and begins putting on his uniform
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm live!" he shouts to Manager Mike Scioscia, indicated that he
could pitch on this evening.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll talk about it," says Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm live," he shouts again, in a voice that echoes from here to
1986.</TE>

<LD>They are mere specks in what seems the middle of the ocean; barren
chunks of land amid a flat expanse of blue.</LD>
<LD>   On the surface, they're not much to look at. But anyone who has
been to Mexico's Revillagigedo Islands will say that it is what's
beneath the surface that makes them so special.</LD>
<LD>   The remote four-island archipelago, located more than 200 miles
south of Baja California and 400 miles west of the mainland, is
seasonal home to a stunning array of marine creatures. Giant Pacific
mantas soar over the reefs with power and grace. Predatory sharks
maintain a random but thorough patrol.</LD>
<TE>   Divers, many of them wielding spears, have reported swimming amid
schools of tuna and wahoo that seemed to have no end. Anglers, mostly
aboard San Diego-based vessels, say there is no better place to catch
these prized species.</TE>
<TE>   But these have long been troubled waters. Over and over the mantas
have been harpooned, the sharks butchered by poachers. And now, amid
more of this plunder, and amid claims by spear-fishermen that sport
fishermen are taking too much tuna and wahoo, these barren specs in
the ocean appear to have become even more isolated.</TE>
<TE>   With no advance warning, Mexico last week invalidated sportfishing
permits and announced that all consumptive recreation would cease.
The action was taken by the Attorney General for the Protection of
the Environment, or PROFEPA, only days after a visit to the islands
by the high-ranking Secretary of Government, Santiago Creel Miranda.</TE>
<TE>   Creel has the law on his side--sort of. The islands have been
protected since 1994, when the Revillagigedo Archipelago Biosphere
Reserve was established. Commercial fishing was banned immediately
within 12 miles, but sportfishing and spear fishing, with
restrictions, was allowed to continue until the completion of a
management plan that would spell out any such special uses.</TE>
<TE>   That plan was supposed to have been completed within a year, but
eight years later there still is no plan, only confusion.</TE>
<TE>   Various branches of government have continued to authorize and
issue permits that allow fishing beyond 547 yards (500 meters) of the
islands for migratory species such as tuna and wahoo. But now the
policing and enforcement branches (PROFEPA and the Secretariat of the
Navy) are interpreting the law to mean that no fishing should take
place unless specified in a management plan.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is more complex, but basically it's a catch-22 situation
that has forced the San Diego long-range fleet to seek other
options--while arguing to have this one restored.</TE>
<TE>   In an article published Monday in the on-line forum
www.hispanicvista.com, fleet consultant Barnard Thompson called
Creel's announcement "a huge overreaction" to a poaching incident he
witnessed during his visit to the islands three weeks ago. That trip
was made soon after meetings in Mexico between President Bush and
Mexican President Vicente Fox, intended to improve ties between the
nations.</TE>
<TE>   "Mexican officials are showing a darker side that could give pause
to any entrepreneur and/or developer who might have an investment
interest in that country," Thompson wrote.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego's fleet has been fishing the islands for about 30 years,
exclusively targeting tuna and wahoo. Ten of its vessels are annually
issued permits for a five-month season ending in late May. Only eight
used the permits last season.</TE>
<TE>   These are specialized trips costing $3,000 or more per person,
lasting nearly two weeks. Many are shorter "fly-down, fly-back"
trips, with pickups and drop-offs in Cabo San Lucas.</TE>
<TE>   All told, Thompson wrote, the trips annually contribute $2.9
million directly to the Mexican economy, "to say nothing of indirect
spending and benefits received by Mexico through promotions and
advertising."</TE>
<TE>   Some in Mexico have contended for years that the Revillagigedo
Island fishery belongs to Mexico and should not be utilized for
profit by U.S. interests, despite the contributions Thompson refers
to. If these sentiments influenced PROFEPA, so, too, did events that
occurred during Creel's trip.</TE>
<TE>   The visit coincided with that of the environmental watchdog group
Sea Watch. Those on the Sea Watch vessel, including veteran
breath-hold "free divers," encountered commercial fishermen
retrieving long-line gear two miles north of San Benedicto Island,
the northernmost of the four. Footage of the poachers hauling dead
sharks over the rail--an estimated 250 to 350--was presented to
Creel. It aired the next night on Mexican television, along with
interviews with the official, who pledged more protection within the
reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Sea Watch founder Mike McGettigan also presented Creel with a
"state of the fisheries" report citing substantial declines over the
past 30 years, due mostly to commercial fishing practices but also to
those of the San Diego sportfishing fleet.</TE>
<TE>   The report suggested more restrictive bag limits for sport
fishermen and that trolling should be banned to lessen the danger to
giant mantas and whale sharks. It did not recommend the elimination
of spear-fishing or sportfishing. Its findings are purely anecdotal,
devoid of scientific evidence and based solely on observations of
free divers and photographers.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is what I see," said Terry Maas, a world-renowned
spear fisherman from Ventura, who was with McGettigan during his
meeting with Creel.</TE>
<TE>   "I've probably been to the islands 40 times since 1983 and sharks,
tuna, wahoo ... all are down by about 80%. I used to see schools of
wahoo that went beyond the field of sight."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Fletcher, president of the Sportfishing Assn. of California,
called the report baseless and labeled McGettigan a "loose cannon"
who is doing more harm than good.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Ekstrom, owner-operator of the Royal Star, said, "To base
these conclusions on the observations of a handful of divers is
beyond ludicrous. But even more ludicrous is that anyone would put
stock in such a report."</TE>
<TE>   The per-angler bag-limit before the closure was 15 tuna and 15
wahoo per trip. "But the reality is, our boats won't even hold that
many fish," Ekstrom said. His log book, typical of those turned in by
the other seven captains, revealed an average angler catch last
season of seven tuna (averaging 90-120 pounds) and six wahoo (25-40
pounds) per trip.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are taking home 700 pounds of tuna, but our impact on
the fishery is nil," Ekstrom said.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Allen, director of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission, said that while it's possible that sportfishing small
areas "might affect the local abundance" during a given time,
"generally speaking it won't have an impact on the fishery."</TE>
<TE>   He added that yellowfin tuna stocks in the Eastern Pacific were
deemed healthy enough last year to sustain a record quota of 310,000
metric tons. Wahoo are not managed by the IATTC.</TE>
<TE>   McGettigan stands by his group's efforts, saying, "Sea Watch is
against anything that depletes the biosphere's stocks of pelagic and
reef fish." That he and many of his supporters are spear fishermen
may make them look like hypocrites, but it is widely accepted that
such a selective and small-scale effort has even less of an impact on
the resource than sportfishing.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, both of these groups have been ordered out. Which
begs an important question: Who's going to keep an eye on the
poachers?</TE>
<TE>   Creel may have vowed greater protection, but the remoteness of the
islands and the fact that they're so spread out makes them all but
impossible to effectively patrol. "And don't think the poachers don't
know that," Ekstrom said.</TE>
<TE>   News and Notes</TE>
<TE>   * Ultra-long-range: Some captains have turned their attention even
farther south to French-owned Clipperton Island, 780 miles south of
Cabo San Lucas and 600 miles west of Nicaragua. Ekstrom made the
journey in mid-March and his passengers enjoyed phenomenal tuna
fishing, with three of the fish topping 200 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   These are somewhat risky trips, though. Fishing is not always so
good, the heat can be unbearable and the sharks relentless.</TE>
<TE>   * In the pink: Last Saturday's salmon opener was fair in the
Ventura-Santa Barbara area, with fish to 35 pounds caught as far
south as Santa Monica Bay. This week, the fish are still plentiful,
but scattered and deep, with trollers using big spoons and releasable
three-pound weights doing best. The fleets are hopeful that baitfish
will school up along the coast, resulting in a greater concentration
of salmon.</TE>
<TE>   * On tap: The annual End of Trail World Championship of Cowboy
Action Shooting and Wild West Jubilee is April 17-21 at Raahauge's
Ranch in Norco. Details: (714) 694-1808 or www.sassnet.com.... The

<TE>   Among competitors in the upcoming Citgo Bassmasters tour event at
Lake Guntersville in Alabama is Real Andrews, who plays Lt. Taggert

<TE>   Says Andrews: "This has been a dream of mine for as long as I can
remember. It might sound [like a] cliche, but I literally eat, sleep
and dream fishing."</TE>

<LD>DeAngelo Collins of Inglewood High scored 15 points, including a late
three-pointer from beyond the NBA three-point line, but it wasn't
nearly enough for the West as the East ran away with a 138-107
victory Thursday in the McDonald's All-American boys' basketball game
in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Hassan Adams of Westchester scored 13 points and Evan Burns of
Fairfax added 11 for the West, which suffered the most lopsided
defeat in the 25-year history of the game. Collins and Adams each
made only six of 15 shots from the floor for the West, which trailed,
35-18, after the first quarter and never mounted a serious challenge.</LD>
<LD>   In the inaugural girls' game, Tye'sha Fluker of Pasadena Muir had
seven points and 10 rebounds to lead five Southern California players
as the West defeated the East, 94-85. Willnett Crockett of Harbor
City Narbonne added six points and 11 rebounds.</LD>

start of the season to lead La Puente Bishop Amat High to a 6-2
victory over Westminster La Quinta in the championship baseball game
of the Toyo Tires National Classic on Thursday at Cal State
Fullerton.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second consecutive National Classic title for Bishop
Amat (13-2), the No. 2-ranked team in the region by The Times.</LD>
<LD>   Hidalgo, a senior right-hander, struck out the side in the first
and third innings. He worked out of jams in the fourth and fifth to
help the Lancers hold off No. 5-ranked La Quinta (15-2).</LD>
<TE>   Adam Simon went three for three with a double, scored two runs and
drove in one for Bishop Amat, which scored in each of the first three
innings and led, 5-1, entering the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   La Quinta had runners on second and third base with two outs in
the fourth, but Hidalgo induced Charlie Cortez to ground out to end
the threat.</TE>
<TE>   Hidalgo, who walked two, worked out of a bases-loaded, no-out jam
in the fifth after Cam Blanchard's single had cut La Quinta's deficit
to 5-2.</TE>
<TE>   Hidalgo got Ian Kennedy to ground the ball to third baseman Raul
Ramirez, who threw home for the forceout. Catcher Jordan Swaydan then
threw to first base in time to double up Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   Ian Stewart then popped out to shallow center field to end the
inning.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Lange had two hits, scored a run, and drove in a run for

<LD>The girls' swim team at Riverside Poly High is sailing toward another
league title, making good on a spring ritual as honored as the annual
Riverside Orange Blossom Festival.</LD>
<LD>   The Bears have not only won the league championship every year
since 1975, but have gone undefeated in the process. Coach Gwen
Ritzau, who graduated from Poly the year it began the streak, said
the Bears have benefited from a strong grass-roots effort in the
area.</LD>
<LD>   "We have lots of good little feeder programs," she said. "Most of
the kids have some swimming experience by the time they get here."
Poly has already passed through the heart of its Ivy League schedule
this season, leaving plenty of time to prepare for the Southern
Section Division II finals next month. It's one championship that has
eluded the Bears, but Ritzau believes their chances this season are
good.</LD>
<TE>   "This is one of the best teams I've had," said Ritzau, who began
coaching the Bears in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Poly features a blend of experienced competitors and eager
newcomers, as well as two members of the Riverside AQuettes, a
nationally recognized synchronized swim team that draws members from
throughout North America.</TE>
<TE>   Poly's most recognizable swimmer is Auburn-bound senior Jeri Moss,
a member of the powerful Irvine Novaquatic swim team and a 2000
Olympic trials participant.</TE>
<TE>   Moss, the 1997 Junior National champion in the 200 backstroke, has
already gone 24.83 in the 50 freestyle this season, 53.83 in the 100
freestyle, 58.69 in the 100 backstroke and 57.83 in the 100
butterfly.</TE>
<TE>   She's expected to be a key part of the 200- and 400-freestyle
relay teams that have a good chance to win titles at the section
finals next month.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's possible for us to get a couple firsts in individual
events as well," Moss said. "We can place in the top three [in the
team competition] and maybe even win if everyone can pull out their
personal bests."</TE>
<TE>   Moss finished second in the 100 backstroke last season at the
section finals, third in the 100 butterfly and helped the 200
freestyle relay team finish second. That relay also included Katie
Kishino, Amy Bickel and Monique Blanchard, each of whom returned this
season.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears have also welcomed back Pacific-bound senior Laura
McDonald, who missed last season because of injury but won a section
title in the 500 freestyle as a freshman. McDonald, another member of
the Novaquatics, is also expected to be a key addition to both
freestyle relay teams.</TE>
<TE>   "We're feeling pretty strong," Ritzau said. "We're looking forward
to the 200- and 400-[freestyle] relays. They should be pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Painful Injection</TE>
<TE>   Moss is eager to perform well at the section finals after missing
the Phillips 66 Spring National Championships last month in
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Moss decided to scratch from the meet at the last moment after
mistakenly receiving an allergy shot that contained a substance
banned by USA Swimming.</TE>
<TE>   Moss didn't realize the mistake until hours before leaving for
Minneapolis, when one of her coaches noticed a Band-Aid on her arm
and asked what it was from. When Moss said it was from an allergy
shot that morning, she was told that she'd better find out exactly
what type of medication it contained.</TE>
<TE>   "I was devastated," said Moss, who was entered in the 100 and 200
backstroke and 50 and 200 freestyle. "But it was my fault, I should
have asked what was in [the shot]."</TE>
<TE>   Getting Closer</TE>
<TE>   Tustin senior Michael Cavic appears ready to make good on his
promise to become the second swimmer to break 20 seconds in the 50
freestyle in a high school meet.</TE>
<TE>   Cavic won the event Saturday in 19.63 at the Junior National
Swimming Championships in Long Beach. It was the first time Cavic has
swam under 20 seconds in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Cavic, a 2000 Olympian for Yugoslavia, hopes to break the national
high school record of 19.91, set by Houston Memorial's Anthony
Robinson in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Because Saturday's meet only included club teams, Cavic's time
does not count as a record.</TE>
<TE>   Added Edge</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Barbara girls' team expected to be strong with the
return of its entire team that went undefeated in the Channel League
last season, won the Santa Barbara County Championships and finished
11th in Southern Section Division I.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dons have been given an extra boost from freshman Haley
Wilson, who has already qualified for the section finals in six
events, including a 54.13 effort in the 100 freestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Hart Warming</TE>
<TE>   The Newhall Hart girls' swim team is three wins away from 100
consecutive league wins and boys' swimmer David Deloria recently
became the first swimmer in Hart history to be on all its top 10
lists.</TE>
<TE>   Note: Because most high school teams did not compete over spring
break, Times rankings will resume next week. For a listing of top

<HD>Clothes Call Good for LPGA</HD>

<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Annika Sorenstam wore ruby-red slippers last weekend, golf shoes that
seemed created for Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz." Sorenstam clicked
those heels and won the LPGA's first major of the season, the Kraft
Nabisco Championship.</LD>
<LD>   Everybody noticed Sorenstam's shoes. They glittered on the TV set.
The sun bounced off them and the shoes sparkled. Sorenstam seemed
surprised at the notice her shoes had received. She is, after all, in
the prime of her athletic career, 31 years old and winner of 10
tournaments in the last two seasons, winner of this year's first
major, biggest name at this week's Office Depot Championship at El
Caballero Country Club in Tarzana.</LD>
<LD>   And hardly anybody pays attention to Sorenstam and her golf. But
the shoes? Those were cool.</LD>
<TE>   The timing of Sorenstam's red shoe victory couldn't have been
better for the LPGA. There is a big deal being made of a new
initiative by the women's golf tour urging its players to pay as much
attention to clothes and hair and appearance and personality as to
their performance.</TE>
<TE>   In a world that will never exist, an athlete--male or
female--would be adored, revered, admired, appreciated for only his
or her performance on the field.</TE>
<TE>   We aren't in that world. It matters how we look, act and perform.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Nicklaus was once an overweight, double-chinned golfer who
wore bad clothes and a bad crew cut. He was a winner too, but not
very popular. Not with the fans, not with the sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   Then Nicklaus lost weight. He grew his hair. He was still a
winner, but he was also popular, a worldwide star, a gallery draw.</TE>
<TE>   If Tiger Woods weighed 250 pounds, if Woods looked more like Craig
Stadler or had the grumpy personality of Colin Montgomerie, would he
still be an international icon?</TE>
<TE>   Woods has a body for clothes, a smile for photos, a swing for the
ages, the ethnicity for the 21st century. And he wins. It's a
package, all of it, in perfect confluence.</TE>
<TE>   The LPGA is right to be concerned about the packaging of its
product.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Lopez was once Tiger Woods. She charmed the country two
decades ago with a sweet smile and a wicked golf swing. She came from
an unprivileged background and she never let it hold her back. She
did not have the body of a model or the skin color of the majority,
but it didn't matter. Lopez made fans smile, made them happy to be in
her gallery. And she won. It was a package.</TE>
<TE>   No female golfer has become a household name in the U.S. since
Lopez. And that's not because there is inherent bias against female
athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis has had Steffi Graf and Jennifer Capriati (then and now),
Anna Kournikova, Venus and Serena Williams and Martina Hingis. All of
them have been marketable and popular in very different ways.</TE>
<TE>   Women's soccer produced Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain. Women's
basketball has Rebecca Lobo and Chamique Holdsclaw. Dr. Dot
Richardson became famous because of softball and not her medical
degree and she was never anything but a jock, never dressed up in
fancy clothes or made up with fancy cosmetics.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam hasn't caught on, not because she isn't somehow
attractive enough. But because she's boring.</TE>
<TE>   Harsh?</TE>
<TE>   Ask Pete Sampras. Until now, when he's over 30 and considered a
has-been, and therefore an underdog and someone to be rooted for out
of pity as much as appreciation, Sampras was Sorenstam.</TE>
<TE>   He was fabulously talented, unfailingly polite, overwhelmingly
dominant and mostly ignored. Sampras would privately fret about why
he wasn't on a Sports Illustrated cover or the lead story on
"SportsCenter" after another record-setting win. Why, he would
wonder, isn't being a winner enough?</TE>
<TE>   Because it's not. It just isn't.</TE>
<TE>   When the female golfers and tour officials met and decided that it
is no sin for golfers to wear a little makeup, some nice clothes, a
friendly smile, to be willing to sign autographs and share with the
public some of themselves, some of their feelings and more of their
private thoughts, this was a good idea.</TE>
<TE>   If it seems somehow anti-feminist to worry about looks or
personality rather than athletic performance alone, it's not.</TE>
<TE>   Talking long and loud about the unfairness of it all, claiming
that men don't have to worry about such things, that no one expects
Woods to do anything but hit a ball or Kevin Brown to do anything but
pitch a ball or Shaquille O'Neal to do anything but dunk a ball, is
both a waste of time and wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a report in a London tabloid that Adidas was ordering
Kournikova to start winning tournaments or it would end its marketing
relationship with its winless tennis star, nothing of that sort is
going to happen.</TE>
<TE>   Adidas spokespeople couldn't yell loudly or quickly enough that
the athletic apparel company has no intention of dropping Kournikova.</TE>
<TE>   Because if it did, Nike would be on the phone in a minute and
offering Kournikova a prominent spot on its campus.</TE>
<TE>   That's how it works.</TE>
<TE>   Last Sunday's Kraft Nabisco broadcast got the highest TV rating
for the event since 1994 and had an 83% improvement over a year ago.
Was it Sorenstam's red shoes? Was it the buzz about athletes trying
to become fan friendly? We all do what's needed to survive. Women's
golf wants to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it takes, looking good, looking fans in the eye, making
them look back, do it.</TE>

<LD>Jay Leno hasn't called. Neither has David Letterman.</LD>
<LD>   If only they knew what they were missing for not booking teenage
swimming sensation Aaron Peirsol, America's newest world-record
holder.</LD>
<LD>   He's 18, tall and fit, humble and witty. And what a story he could
tell on the greeting he received when he returned to Newport Harbor
High last week after setting a world record (1 minute 55.15 seconds)
in the 200-meter backstroke at the Phillips 66 spring nationals in
Minneapolis on March 20.</LD>
<TE>   Friends hugged him, teachers hailed him and the school parking
police nailed him.</TE>
<TE>   "They gave me two tickets in two days," he said. "How ridiculous
is that?"</TE>
<TE>   Peirsol isn't complaining too loudly. He doesn't want to be
treated any differently than his fellow students even though he won a
silver medal at the 2000 Sydney Games and is spending his spring
break competing this week at the World Championships in Moscow. He
finished second Thursday in the 100 backstroke (51.71) to Australia's
Matt Welsh (51.26).</TE>
<TE>   "I've had my share of assemblies when I came back from Sydney," he
said. "I like coming back and not making a huge deal like a parade."</TE>
<TE>   Except Peirsol's world record puts him in rare company. Even rarer
is for an athlete to become the best in the world as a high school
senior.</TE>
<TE>   "It is pretty cool," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Back home in Irvine, his parents are still adjusting to Peirsol's
extraordinary achievement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very strange," his stepfather, Tim Hartig, said. "What do
you do for a kid who comes home like that? It's hard to relate. He's
such a humble kid and good kid. Our house has always been low key,
not get too high or too low. But everybody goes around the house with
a grin on their face."</TE>
<TE>   Peirsol is 6 feet 4, 180 pounds. He finished second to Lenny
Krayzelburg in the 200 backstroke in Sydney and had been gearing up
to make a run at the world record. It was Krayzelburg's record of
1:55.87 that Peirsol broke in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been building up to this," he said. "It wasn't a complete
shock."</TE>
<TE>   He has risen to the top of his sport but still enjoys walking
around his neighborhood without being mobbed by autograph seekers.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the fact I'm not a basketball player or football player
and get pulled over in the street," he said. "I think I know where
I'm at. I'm still a young punk. I'm not a veteran of the sport....
I'm enjoying the ride and soaking everything up."</TE>
<TE>   He has signed to swim for the University of Texas next season and
still competes for Newport Harbor's swim team when he's not
traveling. Representing his high school and swimming with his friends
is something he wouldn't give up.</TE>
<TE>   "It does humble me," he said. "It reminds me why we're in sports.
They get in there to have fun."</TE>
<TE>   Now, if only the Newport Harbor parking enforcement people could
be a little more courteous. Peirsol keeps getting punished for
parking in the senior lot without a pass.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same bitter policeman every time," he said. "I'm a
senior. There's a million spots in the back and no one's parking
there."</TE>
<TE>   Boy, would Leno have a field day talking to Peirsol.</TE>

<HD>High Cost of Re-Signing Costas</HD>

<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Costas got a sweet new deal from HBO this week, but not without
some fallout.</LD>
<LD>   With Costas moving into a co-host role on "Inside the NFL,"
something had to give. Gone are long-time co-hosts Len Dawson and
Nick Buoniconti, along with analyst Jerry Glanville.</LD>
<LD>   HBO President Ross Greenburg said letting those three go was the
hardest part of the Costas deal.</LD>
<TE>   But that's not the only problem. A role on "Inside the NFL" is
something 14-year HBO incumbent Jim Lampley had been seeking.</TE>
<TE>   "It's smart to be moving toward a more aggressive editorial style
for the show," Lampley said Thursday. "It's something I suggested a
number of times over the last 14 years."</TE>
<TE>   Lampley figured he might be involved if a change was made, but
that was not the case.</TE>
<TE>   "They just never did it for me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Bernstein, the executive producer of HBO Sports, said:
"There's never been any question of Jim's credentials or potential to
host any show for HBO. He's the anchor of our boxing series, the
highest-rated sports programs that we put on the air, and we value a
great deal everything he brings to our production."</TE>
<TE>   Word initially was that Lampley was upset and he was going to meet
next week with George Greenberg, the executive vice president of
production for Fox Sports Net, about making a move.</TE>
<TE>   Lampley said that was not the case. He said he would be meeting
with Greenberg, a longtime friend, but only to discuss the
possibility of selling a documentary about a Pennsylvania high school
football coach that Lampley's production company has made.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be some time from now before I consider doing anything
different than what I'm doing now," he said. "There's no story
there."</TE>
<TE>   But Lampley was perplexed that his good friend James Brown will be
bumped as the host of HBO's four biggest pay-per-view fights to make
room for Costas as host. Boxing is not a sport Costas has been
associated with.</TE>
<TE>   Brown wasn't ranting when contacted Thursday. But he did say he
was surprised a few months ago to hear that Bryant Gumbel or Costas
might be the host of the June 8 fight between Lennox Lewis and Mike
Tyson at Memphis, Tenn., which probably will be a joint production
between HBO and Showtime.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said he called Greenburg at the time and was assured
everything was fine, that he would be the host.</TE>
<TE>   "So I was a little surprised this week to read that Bob would be
the host of that fight," Brown said. "But if that's what it took to
land a major talent like Bob, then that's fine by me. I'm sure room
for my talents will be made."</TE>
<TE>   Brown thought at least he would be the host of the Fernando
Vargas-Oscar De La Hoya fight May 4, but with Thursday's
postponement, that is up in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Brown still could end up as the host of the Lewis-Tyson fight.
It's the same day as the Belmont Stakes on NBC, and if a horse is
going for the Triple Crown, Costas said he may instead opt to serve
as the host of NBC's coverage. Or he might work both events if
logistically possible.</TE>
<TE>   Costas' Next Step</TE>
<TE>   Costas' new three-year contract with HBO, which reportedly will
pay him about $2 million a year, calls for him to continue as the
host of "On the Record" and be involved in a number of other
projects. But the re-signing only took care of the cable element.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cable exclusive, but the broadcasting part of the jigsaw
puzzle is wide open," Costas said. "It might be NBC. It might not be
NBC."</TE>
<TE>   Costas has at least one other option.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be a fool if there wasn't another option," he said. "If NBC
was the only option and I walked around saying, 'You know maybe I
don't feel like it,' I'd be thrown out of the negotiators' union, if
there is such a thing."</TE>
<TE>   With no apparent position available for Costas at CBS or Fox, ABC
seems the most logical place. Costas' duties there might include
serving as host of ABC's NBA coverage, which includes only 15
regular-season games and the Finals.</TE>
<TE>   There also has been speculation that Costas could sign with ABC
and still host the Olympics for NBC.</TE>
<TE>   What About Baseball?</TE>
<TE>   ABC does not have Major League Baseball, and there was a time that
baseball play-by-play would be a top lure for Costas. That's not the
case anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "If the circumstances were exactly right, I know I would enjoy
doing baseball play-by-play again," he said. "But it is not something
that drives any deal at this point. If I have a chance to do it and
it's the right circumstance then I will. But I don't see myself doing
it in the near future."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if his interest in baseball has waned, Costas said: "Do I
still like it and do I still enjoy doing it? Absolutely. [But] I
think anyone who really cares about the game and is at all aware of
its present circumstances, has to feel ambivalently about it. And I
do.... I don't embrace it 100% like I used to."</TE>
<TE>   Gearing Up</TE>
<TE>   Chris Pook, the president and CEO of CART and the founder of the
Long Beach Grand Prix, this week called the recent television
coverage of the race "a disaster."</TE>
<TE>   "The product people saw in person and the product people saw in
their homes were two different products," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Speed Channel and Fox have replaced ESPN and ABC as the
carriers of the Long Beach Grand Prix and its qualifying and
companion races, which will be held April 12-14.</TE>
<TE>   The broadcast team includes Tommy Kendall, a UCLA graduate from La
Canada who dominated Trans-Am racing a few years back. As a
commentator, he's sort of the Johnny Miller of CART racing.</TE>
<TE>   "I just try to be honest and straightforward," he says. "It seems
like a simple formula."</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Miller this week signed a new multiyear contract with NBC....
NASCAR Winston Cup racing returns to Fox Sunday at 10:30 a.m. with
the Texas 500. Fox received six Emmy nominations for its first year
of NASCAR coverage.... Fox Sports Net's "Southern California Sports
Report" has moved into its new studio at Staples Center.... Fox
Sports Net will carry the John Wooden Award show from the Los Angeles

<HD>Drug Busts Gone Bad, Then Worse</HD>
<DH>Crime: Dallas is hit by claims of planted, fake cocaine and corrupt
cops and informants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DALLAS
</DL>
<LD>The bogus drug busts are notorious: Mexican immigrants were jailed,
went broke or got deported, only to have the evidence against them fall
apart. The bricks of white powder they were charged with peddling turned
out to be plaster of Paris--not cocaine or speed, as police had claimed.
In all, more than 70 arrests have come unstrung this winter in a very
public crescendo of bad cop work and shoddy prosecution.</LD>
<LD>   Now Dallas is in an uproar. Federal investigators are probing the
police department. Scores of drug prosecutions have been dismissed. Two
narcotics detectives have been suspended. And a scandal that started in
the dingy streets on the outskirts of town has worked its way into the
city's political machinery.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like watching a slow train wreck," said Paul Coggins, former
U.S. attorney for the northern district of Texas. "We may never know
exactly what happened."</LD>
<TE>   If truth can be gleaned at all, it will be extracted from a tangled
constellation of cops, drug pushers and immigrants. The informants blame
crooked detectives. The detectives blame corrupt tipsters and drug
dealers who, they say, were trying to rip off their clients with
worthless products. The onetime suspected drug dealers--who are expected
to file a bevy of civil rights lawsuits against the city--blame a vast,
racist conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Luis Vega was beneath the belly of an old car the day police
swarmed into the garage where he worked. It was a sticky afternoon in
August, and Vega--a 35-year-old from Mexico who doesn't speak
English--had just finished lunch. Before he could figure out why
uniformed officers were rushing into Samuel's Transmission Shop, his
wrists were cuffed and he was squeezed into the back seat of a police
cruiser.</TE>
<TE>   "What did I do?" he called in Spanish to a passing officer who looked
to be Latino.</TE>
<TE>   "You know already," came the reply. While curious neighbors craned
their necks, Vega was taken away. Charged with intent to deliver cocaine,
he didn't walk out of jail until October, when the 56 pounds of powder
seized during his arrest turned out to be plasterboard. With her husband
behind bars, 28-year-old Adriana Vega peddled homemade tacos and menudo
on the sidewalks of Dallas to pay the bills. "You can't imagine the
anguish," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia Barbare, a hometown defense lawyer who roams the halls of
justice with a Yorkshire terrier tucked under one arm, has seen plenty of
drug pushers. But Vega didn't seem the type: He bore the rugged face and
greasy nails of a man who works for a living. The Vegas share a cramped
bungalow in Oak Cliff, a neighborhood of Laundromats, chain-link fences
and vacant lots across the muddy Trinity River from downtown Dallas. He
drove an old pickup and put in long hours at the garage.</TE>
<TE>   The mechanic and his wife struck Barbare as honest, but it was more
than that. The whole bust was peculiar: Who would leave $1 million worth
of cocaine in a broken-down--and unlocked--Cadillac on the lawn of an old
garage? If Vega were a dealer, where was his cash? Why wasn't he packing
a gun? Moreover, Barbare didn't understand why investigators swept in and
arrested Vega without questioning him--he didn't own the shop or the car.
And after all that, no federal authorities had been notified of the large
cocaine seizure.</TE>
<TE>   "There were red flags everywhere," Barbare said. "If you've got drugs
in that volume, you want to get at the source. The first thing you're
going to do is interrogate. The second thing you're going to do is call
the feds. That wasn't happening."</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer sent the alleged cocaine to a laboratory for testing and
hooked Vega up to a private polygraph machine. That, it turned out, was
the big break. As the polygraph operator listened to Vega's responses, he
turned to Barbare with a frown.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to believe this," the operator told the lawyer, "but
I just did a case for [another Dallas defense attorney] that sounded
exactly like this."</TE>
<TE>   That was how Barbare began to string the rotten busts together. The
polygraph operator was right: The details in the second case were
uncomfortably similar. The suspect: a Mexican immigrant. The place: a
mechanic shop. The drug: cocaine--lots of it. The arresting detectives:
Mark Delapaz and Eddie Herrera, the same duo that put Vega behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew right then," Barbare said, "there's a conspiracy here."</TE>
<TE>   The day the laboratory results came back, yet another Mexican family
trudged into Barbare's office. A mechanic named Abel Santos was stuck in
jail, they explained. The police said he had been selling cocaine out of
his neighborhood auto shop. He had been arrested by a pair of detectives
who quickly were becoming familiar to Barbare: Delapaz and Herrera.</TE>
<TE>   It was a setup, the family insisted. Somebody had planted cocaine in
an abandoned car at the garage, they said, and Santos had been framed.</TE>
<TE>   Barbare and Tony Wright, the other lawyer, spread the word in the
courthouse corridors: There's phony dope out there. Get the laboratory
tests. Don't plead out.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, it was too late. For months, nobody had questioned the
authenticity of the drugs or the integrity of the arrests. Some of the
mechanics and day laborers who languished in jail, unable to make bond,
claimed they had been framed. But such complaints are common. Some of the
court-appointed lawyers urged the suspected drug dealers to plead guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Look, what do you think the jury will think when it's your
word against a police officer?' " said Bill Stovall, whose client pleaded
guilty--and was deported--because he didn't want to risk 15 years in
prison with a trial. "He said, 'I'd rather be free in Mexico.' "</TE>
<TE>   By the time winter blew down off the Oklahoma plains, the cases were
falling apart at an alarming rate. On New Year's Eve, as scandal
percolated, Police Chief Terrell Bolton called a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   The day Bolton faced reporters, 16 drug cases had been thrown out, and
scores more were soon to follow. Bolton admitted his detectives had paid
a top informant hundreds of thousands of dollars for tips that ended up
leading to phony drugs. But Bolton argued that the detectives should be
congratulated for saving unwitting junkies from poisoning themselves with
fake dope. "Let this be a warning: You don't know what you're getting out
there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   By mid-January, 30 more cases had been dismissed and activists were
holding vigils outside police headquarters. What had started out as a
peculiar plague of fake dope had grown into a federal probe--and a
festering political problem.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Laura Miller called for an explanation. In the midst of his
campaign for reelection, Dist. Atty. Bill Hill is fending off accusations
that his prosecutors overlooked the faulty cases for months.</TE>
<TE>   Delapaz and Herrera have been suspended with pay since late fall.
Their lawyers say the partners are good detectives who either were led
astray by greedy informants or duped by crooked dope peddlers. Under
Texas law, they point out, a dealer can be prosecuted for selling any
substance he believes is an illegal drug, even if he's mistaken.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good cop and he always has been," said Bob Gorsky, who
represents Delapaz. "We think his name will be cleared, and he'll be back
to work."</TE>
<TE>   "They've been [dragged] through the mud," added Bob Baskett, a lawyer
for the Dallas Police Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The time-honored police practice of buying tips is a risky, and
high-rolling, proposition. In 2001, Dallas detectives poured about
$500,000 into the pockets of tipsters for information leading to the
arrest of drug dealers.</TE>
<TE>   That sum was double what they had paid in 2000, but it was considered
cash well spent until the arrests started to sour. What was touted as the
biggest cocaine seizure in Dallas County history turned out to be a
mother lode of ordinary gypsum powder. In the last few months,
prosecutors have tested the evidence, reviewed arrest records and thrown
out half of last year's cocaine busts.</TE>
<TE>   The informant linked to tainted case after tainted case--the one
Delapaz and Herrera worked with most--is a Mexican immigrant, like most
of the suspects he helped arrest. In total, he has pocketed more than
$200,000 for drug tips. That's $50,000 more than Chief Bolton earned last
year. It's four times what the two detectives took home.</TE>
<TE>   "When I heard that, my eyebrows shot up," former U.S. Atty. Coggins
said. "Unless they handed over Pablo Escobar, you've got to wonder. It
defies logic that an informant would get that much money."</TE>
<TE>   But if you ask Glenn White, informants never got their hands on the
cash. White represents a Mexican bartender whose signature appears on
some of the tip receipts submitted by detectives in connection with dirty
busts. But there's one hitch: White's client says that he had nothing to
do with the arrests and that his signature was forged.</TE>
<TE>   "They used him as a patsy or red herring to dilute their money trail,"
White said. "It's horrifying to think about these people strutting around
the streets in their shiny boots and guns, and maybe they're dirtier than
the people they're supposed to protect us from."</TE>
<TE>   Since the bogus arrests came to light, the department's policies have
been revamped. From now on, Bolton promised the City Council, all
suspected narcotics will be shipped to a laboratory for analysis. "We
will do whatever it takes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, suspects were jailed, indicted and encouraged to enter
pleas, even when the "drugs," as in these cases, had only been identified
by field test, a notoriously flawed chemical experiment done by
detectives at the time of arrest. Those days are over. The new laboratory
examinations are expected to cost Dallas an extra $1 million next year.</TE>
<TE>   But that's nothing next to the sum the city could lose in civil
litigation. Because one thing is clear: Somebody made money at the
expense of people who didn't speak English, couldn't pay lawyers' fees
and didn't quite know their rights. In other words, people who were
unlikely to fight back.</TE>
<TE>   "They preyed on ignorance and the inability to maneuver in the
system," said Adrian Rodriguez, district director of the League of United
Latin American Citizens. "They picked on easy targets, and they knew what
they were doing."</TE>

<HD>Rules in Mideast's Wild West</HD>
<DH>Yemen's tradition-bound tribes have codes of conduct that allow
them to take hostages as collateral in disputes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MARIB, Yemen
</DL>
<LD>When a German engineer was taken hostage in Yemen last November, it
made headlines around the world, reinforcing this nation's image as the
Wild West of the Middle East, a place where gangs of armed tribesmen prey
on foreigners. It took days of intense negotiations to free him.</LD>
<LD>   But 43 Yemeni hostages held here for months haven't been so lucky: no
international outrage, no local angst, not even a whimper of protest over
their captivity. One reason, it seems, for the muted response: The
government took its own citizens captive.</LD>
<LD>   That Yemen's elected leaders resorted to hostage-taking tells much
about the obstacles to transforming this battered, fractured and largely
tribal society of 18 million people into a modern nation. Taking the law
into one's own hands--even if it's the government that is doing the
taking--has long been a prominent element in Yemen's tribal-dominated
culture.</LD>
<TE>   Tribes thrive in a vast network that spreads north and east of Sana,
the capital, and into the barren mountains and golden deserts of the
Arabian Peninsula. Much of this region is governed by centuries-old
traditions in which tribal sheiks divine justice and routinely take
"collateral"--cars, weapons or family members--during negotiations to
settle disputes or to force the government to address their needs.</TE>
<TE>   The tribes have become a significant concern for the U.S. government
in the wake of an October 2000 attack in Yemen on a U.S. Navy destroyer
and the Sept. 11 terrorist assaults. Al Qaeda network operatives have
found refuge and support among some Yemeni tribes, offering gifts of cash
and cars and playing on tribal codes of honor and vengeance. In some
cases, Yemenis became eager recruits to the cause of Islamic
fundamentalism, bringing to it their deeply rooted tribalism.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very important to understand the tribal culture," U.S.
Ambassador Edmund Hull said. "We will not succeed unless we do."</TE>
<TE>   For Westerners, the word tribe conjures up images of a savage and
backward people. But the reality is far more complex and subtle.</TE>
<TE>   Tribes here are part of an elaborate social structure that has endured
through generations, a system with precise codes of conduct and its own
caste-like hierarchy. Tribes flourish where the government is barely a
presence and there is often no electricity, no running water, no
hospitals and no schools. It is in these desolate rural communities that
people learned the tribe is Yemen and Yemen is the tribe.</TE>
<TE>   Most Yemenis trace their lineage to four main tribes. Over centuries,
these have fractured into hundreds of minor tribes and clans, each
defined as much by geography as by family lines. The tribal structure in
southern Yemen, which was a separate country until 12 years ago, was
essentially dismantled by that region's former communist regime.</TE>
<TE>   "The tribal system is a civilized one," said Sheik Abdelkarim bin Ali
Murshed, who leads a minor tribe of about 100,000 centered on the village
of Asnaf in the Kholan region of northern Yemen. "It contains noble
rules. The vulnerable are protected by the strong. The poor are aided by
the rich. The system maintains and preserves human rights."</TE>
<TE>   Although the government would like to tame the tribes, it recognizes
their importance in maintaining stability. Sheiks often are given
government positions that allow them access to gratuities and bribes they
use to support their communities, several Yemenis said. The tribal system
serves as a substitute where few government services, from courts to
running water, are provided.</TE>
<TE>   Seven months ago, for example, a fight in the Kholan region over a
piece of land led a member of one clan to kill someone from another clan.
Hoping to head off growing violence, Sheik Abdel Aziz Ghadir, a local
elder, and other regional dignitaries visited the victim's family,
bringing as offerings an ox, goat, sheep and other livestock.</TE>
<TE>   By accepting the animals, the family also accepted that the elders
would mediate the dispute. Then Aziz said he took from each family two
cars and 20 machine guns as insurance that they would abide by a ruling.
Once the verdict is rendered, the cars and guns will be returned.</TE>
<TE>   As this was considered an acceptable killing because both men were
armed, the final verdict should require the family of the accused to pay
about $4,300, with half going to the victim's tribe and half to his
family. If all sides agree, justice is quickly served, no one goes to
jail and the government abides by the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes family feuds can drag on for years. In Al Jawf, an
impoverished province neighboring Marib, it took 48 years to end a
conflict between two tribes that began with the killing of a dog and a
camel. Sheik Arfag bin Hathban, a top tribal leader, said that by the
time he ended the feud, 32 people had been killed.</TE>
<TE>   "The government doesn't give us any support," Bin Hathban said.
"People have to depend on the tribe. Most of the problems are handled in
the tribe."</TE>
<TE>   Nominally, Yemen has the trappings of democracy, with an elected
president and parliament. But in much of the country, the tribes hold
sway. Still, although the tribes might be strong in their regions, those
without members in the government often feel neglected.</TE>
<TE>   Desperate for development in their communities or angry over political
grievances, they resort to taking hostages to improve their leverage and
gain concessions and projects such as roads from the government. In the
last five years, about 120 foreigners have been taken captive. As strange
as it might seem to outsiders, the government did not uniformly view this
as criminal until recently. President Ali Abdullah Saleh has started
prosecuting such acts, imposing heavy prison sentences and promising no
mercy.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that pledge, Abdul Hadi H. Hamdani, a presidential advisor,
said he empathizes with the hostage-takers.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't kidnap to kill them," he said. "They keep them as guests
to pressure the government to bring the tribe a road or a school.
Tribespeople come to Sana [the capital], they see the roads, the cinemas,
everybody has a car, and in their village there is nothing. What are they
going to do?"</TE>
<TE>   But even when hostages are taken, it is within the context of tribal
etiquette and culture. Polish Ambassador Krzysztof Suprowicz was
kidnapped in March 2000 from Sana and taken to the Kholan region.</TE>
<TE>   "We arrived at the village, they showed me into the majlis [meeting
room] of the sheik's house," Suprowicz said, recalling the day he was
taken. "The elders arrived. They greeted me, welcomed me. 'Feel free, you
are our guest. Whatever you wish, we will go with you.' It was very
traditional. Once you are the guest, they will die before they let
anything happen to you."</TE>
<TE>   Suprowicz learned firsthand how the world is viewed by many Yemenis.</TE>
<TE>   "For them, their country is Kholan and the neighboring village," said
the ambassador, who was held for four days until tribal leaders
negotiated his release. "This is their country. 'What is Yemen? What is
government? Government is not providing for us. Our sheik is providing
for us.' "</TE>
<TE>   This is the world that U.S. investigators have been trying to better
understand since the bombing nearly 18 months ago of the U.S. destroyer
Cole in the port of Aden. Seventeen American sailors were killed and 39
injured in the attack, which was blamed on Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network.</TE>
<TE>   It was also this environment that greeted suspected terrorist Mohammed
Hamdi Ahdal when he entered Marib, a district so undeveloped that 250,000
of the 300,000 residents do not have electricity.</TE>
<TE>   According to the U.S. government, Ahdal is a senior Al Qaeda operative
who moved to a neighborhood in the town of Marib that is controlled by
Sheik Ahmed bin Ali Jalal. Ahdal gave money and cars to some residents to
win their trust, but the sheik offered sanctuary based on tribal
etiquette of helping guests, according to a knowledgeable resident. Some
knew of Ahdal's alleged terrorist links and the fact that he spent hours
each night talking on a satellite phone, the resident said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials also suspected that Qaed Salim Sunian Harethi, another
alleged Al Qaeda terrorist, was in the region. The resident, who asked to
remain anonymous, said that Harethi, who frequently visited and gave cash
to Ali Jalal, lived in Al Jawf province. There, he too took advantage of
tribal customs: Harethi had family connections to the local tribes,
officials said, and was automatically offered protection.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, the U.S. has broadened its presence here, with plans
to send troops who will train the Yemeni military to root out Al Qaeda
members. Part of that campaign came in December, when about 200 Yemeni
soldiers entered the impoverished area around Marib, about 75 miles east
of the capital. They were hoping to arrest the two suspected Al Qaeda
operatives.</TE>
<TE>   When troops entered a neighborhood looking for the men, tribal leaders
arranged for them to conduct a search. But members of the tribe grew
increasingly angry as soldiers began to confiscate mobile phones,
videotapes and documents.</TE>
<TE>   One witness said an airplane passing overhead spooked the anxious
residents, who opened fire on the troops. The fight reportedly involved
as many as 1,000 local gunmen. The government said 18 soldiers and 14
locals died in the firefight. A tribal official said 25 soldiers died, 40
soldiers were injured and six residents were killed.</TE>
<TE>   With that bloody failure, and with the suspected terrorists still at
large, the national government resorted to the time-tested Yemeni
approach: It took the 43 hostages, including 10 sons of tribal sheiks, in
an effort to force locals to hand over the suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not used to fighting, so we use peaceful and easy means that
will keep respect and dignity and at the same time achieve what we want
to achieve," said Sheik Sultan Sayed Barakani, a member of parliament and
leader of the majority caucus. "We don't call them hostages; they are
guests."</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the bloodletting, tribal chiefs throughout Yemen signed
an accord with the government saying they will not harbor terrorists--and
any tribal leader who does could be killed with impunity, either by the
government or the tribe.</TE>
<TE>   "When the government is weak, the tribes and sheiks will be strong,"
said presidential advisor Hamdani, explaining why the administration took
a hard line in the case. "They will convince people they are the
authority."</TE>

</DL>
<LD>For more than 14 months, President Bush tried to steer clear of the
Arab-Israeli conflict, a seemingly endless tangle that has consumed
serious diplomatic energy from every president since Richard Nixon.</LD>
<LD>   But conflict avoidance didn't work. The crisis got worse, not better,
and was threatening to sink Bush's effort to build a worldwide coalition
against terrorism and "rogue" nations such as Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   So Bush changed course. The positions he outlined in his long
statement in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday weren't new; the
United States has supported an independent Palestinian state since
President Clinton's abortive peacemaking effort in 2000 and a secure
Israel since the Jewish state's creation in 1948.</LD>
<TE>   What was new, however, was Bush's willingness to put his own influence
on the table, and to make progress toward Arab-Israeli peace a measure of
his presidency's success.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important part of this was the president of the United
States coming out solidly committed to doing something about this
problem," said Edward S. Walker Jr., a former U.S. ambassador to Israel
and Egypt. "He's sending the secretary of State out in his own name. That
means the secretary goes armed, for a change."</TE>
<TE>   To optimists such as Walker, Bush's personal involvement means that
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will feel compelled to halt his
offensive against Palestinian towns in the West Bank and that moderate
Palestinian leaders will be emboldened to speak out against the wave of
suicide bombings that touched off the current crisis.</TE>
<TE>   To pessimists such as Walter Cutler, a former ambassador to Saudi
Arabia, the chances of success appear slim but better than the
alternative. "It's fraught with risks," Cutler said of the
administration's new course, "but we have to take them."</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
agreed with both assessments. The president had to act now, they said,
because the conflict was threatening to burst the bounds of the current
conflict and damage U.S. interests in the entire Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   In private talks during the last few days, one official said, an
emissary from Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah warned that the United
States would "never again get the use of any military base against Iraq"
if it didn't stop the fighting in the West Bank. At the same time,
administration officials feared that the unrest would spread, affecting
friendly governments such as Egypt and Jordan and creating a wider
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "There were risks that those regimes would be destabilized in some way
or, more to the point, that they would be forced to cut or break off
relations with Israel," a senior official said. "Obviously, Israel's
long-term security requires peace with its neighbors. And there was
concern . . . about the long-term bitterness that was being engendered in
the Palestinian people--that it will generate more suicide bombers, not
less.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at a tipping point in Arab opinion generally," the official
said. "We want to bring the Arab countries onto our side in the war on
terrorism rather than have them go on the side of the terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, in off-the-cuff remarks at his Texas ranch, Bush
exhibited what appeared to be a deeply felt sympathy toward Israel in its
battle against terrorism and, to a lesser degree, concern for the
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush's long policy statement Thursday, hammered out after days of
negotiations inside the administration, was painstakingly evenhanded. It
carefully assigned equal weight to the statehood of Israel and the
statehood of a future Palestine.</TE>
<TE>   But it also tried to fit the long-running Arab-Israeli conflict into a
more recent American template for discerning friend from foe: Henceforth,
anyone on either side who decisively renounces terrorism is a U.S. ally.</TE>
<TE>   Thus the administration said it would rely heavily on Saudi Arabia,
Egypt and Jordan to pressure Palestinian leaders to turn their followers
away from suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Bush called on Palestinians to move beyond the indecision of their
longtime leader, Yasser Arafat--and implicitly urged them to replace the
72-year-old former guerrilla if he doesn't embrace a compromise with
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "The chairman of the Palestinian Authority has not consistently
opposed or confronted terrorists," Bush said. "The situation in which he
finds himself today is largely of his own making."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Bush called on "responsible Palestinian leaders . . . [to]
step forward and show the world that they are truly on the side of peace.
The choice and the burden will be theirs."</TE>
<TE>   "I expect better leadership, and I expect results."</TE>
<TE>   A senior administration official said later that the United States
still believes that it must negotiate with the Palestinians through
Arafat, at least for the time being.</TE>
<TE>   "Chairman Arafat is who the Palestinian people still look to as their
leader," he said. "And it is simply not practical to say he isn't there
when he is there and he is looked to by the Palestinian people."</TE>
<TE>   But if Arafat fails to provide "better leadership," in Bush's words,
U.S. officials made clear that they would find other Palestinians to talk
with. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell plans to make a point of meeting
with several Palestinian leaders when he visits the Middle East next
week, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the most important thing about Bush's speech--the fact that
the administration no longer says the path of peace runs through Yasser
Arafat," argued Robert Satloff of the Washington Institute for Near East
Policy, a think tank that is often supportive of Israel. "Is he part of
the problem or part of the solution? The president was stark and clear on
the fact that Arafat has failed."</TE>
<TE>   Former ambassador Walker, who now runs the Middle East Institute, a
Washington public policy center largely sympathetic to the moderate Arab
camp, agreed--partly.</TE>
<TE>   "The moderate Arab leadership is fed up with Arafat," he said. "But it
won't be easy finding an alternative leadership. I'm afraid the Israelis
have done a lot of damage to the next generation of Palestinian leaders.
If any of them came out now and proposed making concessions, they'd be
considered traitors."</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials and outside experts warned that Powell's
chances for success are modest in the short run.</TE>
<TE>   "The best we could hope at this point--and it's going to be a long
process, with plenty of ups and downs--is to get some concrete statements
from Arab leaders, an agreement by the parties to begin political
discussions, an Israeli pullback from the major cities [in the West Bank]
and, effectively, a standstill agreement as things get worked out,"
Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   Only two weeks ago, Vice President Dick Cheney was in the Middle
East--and made no visible headway. Perhaps tellingly, Bush and other
officials didn't mention Cheney's mission in their briefings for
reporters Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   This time, they hope, Bush's involvement will make a critical
difference.</TE>
<TE>   "The president has made his case," a senior official said. "And we're
confident the players are going to think about that case."</TE>

<HD>War-Weary, Egypt Sticks With Peace</HD>
<DH>Mideast: President and people express anger with Israel but
aversion to military involvement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>His voice clear and stern, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak went on
national television Thursday to lash out at Israel's "inhumane" treatment
of the Palestinians. But as he appeared to be building toward a dramatic
announcement, jabbing his finger in the air, he instead declared Egypt's
commitment to peace--with Israel.</LD>
<LD>   After accusing Israel of violating every international convention on
human rights and warning the Jewish state not to harm the Palestinian
leadership, Mubarak said, "Israel should recognize that right now Arabs
are extending a hand of peace."</LD>
<LD>   Hastening to clarify his point, he said that Egypt's hand--and that of
the Arab League, which recently endorsed a Saudi peace initiative--was
extended "out of rivalry, rather than weakness."</LD>
<TE>   The Egyptian president's 15-minute speech, laced with volatile
rhetoric, reflected the bind that Egypt and many other Arab countries are
facing: There is widespread frustration with the Israeli military's
perceived ability to attack Palestinians with impunity, but there also is
a deep reluctance to do anything that will have negative consequences at
home, such as going to war.</TE>
<TE>   "The Arab world will not fight America," said Tasheen Bashir, a former
Egyptian ambassador and aide to the late President Anwar Sadat. "The Arab
world will do nothing."</TE>
<TE>   These conflicting realities have left people here angry, depressed,
increasingly anti-American--and increasingly anti-Semitic.</TE>
<TE>   Since Israel moved on the West Bank last week in a military operation
that it says is aimed at rooting out terrorism, there have been student
demonstrations across the Arab world and calls for opening the borders of
Arab states to allow volunteers to fight for the Palestinian cause. Iraq
and Sudan have called for stopping the sale of oil to states supporting
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   But the Arab world still bears the scars of its wars against the
Jewish state and of a 1973-74 oil embargo that wreaked havoc not only on
the industrial world but on the oil-dependent Arab economies as well.</TE>
<TE>   There is little appetite for repeating those actions, even among
hard-line states. Implacable Israel foe Syria, for example, has
redeployed its troops in Lebanon to get them farther away from the
increasingly hostile border with Israel. There is a sense that tough talk
coming from some states is just that--talk.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to make a difference between those who talk and those who
act," said Nabil Osman, the chief spokesman for the Egyptian government.
"If somebody is so sure he can play a certain card, no one is preventing
him or her."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the Egyptian government isn't taking any chances and is
trying to walk a tightrope between allowing the public to vent its
frustrations and not letting public hostility get out of hand. A popular
television show, "Editor in Chief," was taken off the air 10 minutes into
its broadcast Tuesday after the host, Hamdy Kandil, said the people want
the government to close the Israeli Embassy and expel the ambassador.</TE>
<TE>   In a column that appeared in the government-owned Egyptian newspaper
Al Gomhouriya on Thursday, writer Abdel Azim Ramadan cautioned against
being led into war.</TE>
<TE>   "I always say that this Palestinian conflict brings problems to Egypt,
because Egypt went through four wars because of this conflict," he wrote.
"And Egypt lost billions of dollars and thousands of Egyptians were
killed, and this delayed the development of Egypt."</TE>
<TE>   The steam has seeped out in other ways.</TE>
<TE>   An Egyptian fencing champion refused to participate in championship
finals in Turkey because another competitor was Israeli. The Egyptian
Sports Ministry applauded the decision.</TE>
<TE>   A 13-year-old Egyptian boy was reported missing by his father, who
said the youth left a note saying he had run off to fight for the
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian media have ridiculed the president of Yemen, Ali Abdullah
Saleh, for criticizing Egypt and Jordan for not cutting all ties with
Israel, while Yemen is working with the U.S. military to fight Al Qaeda
operatives.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the Arab states, Egypt and Jordan are experiencing the most
public pressure. They are the only two states to have signed peace
treaties with Israel. On Wednesday, Egypt took a half step in response to
the public mood, scaling back relations with Israel--while keeping open
diplomatic channels that it says can be helpful to the Palestinians.
Jordan's King Abdullah II sent a letter to President Bush with his
recommendations for bringing about a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   Some Egyptians are happy with Mubarak's course of action.</TE>
<TE>   In a small shop along Ismail Mohammed Street on Thursday, where men
gather daily to drink sweet tea and smoke tobacco through water pipes,
many praised the longtime Egyptian president. The men love the
Israel-bashing and support the aversion to war.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody who enters war will lose. Even the one who wins will lose,"
taxi driver Hassan W. Hassan, 47, said as he puffed on his water pipe.
"Most of the people who want war are the youth. They don't have any
experience with how much we suffered."</TE>
<TE>   Hassan and his friends sat quietly in the shop as the news blared from
a small television in the corner, broadcasting pictures of tanks rolling
through the West Bank city of Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   The men spoke of a desire for peace, but not out of any commitment to
live in harmony with Israel. Peace, they hope, will bring economic
prosperity. Without exception, they said they looked forward to the day
Israel would be obliterated from the region.</TE>
<TE>   "The Jewish people have no country," said Mohammed Abboud, 35, an
electrician. "The Jews from the start are scattered all over the world."</TE>
<TE>   This was Mubarak's audience, an audience he knows well after 21 years
as president. He stood at a lectern during his oration, saying the Jewish
state has shown its true face, exploiting the post-Sept. 11 war on
terrorism while "besieging and humiliating the unarmed Palestinian
people." He waved his finger and said Israel is "sorely mistaken if it
believes its present policy will lead to security. This policy will lead
to more harm and serious damage to the Israeli people."</TE>
<TE>   And he said: "The current policy of the Israeli government will only
contribute to deepening the sentiment of hatred of about 300 million
Arabs toward the state of Israel and those who support its current
policies."</TE>
<TE>   But if his goal was to command attention, Mubarak was upstaged. Less
than an hour after the Egyptian leader finished his speech, Bush gave his
own televised address on the Middle East conflict. It was the Bush speech
that garnered the most attention on a later news show, with Mubarak
ranking only a brief mention at the end of the broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   Asked for comment on the Mubarak address, a prominent Arab leader
working on the Palestinian issue said he hadn't even seen it.</TE>

<HD>Rice's Genetic Map May Help Build a Better Cereal</HD>
<DH>Science: Researchers hope to boost yield and make the grain more
nutritious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Competing public and private research groups released remarkably
complete drafts of the genetic sequence of rice Thursday, unlocking
hereditary secrets of the plant that feeds half the world.</LD>
<LD>   The findings by a corporate biotechnology laboratory in San Diego and
an international academic team led by scientists in Beijing promise to
almost immediately accelerate the search for more productive and
nutritious strains of rice.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers also are eager to use rice--the first crop to yield most
of its genetic code--as a key to decipher the more complicated genetics
of wheat, corn and other major cereal crops.</LD>
<TE>   Already, the genetics of rice have scientists rethinking the nature of
complexity.</TE>
<TE>   Rice has the smallest genetic sequence of all the cereal crops, yet it
grows from a genome--an organism's complete DNA code--that contains more
genes than required to make a human being, the scientists discovered. It
has as many as 55,000 genes--thousands more than does a person--even
though it is one-sixth the size of the human genome.</TE>
<TE>   "It is surprising," said one project's co-leader, Yang Huanming,
senior geneticist at the Beijing Genomics Institute and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   These strands of rice DNA ensnarled the researchers in a controversy
over commercial secrecy and public access. It echoed the rivalries that
racked the effort to decipher the human genome.</TE>
<TE>   The detailed drafts of the rice genome were created by two independent
teams, each using similar gene-sequencing techniques on a different
strain of rice. The research is published today in the journal Science.</TE>
<TE>   An academic consortium of Chinese and American researchers documented
the genetic information in a strain of rice called Indica, which is the
most widely grown variety of rice in China and most Southeast Asian
countries.</TE>
<TE>   The project, led by Yang and Jun Yu at the Beijing Genomics Institute,
is said to be the most ambitious genome research ever undertaken in
China. In all, 11 groups in China collaborated with the University of
Washington in Seattle to complete the draft sequence.</TE>
<TE>   "The importance of the rice genome sequence to agriculture is as great
as that of the human genome sequence to health," Yang said.</TE>
<TE>San Diego Team Studied 2nd Strain</TE>
<TE>   A corporate research team led by Stephen A. Goff at the Torrey Mesa
Research Institute in San Diego completed a detailed genetic draft of a
second rice strain called Japonica, the most popular variety of rice in
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The Torrey Mesa group is owned by Swiss agrochemical company Syngenta
International, which spent about $30 million on its sequencing project.</TE>
<TE>   Global production of rice, the world's most important staple crop, has
risen threefold over the last three decades.</TE>
<TE>   But crop yields are fast approaching the plant's natural limit on its
ability to turn the energy of sunlight into carbohydrates.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers hope that they can identify key rice genes to boost its
yield and make the plant more nutritious by increasing its vitamin
content. They also hope to make rice easier to grow, by breeding strains
better able to withstand disease, drought and poor soils.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the future of agriculture will be navigated using the rice
genome map," Goff said.</TE>
<TE>   Rice shares many of the same genes as wheat and other cereal crops.
Those genes also appear to fall in much the same order in all of them.
So, to understand how a gene works in rice is to understand how it
functions in all grains, the researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   "Rice may turn out to be the Rosetta Stone of all genome sequences,
although it was entirely unexpected," said Gane Ka-Shu Wong at the
University of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Already, plant breeders at Syngenta have used the rice genome to
create "virtual" maps of corn and wheat to identify potentially useful
genes.</TE>
<TE>   Syngenta found that about 98% of the known corn, wheat and barley
genes are present in rice. Once the gene for a beneficial trait can be
identified and mapped, it can be moved into any crop relatively quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "This is plant breeding by design and this has never been possible
before," said Steven Briggs, president of the Torrey Mesa Research
Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Both sequences still are incomplete, however, with as many as 11,000
gaps still to be filled in.</TE>
<TE>Limits on Access to Data Criticized</TE>
<TE>   In their work, the two teams used preliminary genome research
conducted by the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project and the
agricultural biotechnology company Monsanto.</TE>
<TE>   By pooling all the drafts, the finished rice sequence may be complete
in 18 months, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to retain corporate control of the rice sequence information
threatens the openness on which scientific progress often depends,
several scientists said.</TE>
<TE>   In a move that drew sharp criticism from geneticists around the world,
Syngenta executives decided to keep the company's rice genetic sequence
in a proprietary company database, placing restrictions on its use.
Monsanto has also limited access to its rice data.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, making such genetic data freely available is a strict
condition of publication in major peer-reviewed journals.</TE>
<TE>   Attempting to accommodate Syngenta's commercial interests, the journal
Science, published by the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science,
relaxed its rules and agreed to let Syngenta control the Japonica genetic
database.</TE>
<TE>   It is a compromise, Briggs said.</TE>
<TE>   The company is offering its genetic information freely only to
researchers who promise not to use it commercially. But it will not
prevent those academic scientists from patenting their findings or demand
review of research before it is published.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the public benefit of bringing this [rice genome] out of
trade-secret status outweighs whatever the precedent of letting
[Syngenta] deposit it on their own Web site creates," Science editor
Donald Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the Chinese-led team deposited its data in an independent
online forum called Genbank where the genetic information is freely
available to all researchers, with no commercial restrictions on its use.</TE>
<TE>   It is the second time that Science has allowed a company to limit
access to genetic-sequence data. In 2000, the journal published with
considerable fanfare a human genome prepared by the Celera Genomics Group
without requiring the company to deposit its data in Genbank.</TE>
<TE>   UC Davis rice geneticist Pamela Ronald called the rice genome sequence
"significant," but was disappointed in how the information is being
handled.</TE>
<TE>   Syngenta's efforts to limit access to its database could easily slow
research, Ronald said. "What happens with these company collaborations is
that they get bogged down in legal paperwork. It is very frustrating,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Added crop genetics expert Jeff Bennetzen at Purdue University: "It
would be best if the information were released . . . for all to use
without any strings attached. These sequences identify virtually all the
genes in rice."</TE>

<HD>Bush Says 'Enough Is Enough,' Tells Powell to Head to Mideast</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: President, in a sharp change of course, demands that the
violence end and pushes for renewed peace talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Declaring that "enough is enough," President Bush announced
Thursday that he is dispatching Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to the
Middle East next week in a bold but risky bid to end the raging violence
and get Israel and the Palestinians back to the peace table.</LD>
<LD>   "The storms of violence cannot go on," Bush said in a Rose Garden
speech that included a series of stern messages for Palestinian and
Israeli leaders as well as for regional players in the escalating crisis.
As basic steps, he called for Israel to withdraw its troops and the
Palestinians to end a wave of terror.</LD>
<LD>   The president's announcement marked a major policy reversal after a
week of words but no new action. Bush administration officials said the
president decided to act because of the mounting bloodshed and
destruction on both sides, but also because of the looming dangers of a
wider regional war.</LD>
<TE>   "The world finds itself at a critical moment. This is a conflict that
can widen or an opportunity we can seize," Bush said as Powell stood at
his side.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Bush spoke, Israeli armor backed by helicopter gunships
moved into Palestinian-ruled parts of the divided city of Hebron in an
incursion that brought every West Bank city except Jericho under Israeli
occupation. The incursion came as Israel tightened its hold on Nablus,
the West Bank's largest city.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon says the week-old operation is
designed to stop a wave of suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   In tough language, the president said Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat finds himself in a situation "largely of his own making"
because he has "missed his opportunities and thereby betrayed the hopes
of the people he's supposed to lead."</TE>
<TE>   Saeb Erekat, the chief negotiator for the Palestinians, said late
Thursday in Jerusalem that Arafat accepted Bush's statement "without
conditions" and welcomed Powell's visit. But the administration hinted
that it is fed up with Arafat's unwillingness to act on his promises by
suggesting that Powell also intends to hold talks with other Palestinian
leaders--a slap on the wrist as well as a step preparing for a possible
post-Arafat era.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Powell meets with Arafat will depend on the outcome of the
Palestinian leader's meeting with U.S. envoy Anthony C. Zinni, which
could come today, and Arafat's success in controlling the violence over
the next few days, administration officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush also demanded that Israel withdraw its troops from the cities
it has reoccupied during the last week in the West Bank. "Israel must
understand that its response to these recent attacks is only a temporary
measure," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a conspicuous omission, however, the president did not use the word
"immediate" as the time frame for the withdrawal, as he did in calling
for an immediate cease-fire and an immediate resumption of negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   That wording suggests that the United States may tolerate a few more
days of Israel's incursion. U.S. officials later said Israel should act
"very soon" to pull out its forces.</TE>
<TE>   In Israel, the Foreign Ministry welcomed Powell's visit and promised
"to do everything so that his mission will be successful." But a
statement from Sharon's office said Operation Protective Wall would
continue until Israel achieves its goal. A Defense Ministry spokesman
predicted that the operation could last seven more weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also called on Israel to halt the expansion of Jewish settlements
in the Palestinian territories and ease border closures. "It is crucial
to distinguish between the terrorists and ordinary Palestinians seeking
to provide for their own families," he said. "The Israeli government
should be compassionate at checkpoints and border crossings, sparing
innocent Palestinians daily humiliation."</TE>
<TE>   He also said: "Israel faces hard choices of its own. Its government
has supported the creation of a Palestinian state that is not a haven for
terrorism. Yet Israel must recognize that such a state needs to be
politically and economically viable."</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging that he has no illusions about the difficulties ahead,
Bush said Powell's trip to the region would include three mandates:
implementation of the recently approved U.N. Resolution 1402 to achieve
an immediate and meaningful cease-fire; a full Israeli withdrawal from
Palestinian cities; and fulfillment of the security plan devised last
year by CIA Director George J. Tenet, followed by implementation of a
proposal by former Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Maine) for resuming talks
on a final settlement of the half-century-old conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously passed a
resolution endorsing Powell's mission and demanding an Israeli withdrawal
"without delay."</TE>
<TE>   In a key shift, the administration will push for simultaneous movement
on the security and political fronts, after weeks of accepting Israel's
position that a stable cease-fire must be secured before the political
process can begin again.</TE>
<TE>   "The new element that I am going to be pressing hard in the days and
weeks ahead is that the political component of this process has to be
brought forward much more quickly than we might have thought otherwise,"
Powell said Wednesday on the CBS program "60 Minutes II."</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinian people have to see that there is a political process,
a political process that we will get involved in early on through
negotiations, which will lead quickly to a Palestinian state," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell is expected to arrive in the region midweek. He will hold talks
with leaders in Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, a senior
administration official said. But the schedule is still in flux, and no
decision has been made on which Palestinians he will see.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to the wider Arab world, Bush called on its leaders to follow
through on the initiative of Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, approved at an
Arab League summit last week, which offers to engage in "normal
relations" with Israel and foster a broader regional peace in exchange
for the Jewish state's withdrawal from land occupied in the 1967 Middle
East War and other concessions.</TE>
<TE>   "Arab states must rise to this occasion and accept Israel as a nation
and as a neighbor," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   "As Israel steps back, responsible Palestinian leaders and Israel's
Arab neighbors must step forward and show the world that they are truly
on the side of peace," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The president specifically called on the entire region to tackle
terrorism by blocking attacks, disrupting extremists' financial networks
and ending the glorification of suicide bombers as martyrs in
state-controlled media. "They're not martyrs," he said. "They're
murderers."</TE>
<TE>   The president also issued a strong warning to outsiders who are
fanning the flames of extremism. "To those who would try to use the
current crisis as an opportunity to widen the conflict--stay out," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Iran and Syria received specific warnings. Iran's arms shipments and
general support for terrorism fuel the conflict and must stop, Bush said.
Syria must both end its support for the extremist groups Hamas and
Hezbollah and decide where it stands in the broader war on terrorism, he
cautioned.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials also cited growing alarm about military exchanges along
the Lebanon-Israel border and the risk that Syria could be drawn into the
cross-border exchanges between Israeli forces and the Syrian-backed
Hezbollah. Growing pressures on Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, countries
critical to prospects for a regional peace, are sparking concern about a
wider destabilization.</TE>
<TE>   Regional flash points have begun moving the conflict in an explosive
new direction, a senior administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the obstacles ahead, Bush expressed optimism. "America is
committed to ending this conflict and beginning an era of peace. We know
this is possible, because in our lifetimes, we have seen an end to
conflicts that no one thought could end," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One hopeful note Thursday after Bush's speech was a tactical reversal
by Sharon to permit Zinni to meet Arafat, who has been confined to his
headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Earlier this week,
Sharon--who said he was determined to keep Arafat isolated--had turned
down Powell's request that the two be allowed to meet. On Thursday, a
European Union peace mission ended in failure when Israel would not allow
two senior envoys to meet Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   But Israeli officials were divided over the call for a halt to
Israel's military offensive. Sharon told Zinni that there can be no
negotiations until Palestinian suicide bombings and other armed attacks
come to a halt, his spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel can defeat terrorism unilaterally, or in cooperation with the
Palestinian Authority," the spokesman said. "And as long as the
Palestinians do not cooperate, Israel is within its right to continue
military operations."</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli army's chief of staff, said Thursday
that the offensive needs three more weeks to achieve its objective,
followed by four weeks of "mopping up." Uzi Landau, minister for public
security, warned that stopping the fight now would allow Palestinian
militants to regroup and rearm.</TE>

<HD>Power Firm, State Said to Be Near Revised Deal</HD>
<DH>Electricity: Tentative Calpine agreement would affect long-term
contracts worth $11.7 billion that were signed during crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>The Davis administration and Calpine Corp. have reached tentative
agreement on the renegotiation of four long-term power contracts valued
at $11.7 billion, state and industry sources said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   If finalized, the Calpine deal would be California's first successful
reworking of a long-term power contract and could save the state hundreds
of millions of dollars on consumers' behalf.</LD>
<LD>   Renegotiating the power contracts, signed last year at the height of
California's energy crisis, is one of Gov. Gray Davis' top political
priorities in this election year. Consumer activists, lawmakers and
Republican opponent Bill Simon Jr. accuse the governor of panicking last
spring and signing contracts that obligate the state to purchase too much
electricity at average prices that are nearly three times the current
market.</LD>
<TE>   Polls show that voters take a dim view of Davis' handling of the
state's electricity crisis, and he has been under pressure to rework the
contracts at more favorable terms. The Calpine contracts are considered
especially important because, although they number only four of the 56
long-term agreements signed last spring, they account for about
one-fourth of the electricity in those deals. The $43 billion committed
in the contracts ultimately will be paid by the customers of Southern
California Edison, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Kahn, the San Francisco attorney who has led months of talks
with Calpine on behalf of the state, said that no deal has been reached
and refused to comment on the details of the negotiations. "We have been
close before and not closed the gap," said Kahn. "I hope we're further
along than ever."</TE>
<TE>   "There is no deal," added Davis press secretary Steven Maviglio.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine spokeswoman Katherine Potter also emphasized that "we do not
have an agreement with the state at this time."</TE>
<TE>   But sources close to the talks said Calpine has tentatively agreed to
cut the duration of the contracts--in one case, from 20 years to 10
years--in return for the right to sell more power to the state in the
next two years, and other concessions.</TE>
<TE>   The financial effect, the sources said, is that Calpine would give up
payments of roughly $2.8 billion from the state after 2009, when two of
the reworked contracts would expire. The amount of the additional
electricity to be purchased in the next two years has not been
determined, and the price would fluctuate according to market swings.
With that exception, the price of most electricity purchased by the state
would not change under the new deal.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, and of critical importance to Calpine, the state Public
Utilities Commission would agree to drop its request that the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission review the legality of the Calpine
contracts. The state's petition creates uncertainty and concern among
Calpine investors, say Wall Street analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The state also is in talks to renegotiate long-term contracts with
several other energy companies, including Constellation Power Source, and
it threatened Wednesday to terminate a $6.6-billion contract with Sempra
Energy Resources.</TE>
<TE>   Just how much consumers stand to gain from the tentative Calpine deal
could not be determined from the details available Thursday. While the
tentative agreement would eliminate 14 years worth of contracts involving
$2.8 billion in payments to Calpine, it appears to give California no
more flexibility on when it buys electricity from Calpine. Consumer
groups have complained that the contracts force the state to buy
electricity whether or not it is needed.</TE>
<TE>   The state would also forfeit the possibility of federal regulators
reshaping the Calpine contracts more to consumers' advantage.</TE>
<TE>   If it finalizes the Calpine deal, the state is gambling that it will
be able to buy electricity cheaper in 2009 and beyond than it would have
paid under the existing long-term contracts, in which prices range from
$59 to $174 per megawatt-hour. A megawatt-hour is enough power to supply
roughly 750 homes for an hour.</TE>
<TE>   When Davis advisors negotiated the $43 billion worth of contracts last
spring, they did so to save the state from paying hundreds of dollars per
megawatt-hour for power in the spot market and to avoid blackouts. The
average price in the contracts is roughly $70 per megawatt-hour.</TE>
<TE>   But not long after the contacts were signed, the market prices
plummeted to $30 per megawatt-hour or less, so that now the state's
contracts are expensive in comparison.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the PUC petitioned federal regulators to void or modify
long-term contracts with 22 energy companies, including Calpine. The PUC
argues the contracts are invalid because California was forced by the
threat of blackouts to sign them when energy companies wielded undue
control of the power market California created under a deregulation 1996
plan.</TE>
<TE>   The federal regulatory commission, FERC, has yet to consider
California's challenge of the contracts. FERC has intervened in
California's market by capping prices for some electricity sales, but
experts disagree on whether the five-member panel will use its authority
to break or amend long-term commitments that were willingly signed by
California and initially heralded by the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, California's petition to FERC creates more uncertainty and
concern for San Jose-based Calpine, which is already struggling to prove
its worth to investors. Calpine's stock price has tumbled and its credit
rating dropped to junk status as investors have taken a harsher view of
energy companies since the bankruptcy of Enron. A nationwide drop in
electricity prices has also crimped the earnings Calpine could expect
from the two dozen power plants it is building around the country.</TE>
<TE>   The tentative renegotiation of the state's contracts could help
Calpine, which is eager to bolster cash reserves quickly to reassure
investors, by allowing it to sell power now rather than later. In
particular, the tentative deal would cut in half a 20-year contract under
which the state pays $80 million to $90 million annually simply for the
right to buy more power from 11 "peaker" plants Calpine is building.
Peakers are small power plants designed to run at short bursts on hot
days when electricity consumption soars.</TE>
<TE>   Two other contracts under which Calpine sells electricity to the state
around the clock would be shortened to eight years from 10 years.
Industry officials put the total savings to the state from truncating
these contracts at $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said California would gain the right to buy additional power
this year and next from Calpine at a price tied to the company's natural
gas costs.</TE>
<TE>   That additional power could be cheaper than what California now pays
under the Calpine contracts because the cost of natural gas--the main
fuel burned to generate electricity--has plummeted since California's
electricity crisis hit high gear in early 2001.</TE>
<TE>   A price break would be welcome, said William B. Marcus of JBS Energy,
an economist who has studied the state's power contracts for consumer
groups.</TE>
<TE>   But he questioned how much additional power the state really needs
from Calpine in the next couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   State forecasts show that in 2004, when the amount of power under
contract peaks, the state could be selling as much as one-fourth of its
electricity at a loss because there is no demand for it.</TE>
<TE>   Marcus said he would like to see a final agreement with Calpine give
the state the freedom to refuse to buy power in low-demand hours such as
the early morning.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd much rather see Calpine slice a bunch of kilowatt-hours off in
the early morning instead of taking this power [seven days a week, 24
hours a day]," said Marcus. "Let the state have some ability to cut off
some of that power when it doesn't need it."</TE>

<HD>Angola and Rebels Sign Cease-Fire Agreement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya
</DL>
<LD>The Angolan government and the UNITA rebel group signed a formal
cease-fire agreement Thursday, in what was heralded as the best hope yet
for peace in a country that has been racked by civil war for more than a
quarter of a century.</LD>
<LD>   White flags fluttered outside the parliament building in Luanda, the
Angolan capital, as leaders of the army and UNITA shook hands and
exchanged hugs after signing the accord.</LD>
<LD>   The pact came only six weeks after hard-line UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi--seen as a major hindrance to previous peace efforts--was tracked
down and killed in a battle with government troops in southeastern
Angola.</LD>
<TE>   "This [cease-fire] could be a real turning point," said Chester
Crocker, assistant secretary of State for African affairs during the
Reagan administration, who now teaches at Georgetown University. "We have
to hope it will succeed."</TE>
<TE>   Joao Porto, an Angola specialist with the Institute for Security
Studies, a South African think tank, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what each Angolan has been waiting for for decades, a chance
to develop the country in peace and normalcy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Details of the 40-page agreement weren't revealed, but government
officials acknowledged that it includes amnesty for UNITA fighters. It
also guarantees the disarming and integration of about 50,000 UNITA
rebels and their families into the armed forces and civilian positions.
The United Nations has agreed to monitor the demobilization process,
which is to begin next week.</TE>
<TE>   Interim UNITA leader Paulo Lukamba told reporters Thursday that the
accord would legalize the rebel group and make it the country's main
opposition party.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts had widely predicted that Savimbi's death would hasten
Angola's peace process, although few expected a deal would be signed so
swiftly.</TE>
<TE>   Crocker and Porto said the accord was apparently expedited by the Feb.
22 slaying of Savimbi; the death little more than a week later of his
successor, Gen. Antonio Dembo; and recent heavy battlefield losses by
UNITA.</TE>
<TE>   Porto said fighters belonging to UNITA, the Portuguese initials for
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, were beginning
to suffer from a condition afflicting many Angolans: war fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, although previous cease-fire agreements were broken and
abandoned in 1991 and '94, analysts said there were several reasons to
believe that the latest accord would hold.</TE>
<TE>   Porto said the government had shown significant goodwill by agreeing
to integrate 50,000 UNITA members when recent estimates suggest that the
number of fighters has dwindled to fewer than 10,000.</TE>
<TE>   Porto and Crocker said the success of the cease-fire agreement depends
on whether UNITA's new leadership can sell the accord to its military
faction, its parliamentary group and its external wing in Portugal and
other countries.</TE>
<TE>   "There is reason to be cautiously optimistic," Porto said. "We have to
realize this is the beginning of a very long road."</TE>
<TE>   Angolans, who fought a 14-year armed struggle against Portuguese rule,
have known little but conflict since they gained independence in 1975.
That was when Savimbi, who saw himself as the champion of the country's
disenfranchised black majority, took up arms against government troops
belonging to the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict between UNITA and the MPLA became a Cold War affair. The
United States and South Africa's then-apartheid government supported
UNITA against the Marxist MPLA government, which received weapons and
fighters from Cuba and the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   The civil war devastated Angolans. About 1.5 million people, according
to CIA estimates, have been killed in the conflict. An additional 4.5
million of the country's 13 million people were driven into refugee camps
and temporary shelters far from their home villages.</TE>
<TE>   Angola, about twice the size of Texas, is one of Africa's richest
countries, with vast oil, diamond and fishing reserves. Little of that
wealth trickles down to ordinary people. More than 75% of Angolans live
in poverty.</TE>
<TE>   For a quarter of a century, the warring parties funded the conflict by
selling oil and diamonds. UNITA sold diamonds from several mines it
controlled and bought weapons with the proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, the London-based charity Global Witness issued a
report alleging that top Angolan government officials exploited the war
to embezzle oil revenue through bank loans, kickbacks on arms trafficking
and a highly overpriced military procurement process.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping that this new cease-fire deal eventually leads to a
climate where ordinary people will be able to call on their government to
account for revenue," said Gavin Hayman, a Global Witness official.</TE>

<HD>Karzai Among Plot's Targets, Authorities Say</HD>
<DH>Asia: Afghanistan's exiled king and foreigners also were on the
alleged hit list. Detainees number 160.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Targets of an alleged Afghan assassination conspiracy included
foreigners, the country's exiled king and interim Prime Minister Hamid
Karzai, authorities said Thursday, accusing those arrested of
"undermining, threatening, sabotaging and harming this government."</LD>
<LD>   Interior Minister Younis Qanooni said that about 300 opponents of
Karzai's government had been arrested or detained in recent days and that
160 remained in custody. Authorities claimed to have seized
bomb-detonating devices and documents outlining assassination plans.
Qanooni said the plot never got beyond the planning stage.</LD>
<LD>   Qanooni was among those on the hit list, Afghan security officials
said, as was Defense Minister Mohammed Qassim Fahim and Mohammad Zaher
Shah, the monarch who was exiled in 1973 and who is expected to return to
Afghanistan this spring. Qanooni said the plot was aimed "against our
foreign guests as well," but he did not specify whether he meant
soldiers, peacekeepers, diplomats or civilians.</LD>
<TE>   The majority of those arrested were connected with the Hezb-i-Islami
party of warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who had returned from exile in Iran
and was in western Afghanistan, according to Qanooni.</TE>
<TE>   "These are people who have been accused. The accusations are not yet
proven. An investigation is underway, and in phases it will determine
whether they are innocent or guilty," Qanooni said.</TE>
<TE>   But he added, "What I'd make clear is that they were engaged in
undermining, threatening, sabotaging and harming this government."</TE>
<TE>   It was difficult to determine to what extent the assassination threat
was real or whether those arrested were engaged in legitimate political
activities in trying to reorganize Hezb-i-Islami.</TE>
<TE>   However, the arrests revealed the fault lines in Afghanistan's fragile
peace as the United States and other outside powers attempt to push the
nation toward a more democratic, pluralistic path.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's disparate forces are already beginning to jostle for
power in the lead-up to this June's loya jirga, or grand council, which
will decide Afghanistan's next leader and government. Afghan authorities
charged that the plotters planned to target the council, throwing the
country into confusion and threatening a return to civil war.</TE>
<TE>   Political forces here are divided along tribal, ethnic and regional
lines, and long-held antipathies form the biggest threat to a lasting
peace.</TE>
<TE>   Hezb-i-Islami is dominated by ethnic Pushtuns, while key security and
foreign affairs posts in the interim government are held by ethnic Tajiks
from the Northern Alliance. The alliance fought the Taliban from 1994,
when the extremist Islamic movement emerged, until the militants' recent
downfall as a result of the U.S. military campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of those arrested were Pushtuns, Qanooni strongly denied
any political or ethnic motive.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue has nothing to do with ethnicity. What it deals with is a
plot against the people of Afghanistan and their desire to live
peacefully," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He insisted that no one was arrested for political activities. "These
people have been in Kabul for a long time," he said. "It is only when the
threat became evident that they were arrested."</TE>
<TE>   The arrests were made by the National Directorate of Security, the
domestic intelligence force, which is within the Interior Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Flight Lt. Anthony Marshall, a spokesman for the International
Security Assistance Force, the British-led peacekeeping force here, said
the arrests were part of an effort to tighten security in Kabul, the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Col. Neal Peckham, another ISAF spokesman, said Afghan Interior
Ministry forces found 47 automatic weapons in western Kabul in recent
days. It was unclear whether there was a link between the weapons cache
and the arrests.</TE>
<TE>   One diplomatic source said a faction of the Hezb-i-Islami party had
made recent overtures to the interim administration in a bid to bury past
differences, but other gestures from party members appeared
ill-intentioned.</TE>
<TE>   Even in Afghanistan, where betrayals and defections are the rule,
Hekmatyar stands out.</TE>
<TE>   A prominent figure among the U.S.-backed moujahedeen that fought the
country's Soviet occupiers from 1979 to 1989, he turned against other
Afghan factions after the Soviets withdrew. In the early 1990s,
Hekmatyar's forces relentlessly rocketed the Kabul area, fueling a civil
war that killed about 50,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Among those believed to be arrested was former Hekmatyar ally
Wahidullah Sabaun, a former finance minister in the Northern Alliance
government, which the Taliban ousted from Kabul in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Sabaun, also a former member of Hezb-i-Islami, was angry when he was
left out of the current interim administration, put in place after a
summit in Germany late last year.</TE>

<HD>Heed Priorities, Blair to Tell Bush</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: British leader is expected to advise in Texas that the
Mideast and Afghanistan come before Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas
</DL>
<LD>On the world stage, British Prime Minister Tony Blair stands
without rival as President Bush's head cheerleader--to such an extent
that critics deride him as "America's poodle." But Blair arrives here
today for a weekend of consultations with Bush as a counselor with some
tough advice to dispense.</LD>
<LD>   His message: Forget about Iraq until the Middle East crisis and the
war on terrorism in Afghanistan abate. Even then, Blair is known to
harbor doubts about the consequences of a campaign to oust Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   The talks between "George" and "Tony," as they call each other, should
be cordial, reflecting a mutual affinity and their many shared goals and
preferences.</LD>
<TE>   But Bush and Blair face no shortage of difficult subjects, aside from
the Middle East and Afghanistan. They include a further expansion of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and a trade dispute with Europe
resulting from Bush's recent imposition of tariffs on steel imports.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you're going to see a very wide-ranging series of
discussions," White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said at a news
briefing Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States and Great Britain enjoy a very special
relationship. . . . And the two leaders enjoy spending time together and
talking about these various topics," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the Middle East, they agree on a common framework of action: the
implementation of a cease-fire plan devised by CIA Director George J.
Tenet, followed by negotiations on a final political settlement as
outlined by former Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Maine).</TE>
<TE>   But notwithstanding Bush's announcement Thursday that he is
dispatching Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to the Middle East, Blair
may propose a British or European role in the search for peace in the
region.</TE>
<TE>   A Blair spokesman in London said the prime minister believes that his
experience with the Northern Ireland peace efforts could help exert
pressure on Palestinians and Israelis, who are locked in an unforgiving
cycle of violence.</TE>
<TE>   "The main issue is going to be the Middle East--the prime minister is
appalled by what is going on here. The situation is the most explosive it
has been for years," said the spokesman, who asked not to be identified.
"We want to help the U.S. play this role" of peacemaker.</TE>
<TE>   Though Europeans have overwhelmingly backed the U.S. and British
efforts against terrorists in Afghanistan, they are much less supportive
of any military action to oust Hussein. So the degree of Blair's support
for such an effort will be carefully gauged.</TE>
<TE>   Before Blair left for Texas, his government had intended to announce
details of Hussein's efforts to develop biological, chemical and nuclear
weapons, to lay the groundwork for a possible attack on Iraq. Instead,
the British held back.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear whether that decision related to political opposition
to a military strike or a lack of convincing evidence against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Until the Israeli-Palestinian crisis exploded, charting the next step
against Hussein's regime was to have been the main focus of the Crawford
talks. London is as concerned as Washington about evidence that Baghdad
is clandestinely developing weapons of mass destruction. But, like many
in Europe and the Middle East, Britain is particularly concerned about
the aftermath of any operation to eliminate Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Blair strongly believes that the crises in the Middle East
and Afghanistan must be dealt with before the West takes on another hot
spot, and that could take a year, British officials said.</TE>
<TE>   On Afghanistan, London is concerned that the U.S. focus on routing Al
Qaeda fighters and tracking their leaders has slowed progress on creating
a viable Afghan military, which is vital to consolidating central rule
over the country and restoring law and order.</TE>
<TE>   Britain wants to see faster training of an Afghan army. And it would
like to turn over control of the peacekeeping force in Kabul, the Afghan
capital, to Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   Other issues on the agenda include the evolving relationship between
NATO and Russia, and the steel quota issue. Blair had appealed to the
White House not to impose new tariffs on imported steel and is said to
feel somewhat burned by Bush's decision to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Blair is to arrive at Bush's ranch this afternoon. On Saturday, he and
Bush are scheduled to hold a news conference. Blair returns home Sunday,
arriving in time for next week's funeral for Queen Mother Elizabeth.
First Lady Laura Bush is leading the U.S. delegation to that service.</TE>

<HD>Security Tight as Pearl Trial Begins, Adjourns in Pakistan</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Scores of police armed with assault rifles patrolled outside the
gates of this city's jailhouse as the trial began today for a
British-born Islamic militant and three others in the kidnap-slaying of
Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl.</LD>
<LD>   But the trial quickly adjourned for a week after the lawyer for Ahmad
Omar Saeed Sheikh demanded more documents from the government.</LD>
<LD>   The attorney asked the government to hand over copies of e-mails and
photos sent to authorities announcing Pearl's abduction, another defense
lawyer said.</LD>
<TE>   Inside Karachi Central Jail, said senior jail officials speaking on
condition of anonymity, Sheikh, 29, and his three co-defendants went on
trial on charges of murder, kidnapping and terrorism. All four face the
death penalty if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of the men were allowed to enter the courtroom, but
journalists were kept out.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl disappeared Jan. 23 while researching Pakistani extremists. A
few days later, the previously unknown National Movement for the
Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty announced his kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   A videotape received by U.S. diplomats Feb. 21 showed Pearl had been
killed. His body has not been found. FBI agents traced the e-mails to one
of the defendants, Fahad Naseem, who identified Saeed as the mastermind.</TE>
<TE>   None of the four defendants--who also include Salman Saquib and Sheikh
Mohammed Adeel--was believed to have been holding Pearl or to have killed
him.</TE>
<TE>   Seven suspects remain at large.</TE>

<HD>Afghans Vow to Destroy Poppy Fields</HD>
<DH>Drugs: The interim government plans to offer compensation to
farmers who destroy their lucrative opium-producing crops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The fragile new Afghan government took on a daunting political and
logistical challenge Thursday, vowing to eliminate the Afghan poppy crop,
source of perhaps 70% of the world's opium and of much of this
impoverished country's income.</LD>
<LD>   Just two weeks from the harvest of the plants, which are used in the
production of heroin, the government said it would offer farmers about
$500 an acre to destroy crops--a fraction of what they can earn by
selling the opium the plants yield.</LD>
<LD>   If farmers don't tear up their crops, joint task forces of national,
provincial and local authorities will do it for them, senior government
advisor Ashraf Ghani Amatzai said.</LD>
<TE>   Not only do tens of thousands of Afghan farmers and harvest workers
depend on the trade, but opium dealers are believed to be associated with
some Afghan warlords and other influential figures.</TE>
<TE>   Ghani Amatzai said the government would not hesitate to use force. "We
hope we don't reach that point, but the Ministry of the Interior is fully
engaged to make sure it is carried out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Continuation of drug cultivation and trafficking will endanger our
ability to restore our good name and receive support as a legitimate
partner of the international community," interim Prime Minister Hamid
Karzai said in a decree.</TE>
<TE>   Starting Monday, the decree said, farmers will be offered $250 per
jirib of poppy, an Afghan land measure equaling about half an acre. Poppy
farmers this growing season have said they expect at least $1,700 per
jirib of opium.</TE>
<TE>   Ghani Amatzai said the harvest in the southern province of Helmand,
Afghanistan's biggest opium producer, will begin in about two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The extremist government of the Taliban had successfully banned poppy
cultivation in 2000, eliminating an estimated 96% of the 2001 crop. But
as the hard-line regime fell last fall, farmers quickly planted poppies
for the spring harvest, believing that any new government would be too
weak to enforce a ban.</TE>
<TE>   The Karzai administration, encouraged by the U.N. Drug Control
Program, announced a ban on poppy cultivation in January, but that was
long after the seeds were in the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Ghani Amatzai said the government would immediately institute a
program of labor-intensive projects, especially on roads and irrigation
systems, to help employ farm laborers.</TE>

<LD>Elian Gonzalez, the boy who survived a shipwreck only to spark a
controversy in Cuban exile politics, is now enjoying a normal childhood,
his father was quoted as saying.</LD>
<LD>   "He wants to be a policeman, a TV artist or an astronaut," Juan Miguel
Gonzalez told an official newspaper. "I just tell him to keep studying
and do his best."</LD>
<LD>   Elian, now 8, survived the November 1999 wreck in which his mother and
10 others drowned off Florida. Elian's relatives in Miami fought to keep
him, but the U.S. returned him to his father.</LD>

<HD>Koreas Resume Dialogue</HD>
<DH>Asia: The North and South discuss family reunions after a recent
impasse stalled talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>North Korean leader Kim Jong Il met Thursday night with a South
Korean presidential envoy in Pyongyang, the highest-level talks between
the estranged Koreas in more than a year.</LD>
<LD>   Among the topics reportedly discussed in the North Korean capital
between the reclusive Kim and South Korean envoy Lim Dong Won were the
scheduling of more reunions between long-separated Korean families and
the need for the North to reopen a dialogue with the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Lim also delivered a letter from the South Korean president.</LD>
<TE>   "Lim conveyed President Kim Dae Jung's intentions for peace and
cooperation on the Korean peninsula," South Korean government spokesman
Kim Hong Jae said.</TE>
<TE>   The three days of discussions are scheduled to conclude later today,
and the two sides are expected to issue a joint statement of their
intentions regarding future meetings. According to media reports here,
South Korea will donate to its impoverished neighbor 300,000 tons of rice
and 200,000 tons of fertilizer in an effort to ease the food crisis in
the North.</TE>
<TE>   Last night's meeting marked the first time that the North Korean
leader had received a South Korean envoy since September 2000. In
November, the most recent round of face-to-face negotiations between
officials from the two nations ended in a diplomatic stalemate. Relations
further deteriorated this year after President Bush characterized North
Korea as part of an "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   Also on Thursday, North Korea issued a strong statement through the
official newspaper, Rodong Shinmun, blaming U.S. "imperialist aggression"
for the current impasse. However, the North Koreans said they would
continue discussions with a U.S.-led consortium that is building two
light-water nuclear reactors in the North to help the country with its
critical power shortage.</TE>

<HD>AIDS Drug Ruling Upheld in S. Africa</HD>
<DH>Health: Government must distribute medicine now, pending appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>The South African government's AIDS program suffered another legal
defeat Thursday when the Constitutional Court upheld a ruling forcing
officials to immediately begin distributing a key drug to HIV-infected
pregnant women.</LD>
<LD>   The government, which has come under criticism for its often confusing
approach to fighting AIDS, had resisted creating a widespread program to
provide the drug nevirapine to HIV-infected pregnant women. The drug has
been shown to severely reduce a woman's chances of passing the virus to
her baby during labor.</LD>
<LD>   A High Court judge ruled in December that South Africa must begin a
nationwide nevirapine program. The judge also ruled that the government
must make the drug available at health institutions with the capacity to
administer it even as it appeals the ruling.</LD>
<TE>   The High Court last week said the government should not be allowed to
appeal that part of the ruling and must make the drug available
immediately.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Constitutional Court agreed, refusing to hear the
government's appeal on that section. The government will be allowed to
appeal the entire ruling at a hearing in May.</TE>
<TE>   The court said it would explain its Thursday decision then.</TE>
<TE>   The government is providing the drug at 18 pilot sites across the
country, saying that more study is needed before it expands the program
nationwide and that it does not have the proper infrastructure for a
larger program.</TE>

<HD>Israel Tightens Grip, Sends More Tanks to West Bank</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Major battle appears to loom in Nablus. The two sides
applaud planned Powell visit to region, but neither stands down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<AU>CAROLYN COLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NABLUS, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Israeli tanks with searchlights rumbled through darkened,
near-deserted streets here late Thursday, tightening their hold on
Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, and surrounding three refugee camps
where Palestinian gunmen were barricaded behind sandbags and garbage
bins.</LD>
<LD>   Fifty-six miles to the south, Israeli armor backed by helicopter
gunships thrust into Palestinian-ruled parts of the divided city of
Hebron in an incursion that brought at least part of every West Bank city
except sleepy Jericho under Israeli occupation.</LD>
<LD>   On the seventh day of the Israeli offensive, street battles raged in
Jenin, where four helicopter gunships fired into the town and a nearby
refugee camp. In Bethlehem, gunfire and explosions erupted early today in
a 3-day-old standoff between the Israeli army and about 100 Palestinian
gunmen holed up inside the Church of the Nativity.</LD>
<TE>   Five Palestinians and four Israeli soldiers were reported killed
Thursday in fighting across the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides applauded President Bush's decision to send Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell on a peace mission but voiced no intent to stop the
bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   Ignoring an appeal from Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's
office announced that the offensive would continue. Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz,
chief of the Israeli army general staff, said the offensive needs three
more weeks to achieve its objective, followed by four weeks of "mopping
up."</TE>
<TE>'The Occupation Will Inevitably End'</TE>
<TE>   Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian Authority president, praised
Palestinian fighters in Nablus and Jenin for "standing up to the savage
Israeli aggression."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat said he was "confident that the occupation will inevitably
end." Invoking the Koran, he added: "Persevere, persevere. It only takes
an hour of perseverance."</TE>
<TE>   Israel launched the assault March 29 to crush Palestinian militias
that have carried out deadly attacks on Israeli civilians, including
seven suicide bombings. The trigger was a March 27 attack at the start of
the Passover holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, at least 78 Palestinians and 63 Israelis have been killed,
and more than 1,100 Palestinians have been arrested. Israeli television
reported Thursday night that the government would reopen a long-abandoned
prison in the southern desert for them.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's heaviest fighting was reported in Jenin and in the northern
city's refugee camp. Israeli commandos moved from house to house in the
camp, helped by fire from helicopters and tanks. Soldiers seized two
buildings on the edge of the camp and were quickly surrounded by
Palestinian militants, who exchanged fire with them.</TE>
<TE>   Three Palestinian gunmen and three Israeli soldiers were reported
killed. The fourth Israeli soldier died in Hebron.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest battle appeared to be looming in this city of 180,000
people.</TE>
<TE>   Residents said as many as 400 Israeli armored vehicles had poured into
Nablus since late Wednesday, prompting hundreds of Palestinian gunmen to
take refuge in the labyrinthine old city and three adjacent refugee
camps.</TE>
<TE>   Advancing armor detonated land mines that had been laid in their path,
while helicopter gunships fired on Palestinian fighters. Palestinian
resistance was reported to be strongest along the city's eastern flank,
where Balata, the largest of the refugee camps, is located.</TE>
<TE>   Balata, with a population of about 20,000, is a hotbed of Palestinian
militancy and home to most top commanders of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade,
which has carried out suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis took up positions at the Palestinian governor's residence
and at An Najah University. Israeli snipers occupied tall buildings and
top-floor apartments, obscuring their positions behind green netting.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli gunfire killed a Palestinian man when he opened a window in
his apartment, Palestinian officials said. Palestinian hospitals reported
four people were killed and seven wounded.</TE>
<TE>Israeli Intent to Consolidate Control</TE>
<TE>   Hussam Khader, a Palestinian legislator and popular leader in Balata,
said he thought the Israelis would consolidate their hold on the city
proper before taking the camps.</TE>
<TE>   In Israel's more limited incursion last month, troops went
house-to-house in Balata, but the gunmen slipped into hiding in the city,
eluding capture. This time, the Israelis apparently intend to seal off
the escape route by securing the city.</TE>
<TE>   That would mean focusing on the old city, the cramped warren of homes
and small businesses that is a nightmare for the urban invader.</TE>
<TE>   "Once they get the old city, it will be easier for them to take the
camps, " Khader said.</TE>
<TE>   Electricity was cut off to parts of the city Thursday. Streets were
deserted, except for stray cats. Searchlights mounted on tanks scanned
the sides of buildings. Scattered gunfire erupted, and tracer bullets
raced across the sky.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a curfew," an Israeli announced in Arabic over a loudspeaker
mounted on an armored personnel carrier. "You're not allowed to go
outside."</TE>
<TE>   In his room in the Al Qasr Hotel, in an upscale neighborhood near the
university, Khalid Hijazi, a visiting professor of art history, turned up
the volume of his television set to drown out the sound of tanks and
gunfire outside.</TE>
<TE>   Each time a tank passed, his wife, Rawda, could not resist looking
out, with their 2-year-old daughter, Tala, in her arms.</TE>
<TE>   "People are afraid, but morale is high," said Abdel-Sattar Qassem, a
political science professor at the university. "People are worried about
their children but not ready to give up. No one is trying to hide."</TE>
<TE>   A radio reporter based in Nablus, Amer Abdel Hadi, predicted the
fighting at Nablus would be the most vicious.</TE>
<TE>   "We are expecting the worst," he said. "'Maybe they won't leave until
they've taken everything down. We are getting special punishment. Nablus
has many people on the wanted list and has prepared suicide bombers. They
call it the snake's head."</TE>

<HD>Israel Says Papers Show That Arafat Paid 15 Militants</HD>
<DH>Controversy: A Palestinian official, however, suspects that the
displayed documents for disbursing $6,000 to wanted men are forged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israeli officials Thursday made public two documents that they said
were signed by Yasser Arafat authorizing a total of $6,000 in payments to
15 Palestinian militants wanted by Israel for shooting and bombing
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Israel offered the documents as evidence to back its frequent claim
that the Palestinian Authority president violates the 1993
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord by directly supporting terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   A senior Palestinian official said he suspected that the documents
were forged.</LD>
<TE>   Both documents, taken from Arafat's compound after Israeli troops
stormed it last Friday, were presented to reporters as faxed requests
from senior officials of Arafat's Fatah movement. Arafat signed in a
corner of each fax and wrote the amounts to be paid, Israeli officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   One document, said to be from Fatah's West Bank leader, Hussein Sheik,
asked for $2,500 in "financial aid" for three "brethren," including Raed
Karmi. Arafat's purported reply, dated Sept. 19: "Allocate $600 to each
of them."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Karmi was the commander of the Fatah-affiliated Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade militia in the West Bank town of Tulkarm. Three months
earlier, Israel had put him on its wanted list and asked Arafat to hand
him over. Israel held Karmi responsible for nine killings. Karmi was
killed in January when a bomb exploded near where he was walking.</TE>
<TE>'Please Allocate $350 to Each'</TE>
<TE>   The other document is said to have come from Karmi, asking "urgent
financial aid" for 12 of his fighters. The request was first faxed to
Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, who faxed it to Arafat with a
recommendation that the fighters be given $1,000 each, Israeli officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   The reply at the bottom, above Arafat's purported signature, reads:
"Please allocate $350 to each."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials provided reporters with photocopies of the
documents, both handwritten in Arabic, along with an English translation.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Meridor, the Israeli Cabinet official who briefed reporters, said
the documents showed that Arafat had "a direct link to terrorist attacks,
including the finance of them--a direct link that cannot provide for any
deniability."</TE>
<TE>   Neither document itemizes what the 15 men were to be paid for, and
Arafat's reported authorizations were apparently no more specific than
the routine approvals he grants for salaries of public functionaries
throughout the self-governing Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   "You could say, 'OK, he just paid them salaries,' " said Col. Miri
Eisen, an Israeli military intelligence officer. "But all these men did
the entire time was commit acts of terror against us. . . . Every single
one of them was on our wanted list."</TE>
<TE>Campaign to Discredit Palestinian Authority</TE>
<TE>   Other Israeli officials seized on the disclosure to advance a campaign
to discredit the Palestinian Authority as a partner in negotiating peace
and have Arafat expelled. Israeli soldiers have confined him to a few
rooms of his West Bank headquarters in Ramallah since last Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli army's chief of staff, said the
documents prove that "the chances of reaching a peace arrangement with
Arafat are nonexistent."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said that he hadn't seen the
documents but that he expected they were fabricated and accused Israel of
using them to distract attention from its week-old military offensive
across the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Eisen responded: "These are real documents. We have no doubt about
them whatsoever. The state of Israel does not forge documents."</TE>
<TE>   She said the documents were among two truckloads of papers taken from
Arafat's headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Eisen had presented what she said was an invoice submitted
by the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade to Arafat's chief financial officer,
requesting money for a month's supply of about 30 bombs. But there was no
evidence that Arafat had approved the request, she said.</TE>

<HD>Militants and Israelis Trade Accusations in Church Siege</HD>
<DH>Bethlehem: Troops killed a bell ringer and are advancing into the
compound, Palestinians say. The military claims that gunmen opened fire
without provocation.</DH>

<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>The war of nerves and guns at the Church of the Nativity heated up
Thursday: Palestinians accused Israeli troops of killing a mentally
impaired bell ringer and advancing into the church compound, while the
Israelis said that Palestinians barricaded inside fired on them without
provocation.</LD>
<LD>   An eruption of gunfire and explosions shortly after midnight Thursday
was an ominous development in the standoff at the site revered as the
birthplace of Jesus, a confrontation full of the near-biblical fury and
tragedy of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</LD>
<LD>   The siege began Tuesday during an Israeli military incursion into
Bethlehem. About 200 Palestinians--at least 100 armed fighters and a
number of Palestinian Authority officials and civilians--took refuge in
the compound housing the Church of the Nativity and adjacent Roman
Catholic and Armenian houses of worship.</LD>
<TE>   Tensions escalated steadily Thursday. The Palestinians said the
Israelis were tightening the military vise around them in preparation for
an attack. About 1 a.m. today, Bethlehem Gov. Mohammed Madani said by
telephone from inside St. Catherine's church next to the Church of the
Nativity that he had heard four explosions and sustained gunfire. Israeli
soldiers had entered the east courtyard of the compound, Madani said.</TE>
<TE>   In response, an Israeli military spokesman said the Palestinians had
opened fire after midnight. But the Israelis did not return fire, in
order to protect the church and the dozens of clerics inside, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The shooting is coming from inside the church at Israeli soldiers,
who are not responding," said Marcus Scheff, a spokesman for the Israel
Defense Forces. He said he didn't know whether soldiers had entered the
compound but added, "I believe they are holding position."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides insist that they deeply respect the hallowed ground over
which they are pointing weapons at each other.</TE>
<TE>   "We will never shoot except to defend the dignity of the church, the
priests and ourselves," said a barricaded fighter named Abu Hatem, a
member of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade militia who was reached Thursday
evening by cell phone. "There will be a massacre written in history if
the Israelis break into the church. We have enough ammunition to kill a
lot of them."</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli commander said Thursday that his officers relayed offers of
food, medicine and medical care to the gunmen through Palestinian leaders
acting as intermediaries. But the barricaded members of militant groups
including Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Tanzim rebuffed the offers, said Col.
Marcel Aviv, chief of the Bethlehem area for the Israeli army.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israel Defense Forces wishes for a peaceful resolution to the
situation," Aviv told reporters. "We have one mission: to get all the
terrorists and the priests out with no casualties, I hope."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bethlehem was the scene of another day of shooting and
movements of troops and armored vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Young Israeli soldiers with rifles at the ready conducted
house-to-house searches in a warren of debris-choked streets a few blocks
from the standoff.</TE>
<TE>   The fighting and a military curfew made it difficult to confirm the
day's accusations and counter-accusations. Sometimes at gunpoint and
sometimes politely, Israeli soldiers ordered away journalists making
their way toward the siege at Manger Square.</TE>
<TE>   About midday Thursday, a loud explosion went off near the Church of
the Nativity. Palestinian sources and priests said the Israelis had used
charges to blow open a side gate in the southern wall of the compound by
Milk Grotto Street--so named because the Bible says the Virgin Mary
nursed the infant Jesus there.</TE>
<TE>   The men inside said the blast was a prelude to an attempt to storm the
church.</TE>
<TE>   "The explosion was really noisy," Bassem abu Odeh, 17, said. By
telephone, he said he had taken refuge with several monks in the
underground grotto that marks the spot where Christians believe Jesus was
born.</TE>
<TE>   Aviv said the explosion occurred during an operation at a nearby house
where Israeli soldiers sought to flush out terrorists. He denied that the
military had used explosives on the door of the church but didn't address
the question of an explosion at the church compound's side gate.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops broadcast several appeals over loudspeakers calling on
their enemies to surrender.</TE>
<TE>   "They were telling us, 'Come outside, we are not going to shoot you,'
" Odeh said. "But we know that anybody who goes outside will be killed."</TE>
<TE>   That, according to Palestinians and priests, is what happened to Samir
Abraham Salman, a mentally impaired former altar boy and longtime
employee at the Church of the Nativity. Salman worked as a bell ringer
and cleanup man, according to a Greek Orthodox priest named Father
Parthenius. Salman was 45, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the priests tried to keep an eye on him during the siege
because of his mental condition, on Thursday morning Salman apparently
grew tired of the ordeal. He went outside intending to walk home, Father
Parthenius said. Salman was cut down by gunfire, according to the priest,
others inside and Peter Qumri, director of the nearby Beit Jala
Government Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pity, a real pity," the priest said. But he and others said
they didn't know the circumstances of the death or what happened to the
body. Israeli officials said they had no information about the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions are deteriorating as Palestinians and priests who have
vowed to stay with the fighters run out of food, according to accounts
from those inside. They also are without electricity, and many are
sleeping on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Ibrahim Faltas, an Egyptian priest at St. Catherine's, said
by phone that he hopes negotiations between the Vatican and Israel will
lead to a breakthrough. Like many of Bethlehem's men of the cloth, he
sounded sympathetic to the Palestinian gunmen who have turned his house
of worship into a battleground.</TE>
<TE>   "The negotiations that are being conducted by the Vatican are to
oblige the Israeli army to withdraw from Bethlehem in order to enable the
people inside here to get out," Faltas said. "We call for the immediate
withdrawal of the Israeli army from Bethlehem."</TE>
<TE>   That scenario is unlikely, although the Israelis are keenly aware of
the religious sensitivities involved.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli commanders are determined to arrest top terrorist leaders
trapped in the church.</TE>
<TE>   "They really want these guys, because they are very senior," a
military spokeswoman said. "They are going to wait until they can get
them. They are in it for the long haul."</TE>

<DL>MONTPELLIER, France
</DL>
<LD>Assailants threw a barrage of Molotov cocktails Thursday into a
building here they mistook for a Jewish synagogue located next door, the
region's top official said.</LD>
<LD>   Three youths picked up about 200 yards from the site were detained for
questioning, police said, without providing more details.</LD>
<LD>   The fire-bombing followed a string of recent attacks on Jewish targets
that has coincided with heightened tension in the Middle East. Two
synagogues in Marseille, like Montpellier on the Mediterranean coast,
were among the targets.</LD>
<TE>   In the Thursday attack, two offices in the building that houses the
Herault region's environmental agency were badly burned, police said.
There were no injuries in the early-morning incident. Jewish leaders
joined Herault Prefect Daniel Constantin and Montpellier Mayor Georges
Freche at the site.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably an act by young delinquents," Constantin said.
"Visibly, there was no preparation . . . since they mistook the
building."</TE>
<TE>   Despite such attacks, Economy Minister Laurent Fabius, who is Jewish,
said on Europe 1 radio Thursday that "France is not anti-Semitic."</TE>

<KH>TEXT OF PRESIDENT'S REMARKS</KH>
<HD>'I Expect Better Leadership, and I Expect Results'</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Bush says the world is at a critical moment and tells
both sides that they 'owe it to their own people to act.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The text of President Bush's remarks Thursday on the Middle East,
as transcribed by EMedia MillWorks Inc.:</LD>
<LD>   Good morning.</LD>
<LD>   During the course of one week, the situation in the Middle East has
deteriorated dramatically. Last Wednesday, my special envoy, Anthony
Zinni, reported to me that we were on the verge of a cease-fire agreement
that would have spared Palestinian and Israeli lives. That hope fell away
when a terrorist attacked a group of innocent people at a Netanya hotel,
killing many men and women in what is a mounting toll of terror.</LD>
<TE>   In the days since, the world has watched with growing concern the
horror of bombings and burials and the stark picture of tanks in the
street. Across the world, people are grieving for Israelis and
Palestinians who have lost their lives.</TE>
<TE>   When an 18-year-old Palestinian girl is induced to blow herself up,
and in the process kills a 17-year-old Israeli girl, the future itself is
dying, the future of the Palestinian people and the future of the Israeli
people.</TE>
<TE>   We mourn the dead, and we mourn the damage done to the hope of peace,
the hope of Israelis and the Israelis' desire for a Jewish state at peace
with its neighbors. The hope of the Palestinian people to build their own
independent state.</TE>
<TE>   Terror must be stopped. No nation can negotiate with terrorists, for
there is no way to make peace with those whose only goal is death.</TE>
<TE>   This could be a hopeful moment in the Middle East. The proposal of
Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, supported by the Arab League, has
put a number of countries in the Arab world closer than ever to
recognizing Israel's right to exist.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is on record supporting the legitimate aspirations
of the Palestinian people for a Palestinian state. Israel has recognized
the goal of a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   The outlines of a just settlement are clear: two states, Israel and
Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. This can be a time
for hope, but it calls for leadership, not for terror.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, I've delivered this message: Everyone must choose.
You're either with the civilized world or you're with the terrorists. All
in the Middle East also must choose and must move decisively in word and
deed against terrorist acts.</TE>
<TE>   The chairman of the Palestinian Authority has not consistently opposed
or confronted terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   At Oslo and elsewhere, Chairman Arafat renounced terror as an
instrument of his cause, and he agreed to control it. He's not done so.</TE>
<TE>   The situation in which he finds himself today is largely of his own
making. He's missed his opportunities and thereby betrayed the hopes of
the people he's supposed to lead.</TE>
<TE>   Given his failure, the Israeli government feels it must strike at
terrorist networks that are killing its citizens. Yet, Israel must
understand that its response to these recent attacks is only a temporary
measure. All parties have their own responsibilities, and all parties owe
it to their own people to act.</TE>
<TE>   We all know today's situation runs the risk of aggravating long-term
bitterness and undermining relationships that are critical to any hope of
peace.</TE>
<TE>   I call on the Palestinian people and the Palestinian Authority and our
friends in the Arab world to join us in delivering a clear message to
terrorists: Blowing yourself up does not help the Palestinian cause. To
the contrary, suicide bombing missions could well blow up the best and
only hope for a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   All states must keep their promise, made in a vote in the United
Nations, to actively oppose terror in all its forms. No nation can pick
and choose its terrorist friends.</TE>
<TE>   I call on the Palestinian Authority and all governments in the region
to do everything in their power to stop terrorist activities, to disrupt
terrorist financing, and to stop inciting violence by glorifying terror
in state-owned media or telling suicide bombers they are martyrs.</TE>
<TE>   They're not martyrs. They're murderers. And they undermine the cause
of the Palestinian people.</TE>
<TE>   Those governments, like Iraq, that reward parents for the sacrifice of
their children are guilty of soliciting murder of the worst kind.</TE>
<TE>   All who care about the Palestinian people should join in condemning
and acting against groups like Al Aqsa, Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad,
and all groups which oppose the peace process and seek the destruction of
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The recent Arab League support of Crown Prince Abdullah's initiative
for peace is promising, is hopeful because it acknowledges Israel's right
to exist. And it raises the hope of sustained, constructive Arab
involvement in the search for peace.</TE>
<TE>   This builds on a tradition of visionary leadership begun by [Egyptian]
President [Anwar] Sadat and [Jordan's] King Hussein and carried forward
by [Egyptian] President [Hosni] Mubarak and [Jordan's] King Abdullah
[II]. Now other Arab states must rise to this occasion and accept Israel
as a nation and as a neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Peace with Israel is the only avenue to prosperity and success for a
new Palestinian state. The Palestinian people deserve peace and an
opportunity to better their lives.</TE>
<TE>   They need their closest neighbor, Israel, to be an economic partner,
not a mortal enemy. They deserve a government that respects human rights
and a government that focuses on their needs, education and health care,
rather than feeding their resentments.</TE>
<TE>   It is not enough for Arab nations to defend the Palestinian cause.
They must truly help the Palestinian people by seeking peace and fighting
terror and promoting development.</TE>
<TE>   Israel faces hard choices of its own. Its government has supported the
creation of a Palestinian state that is not a haven for terrorism. Yet
Israel also must recognize that such a state needs to be politically and
economically viable.</TE>
<TE>   Consistent with the Mitchell plan, Israeli settlement activity in
occupied territories must stop, and the occupation must end through
withdrawal to secure and recognized boundaries consistent with United
Nations Resolutions 242 and 338. Ultimately, this approach should be the
basis of agreements between Israel and Syria, and Israel and Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   Israel should also show a respect--a respect for and concern about the
dignity of the Palestinian people who are and will be their neighbors. It
is crucial to distinguish between the terrorists and ordinary
Palestinians seeking to provide for their own families. The Israeli
government should be compassionate at checkpoints and border crossings,
sparing innocent Palestinians daily humiliation.</TE>
<TE>   Israel should take immediate action to ease closures and allow
peaceful people to go back to work.</TE>
<TE>   Israel is facing a terrible and serious challenge. For seven days, it
has acted to rout out terrorists' nests. America recognizes Israel's
right to defend itself from terror.</TE>
<TE>   Yet to lay the foundations of future peace, I ask Israel to halt
incursions into Palestinian-controlled areas and begin the withdrawal
from those cities it has recently occupied.</TE>
<TE>   I speak as a committed friend of Israel. I speak out of a concern for
its long-term security, the security that will come with a genuine peace.</TE>
<TE>   As Israel steps back, responsible Palestinian leaders and Israel's
Arab neighbors must step forward and show the world that they are truly
on the side of peace. The choice and the burden will be theirs.</TE>
<TE>   The world expects an immediate cease-fire, immediate resumption of
security cooperation with Israel against terrorism and an immediate order
to crack down on terrorist networks. I expect better leadership, and I
expect results.</TE>
<TE>   These are the elements of peace in the Middle East, and now we must
build the road to those goals. Decades of bitter experience teach a clear
lesson: Progress is impossible when nations emphasize their grievances
and ignore their opportunities. The storms of violence cannot go on.
Enough is enough.</TE>
<TE>   And to those who would try to use the current crisis as an opportunity
to widen the conflict--stay out. Iran's arms shipments and support for
terror fuel the fire of conflict in the Middle East, and it must stop.
Syria has spoken out against Al Qaeda. We expect it to act against Hamas
and Hezbollah as well.</TE>
<TE>   It's time for Iran to focus on meeting its own people's aspirations
for freedom and for Syria to decide which side of the war against terror
it is on.</TE>
<TE>   The world finds itself at a critical moment. This is a conflict that
can widen or an opportunity we can seize.</TE>
<TE>   And so, I've decided to send Secretary of State [Colin L.] Powell to
the region next week, to seek broad international support for the vision
I've outlaid today.</TE>
<TE>   As a step in this process, he will work to implement United Nations
Resolution 1402--an immediate and meaningful cease-fire, an end to terror
and violence and incitement; withdrawal of Israeli troops from
Palestinian cities, including Ramallah; implementation of the already
agreed-upon Tenet and Mitchell plans, which will lead to a political
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   I have no illusions--we have no illusions--about the difficulty of the
issues that lay ahead. Yet our nation's resolve is strong. America is
committed to ending this conflict and beginning an era of peace.</TE>
<TE>   We know this is possible, because in our lifetimes, we have seen an
end to conflicts that no one thought could end. We've seen fierce enemies
let go of long histories of strife and anger. America itself counts
former adversaries as trusted friends--Germany and Japan and now Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Conflict is not inevitable. Distrust need not be permanent. Peace is
possible when we break free of old patterns and habits of hatred.</TE>
<TE>   The violence and grief that trouble the Holy Land have been among the
great tragedies of our time. The Middle East has often been left behind
in the political and economic advancement of the world. That is the
history of the region, but it need not--and must not--be its fate.</TE>
<TE>   The Middle East could write a new story of trade and development and
democracy. And we stand ready to help.</TE>
<TE>   Yet this progress can only come in an atmosphere of peace. And the
United States will work for all the children of Abraham to know the
benefits of peace.</TE>
<TE>   Thank you very much.</TE>

<DL>MANAGUA, Nicaragua
</DL>
<LD>The Nicaraguan attorney general's office filed charges Thursday
against former President Arnoldo Aleman and seven other officials for the
alleged misuse of $1.3 million in state funds.</LD>
<LD>   Special prosecutor Alberto Novoa said Aleman took part in a "plan to
defraud the government of Nicaragua." The former president has denied
wrongdoing, saying he gave key advisors total control over an ill-fated
television deal.</LD>
<LD>   The case centers around an allegedly irregular contract between
Channel 6 and a Panamanian company, Servicios Integrales Casco, which was
representing Mexico's TV Azteca.</LD>
<TE>   The October 2001 contract was supposed to allow Channel 6 to broadcast

<HD>Irish Lawyer to Investigate Alleged Sex Abuse by Catholic Clergy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DUBLIN, Ireland
</DL>
<LD>The government will appoint a lawyer to investigate allegations of
sexual abuse by Catholic clerics in southeastern Ireland, the health
minister announced Thursday after meeting with more than a dozen men and
women who reported being abused as children.</LD>
<LD>   Micheal Martin made his announcement after discussing with sex-abuse
victims plans for a full state inquiry into the unfolding scandals in the
Roman Catholic Church. The Cabinet member said George Birmingham, one of
Ireland's top lawyers, would have three months to present his findings,
which in turn could lead to an expanded inquiry led by a judge.</LD>
<LD>   Activists representing sex-abuse victims, standing beside Martin, said
they were pleased.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the best way to achieve what we all want: the full truth
coming out as to why the church protected abusers for so long and why
others in authority did not intervene," said Colm O'Gorman, one of
several people at the meeting who said he suffered years of abuse at the
hands of the Rev. Sean Fortune.</TE>
<TE>   Fortune committed suicide in 1999 shortly before he was to stand trial
on 66 criminal counts of molesting and raping boys over nearly two
decades. His was one of several such cases to emerge in Ireland in recent
years. His superior in southeastern Ireland, Bishop Brendan Comiskey,
resigned this week after admitting that he had not done enough to protect
children in his County Wexford diocese.</TE>
<TE>   O'Gorman said he expected Birmingham to investigate Wexford sex-abuse
cases involving Fortune and three other priests, including Donal Collins,
a former principal of the seminary where Fortune trained. Collins served
less than a year of a four-year sentence in 1999 after being convicted of
committing "gross indecency" on boys.</TE>
<TE>   Martin said the church's leaders would not be legally bound to answer
Birmingham's questions, but he predicted that they would "want to give
full cooperation."</TE>
<TE>   The government is already funding four judicial tribunals into
political scandals from the 1980s and '90s.</TE>
<TE>   The Catholic hierarchy in Ireland offered no immediate reaction but
earlier said bishops would hold an emergency conference within the next
few weeks to discuss the church's policies on deterring abuse by clergy.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, Bishop Donal Murray of Limerick in southwestern Ireland
announced that he had given to police reports of sexual abuse involving
priests in his diocese.</TE>
<TE>   Church leaders in this overwhelmingly Catholic country have been
struggling to come to grips with sex-abuse scandals since the mid-1990s,
when several cases of priests molesting children--in some cases for
decades without being punished--were exposed.</TE>
<TE>   In hopes of deterring class-action lawsuits, the church in January
negotiated a compensation deal with the government.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal, thousands of people who were abused in church-run
schools and orphanages from the 1950s onward would be eligible for hefty
payments, but only if they dropped their own lawsuits. The church pledged
to contribute about $110 million, mostly in property, to a government-run
compensation board. The total payout is projected to run four times that.</TE>

<HD>Captive Is Likely a U.S. Citizen, Pentagon Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Pentagon officials said Thursday they are all but certain that a
22-year-old detainee from the Afghan war being held in Cuba is a U.S.
citizen, and they are considering turning him over to federal law
enforcement authorities.</LD>
<LD>   The captive, identified as Yasser Esam Hamdi, was seized during a late
November prison uprising in Afghanistan, as was John Walker Lindh of
Northern California.</LD>
<LD>   But while Lindh was readily identified as an American citizen, U.S.
military officials have just confirmed that Hamdi was born in November
1979 in Louisiana and then taken as a toddler to Saudi Arabia when his
parents returned to their home country.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said it is possible that Hamdi eventually could be flown out
of Camp X-Ray at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay and turned over to
federal authorities on the U.S. mainland to determine if, like Lindh, he
should be prosecuted. Lindh, who fought for the Taliban, is scheduled to
stand trial in August on murder conspiracy charges. He faces a maximum
sentence of life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   While it quickly became clear in Lindh's case that he was a U.S.
citizen, authorities were not immediately convinced when Hamdi protested
that he too was an American, born in Baton Rouge.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Department of Justice came up with a Louisiana birth
certificate with a name and birth date that matched those Hamdi had
given.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our understanding that his parents were employed in Louisiana
when he was born and returned to Saudi Arabia within a very few years,"
Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said. "A lot of these things will be
worked through. But it does just point to how unconventional this war is
in many ways."</TE>
<TE>   As a U.S. citizen, Hamdi would not be subjected to a military
tribunal, which could be conducted for other prisoners being held in Cuba
and Afghanistan. Rather, because President Bush mandated that no American
citizens be tried by military commissions, Hamdi probably would be
prosecuted in the federal court system if the Justice Department deems it
appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "We think he will have American citizenship," Clarke said.</TE>
<TE>   But, she added, "it's way too soon to speculate on what he may or may
not be charged with. The one thing we can say, [as an] American citizen
he would not be considered a candidate for a military commission."</TE>
<TE>   Clarke added that military authorities are continuing with "further
questionings and interrogations" of Hamdi.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Sierra, a Justice Department spokesman, said what lies ahead for
Hamdi if he is turned over to the department's jurisdiction is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not in our custody and will not be in the immediate future,"
Sierra said.</TE>
<TE>   In Baton Rouge, some members of the Islamic community said they could
not recall the Hamdi family.</TE>
<TE>   "All the guys who are old in this community, and the director of the
Islamic Center here, and brothers who are older than me in this community
. . . nobody remembers them," said Abed Mubarak, a religious leader.</TE>

<HD>N.H. Teen Killers Sentenced</HD>
<DH>Courts: Both receive long terms in deaths of Dartmouth professors.
They turned to crime because they were bored.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HAVERHILL, N.H.
</DL>
<LD>Two teenage boys who killed Dartmouth College professors Half and
Susanne Zantop received long prison sentences Thursday, ending a tragedy
that had terrorized a calm campus community and, in its gruesomeness,
startled a nation.</LD>
<LD>   The hearing sent 18-year-old Robert Tulloch to prison for life, with
no possibility of parole. James Parker, 17, will spend 25 years to life
behind bars.</LD>
<LD>   The proceeding in a small county courthouse here gave prosecutors
their first opportunity to outline the grisly saga of a pair of high
school students who grew restless with rural Vermont and struck out to
make their fortunes by robbing and killing people.</LD>
<TE>   In an emotional appearance before the court, the Zantops' adult
daughters also used the occasion to make their first public remarks about
their parents' brutal slayings.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no statement in the entire world that can capture the
absolute horror, disbelief, pain, sadness and anger that my sister, my
family and friends have experienced since the murders," 29-year-old
Veronika Zantop, a Seattle physician, told the court. As her voice
quavered, her 27-year-old sister, Marianne, a human rights worker, gently
stroked her back.</TE>
<TE>   In their courtroom demeanor, the two defendants stood in dramatic
contrast. Tulloch, reversing his initial plea of insanity, was steely.
The tall, lanky teenager, a former student council president, stared
straight ahead and declared himself guilty in the deaths of both
acclaimed academics.</TE>
<TE>   Parker shuddered with sobs after acknowledging his guilty plea in the
killing of Susanne Zantop. Because his hands were manacled, he could not
wipe the tears from his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry," he finally stammered. "There's not much more I can say
than that. I'm just really sorry."</TE>
<TE>   Parker, who cast frequent frightened glances Thursday in the direction
of his parents, provided key information that solved the nagging mystery
of why two Vermont high school students would take the lives of two
professors they had never met or even heard of. His sentence was reduced
in exchange for his plea.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Assistant State's Atty. Kelly Ayotte who mesmerized the
court as she outlined the plot two best friends hatched to murder for
money, then trade the predictability of tiny Chelsea, Vt., for a life of
adventure in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   "They were bored in Chelsea," Ayotte explained.</TE>
<TE>   In painful and occasionally bizarre detail, Ayotte then told the story
she would have presented had the case gone to trial.</TE>
<TE>   The youths hoped to steal $10,000 to finance their new life, Ayotte
said. They discussed identity theft, credit card fraud and even tried
stealing an all-terrain vehicle. They were impatient; they wanted the
money fast.</TE>
<TE>   Tulloch, according to Parker's statements, decided the pair should try
assaulting people in order to steal their credit and bank cards. He
decreed it best to kill the victims, so there would be no witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in black, Tulloch, the honor student, and Parker, the class
clown, dug a hole in a field near a house in Vermont, planning to bury
the owners after they made off with their cash. They were foiled when the
owner came to the door carrying a gun.</TE>
<TE>   Next they went to the Internet to purchase stun guns. But Tulloch's
mother found them and sent the guns back.</TE>
<TE>   Again they went online to buy military-style knives. Their forays in
their home state having failed, they came up with the idea that people in
nearby Hanover, N.H., the idyllic home of Dartmouth, had plenty of money.
So they strapped their weapons to their legs and set off for a village
then that had seen just two murders in 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Time and again, the youths struck out. Then, posing as college
students conducting an environmental survey, they knocked on the door of
Half and Susanne Zantop.</TE>
<TE>   The 62-year-old Earth sciences professor and his 55-year-old wife, who
was chairwoman of Dartmouth's German department, were "random victims,"
Ayotte said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   After slitting their victims' throats, Tulloch and Parker washed their
hands and their knives in the snow. Then they went to a bookstore to read
up on how people deal with killing, especially soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   A guest invited for dinner found the Zantops dead in their cozy study.</TE>
<TE>   Tulloch and Parker, meanwhile, realized they had left key evidence:
the sheaths for their knives. They discussed their next step, Ayotte
said, concluding they could kill a police officer if that became
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Using $340 from Half Zantop's wallet, they twice fled their hometown.
They made it first to St. Louis before running out of nerve and returning
to Chelsea, a hamlet of 1,300 about 25 miles from Hanover. Calling
themselves Sam and Tyler, they escaped a second time, hitching rides with
truckers. They were arrested three weeks after the killings in New
Castle, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a house of cards," Tulloch stated to authorities in Indiana. "It
took me years to build, and I just blew it down."</TE>
<TE>   To his friend and partner in crime, he repeatedly said, "I'm sorry,
Jim."</TE>
<TE>   In court Thursday, Tulloch made no such concession to contrition. His
lawyers said he was pleading guilty against their advice. Offered the
opportunity to address the court after receiving two concurrent sentences
of life in prison without possibility of parole, Tulloch remained silent.</TE>
<TE>   But he was forced to listen as Irene Kacandes, a professor of German
at Dartmouth, recalled how her friends the Zantops helped everyone they
met. Victims of their own good-heartedness, the Zantops freely opened
their doors to strangers--including the two mock college students who
took their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "You had a choice on Jan. 27, 2001," Kacandes admonished. "Susanne and
Half Zantop did not."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Veronika Zantop explained that her German-born father's name
translated to "help" and that he made it his mission to live up to that
name.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Harry Beskind, a psychiatrist in Hanover, said
he attended Thursday's proceedings to "bear witness" to his friends'
deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "We like to try to explain everything, whether the explanations are
true or not," Beskind said. "We all have these fancy theories, but I
don't think they're worth very much in a case like this."</TE>
<TE>   Along with two beloved academics, a sense of innocence that permeated
the Dartmouth community was lost on Jan. 27, 2001, Beskind said. "Hanover
was a piece of America that was apart from the overall reality," he said,
noting that many residents seldom locked doors before the Zantops were
killed. Now, he said, a feeling of "shock, dismay and impotent rage"
hovers over the city.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the courtroom, Tulloch's family was as taciturn as the young
man who will now spend his life behind bars. James Parker's parents,
however, paused briefly to speak to a small crowd gathered outside the
courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope that over time," Joan Parker said, "those hurt by these acts
will be able to find peace in their hearts, and forgiveness."</TE>

<HD>Airport Unveils Faster, Safer Passenger Check</HD>
<DH>Security: The new screening system at a Maryland concourse is
designed to curb gridlock and improve weapon detection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LINTHICUM, Md.
</DL>
<LD>The government unveiled Thursday its model airport passenger
checkpoint, designed to prevent gridlock this summer as flights are
expected to return to near-normal levels and security screening duties
switch from private to federal employees.</LD>
<LD>   The prototype, now operating at a concourse of the
Baltimore-Washington International Airport, is better organized and more
closely contained and controlled than a typical checkpoint, officials
say. It features detectors that can't be unplugged, special enclosures
for passengers who require more scrutiny and electric gates that can be
quickly closed if there is a security problem.</LD>
<LD>   Hans Miller, a project manager for the Transportation Security
Administration, the new federal agency charged with overseeing airport
security, said the new approach offers measurable improvements in
efficiency and weapon detection. The model will be phased in at other
airports beginning this spring.</LD>
<TE>   By summer, the transition to federal security screeners at 429
airports will be in full swing to meet a Nov. 19 deadline for deploying
federal screeners. If security isn't streamlined, industry analysts warn
that summer travel could become a maddening experience.</TE>
<TE>   "Prior to Sept. 11, there were runway bottlenecks. Now [the
bottleneck] is security," John Hansman, director of MIT's air
transportation center, said at a recent conference. "Delays to airplanes
have gone down, but delays to passengers have gone way up. We have
terminal evacuations competing with weather as a key unpredictable cause
of delays."</TE>
<TE>   Since Oct. 30, there have been at least 156 concourse evacuations,
according to Federal Aviation Administration statistics. Of those, 62
ordered by federal authorities delayed at least 1,520 flights.</TE>
<TE>   Air traffic has now rebounded to about 90% of its pre-Sept. 11 levels.
And delays, after remaining essentially flat all winter, increased about
40% from February to March.</TE>
<TE>   TSA's Miller said the agency believes it can reduce delays and improve
security by paying close attention to the details. In designing the new
checkpoint, planners first broke down the screening process into
individual steps, then tried to reassemble them in a better framework.</TE>
<TE>   A single, serpentine line approaching the checkpoint makes it easier
to direct passengers to an open metal detector. Metal detectors and X-ray
machines are being wired to an electric power source in the ceiling. That
prevents them from being unplugged and triggering an evacuation, as has
occurred at Los Angeles International and other airports. An express lane
is available for flight crews, people in wheelchairs and families with
big strollers. Flat-screen monitors display security tips to passengers
in line to speed their processing.</TE>
<TE>   The sensitive issue of "wanding" passengers became a special focus,
Miller added. Passengers who set off a metal detector are scanned using a
hand-held wand only by a screener of the same gender. The screening takes
place in a glass enclosure next to the metal detectors and X-ray machines
so the passenger can keep an eye on carry-on bags and other travelers
will not be delayed. A station has been set up to X-ray passengers'
shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said the new setup reduced waiting time at the concourse
checkpoint from more than 20 minutes to under 12. The checkpoint can
handle 850 passengers an hour, compared with 500 previously. About 40% of
the extra passenger capacity was attributed to the addition of a fifth
security lane to the four that were already in place.</TE>
<TE>   The time devoted to wanding has also been reduced, from about 3 1/2
minutes per passenger to an average of one minute.</TE>
<TE>   Officials were less specific about improvements in security. "We
believe this checkpoint is much stronger," Miller said. "There have been
a number of stops and arrests for knives and one for a gun." He said TSA
special agents evaluated the checkpoint and found it more secure.
However, Miller would not say whether any independent agency had
conducted tests.</TE>
<TE>   Some airline industry officials said the new checkpoint design appears
promising. However, Michael Wascom, a spokesman for the Air Transport
Assn., said TSA still needs to move ahead with a "trusted traveler"
program that would exempt passengers who agree to a background check from
multiple levels of screening.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocate David Stempler of the Air Travelers Assn. said that
the prototype is an improvement but that separating passengers who must
undergo wanding from their carry-on items is problematic.</TE>
<TE>   The public is showing patience with the government's efforts to revamp
airport security, polls show. In a CBS poll taken in January, nearly 88%
of travelers who said they had been delayed by new security measures felt
the delays were necessary. Another CBS survey in February found that 89%
of passengers would be willing to undergo more intrusive bag checks and
searches.</TE>

<HD>Report Details FBI's Security Failings and Missed Spy Signals</HD>
<DH>Intelligence: Webster panel tells of violation of a presidential
order and the ease with which agent Hanssen eluded capture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The FBI failed to properly restrict about 500 sensitive cases,
violated a presidential order requiring financial disclosures from
employees and missed repeated warning signals that could have led to the
arrest of spy Robert Philip Hanssen years earlier, according to a
comprehensive review of the case released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "As shocking as the depth of Hanssen's betrayal," the Webster
commission said in its 117-page report, "is the ease with which he was
able to steal material he has described as 'tremendously useful' . . . to
hostile foreign powers."</LD>
<LD>   The commission's long-awaited assessment of the Hanssen case--the most
damaging episode of espionage in FBI history--ratcheted up demands for an
overhaul of the culture and management practices at the nation's premier
law enforcement agency.</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said the findings of the blue-ribbon panel led by former FBI
and CIA Director William H. Webster represent "an indictment of the
failure of FBI leadership over the years to pay attention to security."</TE>
<TE>   Although FBI Director Robert Mueller has promised to make security a
priority in the wake of the Hanssen scandal, Leahy said the Webster
report should push Congress to mandate wide-scale changes on its own,
including the expanded use of polygraphs on employees. Leahy's committee
begins hearings on the issue next week.</TE>
<TE>   Hanssen, a counterintelligence agent at the FBI for a quarter-century,
was arrested in February 2001, minutes after he left a batch of stolen
secret documents for his Russian handlers at a park near his home in
suburban Washington. He later pleaded guilty to espionage charges in a
deal that spared him the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   The Webster report chronicles Hanssen's 22-year career as a spy
beginning in 1979, when he walked into a New York City company run by a
Soviet military officer and dropped off a classified document containing
information about the FBI's penetration of a Soviet residential complex.</TE>
<TE>   Hanssen received $20,000 for this and two other early "drops," the
report said, and he told investigators for the Webster commission that
the money was his motivation. He said the mounting financial pressures of
house payments in the New York City area, following his reassignment from
Indianapolis, and later of putting six children through parochial school
created "an atmosphere of desperation" that led him to become a spy.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to get a little money and get out of it," he told the
commission.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hanssen said he could have been an even more "devastating
spy" if he had wanted, he acknowledged responsibility for the damage he
did. "[T]here is no way that I can justify what I have done. It's
criminal and deceitful and wrong and sinful," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While Hanssen's damage to national security has been well chronicled,
the Webster commission appeared to give an assessment even more sobering
than past analyses. It concluded that Hanssen compromised more than 50
technical operations, potential recruits and double agents, including
several agents the Russians killed after discovering they were working
for the Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The 6,000 pages of documents and 26 computer diskettes that Hanssen
sold the Russians in about 40 handoffs detailed "extraordinarily
sensitive intelligence operations," including the FBI's technical
penetration of a Soviet establishment, penetration of Soviet satellite
transmissions, U.S. attempts to recruit Soviet intelligence officers, a
limitation in the National Security Agency's ability to read Soviet
communications, budget projections and a detailed evaluation of U.S.
double-agent operations, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The review found that the FBI missed numerous telltale signals that
could have led to Hanssen's detection, including his inconsistent
explanations of how he paid for an expensive home addition.</TE>
<TE>   The report found that the FBI's case-file system, chock-full of
sensitive information on ongoing investigations, can be easily accessed
by unauthorized employees and fails to comply with the bureau's own
requirements for restricting secret data.</TE>
<TE>   "Hanssen took advantage of this security failure to access
approximately 500 case files that had not been appropriately restricted,"
the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Hanssen told the commission that a diligent check of his financial
affairs might well have uncovered his espionage work much earlier.</TE>
<TE>   But the commission concluded that the FBI has been routinely violating
a presidential order that, in the wake of the Aldrich H. Ames spy scandal
at the CIA in 1994, requires federal employees with access to classified
information to consent to disclosure of finances.</TE>
<TE>   "With the exception of certain senior personnel and members of the
Senior Executive Service, the bureau does not require employees or
contractors to complete a financial disclosure form," and the basic
information that is required is often of little real value, the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   The commission recommended several dozen fundamental changes in the
way the FBI maintains security, including the expanded use of polygraph
tests for employees, the restriction of information on a "need to know"
basis and the restructuring of security operations.</TE>
<TE>   The recommendations range from the highly technical to the
rudimentary. For instance, the report recommends that "classified
information should be placed face-down when persons not authorized access
are nearby."</TE>
<TE>   Mueller, who has already put in place a CIA security specialist to
oversee the make-over, said in an statement Thursday that he welcomes
such a change. "We must capitalize on this historic opportunity to make
badly needed improvements."</TE>

<HD>Spinal Disorder Therapy Identified</HD>
<DH>Study: German team says infliximab, an immune blocker, is first
effective treatment for anklyosing spondylitis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>German researchers have identified the first effective therapy for
anklyosing spondylitis, a degenerative spinal disorder that affects more
than 300,000 Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The team found that the immune blocker infliximab--already used for
treating rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease--sharply reduced
disease symptoms in 53% of patients with the disorder and produced at
least some improvement in 80%.</LD>
<LD>   The only current treatments for AS, as it is known, are aspirin and
similar drugs and physical therapy, said Dr. Jurgen Braun of the German
Rheumatism Research Centre in Berlin. "We would just watch the patient
getting stiffer all the time. Now there seems to be something really
working strongly."</LD>
<TE>   AS varies in severity from intermittent episodes of back pain to a
severe chronic disease that attacks the spine, peripheral joints and
other organs, resulting in severe stiffness, loss of motion and
deformity.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery, reported in this week's issue of Lancet, "is important
because people don't often do studies with this disease," said Dr. Jack
Klippel, medical director of the Arthritis Foundation. "This is a major
form of arthritis for which there are no officially approved therapies."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate study in the same journal, a team from the University of
Kansas School of Medicine reported that the arthritis drug methotrexate
can prevent premature death in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which
afflicts about 1% of the population.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we can begin to think of drug therapy in several realms," Klippel
said. "It improves the signs and symptoms of arthritis, it prevents
damage to joints and limits disability, and now for the first time we
have evidence that it can prolong life."</TE>
<TE>   Both anklyosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis are autoimmune
diseases in which, for reasons that are not fully explained, the immune
system attacks a person's body. In AS, the disease attacks primarily the
spine and the sacroiliac. In rheumatoid arthritis, it attacks joints
throughout the body. Both disorders can cause damage to other organs as
well, especially the heart, and people with rheumatoid arthritis tend to
die about 10 years earlier than their healthy peers.</TE>
<TE>   Rheumatoid arthritis is more likely to affect females than males, by a
ratio of about 3 to 1, while AS strikes males in about the same ratio.
Rheumatoid arthritis strikes in middle age, while AS hits men at around
age 26.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, researchers have identified a common thread in
several arthritic diseases: the role of an immune system chemical called
tumor necrosis factor, or TNF-alpha. Overproduction of TNF-alpha leads to
inflammation, producing many of the symptoms of the disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Infliximab, trade-named Remicade, is designed to bind to TNF-alpha in
the bloodstream and remove it from circulation. A combination of
infliximab and methotrexate, which also suppresses inflammation, is now
the most common treatment for advanced rheumatoid arthritis. A similar
drug called etanercept, trade-named Enbrel, works in the same way.</TE>
<TE>   Braun and his colleagues studied 34 AS patients who received
infliximab and 35 who received a placebo. Improvement in patients
receiving the drug became apparent in as little as two weeks and was
obvious after a month, even though they didn't know which patients were
receiving the drug, Braun said.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of three months, 18 of the patients receiving infliximab
had at least a 50% reduction in symptoms, compared with only three of
those receiving the placebo.</TE>
<TE>   About 30% of the patients also suffered from peripheral arthritis, a
complication of AS, he said. Among those receiving the drug, "that went
away very quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Braun conceded that "we still don't know how this will work in the
long term. But in the short term, we now have data for some patients for
one year, and we think this is a very good therapy."</TE>
<TE>   In the rheumatoid arthritis study, Dr. Frederick Wolfe and his Kansas
colleagues studied 1,240 people who were seen at an arthritis clinic
between January 1981 and December 1999. Of those, 588 of the sickest
received treatment with methotrexate. (Infliximab was not approved until
1998.)</TE>
<TE>   Over the follow-up period, 72 of the patients receiving methotrexate
died, as did 119 of those not receiving the drug. Taking into account
that those receiving methotrexate were sicker to begin with, Wolfe
concluded that those receiving the drug were 60% less likely to die
prematurely than those not receiving it. They were 70% less likely to die
of heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said that the findings were suggestive but not conclusive
because other factors might have played a role in the drug group's
survival. A more definitive study would randomly assign patients to
receive either the drug or a placebo, and that was not done in this case.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Klippel said, there has not been any previous study that
asked whether treatment can prolong survival. "Now the answer is clearly
yes."</TE>

<HD>Fuel Leak Postpones Shuttle Launch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>A leak of highly flammable hydrogen fuel at the launch pad forced
NASA to postpone space shuttle Atlantis' liftoff Thursday until Sunday at
the earliest.</LD>
<LD>   The fuel spewed from a broken pipe for a minute, but the white cloud
dissipated and did not pose any danger, launch director Mike Leinbach
said.</LD>
<LD>   The pad already had been evacuated for the hazardous fueling
operation, and the shuttle was dozens of feet from the leak. The seven
astronauts were hours from boarding Atlantis and had not begun to suit
up.</LD>
<TE>   "We didn't ever consider this a threat to the vehicle," Leinbach said.</TE>
<TE>   NASA officials said Atlantis' liftoff on a space station construction
mission will be delayed until at least Sunday so the leak 37 feet above
the pad can be repaired. Atlantis had been scheduled to lift off Thursday
afternoon with the newest piece of the space station: an elaborate
44-foot girder.</TE>
<TE>   An engineer spotted the leak and the fueling was immediately halted
about an hour after it had begun.</TE>
<TE>   A weld on the 16-inch-diameter aluminum pipe cracked, apparently from
the shock of cold fuel, Leinbach said. The pipes and their welds date to
at least the 1980s, and age is believed to have contributed to the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Technicians will put a clamshell-like clamp over the quarter-inch
crack, which covers almost the entire circumference of the pipe. NASA
will not inspect other welds in the line, Leinbach said.</TE>
<TE>   "This mobile launcher has gone through 80-some tankings and has
performed perfectly fine, so we do not feel we have a generic problem
with all of our welds out there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The leak did not occur in the plumbing that feeds liquid hydrogen into
the shuttle's big external tank but in a line that vents fuel vapors from
the tank, making it easier and quicker to make repairs, NASA officials
said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Using television ads and billboards, the city will launch a
multimillion-dollar effort to diversify its predominantly white, male
fire department, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   White men make up more than 93% of the Fire Department of New York's
11,112-member force, according to figures from December. The department
has 300 blacks, 374 Latinos and 30 women.</LD>
<LD>   "Clearly, we have a long way to go," Fire Commissioner Nicholas
Scoppetta said during a City Council committee hearing this week.</LD>
<TE>   The department has hired 620 firefighters since Sept. 11. Twelve of
the 343 firefighters who died Sept. 11 were black, another 12 were Latino
and all were men.</TE>
<TE>   Scoppetta said the department would spend several million dollars in
government and private funds on the effort to hire more women and
minorities as firefighters. The program will be launched as early as
June.</TE>
<TE>   The message would be carried on television and billboards and by
organizations such as the Urban League and the Harlem Chamber of
Commerce. Firefighters would distribute posters, fliers and other
information at colleges, churches and high schools, Scoppetta said.</TE>
<TE>   Theodore Holmes, president of the International Assn. of Black
Professional Firefighters, favors any program to increase diversity but
said minority recruiting campaigns can fail if they are not constantly

<HD>EPA Resists Pentagon's Effort to Loosen Pollution Restrictions</HD>
<DH>Environment: Defense officials want a freer hand to conduct
training exercises, in the name of military readiness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>For years, environmental restrictions have limited the military's
use of low-altitude training flights over certain lands that harbor
endangered species.</LD>
<LD>   And just recently, the Interior Department told the Army that it could
use the California desert to prepare its troops for Afghanistan only if
exercises were conducted during daylight and on roads.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon had hoped that in George W. Bush, it had found a
president who would lift these kinds of environmental restrictions in the
name of national security.</LD>
<TE>   But now it could find itself locked in a bureaucratic battle with the
Environmental Protection Agency, whose career staff has prepared for
trench warfare against what it views as the Defense Department's assault
on long-standing environmental rules and laws.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the Defense Department has circulated to other
federal agencies a draft of legislation that would waive provisions of a
host of environmental laws for training exercises and other so-called
readiness activities.</TE>
<TE>   But career specialists at the EPA, in a briefing paper for
Administrator Christie Whitman, criticized each Pentagon waiver request
related to pollution laws.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, one Pentagon suggestion would exclude munitions,
explosives and other weapons from the list of pollutants governed by the
Clean Water Act.</TE>
<TE>   "The change to the definition of 'pollutant' under the draft bill is a
broad change that could affect many sites and have far-reaching effects,"
the EPA staff said in the briefing paper, a copy of which was obtained by
The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA staff stressed that environmental laws already provide
mechanisms to exempt the military for reasons of national security or
emergency.</TE>
<TE>   EPA spokesman Joe Martyak confirmed that the agency had been
exchanging views with the Pentagon over the issue, but he would not give
details about the EPA's comments. He stressed that the EPA had not
finalized its responses to the Defense Department's proposals.</TE>
<TE>   In a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee last month, one
top military official after another complained about the threat to
military readiness caused by environmental regulations.</TE>
<TE>   That committee plans to move legislation addressing the problems this
spring, according to Sarah Shelden, spokeswoman for the committee's
chairman, Rep. Joel Hefley (R-Colo.). It is waiting for suggestions from
the military services before drafting its legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has not shared its draft bill with Hefley or his
committee staff, Shelden said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials refused to comment on the draft document and would
not say whether it reflected current thinking at the Pentagon. Speaking
on National Public Radio on Wednesday, Paul Mayberry, deputy
undersecretary of Defense for readiness, said he had been working with
other agencies on an administration proposal but stressed that no final
legislative package had yet received the Pentagon's approval.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the draft document and EPA's staff comments gave at least
an indication of the Defense Department's effort to rein in an array of
environmental laws through one sweeping bill.</TE>
<TE>   The draft legislation, titled "Sustained Defense Readiness and
Environmental Protection Act" and dated March 7, stressed that the
expansion of federal and state environmental laws together with urban
sprawl "has markedly restricted the military's ability to train
realistically."</TE>
<TE>   This "encroachment has already negatively affected military readiness
and will continue to erode it unless this trend is reversed," the draft
legislation stated.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA staff was particularly concerned about a Pentagon proposal
that would prevent states from prohibiting military readiness activities
that violated their air quality plans.</TE>
<TE>   Such a change could "force the states to take more stringent measures
against private industry polluters in order to reach [Clean Air Act]
ambient air quality standards," according to the EPA briefing document.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's staff was also concerned that the EPA might not be able
to protect human health and the environment if Defense Department
munitions and training ranges were broadly exempted from regulations
under the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act,
as called for in the Pentagon's draft legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Some congressional aides said that the Armed Services Committee is
likely to embrace a reasonable proposal from the Pentagon to reduce
infringements on training exercises.</TE>
<TE>   "We would hope to see a small list of common-sense tweaks to
laws--some of which are 100 years old," said Bill Johnson, legislative
director for Rep. James V. Hansen (R-Utah), an influential member of the
Armed Services Committee and chairman of the Resources Committee. "We're
unlikely to give them blanket exemptions."</TE>

<HD>Postal Service Says No More Rate Hikes Until '04</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>With mail rates set to rise in June, the cash-strapped U.S. Postal
Service is pledging no further rate increases until 2004 under a
restructuring plan expected to be unveiled today.</LD>
<LD>   An executive summary of the U.S. Postal Service Transformation Plan
obtained by Reuters shows the post office envisions $5 billion in cost
cuts over the next four years and wants Congress to allow post office
closings as needed.</LD>
<LD>   The postal service also said it would continue to press for
legislative reform that would allow for quick postal price adjustments to
reflect seasonal volumes and demand.</LD>
<TE>   The Postal Service said it would also favor moving to a more
commercial model that stops short of private ownership but includes more
streamlined operations, including automation of mail forwarding.</TE>
<TE>   Postmaster General John Potter was scheduled to unveil the full plan,
to be presented to Congress, at the National Press Club today.</TE>
<TE>   In the summary of the plan, the agency said it faces uncertainty, in
part because of electronic mail and bill payments.</TE>
<TE>   A recent congressional report warned that the agency's financial
outlook is "increasingly dire" because of declining mail volumes and
rising costs.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's basic business model is not sustainable, according to the
General Accounting Office report.</TE>
<TE>   The post office lost $1.7 billion in fiscal 2001, which ended Sept.
30, as mail volume declined for the first time in a decade after an
economic slump and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Post offices were further hit by the discovery of anthrax-laced
letters sent through the mail.</TE>
<TE>   The Postal Service, which delivers more than 40% of the world's mail,
has said it wants to raise the price of a first-class stamp to 37 cents
from 34 cents. The increase must be approved by the independent Postal
Rate Commission.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the postal service increased the price of a first-class stamp
for the first time in four years, to 33 cents. A year later, it raised
the price to 34 cents.</TE>
<TE>   The post office is mandated to cover operating costs but not
necessarily turn a profit. It has not received any tax dollars for
operating expenses since 1982.</TE>
<TE>   The government agency presented several business models for its future
but said it favors a "commercialization" option that would stop short of
private ownership.</TE>

<HD>Baptists Call for Boycott of Hotel Chain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS
</DL>
<LD>The Southern Baptist Convention said Thursday it will urge members
to boycott Howard Johnson hotels during its annual meeting because of one
hotel's plans to host what the convention called a "private sex bash."</LD>
<LD>   The Baptist group was referring to the three-day "Beat Me in St.
Louis" seminar being held at a Howard Johnson hotel April 26-28 by St.
Louis Leather &amp; Lace.</LD>
<LD>   Leather &amp; Lace's Web site said it endorses "free expression of
alternative lifestyles and forms of loving," including bondage,
domination and sadomasochism, regardless of sexual orientation.</LD>
<TE>   The Baptist Convention--the nation's largest Protestant group, with
101,000 clergy--canceled its June reservations in a letter to hotel
officials Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear how many rooms were pre-booked, but convention-goers
were expected to reserve 4,000 hotel rooms citywide during its two-day
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Wilkerson, who wrote the letter on behalf of the Baptists, called
the Leather &amp; Lace meeting a "direct attack on the fabric of traditional
family values and the biblical heritage of our denomination and its
churches."</TE>
<TE>   "The SBC does not feel comfortable recommending other Howard Johnson
locations for future meetings," according to a church statement released
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Messages left for the manager of the hotel that will host the Leather
&amp; Lace seminar were not immediately returned.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Johnson hotels are franchised and individually owned.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the hotels' New Jersey-based parent corporation,
Cendant, said it does not interfere with guest-related decisions as long
as the site remains law-abiding.</TE>
<TE>   Leather &amp; Lace representatives did not respond to e-mailed requests
for comment.</TE>

<HD>Priest Accused of Abuse Dies in Apparent Suicide</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND
</DL>
<LD>A Roman Catholic priest under investigation for child molestation
died Thursday of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head,
church officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Father Don A. Rooney, 48, who was reported missing the day before by
church officials, was found by a police officer slumped over in his car
shortly before noon in the parking lot of a CVS Pharmacy in Hinckley,
Ohio. He was taken by helicopter to a medical center in nearby Cleveland
but was dead on arrival.</LD>
<LD>   The apparent suicide of a priest marks the latest in an escalating
crisis for the U.S. Catholic Church, which has grappled with allegations
of long-ignored sexual abuse of children by priests in many of its
dioceses. Cleveland Bishop Anthony Pilla, criticized in recent weeks for
failing to act quickly when allegations of abuse were made against
priests in his diocese, had moved aggressively to change the perception
that he was doing too little.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, Pilla suspended a 40-year priest on the basis of a single
allegation.</TE>
<TE>   Rooney came under scrutiny Monday when a woman reported to the diocese
that the priest had sexually abused her 22 years ago when she was still a
minor--the first such allegation against him, according to church
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Rooney was assigned to Sacred Heart in Wadsworth, Ohio, in the
Cleveland area, at the time of the alleged abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Rooney, a lifelong area resident, was ordained in 1979. He previously
had served at St. Anthony of Padua in Parma, Ohio, a working-class suburb
just across the city line.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Tayek, a spokesman for the Diocese of Cleveland, said Rooney's
death shocked church officials, who had been urgently trying to locate
him since he missed a Wednesday morning meeting with Pilla.</TE>
<TE>   "Our bishop simply told me our concern at the moment is for the tragic
death of a priest and for a grieving mother and family," Tayek said late
Thursday. "And our continuing concern is for the alleged victim who made
this allegation."</TE>
<TE>   Tayek said church officials had tried to reach Rooney on Monday at the
church rectory when the allegations were first made. Informing a priest
promptly about an allegation against him has been official church policy
here since 1989, Tayek said.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials spoke to Rooney on Tuesday, summoning him to a
meeting the next day at the diocese offices. He was not told the reason
for the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   When Rooney did not show up Wednesday, church officials grew alarmed,
calling a family member to help find him.</TE>
<TE>   But they also moved ahead with the investigation, alerting Cuyahoga
County Child Protective Services of the allegations, as well as local law
enforcement officials in Wadsworth, where the alleged abuse took place.
When the family member could not find Rooney, church officials filed a
missing person report with the Parma police.</TE>
<TE>   "After we made the attempt to meet with him, we felt it necessary to
follow through with our procedures when such allegations are made," Tayek
said.</TE>
<TE>   The church in this heavily Catholic region has been under pressure
from its members, as well as local media, to do more to help those who
said they were molested by priests. The Plain Dealer in Cleveland last
month printed a multi-part series on the Diocese of Cleveland's record in
such matters, painting an unflattering portrait.</TE>
<TE>   Before the allegations against Rooney were made public, Pilla had
warned this week that new cases should be expected.</TE>
<TE>   He told the local Fox television affiliate Wednesday that he had
failed to do enough to comfort victims, saying that if he was "ever
convinced that it would be better for the church for someone else to be
bishop of the diocese," he would resign.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday evening at the Parma parish, where Rooney was known for
organizing skate parties for children and taking an active role in
parishioners' lives, several cellophane-wrapped bouquets had been placed
against the rectory door.</TE>
<TE>   "Father Don, we will miss you," read one card. "Love, your friends."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by a mother and three siblings, church officials said.</TE>

<HD>Mahony E-Mail Talks of 'Our Big Mistake'</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Archdiocese unsuccessfully seeks to block
publication of messages in which he criticizes failure to give names
to police.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of the Los Angeles Archdiocese told one of
his lawyers in a recent e-mail that the diocese made "our big
mistake" by not turning over three cases involving priests accused of
wrongdoing to the LAPD, according to e-mails obtained Thursday by the
Los Angeles Times.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a huge mistake on our part," Mahony wrote in an e-mail
dated March 27. "If we don't, today, 'consult' with the Det[ective]
about those 3 names, I can guarantee you that I will get hauled into
a Grand Jury proceeding and I will be forced to give all the names,
etc."</LD>
<LD>   Since The Times reported that Mahony had released between six and
12 priests accused of sexual misconduct, the archdiocese has declined
to say precisely how many priests overall have been implicated in the
scandal.</LD>
<TE>   For the first time, the e-mails suggest that the actual number is
eight.</TE>
<TE>   "If I recall, of the 8 priests involved, 5 have already been
reported to local law enforcement agencies," Mahony wrote. "That
leaves 3."</TE>
<TE>   That and other e-mails emerged at the center of an extraordinary
legal debate late Thursday night, as a lawyer for the archdiocese
sought to prevent publication of e-mails between Mahony and his
lawyer pertaining to the sexual misconduct of priests.</TE>
<TE>   But Judge David Yaffe refused to grant the petition of Sister
Judith Ann Murphy, Mahony's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I don't think the Constitution permits me to do,"
Yaffe said in a ruling handed down just before midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Donald H. Steier, attorney for the archdiocese, said that the
e-mails were protected by attorney-client privilege.</TE>
<TE>   A terrible harm would be inflicted upon the archdiocese by
publishing the documents, he argued, while there was no harm at all
in asking the paper to wait a few days before publication.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether or not it's attorney-client privilege is irrelevant,"
argued Kelli Sager, the lawyer representing The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "The California Constitution provides an absolute right to
publish." The move by the archdiocese represented a highly unusual
attempt to block publication of information that it considered
sensitive. Such moves, known as "prior restraints," almost never are
granted by courts, and when they are, they almost inevitably are
overturned on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, the lawyer for the church maintained that California
law prohibited the "use" of material that was illegally obtained.</TE>
<TE>   Other courts have held that under similar federal laws, "use" does
not include the publication or broadcast of such material, but that
those who actually hack into computer systems to steal it may be held
liable for their acts.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails that the archdiocese was seeking to keep secret
include communications between Mahony and his staff, including his
lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   In one, Mahony urged that his lawyers and aides meet with a police
detective and clarify that all priests implicated with possible
wrongdoing had been discussed with authorities. In addition to the
five priests already reported to authorities, Mahony suggested that
three more needed to be discussed with police.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't take immediate, aggressive action here--the
consequences for the [archdiocese] are going to be incredible,"
Mahony wrote. "Charges of cover up, concealing criminals, etc., etc."</TE>

<LD>Reviving track and field as a spectator sport in Southern California
may be as difficult as bringing back an NFL team.</LD>
<LD>   But Craig Masback, chief executive officer of USA Track and Field,
considers Los Angeles a fertile area that simply hasn't been properly
mined. And he sees the $120-million national training center in
Carson as a launch pad for wide-ranging efforts to promote the sport
locally and nationally.</LD>
<LD>   Masback said this week he has talked with officials of the
Anschutz Entertainment Group--which is financing the multi-sport
mecca--about making the center a base for USATF programs. They have
also discussed moving the USATF's operations to Carson from
Indianapolis.</LD>
<TE>   Plans for the complex call for refurbishing the existing track and
building a nine-lane Olympic-standard track with 2,500 to 3,000
permanent seats. Temporary seating would expand the capacity to
10,000 at significant events.</TE>
<TE>   "The focus of our conversations has been getting a world-class
track and field facility built, and programming that facility to the
fullest extent possible," Masback said. "We're talking about
everything from coaching and educational activities, training camps
and clinics to a full range of all ages' track meets and elite track
meets.</TE>
<TE>   "These discussions have been extensive and ongoing. I think it's
very exciting. While there are some very good facilities in the L.A.
area, this would be a track-focused facility, and that's attractive
to us."</TE>
<TE>   The complex will also include facilities for soccer, tennis and
cycling. Tim Leiweke, president of AEG and Staples Center, recently
said he hopes the governing bodies of several Olympic sports will
move there or stage major competitions there.</TE>
<TE>   Although Southern California is always well represented on U.S.
Olympic track and field teams, local fans and advertisers have given
the sport a cold reception in recent years. The L.A. Invitational
Indoor meet limps along, eating into the bankrolls of father-son
promoters Al and Don Franken, and a planned indoor meet at Staples
Center last year was canceled in the wake of poor ticket sales and a
feud between organizers and sponsor Powerade. A lawsuit filed by the
L.A. Track and Field Organizing Committee against Coca-Cola,
Powerade's parent company, was moved to federal court and is
scheduled to go to trial in December.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Masback isn't daunted. He plans to resurrect track
and field by supporting invitational and local meets, a blueprint the
USATF has used in the San Francisco Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel we will have rebirthed the sport to the status it had
there in years gone by," he said. "Now we've got to do that in Los
Angeles, and if we can have the facilities, we can do it. We can
build on [the] Mt. SAC [Relays] and the state meet that's there every
other year. Even USC and UCLA are doing well.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're finally in a position to start doing something
there. I have great faith in the Los Angeles area."</TE>
<TE>   See How She Runs</TE>
<TE>   Five-time Sydney Olympic medalist Marion Jones will compete in her
only scheduled 400-meter race this season April 21 at the Mt. San
Antonio College Relays in Walnut. It will be the fifth straight
season she has begun at Mt. SAC, where she competed while a student
at Oxnard Rio Mesa High.</TE>
<TE>   Jones won the rarely contested 300 at Mt. SAC last year in 35.68
seconds, .22 of a second off the world record. Meet director Scott
Davis said Jones is targeting Valerie Brisco's U.S. record in the
400, 48.83 seconds, set in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   The entries for elite events aren't complete, but the women's
two-mile appears formidable. Competitors will include Deena Drossin
of Agoura Hills--who won a silver medal at the world cross country
championships in Ireland--Jen Rhines, Amy Rudolph and Nicole Teter.
Among the men, Breaux Greer will try for a U.S. record in the
javelin.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, a high school team championship will also be
contested, and boys' and girls' four-mile relays will be run April
20.</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Marla Runyan, who became the first legally blind runner to compete
at the Olympics when she finished eighth in the 1,500 at Sydney, will
compete in the Cherry Blossom 10-mile race Sunday in Washington. It
will be the longest road race she has run. She's the U.S. record
holder in the women's indoor and outdoor 5,000.... Drossin, Colleen
De Reuck and Elva Dryer lead a strong field in the Carlsbad 5000
Sunday. On the men's side are UCLA alum Meb Keflezighi, the U.S.
record holder in the 10,000, two-time Carlsbad champion Sammy
Kipketer and fellow Kenyan Luke Kipkosgei.</TE>
<TE>   The International Assn. of Athletics Federations will choose the
site of the 2005 World Track and Field Championships April 14. An
evaluation commission recently toured potential host cities Berlin,
Brussels, Rome, Moscow, Helsinki, Finland and Budapest, Hungary.
London was the original host but withdrew after stadium funding fell
through.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Carroll, coach of Olympic figure skating bronze medalist and
world silver medalist Tim Goebel, will hold his annual summer skating
school June 16-Aug. 16 at HealthSouth Training Center in El Segundo.
Goebel is touring with Champions on Ice; Carroll's other elite
student, Angela Nikodinov, is touring Canada with the Skate the
Nation show.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. men's national water polo team finished a solid third in
an international tournament last week in Nice, France. Its only loss
was to Russia in overtime. Jeff Powers of UC Irvine had four goals
and Tony Azevedo of Long Beach and Stanford scored twice in the
bronze-medal game. The team will play in Slovenia this weekend.</TE>

<CX>   Distance running--Regina Jacobs holds the U.S. women's outdoor
record for 5,000 meters. A Sports story Friday incorrectly said Marla
Runyan holds the outdoor record. In fact, Runyan holds the U.S. indoor
record for 5,000 meters.</CX>
