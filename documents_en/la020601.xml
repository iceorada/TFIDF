<HD>Aide Testifies Duncan Did Not Have Ill Intent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>David B. Duncan's former assistant broke down in tears on the witness
stand Thursday as she explained that her boss at accounting firm
Arthur Andersen didn't believe he had done anything wrong when he
directed the shredding of Enron Corp. audit material last fall.</LD>
<LD>   The emotional statements from Shannon Adlong, along with other
testimony Friday, appeared to bolster the defense's contention that
fired Andersen partner Duncan and Andersen in-house attorney Nancy
Temple lacked criminal intent at the start of Enron's meltdown in
October.</LD>
<LD>   Their state of mind is crucial because the obstruction law says a
defendant must act "corruptly" to be convicted.</LD>
<TE>   Duncan led Andersen's team of Enron auditors in Houston. Adlong
testified that on the day Duncan learned he had been fired from the
89-year-old accounting firm in January, he told her that "no one on
the engagement team did anything wrong" and that he "just thought
[he] was following orders."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan testified that part of what prompted him to order the
destruction was an e-mail sent by Temple and forwarded to him citing
Andersen's document-retention policy.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has suggested that Duncan pleaded guilty to obstruction
of justice and cooperated with investigators in hopes of avoiding a
lengthy jail sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, the government's key witness in its obstruction-of-justice
case against Andersen, has denied that motivation.</TE>
<TE>   In Friday's testimony, Adlong described Duncan as reluctant to
start the process of picking through his files to determine which
records to toss out.</TE>
<TE>   About half of the documents he identified to toss out, she
testified, had nothing to do with Enron. The Enron-related material,
she said, appeared to be drafts of Enron transaction documents that
dated as far back as 1996.</TE>
<TE>   In another development Friday, U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon
told the lawyers that a juror had sent her a note fearing that
another juror might intentionally slow deliberations to retaliate for
a third juror's consistent tardiness. Harmon said she had not decided
how to respond.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Friday, a senior member of Andersen's team of accounting
specialists testified that Temple told him that she would retain
copies of a stack of his documents that cast Duncan's Enron audit
team and Enron in an unflattering light.</TE>
<TE>   John Stewart told jurors that he faced a dilemma last fall because
he didn't want to dispose of a stack of drafts and e-mails explaining
the firm's internal debate about Enron's accounting, but he also
believed Andersen's document-retention policy required such drafts to
be destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart said he consulted Temple in mid-October on how to handle
the situation. He said Temple promised to hold on to the papers and
directed him to trash his copies.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege Temple sent e-mails about the document policy
to trigger destruction with the intent of impeding an inquiry by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Andersen's lead attorney, Rusty
Hardin, appeared to be attempting to suggest to the jury that Temple
wouldn't have retained the documents if she had such intentions.</TE>
<TE>   In cross-examining Stewart, prosecutors cast Temple's action in a
different light. Assistant U.S. Atty. Samuel Buell raised the
prospect that Temple told Stewart to destroy his copies while keeping
hers in order to apply attorney-client privilege and prevent the
files from having to be produced in the event of litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart said the issue was never raised by Temple, who has invoked
her 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to
testify.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen also failed in an attempt to persuade Harmon to let the
firm re-call Andersen librarian Sharon Thibaut to the witness stand
to testify about the volume of Enron-related drafts and other files
that were saved.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen told Harmon outside the jury's presence that it should be
able to tell jurors that the firm shredded about 40 boxes of
Enron-related papers but kept 1,660 boxes. But Harmon turned down the
request.</TE>

<HD>A Phantom Menace?</HD>
<DH>Mike J. Nichols' unauthorized reedit of 'Star Wars: Episode
I' burns up the Internet, demonstrating technology's new
capabilities. The film empire is watching.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This messy Burbank living room, with its cheap computer and
jury-rigged video station, may be the most notorious rebel outpost in
the "Star Wars" universe this side of the ice planet Hoth.</LD>
<LD>   It is the lair of the Phantom Editor, a struggling filmmaker who
boldly remade a copy of the first "Star Wars" prequel into a movie
that die-hard fans liked better than George Lucas' original--and
became a cult hero in the process.</LD>
<LD>   Using off-the-shelf software and a rented VHS copy of "Star Wars:
Episode I The Phantom Menace," Mike J. Nichols spliced away elements
that were too cute for hard-core fans. In Nichols' version of the
1999 film, the kid who will one day become genocidal overlord Darth
Vader no longer yelps, "Yippee!" And the alien Jar Jar Binks, whose
Barney-like antics launched countless "Kill Jar Jar" Web sites, is
reduced to near-silence.</LD>
<TE>   The unauthorized cut, which Nichols calls "Star Wars: Episode I.I
The Phantom Edit," has become a sort of "Basement Tapes" for a new,
nerdier generation. Copies are advertised on EBay for $20. Late-night
TV comedy shows make references to it. When the DVD version of the
movie hit shelves, Nichols duplicated his efforts in that format and
dubbed the result "Episode I.II."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Nichols' followers have sent him copies of "Star Wars:
Episode II Attack of the Clones," hoping he can make the latest
installment in Lucas' genre-defining sci-fi series more to their
liking.</TE>
<TE>   Nichols, who was a card-carrying member of the "Star Wars" fan
club as a kid in Canton, Ill., thinks he can do just that, if he
decides to tackle it. The thirtysomething film editor (he declines to
give his age) knows he sounds as brash as the teenage Anakin
Skywalker when he says, "I have the storytelling sense that George
Lucas once had and lost."</TE>
<TE>   The master of the "Star Wars" empire isn't exactly quaking in his
boots. "Our stand on 'The Phantom Edit' ... was: He was just an
enthusiastic fan having fun," said Jeanne Cole, a spokeswoman for
Lucas' Marin County production company, Lucasfilm Ltd. "There was no
intention to commit any copyright infringement, and we appreciated
that."</TE>
<TE>   Nichols says his version of "Menace" was never supposed to get
beyond his circle of movie industry friends, and he has never made a
cent on it. But news of the unauthorized work--and downloadable
copies of it--quickly spread on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   While Cole refuses to discuss any legal matters concerning "The
Phantom Edit," she said her company became worried about the rumors
of its widespread distribution last summer. At the time, movie-news
Web sites reported that the company threatened to get its lawyers
involved. Nichols, who says he was never contacted by Lucasfilm
attorneys, decided to post an apology to the company and asked fans
to stop selling or trading his version.</TE>
<TE>   The overwhelming popularity of "Star Wars" has spawned countless
fan-produced spinoffs in recent years, a fact that Lucasfilm
acknowledged earlier this month by granting the first "Star Wars" Fan
Film Awards. But the contest was open only to documentaries and
parodies, and Nichols remains persona non grata in the official "Star
Wars" universe.</TE>
<TE>   He is unsure if Lucas has seen "The Phantom Edit." And despite his
newfound notoriety, his Hollywood career has been slow to take off.</TE>
<TE>   He had to abandon the original feature film he was directing (his
description: "Citizen Kane" meets "Star Wars" meets "The Breakfast
Club") when the leading man decided in mid-shoot that cinema wasn't
his calling. Nichols has been keeping the rent paid at what he calls
"Skywalker Ranch Lite" with freelance editing jobs on small-budget
films and auto-lot TV ads.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, message boards remain clogged with up-to-date offers to
hook fans up with Nichols' "Star Wars" samizdat. "The Phantom Edit's"
legend and influence continue to grow. Fans are now debating the
merits of a number of similar edits making their way around the Web,
including a version that addresses the Jar Jar Binks issue by dubbing
his dialogue in an "alien" language and adding subtitles.</TE>
<TE>   A 23-year-old Sacramento film buff inspired by "The Phantom Edit"
has begun trading what he calls "The Kubrick Edit" of the Steven
Spielberg movie "A.I. Artificial Intelligence." He purports to
reproduce what the film might have been if filmmaker Stanley Kubrick
had not died while collaborating on the production.</TE>
<TE>   Nichols likens "The Phantom Edit" to the fan-remixed pop songs
that have become popular on the Internet--remixes of dubious
legality. Some commentators have hailed "The Phantom Edit" as the
advent of a futuristic "open-source filmmaking," in which movie buffs
can cut and paste the basic DNA of a movie, changing characters and
plots to suit individual tastes.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent issue of Res, a magazine devoted to independent
filmmaking, writer Christopher Shulgan envisioned "a visual hip-hop,
where video remixers sample and re-cut preexisting works to yield
entirely new artistic creations."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Gore, publisher of Filmthreat.com and a longtime champion of
do-it-yourself filmmaking, doubts the idea will catch on outside the
world of science fiction and fantasy buffs. No one, he noted, is
re-cutting "The Godfather." But Gore also believes that the threat of
fans latching onto remixes may irrevocably shift the balance of power
between big studios and consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "The big threat is to the creative souls of these filmmakers, like
[Martin] Scorsese or Lucas, who have lost their edge, either through
self-indulgence or the fact that they have become so sheltered," Gore
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Phantom agrees. "Now, big-time directors know that if they do
a [bad] job, somebody may redo it and make them look like idiots."</TE>
<TE>   The pressure of audience opinion on artists' output is nothing
new. Charles Dickens famously rewrote a happier ending to the
serialized "Great Expectations" to suit public tastes, and studios
show some unreleased movies to gauge audience reaction early and
tweak the product accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   David Madden, an executive vice president at Fox Television
Studios, was the executive in charge of the movie "Fatal Attraction"
at Paramount in 1987. He presided over a controversial switch to a
happier ending when the original, darker version of the thriller
tanked with test audiences.</TE>
<TE>   But Madden has seen "The Phantom Edit," and he has mixed feelings
about what it may portend--perhaps a phantom "Gone With the Wind" in
which Rhett and Scarlett live happily ever after.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mean to sound too 20th century, but I come from this
tradition where an artist works really hard to create a vision,"
Madden said. "I'm a little scared, because [fan reedits] somehow take
away the primitive power of me telling you a story, and you having to
follow the story. If it disturbs you, it may be that much better."</TE>
<TE>   Sipping a Mountain Dew at "Phantom Edit" headquarters--his
sparsely furnished bachelor living room--last month, Nichols said he
is bewildered by much of the theorizing his work has generated. Many
of his values, he said, are pretty old-fashioned.</TE>
<TE>   "The Phantom Edit" was meant to be an act of "proactive
criticism," he said, a friendly attempt to guide Lucas away from
special effects and marketing tie-ins and back toward the art of
storytelling.</TE>
<TE>   As proof of his disinterest in spreading his movie on the Web, he
said that he still uses a pokey dial-up Internet connection. He
preferred not to talk about the other simple hardware he used to
produce "The Phantom Edit." "I'm not a bootlegger," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Nichols became as testy as any auteur when talk turned to
copycat phantom edits that have traded on his reputation. "Yeah," he
snorts. "Attack of the clones."</TE>

<HD>Husbands Are Big Game in Glacierville</HD>
<DH>'Bachelorettes in Alaska' finds five single women competing
for Mr. Right in ice and snow.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Love is cold and calculating.</LD>
<LD>   At least it is in Fox's latest tournament of romance and
rejection, "Looking for Love: Bachelorettes in Alaska," a variation
on ABC's "The Bachelor" with the women mostly in control this time.
The games begin at 9 p.m. Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The premise: Five single women in their 20s and 30s travel from
the Lower 48 states to Alaska, where it's snowing rugged men. After
six weeks of courting and competing amid awesome glaciers and big
skies, each woman hopes to land a husband on her arm.</LD>
<TE>   The players: Andrea, an advertising coordinator from San
Francisco; Cecile, a sales analyst from Benicia, Calif.; Karen, a
business manager from Hampton, N.H.; Rebekah, a real estate broker
from Los Angeles; and Sissie, an interior designer from Myrtle Beach,
S.C., plus several dozen local hunks with hobbies such as truck
racing and ice fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's premiere starts with the guys lined up in army formation
and the women immediately ignoring host Steve Santagati's admonition
not to talk to them (no sexist snickering, please). Each woman picks
a first date, staking a claim to her "man on ice."</TE>
<TE>   After a group mingle at the Northern Light lodge, with the svelte
and charming Rebekah seizing the aggressor role and working the room,
it's voyeur time: Cut to slow-motion smooching and bantering in the
various cabins, cue silky saxophone.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh meat is brought in as four new guys square off in an ax
toss, with the winner picking a woman to date (Rebekah, to no one's
shock). The other women then pick dates among the other new guys, but
when Cecile and Andrea grab the same one, he has to make a choice:
Cecile gets left out in the cold, with only her man on ice.</TE>
<TE>   In a scene that captures the uneasy camaraderie and competition
among the women, Rebekah later tells a fuming Cecile, "You know what,
this is a game, sweetie."</TE>
<TE>   Though Rebekah has the dudes dazzled, she may not be the favorite
among her peers. Sissie says mockingly, "She wants her Mocha
Frappuccino and she wants someone to deliver it to her."</TE>
<TE>   Each episode ends at Proposal Point with the new guys making a
plea for the woman of their choice, hoping to supplant her man on
ice, but she selects whom to get know better as the contest
continues. Sunday night's "pleas" include a basket made from twigs
(for Sissie) and a schmaltzy poem (for Rebekah, naturally). Fans of
the budding "Survivor"-meets-"Love Connection" genre will probably
warm to these proceedings, but for the rest of us, Fox may be coming
on too strong, like the suitor who sends a dozen roses every day.
Already, the bloom is getting old.</TE>

<HD>Taking 'Reality' to a Higher Level</HD>
<DH>Television* A serious documentarian turns her camera on the
Hamptons for a new kind of miniseries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Series like "Survivor" and "The Bachelor" have proved that a
manipulated version of reality can be edited into the equivalent of
television's fictional dramas or soap operas. But can real life--as
filmed by an Oscar-winning documentarian, no less--sustain the long
primary and secondary plots and night-to-night cliffhangers that mark
a miniseries?</LD>
<LD>   ABC set out to try in "The Hamptons," its two-part, four-hour
"reality miniseries" airing Sunday and Monday. The network chose an
unlikely filmmaker, however, in Barbara Kopple, best known for
penetrating portraits of the U.S. labor movement and not an artist
apt to play with the facts.</LD>
<LD>   The Hamptons, a string of communities along a 26-mile stretch of
beachfront that forms the major summer resort area for a good number
of New Yorkers, is a loaded term. New Yorkers--at least those with
the means to escape the city on weekends--tend to either love or hate
them. The area generates strong feelings about its spectacular
natural beauty, its intense social scene, excessive wealth and
perpetually backed-up traffic.</LD>
<TE>   Kopple said she threw out any preconceptions she might have had
when she signed on to explore the area for ABC. If she had any strong
opinions one way or the other before making the film, the New York
City resident isn't letting on, saying only that she fished there
with her family as a child and spent a few summer weeks there with
her husband and son. "I'm not what you'd call a 'Hamptonite.' I
appreciated the beauty of it," she said, adding that she chooses to
summer in a woodsy rural community north of New York called Yorktown
Heights.</TE>
<TE>   "People do have certain feelings about what the Hamptons are all
about," Kopple said. "But I wanted to explore for myself who these
people are." Sometimes, she noted, "we put people in boxes."</TE>
<TE>   Still, few on the Hamptons A-list believed her claims of
open-mindedness when she set out with her cameras last summer. "While
she was shooting, people were tremendously nervous, afraid that she'd
be critical, that it would be a hit on the Hamptons," said Steven
Gaines, author of "Philistines at the Hedgerow," a book about the
area's upper-crust residents and one of the film's key subjects.
Rumors raced through the social set, heightened by a newspaper report
suggesting she might be using hidden microphones.</TE>
<TE>   Kopple, said Gaines, "spent the summer telling people she had no
agenda and wasn't going to intercut pictures of poor Indians on the
Shinnecock Reservation with scenes of lavish excess. Some people
believed her, some didn't. A lot of access was denied."</TE>
<TE>   ABC chose the Hamptons for its first attempt at a "reality"
miniseries because it seemed "closed-ended," said Quinn Taylor, who
oversees the network's movies and miniseries department. Taking place
between Memorial Day and Labor Day, "it had a clear beginning, middle
and end." Plus, he said, its summer setting allowed a look into the
lives of seasonal residents who come from the city--celebrities,
wealthy businesspeople and singles looking for love in group-share
houses--as well as the year-round population of fishermen, farmers
and others who run the communities. "It was not conflict, but
definitely two worlds trying to co-mingle," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Imposing story lines proved harder, however. In editing, Kopple
insisted on sticking to the same chronology as when she was shooting.
A particularly affecting scene comes on Night 2, when popular
restaurateur Jeff Salaway is interviewed the very night before he is
killed in an early-morning traffic accident.</TE>
<TE>   "I was devastated," said ABC's Taylor. "This is something you
never experienced in 'Survivor.' This was just true. You got to meet
a man, who was darling, and then he was dead."</TE>
<TE>   In a perfect television world, the miniseries would have included
scenes from Salaway earlier in the film to heighten the dramatic
impact. "I wish we had been able to set him up earlier," said Taylor,
"[but] Barbara is a purist; she would not at all manipulate the
subject, the environment, anything. She met Jeff the day he appears
in the show."</TE>
<TE>   The network did successfully push for a Night 1 cliffhanger, which
it got, thanks to the infamous Lizzie Grubman accident, when the
celebrity publicist allegedly backed her father's SUV at high speed
into a crowd of clubgoers, injuring many and then leaving the scene.
The legal fallout is still ongoing, but Kopple quickly drops the
story in the second night.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the network carved out the "A story" and less
important "B story" plot lines that a good miniseries needs, Taylor
said, by focusing on the "upstairs-downstairs" interplay between,
say, a celebrity choosing a dress for a party and the struggling
caterer laying out the shrimp, as well as on the characters'
"obsessive struggle" to fulfill their summer goal, whether it is
meeting a husband, getting photographed on the social circuit or
making it as a singer.</TE>
<TE>   Because of its focus on New York elites, "The Hamptons" has
garnered a good deal of media attention, and several critics have
complained that the film lacks ongoing stories as well as a strong
point of view. Kopple played it so neutral that Wall Street Journal
critic Tunku Varadarajan thought she "wants her viewers to despise
those with money," while the New York Daily News' David Bianculli
decided she "seems overtaken by the rarefied air of celebrity fumes."</TE>
<TE>   Kopple said the topic didn't lend itself to opinion. "What you're
searching for is a more human point of view, it's not a drama of good
and bad or right and wrong.... It's a human drama of living together
in small-town America."</TE>
<TE>   ABC's Taylor acknowledged that the next time he tries a reality
miniseries, he would want to conduct more advance research to set up
ongoing stories and identify key characters earlier on.</TE>
<TE>   Despite last summer's angst among the jet set, the filmmaker
clearly didn't alienate everyone, and they didn't end up alienating
her. A full house of nearly 500 Hamptons habitues will get to see
Kopple's work for themselves tonight at an invitation-only screening
at the area's Sag Harbor Cinema, hosted by Kopple and one of her
subjects, model Christie Brink- ley. The two are also hosting a
fund-raiser clambake at actor Spalding Gray's home afterward. Kopple
cites Brinkley's work with the STAR Foundation, an antinuclear-power
organization, as one of the main surprises she uncovered during her
summer of filming.</TE>
<TE>   Gaines, who saw the film for the first time this week, said he
expects the crowd to be pleased. All the worry, he said, was "for
nothing, absolutely nothing. It is an accurate, friendly, unsalted
version of events last summer."</TE>

rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young children).</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new Pasadena Museum of California Art has its public debut today
with the opening of four modest exhibitions. The shows feature
landscape paintings from 1905 to 1925, a distinctive variant on
Surrealist art from the 1930s, geometric abstraction from the late
1950s to the early 1960s and, finally, a sliver of Conceptual art in
the 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   Together they suggest an extremely wide range of artistic
production during California's 20th century. Because artists working
in Los Angeles since the 1980s have made the city an internationally
acknowledged powerhouse for new art, think of these unassuming
exhibitions as a bit of the back story.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, though, the debut offers a classic good news/bad news
scenario. The good news is that, for the first time, a museum in L.A.
is making the exceptionally rich history of art produced in the
region a centerpiece of its activities. The bad news is--well, pretty
much the same thing. A legitimate need was identified, but it's
doubtful that this project will (or can) fulfill it.</LD>
<TE>   There are five art museums of international stature in L.A. Art
outside the United States and made before the 20th century is, with
some notable exceptions, the great strength of three of them: the
Getty, the Huntington and the Norton Simon Museum.</TE>
<TE>   The other two are the natural homes for art made in California
over the last 150 years. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art has the
nation's most significant encyclopedic program west of the
Mississippi. The same holds for the Museum of Contemporary Art in the
field of postwar work. But despite some individual exhibitions and
limited areas of collecting, neither LACMA nor MOCA has yet achieved
anything close to critical mass in addressing the resonant artistic
past and present of its own region. Accomplishing that requires
smart, courageous, focused patronage.</TE>
<TE>   If LACMA and MOCA haven't done it, who will? Enter the Pasadena
Museum of California Art--the PMCA--which was quietly founded by
little-known collectors Robert and Arlene Oltman. (An architect,
Robert Oltman made his fortune in the personal storage-unit
business.) Their fledgling museum is a response to an obvious
deficit. Though it's certainly enthusiastic, little indicates that
the response is adequate.</TE>
<TE>   The museum is housed in a pleasant, unassuming new building at 490
E. Union St., just north of Colorado Boulevard and around the corner
from the Pacific Asia Museum. Designed by Culver City's MDA Johnson
Favaro Architecture and Urban Design, the PMCA has just 8,000 square
feet of mostly raw, warehouse-like exhibition space on its second
floor. (The tall ground-floor parking garage is poised to become a
comparably sized gallery at an unspecified point in the future.)</TE>
<TE>   Specialty museums are often launched when a noteworthy art
collection can't find an appropriate existing home. This one,
however, has no permanent collection to speak of. It opens less as a
museum than as a Kunsthalle--a space for temporary art exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   The opening shows, each organized by a different independent
curator, are loosely linked under the title "On-Ramps: Transitional
Moments in California Art." Each includes some strong work, although
none is large enough to offer a definitive study of its subject.
(Only one has a catalog, which at 48 pages is certainly modest.)
They're like preliminary sketches for exhibitions you might someday
like to see fully realized.</TE>
<TE>   The most substantial of them sports the most unwieldy title. "Post
Surrealism: Genesis and Equilibrium/Pictures From the Cerebral World"
was organized by critic Michael Duncan and is scheduled to travel to
Utah State University in Logan in October. It brings together 45
paintings, drawings and prints by nine artists, as well as two cases
of documentation and ephemera.</TE>
<TE>   Post Surrealism was conceived by painters Lorser Feitelson and
Helen Lundeberg in 1934 as a rational yet enigmatic retort to the
emphasis on the irrational and the unconscious in European
Surrealism. Courting Aristotle more than Freud, their symbol-laden
pictures of eternal cycles of love and death are informed by montage
techniques inspired by Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Post Surrealism stands as the most compelling early movement in
Modern L.A. art. Among other things, it's distinctive for the central
role played by women--Lundeberg and Grace Clements--which is a far
cry from the common misogynist antics of their Parisian predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   Yet nearly seven decades after its birth, the parameters,
objectives, exhibition history, critical reception and other basic
aspects of its history await full examination. (In last year's
catalog to "Made in California," LACMA's sprawling history of 20th
century art in the state, the term "Post Surrealism" didn't even rate
a listing in the index.) Duncan has assembled a provocative group of
paintings, including an especially good group by the underrated
Danish expatriate Knud Merrild, while the slim catalog reprints some
important early texts.</TE>
<TE>   Hovering like ghosts in the conceptual background of these
evocative paintings are Walter and Louise Arensberg, whose staggering
collection of European Dada and Surrealist art was regularly open to
visitors at their Hollywood home in the 1930s and after. (They also
helped support artists hit hard by the Great Depression, including
Merrild.) The Arensbergs' famous patronage of Marcel Duchamp likewise
comes to mind in another section of "On-Ramps."</TE>
<TE>   "Hard Edge to Finish Fetish," organized by critic Peter Frank,
assembles 10 paintings and seven sculptures in which clean, crisp
color abstraction can yield a sleek look that gives eroticism an
industrial glint. Duchamp's mechanistic meditation on thwarted sexual
consummation, "The Large Glass," lurks in the ancestry of DeWain
Valentine's hot-pink sculpture, which is part overgrown child's toy,
part voluptuous android, and of Craig Kauffman's slick painting on
Plexiglas, where interlocking forms suggest a copulating machine.</TE>
<TE>   Duchamp's gamesmanship informs a pedestal sculpture by Judy
Gerowitz (before she changed her last name to Chicago), in which six
little triangles and six small square columns line up like soldiers
on a board. Fabricated in clear, sterile plastic, the triangles and
columns fuse sexual symbolism with a game of chess.</TE>
<TE>   This section's jolt of flashy glamour separates the two remaining
shows, which are more austere. Three dozen old-fashioned landscape
paintings by Edgar Payne, Granville Redmond, Guy Rose and other
stalwarts of the genre are featured in "Light to Form," a survey of
California Impressionism and other mostly outdoor painting organized
by art historian and dealer Nancy Moure. Adventurous,
process-oriented art from the 1970s--where color seems to be nearly
taboo--is assembled in "Beyond Boundaries: Bay Area Conceptual Art. "</TE>
<TE>   Organized by curator and former gallerist Thomas Solomon, this
last section is the only one that strays from Southern California.
The 30 works range from Lynn Hershman's classified ad, which
surreptitiously seeks an unsuspecting art collaborator, to Paul Kos'
short, witty film of the artist's failed attempt to lasso a chunk of
landscape with a rope. Western art gets an odd new twist.</TE>
<TE>   Except for "Post Surrealism," these small, fragmentary shows do
not come with catalogs or other documentation. Think of them as tasty
samplers that, come September, will disappear back into the void.
Their sketchy, ephemeral quality doesn't alleviate the larger problem
that the PMCA presumes to address--it is instead symptomatic of it.</TE>
<TE>   True, it's the Oltmans' money, not mine. But the museum is also a
tax-exempt public corporation, not a private project. So far, the
PMCA has reportedly spent $5 million on real estate, building design,
construction, staff salaries, insurance, opening shows and other
requirements of institutional infrastructure that come with
establishing a new museum. (There is no endowment.) That's $5 million
to duplicate what already exists elsewhere in town.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, every dollar spent on institutional infrastructure
is a dollar that cannot be spent on California art--which is the
declared focus of this endeavor. Imagine the stellar art collection
that amount of money could have bought, or the significant
exhibitions it could have funded. It's a shame the effort and expense
in launching the PMCA, which appears unlikely ever to have a major
profile, were not brought to bear on leveraging California art at
LACMA and MOCA, which already do. There, the Oltmans might have made
a substantial difference.</TE>

<LD>Re: "State Art Funds at Heart of Conflict" (by Diane Haithman, May
25): It is a complete misuse of scarce taxpayer dollars, especially
funds designated for support of the arts, to support a religious
institution like the Museum of Tolerance. Despite its claims to
broader purposes, the museum's logo is a Jewish star, and its focus
is the Holocaust of the Jews in World War II. It is closed on
Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, and on most Jewish holidays.</LD>
<LD>   In contrast, the United States Holocaust Museum in Washington,
D.C., is open daily except Christmas Day and Yom Kippur, the holiest
day of the Jewish calendar.</LD>
<LD>   And most importantly, "Tools for Tolerance" is not an art program.
If the legislature and the governor want to support the "Tools for
Tolerance" program, this should be part of some other appropriation.</LD>
<TE>   I choose to support the Museum of Tolerance as a member--just as I
support the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Museum of
Contemporary Art--but my tax dollars designated for support of the
arts should not support it.</TE>

<LD>While I was glad to see Daryl H. Miller's positive review of that old
Broadway chestnut, "High Button Shoes" ("'High Button Shoes' Still
Provides Delight," May 27), I felt dismay that he listed practically
everyone associated with the Broadway production of 1947, including
(in order of their mention) Jerome Robbins, George Abbott, Jule
Styne, Sammy Cahn and Phil Silvers, but no mention of the librettist,
Stephen Longstreet, nor Silvers' co-star, Nanette Fabray.</LD>
<LD>   Fabray is still with us, so she can speak for herself at the
oversight. But Longstreet has passed away and I am here to speak for
him. The Times ran a wonderful obit of this brilliant renaissance
man--he was a prolific writer, artist and jazz musician--and perhaps
that was enough. But since he wrote the show's book, I feel it
wouldn't hurt to remind your readers of Longstreet's infinite
variety.</LD>

<HD>Box-Office Records: Inflation Is a Player</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The "sailing" 9% increase in box office over the holiday weekend
("'Clones,' 'Spider-Man' Lead Holiday Weekend to a Record," by
Richard Natale, May 28) was completely due to the rapidly increasing
price of going to the movies.</LD>
<LD>   Whereas only a year ago I was paying $7.50 and $8 (at the very
most) to see a first-run film, I am now paying at least $9. So if you
call the overall increase $1 per ticket, that's a gigantic increase
of well over 11%, which of course eclipses the amazing new record set
at the box office this Memorial Day weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Don't get me wrong; I like seeing Hollywood healthy economically,
but this big burst of newer and bigger profits reported by you and
touted by the industry is fully and completely self-induced. No big
deal, I say!</LD>

<TE>   Shortly after plunking down $10 for "Star Wars," I read that the
average national ticket price for this movie was just $5.50. If the
"average" is $5.50, there must be places charging a lot less than
$5.50, to balance out the $9-$14 prices that now predominate the big
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Why do we pay so much to watch movies here? McDonald's doesn't
charge more for Big Macs in cities than they do in small towns;
what's up with the movie theaters?</TE>

<LD>Why is it that, when a middle-aged critic responds positively to an
artist that younger people like, other people who dislike the artist
in question jump to the conclusion that the critic is only trying to
be hip? In dismissing Robert Hilburn's artistic respect for Eminem as
an "inappropriate posture," Barry Shapiro (Saturday Letters, May 25)
joins the many people who apparently find personal attacks on people
who disagree with their artistic opinions to be an appropriate
posture.</LD>
<LD>   I am 41 years old and, like Hilburn, I find Eminem to be much more
than an "illiterate, homophobic thug" (although I certainly do think
his attitude toward gays and women needs some work). I think there's
a lot of genuine talent there. If Shapiro disagrees, fine, but I'll
thank him not to make assumptions about my artistic opinions.</LD>

<LD>Judging by his acerbic review of "Last Call" ("Flash Outshines Any
Substance," May 25), Howard Rosenberg must have seen a film different
from the one that appeared on Showtime May 25. He dismisses the
performance of Jeremy Irons as bogus, British and too tall, and Neve
Campbell as a wide-eyed Judy Garland singing "You Made Me Love You."</LD>
<LD>   He ignores Irons' ability to reach inside a character and find the
torment that plagued Fitzgerald when I worked for him. I saw the
actor become the author. As for Campbell, her luminous sensitivity
and strength were clearly visible under Henry Bromell's direction.</LD>
<LD>   So take another look, Howard Rosenberg, without your weary viewing
glasses.</LD>

<LD>I just finished reading "Journey to the Center of L.A.," written by
Mary McNamara (May 30). Being a true-born Angeleno, I felt it was one
of the best articles I've read about Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Lately, I have been complaining about the driving, comparing this
city to the likes of New York or Boston, but reading this put a smile
on my face, leading to a friendlier and more observant driver.</LD>
<LD>   I think I may even take a long-overdue road trip this weekend.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have to commend you for pointing out that there are
entertainments in Los Angeles other than those that are on a screen,
stage or in a museum. I am disappointed, though, that you didn't go
one step further and suggest to your readers that they walk some of
these boulevards rather than drive them.</TE>
<TE>   I've walked many of the boulevard routes that you featured: the
length of Sunset Boulevard, both Topanga and Coldwater Canyon (not to
mention Laurel Canyon, Sepulveda Pass, Malibu Canyon and Cahuenga
Pass) and the length of Wilshire Boulevard at least 10 times.</TE>
<TE>   To experience these cityscapes at the leisurely pace of walking is
like reading a book about the development and life of the city. To
drive these same stretches is something like reading the Cliffs
Notes: You get the idea but you can't fully appreciate the richness
that makes it great.</TE>
<TE>   I hope more people will get out and walk these routes to discover
what a wonderfully diverse and colorful place is this City of Angels.</TE>

<LD>Kevin Thomas' excellent review of "Les Destinees" induced my husband
and me to go see it ("A Timeless Portrait of Marriage and Maturation
in 'Les Destinees,'" May 17). Unfortunately, Thomas did not tell his
readers that the camerawork goes from hand-held to swooping to
extreme close-ups.</LD>
<LD>   I am one of many people who are made physically ill by all that
movement. It would be much appreciated if your reviewers would
mention it in their critiques. Maybe you could include a symbol in
the credits section--perhaps a camera with a wavy line above it. Some
such notification would save us from a wild goose chase and the
frustration of starting a movie and then having to leave.</LD>

<LD>Ethel and Julius Rosenberg "were systematically framed" ("Turning
History Into Chilling Drama," by Philip Brandes, May 24)? They were
"scapegoats"? What nonsense!</LD>
<LD>   Since the fall of the Soviet Union, solid evidence proving the
Rosenbergs' shameful betrayal of the United States doesn't seem to
have registered with playwright Lou Shaw. Shaw, in dire need of
right-wing demons and leftist victims, blows right on by the truth in
his play and arrives at a lie liberals desperately want and need to
believe: that the Rosenbergs were framed by the FBI and the
villainous J. Edgar Hoover.</LD>
<LD>   The only leftist cliche missing from this sad monument to liberal
gullibility is a scene with Hoover snickering as he twirls a Simon
Legree-like mustache.</LD>

<HD>Sounds Like the Plot of a 'Seinfeld' Episode</HD>
<DH>Television* ABC gives a pilot go-ahead to Ted L. Nancy's
'Letters From a Nut'--but is the author just a figment of Jerry
Seinfeld's imagination?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA de MORAES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seinfeld's back and ABC's got him.</LD>
<LD>   We think.</LD>
<LD>   ABC confirmed that it has cut a deal to make a pilot for a comedy
series based on the "Letters From a Nut" books--collections of
sophomoric letters written to corporate bigwigs, politicians,
celebrities and others easily skewered, and the targets' equally
ridiculous responses.</LD>
<TE>   The three "Nut" books--"Letters From a Nut," "More Letters From a
Nut" and "Extra Nutty! Even More Letters From a Nut"--were written by
one Ted L. Nancy, who is described on the jacket of one of the books
only as "a citizen" in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Each book has an introduction by Jerry Seinfeld, a fact ABC noted
in the first sentence of its news release announcing the deal.</TE>
<TE>   It is widely thought that Nancy is Seinfeld. Various reporters who
have tried to track down Nancy since the first book was published in
1997 have located only a post office box.</TE>
<TE>   Though Seinfeld has repeatedly denied being the pseudonymous
author, he also claims that he, for no financial gain, got the
letters published. He says he found them on a friend's coffee table
while watching the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon in 1995, an
explanation that sounds suspiciously like a rejected story line from
a "Seinfeld" script.</TE>
<TE>   And Seinfeld has compared his relationship with Nancy to that of
Clark Kent and Superman.</TE>
<TE>   And during the pitch meeting at ABC, network Senior Vice President
Andrea Wong confirmed, Seinfeld was present.</TE>
<TE>   And Ted Nancy?</TE>
<TE>   "Oh yeah, and Ted Nancy, I guess," she added.</TE>
<TE>   But Wong insisted that Seinfeld has no commitment to the show and
attended the meeting only because he's "very supportive of the
project" and a pal of one of the executive producers, Barry Marder.</TE>
<TE>   ABC says Nancy will be one of the show's executive producers. But
Marder, not Nancy, is writing the pilot script.</TE>
<TE>   Among Nancy's published letters was one he wrote to the Baseball
Hall of Fame asking if it was interested in Mickey Mantle's toenail
clippings. He wrote a Vegas casino asking if he could gamble there
dressed in his lucky shrimp costume, asked Coca-Cola Co. if he could
market a beverage called Kiet Doke, and wrote to the Los Angeles
Lakers asking if he could attend games in pants that had the back
seat cut out for medical reasons. They all responded: yes, no, no,
yes, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   ABC says each episode of the new show will open with the voice of
the real Nancy composing a new letter, though viewers will never see
him. Nancy's "lovable, idiotic friends and relatives," whom the real
Nancy--assuming you believe there is a real Nancy--will send out into
the world to see what responses his letters have elicited, will be
cast actors, the network acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   Wong says she's met Nancy, but when we asked coyly if he was
"Seinfeldesque," she replied cautiously, "I can't say what he looks
like; he is a very unique individual with a very interesting take on
the world."</TE>
<TE>   So we asked point-blank if Seinfeld is Nancy.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot tell you that," she said. "A lot of people think he is."</TE>

<HD>Shakespeare's Lear at Home on the Range</HD>
<DH>Patrick Stewart stars in 'King of Texas,' a wryly
westernized rendition of the classic tragedy that is reset in 1842
Texas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "King of Texas," one of Shakespeare's greatest plays becomes a
rip-roarin' western about a rancher who unlooses years of resentment
and touches off a land war when he divides his holdings between two
daughters.</LD>
<LD>   A sharp-eyed transfer of "King Lear" to the Texas republic in
1842, the movie--premiering Sunday at 8 p.m. on cable channel
TNT--blows the cobwebs off any preconceived notions about the
original and invites renewed appreciation for Shakespeare's insight
into human nature.</LD>
<LD>   The idea for a western "Lear" is said to have come from star and
executive producer Patrick Stewart. He plays John Lear, a hero of the
Texas war for independence who rules his vast ranch as though he were
its king. Advancing in years and looking to the future, he orders his
three surviving children--all daughters--to declare their love for
him. They will be allotted land equivalent to their affections.</LD>
<TE>   Older sisters Susannah (Marcia Gay Harden) and Rebecca (Lauren
Holly)--Shakespeare's Goneril and Regan--prove quite eloquent, but
young Claudia (Julie Cox)--Cordelia in the original--decries the
falseness of the proceedings and declares that she has nothing to
say.</TE>
<TE>   Lear's reply--"Nothing will come of nothing, speak again," in
Shakespeare's words--becomes "Nothin' can come of nothin'. You'd best
think again" in Stephen Harrigan's wryly westernized screenplay,
directed by Uli Edel.</TE>
<TE>   Lear disowns Claudia but realizes his mistake when Susannah and
Rebecca, suddenly powerful once they come into control of the ranch,
turn around and punish him for years of fatherly neglect.</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca's opportunistic husband (Patrick Bergin) plots the
takeover of a rich parcel across the border in Mexico, while Lear
wanders into lonesome wilderness--gorgeously photographed by Paul
Elliott. Rootless and muddled, Lear is accompanied only by the
no-nonsense Alamo veteran who has become his truest friend (David
Alan Grier, in an exceptionally clever re-imagining of Shakespeare's
wise fool).</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, fellow rancher Westover (Roy Scheider) finds he has
fostered similar discord between his sons, the half-brothers Emmett
(Matt Letscher) and Thomas (Liam Waite).</TE>
<TE>   Stewart touchingly charts Lear's downfall, his body stooping as
his spirit breaks. In madness he finds sanity, setting aside
possessions for the bounty of the heart.</TE>
<TE>   Growing stronger as Lear declines, Harden becomes almost heroic in
her villainy. She's a fiercely intelligent woman who, under different
circumstances, could have made great contributions to this young
land.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "King of Texas" airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on TNT and repeats at 10
p.m. The network has rated it TV-14-L,V (may be unsuitable for
children younger than 14, with advisories for coarse language and
violence).</TE>

<HD>Cairo's 'Millionaire' Unabashedly Takes Palestinian Side in
Conflict</HD>
<DH>Television* When the question is politics, the game show's
final answer is Arab solidarity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NADIA ABOU EL-MAGD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>The Arab world's version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" remains
popular--while its U.S. prime-time counterpart has been dropped by
ABC--and to keep Arab audiences tuning in, the show has added another
ingredient to the mix: politics.</LD>
<LD>   One of host George Kordahi's catch phrases is a bit more topical
than Regis Philbin's "Is that your final answer?"</LD>
<LD>   "Greetings to our steadfast people in Palestine," he says.</LD>
<TE>   Arabs divided by political rivalries and even language--Arabic
dialects can differ greatly--are united by a sense of solidarity with
Palestinians in their confrontation with Israel. Arab politicians
have exploited the Palestinian cause; playwrights and musicians have
written about it. Now a game show has ridden pro-Palestinian
sentiment to become one of the most popular programs in the Middle
East.</TE>
<TE>   Kordahi, a former journalist who covered the civil war in his
native Lebanon, said that he couldn't do a show that ignored serious
current events and that the plight of the Palestinians was the issue
of the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sad like every Arab at what Israel is doing to the
Palestinians, for their huge sacrifices and the blood of the martyrs,
which is reflected on the mood of the show," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Kordahi quizzed three "martyrs' mothers" whose sons
or daughters were killed by Israeli troops. They won a total of
$100,000 and said they would donate it to charities. (The top prize
is 1 million Saudi riyals, or $267,000.)</TE>
<TE>   Produced by the Saudi-owned MBC satellite station, the quiz show
debuted across the Arab world a few months after the Palestinian
intifada began in September 2000. From the start, the television
images of Palestinian-Israeli clashes that dominated the news
programs of MBC and other satellite stations seemed to set the mood
on the show.</TE>
<TE>   Kordahi has become a celebrity. In his late 40s, he is dapper in
designer suits and known for establishing an immediate personal
connection with his guests because of his warm manner and questions
about their families and professions. The "Millionaire" formula
pioneered by Britain's Celador Productions has had a similar effect
on the careers of other hosts. Philbin went from daytime to prime
time and set fashion trends with his monochromatic ties and shirts.
In India, movie star Amitabh Bachchan, whose fortunes had faded
enough that a bank was threatening to sell off his mansion because of
bad debts, got a boost when he began asking "Are you sure?" on his
country's version of the program.</TE>
<TE>   In a live two-hour phone-in question-and-answer session on a
satellite channel based in Lebanon, a woman called to tell Kordahi:
"Your captivating eyes and irresistible smile are the reason for the
show's success."</TE>
<TE>   "Me, a sex symbol? Seriously, I know I'm good-looking, but not to
the extent of being a Prince Charming," Kordahi told the Associated
Press in an interview in the five-star Cairo hotel suite he has made
his home since February.</TE>
<TE>   After the game show established his celebrity and his link to the
Palestinian cause, Kordahi was recruited to help promote a telethon
that collected more than $100 million for the Palestinians in a
single day in April.</TE>
<TE>   (Secretary of State Colin Powell told the Senate in April that
some of the $100 million may have gone to elements of the Islamic
militant group Hamas. U.S. officials said that the Saudi foreign
minister, Prince Saud al Faisal, whose country staged the telethon,
has given assurances that the proceeds were for humanitarian aid
groups.)</TE>
<TE>   "I think I unified their [Arabs'] views, feelings and admiration
around a certain program," Kordahi said. "I helped Arabs to get to
know each other more."</TE>
<TE>   His show promotes pan-Arabism in its questions, asking contestants
about politics and sports in the Arab world and about Islamic culture
and history. Questions drawn from the Koran and Islamic history are
commonplace. Though Kordahi is Christian, he peppers his patter with
verses from the Muslim holy book.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see myself as a Maronite [Christian]. I think of myself
as Lebanese," Kordahi said. "I was born feeling that I belong to this
Arab Islamic civilization."</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably for anything that has drawn such attention, the show
has met with controversy. Last year, a viewer asked Muslim cleric
Nasr Farid Wassel, grand mufti of Egypt, whether such a show was
allowed by Islam, which bans gambling. Wassel declared it and other
high-stakes game shows to be sinful.</TE>
<TE>   But Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, head of the prestigious Al-Azhar
mosque and university and more influential than Wassel, disagreed.
Tantawi said: "These competitions address a series of useful
religious, historical, cultural and scientific questions, and their
goal is to spread knowledge among the public."</TE>
<TE>   Two men have became millionaires so far, the first from the United
Arab Emirates. The second was Palestinian Mohammed Tanira, who said
he drove through the Gaza Strip and Israeli checkpoints to reach the
studio in Cairo.</TE>
<TE>   After Tanira's victory, columnist Mahmoud Mouawad wrote in the
Egyptian daily Al-Ahram: "Palestine won the million."</TE>

<LD>   Franklin Rebuts Tabloid in Defamation Suit</LD>
<LD>   Grammy Award winner Aretha Franklin is suing the Star tabloid
magazine, alleging defamation over a story that said the singer has a
drinking problem that's threatening her life and career.</LD>
<TE>   "The lawsuit is a rebuttal that everything in the article is
false," said Franklin's lead attorney, Barry B. Langberg of Los
Angeles. "Literally millions of people read that garbage."</TE>
<TE>   The Star story, published in December 2000, quotes unidentified
"insiders" and "pals" of Franklin who claimed to be worried about the
60-year-old singer's drinking. They said it had led to her canceling
performances.</TE>

<TE>   In Hollywood, Politics Is a Hot Potato, Poll Finds</TE>
<TE>   More than three in four Americans disapprove of Academy Award
presenters and winners injecting social issues into the annual awards
show, and nearly one in two say they'd try to avoid paying for a film
starring an outspoken actor with whom they disagree.</TE>
<TE>   Those are the findings of a poll conducted for the Hollywood
Reporter and published in the trade paper Friday. The survey was done
by the firm E-Poll, which sampled 1,041 adult Americans of all
political persuasions in March.</TE>
<TE>   Charlton Heston topped the list of celebrities most admired for
their public political stances with 11%, followed by Rosie O'Donnell
(8.7%), Arnold Schwarzenegger (7.7%), Oprah Winfrey and Bono--the
last two tied at 4.4%. Because both Republicans and Democrats were
part of the mix, two of them also made the "least admired" list:
Heston (10.8%) and O'Donnell (9.2%). The latter list was headed by
Jane Fonda (11.8%).</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson to Become a 'Nightline' Regular?</TE>
<TE>   Sam Donaldson has been approached by "Nightline" to become a
contributor--most likely for its new midnight edition to premiere in
early July, ABC sources say.</TE>
<TE>   The ABC news veteran, whom the network is replacing as co-anchor
of "This Week" this summer, is not expected to become a full-time
"Nightline" correspondent or anchor but would be part of a beefed-up
staff when the show expands to an hour. That extra half-hour will
replace "Politically Incorrect With Bill Maher" until Jimmy Kimmel's
new late-night show premieres in January.</TE>
<TE>   The network is said to have picked former Clinton advisor George
Stephanopoulos as solo anchor of "This Week" after Donaldson and
Cokie Roberts leave.</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Philanthropy Fuels Chicago Museum</TE>
<TE>   A collection of 41 drawings, watercolors and monotypes by
Postimpressionist Paul Gauguin has been donated to the new study
center for prints and drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Institute officials also confirmed a previous gift of more than 90
Renaissance and Baroque drawings, including works by Raphael, Titian
and Tintoretto, from Chicago collectors Jean and Steven Goldman.</TE>
<TE>   Though the financial value of the gifts was not divulged,
professional estimates range between $5 million and $10 million for
the Gauguins alone--which were donated by Art Institute trustee
Edward McCormick Blair Sr. His collection is considered to be the
largest single gift of the artist's works on paper to an American
museum and will form the centerpiece of an exhibit next year marking
the centenary of Gauguin's death.</TE>
<TE>   The institute--owner of such high-profile pieces as Edward
Hopper's "Nightthawks" and Seurat's "Sunday Afternoon on the Island
of La Grand Jatte"--already has an international reputation. The new
gifts are expected to provide increased visibility for its 80,000
prints and drawings.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Nora Ephron will direct an adaptation of Larry McMurtry's 1993

<HD>Artist on a Daring Mission</HD>
<DH>Jack Goldstein's paintings, at Luckman Gallery, explore the
boundaries of freedom and a feeling of being untethered in the realm
of utility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just inside the front door of the Luckman Gallery at Cal State L.A.
hangs a painting made of three big masonite panels covered with jet
black enamel. Each contains a small, realistically rendered
astronaut. With no mother ship in sight, and with oxygen tubes
dangling from their hermetically sealed suits like severed umbilical
cords, the lost spacemen are utterly alone, completely detached from
anything that might bring them back to terra firma.</LD>
<LD>   Being alienated from one's surroundings is an experience shared by
many artists, especially in a utilitarian culture such as ours, which
values productivity above all else. Ever since Romanticism, artists
have been called on to explore the furthest reaches of experience,
where they are supposed to discover (and bring back to the rest of
us) the last vestiges of freedom in a world increasingly overrun by
prepackaged sensations and warmed-over amusements.</LD>
<TE>   Jack Goldstein's triptych from 1979 gives chilling form to the
idea that contemporary artists bravely go where no man has gone
before. His little astronauts have done so, and they've either died
trying or are about to. Goldstein doesn't even let them enjoy the
view, which should be spectacular. Having stripped every star from
the heavens, he has abandoned his astronauts to absolute blackness.
This leaves viewers free to contemplate the endless nothingness of
the void--or of art that has no connection to the real world.</TE>
<TE>   But Goldstein's untitled work doesn't merely mock the idea of
painting's autonomy. Turning away from the sterile fantasy of high
art, it embraces more pedestrian references. Its three-part format
recalls frames of film, still images that tell entertaining stories
when seen in sequence. The triptych's bright yellow frames evoke the
tape police use to seal off crime scenes. And its Plexiglas covers
turn it into something of a time capsule.</TE>
<TE>   These elements recur throughout the exhibition, which is itself a
sort of time capsule. Organized by gallery director Julie Joyce, its
11 large paintings date from 1979 to 1990, about a year before
Goldstein stopped making art.</TE>
<TE>   Up until then, he had created an impressive body of work that
includes short films, experimental records and meticulously scripted
performances. (A survey of these was presented last fall at 1301PE ,
a gallery on Wilshire.) Born in Montreal in 1945, educated in Los
Angeles (at Chouinard and CalArts) and based in New York, Goldstein
exhibited internationally, sold regularly and received a fair share
of critical attention. Then he just quit.</TE>
<TE>   Although none of his dazzlingly cool works were meant to be
autobiographical, it's hard not to see his 1979 painting as a
self-portrait, a picture of the artist on the verge of losing his
link to the world and drifting out of sight. In 1993 Goldstein moved
back to Los Angeles, where he has been lying low, teaching an
occasional seminar and working on a 10,000-page book of his musings.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition is focused and timely. Over the last decade, many
young painters, including Philip Argent, Stephen Heer and Adam Ross,
have taken up subjects similar to those Goldstein explored. Others,
such as Tim Bavington, Brad Spence, Amy Wheeler and Yek, have used
similar techniques, airbrushing blurry forms to create sexy images
and hot, hands-off effects.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, Goldstein's show concisely outlines the ways his
art grew in complexity, ambition and accomplishment in the 1980s.
After the first work, almost charming in its handmade simplicity, he
turned to aerial and ground photographs of nighttime firefights from
World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Three of these black-and-white paintings, from 1981, depict
barrages of antiaircraft artillery. A fourth, from 1984, swoops in
for a rooftop view of a church's twin spires silhouetted against a
fiery blaze. All four resemble breathtaking fireworks displays. They
are nearly, but not quite, gorgeous enough to let you forget about
the unseen destruction that accompanied them.</TE>
<TE>   In the next group Goldstein adds color, increases the
sophistication of his visual effects and turns his attention to
natural phenomena. One 8-foot-square painting from 1983 zeros in on a
total eclipse, transforming the rare occurrence into a target's
bull's-eye. Two works from 1985 depict a pair of erupting volcanoes
or two clusters of lightning bolts. Rendered with scientific
precision in a palette so cool it's hot, they make you feel as if
you're seeing double.</TE>
<TE>   The last group of paintings Goldstein made intensifies the
hallucinatory beauty of images derived from science and technology.
The show's best ones, from 1988, resemble supersaturated enlargements
of images transmitted via heat-sensitive monitors. Made of concentric
bands of fluorescent color that radiate outward from glowing hot
spots, these labor-intensive paintings echo the format of contour
maps.</TE>
<TE>   Although the edges of each band are razor sharp, the subtle shifts
in color from one to the next make them look blurry. Clarity and
ambiguity collide in these optically animated abstractions, which
cause viewers to keep blinking in an attempt to disentangle truth
from illusion. Depicting a radically enlarged microscopic view of
human skin, a painting from 1990 does something similar in a palette
of icy reds. Metallic paint and repeated geometric forms add a sci-fi
component to all of these hallucinatory works.</TE>
<TE>   As a whole, "Jack Goldstein: Paintings From the 1980s" shows the
artist to be a master at capturing some of the mystery that lurks
just beneath reality's surface. But an even bigger enigma haunts the
exhibition, infusing it with bittersweet poignancy.</TE>
<TE>   You can't help but wonder what Goldstein would be painting today
if he hadn't abandoned his talents. In this sense, the show attests
to the hidden costs of creativity, the invisible difficulties that
sometimes make being an artist an impossible proposition.</TE>

<HD>British Recording Artists Vanish From Billboard Chart</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>The British music industry is singing the blues: U.S. fans have lost
that lovin' feelin'.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, for the first time since 1963, there were no British
artists in the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart--and now some in the
industry here are calling for a music "embassy" to promote their
artists in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Americans who embraced Beatlemania, progressive rock and the New
Romantics have been left cold by Britpop and U.K. garage. A music
industry report released this week says the British share of
Billboard's annual top 100 albums chart has plummeted from a high of
32% in 1986--when bands such as Duran Duran, Pet Shop Boys and Simple
Minds rode the British wave--to just 0.2% in 1999 and 1.7% in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, the share was 8.8%--but more than one-third of the
British sales were of a single album, the Beatles' "1" anthology.</TE>
<TE>   Industry figures are so worried they have urged the government to
set up a musical mission in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The report published this week, "Make or Break--Supporting U.K.
Music in the U.S.A.," said a British music office in New York could
provide record companies and managers with information, office
facilities and industry contacts. The report was put out by the Assn.
of Independent Music, an industry group, and the British Council,
which promotes British culture overseas.</TE>
<TE>   "Other countries are having far more impact in the U.S., which is
slightly embarrassing and somewhat upsetting," said Guy Holmes,
founder of Gut Records. "The U.S. market is very complex, and if we
can put people in place over there with a good knowledge of it, we
have a much better chance."</TE>
<TE>   The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has said it will
consider the report's findings. But John Aizlewood, a London-based
music writer and broadcaster, says the idea of a New York-based
British music office smacks of desperation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ludicrous. You can't force people to listen to music, and
you can't run the music industry on a quota system."</TE>

<HD>A World of Sculpture in Michigan</HD>
<DH>Art* A botanical garden in Grand Rapids adds an adjacent
park to display an international collection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES PRICHARD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Set among trees, streams, waterfalls, hills and meadows, two dozen
works by some of the greatest sculptors of the past century have a
new, natural home in the outdoors of western Michigan.</LD>
<LD>   The 30-acre Frederik Meijer Gardens &amp; Sculpture Park expands on a
botanical garden that philanthropist and retailer Fred Meijer
visualized as a way to showcase the sculptures that he collected over
the years. Since the original Frederik Meijer Gardens opened in April
1995, more than 1 million visitors have explored its 125 acres.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout the grounds are more than 100 sculptures, including
perhaps the most popular attraction: a 24-foot-high prancing stallion
by artist Nina Akamu based on a design sketched by Leonardo da Vinci.</LD>
<TE>   The statue, said to be the largest bronze equine sculpture in the
Western Hemisphere, was dedicated in October 1999. The sometimes
thrilling, sometimes frustrating process of acquiring the magnificent
piece stimulated Meijer's interest in fine art and led to his
decision to expand the outdoor collection by creating the separate
but adjacent sculpture park.</TE>
<TE>   Meijer, whose Walker-based company Meijer Inc. operates 153
super-centers that sell groceries and general merchandise in five
Midwestern states, says he set out to "create the finest sculpture
park in the world that we can afford."</TE>
<TE>   The new park can accommodate about 80 pieces but initially will
feature 24 significant works by Auguste Rodin, Henry Moore, Magdalena
Abakanowicz and other modern sculptors.</TE>
<TE>   "These are not backyard Sunday artists. These are world-class
international artists, and they're household names to anybody that
knows anything about sculpture," says Benbow Bullock, a sculptor from
Vallejo, Calif., who runs a Web site about the world's sculpture
parks.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors should notice a difference between many of the statues
found in the garden and the works of art installed in the new park.
Expect to spend a couple of hours strolling the paths that extend
from the botanical garden and wind through the meticulously
landscaped sculpture area.</TE>
<TE>   "What's in the sculpture park is intended to be much more
intellectually, emotionally, visually challenging," says Joe
Becherer, curator of sculpture. "I really see it more as an outdoor
museum, an open-air museum."</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with the natural beauty of the botanical garden, strict
attention has been paid to landscaping to ensure that pieces are
viewable from several vantage points. Each piece is on a spot in the
park specifically designed to showcase it.</TE>
<TE>   One of the featured artists, Richard Hunt, a Chicagoan with a
satellite studio in Benton Harbor, says he has never before been
involved in a project in which so much planning has gone into a site
for one of his works.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first time that I've ever been accommodated that way,
with the sculpture and the site designed collaboratively," says Hunt.</TE>
<TE>   His 25-foot-high "Column of the Free Spirit" was the first
large-scale work commissioned for the park. There's a different story
behind the acquisition of the pieces, which were variously obtained
from museums, private collectors, foundries or other sources.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Rodin's "Eve," Frederik Meijer Gardens in late 2000
acquired one of 12 statues cast from a plaster model that the artist
sculpted in 1881. It had been part of a French family's private
collection and never publicly displayed.</TE>
<TE>   Meijer and his staff won't disclose the cost of constructing the
sculpture park or acquiring any of its works. However, one casting of
"Eve" sold for $1 million in November 1998, and another sold for $4.4
million a year later, according to Sotheby's, the international
auction house.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's natural that people want to know, 'Well, how much
did that thing cost?' But I would be very concerned that that would
be the wrong reason for looking at them," says Henry Matthews,
director of galleries and collections at Grand Valley State
University. He just completed six years as a member of the garden's
board of directors and served as co-chairman of its sculpture
committee.</TE>
<TE>   Grand Rapids is no stranger to public modern art. The city made
national headlines on June 14, 1969, when it dedicated a 4-story-tall
abstract stabile by Alexander Calder. It was the first sculpture
funded by a new public arts program of the National Endowment for the
Arts.</TE>
<TE>   The bright red, 42-ton sculpture, which consists of several
interconnecting arched panes, is called "La Grande Vitesse," French
for "great swiftness," a reference to the Grand River that courses
through the heart of Grand Rapids on its way to Lake Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Initially disliked by many residents of the conservative city, it
has long since become a point of community pride and a must-see sight
for many out-of-towners.</TE>

<LD>The mind's eye is a terrible thing to waste, which is a lesson lost
on Comedy Central's "Crank Yankers." Premiering at 10:30 p.m. Sunday,
it yokes the art of the prank phone call to a bastardized version of
"The Muppet Show," resulting in a program that's less than the sum of
its parts.</LD>
<LD>   The calls are from real life, perpetrated by comics such as Jimmy
Kimmel and Denis Leary on unsuspecting folks. Rather than being of
the "Do you have Prince Albert in a can?" variety, the ruses unfold
elaborately a la Steve Allen's in the '50s or the Jerky Boys' in the
'90s.</LD>
<LD>   The opening segment features Dave Chappelle posing as the Wu-Tang
Clan's manager, who seeks lodging for a dozen rappers in a tiny
bed-and-breakfast. It's clear that Reba, the B&amp;B's churchgoing owner,
doesn't entirely grasp the Wu-Tang's wild reputation when she asks
for the caller's name.</LD>
<TE>   "This Shavin. S-H-A-V-I-N. Like I'm shavin' my face," Chappelle
replies.</TE>
<TE>   "Neat! And you're a rock group or ... ?"</TE>
<TE>   "Straight hip-hop, yo, from the streets. Hard-core ... "</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, cute!"</TE>
<TE>   " ... the real deal, wee' smokers, y'know what I'm sayin'?"</TE>
<TE>   "My daughters probably know this. I have a daughter who teaches
swing."</TE>
<TE>   It sounds funny enough. But looks are a different matter, and this
is where "Crank Yankers" falters. The creators--"The Man Show" hosts
Kimmel and Adam Carolla as well as "Man Show" producer Daniel
Kellison--chose puppets to provide the visuals to the often profane
and stereotypical material.</TE>
<TE>   Half the fun of listening to a prank call is envisioning the
participants, and for each listener the mental picture is tailor-made
to his or her funny bone. "Crank Yankers," however, bows to an age in
which nothing is left to the imagination by having its Muppet-like
creatures mouth the words. What's worse, by Episodes 2 and 3, there
is full-frontal, anatomically correct puppet nudity.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, you have to wonder what was running through the
creators' minds and why they had to run out and catch it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Crank Yankers" premieres Sunday at 10:30 p.m. on Comedy Central.
The network has rated it TV-14 (may be unsuitable for children
younger than 14).</TE>

<HD>A Tribute to the Unknown Stuntmen</HD>
<DH>Hollywood* A new TCM documentary kicks off a monthlong
celebration of the craft.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stuntmen Loren Janes and Tony Brubaker have spent a combined total of
80 years working in movies and television. Mostly recently seen in
"Spider-Man," Janes doubled for Steve McQueen for more than 20 years,
while Brubaker has been Danny Glover's double since the first "Lethal
Weapon" in 1987. Although they are well-known within the stunt
community, each feels his profession should remain anonymous. "I
don't want people to know what I do for a living," Brubaker said.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, the two emerge from the shadows to talk about their
craft in the new Turner Classic Movies documentary "Behind the
Action: Stuntmen in Movies," which premieres Saturday on the cable
network and kicks off a monthlong tribute to stuntmen and their
craft. Among the films scheduled this month are "The Great Escape,"
"Rollerball," "Bullitt," "Spartacus" and the 1920 swashbuckler "The
Mark of Zorro."</LD>
<LD>   Janes said he never told anyone that he doubled McQueen while the
actor was alive. "I would say, 'I am the stuntman who works with
Steve McQueen. I set up all the stunts, but he does his own stunts,'"
he said. "People are paying to see Steve McQueen, not Loren Janes. I
like being anonymous. We are making the actors look like they are
doing it. That's our job."</LD>
<TE>   Brubaker added that while it's nice to see attention being paid to
the feats of stuntmen past and present, he has mixed emotions about
the special and tribute. "When you expose yourself too much to the
rest of the world about what you do and how you do it, then a kid
from Arkansas will say, 'I can do that,' and here they come to
California and now the market gets flooded," he said. "There is an
overpopulation of stunt people."</TE>
<TE>   In 1954, when he started doing stunts, Janes was training to be an
opera singer and teaching calculus and trigonometry at a San Fernando
Valley high school to pay for his studies. Through high school and
college he competed in swimming, diving, gymnastics and water polo
and later competed in the Olympic trials in 1956 and '64 in the
modern pentathlon.</TE>
<TE>   "I had never heard of a stuntman," he said. "At the time, MGM was
looking for three stuntmen to do an 80-foot dive off a cliff at
Catalina for an Esther Williams picture. The stuntmen who were
capable of diving that high were away on location."</TE>
<TE>   Janes had put on water shows and diving exhibitions at the school
to raise funds for band uniforms, and one of his students mentioned
him to his father, an executive at MGM. The next day, he received a
call from the studio. "I went down after work, and they hired me.
About a month later, another studio called and said they wanted me do
some gymnastics in a film because MGM recommended me. After six
months, I had worked in seven movies; the principal called me in and
said, 'You either teach school or work in pictures.' I said, 'I'll
see you later.'"</TE>
<TE>   Brubaker grew up around horses and began doing stunts for actor
Otis Young in the 1969 ABC western "The Outcasts," as well as another
short-lived series, "The Young Rebels" with Louis Gossett Jr.</TE>
<TE>   His big break involved a high jump on the Henry Fonda film "There
Was a Crooked Man," in which he had to run atop a building, dive 16
feet, tackle a man and then fall off the building. "A thousand guys
could do the fall, but to get a guy to run on a 2-by-12-foot plank,
there was no one who could do that there," he said. "I was blessed
with really good legs and the ability to jump that far. I got a lot
of publicity out of it within the stunt community."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, he worked with such stars as Jim Brown and Sidney
Poitier. Most recently, he doubled Michael Clarke Duncan on "The
Scorpion King."</TE>
<TE>   Janes has been responsible for executing some of film's most
amazing stunts, such as his leap off a train going 30 miles an hour
in "How the West Was Won," hitting the top of a 16-foot cactus and
riding it over a cliff. In "Swiss Family Robinson," he had to wrestle
a 28-foot snake.</TE>
<TE>   "Two stuntmen did that and we were rendered unconscious 8 times in
three weeks," Janes said. "It took 19 guys to jump in and pull the
snake off of us. The snake would have two or three coils around me
and it would just crush us and we would start to pass out."</TE>
<TE>   In his 48 years in the business, Janes has never broken a bone.
Brubaker admits he's also been pretty lucky, though he suffered a
broken leg on "Rollerball" and injured his shoulder while working on
the movie "Gone Fishin.'"</TE>
<TE>   Janes has officially retired from performing stunts and now
concentrates on working as a stunt coordinator and second unit
director. Brubaker is starting to follow in Janes' footsteps. "You
start limiting yourself physically because you get smart and say, 'I
can't do this too much more,'" Brubaker said.</TE>
<TE>   "Behind the Action" also features interviews with veteran stunt
coordinator and director Terry Leonard; Bob Yerkes, the inventor of
the airbag for stunt use; and swordsmen Victor Paul and Bobby Hay.</TE>
<TE>   Janes co-founded the Stuntmen's Assn. 40 years ago, and he and
Brubaker say their profession is going through rocky times,
especially because so many film and television productions are shot
outside the United States to keep costs down.</TE>
<TE>   According to Janes, computerized stunts have also reduced work for
stuntmen by about 50%. "They are overdoing it," he said. "Some of the
stars look like Superman, and audiences are smiling and laughing
rather than getting frightened or scared. It's all becoming like a
'Spider-Man' comic-book thing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Behind the Action: Stuntmen in the Movies" premieres today at 5
p.m. on TCM, followed at 5:30 by "The Devil's Brigade" and "The Great
Escape" at 7:45. The festival continues Mondays and Saturdays through
June 29.</TE>

<HD>'The Osbournes' Conquers Britain</HD>
<DH>Television* Beverly Hills' favorite MTV family garners
critical raves and huge (for the U.K.) cable numbers in its first
airing in the singer's homeland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL SUTCLIFFE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Picture this. It's next Monday night at Buckingham Palace, the grand
finale of Queen Elizabeth II's jubilee concert. Stars of the British
rock 'n' roll firmament crowd the platform to sing loyal choruses of
"All You Need Is Love," and there stands our austere monarch
center-stage arm in arm with ... it can't be. But it is. Rock's
onetime Prince of Darkness. It's Ozzy Osbourne.</LD>
<LD>   Well, that's the U.K.'s favorite fantasy about the 50th
anniversary celebrations. But the truth is, British imaginations
would never have had the chance to run amok in this anarchic fashion
without MTV's "The Osbournes," which hit these shores last weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Rarely has a new television show been more ecstatically received.
The dignified broadsheets gushed: "absolutely inspired" (the
Guardian) and "fantastic" (the Observer). Daily tabloid the Mirror
said, "'The Osbournes' is the only place you want to be this summer.
Make up the spare bed, Ozzy, I'm coming to stay." Self-styled "cool"
celebrity magazine Heat frothed that it was "TV heaven." And the
late-night review segment on BBC-TV's politically heavyweight
"Newsnight" quite lost its marbles: "Perhaps the greatest program in
the entire history of TV. It's 'King Lear' meets 'The Simpsons.'"</LD>
<TE>   Obviously, MTV U.K. has a hit on its hands. On Monday, its
managing director, Michiel Bakker, could crow that "The Osbournes'"
first airing had been "a huge critical and ratings success," promise
"many more weeks of compulsive viewing" and pronounce himself
"massively excited" (which would have brought a snigger from the
double entendre-aware Osbourne).</TE>
<TE>   The ratings supported the adjectives. Episode 1 multiplied MTV
U.K.'s average audience by 10, which sounds great, but in fact
somewhat distorts the extent of the Osbournes' effect. The program is
not the national tea-break topic of the day just yet. MTV's modest
U.K. foothold means they were actually celebrating 500,000 viewers,
when a normal week's national chart-topper would chalk up well over
10 million.</TE>
<TE>   Much like Ozzy, the U.K. is an oddball when it comes to TV
watching. Alkarim Jivani, TV editor of London listings magazine Time
Out, says: "The British are very snobbish about satellite and cable
TV. In a recent survey, 20% said they wouldn't have it in their house
even if it was given to them for nothing. Most of these people are in
the [upscale] social bracket. So the multichannel audience here is
proportionately smaller, younger and skewed towards the less
wealthy."</TE>
<TE>   MTV's Bakker responds that, on the initial evidence, "The
Osbournes" pulled in a somewhat older and more prosperous audience
than the station's norm. But he acknowledges that, although a wider
populace caught the publicity blast, for now the majority has only a
hypothetical notion of what the fuss is about. However, next week MTV
U.K. is expecting to announce that, after a fierce bidding war, one
of the broadcast stations has bought the rights to rerun "The
Osbournes."</TE>
<TE>   At which point the joy of critics and MTV viewers will indeed be
unconfined as the rum doings of these extraordinary British
characters are appreciated in a peculiarly British way.</TE>
<TE>   "For Americans, the Osbournes must be the new 'Beverly
Hillbillies,'" reckons Jivani. "They got rich and they don't know how
to deal with it. But we're far more class-conscious and aware of all
the nuances of their background in Birmingham," the rugged industrial
city in the Midlands.</TE>
<TE>   The Guardian's rock critic, Alexis Petridis, says, "To us, the
Osbournes are not dysfunctional or exotic, they're an over-amplified
version of an average British family who just happen to live in a
Beverly Hills mansion. With the exception of 'The Simpsons,' I think
American television sanitizes families, but the British enjoy taking
this hangdog view of themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Q magazine executive editor Mark Blake expresses himself
patriotically fond of "the scene when their dog was [defecating]
everywhere and Sharon gets a pet therapist in, but Ozzy won't go for
it. He says, 'I'll tell you how to stop it ... someone gets up in the
morning, opens the door and let's him out!' Ozzy just wouldn't buy
into that L.A. thing."</TE>
<TE>   But this is how every conversation with one of the happy U.K. crew
who's seen "The Osbournes" ends--in affectionate recall. Heat's Mark
Frith, who recently won the U.K. magazine editor of the year award,
says it's "a rare beast, a program that's even better than the hype,"
then waxes sentimental about "this warm family who really love each
other."</TE>
<TE>   Jivani breaks off from demographic considerations to emphasize
that Ozzy's unique character is the key, that "me too" imitations
will not work--and wasn't it great in the first episode when Ozzy
yells at the kids, "You've got to respect me, I'm ... how old am I,
Sharon?"</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Mrs. Osbourne, she is naturally in top form as she
contemplates the improbable events of the year on both sides of the
Atlantic: the dinner with President Bush at the White House
correspondents' dinner and the upcoming performance for the queen.</TE>
<TE>   "Life is so ironic," she says, with feeling. "My husband's lived
one hell of a life, but we've just tried to take everything in our
stride."</TE>
<TE>   He even has the blessing of Black Sabbath, his former bandmates,
although they seem unlikely to benefit from any reflected glory. Bass
player Geezer Butler, whose friendship with Ozzy goes back to tough
times 30 years ago in Birmingham, says: "It's absolutely brilliant.
They're a great family, and what you see is real life. I'm very glad
he is getting the attention he deserves. It's phenomenal. It's
Osbourne mania!"</TE>

<HD>Nero Wolfe Is Back, With 'Too Many Clients'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROLYN PATRICIA SCOTT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Murder is a tragedy, except when it's an art form fit for the pages
of a pulp novel, the wide screen or for television, as in Sunday
night's Nero Wolfe mystery (8 p.m., A&amp;E). In this case, murder is a
brain-twisting exercise in logic.</LD>
<LD>   The ruminating detective created by Rex Stout in a series of
novels begun in 1934 is played to perfection by Maury Chaykin in this
latest TV incarnation (William Conrad played him in a 1981 series on
NBC), now in its second season. Sunday's installment, the two-part
"Too Many Clients"--the case of the puzzling murder of one Thomas
Yeager--is expertly tailored for the portly sleuth and his loquacious
legman, Archie Goodwin, superbly played by Timothy Hutton.</LD>
<LD>   Wolfe and Goodwin form an uneven partnership of opposites. The
weight--both in pounds and in brain cells--is thrown mightily to
Wolfe, but it's Goodwin who drives and drolly narrates the story, as
he hauls in the suspects in Yeager's demise--the actress, the
secretary, the landlord, the professor, the widow--and parks them at
Wolfe's door. When the mastermind attempts to sort through the lies
and alibis, Goodwin enforces civility until they "cry Wolfe"--and
four suspects become clients, desperate to clear their names.</LD>
<TE>   The setting is posh 1950s New York, but the dialogue--full of
wisecracking private detectives and cops, fast-talking mugs and the
patois of pretentious society women and their high-priced
mouthpieces--tracks back to the noir detective sagas of the '40s.
Watching Nero and Archie is a lot like reading a good mystery you
can't put down.</TE>

<HD>Wendy's Agrees to Buy Baja Fresh for $275 Million</HD>
<DH>Restaurants: Deal would give the Mexican-food fast-casual
chain the capital for expansion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seeking to capitalize on the sizzling "fast-casual" market, Wendy's
International Inc. said Friday that it agreed to buy the parent
company of Baja Fresh Mexican Grill for $275 million in cash.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, coming just weeks after the Thousand Oaks-based
Mexican-food chain announced plans for an initial public stock
offering, would give Baja Fresh the capital and marketing muscle to
expand rapidly in the fast-casual sector, the fastest-growing part of
the restaurant industry.</LD>
<LD>   Wendy's Chief Executive Jack Schuessler said his company can
expand Baja Fresh to as many as 700 restaurants within five years,
from 169 now.</LD>
<TE>   The deal "allows us to have access to a lot of capital and to grow
more quickly than we would have," said Greg Dollarhyde, president and
CEO of Baja Fresh, who would continue to head the Mexican chain after
the merger.</TE>
<TE>   "Baja Fresh is clearly the quality leader in the Mexican
fast-casual category, and we feel fast-casual is where [the trends]
are going," Schuessler said.</TE>
<TE>   Fast-casual chains, which combine the speed of fast food with the
quality and freshness of casual dining at a moderate price, are
gaining popularity among consumers who want healthier fare than
traditional fast food.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh Enterprises Inc., Baja Fresh's parent, would continue to be
based in the Southland and operate as a wholly owned Wendy's
subsidiary. No layoffs are expected at Baja Fresh, which had an
operating profit of $6.4 million, before charges, on sales of $72.8
million in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy's, the nation's No. 3 fast-food chain, wants to acquire Baja
Fresh's restaurants in 16 states and the District of Columbia to help
it meet a goal of profit growth of 12% to 15% over the next decade,
Schuessler said.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street reacted favorably to the deal. Wendy's shares jumped
$1.97 to $37.97 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   With growth in the huge fast-food market slowing to 1% to 2% a
year, several industry leaders recently have acquired or invested in
fast-casual chains.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's Corp., the world's largest fast-food chain, said
recently it plans to jointly develop as many as 30 outlets with
Fazoli's, a Kentucky-based fast-casual chain of about 400
restaurants. Previously, the Golden Arches acquired Boston Market,
Donatos Pizzeria and a majority share in Chipotle, a fresh-Mex chain.</TE>
<TE>   CKE Restaurants Inc., parent of the Carl's Jr. chain, recently
snapped up the 95-outlet La Salsa chain, a key Baja Fresh competitor.
And in February, Wendy's invested $10 million for a 45% stake in Cafe
Express, a Houston-based chain of 13 restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy's first-quarter net profit rose 12% to $43.4 million.
Revenue jumped 10% to $612.4 million.</TE>

<HD>Reports Point to Sound Recovery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. manufacturing is on a firmer footing, reports released Friday
showed, and combined with large productivity gains and better
consumer sentiment, the data provided more evidence that a sound
economic recovery is underway.</LD>
<LD>   "The recovery in the manufacturing sector means that the weakest
part of the U.S. economy is now on the mend," said Mark Vitner,
economist at Wachovia Securities.</LD>
<LD>   Manufacturing in the Midwest jumped to a three-year high in May,
according to the National Assn. of Purchasing Management's Chicago
branch. Its index surged to 60.8, the highest level since April 1999
and up from 54.7 in the previous month.</LD>
<TE>   The May reading marked the fourth consecutive month above 50,
which points to an expanding regional manufacturing economy.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said orders for U.S.
manufactured items in April posted their biggest increase since
October 2001, gaining a larger-than-expected 1.2% to $323.9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   That report also showed that business investment, closely watched
by economists because it is crucial for a sustained recovery, is on
the mend.</TE>
<TE>   Orders for machinery rose 4.5% in the month, the biggest rise
since March 2000, while orders for electrical equipment and
appliances rose 9.6%. Demand for computer and electronic products
grew 3%.</TE>
<TE>   "The third cylinder of the economic engine, capital spending, has
really begun to fire, and this is a signal of improving business
confidence," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo.</TE>
<TE>   There was other good news for the economy. A Labor Department
report showed productivity rocketed ahead in the first quarter,
rising 8.4% as profit-seeking American businesses squeezed more out
of their workers. This met expectations even though it was slightly
below the previously reported 8.6% rise.</TE>
<TE>   The productivity report showed little evidence of inflation with
unit labor costs, a gauge of wage pressure, dropping 5.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers also are doing their bit to underpin the recovery.
Another report showed sentiment rose in May to its highest level in
11/2 years as a steadily improving economy and a measure of calm in
the Mideast helped lift consumers' assessment of the present and
future hopes.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Michigan's final May consumer sentiment index
rose to 96.9 from 93 in April, beating expectations and slightly
above the preliminary May reading of 96 released two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   The good news could spur more talk that the Federal Reserve will
tighten credit this summer, analysts said. However, Treasury bond
yields showed only small increases Friday. The two-year T-note yield
rose to 3.20% from 3.15% on Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Glendale Investigating Utility's Link to Enron</HD>
<DH>Energy: Probe will examine whether any of the city's excess
electricity was used in trading ploys.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Glendale officials said Friday that they were investigating whether
power traders for the city's utility knowingly participated in
controversial electricity trading ploys with Enron Corp. and another
company to boost prices in California's deregulated markets.</LD>
<LD>   City officials said the probe would examine whether any of the
city's excess electricity was used in schemes detailed in recently
disclosed Enron memos, including tactics to circumvent state price
caps and create false congestion.</LD>
<LD>   "At this point, we're not sure that our guys knew about these
strategies or if they [the outside trading companies] were just doing
them for us," said Steven G. Lins, an assistant city attorney.</LD>
<TE>   Glendale Water &amp; Power is the first municipal utility to say it
may have participated in Enron-style trading ploys.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported Friday that internal Enron documents obtained
by state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) through subpoena indicate that
some municipal utilities may have cooperated with Enron and profited
financially from the trading strategies revealed recently in legal
memos written in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn, who has not released the documents obtained by subpoena,
said they speak of "profit-sharing agreements" between Enron and
municipal utilities. Sources have said that two of the utilities
mentioned are the Los Angeles Department of Water &amp; Power and the
Glendale utility.</TE>
<TE>   The DWP has denied any profit-sharing relationship with Enron but
has acknowledged selling Enron and other traders excess capacity on
its transmission lines.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale, however, had a profit-sharing agreement with Enron from
June 1999 to June 2000, City Manager James E. Starbird said in a
statement. Starbird said such an agreement was not unusual:
"Businesses do this on a daily basis."</TE>
<TE>   Glendale Water &amp; Power provides electric and water service to more
than 78,000 residents and businesses. The city utility generates its
own power and also buys power from outside sources.</TE>
<TE>   Enron contracted to sell the electricity that Glendale did not
need for its own customers, and during that year Glendale split
profit with Enron on a 75%-25% split.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale's 75% share brought in $3.9 million, Starbird said.
California has asked federal regulators to grant $8.9 billion in
refunds because of alleged electricity overcharges.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the big picture, we're a minor player," Starbird
said.</TE>
<TE>   In August 2000, Glendale signed a five-year contract with
Houston-based Coral Power, a trading company partly owned by Shell
Oil Co., to manage energy services and sell excess power.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale has a different profit-sharing arrangement with Coral,
Lins said. Coral had denied using Enron-style trading ploys, but its
name appears in handwritten notes from meetings between Enron traders
and lawyers discussing trading strategies used in the California
market. Coral is characterized in the notes as a trader that employed
some similar techniques.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   City Cooperating With Legislative Committee</TE>
<TE>   State and federal regulators have stepped up their investigations
of market manipulation during the California energy crisis since the
release last month of internal Enron memos detailing the company's
use of tactics to keep power supplies tight and prices high.</TE>
<TE>   The Times on Friday reported the existence of another Enron memo,
dated Oct. 30, 2000, that indicated that Enron continued to pursue
the questionable trading tactics even after it was warned by
attorneys that doing so could open them to possible criminal
liability.</TE>
<TE>   Enron has characterized the memo as a broad discussion of legal
issues and not a warning about specific trading practices.</TE>
<TE>   Starbird said the city was cooperating with Dunn's committee but
"does not want to be a party to a search for a political scapegoat."</TE>
<TE>   Glendale officials described their relationship with Enron in a
letter sent Friday by Ignacio R. Troncoso, director of Glendale Water
&amp; Power, to state Sen. Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside). Morrow is vice
chairman of a committee, chaired by Dunn, that is investigating
manipulation of California's energy markets.</TE>
<TE>   A Dunn spokesman could not be reached for comment. Morrow's
spokesman said the senator had not seen Glendale's letter and could
not comment.</TE>

<HD>Analyst's Global Crossing Ties Accentuate Concerns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS and JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Details about the unusually cozy relationship between Wall Street's
star telecommunications analyst and Global Crossing Ltd. sent shock
waves Friday through an industry already struggling to regain
credibility amid charges of rampant conflicts-of-interest.</LD>
<LD>   Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jack Grubman, once the highest-paid
industry researcher on Wall Street, was in constant contact with
Global Crossing's chairman for years. He wielded such clout that he
had a hand in the hiring of former Chief Executive Bob Annunziata,
and in the company's negotiations to buy Frontier Corp. and U.S. West
Inc., according to sources and a published report.</LD>
<LD>   Although none of Grubman's alleged actions appear to break any
laws, they highlight concerns that certain powerful analysts had a
larger role than previously thought in shaping the dramatic rise of
little-known companies during the market boom of the 1990s. And they
may have been too involved in stirring up new investment banking
deals to produce objective research reports for investors.</LD>
<TE>   Grubman was an enthusiastic Global Crossing backer and maintained
a "buy" rating on the stock during its long fall and downgraded the
stock only two months before the company filed for bankruptcy
protection.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, it was revealed that the top U.S. financial regulator
is pursuing 10 investigations of possible conflicts of interest by
analysts. Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) said Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt informed him of the probes,
as well as 37 pending enforcement inquiries by the self-regulatory
organizations supervising major stock exchanges.</TE>
<TE>   Markey said the allegations include investment banking conflicts
with analysts, which was the focus of New York Atty. Gen. Eliot
Spitzer's landmark investigation of leading brokerage Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. Some of the probes involve analysts allegedly trading stocks they
covered and, in one instance, an analyst allegedly being paid by an
issuer of stock.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill settled with Spitzer's office for $100 million and
initiated reforms aimed at keeping research independent from
investment banking, which can be a lucrative source of income for
brokerages. Other brokerages such as Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon have
pledged similar changes.</TE>
<TE>   Darren Dopp, spokesman for the New York attorney general's office,
said the Grubman "revelations interest us greatly," but added that
it's too soon to tell whether they will play a key role in Spitzer's
continuing probe.</TE>
<TE>   The accounts involving Grubman, first made public in the Wall
Street Journal, paint a picture of ineptitude at Global Crossing,
which rose to be worth more than $54 billion but fell hard after
spending billions building a worldwide fiber-optic network. The firm,
more than $22 billion in debt, filed for bankruptcy protection
Jan.28.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman built such a strong relationship with Global Crossing
Chairman Gary Winnick that he and Salomon had a role in all of Global
Crossing's deals and stock offerings, from the company's initial
public offering to various merger deals and bond offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said Grubman's influence at Global Crossing eclipsed that
of John Otto, Salomon's lead telecom investment banker.</TE>
<TE>   "Gary was on the phone with Jack all the time," said a person
involved in the situation who did not want to be identified. The
relationship grew so tight that at a glitzy dinner at Claridge's
Hotel in London, Winnick seated Grubman with him at the lead table,
along with then-Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and former British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to say that the particulars are pretty surprising," said
Susan Kalla, an analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey who was among the
first to doubt the viability of many upstart fiber networkers. "It's
just frightening that someone running a multibillion-dollar business
would trust the judgment of an analyst that, by definition, has such
different motivations."</TE>
<TE>   Salomon executives declined to comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Winnick declined to discuss specifics of Winnick's
relationship with Grubman.</TE>
<TE>   Securities lawyers said the Grubman allegations will help them
press arbitration cases or class-action suits against Salomon and
other brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows that Jack Grubman is the king of the conflicted
analysts, basically serving as an investment banker and as a
financial advisor to the company, none of which was disclosed to
investors," said Jacob Zamansky, a lawyer representing an investor
who claims to have lost his life savings of $455,000 by following
Grubman's advice.</TE>
<TE>   In early May, the SEC signed off on reforms proposed by the
self-regulatory agencies aimed at stemming widespread conflicts.
Among other things, the rules prohibit analysts from promising or
threatening to withhold favorable research to induce investment
banking business from companies, and bar firms from linking analyst
pay to a specific banking deal.</TE>

<DH>Asia: Moody's downgrade infuriates the government, which
had protested the action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>The world's second-largest economy suffered a deep psychological blow
Friday when its credit rating was slashed two notches by Moody's
Investors Service, which said Japan's debt levels are approaching
"uncharted territory."</LD>
<LD>   The country's yen-denominated government bonds, in theory, now are
less credit-worthy than those of Botswana, Chile and the Czech
Republic, and on par with Poland and Cyprus.</LD>
<LD>   It was the latest economic embarrassment for Japan, which little
more than a decade ago seemed invincible, its corporate titans
snapping up Hollywood studios and prime U.S. real estate at premium
prices.</LD>
<TE>   These days, the dominant headlines are about rising unemployment,
bankruptcies, bad loans and politicians too weak-willed to do
anything to correct the course.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Japan's financial markets largely took the expected
news in stride. The Nikkei-225 stock index eased less than 0.1%. The
yen, which has been surging against the dollar in recent weeks, was
little changed until the Bank of Japan stepped in again to try and
weaken the currency. It fell in New York trading to 124.38 per dollar
from 123.05 Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The Moody's downgrade took Japan's yen-denominated securities to
A2 from Aa3, affecting $5.4 trillion of debt. Moody's left Japan's
foreign-currency bonds rated Aa1.</TE>
<TE>   The move by the U.S.-based rating firm infuriated the Japanese
government--which had taken the rare step of protesting the
anticipated action before it happened Friday. It was Moody's second
downgrade of Japanese securities in six months.</TE>
<TE>   The Finance Ministry blasted Moody's. "They're only concerned
about the direction of a country, but the purpose of the rating is to
measure default risk, and if you consider that, the rating's not
appropriate," said spokesman Masaki Omura.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi blamed Moody's for causing
Japanese "to begin to lose confidence in themselves." He contended
that the rating shows only part of the picture, neglecting Japan's
"staying power" and economic fundamentals.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the ratings given by those same ratings agencies
to Latin American countries and African countries--the same countries
that Japan is providing assistance to--Japan's rating has gone below
the ratings for some of these countries," Koizumi recently told
reporters. "How is that possible?"</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the rating does seem somewhat ironic. Japan remains by far
the largest net creditor country in the world, whereas the U.S. is a
net debtor. And Japan still sits on the world's largest pile of
savings.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, most economists think the possibility of default--which
is what the credit rating is supposed to grade--is minute.</TE>
<TE>   "The likelihood of Japan missing a debt payment is virtually nil,"
said Robert Feldman, economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.</TE>
<TE>   Even Moody's said it "assigns a very low probability" to a
default. Japan's large pool of household savings, the ability of the
banking system to absorb substantially higher levels of government
debt, and the small scale of the government's exposure to foreign
creditors should avert any such possibility, Moody's said. All but
about 5% of Japanese bonds are held by domestic investors, versus
one-quarter to one-third of bonds in countries such as the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   But Moody's was taking aim at Japan's broad economic direction.
"Japan's general government indebtedness, however measured, will
approach levels unprecedented in the postwar era in the developed
world, and that as such Japan will be entering 'unchartered
territory,'" it said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's debt stands at about 140% of its output, or gross domestic
product.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, at least, the lower credit rating should mean that
prices of government bonds should drop and, correspondingly, interest
rates rise. But Japan often doesn't function like a normal market
economy. Despite the comparatively low credit ratings, its interest
rates are among the lowest in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, domestic investors have few attractive options about
where to invest: The stock market is one-third of its value 10 years
ago, real estate values have plunged, and investing overseas presents
substantial foreign-exchange risk.</TE>
<TE>   Hence, investors stick with government bonds. "The fact that the
economy offers such bad alternatives to government bonds only
indicates how broken the system is," said economist Feldman.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Japanese markets took the news of the expected
Moody's downgrade in stride and were little changed. Most economists
think the possibility of a Japanese default on a debt payment--which
is what the credit rating is supposed to grade--is minute.</CP>

<HD>Project Planned for Site by Valley</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Mixed-use development would include 5,800
affordable to luxury housing units.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plans for a large master-planned community in northern Los Angeles
County were unveiled Friday by a builder who hopes to provide housing
for 15,000 people in a transit-friendly setting.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed Las Lomas development in mostly hilly terrain north
of the interchange of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways
would include 5,800 housing units, 2.3 million square feet of office,
and research and development facilities, along with retail and
government buildings.</LD>
<LD>   Total development costs over the 20 years could reach $2billion,
said developer Dan Palmer, who heads Las Lomas Land Co., a venture
between his Palmer Investments Inc. of Santa Monica and Los Angeles
investment group Southbrook Equities.</LD>
<TE>   Palmer said he hopes the developers can join with transportation
agencies to build a station that would link an internal streetcar
system to Metrolink's Antelope Valley, as well as buses operated by
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Santa Clarita Transit.</TE>
<TE>   "The model for development evolving in many circles today is the
notion of smart growth that balances and integrates a mix of land
uses in a self-sustaining [environment] that reduces auto
dependency," Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   But the Las Lomas proposal has raised concern among some
environmentalists in the region, who fear increased traffic
congestion and the loss of wilderness space.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of us would be very discouraged" if the project is
eventually approved, said Lynne Plambeck, president of the Santa
Clarita Organization for Planning and the Environment. "People would
like to see that area kept open. You don't want to have a lot of
building in the mountains."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Homes Planned Than Ahmanson Ranch</TE>
<TE>   Las Lomas would include more units than the 3,050 homes planned
for the controversial and long-delayed Ahmanson Ranch development
just west of the San Fernando Valley in Ventura County. It would be
far smaller than another nearby proposed housing project, Newhall
Ranch, which would include 21,600 units.</TE>
<TE>   The property currently includes what Palmer described as a
hodgepodge of uses, including various utility lines, small industrial
operations and a Paintball USA park along the Old Road.</TE>
<TE>   The heart of the Las Lomas plan is a series of neighborhoods
carved out of the site's hillside terrain, connected through a system
of parks and trails.</TE>
<TE>   Residential options would run from affordable to luxury, and plans
for Las Lomas' commercial portions include mixed-use buildings with
street-level retail below both offices and residences.</TE>
<TE>   Plans also call for construction of a 300-room hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Portions of the site would be dedicated to such public uses as
facilities for emergency services, schools, a library and child-care
center.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly half the property would be maintained as open space, Palmer
said. Much of it would be restored to wilderness with a goal of
preserving a wildlife corridor between the Santa Susana and San
Gabriel mountain ranges.</TE>
<TE>   Critic Plambeck also raised concerns about possible seismic
activity in the area, which was rocked in 1971 by the Sylmar
earthquake and also sustained extensive damage during the 1994
Northridge temblor.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the area where the freeway collapsed," she said, referring
to the sweeping Interstate 5-California 14 junction that was heavily
damage in both quakes. "I would think everyone would have to look
very closely at the seismological issues there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Concerns Over Effect on Freeway Traffic</TE>
<TE>   Plambeck said she fears that the stretch of I-5 adjacent to the
development would turn into "a parking lot for three hours every
morning instead of the two hours we have now." That stretch of the
freeway already handles nearly 230,000 vehicles daily, on average,
according to Caltrans.</TE>
<TE>   The developers are working closely with the MTA on a plan for the
Las Lomas trolley line, Palmer said, which would be linked to the
community's planned transit center. Trolley stops would typically be
located no more than a five-minute walk from Las Lomas' residential
and commercial clusters.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at the site and thought it could offer great
opportunities for letting people move around their community without
driving," said Roger Snoble, the transportation agency's chief
executive. "This is not the kind of density that diminishes the
quality of life; it enhances it."</TE>
<TE>   The location, he said, is a logical hub to serve nearby residents
and provide commuting options for others.</TE>
<TE>   Construction wouldn't being until 2004 at the earliest, Palmer
said. The city of Los Angeles has begun annexation proceedings for
the property, which is just north of its borders, and Palmer's group
on Friday filed an application with the city inaugurating a formal
review of the proposed development.</TE>
<TE>   "The key advantages of being part of the city of Los Angeles are
the existence of a strong infrastructure system and guaranteed,
reliable supplies of water and power," said Palmer, who has developed
apartments and condominiums in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita
valleys. He is related to Geoff Palmer, a developer of luxury
apartment projects in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said the approval process is bound to be a challenge, as is
usually the case with large California developments.</TE>
<TE>   The property isn't home to endangered species, Palmer said, and
doesn't appear to be plagued with environmental contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   Las Lomas wouldn't significantly improve the state's housing
shortage. Analysts estimate that builders are producing 55,000 to
100,000 fewer units than what is needed to absorb annual growth in
California.</TE>

<HD>Macerich to Pay $662 Million for Phoenix Mall Operator</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shopping mall owner Macerich Co. said Friday that it had agreed to
acquire the largest mall operator in the fast-growing Phoenix area
for $662 million and the assumption of debt in a deal that would
transform the Santa Monica-based company into one of the nation's
largest owners of retail real estate.</LD>
<LD>   The acquisition of Phoenix-based Westcor Realty, which owns all or
part of nine regional malls, would significantly boost the size of
Macerich's portfolio and help the publicly owned real estate
investment trust remain independent as the mall industry
consolidates, real estate analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   After the deal is completed, Macerich would own all or part of 55
regional malls and 21 community centers with 57 million square feet
of space across the nation.</LD>
<TE>   In Southern California, Macerich's properties include Santa Monica
Place, Los Cerritos Shopping Center and Northridge Mall.</TE>
<TE>   "It is obviously a company-transforming transaction," said real
estate securities analyst David Shuman at Lehman Bros. "This puts
them in the big leagues."</TE>
<TE>   Macerich would pay $662million in cash, assume $733 million in
existing debt and issue about $80million worth of securities
convertible into preferred shares. Westcor is a privately held
company owned primarily by Boston-based investment advisor AEW
Capital Management on behalf of its institutional clients.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to expand, Macerich topped offers by much larger
rivals, including the nation's second-largest mall owner, General
Growth Properties Inc., according to Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Some Wall Street investors, however, were apparently concerned
that Macerich's winning bid was too aggressive and that it would take
on a daunting amount of debt, industry analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, Macerich shares fell 17 cents to
$28.55.</TE>
<TE>   Macerich President and Chief Executive Arthur Coppola dismissed
talk that the firm might have overpaid, saying all the bids were
close. He said Macerich already has received unsolicited bids for
individual Westcor properties that exceeded earlier estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Macerich said the deal would give it not only a highly productive
portfolio of malls but also the capability to expand in the lucrative
Phoenix area.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at Westcor's malls average about $407 a square foot, 15%
higher than Macerich's portfolio, and the company has the option
rights to develop an estimated 1,000 acres of retail properties.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a great deal of growth that we can realize from
Westcor's development pipeline and undeveloped land portfolio,"
Coppola said. "We view this transaction as a great opportunity to
expand our platform."</TE>
<TE>   He said Macerich plans to continue to expand through acquisitions
and redevelopment of mall properties.</TE>

<HD>Rally Fizzles on Concerns Over World Tensions</HD>
<DH>Markets: The Dow industrials pull back from a triple-digit
gain to finish 13 points higher. The dollar rebounds on economic
news.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pleased by encouraging economic reports but wary about world events
going into a weekend, investors backed away from a solid rally
Friday, leaving stocks mixed.</LD>
<LD>   An early triple-digit advance among blue-chip shares was the first
sign of life in the market after a weeklong decline caused by a
string of discouraging corporate news reports.</LD>
<LD>   But share prices retreated in the final two hours of trading, with
investors worried about the possibility of terror attacks and the
worsening tensions between nuclear powers India and Pakistan.</LD>
<TE>   Adding to fears, the U.S. government said it authorized the
departure of nonemergency staff from India.</TE>
<TE>   "It's end-of-the week jitters. There are enough things to worry
about in the world that could go wrong," said Arthur Hogan, chief
market analyst at Jefferies &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average inched up 13.56 points, or 0.1%,
at 9,925.25, having gained as much as 130 points earlier in the
session.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's advance broke the Dow's four-session, 304-point losing
streak but did little to save the blue chips from ending the week
down 1.8% and the month off 0.2%.</TE>
<TE>   The broader market was mixed Friday but ended the week negative.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index fell 16.19 points, or 1%, to 1,615.73
after climbing as much as 19.55 points earlier. Nasdaq lost 2.8% for
the week and 4.3% for the month.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 2.48 points, or 0.2%, to
1,067.14. The S&amp;P finished the week down 1.5% and the month off 0.9%.</TE>
<TE>   The Russell 2000 index, a barometer of the stocks of smaller
companies, slipped 0.36 point, or nearly 0.1%, to 487.47. For the
week, the Russell fell 1.3% as small-cap stocks, one of the few
bright spots in the market this year, began to lose a bit of their
luster. The index fell 4.5% in May.</TE>
<TE>   Still, winners led losers by about 5 to 3 on the New York Stock
Exchange on Friday, and winners and losers were about even on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The market was encouraged by a string of positive economic
news--healthy business activity in the Chicago area, a jump in U.S.
worker productivity and an uptick in consumer sentiment--but caution
crept back into trading as the session wore on.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is doing well, but the stock market is trying to
hammer out the bottom. It's not a new bull market yet. It's not off
to the races," said Scott Bleier, president of Hybridinvestors.com.</TE>
<TE>   Among Friday's gainers, Home Depot rose $1.54 to $41.69, Procter &amp;
Gamble climbed 80 cents to $89.55, and UPS advanced $1.38 to $60.38
after Bear Stearns raised its rating on the stock.</TE>
<TE>   But the tech sector pulled back, with Microsoft off $1.73 to
$50.91 and Oracle down 50 cents to $7.92.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's losers included companies that issued weaker-than-
expected outlooks or earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Retailer Lowe's stumbled 73 cents to $47.16 after projecting 2002
earnings below analysts' expectations. Palm fell 62 cents to $1.59
after announcing that revenue for its fourth quarter, which ended
Friday, will miss expectations and keep the maker of hand-held
computers from achieving profitability.</TE>
<TE>   In currency markets, the dollar got a bigger lift from the
economic data than did stocks: After sinking all week, the dollar
rose to 124.38 yen from 123.05 on Thursday. The euro fell to 93.1
cents from 93.8.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury bond yields inched up, and gold and oil rose modestly.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Drug company Bristol-Myers Squibb rose $1.27 to $31.12 and
Europe's top drug maker GlaxoSmithKline dropped $1.31 to $40.75 on
published reports that the industry heavyweights have held
preliminary discussions about the possibility of a merger.</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of department stores jumped on hopes that consumer
spending will drive the economic rebound. S&amp;P's department stores
index was the best-performing group in the S&amp;P 500, rising 3.1%.
Federated Department Stores rose $1.11 to $41.41, and Sears, Roebuck
added $1.81 to $59.05.</TE>
<TE>   * Restaurant chain Dave &amp; Buster's rallied $1.54, or more than
14%, to $12.13 after saying it agreed to be bought by a
management-led investment group for $155 million.</TE>

<HD>TV Networks Score Higher Ad Rates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anxious television executives on both coasts began loosening their
knotted stomachs late this week as it became clear that advertisers
were willing to pay higher rates than last year for commercial spots
on the networks' upcoming fall shows.</LD>
<LD>   For weeks, speculation had swirled over whether the economy had
improved enough for the networks to demand the kind of money they
reaped before the downturn. The answer started coming in Thursday:
With NBC leading the way, ad rates increased for some networks
between 9% and 15%.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a lot of money out there," said Jessica Reif Cohen, media
analyst for Merrill Lynch. "It's clear that the market is getting
healthier.... This is at the top end of what we were predicting."</LD>
<TE>   Network advertising sales are viewed as a barometer of the overall
health of the advertising and television industries.</TE>
<TE>   Movie studios and auto makers were among the first to scoop up
commercial time, with NBC making the first deals late Thursday. By
Friday, NBC had sold nearly half its advertising inventory and
advertisers began quickly grabbing slots on CBS, Fox Broadcasting,
ABC, UPN and the WB.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasters typically sell about three-quarters of their
commercial inventory in May and June for the season that begins in
September.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, sales were sluggish, falling more than 15% from the
heady dot-com days of 2000, when a record $8.1 billion in so-called
advanced ads were sold. Last year, with the slumping economy, the
amount totaled $6.9billion.</TE>
<TE>   This year, with the improved economy, Wall Street analysts had
projected that the combined ad revenue for the six major networks
would increase 3% to 6%. But this week's flurry of sales suggested
that the total could rise even more, topping $7.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Industry experts said the networks would benefit because
advertisers spent $750 million earlier this year for commercials
during the Winter Olympics on NBC. That amount will be freed up for
other programs and other networks.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, money is expected to flow from the intense
competition for consumers among pharmaceutical companies, fast-food
chains and the beverage industry.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, advertisers hedge their bets by spreading money
among the networks. But the biggest dollars go to the ones that
attract viewers ages 18 to 49 and viewers with sizable incomes who
are prized by advertisers trying to build brand loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the hottest network is General Electric Co. unit NBC,
which ended the 2001-2002 season with the most viewers and the
highest-rated programs. The company was garnering overall rate
increases of 7% to 9%, sources said. NBC executives were unavailable
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Business also was brisk at CBS, which finished the season ranked
No. 2 in viewers and in the key 18-to-49 demographic.</TE>
<TE>   The unit of Viacom Inc.--which sold $1.4 billion in advanced ads
last year, about two-thirds of the network's overall
inventory--secured rate increases of more than 10% in several deals,
sources said. CBS executives also were unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said advanced sales revenue for CBS' sister network, UPN,
could approach $250 million, up from $170 million last year. That
would be the biggest percentage increase among the networks.</TE>
<TE>   At Walt Disney Co.'s ABC, where prime-time ratings plummeted more
than 20% last season, one source said the network had sold nearly
half its commercial inventory for rates that had risen 4% to 6% from
last year. But industry sources predicted that the overall increase
could end up lower.</TE>
<TE>   Rates were expected to increase by about 5% at News Corp.'s Fox
Broadcasting, which has seen its ratings slip as its steady hits "The
X-Files" and "Ally McBeal" lost viewers in their final seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The sixth-ranked WB network, which has successfully lured young
viewers with its teen dramas, said Friday that it had sold about half
its advertising inventory, receiving rate increases of up to 15% over
last year, even though the overall haul is much smaller than those of
the dominant NBC and CBS.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Inc. owns three-quarters of the WB network, with
the remainder owned by Tribune Co., which also owns the Los Angeles
Times.</TE>

<HD>Studios' Spending in U.S. Drops, Study Says</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Larger-budget feature films are continuing to migrate to cheaper
locales such as Canada, in part because of aggressive tax breaks
producers have enjoyed there the last three years, a study by an
independent research group shows.</LD>
<LD>   The study by the Center for Entertainment Industry Data and
Research said the amount Hollywood spent on films shot in Canada with
budgets ranging from $10 million to $50 million increased 141% to
$750 million for films released in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   For the fourth straight year, the study said, overall spending by
Hollywood on films shot in the U.S. fell, while spending on films
shot in Canada increased. For films released last year, the study
estimated that production costs totaled $3.24 billion for U.S.-shot
movies, down from $3.93 billion in 1998. During the same period,
expenditures on Canadian-shot films rose 144% to $1.05billion.</LD>
<TE>   The study said the numbers may have been skewed by strike fears
last year that caused studios to increase production, then scale back
after they stockpiled movies.</TE>
<TE>   The study is expected to be presented today during a panel
discussion at the annual Showbiz Expo trade show in Los Angeles,
focusing on growth in runaway production since Canada enacted new
production tax breaks in June 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood labor unions are making a major push to try to stem the
flow of production from the U.S. This week, the California Assembly
passed legislation to give smaller productions a 15% credit against
the state wage tax.</TE>
<TE>   Experts have long complained about the dearth of data on runaway
production, in part because Hollywood studios closely guard budget
numbers. Stephen Katz, executive director of the research center,
said the spending totals are compiled from sources he has in the
industry, along with published estimates.</TE>

<LD>Sulzer Medica Ltd. agreed to settle a class-action suit over faulty
artificial hips and knees instead of filing for bankruptcy, after
convincing all but 87 plaintiffs to accept the accord.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement will cost Sulzer Medica $725 million, while former
owner Sulzer and insurers will pay an additional $275 million.</LD>
<LD>   Medica's Sulzer Orthopedics unit, based in Austin, Texas, began
recalling hip implants in December 2000, saying they might loosen. Of
the 31,000 patients who received the implants, more than 2,760 had
them replaced.</LD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two major airlines followed Continental Airlines Inc. in raising
leisure fares, but some analysts said an effort to hike prices
industrywide will probably fail.</LD>
<LD>   AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and Delta Air Lines Inc. said they
increased most leisure fares to match Continental's $20 per
round-trip hike. But Northwest Airlines Corp., UAL Corp.'s United
Airlines and US Airways Group matched only some increases.</LD>
<LD>   Northwest has held out against previous systemwide fare increases,
forcing competitors to roll theirs back or face a pricing
disadvantage.</LD>
<TE>   The fare-increase attempt, the third since mid-April, was "dead on
arrival," given Northwest's action to match the increase on a very
limited number of markets, said J.P. Morgan Chase analyst Jamie
Baker.</TE>
<TE>   But Terry Trippler, an airfare expert at Trippler &amp; Associates,
disagreed. "My gut feeling is that Northwest and United will collapse
and go along with [the increase] this weekend," Trippler said.</TE>
<TE>   Major U.S. carriers have tried unsuccessfully several times to
increase fares industrywide since the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>

<LD>Sprint Corp. in July will raise the fee it charges customers to help

<LD>   Sprint, beginning July 8, will assess an 11.3% charge on sales
generated by its customers each month, up from 9.9%, to cover
obligations to a $5.7-billion annual fund that helps poor and rural
customers afford basic phone service. AT&amp;T may boost its charge to
12.4% from 11.5%, it said in a filing with regulators.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, AT&amp;T said it plans to raise about $2.25 billion next
week through a share sale and may use the proceeds to buy the 69% of
AT&amp;T Canada Inc. it doesn't already own.</LD>

<HD>Fox, Turner Team Up to Reel In 'Spider-Man'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA ELLER and BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After an intense bidding war by major TV broadcasters, Fox Network
and Turner Broadcasting joined forces and captured the television
rights to the blockbuster movie "Spider-Man" for an estimated $60
million, officials from Sony Pictures Entertainment confirmed Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, concluded late in the day by Sony's Columbia TriStar
Domestic Television division, is among one of the most expensive
acquisitions of a feature film, along with such titles as "Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," "Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom
Menace" and "The Lost World: Jurassic Park."</LD>
<LD>   Given "Spider-Man's" huge box-office take--close to $350million so
far--industry insiders may have expected the price to be even higher,
but it's unclear exactly how the deal was structured.</LD>
<TE>   Fox and Turner will have the right to televise the film over a
10-year period with an unspecified number of runs split between Fox's
broadcast network and Turner's various cable networks, which include
TNT and TBS. The film won't become available for its first airing
until November 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Even with all the competition and high acquisition prices,
networks still see the value of movie properties as a ratings draw.
Fox is coming off a disappointing season during which it canceled two
of its longest-running shows, "The X-Files" and "Ally McBeal." Fox
earlier had paid $80 million a piece for "The Lost World" and
"Episode I."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Turner Broadcasting, owned by AOL Time Warner Inc., in
recent years has been aggressively snapping up rights to big movies
to feed its cable networks. Among them are "Lord of the Rings" and
"The Matrix," both made by Turner's sister movie studios New Line and
Warner Bros. Turner also has acquired rights to Paramount's "Mission
Impossible 2" and Universal's "The Mummy."</TE>
<TE>   In November, Warner Bros. sold the TV rights to "Harry Potter" and
its first sequel, "The Chamber of Secrets" to Walt Disney Co.'s ABC
in a deal estimated at $140 million. Earlier, ABC acquired TV rights
to Universal Pictures/Imagine Films' "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"
for a reported $60 million.</TE>

<HD>In Adelphia Saga, One Mogul Fights to Succeed Another</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two cable moguls have lost fortunes built over a lifetime in the
recent stock meltdown at Adelphia Communications Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The first is John Rigas, the 77-year-old founder of the nation's
sixth-largest cable operator, who relinquished control of Adelphia
last week because of his family's role in a major accounting scandal.</LD>
<LD>   The other is Rigas' friend of 40 years and fellow cable pioneer,
Leonard Tow. In 1999, Tow sold his company Century Communications
Corp., including its prized Los Angeles cable operations, to Adelphia
for $5.2 billion. Tow wound up with a 12% stake in Adelphia, becoming
the second-biggest shareholder after the Rigas family.</LD>
<TE>   Worth about $1.7 billion two years ago, Tow's Adelphia holdings
have evaporated to $23 million in the last three months.</TE>
<TE>   Now with Adelphia teetering on the brink of bankruptcy and with
Tow attending his first board meeting today, the 74-year-old cable
executive is hoping to wrest control of the company from a group of
directors in charge since Rigas and his three sons stepped down last
week.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire group of major [Adelphia] shareholders believes the
company needs Leonard Tow as CEO," said Gordon Crawford, senior vice
president at Capital Research &amp; Management, a money management firm
that owns 4.8% of Adelphia. "The company needs an experienced cable
operator to get it through the next stage."</TE>
<TE>   Tow is locked in a power struggle with Adelphia's interim chief
executive, Erland Kailbourne. Kailbourne, a boyhood friend of Rigas
and an independent Adelphia board member, was put into power two
weeks ago by the Rigases shortly before they relinquished control of
the company.</TE>
<TE>   The Rigases, a clannish family operating out of Coudersport, a
Mayberry-like town in western Pennsylvania, face mounting shareholder
lawsuits and federal and state probes into $3.1 billion in personal
loans backed by Adelphia, supposedly without shareholder or board
knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   Kailbourne and Tow seem to disagree about the best way to save the
company. Adelphia has been negotiating around the clock to complete a
deal with billionaire Paul Allen, who would lend the company $2
billion in exchange for some prime Los Angeles cable systems.</TE>
<TE>   Allen, who controls the nation's fourth-largest cable company,
Charter Communications Corp., has coveted the Los Angeles properties
since he lost a bidding war for them three years ago against
Adelphia. Tow turned down an all-cash offer from Allen and put
Century up for auction, preferring a tax-free stock trade, like the
one he got from Adelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Talks between Allen and Adelphia hit a snag Thursday night but
were not dead, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Tow is trying to prevent a hasty sale of cable assets, preferring
to rebuild the business and to work out new payment plans with its
lenders. In a letter Thursday to Kailbourne, Tow urged him not to
sell the "most valuable [cable] assets in an atmosphere of
desperation."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Boston investment group Highfields Capital Management
urged Kailbourne to put the entire company up for sale, rather than
pursue a piecemeal strategy of selling Adelphia's assets at
distressed prices. In a letter filed with regulators, two principals
of Highfields, with 6.5% of Adelphia, complained about a lack of
leadership at the company and accused directors of trying to shield
themselves from "liabilities created by the former controlling
shareholders."</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's independent directors have maintained that they were in
the dark about many of the Rigases' questionable activities.</TE>
<TE>   In a regulatory filing last week, the board said the family had
failed to seek board approval for many of their insider dealings,
including a $150-million loan from the company to finance their
professional hockey team, the Buffalo Sabres.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Tow won two of the three seats on Adelphia's board
he said he was entitled to under the 1999 sale agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "He always had the right but didn't exercise it because he didn't
want to get in the way," said Bern Gallagher, former chief executive
of Century Communications. "He didn't think it was necessary because
he had an excellent relationship with the Rigases."</TE>
<TE>   Tow would not be interviewed. But Gallagher said he and his former
boss were shocked by the Rigases' financial dealings.</TE>
<TE>   If Tow took over Adelphia, Gallagher said, he would replace the
four independent board members. "They need a new slate of directors
who are not encumbered by their relationship with the [Rigas]
family," Gallagher said. "This happened under their watch."</TE>
<TE>   Tow, however, doesn't have enough votes to push through changes.
He controls only two of the six Adelphia board seats.</TE>
<TE>   He also may be too late to keep Adelphia out of Bankruptcy Court.
A liquidity squeeze has forced the company to default on several
loans. Nasdaq will delist Adelphia on Monday for failing to meet
several deadlines for filing its 2001 annual report, making Adelphia
liable for the immediate payment of $1.4billion to bondholders.</TE>
<TE>   Tow also was a target of shareholder suits years ago for his
expensive compensation package at Citizens Communications Co., a
telecommunications and power utility he controls. And as a cable
operator, Tow had a reputation for charging some of the highest rates
in the industry and for spotty customer service in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if Tow gives me hope" for Adelphia, said Oren Cohen,
a bond analyst at Merrill Lynch. "I'd question whether he's the right
guy."</TE>

<LD>Skyworks Solutions Inc., the new name for the soon-to-be merged
wireless business of Newport Beach-based Conexant Systems and Alpha
Industries, could be a problem for another company.</LD>
<LD>   Skyworks Technologies Inc., a developer of Web promotional games,
is talking with its lawyers about action it might be able to take,
said Garry Kitchen, chief executive of the New Jersey firm.</LD>
<LD>   Alpha's chief executive, David J. Aldrich, who will take the same
post at Skyworks Solutions, said he didn't need to clear the new name
with Skyworks Technologies because "it's just not a company that a
reasonable person would confuse with our company."</LD>
<TE>   According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Web site, the
Skyworks trademark was registered in 1998 to Skyworks Technologies
for use in computer games. On May 22, the day after Alpha, based in
Woburn, Mass., announced the new name, Skyworks Technologies filed an
application to use the trademark for games in mobile phones and other
portable devices.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>COPENHAGEN</DL>
<LD>After a long and heated debate, Denmark's parliament passed a
controversial plan Friday to limit immigration.</LD>
<LD>   The center-right government's bill, making it more difficult to
obtain asylum and cutting welfare for immigrants, was passed with
votes from the vehemently anti-immigrant Danish People's Party.</LD>
<LD>   The party became the third-largest in parliament in November
elections after an anti-immigrant campaign.</LD>
<TE>   The law, which Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen says could be
a model for Europe, was passed just days after France and Germany
made a joint appeal to tighten European immigration in an effort to
prevent Europe's far right from exploiting the issue at the ballot
box.</TE>

<HD>In Ratifying Climate Pact, EU Asks U.S. to Reconsider</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>All 15 European Union nations ratified the Kyoto pact against global
warming Friday and goaded Washington--which has turned its back on
the treaty--to also do its part.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called Kyoto Protocol, which grew out of the 1992 Earth
Summit in Rio de Janeiro, is aimed at cutting the emission of
"greenhouse gases" blamed for rising global temperatures.</LD>
<LD>   Signed in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, the protocol requires
industrialized countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by
an average of 5% over the 2008-12 period.</LD>
<TE>   But the United States, the world's largest polluter, shunned the
treaty shortly after President Bush took office last year, arguing
that it would harm the nation's economy.</TE>
<TE>   The pact would have required Washington to cut emissions by 7%
from 1990 levels, but the Bush administration has instead announced
policy changes likely to push up its emissions by 30% by 2010, the
European Commission said.</TE>
<TE>   At a ceremony at U.N. headquarters in New York, representatives of
all 15 EU member states and the European Commission handed papers
from their respective nations to U.N. chief legal counsel Hans
Corell, signifying that their national legislatures had approved the
pact.</TE>
<TE>   Margot Wallstrom, EU commissioner for the environment, called the
signing "an historic moment for global efforts to combat climate
change," but she stressed the need for Washington to pitch in.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States is the only nation to have spoken out against
and rejected the global framework for addressing climate change. The
European Union urges the United States to reconsider its position,"
she said. "All countries have to act, but the industrialized world
has to take the lead."</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony came as ministers representing the United Nations'
189 member nations gathered on the Indonesian island of Bali to
complete preparations for a follow-up to the Earth Summit in
Johannesburg, South Africa, this August.</TE>

<HD>State Targets Co-Worker of 'Angel of Death'</HD>
<DH>Discipline: Board seeks to suspend respiratory therapist's
license, citing admission that she 'aided and abetted' convicted
killer Efren Saldivar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state Respiratory Care Board began legal proceedings Friday to
suspend the license of the graveyard shift respiratory therapist who
often worked beside convicted "Angel of Death" killer Efren Saldivar.</LD>
<LD>   The board petitioned an administrative law judge in Los Angeles to
take the disciplinary action against Ursula Anderson, 34, who
admitted during questioning by authorities that she obtained a
potentially lethal muscle relaxer for Saldivar and never reported her
suspicions that he was killing patients at Glendale Adventist Medical
Center.</LD>
<LD>   A hearing was scheduled Thursday on the state's petition to
suspend Anderson's license "while a formal accusation of
unprofessional conduct is finalized," the respiratory board said.
Allowing Anderson to continue treating patients could "endanger the
public health," the board said in its filing.</LD>
<TE>   Stephanie Nunez, the respiratory board's executive officer, said
that additional accusations will probably be filed soon against three
other respiratory therapists who worked with Saldivar, but that the
state was not seeking immediate suspension of their licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar, 32, pleaded guilty to six murder counts in March, four
years after he shocked Glendale police by confessing that he had
killed up to 50 patients with intravenous injections of paralyzing
drugs. Saldivar soon after recanted that statement, only to give a
second confession following his arrest last year, saying then that he
may have killed more than 100 patients. He was sentenced to life in
prison without parole on April 17.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson and three other respiratory therapists were fired by
Glendale Adventist in the wake of Saldivar's original admissions in
1998, and Saldivar's own state license was revoked.</TE>
<TE>   In the years since, Glendale Adventist officials expressed
frustration that no state disciplinary action was taken against any
of the four fired respiratory therapists. State officials said they
did not want to interfere with Saldivar's criminal case and thus
waited for it to conclude before pursuing disciplinary cases against
Anderson and other therapists who may have failed to report evidence
that Saldivar was killing patients.</TE>
<TE>   The board said Friday that Anderson currently works at Queen of
Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. But board official
Nunez suggested that Anderson has been suspended by that hospital,
saying, "we have every reason to believe" that she will not be caring
for patients pending resolution of the disciplinary case.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Queen of Angels said the hospital was prohibited
from commenting on personnel matters.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson was given immunity from prosecution in the criminal case,
but the board's filing Friday said that did not prevent it from using
her own words against her in civil disciplinary proceedings. In
seeking suspension of her license, the board cited her admissions
that she "aided and abetted Efren Saldivar" and accused her of
negligence, incompetence and other offenses that could eventually
lead to revocation of her license.</TE>
<TE>   Among the board's allegations:</TE>
<TE>   * "On one occasion [she] gave Saldivar succinylcholine, which she
found in a surgical intensive care unit ... sitting on a window
sill.... [She] gave it to him because she knew that he was killing
patients with injections of succinylcholine."</TE>
<TE>   * "Respondent Anderson ... did see Saldivar inject something into
a patient's IV ... [and] saw Saldivar attempting to inject another
patient."</TE>
<TE>   * "On one occasion, [she] saw glass vials containing medication in
Saldivar's locker. None of the vials contained medication used by
respiratory care practitioners."</TE>
<TE>   * Saldivar told [her] about his criteria for killing....[She] knew
what Saldivar was doing."</TE>
<TE>   * "Respondent Anderson was unable to explain why she had not
reported what Saldivar was doing except to admit that she had been
sexually involved with him for five months."</TE>
<TE>   The state filing also quoted Anderson as saying of Saldivar, "I
didn't tell him to go do this, go do that. He's a grown man. He does
things on his own."</TE>
<TE>   Both Anderson and Saldivar admitted having an affair while working
the overnight shift together about two nights a week.</TE>
<TE>   Though Saldivar told police he sometimes injected patients with
succinylcholine chloride--a paralyzing drug respiratory therapists
are not authorized to administer--he said he usually used another
drug, Pavulon, to kill patients. He used Pavulon to kill the six
patients whose deaths were cited in the murder charges, authorities
said.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Council Set to Vote on Growth Plan</HD>
<DH>Land use: Annexation proposal would add 12,350 homes and 7
million square feet of business and research space near El Toro.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine officials will vote Tuesday on a development plan that would
increase the size of the master-planned community by a third and
serve as a blueprint for its growth over the next 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed 3,600-acre development north of the city would
include 12,350 homes and 7 million square feet of commercial and
research facilities. An additional 4,100 acres would be set aside as
open land, connecting the development with protected foothills to the
north and Irvine's proposed Great Park at the closed El Toro Marine
base.</LD>
<LD>   The city's Planning Commission on Thursday gave its unanimous
approval to the general plan--the first step toward a long-awaited
annexation of the area.</LD>
<TE>   If the council signs off, development on the first phase could
begin within a year.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine officials want control over what's built in order to make
it compatible with the city's village theme. Irvine's residential
areas are all within walking distance of neighborhood schools, parks
and shopping centers. Officials see the so-called Northern Sphere as
the final piece of the puzzle, completing a community that has served
as a model for planned growth in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   But some residents are concerned about how the development will
affect traffic. The homes are expected to add 30,000 residents to the
town of 143,000. And, residents fear, adding several million square
feet of business will turn the Santa Ana Freeway into a parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "If you were to put just the 12,350 homes throughout that land,
there probably wouldn't be any concern," north Irvine resident Dave
Melvold said. "It's the combination of the homes and the 7 million
square feet of businesses that's overwhelming.... And we still
haven't figured out what the new development at El Toro is going to
do to us."</TE>
<TE>   In March, voters shot down the county's plans to build an
international airport at the closed Marine base, choosing instead
Irvine's plan for a Great Park, which advocates say will rival New
York's Central Park or Balboa Park in San Diego. The city is now
negotiating to buy the base from the Department of the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Greg Smith doesn't think the city should wait for a
fleshed-out plan at El Toro to decide on the Northern Sphere, but he
wants to know how the two will interface. He wants to make sure there
are no surprises in the plan. And he's not sure one evening is enough
to figure that out.</TE>
<TE>   "If there are still unanswered questions Tuesday, waiting a week
for the answers pales in comparison to having to live with a lifetime
of flaws that might be in the paperwork," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But officials said approval of the general plan isn't a blanket
approval for the whole development. The area will be built in phases
over the next 20 to 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be looking at it very closely every step of the way, and
there will be a traffic analysis done each time a tract map comes to
the Planning Commission for approval," said Anthony Dragun, who
chairs the commission. "We'll make sure each project meets our level
of standards."</TE>
<TE>   Also, Sand Canyon Road, Portola Parkway and the Foothill
Transportation Corridor, which cut through the area, are underused
and could handle overflow from the freeway, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials began working with the Irvine Co. on the blueprint two
years ago and formed a community task force that met more than 30
times.</TE>
<TE>   With all that, Mayor Larry Agran said he's ready to vote on the
matter Tuesday. And he's happy with what he's seen so far,
particularly with the amount of open space.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be able to say with absolute confidence that there will be
no city in Orange County, and few cities in the Western United
States, with as much natural open space woven into the fabric of the
community," Agran said. "And with the approval of the Great Park,
it's all right there in front of our eyes. We just have to grab it
and make it happen."</TE>

<HD>Empty Boat a Ruse to Cover Flight, Deputies Say</HD>
<DH>Crime: Lifeguards found craft off El Segundo and feared
foul play. Orange County authorities say the owner faces sexual
assault charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When authorities found Daniel Farinholt's empty boat anchored a
quarter-mile off El Segundo over the Memorial Day weekend, they
initially believed he had fallen overboard or killed himself.</LD>
<LD>   Then lifeguards learned that Farinholt was wanted in Orange County
on charges that he sexually assaulted three children and that he had
missed a court appearance a day earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives believe he tried to make his disappearance look like
suicide and is on the run. They found blood on the boat but believe
it was part of the ruse.</LD>
<TE>   "The amount was so small it would not cause a fatality," said Jim
Amormino, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   "It was probably put there as a decoy to throw us off, but we
believe he is alive and well."</TE>
<TE>   Divers spent two days searching the ocean bottom near his boat but
found no sign of Farinholt.</TE>
<TE>   His BMW was near his Manhattan Beach home, but it yielded few
clues.</TE>
<TE>   Farinholt, 42, was charged in March with four counts of sexual
assault.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege in court records that Farinholt committed lewd
acts against two girls and a boy who were living in the same Lake
Forest house between 1997 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Farinholt was released from jail after posting $200,000 bail,
agreeing to surrender his passport and have no contact with his
alleged victims. He faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Farinholt recently moved from Lake Forest to Manhattan Beach,
close to his job as an executive at an El Segundo information
consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   He failed to appear at the South Justice Center in Laguna Niguel
on May 23 for a pretrial hearing. A day later, lifeguards patrolling
the El Segundo coast by boat came across Farinholt's 24-foot cabin
cruiser, the Reel'n and Rock'n, anchored just off the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Lifeguards thought the owner fell overboard or killed himself.
When they noticed the blood, they also considered the possibility of
foul play.</TE>
<TE>   Television cameras converged on the beach as divers searched. The
Orange County Sheriff's Department heard about the case and made the
connection.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a weak attempt to convince people he died, but we know
he's alive and well," said Amormino, adding that Farinholt might be
hiding at friends' homes.</TE>
<TE>   Farinholt is described as white, 5 feet, 10 inches, 160 pounds
with brown hair and blue eyes.</TE>

<LD>A 25-year-old woman was in critical condition at UCLA Medical Center
on Friday after being struck by a car in a crosswalk at Los Angeles
International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   The woman, an employee at Rubio's restaurant in Terminal No. 6,
waited for the walk signal at a crosswalk in front of that terminal
and stepped off the curb, officials said. She was struck by a car
when she reached the second lane of traffic, said Paul Haney, an
airport spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   The accident occurred about 9:10 a.m. Airport police shut down
five lanes of traffic on the airport's lower-level circle for about
an hour after the accident.</LD>

hospitals and weathered a nurses strike at another.</LD>
<LD>   Officials hope to increase the percentage of Latino health-care
professionals, which recent studies show is less than 4% in
California.</LD>
<TE>   The grant will cover tuition and living expenses for students
through the East Los Angeles Community Union Education Foundation,
established nearly 20 years ago to boost Latinos' college graduation
rates.</TE>

<HD>Deficit Forces O.C. to Tap Reserves</HD>
<DH>Budget: $57-million shortfall is tied to state's woes. Drop
in sales-tax revenue creates more problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time since the county's historic bankruptcy in 1994,
Orange County will tap into its reserves to offset an anticipated
$57-million budget shortfall, county finance officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The unusual action was prompted by new budget figures the
governor's office issued in May, said Gary Burton, the county's chief
financial officer, who unveiled the county's $4.3-billion budget--up
4% from last year--for the fiscal year that starts July 1.</LD>
<LD>   Use of the county's reserves is necessary "to maintain operations
and balance the budget," Burton said.</LD>
<TE>   The shortfall is the result of the stagnant economy and the
state's $23.6-billion deficit, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The sluggish economy has also lowered sales tax revenue, causing a
$10-million funding drop for public protection agencies, including
the district attorney's office and Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the county has had to deal with increased retirement
and health insurance rates for former employees, Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   The county plans to use $17.3 million from its $126-million
"strategic priorities reserve," which funds the Board of Supervisors'
priority programs: affordable housing, ocean water quality and such
capital improvement programs as the Theo Lacy Branch Jail expansion.</TE>
<TE>   The county will not touch a separate $23-million emergency reserve
for such catastrophic events as earthquakes, Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining the reserves was part of the post-bankruptcy financial
planning that allowed the county to prioritize programs and provide
funding for them.</TE>
<TE>   When shortfalls occur, the process allows the board to shift its
priorities and funding levels.</TE>
<TE>   Burton and a half-dozen department heads said the county is in for
serious belt-tightening, and pinpointed potential cuts in programs
and services if the state's budget picture doesn't brighten soon.</TE>
<TE>   Details of the budget are still being worked out, but some of the
hardest-hit programs are expected to include drug rehabilitation,
family resource centers, foster care, adoptions, summer youth jobs
and mental health services to the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, County Executive Officer Michael Schumacher ordered a
hiring freeze in anticipation of the proposed cuts in services and
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Only those vacancies identified as "critically important" will be
filled, a county spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   The county also has stepped up lobbying efforts with such
Sacramento legislators as Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver
City), said Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad.</TE>
<TE>   Given its own shortfall, the state is backing away from funding
programs it mandated, which has left Orange and other counties having
to provide services with a reduced level of funding, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The county was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1994 after it lost
$1.6 billion on risky investments.</TE>
<TE>   Officials pledged to repay more than $900 million in recovery
bonds and bankruptcy debts over 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   Debt Repayment Since '98 Totals $363 Million</TE>
<TE>   The board created a debt repayment fund in 1997 that has since
paid down $363 million in bankruptcy and other debts since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The state shortfall and use of the county's reserves will not
affect the repayment schedule, said county spokeswoman Diane Thomas.
County finance officials will present the proposed budget at a
workshop Thursday at 3 p.m. in the county Hall of Administration, 10
Civic Center Plaza, Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   The budget will be presented to the Board of Supervisors on June
11.</TE>

<HD>Condors Get a Visit From Stork</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Biologists believe a third chick has hatched in
Los Padres forest, which bodes well for bird recovery efforts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A third condor chick is believed to have hatched this week in Ventura
County's back country, further demonstrating to biologists that their
recovery efforts for the endangered birds are working.</LD>
<LD>   The egg had been monitored by biologists with the California
Condor Recovery Plan for the last eight weeks and was hatched Tuesday
near the Sespe Condor Sanctuary of the Los Padres National Forest,
north of Fillmore.</LD>
<LD>   The nest where the chick is being reared is inside a deep cave and
is covered by bushes, so biologists have not yet seen the tiny
condor. But the parents' behavior indicates the chick is doing fine,
said Greg Austin, a U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service biologist.</LD>
<TE>   The chick's parents, which are both 8 years old, were reared in
captivity at the Los Angeles Zoo and were released into the wild in
1995.</TE>
<TE>   The birth of a third condor chick encourages biologists, because
it indicates that even condors raised in captivity know how to breed
in the wild, Austin said. The chick is expected to be the last one
hatched locally this year.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't have any parents themselves, but they know what to
do," said Austin. "Their instinct and genetics are so hard-wired that
they've done everything right," from courting to laying eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists with the recovery effort want to establish two separate
populations of condors--one in California and one in Arizona, each
with 150 birds and at least 15 breeding pairs.</TE>

<HD>Mexican Consul, Advocate of New ID Cards, Leaving</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Miguel Angel Isidro got police to accept the
documents, reducing deportations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mexican consul in Orange County, who promoted the acceptance of
Mexican identification cards by local police agencies, is leaving his
post.</LD>
<LD>   After three years in the job at the Santa Ana consulate, Miguel
Angel Isidro will leave in August for Quezaltenango, Guatemala. The
transfer is routine, Mexican officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Isidro is credited with improving relations between Mexican
immigrants and police, who frequently turned immigrants taken into
custody over to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. In
some cases, people were deported after minor traffic offenses because
they could not show proof of identity.</LD>
<TE>   Isidro was one of the Mexican consuls in the United States to help
win acceptance of the identification card known as the matricula
consular.</TE>
<TE>   Immigrants who can show the card can avoid having their cases
referred to INS officers stationed in some jails. Matriculas are now
accepted as identification in several U.S. cities and some banks.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just happy that we were able to help and develop a
relationship with the departments," said Isidro, who lived in Orange
after serving as consul in Phoenix and Hungary. "I think we also
improved our service to the public."</TE>
<TE>   With increased demand for matriculas, the consulate is now
providing them for thousands of immigrants each month at walk-up
windows in the Santa Ana office, consular officials said.</TE>
<TE>   For his next assignment, Isidro will live in the colonial city of
about 100,000 residents, many of them Quiche Indians, in Guatemala's
western highlands. Although few Mexicans live there, Isidro will
still deal with questions of immigration.</TE>
<TE>   Explained an official of Mexico's Foreign Ministry: "Guatemala is
an important place for Mexico. Now instead of dealing with migrants
leaving Mexico, he will be dealing with Guatemalans trying to enter
Mexico."</TE>

<HD>Cooley Targets Church Records</HD>
<DH>Litigation: Grand jury may be used to obtain personnel
files of priests accused of sex abuse. Clerics' attorney says
documents are private.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County district attorney's office is preparing to use
a grand jury to force the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles
to turn over documents about priests accused of sexually abusing
minors, law enforcement officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley put the wheels in motion to use grand
jury subpoenas to obtain the personnel files after an attorney
representing several priests raised objections to the archdiocese
releasing the documents.</LD>
<LD>   Cooley had threatened Cardinal Roger M. Mahony with a grand jury
investigation two weeks ago unless he promptly gave law enforcement
agencies all documents related to the priests under criminal
investigation for alleged abuse. The threat came after Cooley's
unsuccessful requests to Mahony.</LD>
<TE>   Donald Steier, the lawyer who represents most of the current and
former priests under investigation, told prosecutors he objected to
the files' release because the documents are protected by federal and
state privacy laws.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are seeking the files of Michael Stephen Baker,
David Granadino, Stephen Hernandez and Tilak Jayawardene, all priests
in the three-county Los Angeles archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately ... the priests have an interest in their personnel
files remaining confidential just like police," Steier said. "I don't
see [individual officers] turning over their personnel files too
readily after a shooting."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Steier said he would not object to a grand jury
request for documents or any other avenue that would allow him to
appeal to a judge. In a 1995 molestation case involving Long Beach
priest Ted Llanos, Steier succeeded in having a subpoena for
documents quashed.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel our position is not simply an academic exercise," Steier
said. "I think the district attorney will come up with an alternate
approach."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to William Hodgman, the head deputy district attorney
in charge of the sex crimes unit, Steier suggested several means by
which prosecutors and police could gain access to the documents. All
would require review by a judge or arbitrator.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Hodgman said he suspended Friday's deadline for
the archdiocese to turn over documents because of the legal
objections made by Steier.</TE>
<TE>   "We were compelled to temporarily stop the process," Hodgman said.
"We will initiate litigation very soon to resolve these issues."</TE>
<TE>   Hodgman did not discuss the use of a grand jury to compel the
release of the documents. But law enforcement sources said
prosecutors had begun preparing to ask a grand jury to demand the
records.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Hennigan, a Los Angeles attorney representing the
archdiocese in the priest cases, said the archdiocese is and has been
"ready, willing and able" to turn over documents. But he believes a
judge should oversee the process.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nobody in the district attorney's office or the police
department that doesn't recognize that these are hot potatoes,"
Hennigan said. "There are protocols in place to determine whether
investigators can look at personnel files."</TE>
<TE>   Hennigan said he believed that the district attorney's office
would decide how the documents should be released. He said they had
discussed two methods. In one, the archdiocese would give law
enforcement sealed envelopes containing those records with an
agreement that they would not be opened until a judge granted
permission. In another process, he said, a judicial officer would
review the documents and turn over those that were deemed
appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll go along with anything," Hennigan said. "But we are not
legally permitted to simply let people have these documents."</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office said it made it clear to the
archdiocese that records should be turned over to the appropriate law
enforcement agencies without delay.</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, the district attorney's spokeswoman, said
prosecutors have several options to ensure the records are released.
Prosecutors could use subpoenas issued by a grand jury, serve several
search warrants or take the matter to a court to resolve, she said.
Prosecutors had expected that Steier might step into the fray to
prevent the records from being handed over, Gibbons said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say that in cases where lawyers raise objections to
the release of records, it is common to use a grand jury. Given the
archdiocese's objections, employing the power of a grand jury may be
far easier than trying to determine what records exist and in which
archdiocese office they are located.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not seen a shred of paper at any local law enforcement
agency despite all the promise," said Joseph Scott, Cooley's director
of communications.</TE>
<TE>   The priests whose records are being sought by the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department, Los Angeles Police Department and
Glendale Police Department are:</TE>
<TE>   * Baker, a retired priest, who told Mahony in 1986 that he
molested young boys but was reassigned to parishes and allegedly
continued his abuse of minors for more than a decade before the
cardinal arranged for him to retire.</TE>
<TE>   * Granadino, a priest at St. Francis of Rome church who is the
subject of a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department probe into
accusations that he molested boys in Norwalk and Azusa.</TE>
<TE>   * Hernandez, an El Sereno priest who is accused of molesting a
15-year-old boy. After he learned of a Los Angeles police
investigation, he deliberately cut his wrist and took an overdose of
pills.</TE>
<TE>   * Jayawardene, a priest charged in 1991 with molesting a Glendale
boy; Jayawardene subsequently fled to Sri Lanka. Glendale police
recently asked prosecutors to extradite him.</TE>
<TE>   Prodded by victims, prosecutors and headlines earlier this year,
Mahony began to turn over the names of priests accused of molestation
after it was revealed that he forced at least eight clerics to leave
the ministry because of prior allegations.</TE>
<TE>   As the priest abuse scandal has grown nationwide, dozens of new
allegations have been made against current and former clerics. Law
enforcement sources say that across the archdiocese--which includes
Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties--more than 30 priests
are the subject of police investigations.</TE>

<HD>4 Accused of Medicare Fraud</HD>
<DH>Arrests: Ambulance company owners are named in a 26-count
indictment saying they cheated the federal program of $2 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The owners of a Los Angeles ambulance service and an employee were
arrested Friday on charges of bilking the federal Medicare program
out of more than $2 million.</LD>
<LD>   Gregory Plotkin, 48, and Boris Shpirt, 49, both of Beverly Hills,
were taken into custody at the offices of Greybor Medical
Transportation Inc., along with Daniel Gonzalez, 29, of Pico Rivera,
a company supervisor.</LD>
<LD>   A fourth suspect, Robert White, 46, of Van Nuys and Mission Hills,
was being sought.</LD>
<TE>   A 26-count indictment accuses the four men of falsifying claims to
Medicare from 1998 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   One ruse allegedly employed by Greybor was to claim that a patient
was "bed-confined" when transported in an ambulance, a requirement
for reimbursement under Medicare regulations. In fact, the indictment
charged, many of those patients rode in the front seat.</TE>
<TE>   At other times, the indictment said, a Greybor ambulance would
ferry several people simultaneously, but the company submitted claims
indicating that they were transported separately.</TE>
<TE>   The four suspects were also accused of falsely claiming that some
patients were driven to receive dialysis treatments, which is
reimbursable by Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   When Medicare launched an audit of Greybor's claims two years ago,
Plotkin submitted altered medical records to cover up the fraud, the
indictment said.</TE>
<TE>   Greybor, located at 119 N. Belmont Ave., Echo Park, operates a
fleet of 14 ambulances.</TE>
<TE>   Plotkin and Shpirt also operated two medical equipment companies,
Pride Medical Industries and GABA Medical Industries.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment accused Shpirt and White of providing
Spanish-speaking Medicare beneficiaries with equipment they did not
need or want.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said employees at Pride and GABA would persuade
elderly Spanish speakers to sign English-language documents that
turned out to be receipts for the equipment, some of which was never
delivered.</TE>
<TE>   Shpirt then submitted those receipts to Medicare for
reimbursement, according to the indictment. The U.S. attorney's
office said the government's loss from those fraudulent claims has
not yet been determined, but is estimated at several hundred thousand
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The case was investigated by the Department of Health and Human
Services' inspector general and the Internal Revenue Service's
criminal division.</TE>
<TE>   A judge ordered Plotkin and Shpirt each to post $750,000 bond.
Gonzalez's bail was set at $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, defense lawyer Jilbert Tahmazian said the
government's case was "without merit" and predicted that the suspects
would be exonerated.</TE>

<HD>Family of Missing Girl Asks for Help</HD>
<DH>Search: New photos are offered. Father, found slain, is
said to have acted strangely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mother of a missing Altadena girl said Friday that the girl's
father had been behaving strangely for about a year before he
disappeared with the 11-year-old; he was found dead this week in
Northern California, apparently a suicide victim.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing has been heard from Jeanene Bonner, and investigators in
Butte County and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported
no progress in finding her Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Kim Almodovar, Jeanene's mother, told a news conference at Loma
Alta Elementary School, which her daughter attends, that the father
had seemed depressed, separated himself from friends, was taking
drugs and had grown temperamental with Jeanene in the last year.
Joaquin Garcia, 35, was a Downey truck driver.</LD>
<TE>   Still, she said, he had often taken his daughter with him over the
last year and returned her more or less on time.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia picked up his daughter May 21, and she was supposed to have
returned to school May 24.</TE>
<TE>   A huge signed poster and yellow ribbons at the school made it
clear that Jeanene, described as a sixth-grade honor student, is
missed by students and teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Her father's pickup truck, with his body inside, was found
Wednesday in Butte County, about 100 miles north of Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   He had a gun in his right hand, and had apparently killed himself,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no sign of the girl, and a search of nearby areas was
fruitless.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanene's uncle, Henry Bonner of North Hollywood, wept Friday as
he joined her mother in appealing for public help in finding her.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a really bright girl, so I know, if she was able to get to
a phone or to make a call, she would do it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The family released new pictures of the girl and said missing
children's groups, such as the Polly Klass Foundation, are helping
publicize the case.</TE>

<HD>Spielberg Role as Student a Wrap</HD>
<DH>Education: Fellow grads are thrilled by filmmaker's
presence at ceremony. 'He will give us a sense of validity,' says
one.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Up until 8:56 a.m. Friday, four minutes before the band started to
play "Pomp and Circumstance," the film-school grads at Cal State Long
Beach still didn't believe that Steven Spielberg was actually going
to walk with them.</LD>
<LD>   Forget the news reports that Spielberg had completed his degree 34
years after dropping out. Nevermind the media crush waiting outside,
or the security force hovering around. They didn't believe it until
Spielberg slipped into line dressed in a cap and gown, right there in
the breezeway, right there with them, four minutes before
commencement.</LD>
<LD>   ''Yay, he's walking! He's walking with us!" one of the guys in
line shouted. Cheers erupted, handshakes were exchanged, pocket
cameras started snapping, and Steven Spielberg--among the most
honored filmmakers of Hollywood--became one of 167 graduates of the
Department of Film and Electronic Arts.</LD>
<TE>   Spielberg finished the Cal State Long Beach film-school program he
abandoned in 1968 by writing term papers, meeting with professors and
completing several general education courses, all through independent
study.</TE>
<TE>   He registered under a pseudonym to protect his privacy and the
film-school director decided that Spielberg deserved to pass out of
senior-level filmmaking courses for the body of his professional
work. Think "Schindler's List," and "Saving Private Ryan."</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg didn't give a speech and didn't hold a news conference
at the ceremony, where he sat on a beige folding chair on the central
campus quad with about 500 other graduates from the College of the
Arts, which includes music, dance, art and filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, actress Kate Capshaw, his mother, Leah Adler, and
father, Arnold Spielberg, who had front-row seats, stood on tiptoes
and stretched their necks to see him. Finally Adler stepped up on a
stage stairway and put her hands to her cheeks, beaming with pride as
her 55-year-old graduate marched in, his salt and pepper hair showing
under his mortarboard.</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg had said in an earlier statement that he wanted to
complete his degree as a thank-you to his parents for giving him the
opportunity for an education and career and to set an example for his
children.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, his classmates--while adjusting their caps and posing for
photos--talked about the symbolism of Spielberg walking with them,
sitting among them. These film-school grads are a small group, almost
underdogs compared with the larger classes at better-known cinema
schools at USC and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "He will give us a sense of validity," said Mikhail Nayfeld.</TE>
<TE>   "If he walks with us, then it will show that there is no barrier
between the rich upper class and the lower class," said Nathan
Pereau, 21, of Whittier. "If he doesn't, well that's just the way it
is."</TE>
<TE>   Up until the moment Spielberg arrived, rumors were flying: He's
going to sit on the stage. He's going to sit with us. He's waiting in
Brotman Hall. He's waiting in a limo.</TE>
<TE>   After everyone had settled into the ceremony, it was clear
Spielberg was just one of the crowd--although half a dozen
plainclothes bodyguards tightly surrounded him and his entourage.</TE>
<TE>   Even Cal State Long Beach President Robert C. Maxson referred to
the school's most famous alum in his opening remarks: "Mr. Spielberg,
your presence is a wonderful statement about honoring commitment,
about honoring obligations," he said. "When you graduate with your
classmates, you will finish the unfinished."</TE>
<TE>   About an hour later, his name was called, the singular moment no
graduate forgets:</TE>
<TE>   "Steven Allen Spielberg." And for him, the orchestra belted out a
15-second rendition of the theme from "Raiders of the Lost Ark." The
6,000 or so in the crowd stood in ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg, after shaking hands with Maxson, looked out over the
crowd and jubilantly raised his hands with clenched fists, then held
up two fingers in the victory sign for all to see.</TE>
<TE>   But although Spielberg walked in like a film student, he walked
out like the billionaire moviemaker he is. A phalanx of bodyguards
swiftly escorted him away, gown flowing behind him, and opened the
door to his black Mercedes S-500, which drove off into the 7th Street
traffic, followed by a stretch limousine, a BMW and a university
police car.</TE>

<HD>Grand Jury Finds No Fault With Dam Project</HD>
<DH>Environment: The panel agrees with county officials that
the Lang Ranch structure is needed to protect homes and habitat from
storms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The controversial Lang Ranch Dam project in Thousand Oaks is
necessary to protect homeowners and wildlife habitat in the event of
a massive storm, states a Ventura County Grand Jury report released
this week.</LD>
<LD>   After hearing complaints about the dam at a Board of Supervisors
meeting, the panel investigated the $5-million project by meeting
with various city and county leaders and visiting the site, which is
off Westlake Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   Critics of the dam have long argued that the structure will make
the surrounding hillsides--where homeowners live--more susceptible to
landslides.</LD>
<TE>   County officials contend that no such danger exists.</TE>
<TE>   "Concern about the building of the dam on unstable land was based
on misinformation, and the fact is that all required studies have
been made, and safety issues settled," according to the four-page
grand jury report.</TE>
<TE>   During its investigation, the panel learned that a landslide area
does exist near the dam site, but that it is located more than 200
yards downstream and wouldn't compromise the structure. Additionally,
the panel determined that geologists have confirmed the stability of
the dam.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope this report lends additional credence that this project
was done with input from stakeholders on all sides of the issue and
that many recommendations were incorporated," said Jeff Pratt, the
county's flood-control manager.</TE>
<TE>   Construction on the dam, which is expected to take about six
months, started last month. The dam will be 661/2 feet tall and will
include an 11.5-acre storm water retention basin, a debris basin and
access roads.</TE>
<TE>   Dam opponent Gerry Langer said in an interview that he feels the
grand jury's investigation was incomplete. A group led by Langer sued
to stop the dam, but dropped the legal action when officials said the
project would go forward despite litigation.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury "didn't get any input from our geological experts,"
Langer said. "They would have learned that the boundaries of the
landslide are not fully known ... and that, under those
circumstances, it's not safe for a dam."</TE>
<TE>   Langer, who led the Save Lang Oaks Fund, also said the county
panel did not contact members of his organization or residents in the
area who already have experienced minor problems with housing
foundations.</TE>
<TE>   "From my point of view, [the report] isn't worth the paper it's
printed on," Langer added.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its lawsuit, Langer's group also had sought to stop
the removal of 40 oak trees at the site. Grand jurors found that most
of those trees had lived beyond their expected life span and that
many were diseased.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Signs City Budget That Avoids Service Cuts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn on Friday signed a $4.83-billion
budget for next year that preserves current levels of city services.</LD>
<LD>   At the start of the budget process, officials anticipated an
agonizing debate over how to allocate diminishing city revenues.
Instead, the city's fiscal health improved, allowing cuts in services
to be avoided.</LD>
<LD>   Drafting the 2002-03 budget "could have been a very painful
process," Hahn said Friday during an appearance in Silver Lake.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody worked real hard ... on the toughest budget year we've
had probably in a decade. I was very pleased with the way it turned
out."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the year, officials predicted a $250-million budget
shortfall because of falling tax revenues, and warned that everything
but public safety programs could face cuts. But the local economy
improved, allowing the city to close most of the gap.</TE>
<TE>   When Hahn presented the City Council his proposed budget in April,
he preserved current levels of services and slightly increased the
amount of money for the Police and Fire departments.</TE>
<TE>   To make up a $38-million shortfall, his budget team trimmed
programs inside the city bureaucracy, such as mail services, building
upkeep and travel. A citywide hiring freeze was kept in place.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's proposed budget sailed through the City Council, which
made only minor changes to the spending document.</TE>
<TE>   After projections that city revenues will go up more than
anticipated, the council increased the city's reserve fund from $64
million to $102 million.</TE>
<TE>   The council rejected Hahn's proposal to eliminate several dozen
police positions in special offices and transfer that staff back out
into the field.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he did not make any changes to the final budget document
the council submitted to him last week. The new budget takes effect
July 1, the beginning of the 2002-03 fiscal year.</TE>

<HD>Flier About Stabbings a Hoax, Police Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A flier distributed in North Hollywood that warns of criminals
approaching pedestrians and randomly stabbing them is a hoax, the Los
Angeles Police Department said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not true," said Sgt. Bill Martin of the LAPD's North
Hollywood Division. "But we have an idea who is doing this, and that
person has been trying to cause anti-police sentiment within the
community."</LD>
<LD>   Martin said he was unsure what charges, if any, could be brought
if the author of the flier is identified.</LD>
<TE>   The handout, printed in large letters with "NoHo Crime Alert!,"
has been found on car windshields in the central section of North
Hollywood near Magnolia and Lankershim boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   The fliers warn that "Walking after dark has become risky due to
the random stabbing of individuals walking alone."</TE>
<TE>   They also caution people to "beware of any vehicle that stops
suddenly whose occupants approach mumbling or requesting help with
directions," warning that they will "attack ... without provocation."</TE>
<TE>   Police say they are particularly upset by the handout's language,
calling it inflammatory and pointing out that it lists the LAPD North
Hollywood Division and Senior Lead Officer Nancy Reaves as contacts.</TE>
<TE>   Martin said the police also object to the use of the Neighborhood
Watch logo, which falsely implies the flier may be authentic.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Secession Called Harmful to City</HD>
<DH>Breakup: L.A. officials hope their findings will persuade
panel to not put issue on the ballot. Cityhood advocates call move a
bid to block vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The proposed breakaway city of Hollywood would be fiscally unstable,
provide less service to its residents and harm the remainder of Los
Angeles, according to reports released Friday by city officials.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously to send the
documents to the Local Agency Formation Commission in hopes of
persuading the agency to vote against putting Hollywood secession on
the November ballot.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't understate our concerns," said City Administrative
Officer William Fujioka.</LD>
<TE>   "The new city would survive only if the city of Los Angeles loans
the city money and if the Hollywood city makes service cuts."</TE>
<TE>   Secession advocates, however, said the move is a last-ditch
attempt to stop voters from deciding Hollywood's fate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little voodoo economics, a little Enron
economics--anything to try to justify their position," said Gene La
Pietra, president of Hollywood VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear as a bell to any professional that Hollywood generates
more than enough revenue to provide services at a higher level than
we're currently getting from the city of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, LAFCO's executive officer said the proposed
city of 160,000 would be financially viable, and commissioners said
the panel was likely to decide in favor of a Hollywood vote.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, LAFCO will decide whether to give voters the
opportunity to make Hollywood an independent city.</TE>
<TE>   If the proposal is placed on the ballot, it must capture a
majority of voters in the breakaway area and a majority citywide.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said they didn't have time to thoroughly respond to
the LAFCO recommendation because it was released Tuesday, and they
needed to submit responses to LAFCO on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Fujioka said the proposal is inherently flawed.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, Los Angeles would lend the new city $10 million
and Hollywood would cut public services by $10 million. This proves
that the city is not financially viable, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the city's reserve would be too small--0.53% of its
revenue. In contrast, Los Angeles' reserve is 5.3%, the reports say.</TE>
<TE>   The documents also say the city of Los Angeles would be harmed if
the 15-square-mile Hollywood area is carved out.</TE>
<TE>   Payments to compensate Los Angeles for lost revenue, which would
start at $21.3 million the first year, are a fraction of what they
ought to be, the reports say.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, some of Los Angeles' assets--most notably the famed
Hollywood sign--would become part of the new city.</TE>
<TE>   "The city of Los Angeles has not consented to that," said Fred
Merkin, assistant city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "No compensation has been offered to the city. We believe that
would be unconstitutional."</TE>
<TE>   Council members voiced concerns that a number of issues have not
yet been addressed, including traffic impacts on surrounding
communities and funding for major seismic upgrades for four hospitals
in the new city's boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   "The City Council of Los Angeles has a responsibility to all the
citizens of the city to make sure that all the facts are on the
table," said Councilman Tom LaBonge, who represents much of
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "The dismemberment of Los Angeles is a bad idea."</TE>
<TE>   But La Pietra said it's time for Hollywood residents to vote on
the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "One hundred years of neglect can't be swept under the rug any
longer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a related development Friday, LAFCO Executive Director Larry
Calemine said removing two disputed areas from the proposed Hollywood
boundaries would not hurt the new city's finances.</TE>
<TE>   But he said a third area should not be removed because its loss
would be significant.</TE>
<TE>   The two areas that Calemine said would have little impact, if
removed, are a section of Griffith Park near the Hollywood sign and a
neighborhood of about 630 residents west of Western Avenue and north
of Franklin Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   A small group of residents from the Western-Franklin area, which
includes Laughlin Park, has asked LAFCO to remove it from the
proposed city, saying the neighborhood is in Los Feliz, not
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The third area, home to about 3,290, borders Romaine Street and
Willoughby Avenue on the north, Melrose Avenue on the south, La Brea
Avenue on the east and Fairfax Avenue on the west.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine said excluding that area would shrink the new city's
revenues by $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO will take up the border recommendations at 9 a.m. Wednesday
in the Board of Supervisors hearing room at the county Hall of
Administration, 500 W. Temple St.</TE>

<HD>INS Workers' Union Criticizes LAX Manager</HD>
<DH>Labor: A letter accuses Port Director G. Thomas Graber of
bias and ethics violations. Agency plans no action because the
charges are anonymous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The union representing Immigration and Naturalization Service
employees in the Los Angeles area has declared that its members have
"no confidence" in a top INS manager responsible for day-to-day
operations at Los Angeles International Airport and the ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Local 505 of the National Immigration and Naturalization Service
Council sent a scathing letter last week expressing low morale and
"lack of confidence in the leadership, honesty and vision" provided
by G. Thomas Graber, who has been port director since 1997.</LD>
<LD>   Among the many misdeeds alleged, the union accused Graber--a
27-year INS veteran who heads a staff of more than 300 inspectors and
other personnel--of "discrimination, double standards, ethics
violations, unspeakable fighting incident, dishonesty,
misappropriation of funds, misuse of government property" and
"loafing on the job." The letter provided no details and union
officials refused to expand upon it, citing the privacy of affected
workers.</LD>
<TE>   Graber declined to comment on the allegations, other than to say,
"I certainly deny all of that." INS spokesman Francisco Arcaute said
Graber "continues to enjoy the full support of the INS."</TE>
<TE>   The four-paragraph letter was part of a well-documented pattern of
friction between INS management and the workforce that has plagued
the agency for years as the immigration workload has expanded
dramatically, and particularly since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   A former INS port director, Arthur Alvarez, was removed from his
LAX post in 1992 after female subordinates accused him in police
reports of sexual harassment. Alvarez later pleaded guilty to battery
and was ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment and placed on two
years' probation. He remains a special agent with the INS.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, an agency task force concluded that the INS work
environment in Los Angeles "is sufficiently hostile and volatile that
physical injury to managers and special agents is possible."</TE>
<TE>   Some veterans of the agency say tensions have heightened since the
Sept. 11 attacks highlighted the crucial role of the INS--working
with the FBI and other agencies--in trying to prevent terrorist
infiltration through airports, seaports and land borders.</TE>
<TE>   LAX is regarded as especially sensitive because it was the entry
point for 8.5 million international passengers in the most recent
fiscal year, ranking third in the nation. LAX was also the initial
port of entry for two of the Sept. 11 hijackers and was the target of
a thwarted terrorist bombing plot in late 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In February, some airport officers became enraged when a memo
written on Graber's behalf seemed to discourage officers from
responding to incidents of suspected terrorism in the interest of
keeping an eye on arriving international flights. Top INS officials
said ignoring terrorist threats was not the intent, but cited
pressure to carry out inspections with limited staff.</TE>
<TE>   The fight mentioned in the union letter alludes to a physical
fracas between Graber and a subordinate at the Tom Bradley
International Terminal in June 2000 that has become infamous among
immigration officers. Both men were temporarily reassigned and
received 14-day suspensions, according to sources, but subsequently
returned to their airport duties.</TE>
<TE>   INS employees "have little respect for [Graber] and demand that
action be taken against this manager," said the letter, which was
sent to INS District Director Thomas J. Schiltgen.</TE>
<TE>   Schiltgen acknowledged the gravity of the allegations, but said he
planned no immediate action since the letter was signed only "union
representatives and bargaining unit employees"--without a specific
name.</TE>
<TE>   "While I take this letter very seriously," Schiltgen said, "if in
fact this is the position of the union, then I would expect them to
sign the letter."</TE>
<TE>   Alfreda Clyde, president of Local 505, which represents the
immigration workforce, said the letter was not signed because workers
fear retaliation. Clyde said the charges had nothing to do with
trying to win leverage on broad contract issues, since those are
negotiated in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The workers have witnessed all these things occurring, and they
came to the union and they want something to be done," added Clyde,
who said it was the first time the local had proclaimed no confidence
in a top manager.</TE>
<TE>   The letter demands immediate action, but did not call directly for
Graber's removal. Schiltgen said he hopes specific concerns can be
worked out in regular ongoing discussions between the union and
management.</TE>
<TE>   Such letters of no confidence are unusual but not unheard of, said
John Irvine, spokesman for the American Federation of Government
Employees.</TE>

<HD>Shortage Prompts Labor Action by Nurses</HD>
<DH>Unions: Frustrated RNs feel they are finally getting the
upper hand in negotiations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN and LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Emboldened by a worsening nursing shortage, unionized nurses
throughout California are conducting informational pickets,
threatening strikes and walking off the job to demand higher pay and
better working conditions.</LD>
<LD>   The heightened activism is being led by two rival unions that have
seized upon nurses' frustration to launch large-scale organizing
drives and push for major contract improvements.</LD>
<LD>   The workplace climate clearly has hospitals on edge. Two medical
centers affiliated with Sutter Health in Northern California have
asked temporary nurse staffing agencies to prepare for strikes, even
though union contracts with the hospitals haven't expired.</LD>
<TE>   "When you look at the labor activity around the state and when you
look at some of the tough issues that are out there in negotiations,
we have to be prepared for a worst-case scenario," said Debbie
Goodin, vice president of administrative services at Mills-Peninsula
Health Services, affiliated with Sutter Health.</TE>
<TE>   By coincidence, many of the contracts negotiated by the California
Nurses Assn., the state's largest nurses' union, will come up for
renewal this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a very hot summer in California," said Rose Ann
DeMoro, executive director of the CNA, which represents more than
44,000 registered nurses. "The nurses are stepping up and taking the
power they should have always had. It's incumbent upon the nurses to
save the [hospital] industry from itself."</TE>
<TE>   Consolidation of the hospital industry, especially takeovers by
large corporations, has emboldened the nurses, said Lois Friss, an
emeritus professor of health administration at USC.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're in the neighborhood and you're working for your
community hospital, they don't come across as big, powerful,
important, rich organizations," Friss said. "But when you see a big
system, a UC system, you become aware that it isn't individual orders
of nuns with one or two hospitals. It's easer to say, 'Hey, maybe
we're being taken advantage of and we need to do something about
it.'"</TE>
<TE>   Among the recent job actions:</TE>
<TE>   * The union representing nearly 8,000 nurses within the massive
University of California health system voted to strike last month
after negotiations stalled. Days before a planned one-day walkout,
the UC agreed to drop its long-standing merit pay plan, which had
been a key dividing point with the California Nurses Assn. The strike
was averted.</TE>
<TE>   * Health-care workers, including registered nurses, staged a
walkout over the Memorial Day weekend at Queen of Angels-Hollywood
Presbyterian Medical Center to protest low wages. This week, the
hospital suspended at least 30 nurses who called in sick the day
before the walkout. The Service Employees International Union has
filed charges against the hospital of retaliation and intimidation
with the National Labor Relations Board. A hospital spokeswoman
wouldn't comment.</TE>
<TE>   * Nurses at 20 Catholic Healthcare West hospitals--including
Glendale Memorial Hospital and California Hospital Medical Center in
Los Angeles--held an informational picket on Thursday to draw
attention to what they consider problems affecting nurse retention
and recruitment. A spokesman for Catholic Healthcare West said the
system stands by its latest contract with the nurses, which was
ratified six months ago</TE>
<TE>   * Registered nurses at Palomar Medical Center in Escondido voted
in favor of a protest strike in June, even though they are not
represented by a union. The nurses and the hospital's governing board
disagree about which nurses are eligible for union representation,
delaying a union recognition vote.</TE>
<TE>   "Nurses are so willing to organize to deal with patient issues,
they're willing to strike before they have representation," said
David Johnson, the CNA's Southern California director.</TE>
<TE>   The largest contract set for renewal this summer involves 10,000
nurses who work for Kaiser Permanente in Northern California. In
1997-98, when the previous contract expired, the CNA held six
strikes--each lasting one to three days--at Kaiser's 47 facilities
from Fresno to Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser spokesman Jim Anderson said the company wants to ensure
that its nurses are happy. "We're doing a lot to listen to what our
nurses are saying and the concerns they're raising, and we're trying
to address them both within and without the upcoming bargaining
process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Health labor experts say several issues are coming together at
once. Nurses have grown increasingly upset about working conditions,
wages and benefits. They want a share of the proceeds from
double-digit HMO premium increases. And they want limits on mandatory
overtime shifts and the number of patients assigned to each nurse.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, the average salary of a full-time registered nurse in
2000 was $46,410, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
In California, the average annual salary was $56,140.</TE>
<TE>   Many veteran nurses see less need to work, and not enough young
ones are being trained to replace them.</TE>
<TE>   "You've had a drumbeat now for 18 months, with people from
different quarters saying, 'This is a crisis,'" said Edward O'Neil,
director of the Center for the Health Professions at UC San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, thanks to advances in medical care, patients in
regular units are sicker than those treated in intensive care 25
years ago, said Luisa Blue, president of the SEIU Nurse Alliance of
California. At the same time, she said, "because of managed care,
there is this tremendous pressure to get patients out of the hospital
sooner."</TE>
<TE>   Jan Emerson, spokeswoman for the California Healthcare Assn., a
hospital industry organization, said registered nurses have an
advantage because of the worsening shortage.</TE>
<TE>   "They can threaten to strike and get some concessions," she said.
"What they have in their favor is economics of supply and demand."</TE>
<TE>   Goodin of Mills-Peninsula said her medical center went into
negotiations with the nurses knowing that "we would have to be very
generous with our offers.... It's definitely not a negotiating
environment in which one can introduce any significant take-aways."</TE>
<TE>   The CNA and SEIU have both seen their ranks increase in recent
years, but the two unions have taken opposing positions on several
important issues such as staffing levels, collaboration with
hospitals and the role of licensed vocational nurses.</TE>
<TE>   One labor expert called the longtime battle between the two unions
unfortunate.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the people in both of those organizations actually have
the same vision for the labor movement, but they've been stepping on
each other's toes for a long time," said Kate Bronfenbrenner,
director of labor education research at Cornell University.</TE>
<TE>   Nurses say hospitals haven't done enough to keep them happy.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of hospitals have been losing senior nurses because of
benefits," said Myrna Valmeo-Ogilvie, a registered nurse at Glendale
Memorial Hospital who picketed on Thursday. "This is a good time. The
nurses are all inspired."</TE>

<HD>Ojai Seeks to Take Traffic Initiative Off the Fall Ballot</HD>
<DH>Law: Measure that would allow residents to decide on some
developments is confusing and illegal, city says. Backers argue
voters should have say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawyers for the city of Ojai urged a judge Friday to pull a
controversial traffic initiative from the November ballot, arguing
that the measure confuses voters and violates state law.</LD>
<LD>   But an attorney representing environmentalists backing the measure
argued that the city's complaints should be heard after the election,
not before, and asked the court not to interfere.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Superior Court Judge Henry J. Walsh took the matter
under consideration and said he would issue a written decision by the
end of next week.</LD>
<TE>   "Put it on the ballot," attorney Kate Neiswender, who represents
Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, said after the hearing. "If the voters
want it, great. If not, then this is moot."</TE>
<TE>   As proposed, the so-called Ojai Traffic Initiative would give city
voters, not elected officials, the authority to approve or reject
development projects that would increase traffic on the
already-congested highways winding into the Ojai Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents say the measure reaffirms existing standards for the
acceptable number of car trips on those highways and prevents city
leaders from approving projects in which traffic congestion cannot be
mitigated.</TE>
<TE>   But city officials say the measure is deceptive and, if approved,
would effectively create a moratorium on growth in Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a concerted effort by a small group of people to stop
housing [construction] in Ojai," said attorney Katherine Stone, who
represents the city in its effort to remove the measure from the
ballot. "This group is trying to shut people out."</TE>
<TE>   Stone and Ojai City Atty. Monte Widders argue the measure is an
illegal attempt to block affordable housing, and runs counter to
state mandates that say cities must provide low-income housing.</TE>
<TE>   Widders further argued that backers of the measure failed to
include the full 33-page text of the city's traffic plan when they
circulated petitions, as required by law.</TE>
<TE>   But Neiswender told the judge that relevant portions of the plan
to be changed by the initiative were included in the materials
circulated by signature gatherers. She said the full text of the
document only would have confused voters.</TE>
<TE>   As for the city's other arguments, Neiswender said many turn on
issues that are in dispute and require research that cannot be
completed before the June 14 deadline for printing the fall ballot.
Those issues can be taken up after the election, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Neiswender said that the city waited seven months before
challenging the measure in court. The initiative was certified for
the ballot in August, but the city's lawsuit was not filed until
March.</TE>
<TE>   Questioned about the delay by the judge, Stone said lawyers had
their hands full with lawsuits filed by Citizens to Preserve the Ojai
over a proposed luxury housing development in downtown Ojai.</TE>

<LD>No wonder he wasn't worried about the police being summoned: The
crime log of the Los Alamitos News-Enterprise reported: "A
20-something man with a shaved head seen standing in a resident's
side yard for 10 minutes was a dummy."</LD>
<LD>   Big numbers: When I spoke at my son's elementary school career
day, one of the students, 9-year-old Jordan Curry, asked me if I use
math in my job.</LD>
<LD>   I assured him I do--often as a service to readers.</LD>
<TE>   For instance, when Anna Espinoza of Mission Viejo told me about a
2-ton watch (see accompanying), I got out my calculator and after
several minutes of work concluded that I could recommend it only to
readers who have very strong wrists.</TE>
<TE>   Did I miss the secession vote? David Boone of L.A. noticed that a
taxi company has already separated the Valley from the city of L.A.
(see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Is it worth all that noise? An anonymous reader came upon an
opening for a job that sounds as though it packs a lot of pressure
(see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Disco drama? "A woman reported that she suspected her vehicle was
taken from her gated carport, then returned," the San Clemente Sun
Post News said. "She said her tapes with music from the '70s were
taken."</TE>
<TE>   But there was no evidence "of forced entry or vehicle tampering."</TE>
<TE>   An ad or a commentary? My colleague Deirdre Edgar noted that the
billboard for the movie, "Mr. Deeds," has an ironic blurb.</TE>
<TE>   The movie co-stars Winona Ryder, who is awaiting trial on charges
of shoplifting $4,500 worth of goods from a Saks Fifth Avenue store.</TE>
<TE>   And the billboard says, "Don't let fancy clothes fool you."</TE>
<TE>   Weird oldies: I mentioned the customized version of the 1965 song,
"New York's a Lonely Town," which contained references to the old
rock 'n' roll station KRLA.</TE>
<TE>   Well, this wasn't the only case of radio plugola. "I have a
cassette of Harry Chapin at a concert in L.A.," wrote Mike Skinner of
Ventura. "While performing, 'WOLD,' a song about a well-traveled disc
jockey, he modifies the chorus once to say, 'I am the morning DJ at
KHJ.'"</TE>
<TE>   Ricardo Flores of Culver City recalled "KRLA King of the Wheels"
by the Bobby Fuller Four, which "was about the KRLA hot rod that the
station used as a promotional tool."</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Brame also remembered the Chapin and Fuller songs,
adding, "There's another song called, 'WPLJ,'"</TE>
<TE>   But, he noted, "It wasn't about radio. It stood for White Port
Lemon Juice."</TE>
<TE>   E-mail I don't bother to open: The subject heading said,
"Steve.harvey, amazing breast enhancing capsules.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: "How helpful would it be if you knew when someone was
lying to you?" begins the blurb for one class listed in the summer
catalog of the Long Beach Recreation and Parks Department.</TE>
<TE>   It's a fib-detection course titled, "Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire."
I'm surprised the class consists of just four hours of instruction.</TE>

<HD>Devil Beaten, They'll Face the Deep, Blue Sea</HD>
<DH>Swimmers--all of whom have battled cancer--will brave
sharks, cold in 60-mile fund-raising relay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It sounds like a worthy idea--a 60-mile relay swim from San Clemente
Island to San Clemente Pier on the mainland to raise money for cancer
research.</LD>
<LD>   In mid-July, when the swim will be attempted, ocean temperatures
are usually in the mid-60s and the waters are typically calm, with
the Baja storm season still a month away. And given that it's a
relay, each swimmer has to gut it out for only an hour before
returning to the support boat to rest.</LD>
<LD>   But that would not explain why the swim from San Clemente Island
to the mainland has never been completed.</LD>
<TE>   "Maybe because, as soon as you get beyond Catalina Island,
everything changes," said Dave Yudovin, 50, who has completed four
English Channel swims and is the only person to swim to the mainland
from three of the eight Channel Islands. "Once you're out of the
coastal waters, everything is a little more unpredictable. The wind
could be a bit stronger, the sea is higher and has a little more
roll, and there could be more danger."</TE>
<TE>   Yudovin is part of a six-man team--all of whom have battled
cancer--that will attempt the San Clemente swim this summer,
partially because of the sheer challenge and partially in the spirit
of charity. All six have years of experience in deep-water swimming,
something of a throwback in an era of extreme sports. They swim five
days a week--sometimes in swimming pools, sometimes in the ocean--and
average about 60 miles a month.</TE>
<TE>   But practice is only part of the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Taylor, 48, of Laguna Niguel will be wearing a $300
battery-powered device around his ankle to ward off sharks just like
the triathlon competitors in Sydney Harbor at the 2000 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been joking that they're going to send him the wrong model
and he'll get the shark bait instead of the repellent," said Scott
Zornig, 42, of Rancho Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Zornig knows it's no laughing matter. Three years ago in a
Maui Channel Swim relay, Zornig got out of the water just as a
15-foot tiger shark closed in. His team and 15 others pulled out of
the race.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear why no one has completed the swim from San Clemente
Island. Part of the reason--beyond the distance, the treacherous
waters and the shipping lanes that must be crossed--may be the cost.
John York, president of the Catalina Channel Swimming Federation,
said the average cost of an open-water swim is about $2,000, most
going toward renting a support boat. "And the further out you go, the
more expensive it is because you're adding time to your trip," said
York, whose group documents channel swims.</TE>
<TE>   For the six friends, all members of the Irvine Novaquatics Masters
Team, the lure of finishing the swim is powerful.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we're sharing this between the six of us, it's going to
have to be something pretty catastrophic for us not to finish this
thing," said Zornig, who pulled out of a solo 40-mile swim down the
Orange County coast a few years ago because of treacherous seas.</TE>
<TE>   So how do they deal with getting thrown about while trying to keep
their head above water, their stomach free of saltwater and their
stroke solid?</TE>
<TE>   "In choppy conditions, you have a tendency to do higher arm
recovery to clear the water," Taylor said. "You need to concentrate
on being efficient."</TE>
<TE>   The six swimmers will stay in the water for an hour before
rotating out.</TE>
<TE>   As each swimmer grinds out stroke after stroke, a support crew
will take care of everything else. At all times, at least two
teammates will act as observers on the support boat, looking for
sharks and other dangers. A kayaker will paddle alongside, acting as
the swimmers' guide.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people tend to fade about 2 a.m.," Taylor said. "So
we'll need some strong bodies on board to keep their eyes open."</TE>
<TE>   Brendan Halffman of Laguna Beach, the youngster of the group at
32, said the long haul will take a toll. "These things are great for
the first 10 hours. But getting back in the water the third time at 4
in the morning is kind of tough."</TE>
<TE>   The 46-foot power boat will make things a little easier. It will
be equipped with heavy-duty lights, food and beds for naps between
swims and spotting shifts. To help the spotters at night, each
swimmer will attach a plastic glow stick to his Speedo.</TE>
<TE>   Darkness also brings another danger into play: ships.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going right through the major shipping lanes, and the
shipping lanes are most active at night," said Mike Suttle, 49, of
Laguna Beach, the 58th person to swim solo from Catalina Island.
"You're going 2 mph and those boats are going 40 mph. It's like
crawling across the freeway."</TE>
<TE>   If there is a strong current, Taylor believes his group could
reach San Clemente Pier in about 20 hours. If conditions turn nasty,
30 hours. The goal is to step on shore on July 21, during the annual
San Clemente Ocean Festival.</TE>
<TE>   If they make history--or even if they don't--a member of the
channel swimming federation will be there to document the attempt. So
far, 98 people have completed the 21-mile Catalina swim, four have
completed the Anacapa Island-to-Ventura swim, and two have stroked
their way from Santa Cruz Island to the Ventura coast.</TE>
<TE>   On the San Clemente Island journey, swimmers will be motivated by
the ultimate goal of raising money for the Pediatric Cancer Division
at the City of Hope. All have been affected by cancer, Yudovin most
directly. Fifteen years ago, he was given a 50-50 chance of living
two days after receiving a leukemia diagnosis.</TE>
<TE>   After an operation to remove his spleen and several months of
chemotherapy, Yudovin was back in the water. Two years after his
diagnosis, Yudovin became the first person to swim the Tsugaru
Straight off the coast of Japan.</TE>

<HD>8 Months After Death, Knott's Allowed to Reopen Water Ride</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State officials gave Knott's Berry Farm approval Friday to reopen its
Perilous Plunge water ride, eight months after a 40-year-old Duarte
woman fell to her death.</LD>
<LD>   The attraction--billed as the world's steepest and tallest flume
ride--soaks people at the end of a 75-degree, 115-foot drop. It will
likely reopen today with overhauled safety restraints, just in time
for the busy summer season.</LD>
<LD>   "We're very happy with the work that Knott's Berry Farm has done
to make the rides safer," said Dean Fryer, state Department of
Occupational Safety and Health spokesman. "They've met all of the
requirements that we've outlined."</LD>
<TE>   Officials from the state agency charged with amusement park
oversight notified Knott's Friday that they had approved the changes,
completed inspections and were releasing the ride back into
operation.</TE>
<TE>   Knott's Berry Farm General Manager Jack Falfas said he didn't
immediately reopen Perilous Plunge because employees were undergoing
training and practice with the new restraint system.</TE>
<TE>   The state accident investigation determined that Lori Mason-Larez
died because the lap bar and seat belt were not adequate. The state
ordered park officials to design better restraints.</TE>
<TE>   The 292-pound woman fell out of the ride as it plunged at speeds
up to 50 mph. State officials at the time said her weight may have
been a factor, but they were not convinced the restraints were
adequate for an average-sized person.</TE>
<TE>   Falfas hired a group of ride engineers and safety consultants to
develop a new prototype restraint. They decided on a four-point
restraint system similar to those used by fighter jet pilots.</TE>
<TE>   The harness comes over the shoulders and wraps across the waist.
The T-shaped lap bar will remain on the ride, as will handles in
front of the passengers.</TE>

<HD>County Adopts Guidelines on Medicinal Pot</HD>
<DH>Treatment: Supervisors on Tuesday will discuss law
enforcement's allowance of six plants or 1 pound of dried marijuana
per patient.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After six years of wrangling with medicinal marijuana users on a
case-by-case basis, Ventura County law enforcement officials have
officially adopted a set of guidelines that lay out how much pot a
person can legally possess.</LD>
<LD>   The guidelines, which allow for six plants of any size or 1 pound
of dried pot for an approved patient, will be discussed publicly for
the first time Tuesday at the Board of Supervisors meeting.</LD>
<LD>   "They are needed to give both front-line officers and narcotics
officers some parameters to work with," Undersheriff Craig Husband
said Friday.</LD>
<TE>   In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, commonly known
as the Compassionate Use Act, which allows a seriously ill person to
use marijuana with a written recommendation from a physician.</TE>
<TE>   However, the law does not include a provision for how much
marijuana a person can grow or possess, a decision that state leaders
have said should be left to individual counties.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of standards, police officers across the state were
left to guess what constituted a reasonable amount of marijuana.
This, activists said, led to unnecessary arrests and the seizure of
legally grown pot.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a couple of bad experiences where an arrest was made and
people alleged we had taken their plants and destroyed them," said
Walter Wall, assistant county counsel. "We needed something that
gives people some expectation on how we interpret the law."</TE>
<TE>   For 66-year-old Jerry Wilbanks, the guidelines are a step in the
right direction, but far too restrictive for medicinal users who want
to grow a large crop that can yield several pounds of marijuana at
once.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura man, who said he smokes marijuana for chronic pain
resulting from several back and heart surgeries, asked the Board of
Supervisors two weeks ago to outline and discuss the guidelines after
officers came to his home and confiscated 34 of his 38 marijuana
plants. He was allowed to keep several ounces of dried pot in his
freezer.</TE>
<TE>   A Decision After Nearly Two Years of Research</TE>
<TE>   With little fanfare and no publicity, a panel of city and county
law enforcement leaders adopted the guidelines more than two months
ago after spending nearly two years conducting research on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Because this is a policy among law enforcement agencies,
supervisors will not vote on the rules, but only make the issue
public.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Bob Brooks, outgoing Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury and
the chiefs of police in Ventura, Oxnard, Simi Valley, Santa Paula and
Port Hueneme have all signed off on the guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Officials drafted the policy by studying guidelines in several
Northern California counties.</TE>
<TE>   They opted to mimic Butte and El Dorado counties, which also allow
for six plants or 1 pound of dried pot.</TE>
<TE>   Local law enforcement officials maintain one marijuana plant can
produce about 1 pound of dried pot, which can be used to make about
1,000 cigarettes. A patient could, therefore, smoke nearly three
cigarettes a day for nearly a year, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines, in effect since late March, come in the wake of a
lawsuit filed by three unnamed activists in 2000 against the Ventura
County Sheriff's Department. The plaintiffs asked a judge to specify
how much a patient could possess.</TE>
<TE>   The suit was dismissed when law enforcement leaders finished
drafting the guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Greg Totten, the incoming district
attorney, supports the new guidelines but said his office will
continue to prosecute people who are not legitimate medicinal users.</TE>
<TE>   Totten and other officials said they supported the guidelines, but
were less than enthusiastic about the pending public discussion.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not advocating everyone using marijuana, and that's the
problem with bringing it up," said Supervisor John Flynn, but "we
have to address the issue and make people aware of the guidelines."</TE>

<HD>District Is Accused of Ignoring Warnings</HD>
<DH>Schools: Officials were told of inappropriate behavior by
Camarillo teacher two years before he was charged with molesting,
claim says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Parents and students warned Camarillo High School officials of
inappropriate behavior by Chad Pridgen at least two years before the
30-year-old science teacher was charged with molesting 11 teenage
boys, according to a legal claim released by the Oxnard Union High
School District on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The claim alleges that district and school officials ignored
complaints brought against Pridgen--at least one of which was in
writing--and seeks up to $32 million in damages from the district,
the school board, Camarillo High School and several individual
employees.</LD>
<LD>   It further accuses district officials of trying to keep
information from the alleged victims' families and the public even
after Pridgen's Feb. 5 arrest, by destroying documents, lying to
investigators and refusing to be interviewed.</LD>
<TE>   Carol Woo, attorney for the school district, could not be reached
for comment. Woo released the claim, filed on behalf of four alleged
victims and their families, late Friday in response to a request
filed Wednesday by The Times under the California Public Records Act.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen, a teacher and coach at the school for six years, faces 39
criminal counts involving 11 teenage boys, all but two of whom were
students at the high school. The alleged sex acts occurred during the
last two years and range from felonies, such as forcing boys to have
oral sex, to misdemeanors that involved behaving lewdly in front of
minors.</TE>
<TE>   According to the claim filed May 24, former Principal Terry
Tackett was given information in 1999 by a student and the student's
parents about inappropriate comments allegedly made by Pridgen to
male students.</TE>
<TE>   This included telling them stories about men giving each other
oral sex, inquiring about the boys' sex lives and asking whether the
teenagers had ever had sex with a man Pridgen's age.</TE>
<TE>   Several other school officials were "put on notice of these
inappropriate, lewd and sexually harassing comments and questions on
a number of occasions, but negligently failed to investigate the
complaints, and subsequently failed to supervise, train or terminate
Pridgen," according to the claim.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview earlier this month with investigators, Tackett
denied that he had ever received such complaints about Pridgen.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer Coach Turned In Written Warning</TE>
<TE>   The claim also includes a hand-written letter dated Oct. 21, 2001,
and signed by Rachel Hornbek, a junior varsity girls soccer coach at
Camarillo High.</TE>
<TE>   That letter, sent to current Principal Sylvia Jackson, states
Hornbek had "heard reports that Mr. Pridgen shared sexually explicit
stories from his personal life" with students in his soccer class.</TE>
<TE>   During her third interview with investigators, Jackson admitted
she received the letter and faxed it to Assistant Supt. Roger Rice,
the claim says.</TE>
<TE>   Hornbek was never contacted by anyone from the district office to
discuss the allegations in her letter, and no further action was
taken, according to the claim. In the fall of 2001, Hornbek also told
her supervisor, Athletic Director Mike Smith, that students had told
her that Pridgen talked constantly about oral sex and provided
underage students with alcohol during parties at his house.</TE>
<TE>   Rice denied knowing about the allegations in Hornbek's letter. He
said he reports directly to Supt. Gary Davis, who has refused to be
interviewed by investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Steven A. Gama, the school district's risk manager, said Thursday
that officials want to resolve the claim outside of court. He said
the district is conducting its own investigation into the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura attorney Brenda Andrade, who filed the claim, declined to
comment on the allegations against the school district.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen has been on unpaid leave since his arrest Feb. 5. He is
free on $500,000 bail, and his preliminary hearing is set for July
23.</TE>
<TE>   Teacher Allegedly Used Authority to Coerce Sex</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Pridgen sexually harassed and molested students on
and off campus for at least 21/2 years. Prosecutors also have argued
that Pridgen used his authority as a teacher to coerce teenage boys
into engaging in sex acts with him.</TE>
<TE>   The criminal investigation began when one of the alleged victims,
now 18, reported to police in late January that Pridgen asked him in
his classroom to perform oral sex on another student.</TE>

<HD>Preparing for Threat of Suicide Bombings</HD>
<DH>Crime: Members of the LAPD and county Sheriff's Department
are trained by Israeli national police in how to prevent and handle
such terrorist attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles law enforcement officials have quietly begun preparing
for possible suicide bomber attacks, laying plans to confront a
threat that experts say could be psychologically devastating.</LD>
<LD>   A detective from the LAPD bomb squad and two Los Angeles County
sheriff's experts in explosives and arson visited Israel in late
April for 10 days of training from the Israeli national police.</LD>
<LD>   In turn, these officers have conducted 10 briefings for local law
enforcement officials on what they learned about preventing--and
handling--attacks by terrorists who wade into crowds with explosives
strapped to their bodies.</LD>
<TE>   "We learned enough during our trip to do some preplanning here, so
we'll be prepared," said Sheriff's Deputy Mark Seibel, one of the
three who went for training. "We won't have to backpedal or find out
what to do if this happens."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's Los Angeles office, meanwhile, sponsored a recent
briefing for local bomb technicians, said spokeswoman Laura Bosley.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials are reluctant to describe specifically
the measures they would take if suicide bombers struck.</TE>
<TE>   But those who went to Israel for training said among the lessons
they learned is the importance of keeping such bombers outside of
confined areas, such as movie theaters, malls or amusement parks, in
the interest of holding casualties down. The Israeli experts also
stressed the value of cleaning up quickly and resuming the normal
flow of life as fast as possible if a bombing happens.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to be ready," said Ralph Morten, a 24-year veteran of the
Los Angeles Police Department who organized the mission to Israel and
has been studying suicide bombings since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Several terrorism experts--though not all--agree that Los Angeles
is, in the words of L. Paul Bremer, an ambassador for
counter-terrorism efforts during the Reagan administration, a
"tempting target" for suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   All agree that L.A. law enforcement agencies are correct in
training themselves for the eventuality.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Iden, assistant FBI director in charge of the Los Angeles
office, "supports those efforts and encourages them as prudent,"
Bosley said. "It's a potential reality."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Levin, a terrorism expert at Cal State San Bernardino,
agreed. "I think we are going to see suicide bombings here in the
U.S., and Los Angeles is at the top of the list as a possible
target," not only because of its size, but because of its high Jewish
population, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You need not have a sustained course of bombings to have a
profound effect on the American psyche," said Levin, director of the
university's Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.</TE>
<TE>   Portland, Ore., Police Chief Mark Kroeker, a former LAPD deputy
chief and former security monitor for the U.S. and the United Nations
in Israel and Bosnia, said the possibility of suicide bombings in Los
Angeles "is very strong. With L.A.'s very representative ethnic
population, the Middle Eastern tensions are replicated in the L.A.
area. To prepare for the possibility in all of our big cities is, I
think, very, very wise."</TE>
<TE>   But David Charters, director of the Center of Conflict Studies at
the University of New Brunswick, Canada, sounded a note of caution
about such warnings.</TE>
<TE>   While many angry Palestinians have been willing to blow themselves
up in Israel, "the Palestinian minority in the U.S. don't seem to be
inclined to violence," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Qaeda terrorist network faces steep challenges in finding
would-be martyrs willing and able to enter the United States after
security precautions taken since Sept. 11, Charters said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying there isn't a threat or a capability there, but my
sense is it's probably limited," he said. "I'm not prepared to
dismiss the notion that those attacks could occur, but at the same
time I think it should not be overestimated."</TE>
<TE>   Morten and Seibel, who went to Israel along with Sheriff's Deputy
Heidi Clark, declined to talk in detail about what preparations are
being made. But they said they hoped that in going public in a
limited way they would increase public vigilance in Los Angeles
against any suicide bombing attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Without outlining a specific set of warning signs, they hope
people will be alert for "anything out of place, odd or unusual,"
Morten said. "We all have to take a very proactive stance toward
interdicting bombers. Notice them early, keep them outside and save
lives, that's what the Israelis told us.... Everyone's eyes and ears
are important. Don't hesitate to call 911 if you see anything
suspicious. Everyone has to be alert."</TE>
<TE>   Seibel said one of the things that most impressed him in Israel
was how determined the authorities were to share information about
the bombings there. "It was incredible," he said. "When a bomb goes
off, they make sure everyone knows everything about it, down to the
lowest level."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles officers said they went to a Jerusalem mall on
three occasions to observe preventive techniques, how the Israelis
identify suspicious vehicles or people and keep them from entering
the mall area, and how they identify suspicious people inside. "After
your vehicle is inspected, then you go through a magnetometer to get
into the mall," Seibel said.</TE>
<TE>   Morten noted that the LAPD bomb squad handled more than 1,000
calls in 2001, a big step up from the year before. But, he said, last
year the Tel Aviv bomb squad handled 56,000 calls.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An appeals court Friday struck down an anti-segregation policy in
Huntington Beach Union High School District that denies student
transfers based on race.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana states
that the policy to keep "racial and ethnic balance" is
unconstitutional, according to court documents.</LD>
<LD>   Donald Bruce Crawford, 56, of Fountain Valley sued the district,
alleging that the policy restricted transfers of white students from
schools with high numbers of minorities, such as Westminster High
School, which has a large Asian population.Crawford said late Friday
that the appeals court decision works toward a more integrated policy
in schools.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm very, very pleased with the court decision. I think we should
be a color-blind society," Crawford said. He filed his lawsuit in
1999 on principle after the school district revised its transfer

<TE>   "This policy is a flawed concept that resulted in schools locking
their doors to students who want to be there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   School district officials said the aim of the transfer policy is
to prevent racial segregation.</TE>
<TE>   "The policy is in place because it's state law, and our district
believes young people should go to various schools, so we had our
attorney draft up the policy in compliance," said Bonnie Castrey,
president of the district.</TE>
<TE>   Castrey said school officials will seek legal advice on whether to
appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford's lawsuit argued that the policy violated Proposition
209, the 1996 ballot initiative that banned consideration of race and
ethnicity in public education, thus ending affirmative action
policies statewide.</TE>

court in favor of the district.</TE>

<HD>David Appears to Beat Goliath in Wine War</HD>
<DH>Alcohol: A bill to limit foreign imports in state to
authorized distributors seems dead for now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Jake Sobotka loves fine wine, and he found a way to make it pay.</LD>
<LD>   As co-owner of Pasadena's Joshua Tree Imports, Sobotka supplies
Southern California's wine connoisseurs and restaurateurs with the
elusive vintages they seek, often at better prices than official U.S.
distributors. He calls France in the morning, casting about for cases
of rare Bordeaux. He dials up Australia in the afternoon, searching
for sweet deals on Shiraz.</LD>
<LD>   Until recently, phoning Sacramento was hardly on Sobotka's to-do
list. But he and dozens of other wine shop owners are making frequent
calls to the state capital, where they appear to be successfully
fighting off legislation backed by the world's largest liquor
supplier that threatened to drive them out of business.</LD>
<TE>   Diageo, a British conglomerate that counts Burger King, Guinness
beer and Moet &amp; Chandon champagne among its holdings, convinced
Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles) to carry a measure
outlawing so-called gray market wine imports.</TE>
<TE>   Only authorized distributors chosen by winemakers would be able to
bring their brands into California--an outcome that would clearly
benefit Diageo, which owns or has import rights to hundreds of French
and Italian wines, and two wholesalers that already control roughly
70% of the California market.</TE>
<TE>   Confronted with a death sentence by the Goliath of the industry,
Sobotka and other small importers could have somberly cracked open a
reserve bottle of Medoc and contemplated a career peddling insurance.
Instead they have chosen to fight.</TE>
<TE>   Under the name California Fine Wine Alliance, they have banded
together, hired lobbyists and publicists, put up a Web site and begun
waging war on what they consider a classic example of malodorous
special-interest legislation.</TE>
<TE>   They have cast a light on the campaign contributions the alcohol
giants have made to top legislators, including Firebaugh and Assembly
Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City). And they have recruited a key
ally: Robert M. Parker Jr. The wine critic who can make or break the
fortunes of vintners around the globe has written a blistering
critique of Assembly Bill 1922 as a monopolistic power play that
would ruin America's last truly free wine market.</TE>
<TE>   "California wine lovers would find the availability of fine
imported wines to be sharply reduced," Parker wrote in a letter.
"Many of the small entrepreneurs who have turned their passion for
wine into their life's work would be forced to find another way to
make a living. Without competition in the marketplace, prices will
inevitably rise--the additional profits going straight into the
pockets of a few large companies."</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, the little guys are winning. A Sonoma Valley winery
recently canceled a $5,000-per-couple fund-raiser for Firebaugh,
fearing bad publicity, and Firebaugh has since withdrawn his bill
from committee.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not interested in putting anyone out of business,"
Firebaugh, who believes his reputation has been unfairly tarnished by
the opposition campaign, said in an interview before pulling his
measure. An aide said it may return later this year in amended form.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Initially, opponents said, passage of the wine bill looked like a
fait accompli.</TE>
<TE>   It sailed through the euphemistically titled Assembly Governmental
Organization Committee, the panel that considers alcohol, tobacco and
gambling legislation, on an 18-1 vote in April.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson, who chaired the committee before becoming speaker, said
through a spokeswoman that he was not involved in the legislation.
But George Wiley, his former chief consultant on the panel, was
helping shepherd the bill along from Wiley's new job in the speaker's
office. And the idea had national momentum on its side.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks in part to lobbying from liquor wholesalers, 34 states have
passed so-called primary source laws that in practice give a handful
of distributors the rights to market most wines within a state's
borders.</TE>
<TE>   California, in fact, already has such a law pertaining to vodka
and other distilled spirits, as do most other states. As a result,
two large wholesalers, Young's Market Co. and Southern Wine &amp;
Spirits, control the bulk of the state's hard liquor trade.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Southern nor Young's returned calls for this story. Diageo
also did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</TE>
<TE>   By requiring authorized sellers, the laws fortify the three-tiered
system most states promoted or formally adopted after Prohibition to
control alcoholic beverages: Wine and liquor makers sell to
state-licensed distributors, distributors sell to state-licensed
retailers, and retailers sell to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters, primarily wholesalers but also state regulators, say
the system helped rid the industry of organized crime and allowed
states to better police alcohol consumption, as well as collect their
share of excise taxes. But the system has begun to fray in recent
years as new means of distribution--most notably, sales over the
Internet--have given winemakers new ways to peddle their products.</TE>
<TE>   Backers of a primary source law say it would improve the system in
California by providing a clearer audit trail to enforcement
officials. It would also let winemakers decide who will market their
brands in California. That would not only allow them to more easily
recall products if there were health or quality problems, but also
help them to ensure their bottles are handled properly. And it would
help them execute their pricing strategies, supporters say.</TE>
<TE>   Since it targets imports, the proposed law would have little
direct effect on California's bustling winemaking industry.
Nonetheless, it is supported by some state wineries that have
supported similar laws in other states. Although California's small
importers find wines elsewhere and bring them to market in the state
at lower prices than official distributors, those sales often come at
the expense of winemakers, said Mike Felasco of the Wine Institute, a
trade group of small and large wineries that backs Firebaugh's bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it provides the consumer with a great deal," Felasco said,
"But it upsets your relationship with retailers. If you are going to
make these investments, you are going to want control."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the three-tier system call it a relic of a time when
states worried that Al Capone would dominate the alcohol business.
Though it may help states collect taxes and control alcohol, it also
guarantees that middlemen and their profit margins are a part of
every bottle sold, driving up costs for consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of a California primary source law say it would limit
competition by creating near monopolies for a few wholesalers.
Reduced competition, they say, would lead to higher prices and
smaller selections, especially in the old and rare wines that small
importers consider their specialty.</TE>
<TE>   Wine experts such as Sobotka can legally serve as both importer
and distributor in California under the status quo. Because they only
take one cut off the top instead of two, they say they can offer
better prices.</TE>
<TE>   "I call it the wine monopoly and price-fixing bill. That's what
this is about," said Jeff Kavin, the owner of Greenblatt's Deli &amp;
Fine Wine Shop in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Kavin sells a bottle of 1996 Chateau D'Armailhac, which he buys
from a small wholesaler, for $28.95. Southern Wine &amp; Spirits sells
the same wine for $40.75. If he had to buy it from them at that
price, Kavin said, his prices would have to be higher.</TE>
<TE>   To understand the effect of the bill, opponents say, one must
understand the way the gray wine market works.</TE>
<TE>   For a number of reasons, often because there is not enough of the
good stuff to go around, certain foreign winemakers limit allocations
to the United States to far less than consumer demand. In other
cases, a winemaker may have met initial demand, but some outside
factor--a glowing review by Parker is a common culprit--causes a wine
to get hot. Or, perhaps a wine that does not excite customers in
Europe and is sitting in a warehouse in Spain catches on in some
California restaurant, creating a new market.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, opposition to Firebaugh's bill has come not only
from California grocers and importers, but also from Australian
vintners and businessmen in German towns near the Austrian border.</TE>
<TE>   "Worldwide, we have free trade, right? Everybody is in
competition? I think it is a stupid thing," said Michael Unger, the
proprietor of Unger Weine in Aschau, south of Munich. "If I was a
California consumer, I would complain. Merchants always want to have
options, and this is the opposite of that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Opponents were steaming after the Governmental Organization
Committee meeting in April, and not just because of the result.</TE>
<TE>   The chairman of the panel, Assemblyman Jerome Horton
(D-Inglewood), had cut short their testimony, and lawmakers did not
seem interested in hearing their side of the issue. They realized
they needed to play hardball.</TE>
<TE>   Diageo's main lobbyist, John Latimer, is a former policy
consultant to the Governmental Organization Committee who knew
California liquor laws as well as anyone. In response, opponents
hired Doug Elmets, a public relations specialist whose past clients
include the payday loan industry, and Rick Lehman, a former
congressman who runs a lobbying practice in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The Fine Wine Alliance used local merchants and wine traders to
lobby their legislators on the prospective impact of the wine bill on
their businesses.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, they contacted reporters and editorial boards
and pointed to the donations Diageo and the big wholesalers had
lavished on the Legislature in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   One of their biggest beneficiaries was Wesson, who got $84,000
from them since 2000. The money added to the imposing war chest that
helped Wesson become speaker.</TE>
<TE>   Editorials opposing the legislation soon appeared in The Times and
the San Francisco Chronicle. And opponents found allies in Parker and
the Family Winemakers of California, who opposed the bill on grounds
that it would harm the local distributors and retailers they depend
on to sell their brands.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before May 15, the day Firebaugh was supposed to take up
his bill in the Assembly Appropriations Committee, he withdrew it,
surprising opponents, who were braced for a long fight.</TE>
<TE>   But their excitement soon faded into wariness. The entire wine
bill fight had an element of deja vu to it, with good reason. In
1985, the Legislature had passed an almost identical bill, but it was
vetoed by Gov. George Deukmejian, who concluded it would harm
consumers. They vowed to remain vigilant, mindful of the adage that
in Sacramento, no bill ever really dies.</TE>
<TE>   Firebaugh, in turn, was left feeling bitter over the opposition's
tactics, saying they saw links that did not exist among his
legislation, Wesson and the winery fund-raiser. The so-called little
guys, he noted, were hardly living a hand-to-mouth existence, and
turned out with plenty of cash to wage a highly sophisticated David
vs. Goliath campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a political hack job," Firebaugh said.</TE>

<DH>Computers: A U.S. court rejects a law forcing public
libraries to block sexually explicit sites. The government may appeal
the case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's public libraries cannot be forced to filter sexually
explicit Web sites from their computers as a condition of receiving
federal funds, a three-judge panel in Philadelphia ruled Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The decision struck down on free-speech grounds the Children's
Internet Protection Act, a spending measure adopted by Congress two
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The judges, who heard eight days of testimony, concluded that
software programs designed to filter out such material are flawed and
ineffective. Although the law sought to block access to "visual
depictions" of sex, the software scanned for words, not images.
Students researching breast cancer or sexual orientations were
blocked, while some pornography slipped through.</LD>
<TE>   The law "requires [librarians] to violate the 1st Amendment rights
of their patrons," said Chief Judge Edward R. Becker of the U.S. 3rd
Circuit Court of Appeals. "The filtering programs bar access to a
substantial amount of speech on the Internet that is clearly
constitutionally protected for adults and minors."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's ruling marks the third legal setback for those in
Congress who want to shield minors from pornography on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court struck down a sweeping law in 1997 that made it
a crime to put "indecent" material on the Internet. And earlier this
month, it blocked enforcement of a narrower measure that sought to
keep minors away from commercial pornography on the World Wide Web.</TE>
<TE>   While the first two laws sought to regulate computers at home, the
third sought to regulate those in public libraries.</TE>
<TE>   About 10% of the estimated 143 million Americans who use the
Internet rely on libraries for their access, according to some
studies.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's ruling does not say local libraries may not use such
filters, nor does it assert that patrons have a free-speech right to
see pornography on library computers. Rather, it says Congress may
not require libraries to use such filters.</TE>
<TE>   Across the nation, public libraries have adopted a range of
policies to deal with the issue of Internet pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Some use filters on computers that are reserved for children. Some
libraries screen out hard-core sex sites, while still others rely on
what the court called the "tap on the shoulder" approach for patrons
who are ignoring the library's policy on pornography.</TE>
<TE>   "Libraries are locally run, and we encourage them to have
acceptable use policies," said Emily Sheketoff, director of the
American Library Assn.'s Washington office. "These policies are
developed within the community. We objected to the federal government
mandating this censorship policy for every terminal in the library."</TE>
<TE>   In its third attempt at legislation, Congress sought to rely on
the lever of federal money. Most public libraries receive some
federal funds; they also take advantage of government-sponsored
discounts for Internet use. Libraries that refused to install the
software filters on all their computers by July 1 would lose both
forms of aid.</TE>
<TE>   The American Library Assn. and several individual libraries
challenged the law as unconstitutional, and Friday's ruling prevents
it from taking effect.</TE>
<TE>   The court opinion cited key testimony from Stanford University
linguistics professor Geoffrey Nunberg. He tested three filter
software programs and found them wanting.</TE>
<TE>   "In the tests," he said in an interview Friday, "the filters ruled
out a number of useful sex-education sites, among others," including
the home page for the Center for Sex Research at Cal State
Northridge, several Planned Parenthood sites and a French
pharmaceutical site.</TE>
<TE>   Software designed to detect nude images is particularly faulty,
Nunberg said. "The state of image recognition is abominable. Some of
the programs can recognize naked flesh, but can't tell if it's a nude
body or Mark Spitz in a swimsuit. They also routinely pick up
pictures of pigs, tapioca pudding and sand dunes."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Comstock, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said
government lawyers were disappointed in the ruling and will probably
appeal to the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The government may well fare better in the high court. The
justices are more inclined to say government-subsidized speech is not
necessarily free of regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, the court upheld a federal law that required the
National Endowment of the Arts to take into account "general
standards of decency" in awarding grants.</TE>
<TE>   But the justices are often closely split on this 1st Amendment
issue.</TE>
<TE>   A 5-4 ruling in 1991 upheld a federal law that barred doctors in
subsidized clinics from telling their pregnant patients about
abortion. Last year, however, a 5-4 ruling struck down on free-speech
grounds a law that barred government-subsidized lawyers from
challenging welfare reforms.</TE>

<LD>The Internet has become a hotbed for illegal credit card activity.
Thieves use stolen identity information to make online purchases and
open new credit card accounts. Victims are generally not held liable
for fraudulent charges, but do have to cope with the difficulties of
removing them. KAREN KARLITZ spoke with an FBI agent about what's
being done to mitigate this growing problem.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   FRANK HARRILL,</LD>
<TE>   special agent, FBI computer crime squad, Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Internet offers a means of relatively anonymous communication
that provides a conduit for the faceless exchange of stolen credit
card information. This has created a much more conducive environment
for criminals, with the sale of credit card and personal information
taking on an almost marketplace-like atmosphere. It also broadens
criminals' potential market worldwide. People anywhere in the world
can reach out and touch U.S. commerce without ever setting foot in
our country.</TE>
<TE>   There have always been those who could engineer their way into
company records, but what we're seeing now is the ability to steal
entire databases. Never before could someone walk away with all that
information.</TE>
<TE>   Through sophisticated investigative techniques, the FBI is
confronting an old form of crime--fraud--being done in a high-tech
way. Squads specializing in computer crime are now in every FBI field
office. Agents have an in-depth knowledge of computers and operating
systems. They learn to recognize markers that can point to who is
behind a particular event. These markers leave a trail as compelling
as fingerprints, videotape or eyewitness accounts, and we have had
some success in bringing people to justice.</TE>
<TE>   My feeling is that people shouldn't avoid online transactions but
should take steps to lessen the risk of becoming a victim. It starts
with not revealing personal information. Social Security numbers and
dates of birth are the most dangerous to divulge. The confluence of
these two things really defines a person. Of course, there are
legitimate times when this information must be given.</TE>
<TE>   It's a good idea to get a copy of your credit report every year
and account for all activity on the report. For a small fee, these
reports are available from Equifax, (800) 685-1111; Experian, (888)
397-3742, or Transunion, (800) 888-4213.</TE>
<TE>   On a monthly basis, credit card bills should be scrutinized. Keep
in mind that fraudulent charges are not necessarily large amounts.</TE>
<TE>   Another potential source for compromise are preapproved credit
card offers. The checks that come with these offers often fall into
the wrong hands. You can remove yourself from these mailing lists by

<TE>   Protecting yourself online is knowing who you are dealing with.
Stay away from anything that sounds too good to be true, any
solicitation you didn't initiate or any requests for credit card

<HD>The Stay-Over Rule Doesn't Fly</HD>
<DH>Airlines with this asinine provision will be the losers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JO GIESE</AU>
<BD>Jo Giese, a reporter on "Marketplace Radio," is the
author of the forthcoming book "My Doggie Lama."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The airlines got their billion-dollar bailout, and I want mine.</LD>
<LD>   As a frequent flier, I want the airlines to bail me out of their
stupid Saturday night stay-over requirement. Think about it: What
other mass transit people-mover--train, bus, ferry--dictates how
travelers must spend their weekend?</LD>
<LD>   The Saturday night stay-over is bad for business and awful for
families. No matter what shenanigans a company pulls to make an
expense-paid weekend in New Orleans before a company meeting on
Monday sound enticing, employees do not want to be separated from
their families.</LD>
<TE>   I came up against this concrete wall again recently. My radio
series "Breaking the Mold," which is heard on Minnesota Public
Radio's "Marketplace," won the 2002 Exceptional Merit Media Award
from the National Women's Political Caucus. I was invited to the
awards ceremony at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on
May 8, a Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know about you, but I don't win awards every day, so I
wasn't going to miss it. After my news editor said that, because of
lean times, Public Radio wouldn't be footing the bill, I started
scrambling to find tickets for my husband and myself. I discovered
that to accept my award for an exceptional radio story, the price was
also exceptional: Two tickets on American Airlines from L.A. to D.C.
would be $4,600 round trip, and that's economy. A discount broker was
offering American Airlines at $258 per person if we stayed Saturday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "They're still doing that?" my husband asked.</TE>
<TE>   Like millions of airline lemmings, we decided (were forced) to
make a vacation out of it. Except by Thursday I'd had my moment in
the sun, I'd collected my award, we'd cruised the Potomac and we
wanted to go home.</TE>
<TE>   From our hotel in Georgetown, I called Jet Blue, an airline that
10 days earlier had inaugurated its Dulles-Long Beach run. For $238
per person, we flew home on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   A fellow Jet Blue traveler from Los Angeles, a stockbroker and
father of a 4-year-old boy and a 5-year-old daughter, had this to
say: "Sunday is Mother's Day, and I can't stay overnight. My wife and
mother would kill me."</TE>
<TE>   While I was in D.C., I met with Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic
whip. Pelosi said she flew to San Francisco "every single, solitary
week" and spent 25% of her life on planes; at the end of our
interview, I asked how she did it. "Don't get me started on the
airlines," she said. Then the highest-ranking woman in Congress
admitted that she buys double tickets, a method that enables her to
avoid the Saturday stay-over.</TE>
<TE>   I've flown the future, and it's a small airline with no Saturday
night stay-over requirement. The future is also Southwest, the only
airline that announced a profit this year, and it too does not
require a Saturday night stay-over. Even though Jet Blue and
Southwest are expanding into long-haul markets, they don't serve all
the markets.</TE>
<TE>   That still leaves us and our companies hostage to those arbitrary
rules that prevent us from going  home. I propose a stimulus package
to the airlines. Stop bellyaching about business and threatening
bankruptcy: It's the Saturday night stay-over, stupid.</TE>

<HD>Identifying Jesus' Real Words and Deeds, With a New Age
Touch</HD>
<DH>JESUS: WHAT HE REALLY SAID AND DID By Stephen Mitchell;
HarperCollins: $15.95, 146 pps.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to the Book
Review, is the author of, most recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at
God: The Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thomas Jefferson once sat down with a pair of scissors, a pot of glue
and a copy of the King James version of the Bible and produced what
has come to be called "the Jefferson Bible," a cut-and-paste version
of the New Testament that includes only those passages that struck
Jefferson as authentic.</LD>
<LD>   "There is internal evidence that parts [of the Gospels] have
proceeded from an extraordinary man, and that other parts come from
very inferior minds," wrote Jefferson. "It is as easy to separate
those parts as to pick out diamonds from dunghills."</LD>
<LD>   Now Stephen Mitchell, a teacher of spiritual traditions from both
East and West, has undertaken the same audacious task in "Jesus: What
He Really Said and Did," a book written primarily for a teenage
audience. He reports that, unlike Jefferson, he resorted to "the
precision tools of modern scholarship" to distinguish the words and
exploits of the "real" Jesus from those that were added later--but he
also concedes that he relied on his own "spiritual intuition" to
separate the diamonds from the dung.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, even the makers and users of what Mitchell calls the
"precision tools" of modern Bible scholarship are sometimes willing
to admit that the question of "what Jesus really said and did" is
ultimately unanswerable. Ranging from Albert Schweitzer's "The Quest
of the Historical Jesus" to Jack Miles' newly published "Christ: A
Crisis in the Life of God," the search for the "real" Jesus has
produced not a single clear answer but a chorus of contending voices.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell, however, is plainly a conflict avoider, and he is
seeking to open rather than change the minds of his readers. "If
beliefs about Jesus can help make people kinder human beings, I am in
favor of them," he writes at the outset. "My advice to people who
think they may be offended by this book is to close it immediately,
or better yet, don't open it in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell was raised in the Reform movement of Judaism, but he is
an equal-opportunity spiritual seeker. "I love Jesus," he affirms,
"but I love the Buddha just as much, and Lao-tzu, and the wisest men
and women from all the great spiritual traditions." Still, it takes a
certain amount of chutzpah for a Jewish writer, no matter how
deferential, to purge the New Testament of all of its Christian
theology.</TE>
<TE>   Though Mitchell is certainly not the first to do so, he gives us a
Jesus who "didn't intend to begin a new religion," who "never thought
of himself as the Messiah or the son of God" and whose death is
explained as a matter of local politics rather than divine will.
Jesus was surely "one of the greatest spiritual teachers who ever
lived," according to Mitchell, but he was just as surely not the son
of God.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, for example, Mitchell is willing to believe that the
historical Jesus was capable of healing the sick, but he denies that
the cures were miraculous.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, he insists that the power to heal came from the minds and
bodies of those who were healed. "Jesus himself said that he wasn't
the one who was healing people," he writes. "[It] was their own
trust--in God and in themselves--that healed them."</TE>
<TE>   The "heart of Jesus' teaching," according to Mitchell, can be
found in the parable of the prodigal son. When the errant son returns
to his grief-stricken father, and the father says, "This son of mine
was dead, and he has come back to life," argues Mitchell, he was
speaking only about the here and now--and so was Jesus when he told
the tale. A reunion of the father and son, insists Mitchell,
"describes the only kind of resurrection that Jesus ever spoke
about."</TE>
<TE>   "The legend of the resurrection would have surprised Jesus,"
insists Mitchell. "He himself never taught about a resurrection from
the dead, because he wasn't afraid of death.... He trusted God with
all his heart, and he knew that whatever happened had to be good,
because it happened according to the will of a supremely intelligent
and loving presence."</TE>
<TE>   "Jesus" is a reader-friendly volume, short, simple and, at times,
simplistic. Mitchell gives us a child-safe Christ, a Jesus who has
been extracted from the ancient texts in which his words and deeds
have been preserved, however imperfectly, and made over for the New
Age.</TE>
<TE>   There's an irony at work here. Much blood has been spilled over
the centuries by those who claim to know, as Mitchell puts it, what
Jesus really said and did.</TE>
<TE>   The use and abuse of his teachings by true believers of various
persuasions is a subject that ought not to be overlooked if we are
seeking to understand what Jesus has really meant in the lives of
countless millions of men, women and children over the last 2,000
years. A child of 12 need not be troubled with these problems, but
the rest of us surely should be.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Most businesspeople swear by the old saw, "You've got to spend money
to make money." The president and board of directors of the Los
Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau appear to favor a far simpler
dictum: You've got to spend money. Period.</LD>
<LD>   At a request from The Times, the bureau last week released
records, albeit heavily edited, of its spending from 1997 to 2000.
Considering what was left in, it's frightening to imagine what could
have been edited out.</LD>
<LD>   Never mind the $835,000 to treat 3,000 travel agents to a gala
dinner and music by Natalie Cole and her orchestra in Glasgow,
Scotland, $84,000 to host 25 English tour operators at the Wimbledon
tennis tournament and $11,600 to rent a hall in Kensington Palace to
wine and dine airline executives. Each of these soirees needed hosts,
which meant an $854-per-night hotel suite here and a $7,200 airline
ticket there and some high-class parties for bureau President George
Kirkland, bureau board members and officials, city airport
commissioners and lucky Ron Deaton, the city's chief legislative
analyst.</LD>
<TE>   The private, nonprofit bureau is responsible for renting the Los
Angeles Convention Center and promoting regional tourism; for this it
receives almost $18 million in city hotel bed taxes. (The rest of its
$27.9-million budget comes mainly from membership dues.)</TE>
<TE>   What the city gets for its investment, theoretically, is the
"making money" part of the business adage, the part where
conventioneers and tourists come to Los Angeles and spend big on
hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and gewgaws. But the bucks
spent on Glasgow galas and Wimbledon teas--not to mention pricey
hotel rooms and business-class air fare--aren't buying much bang back
in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Even before last year's terrorist attacks knocked the bottom out
of the tourism business, the situation was dismal. With 42 major
conventions canceled over the last three years, the center's exhibit
space and meeting rooms have been as likely to be empty as full. Yet
the bureau paid bonuses to its sales staff and executives even for
bookings that later were canceled. The bureau also has failed in two
of the last three years to reach goals for boosting tourism.</TE>
<TE>   Booking troubles are laid to the lack of hotel rooms within
walking distance of the convention center, a deficit that private
developers have deemed too risky to fill due to the lack of bookings.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council voted last month to fix this chicken-or-egg
problem by setting up a nonprofit corporation to issue tax-exempt
bonds and build a 1,200-room hotel. For the gamble to pay off, the
visitors bureau has to be able to deliver conventions, or the city
should give the contract to some other organization when it expires
in June 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, a certain amount of wining and dining is expected when trying
to attract travelers to Los Angeles. But the bureau has got to spend
money wisely, even if it takes watchful monitoring by the City
Council over the next year. And it's got to make money too.</TE>

<LD>Walt Disney Co.'s bitter court fight over merchandising rights to the
Winnie the Pooh characters is reverberating through the Hundred Acre
Wood, reaching all the way to the cheerful bear who's humming a Good
Hum as he climbs a giant oak tree.</LD>
<LD>   "Isn't it funny how a chairman likes money? Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! I
wonder why he does?"</LD>
<LD>   "It's the shareholders, you bear of very little brain," Owl hooted
derisively. "Nobody wants to be a millionaire, next fall's schedule
couldn't catch a heffalump and the production arm is turning out
stuff that's more prickly than a gorse bush during a Santa Ana. We're
talking several hundred million money pots if this suit goes to trial
and we lose."</LD>
<TE>   Pooh, meanwhile, continued his hum: "It's very, very funny, 'Cos I
know we had some money; 'Cos it had a label on, saying 'Money.'"</TE>
<TE>   "You can bet your busted balloon," Eeyore brayed. "This story line
would be rather gray and gloomy without the Grand Idea of adding
lunch boxes, pajamas, video games and movies. It would be a rather
boggy and sad place."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh the Fox Network it is thriving, the Peacock is highflying and
Must See still defines prime time. And everybody knows, (tiddely
pom), how slow the profits (tiddely pom) are growing."</TE>
<TE>   "This is all very reminiscent of the time greedy Pooh got stuck in
my front door after too many mugs of condensed milk and honey,"
Rabbit said.</TE>
<TE>   "A little something to sweeten the day is perfectly fine, but one
must be careful of potentially sticky situations."</TE>
<TE>   So they went off together to Disneyland, following in Shaq's
considerable footsteps and mindful of Nancy Kerrigan's cautions. But
wherever they go, and whatever happens to them on the way, the little
boy and his Bear will strive to keep shareholders in mind. After all,
what good is a Forest where a little boy and his Bear are simply
playing?</TE>

<LD>The stock market long has been a game of knowing when to hold and
when to fold. The post-Enron surge in shareholder activism brings
another option--fighting against self-serving management proposals
that do not put investors' interests first.</LD>
<LD>   Investor activism clearly is being stoked by two years of a bear
market and the reality that it's no longer easy to dump troubled
shares and shift investment dollars to greener pastures.</LD>
<LD>   It's also being driven by the California Public Employees'
Retirement System and other big institutional investors that
corporate boards ignore at their own peril.</LD>
<TE>   The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Assn.-College Retirement
Equities Fund, a pension fund for educational and research
institutions, in the last year has submitted 13 resolutions that call
for shareholder approval of executive compensation packages. The fund
also wants corporations to adopt measures that would safeguard the
independence of accounting firms that conduct financial audits.</TE>
<TE>   The activists are gaining ground after years of being brushed
aside by boards of directors following agendas set by corporate
executives. Shareholder resolutions used to get soundly trounced--or
management simply refused to place initiatives on ballots. But during
the last year, 39% of shareholder resolutions dealing with stock
option plans, accounting concerns and other corporate governance
issues won majority votes, according to the Investor Responsibility
Research Center in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The wave of activism should lead to related reforms. The
Securities and Exchange Commission should start by prohibiting
corporations from categorizing executive compensation packages as
"ordinary business" instead of a "significant policy issue." It's an
important distinction because executives are using the designation to
stymie shareholder votes.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate boards are free to ignore shareholder resolutions
because they're nonbinding. Publicity generated by shareholder
victories sometimes forces embarrassed managers into action. But
stock exchanges could also require companies that trade on their
exchanges to abide by resolutions that repeatedly win shareholder
support.</TE>
<TE>   Going up against management often is an expensive and
time-consuming process, but persistence pays off.</TE>
<TE>   After almost a decade of fighting, shareholders of ICN
Pharmaceuticals on May 29 secured a board majority that probably will
end the reign of Chief Executive Milan Panic. The bitter fight to
oust a company founder who survived government investigations, sexual
harassment accusations and a wave of investor complaints is a good
example of shareholder rights in action.</TE>

<LD>The party that governed Algeria for nearly 30 years before the
introduction of a multiparty system swept legislative elections that
were marred by violence, a boycott and the lowest turnout ever: 46%.</LD>
<LD>   The National Liberation Front, led by Prime Minister Ali Benflis,
more than tripled its number of seats in the 389-seat parliament,
from 64 to 199 seats, officials announced.</LD>
<LD>   But the election was boycotted by key opposition parties and
marred by unrest among the country's sizable Berber minority.</LD>
<TE>   Hours before the vote, suspected Islamic extremists massacred 25
nomads in a village west of Algiers.</TE>

<LD>The Yugoslav parliament voted overwhelmingly for a plan to abolish
the Balkan federation and replace it with a looser union between its
two remaining members, Serbia and Montenegro.</LD>
<LD>   The move clears the way for experts to flesh out a new
constitution from the blueprint. The West is keen to head off a
Montenegrin drive for independence, which it fears would destabilize
a region that saw a decade of bloodshed when the six republics that
then made up Yugoslavia began to break apart in 1991.</LD>

peace.</LD>
<LD>   The failure of negotiations with the National Liberation Army, or
ELN, follows February's end of talks with a larger rebel group, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and dashes any hope
Pastrana had of negotiating peace deals as promised when he was
elected in 1998. His term ends in August.</LD>

<DH>Diplomacy: Hardened stances of both Sharon and Arafat leave
Washington envoy little maneuvering room in planning a peace forum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>JERUSALEM -- With Israeli troops back in the West Bank city of Nablus
and security forces on high alert for more suicide attacks, neither
Israelis nor Palestinians held out much hope Friday that the Bush
administration's latest peacemaking effort will produce a
breakthrough.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told U.S. envoy William Burns
here that the Palestinians will have to end all violence and
incitement and carry out top-to-bottom reforms of their government
and security services before the Israelis will negotiate with them.</LD>
<LD>   For his part, Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat said
Israel's raid into Nablus and the neighboring Balata refugee camp,
where troops detained hundreds of Palestinians, was "as if they are
saying to the world that we do not want to reach any agreement."</LD>
<TE>   The entrenched positions of both leaders leave Burns, who arrived
Thursday, with little maneuvering room as he looks for enough common
ground to put together an international peace conference. That
proposed gathering, already delayed at least until late summer, has
drawn only lukewarm support from Arab states and Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The reality on the ground is that the Israelis continue to make
near-daily incursions into Palestinian-controlled areas in pursuit of
militants, and Palestinians continue to launch near-daily attacks
both inside Israel's pre-1967 borders and in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Sharon is being pushed by right-wing members of his government
to launch a massive military assault on Palestinian areas or even
expel Arafat if there is another large-scale attack on Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   There have been several close calls in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   Early Friday, a lone Palestinian gunman broke into Shavei Shomron,
a Jewish settlement near Nablus. He planted a bomb on the basketball
court, then threw two grenades at a kindergarten and raked it with
gunfire shortly after the pupils had gone inside to start their day,
the police reported. At least one bullet pierced a window, but no one
was injured in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman then walked toward the settlement's grocery store,
where he was spotted by the owner, David Elbaz.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard gunshots. Then I came across the terrorist. He shot at
me, and so I shot back," Elbaz told Israel Television. "I hit him in
the chest. I walked around him. I came from his back when he wasn't
expecting and continued to shoot at him, and he was eliminated."</TE>
<TE>   It was the second attack on a Jewish settlement in the West Bank
this week. On Tuesday, a Palestinian gunman shot and killed three
Israeli teenagers in the settlement of Itamar, also near Nablus.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks, coupled with reports from the police and the army
that they have thwarted several planned assaults and expect more,
have deepened the sense of crisis here.</TE>
<TE>   Israelis were further shaken by the revelation Thursday that an
Israeli had been arrested on suspicion of helping her husband, a
Palestinian resident of Jerusalem, drive a pair of suicide bombers to
the Israeli city of Rishon Le Zion last week to carry out an attack.
One bomber, a woman, had second thoughts and backed out of the
attack. She was later arrested. The other attacker set off a blast at
a pedestrian mall frequented by Russian immigrants, killing himself
and two other people.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli newspapers ran front-page stories Friday on the
allegations against the woman, who was identified as a 26-year-old
immigrant from the former Soviet Union, Marina Pinsky, and her
33-year-old husband, Ibrahim Sarachne. Pinsky reportedly told her
interrogators that she knew only after the fact that the Palestinians
intended to carry out bombings.</TE>
<TE>   The couple had lived in the Dahaisha refugee camp, near Bethlehem,
with Sarachne's family. On Friday, family members said he was married
to a Muslim woman and had five children with her before taking Pinsky
as his second wife. The couple have one daughter.</TE>
<TE>   His brother, Moussa, told The Times that Ibrahim Sarachne was a
car thief. Other sources inside the camp also said he was a car
thief, and one whom other Palestinians suspected of collaborating
with the Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   One senior Palestinian source, speaking on condition that he not
be named, said Ibrahim Sarachne had agreed to help militants carry
out the Rishon Le Zion bombing in an effort to clear his name.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian vigilantes have killed dozens of suspected
collaborators since the current fighting erupted in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The army says it is sending troops and tanks into Palestinian
towns in an effort to thwart more of the kind of bombings that have
had such a devastating impact on the lives of Israelis. Only hours
after troops ended a five-day reoccupation of Bethlehem on Thursday,
tanks and troops entered Nablus and Balata, a militant stronghold.
Nablus was the site of heavy fighting in April.</TE>
<TE>   Hussam Khader, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council and
leader of Balata, said the incursion began shortly before midnight.
Israeli forces ordered many residents out of their homes and
conducted searches, smashing the connecting walls between at least
half a dozen houses, camp residents said. Soldiers ordered all males
between the ages of 14 and 50 into an open area, Khader said.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli army spokesman confirmed Friday night that hundreds of
men were detained for questioning. At least 20 wanted men among them
were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Tanks were still on the streets of Nablus late Friday, and the
town was under military curfew. There were no reports of casualties.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very difficult to capture [suicide bombers] at the entrance
to [Israeli] cities, buses and restaurants and easier to catch them
at their point of departure," army spokesman Brig. Gen. Ron Kitrey
told Israel's Army Radio.</TE>

<HD>Rights Group Blames Ruling Party for 1997 Kenyan Violence</HD>
<DH>Africa: Watchdog's report compares the tactics used before
the presidential vote to those employed in Rwanda. It warns of more
trouble in elections later this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>President Daniel Arap Moi's party hired armed thugs to attack and
intimidate likely opposition supporters during the 1997 election,
according to an international human rights group, which warned Friday
that similar violence could be fomented before new balloting later
this year.</LD>
<LD>   The attacks in Coast province, near the ancient port city of
Mombasa, claimed the lives of an estimated 100 Kenyans. More than
100,000 others were forced to flee their homes.</LD>
<LD>   No one was prosecuted for organizing the attacks, despite hundreds
of arrests and a government-sponsored commission of inquiry. But in a
119-page report released here Friday, Human Rights Watch laid the
blame on Moi's Kenya African National Union party for instigating the
violence.</LD>
<TE>   Researchers said they interviewed so-called hired raiders who
recounted how they received weapons and other support from the party.</TE>
<TE>   "This report is meant to sound a warning," said Lisa Misol, the
Human Rights Watch official who wrote the study. "This is an
important time as Kenya gears up for the next general election."</TE>
<TE>   Officials of KANU, which has ruled this East African nation since
independence from Britain in 1963, have consistently denied any
involvement in the violence. A top party official said Friday that
the ruling party has no intention of stirring up ethnic rivalries
during the forthcoming election, expected in December. Moi is
required by law to step down then after 24 years in office.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials and many human rights groups said they will closely
monitor the election, particularly because Kenya is often perceived
as a bastion of stability in a region fraught with conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Human Rights Watch said that, to maintain their grip on power in
1997, Kenya's leaders resorted to pitting ethnic groups against one
another. The report compared such tactics to ones used in Rwanda in
1994, when elite ethnic Hutus directed the massacre of more than
800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</TE>
<TE>   "The methods employed in Rwanda's genocide were replicated on a
much smaller but still deadly scale in Kenya," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Misol said Moi's party masterminded the violence in Coast province
to drive opposition supporters out of the area so it could win back
seats in parliament it had lost five years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   KANU leaders hired and armed unemployed young men from the
indigenous Digo group, who blamed their lack of jobs, land and
educational opportunities on migrants from the country's interior,
Misol said. The coastal residents historically have backed KANU while
the citizens from the interior tend to favor the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   The raiders told researchers how they were recruited and trained
by fighters hired by KANU. Apart from attacking innocent civilians,
the raiders waged a terror campaign through handwritten pamphlets
calling for coastal Kenyans to chase away outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   After the opposition voters fled their homes, KANU won an
overwhelming number of seats in the region. Moi, who needed at least
25% of the presidential vote in Coast to win reelection, handily
carried the province.</TE>
<TE>   KANU, Misol said, had simply dusted off tactics used in Rift
Valley province before the 1992 presidential vote, when opposition
supporters from the Kikuyu, Luhya and Luo ethnic groups were attacked
in Moi's home province by members of the president's Kalenjin group.
About 1,500 people were killed and 250,000 forced to flee.</TE>
<TE>   Misol said the raiders who agreed to be interviewed by Human
Rights Watch reported that KANU officials didn't keep their promises
to give them land and other rewards.</TE>
<TE>   Misol said the widespread availability of guns in Kenya--which is
already beset by ethnic divisions, a rickety economy and rampant
corruption--could fuel renewed violence during the next elections.</TE>
<TE>   Guns from conflict-ridden neighbors--such as Sudan, Somalia and
Congo--are spilling into Kenya, mainly in the northern and western
areas of the country, the report said. The growing number of guns has
led to increased crime.</TE>
<TE>   Misol said Western countries that provide aid to Kenya should

<HD>Afghans Killed in U.S. Attack</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Forces led by Americans mistakenly fire on local
soldiers in a failed Al Qaeda sting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Three Afghan soldiers were killed and two wounded Friday by U.S.-led
allies in a botched operation at what was expected to be a meeting of
Al Qaeda operatives near the city of Gardez, U.S. military officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   The debacle occurred after U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers
accompanied by Afghan fighters apparently stumbled onto a separate
Afghan unit conducting a simultaneous operation at the village, said
Col. Roger King, an Army spokesman for coalition forces.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S.-led contingent opened fire on the Afghans after
apparently mistaking them for the enemy in the predawn darkness, King
said.</LD>
<TE>   The American-led group "had no way of knowing" that the Afghan
unit was going to be there, the colonel said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident is under investigation, and the coalition will seek
to take immediate steps to improve communication among various Afghan
components, King said.</TE>
<TE>   "Coordination measures will be taken," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident unfolded as the U.S.-led force approached a compound
in the village of Khomar Kalay, where intelligence indicated that Al
Qaeda operatives planned to meet. The military contingent, which
consisted of as many as 20 Special Forces soldiers and more than 80
Afghan fighters, was planning to take up blocking positions around
the site and capture meeting participants as they left the compound.</TE>
<TE>   As the American-led forces approached in vehicles, Special Forces
soldiers observed activity inside the compound. Several armed men
emerged from the site and appeared to be taking up defensive
positions, King said.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, 10 to 12 men rushed out of the compound in what was
perceived by American commanders as a hostile, flanking maneuver.</TE>
<TE>   When the leader of the operation saw one of the Afghans appear to
take aim at the American-led fighters with a rocket-propelled
grenade, he ordered his unit to open fire. Within minutes, three
Afghans were dead and two injured. Seventeen others laid down their
weapons and surrendered, King said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no way of knowing they were there," King said, explaining
that there is no regular communication between various elements of
the Afghan army and coalition forces.</TE>
<TE>   As of late Friday, the injured Afghans were being treated at a
hospital at Bagram air base, about 30 miles north of the capital,
Kabul. Bagram is the headquarters of coalition forces in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The unharmed Afghans were released.</TE>
<TE>   King said the Afghan unit appeared to be from Lowgar province,
just north of Gardez, but he did not know whether it was affiliated
with a particular local government or warlord. The Afghans indicated
that they also were pursuing Al Qaeda members at the site.</TE>
<TE>   King acknowledged that the U.S. and Afghan soldiers did not
identify themselves as they approached, but he defended their
decision to open fire. The men at the compound "were armed and moving
in the direction of our forces," he said. "That is considered hostile
intent."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether it would make sense for coalition forces to identify
themselves in such situations, King replied: "It would make sense
until the first person got shot for stopping and giving a warning."</TE>

<HD>Japan and South Korea Make an Oddly Sporting Pair</HD>
<DH>Asia: Rivals and unlikely co-hosts find a cultural bridge
in the international soccer championships.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Screams echo off the cold stone walls of a basement torture chamber
where a snarling Japanese soldier flogs the blood-soaked back of a
Korean freedom fighter.</LD>
<LD>   "Confess!" hisses the soldier as the Korean moans in anguish.</LD>
<LD>   The scene plays out at a former Japanese prison here, now a museum
dedicated to victims of Japan's 1910-45 occupation of the Korean
peninsula. Of course, the victims, their tormentors and even the
blood at the popular tourist attraction are made of wax, and the
dialogue is recorded, but at times the emotions seem all too real.</LD>
<TE>   Many South Koreans resent that Japan has not done more to make
amends for its brutal occupation, while many Japanese still look down
on their former colonial subjects.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Japan and South Korea are co-hosting the World Cup soccer
championship, however, both will need to make an effort to ensure
that any such discordant notes do not ruin the festivities. The
games, which opened here Friday and close June 30 in Yokohama, Japan,
will be a monthlong test for the sometimes unneighborly neighbors to
prove that they can live up to the 21st century spirit of
globalization.</TE>
<TE>   With the games broadcast around the world and expected to attract
a viewing audience larger than that for the Olympics, Japan and South
Korea must be on their best behavior--a little like contestants on
reality television locked in a room and forced to get along.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, in 1996 it was viewed as almost a sick joke when the
World Cup organizing committee compromised between competing bids
from Japan and South Korea by picking both, resulting in the first
co-hosted World Cup as well as the first to be held in Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer is widely considered one of the most nationalist of sports,
and the pundits foresaw dire consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "World Cup Pairing a Recipe for Disaster!" warned the Australian
Financial Review, with the newspaper noting that for people who
"spent most of the last 1,000 years on the battlefield cutting each
other's heads off ... [to be] forced to wear the same soccer jersey
to host the World Cup is bizarre even amid the vagaries of the
politics of international sports."</TE>
<TE>   Yet many South Koreans and Japanese believe that this challenge
will be good for both countries, forcing them to confront the past. A
poll by Japan's Kyodo News and South Korea's Yonhap agency found that
75% of Japanese respondents and 61% of those from South Korea believe
that the World Cup will improve bilateral relations.</TE>
<TE>   Even at the Sodaemun Prison History Museum, it was hard to find
anybody this week with a cross word to say about the games.</TE>
<TE>   "The World Cup will do good for both countries," said Lee Soo Man,
74, a retired South Korean businessman, as he eyed the graphic
exhibits of Japanese brutality. "Globalization is a world trend. We
can't get along by ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   The two countries, which have spent an estimated $8 billion on
stadiums, infrastructure and other items, have an enormous stake in
ensuring that the ghosts of history do not interfere with the show.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's opening spectacle in Seoul was designed around the motif
of unity and harmony, with South Korean President Kim Dae Jung going
out of his way to play the gallant host to Japanese Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi and Prince Takamado, a cousin of Japan's emperor.</TE>
<TE>   "This World Cup will provide new momentum for Korea-Japan
relations," Kim said Thursday while welcoming Takamado at the
presidential residence here. "No country can be successful if it only
clings to the past without making progress."</TE>
<TE>   The prince is making the first official visit to South Korea by a
member of the Japanese imperial family since World War II. Although a
proposal for Emperor Akihito to attend was shelved for fear it would
be incendiary to some elderly South Koreans, the World Cup has
prompted a flurry of other official visits and exchanges that would
have been unthinkable a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   It was notable that at the opening ceremony, the World Cup theme,
"Let's Get Together Now," was sung in the languages of both hosts;
South Korean law still limits the playing of some Japanese- language
pop songs, as well as Japanese computer games and some films.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of cultural exchanges between South Korea and Japan have
been taking place in conjunction with the World Cup: art exhibits,
musicals, theater performances, tree-planting ceremonies. In Osaka,
Japan, the entire contents of a Korean family's apartment, down to
the toilet paper, were put on display for an exhibit titled "Seoul
Lifestyle 2002." A corresponding exhibit--"Japan, Our Close
Neighbor"--ran earlier this year at South Korea's National Folk
Museum.</TE>
<TE>   In the neighborly spirit leading up to the World Cup, the two
nations signed an extradition treaty--Japan's only other such pact is
with the United States--and agreed to work on system standards for
mobile telephones.</TE>
<TE>   And in a bombshell, the Japanese emperor announced at a news
conference in December, at the time of his birthday, that he "feels a
certain kinship with Korea," in effect acknowledging that the
imperial family is probably descended from Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the dire predictions, there have been remarkably few
public hitches in the organizing of events. True, there were
squabbles over whether this was the "Korea/Japan World Cup" or the
"Japan/Korea World Cup" (it is officially the former because the
opening was here) and over whether various promotions looked too
Korean or too Japanese. But the disagreements were quickly swept
under the rug.</TE>
<TE>   After South Koreans complained about a travel story in the
English-language Japan Times last month that referred to prostitution
and pollution in Seoul, the article was promptly removed from the
newspaper's Web site and a front-page apology was issued.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the two counties have dealt with some of the minor
irritants was handled pretty maturely," said Munehiko Harada, a
professor of sports management at Osaka University of Health and
Sports Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   "That said, once the gate has opened with this World Cup, it's
possible that it could slam shut again," Harada said.</TE>
<TE>   There are looming issues that might be hushed up during the games
but not disappear.</TE>
<TE>   South Koreans are still furious over the publication in Japan last
year of a school textbook they believe glosses over human rights
abuses by Japan during the occupation.</TE>
<TE>   During the war, hundreds of thousands of Korean men were forced to
work in mines and factories, while young women were sent to "comfort
stations" to be used as sexual slaves by Japanese soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "Sports is one thing, but there are issues that are entirely
separate and will not go away. After World Cup fever dies down, we
will still have to deal with the textbooks," said Cho Kwang, a
historian at Korea University who is a member of a joint
Japanese-Korean committee that deals with disputes over wartime
history.</TE>
<TE>   Also unresolved are the issues relating to the former "comfort
women," who feel they have never received an adequate apology or
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Every Wednesday, some of the elderly women hold a vigil outside
the Japanese Embassy here in protest that their concerns will be
swept away in the pursuit of better relations.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, about the same time that Takamado was getting a VIP
reception upon his arrival at Inchon International Airport, one of
the elderly protesters collapsed in a heap of anguish outside the
embassy, screaming: "Kill all the Japanese! You should compensate me
for my youth!"</TE>
<TE>   Another former comfort woman participating in the protest, Kim
Soon Dok, 82, said she believed that the question of compensation and
an apology should have been resolved before the World Cup. But she
added quickly that she intended to watch the games on television.</TE>
<TE>   "I have mixed feelings about the Japanese," she said, "but the
World Cup must be completely successful. It is a good thing. I won't
miss a game."</TE>

<HD>Sept. 11 Probe Spotlight Is on Yemeni</HD>
<DH>Suspect: Man on tape seems to have anticipated events. But
officials don't even know if he's alive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BRUSSELS</DL>
<LD>A Yemeni has become the target of terrorism investigators on three
continents because his wiretapped comments 13 months before Sept. 11
about aerial attacks could have been references to the U.S. hijack
plot, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect, Abdulsalam Ali Ali Abdulrahman, remains mysterious,
as do conversations taped by Italian police in August 2000 and early
2001 that alluded to airports, airplanes and attacks that would make
history.</LD>
<LD>   Italian and U.S. investigators are working together to determine
whether the suspects whose meandering conversations were overheard
had advance knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks, according to Italian
officials.</LD>
<TE>   "We are asking the Americans what information they may have, their
analysis," said an Italian intelligence official who cautioned that
the wiretap transcripts are inconclusive. "Is Abdulrahman alive?
Where is he? Who is he?"</TE>
<TE>   Based on Egyptian intelligence information, Italian investigators
allege that Abdulrahman, 42, had ties to Al Qaeda while acting as a
"section chief" of a Yemeni intelligence service and carrying a
diplomatic passport.</TE>
<TE>   A Yemeni government source confirmed in a telephone interview that
Abdulrahman traveled on a diplomatic passport, but he said he did not
appear to be a government official.</TE>
<TE>   "From what we've found, he was not a member of the political
security service," said the Yemeni official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. "It's not hard for businessmen or VIPs to get
diplomatic passports here. He may have been an informant.... The
police are looking for him as a result of this news. There is a big
investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Yemen, a country struggling with lawlessness and Islamic
extremism, is the birthplace of Osama bin Laden's father. A suspected
Al Qaeda bombing killed 17 Americans aboard the destroyer Cole in
Aden, Yemen, in October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Finding Abdulrahman and learning more about him would help
determine whether the Italian intercepts are a piece of the Sept. 11
puzzle. The transcript in a May 15 prosecutor's report obtained by
The Times is part of a case in which police wiretapped apartments,
cars and cell phones and recorded countless hours of shoptalk by
suspected terrorists about fake documents, holy war and the glories
of martyrdom.</TE>
<TE>   Abdulrahman appeared to predict the use of airplanes as weapons
against the United States, to the delight of his associate, an
Egyptian terrorism suspect named Abdelkader Mahmoud Es Sayed, the
imam of a mosque in Milan, Italy. Es Sayed allegedly headed an Al
Qaeda cell that provided logistical support and helped recruits
travel to training camps in Afghanistan. He is believed to have died
in last year's U.S. airstrikes in that country.</TE>
<TE>   Just after Abdulrahman predicted destruction that would be
"written about by all the newspapers of the world," Es Sayed asked
about Bin Laden, according to the transcript.</TE>
<TE>   "Is Abdullah being hunted?" Es Sayed said, using what Italian
investigators say is a common alias for Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, but they won't do anything to him," Abdulrahman responded.
"Even if there's a diplomatic agreement between the Americans and the
Yemenites, they greatly underestimate our strength."</TE>
<TE>   Italian officials allege that Abdulrahman provided fraudulent
documents and airline tickets to Islamic extremists in Europe,
particularly Switzerland. His brother Nabil Ali al Hela was arrested
in 1998 in connection with a terrorist act the previous year in
Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the taped conversation, in August 2000,
Hamburg-based Ramzi Binalshibh--another Yemeni, who is a former
roommate and accused co-conspirator of suspected Sept. 11 plot leader
Mohamed Atta--was temporarily back in Yemen. He had been in Germany
until late July.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh wired money from Yemen to hijackers studying at a
Florida flight school Aug. 14, according to U.S. court documents. On
Sept. 15, he made an application from Yemen for a visa to attend
flight school in the United States, according to the documents. It
was the third of four unsuccessful visa applications he made, the
last of which was on Oct. 25, 2000, according to the documents.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are not aware of ties between Binalshibh and
Abdulrahman, according to Italian and Yemeni officials. And
investigators have not identified the men discussed by Es Sayed and a
Tunisian suspect on Jan. 24, 2001, when they mentioned a top-secret
matter involving fraudulent documents for "the brothers going to
America."</TE>
<TE>   The 19 hijackers in the Sept. 11 plot used their real identities
and had little known contact with members of Al Qaeda cells in
Europe. But Italian officials said it is possible that the documents
were meant for other, unknown conspirators.</TE>
<TE>   There are suspicions that the hijackers had accomplices in the
United States. In a telephone call intercepted by German
investigators within 24 hours of the World Trade Center attacks, a
suspect referred to "30 people traveling for the operation."</TE>
<TE>   Es Sayed allegedly had contacts in Bin Laden's inner circle, made
up mostly of Egyptians. He came to Italy in 1997 and was granted
asylum despite a conviction in Egypt for the murders of tourists at
Luxor. The wiretaps revealed that Es Sayed communicated from Italy
with Abu Zubeida, Al Qaeda's chief of foreign operations, according
to Italian intelligence officials. Abu Zubeida, who operated from
Afghanistan, was arrested in Pakistan in March.</TE>
<TE>   According to the transcripts, Es Sayed regaled his accomplices
with an account of a meeting with "the emir"--Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "To see the emir, you have so many roads to cross and so many
groups to go through," he told an associate on Dec. 7, 2000. "Before
I had a meeting with him, I had to be sworn in to different groups, I
had to be assigned to different training camps."</TE>
<TE>   Asked what impression Bin Laden made on him, Es Sayed answered
reverently, "It's a sensation I cannot describe; pray with me."</TE>
<TE>   The possible references to Sept. 11 came to the attention of
Italian and U.S. investigators only in recent weeks, according to
officials in both countries. During the peak of the Milan
investigation, in 2000 and early 2001, translators concentrated on
concrete evidence of crimes, especially document fraud, the Italian
intelligence official said. Vaguer passages were summarized and left
for later translation.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, Italian officials reviewed and translated the
remaining material, and they informed the FBI in recent weeks of the
potential links to Sept. 11, the Italian official said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the FBI nor the CIA has yet obtained a copy of the Italian
wiretaps or a complete translation, said a U.S. official in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The official added that U.S. counter-terrorism analysts could not
yet determine whether the tapes have any bearing on the Sept. 11
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents working with Italian counterparts had reported to FBI
headquarters in Washington, as well as to the CIA, the "gist and
synopses of what they were told was on the tapes" shortly after the
recordings were made in 2000 and 2001, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI was aware simultaneously of the transcripts and may have
assisted in preparing general summaries, but they didn't have
complete transcripts at the time," the official said. "And nothing
they got had any reference to airplanes, airports or any of the
language that people are seeing now."</TE>

<LD>"Line Up Here, Captain" (editorial, May 25) suggests that airline
pilots are asking for special treatment at airport security
checkpoints. I would suggest that pilots are simply asking for common
sense. For example, what does The Times think has been accomplished
by sending the pilot through the security check and confiscating his
or her nail clippers? Just 90 minutes later that same pilot will have
access to a crash ax and be at the controls of a 450,000-pound
aircraft. Now do you feel secure?</LD>
<LD>   It is time to advocate a system that uses our limited security
resources wisely and focuses on passengers who represent a real
threat. It is this type of system that would truly add to passenger
confidence and security.</LD>

<TE>   The real question is why are pilots screened at all? Isn't the
purpose of security screening to protect cockpits and pilots from
passengers?</TE>
<TE>   The pilots are going into the cockpit, where they will lock
themselves in. They have full access to the controls of the airplane.
Any pilot wanting to hijack his own airplane needs no weapon to do
it, because he's already where he needs to be. And make no mistake, a
pilot wanting to create a huge fireball at the end of the runway can
do so on any takeoff, even if others in the cockpit try to resist.</TE>
<TE>   Frankly, the last thing I want on an airliner is an angry pilot
who has just been hassled in a security line. Leave the pilots alone.
Preventing terrorism should occur at the borders, not at the
airports.</TE>

<TE>   Your editorial is in error when it states: "Everybody--repeat,
everybody--goes through the same security checkpoints." Nothing can
be further from the truth. Most major airports have many employees,
from managers and supervisors to baggage handlers, who bypass
security every time they go to work. Crew members, both pilots and
flight attendants, are required to go through security.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officers can bypass security carrying firearms on
flights. I am not just talking about air marshals and FBI agents;
postal inspectors, forest service rangers or a sheriff from Montana
all can carry weapons on flights, but the captain cannot carry a pair
of toenail clippers.</TE>
<TE>   As an airline pilot I appreciate the efforts made, and I realize
that security is necessary and very complicated to implement, but
somewhere between the intent and the implementation some common sense
has been lost. Checking everyone would be fine, but that is not and
has never been the case.</TE>

<TE>   We entrust our lives to the airline pilot, taking advantage of all

<TE>   Re "Pilots Ramp Up Campaign to Allow Guns in Cockpit," May 27:
Flying is already a tension-packed task without adding shotgun-riding
to the job description. Police are forever on edge about any minute's
split-second decision to squeeze the trigger, lest they or another
innocent person suffer. It's the police person's lot, so he or she
keeps alert. Yet there's a fuss when a person is hurt by law
enforcement and, of course, beware any deep-pockets situations in the
wings.</TE>
<TE>   If pilots are known to be armed, they'll be targeted first in the
event of a hijacking, thus putting the plane at grave risk regardless
of the subsequent intent of the criminals.</TE>
<TE>   It's better to use strong, secure cockpit doors and, with or
without air marshals, arm all of the cabin crew with nonlethal
weapons.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Your May 25 editorial about Sen. Barbara Boxer's proposed California
Wild Heritage Wilderness Act is a valid assessment of the need for
wilderness. Unfortunately it didn't go very deep. The enemy of
wilderness is the population explosion that has been tearing the
planet asunder for many years.</LD>
<LD>   Californians must demand that our government curb both legal and
illegal immigration. We also must increase efforts at more-effective
contraception and provide the same to developing countries throughout
the world. It is not a solution to their overpopulation problems to
admit them here to continue to increase at the expense of American
workers and our environment. Stabilizing our population is the first
step in conserving wilderness, and our future.</LD>

<TE>   Your editorial doesn't give a true perspective on what the
wilderness designations mean. Your claim that "wilderness allows
humans to enjoy the land with minimal impact" is true for only the
most hardy of individuals. Most people aren't aware that wilderness
means exclusion. Only hikers and horseback riders can enter a
wilderness, with what food they can carry with them.</TE>
<TE>   Wilderness is a designation that discriminates against the very
young, the elderly and the handicapped. Existing roads are destroyed
at taxpayers' expense in a designated wilderness. Who really benefits
from land set aside so that no one will ever be allowed to visit it?</TE>
<TE>   Richard Proctor</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   California's ever-shrinking wilderness is important not only to
the people who like to use these areas for recreation but also for
the local communities. Campers, hikers and skiers often spend money
in nearby towns, buying lunch or supplies, or sleeping at the local
inn. Many of these communities rely on business from visitors in
order to maintain their economies.</TE>
<TE>   When a logging or mining company clear-cuts the land, it provides
jobs only for a limited time. The land is stripped of economic value,
and the local communities are left high and dry. These companies want
the resources from our local wilderness areas because it is more
economical for them, but maintaining our wilderness is the most
economical thing for California's populace.</TE>
<TE>   If we can pass the California Wild Heritage Wilderness Act, it
will not only save forests and mountains, it will save jobs.</TE>

<LD>Ron Kaye, managing editor of the Daily News, was a journalistic
"watchdog" long before there ever was a Valley secession movement
("Daily News Becomes a Herald of Secession," May 30). How about a few
words--in this story, not the next one--about The Times' financial
stake in opposing secession?</LD>
<LD>   As a former Daily News reporter, I would like to note for the
record that the paper's editing style has changed little in the last
decade, with the exception of today's more sensational headlines. It
has absolutely nothing to do with secession. The notion that there
would be no secession movement without Kaye is just too ludicrous to
include in a news story.</LD>

Times is that it seems a little too cozy with the downtown political

<HD>The World Is Awash in Grain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "There's a Bone to Pick With Meat Eaters," Commentary, May 27:
Jeremy Rifkin has been making predictions for a very long time. I
suspect that his intentions are honorable. However, he is usually
wrong with his predictions and his ultimate conclusions. His
commentary, which connects the degree of meat consumption and world
hunger, has no basis.</LD>
<LD>   During the Soviet era, as much as 40% of all the USSR's grain
production was lost to spoilage, poor harvesting techniques, lack of
storage and transportation infrastructure flaws. The world is awash
with excess grain production today; "U.S. Exports Misery to Africa
With Farm Bill" (May 27) clearly articulates the matter. Grain
production surpluses are creating a real problem in the global
capitalistic systems. We don't know what to do with the excesses.
Producer hardships are a real problem. The world has had excess grain
surpluses for a very long time. Surpluses simply won't go away.</LD>
<TE>   Rifkin is correct in stating that the overconsumption of food and
animals (meat) is causing a real health concern in America and other
developed countries. The fast-food eating trends will cause
immeasurable health concerns over time. That has literally nothing to
do with starvation in other parts of the world. If all of Earth's
humanity became vegetarians, the same number of people would be
hungry. It is the forms of government. It is corruption. It isn't
even the economy, stupid!</TE>
<TE>   With a world that currently has the largest excess food supply in
all of human history, Rifkin's intentions are still honorable. His
conclusions are still off the mark. We are drowning in food. We can't
give it away. Our farm subsidies confirm it.</TE>
<TE>   Roy A. Fassel</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rifkin's commentary was great reading and very educational to
people who view vegetarians more as extraterrestrials than caring
people concerned about the suffering of animals, destruction of the
Earth's ecology and personal health. I don't sit around a table
preaching what others should eat, but as soon as the subject
arises--that I'm vegetarian--many people become very defensive and
quite insolent about my choice of lifestyle. They start telling me
that maybe I should be concerned about harvesting lettuce, since
maybe it is also alive and might feel pain.</TE>
<TE>   The ridiculous conversation takes many absurd turns; I just sit
and listen in shock most times. The facts, or my feelings on the
subject, are not even up for consideration, since the thought of any
human being a vegetarian seems to insult many people.</TE>
<TE>   Myriam Giovannini</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rifkin's basic premise is that grain producers sell their grain to
cattlemen when they could just as easily give it away for charitable
purposes. It's a pleasant thought (that everyone should address every
ill in the world), but alas, that is not how the world functions.
Grain producers sell to cattlemen not out of a nefarious deal (a
conspiracy?) to make fatter cattle for the wealthy West's consumers;
they sell to the people who can guarantee the best purchase terms.</TE>
<TE>   The answer, therefore, is not some central-planning solution
(i.e., as in a Soviet designation of grain distribution and sales).
The solution is to assist the countries in question to achieve
economic and political gains so that they can purchase grain (and
technology, etc.) on the open market with fair terms.</TE>
<TE>   James Boshnack</TE>
<TE>   Ventura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rifkin must not have known about the front-page article running in
the same issue. "U.S. Exports Misery to Africa With Farm Bill" (May
27) presents arguments that current and future overproduction of
grain in the world is detrimental to African farmers. Rifkin claims
there is not enough grain to feed both people and livestock. He
should know that the reason some people starve while the rest of us
are well-fed on beef is because corrupt leaders choose to let others
starve, not because we feed our grain to cattle. I would sooner send
my steak to Somalia than eat it--if they would let me.</TE>
<TE>   John Fortman</TE>
<TE>   Valencia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rifkin's harangue, subtitled "Growing grain for feed instead of
food may be humanity's greatest evil yet," seems somewhat extreme.
Where is this man when I protest the growing of grain to make
gasohol? Now, that is absurd.</TE>

<LD>Republican Shawn Steel's "Lionesses of the Left Eat Judicial Nominees
Alive" (Commentary, May 26) is an ill-considered criticism of our
California Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer.
Possibly our two senators are now screening judicial candidates
carefully because they regret their failure to act to stop the
disastrous appointment of Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, who is doing his
best to roll back civil rights victories achieved over the past 50
years.</LD>
<LD>   This is politics. Of course Democrats have the right to try to
obtain judges who represent Democratic ideals--"mainstream judges."
Steel further criticizes district judge candidates about their
position on Roe vs. Wade. Why not? Today's district judge may be
tomorrow's Supreme Court judge. Steel implies that the two senators
are unfairly attacking the president's judicial appointment power.
Correct me if I am wrong, but according to the Constitution, doesn't
the president nominate with the advice and consent of the Senate?</LD>
<LD>   Finally, as a woman I resent the characterization of our senators
as lionesses. Such imagery harks back to the days of the Salem witch
trials.</LD>
<TE>   Metche F. Franke</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What a short memory Steel has concerning judge nominees. As of
today, President Bush has gotten more judges appointed than the
Republicans allowed President Clinton to get for the same period of
time. I guess it is OK for Republicans to play politics but not
Democrats. I am so glad Feinstein and Boxer, who were both
overwhelmingly voted into office, are being cautious about whom they
are allowing to be judges.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who was not voted into office by the majority of people,
showed how important political judges--yes, even Supreme Court
judges--can be.</TE>

<TE>   Irvine</TE>

<TE>   Boxer and Feinstein are doing exactly what they were elected to
do. Payback for Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and his poor Senate
Judiciary Committee that blocked Clinton's nominees is well deserved,
but more important, it will prevent the court system from being
skewed to the right against the wishes of the electorate.</TE>
<TE>   I have a feeling that if President Bush nominated ex-President
Clinton for the first opening on the Supreme Court, many of the
Republican complaints about delays would disappear.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I strongly agree with the welfare system enforcing time limits on
welfare recipients, but I also feel that too much assistance is
offered to them and is being taken advantage of ("Welfare Reform's
Enforcers," May 28). Many welfare recipients have the opportunity to
attend college while the government supplies the funding, not to
mention free child care for their children and cash aid. Who wouldn't
want to be on welfare?</LD>
<LD>   I think Gov. Gray Davis needs to consider revamping the welfare
system and trying to discourage people from falling into and becoming
victims of the system. Why do we extend various forms of help to
illegal immigrants? That could be money saved and put toward the
education of our youth. As a working U.S. citizen and law-abiding
taxpayer, I don't qualify for Medi-Cal because I have no dependents.
Yes, I work 40 hours a week and I'm often on a tight budget; but who
is to say I am ineligible for aid? Do I have to be living in poverty
with more than one child in my care?</LD>
<TE>   I applaud welfare caseworker Martha Soria for having patience and
striving to meet the needs of every applicant. But in order for the
applicants to be successful they must be diligent about attending
their appointments and take advantage of what is being offered to
them. I do have compassion, but often it is mixed with disgust
because too many people are neglecting to utilize the help that is
being offered to them and only want a monthly check. Unless the
government and the city find a better way, more suitable to welfare
reform, the cycle will continue to repeat itself in the years to
come.</TE>
<TE>   Crystal del Pozo</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article reporting that it takes more than 2,500 social
workers to administer Los Angeles County's welfare program shows how
cost-ineffective the system is. It would be cheaper to just mail
every needy person a monthly check.</TE>
<TE>   We have to get rid of the myth that "welfare-to-work" will end
poverty and homelessness. Even a full-time job at the minimum wage
can't lift a family of three out of poverty. And the United States
has never been able to provide enough jobs for everyone who wants to
work.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, we should call California Sens. Barbara Boxer
and Dianne Feinstein and ask them to support a bill that includes
caring for children, getting an education and job training in the
definition of "work."</TE>

<LD>Re "Help Palestinians Nurture Democracy," May 28: Noah Feldman might
like to believe that a Palestinian democracy is possible in perhaps
six months, but actions on the ground point in a different direction.
Regular efforts to smuggle weapons into the Gaza Strip from Egypt
through the Rafah tunnels and the disclosure in Die Welt, a German
weekly, that the Palestinian Authority requested $20million from the
European Union for new weapons are not indications that Israel's
neighbor is planning a peaceful transition to becoming the second
democratic country in the region.</LD>
<LD>   By the way, the amount earmarked for more arms was higher than
those for health and education. Does that sound like the road to
democracy?</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Bill to Ban Indian Mascots Is Blocked," May 29: At last, a voice
of reason! The California Assembly soundly defeated the overreaching
bill introduced by Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg, and rightly so. If
ever there was an example of government poking into areas where it
doesn't belong, this was it.</LD>
<LD>   While I am no fan of most Republican rhetoric and actions, this
time they are right. Political correctness has reached absurd heights
in our society, and it is time to get on with important issues like
the state deficit, urban transportation, health care, education, etc.
It appears that some of the supporting organizations take themselves
way too seriously! Hats off to the California legislators who put an
end to this frivolous piece of nonsense.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Reinberger</LD>
<TE>   Glendora</TE>
<TE>   Thank God the California Assembly has some respect for our Native
Americans and slapped down Goldberg's patronizing attempt at
belittling them (does "PC" stand for politically correct or
paternally chauvinistic?). I almost started thinking Native Americans
couldn't tell the difference between being dissed and being honored
for their ancestors' warrior spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Then I read in your article that most of the tribal leaders in
California don't support Goldberg's bill to ban all Native American
team mascots from public schools--that they don't consider it a
"pressing issue." Apparently, while Goldberg tries to mandate "racial
sensitivity" for the poor Indians, they have better things to do.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As a writer with a law degree who has done extensive research on the
failure of medical insurance companies to reimburse doctors, I
sympathize with the backers of legislation that would make it harder
for insurance companies to bounce claims back and forth and leave
them unpaid ("HMOs to Face Payment Pressure," May 26).</LD>
<LD>   However, legislation preventing such behavior already is on the
books in California, including the requirement of prompt handling of
claims. These laws routinely are ignored by insurance companies,
which manipulated the federal government into passing legislation
that deprives doctors and patients of the ability to hit these
companies in the pocketbook with lawsuits for breach of contract and
fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Although it is tempting to address an injustice by merely passing
a new law, it is unlikely insurance companies would comply, given
their unethical behavior up to now, which would have made them the
subject of district attorney investigations if they were ordinary
businesses.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, one cannot legislate bureaucracies into doing a
moral act or respecting others' rights, whether major insurance
companies, Enron or the Catholic hierarchy. All bureaucracies act
alike--to protect their existence, power and profit at the expense of
everything else.</TE>

<LD>As to the merits of postponing marriage until our identity-forging
20s are over ("Bearded-Lady Saint Offers Comfort to a Generation in
Waiting," Commentary, May 28), I can only say this: The more "forged"
our identities are, the more difficult it is for us to endure the
many compromises it takes to be in a successful marriage. While
waiting until oats are sown and hearts are more mature is a good
thing, those who wait too long will also discover that the odds of
finding an acceptable, undivorced (baggage-free) mate are greatly
reduced.</LD>
<LD>   Like most things, the truth probably lies in the middle: If 20 is
too young and 35 too old, perhaps the "right" age to marry is 27.
Quick, someone throw a few million dollars at some university to
study this.</LD>

<LD>Archbishop Vatche Hovespian, primate of the Burbank-based Western
Diocese of the Armenian Church of North America, has announced that
he will step down next year.</LD>
<LD>   Hovespian, 71, disclosed that he had informed the Armenian
patriarch of his plans more than a year ago. Hovespian has served as
archbishop for 31 years.</LD>
<LD>   Father Sipan Mekhsian, editor of the diocesan newspaper Mother
Church, said the election of a new archbishop is scheduled for a year
from now. The new archbishop will be elected by delegates from each
of the diocese's parishes, as well as by active priests.</LD>
<TE>   Mekhsian reported that Hovespian has said he will continue to work
within the diocese after the election of his successor and has
offered his full support to the new archbishop.</TE>
<TE>   The election must be approved by His Holiness Karekin II, Supreme
Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians, headquartered in the
Armenian city of Echmiadzin.</TE>
<TE>   Hovespian was in Armenia this week and was not available for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The diocese includes 26 parishes in 13 Western states. The church
said more than half a million Armenians live within its jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   The church teaches that it was founded by St. Gregory the
Illuminator, who converted the Armenian King Tiridates to
Christianity in 301 and established the Church of Armenia as the
first official Christian state church in the world.</TE>

<DH>Catholics: Confidential report in 1985 urged leaders to
take action to combat a growing sexual abuse scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"What did they know and when did they know it?"--a variation on a
phrase popularized during the Watergate scandal--is now being
directed at the nation's Roman Catholic bishops as they scramble to
confront the church's sexual abuse crisis.</LD>
<LD>   As it turns out, as early as 1985 the bishops knew more than they
admitted about the magnitude of a budding scandal. That year, they
were given what critics now regard as a road map for a thorough
housecleaning--a prescription that the bishops failed to heed.</LD>
<LD>   The history of this warning, a 92-page report by two priests and a
lawyer, may haunt the bishops when they convene in two weeks to
discuss solutions to the abuse problem.</LD>
<TE>   The 1985 report warned prophetically that sexual abuse of minors
constituted "the single most serious and far-reaching problem facing
our church today." And it flatly urged: "Those presumed to be guilty
of sexual misconduct, especially if it involves child molestation,
must never be transferred to another parish or post as the isolated
remedy for the situation."</TE>
<TE>   Since early this year, the nation's newspapers have been flooded
with reports of priests who were transferred from parish to parish to
cover up their sexual abuse. Only now--as the church reels from
hundreds of millions of dollars in payouts to victims and a stunning
loss of credibility--are the nation's bishops ready to reexamine the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   The bishops, some of whom were involved in cover-ups of the sexual
abuse of minors by priests and bishops, are talking about ideas such
as "zero tolerance," and "one strike and you're out." They are also
calling for far greater oversight by rank-and-file Catholics--an
attitude adjustment in a hierarchical church where cardinals are
called princes and bishops are addressed as "your excellency."</TE>
<TE>   Yet as determined as bishops say they are to deliver, what happens
in Dallas at the spring meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic
Bishops belong to a lineage of repeated scandals, denials,
half-actions and missed opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing shows this more vividly than the 1985 report by Father
Thomas P. Doyle, the late Father Michael Peterson and attorney F. Ray
Mouton, confidentially delivered to the nation's bishops when they
met in Collegeville, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The entire issued of child sexual abuse ... is displayed
prominently across the front pages of newspapers, where it shall
remain for at least the balance of the decade....The general
awareness and consciousness of the public in regard to sexual abuse
of children has reached a previously unattained level and shall
continue to escalate with each new revelation of discovered cases of
sexual molestation."</TE>
<TE>   --The Doyle Report</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Their backs are against the wall, and that is why this is
happening," Doyle said in a telephone interview this week. "There is
no evidence of any proactive steps taken by the bishops since 1985.
They have reacted to critical press and lawsuits but never solely
because people were being devastated by sexual abusers." He called
the expected Dallas vote on reform proposals "too little, way too
late."</TE>
<TE>   It is a view shared by victims of clergy sexual abuse, and by one
of the nation's leading church watchers, publisher Tom Fox of the
National Catholic Reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "Had the U.S. bishops taken Tom Doyle and Michael Peterson
seriously, the unspeakable pain of thousands of victims, potentially
billions in lawsuit settlements, and the tragic shredding of the
church's Gospel message of compassion could have been avoided," Fox
said. His newspaper is believed to be the first to cover the Doyle
report beginning in the mid-1980s. It ran the full text for the first
time two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Doyle, Peterson and Mouton called for some of the steps that will
be before the bishops in two weeks, including more involvement by
Catholic laity in overseeing sexual abuse cases and policies, and
national standards that every bishop must meet in guarding against
the sexual abuse of minors.</TE>
<TE>   Many church leaders say they have made incremental progress and
complain that the media and abuse-victims groups have not given them
enough credit for what they have done.</TE>
<TE>   But it is also clear that the nation's bishops were for a long
time determined to avoid public scandal. Doyle said that to even
suggest a problem, as he and his co-authors did in their 1985
report--which was not made public at the time--resulted in
institutional retribution.</TE>
<TE>   Doyle, who had a promising career in the Vatican's Washington,
D.C., embassy as a priest who many thought was destined to become a
bishop, was virtually exiled after he delivered the report. Today he
is an Air Force chaplain stationed at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.
"We were unwelcome then and still are, because what we had to say was
too blunt, threatening and true," Doyle said.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal's current phase erupted in January with revelations in
Boston that a known pedophile priest had been transferred from parish
to parish, where he allegedly molested up to 130 boys.</TE>
<TE>   The startling disclosures by the Boston Globe about then-Father
John Geoghan have prompted some Catholics to call for Boston's
Cardinal Bernard Law to resign.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan is serving time in a case involving just one boy. Now,
trial lawyers are wondering how much other church leaders knew about
abusive priests elsewhere, including Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los
Angeles, who kept a problem priest on the job.</TE>
<TE>   The Times disclosed that Father Michael Baker told Mahony in 1986
that he had been abusing boys, but that Mahony transferred him from
parish to parish, where abuse allegedly continued.</TE>
<TE>   Baker was allowed to retire in 2000 after Mahony approved a
$1.3-million settlement with two men who alleged that Baker had
molested them. Mahony says that he was not fully aware of the extent
of Baker's allegedly abusive behavior and that he believed him to
have been rehabilitated based on therapists' reports.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Some extremely serious issues have arisen which presently place
the church in the posture of facing extremely serious financial
consequences as well as significant injury to its image....The
criminal considerations, civil considerations, canonical
considerations and clinical considerations are of such magnitude, not
to mention the other substantial considerations such as insurance and
public relations, that it was decided that the presentation of these
extraordinary issues necessitated an extraordinary response....Time
is of the essence."</TE>
<TE>   "If the bishop is aware of sexual misconduct, or a propensity for
sexual misconduct, that took place at an earlier date, does this fact
become a critical question in subsequent litigation involving child
molestation? In other words, if the bishop has knowledge that a
priest sexually abused a child in 1970, does this knowledge affect
his liability in the event of a similar incident in 1980?"</TE>
<TE>   --The Doyle Report</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The report's suggestion that bishops as well as the offending
priest could be held accountable was especially telling since the
vast majority of cases making headlines today involve sexual abuse
that occurred years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Even in 1985, known claims against the church by victims who had
gone to court were more than $100 million, and the report offered a
"conservative" estimate that claims would hit $1 billion by 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Of late, bishops have expressed concern that plaintiffs in civil
suits would not only go after the priest, but the archdiocese and its
bishop as well, because of deep pockets.</TE>
<TE>   "All of these dimensions demand a concentrated degree of attention
by the church, the report said. Attorneys for victims have claimed
that the bishops should be held responsible because they are in
charge and ultimately make the decisions about if and where a priest
serves.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "While the welfare of the priest-offender is considered very
important to the church officials, the welfare both at the time of
the abuse and well into the future of the victims is most important
and should be given a priority by [bishops] .... We are speaking not
only of psychological effects but also the spiritual effects since
the perpetrators of the abuse are priests or clerics."</TE>
<TE>   --The Doyle Report</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bishops during the last several years have repeatedly stressed
that their first concern is for the victim and the victim's family.
But victims support groups argue that for too long the church put its
priests first. Resentment and lawsuits followed. Some victims said
they sued only after the church refused to either apologize or
acknowledge their pain.</TE>
<TE>   The 1985 report was not totally ignored. But progress has been
halting and at times equivocal. In February 1988, the bishops'
general counsel issued a statement deploring sexual abuse and offered
private counsel to dioceses.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 5, 1989, a statement that would be challenged by many
today was issued by a bishops administrative committee. "The problem
of priests and child abuse is a serious one, but not a very common
one. Seen in proportion, it is in fact quite uncommon." The statement
went on to say child sexual abuse was not a problem just for the
church, but society in general.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1990s and throughout that decade, the bishops seemed
more forthright in expressing concern, even as support groups for
victims and others continued to question their sincerity.</TE>
<TE>   In February 1992, the bishops conference publicly recommended that
"when there is even a hint of such an incident, investigate
immediately; remove the priest whenever the evidence warrants it;
follow the reporting obligations of the civil law; extend pastoral
care to the victim and the victim's family; and seek appropriate
treatment for the offender." But the bishops were not talking in
those days about "zero tolerance" or "one strike."</TE>
<TE>   In November 1992 the bishops, meeting in Washington, were forced
to address the sexual abuse issue once again when alleged victims
picketed their conference hotel. The matter was not on the agenda.
After a quick private meeting between a delegation of protesters and
several clerics, including Mahony, the conference pledged renewed and
stepped-up efforts against sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Pope John Paul II called sexual abuse a "scandal" for the
church. "I fully share your sorrow and your concern, especially your
concern for the victims so seriously hurt," he wrote U.S. bishops.
Several months earlier, the bishops' Secretariat for Priestly Life
and Ministry warned that the church's credibility was on the line.
"We are concerned that the hierarchy's authority and credibility in
the United States was eroding because of a perceived inability to
deal more effectively with the problem of child sexual abuse," it
said.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the secretariat would not go along with what is today
called zero tolerance. "We disagree with the extreme position that
would bar all priest molesters, without exception, from future
ministry," it said.Later that year, U.S. bishops urged the Vatican to
approve changes in church law to make it easier to defrock guilty
priests. They also asked the Vatican to raise the age of minors in
canon law to 17 from 15. The Vatican subsequently agreed.</TE>
<TE>   The Doyle-Peterson-Mouton report was not an unqualified call for
the protection of victims of sexual abuse. Much of it focused on how
bishops should maintain secrecy to protect their legal flank.</TE>
<TE>   The report went so far as to say that its contents should not be
copied and that bishops return their copies after they had read them.
This was to avoid the risk that the material might fall into the
hands of victims' attorneys or the press.</TE>
<TE>   Doyle this week said the report was written for bishops' eyes only
but that it was always the authors' intent to build on its arguments.
Many bishops contend that they acted in good faith in retaining
troubled priests based on advice from psychologists.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a cop-out," Doyle said. "What you see is classic
institutional behavior when you're caught and you're being accused of
something that's horrendous....All you need to do is have an
encounter with one victim. You'll get the idea. It's horrific."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Will Be Forced to Dip Into Reserves to Cover Deficit</HD>
<DH>Government: Expected $57-million shortfall, the first since
county's bankruptcy, is linked to state's money problems. Drop in
sales tax revenue adds to woes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time since the county's historic bankruptcy in 1994,
Orange County will tap into its reserves to offset an anticipated
$57-million budget shortfall, county finance officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The unusual action was prompted by new budget figures the
governor's office issued in May, said Gary Burton, the county's chief
financial officer, who unveiled the county's $4.3-billion budget--up
4% from last year--for the fiscal year that starts July 1.</LD>
<LD>   Use of the county's reserves is necessary "to maintain operations
and balance the budget," Burton said. The shortfall is the result of
the stagnant economy and the state's $23.6-billion deficit, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The sluggish economy has also lowered sales tax revenue, causing a
$10-million funding drop for public protection agencies, including
the district attorney's office and Sheriff's Department. Furthermore,
the county has had to deal with increased retirement and health
insurance rates for former employees, Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   The county plans to use $17.3 million from its $126-million
"strategic priorities reserve," which funds the Board of Supervisors'
priority programs: affordable housing, ocean water quality and such
capital improvement programs as the Theo Lacy Branch Jail expansion.</TE>
<TE>   The county will not touch a separate $23-million emergency reserve
for such catastrophic events as earthquakes, Burton said.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining the reserves was part of the post-bankruptcy financial
planning that allowed the county to prioritize programs and provide
funding for them. When shortfalls occur, the process allows the board
to shift its priorities and funding levels.</TE>
<TE>   Burton and a half-dozen department heads said the county is in for
serious belt-tightening, and pinpointed potential cuts in programs
and services if the state's budget picture doesn't brighten soon.</TE>
<TE>   Details of the budget are still being worked out, but some of the
hardest-hit programs are expected to include drug rehabilitation,
family resource centers, foster care, adoptions, summer youth jobs
and mental health services to the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, County Executive Officer Michael Schumacher ordered a
hiring freeze in anticipation of the proposed cuts in services and
programs. Only those vacancies identified as "critically important"
will be filled, a county spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   The county also has stepped up lobbying efforts with such
Sacramento legislators as Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver
City), said Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad.</TE>
<TE>   Given its own shortfall, the state is backing away from funding
programs it mandated, which has left Orange and other counties having
to provide services with a reduced level of funding, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The county was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1994 after it lost
$1.6 billion on risky investments. Officials pledged to repay more
than $900 million in recovery bonds and bankruptcy debts over 25
years.</TE>
<TE>   The state shortfall and use of the county's reserves will not
affect the repayment schedule, said county spokeswoman Diane Thomas.
County finance officials will present the proposed budget at a
workshop Thursday at 3 p.m. in the county Hall of Administration, 10
Civic Center Plaza, Santa Ana. The budget will be presented to the
Board of Supervisors on June 11.</TE>

<HD>Panel Accused of Designing Law Loophole</HD>
<DH>Politics: FPPC chided for ruling on Prop. 34 ban of big
donations. Its chief says that incumbents don't have to exploit it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The watchdog state commission that exempted state legislators from
the new law that outlaws large campaign contributions was accused
Friday of deliberately creating a loophole rather than pursuing
alternative solutions.</LD>
<LD>   In an angry letter, senior Republican Sen. Ross Johnson
(R-Irvine), a co-author of the successful Proposition 34 ballot
initiative in 2000, charged that the state Fair Political Practices
Commission had become a "toothless watchdog" which "subverted" the
law's intention of limiting big contributions.</LD>
<LD>   Commission chairwoman Karen Getman fired back, insisting the fault
was not with the commission, but with lawmakers who had taken
advantage of the commission's ruling.</LD>
<TE>   "No one is obligated to fund-raise just because we say it's legal
to do so," Getman said in a letter. "Every incumbent legislator not
running for office--yourself included--can cease fund-raising now.
You can set the example."</TE>
<TE>   At issue was a commission ruling that enabled incumbent
legislators' existing campaign committees to continue raising large
contributions in unlimited amounts, but said their challengers must
obey the limits imposed by Proposition 34.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) and Senate President
Pro Tem John L. Burton (D-San Francisco) used the loophole to raise
nearly $3 million in the last nine months.</TE>
<TE>   The commission decision held that political committees operating
before Jan. 1, 2001, when Proposition 34 took effect, did not have to
observe a $3,000 limit on donations because the new law could not be
applied to them retroactively. The measure's limits, however, do
apply to legislative candidates in elections since then, the
commission ruled.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to balance the decision, the five-member commission
prohibited lawmakers from spending their funds for election purposes,
such as transferring money to other candidates in excess of $3,000
per election, or $6,000 for a primary and general election.</TE>
<TE>   It did allow them to donate the money to political parties or
charities.</TE>
<TE>   But campaign-reform advocates charged that the commission turned
the law upside-down in favor of incumbents and wealthy special
interests who seek to influence legislative decisions with generous
donations. Getman, an attorney who had specialized in
political-reform law before Davis appointed her to the commission,
defended the decision as proper, given the complex task of trying to
marry a new law that imposed radical limits and the old law, which
allowed donations without end.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, Johnson, first elected to the Legislature in 1978,
told Getman her explanation suggested the commission had "no choice
but to adopt regulations allowing unlimited contributions."</TE>
<TE>   He said this was "nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   "The plain reading of Proposition 34 is clear: imposition of
contribution limits across the board, without exception," he claimed.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than exempting incumbents from the limits of Proposition
34, Johnson said, the commission could have sought other options,
including asking the Legislature for "modification or clarification"
of the law, or supporting a bill that was introduced to deal with the
expenditure of campaign funds by termed-out lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Why don't you make suggestions for corrective legislation today?"
Johnson asked.</TE>
<TE>   He said the commission "provided a loophole big enough to drive a
Mack truck through."</TE>
<TE>   In her response to Johnson, Getman chided him for failing to take
a stand on the issue until this week, when The Times reported that
legislative leaders and more than a dozen other lawmakers had taken
contributions that exceeded the limits of Proposition 34.</TE>
<TE>   (Johnson was not among them.)</TE>
<TE>   However, Republican leaders released a letter to Davis and Getman,
written July 11 by Senate GOP floor leader Jim Brulte of Rancho
Cucamonga and Assembly GOP leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   In it, they protested any decision that would allow a return to
unlimited contributions by incumbents.</TE>

<LD>Faye Dancer, who was known as "All the Way Faye" during her heyday in
the 1940s as one of the greats of the All American Girls Professional
Baseball League, has died. She was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Dancer, the inspiration for Madonna's "All the Way Mae" character
in the 1992 comedy film "A League of Their Own," died May 22 after
undergoing surgery for cancer at UCLA Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   For six seasons, between 1944 and 1950, the West Los Angeles
native played center field and occasionally pitched for the
Minneapolis Millerettes, the Fort Wayne Daisies and the Peoria
Redwings.</LD>
<TE>   "She was a great all-around ballplayer," said Lavonne "Pepper"
Paire Davis, Dancer's former teammate and lifelong friend.</TE>
<TE>   Labeled a "fly-catching genius" by sportswriters of the day,
Dancer "could go back on the dead run, catch the ball over her
shoulder, wheel around and in one motion throw a strike to the
catcher in the air from deep center field," said Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Dancer also was known for her hitting and base stealing. In 1948,
she stole 108 bases.</TE>
<TE>   "She was that rare breed of ball player that could get up to bat,
lay down a perfect bunt, then steal second base," said Davis. "Then,
the next time up, she could hit the long ball and knock it out of the
ballpark. She led the league in both categories at times, in stolen
bases and home runs."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who served as technical advisor on "A League of Their Own"
and was a model for Geena Davis' catcher character, said the
Dancer-inspired character played by Madonna "dwelt a little bit more
on the promiscuous side on sexual encounters. Faye had her share of
admirers, but her [All the Way Faye] nickname really came from her
all-out-style of play. On the ball field, there wasn't anything she
wouldn't do to win."</TE>
<TE>   She would crash into the fence to make a catch; she'd dive head
first into a base; and if a bunt was needed, she'd lay down a bunt,
Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the All American Girls League we had to wear skirts and look
like ladies at all times," Dancer once said. "The guys would look at
our short skirts, then look at our legs and wonder how we could slide
without taking all the hide off ourselves. Well, we did take the hide
off ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved to slide."</TE>
<TE>   Dancer's all-out playing style was memorably captured in a 1948
photograph that shows her sliding into third base to avoid being
tagged by Marge Wenzell.</TE>
<TE>   A large blow-up of the picture is prominently featured in the All
American Girls Baseball League exhibit at the National Baseball Hall
of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y., which includes Dancer's
spikes and gloves.</TE>
<TE>   Dancer joined Davis and more than 75 other former league members
for the opening of the exhibit on Nov. 5, 1988.</TE>
<TE>   The daughter of a Department of Water and Power inspector, Dancer
was born in Santa Monica in 1925 and grew up in West Los Angeles. She
discovered softball in grade school, but threw the ball so hard she
typically had to play on the boys' teams.</TE>
<TE>   When she was 11, Dancer began playing in a local
merchant-sponsored softball league, which played at the Veterans
Administration ballpark off Wilshire Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Always a fierce competitor, she worked hard to improve her game.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to practice my slides in the sand at Santa Monica beach,
then go home and lie on my bed and visualize my swings while I stared
up at my bedroom ceiling," Dancer told the Sacramento Bee two years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   From 1940 to 1942, Dancer and Davis were members of the Dr
Peppers, a Class A amateur girls softball team sponsored by the soft
drink company that played in league games at Fielder Field at Fairfax
Avenue and 3rd Street.</TE>
<TE>   In 1943, with many major league baseball players serving in the
military, chewing gum magnate and Chicago Cubs owner P.K. Wrigley and
others formed the All American Girls Professional Baseball League.</TE>
<TE>   Wrigley had been informed by President Roosevelt that the 1943
major league baseball season might be suspended due to the number of
players serving in the military.</TE>
<TE>   Wrigley viewed the creation of the first professional baseball
league for women as a way to preserve the national pastime during the
war by entertaining fans with what was promoted as "Girls Baseball."</TE>
<TE>   In 1944, 18-year-old Dancer and Davis were among six California
women ballplayers chosen by the league's West Coast scout to report
to league spring training in Peru, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Dancer earned a beginning salary of $75 a week, plus $2.50 a day
for meals.</TE>
<TE>   For three consecutive seasons in the late 1940s, more than 1
million fans paid $1.50 admission to watch the women play.</TE>
<TE>   Dancer and her fellow players plied the Midwest on a rickety bus,
routinely playing 10 games a week.</TE>
<TE>   For the women, it was bad enough having to live down being called
the Fort Wayne Daisies or the Racine Belles, but they also had to
contend with wearing short-skirted uniforms that ranged in hue from
bubble-gum pink to lemon yellow.</TE>
<TE>   But the women, who played 110 to 130 ball games in four months,
were as aggressive and tough as any male player.</TE>
<TE>   To preserve what Wrigley called the "feminine angle" on and off
the field, the players were required to attend a Helena Rubenstein
charm school in the evenings during spring training.</TE>
<TE>   League rules forbade them to appear in public in shorts, slacks
and jeans, or with curlers in their hair. They couldn't smoke, drink
or curse in public. And on the field, they were not allowed to scream
or kick dirt on the umpires.</TE>
<TE>   As Davis recalled, "You had to walk and talk and act like a lady
at all times, but play baseball like a guy."</TE>
<TE>   Dancer may have played baseball like a guy, but she put her own
spin on the proceedings, earning a reputation as the "rebel of the
league."</TE>
<TE>   "I was forever having fun, raising my skirt up for the fans, doing
the splits and handstands when the games got quiet," she recalled in
1992.</TE>
<TE>   She was just as fun-loving off the field.</TE>
<TE>   Each team had a chaperon and Dancer took it upon herself to
initiate them: She'd put Limburger cheese on the light bulbs in their
rooms, replace the icing in their Oreo cookies with toothpaste and
smear peanut butter on their toilet seats.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them just couldn't take it," Dancer recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a 10 p.m. curfew, she and Davis were known to cut loose at
night by sneaking out for beers. They'd avoid the coaches and
chaperons in the hotel lobby by returning to their rooms via the fire
escape.</TE>
<TE>   Dancer once recalled that when she was playing for Peoria in 1947,
two gangsters would come by to watch . They'd arrive in a blue
Packard with bulletproof glass.</TE>
<TE>   "The kingpin liked me," she said. "He offered to buy my folks a
new car. He offered me a golden palomino and said he'd put me up in
the sporting goods business. Once, he even asked me if I wanted
anyone killed. I told him, 'Maybe the umpire.'"</TE>
<TE>   Dancer retired from professional baseball in 1950 after severely
injuring her back while sliding into a base.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the league, which was disbanded in 1954, she
returned to her off-season job as an electronics technician for
Hughes Aircraft. She then worked for 35 years as an electronics
technician for a power generator manufacturing company in Santa
Monica, where she lived.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, not long after being laid off from her job, she was
diagnosed with breast cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a tough lady," said Davis. "She fought every step of the
way to win [in baseball] and she went out that way, fighting every
step of the way."</TE>
<TE>   Dancer never married. "The love of her life was killed in the
war," said Davis.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by her brother, Richard Dancer, of Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   A graveside service will be held at 11 a.m. Tuesday at Woodlawn
Cemetery, 1847 14th St., Santa Monica.</TE>

<HD>Firm to Probe Dubious Trading of Electricity</HD>
<DH>Power: CMS Energy says no such activity involved California
or the West. Reliant tells FERC it engaged in one sham deal in the
state to boost its trading volume.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire and Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CMS Energy Corp. has named a special committee to investigate more
than $4 billion in questionable power trades by its energy marketing
unit, the Michigan-based gas and electricity company announced
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Houston energy company Reliant reported to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission that it had engaged in one "unusually
large" sham transaction in California to boost its trading volume.</LD>
<LD>   So-called "round-trip" trading involves one company selling power
to another firm, then buying it back for the same price.</LD>
<TE>   The practice is used to make a company's revenues seem larger than
they really are, and can also be utilized to drive market prices
higher. FERC had asked for the data as part of its investigation of
alleged market manipulation in California and the West in 2000-2001.</TE>
<TE>   The use of round-trip trades in the energy industry surfaced as a
result of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the practice can be used to gradually nudge market
prices higher, so real transactions can be made at a greater profit.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant said its trade was carried out April 19, 2000, at the
prevailing market price of $34.25 per megawatt hour. It released no
other details. The company said it has since instituted a policy
forbidding such trades.</TE>
<TE>   Friday was the deadline for about 130 companies to respond to a
demand from FERC on whether they had engaged in round-trip trades in
the West in 2000-2001.</TE>
<TE>   FERC did not release the responses, but several firms publicly
denied that they had engaged in the practice in the region. Among
them were AES, Duke Energy, Dynegy, El Paso Corp., Mirant, Powerex,
Williams and Xcel Energy.</TE>
<TE>   CMS had previously acknowledged that it used round-trip trades to
inflate its revenues by more than $4.4 billion from May 2000 through
mid-January this year. The company's special investigative panel will
be headed by Lear Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Way and will hire its own
legal staff. It will report to the CMS board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   CMS spokesman John Barnett said none of the company's questionable
trades were carried out in California or the West.</TE>
<TE>   California officials are also investigating whether energy traders
and others improperly manipulated the market in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The agency that manages California's power grid told a state
senator Friday that it didn't create false demand for energy, as the
legislator has claimed.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said last week that the
California Independent System Operator overstated its demand for
power to secure supply over a weekend in November.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations of manipulation mirrored tactics described in
Enron Corp. memos, which led federal regulators to investigate
alleged gaming of California's energy market.</TE>
<TE>   But in a 15-page report to Dunn, Cal-ISO said its action "bears no
resemblance to strategies suggested by Enron for getting paid for
delivering unscheduled energy into California."</TE>

<HD>William A. Ingram, 77; Sent Mob Boss to Prison</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William A. Ingram, 77, San Jose's first full-time judge and the man
who sentenced Mafia chieftain Joseph Bonanno to prison, died Sunday
at a Menlo Park rehabilitation clinic. The cause of death was not
disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Ingram was appointed to the federal bench by President Ford in
1976. In San Jose, where Ingram served from 1983 to 1988, he ruled on
new areas of intellectual property law, including a series of cases
involving computer chip makers such as Intel.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1987 copyright case involving Intel of Santa Clara and NEC
Corp. of Japan, he issued a landmark ruling that the internal design
of microchips is protected by U.S. copyright law. Intel had sued NEC,
alleging that the Japanese company had illegally reproduced the
micro-code of Intel's 8086 and 8088 chips widely used in IBM and
IBM-compatible PCs.</LD>
<TE>   After issuing the ruling, Ingram removed himself from the case
after discovering he owned $80 worth of Intel stock as an officer of
a private investment club.</TE>
<TE>   While on the federal bench in San Jose, Ingram sentenced Bonanno
to prison after a 1980 trial in which a jury convicted the
75-year-old organized crime boss of conspiring to obstruct a grand
jury investigation into money laundering.</TE>
<TE>   Until entering Ingram's courtroom, Bonanno had eluded conviction
on federal charges despite many prior criminal investigations. Ingram
handed him a five-year sentence, which he later reduced to one year.
Bonanno died May 11 in Tucson at age 97.</TE>
<TE>   Ingram was born in Jeffersonville, Ind., but grew up in the San
Francisco area and attended UC Berkeley and Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   He served as a Marine during and after World War II before
graduating from the University of Louisville law school. He worked as
a deputy district attorney for Santa Clara County and for a San Jose
law firm before he was appointed a municipal court judge for Palo
Alto and Mountain View in 1969. Then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan
elevated him to the Santa Clara Superior Court in 1971, where he
served for five years until his appointment to the federal bench.</TE>
<TE>   Passionate about Shakespeare, he was known to spout lines from his
favorite plays, such as "Henry V," from the bench.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Barbara; three daughters; and four
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Gunnar V. Jarring, 94; U.N. Diplomat for the Mideast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gunnar V. Jarring, Sweden's former ambassador to Washington and the
Soviet Union who served as a special United Nations envoy to seek
peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors in the wake of the
Six-Day War in 1967, has died. He was 94.</LD>
<LD>   Jarring, dubbed the Silent Swede because of his talent for quiet
diplomacy, died Wednesday of undisclosed causes at his home in
Helsingborg, Sweden.</LD>
<LD>   A career diplomat and linguist who spoke a dozen languages,
Jarring was ambassador to the Soviet Union in November 1967 when U.N.
Secretary-General U Thant appointed him as special U.N.
representative to the Middle East.</LD>
<TE>   Jarring's mission was to persuade Israel and the Arab countries to
agree to peace negotiations in accordance with a U.N. Security
Council resolution, which called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces
from territories occupied during the six-day conflict.</TE>
<TE>   It also asked for every country in the area to recognize the right
of all Middle Eastern states to live within secure and guaranteed
boundaries free from threats or acts of force.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope to accomplish something within the framework of the
resolution," Jarring said at the time. "It's impossible to say now
what success I will have."</TE>
<TE>   After four months--and 40 trips to the warring Arab and Israeli
capitals--neither side's positions changed, causing Jarring to sever
his direct contacts and leave the region.</TE>
<TE>   His attempts to solve the Arab-Israeli deadlock, however, only
added to his reputation as "a master of the art of quiet diplomacy,"
as Thant called him.</TE>
<TE>   Once, when a reporter encountered Jarring during one of his
shuttle trips between his headquarters in Cyprus and the Middle East
capitals, he was asked if he was optimistic or pessimistic about an
Arab-Israeli peace agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "No comment," Jarring replied.</TE>
<TE>   When U.N. Undersecretary-General Ralph J. Bunche heard about the
encounter, he reportedly said, "Jarring must have been misquoted. He
would never say that much."</TE>
<TE>   Although he alienated journalists with his public aloofness,
Jarring was known as an ideal mediator and an adept practitioner of
the art of diplomatic tightrope walking.</TE>
<TE>   In negotiations, according to a 1970 analysis of Jarring's
diplomatic style in the London Observer, "He is a careful listener,
hardly ever interrupts and never makes a note; yet his reports of
conversations are immaculately accurate.</TE>
<TE>   "He is remarkably perceptive, quick at picking out nuances and
always careful to study the moods of the people he is talking to, as
well as the public mood of the countries he is visiting. It is here
that his abilities as a linguist are such a formidable addition to
his powers as a negotiator.</TE>
<TE>   "He is, as Israeli and Arab diplomats who have worked with him
agreed, a man who instinctively wins your trust."</TE>
<TE>   The oldest child in a family of eight, Jarring was born in 1907 in
a village in southern Sweden, where his parents ran a farm.</TE>
<TE>   His real name was Jonsson, but because it is such a common name in
Sweden, he changed it to Jarring (pronounced Yah-ring) while studying
foreign languages at the University of Lund.</TE>
<TE>   Jarring specialized in Turkish and when he was called up for
military service after earning his master's degree, he was assigned
to duty in Turkey as an attache. He later wrote a dissertation on
East Turkestan phonetics that earned him a doctoral degree at the age
of 25.</TE>
<TE>   As an assistant professor of Turkish at the University of Lund
from 1933 to 1940, he was afforded opportunities to travel in Asia
and the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   In 1940, he joined Sweden's foreign service, subsequently serving
in India, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Iran, Iraq and Pakistan. He also
headed the political section of the Swedish Foreign Ministry from
1953 to 1956.</TE>
<TE>   In 1956, he became Swedish ambassador to the United Nations and
the Security Council commissioned him to mediate the 9-year-old
dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   In 1958, while continuing as the Swedish representative on the
U.N. Security Council, Jarring was appointed ambassador to the United
States, a post he held until 1964. He was ambassador to the Soviet
Union from 1964 to 1973 and served as special envoy to the U.N.
secretary-general on the Middle East from 1967 to 1991.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his daughter, Eva, who now lives in Australia;
and four siblings.</TE>

<HD>His Jaw Wired, Soldier's Plea Falls on Deaf Ears at Airport</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A U.S. Army lieutenant whose jaw is wired shut because of a bullet
wound he received in Afghanistan says screeners at San Francisco
International Airport denied him permission to pass through security
carrying wire clippers to be used to open his jaw in an emergency.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Greg Miller, a combat medic and member of a Special Forces
patrol, was shot in Kandahar in April. The bullet passed through his
jaw, severing nerves and leaving him without feeling in his mouth.</LD>
<LD>   He said his jaw was wired shut at a hospital in Germany, and his
doctor issued him a pair of wire clippers to carry at all times in
case he became sick and needed to open his jaw to avoid choking.</LD>
<TE>   Miller, of College Station, Texas, had flown to the Bay Area to
visit his mother. He had been told at his local airport that the
clippers were permitted on the plane. Security personnel there even
gave him a sticker saying the tool was allowed.</TE>
<TE>   But when Miller wanted to fly home, he said, San Francisco airport
security personnel told him the tool, with a rounded blade less than
an inch long, was dangerous and confiscated it, despite the sticker.
Miller said that when he complained to an American Airlines official,
he responded that he was too busy to help.</TE>
<TE>   Miller then phoned several media outlets, telling them his story
before boarding the plane. On board, flight attendants told him there
was nothing on board to open his jaw. "What I think it is, is a lack
of common sense," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Airport spokesman Mike McCarron said a flight attendant or pilot
would have held Miller's clippers had their importance been
known--if, for instance, he had presented a doctor's note.</TE>
<TE>   American Airlines spokesman John Hotard agreed, saying the
Transportation Security Administration is still working out kinks in
policy.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the problems they're having is the uniformity of the
process, and I think this is an example of that," he said.</TE>

<HD>Catholic Theologians Face 'Mandatum' Deadline</HD>
<DH>Oath: Doc ensuring they'll teach authentic Catholicism
could divide instructors and church's hierarchy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARLENE LEVINSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A deadline looms today that could ignite a smoldering conflict over
academic freedom between the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy and
theologians at the nation's 235 Catholic colleges and universities.</LD>
<LD>   The winners and losers won't be immediately clear, but in coming
years jobs and the shape of Catholic higher learning may be at stake.</LD>
<LD>   Acting on instructions from the Vatican, U.S. bishops have ordered
Catholics who teach their faith's doctrine, morality, Scripture, law
or history at Catholic schools to obtain a "mandatum," or mandate,
from the bishop of the diocese where the college is located.</LD>
<TE>   The document, which the bishops agreed should be obtained by
today, attests the theologian teaches only authentic Catholicism.</TE>
<TE>   While some, like the orthodox Cardinal Newman Society, have hailed
the mandatum, opponents have derided the requirement as a loyalty
oath. Faculty have complained that it tramples their academic
freedom.</TE>
<TE>   The penalties dissenters may face is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Some bishops warned their colleagues last year that they couldn't
enforce the requirement. But schools could use the mandatum in rating
faculty; it's already affected hiring on at least one campus.</TE>
<TE>   By design, the process is secret; a private matter between each
theologian and bishop. For that reason, no one knows how many
mandatums have been granted.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates of Catholics teaching religious subjects on
church-affiliated campuses range from 300 to more than 800 priests,
nuns and lay professors.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything will depend on the chemistry between a local bishop
and the local institutions," said William Loewe, who teaches at the
Catholic University of America and heads the College Theology
Society. "That leads to a whole wide range of outcomes."</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, no theologians have yet requested a
mandatum because a Los Angeles Archdiocesan committee is still
hammering out the process for doing so. The committee, composed of
representatives from the area's five Catholic colleges and
universities, is still grappling with such issues as how to request a
mandatum, what criteria to use in evaluating a theologian's work and
what happens if the request is denied, according to David Shaneyfelt,
spokesman for Thomas Aquinas College, a liberal-arts college in Santa
Paula.</TE>
<TE>   "Since we're all making a good-faith effort to comply with this,
no one's going to get upset if we miss a deadline," Shaneyfelt said.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony has not publicly commented on the
mandatum issue. But several theologians said he indicated in a
meeting more than a year ago that he was willing to give them a "vote
of confidence" and assume they were teaching correct doctrine.
According to one theologian, Mahony assured them that "he wasn't
going to use [the mandatum] as a tool to go after people."</TE>
<TE>   Pope John Paul II called for certifying professors in a 1990
decree as a way to bolster the religious character of Catholic
campuses worldwide, and the issue roiled U.S. theologians in the late
'90s.</TE>
<TE>   Despite opposition from many professors and academic groups, the
U.S. bishops' conference agreed to require the mandatum and put
procedures in place last year. But the bishops gave themselves
latitude. Each bishop can word the mandatum as he likes. He can let
theologians seek one, or issue them unasked.</TE>
<TE>   More importantly for academics and institutions, the mandatum
guidelines leave any related hiring and firing to the schools.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Dan Pattee at the conservative Franciscan University of
Steubenville in Ohio displays his mandatum in his office. All 12 of
his fellow professors, most of them laity, got one, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the mandatum is asking us to do anything new,"
Pattee said. It's "just kind of formalizing things that Catholic
theologians have already been doing for centuries." He wonders why
anyone would refuse.</TE>
<TE>   So does his school, which requires new hires to get a mandatum and
last year rejected a job candidate who declined.</TE>

<HD>A 44-Year Hold on Room 13</HD>
<DH>Schools: Reseda educator is retiring after more than four
decades teaching first-graders in the same classroom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although much around Reseda has changed since 1958, one thing has
remained the same: the teacher in Room 13 at Vanalden Avenue
Elementary School.</LD>
<LD>   Since that year, Carolyn Sue Palmer has taught first grade in the
same room at Vanalden.</LD>
<LD>   Through more than four decades, hundreds of 6- and 7-year-olds
have learned to read, write, add and subtract with her help.</LD>
<TE>   Now, after 44 years of the same grade in the same room at the same
school, the 65-year-old teacher is retiring, leaving a legacy of
dedication and good memories.</TE>
<TE>   On June 21, Palmer will vacate Room 13, which is filled with art
from students and such artists as Andy Warhol and Picasso.</TE>
<TE>   The room is also filled with gifts she been given over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "This school has been great to me,'' said Palmer, who was honored
Friday for her service to the school that was just 5 years old when
she joined the faculty.</TE>
<TE>   In the early days before the Ventura Freeway was completed, she
recalls driving to the campus through miles of orange groves and
neighborhoods of newly built homes.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer remembers times when the flooding on Wilbur Avenue
prevented many students from getting to school on time, but most of
all she remembers the students' love of reading.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite all the other changes, one thing that has always been the
same is that first-graders love to read," said Palmer, who also
passed along her love of the environment to the children.</TE>
<TE>   "They make it so easy because they are such great students," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer is one of 46 Los Angeles Unified School District educators
and staff members who will be honored Wednesday by the district for
40-plus years of service at a retirement reception.</TE>
<TE>   Another Valley educator, Harvey Thomas, is retiring after 43 years
at Osceola Street Elementary in Sylmar.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer received some early accolades Friday for her commitment and
dedication as parents, faculty members and students presented her
with three commendations.</TE>
<TE>   They were signed by state Supt. of Public Instruction Delaine
Eastin, Gov. Gray Davis and President George W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   But Palmer did not have much time to savor her awards, she said,
because she still had a class to teach.</TE>
<TE>   Fridays are always the hardest, Palmer said, because the children
find it difficult to pay attention when the weekend is just a few
hours away. But when she rings a bell, the room quiets down.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day she complimented 7-year-old Devin Stevens on a
great paper, broke up an argument between two youngsters and taught a
lesson on the use of adjectives.</TE>
<TE>   She also offered some information about the second grade.</TE>
<TE>   "Next year, you'll have bigger desks, so you'll have more elbow
room," she said as she noticed her students jostling each other for
better seats.</TE>
<TE>   While her enthusiasm for working with children has not flagged
since the day she first walked into Room 13, she said other aspects
of education nowadays played a part in her decision to retire.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wish we were back into old-fashioned teaching," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know all this testing is necessary, but I think teachers know
better how students are doing in class than people who administer
these tests and know nothing about the children taking them," Palmer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Parent Elaine Adler hugged Palmer and wondered about the fate of
Room 13, where Adler's two sons and two grandchildren attended first
grade.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe Room 13 is going to have a different teacher next
year," said Adler, whose 6-year-old grandson, James Tayson, is in
Palmer's last class.</TE>
<TE>   "People say the number 13 is unlucky, but whoever had Mrs. Palmer
will tell you that they were lucky to have her."</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lee S. Dolson Jr., 77, a former San Francisco supervisor whose
conservative politics made him an anomaly in the Bay Area bastion of
liberalism, died Sunday in San Francisco after a lengthy illness.</LD>
<LD>   Dolson was one of the Republican Party's most successful
politicians in the city. He served two terms on its Board of
Supervisors in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He also won a seat on
the city's Board of Education and served two terms on the civil grand
jury.</LD>
<LD>   He once noted that state and national Republicans "have pretty
well written off this town" and devoted much of his time to proving
them wrong by rebuilding the city's Republican Party and serving as
vice chairman of the party's central committee.</LD>
<TE>   He lost his bid for a third term as supervisor by 100 votes in
1982 and was unsuccessful in a comeback attempt in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   A San Francisco native, Dolson was a 1944 graduate of the U.S.
Naval Academy, became an ensign and served as commanding officer of a
minesweeper and as an aide to Fleet Adm. Chester W. Nimitz. He was a
lieutenant commander posted to combat duty with the Marines during
the Korean War and was awarded 12 decorations.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the military, he earned master's degrees from San
Francisco State and UC Berkeley, as well as a doctorate in history,
and became an assistant professor at those schools. He also taught
social science at City College of San Francisco.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ken Gjemre, 81, who dropped out of corporate life to found the
successful Half Price Books chain, died Monday) of prostate cancer at
his home in Ojai.</LD>
<LD>   Half Price Books, which has locations in 11 states, including
several in Northern California, began in 1972 when Gjemre quit his
job as a Zale Corp. executive and borrowed $4,000 to launch his own
business.</LD>
<LD>   He and his partner, Pat Anderson, opened a used-book store in an
abandoned laundromat in Dallas with 2,000 books from their personal
libraries. Customers flocked in, buying books before they could be
placed on the shelves.</LD>
<TE>   The company now reports annual revenues of more than $100 million.
It has 73 stores around the country and also sells books and other
used items on the Internet through a partnership with Amazon.</TE>
<TE>   The Indiana native and graduate of Purdue University and Southern
Methodist University left the corporate rat race after rising quickly
through the ranks at Zale because, he said, he grew "tired of selling
people things they didn't need and couldn't afford." He became an
activist, supporting literacy and environmental causes. He donated
his body to the UCLA medical school.</TE>

<HD>Wallace Markfield, 75; Author of Dark, Satiric Novels,

<LD>Wallace Markfield, 75, an author of satirical novels such as "To an
Early Grave" and "Teitlebaum's Window," died May 24 in Roslyn, N.Y.,
of complications from a heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   He made his literary debut with the 1964 novel "To an Early
Grave," which chronicles the misadventures of a group of friends
headed for the funeral of a second-rate writer named Leslie
Braverman. It was made into a 1968 movie directed by Sidney Lumet
called "Bye Bye Braverman" which starred George Segal and Jack
Warden.</LD>
<LD>   His other novels included "You Could Live if They Let You" in 1974
and "Radical Surgery" in 1991. He also wrote a collection of short
stories, "Multiple Orgasms," published in 1977.</LD>
<TE>   In a 1991 review of "Radical Surgery" in the Washington Post,
novelist John Calvin Batchelor praised Markfield's talent for absurd
dread and called the book a textbook of black-humor trickery.</TE>
<TE>   Markfield's stories were known for their juxtaposition of tragedy
and comedy and ample Yiddish references.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Armour, in a Los Angeles Times review of "To an Early
Grave," echoed other critics in his praise of Markfield's "remarkable
ear for the accents and intonations of the Jewish speech of lower
Manhattan."</TE>
<TE>   Though many critics viewed him as a black humorist, he once
preferred this description: "I suppose I'd call myself a tone poet of
aggravation."</TE>

<HD>With New Restraints in Place, Knott's Told It Can Reopen
Water Ride</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State officials gave Knott's Berry Farm approval Friday to reopen its
Perilous Plunge water ride, eight months after a 40-year-old Duarte
woman fell to her death.</LD>
<LD>   The attraction--billed as the world's steepest and tallest flume
ride--soaks people at the end of a 75-degree, 115-foot drop. It will
likely reopen today with overhauled safety restraints, just in time
for the busy summer season.</LD>
<LD>   "We're very happy with the work that Knott's Berry Farm has done
to make the rides safer," said Dean Fryer, state Department of
Occupational Safety and Health spokesman. "They've met all of the
requirements that we've outlined."</LD>
<TE>   Officials from the state agency charged with amusement park
oversight notified Knott's Friday that they had approved the changes,
completed inspections and were releasing the ride back into
operation.</TE>
<TE>   Knott's Berry Farm General Manager Jack Falfas said he didn't
immediately reopen Perilous Plunge because employees were undergoing
training and practice with the new restraint system.</TE>
<TE>   The state accident investigation determined that Lori Mason-Larez
died because the lap bar and seat belt were not adequate. The state
ordered park officials to design better restraints.</TE>
<TE>   The 292-pound woman fell out of the ride as it plunged at speeds
up to 50 mph. State officials at the time said her weight may have
been a factor, but they were not convinced the restraints were
adequate for an average-sized person.</TE>
<TE>   Falfas hired a group of ride engineers and safety consultants to
develop a new prototype restraint. They decided on a four-point
restraint system similar to those used by fighter jet pilots.</TE>
<TE>   The harness comes over the shoulders and wraps across the waist.</TE>
<TE>   The T-shaped lap bar will remain on the ride, as will grab bars in
front of the passengers.</TE>

<HD>Principal Faces His Fears to Fuel Student Reading</HD>
<DH>Education: Alan Cook has eaten bugs, wrestled snakes and
spent a day in a cherry picker, all because his students meet massive
reading goals each school year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ORANGEVALE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>One day each spring, Alan Cook doffs the customary coat and tie of an
elementary school principal and turns into a pratfall performance
artist for his student body.</LD>
<LD>   In the stunt department, Monty Python had nothing on this
educator. Over the years, Cook has been covered with snakes. He has
gulped down a five-course meal of bugs. He even overcame a soaring
anxiety of heights, going aloft for a whole day in a utility cherry
picker.</LD>
<LD>   This isn't another episode of "Fear Factor." It's all about
reading.</LD>
<TE>   The stunts are Cook's way of paying off a bet he makes each year
with students at Green Oaks Fundamental Elementary School in this
suburb of Sacramento County. The principal challenges the students to
collectively crack books of their own choosing. Lots of books. The
goal is to get them to learn the pleasure of the printed word, but
the page-turning target is lofty: This year the students were asked
to pore through 1.5 million pages over a six-month span. That's about
3,400 per pupil.</TE>
<TE>   When his 440 students win the annual bet, as they invariably do,
Cook offers a delicious dose of adult humiliation, the sort of live
theater kids love best.</TE>
<TE>   He isn't the only educator in America to use this motivational
tactic. Just a few days ago, another principal in the district got
dunked in a vat of mud after losing a reading bet.</TE>
<TE>   But few have been doing it as long or as good-naturedly as Cook.
His stunts take weeks to plan and are presented with the pomp and
zeal of a Bob Hope road show. Cleanup typically involves more than a
quick shower and change of clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Just a week ago, he took a bath in 4,400 rotten eggs.</TE>
<TE>   After entering the school grounds in a cart towed by a skittish
pony ("They had to keep me from jumping out," Cook recalls), the
principal was treated to a facial of eggs and avocado, then had his
hair glopped with whipped egg whites.</TE>
<TE>   Egg jokes were told, egg songs sung, egg poems read. Egg puns
("the yolk's on Mr. Cook!") were on most every tongue. The principal
even did a little chicken jig, leading the students in the dance.</TE>
<TE>   Finally he was taken outside. With pluck and ceremony, Cook pulled
on a snorkel and mask. Swim trunks on, he plunged feet-first into a
glass display case filled with past-their-prime eggs donated by
supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   Cook lasted about a minute in the vat of goop. Kids howled with
laughter. Afterward, a crew from the local firehouse hosed him down.</TE>
<TE>   Though students since the dawn of learning have lived to play
practical jokes on teachers, "getting the principal is the most fun,"
observed Cook, 57, and married with two grown children of his own.</TE>
<TE>   He said that being on the losing end is always worth it. Test
scores for reading among third-graders at the school have risen
steadily, from 71% in 1996-97 to 83% last year, though Cook warns
"it's hard to pinpoint" how much can be attributed to his annual bet
with the student body.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from reading a ton, students also adopt the much-anticipated
stunt as the theme for the school year. The bug year they studied
bugs. This year they learned about birds and eggs. In the upper
grades, they calculated how many eggs it would take to adequately
douse the principal.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't build school spirit in a better way," Cook said, "as
icky as it can be for me."</TE>
<TE>   To meet Alan Cook for five minutes is to know that this is a guy
who can take a joke.</TE>
<TE>   Just completing his sixth year at Green Oaks, Cook wanders the
campus each day with wry smile and twinkling eyes behind wire-rim
glasses and a close-cropped, salty beard.</TE>
<TE>   He knows most kids by name. Last week he had a year-end lunch with
some third-graders, who won the honor with enough good deeds to earn
a wad of "Beaver Bucks," named for the school mascot.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, who served in Ethiopia with the Peace Corps and has been an
educator for 35 years, is regarded on campus as approachable, a good
listener, a steady hand--a man of substance who just happens to be
best known for his annual stunts.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just great," said Nena Wilson, a computer technician at the
school and chief tactician for Cook's merciless annual daredevil
routine. "He has great rapport with everyone, and the best interests
of the kids always in mind."</TE>
<TE>   The stunts got rolling in the mid-1990s, when Cook was at an
elementary school in Sacramento. A parent came up with the idea. When
the students enthusiastically met their reading goal, Cook had to run
an obstacle course in a hula skirt.</TE>
<TE>   He carted the idea along to Green Oaks in 1996. The first year,
bugs were on the menu. Cook figured that he might have to eat just a
single beetle. Instead, Wilson and others queried a UC Davis
entomologist and hunted for recipes. The result was a five-course
meal served up on linen and crystal, with a gold lame "barf bucket"
by Cook's side.</TE>
<TE>   "It was gross," Cook said, recalling the crickets wrapped in
bacon, the ground-up mealworms spread on toast like pate.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like using the bucket, but I couldn't in front of all
those kids," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another year, parents heard that Cook hated snakes. Voila! First,
a snake handler was summoned, carting a few innocent reptiles to
Cook's office "to desensitize me," Cook said.</TE>
<TE>   When the fateful day came, Cook's worst expectations were once
again exceeded. Instead of a few garter snakes, he was hoisted into a
glass case and joined by 17 serpents, from tiny corn snakes to a
60-pound python.</TE>
<TE>   "The big ones cuddled up to get warm," Cook recalled, still
squeamish at the thought.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Cook had to overcome another phobia: heights.</TE>
<TE>   With a multipurpose room being built, putting the principal aloft
in a construction equipment basket became the year's goal.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it would be a few minutes," Cook recalled. "They said,
no, it'll be all day."</TE>
<TE>   What will be next year's goal for this performing principal?
Bungee jumping? Something cribbed from reality TV?</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, his chief stunt tormentor, said nothing has been settled,
though she noted that Cook seemed awful nervous around the little
pony that hauled him to the egg dunking.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, however, insisted that he has run out of phobias. And he
rejects anything that could be dangerously replicated by a student
(he refuses to walk on hot coals) or threaten serious bodily injury
to himself.</TE>
<TE>   "The one idea I've refused so far is chasing after greased pigs,"
Cook said. "I'm too old to break a bone."</TE>

<LD>The Mexican consul in Orange County who promoted the acceptance of
Mexican identification cards by local police agencies is leaving his
post.</LD>
<LD>   After three years in the job at the Santa Ana consulate, Miguel
Angel Isidro will leave in August for Quezaltenango, Guatemala. The
transfer is routine, Mexican officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Isidro is credited with improving relations between Mexican
immigrants and police, who frequently turned immigrants taken into
custody over to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. In
some cases, people were deported after minor traffic offenses because
they could not show proof of identity.</LD>

<LD>A third condor chick is believed to have hatched this week in Ventura
County's back country, further demonstrating to biologists that their
recovery efforts for the endangered birds are working.</LD>
<LD>   The egg had been monitored by biologists with the California
Condor Recovery Plan for the last eight weeks and was reportedly
hatched Tuesday near the Sespe Condor Sanctuary of the Los Padres
National Forest, north of Fillmore.</LD>
<LD>   Biologists with the recovery effort want to establish two separate
populations of condors--one in California and one in Arizona, each
with 150 birds and at least 15 breeding pairs.</LD>

<HD>Blaze in San Bernardino Forest Chars 2,500 Acres, 5
Buildings</HD>
<DH>Wildfire: A firefighting training exercise near Arrowhead
Springs may have touched it off. No evacuations or injuries are
reported as 600 battle fast-spreading flames.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A quickly growing wildfire ravaged 2,500-plus acres Friday in the San
Bernardino National Forest, damaging a wing of a 1930s-era hotel and
destroying five small buildings, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze, which erupted about 11:45 a.m. near Waterman Canyon and
California Highway 18, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, may have
been caused by a firefighting training exercise near the Arrowhead
Springs Resort, fire officials said. No injuries or evacuations were
reported by Friday evening.</LD>
<LD>   The flames spread north and east from Arrowhead Springs into the
San Bernardino Mountains, where the towns of Crestline, Twin Peaks,
Bluejay and Skyforest dot the landscape.</LD>
<TE>   "The fire is still burning uphill toward Highway 18 and the
Crestline area," Fran Colwell, a spokesman for the firefighting
operation, said Friday evening. "There's several thousand residents
in that area. But so far there's no immediate reports of injuries or
direct threats to structures."</TE>
<TE>   Six hundred firefighters fought the blaze. The effort included six
air tankers, six helicopters, 22 hand crews and 55 fire engines. For
five hours, Highway 18 was closed to everyone but residents of the
nearby foothill communities, Colwell said. The road reopened about 7
p.m. Authorities could not say when the fire might be controlled.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, the fire caused some damage to the west wing of the
Arrowhead Springs Resort and Conference Center--now a Christian
ministry--and destroyed four adjoining maintenance buildings and a
bath house, Colwell said. No one was injured in the buildings, which
were evacuated in time, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Peters, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry
in San Bernardino County, said the agency was conducting a small
controlled burn in the area before the wildfire broke out.</TE>
<TE>   About 30 minutes after firefighters controlled the small burn,
they noticed a spot fire about 300 feet away, Peters said. "They
immediately called for additional resources," he said. "They tried to
attack it, but it got away."</TE>
<TE>   Peters said a special investigative team has been brought in to
determine what caused the wildfire. "If CDF is found to be
responsible, then we will make good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   From the Cliffhanger Restaurant at an elevation of 5,000 feet on
Arrowhead Mountain, owner Gary Hunsperger described a scene of rising
flames about a mile below and massive air tankers and helicopters
raking the fire. Ashes rained on the deck of the restaurant. "There's
no way it's under control. You can see the flames shoot up, diminish,
then shoot up again," Hunsperger said</TE>

<LD>FBI agents searched San Francisco Assessor Doris Ward's office early
Friday looking for documents that could show whether she used public
funds for her reelection.</LD>
<LD>   Federal and state investigators have been looking into claims that
she signed a city contract worth nearly $50,000 with political
consultant Claude Everhart so she could save money on her campaign
for assessor-recorder. Federal law prohibits the use of taxpayer
funds for electioneering.</LD>
<LD>   About 25 agents with a search warrant shut down the City Hall
office Friday until early afternoon.</LD>

<LD>A man's grandchildren helped land him in jail after they brought
$1,100 in counterfeit money to school.</LD>
<LD>   School officials called police after a 7-year-old girl showed a
handful of $100 bills to classmates, Stanislaus County Sheriff's
Department spokesman Tom Letras said.</LD>
<LD>   The second-grader and her 5-year-old brother told police they took
only a few $100 bills from the pile stored in grandpa's van.</LD>
<TE>   Police said they found Jose Luis Landeras, 42, a few hours later,
stuffing moneymaking material down his pants. He was arrested on
suspicion of making counterfeit money and spending it from Ceres to
Los Banos over the last seven months. Police said they confiscated
$2,000 in phony bills.</TE>

<HD>Online Sex Offender Map Swamped by Hits</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>In its first 24 hours, the city's new Web site showing the
neighborhoods where sex offenders live received nearly 1 million
hits, causing the system to freeze and forcing installation of a
second server, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Although the site does not show specific addresses, it allows
parents and others to see on a map how many sex offenders live in
their communities and the approximate location of their homes.</LD>
<LD>   "We knew there would be tremendous interest, but this exceeded
even our expectations," said Councilman Jim Madaffer.</LD>
<TE>   The map distinguishes between high-risk offenders--those with
multiple offenses and at least one involving violence--and serious
offenders. The former are displayed with red dots, the latter with
orange.</TE>
<TE>   Many residents were shocked at how many offenders live in their
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very scary," said Mary Davison, mother of three children
under age 9, who counted two dozen offenders within a few blocks of
her home.</TE>
<TE>   The Web site only includes information for offenders living within
the city limits. The county Board of Supervisors is preparing a
similar Web site for locations outside the city. That site is
expected to be running by July.</TE>
<TE>   The city Web site is modeled after one used in Fremont in Northern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Under the state's Megan's Law--named for a 7-year-old girl raped
and murdered by a convicted sex offender who lived across the
street--neighborhoods must be notified when an offender moves in.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement agencies have compact discs that can be reviewed
by members of the public, providing specific information about and
pictures of registered sex offenders. But there has been criticism
that the information is not readily available.</TE>
<TE>   The city's Web address is www.SanDiego.gov.</TE>

<HD>Officials Call for More Details on MTA Plan</HD>
<DH>Transit: State senators cite concerns at a hearing on
agency's plan to decentralize bus service. Review by auditor's office
is suggested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concerned about a Metropolitan Transportation Authority plan to
decentralize its bus operations, several state senators Friday called
for more details about what the changes would mean to Los Angeles
residents.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to make sure it improves bus service for the residents
throughout Los Angeles," said Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar) at a
public hearing in San Fernando on the agency's plan to reorganize
into five regional sectors.</LD>
<LD>   Alarcon, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on the MTA and
vice chairman of an audit committee, said a review by the state
auditor's office also would help "make sure the sector plan is
implemented in a way that cuts costs and improves service."</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles) said she was concerned that the
sector plan, due to debut in the San Fernando Valley and the San
Gabriel Valley July 1, would be more costly to taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) said more information was
needed on how the MTA intends to divide its resources among the
regions.</TE>
<TE>   Transit authorities said they did not expect the call for an audit
but did not object.</TE>
<TE>   "An audit might identify where we can make improvements," said
John Catoe, the MTA's deputy chief executive. "It would be a win for
citizens and a win for the agency."</TE>
<TE>   The MTA's sector plan is intended to make the massive agency more
efficient and responsive to the needs of bus riders, officials say.
Already, the MTA has hired five general managers to take charge of
each sector and is moving more than 100 employees from downtown to
the regions.</TE>
<TE>   Introduced by MTA Chief Executive Roger Snoble in December, the
sector proposal would give each region more control over bus
scheduling and routes. It came as separate groups in the San Fernando
and San Gabriel valleys were completing plans to break from the MTA
and form independent transit zones, an idea opposed by organized
labor.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, union leaders told the senators and representatives for
other state officials that they were skeptical of the sector plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel the same or better efficiencies would be realized without
sectors or zones," said Neil Silver, president of Amalgamated Transit
Union.</TE>
<TE>   James Adams, president of Local 3634 of the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees, criticized the MTA for
eliminating some supervisory jobs and having those employees apply
for higher-paying but nonunion positions.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's not union-busting, it's close to it," Adams said.</TE>
<TE>   Others who spoke at the hearing said they would like to see the
sector plan lead to better service.</TE>
<TE>   The new sectors should "be more inclusive for people with
disabilities," said Kurt Baldwin, an advocate for the Independent
Living Center of Southern California in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   People who use wheelchairs, for instance, sometimes complain of
bus drivers who do not stop to pick them up, Baldwin said.</TE>
<TE>   Bart Reed, executive director of the Transit Coalition, a
nonprofit advocacy organization, said bus riders "have major route
gaps in the northeast San Fernando Valley."</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, Reed added, "we keep going up in population
but we keep losing services."</TE>
<TE>   Before the hearing, Alarcon held a news conference at which he
said he is proposing legislation that, if the Valley secedes from Los
Angeles, would place the mayor of an independent San Fernando Valley
on the MTA board.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon has said he is considering running for mayor of an
independent Valley.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Plan to Guard Water From Sabotage Unveiled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles officials Friday announced a five-year, $132-million plan
to protect the city's water supply from terrorist sabotage, saying
they want to be vigilant although there have been no specific threats
against local water facilities.</LD>
<LD>   "We have decided that what we needed to do was to harden the
targets, and we've done that by increasing security," Mayor James K.
Hahn said at a news conference in front of the Silver Lake reservoir.</LD>
<LD>   The security measures, which are being paid for by the Department
of Water and Power, include increasing aerial and ground patrols and
adding barriers, sensors and alarms along reservoirs, treatment
plants and storage facilities.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, the DWP will continue expanded testing of the city's
water supply that began after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, hundreds of water samples from dozens of points along
the system have been tested each day for possible contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be the safest water system in the country," said David
Wiggs, general manager of the DWP.</TE>
<TE>   The measures were developed in part by security consultant Rick
Hahn, a former FBI agent who was hired by the DWP last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Gewe, the DWP's assistant general manager for water,
emphasized that the announcement Friday did not result from "any
immediate threat or any known threat upon our water supply."</TE>
<TE>   "However, general threats to the country at large ... cause us to
take a long-term approach to protecting the safety of our water," he
said.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush nodded along to the Duke Ellington classic "Take the
'A' Train" Friday as he marked Black Music Month by inviting a black
high school choir to sing at the White House.</LD>
<LD>   Joined by his wife, Laura, Bush heard a string of songs, including
signature Ellington hits such as "Mood Indigo" and "It Don't Mean a
Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)," sung by students from the Duke
Ellington School of the Arts, a Washington high school that focuses
on urban youth.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking to a largely black audience in the White House East Room,
Bush paid tribute to black music from spirituals and gospel to jazz
and the blues.</LD>
<TE>   "The spirituals always had that power to move, and they always
will. The people who first sang them...knew the worst of human
cruelty and earthly injustice," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the black American experience, there has been a lot of pain
... America must recognize that."</TE>

<HD>Detroit's Casinos Leave Some Locals Feeling Spent</HD>
<DH>Tax revenue is up, but critics point out costs borne by the
working poor</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH FRAMMOLINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Rudy and Betty Pritchett, husband-and-wife auto workers, loved
gambling at the three downtown casinos so much they were spending up
to $6,000 a year playing the rows of clanging, flashing slot
machines.</LD>
<LD>   Then a few months ago they decided they had to ease up.</LD>
<LD>   "We're just trying to slowly get away from it," said Rudy, a
52-year-old crane operator. The couple now sets the slot money aside
for retirement. But every once in a while, the Pritchetts give in to
the urge and sneak back to the casinos with $200 to try their luck.</LD>
<TE>   "It's addictive," he's said in the past.</TE>
<TE>   For good or ill, Detroit, like the Pritchetts, is hooked on casino
gambling. After the first Las Vegas-style casino opened in 1999, a
veritable gold rush of retirees, suburbanites and factory workers has
transformed this declining auto capital into one of the hottest
gambling spots in the country. And since Sept. 11, business has only
gotten better.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the casinos tallied their first month of more than $100
million in revenues; the total dipped to $97.1 million in April, but
it was still 25% ahead of last year. Gamblers here spend more per
slot machine or table position ($337) than their counterparts on the
famed Las Vegas Strip ($204) or Atlantic City ($271), according to
statistics compiled by Bear Stearns.</TE>
<TE>   But what makes Detroit's casinos unique are the people losing the
bets, experts say. While cities like Vegas get rich from tourists who
spend money and then leave, casinos here are raking it in from a
steady clientele who live in the area, said William R. Eadington, a
University of Nevada-Reno economics professor and commercial gaming
authority.</TE>
<TE>   "Detroit is the first city that established land-based casinos
primarily for metropolitan residents within the city core," said
Eadington. "This is America's first true experience with urban
casinos."</TE>
<TE>   The results have been mixed. Detroit reaps huge benefits--$113
million in annual wagering taxes, more than 8,000 service jobs, a
24-hour night life--but also pays the price of social fallout.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick and City Council members are locked in a
feud over how much to tax the casinos--a fight that is delaying plans
for the gaming houses to build luxury hotel rooms in time for the
2006 Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Kilpatrick ticks off the human costs the city is
dealing with as part of the casinos' success. "Despair, depression,
bankruptcy.... All those things are negative fallouts of casinos," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Locals received an unsettling lesson two years ago when an
off-duty police officer ended a losing streak at a MotorCity Casino
blackjack table by shooting himself in the head.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Gamblers Anonymous groups here have multiplied. The
state's Gaming Control Board has signed up 155 gaming addicts who
agree to a lifetime casino ban or face prison.</TE>
<TE>   Less dramatic anecdotes abound about how casino gambling is
gobbling up the paychecks of the working poor, leading to multiple
home refinancings, foreclosures and unpaid bills. Surveying the
frantic Greektown Casino crowd one recent night, a local surgeon saw
the evidence in the crumpled bills crossing the blackjack tables.</TE>
<TE>   "When you see them taking money out of their pockets and it is
wadded up, it isn't money they intended to bet," said the surgeon,
who asked not to be identified. "I think it's the worst thing that
could happen to the city of Detroit."</TE>
<TE>   The city's love-hate relationship with gaming goes back decades.
Since 1976, voters had steadfastly refused to allow casino gambling
in the urban area.</TE>
<TE>   That changed in 1996, when Michiganders barely approved a
statewide casino measure after watching residents stampede across the
river to gamble at a Windsor casino.</TE>
<TE>   "People saw the world wasn't going to end," said Jack C. Barthwell
III of the MotorCity Casino. "When they saw the lines going across
the bridge and tunnel, they kind of said, 'Well, it's here....'"</TE>
<TE>   Resignation morphed into excitement when the MGM Grand Detroit
opened in 1999 in an abandoned Internal Revenue Service building. A
few months later, the MotorCity debuted in an old Wonder Bread
factory. In 2000, Greektown opened in a building used by fur trappers
in the mid-1800s.</TE>
<TE>   The casinos have tapped the wealth of surrounding suburbs and
drawn well-heeled seniors living as far away as Toledo, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   But what has kept them humming around the clock are the factory
workers. Many show up in work clothes, like Bill, 39, a single father
of three. Eyeing the craps table at the MGM Grand Detroit, Bill, who
didn't want his last name used, said he hits the casinos twice a week
after his shift at the Ford truck plant ends at 2:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I get off work, I come down here for a couple of hours
and then I pick up my kids," he said. He became a casino regular a
year ago after his wife left him. "It helps get my mind off stuff,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rudy Pritchett, the crane operator, used to wear a United Auto
Workers hat on the casino floors, where he and his wife spent about
4% of their combined $151,000 annual salary on slot machines such as
the "Sizzling Sevens."</TE>
<TE>   Then they had an epiphany. "We had it to spend, but it doesn't
make sense going there and spending it," said Pritchett. The couple
is now saving the money to buy retirement property in Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   The casinos have picked up new customers since the terrorist
attacks. Memories of long border waits continue to deter players such
as 56-year-old Regina Love from gambling in Windsor.</TE>
<TE>   Love, a retired elementary school teacher, used to gamble in
Canadian bingo halls five times a week until cab drivers on both
sides of the border refused such fares. Now she plays nickel slots in
Detroit three times a week. The cost: about 25% of her monthly
pension check.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the idea now that you can come out of your house late at
night and have somewhere to go," Love said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the new revenues from the casinos, civic bliss remains
elusive in Detroit. Officials are worried about a recent federal
appeals court ruling that the way they awarded the gaming franchises
violated the constitutional rights of Michigan's smallest Indian
tribe, the Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewas. A judge
is considering the tribe's request that one or more of the franchises
be rebid.</TE>
<TE>   City officials are also fighting over how much to demand from the
casinos. Besides $81.6 million in annual state taxes, the gaming
houses pay the nearly $113 million yearly--enough to reduce the
corporate income tax.</TE>
<TE>   Now some want even more, taking issue with the mayor's plan to let
the casinos out of an earlier pact to move to the riverfront and
build 2,400 luxury hotel rooms. Kilpatrick has proposed allowing the
casinos to stay put and build half the number of hotel rooms. In
return, the casinos will give the city a $102-million gift and
riverfront land worth $150 million.</TE>
<TE>   On May 31, however, council members voted to veto the plan, 6 to
3, making good on their threat to block casino development unless the
gaming houses fork over tens of millions of dollars more. They've
drawn up a wish list: creating a minority business development fund,
renovating city recreation centers and paying college tuition for
every public school kid.</TE>
<TE>   Council members' demands are based on reports that casinos here
make annual returns of 63%, nearly four times the gaming industry
average, said Council President Maryann Mahaffey. She said they also
reflect a growing grass-roots disenchantment, one in which people
want to see more for the money they're losing.</TE>
<TE>   "When I go around to block clubs and community councils, what I
hear regularly is 'Stick to your guns,'" said Mahaffey, who has
pushed for more casino concessions. " 'We know how much money they're
taking out of the city. They owe us more.'"</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Boxes of files from Florida's troubled child welfare agency,
including confidential child abuse cases, were included in a public
auction and bought for $5 by a television reporter.</LD>
<LD>   The files, contained in boxes marked "shred," were among items
taken from a building the Department of Children &amp; Families used
until February 2001. The items were put up for public auction
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Reporter Mike Deeson said he ended up with thousands of pages of
case files, abuse reports, pay stubs from parents and even
psychiatric evaluations. His television station, CBS affiliate WTSP,
did not broadcast information from the files.</LD>
<TE>   Department spokeswoman Shawnna Donovan said the agency did not
authorize the auctioneer to offer the files. "We had no agreement in
writing," Donovan said.</TE>
<TE>   The sale was suspended several hours after it started once the
agency realized unauthorized items were being sold.</TE>
<TE>   The auction was just the latest blunder to plague the state
agency. In April, a 5-year-old girl was reported missing more than a
year after her caretaker said she was taken by people the woman
thought were state workers.</TE>

<HD>Goodwin, Amid Flap, Quits Pulitzer Board</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, who has faced accusations of
plagiarism over a 1987 book, has resigned from the Pulitzer Prize
board, Columbia University announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to board Chairman John Carroll, Goodwin said: "After
the controversy earlier this year surrounding my book, 'The
Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys,' and the need now to concentrate on my
Lincoln manuscript, I will not be able to give the board the kind of
attention it deserves."</LD>
<LD>   Goodwin, who joined the board in 1999, won a Pulitzer for her 1995
book "No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home
Front in World War II."</LD>
<TE>   In January, as journalists probed the biographies and works of
several high-profile historians, she acknowledged that "The
Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys" contained sections of text taken
without attribution to another author.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin said the copying was accidental, the result of a longhand
note-taking system that didn't distinguish between her own
observations and passages from other texts.</TE>
<TE>   Both she and the author, Lynne McTaggart, said they had reached a
settlement years earlier that included an undisclosed payment and
revisions to Goodwin's book.</TE>
<TE>   A woman who answered the phone at Goodwin's Concord, Mass., home
said Goodwin was traveling and had no further comment.</TE>
<TE>   Since her admission, Goodwin has taken a leave from PBS' "Newshour
with Jim Lehrer," where she had been making regular appearances, and
some universities rescinded speaking invitations. She also withdrew
from this year's Pulitzer Prize judging in April.</TE>
<TE>   In accepting Goodwin's resignation, Carroll, editor of the Los
Angeles Times, wrote: "We have valued you as a colleague and
appreciate your contributions over the past three years."</TE>
<TE>   The Pulitzers, American journalism's most prestigious prizes, are
administered by Columbia University.</TE>
<TE>   Seymour Topping, the administrator of the prizes, said Carroll
consulted with others on the 17-member board before accepting
Goodwin's resignation, which was effective Friday.</TE>
<TE>   An inquiry being conducted on the plagiarism charge "is now moot,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Elected members of the Pulitzer board serve a maximum of nine
years and stand for reelection every three years.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin, who was in her fourth year, had been reelected in
November 2001.</TE>

<HD>Photos of Lindh Ordered Destroyed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>The federal government acknowledged Friday that an untold number of
U.S. military service members took "souvenir" photographs of John
Walker Lindh during the first days of his captivity, but it added
that the images were destroyed because they were taken without
military approval.</LD>
<LD>   Randy L. Bellows, an assistant U.S. attorney, made the
acknowledgment during a hearing in federal court here in which
Lindh's defense attorneys had hoped to obtain copies of the
photographs and videos. The defense sought to use them as potential
evidence that Lindh was intimidated and coerced into making allegedly
incriminating statements to U.S. authorities after he was captured
late last year fighting for the Taliban in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Bellows said the unauthorized photographs and videos were taken
when Lindh, a 21-year-old from Northern California, was brought
aboard the Peleliu in December. At that time, Lindh was being roundly
derided in the United States as the so-called American Talib soldier
who had betrayed his country and gone to Afghanistan to work on
behalf of the Al Qaeda terrorist network.</LD>
<TE>   Aboard the ship, he was kept in irons, blindfolded and strapped to
a gurney--all of which made him stand out as a prize captive for the
U.S. in the early phases of the war on terror.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, George C. Harris, one of his defense attorneys, said
government prosecutors have been told by the chief master of arms of
the Peleliu that Lindh was in horrible shape when he arrived on
board.</TE>
<TE>   "He immediately noticed Mr. Lindh couldn't walk without aid, that
he was taken aboard in a wheelchair, and he passed out," Harris said.
"He was dehydrated and he was given an IV."</TE>
<TE>   Lindh was held on the ship from Dec. 14-31.</TE>
<TE>   It was there that a Navy doctor removed a bullet that had struck
Lindh while he was fighting with the Taliban against the Northern
Alliance in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   During this time on the ship, and earlier too, Lindh made a number
of statements to U.S. officials, allegedly about his activities as a
Taliban soldier and his alleged connection to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Those statements are at the heart of the government's case. But
the defense is arguing that they should be excluded from his trial in
August because he was coerced, in poor shape and was intimidated by
the U.S. military.</TE>
<TE>   Bellows said about 300 authorized photographs and videos were
taken of Lindh aboard the ship, but that the images made by
individual service members were not approved by the ship's executive
officer.</TE>
<TE>   Bellows said all of the photos and videos were destroyed, along
with as many as a dozen cameras.</TE>
<TE>   But he denied that the individual service members were mocking
Lindh as a trophy captive.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing going on that was nefarious," Bellows said.
"These were just not authorized, and that's why they were destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   But Harris intimated that the photos and videos were all part of a
harassment campaign to force Lindh into talking. "It shows
mistreatment and intimidation," the defense lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III pressed Harris on whether he
had any evidence that Lindh was purposely intimidated. Harris
responded that the defense simply wanted to learn exactly how their
client was treated.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to know if similar things happened," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On another matter, both sides agreed that 30 service members who
took statements from Lindh or made written observations about his
condition in captivity can be interviewed by defense attorneys.</TE>

<HD>Activists Ask Halt to Makah Whaling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TACOMA, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Anti-whaling activists have asked a federal appeals court to
temporarily halt gray whale hunting by the Makah tribe.</LD>
<LD>   Tribal officials said they would not issue any whaling permits
until Friday, when a ruling on the motion is expected from the U.S.
9th Circuit Court of Appeals.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Franklin D. Burgess denied
the activists' request for a similar preliminary injunction, citing
the rights of the Makah to hunt whales under an 1855 treaty.</LD>
<TE>   The Fund for Animals, the Humane Society of the United States and
other groups contend that Makah whaling will endanger the safety of
people and the lives of "resident" gray whales that remain in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca during the summer after most of the herd has
migrated north.</TE>
<TE>   They also contend that whaling management policies violate the
National Environmental Policy Act and the Marine Mammal Protection
Act.</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit addressing those claims is awaiting a decision in
federal district court.</TE>
<TE>   If the appeals court grants the injunction, which was filed
Thursday, the Makah would be barred from taking any whales until the
court could consider the merits of the activists' claims.</TE>
<TE>   "In our [legal] system, they unfortunately get to do everything
all over again," Makah attorney John Arum said of the new motion.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of never stops," he said. "This is the last stop for
them, we hope."</TE>
<TE>   The Makah moved to resume whaling after gray whales were taken off
the Endangered Species List in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Makah hunters have killed one whale since, in May 1999.</TE>

<HD>Cardinal Meets Suspect in Shooting, Vows Help</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Cardinal William Keeler met with the man accused of shooting a priest
and assured him he would push for a zero-tolerance policy toward
sexual abuse of children in the Roman Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no place in the ministry of our church for anyone who
would put a child in danger," Keeler said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The cardinal met for 90 minutes on Thursday with Dontee Stokes,
the 26-year-old Baltimore man who told police he shot Father Maurice
Blackwell on May 13 because he had been molested by the priest years
earlier. He faces attempted murder charges.</LD>
<TE>   "I apologized for the pain that he has suffered, and to him I
renewed the offer of the archdiocese to assist with the counseling
that, appropriately, he may require," Keeler said.</TE>
<TE>   Keeler also told Stokes he would try to enact the policy at a
conference of the nation's bishops in June in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting between Stokes and the cardinal took place at the home
of Stokes' aunt, where Stokes has been under house arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Keeler said he found Stokes to be a thoughtful person and ended
the meeting with a prayer. Stokes' mother and his attorney also were
at the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Tamara Stokes said she told Keeler she is angry that Blackwell has
not been defrocked. "I think he should pay for what he did to my son
and to all the other people that are out here coming forward," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Keeler previously apologized to the Stokes family for reinstating
Blackwell after Stokes accused him of sexual abuse in 1993. Blackwell
was stripped of his duties five years later, after he admitted to
another sexual relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Stokes' attorney, Warren Brown, described the meeting as "aid to a
wounded soul." He said he would take the church up on the offer to
provide counseling for Stokes.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nine Supreme Court justices are richer than all but a small
percentage of Americans, with at least five millionaires among them.</LD>
<LD>   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the wealthiest member of the high
court, according to financial disclosure reports released Friday. She
has held that honor in past years as well. She's worth from $7.7
million to $33.7 million.</LD>
<LD>   Justice Clarence Thomas, as in the past, is worth the least on
paper. He reported holdings of $150,000 to $410,000, not counting his
home in Virginia.</LD>
<TE>   Thomas noted that a family friend gave him a Bible that once was
owned by Frederick Douglass, worth an estimated $19,000. The American
Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington think tank, gave him
a bust of Abraham Lincoln worth about $15,000.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist earns about $192,000 annually;
the other justices make about $184,000. They are appointed for life.
The new reports cover 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Like many other government employees, the justices must account
publicly for income beyond their salaries and list stocks or other
holdings that potentially could influence them on the job.</TE>

<HD>EPA Says Toxic Chemicals Pose Added Cancer Risk</HD>
<DH>Health: For millions of Americans, many of them living in
California, the danger is 100 times greater than acceptable levels,
study shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The first nationwide study of 32 common toxic chemicals shows that
for 20 million Americans--many of them living in the Los Angeles and
San Francisco Bay areas--the pollutants pose a cancer risk 100 times
greater than what the Environmental Protection Agency usually
considers acceptable.</LD>
<LD>   The data released Friday suggest that 200 million Americans face a
1 in 100,000 lifetime risk of developing cancer from these
pollutants, while the risk posed to residents of Los Angeles and the
Bay Area was as high as 1 in 5,000.</LD>
<LD>   "This should not be viewed as a major cause of alarm," Jeff
Holmstead, an EPA assistant administrator, said of the agency's
study. "The average cancer risk to someone in the United States is
roughly 1 in 3."</LD>
<TE>   So these toxins represent "a very small portion of the overall
cancer risk," he said.</TE>
<TE>   EPA pollution-reduction programs typically target sources that
cause cancer risks of between 1 in a million and 100 in a million,
Holmstead said.</TE>
<TE>   Cars, trucks and other mobile sources of pollution emit about half
of these toxic contaminants, the most dangerous of which include
benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehide and butadiene. Most of the rest
comes from natural sources, such as forest fires, or from industrial
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists urged the EPA to consider the data a call to
action.</TE>
<TE>   "Many millions of people are exposed to levels of cancer-causing
chemicals in the air they breathe at levels far higher than EPA
considers acceptable," said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of
Clean Air Trust, an environmental group that tracks air policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The study adds urgency to EPA's efforts to address the problem of
toxic air pollution head-on," said Emily Figdor, a clean air advocate
for U.S. Public Interest Research Group, an environmental group.
"This is a long overlooked public health problem."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, O'Donnell said, the data underline the need for the
agency to regulate the emissions of vehicles that don't operate on
the highways, such as construction equipment, which spew a
disproportionately large amount of pollutants into the air.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous studies since the 1980s have linked chemicals in
California air pollution to cancer and other heath hazards. Voters
approved Proposition 65 in 1986 requiring manufacturers of products
containing toxic chemicals to notify people whenever they were being
exposed.</TE>
<TE>   In a comprehensive study in Southern California three years ago,
air quality officials found that toxic air pollution posed an
excessive cancer risk for millions of people in the Los Angeles
region. For every million residents, about 1,200 to 1,400 were at
risk of contracting cancer from hazardous air pollutants, ranking
dirty air as one of the most dangerous environmental health hazards.</TE>
<TE>   Communities such as Pico Rivera, Huntington Park and San Pedro had
some of the highest levels of air toxins, although toxic air
pollution is worse--and the risk greater--typically along major
freeways, including the Santa Ana Freeway between downtown Los
Angeles and Orange County and along the Long Beach Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that diesel exhaust from buses and trucks
constituted about 71% of the hazard; other vehicles accounted for
about 20% of the harmful emissions; and refineries and factories made
up the balance. Toxic air pollutants are chemicals that not only make
the sky dirty but can cause cancer, reproductive damage and
neurological impairment.</TE>
<TE>   Holmstead said the EPA study shows that on-road and off-road
vehicles contributed roughly equal amounts to the cancer risk.</TE>
<TE>   The data used in the study were collected by states in 1996, and
EPA officials said new regulations implemented as a result of the
1990 Clean Air Act amendments should be reducing emissions of these
toxic chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Holmstead said the study represents an
"extraordinarily ambitious analytical effort" and said the EPA would
attempt to release new data every three years.</TE>
<TE>   The assessment does not include results for dioxins, compounds
that contribute significantly to cancer risks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the study's limitations, EPA officials said the data would
help them decide which sources of air pollution should be targeted
for greater reductions.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a very powerful tool for us," said Bill Wehurm, an EPA
attorney. "It can help show us where we can get the most bang for the
buck; where emissions reductions are going to make the greatest
benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Holmstead said it was too early to say which sources of pollution
would face tighter regulations as a result of this data.</TE>
<TE>   Holmstead also stressed that when the EPA estimates cancer risks,
it uses the high end of a range of risk at a given exposure level.</TE>
<TE>   The data also assessed non-cancer health risks posed by the
pollutants.</TE>
<TE>   Many of them cause adverse effects in humans or animals by
irritating the lining of the respiratory system, the study said.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly the entire U.S. population, the so-called hazard index
for respiratory effects exceeded 1, which indicates a potential may
exist for adverse health effects. For 20 million Americans, including
those in the L.A. and Bay areas, this hazard index exceeded 10.</TE>
<TE>   EPA researchers spent years working on the study, and the data it
contained were complicated. EPA posted the information on its Web
site late Friday without prior notice and did not hold a news
conference to explain it.</TE>
<TE>   "It does create the appearance that they were trying to bury the
information," O'Donnell said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration wants to give industry more leeway in how
it cleans up its air emissions. It has unveiled a plan to reduce
emissions of three major pollutants from power plants with a trading
system that would give polluters financial incentives to cut
emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists have criticized the plan, saying it would not be
as effective at cleaning up the air as an aggressive application of
current air pollution laws.</TE>
<TE>   The administration also has been criticized for reversing a
campaign pledge to cut power plant emissions of carbon dioxide, which
most scientists agree is the major man-made contributor to global
warming.</TE>
<TE>   EPA officials said the health risk posed by the toxics covered in
the new study pales compared to the risk caused by emissions of
sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides, a large proportion of which come
from power plants and vehicles. The fine particulates cause thousands
of early deaths from heart disease and lung disease.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Television newsman Rick Jacobs doesn't like to use cliches, but all
he could think was "surreal movie" as he watched the live feed of an
Air Force Reserve helicopter smashing into Mt. Hood during a dramatic
rescue attempt Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Jacobs, assistant news director at the KGW-TV newsroom in
Portland, Ore., was in the newsroom as the helicopter hit the icy
summit and rolled 1,000 feet down the mountain, flinging several of
the crew into the snow. The scene went live to thousands of local
viewers and later was seen by millions nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   "It was absolutely surreal and happened so fast we didn't really
have time to react," Jacobs said Friday. The crash happened as the
helicopter was attempting to rescue six climbers who had fallen into
a crevasse on the mountain. Three other climbers in the group were
killed in the fall.</LD>
<TE>   The helicopter--a 20,000-pound Pave Hawk trying to pick up the
injured climbers--appeared to lose lift in the thin mountain air.</TE>
<TE>   As Jacobs and the others watched, KGW reporter Pat Dooris was
aboard the station's helicopter and reporting live: "Oh, fellas, oh
Lord." he said. "I wish this were just a movie."</TE>
<TE>   Back in the newsroom "it was a whole lot like 9/11," Jacobs said.
"It happened slowly. There were all these gasps when it hit, then we
all knew that something horrible was happening. There were all these
bodies all over the place."</TE>
<TE>   Dooris had been providing live coverage for more than two hours
when the accident happened. His helicopter was three miles away
because of safety restrictions. "I just had this feeling of horror,"
he said. "I really thought those guys were going to die."</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs said it is station policy not to show violent live footage,
but it did not have time to cut away from the crash. KGW refrained
from airing replays until it was confirmed that none of the
helicopter's occupants had been killed. Three of the six crew members
were hurt, but none seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "We just thought it was unbelievable that everyone had survived,"
Jacobs said.</TE>

<HD>Former Archbishop Accused of Abuse Apologizes for Scandal</HD>
<DH>Clergy: Rembert Weakland admits settlement may be seen as
'hush money.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Former Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland apologized Friday and
begged for forgiveness for the scandal caused by a $450,000
settlement with a man who accused him of sexual assault.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at a prayer service, Weakland acknowledged an
"inappropriate relationship" decades ago with a 30-year-old theology
student. He said he agreed to the settlement because he feared
bringing embarrassment to himself and the church.</LD>
<LD>   In hindsight, Weakland said, he understood how it could appear to
be "hush money."</LD>
<TE>   "I apologize to all the faithful of the archdiocese, which I love
so much, to all its people and clergy for the scandal that has
occurred because of my sinfulness," Weakland said during the
20-minute service at the Mater Christi Chapel in suburban Milwaukee.
It was the first time he has spoken publicly about the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The Milwaukee Archdiocese in 1998 paid the settlement to Paul
Marcoux, who was a student at Marquette University when he accused
Weakland of sexually assaulting him in 1979. Weakland has denied ever
abusing anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Since the clergy sex-abuse crisis erupted in January, Weakland is
the highest-ranking U.S. cleric to acknowledge settling a sexual
misconduct allegation against him.</TE>
<TE>   Weakland said Friday that he understood the settlement to be
compensation for Marcoux, who claimed that the former archbishop had
interfered with his ability to earn income. He said he agreed to the
settlement rather than spend money fighting the claim.</TE>
<TE>   "One of my fears in not accepting the settlement was the prospect
of scandal and embarrassment for myself and for the church," Weakland
said. "For that lack of courage, I apologize."</TE>
<TE>   The former archbishop also apologized to Marcoux "for any harm
done him."</TE>
<TE>   Marcoux, now 54, couldn't be reached for comment Friday night. He
has said he was drunk when Weakland tried to assault him in 1979,
adding that he did not go to the police because two priests advised
against it.</TE>
<TE>   Weakland's 25-year tenure ended when the Vatican accepted his
resignation May 24, a day after he acknowledged paying the
settlement. He reached the mandatory retirement age of 75 in April.</TE>
<TE>   "People who are concerned about me ask how I feel at this moment.
The best nouns to describe those feelings would be remorse,
contrition, shame and emptiness," Weakland said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese said the $450,000 came from its real estate and
property fund, which has been used since 1995 for lawsuit
settlements, including those dealing with pedophile priests.</TE>
<TE>   Weakland said last week that his earnings from speeches more than
covered any settlement amount, but he said Friday he had been told
that was not the case.</TE>
<TE>   "In my remaining years, I will continue to contribute to the
archdiocese whatever I can, and, of course, the archdiocese will
receive whatever effects I own on my death," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After his speech, the audience stood and applauded for 90 seconds
as Weakland knelt before the altar, his back to them.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Noll, 77, of Milwaukee, said he cried as he listened. "It was
to the point and honest." Weakland started an innovative program 12
years ago giving support to priest abuse victims and treatment for
offenders.</TE>
<TE>   This spring he accepted the recommendation of a commission he
appointed that the church adopt a zero-tolerance policy against
sexual abuse by priests.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Nuyttens, 51, said before the service that she thought
Weakland was apologizing only because of media coverage of his case.
"He lied to us. He cheated us." As she spoke, 80-year-old Jean
Iczkowski interrupted: "It is very nice to forgive people."</TE>

<HD>At West Point, New Breed of Cadet</HD>
<DH>Military: Since Sept. 11, grads have a clearer sense of

<DL>WEST POINT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>When President Bush today addresses the first students to graduate
from West Point since Sept. 11, he will encounter a class of cadets
who have flocked to a new course on terrorism and are clamoring to
join the infantry.</LD>
<LD>   Their shifting interests underscore what is described as a new
clarity of mission at the U.S. Military Academy, whose students were
compelled to stay close by their books as the World Trade Center
crumbled an hour's drive away and have since watched recent graduates
return from Afghanistan with stories of a war in which the Army took
center stage.</LD>
<LD>   Professors and student-soldiers alike describe the class of 2002,
an especially bright group that won a record number of graduate
scholarships, as closer and more serious than its predecessors.</LD>
<TE>   What has changed is the mood of an institution whose students feel
a renewed sense of the vulnerability of their homeland that inspired
the academy's creation by President Thomas Jefferson in 1802.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we know what our objective is," said graduating Cadet David
Chang, 22, of Sacramento. "We're all saying, 'Let's roll.'"</TE>
<TE>   "It's changed the way I look at my job," said Stacy Gervelis, 21,
of Seattle, whose first assignment as a military police officer in
Heidelberg, Germany, begins in September. "I think everybody here
takes things more seriously. It makes you look closer at preparing
yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Instructors say the cadets show a focus they have not seen since
at least the Persian Gulf War. Students are asking harder questions
about what they'll be doing when they leave and are making bolder
choices, academy officials say. A sharply higher proportion of this
year's graduates is choosing infantry over such options as
intelligence or artillery.</TE>
<TE>   One hallmark of the current war has been the decisive role played
by American foot soldiers, the infantrymen whose role in recent years
had been eclipsed by air power and other elements of the war machine.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get the idea here that these kids are going to avoid
the hard stuff," said Col. Russ Howard, head of the academy's social
sciences department.</TE>
<TE>   Howard and another West Point professor have co-written a new
terrorism textbook that is being rushed into print.</TE>
<TE>   The strong public support for the war on terrorism sharply
contrasts with the ambivalence or opposition toward the Vietnam War,
as was noted during class reunions on the grounds of the hallowed
institution this week.</TE>
<TE>   Several alums noted that they faced a more controversial
battleground in Vietnam, uncertainty about their support and about
the leaders who sent them there.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the youngsters find it exciting now that we've got a
sense of mission," said Brig. Gen. Daniel J. Kaufman, dean of West
Point's academic board and a 1968 graduate and Vietnam veteran.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly now the world is a much more dangerous place," he said.
"The nation is at risk again. The notion that the American homeland
is vulnerable is new to all of us. Given where we sit--50 miles from
ground zero--there is a sense of immediacy there."</TE>
<TE>   They are buoyed by public support for soldiers that has been
unprecedented in their lifetimes. Tomi Krmpotich, a 22-year-old
graduating cadet from Bellingham, Wash., recalled the screams from a
line of young girls as he and his fellow cadets visited Ellis Island
recently.</TE>
<TE>   "The cheers we got in the line to the ferry were so passionate
that one of the security guards said, 'You guys are the new
Beatles,'" recalled Krmpotich, whose next assignment is in Germany.
"I hope that doesn't sound conceited, sir. But that's such a nice
change."</TE>
<TE>   Said classmate Chang: "I guess they do see the future in our
hands. It's very reassuring that we're not alone, and very different
for us than for those who graduated and went to Vietnam."</TE>
<TE>   The class of 2002 will begin active duty as second lieutenants
with a five-year commitment to military service and an education that
emphasizes a military history dominated by the "long, gray line" of
past graduates, from the commanders of both sides in the Civil
War--Gens. Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant--to Desert Storm
commander Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf. Before West Point was an academy,
it was a military fortification during the Revolutionary War, created
in 1778 by Gen. George Washington, who made it his headquarters a
year later.</TE>
<TE>   Now the cadets can learn from a more contemporary breed of
officer, such as 30-year-old alumnus Jason Amerine. He is a Green
Beret captain whose team led Hamid Karzai, now Afghanistan's interim
prime minister, to victory in southern regions of that country and is
now returning to West Point to study and teach.</TE>
<TE>   Curriculum changes took effect in January. The academy, which
halved its language requirements in 1989, has restored and added
language and culture class requirements for most students, reflecting
the growing likelihood that young soldiers will find themselves
overseas.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-terrorism course taught by Capt. Reid Sawyer began in the
second term and attracted overflow enrollment in one of the academy's
largest classrooms, on a campus of stone buildings that look as if
they were carved out of the granite that lines the Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer and co-author Howard can now be found cloistered in their
offices, banging out the final draft of "Terrorism and
Counterterrorism: Understanding the New Security Environment." The
book traces the history of state-sponsored conflicts and how they
evolved into what military parlance terms "asymmetrical threats"--or
nongovernmental enemies such as Al Qaeda--and what the military can
do to stop them.</TE>
<TE>   The book is likely to be read by students outside of West Point as
well. Half an hour after the book was announced on the publisher's
Web site, McGraw-Hill had fielded 36 inquiries. But Howard expects
continued interest on his campus next year from cadets looking for a
glimpse of their own future.</TE>
<TE>   "They know within nine months they'll have an opportunity to be
out there," he said.</TE>

<HD>Operation Enduring Payouts</HD>
<DH>War: The CIA has shelled out millions in the search for Bin
Laden. Critics wince.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>PESHAWAR, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Sitting on lawn furniture inside the screened-in porch of a Peshawar
safe house, the CIA officer made his pitch bluntly to Haji Mohammed
Zaman.</LD>
<LD>   Was he prepared to kill Al Qaeda Arabs? the American asked. Zaman,
a powerful warlord from eastern Afghanistan, nodded. With that, the
operative handed him $10,000 in cash and a sleek hand-held Thuraya
satellite telephone.</LD>
<LD>   "Is that all?" Zaman demanded angrily, according to a senior
Western diplomat who witnessed the exchange in November, as Taliban
forces were collapsing in Afghanistan. "Is that all you give to
someone who knows where to find Osama bin Laden?"</LD>
<TE>   The answer, clearly, is no. No one has yet snagged the Bush
administration's $25-million "dead or alive" bounty on Bin Laden. But
a senior intelligence official in Washington says America's spy
service has distributed "tens of millions of dollars" in cash since
last fall in the effort to find him, as well as in other covert
operations.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA's small army of operatives often has worked less like
James Bond than like bagmen, handing out bundles of $100 bills--often
with sequential serial numbers--to purchase intelligence and support.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the money bought less than complete loyalty. Sometimes
the Americans bought bogus information. And some officials question
whether the practice is counterproductive in the long run.</TE>
<TE>   "All money does is buy you information," explained a Capitol Hill
staffer familiar with the operation. "It doesn't necessarily buy you
reliable information."</TE>
<TE>   But other officials say the CIA payoffs played a critical role in
persuading commanders from the Northern Alliance and other opposition
groups to provide proxy fighters last fall to help oust the Taliban
and search for Al Qaeda members.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you can do more with $100 bills than with bullets,"
said the intelligence official, who, in keeping with his agency's
policy, spoke on condition of anonymity. "And if we can rent guys to
help, that's fine."</TE>
<TE>   The going rate, other officials said, was $100,000 for warlords;
far less for lower-ranking commanders, village elders and the like.
Generous cash payments also encouraged some Taliban commanders to
switch sides, or to abandon their positions and go home.</TE>
<TE>   "The Taliban conquered the country with bribery and negotiation,"
said a former CIA officer familiar with the operation. "And
basically, that's the way we reconquered it--with help from air
power."</TE>
<TE>   Agency spokesman Bill Harlow declined to discuss the CIA's use of
cash in Afghanistan. And although most Afghan commanders deny
receiving payoffs, the evidence suggests otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   In Kabul, for example, three car dealers along Parwan Say, the
city's commercial strip, said they sold "dozens and dozens and
dozens" of new and late-model SUVs--including fully loaded Toyota
Land Cruisers costing up to $60,000--to cash-rich Northern Alliance
warlords and their commanders in November, December and January after
the Taliban abruptly abandoned the city.</TE>
<TE>   "These commanders, they were fighting each other to get these
cars," one dealer said. "We couldn't satisfy them all."</TE>
<TE>   The dealers said the cars were sold for cash, usually crisp 1999
series $100 bills, often with sequential serial numbers. Afghan
merchants note the dates closely because many are convinced that
1988, 1990 and 1993 dollars are counterfeit, and refuse to accept
them.</TE>
<TE>   The scene was much the same in Pakistan. Early last fall, as
Afghan warlord Gul Agha Shirzai gathered his men near the Pakistani
border city of Quetta, U.S. forces airdropped assault rifles,
sleeping bags, ammunition, radios and other gear to fight the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   But Shirzai's aides say the warlord was also given boxes of U.S.
dollars and Pakistani rupees. At one point, they say, he even got a
Land Cruiser containing cash. Shirzai is now governor of Kandahar
province.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses say stacks of dollars and rupees, as well as satellite
phones, were handed out to ethnic Pushtun commanders at two safe
houses in Peshawar on Nov. 13 to enlist their support. The Northern
Alliance, composed mostly of Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara ethnic
minorities, had just taken Kabul, the capital, and provincial Taliban
governments and garrisons were collapsing across eastern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani smugglers willing to haul communications gear, weapons
and other equipment to U.S.-backed proxy forces also got satchels of
cash. So much money changed hands that the value of the dollar fell
sharply against the rupee, and local prices shot up.</TE>
<TE>   "Money, money, money," said local truck driver Yar Khan. "That was
what was happening. Bagmen ... were offering varying amounts of
money, from $5,000 to $1 million and more for arrangements to deliver
goods to the commanders who wanted to fight the Taliban or desert
them."</TE>
<TE>   Khan said old smuggling tracks "became the lifeline of the
anti-Taliban forces."</TE>
<TE>   And the CIA knew the way.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s, the agency secretly funneled $3 billion worth
of weapons and ammunition to rebels fighting Soviet forces in
Afghanistan. Supplies were hauled by mule, truck, horse, motorcycle
and foot on about 300 trails that cross the rugged border.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, recalls former CIA operative Milton Bearden, rebel
commanders prized his gifts of multi-pocketed Banana Republic
photographers' vests and top-of-the-line Bianchi leather holsters. "I
always had beads and mirrors in my duffle bag," he joked.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the CIA kit bag contained compact Thuraya satellite
phones. Sales jumped at the Abu Dhabi-based company as U.S. and
British intelligence agencies ordered thousands of the $660 black
handsets for Afghan contacts. They quickly became status symbols, and
some commanders claimed three or four.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, the CIA got scammed in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   A Pakistani intelligence official said a Peshawar shopkeeper and
his cohort got $50,000 from the CIA for a tip on Bin Laden's
location--then disappeared with the money. "It turned out to be a
swindle," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   More important, officials say, warlords misled U.S. intelligence
during the battle of Tora Bora in December. Despite intense bombing
of suspected Al Qaeda caves and encampments, hundreds of
fighters--perhaps Bin Laden himself--apparently escaped by buying
safe passage from Afghan commanders who were supposedly aiding U.S.
forces.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials suspect Zaman, who had ridiculed the $10,000 offer
at the Peshawar safe house, of milking money and support during the
battle by providing phony intelligence about Bin Laden and inflating
reports of enemy fighters.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA had given support to Zaman's 4,000 anti-Soviet fighters in
the 1980s. He lost out in the civil war that followed the Soviets'
withdrawal and eventually became a political refugee in France.</TE>
<TE>   Zaman returned home in November after the Taliban abandoned his
former political perch, the regional capital of Jalalabad, and soon
received new supplies, vehicles and cash to join the battle at Tora
Bora.</TE>
<TE>   But Zaman neglected to send food, blankets or ammunition to his
troops, forcing them to retreat, and he announced a cease-fire with
Al Qaeda that was immediately denounced by U.S. officials. Today
Zaman is security chief in Jalalabad, a powerful position in a city
that traditionally has thrived on smuggling and drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The other key U.S. ally at Tora Bora, Hazrat Ali, wasn't totally
reliable, either. U.S. officials say that Ali allowed his troops to
escort Al Qaeda fighters into Pakistan during the battle. Today, Ali
is a powerful figure in Nangarhar province, where Jalalabad is
located. He drives a new Land Cruiser and commands a fleet of other
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Others reputed to have received CIA largess now help run the
Defense, Justice and Foreign ministries in the interim post-Taliban
government. A senior Western aid official in Kabul questions whether
that's wise.</TE>
<TE>   "They make mercenaries of these people, then put them in charge
and expect a democratic government to emerge," said the official,
also speaking on condition of anonymity. "You can't build a democracy
based on bribery."</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence officials defend the practice.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a long and strong tradition of buying just about
anything in Afghanistan," a senior CIA official said. "You win
battles by striking deals. The loyalty a warlord gets with his men is
usually from physically taking care of them. He provides cash,
housing and food. That's a big part of the equation."</TE>
<TE>   The equation isn't new for the CIA. Gene Cullen, a former CIA
covert commando, said he and other officers routinely paid up to
$25,000 to informants during America's military and humanitarian
mission in Somalia in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The intervention became a disaster when 18 Army Rangers and Delta
Force soldiers, as well as hundreds of Somalis, were killed in the
"Black Hawk Down" attack in 1993. But Cullen said the CIA sees cash
as one of its best weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it," he said. "The one thing we do have is a lot of
money."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Advises Americans to Leave India</HD>
<DH>South Asia: Fears grow about a 'catastrophic' war along the
Pakistan border. Britain, Canada and Australia also urge their
citizens to evacuate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In an ominous reflection of fears over war in South Asia, the United
States on Friday urged more than 60,000 Americans to leave India
immediately and authorized the departure of nonemergency U.S.
personnel as soon as possible.</LD>
<LD>   The voluntary evacuation came as a classified Pentagon report
estimated that as many as 12 million people would die and an
additional 6 million would be injured in the first weeks of a war
involving nuclear weapons on the volatile subcontinent.</LD>
<LD>   A war would be "somewhere between terrible and catastrophic,"
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz predicted Friday at an
Asian defense conference in Singapore.</LD>
<TE>   The State Department warning also urged any Americans considering
travel to India to defer their plans.</TE>
<TE>   "Conditions along India's border with Pakistan and in the [Indian]
state of Jammu and Kashmir have deteriorated. Tensions have risen to
serious levels and the risk of intensified military hostilities
between India and Pakistan cannot be ruled out," the warning said.</TE>
<TE>   The warning called on Americans to avoid all border areas between
India and Pakistan, including the Indian states of Gujarat, Rajasthan
and Punjab and the disputed Kashmir region, because of military
movements, heavy artillery fire and the presence of terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorist groups, some of which are linked to Al Qaeda and have
previously been implicated in attacks on Americans, are active there
as well, and have attacked and killed civilians," the warning said.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the three previous wars between India and Pakistan have
been fought over Kashmir, a mainly Muslim region divided between the
two nations by the so-called Line of Control following a 1971
conflict. Rebels in the section controlled by India have been
fighting for an independent state or union with Pakistan. India is
mostly Hindu, while Pakistan is mainly Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. warning was coordinated with Britain, Canada and
Australia, which also advised their citizens and nonessential
diplomats to leave India.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation is dangerous," British Foreign Minister Jack Straw
said, warning fellow citizens to avoid travel to India and Pakistan.
"War is not inevitable, but it is important that we should exercise
our duty of care as carefully as we can," he said Friday after
returning from talks in South Asia.</TE>
<TE>   About 20,000 Britons are estimated to be living in India and about
700 in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian officials said they were trying to contact 6,000 of their
citizens known to be living in India to warn them that they might
become targets of politically motivated violence.</TE>
<TE>   "Canada's involvement in the campaign against terrorism,
specifically its military function, raises Canada's profile and
significantly increases dangers for Canadians," the Foreign Affairs
Ministry in Ottawa said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The warnings came amid growing international pressure on India and
Pakistan to not allow the relentless daily shelling on both sides of
the border and attacks by Muslim extremists on Indian targets to
escalate into war. Major powers from three continents and the United
Nations appealed to the South Asian rivals to use restraint.</TE>
<TE>   "We're putting a 100% full-court press on this," Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell said Friday in an interview with the BBC.
"We're going to work with friends around the world, all the leaders
of the world, to do everything we can to keep this situation from
turning into a conflict."</TE>
<TE>   A strongly worded statement issued Friday by the Group of 8
leading industrialized nations called on Pakistan to take "concrete
actions--in accordance with its commitments" to prevent Muslim
extremists operating in territory under its control from infiltrating
the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir and attacking Indian
targets.</TE>
<TE>   "We call on India and Pakistan to continue to work with the
international community to ensure that there will be a diplomatic
solution to the current crisis," said the statement from the Group of
8, which consists of the U.S., Russia, Japan, Canada, Germany, Italy,
Britain and France.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department said Friday that the United States had
indications that Pakistani authorities had given instructions to stop
the cross-border infiltration by radical Muslim groups, though it was
not clear to whom the instructions were given.</TE>
<TE>   Powell noted that the impact and consequences of those directions
are still unclear.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too early to say that it has stopped. And when and if it
does stop, it must also stop permanently," he said, adding that the
U.S. expects Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf "to use all of the
authority he has to stop it and to keep it stopped so we can get this
crisis behind us."</TE>
<TE>   India Plays Down Threat of Immediate War</TE>
<TE>   With world intervention growing, India sought Friday to calm
fears.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't any change on the ground. The situation is stable,"
Defense Minister George Fernandes said in Singapore, where he was
also attending the Asian defense conference. "The troops have been on
both sides in an eyeball-to-eyeball situation for the last six
months, so I don't think one needs worry just now as to what is
likely to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Pakistan continued to move many of its 6,000 troops
deployed along its border with Afghanistan, according to U.S. and
Pakistani officials. Whether those soldiers will be dispatched to the
border with India will depend "on how the threat continues to
increase from India," said a Pakistani presidential spokesman, Maj.
Gen. Rashid Qureshi.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan has not turned over about 20 militants India has demanded
as a condition to de- escalate hostilities.</TE>
<TE>   India also charged Friday that a large number of Al Qaeda
extremists who had evaded U.S. and Pakistani troops had sneaked out
of Afghanistan and into Kashmir recently.</TE>
<TE>   When the United States can verify that the infiltrations have
stopped, Washington will pressure India to withdraw some of its
troops along the border. There are about 1 million Indian and
Pakistani troops along the Line of Control in Kashmir and the rest of
the border.</TE>
<TE>   There was a "slight hiatus" in infiltrations across the Line of
Control earlier this year, a senior Indian defense official said
Friday. Heavy snows in the Himalayan mountains that often limit
winter hostilities, and Musharraf's address to the Pakistani people
in January that condemned extremism and called for political
moderation were among the contributing factors.</TE>
<TE>   But tension increased again as soon as the snow melted.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said he was "impressed" that India and Pakistan seem to be
looking for a political solution.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides realize that little can be gained from a war," he
said. "If the Indians attack, it's unlikely that they would be able
to take care of the problem--on a permanent basis."</TE>
<TE>   If the two sides pull back from the brink of war, Powell said, the
U.S. would be willing to be "helpful" in getting a dialogue going
between the two nations on the future of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we have such solid relations with both countries, our
good offices could be useful," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But as senior U.S. officials have been saying for days, the United
States is not willing to mediate in any such dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistani and Indian governments are expected to come under
pressure when their leaders attend a regional summit in Kazakhstan
that begins Monday. Russian President Vladimir V. Putin has indicated
that he will try to get Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee to hold face-to-face talks under Moscow's auspices.</TE>
<TE>   Bush Envoy to Travel to Region Next Week</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage will hold talks with
both South Asian leaders when he travels to India and Pakistan on
Thursday and Friday. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is expected
to swing through the region beginning June 8 following a visit to
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said Friday that he also might travel to the region if it
appears necessary. He is coordinating the global pressure on
Musharraf and Vajpayee.</TE>
<TE>   "We use all the assets available to us, and since Secretary
Rumsfeld was going to be in the region, it made sense for him to go
in," Powell explained Thursday in an interview on PBS's "NewsHour."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the U.S. will begin downsizing its diplomatic
presence in India. There are about 600 personnel and dependents at
the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi and three consulates in Calcutta,
Chennai and Mumbai, the latter two cities formerly known as Madras
and Bombay.</TE>
<TE>   An "authorized" evacuation is not as urgent as an "ordered"
withdrawal of American personnel, when U.S. officials and their
dependents are mandated to leave. Evacuations were not encouraged at
any level during the three previous India-Pakistan wars since 1947
because neither country then had nuclear weapons, which they tested
in the 1990s.</TE>

<HD>World Cup Runneth Over for Underdog Senegal's Fans</HD>
<DH>Sports: Africans around the globe celebrate the team's
upset of France, reigning champion and former colonial overseer of
the tiny nation.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The French, as usual, were prepared to be gracious in victory, but a
funny thing happened on the way to magnanimity. The reigning World
Cup soccer champion France on Friday confidently opened the 2002
tournament against lightly regarded Senegal, and shocked the soccer
world by losing 1 to 0.</LD>
<LD>   The startling victory by a former colony over its old master in
the first game of the 2002 World Cup added still more suspense to
what was already a highly anticipated tournament, the first ever
played in Asia.</LD>
<LD>   From Algeria to South Africa, Africans celebrated the win by the
Senegalese team, nicknamed the Lions of Teranga. Many described it as
a victory against the vestiges of colonialism.</LD>
<TE>   "The Lions roared today," said William Kirima, a soccer fan in
Nairobi. "This is a huge win for African football and all African
people."</TE>
<TE>   Even in France, the big upset set off celebrations. In Marseille,
immigrant Senegalese danced in the streets, singing, banging drums
and standing on cars.</TE>
<TE>   Fans worldwide gathered at whatever odd hour the Seoul location
dictated--4:30 a.m. in California--with little expectation that the
first match would be much more than an appetizer for the monthlong
feast of soccer to come.</TE>
<TE>   France was a pre-tournament favorite to repeat its 1998 triumph
and Senegal, a former French colony, was, in the diplomatic language
of one BBC commentator, "unfancied" to do much other than show up.
This was Senegal's first time qualifying for the World Cup and it
was, some forecasters said, only the third-best team from Africa.
Just being there was supposed to be the little West African nation's
reward.</TE>
<TE>   Their response to the matchup underscored differing moods in the
two nations: The Senegalese president declared a national holiday as
the French complained about the inconvenience of having to open their
World Cup defense at the same time as the French Open tennis
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Schools were closed across Senegal to allow teachers and students
to watch the match. In Dakar, the capital, many shops were dark as
businesses closed or staggered their opening hours to allow employees
to do the same. Hundreds of Senegalese, most of whom don't own
televisions, gathered at the national theater to watch.</TE>
<TE>   At a French restaurant in Beverly Hills, one of a few area bars
and restaurants that opened to accommodate die-hard fans, wine
importer Bruno Laclotte heaped paternal compliments on Senegal, but
was calculating how much a French victory would boost sales.</TE>
<TE>   "The Senegalese are very physical and have a lot of ambition, but
they don't have the technique that the French have," Laclotte said.</TE>
<TE>   Technique or not, what the Senegal team had after the game was one
of the biggest upsets in World Cup history. The win set off
celebrations across the globe.</TE>
<TE>   Senegal President Abdoulaye Wade, who was almost alone in
predicting the victory, said his players had already fulfilled their
mission. "After beating France, the world champions, the Lions can
come back home," he said. "All the same, I want to ask them to stay
and defend" the honor of Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game was half through, children ran outside to
celebrate the Senegal goal. And after that goal held up for the
victory, thousands of fans poured into the streets, dancing, waving
flags and chanting, "We're going to eat chicken tonight!"--a
reference to the French team's cockerel emblem.</TE>
<TE>   Some fans said the win marked the greatest day not merely in
Senegalese sport, but in Senegalese history--greater even than
Independence Day in 1960, when the country shed three centuries of
French rule.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's hard to tell these days exactly what it means to be
any particular nationality.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, world athletics have become a ferocious free
market, with teams scouring the globe for athletes and the best
athletes moving to wherever the most money lures them. Some major
league baseball teams, for example, have had players from more than
half a dozen countries. In soccer, professional teams in Europe
routinely employ players from Africa and South America.</TE>
<TE>   More than half the members of the French team are of African or
West Indian origin. A third of the French team, including its best
player, are of Algerian descent. One is Senegalese. There also is a
Basque, an Armenian and an Arab.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the Senegalese team players have lived in France for
years. Almost all them play on teams in the top league in France,
while most of the members of the French national team--the French, or
the Algerians, or the French Algerians, or whatever they ought to be
called--play professional soccer elsewhere in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The French--that is, the French who weren't cheering for
Senegal--were philosophical in defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Francois Tomasini, a middle school teacher in the southwestern
French town of Hendaye, said the French team was not done for the
tournament. He and many other French fans noted that the team was
missing its best player, injured midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who is
expected to return to play before the tournament ends.</TE>
<TE>   The lead-up to the World Cup has been unrelenting in France. The
premier sports newspaper, L'Equipe, had two sections, with both
covers featuring a World Cup theme. Tennis coverage started on Page 4
of the second section.</TE>
<TE>   And the NBA playoffs? They landed on Page 13 of the second
section.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's not a disaster today," said journalist Yannick
Cochennec of Tennis Magazine/France. "It's going to calm down the
whole country. It was too much the last month, even last night the
players' wives were on TV. It's like we are a South American country
and Zidane is a god .... OK, we won the World Cup. We won the
European Championships. Suddenly, it's too much. There's the World
Cup and nothing else."</TE>
<TE>   The international drama played out in far-flung spots across
Southern California. In Costa Mesa, two British expatriates met at an
Irish pub to watch the game. One of them, Paul Holden, said he was
cheering more against France than for Senegal.</TE>
<TE>   "If England were playing, we'd be drinking [here] as well, doing
the whole deal, but it's only France," Holden said. "We hate France
almost as much as the Germans and Argentina."</TE>
<TE>   The drama was a little more to the point in the Brasserie Des
Artistes restaurant in Beverly Hills, where owner George Etesse
opened his doors at 4 a.m. Friday. Etesse's regular clientele is
largely expatriate French and Francophiles, but one of his waiters,
Zackiry Mohamed, is from Senegal and invited a few friends for the
match.</TE>
<TE>   "If Senegal wins," Etesse proclaimed with a good-natured laugh,
"he's fired."</TE>
<TE>   By 4 a.m., nearly 50 fans were crowded into the cafe on Wilshire
Boulevard. The signs of an upset were everywhere. French fan Clovis
Chambaret, 26, was already looking past the Senegalese to the next
opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "The French hate the Germans because Germany beat them five times
in a row in the World Cup," Chambaret said. "Secretly, [French fans]
want to play against Germany."</TE>
<TE>   The Senegalese fans stewed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're more vicious than the French think," Mohamed the waiter
said under his breath. "We have a lot to prove, especially against
France."</TE>
<TE>   French fans got up early for the match; Senegalese fans like
Mustafa Ndiaye didn't sleep.</TE>
<TE>   A former college player, Ndiaye, 26, was jittery with excitement.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been waiting so long for this," he said. "Soccer is the
only way we can beat [the French], the only way we can express
ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Ndiaye found other ways once the game began, shouting his
encouragement with every touch of the ball by Senegalese feet.</TE>
<TE>   He was joined not only by other Senegalese fans, but by Tunisians
and Algerians wearing Senegalese team jerseys.</TE>
<TE>   When midfielder Papa-Bouba Diop scored in the 30th minute, the
African fans went wild.</TE>
<TE>   At halftime, Clement Bacque, who showed up for the game in plaid
flannel pajama bottoms topped by a French jersey, said watching his
team try to recover from the 1-0 deficit in the second half would be
"45 minutes of agony."</TE>
<TE>   His prediction proved correct, as the Senegalese repelled a series
of French attacks on their goal.</TE>
<TE>   As time expired, French fans were diplomatic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be fine," said Fred Thiphaine, 34. "When you're on
top, everyone wants to beat you and they have nothing to lose."</TE>
<TE>   Alex Dupuis, looking stunned, complimented the Senegalese.</TE>
<TE>   "They played great defense," he said. "This was a big slap in the
face."</TE>
<TE>   The salt in the unexpected wound to Dupuis' national pride was the
$20 he lost to his Senegalese girlfriend, Awa Diop.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't expect them to play so well together," Diop said.</TE>
<TE>   A resigned Clement Bacque tugged at the leg of his pajama bottoms
as the sun rose over Wilshire.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going back to bed," he said.</TE>

<HD>Concern Grows in Weed War</HD>
<DH>What price freedom from dandelions? The EPA is rethinking a
long-used herbicide's cancer risk to humans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's that time again--that balmy stretch of late spring when
America's war on the dandelion is in full swing. The weapon of choice
is the weed killer 2,4-D, most commonly mixed with fertilizer in
"weed and feed" treatments. Each year Americans apply an estimated 27
million pounds of it to parks, cemeteries, home lawns and anywhere
else mown grass is found.</LD>
<LD>   It is thought to be the most widely used herbicide in the world.
The appeal is that 2,4-D, chemical shorthand for
dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, is selective: It kills broad-leaf plants
such as dandelions but spares grass. It overwhelms the dandelion's
hormone system, causing the weed to essentially grow itself to death.
This "uncontrolled growth," says Thomas M. Cahill, an environmental
chemist at Trent University in Ontario, Canada, is a kind of "cancer
for plants."</LD>
<LD>   The question among environmentalists and medical researchers is:
Does cancer for plants also mean cancer for people?</LD>
<TE>   The Environmental Protection Agency, which ruled in 1997 that
2,4-D was not classifiable as a human carcinogen, is now reviewing
the chemical's registration. Specialist committees are looking at the
issue, says Joanne Miller, product manager for the EPA's pesticide
registration section. The EPA decision about registration is due in
two years. Until then, "the bottom line is: We can't make a call,"
she says. "We can't rule out, and we can't say for sure."</TE>
<TE>   That uncertainty is roiling the world of American lawn care, where
the EPA estimates as much as 20% of world production of 2,4-D is
used.</TE>
<TE>   Although 2,4-D has been used for decades, increasingly worried
activists at the local level are demanding warning notices when it is
used, blocking its use in city parks, and in some cases even getting
it banned.</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturers contend that hundreds of studies have shown no
danger to humans.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as label instructions are followed, it certainly poses no
unreasonable risk," says Don Page, executive director of the
industry's task force on 2,4-D research data. "The only verified
examples of 2,4-D poisoning in humans is in suicides. If you drink
enough of it, you can kill yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Dandelions were not always reviled. Colonists brought the first
seeds to North America almost four centuries ago. Early Americans
boiled the leaves, battered and fried the flowers and roasted and
ground the roots for "coffee." Today, foodies toss leaves in
Italian-style salads and hippies make dandelion wine, but homeowners
largely regard the plant as a nuisance.</TE>
<TE>   Wind-borne seeds have propagated the plant everywhere in the
United States outside the desert and the Arctic, from sea level to
12,000 feet and, most conspicuously, in 30 million acres of
residential lawns.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Scott Jenkins, author of "The Lawn: An American
Obsession," credits the golf industry and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture with investing in the technology required to sustain all
that grass. Scott Co. of Marysville, Ohio, the leading lawn care firm
in the country, agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "People were playing golf and they said, 'Gosh, we'd like to have
grass like this at home,'" says Ashton Ritchie, a Scott agronomist.
"In 1928, we started selling turf builder--fertilizer for lawns--to
go along with the grass seed."</TE>
<TE>   The better homeowners got at growing grass, the more vain they
became about it, says Stan Spalding, retired UCLA turf breeder.
"People were taught by advertising to be proud when they could show
their neighbors and friends a pure grass lawn. So dandelion and
clover became weeds," he says.</TE>
<TE>   In 1944, a weed killer developed in Britain for wheat farming was
reformulated by the USDA for turf and launched on the lawn care
market. In 1946, American Chemical Paint Co. released 2,4-D in a
product called Weedone with the slogan, "This year have a lovelier,
golf-green lawn."</TE>
<TE>   By 1947, Scott had mixed 2,4-D with fertilizer into the first
weed-and-feed combination. The company promised customers that they
would "get as much of a kick out of putting pesky dandelions to rout
as we have."</TE>
<TE>   Hints of Illness Prompt Research</TE>
<TE>   But by the 1980s, question marks were looming over the safety of
2,4-D. In 1986, a study published in the Journal of the American
Medical Assn. suggested that Kansas crop workers who had applied
2,4-D had a heightened rate of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of
the immune system. A later study also found higher than normal levels
of the disease in lawn service applicators. In 1989, the National
Academy of Sciences estimated that homeowners are likely to use 10
times more chemicals per acre on their lawns than farmers use on
agricultural land.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the furor sparked by the Kansas study, the EPA began its
first review of 2,4-D since the chemical's introduction in the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Page, head of the current industry task force, was
already working with the leading manufacturers on the issue and
eventually coordinated what he estimates were 270 studies on possible
toxicity. The biggest four companies--the German firm BASF, Dow
AgroSciences in the U.S., Australia's NewFarm Inc. and the
U.S-Argentinian concern Agro-Gor--spent more than $30 million on the
research, he says.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991 the National Cancer Institute suggested that 2,4-D might
cause a lymphatic cancer in dogs. It also calculated that diagnoses
of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among farm workers had been increasing 75%
in the past 20 years. It attributed part of the rise to better
diagnoses but also considered 2,4-D a possible contributor.</TE>
<TE>   Page attacked the cancer institute's canvassing methods, then the
interpretation of the results, and accused it of scaremongering to
raise research funds.</TE>
<TE>   His task force turned in the last of the 270 toxicity studies in
1995. The results showed that the amount of 2,4-D it took to harm lab
animals far exceeded anything expected to be encountered in the
environment.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1996, as the cancer risk argument rolled on, University of
Minnesota pathologist Vincent Garry published a study in
Environmental Health Perspectives showing that 2,4-D might also cause
birth defects. Garry found almost twice the number of birth defects
among children of pesticide applicators than a control population.
The children had been conceived in spraying season in a Minnesota
potato and sugar beet farming region predominantly using 2,4-D.</TE>
<TE>   Again, Page moved to put out the fire. He says a new study soon to
be published will show that "none of Dr. Garry's findings were
significant." He adds: "Dr. Garry himself will not defend that
study."</TE>
<TE>   But Garry says that although 2,4-D performs well in the lab, it is
a different story in the field.</TE>
<TE>   "In my experience, when you take pure 2,4-D, you never see
anything. It's almost biologically inert," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But mix 2,4-D with the other ingredients used to formulate about
1,500 types of 2,4-D weedkiller now on the market, and the story
changes. Commercial-grade 2,4-D, he says, is mixed with "adjuvants,
things that are going to aid penetration. When you move to commercial
grade of the product, then you begin to see stuff."</TE>
<TE>   For example, people who regularly spray the herbicide "have a
higher level of 2,4-D in their urine than any other group," he says.
They also show more frequent chromosomal changes than people not in
contact with 2,4-D, he says.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, with the EPA review of 2,4-D still underway, the agency's
Carcinogenicity Peer Review Committee stopped short of ranking the
chemical a probable cause of cancer, like cigarettes. But three years
later, one of its own statisticians and one of Garry's collaborators
in the Minnesota study linked many cancers--of the esophagus,
stomach, rectum, throat, pancreas, larynx, prostate, kidney and
brain--to heavy wheat growing regions notable for 2,4-D use.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what's causing it," says Dina Schreinemachers, the
EPA statistician. "It's something associated with the wheat."</TE>
<TE>   By 1991, homeowners were worried. Buffalo, N.Y., was the first
city to require lawn care companies to post warning signs on
chemically treated lawns. In that state, according to Audrey Thier of
the Buffalo-based lobby Environmental Advocates, five counties have
passed ordinances that require prior notice of spraying to neighbors,
and eight municipalities have passed ordinances that phase out use of
pesticides on government property.</TE>
<TE>   At last reckoning by the General Accounting Office, 23 other
states also had counties with some sort of notification requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Also in 1991, the municipal council of Hudson, Canada, banned the
cosmetic use of pesticides altogether. A coalition of lawn care
companies, including ChemLawn, sued to overturn the ban. Last June,
the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the Hudson ban.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, says Angela Rickman, deputy director of the Sierra
Club of Canada, "more than 40 different communities are looking at
pesticide restriction bylaws of one form or another" in her country.
The club declared May 11 "Dandelion Day" and is sponsoring "Getting
Your Lawn Off Drugs" workshops this summer at Ottawa City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Officials Concerned About Effect on Wildlife</TE>
<TE>   When Seattle began a pesticide reduction program in 1999, the
concern was for wildlife, particularly Washington state's salmon
population. Extoxnet, a pesticide Web site managed by five
universities, including UC Davis, lists 2,4-D as severely impairing
honeybees at moderate doses, being "slightly toxic to wildfowl and
slightly to moderately toxic to birds," and "highly toxic to fish."</TE>
<TE>   "Residential streets are the worst possible place for pesticides,"
says Phil Renfrow, pesticide reduction coordinator for the Seattle
Parks Department. "There is a lawn, a sidewalk and gutter and a catch
basin all within a couple feet of each other. The entry into the
water supply is right there."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Geological Survey confirms that 2,4-D is routinely found
in urban watersheds. In the latest round of testing of the Santa Ana
River near Imperial Highway from January 1999 to April 2000, 2,4-D
was detected in more than a fourth of the samples.</TE>
<TE>   In Seattle, 2,4-D is no longer used on park lawns. "We just accept
dandelions and English daisies," says Renfrow, the pesticide
reduction official for parks there. Renfrow's department even buys a
new "Eco-Turf" seed mix that comes already studded with weeds.</TE>
<TE>   Diana Balmori, a Yale University lecturer in landscape
architecture and co-author of "Redesigning the American Lawn," says
Connecticut towns are now handing out prizes to keepers of "freedom"
lawns--that is, pesticide-free and growing wild.</TE>
<TE>   At UC Davis, weed scientist Tom Lanini gives this advice:
"Dandelions are situated in such a way that they never sit across
your whole lawn," he says. "For the few dandelions that people have,
it's easier than spraying to go out with a dandelion fork and pull
them out."</TE>

<HD>A Morbid Aftermath to Store Rampage</HD>
<DH>Crime: Two decomposed bodies are found in Long Beach
gunman's home where parents lived.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The grim story of the calm, bald gunman who killed a checker and a
little girl at a Long Beach supermarket grew more bizarre Friday as
police revealed a startling discovery: The remains of two people
found in the man's condo a block from the store had been there more
than a year.</LD>
<LD>   The bodies of the unidentified pair--so decomposed that even
gender identification was daunting--were lying on a bed in a back
bedroom where a window overlooks the Top Valu Market, the scene of
the gunfire Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Antonio Pineiro, 48, shot six people before an officer fatally
wounded him, Long Beach police said.</LD>
<TE>   Pineiro owned the small two-bedroom unit at 436 Cedar Ave., where
police and residents say his elderly Cuban parents lived. Friendly
and outgoing, in contrast to their son, neither has been seen by
neighbors for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked him where they were," said condo neighbor Paul Cook, who
recalled Pineiro regularly carrying large laundry detergent boxes to
the unit, sometimes three at a time. "He said they'd moved."</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear if the bodies were Pineiro's parents, or how they
died.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors described his mother as crippled, saying it often took
her 15 to 20 minutes to climb a short flight of stairs, her husband
following to guard against a fall.</TE>
<TE>   The two people Pineiro killed at the store lived in the downtown
neighborhood around the store.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Ibasco, 8, a cheerful third-grader, lived on Cedar, a
block from the gunman, and on the night of the shooting she was at
the store with her parents to get ingredients for a chocolate cake.</TE>
<TE>   Marcella Perez, 38, who worked several jobs to get by, lived half
a mile from the store where she worked as a checker and was shot, her
family suspects, as she tried to protect the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   Conrado and Myrna Ibasco, Barbara's parents, were grazed by
bullets, hospitalized Thursday and released. Police identified the
other surviving shooting victims, who were not critically injured, as
Richard Coleman, 32, of Los Angeles, and Concepcion Henriquez, 58, of
Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Police knew little about the gunman, characterized by neighbors as
a portly and "slow-moving" oddball with no apparent job or
interests--cordial as he passed in hallways, often laden with
groceries, but lacking the warmth of his parents, Maria and Antonio
Sr.</TE>
<TE>   When a neighbor offered, more than once, to help him bring
groceries inside the apartment, Pineiro always declined.</TE>
<TE>   The couple were described fondly by neighbors as charmers,
especially liked by children to whom they gave candy. None of the
residents in the 1950s-era condo building smelled or noticed anything
unsavory about the Pineiros' unit 15.</TE>
<TE>   "Were the bodies moved? Was someone managing the smell of the
apartment?" Long Beach police spokesman Dave Marander asked
rhetorically. "We may never know what the real story is here."</TE>
<TE>   According to police, witnesses and those who knew the gunman and
victims, there was no apparent target or motive that provoked Pineiro
to shoot up his local market. As far as anyone knew, he had no beef
with the store, no bounced check, no tattered romance with a clerk or
bagger.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, neighbor Cook passed Pineiro in the parking lot as Cook
walked out of the store, and the men exchanged waves.</TE>
<TE>   Pineiro, he said, was standing calmly in the parking lot outside
the front door, wearing his standard outfit of light blue pants and
light blue or white shirt. Though his frame was imposing at 5 feet 9
and 280 pounds, Pineiro was a rather quiet and unassuming man,
neighbors in his building said.</TE>
<TE>   Krystal Smith, who rents a neighboring condo, said Pineiro's daily
routine was predictable: He would get up, go to the mailbox, go to
the store, walk around the neighborhood, and not much else. He didn't
seem to have a job or anything else to do.</TE>
<TE>   Her son remembered one odd moment the day before the shooting. On
Wednesday, he saw Pineiro a few blocks from home, waiting at a bus
bench, and he was crying.</TE>
<TE>   "I could tell he was crying," said Dequan Smith, 12, "because he
took off his glasses and wiped his eyes."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, shortly before 5:30 p.m., police started getting
frantic 911 calls that a man with two guns had entered the store and
was shooting at people. He was still firing when officers arrived.
They rushed in and confronted Pineiro, who fired at least one shot
before police wounded him. Pineiro died that night in surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Conrado Ibasco, a nurse, said he stopped to buy cigarettes on his
way home from work, and happened upon his wife and daughter at the
store. He wandered away from them, and the daughter and mother got
into the checkout line.</TE>
<TE>   Ibasco heard gunshots and started to run, then he saw his wife.
She was screaming. Then he saw his daughter. She was on the floor,
covered with blood.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman was in the middle of the store, Ibasco said, and was
approaching the couple, forcing them to leave their daughter's limp
body. The gunman, he said, was big, bald, very calm, and wasn't
running around, just standing.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked determined to end somebody's life and his," Ibasco said
Friday, smoking a cigarette. His wife was too distraught to be
interviewed. The couple had tried for years to conceive when they
finally had Barbara, "so she was their entire life," her uncle Nick
Ibasco said. The couple kept photo albums chronicling her whole life,
from class photos to report cards, and spread them across their
coffee table Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Ibasco spoke in a detached voice, referring to his daughter in
present tense. Despite seeing the gunman combing the store for
targets, the father said he was driven to return to his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife kept screaming, 'No! She's alive! She's alive!' But I
just knew," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Marcella Perez had already put in a nine-hour day as an aide in
the Long Beach Unified School District by the time she got to Top
Valu at 5 p.m. Thursday for her shift as a checker.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, mother of four and grandmother of three, worked two or
three jobs, seven days a week, stealing a few hours here and there to
giggle with her daughters or go salsa dancing with friends.</TE>
<TE>   She was weary when Pineiro walked into the market with two
guns--but her family believes that she was still looking out for
others around her, said her daughter, Cathy Perez, 21.</TE>
<TE>   Perez said she was told by witnesses that her mother died trying
to shield Barbara Ibasco from the bullets that ripped into both.</TE>
<TE>   As news of the shooting spread, Perez's family became concerned,
then panicked, when their mother didn't call them. In their two
beat-up cars, three generations of the Perez family drove an anxious
circuit from the police station to the hospitals to the scene of the
crime and back again, begging for news.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, at 4 a.m., police confirmed that Perez was dead.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, as they struggled to figure out how they would pay for a
funeral, and how they would continue without their mother's wages,
family members recalled a woman who "was always working" but still
managed to find time for dancing and family.</TE>
<TE>   Born in San Diego, Perez grew up in Inglewood and worked for years
as an aide in the Los Angeles Unified School District. About 10 years
ago, she began working as an aide in the Long Beach district. She
dreamed of becoming a teacher, and planned to go back to school if
she could ever save enough to quit one of her many jobs. She also
sold Tupperware and Mary Kay products.</TE>
<TE>   When not working, her two obsessions were her children's education
and salsa dancing. She managed to combine the two in her dreams for
her newest grandchild, 10-month-old Melody.</TE>
<TE>   She often talked about the day when Melody was old enough to go to
school, a good school, one where she could go on to college, Cathy
Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   Cathy Perez said her mother planned, when Melody was old enough to
go to school, to meet her school bus every day. Marcella Perez also
hoped Melody would eventually say of her dancing grandmother: "Hey,
there's my grandmother, the hoochie mama."</TE>
<TE>   Cathy Perez interrupted her story and began crying.</TE>
<TE>   "And she didn't even live to see her grow up."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday evening, after Pineiro was stopped, officers made their
way to his condo, just across the alley from the supermarket.</TE>
<TE>   They punched a hole in the front door but could not open it, so
they broke in through a window, neighbors said. The hole left in the
door revealed the modest and tidy furnishings, including an ancient
black and white television with a rabbit ear antenna.</TE>
<TE>   "Every officer that went into the place came out with a real
dumbfounded look on their face," said one neighbor, who asked not to
be named. "They looked like they couldn't believe what they had
seen."</TE>
<TE>   Police said little about the scene except that the bodies were
mostly skeletal remains and their state of decomposition was such
that investigators believe they had been dead more than a year.
Autopsies may take more than a week.</TE>
<TE>   No missing persons report on Pineiro's parents was ever filed.
Neighbors said they remember last seeing the couple around Mothers
Day of 2001.</TE>

<HD>One Miscue, and a Casual Climb Can Turn Deadly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Perched at what seemed the top of the world--western Oregon spread
out below like a carpet, clouds dotting the big green netherworld
like wildflowers--Jeff Pierce didn't expect the human missiles that
suddenly came hurtling toward him, threatening to blow him off the
mountain and into the beautiful blue beyond.</LD>
<LD>   He heard it first, a bunch of hollering from the six climbers
above him near the summit of Mt. Hood. Somebody slipped. No problem.
The 38-year-old firefighter looked up, thinking he would see what he
had seen dozens of times: some guys planting their ice axes and
hunkering into the side of the mountain, maybe someone dangling
scared but safe on a rope. No. Six guys were headed his way, going so
fast they were already nothing but a tangle of rope and flailing legs
and silent fear.</LD>
<LD>   "Move right! Move right!" Pierce screamed to the two other
climbers on his team. But there wasn't time. Pierce slammed his ax
into the snow and held on as he and his buddies joined the train
wreck plummeting toward the glacial crevasse below.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew I was going in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   By the time it was over--some said it took five seconds, nobody
thought it took more than 30--Pierce was lying on a steep slope of
snow and ice 20 feet down the chasm. One climber was lying face down
on an ice shelf below; he was dead. Four others were pancaked on top
of each other in a deep hole at the bottom of the crevasse. Two were
still alive; they yelled when you touched them. Two were dead.</TE>
<TE>   As rescuers removed the last of the three bodies Friday from a
mountain that glinted with disarming grace above the Portland
skyline, survivors of Mt. Hood's second worst climbing
accident--compounded by the crash of a rescue helicopter--recalled
the terrifying conclusion of what was supposed to have been an easy
climb.</TE>
<TE>   The accident--in balmy blue weather, on what is a widely used
ascent route, on the second-most-climbed mountain in the world--has
sobered the mountaineering community in the Pacific Northwest and has
prompted an investigation into the cause of the crash.</TE>
<TE>   "This accident is going to make a lot of people start rethinking a
lot of things, especially climbing with other people above them,"
said John Godino, a climbing instructor for the Portland-based
Mazamas mountaineering club. "It's a real wake-up call."</TE>
<TE>   John Biggs, 62, a retired airline pilot from Windsor, Calif., was
among the dead identified Friday. Also killed were William Ward, 49,
and Richard Read, 48, both of Forest Grove, Ore. Seven other people
remained hospitalized, including Biggs' friend and pastor, the Rev.
Thomas Hillman, 45, also of Windsor. Hillman was listed in fair
condition with a head injury. A rescue specialist on the downed
helicopter, Staff Sgt. Darrin Shore, 43, was in fair condition with a
fractured left leg and rib.</TE>
<TE>   Climbers on the mountain during Thursday's events said the day
appeared to provide a better-than-normal opportunity for reaching Mt.
Hood's 11,235-foot summit. Hard-packed snow made footings easy. The
weather was the best it had been all year.</TE>
<TE>   Five members of the Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue Department set
out early for their summit attempt, taking along one of the men's
14-year-old son and a paramedic from another department.</TE>
<TE>   The climb was Pierce's idea--he had climbed Mt. Hood many
times--and most of the guys thought it was a great way to get some
exercise and see the world from a whole new angle.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Butler, a 28-year-old paramedic, was the only other member
of the group who has significant climbing experience, so it was
agreed that Pierce would lead the first team up the mountain and
Butler would lead the second. Assistant Fire Marshal Cleve Joiner
would climb with Butler, and his son Cole, with Pierce, in deference
to an old tradition of mountaineering: split up families. That way
somebody always goes home.</TE>
<TE>   They arrived at the mountain at 2:30 a.m., but it was so icy it
took longer than expected to ski up to the 8,500-foot level, where
the climb begins. They weren't underway until 3:45.</TE>
<TE>   "We took a pretty slow pace up the mountain from there," Butler
said. They stopped frequently to give the less-experienced climbers
lessons in the basics of mountaineering: how to climb in crampons
(the notched boot attachments capable of digging into the ice), how
to dig your ice ax into the snow and self-arrest if you start to
fall.</TE>
<TE>   By the time they reached the wide, sloping snow field known as
Hogsback for the final part of the ascent, two other
climbers--probably Biggs and Hillman--were roping up to mount the
250-foot-long Hogsback spine. Pierce's and Butler's teams carefully
crossed the most dangerous part of the route, known as the
Bergschrund--a gaping crevasse where the edge of the glacier falls
away from the snow and ice field of the summit--then roped up and set
off.</TE>
<TE>   They could see Biggs and Hillman about 150 feet above them, and
higher, four more climbers, most likely Harry G. Slutter of
Centerport, N.Y.; Christopher Kern, 40, of Long Island, N.Y.; and
Ward and Read, the Oregon men.</TE>
<TE>   What happened next is just a guess. Someone in the group at the
top slipped--a crampon that didn't get a toehold in the ice is all it
would have taken.</TE>
<TE>   All four men tried to arrest their fall but failed. They careened
down into Biggs and Hillman, who began screaming "Arrest! Arrest!"
but were hit so hard they were knocked down the mountain too.</TE>
<TE>   Next in line was Pierce, Cole Joiner and another firefighter,
Jeremiah Moffitt. They had no time to get out of the way. "I was in
full arrest being dragged into the Bergschrund and it was pretty
obvious to me I wasn't going to stop," Pierce said.</TE>
<TE>   The falling bodies quickly accelerated to terminal
velocity--possibly 125 mph--on the smooth, hard-packed snow. "When we
started seeing them come down the mountain, they were pretty much
like missiles," said Chad Hashbarger, 33, the Fire Department's
fitness specialist, who was roped up with Butler and barely escaped
the melee.</TE>
<TE>   "Right when the team started coming down, we were all yelling at
each other to hunker down.... And then, how do you describe someone
going from zero to a hundred, it was just like that. It was an
incredible amount of speed.... They were sliding, tumbling;
everything just got all tangled up. Ropes and everything. They became
one big ball."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of sailing on down the mountain to certain death, all nine
climbers slammed into the lip of the crevasse and down the icy
chamber, with some of the worst injured packed into a small recess at
the bottom. The firefighters called that "the hole."</TE>
<TE>   "One of them, I could only see a leg sticking out of the pile,"
Pierce said.</TE>
<TE>   In moments, the firefighters went from terrified participants to
rescuers. Pierce, who suffered only a gash to his leg, began triaging
the other men in the hole--including Cole, who was looking at Pierce,
he said, "with big eyes"--while Butler hauled out of the crevasse
rescue gear he had taken up the mountain for just such an emergency.</TE>
<TE>   While Cleve Joiner called for help on a cell phone, the paramedic
on Butler's team, Selena Maestas, began preparing to give first aid.
Butler and others set up a system of ropes and pulleys to haul out
the most critically injured.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Boyer, an emergency room physician who had been climbing the
mountain with another party, climbed down into the crevasse and began
assessing the injuries, while Hood River, Ore., physician Jim
Pennington, climbing with his son and daughter, helped treat victims
awaiting transport in the helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was doing a real good job, really calm and really
helping," Pennington said. "I spent three or four hours getting
people out, and it was that long before the helicopter finally
started doing its thing. We had all the victims right next to the
Bergschrund, trying to keep them warm and keeping them still."</TE>
<TE>   Climbers from all over the mountain--48 in all--started shedding
their clothes and lending them to the injured.</TE>
<TE>   Kern, the most seriously hurt, had a broken pelvis and internal
bleeding that forced him in and out of consciousness. "We were having
a real hard time keeping him warm because of the internal bleeding
into his pelvis. With everything we were doing, he was getting less
and less alert," Pennington said.</TE>
<TE>   "At first he was talking and saying, 'I'm cold,' and shivering.
Then it got to the point where he stopped talking."</TE>
<TE>   Hillman also appeared seriously injured but remained stable. Both
men were evacuated on helicopters when the Pave Hawk arrived for
Moffitt, who had a broken arm and some cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Moffitt was on a gurney tied to the helicopter cable when some
witnesses said the wind seemed to shift and the helicopter foundered.
"My first indication that something was going wrong was the cable
coming off, and the helicopter was basically heading down the
mountain," said Pierce, who was helping load Moffitt onto the craft.</TE>
<TE>   The helicopter "seemed to wobble," Pierce said, then turned left,
hit the ground and rolled. "If the pilot had gone to the left, he
essentially would have taken out everybody who was on that ledge, and
that was eight or nine people."</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the crash was almost silent, the noise muffled by
the snow. "To see one hit the snow and for everything to be just
eerily quiet, just made it that much more surreal," Butler said.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, only four of the copter's six crew members had
substantial injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force Col. Mark Kyle said Friday an accident review board has
been convened to determine the cause of the crash. Authorities said
the copter was well within its operating limits, though flying at
10,500 feet, with strong winds swirling around the mountain, can be
treacherous.</TE>
<TE>   Officers said they immediately scrambled additional helicopters
after the crash.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a definite pause in that room" when the crash happened,
said Maj. Jeff Macrander of the 304th Rescue Squadron. "All the folks
on the phone stopped talking, that kind of thing. But we are
professionals. We had our pause, and then we went right back to
work."</TE>

<HD>Maddux, Braves, Rain Cool Off First-Place Reds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>They packed the ballpark to see Junior's return and get their Johnny
Bench bobblehead dolls. They got some vintage Greg Maddux too.</LD>
<LD>   Maddux stayed sharp through a 64-minute delay Friday night,
setting the tone with five shutout innings as the Atlanta Braves
pulled away for a 7-0 victory over the Reds at Cincinnati.</LD>
<LD>   The Reds returned from a one-week trip with Ken Griffey Jr. back
in the lineup and a two-game lead in the National League Central.
That, plus the bobblehead doll giveaway, drew 38,777 fans, the
largest crowd at Cinergy Field since opening day.</LD>
<TE>   There was little for them to cheer once Maddux (6-2) found his
touch.</TE>
<TE>   "Typical Maddux," said Griffey, who was one for three. "In, out,
up, down. He keeps you off-balance. You have to take what he gives
you, and he doesn't give you a whole lot. The key to getting him is
to get him down early and get him out of there."</TE>
<TE>   Not even a nasty storm in the fourth inning could do it. Maddux
stayed loose by throwing in the clubhouse, then came back and resumed
getting them out. He gave up only two hits.</TE>
<TE>   Ten of the Reds' 15 outs came on harmless grounders, the trademark
of Maddux's career.</TE>
<TE>   Three relievers limited the Reds to two infield singles the rest
of the way, completing Atlanta's fourth shutout. The Reds got only
one runner to second base and hit only six balls out of the infield
all game.</TE>
<TE>   Julio Franco had three hits, and Gary Sheffield returned to the
Braves' lineup with an RBI double as the NL East leaders finished a
reinvigorating month. Atlanta grabbed first by winning 11 of its last
15.</TE>
<TE>   Griffey received the loudest ovation when he was introduced before
his first home game since April 7, when he tore a tendon in his right
knee during a rundown. Griffey walked and was caught stealing in the
first inning, then bunted for Cincinnati's first hit against an
infield shift in the fourth. He is three for 20 since his return from
the disabled list last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope he bunts all the time," Maddux said. "He can bunt whenever
he wants. I'm trying to walk him anyway, so what's the difference if
he walks or bunts?"</TE>

<HD>O'Neal Is True to His Word</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The distress signal for the Kings came early on, when Shaquille
O'Neal made it evident he had his complete arsenal at his disposal,
backed by the full support of the officials.</LD>
<LD>   S-0-S.</LD>
<LD>   Same Old Shaq.</LD>
<TE>   Serious Omen, Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Seeya On Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said before the playoffs started that this championship
defense was on him. Just when it was about to end, he lived up to his
word.</TE>
<TE>   With time running out, O'Neal reached into his pocket, pulled out
another quarter, popped it in the machine and the Lakers got to stay
in the arcade at least two days longer.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored 41 points, made 13 of 17 free throws, pulled down 17
rebounds and blocked two shots--every one of those statistics vital
to the Lakers' 106-102 victory in Game 6 that forced a decisive Game
7 in Arco Arena on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I was feeling it today," O'Neal said. "I wanted it today. My guys
were looking for it."</TE>
<TE>   This game took the Western Conference finals back to the basic
premises. The prowess of the Lakers' big two of O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant against the balanced Kings, who once again have their full
complement of players now that Peja Stojakovic is back from an ankle
injury.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings had managed to take a 3-2 lead in the series with only
18 minutes from Stojakovic, all in Game 5. The Lakers hung in there
despite a hobbled O'Neal, still fighting injuries to his toes and
ankles.</TE>
<TE>   While Kobe's cheeseburger was a distant memory and he pumped in 31
points, O'Neal didn't look afflicted at all in Game 6.</TE>
<TE>   He elevated and dunked. He got to his favorite spots in the
middle. When they weren't available, he went to his baseline jumper.
He even spun and went under the glass for a reverse layup--which
turned out to be the Lakers' last field goal and their only non-free
throw among their final 18 points.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal showed glimpses of his old dominant self in Game 5, when he
threw down dunks with abandon. But he shot only one free throw and
was limited and eventually sent to the bench with fouls.</TE>
<TE>   He got the and-ones he was looking for on Friday. And he converted
them. O'Neal had three three-point plays in the first half. He made
his first 10 free throws. When even that part of his game is working,
he really is unstoppable.</TE>
<TE>   He also had his storytelling skills going. The Big Aesop in
effect.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said he got his inspiration from an early-morning phone
call from Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "A funny thing happened last night," O'Neal said. "I was sleeping,
with my little daughter sleeping on me. She was slobbing, I was
slobbing. The phone rang about 2:30. It was Kob. He was like, 'Big
Fella, I need you tomorrow. Let's make history.'"</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his other tale of the playoffs, when he said his father
called him in the trainer's room as he was getting a cut finger
stitched and told him to get back on the court, this one actually had
another source.</TE>
<TE>   Either it really happened, or he and Bryant collaborated on their
stories before they went out to the podium.</TE>
<TE>   "I called him and woke his big behind up," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   We hate to doubt O'Neal's account of all the drooling, but that
part might have been fabricated.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he wasn't asleep," Bryant said. "He doesn't go to sleep
until about 5 in the morning. I might as well call him and see if I
can catch him at home."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was home all right. He's always at home when he has his
monster playoff games against the Kings, like those two games of
40-plus points and 20-plus rebounds he strung together last season.</TE>
<TE>   You could tell he and the Lakers were at home by the way the game
was officiated.</TE>
<TE>   This time it was Sacramento's turn to gripe about the officiating,
and with good reason. The Lakers got just about every call they
wanted. It was as if this game was one big makeup call for their
perceived short-siding in Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   Vlade Divac and Scot Pollard accrued most of their fouls against
O'Neal. Chris Webber had five personal fouls.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers went to the line 40 times to Sacramento's 25.</TE>
<TE>   That's what made this the Kings' most admirable performance of the
series. They had to deal with O'Neal at his finest, allowed to do
what he wanted. And the Kings answered every Laker shot, every
mini-run. None of the 18,997 fans at Staples felt safe to exhale
until Robert Horry's free throw gave the Lakers a four-point lead
with 2.4 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings keep coming, and they'll be ready to go on Sunday. The
Lakers are counting on their past Game 7 experience to get them
through, and hoping that the Kings will finally realize the magnitude
of what's at stake and play tight.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure's on them," O'Neal said. "The pressure's not on us."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers would be fools to take that approach. These Kings have
defied every negative assumption about them and have demonstrated
that they're ready.</TE>
<TE>   If the Lakers are to get to the NBA Finals, O'Neal needs to
demonstrate that he's ready to duplicate this feat on the road, where
the officials aren't as friendly.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured that I'm going to play the way I know how to play, I'm
not going to change my game," O'Neal said of Friday's effort. "A
couple of games, I was trying to be cute."</TE>

<HD>Red Sox Take Lowe Road to Defeat Yankees Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Derek Lowe overcame two rain delays to pitch six scoreless innings
and the Boston Red Sox won another road game, ending a seven-game
losing streak at Yankee Stadium with a 5-2 victory over New York on
Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Nomar Garciaparra tripled and scored on a wild pitch from David
Wells (6-2) to give Boston the lead in the sixth inning. Jason
Varitek hit a two-run double and Tony Clark had a two-run homer as
the Red Sox broke the game open in the eighth.</LD>
<LD>   Boston, which has won six of nine from New York this season,
became the first team in major league history to start a season 21-4
away from home.</LD>
<TE>   The game was delayed twice by rain: for 55 minutes at the start
and 74 minutes in the bottom of the first. The fans who sat through
the delays weren't rewarded with any Yankees runs until Jorge
Posada's two-run homer in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   New York had won five in a row and 18 of 22, hitting 45 homers in
that stretch, but they couldn't generate anything against Lowe (8-2),
who hasn't given up a homer all season.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe gave up four hits and a season-high five walks but avoided
any damage by inducing three double-play grounders and holding New
York hitless in five at-bats with runners in scoring position. He
lowered his AL-leading earned-run average to 1.95.</TE>
<TE>   New York had won the last seven meetings at Yankee Stadium last
year, outscoring Boston 39-19.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 4, Detroit 2--Carlos Delgado tripled and homered, driving
in three runs to help the Blue Jays end a six-game losing streak with
a victory at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Esteban Loaiza (3-1) defeated the Tigers for the third time in a
row, giving up two runs and nine hits and no walks in 71/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Bernero (1-1) took the loss in his second start of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 13, Tampa Bay 9--Miguel Tejada, Jermaine Dye and Eric
Chavez hit consecutive RBI singles during a four-run ninth inning to
lead the Athletics at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays lost despite scoring eight runs in the fourth, all
with two out.</TE>
<TE>   Plate umpire Steve Rippley was taken off the field on a stretcher
after being hit in the left temple by a ball in the sixth inning. He
was alert and talking as he was taken to the hospital for
examination.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 10, Texas 7--Carlos Beltran, Mike Sweeney and Joe
Randa hit consecutive homers in the 11th inning on five pitches from
closer Hideki Irabu to lift the Royals at Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Beltran hit a grand slam in a six-run seventh, then broke a 7-7
tie with a one-out solo shot in the 11th off Irabu (2-4). Beltran had
his fifth career multihomer game. Sweeney and Randa followed with
homers for a 10-7 lead, sending the Royals to their fifth win in six
games.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 7, Chicago 0--Bartolo Colon pitched his second shutout
of the season, leading the Indians at Cleveland and handing the White
Sox their fifth loss in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Einar Diaz broke out of an 0-for-22 slump to drive in three runs
and Jim Thome homered. The Indians scored six runs with two outs.</TE>

<HD>Orioles' Late Comeback Stops Mariners</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>The Baltimore Orioles accomplished what no team had done this season:
defeat the Seattle Mariners with a late rally.</LD>
<LD>   Geronimo Gil drove in the winning run with a sacrifice fly in the
bottom of the 10th inning, capping an improbable comeback that gave
Baltimore an 8-7 victory Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Singleton, Tony Batista and Jeff Conine homered for the
Orioles, who trailed, 5-0, in the third inning and 7-3 in the
seventh. It was Conine's ninth home run of the season and fourth in
three games.</LD>
<TE>   John Olerud homered and Ichiro Suzuki had three hits for Seattle.
The Mariners had been 24-0 when leading after seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we think we're ever out of it, even against the
best team in the American League," Conine said.</TE>
<TE>   Conine started the 10th with a single off John Halama (2-1). Marty
Cordova then had a sacrifice bunt, and a wild throw to first by
Halama enabled the runners to move to second and third.</TE>
<TE>   After Brian Roberts entered as a pinch-runner for Conine, Batista
was given an intentional walk. Seattle Manager Lou Piniella brought
left fielder Mark McLemore in as an extra infielder, but Gil lofted a
fly to Suzuki in right, and Roberts easily beat the throw to the
plate.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking for a ground ball, popup, a strikeout," Piniella
said. "That ball was too deep, plus we had our outfielder in. He
didn't have any momentum coming in for the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Bauer (3-2) pitched the 10th for the Orioles, who improved to
5-0 in extra innings this season.</TE>
<TE>   "This club battles real hard," Baltimore Manager Mike Hargrove
said. "There are times, experience-wise, we don't match up. But in
terms of effort, mental toughness and determination, I don't know of
anybody who plays this game as hard as this ballclub."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Jarrod Washburn was a bit unnerved. This was Thursday afternoon, and
he was about to sit down for a live ESPN interview regarding steroid
use in the major leagues. The subject was controversial, Washburn was
uncomfortable coming off as some sort of spokesman on the issue, and
you don't get a second chance on live television.</LD>
<LD>   If it's showtime, Washburn might be rattled. If it's game time, he
never is.</LD>
<LD>   With their unflappable ace showing the way, the Angels rebounded
from one of their most disastrous defeats of the season with one of
their most impressive victories. As Washburn rebuffed the Minnesota
Twins time and again, the Angels pounded and then dismissed their
longtime nemesis, Eric Milton, en route to an 11-3 victory Friday.</LD>
<TE>   The final four batters in the Angel lineup had 11 of the 16 hits,
including four from Bengie Molina and three from Scott Spiezio. The
Angels ended April 6 1/2 games out of first place and ended May three
games out, and they closed out the month by setting a club record for
victories in May, with 19.</TE>
<TE>   The last one meant the most. The Angels led 5-0 in the third
inning and 6-4 in the eighth inning Thursday before losing the game.
That bitter aftertaste can only be removed with victory and, as
second baseman Adam Kennedy said before Friday's game, "We've got the
right guy for it."</TE>
<TE>   That would be Washburn, who won his fifth consecutive decision and
has not lost since April 13.</TE>
<TE>   This is what he survived Friday: Second inning, bases loaded, one
out and an unearned run already in--no more runs scored. Fifth
inning, runners on second and third, none out--no runs scored. Sixth
inning, second and third, none out--one run scored, on a sacrifice
fly.</TE>
<TE>   Did any of the situations rattle him?</TE>
<TE>   "Does anything ever?" he shot back.</TE>
<TE>   Well, no, at least not on a baseball field.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though he's not throwing 95 or 96, he's kind of an
intimidating pitcher out there," Spiezio said. "He doesn't back down
and say, oh, I better make the perfect pitch. He just keeps throwing
hard.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like every situation he's in, whether it's a tough
situation early or late, he always seems to bear down and get out of
it. As a defensive player behind him, you get a lot of confidence."</TE>
<TE>   The confidence-building did not stop when the Angels put down
their gloves and picked up their bats.</TE>
<TE>   To the Angels, Milton as the opposing pitcher is never a welcome
sight. He threw a no-hitter against them three years ago, and he
never had lost to them. In seven starts against the Angels, he had
given up eight earned runs.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up seven Friday, in 3 1/3 innings. By the fourth inning,
every Angel starter had a hit. The Angels led 7-1 after four innings
and 9-1 after five, and Washburn ensured there would be no reprise of
Thursday's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   The happiest of the hitting heroes was Molina. He even scored from
third on a wild pitch, a strictly occasional event for the slowest
guy on the team. He smiled about that play but turned serious in
discussing his four hits, since he batted .317 in April but .225 from
May 1-30.</TE>
<TE>   "I got lucky four times," he said. "But you know what? It made me
feel good, after a whole month with no hits."</TE>
<TE>   All in all, Washburn and his mates put on a pretty good show for
the busloads who flocked from his Wisconsin home two hours away. He
grew up rooting for the Milwaukee Brewers and the New York Yankees,
but he attended his share of ballgames in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Now all the kids in his hometown come here to watch him, and they
were not disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn was, but only mildly. In 76 major league starts, he has
yet to throw a shutout. Maybe here, next time.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal is to go out and throw a shutout every time," he said.
"Obviously, I've never achieved my goal. Some day, I might."</TE>

<HD>Kennedy Is Making Most of Opportunity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>On Thursday, second baseman Adam Kennedy tied a career high with four
hits. On Friday, he started against a left-handed pitcher for the
first time since April 9. He got two more hits, and Manager Mike
Scioscia said Kennedy could remain in the lineup full time if he
keeps hitting.</LD>
<LD>   When the Angels acquired Kennedy in the trade that sent All-Star
outfielder Jim Edmonds to St. Louis two years ago, they billed him as
their second baseman for the next decade. But they limited him to
platoon status in the second half last season and the first two
months this season, and slick-fielding prospect Alfredo Amezaga could
push David Eckstein from shortstop to second base next season--and
could push Kennedy to the bench or to another team.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a big year," Kennedy said. "They'll make a decision on
whether they want me around for longer than this year, and that
depends on me. I have to take care of that.</LD>
<TE>   "And, the more we win, the better team chemistry we'll have, and
the more reason they'll have to keep me."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy is batting .276. In his last 16 games, he has scored 10
runs and driven in nine.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels promoted Amezaga for a few days as an injury
replacement, and his four-hit game Tuesday prompted some fans to
wonder why the team didn't stay with the rookie and bench Kennedy.
But in his first full season at triple-A, Amezaga is batting .235.</TE>
<TE>   "Kennedy is fine," General Manager Bill Stoneman said. "His
defense has really picked up. With him and [Jose] Nieves and Benji
[Gil], we've got the guys for that job.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to keep Amezaga playing all the time. There's no
question about his defensive ability. If his bat was where his
defensive ability is now, he'd be an everyday major leaguer. It's
going to take a little more time for that to happen."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Twins will induct Bert Blyleven into their hall of fame
tonight. Blyleven, whose career included 11 seasons with the Twins
and two with the Angels, ranks fourth on the all-time strikeout list.</TE>

<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Atlanta outfielder Gary Sheffield has spent more time in the training
room than on the field.</LD>
<LD>   Sheffield, one of the off-season's biggest acquisitions, hasn't
done much for his new team. First, it was a wrist injury. Then, a
pulled hamstring. Heading into Friday night's game at Cincinnati, the
feared slugger was batting .243 with six homers and 18 runs batted
in.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, Sheffield refuses to let himself get frustrated. Just the
opposite, in fact.</LD>
<TE>   "The most peace I've ever felt about myself is this year," he
said. "I've finally got a perspective on things--the good and the
bad. I've been blessed with a lot of talent. When I get healthy, I'll
be able to display that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis manager Tony La Russa defended former Cardinal slugger
Mark McGwire as speculation builds about steroid use in the major
leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt in my mind," La Russa said Friday before the
Cardinals played the Pirates. "I was here, I saw him in the gym
early, I saw how he took care of himself. He ate protein."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Texas Ranger catcher Ivan Rodriguez, a 10-time All-Star, is
scheduled to catch for the first time in two months today during an
extended spring game. Rodriguez, on the disabled list because of a
herniated disk in his back, could rejoin the Rangers at the end of
next week.... The Minnesota Twins put pitcher Brad Radke back on the
disabled list after he threw just 12 pitches Thursday in a start
against the Angels. He aggravated a pulled right groin muscle.</TE>

<LD>Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "The steroid controversy
is amazing. Not the idea that modern-day athletes would use illegal
stuff to play better. What's amazing is that baseball players have
found a way to make themselves even less attractive to the public.</LD>
<LD>   "It wasn't enough that they're wildly rich and are threatening to
strike to get richer, or that the Strawberries and Rockers make the
game look bad, or that players are emotionally aloof from fans, or
that they [players, not fans] spit, scratch, swear and abuse tobacco

<HD>Barre's Home Run Leads Trojans Past BYU in 12th</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Failing to drive in the winning run in the ninth inning was on USC
center fielder Brian Barre's mind as he strode to the plate in the
12th inning.</LD>
<LD>   Barre didn't take long to atone for his missed opportunity. He led
off the 12th by hitting the first pitch from Sam Fernley over the
center-field wall to give the Trojans a 5-4 victory over Brigham
Young in the opening game of an NCAA baseball regional Friday at
Dedeaux Field.</LD>
<LD>   The victory sent USC into the winner's bracket where it will face
Cal State Northridge today in a 3 p.m. game. The Trojans (35-22) won
despite making a number of mental and physical errors on defense and
their potent offense being held in check most of the game.</LD>
<TE>   "We lose this game and we have to come back with a doubleheader
[today] and a doubleheader on Sunday," Barre said. "For us to win
today was huge."</TE>
<TE>   Barre could have won the game in the ninth inning after the
Trojans tied it at 4-4 on a sacrifice fly by Jon Brewster. But with
the winning run at third base and one out, the senior struck out on a
changeup by Cougar reliever James Ray.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty upset after the ninth because I didn't want to let
the team down," said Barre, who has 12 home runs this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad I had a second chance."</TE>
<TE>   BYU (29-30-1), which upset San Diego State to win the Mountain
West Conference tournament, never trailed until Barre's hit. Jeff
Mousser limited USC to three runs and five hits over that stretch as
he continually frustrated the Trojans with his off-speed pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "Mousser did a great job of mixing his pitches," USC Coach Mike
Gillespie said. "He made it tough for guys to get on balance and get
some great swings."</TE>
<TE>   BYU Coach Vance Law let Mousser pitch the ninth and it cost him.
With the Cougars leading, 4-3, Anthony Lunetta worked the count and
drew a leadoff walk. Travis McAndrews then flashed a bunt attempt and
bounced a double down the right-field line over first baseman Dave
Jensen.</TE>
<TE>   Law then replaced Mousser with Tyler Dabo, who walked Kris Cox to
load the bases. Brewster, who had a sacrifice fly in the fifth
inning, then hit Dabo's first pitch deep to center field to score
Lunetta with the tying run.</TE>
<TE>   "I second-guessed myself for letting Jeff Mousser go out there in
the ninth," Law said. "He was getting tired and we had a fresh
bullpen available."</TE>
<TE>   Gillespie said McAndrews' hit keyed the inning. "It's called a
slash and run play and it's mostly about getting your pitch,"
Gillespie said. "We practice that to hit over third base unless you
get a pitch inside. It's a great play when it works."</TE>
<TE>   USC won despite a so-so effort from ace Anthony Reyes and a
defense that made two errors and blew a rundown behind him.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Bannister had another stellar outing in relief as he threw
six shutout innings and struck out six.</TE>
<TE>   Since being knocked out in the first inning of a May 19 loss at
Arizona State, the freshman has allowed one run in his last 15
innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it when the game is on the line," Bannister said. "To be
able to be in that situation has been fun."</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge 7, Maine 4--Third baseman Ryan Haag hit a
grand slam and Kameron Loe struck out 10 in 82/3 innings as the
Matadors showed no ill effects from a 12-day layoff in beating the
Black Bears in the second regional game at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Northridge (41-15) has won six in a row and 16 of 18. The Matadors
will play USC for the first time since a three-game series in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Haag ripped a double to lead off the first and continued to third

<DL>BATON ROUGE, La.</DL>
<LD>That USC-UCLA duel for the women's NCAA track and field championship
isn't materializing quite as expected.</LD>
<LD>   It's looking more like UCLA and the "other" USC--the University of
South Carolina--entering the final day of competition today at
Louisiana State's Bernie Moore Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The defending champion Trojans are in fourth place and not in good
position even though Angela Williams will attempt to win a fourth
title in the 100 meters.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA--ranked No. 1--is in first with 44 points after winning its
third individual championship Friday when Chaniqua Ross took the
discus with a throw of 182 feet. Teammate Lara Saye was fifth. (UCLA
already had titles from Tracy O'Hara in the pole vault and Darnesha
Griffith in the high jump.)</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina--a school that has never won a team title in any
sport in its 200-year history--is second with 40 points, followed by
Florida (24) and USC (19).</TE>
<TE>   The Gamecocks were bolstered by a victory in the 400-meter
relay--USC took third--and a dominating performance in the 400-meter
hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina freshman Leshinda Demus set a world junior record
in that race, winning in 54.85 seconds to break the mark of 55.20 set
by Leslie Maxie of the United States in 1984. The Gamecocks also took
second and sixth to score 21 points in the event.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's been talking UCLA, USC, but we know South Carolina is
very into this," UCLA Coach Jeanette Bolden said. "They've been up
there ranked No. 1 this year too. We know they're totally capable of
doing what they did today."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins also earned points on Sheena Johnson's fourth in the
400-meter hurdles in a personal-best 55.71 seconds, the fourth-best
mark in school history.</TE>
<TE>   USC scored with a third-place finish by the 400-meter relay team
of Williams, Disia Page, Natasha Neal and Kinshasa Davis in
43.80--the Trojans' fourth consecutive top-three NCAA finish in that
event--and Aleksandra Deren's seventh-place finish in the 800 meters.</TE>
<TE>   "In this meet, South Carolina and UCLA are doing everything they
need to do and doing it well and deserve to win," USC Coach Ron
Allice said. "We've had some letdowns, but that's part of track."</TE>
<TE>   The focal point today will be the women's 100. Williams eased into
the final with an 11.41 in the semifinals, finishing second to
teammate Natasha Mayers in her heat.</TE>
<TE>   Mayers, who became eligible for the Trojans last month after
transferring from L.A. Southwest College, had the fastest time
(11.28).</TE>
<TE>   The other competition is LSU's Muna Lee. South Carolina sprinter
Aleen Bailey didn't make the final after being disqualified for a
false start.</TE>
<TE>   Mayers is intriguing because of her late arrival, and because of
her times.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Williams, she has been below the public radar.</TE>
<TE>   "She's my teammate. We're just going into the race trying to win
together," Mayers said.</TE>
<TE>   In the men's competition, LSU leads with 39 points, with South
Carolina, Florida, Tennessee and Georgia in the mix.</TE>
<TE>   USC is tied for 11th after Julian Kapek finished third in the
triple jump with a mark of 54-43/4.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans' 400-meter relay team ran a season-best 39.27 to
finish fifth.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruin men picked up their first points with a strong
performance in the discus. Scott Moser was fourth and Dan Ames was
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Top-ranked Georgia Tech and Alabama Birmingham's Graeme McDowell
overcame the difficult conditions to top the team and individual
leaderboards at the NCAA men's golf championships at Upper Arlington,
Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Tulsa is second in the team race, a stroke behind the Yellow
Jackets. McDowell leads the individual race at eight-under 205.
Oklahoma State's Hunter Mahan (67) was a shot back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's Stacey Nuveman and Natasha Watley and Arizona's Jennie
Finch are finalists for the USA Softball collegiate player of the
year.</TE>

<HD>Zone Defense Impresses U.S.</HD>
<DH>Soccer: A four-hour visit to Korea's DMZ is an eye-opening
experience for young players on American team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PANMUNJOM, Korea</DL>
<LD>It was an almost surreal scene. Believable because it was right there
in plain view, but at the same time mirage-like as it shimmered in
the mid-morning haze. There but not there.</LD>
<LD>   Picture it now:</LD>
<LD>   In the foreground, U.S. World Cup soccer players and coaches in
dark blue warmups mingle and joke with American and South Korean
soldiers in camouflage fatigues as they pose together for a
photograph.</LD>
<TE>   In the middle ground--literally, since this is the DMZ, the
demilitarized zone that divides the Korean peninsula--small groups of
infantrymen stare each other down across a not-so-imaginary line
drawn in the sand.</TE>
<TE>   In the background, on the far side of the line, another group
poses for a photograph, this one composed of Chinese tourists, the
women holding pastel sunshades of pink and blue and yellow and green.</TE>
<TE>   This, American visitors are told, is what President Clinton once
called "the most dangerous place on Earth." The air of menace is real
even if the entire scene is surreal.</TE>
<TE>   American soldiers speak of being taunted on an almost daily basis,
of North Korean soldiers making throat-slitting gestures toward them.
Sometimes the violence turns real with the kidnapping or killing of
South Korean villagers who live within the DMZ.</TE>
<TE>   A row of huts defines the border point, two silver and three blue.
The soldiers are positioned on each side of the line that bisects the
huts, but they differ radically in appearance and attitude.</TE>
<TE>   On the one side, locked in an intentionally menacing taekwondo
stance, arms akimbo and wraparound sunglasses firmly in place, are a
half-dozen Republic of Korea soldiers, each positioned so that only
half his body is visible beyond the corner of each hut. It makes for
a smaller target.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side, in drab khaki-colored uniforms with a red
insignia on the sleeves, is the enemy, the North Korean soldiers who
occasionally turn their heads to glare at their counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. players and coaches, at least those who on Friday chose
not to golf, were flown into the DMZ from Seoul aboard a U.S. Army
Chinook helicopter, landing at Camp Liberty Bell and then being bused
up to the actual frontier.</TE>
<TE>   They spent more than four hours visiting the United Nations
Command Security Battalion in what is known as the Joint Security
Area shared by American and South Korean forces. The experience,
which included sharing a meal and signing soccer balls and team
jerseys for the troops, left its mark on the younger U.S. players.</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder Landon Donovan, 20, was awestruck.</TE>
<TE>   "Awesome," he said. "It's amazing to realize what these people do
on a day-to-day basis. It's incredible. I don't know what more you
can say. It's good to know that they take it so seriously, as they
should. It's just different, it puts things in perspective, that's
for sure."</TE>
<TE>   Winger DaMarcus Beasley, 20, also was taken aback.</TE>
<TE>   "I was clueless until today," he said. "People take for granted
what goes on in the world. You forget how much people do for our
country. This is a way of seeing what they do day in and day out."</TE>
<TE>   Most interesting, said defender Steve Cherundolo, 23, was "being
so close to the border and the North Koreans and then seeing the
guards there and their posture and the way that they kind of looked
at our guards. It's something I've only read about. I'm glad I came."</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeeper Tony Meola, a veteran at 33, was equally impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole fact that they had a North Korean tour going on at the
same time was strange," he said. "In the last couple of years I've
become a little bit of a history buff, so this is kind of neat for me
to come here.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes you first appreciate what these guys do but second it
opens your eyes to a whole different world. I don't know that I could
have gone through what some of these guys have been through to get
here. There are some pretty impressive guys here."</TE>
<TE>   It was late afternoon before the Chinook took off again, Coach
Bruce Arena wearing an Army helmet and grinning broadly from the
helicopter window. As the players and coaches flew back over the rice
paddies and the miles of barbed wire that line the Han River, they
had time to realize that there is real world beyond the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Even if it sometimes seems surreal.</TE>

<HD>Johnson Stands Tall in 6-3 Win</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Five days after struggling against Dodgers, he
goes eight strong innings in Diamondbacks' victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Randy Johnson has a good memory, so the Dodgers figured the most
dominant pitcher in the major leagues would have extra incentive
Friday night in the first game of a series between the National
League West's top teams.</LD>
<LD>   The Big Unit left his last start infuriated after squandering a
big early lead to the Dodgers, and he released his anger with a
workmanlike performance in a 6-3 victory at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   A sellout crowd of 54,252 was divided between the action on the
field and the events at Staples Center, many fans using radios and
small TVs to stay in tune with every play in Game 6 of the Western
Conference finals between the Lakers and Sacramento Kings.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson was focused on the Dodgers, and it showed.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-10 left-hander wasn't as overpowering as usual, giving
up six hits and striking out only four with a walk in an effective
eight-inning, 107-pitch outing. Marquis Grissom provided the Dodgers'
runs with a three-run home run in the seventh--his seventh this
season and third against Johnson in two games. The runs, though, were
unearned because of third baseman Craig Counsell's error. Closer
Byung-Hyun Kim pitched the ninth for his 14th save.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks turned three double plays behind Johnson (9-1),
helping him win for the third time in his last four starts.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the best pitcher in baseball, and we had success against him
the last time, which is a rare thing," right fielder Shawn Green
said. "He's the kind of pitcher who likes to come out and turn the
tables quickly once a team has success against him."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson did that, taking command from the outset after getting a
frustrating no-decision last Sunday in the Diamondbacks' 10-9,
10-inning victory at Bank One Ballpark. The four-time Cy Young award
winner failed to preserve a 4-0 lead in the first inning, giving up
eight hits--including three home runs--and seven earned runs in five
innings.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't need an extra something, but he's got a very good
memory," Manager Jim Tracy said of Johnson. "He's obviously one of
the premier guys in the business, and guys like that, after an outing
like he had last Sunday, normally like to try to rebound as soon as
possible."</TE>
<TE>   The division-leading Diamondbacks (34-20) batted around in the
fourth, scoring five runs on six hits, the big blow being Greg
Colbrunn's three-run double. Counsell, a former Dodger, also
contributed a two-run single in the inning, helping Arizona improve
to 3-1 against the Dodgers (31-23).</TE>
<TE>   Omar Daal (4-1) had a rough outing, getting pounded for 10 hits
and six earned runs in six innings. The left-hander, beginning his
second rotation stint in place of the injured Kevin Brown, had easily
his worst performance since joining the club.</TE>
<TE>   Daal, whose versatility has been a key to the Dodgers' strong
start, gave up more earned runs Friday than he had in his first 41
innings. His earned-run average increased from 0.88 to 1.91.</TE>
<TE>   "He pitched a hell of a lot better than his numbers indicate,"
Tracy said. "He deserved better than he got."</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks got started quickly against Daal, staking Johnson
to a 1-0 lead in the first on Jose Guillen's two-out, run-scoring
single to shallow center.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Finley and Damian Miller had consecutive singles to start
the fourth inning and advanced on Tony Womack's sacrifice bunt. After
Johnson struck out, Counsell singled up the middle past diving second
baseman Mark Grudzielanek, extending the lead to 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Spivey singled through the hole at short, putting runners
at first and second and prompting pitching coach Jim Colborn to visit
the mound. Daal continued to struggle after his chat with Colborn,
giving up an infield single to Luis Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Colbrunn.</TE>
<TE>   With the bases loaded, he sent a shot off the Dodger bullpen fence
that rolled into shallow left. By the time Brian Jordan retrieved it,
Colbrunn had a bases-clearing double and the Diamondbacks led, 6-0.</TE>

<HD>Slump Got Benched Along With Green</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Scouts who follow the Dodgers said Shawn Green is not doing anything
differently at the plate that would explain his torrid stretch after
a horrendous slump.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning play Friday, Green was batting .475 (19 for 40) with 10
home runs, including four against the Milwaukee Brewers on May 23, 18
runs batted in and 15 scored in his previous 10 games.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Jim Tracy gave Green a day off May 18 at the nadir of his
season-long slump--then Green got rolling. So were his problems all
mental?</LD>
<TE>   "When you come to the stadium and put on the uniform without the
thoughts and stress you're putting on every single day when you're
struggling, it's a nice change," he said. "It's almost like you can
put on the uniform with good feelings again.</TE>
<TE>   "You know you're not going to have to go through any mental
turmoil because you're not out there. It changes your perspective a
little bit."</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Eric Karros said the day off was the key for Green.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't speak for other sports, but in this game they talk about
the mental part being so important," he said. "For me, you don't need
any more evidence than what went on with Greenie."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have not had more than two players selected to an
All-Star game since five represented the club in 1995, but three
could be on this season's National League squad.</TE>
<TE>   Several baseball officials said they expect Green, starter
Kazuhisa Ishii and closer Eric Gagne to participate in the July 9
game at Miller Park in Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii, scheduled to start Sunday against the Arizona Diamondbacks,
is 8-1 with a 2.90 earned-run average in his first season in the
majors. Gagne has emerged as one of baseball's top closers in his
first season in that role, converting 18 of 19 save opportunities
with a 1.65 ERA before the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy also believes Green, Ishii and Gagne are worthy of being

<KH>CHARTING THE LEAD: A look at the Lakers' lead or deficit by
the minute</KH>
<HD>SACRAMENTO VS. LAKERS/ GAME 6 REPORT</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST QUARTER: SACRAMENTO 26 LAKERS 28</LD>
<LD>   Highlight reel: The game begins and the bricks fly. Neither team
can shoot to start Game 6. The pressure was squarely on the Lakers'
shoulders since they needed a victory or would be on vacation today.
The Kings were loose before the game, displaying hardly any nervous
energy in their locker room. So what gives? Why would the Lakers come
out and miss 10 of their first 15 shots? Why would the Kings miss 10
of their first 13? Clearly, neither team was at its best in the early
minutes. The Lakers had to be better, but they were not--a bad omen
to start their most important game of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: The Shaq Factor. It was evident early that
Shaquille O'Neal was prepared to carry the Lakers into a Game 7 on
his shoulders if needed. He ran harder than he had since the
clinching Game 5 against the San Antonio Spurs, consistently beating
both Vlade Divac and Chris Webber up and down the floor.</LD>
<TE>   Winning numbers: The Lakers closed this quarter by making six of
eight shots.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: The Kings' 34.8% shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 11, Kobe Bryant 9; Kings--Webber
10, Mike Bibby 7.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal and Bryant 5; Kings--Divac 7,
Scot Pollard 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SECOND QUARTER: SACRAMENTO 56 LAKERS 51</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: The Kings closed the quarter with three-point
baskets from Doug Christie and Divac (at the buzzer), taking the lead
from the Lakers in the last 39 seconds. What was most disturbing
about the Kings' shots, if you were a Laker or a Laker fan, was that
no one in a gold uniform was in the same zip code as Christie and
Divac. At this stage, the Lakers have to defend better than they did
in the closing seconds. After all, their season and their status as a
budding dynasty was on the line in Game 6.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: A sense of desperation on the Kings' part.
Although they were shooting poorly, they never panicked, never went
away from the style of play that had them on the brink of eliminating
the two-time defending champion Lakers. They plugged away and took a
five-point lead by halftime. There was a sense that the Kings would
get better, smoothing out the rough edges to their game in the second
half.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: The Kings' 16-8 rebounding edge.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Bibby's 0-for-4 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 10, Rick Fox 5; Kings--Divac 9,
Hedo Turkoglu 7.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal, Bryant and Devean George 2;
Kings--Divac 4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIRD QUARTER: SACRAMENTO 75 LAKERS 75</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: The stage was set for the Lakers' best basketball
of the series. O'Neal was getting warmed up in easily his best game
of the playoffs. Bryant moved better than at any time in the series.
And yet the best the Lakers could do after three quarters was a tie.
That didn't bode well for the fourth, but the Lakers were in better
shape than if they had trailed. The Kings stuck to them like glue,
making key baskets whenever it seemed the Lakers were about to pull
away.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Much of anything from Divac in this quarter.
Strapped with fouls, he was a non-factor, failing to score or take a
rebound. It made the tie score all the more remarkable since Divac
has played O'Neal so tough throughout the series. With Divac on the
bench, O'Neal was free to control the game. He had eight points and
five rebounds in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: The Lakers' nine-for-18 shooting and
five-for-five free-throw shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: The Kings' eight-for-21 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 9, O'Neal 8; Kings--Bibby 10,
Webber 4.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 5; Kings--Webber 5, Christie 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH QUARTER: SACRAMENTO 102 LAKERS 106</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: You knew there would be a Game 7 when the New
Jersey Nets eliminated the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference
finals. There was no way NBC would be allowed to go without a game
Saturday or Sunday. Conspiracy theories aside, the Lakers had to do
the right things down the stretch to subdue the Kings. Fouling out
Divac and Pollard was perhaps the best result the Lakers could have
hoped for. The Lakers' dominant play inside was the key. It's
something they'll have to do Sunday if they hope to win on the Kings'
home floor. They must take the ball to the basket and force the
referees to blow the whistle.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Once more into the Little House on the
Prairie, where the Lakers played near-flawless basketball in Game 1,
were so-so in Game 2 and strong again in Game 5. The Lakers must
continue to get superb play from Bryant and O'Neal, muzzle Bibby and
control the play near the basket.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: The Lakers' 21-for-27 free-throw shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: Four points; the best the Lakers could manage was a
four-point margin of victory.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 12, Bryant 11; Kings--Webber 8,
Bibby 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 5, Bryant 3; Kings--Webber 5,
Christie 2.</TE>

<HD>Belgian Awful: Clijsters Loses, 6-4, 6-0</HD>
<DH>Tennis: 2001 finalist is routed by 87th-ranked Fernandez
and joins countrywoman Henin on French Open sideline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>There were two ways to look at the first two ragged rounds of 2001
French Open finalist Kim Clijsters of Belgium. Either her trials
would make her better in the latter stages or this fragility was a
precursor of an early exit.</LD>
<LD>   The answer came Friday, in 66 minutes. Clarisa Fernandez of
Argentina turned in the first week's biggest upset on the women's
side, defeating the fourth-seeded Clijsters, 6-4, 6-0, in the third
round at the French Open. Well ... make that the most significant
result since an ailing Justine Henin, another Belgian, lost Tuesday
to the unheralded Aniko Kapros of Hungary.</LD>
<LD>   A week ago, the Belgians were considered potential winners.
Clijsters had established herself as a viable contender by defeating
Venus Williams in the Hamburg final. Henin, a 2001 French Open
semifinalist, had split two finals against Serena Williams in May.</LD>
<TE>   At least there was an obvious reason for Henin's loss, as she was
visibly sick. Clijsters said her often-injured arm did not bother her
against the left-handed Fernandez, but she appeared to lack the
energy and patience to work the points on a clay court. Fernandez,
ranked 87th, had never won a Grand Slam match before the French Open.</TE>
<TE>   "My whole body just felt a little more heavier," said Clijsters,
who had 59 unforced errors and lost the final eight games. "I tried
to go for too many shots."</TE>
<TE>   Said the sixth-seeded Monica Seles, who beat Ludmilla Cervanova of
Slovakia, 6-2, 6-2: "This is the one tournament in the past that has
very unpredictable winners--as we've seen. So who knows? Kim and
Justine both losing in the early rounds, I did not expect that."</TE>
<TE>   It was a day of up-and-down emotions at Roland Garros. Because of
the early afternoon World Cup soccer match between France and
Senegal, there were more spectators watching tennis around noon than
at 2 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   An afternoon bomb scare also rattled nerves on the grounds. Court
1 was evacuated during the third set of the match between Carlos Moya
of Spain and Guillermo Canas of Argentina when security agents
discovered an abandoned briefcase and overcoat in the upper deck.
Officials asked for spectators to calmly leave, the players were
taken off for 40 minutes, and the bomb squad went into action,
exploding the briefcase as a precaution (there was no bomb).</TE>
<TE>   "Well, this is something that never happened before when I've been
playing," Moya said.</TE>
<TE>   The 15th-seeded Canas beat Moya, 4-6, 7-6 (1), 6-7 (2), 6-1, 6-2,
in 4 hours 28 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Though the main show court was only one-third full during Lleyton
Hewitt's match, which was played during the soccer game, drama
returned by nightfall. The most electric match was between Arnaud
Clement of France and 2001 finalist Alex Corretja of Spain; it lasted
4 hours 11 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Corretja won, 6-1, 6-2, 4-6, 5-7, 8-6, and the fifth set lasted 79
minutes. He survived four match points and on one of them, Clement
had the chance to put it away with an easy volley but hit it back to
Corretja. The crowd started to celebrate when Clement went for the
volley, and Corretja was as surprised as anyone to get another crack
at it.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw he was going to volley one meter from the net, I
thought it was over," Corretja said. "I thought it was kind of a
miracle.... If I have a few more matches like this, I will truly
die."</TE>
<TE>   After Corretja shook hands with Clement, he dropped to his knees
and kissed the clay.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the taste of clay in my mouth and it's an awful taste,"
Corretja said. "If I could have reached God, I would have kissed God
Himself."</TE>

<HD>Vagenas Has Learned to Enjoy Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coming off the field after playing 45 minutes of the Galaxy's 3-0
exhibition victory over CD Aguila of El Salvador Wednesday night,
Peter Vagenas was approached by Sigi Schmid.</LD>
<LD>   The Galaxy coach wanted to know how his midfielder felt after
Vagenas had logged the most time in a game since starting the season
on the injured list because of a strained lower back.</LD>
<LD>   "I told him that it was just fun," said Vagenas, who said he
initially tweaked his back playing pick-up basketball with teammates
two days before the Galaxy began training camp.</LD>
<TE>   With the Galaxy's franchise-record five-game Major League Soccer
trip coming to a close today at Colorado, Vagenas is expected to have
more fun while making his biggest contribution of the MLS season.</TE>
<TE>   But while some see Vagenas regaining his starting position against
the Rapids, he prefers to take it slowly, as in off the bench after
halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Schmid was noncommittal.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel pretty comfortable right now playing him 45 minutes,"
Schmid said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether we can play him more, we'll have to see. I think he helps
us ... retain possession of the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Vagenas came off the injured list on May 22 and last week at New
England played only the last 19 minutes of the Galaxy's 3-2 loss.</TE>
<TE>   Having been the Galaxy's leader in appearances (26) last season,
being forced to sit out the first nine weeks of this season was
disconcerting.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing kind of lingered on," Vagenas said. "It was scary
because it was the first time my body didn't really respond to
treatment and it wouldn't get better right away.</TE>
<TE>   "After we shut it down completely for the six weeks, it healed
up."</TE>
<TE>   Vagenas, 24, said the worst he had suffered before were ankle
injuries that healed relatively quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been the biggest trial of my career thus far, even though
my career is rather young," said the third-year player out of UCLA.
"It's just been mentally draining, not being able to do something
physically that you wake up and have been able to do every day.</TE>
<TE>   "But at the same time, I think it was a blessing because you take
it for granted and as a player you come out, sometimes, maybe you're
a little wishy-washy about practice, maybe you're a little tired ...
you're not really into it."</TE>
<TE>   The time away, though, gave Vagenas a chance to reflect.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a vow to myself that when I came back, every single
practice I'd go out there with the energy of wanting to play," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I can easily remember the times when I was stuck on the training
room or I didn't even travel or [was] just sitting on the sidelines."</TE>

<TE>   Update--Colorado captain John Spencer, whose overtime goal gave
the Rapids a 1-0 victory over the Galaxy at the Rose Bowl on April
27, is out after having arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. Former
Galaxy defender Greg Vanney, who suffered a knee injury playing for
the U.S. national team in a World Cup warm-up against Jamaica,
trained with the Galaxy this week. Vanney's MLS contract was
purchased by French first division club Bastia. Retired Galaxy
defender Paul Caligiuri will provide color commentary on today's
telecast. On the injury front: Galaxy midfielder Sasha Victorine
(strained lower back) may come off the bench, and defender Ezra
Hendrickson (hip) might not play at all.</TE>

<LD>OK, g-g-guys, b-b-back to Arco for G-G-Game 7.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings, who hoped to spare themselves this ordeal are going the
distance with the Lakers, who dug themselves out of their hole Friday
night.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, those 27 free throws the Lakers shot in the fourth
quarter, 20 of which went in, helped.</LD>
<TE>   "I just feel sorry for our team," said a steaming King Coach Rick
Adelman. "Cause they did everything they could to win the game. It's
just a shame, It's a real shame....</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you tell me. Our big guys get 20 fouls tonight and Shaq
[O'Neal] gets four. You tell me how the game went. It's just how it
is. They obviously got the game called the way they wanted to get it
called. But I'll tell you what, our guys played their tails off. They
still had a chance to win and I give them credit.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going away Sunday. It's just a shame but you know, Shaq
made his free throws, Kobe [Bryant] made his free throws. They did
what they had to do to win the game. We've got to come back with
resolve on Sunday....</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Shaq has changed the way he's played. He'll do the
same thing. But that's just the way you feel after a game like this
when you have a chance to move on and you didn't do it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're going to dwell on this. We better not. The
seventh game is a different game. We have to get ourselves ready to
go. The season's riding now for both teams on the seventh game...."</TE>
<TE>   As Game 5 in Sacramento revolved around O'Neal's foul troubles,
this one revolved around the foul troubles of everyone Adelman sent
out to guard him.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq went for 41 points and fouled out Vlade Divac and Scot
Pollard, obliging Adelman to put Chris Webber and Lawrence
Funderburke on him additionally, and, probably to ask for volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   It was a scary game for the Lakers, who played well in the first
half, saw O'Neal go for 21 before the intermission, held Mike Bibby
to one make in eight shots ... and still trailed by five points,
after Divac splashed a three-pointer after the first-half horn
sounded.</TE>
<TE>   It was tied going into the fourth quarter, when Shaq, as well as
the officials, Dick Bavetta, Bob Delaney and Ted Bernhardt, went
wild.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal came into this one averaging 27 points in this series, but
only 4.8 of them in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Kings were holding their breath, or wanted to fire
him up by saying anything about it.</TE>
<TE>   Well, the slump is over. O'Neal scored 12 points in Friday night's
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bibby, who had taken over the leadership role for the
Kings, before the horrified eyes of the Lakers, was having a rough
night. He got several calls early, allowing him to make seven of
eight throws, but he didn't get many calls in the fourth quarter,
although he was knocked to the floor several times.</TE>
<TE>   "They did a good job on him," Adelman said. "They hounded him.
[Derek] Fisher, [Lindsey] Hunter, Kobe at the end.... He still
created a lot of havoc out there. You still feel he's going to
respond on Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   As tense as Friday night's game, it may look like a romp on the
beach compared to the one coming Sunday. Game 7s often turn into
choke-a-thons, with players buckling under the waves of pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have the advantage of having their Big Two going again,
and, after two title runs, they've been under pressure before.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, O'Neal has gotten into foul trouble in his last
two games at Arco and is weirded-out to the max about the possibility
the Kings will flop and draw charges on him.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have the advantage of being at home, or as Adelman noted
wryly, "Well, I'd much rather be playing there than here, that's for
sure."</TE>
<TE>   They'd better get Solomon the Wise as the lead official because if
the games that preceded Sunday's mean anything, it's not going to be
a love-fest.</TE>

<HD>The Triple Crown Spoiler?</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Perfect Drift, third at the Derby, sat out
the Preakness but should challenge at the Belmont Stakes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Perfect Drift might have been stabled at a training center five miles
from Churchill Downs before the Kentucky Derby, but it was impossible
for trainer Murray Johnson to sneak his 3-year-old gelding into the
race unnoticed.</LD>
<LD>   Perfect Drift, after all, had won the Spiral Stakes at Turfway
Park in Florence, Ky., 90 miles up the road from Churchill, and by
post time on Derby day he was 7-1, the fourth choice in the field.</LD>
<LD>   With a quarter-mile to go on May 4, Perfect Drift was only a head
behind War Emblem, but there were traffic problems in the stretch and
Johnson's horse finished third, beaten by 43/4 lengths. Johnson
stayed in Kentucky while War Emblem added a Preakness win to his
Derby trophy at Pimlico, but next Saturday in New York, Perfect Drift
will again be a concern for the Triple Crown contender. Skipping the
Preakness to run in the Belmont Stakes is not an unworkable plan; it
worked in spades for Lemon Drop Kid and Commendable, who won in 1999
and 2000.</LD>
<TE>   "The mile-and-a-half [Belmont] distance should be great for my
horse," Johnson said Friday morning at Trackside, an old harness
track that Churchill Downs uses for auxiliary stabling. "He's
training the best ever since I got him. In the Derby, there was no
pace and no race, it was as simple as that. My horse loomed on War
Emblem, but then we got shut off in the stretch by good race-riding
[by War Emblem's Victor Espinoza]. I think we can beat War Emblem
this time, but to do that he'll have to be taken out of his game."</TE>
<TE>   The Australian-born Johnson is considered a former California
horseman who migrated to Kentucky, but actually he began his U.S.
career here after leaving home 20 years ago. Stints with Shug
McGaughey as an exercise rider and Carl Nafzger as an assistant
trainer were followed by a job with John Gosden, the transplanted
Englishman, on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson might still be in California, but when Gosden returned to
England in 1990, not many of his clients felt comfortable entrusting
his trusted assistant with their best horses. Johnson still can't
understand it.</TE>
<TE>   "I ran an entire division for John," Johnson said. "At any one
time, I was in charge of 32 horses. And I mean in charge. I hired
jockeys, picked the races and entered the horses. John just wanted to
know at all times what I was doing. But I was as close as you could
come to calling all the shots. The owners knew that, and seemed to be
happy with what I did. But then John went home, and all of that was
forgotten. The horses were passed around to the established
trainers."</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky racing was enjoying a renaissance, so the move there was
a no-brainer. Johnson even arrived with a Kentucky Derby horse--Green
Alligator, who had won the California Derby. Hardly regarded, Green
Alligator ran as a field horse, an entry the track handicapper felt
had one of the least chances to win, but he finished fourth, only
31/2 lengths behind Strike The Gold. Green Alligator was withheld
from the Preakness, then got sick and couldn't run in the Belmont,
either. Now Johnson is going to New York with Perfect Drift, who'll
try to become only the second gelding--after Creme Fraiche in
1985--to win the Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   If horses react to psychology--who's to say they don't?--then
Perfect Drift, who races for owner-breeder Bill Reed, a Kansas City
heart surgeon, is getting invaluable off-the-track help. Hanging from
the horse's stall is a plastic ball, a plaything, that Johnson
painted with a picture of a horse and the words "War Emblem." With
his nose, Perfect Drift makes a punching bag out of the War Emblem
figure dozens of times a day.</TE>
<TE>   Perfect Drift will have his final Belmont workout today, then,
with Johnson aboard, make the first plane trip of his life next
Wednesday. The real War Emblem will also be on that plane.</TE>
<TE>   "I considered vanning him up to New York," Johnson said. "But the
horse has always been good on all his van rides, so flying ought to
be no problem for him."</TE>
<TE>   In posting three wins, three seconds and one third in seven
starts, Perfect Drift has never run outside Kentucky. He has scored
his three victories at Turfway, where Eddie Delahoussaye, his Belmont
jockey, rode him for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Delahoussaye got the call from Johnson, an old friend from his
California days, when it appeared that Tony D'Amico, the regular
rider on Repent and Harlan's Holiday, wouldn't be available for
Perfect Drift in the Derby. Then D'Amico got bounced off both of his
other horses and has missed the Triple Crown. In Delahoussaye,
Johnson has a rider with a near-perfect Belmont record: victories
with Risen Star in 1988 and A.P. Indy in 1992, and a second aboard
Gato Del Sol in 1982. Delahoussaye has gone to New York only when
he's had a strong hand.</TE>

<HD>FDA Recalling Horse Drug</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The government has ordered a nationwide recall of a horse drug sold
over the Internet called Miracle Leg Paint, because it contains
mercury that is poisonous to horses and people.</LD>
<LD>   Horse owners who have purchased the product should not use it.
Instead, they should contact local waste-management authorities to
determine how to destroy it without endangering animals, people or
waterways, the Food and Drug Administration warned.</LD>
<LD>   Miracle Leg Paint, marketed by Equine Miracle Corp. of Grapeland,
Texas, contains a mercuric chloride blistering agent.</LD>
<TE>   An old folk remedy for lameness and other horse leg ailments was
to irritate the horse's skin with that or similar chemicals, on the
theory that the blister would cause disease-fighting blood cells to
descend on the area and help the original leg ailment, said Dr.
Stephen Sundlof, FDA's veterinary medicine chief.</TE>
<TE>   Only later did scientists discover mercury is toxic, and people
who get mercury-containing agents over much of their skin can become
seriously ill and even die, he added.</TE>
<TE>   An Alabama veterinarian called the FDA on April 30 to say he had
autopsied a horse whose owner had applied Miracle Leg Paint. While
there is no evidence the product played a role in the horse's death,
it did spark an FDA investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Equine Miracle Corp. agreed to recall the product on Thursday.</TE>

<LD>Go ahead, beat Villa Park High in the Southern Section baseball
playoffs. Declare the Spartans' best pitcher ineligible before a
postseason pitch is thrown.</LD>
<LD>   This team will return to form sooner than Silly Putty.</LD>
<LD>   Villa Park is playing Canyon Country Canyon for the Division II
title at 4:30 p.m. today at Edison Field because the Spartans refused
to fold when their ace, Erik Averill, was declared ineligible for the
playoffs after bumping an umpire late in the regular season.</LD>
<TE>   Led by starting pitchers Mike Thompson and Mark Trumbo--neither of
whom was in the Spartans' two-man rotation to start the
season--unseeded Villa Park has made a remarkable playoff run,
knocking off top-seeded Crescenta Valley, 6-0, en route to its second
championship game in three years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a total team effort," said Thompson, a senior shortstop
thrust into the rotation early in the season when Chris Bragg
suffered a partial tear of his left rotator cuff. "Nobody cares who
gets the home run or the RBIs, we just care about getting the win."</TE>
<TE>   Bouncing back from adversity is nothing new for the Spartans.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Villa Park hoisted the Division III championship plaque
at Dodger Stadium eight days after being eliminated in the
quarterfinals. Villa Park was granted a reprieve after Tustin, which
defeated the Spartans, 7-1, was found to have an ineligible player on
its roster.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the loss in the quarterfinals and we got fortunate,"
senior catcher Kirk McConchie said. "This year, we lose one of our
star players and make it to the finals. Unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Averill, a senior, was as valued for his experience as his
statistical contributions. The Arizona State-bound left-hander picked
up the victory in relief in the 2000 title game and was 6-2 with a
3.00 earned-run average and 57 strikeouts in 42 innings this season
when he was suspended for the playoffs by Villa Park Principal Fran
Roney. Averill also was hitting .390 with 16 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Realizing the potentially devastating effects of losing their
standout player, the remaining team captains immediately called a
players-only meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to get the point across that we were strong enough and had
enough synergy," said Bragg, who, along with junior Steve Johns, has
provided strong relief out of the bullpen during the playoffs. "We
had to make the point that we could put any nine guys on that field
and win the game."</TE>
<TE>   Trumbo, a sophomore first baseman and occasional starter who
assumed Averill's spot in the rotation, made a stellar playoff debut,
striking out eight and allowing only two hits over 6 1/3 innings as
Villa Park stunned Crescenta Valley in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   In the quarterfinals, Trumbo broke a 5-5 tie with a two-run home
run and recorded a victory in relief against Irvine Woodbridge. He
pitched five-plus strong innings to pick up his third playoff win in
the 5-3 semifinal victory over Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't express my feelings for that guy right now," McConchie
said of Trumbo. "Stepping up as a sophomore and getting three wins is
amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Trumbo's bat may be even more impressive than his arm. He's
hitting .406 with team highs in home runs (seven) and RBIs (41). Ben
Hanna, a senior third baseman, is hitting a team-high .418 with five
home runs and 32 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Villa Park's sluggers will face their toughest challenge of the
postseason today when they go against third-seeded Canyon's
hard-throwing left-hander, Jake Coash (9-3), who pitched the final 3
2/3 innings of the Cowboys' semifinal victory over Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Villa Park Coach Tom Tereschuk hasn't decided whether to start
Thompson or Trumbo, but he can probably rest assured that he will get
a solid outing from either. Thompson makes it no secret of his
desire.</TE>
<TE>   "I want the ball," said Thompson, who shut down Westlake in Villa
Park's 8-5 victory in the first round. "I wouldn't want it in anyone
else's hands but mine with the game on the line."</TE>

<LD>Include will try to do something today in Boston that only four other
horses have done.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Robert Meyerhoff and trained by Bud Delp, the 5-year-old
son of Broad Brush is seeking to become a repeat winner in the
$500,000 Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs.</LD>
<LD>   If Include, who won the race by four lengths in 2001, is
successful again today, he will join a couple of heavy hitters on the
list. Cigar (1995-96) and Skip Away (1997-98) are two of the others
who won the race twice in a row.</LD>
<TE>   A winner of 10 of 17 lifetime, Include will be ridden by Jerry
Bailey, who was aboard for his victory last year, and they will break
from Post 7 in the field of nine.</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Gary Stevens will also be in Boston for the 11/8-mile,
Grade II race. His mount is Macho Uno, who has started only five
times since he beat Point Given by a nose in the 2000 Breeders' Cup
Juvenile.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Joe Orseno for owner Frank Stronach, the 4-year-old son
of Holy Bull has won two of those races, including his most recent
outing. He beat an allowance field as the 7-10 favorite at Gulfstream
Park on March 23.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the likely participants in the Massachusetts
Handicap, which will be run about 2:40 locally and will be one of the
simulcasts at Hollywood Park, are Soes Bandit, Griffinite, Evening
Attire, Compelling World, Mongoose, John Little and Special Terms.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Spirit O'War, a fast-working son of Boston Harbor
purchased for $600,000, and Dr. Litin, a $2.5-million purchase and a
son of 1988 Kentucky Derby winner Winning Colors, will debut in
today's seventh at Hollywood Park. The race is seven furlongs and is
the second leg of the pick four.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Donna Elordi. The trainer has won with five of 11
starters at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Gary Sciacca. The New York trainer has won with only
six of 127 starters in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using No Night, Scoring Slew,
Martiniquais and Albatros in the sixth, Spirit O'War, Rock Cod
Johnny, Dr. Litin and Gravitate in the seventh, Johar and True
Phenomenon in the eighth and singling Virginia Miss in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Thursday): Previous day/meet total: 2/71. Money:
Previous day/meet total: $7/$411.80. Total money bet: $466.</TE>

<HD>Former Crescenta Valley Star Jenkins Is Found Dead</HD>

<LD>James Jenkins, a former basketball and swimming standout at Crescenta
Valley High, was found dead Thursday at the bottom of a waterfall
near Mammoth Lakes, the victim of an apparent accident, investigators
said.</LD>
<LD>   Jenkins, 19, was on a hiking and fishing trip when he was reported
missing Wednesday night by his father, Horace. After an all-night
search, a team of rescuers found Jenkins' body at the bottom of Rush
Creek Falls, a 200-foot waterfall near Agnew Lake.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of death is under investigation by the Mono County
coroner's office.</LD>
<TE>   News of Jenkins' death stunned students and faculty at Crescenta
Valley. He graduated in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has been deeply impacted," said Linda Evans,
co-principal at Crescenta Valley. "There's just a sense of real
emptiness and numbness."</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-7 Jenkins, who played on San Jose State's basketball
team last season as a freshman walk-on, averaged 23.2 points and 11.6
rebounds for Crescenta Valley as a senior, leading the Falcons to the
Southern Section playoffs. A three-year starter, Jenkins was twice
selected All-Southern Section.</TE>
<TE>   But his greatest success came in swimming. Jenkins won Division II
championships in the 50- and 100-yard freestyle events for the second
consecutive year in 2001, setting school records with times of 20.47
and 44.65 seconds, respectively. He was named The Times'
Valley/Ventura County swimmer of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Evans said students at Crescenta Valley erected a banner Friday,
"so kids can write their thoughts about James."</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services have been tentatively scheduled for next Saturday
at the Crescenta Valley auditorium. In lieu of flowers, the family
requests that donations be made to a memorial fund at the high
school.</TE>

<HD>Limelight Is Not for Adelman</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phil Jackson coached the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships and
the Lakers to two. He's renowned as the "Zen-master," a man who seems
to epitomize cool in a city where style is often confused for
substance.</LD>
<LD>   Rick Adelman coached the Portland Trail Blazers to the finals
twice in the early 1990s, losing both times, including once to
Jackson's Bulls.</LD>
<LD>   Adelman's image is somewhat more difficult to define than
Jackson's, if for no other reason than he doesn't appear to have one.</LD>
<TE>   One reason could be that Adelman shuns the limelight.</TE>
<TE>   "I respect all my coaches in different ways," Vlade Divac said of
playing for Adelman, who has the Kings within a victory of their
first finals appearance since 1951, when the franchise was based in
Rochester, N.Y., and known as the Royals.</TE>
<TE>   "Rick is No. 1 on my list. I'd love to play for him any time. He's
a winner. He's someone that you trust and believe in. I can't
describe it."</TE>
<TE>   Divac also said Adelman doesn't seem to care to know the opinion
of his coaching or of his teams from outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   "For his players, yeah, he cares what they say," Divac said. "For
everyone else, no. I don't think he cares. He's our hero."</TE>
<TE>   Backup center Scot Pollard said of Adelman, "He's a players'
coach. I like playing for him a lot, I really do. I think he pays
attention [to the opinion of others]. I know he doesn't read the
papers. But he values what we think of him more."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adelman was cagey with reporters when asked whether he would start
Peja Stojakovic, an All-Star with a bum ankle, for the first time in
this series. Stojakovic sprained his right ankle May 9 and played for
the first time against the Lakers in Game 5 on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be five guys out there," Adelman promised.</TE>
<TE>   When the game began, the Kings' starting five was the same as it
has been since Game 1--Hedo Turkoglu and Chris Webber at the forward
positions, Mike Bibby and Doug Christie at the guard spots and Divac
at center. Stojakovic, as he did in Game 5, filled a reserve role.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, even after their Game 6 loss, are 5-2 away from the din
of Arco Arena, where their home-court advantage was expected to carry
them at least as far as the Western Conference finals. The Kings are
5-3 at home in the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   Asked for a reason behind the Kings' road success, Adelman said,
"We're a more consistent team than in the past. We never get
ourselves out of a game. We're always right there. We're good when
the game's close."</TE>

<HD>Is Auerbach Blowing Smoke?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown and Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Red Auerbach has made a second career of minimizing Phil Jackson's
coaching achievements, his criticism becoming more vocal the closer
Jackson gets to another title.</LD>
<LD>   Auerbach won nine NBA championships as coach of the Boston Celtics
from 1957 to 1966. Jackson has eight, which annoys Auerbach to no
end.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson shrugged on Friday when told of yet another volley from
Auerbach, and said he would get satisfaction from catching and
passing Auerbach for the thrill it would give his mentor, Red
Holzman.</LD>
<TE>   "Well, I know Red [Auerbach]," Jackson said. "If you know Red, you
know why I'm looking forward to besting his record. I'm doing it in
lieu of Red Holzman's death. I'm sure it's a wish he'd have to see me
replace [Auerbach]."</TE>
<TE>   Auerbach's contention is Jackson chased the talent--Michael Jordan
and Scottie Pippen in Chicago, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in
Los Angeles--whereas Auerbach built and maintained the Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an eight-team league back then," Jackson said. "It was
pretty obvious it was a different game entirely."</TE>
<TE>   That being said, Jackson added that Auerbach did "a terrific job
as a coach," but that his postgame celebrations irked anyone outside
of Boston, Holzman among them.</TE>
<TE>   "Lighting a cigar at the ends of games and blowing smoke at the
ends of games, he irritated a lot of people," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   He stopped and chuckled. "And still is capable of doing that," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackson finally said what much of Los Angeles had been thinking
this week.</TE>
<TE>   It was about that play at the end of Game 5, Chris Webber either
losing the ball out of bounds, or watching as it was knocked out of
bounds by Robert Horry.</TE>
<TE>   It became a critical play when the ball was given to the Kings,
because Mike Bibby made a jump shot on the inbounds play to give the
Kings the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Replays of the loose ball were inconclusive. Yet on Friday,
Jackson said clearly that Webber had knocked it out of bounds and
that the officials had missed the call.</TE>
<TE>   "The judgment of Jack Nies to give the ball back to Sacramento
when Webber knocked it out of bounds, that's his call ... there's no
use [complaining], you have to accept that, rise above that," Jackson
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The road team has won 13 Game 7s in NBA history. The last were the
New York Knicks at Miami in the 2000 Eastern Conference
semifinals.... Tickets to watch Game 7 Sunday on the scoreboard at
Staples Center will go on sale at 10 a.m. today at the arena and at
Ticketmaster outlets.</TE>

<HD>Staying Power</HD>
<DH>O'Neal (41 points) and Bryant (31) pull L.A. past Kings and
into Game 7</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Game 7 ... is necessary.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant made it so.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers, down a game and facing elimination along with the end
of their three-peat desires, defeated the Sacramento Kings, 106-102,
Friday night at Staples Center, forcing one last game in the Western
Conference finals. It will be played at Arco Arena on Sunday
afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   "The pressure's on them," O'Neal said. "We play well in their
building."</TE>
<TE>   The winner will advance to the NBA Finals, where it will play the
New Jersey Nets, who eliminated the Boston Celtics on Friday night in
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored 41 points and took 17 rebounds. He shot 17 free
throws, and made 13. Bryant scored 31 points. He shot 11 free throws,
seven of them in the fourth quarter, and made them all.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Come to me,'" Robert Horry said of O'Neal. "He has not
said that in a long time. He said, 'I am going to do the little
things.' We like it better when he says 'Come to me.'</TE>
<TE>   "He looked like the old Shaq of last year. He was doing
everything."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers scored 16 of their final 18 points from the free-throw
line, all in the final quarter, when, in a series where the
officiating has swung capriciously from one team to the other, the
Lakers shot 27 free throws. They shot 40 overall.</TE>
<TE>   On the critical late possession for the Kings, Mike Bibby missed a
three-point shot inside five seconds remaining. This time there was
no confusion. Bryant defended him at the top, and Horry took the
rebound, and the Lakers danced into a Game 7, their 16th since moving
to Los Angeles four decades ago. They've won nine of them, the last
two years ago against the Portland Trail Blazers in the conference
finals.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers held a 101-100 lead with 19.8 seconds left. Bryant made
two free throws. Hedo Turkoglu made a layup to bring the Kings to
within 103-102, and Bryant made two more free throws, with 11.8
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Bibby missed. He dribbled up the left side of the
floor, turned right and found himself 25 feet from the basket. Rather
than Derek Fisher, Bryant stood before him, and Bibby was wide left
with the three-point attempt. Horry made the final free throw to give
the Lakers their four-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that bothered us, everybody was counting us out,"
Bryant said. "We'll go to Sacramento and see what's what. It's going
to be a fun game.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the champs and they're going to have to take it from us."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, O'Neal said Bryant had called him very early Friday
morning.</TE>
<TE>   "Big fella," Bryant told him, "need you tomorrow. We'll make
history."</TE>
<TE>   It was 2:30 a.m. O'Neal's infant daughter stirred beside him.</TE>
<TE>   "I woke his big behind up," Bryant said, laughing. "I knew he
wasn't asleep. He doesn't go to sleep until 5 in the morning. I can't
get the game off my mind. Since he's the other captain, I wanted to
make sure he couldn't get the game off his mind either. Just wanted
him to think about it.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been through so much together since we came here ... this
is nothing. Facing elimination, this is nothing for us. He felt the
same way I did."</TE>
<TE>   They combined for 72 points and 45 shots, and scored 23 of the
Lakers' 31 fourth-quarter points, when the Kings scored 27. As usual,
the Kings were more balanced, with six players in double figures.
Chris Webber scored 26 points and Bibby scored 23, but Bibby was
seven for 20 from the floor. The Kings shot 25 free throws, 15 fewer
than the Lakers, so there was the usual griping, which O'Neal would
hear none of.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to foul me to stop me," O'Neal said. "Period."</TE>
<TE>   He had 21 points at halftime and by early in the fourth quarter
had made his first 10 free-throw attempts.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers got some calls. "A shame," King Coach Rick Adelman
called it.</TE>
<TE>   Scot Pollard fouled out in 11 minutes. Divac fouled out with 2:56
remaining. In Game 5 in Sacramento, they had three fouls between
them, in 48 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle of the fourth quarter, O'Neal was defended on some
possessions by Webber, on others by Lawrence Funderburke. By late in
the quarter, with Webber also in foul trouble, there was only
Funderburke, and O'Neal attacked with jump hooks and turnarounds.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Divac nor Pollard had better luck. On an arthritic toe
that has slowed him for most of the season, O'Neal has regained
significant parts of his game lately. In Game 6, he spun to the
baseline like a healthy O'Neal, and he had enough in his legs to
twice take rebounds and push the ball up the floor.</TE>
<TE>   It became O'Neal's most dominant postseason game since last
season's conference semifinals, when he twice beat the Kings with
games of 40-plus points and 20 or more rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We played hard," O'Neal said. "We played with emotion."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have held the title for nearly two years, through two
seasons and 10 consecutive playoff series, through Sacramento and San
Antonio twice and Portland three times, through Indiana and
Philadelphia, among others.</TE>
<TE>   In that time, in those series, particularly the last seven or
eight, the Kings are the first to play as though they do not fear the
Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers hung two banners and forged untold numbers of
championship rings, and now the next comes down to one game.</TE>

<HD>Divac Pins Blame on Refs</HD>
<DH>Game 6: Center fumes after fouling out. Lakers attempt 27
free throws in fourth quarter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vlade Divac has an innovative idea for the Western Conference finals
in the future, one guaranteed to cut down on travel expenses.</LD>
<LD>   "Why don't they just let us know in advance?" he said, obviously
referring to the officials. "We come here. We go back to Sacramento.
Back here. Just let us know."</LD>
<LD>   Translation: The officials have already decided before the opening
tipoff who is going to win, so why bother to travel? Why bother to
play the game?</LD>
<TE>   The NBA would certainly vehemently dispute the notion that the
refs consciously favor the home team. But of this there can be no
dispute: The home team in this series between the Lakers and
Sacramento Kings has had a huge edge over the visiting team in time
spent at the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   And so it was again Friday night in Game 6. The Lakers had 40
free-throw attempts, the Kings 25. In the crucial fourth quarter, the
edge was 27-9 for the Lakers. Divac fouled out with just under three
minutes to play. Divac and Scot Pollard, given the task of trying to
stop Laker center Shaquille O'Neal, both fouled out.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen of the last 18 Laker points came at the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   In Game 5 at Sacramento's Arco Arena, the Kings had the edge in
free-throw attempts, 33-23. Between them, Divac and Pollard had three
fouls. And O'Neal fouled out.</TE>
<TE>   End of discussion, as far as Divac was concerned.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't want to talk about guarding O'Neal. He didn't want to
talk about making adjustments for Game 7. He sat at his locker stall,
arms folded and let the steam slowly come out of his ears. The only
adjustment he wants is in the minds of the officials.</TE>
<TE>   Pollard, presumably harboring the same feelings, disappeared
before reporters could surround him.</TE>
<TE>   Taking advantage of the calls against his defenders, O'Neal made
13 of 17 free-throw attempts, including his first 10.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it before the game," Divac said of the outcome. "It was my
turn."</TE>
<TE>   When the Kings were whistled for a three-second violation two
minutes into the game, Divac said, it confirmed his worst fears.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what is happening," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Did he mean the officials wanted him to foul out?</TE>
<TE>   "Oh no," he said, sarcasm dripping from him along with the sweat.
"I just felt like being aggressive and fouling people."</TE>
<TE>   Divac said he was most bitter about his sixth foul, when he
grabbed Robert Horry, who was already on the floor, while fighting
for the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "I dive for the ball and they call that," Divac said. "Be
consistent."</TE>
<TE>   Did Divac protest the call?</TE>
<TE>   "I said something about the first, the second, the third and the
fourth," he said. "By the fifth, I quit. After the sixth, I just went
to the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Oh yeah, and he wasn't too crazy about Kobe Bryant's hit on Mike
Bibby's nose which did not result in a foul call.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess Mike likes to hit himself in the nose," Divac said.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento forward Chris Webber was also angry about the
officiating, but he said talking to reporters had calmed him down.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys are kind of like my psychiatrists," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento guard Bobby Jackson wasn't surprised Divac fouled out.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of had it in my head before the game," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And what would he have in his head for Game 7?</TE>
<TE>   "You can't have nothing in your head," Jackson said. "You've just
got to play the game."</TE>

<LD>By admitting that he took steroids, Ken Caminiti's name should be
erased from any and all records he established and any awards he won.</LD>
<LD>   As a fan, I do not want more home runs and more scoring. I want
athletes, not drug abusers. To condone any use of steroids for that
stupid reason would mean that we want the track stars to take them to
see them run faster and throw farther.</LD>
<LD>   With that in mind, if baseball doesn't take steps to start erasing
these marks from the records, why don't we start celebrating Ben
Johnson's record and leave him alone?</LD>

<HD>Hodges' Career Not Just Kahn Job</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I thank the L.A. Times and Roger Kahn for the commentary on Gil
Hodges [May 26]. I wonder why this argument wasn't made in 1983, the
last year Hodges was eligible on the Hall of Fame ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Once Orlando Cepeda and Tony Perez went in, Hodges should have
gotten an automatic pass (like Tom Lasorda). I have never been to
Cooperstown but would love to go see Hodges' plaque there.</LD>
<LD>   Raul Sanchez</LD>
<TE>   Whittier</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kahn is right on target in his position that Hodges should be
enshrined in baseball's Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately the Dodgers haven't helped the situation by failing
to retire Gil's No. 14. It is apparently Dodger policy to retire only
numbers for players who have been elected into the hall. As usual,
two wrongs don't make a right. Hodges gave his all as a Dodger and in
return the Dodgers give nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Fandel</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The article promoting Brooklyn first baseman Gil Hodges for the
Hall of Fame caused me to wonder what The Times and baseball have
against Maury Wills.</TE>
<TE>   Two men changed the way baseball is played: Babe Ruth, who turned
it into a power game reliant on home runs, and Maury Wills, who
returned the stolen base to the game after its virtual absence of 40
years. Wills not only broke Ty Cobb's stolen-base record of 96, which
had stood for 47 years, he was the catalyst for the Dodger pennants
of '59, '63, '65, and '66.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers of '49-'56 were so dominant that they would have won
without Hodges. Without Wills, the Dodgers of '59-'66 wouldn't have
won one pennant, much less four pennants and three World Series.</TE>
<TE>   If The Times wants to support a Dodger who has been unjustly
ignored by the Hall of Fame, it needn't champion a journeyman first
baseman from Brooklyn. It need look no further than Chavez Ravine and
Maury Wills.</TE>

<HD>Time for Lakers, NBA to Change Their Stripes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While replaying the highlights of the white-knuckle, nail-biting Game
5, a local sports anchor pointed out a sequence of possible fouls on
Kobe Bryant and the (clean) pick on Derek Fisher.</LD>
<LD>   I heard the same grumblings throughout the city. I seem to have
missed the complaints after Game 4--the extra three points at the end
of the half, after the buzzer, the points that cost the Kings the
game? Right or wrong, it's all a part of the home-court advantage.</LD>
<LD>   My problem is that we as Laker fans, for good reason, are being
branded as whining babies, much the way players are behaving on and
off the court.</LD>
<TE>   Win or lose, for once this season let's do it with the same class
and dignity as in the Magic era, the same class the Pistons painfully
lacked in the late '80s when they stole the trophy.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Honeycutt</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are a real class act. They haven't lost a game yet. The
referees have lost every game so far. Kobe is Michael Jordan--even
though he hasn't made over half his shots in any single game of the
first 13 playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   What goes clank, clank, mumble, mumble, whine, whine? The Lakers
during the game, during postgame interviews and in the paper the next
day.</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Boyle</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have been a Laker fan for more than 25 years, and I have never
seen a more poorly officiated playoff game than Game 5. If the
officials are going to control NBA playoff games as they did in that
one, I will not watch.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Odian</TE>
<TE>   Palm Desert</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So Bobby Jackson wants the world to believe that he did not foul
Kobe Bryant at the end of Game 5? Too bad Jackson wasn't around in
the early '70s--he would have made a great spokesman for the Nixon
administration.</TE>
<TE>   And one has to compliment David Stern on his new "it's no foul if
you pull on a player's jersey while they're shooting" rule. It's
bound to entice WWF fans into watching the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Johnston</TE>

the Vlade Vlop is pure ham.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Sitton</TE>
<TE>   Banning</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I think it's great that the NBA refs may use instant replay for
quarter-ending shots. What they really need to do, however, is figure
out what is and what is not a foul. Make a video, pass it out. I've
been watching the NBA for 35 years and have no idea.</TE>
<TE>   Game to game, play-to-play, player-to-player, they call or don't
call fouls as if they're tossing a coin.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Steinberg</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Let me officiate the playoffs and I could make the Clippers the
world champions.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Koepke</TE>
<TE>   West Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The fact is, win or lose, Phil Jackson has neither a history of
being a great game coach nor even a great teacher of the game. Style
over substance, whether it be of a Zen nature or otherwise, does not
a great coach make. This is not to say that Coach Jackson is
incompetent. Far from it. But chanting a mantra, whether that mantra
includes the triangle offense (Tex Winter) or Buddhist terminology
(karmic retribution), is simply no substitute for solid game coaching
and preparation.</TE>
<TE>   You're an interesting man, Phil, but personally, I'd prefer the
blandness of say John R. Wooden or even Red Holzman.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Lazarou</TE>
<TE>   Encino</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your headlines regarding the Lakers have had some interesting
turns in recent years, but none more interesting than this
postseason.</TE>
<TE>   After Game 1, you printed "Time to Start Planning the Parade."
After Game 2, it was "You Mean This is Going to be a Series?" What's
it going to be if the Lakers lose this series? I have a suggestion:
"Maybe We Arrogant Sportswriters Shouldn't Have Jumped to Conclusions
and Given the Kings Some Tasty Morsels to Pin Up on the Locker Room
Bulletin Board."</TE>
<TE>   Remember: The word processor is mightier than the three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Sosner</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Are there any milk cartons out there with Laker photos on them? It
is the epitome of arrogance to believe that NBA championships are
handed out for merely showing up at game time.</TE>

<HD>Meanwhile, Back at the New Stadium ...</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Here is how to finance a new NFL stadium in Los Angeles:</LD>
<LD>   1. Hire a couple of ex-Enron executives to manage the financing.</LD>
<LD>   2. Sell each of the seats in the proposed 64,000-seat for $10,000
each. This results in a fund of $640 million, about $200 million more
than is needed for construction.</LD>
<TE>   3. Seat owners (share holders) get dividends back on the
investment as seat tickets are sold to the public.</TE>
<TE>   4. By the time a Super Bowl is played in the new stadium, profits
will accrue.</TE>
<TE>   Note that this will probably only work in L.A. and Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   I also wish I had been the first to realize that L.A. people would
pay more for bottled water (a free item at the tap) than for
gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   Paul B. Homer</TE>
<TE>   Ridgecrest</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Diane Pucin's column [on Boston] last Saturday entitled, "Sports
Teams Are the Hub of This City," further exemplifies why the sports
fans of Los Angeles are not deserving of an NFL team. The city of Los
Angeles has consistently proven that it cannot and will not support
an NFL team to the extent that is necessary to justify its existence.
Can you imagine a group of die-hard fans without tickets, standing
and listening to an NFL game outside the Coliseum on a radio while
eating sausages and arguing about which play should be called?</TE>
<TE>   Having an NFL team is a privilege, not a right, and should be
dealt with as such. Our sports fan base has decided that it is
fashionable to show up late, and to leave early. This is our culture,
and should not be dismissed as something related to traffic.
Consequently, without having the passion that most current NFL cities
can boast about, we can look forward to blacked-out games, thanks to
a proven track record of consistent inability to fill a football
stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is, if the fans cannot fill the stadium, the investors
cannot fill their pockets. Hence, a recipe for disaster.</TE>

<LD>Is it just me, or did the NHL playoffs seemingly end a lot earlier
this season? In fact, immediately after the Kings were eliminated
from Stanley Cup consideration, The Times pulled all the writers from
the hockey beat and left us puck fans with nothing but scant
Associated Press paragraphs buried deep within the sports section.
Granted, you needed the extra space to bore us with the constant
soccer columns, but if the Lakers had lost in the first round of the
playoffs, would you honestly be treating the basketball fans as
poorly as you are your hockey readers?</LD>

<LD>There will be a lot of dogs in action tonight at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   This is no knock on the quality of the 11-race program, which
includes the $79,700 MBNA American California Challenge at 440 yards.</LD>
<LD>   Rather, it is a statement of fact. A total of 64 dachshunds will
compete in the popular Weiner Nationals, an annual event at Los
Alamitos that always brings out a larger-than-average crowd.</LD>
<TE>   There will be eight 50-yard trial heats for the dogs, the winner
of each trial advancing to the final, which will be run about 9.</TE>
<TE>   One of the dogs competing is Angel, owned by Julie Krone-Hovdey,
the retired hall of fame jockey who now does television work at
Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   In the MBNA Challenge, Dashing Knud will be looking for his third
consecutive win and 13th in 20 starts. The 4-year-old gelding won his
trial for tonight's race by 11/2 lengths. Among his nine opponents
are Chiarascuro, who won his trial heat in a quicker time than
Dashing Knud; Cool Charles and Schofield Kid.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Rock N Fastball. 2. The Done Thing. 3. Merrishino.
4. Kan Fly. 5. Meddlin In Money. 6. Raging Roman. 7. A S Demon. 8.
Miss Kipty Yawl. 9. Pure Red Hot. 10. Dashing Knud. 11. Seeks Joy.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Rock N Fastball and Im A Pritzi Boy in the first, single
the entry of The Done Thing and Unknown Dame in the second, use
Merrishino, She Is Classic and Kims Dash in the third and Kan Fly, Be
Delightful and B. Fabulous in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Factorability gets a positive post change in
the sixth. Fashion Maven is a debuting Corona Cartel filly in the
ninth for trainer R C Howell.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Go Back to Shaq Attack</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>RICK MAJERUS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Big Aristotle finally met the few honest men for whom Diogenes
searched. Call them Laker teammates, who finally came to grips with
the fact that they had to go inside, inside and inside some more for
Los Angeles to win this game, or most other games for that matter.</LD>
<LD>   Phil Jackson, quite the philosopher himself, may have even gone so
far as to help demonstrate the need by using Brian Shaw so much. Shaw
may have the best sense of himself, of who he is and what his role
is, on the Laker team, because, on almost every occasion, he got the
ball into Aristotle O'Neal, making everybody at Staples Friday night
Shaq happy.</LD>
<LD>   It should be so simple. It seems so easy. Here is the greatest
force ever to play the game. Pass the ball to him.</LD>
<TE>   For Sacramento's sake, Shaq caught the ball too deep, too well and
too often. He caught it early in the transition and even late as the
ball swung to the second side of the floor. And if all that didn't
work, he went and got it off the glass.</TE>
<TE>   But the real stunner was that he conducted a clinic at the
free-throw line--would you believe 13 for 17--making him perhaps the
worst mechanical free throw shooter in the history of the game to
achieve that sort of percentage.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine what Rick Adelman and his Kings must be thinking: Good
Lord, all this and free-throw shooting too?</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento's worries have to be enormous now, and that's not to
take anything away from this gutty, talented team. But if form
follows function, as architect Frank Lloyd Wright was fond of saying,
then the Kings must pray that Shaq isn't building any houses Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, with Game 7 in Sacramento, the Kings can take great
heart in their prospects. But so can the Lakers, especially in the
category of Sacramento's Chris Webber, who played his best game of
the series and still couldn't get his team the win.</TE>
<TE>   Let's talk about the referees, which I hate doing, but which will
certainly be a huge topic of conversation after this one, especially
in the northern part of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Every game has been decided by who shoots and converts the most
free throws. Friday, the Lakers were 34 for 40 from the line, the
Kings 18 for 25.</TE>
<TE>   So, does that mean the officials are playing favorites, or that
there is some sort of league conspiracy to get this one to a seventh
game, or to get the Lakers into the Finals for bigger TV audiences or
whatever?</TE>
<TE>   First of all, swallow and digest one axiom, a basketball forever.
This game is impossible to officiate. Now, it is down to whose ox
will be gored.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, there were phantom fouls, mystery calls. Always are.</TE>
<TE>   One play that will be hotly discussed is Kobe Bryant running over
Mike Bibby at the end of the game. Well, you could make a case for
that call both ways. Kobe clearly ran over him, but Bibby also hooked
his arm around Bryant before that. So, what you had was probably a
good no-call.</TE>
<TE>   This is a fact of life. The referees won't acknowledge it, may not
even know it outwardly. But there is a pecking order in the game. The
stars get treated better. The same shot the Shaq puts up, Scot
Pollard and Samaki Walker have to put up in a very definitive way, or
they won't get the same call. For the officials, it's not overt, but
probably subliminal.</TE>
<TE>   It's reality, fans, like it or not. And it isn't just in
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   If Jack Nicholson is speeding down the road and gets stopped, he
is Jack Nicholson and he has a real good chance to not get a ticket.
If you are Laker Boy and you are pulled over, you've got yourself a
ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Deal with it Laker fans, because here comes Game 7, in somebody
else's arena.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Majerus, Utah basketball coach, will be The Times' guest
analyst on the Lakers for the rest of the playoffs. Majerus, the
fourth-winningest active coach in major college basketball, will
begin his 14th season at Utah this fall.</TE>

<HD>Aguirre Keeping Plans Under Wraps</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NIIGATA, Japan</DL>
<LD>With a couple of lineup spots unsettled and an international media
corps to deal with, Mexico Coach Javier Aguirre ran a final closed
practice session at the team's training base in Fukui before the
squad flew here Saturday to play its World Cup opener against Croatia
on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   With midfielders Jesus Arellano and Joahan Rodriguez suspended for
the Croatia game, Aguirre was mum as to who might replace them,
telling reporters he wouldn't reveal his lineup until game day.</LD>
<LD>   Gabriel Caballero, who has played well in Mexico's recent warmup
matches, appears set as Arellano's replacement. Less clear is who
fills in for Rodriguez at right defensive midfielder. Salvador
Carmona, who played the position in exhibitions against Bolivia and
AC Milan in mid-May, is a possibility, although there is speculation
Aguirre might move Carmona to the back line, starting him in place of
left back Melvin Brown. Another option is Alberto Rodriguez.</LD>
<TE>   Croatia, meanwhile, has taken a more public approach to its lineup
juggling. Defender Dario Simic, given a Friday deadline to show his
strained calf muscle would be ready by Monday, pleaded for more time
after a light training session Friday.</TE>
<TE>   If Simic, who has played 48 times for his country, is held out
Monday, his likely replacement is Josip Simunic.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Croatia striker Davor Suker, 34 and no longer assured of a
starting place in the lineup, is talking wishfully about becoming the
first player to lead consecutive World Cups in scoring.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to play and I want to be the best goal scorer again," said
Suker, who led all players with six goals in 1998 as Croatia advanced
to the semifinals. "No one has ever done it and it would make me very
proud if I could do it.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can get one or two goals in the first match, then anything
is possible."</TE>

<KH>MINOR LEAGUE REPORT</KH>
<HD>Prospects for Torres Heat Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shortly after the Angels had made him their top pick in the 2000
amateur draft, Joe Torres proclaimed his desire to make the big
league roster within three years.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly two years later, the 19-year-old left-hander is pitching
for Class-A Cedar Rapids, where he is finally starting to show
significant progress during what he hopes will be his first full
minor league season.</LD>
<LD>   "I give myself a B grade overall," said Torres, who was 4-1 with a
2.28 earned-run average before Friday. "I feel like I have a lot to
work on before I can progress in the system."</LD>
<TE>   Torres' debut season was solid enough. He went 4-1 with a 2.54 ERA
in 2000 with the Angels' rookie-league club in Boise, Idaho, raising
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   But he was a different pitcher in spring training the next year.
His velocity dropped sharply and team officials, suspecting a
shoulder injury, put Torres through a series of tests.</TE>
<TE>   No injury was revealed.</TE>
<TE>   "My arm felt fine," Torres said. "I thought it was just mechanical
flaws."</TE>
<TE>   Torres spent the season bouncing between Cedar Rapids and Provo
after two stints in extended spring training. He pitched 48 1/3
innings, compiling a 5.82 ERA in Cedar Rapids and 4.02 in Provo. Not
exactly what the Angels had expected after drafting Torres 10th
overall.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-3, 185-pounder has returned to form this season, thanks
to a renewed focus, improved mechanics ... and frigid weather. He
credited 20-degree temperatures and snow showers with helping him in
the early going.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough for hitters in the cold weather," said Torres, who
went 3-1 with an 0.44 ERA in April.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Reagins, the Angels' director of player development, said
Torres deserves the praise.</TE>
<TE>   "He is regaining the form he had in high school," Reagins said.
"Our pitching people have been working with him from a mechanical
standpoint because he hasn't been pitching the way he had when he was
drafted."</TE>
<TE>   In other Angel system news:</TE>
<TE>   * First baseman Casey Kotchman, the top prospect after having been
selected 13th overall in last June's amateur draft, has hit .385 in
the last 15 games for Cedar Rapids, raising his average from .220 to
.273 heading into the weekend. Still, Kotchman has been overshadowed
by teammate Jeff Mathis, the 33rd pick, who leads the Midwest League
in doubles with 22 and hits with 69. Mathis, a catcher, is hitting
.333, though he is in a seven-for-30 slump.</TE>
<TE>   * Rancho Cucamonga third baseman Carlos Duncan drove in seven runs
for the second time this season after hitting a career-high three
home runs in a 15-13 loss to Lake Elsinore on May 24.</TE>
<TE>   * Salt Lake right-hander Mickey Callaway missed tying the
franchise record of eight consecutive wins with a no-decision May 18
against Memphis. Shortly thereafter, Callaway, who is 7-0 with a
minor league-best 1.37 ERA, was put on the disabled list with a sore
back.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger system</TE>
<TE>   It has been a whirlwind first few months on the job for Gerry
McKearney, general manager of the Class-A South Georgia Waves. Only
three weeks before the start of the season, a new ownership group,
Mandalay Sports, uprooted the club from its longtime home in
Wilmington, N.C., and plunked it down in Albany, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   McKearney remembers showing up for work the first day and seeing a
moving van and workmen unloading the club's old office equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been working around the clock to get things going," said
McKearney, who previously worked as general manager of the
rookie-level Provo Angels. "I'm pleased with what we put together."</TE>
<TE>   McKearney said his small staff would now turn its attention toward
marketing the club in what is considered a more desirable baseball
market. Restrictions on scheduling and beer sales at the club's old
stadium at UNC Wilmington also prompted the move, McKearney said.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves (30-23), averaging about 1,000 fans a game, are in a
three-way tie for first place in the Southern Division of the South
Atlantic League.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, South Georgia right-hander Francisco Cruceta looked
like the second coming of Pedro Martinez. The Dominican Republic
native was 4-1 with a 1.16 ERA that ranked third among all minor
leaguers. Cruceta has since dropped two of three decisions but
maintains a respectable 3.04 ERA with 56 strikeouts in 53 1/3
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Ricardo Rodriguez, a right-hander for double-A Jacksonville, has
allowed no runs and six hits in 17 1/3 innings since returning from
biceps tendinitis, which caused him to miss the first six weeks of
the season. Rodriguez was named Southern League pitcher of the week
after combining with two relievers on a two-hit shutout Wednesday as
the Suns defeated Birmingham, 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   California League</TE>
<TE>   Stockton's six starting pitchers are a combined 18-2 with a 2.74
ERA in 27 games this month. Left-hander John Koronka raised his
record to a minor league-best 10-0 Thursday by pitching seven innings
in a 10-3 win over Visalia.</TE>

<HD>Kidd's Numbers Don't Lie as Nets Finish Off Celtics</HD>
<DH>Eastern Conference: His third triple-double of series lifts
New Jersey past Boston, 96-88, and into NBA Finals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>This was about Jason Kidd.</LD>
<LD>   The numbers, first. The 15 points, the 13 assists, the 13
rebounds, the triple-double, his third of the series.</LD>
<LD>   It was about his two-handed, over-the-shoulder, on-the-run, blind
pass to Lucious Harris that ended in a layup. And right after, his
thread-the-needle, through-three-Celtics, pinpoint pass to Aaron
Williams that ended in a layup plus a foul shot for Williams. These
came back-to-back in the fourth quarter, when the game mattered most,
when every palm was sweaty and every heart was pounding.</LD>
<TE>   And it was about his defense, the way Kidd attached himself to
Antoine Walker. Walker didn't score in the fourth quarter. Walker
could hardly get his hands on the ball unless he was off-balance and
looking the wrong way.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all it was about his face. No matter what the Boston crowd
shouted at him, "wife beater" being the most friendly, no matter what
was thrown from the crowd--full cups of beer, paper airplanes,
coins--no matter whether his team was losing by 10 or on a full
gallop into the lead, Kidd never showed an ounce of emotion.</TE>
<TE>   He just played.</TE>
<TE>   He played the New Jersey Nets into the NBA Finals for the first
time in team history. He played the Nets from a 10-point halftime
deficit to an emphatic 96-88 win over the Boston Celtics at the
FleetCenter Friday night. He played the Nets to a 4-2 conquering of
the Eastern Conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   He caused Celtic Coach Jim O'Brien to say, "Jason Kidd is off the
charts as a player. He is as good a point guard as I've ever seen.
His ability to get triple-doubles on a regular basis is something to
behold."</TE>
<TE>   And he caused O'Brien to say something even more stunning:</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Nets will win the finals. Why? Because they have as
good a point guard as I've ever seen, a tremendous bench, great
starters. They're big. They're a difficult team to prepare for. I
think when you have an MVP candidate like Jason Kidd, where he
controls the backboard, controls the basketball, he's a great
defensive player, I think the West is in for a rude awakening."</TE>
<TE>   Kidd became the first player in 35 years to have three
triple-doubles in one series. He joined the company of Oscar
Robertson (1963) and Wilt Chamberlain (1967).</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little light-headed," Kidd said. "It's just unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Kidd was on the foul line, blowing a soft air kiss as he always
does before shooting a free throw, a symbol of solidarity with his
wife, Joumana, when the game had to be stopped because a fan threw a
full cup of beer onto the court. There were 33.9 seconds left and the
Celtics were finished. Kidd never moved from the foul line. He just
waited for the cleanup and then made two free throws, the final
points of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Since an incident 18 months ago when Joumana called police and
said Jason hit her, Joumana and the couple's 3-year-old son, T.J.,
have been a public part of Kidd's basketball life. They missed their
first playoff game Friday after they had been sworn at and taunted.</TE>
<TE>   But there were other things to notice besides Kidd, his
performance and his family.</TE>
<TE>   Such as the way Boston stars Walker (16 points on seven-for-20
shooting) and Paul Pierce (14 points on five-for-16 shooting) backed
away from the fourth quarter. Pierce made one three-pointer, with
11:10 left. That was the only basket either of Boston's go-to guys
made.</TE>
<TE>   Such as the way the Nets weren't bothered at all by the
full-throated roar of the crowd as the Celtics closed out the first
quarter with a 25-7 run for a 28-21 lead, and ran off an 11-2 finish
of the second quarter to lead, 54-44.</TE>
<TE>   Such as the way, with 49.2 seconds left and the shot clock nearing
zero, Kerry Kittles, surrounded under the basket, whipped the ball to
Keith Van Horn, who stood flat-footed and calm as he made a
three-pointer to double the Nets' lead from 91-88 to 94-88.</TE>
<TE>   And such as the way the celebration consisted of Kenyon Martin
taking off his shirt. That was it. Otherwise the Nets walked quietly
off the court. As if they expected this. And more.</TE>

<HD>Norman's 65 Puts Him in Lead at Kemper Open</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once Greg Norman got started, the rest was easy.</LD>
<LD>   The 47-year-old Australian, coming off a five-week layoff in which
he didn't even practice, shot a bogey-free six-under-par 65 Friday to
take a two-stroke lead at the midpoint of the Kemper Insurance Open
at Potomac, Md.</LD>
<LD>   "The hardest part about getting motivated is getting yourself
there," said Norman, who is winless on the PGA Tour since 1997 and
played so few events last year that he lost his membership.</LD>
<TE>   "Sometimes as of late the hardest part is getting to the starting
gate. Once you get to the starting gate, everything else is natural,
and that's the way I've felt the last couple of days."</TE>
<TE>   Norman, whose enthusiasm for his golf career now shares equal
billing with his many business interests, is trying to become the
oldest player to win a PGA Tour event since Tom Watson took the
Colonial three years ago at age 48.</TE>
<TE>   Norman certainly had a spring in his step Friday, nearly sprinting
at one point while sharing a smile with the scorekeeper after a great
tee shot at No. 17. He birdied the hole, his second in a row, to keep
the momentum from his first-round 67 to move to 10-under 132.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel 47, to tell you the truth," said Norman, who cycles
regularly and works out daily. "I probably feel better than I did
when I was 35. I may have a few more aches and pains, yes, but I
think when I was 35 I had those aches and pains, and you just didn't
pay attention to them."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Estes was 11 under after an eagle at No. 13, but lost three
strokes on Nos. 16 and 17--the same holes Norman later birdied. Craig
Barlow and Willie Wood both reached nine under before falling back
one shot to tie Estes and Bob Burns at eight under.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With visions of another 59 dancing through her mind, Annika
Sorenstam settled for a 63 and the first-round lead in the inaugural
Kellogg-Keebler Classic at Aurora, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam, rested and ready to play again after taking last week
off, finished at nine under on the Stonebridge Country Club course,
one stroke better than Michele Redman.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle Ammaccapane and Jackie Gallagher-Smith were another
stroke back at 65, and Suzanne Strudwick and Carri Wood shot 66s.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Beth Bauer and veteran Jan Stephenson were in a group at
67.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam, seeking her fourth tour victory of the year, birdied
seven of the first eight holes and eight of the first 10.</TE>
<TE>   Motor Racing</TE>
<TE>   Ted Musgrave used lapped traffic to take the lead and hold off
Robert Pressley in a battle of former Winston Cup drivers to win the
NASCAR truck series race at Dover International Speedway in Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   The victory in the MBNA America 200 was the second of the season
for Musgrave and his ninth in Craftsman Truck Series competition.</TE>
<TE>   After polesitter Rick Crawford used a fast pit stop to take the
lead halfway through the race, Musgrave stalked him in a nose-to-tail
battle around The Monster Mile. Musgrave got by Crawford--as did
Travis Kvapil--as the trucks came up on lapped vehicles exiting the
fourth turn on the 123rd lap at the high-banked concrete oval.</TE>
<TE>   Musgrave, who had fallen out of the lead with a slow stop after
Matt Crafton hit the wall on the 97th of 200 laps, held on to win by
a half-second.</TE>
<TE>   College Sports</TE>
<TE>   Western Kentucky center Chris Marcus, a possible lottery pick in
next month's NBA draft, has decided to return to school for his last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I've decided to pull my name out of the 2002 NBA draft because of
my foot," Marcus said. "I am physically unable to perform up to my
capabilities right now."</TE>
<TE>   The 7-foot-1, 285-pound center averaged 16.4 points and 9.4
rebounds in the games he played but struggled to return to form after
missing two months because of an injured ankle and a stress fracture
in his left foot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Syracuse tailback Diamond Ferri is taking a one-year leave of
absence from school. Ferri, a sophomore, was Syracuse's No. 2
tailback last season, rushing 39 times for 155 yards. He was
projected to start this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Paul Pasqualoni declined to give specific reasons for
Ferri's departure, but said Thursday it was a combination of things,
including Ferri's school work, missed spring practices and his
commitment to the team.</TE>
<TE>   Boxing</TE>
<TE>   Evander Holyfield (37-5-2) takes on Hasim Rahman (35-2) tonight in
a heavyweight bout scheduled for 12 rounds in Atlantic City, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Holyfield, 39, is in a non-title fight for the first time since he
pulled one of the greatest upsets in boxing by beating Mike Tyson
more than five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Rahman is coming off a knockout loss to Lennox Lewis on Nov. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Rahman weighed in at 224 pounds. Holyfield was 216.</TE>

<LD>Jamal Anderson, once one of the NFL's best running backs, could get
his walking papers today.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson, 29, who led the Atlanta Falcons to the Super Bowl in
1998 by rushing for 1,846 yards and 14 touchdowns, has been hampered
by knee problems the last few years and is considered expendable.</LD>
<LD>   He heads the list of high-profile players likely to be released
today as teams try to trim their payrolls to make room for new
talent.</LD>
<TE>   If a player is cut after June 1, only a portion of his pro-rated
signing bonus counts against the next season's salary cap. That
leaves more money to sign players.</TE>
<TE>   Four once-elite receivers who could be looking for new teams are
Detroit's Herman Moore, Jacksonville's Keenan McCardell, Kansas
City's Derrick Alexander and Green Bay's Antonio Freeman.</TE>
<TE>   Other potential cuts include linebackers Hardy Nickerson
(Jacksonville), Mike Jones (Pittsburgh) and Andy Katzenmoyer (New
England); and defensive linemen Orpheus Roye (Cleveland), Junior
Bryant (San Francisco) and Marco Coleman (Washington).</TE>
<TE>   "There probably will be a little less activity [on the free-agent
market] this year," Oakland Raider executive Bruce Allen said.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's prospects with the Falcons grew dim this spring when
the team signed Tampa Bay running back Warrick Dunn to a six-year,
$28-million deal, then drafted Michigan State running back T.J.
Duckett with the 18th pick.</TE>
<TE>   The season after leading the Falcons to the Super Bowl, Anderson
was sidelined because of torn ligaments in his right knee. He
returned for the 2000 season and rushed for 1,024 yards and six
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   But he had more problems last fall, sitting out most of the season
because of torn ligaments in his left knee.</TE>
<TE>   Although Anderson agreed to take a pay cut to $2 million from $5
million this season, the Falcons have informed him he probably won't
be back. Regardless, Anderson wants to keep playing and his agent
believes he will not have trouble finding another team.</TE>

<HD>Red Wings Knock Roy, Avalanche Off Throne</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Detroit turns Game 7 of Western Conference finals
into a rout, beating defending champion Colorado, 7-0.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The Detroit Red Wings chased Patrick Roy and sent the Colorado
Avalanche packing.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit scored on its first two shots and knocked out the Colorado
goalie early in the second period as the Red Wings eliminated the
defending Stanley Cup champion Avalanche with a 7-0 victory Friday
night in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   "We thought it would be a 1-0 game, or go into overtime, or be a
2-0 game," Red Wing captain Steve Yzerman said. "We were still
thinking after the first period, 'This isn't the way it's supposed to
be.'"</LD>
<TE>   While Roy struggled, Dominik Hasek set an NHL record with his
fifth shutout in one postseason.</TE>
<TE>   Hasek didn't care that he set a record while helping the Red Wings
move a big step closer to the ultimate prize with the largest margin
of victory in an NHL Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't mean anything," said Hasek, who sought a trade to
Detroit to complete his resume with a Stanley Cup. "It's nice, but I
have other goals and they're not about shutouts in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings will open the Stanley Cup finals Tuesday night at
home against the Carolina Hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   Hasek finished strong with 19 saves for his second straight
shutout, while Roy allowed four goals in the first period for the
first time in his storied 240-game playoff career.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have time to feel bad for him," Hasek said. "That can
happen to any goalie."</TE>
<TE>   Hasek won his first Game 7 in three chances. Roy and the Avalanche
had won their last four Game 7s, including shutout victories over the
Kings and San Jose this season.</TE>
<TE>   In a dramatic series highlighted by three overtimes and
spectacular play by more than a dozen future Hall of Famers, the Red
Wings weren't interested in adding more drama to one of hockey's best
rivalries.</TE>
<TE>   Tomas Holmstrom scored the first of his two goals on Detroit's
first shot, 1:57 into the game. Then 80 seconds later, Sergei
Fedorov's fluttering shot from the left circle got past Roy.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through the first period, Luc Robitaille slipped a shot
through Roy's pads. Roy kicked the puck out of the net, skated to the
boards to his right, then sprayed water on his face during an ensuing
timeout as red-clad fans chanted "Pa-trick! Pa-trick!"</TE>
<TE>   It got even worse for Roy and the Avalanche at 12:51 of the first
when the Red Wings took a 4-0 lead on Holmstrom's goal off a rebound
of Robitaille's shot.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Hull put Detroit ahead 5-0 at 4:41 of the second period with
a wrist shot just over Roy's glove, then the Red Wings scored when
Fredrik Olausson connected at 6:28 of the second.</TE>
<TE>   After Roy let out a big sigh, Colorado Coach Bob Hartley replaced
him with David Aebischer for the first time this postseason.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't want to come out," Hartley said. "We all know Patrick,
how much of a competitor he is.... Especially after the season that
he gave us, I think that he had seen enough tonight, so it was time
to give him a break."</TE>
<TE>   Roy regretted that the Avalanche didn't eliminate Detroit when it
was ahead 3-2 in the series and at home for Game 6.</TE>
<TE>   "There's going to be a lot of times we're going to think about
that," Roy said.</TE>
<TE>   "Game 7s are tough to win on the road."</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche, along with the rest of the NHL, know that well.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado has lost its last four Game 7s on the road and the home
team has won eight of the last nine Game 7s in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado became the first NHL team to play in four consecutive
Game 7s, dating to last year when the Avalanche won the Stanley Cup,
and joined the 1993 Toronto Maple Leafs as the only teams to play in
three Game 7s in one postseason.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings played in their first Game 7 since beating St.
Louis, 1-0, in overtime of the 1996 Western Conference semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   These rivals, who have combined to win four of the last six
Stanley Cups, met for the fifth time in the postseason since 1996,
but played in a Game 7 for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   While the Red Wings appeared fresh, the Avalanche looked
understandably haggard because of its demanding postseason and short
bench.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no excuses," Colorado captain Joe Sakic said.</TE>

<HD>FIRST LOOK DETROIT VS. CAROLINA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OFFENSE</LD>
<LD>   Carolina--Patience is the key for the Hurricanes when they have
the puck because they love to cycle until a scoring chance arises.
Coach Paul Maurice relies on a line made up of veteran Martin Gelinas
with physical young forwards Josef Vasicek and Jaroslav Svoboda to
slow down the opposing team's top line. Once the line gets the puck,
it is difficult to take it away. Captain Ron Francis centers the
Hurricanes' top line with Jeff O'Neill and Sami Kapanen on the wings.
After struggling for most of the series against Toronto, Kapanen got
going in the last two games. Maybe the most important line for
Carolina is the 'BBC Line,' which is made up of Bates Battaglia, Rod
Brind'Amour and rookie Erik Cole.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit--Coach Scotty Bowman loves to juggle his lines, and he has
the luxury of working with such proven scorers as captain Steve
Yzerman, Sergei Fedorov, Brendan Shanahan, Luc Robitaille and Brett
Hull. But the forwards who sparked the Red Wings in their seven-game
victory over Colorado in the Western Conference finals were grinders
Darren McCarty and Tomas Holmstrom. Detroit did not get great
production from Robitaille, Shanahan and Hull against the Avalanche.
Although Detroit is known for veteran players headed for the Hall of
Fame, the Red Wings have received strong efforts from youngsters
Pavel Datsyuk and Boyd Devereaux in the playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   DEFENSE</TE>
<TE>   Carolina--Maurice has the Hurricanes playing a defense-first
style, featuring a neutral-zone trap to smother offense-minded
players. Against Toronto, the Hurricanes' blue liners dominated.
Veterans Aaron Ward, Glen Wesley, Sean Hill and Bret Hedican were
solid slowing down Gary Roberts and the rest of the Maple Leaf
forwards. Carolina defensemen do not commit ill-advised penalties and
they rarely make mistakes. The Hurricanes also are not afraid to
sacrifice their bodies; they blocked several shots in the Eastern
Conference finals. Another positive for Carolina has been the
offensive play of defenseman Niklas Wallin, who has two overtime
goals in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit--Veteran defenseman Chris Chelios and last season's Norris
Trophy winner, Nicklas Lidstrom, have played great in the playoffs.
Chelios is still as nasty as ever and Lidstrom's all-around skills
are difficult to miss at this time of the season. One surprise for
the Red Wings has been the play of Steve Duchesne, Jiri Fischer and
Fredrik Olausson, who have provided scoring and physical play around
the net.</TE>
<TE>   GOALTENDING</TE>
<TE>   Carolina--The Hurricanes would not have a six-game road winning
streak if not for the play of goalie Arturs Irbe. After starting the
Eastern Conference finals on the bench because Maurice replaced him
late in the second round with backup Kevin Weekes, Irbe outplayed
Toronto's Curtis Joseph.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit--Dominik Hasek proved that he can play under pressure
against the Avalanche, and now he has to show that he can win a
Stanley Cup.</TE>
<TE>   COACHING</TE>
<TE>   Carolina--Maurice reportedly was close to getting fired early in
the season when the Hurricanes were floundering. Since then,
Maurice's defensive system has caught on with his players and
Carolina has turned into one of the toughest teams in the league to
score on.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit--Bowman is the master of getting his team ready to play
when it counts, and the Red Wings proved that again with their Game 7
victory over Colorado on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   FINAL ANALYSIS</TE>
<TE>   Before the season began, the odds of Carolina winning the Stanley
Cup were 40-1. Nobody gave the Hurricanes a chance to win the Eastern
Conference title but they did it, defeating outstanding goaltenders
in three consecutive rounds (New Jersey's Martin Brodeur, Montreal's
Jose Theodore and Toronto's Joseph). Carolina's steady group of
defensemen and Irbe give the Hurricanes a chance against the Red
Wings, but they will need Kapanen and O'Neill to score. Detroit,
which won the Presidents' Trophy during the regular season, seems to
be a team on a mission. Most of the Red Wings have played on a
Stanley Cup championship team but Hasek and Robitaille have not.
Detroit in six.</TE>

<HD>Wilson, Fogg Pace Pirates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Extra batting practice paid off in a big way for Craig Wilson.</LD>
<LD>   Wilson went four for four--his first career four-hit game--with
two runs batted in, and rookie Josh Fogg pitched four-hit ball into
the seventh inning as the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the St. Louis
Cardinals, 3-1, Friday night at St. Louis.</LD>
<LD>   Wilson, who entered the game batting .234, spent some time with
hitting instructor Dave Clark and raised his average 31 points to
.265.</LD>
<TE>   "Clarkie told me to do a couple of things and they worked," Wilson
said. "Clarkie really worked his magic and it was on display."</TE>
<TE>   Fogg faced the Cardinals for the second consecutive outing and
fared a lot better in the rematch, allowing only J.D. Drew's eighth
home run leading off the seventh. Fogg (6-3) lasted just 4 1/3
innings last Sunday in Pittsburgh, giving up three homers in a 7-3
loss.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals have lost two straight for the first time since May
5-7, when they dropped three in a row. Despite the mini-slump,
they've won 16 of 21.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal center fielder Jim Edmonds left for a pinch-hitter in the
fourth with a sprained right wrist while sliding at the plate in the
second. He was listed as day-to-day.</TE>
<TE>   New York 6, Florida 5--Rey Ordonez tied a career high with four
RBIs, including his first homer of the season in the 10th inning to
help the Mets win at Miami. Ordonez also doubled home three runs in
the second inning. The light-hitting shortstop had only eight
extra-base hits coming into the game, all doubles. Teammate Roger
Cedeno hit his second home run. The Mets remained a half-game behind
NL East leader Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 12, San Diego 1--Geoff Jenkins hit his first career
grand slam and Ruben Quevedo pitched seven strong innings to lead the
Brewers at San Diego. Alex Sanchez matched his career best with four
of Milwaukee's season-high 19 hits. Jenkins' grand slam was the
second in two nights given up by the Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 4, Chicago 1--Richard Hidalgo hit two home runs and Carlos
Hernandez gave up three hits over seven innings as the Astros won at
Chicago. Sammy Sosa hit his major league-leading 19th homer for
Chicago in the eighth inning. Hidalgo opened the scoring in the
seventh with his ninth homer of the season then finished a four for
four performance with another two-run homer off Juan Cruz in the
ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 8, Philadelphia 7--Troy O'Leary homered and drove in four
runs and Fernando Tatis added a two-run homer to lead the Expos at
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 6, San Francisco 2--Rookie Jason Jennings retired his
first 16 batters and Todd Helton hit a three-run homer as the Rockies
won at San Francisco. Jennings (7-2) did not allow a hit until Barry
Bonds' single to right-center with one out in the seventh.</TE>

<HD>Smith Leaves Pepperdine to Become USC Tennis Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Lauren Peterson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Smith, the Pepperdine men's tennis coach for the last five
years, has been named to the same position at USC.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, 37, replaces Dick Leach, who retired as the Trojans' coach
last week after 23 seasons, his final one capped by the national
championship USC won 11 days ago.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a challenge," Smith said. "But it's momentum too. The ball
is rolling, with that incredible title. It should be a lot easier for
me to push a ball that's already rolling than if I was the one who
had to get it going."</LD>
<TE>   Smith, who compiled a 118-31 record in dual matches at Pepperdine,
also coached at Fresno State and Long Beach State, his alma mater. A
1987 graduate of Long Beach, he played No. 1 singles for the 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   Smith led the Waves to a 25-6 record and the quarterfinals of the
NCAA championships this year. Pepperdine qualified for the NCAA
tournament in all five seasons he was coach.</TE>
<TE>   His Pepperdine contract was due to expire in July, and the coach
said school officials there counter-offered in an effort to retain
him.</TE>
<TE>   He said the opportunity to coach at USC was too good to pass up.</TE>

<LD>The team of many colors unveiled yet another new wardrobe Friday
night, buttoning it to their necks and lacing it around their ankles
and tightening it up like armor.</LD>
<LD>   It was strange. It was unfashionable. It was terrific.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers wore desperate.</LD>
<TE>   Today, a drained and breathless Los Angeles celebrates a chance to
see them wear it again.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing it to a 106-102 victory in Game 6 of the Western
Conference finals, the look knocked the Sacramento Kings up the
interstate and extended this wondrous series to a seventh and final
game.</TE>
<TE>   That would be Sunday in Sacramento. The Lakers would be wise to
sleep in their clothes.</TE>
<TE>   These torn, sweat-soaked, throwback clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the champions," said Kobe Bryant after another edge-of-seat
evening at Staples Center. "They're going to have to take it from
us."</TE>
<TE>   For several hours in front of 18,997 screaming fans who have
turned Staples into a giant Arco without the cows, the Lakers were
champions indeed.</TE>
<TE>   And in the final moments, the Kings indeed could not take it from
them.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied at 92, Robert Horry jumped a pick that he did
not jump in Game 5, leading to Chris Webber's airball hook.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Hedo Turkoglu forced a shot against a Rick Fox
pursuit that we have not seen in days.</TE>
<TE>   Then Mike Bibby attempted a drive and was stopped by Bryant. Yes,
the same Bryant who was not guarding him in Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   By then, it was simply a matter of the Lakers taking advantage of
the sort of liberal officiating that made one wonder.</TE>
<TE>   Were the referees attempting to make up for a poorly called Game 5
with a worse job in Game 6?</TE>
<TE>   The Kings will talk forever about how the Lakers shot 27 free
throws in the fourth quarter, while the Kings shot nine.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers everywhere will wonder how basketball's two most exciting
teams could be ground to a halt by officials who were decidedly not
going to let the players play.</TE>
<TE>   But the Lakers will care about none of it.</TE>
<TE>   Going deep in this sixth, they have come up with a seventh, and
even though it is in the most difficult home court in the league, who
would bet against them?</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have won two deciding games in this three-year playoff
run.</TE>
<TE>   In one of them, they beat the Kings by 27 points.</TE>
<TE>   That was two years. But on Friday, the Lakers looked like two
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   With their reputations to the wall and their hearts back in a
corner, they came out like we have not seen them in several months.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq was Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal caught the ball deep, moved to the basket hard, even beat
his teammates down the court on defense while scoring 41 points.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, he even told an old-time cute Shaq story afterward
about being awakened at 2:30 a.m. Friday by Kobe Bryant, who
whispered sweet nothings into the phone about the need for Shaq's
domination.</TE>
<TE>   "I just told him, 'Let's go, we've been through so much together
these past few years, and this is nothing,'" Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe was also Kobe.</TE>
<TE>   He looked inside first. He played defense second. He took fewer
shots than Webber. After oddly struggling at the line earlier in the
playoffs, he made every stinking one of his 11 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a free shot, there's nobody guarding you," Bryant said with
some astonishment. "You should make them."</TE>
<TE>   There was more.</TE>
<TE>   Remember the Shaw-Shaq redemption in 2000?</TE>
<TE>   It came back, with Brian Shaw hustling around for three rebounds
and two assists and that old-time calm leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Remember Derek Fisher?</TE>
<TE>   Missing for this entire series until now, he finally showed up in
the second half, hounding Bibby and making a three-point basket and,
who knows, maybe he'll show up again on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   And remember how opponents used to be furious with the way the
Lakers were allowed to dominate?</TE>
<TE>   This was about the Lakers' good old days indeed, with the Kings
furious about several things that made the Lakers madder than heck
only a few days ago.</TE>
<TE>   They were upset about Vlade Divac fouling out on a ticky-tack
loose ball call with 2:56 remaining with the score tied.</TE>
<TE>   It was just like O'Neal fouled out in Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   They were perplexed about Bibby not drawing a charging foul
against Bryant on an in-bounds play in the final moments even though
Bryant bloodied his nose.</TE>
<TE>   Just like the Lakers were mad about Bobby Jackson not being called
for a foul after pulling out Bryant's shirt in Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel sorry for our team," King Coach Rick Adelman said. "They
did everything they could to win the game. They did. It's just a real
shame."</TE>
<TE>   Somebody mentioned that the Lakers shot 27 free throws in the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "They sure did," Adelman said quickly. "Obviously they got the
game called the way they wanted to get it called."</TE>
<TE>   But then he paused, and added, "We're not going away Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   Who is? Who would? Who can?</TE>

<HD>King Finds a Way to Win Crown</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nothing came easy for Riverside King on Friday night. Getting an out
was tough and so was getting runs. But somehow, some way, the
third-year school found a way and defeated second-seeded Orange El
Modena, 2-1, in eight innings to win its first Southern Section
Division III championship, Friday at Barber Memorial Park in Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   The winning pitcher, Notre Dame-bound Heather Booth (19-1), made
big pitch after big pitch and survived with a defense that made five
errors behind her. Booth and Co. stranded 11 El Modena runners.</LD>
<LD>   To win the title, fourth-seeded King defeated top-seeded Pacifica
in the semifinals before knocking off El Modena--both are ranked in
the state's top 20.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't look at them as [No.] 1 and 2 seeds, we just focus on
ourselves," said Coach Jennifer McNatt. "We knew they were going to
run, we knew they were going to bunt. We prepared for a good team,
and made ourselves better. But was the road tough? Absolutely."</TE>
<TE>   This is only the second year of varsity play for King, but McNatt
said the program wasn't ahead of schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first opened with freshmen and sophomores, we knew we had
something real special with the girls that came in," McNatt said.
"What we lacked last year was that calm maturity."</TE>
<TE>   King, which left nine runners on base, took a 2-1 lead in the
eighth inning by taking advantage of an error and, two outs later,
with Anna Beardman on third base, a run-scoring single into the hole
at shortstop by junior Heather Gutterud.</TE>
<TE>   King (27-2) took the lead in the third inning when Beardman
singled and took second on a throw home that nailed Holly Ervin for
the second out of the inning. Hollee Haines followed with an RBI
single.</TE>
<TE>   El Modena (28-6) tied the score in the bottom of the seventh
inning after leadoff batter Norrelle Dickson bunted for a single, the
Vanguards' third hit of the game. She took second on a ground out and
scored on sophomore Ariana Munoz's line single.</TE>
<TE>   "That happens," said Booth, who retired the side in order in the
eighth inning, including her sixth strikeout to end the game. "I
think everyone took a bunch of deep breaths."</TE>
<TE>   Pomona Catholic 2, Covina Western Christian 0--Shortstop Kelley
Silagyi, center fielder Amanda Frost and catcher Stefanie Zamorano,
who won a section title as freshmen in 1999, won the Division V title
with the help of their youngest teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Amanda Addie singled with two outs in the bottom of the
fifth inning and sophomore Kymberly Silagyi, Kelley's sister, hit a
ground-rule double for the only run needed by the unseeded Pacers
(23-5), who will have six starters back next season.</TE>
<TE>   Addie (22-5), the winning pitcher, struck out five and scattered
six hits, four of them with two outs. She got an insurance run in the
bottom of the sixth when Briana Thomas, who reached base on an error
and stole second, scored on Vanessa Lavendera's single to left field.
Western Christian ends 20-10-1.</TE>

<HD>Lyon Still Makes Noise in 1,600</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Senior Dan Lyon of Hesperia Sultana High continued his meteoric
late-season progression in the boys' 1,600 meters by posting the
fastest qualifying time Friday before 6,895 in the state track and
field championships at Cerritos College.</LD>
<LD>   It remains to be seen, however, if he'll run as well in today's
final.</LD>
<LD>   Lyon looked superb in winning his heat in a career best of 4
minutes 11.92 seconds, the second-fastest time in the state this
year. But he expended valuable energy by running the final lap in
57.7 seconds when he needed only to finish among the top three
runners in his heat to automatically advance to the final.</LD>
<TE>   Sean Drake of San Francisco University, the state leader at
4:11.55, finished second behind Lyon in 4:14.48 with Humberto Rojas
of Costa Mesa Estancia third in 4:14.70.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel fine. I feel great," Lyon said when asked if he might have
run too fast on his final lap. "I was hoping [to run a personal
record], so I'm happy."</TE>
<TE>   Lyon viewed the 1,600 as his third-best race a month ago. But
since the steeplechase, his favorite event, is not contested at the
high school level in California, he figured his best chance to
advance to the state championships was by running the 800.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to run 1:52," Lyon said of his goal in the 800. "But I
had a bad race at [the Southern Section Division II preliminaries]."</TE>
<TE>   That bad race--a ninth-place finish in 2:02.60 in his heat--ended
Lyon's season in the 800. But it has allowed him to flourish in the
1,600.</TE>
<TE>   After running a then-career best of 4:22.88 to finish third in his
qualifying heat in the Division II preliminaries on May 10, he won
the final eight days later in 4:14.54 and placed third in 4:15.17 in
the Southern Section Masters Meet on May 24.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Allyson Felix of North Hills L.A. Baptist, senior Matt
Bruno of Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills and sophomore Michael Haddan of
Irvine Woodbridge were other local athletes who brought the crowd to
its feet with their performances.</TE>
<TE>   Felix, the defending state champion in the girls' 100, ran a
career-best and nation-leading 11.40 in the that event and clocked a
wind-aided 22.69 in the 200.</TE>
<TE>   The time in the 100 moved her to fifth on the all-time state
performer list and the 200 clocking was the fourth fastest U.S.
girls' time ever.</TE>
<TE>   Bruno led qualifying in the boys' 100 with a wind-aided 10.40,
despite looking to his right and then his left to check out his
competition in the final 20 meters of the race. He also won his heat
of the 200 in 21.02, the second-fastest qualifying time.</TE>
<TE>   Haddan cut more than 2 1/2 seconds off his best in the boys' 800
by winning his heat in a career-best and state-leading 1:51.02.</TE>
<TE>   High jumper T.J. Fakehinde of Fullerton Eastside Christian and
long jumper Chris McFoy of Chino were notable non-qualifiers.
Fakehinde tied for 10th in the high jump at 6 feet 5 inches after
clearing 7 feet earlier this year. McFoy failed to get off a fair
jump.</TE>
<TE>   The Bakersfield boys and the Long Beach Poly girls remained
favorites for team titles with their solid performances Friday.</TE>

<HD>A French Twist in Opener</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Defending champion France is stunned by Senegal,
1-0, in first game of the World Cup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Asia's first World Cup kicked off in sensational fashion Friday night
when world champion France crashed to a 1-0 defeat against Senegal,
the West African nation and former French colony that was making its
World Cup debut.</LD>
<LD>   Referee Ali Bujsaim of the United Arab Emirates seemed to take an
inordinately long time to blow the final whistle, but when he
eventually did, the French players marched off the field grim-faced
while the Senegalese rejoiced as if they had won the 32-nation
tournament, not merely opened it.</LD>
<LD>   One of them grabbed a large flag and circled the field at Seoul
World Cup Stadium, which earlier had been the scene of a spectacular
opening ceremony. The impromptu victory lap drew applause even from
the large section of blue-clad French fans among the crowd of 62,561.</LD>
<TE>   Senegal deserved its triumph and, in winning, threw wide open the
group that also includes Denmark and Uruguay, who play each other
today in Ulsan, South Korea. Almost anyone could advance now.</TE>
<TE>   The game's lone goal was a result of the speed, quickness and
opportunism that was a hallmark of the African players throughout the
90 pulsating minutes. Unimpressed by the pedigree of the world
champions, they carried the game to them and the upset--historic,
some said--was their reward.</TE>
<TE>   The goal came in the 30th minute after a Senegalese player
intercepted the ball from Youri Djorkaeff at midfield and sent it out
on the left flank to El Hadji Diouf, Africa's 2001 player of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Diouf sprinted around French defender Frank Leboeuf, with whom he
battled all night, before cutting the ball back sharply across the
face of the goal. Defender Emmanuel Petit tried to clear it but
succeeded only in bouncing the ball off the legs of rattled
goalkeeper Fabien Barthez.</TE>
<TE>   It rebounded kindly for fallen midfielder Papa Bouba Diop, who was
on the ground when he hooked the ball into the open net.</TE>
<TE>   "It was great," said Diop. "To score the first goal in the World
Cup, I had been dreaming about it before the match. I was really
trying."</TE>
<TE>   The goal sparked a unique celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Diop raced to the corner flag, stripped off his jersey, laid it on
the ground and then led half a dozen other Senegalese players in a
dance around it.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd seemed stunned by the turn of events, but France
immediately began to pick up the pace and it seemed only a matter of
time before the tying goal would come and the world would be set
right again.</TE>
<TE>   It was not to be.</TE>
<TE>   Senegal, with goalkeeper Tony Sylva in fine form and led by the
exemplary play of defender Ferdinand Coly, time and again denied the
French, whose attacking forays lacked the precision that had taken
apart Brazil in the final when France won the World Cup in Paris four
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The reason was obvious. With inspirational playmaker Zinedine
Zidane sidelined by a torn thigh muscle, the French lacked a player
who could single-handedly grab the game by the scruff of the neck and
change its direction.</TE>
<TE>   Thierry Henry tried, but the closest he came to having an impact
was when he lofted a shot that bounced off the Senegal crossbar in
the 65th minute. Even then, he was merely repeating something
Khalilou Fadiga had done a minute earlier when he rattled the French
crossbar with a fierce shot of his own.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Lemerre, France's coach, tried to swing the game back in his
favor by bringing on first Christophe Dugarry and later Djibril Cisse
as second-half substitutes, but neither was able to change matters.</TE>
<TE>   When it was all over, Lemerre conceded that Senegal's defense had
won the day.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing miraculous about Senegal's win," he said. "They
were well organized. They had three or four chances to score and they
took one of them. We played poorly individually and collectively. We
had three or four chances and didn't take any of them.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's not all over for us. There are two matches to go and we
can go through [to the second round] with six points."</TE>
<TE>   Those points will be more difficult to come by now that the Danes
and Uruguayans have scented French blood in the water. And Senegal
must like its chances after its excellent performance.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the whole of Africa will be celebrating this
result," Diouf said. "I think that if we carry on like that we have a
good chance of progressing."</TE>
<TE>   Senegal Coach Bruno Metsu seemed almost as shocked by the result
as Lemerre.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I am not the best coach in the world, but after tonight I
am not the worst," he said. "It's like a dream--not a miracle,
though. We are past one step but there are two big mountains to
climb. We have to play at this level against Uruguay and Denmark."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever lies ahead, the Lions of Teranga, as the Senegalese team
is nicknamed, have written their own page in the World Cup history
book. The upset ranks among the biggest in the 72-year history of the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   It was enough, in fact, to set Senegalese fans dancing through the
streets of Dakar, naturally enough, but also of Paris, the same
streets French fans cavorted in just four years ago the last time
their team played a World Cup match.</TE>

<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Toppling Giants</TE>
<TE>   With its victory over France, Senegal joins a short list of soccer
minnows who have stunned some of the sport's big fish:</TE>
<TE>   UNITED STATES 1, ENGLAND 0</TE>
<TE>   1950 * Brazil</TE>
<TE>   When this score crossed the wire desk at newspapers in England,
more than one editor initially thought it was a misprint for a 10-1
English victory. Joe Gaetjens' header in the 38th minute and
goalkeeper Frank Borghi's strong play in the second half provided the
upset, the last U.S. World Cup victory for 44 years.</TE>
<TE>   NORTH KOREA 1, ITALY 0</TE>
<TE>   1966 * England</TE>
<TE>   This was no first-game misstep. Italy needed at least a tie in its
final group game to advance to the quarterfinals. But Park Doo-Ik's
goal off a poor Italian clearance gave North Korea the biggest World
Cup victory ever achieved by an Asian team.</TE>
<TE>   ALGERIA 2, WEST GERMANY 1</TE>
<TE>   1982 * Spain</TE>
<TE>   West Germany appeared to have avoided the upset with a tying goal
in the 67th minute, only to lose its opening game on Lakhdar
Belloumi's goal two minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   CAMEROON 1, ARGENTINA 0</TE>
<TE>   1990 * Italy</TE>
<TE>   A foul-marred tournament-opening game appeared headed for a
scoreless tie until Francois Omam Biyick headed down a cross, and the
shot slipped past goalkeeper Nery Pumpido and bounced in off his leg.
Cameroon would later come within minutes of qualifying for the
semifinals in the best showing ever by an African team.</TE>

<TE>   Record vs. Sting (2001)--1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--For the third time in their four-game trip, the Sparks
will be a season-opening opponent. Charlotte's last game was a 57-44
exhibition victory over Detroit 12 days ago. The Sting and Sparks are
meeting for the first time since last year's WNBA finals, when Los
Angeles defeated Charlotte, two games to none, to win the
championship. Veteran guard Dawn Staley, plagued by bad knees during
the preseason, will be available for the Sting tonight. The game is a
homecoming for Spark rookie guard Nikki Teasley, who played at North
Carolina and is the school's all-time assist leader. Los Angeles is
coming off a ragged 69-65 victory over Miami on Thursday, led by
Mwadi Mabika's 17 points. The Sparks hold a 10-4 lifetime edge over
Charlotte, winning the last nine in a row.</TE>

<HD>Bibby Shows a Different Side</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sacramento King point guard Mike Bibby finally showed a human side
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Bibby missed open shots, lost control of the basketball, lost
track of his defensive assignment and failed to find an open teammate
more than once during Game 6 of the Western Conference finals at
Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Near the end, with the Lakers poised to even the series, Bibby's
nose was bloodied by Kobe Bryant's elbow as the Laker guard broke
away from Bibby toward an inbounds pass with 11.8 seconds left.</LD>
<TE>   Bryant could easily have been whistled for a foul against Bibby in
the 106-102 Laker victory. Bryant made two free throws that gave the
Lakers a 105-102 lead. Bibby then missed a three-point attempt that
could have tied the score, 105-105, with 2.4 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to deny him the ball," Bibby said when asked to describe
one of several pivotal plays late in the game. "The next thing I
knew, I got hit and was on the floor, so I don't know [what
happened]."</TE>
<TE>   Bruised but unbowed, Bibby vowed to improve his play Sunday for
Game 7 at Arco Arena. The Kings lost Game 6 by four points, and there
was no sense for Bibby to fret about missing 13 of 20 shots,
including seven of eight in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, Bibby said his nose was not broken.</TE>
<TE>   "They said it wasn't broken, so I guess I'm OK," Bibby said after
scoring 23 points, taking four rebounds and passing for three assists
in 41 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think he caused problems for the Lakers," King Coach Rick
Adelman said. "They hounded him. They had [Derek] Fisher, [Lindsey]
Hunter, [Brian] Shaw and Kobe on him, but he still created a lot of
havoc out there. You've got to feel he'll respond Sunday. He has all
along."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Lakers played Bibby tighter than at any point in the
series. Hunter did the most badgering, entering the game after Fisher
got his second foul with 6:17 left in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   At times, Laker Coach Phil Jackson alternated his defensive
assignments, running Bryant at Bibby on one Sacramento trip down the
floor and Fisher checking him on the next. If Bibby's poor shooting
was any indication, the tactic worked.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby has consistently outplayed Fisher, having increased his
scoring average from 13.7 points during the regular season to 21.7
against the Lakers. He is averaging 19.7 in his first playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "We got him off his game in the first quarter," Jackson said. "He
hit some big shots in the second half. He found a way to have an
impact during the course of the game."</TE>

<LD>For a few hours on a sweaty afternoon, Arabs and Jews in the town of
Abu Gosh had something of a rare encounter, gathering in a restaurant
Friday to watch the opening match of the World Cup soccer tournament
on a big screen TV.</LD>
<LD>   As Senegal upset France, 1-0, in Seoul, there was no talk of
politics and battles beyond the soccer field.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the time to bring together both sides, Arabs and Jews for
one month to put politics on one side and watch the game," said Arab
businessman Jawdat Ibrahim, who invited Jews to his restaurant to
watch the games in the coming weeks.</LD>
<TE>   During the last 20 months of fighting, Jewish and Arab citizens of
Israel have kept their distance from one another, even in Abu Gosh, a
mostly Arab town, where residents have had long-standing links to
Jews and have ties to its government.</TE>
<TE>   An Arab waiter, Majd Ibrahim, was happy to see Jews in the
restaurant for the game--a moment of eased tensions.</TE>
<TE>   "We missed it for a long time," he said. "Everybody was waiting
for this day.... It's like the old days."</TE>

<LD>The American-Russian crew aboard the international space station can
follow their favorite World Cup teams from orbit, thanks to updates
from accommodating colleagues at mission control, Russian space
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "During communication sessions with the ISS, teams from the
Russian and U.S. mission control centers will make up news reports
about the soccer championship," deputy chief of Russian Mission
Control Viktor Blagov told Interfax news agency.</LD>
<LD>   He said the crew will not be able to see video of the games,
however, because of technical complications.</LD>
<TE>   Americans Daniel Bursch and Carl Walz have been living aboard the
orbiting outpost since December along with their Russian commander,
Yuri Onufrienko.</TE>

<LD>In the second fatal accident in two weeks to befall a Bangladeshi fan
of Argentina, a 17-year old supporter was electrocuted in Chittagong
as he tried to hoist the South American nation's flag.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Mukhlesur Rahman, a 17-year-old barber shop employee,
was killed after he touched a high-tension power cable as he was
tying a huge flag to a metal rod on top of a four-story building.</LD>
<LD>   He was taking part in a protest with 200 other fans against World
Cup co-host Japan's refusal to grant a visa to former Argentine star
Diego Maradona because of a previous drug offense, police said.</LD>
