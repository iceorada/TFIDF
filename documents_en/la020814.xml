<DH>Despite its excesses, GM's H2 probably will be a hit</DH>

<LD>There is no good reason to purchase General Motors Corp.'s new Hummer
H2, little brother to the humongous H1, which itself is an exercise
in automotive excess. This alone probably ensures that, in Southern
California at least, it will be a runaway hit.</LD>
<LD>   This after all is the land of the two-occupant Suburban; the
extra-long, extra-cab pickup and the triple-triple cheeseburger.</LD>
<LD>   The H2 retains most of its larger sibling's militaristic styling.
The H1, you'll recall, is the civilian version of the Army Humvee
fighting vehicle that gained prominence racing through Kuwaiti oil
fields during the Desert Storm campaign back in the first George
Bush's time in office.</LD>
<TE>   The H2 is a big, rude (but not crude), muscular brute. But it
probably will spend more time hauling suburban moms and their 1.2
offspring to school events and soccer matches than plowing over sand
dunes and through rugged canyons.</TE>
<TE>   And though its 316-horsepower, gasoline-fueled V-8 doesn't spew
diesel fumes like its big brother, at 10 miles per gallon it is no
friend of the planet. Conspiracy theorists might even think that the
gas-guzzling H2 is one of the reasons we were over there protecting
Kuwait's oil in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   That said, GM undoubtedly will sell all the H2s it can make. It
publicly says that it plans to build 20,000 of the inaugural 2003
model that went on sale last month, and insiders say 40,000 probably
is a better estimate of annual demand.</TE>
<TE>   This, after all, is a $50,000 version of the $112,000 H1 boy toy
that Arnold Schwarzenegger putts around in. And I'd wager there are
at least 40,000 guys out there with enough income and vanity to be
willing to play half-price Schwarzenegger--not to mention the women
who will want one just because it's even bigger, and thus must be
more secure, than the Suburban or Excursion or Range Rover or
whatever else doubles as the family school bus.</TE>
<TE>   I knew GM had a winner when I brought home an H2 last month. My
job lets me park a lot of new vehicles in the drive, and the
neighbors are a good gauge of what probably will hit the spot, at
least with Southern California suburbanites.</TE>
<TE>   I've had a lot of dads ask for rides in hot cars such as the
Nissan Z or trucks such as the Dodge Ram, and quite a few kids--and
their moms--lined up a few years ago to ask if they could go for a
ride in the Rolls-Royce Corniche.</TE>
<TE>   But no vehicle, not even Lamborghini's sleek and exotic new
Murcielago, has drawn the response of the H2. Small, shy children, of
both genders, aggressively ran up to plead for a ride. So did their
moms. And their dads. And their older siblings. It drew a mix even
the H1 couldn't match.</TE>
<TE>   Other auto makers should take note: If you are chasing the elusive
youth market, you could do worse than come up with an H2 look-alike.
GM certainly has figured it out. The auto maker is planning a
smaller, and less expensive, H3 (think Chevy Blazer on steroids) to
attract those often cash-strapped younger buyers.</TE>
<TE>   GM doesn't actually make the H2. Part of the selling strategy is
that the vehicle is made by Humvee (High Mobility Multipurpose
Vehicle) manufacturer AM General. The H2 plant is a new one in South
Bend, Ind., alongside the original Humvee and Hummer H1 plant.</TE>
<TE>   GM bought the Hummer brand, which gives it distribution rights to
the H1, and did another deal that calls for AM General to build the
H2 using a boatload of GM parts. It has been estimated that the
companies expect to split a profit of close to $8,000 for each H2
sold.</TE>
<TE>   And GM, which is requiring its Hummer dealers to build showrooms
that pay homage to the vehicles' rugged military-outdoors background,
isn't stopping there.</TE>
<TE>   Mike DiGiovanni, Hummer division general manager, gets starry-eyed
as he talks about sales of Hummer caps, Hummer shirts, Hummer brush
guards, luggage racks, chrome packages and on and on.</TE>
<TE>   But to be successful after the first crush of
"gotta-be-first-on-the-block-to-have-it-no-matter-what" buyers is
satisfied, a vehicle still must perform.</TE>
<TE>   The H2 does.</TE>
<TE>   DiGiovanni says it will do 80% of what an H1 will do, and after a
day in the outback with each I won't disagree.</TE>
<TE>   The beauty of the H2 is that it can take you anywhere a
well-equipped Jeep can, but will do so in far more comfort while
carrying more people and more cargo and towing much larger boats or
trailers.</TE>
<TE>   And the H2 comes ready to roll over the rocks, unlike many Jeeps
that must be outfitted with aftermarket axles, wheels, tires and
other expensive equipment to be truly off-road tough (although Jeep
is about to hit the market with a new Wrangler model, the Rubicon,
that has most of those improvements straight from the factory and
will cost about half as much as the H2).</TE>
<TE>   The H2 is built on a modified Chevy Suburban platform, with comfy
captain's-chair seats up front, coil spring suspension (independent
front, solid axle rear) to absorb road bumps and 35-inch all-terrain
tires that work as well smoothing out the highway as they do
providing traction in rough off-road conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The base model, at $48,800, is quite well-equipped--6.0-liter V-8,
four-speed automatic; full-time four-wheel drive with a really
low-geared low range and 9 inches of ground clearance for rock
crawling; four-wheel anti-lock brakes; and creature comforts such as
air conditioning, CD player, on-board electronic compass, tinted
windows and power side mirrors.</TE>
<TE>   A fully loaded model, with leather upholstery, a sunroof, air
suspension, heated seats and a host of other goodies, tops out at
about $55,000.</TE>
<TE>   We took the H2 up Clark's Grade, a steep, rutted dirt-and-rock
track that leads into Big Bear from the Seven Oaks area off Highway
38 on the trek up from Redlands. The trail started life as a mule
track in the late 1800s and has reverted--and then some--since it
stopped being an unpaved auto route sometime in the 1930s. Although
not as tough as some off-road trails, Clark's Grade has enough twists
and turns, narrow spots and crumbly surfaces to provide a challenge,
and the H2 handled it with aplomb.</TE>
<TE>   At 81.2 inches wide, it is narrower than the H1 but wider than any
civilian passenger vehicle on the road. But it still makes it around
switchbacks and through steep-sided gullies with ease. The width adds
to its sure-footedness (tread width is an impressive 69.4 inches) off
road and ride comfort on the highway.</TE>
<TE>   A month earlier, we took an H1 through its paces in the
Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, including a spooky descent through
Diablo Dropoff, a steep, twisting, narrow cut through the rock that
drops several hundred feet from a desert plateau into Fish Creek
wash.</TE>
<TE>   A few fellow off-roaders in Jeeps and jacked-up four-wheel pickups
questioned whether the hulking H1 would get stuck, but it drove
through the wash just fine by riding high up on the rocky walls on
its knobby 35-inch tires.</TE>
<TE>   I would have no qualms about repeating the descent in the H2.</TE>
<TE>   And frankly, I'd much prefer the H2 to its big brother on the trip
to and from Anza-Borrego, or on any other on-road trip.</TE>
<TE>   The H2 is far superior to the H1 on paved roads and, although
smaller, is far more comfortable inside, thanks to its conventional
Suburban-like fittings (versus the H1's barely civilian-ized
interior).</TE>
<TE>   Still, my long-suffering wife, who often "volunteers" to test the
back seats on these jaunts, said the H2's rear seats were too soft
and flat. She preferred the individual rear buckets in the H1 for
off-roading, she said, because they hold you in place, while the H2
bench seat lets you get tossed around.</TE>
<TE>   Another drawback to the H2 is that despite its heft, it really
doesn't have much interior space, although it has more usable
passenger space than the H1. It's fine for four, but try to cram
three people in the second-row seat and they'd better be really close
friends. And add the optional third-row seat--a solo seat thanks to
the full-size spare that takes up half the rear cargo area--and
there's not only an uncomfortable place for a lonely passenger but
also almost no room inside the vehicle for cargo.</TE>
<TE>   Final words: It would be better suited to Wyoming ranchers and
commercial off-road guides, but expect the H2 to start replacing the
Suburban as the family hauler of choice among well-to-do suburbanites
who must have the latest "in" things. It is a well-done and very
accomplished multipurpose vehicle, even if there is very little need
for it.</TE>

<HD>Power Windows: Getting a Lock on the Problem</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH VARTABEDIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New homes do not have power windows, but new cars do. How odd. At the
push of a button, the car window goes up or down, at least until the
mechanism buried inside the door breaks. Then the convenience of
power is transformed into the mundane problem of a window stuck open
or closed.</LD>
<LD>   Power windows, now standard equipment on the majority of new cars,
often last the life of a vehicle without needing repairs. But when a
car does encounter window problems, the owner will face an unpleasant
repair bill.</LD>
<LD>   Gas-fueled vehicles could not go very far without electric motors
that operate many systems, including the power windows.</LD>
<TE>   With so many devices operated by electric motors, problems with
them are not uncommon.</TE>
<TE>   Under the hood, electric motors operate most fuel pumps and engine
fans. Antennas, seats, door locks, windshield wipers and minivan
doors are all powered by electric systems. In coming years, electric
motors will operate water pumps, engine valves and even air
conditioning compressors.</TE>
<TE>   A reader not long ago wrote to complain about his Ford's power
windows--which opened and closed with a jerky motion, sometimes
requiring a little push or pull from the driver to behave properly.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was solved temporarily with a spray lubricant, but the
jerky movement returned. Another type of lubricant also provided
temporary relief. "Am I missing something?" the owner asked.</TE>
<TE>   Well, of course. The lubricant failed to fix the problem. And who
wants to spend every weekend lubricating the inside of a car door?</TE>
<TE>   The power window is certainly not one of the most sophisticated
pieces of equipment on a car, but like a cup holder it is expected to
perform flawlessly for the owner's comfort. And as with a cup holder,
a lot of car makers are fussy about the design of their power
windows.</TE>
<TE>   Most people never get to see the workings of a power window. They
all have a little bit of Rube Goldberg design in them, using various
combinations of gears, levers, pulleys, cables, felt tracks for
guiding the glass and rubber seals.</TE>
<TE>   Not only do the windows have power action, they also must
withstand winds of 80 mph or more, driving rain, ice and baking
desert heat, not to mention the abuse inflicted by 4-year-olds who
are infinitely fascinated by putting windows in motion.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all power windows have two key parts, the electric motor
and the regulator--the mechanical linkage that transforms the
rotating motion of the motor to the up and down motion of the window.</TE>
<TE>   The most common regulator is a scissor-type arrangement that has
four bars arranged in a parallelogram. Ford typically uses a scissor
regulator married to a plastic gear system on the electric motor.
Some vehicles, including some Volkswagens, use what's called a goldie
cable or a bowden cable. Both use cables and pulleys to provide
lifting motion to the window.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the type of regulator used, problems with power
windows typically occur in four areas: a weak or broken motor, a
poorly aligned window, a worn-out felt track or a binding regulator.</TE>
<TE>   If the window is slow to move, particularly when it is going down,
the problem is usually a weak motor, said Sam Memmolo, a master
mechanic and nationally recognized auto repair expert from Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   The only way to be sure is to open up the door and inspect the
system. Felt tracks often become bunched up, creating obstacles for
the window. Attempts to straighten the felt usually fail, so it's
best to replace the tracks if there is any wear on them. Regulators
should be lubricated at their pivot and movement points and checked
for proper alignment.</TE>
<TE>   If those items look like they are in working order, then the
problem probably is with the motor. A mechanic can perform a voltage
check to determine whether it is getting current and whether it is
shorting out. A new motor can cost upward of $100 and that much or
more to install.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>You're 16, ready to hit the road in your new ride. The last thing you
want to be is the cause of the next traffic tie-up on the 405.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe you should have spent some of that time the other
morning--when you were all wrapped up listening to that new Eminem
album--getting a tuneup instead.</LD>
<LD>   The basic science behind cars hasn't changed since Henry Ford
began mass-producing them about a century ago. Car has wheels, car
has engine, engine turns wheels and car goes where you want. Usually.</LD>
<TE>   But sometimes your car needs either simple work (think oil change)
or more complicated repairs to make it go.</TE>
<TE>   So how do you find a good mechanic, especially if you're newly on
your own and don't have a fat bank account?</TE>
<TE>   Your friends always seem to have a hookup with a guy they've known
for years. But that guy's in Hawaii on vacation when you need him.</TE>
<TE>   You could take the penny-pincher route, scouring town for the
cheapest rates and hoping the repairs will last as long as the car.</TE>
<TE>   But let's face it: Finding a good and honest mechanic, someone who
will keep your car on the road without bankrupting you, can be as
difficult as a challenge on "Fear Factor."</TE>
<TE>   The experts say there are ways to minimize the work involved.</TE>
<TE>   Always check the walls of a shop for a quality certificate from
the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence--known as
ASE. The organization certifies mechanics in a dozen or so topics,
from brake jobs to engine overhauls, said Jeff Spring, a spokesman
for the Automobile Club of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The ASE certificate on a garage's wall is the same as the health
department's "A" grade at a restaurant: Anything less should be
passed by. Quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Another way to check on a garage you are thinking of using is to
check with the state Bureau of Automotive Repair, which licenses
repair shops. The bureau's Web site, at www.smogcheck.ca.gov (click
on the "verify a repair dealer's license" button), will show a shop's
disciplinary and complaint history and the status of its license.</TE>
<TE>   Spring also suggests you look for an AAA-accredited shop.</TE>
<TE>   "AAA-approved shops must meet strict standards, from cleanliness
to safety standards and practices of the shop and its employees,"
Spring said.</TE>
<TE>   You can go into any Auto Club office, whether or not you are a
member, and ask for the brochure of approved shops. Club members also
can look up this information at www.aaa.com.</TE>
<TE>   Another key to identifying a good mechanic, Spring said, is
"longevity. A good mechanic has been around awhile."</TE>
<TE>   But one of the problems of youth is that though there usually is
lots of time for concerts and movies, necessary evils such as
studying and researching a good mechanic can get short shrift. Many
teens and young twenties say they just don't allow the time to
research a mechanic's background.</TE>
<TE>   But they still want what everyone wants: quick, reliable service
that is a value for the money spent.</TE>
<TE>   "What I look for is honesty," said Ricky Jones, 22, a student at
Cal State Dominguez Hills. He said he knows enough about his car to
know when a mechanic is trying to talk him into repairs that aren't
needed. "I don't appreciate that."</TE>
<TE>   Jones has had his share of dealings with mechanics--he drives a
1996 Escort that's had its share of problems.</TE>
<TE>   But he says he's learned from each and feels that he knows now
what to look for in a shop.</TE>
<TE>   "Good prices, reasonable prices. Quick [service]. And an
explanation of what is being done," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones has done a few things right in his quest for peace of mind
at the garage.</TE>
<TE>   He always asks for a written rundown of what the repairs and
services are to be.</TE>
<TE>   He also has learned to ask about warranty information. As they say
in the business: Six months is great, 90 days is good, and if all
that is offered is 30 days on parts and labor, it's time to find a
new mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   Mechanics have their own suggestions on how first-time car owners
can find a good match.</TE>
<TE>   "A referral is usually best," said Al Workman of Al's Automotive
in Burbank. But if that's not an option, Workman suggests doing a
compatibility check.</TE>
<TE>   "Check the shop and look at the types of cars they work on. You
obviously wouldn't want to take a Nissan to a place where they
normally work on Rolls-Royces," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The word from someone with a couple of decades of experience in
mechanic hunting is that communication is the key to building a
relationship with the person who will be fixing your car.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Rowinsky, 32, a Van Nuys marine biologist, said he talks to
mechanics like the professionals he hopes they are, and in return he
expects that they "don't talk to me like I'm stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Rowinsky said he looks for garages that are part of well-known
chains when it is time for his aging Land Cruiser's routine checkups
and repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Those chains typically have ASE-certified technicians.</TE>
<TE>   One of the keys to dealing with car repairs, experts say, is to
keep on top of them. Check with the mechanic periodically to make
sure you know what is being done when the car is in the shop, and
take the vehicle back promptly if it's not fixed properly the first
time.</TE>
<TE>   Tell the mechanic that that mysterious sound you brought it in for
is back. Offer to take a ride with him or her so you can demonstrate
exactly what that awful noise is and make sure your mechanic knows
too.</TE>
<TE>   And always ask for the old parts back if parts are being replaced.
You won't need the old stuff, but you'll have the peace of mind of
knowing that you didn't just pay to have the same old problem parts
reinstalled.</TE>
<TE>   Some mechanics, including Workman, say they like having younger
customers.</TE>
<TE>   After all, a good mechanic-customer relationship guarantees repeat
business, and establishing a good relationship with a mechanic
guarantees a young car owner peace of mind.</TE>

<LD>Rubbery industrial tomatoes may be available year round, but real
tomato lovers wait until now to go wild for heirlooms, the older,
traditional varieties selected for their distinctive flavor and
appearance, and propagated by seed for decades or centuries.</LD>
<LD>   Some have become familiar, such as complex, spicy pink Brandywine,
sweet Cherokee Purple and tangy Green Zebra. Others are cult
favorites, like the gothic-looking Black Krim and variegated,
sweet-tart Hillbilly.</LD>
<LD>   Brandywine, that ruby idol of the seed-saving movement, is a large
beefsteak type, very meaty, with rich flavor. Although many believe
it to be of Amish origin, it is actually a commercial variety
introduced in 1889 by a Philadelphia seed firm.</LD>
<TE>   Another favorite, Cherokee Purple, has thin, dusky pink skin with
darker shoulders and exceptionally sweet flavor.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most beautiful is Pineapple, a giant fruit with yellow
skin and sweet, juicy flesh, both streaked with red. When it is
sliced, the red streaks appear as dramatic swirls, making a gorgeous
presentation in salads.</TE>
<TE>   Persimmon, a large, flat, golden-orange tomato with sweet, mild
flavor, might almost be mistaken for its fruit namesake. Even more
distinctive is Peach, which has medium-size globular fruit with pale
pink, slightly fuzzy skin.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the tomatoes often considered heirlooms are actually
modern varieties. Dr. Carolyn, a small yellow tomato which Dede and
Jon Thogmartin have started to grow this year, is named after Dr.
Carolyn Male, a microbiologist and tomato enthusiast; it has a
characteristic burst of cherry tomato flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Costoluto Canestrino, an Italian tomato with ruffled lobes and a
robust flavor, has been sold at farmers markets for just three years,
since chef Evan Kleiman brought the seeds from Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Not every heirloom is a winner: They can be bland or mealy if
overwatered, overripe or harvested early or late. When the weather is
hot, some varieties, like Green Zebra, pass from hard and tart to
mushy and tasteless in only a day or two. Evergreen, a larger variety
with green skin and flesh, has similar flavor but holds up better.
The paler sorts, such as White Wonder and Great White, are beautiful
but mild.</TE>
<TE>   August is when tomatoes peak, and most of the heirlooms at farmers
markets are good. Some vendors offer samples, always the best
guarantee against disappointment. Tomatoes don't have the pronounced
aroma of good peaches and melons, but ripe ones should waft a
pleasant vegetal scent. These stands offer some of the best:</TE>
<TE>   Encino (17400 Victory Blvd.), Sunday, 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.: McGrath
Farms.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood (Ivar Avenue between Sunset and Hollywood boulevards),
Sunday, 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.: Coastal Organics, Flora Bella Farm,
McGrath Farms, Thogmartin Farm, Tutti-Frutti Farm.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica (Arizona Avenue between 2nd and 3rd streets),
Wednesday, 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.: Coastal Organics, Flora Bella Farm,
McGrath Farms, Munak Ranch, Thogmartin Farm, Tutti-Frutti Farm.</TE>
<TE>   Torrance (Wilson Park, 2200 Crenshaw Blvd.), Tuesday and Saturday,
8 a.m.to 1 p.m.: Cahuilla Mountain Farm.</TE>
<TE>   Hot Tip</TE>
<TE>   For luscious locally grown litchis, available for just a few
weeks, show up early at Jerry Dimitman's stand at the Alhambra
farmers market (Bay State and Monterey streets, Sunday, 8:30 a.m. to
1 p.m.).</TE>

<HD>Beyond the Beauty</HD>
<DH>With heirloom tomatoes, the spectrum of flavor is truly
stunning</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DONNA DEANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's no arguing that heirloom tomatoes are beautiful. The same
fruits banished from supermarket shelves, because they were too
soft-skinned, too small, too large and too otherwise old-fashioned to
endure conveyor belts and refrigerator cases, made their way back to
retooled markets because of their thrilling range of colors and
shapes.</LD>
<LD>   Tour the stalls of a farmers market or wander the aisles of an
upscale supermarket anywhere in America from August to October, and
the displays of heirloom tomatoes are so bright they make Joseph's
Technicolor Dreamcoat look as dull as wet tweed.</LD>
<LD>   We not only love the rainbow displays, we expect them. But we have
yet to embrace the greater story behind that blush of colors. This is
a range of textures and flavors that almost renders the visual kick
of heirlooms irrelevant.</LD>
<TE>   Heirlooms come so tart they could supplant vinegar in a salad
dressing, so sweet they are halfway to pie filling or begging to dive
into a pot to be made into a thick winter jam. Slice into the steaky,
purple flesh of a Black Krim, slip a cook's bite on your tongue, and
you could swear it was already dressed. This tomato wants nothing but
taking to table, fast, before you devour it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anything creates the frenzy that tomatoes do," says
Maryann Carpenter of Coastal Organics, which sells both heirloom
tomatoes and favorites such as Early Girl at farmers markets. "Our
business kicks up a notch or two in summer when we have
tomatoes--it's our busiest time of year."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, chefs can't resist them either. Coastal Organics sells
to more than 30 chefs every week, who buy tomatoes by the case. One,
Josiah Citrin, creates a tomato tasting menu every year at Melisse in
Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   "The different varieties, flavors and textures are wonderful," he
says. "I can create a whole menu of eight courses using tomatoes."</TE>
<TE>   That menu, Celebration of Tomatoes, costs $95 a person and
includes a lobster ceviche with Green Zebra tomatoes, a chanterelle
risotto with roasted heirlooms and foie gras poached in a tomato
consomme. Citrin loves tomatoes so that he's growing them on the roof
of the restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Evan Kleiman, the chef of Angeli Caffe on Melrose Avenue, is so
enamored of Costoluto Canestrino, an Italian sauce tomato with
distinctive ruffled lobes, that for the past three years she has
brought back packets of seeds for farmers to plant. She describes her
crusade as a "mission from God."</TE>
<TE>   "They are the best sauce tomatoes I've ever tasted," she says.
"They don't have much water, but enough for meaty, juicy flesh that
breaks down very quickly in the pan, leaving a sauce of great color,
flavor and consistency."</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Pierre Bosc, the chef at Mimosa in Los Angeles, supplements
his restaurant supply with tomatoes from his garden. One of his
favorite dishes is a tart of roasted tomatoes and pistou that
practically sings with summery flavor.</TE>
<TE>   The Times Test Kitchen isn't immune to this seasonal tomato fever.
Over the past week, we created recipes that celebrate pure tomato
flavor--you'll find no overwhelming additions of cheese or herbs or
cream here.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, our soup is made by simply skinning fresh tomatoes
and saving every last drop of their juice, so every last bit of
flavor arrives in the bowl. Because the soup is pureed, it looks and
tastes as rich as if it were made with cream, yet it has none. It
would also be beautiful made with yellow tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Our heirloom tomato salad is so easy--heirlooms need little to
shine. Just cut them into thick chunks, toss them with a vinaigrette
and fresh arugula, and add a sprinkling of fleur de sel and cracked
black pepper. The result is juicy and tangy with a bit of
crunch--perfect for a hot summer day.</TE>
<TE>   We also loved cookbook author Ana Thomas' recipe for Charred
Tomatoes With Garlic and Olives. Rich and concentrated, it's like a
tomato butter. While it would be good with crusty bread, we couldn't
resist it plain, so powerful was the fresh tomato flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if you'd rather not cook, there are even simpler ways
to enjoy great tomatoes. Rub a half of a ripe tomato on a toasted
garlic baguette. Drizzle a beautiful platter of sliced heirlooms with
a bit of olive oil and sprinkle with a good salt. A favorite dish, of
course, is insalata Caprese: slice tomatoes, arrange them on a
platter with fresh mozzarella and basil leaves and then just add a
little olive oil, salt and pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Or you can grill some tomato halves, sprinkle them with fresh
herbs and Parmesan, and you have good complement for steaks, fish or
poultry.</TE>
<TE>   Just be sure to start with good tomatoes, and don't let them
linger. Ripe tomatoes should be eaten within a day or two, and should
never, ever, feel the chill of the refrigerator. Or that precious
flavor will be lost.</TE>

<TE>   From Donna Deane, director of the Times Test Kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   3 pounds tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons butter</TE>
<TE>   1 small onion, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon celery seeds</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Cracked pepper</TE>
<TE>   Basil leaves, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Bring a small pot of water to boil. Make an "x" with a knife in
the bottom of each tomato then add them, a few at a time, to the pot.
Cook 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove the tomatoes and place in a large
bowl of ice water, then peel and core. Cut the tomatoes in half
horizontally. Squeeze the seeds from the tomatoes into a strainer set
over a large bowl. Press against the seeds with a spoon to extract
the juice; add enough water to the juice to measure 1 cup. Set aside
the juice and discard the seeds. Dice the tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the
onion and cook until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and
reserved juice. Stir in the sugar, celery seeds and salt. Bring to a
simmer. Cover and cook about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   Puree the soup in a food processor or blender until smooth. Season
with the cracked pepper to taste. Pour into serving bowls and garnish
each serving with a basil leaf.</TE>

<TE>   Charred Tomatoes With Garlic and Olives</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 50
minutes * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   From "The New Vegetarian Epicure" by Anna Thomas (Knopf, $30).
These slow-roasted tomatoes, allowed to char twice, have a terrific
intensity of flavor. A bowl of these tomatoes, a bowl of hummus and
some pita bread make a great appetizer. Or, serve them with a simple
crusty bread.</TE>
<TE>   4 pounds red tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   5 cloves garlic</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   6 to 8 Kalamata olives</TE>
<TE>   Heat the broiler.</TE>
<TE>   Place the tomatoes on a baking sheet, and put them directly under
the broiler. Watch them carefully: As they blister and the skins turn
black, turn them over. When the skins are pretty well charred, about
3 minutes each side, remove the tomatoes from the oven, peel off the
skins (they will almost fall off), and trim out their stem ends.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the tomatoes into large pieces and put them back on the baking
sheet. Peel the garlic cloves, cut them in half if they're very
large, and scatter them among the tomatoes. Drizzle the tomatoes with
1 tablespoon of olive oil, and sprinkle them with 1 teaspoon of salt.
Turn the oven down to 400 degrees and set the tomatoes on the middle
rack. Check them every half hour, and as they start to show little
charred spots again, stir them up, mixing the blackened spots in.</TE>
<TE>   In about 1 1/2 to 2 hours, you should have a thickened mass of
tomatoes, flecked with dark bits. Remove this from the oven, give it
another stir, taste, and add salt only if needed.</TE>
<TE>   Spoon the tomatoes into a shallow serving bowl, smooth the top,
and drizzle the remaining tablespoon of olive oil on top. Remove the
pits from the olives and chop the olives coarsely. Sprinkle the
chopped olives over the tomatoes.</TE>

Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   This is from Jean-Pierre Bosc of Mimosa in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   PISTOU</TE>
<TE>   2 cups firmly packed basil leaves</TE>
<TE>   8 cloves garlic</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons Parmesan</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons salt</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup olive oil</TE>
<TE>   Combine the basil, garlic, Parmesan, salt, pepper and oil in a
food processor until a paste forms, 1 to 2 minutes. Adjust
seasonings.</TE>
<TE>   TARTE TATIN</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons chopped garlic</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup olive oil</TE>
<TE>   About 12 plum tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   1 (10-inch-square) sheet puff pastry, thawed at room temperature
20 to 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   3 cups salad greens</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 300 degrees. Combine the thyme, garlic, salt,
pepper, sugar and olive oil. Spread over the bottom of a jellyroll
pan.</TE>
<TE>   Blanch the tomatoes in boiling water 30 seconds, then remove to a
bowl of ice water. Slip off the skins and cut the tomatoes in half
lengthwise. Place cut-side down on the pan; bake until softened, 1
1/2 hours. Remove from the oven.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Use a cutter 4 1/2 inches in
diameter to cut 4 circles from the pastry. (You can also use a glass,
or cut a 4 1/2-inch circle from cardboard.) Place on a baking sheet.
Poke each a few times with a fork. Bake until golden and puffed, 12
to 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Place 4 (5-inch) squares of wax paper on a baking sheet. Place a 3
1/2-to 4-inch cake ring on each square. Using a slotted spoon, divide
the tomatoes among the rings, skinned-side down. Spread 1 tablespoon
of Pistou over each.</TE>
<TE>   Place the tomato rings in the oven and bake until heated through,
10 minutes. Top each ring with a circle of pastry. Return to the oven
and bake until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Slide a spatula under
each tart, lightly hold the top, and turn over onto the center of a
plate. Remove the wax paper and the rings (careful, they will be
hot). Serve each tart surrounded by the greens.</TE>

<LD>WALLA WALLA, Wash.--It was hard not to feel sorry for the poor vines.
Their thin trunks rose bravely from a bed of rounded cobblestones.
The rocks were hot to the touch and radiated heat up into the sparse
canopies where a few, small bunches of grapes hung. There was hardly
any soil in evidence. Looking into a nearby backhoe pit, I could see
what was under the rocks, down in the rooting zone: more rocks.</LD>
<LD>   "These vines are stressed," winemaker Christophe Baron said with
grim delight. His vineyard foreman, Ramon Alcala, nodded in
agreement.</LD>
<LD>   "They really have to struggle here," Alcala said admiringly.</LD>
<TE>   Time for a reality check. Were we in an old vineyard in the
northern Rhone, or California or Australia? No, we were in the Walla
Walla Valley, in southeast Washington. The Syrah vines around us were
planted barely five years ago, but they are already gaining fame in
the wine world for the regally dark, aromatic wines that Baron makes
from their fruit under his Cayuse Vineyards label.</TE>
<TE>   Wine has conferred a new touch of glamour on this old farming
community. Walla Walla has long been famous for its sweet onions,
along with apples, hops and the singsong name that brings out the kid
in everyone. But just in the last dozen years or so its bold Merlots
and Cabernets have become sought-after trophies for wine collectors.</TE>
<TE>   And in the last few vintages it has become evident that Syrah is
even better suited to the climate and landscape than its Bordeaux
cousins, and may well give the clearest expression yet of Walla Walla
terroir. They're already being priced at $30 to $60 a bottle,
but--for the moment, at least--they're more readily available than
the cult clarets.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in the midst of Baron's vines, I was surrounded by one of
the oddest agricultural landscapes in the country. There were plenty
of shade trees, orchards and barns--but all around the storybook farm
scene rose a fantastic landscape of tawny, purple-shaded plateaus and
cliffs that looked like the backdrop for a science-fiction movie set
in the deep Pleistocene.</TE>
<TE>   I could almost imagine that the giant pieces of farm equipment
moving through distant wheat fields were dinosaurs. But in the
foreground, that primordial illusion gave way to orderly rows of
grapevines covering pillow-like hills.</TE>
<TE>   A Fast Grower</TE>
<TE>   The modern Walla Walla wine industry is just two decades old, and
still small, but it's quickly building Napa-like momentum on the
success of producers such as Cayuse, Leonetti Cellar, Glen Fiona,
L'Ecole No. 41, Canoe Ridge, Seven Hills and Woodward Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   The first modern vineyards were planted in the mid-1970s by Gary
Figgins, whose Leonetti Cellar subsequently achieved cult-like status
with intense, structured Bordeaux-style reds. That recognition led to
the establishment of Walla Walla Valley as Washington's second
American Viticultural Area in 1984, with just four wineries and 60
acres of vines.</TE>
<TE>   The Walla Walla Valley AVA took its time developing. By 1990 there
were still only six wineries and 100 acres of vines in the valley.
But a new wave of producers arrived in force during the mid-'90s, and
within a few years there were three dozen wineries and 1,200 acres of
vines. Last year the AVA boundaries were expanded to accommodate the
rapid growth.</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of all that, Syrah made a quiet but forceful
entrance. The first Syrah was planted in '95 by Rusty Figgins (Gary's
younger brother), whose Glen Fiona winery is devoted to Rhone
varietals. Within a few years Syrah acreage surpassed every other
grape except Cabernet Sauvignon.</TE>
<TE>   Fine Southern Soil</TE>
<TE>   The best Walla Walla vineyards, such as Baron's rocky Cailloux
site and the Seven Hills Vineyard in which Figgins is a partner, are
in the lee of the Blue Mountains on the southern side of the
appellation.</TE>
<TE>   The pillowy contours in that area in part explain the distinctive
character of Walla Walla wines. They are raised beds of layered soils
deposited by repeated cataclysmic flooding over thousands of years.</TE>
<TE>   The soil components range in size from large cobbles and chunks of
lava rock, such as those in Baron's vineyard, to tiny, polished
particles so uniform in size they resemble microscopic marbles. Such
warm, well-drained soils are ideal for vines.</TE>
<TE>   Another key component is a climate of extremes. The warm, fog-free
summers discourage vine diseases, while the bitterly cold winters
keep bugs in check.</TE>
<TE>   The seasonal contrast is mirrored on a daily basis throughout the
growing season by a wide fluctuation between day and night
temperatures, which lets grapes ripen fully without losing acidity.
And the region's high latitude confers up to two hours more sunlight
each day than California vineyards get.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, eastern Washington is one of the few wine regions in the
world where wine grapes grow on their own roots. Because phylloxera
(a root-eating aphid) doesn't thrive in soils with low clay content,
Washington growers don't have to graft their vines onto resistant
rootstock.</TE>
<TE>   Whether these vines yield finer wine than grafted vines is a
perennial debate among wine lovers, but the practical advantages are
undeniable. Among other things, they bear fruit up to two years
earlier and they recover more quickly from a trauma such as hard
freezing.</TE>
<TE>   That's important, because the one serious problem faced by eastern
Washington grape growers is the periodic cold snap.</TE>
<TE>   "Our only real problem is hard winters," said Marty Clubb, L'Ecole
No. 41 partner-winemaker and a partner with Rusty Figgins in Seven
Hills Vineyard. "We don't have phylloxera or Pierce's disease, or the
other pests that plague most regions. And rainfall is low so we don't
have mildew pressure. But those subzero systems from the Arctic can
kill a lot of vines."</TE>
<TE>   Walla Walla's budding 19th century wine industry was wiped out by
a series of such freezes, and a mid-20th century revival met the same
fate in the infamous freeze of 1956.</TE>
<TE>   Another hard freeze in 1996 gave Syrah a chance to show its
Washingtonian mettle.</TE>
<TE>   "It was way below zero for five days in a row," said Clubb. "We
had to chain-saw acres of Cabernet and Merlot vines right to the
ground."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Syrah came through.</TE>
<TE>   A Real Walla Walla-ness</TE>
<TE>   The distinctive character of Walla Walla Syrah is displayed in
L'Ecole No. 41's sleek Seven Hills Vineyard '00. Its spicy perfume
and deep, juicy flavor are as impressive as the best wines from the
Rhone and South Australia, and yet there's a real Walla Walla-ness in
its balance of succulence and power.</TE>
<TE>   That succulence also informs the Glen Fiona '99, a high-toned
beauty with rich, spicy berry flavors and fine-boned structure.
Winemaker Rusty Figgins enhanced the signal tenderness by
co-fermenting with 10% Viognier.</TE>
<TE>   Other facets of that character are presented by several different
Cayuse Vineyards bottlings from Baron's nobly struggling vines. The
Cailloux Vineyard '99 ("cailloux" is French for stones; it was early
French trappers who named the area's now-vanished native tribe the
Cayuse) has a dense, heady perfume that shows the meatiness of
concentrated Syrah with amazingly crystal-clear flavors of spicy
black fruit. The Coccinelle Vineyard '99 is brighter and more floral,
with a peachy tang.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the Bionic Frog. "It was my nickname when I was
making wine in Australia," confided Baron. "That's how the Aussies
show respect when you drink them under the table." The Bionic Frog
'00, also from the Coccinelle Vineyard, is a towering Syrah with
black-rose color, deeply concentrated flavor and the warm, spicy
perfume of a Cote Rotie--with the kind of chewy tannin and structure
that Cote Rotie winemakers can only dream about.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, wines like these are just the beginning of good things to
come. But they're more than enough to send a clear challenge to
California's Rhone Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Saddle up, boys, you have some serious competition up north.</TE>

<LD>I enjoyed your article about the classic gin and tonic ("Perfection,
With a Twist of Lime," Aug. 7). I grew up in the Midwest and the
South, where the change from Bourbon and water to gin and tonic was
as much a sign of the arrival of spring as the appearance of robins
in the lawn. It was the alcoholic equivalent of being able to wear
white after Memorial Day. Here's a tip for you: Make ice cubes out of
tonic water. This prevents dilution of the drink. Be sure to let the
tonic go flat before freezing.</LD>

<TE>   I remember my dad, tan and sweaty after a day mowing our lawn,
fixing fences, trimming trees, coming into the house and mixing a
tall gin and tonic and taking it down in maybe three or four gulps.
Awwwww.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I agree with you completely about gin and tonic. It is a wonderful
drink, especially in summer. The tonic and lime cut the gin taste
down from wretched to enjoyable. It isn't a sweet drink and it slakes
the thirst and is refreshing. I prefer it made with Tanqueray. It
makes a difference--enough so that I once wrote an entire song about
it.</TE>

<TE>   As you must know, tonic water in England differs from that sold
here. The British desire a more bitter tonic water. Schweppes
probably gets the lion's share of that market.</TE>
<TE>   As to tonic water one can purchase in the United States, there is
a great difference between brands. Schweppes has a truly bitter
flavor (not as bitter as the Schweppes sold in England); many of the
other brands here are sweet, not bitter, and therefore cannot be
considered (part of) a valid gin and tonic. Most bars and restaurants
do not serve a true bitter tonic water. One must request Schweppes or
suffer a poor substitute.</TE>

<TE>   Your advice about fresh ice will be tested. One suggestion: The
way to introduce the lime for maximum effect is to cut the slice in
such a way that the ratio of skin to pulp is 1 to 1, and about the
size of a quarter. Squeeze over ice, drop the residue on the ice,
then pour the gin over the crushed, squeezed piece of lime. Finally,
swish the gin back and forth over the piece of lime. Last of all pour
in the tonic. This technique maximizes the extraction of the perfume
from the skin of the lime. The same technique should be applied to
making a genuine Cuba Libre (rum and Coke plus a slice of fresh
lime).</TE>

<TE>   Every Tuesday I have dinner with my mother. I pick a fresh lime
from the tree and prepare two gin and tonics. They are the best.

<LD>In this recipe, a bit of roasted garlic oil adds zest to grilled
chicken breasts, which are served with a flavorful cucumber relish.
Just a tablespoon of oil is used to quickly marinate the boneless,
skinless chicken, which is considerably lower in fat than dark-meat
chicken with skin.</LD>
<LD>   Garlic oil can be found with other oils at most well-stocked
supermarkets. Use it, too, to make salad dressings or other
marinades, or as a quick dipping sauce for bread. I like to brush it
on meat before barbecuing; minced garlic tends to burn and taste
bitter when grilled.</LD>

<TE>   Garlic Grilled Chicken With Cucumber Herb Relish</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes</TE>
<TE>   4 boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/2 pounds)</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon roasted garlic oil</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 lemon</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup chopped cilantro</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano leaves</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup chopped red onion</TE>
<TE>   1 small Japanese cucumber, peeled and diced</TE>
<TE>   4 Kalamata olives, coarsely chopped</TE>
<TE>   Place the chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap. Using
a kitchen mallet, lightly pound the chicken breasts, flattening to
about 1/4 inch thick. Place the chicken in a glass dish and drizzle
with the garlic oil, turning so all sides are coated. Cover and
marinate 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, heat a grill to medium-high. Grill the chicken until
browned on one side, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to
taste, turn and grill until the other side is browned and the chicken
reaches 165 degrees on a meat thermometer, another 3 to 5 minutes.
Remove to a warm platter. Squeeze the lemon half over the chicken.</TE>
<TE>   Toss together the basil, cilantro, oregano, onion, cucumber,
olives and salt to taste. Spoon the cucumber mixture over the grilled
chicken and serve.</TE>

<LD>The first time I ate a soft-shell crab was in a diner on the
Chesapeake Bay. It was deep-fried and served in a hamburger bun with
lettuce and tartar sauce. It was wonderful, but I crave a sandwich
with a little more finesse. This version, served open-faced on
toasted bread with lettuce, tomato and aioli, is a bit more
dressed-up--a sandwich for a summer evening or an elegant lunch.</LD>
<LD>   Remember that a soft-shell crab has no hard shell to crack, so
there's no need to dig out the sweet and tender meat. Just eat the
whole thing, no fuss, no muss. Serve these sandwiches with some
quickly steamed corn on the cob and fresh fruit.</LD>

<TE>   4 leaves red leaf lettuce</TE>
<TE>   1 large tomato, or 2 small</TE>
<TE>   Clean the crabs if the fishmonger didn't do so. Using scissors,
cut off 1/4 inch from below the eyes. Turn the crabs over and lift
the apron, the small piece that comes up from the bottom of the
shell, and remove. Turn over, and open the top shell from each side
and remove the gills. Rinse and pat dry.</TE>
<TE>   Whisk the yolk in a bowl until fluffy. Whisk in the lemon juice,
then add 1/2 teaspoon of salt, then whisk in the garlic. Slowly
drizzle in the oil. Refrigerate the aioli until ready to use.</TE>
<TE>   Mix the flour, Old Bay seasoning, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of
salt and pepper to taste in a shallow dish. Lightly dredge the crabs
in the mixture.</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the crabs
and cook until they've turned pink, about 3 to 4 minutes, then turn
and cook another 3 to 4 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, toast the bread. Place 1 slice on each of 4 plates.
Spread lightly with the aioli. Place a lettuce leaf and tomato slice
on top of each slice. Place a crab on top of each sandwich, then add
1 tablespoon of aioli to each. Use the remaining aioli for another
use, or pass at the table.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: My friend Jane, 94, fondly remembers moist molasses cookies
from her childhood called Cry Babies. She thinks they were called
that because after tasting them, people always cried for more. She
lost the recipe she got from her father, who got it from the
cafeteria of the company where he worked between about 1910 and 1920.
I would be grateful if you could find the recipe, and so would Jane.</LD>
<LD>   ELISABETH MacCURDY</LD>
<LD>   Sierra Madre</LD>
<TE>   DEAR ELISABETH: We found several recipes for Cry Babies, each
slightly different. This recipe is from the Web site all recipes.com,
modified slightly by the Times Test Kitchen to meet Jane's
specifications. These old-fashioned cookies are delicate, so don't
over-bake them. They're as fragile as, well, crybabies.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>DEAR SOS: Help! A few years back the L.A. Times printed a recipe for
blackberry cobbler. It was very simple, and the biscuit topping
called for half-and-half.</LD>
<LD>   STEFFANIE COHEN</LD>
<LD>   Altadena</LD>
<TE>   DEAR STEFFANIE: This recipe is from a story by Schuyler Ingle that
ran in June of 1993. A variety of summer berries could be used in
place of blackberries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Blackberry Cobbler</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes</TE>
<TE>   4 cups blackberries</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups flour</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons baking powder</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup butter, diced</TE>
<TE>   1 cup half-and-half</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 425 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Place the blackberries in a deep-dish pie plate (at least 3 inches
deep). A deep pie dish will prevent the berry juices from overflowing
in the oven. Sprinkle the berries with 1/2 cup of the sugar.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the flour, baking powder and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a
bowl. With your fingertips, blend in the butter completely. Stir in
the half-and-half, being careful not to over-mix. Spoon the topping
over the berries, not quite covering completely. Sprinkle with the
remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar.</TE>
<TE>   Bake until golden brown on top, 30 minutes. Cool the cobbler on a
wire rack.</TE>
<TE>   4 to 6 servings. Each of 6 servings: 419 calories; 272 mg sodium;

<HD>Kitchen Tip: Why We Dissolve Soda in Coffee</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christy Hedges</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When we first tested Cry Baby cookie recipes, we wound up with flat
cookies that were torn and had holes. We tried several different
recipes, then realized the secret to perfect cookies was an
old-fashioned technique--dissolving the baking soda in the coffee,
rather than combining it with the other dry ingredients.</LD>
<LD>   Baking soda must be activated by the presence of an acid and a
liquid. Doing this kick-starts the soda into action and affects the
structure of the final cookie. When we used the soda-coffee trick,
the cookies held together nicely after baking, and the activated soda
made the cookies rise just a bit faster. We found the final cookies
to be crisp on the edges, yet moist in the middle.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This is a handy little gadget to have in the kitchen when you need to
slice tomatoes thinly for sandwiches or salads. We found that the
serrated blades on this slicer easily cut through a tomato. The
slicer works best with larger tomatoes; it can be a little difficult
to hold a small tomato while trying to slice it. The ergonomic soft
handle is nice to hold and is dishwasher safe.</LD>

<KH>Cook's Walk</KH>
<HD>The Capital of Koreatown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The splashy new Koreatown Galleria stands like a beacon signaling the
entry to the heart of the Korean community in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   This $33-million shopping plaza at Olympic Boulevard and Western
Avenue gives perspective to what has been, for the most part, an
undefined collection of mom-and-pop businesses along Olympic from
Crenshaw Boulevard east to the 110 Freeway. The Galleria captures it
all--shops, a market, bakeries and restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   Glossy, stylish and stimulating, it's the kind of invitation to
Koreatown that could well make this area so rich in cuisine the kind
of destination neighborhood it always should have been. The basement
houses a cookware store and bulk-food warehouse. The ground floor
contains a vast supermarket and two excellent bakeries. Fine china
and crystal are on the second floor. And the third lures hungry
shoppers with a coffeehouse and a food gallery that includes 11
restaurants.</LD>
<TE>   The range of food is astonishing. In addition to barbecued meats,
dumplings and other Korean dishes, there are sushi and sashimi,
pastries and exquisite European-style cakes--even hot dogs and French
fries. Vietnamese pho, Japanese udon, Korean-style Chinese food,
espresso and cappuccino, they're all here too.</TE>
<TE>   The Galleria is a grand space, filled with light on the upper
levels from a soaring atrium roof. Shops on the second floor are
arranged around a courtyard where a fountain splashes and palm trees
grow in marble-walled beds. The food gallery above offers seating
inside or on an open-air patio surrounded by a garden.</TE>
<TE>   Allen H. Park, the managing director, chose food purveyors on the
basis of experience and reputation. For example, Kang Seo Myun Oak, a
restaurant in the food gallery, originated in Seoul and has another
branch in Koreatown. It specializes in the cold noodle soup
naengmyon, a favorite in hot weather. The owners of Jin Heung Ghak, a
Chinese restaurant, serve the same food at the Mandarin House on West
8th Street. Mannaria restaurant borrows recipes from Dong Il Jang, an
8th Street institution.</TE>
<TE>   The Galleria, financed by a partnership of seven Korean Americans,
opened in October. The structure expresses community and national
pride. Visitors entering from Olympic Boulevard see a free-form image
of the rose of Sharon hibiscus in the marble floor. This is the
Galleria's logo, and South Korea's national flower.</TE>
<TE>   Hours are long, 7 a.m. to midnight daily. The market is open those
hours; other shops open later, and the restaurants start up around 10
a.m. By lunchtime, customers are lined up for bibim bap, kimchi fried
rice, hand-pulled noodles, spicy seafood stews, chicken teriyaki,
broiled fish, boba drinks, shaved ice concoctions and much more.</TE>
<TE>   "Seventy [percent] to 80% of our customers are Korean, but I am
starting to see more of the non-Korean community, more of a balance,"
says Jinah Kim of the Tofu House. The supermarket especially attracts
a diverse crowd because it offers a wide assortment of fresh produce
at reasonable prices.</TE>
<TE>   Park says Westsiders spot the Galleria on the way to Staples
Center, then come back. One such visitor was eager to try kimchi
pizza, advertised on a menu board along with kimchi paella, kimchi
falafel and other startling concoctions.</TE>
<TE>   The only problem is, there are no such dishes. The menu, hung high
in the food gallery, is merely artwork. But when you think about it,
kimchi pizza might not be such a bad idea.</TE>
<TE>   Third Floor: Restaurants</TE>
<TE>   Start a Galleria tour on the top level, with a visit to the Food
Gallery.</TE>
<TE>   Begin on the east side with Jin Heung Ghak Mandarin Cuisine, where
you can eat inside, rather than carrying a tray to the broad expanse
of tables where most people sit. Here, the food is Chinese with a
Korean twist. The most popular dishes are chow mein and chachiang
mein, which is no surprise. The noodles (mein) are handmade, silky
and fresh.</TE>
<TE>   The noodles for chachiang mein are topped with meat or seafood
(shrimp, squid and sea cucumber) in a black bean sauce. You won't
find anything quite like it in Chinatown, insist the owners, Hsien
Chien Ho, who is Chinese born in Korea, and his Korean wife, Joanna.
Packets of their salty, slightly sweet black bean sauce are on sale in the
Galleria Market in the hot foods case.  Take one home to heat and serve
over noodles or rice.</TE>
<TE>   Bopioca, a drink and dessert stall, is attached to Jin Heung Ghak.
Stop here for early-morning coffee, or order a smoothie, boba drink
or shaved ice dessert. Bopioca's toppings for shaved ice, a dessert
popular from Indonesia to Taiwan, include taro, sweet potato, rice
balls, lotus seeds, lychees, pineapple and red beans.</TE>
<TE>   Tofu lovers will relish the wide assortment of dishes at the Tofu
House. The big seller is a soupy dish of soft tofu, beef broth and
meat or seafood known as soon tofu. Red bean paste stew combines
bland tofu pieces with intensely spicy red broth. In sharp contrast
to these spicy dishes is a cold soup of noodles in a delicate "broth"
of freshly ground soybeans, peanuts and sesame seeds.</TE>
<TE>   You might see college students or Korean women on a shopping spree
snacking on rice cakes in hot red pepper paste, one of the items
you'll find at Cham Cham Cham. There's a picture menu, but no
information in English, so you'll have to ask what the dishes are.
Choices include rice noodles with hot pepper sauce, cabbage, cucumber
and bean sprouts and cold radish broth with noodles, tomatoes, chiles
and green onions.</TE>
<TE>   The specialty at Kang Seo Myun Oak is naengmyon, a big bowl of
cold, slightly sweet broth that contains skinny buckwheat noodles,
hard-cooked egg, a translucent slice of Asian pear and a few slices
of beef, daikon and cucumber. Tiny cups of rice vinegar and hot
mustard are just enough seasoning. The taste is light and addictive,
unlike any noodle soup you may have had.</TE>
<TE>   Yang Ji Express is known for bibim bap--rice tossed with more than
20 toppings of your choosing. Or let the attendant mix in a little of
everything. Broth and a plate of kimchi come with the rice, so you
get plenty to eat.</TE>
<TE>   In a corner next to Yang Ji, Jin Su Sung Chan serves the one
Korean dish that everyone knows: barbecued meat. In addition to short
ribs, beef and spicy seasoned pork, the cooks barbecue chicken and
shrimp. If you want to branch out, try spicy black cod, short ribs
soup, a seafood pancake or spicy octopus. The name of the stall is
not in English, but the photo menu provides translations.</TE>
<TE>   At Kal Gook Soo, there is chicken ginseng soup, a fascinating dish
that includes chestnuts and jujubes (wrinkly red dates, not the
candy), as well as handmade noodles in soup, dumplings, Korean sushi
and soft rice with abalone. Look at the photos on the wall, then
decide what to eat.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Lee, who runs Mannaria, is the sister of Sung Kim, the owner
of Dong Il Jang, one of the oldest restaurants in Koreatown. She uses
some of her brother's recipes, so you'll find kimichi fried rice here
as well as chicken and beef teriyaki, spicy rice cakes, cold soba
and, for those with really exotic tastes, hamburger steak.</TE>
<TE>   What is a Vietnamese restaurant doing in Koreatown?</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, pho is very popular in Korea," says Justin Yoo, whose
Miss Pho Saigon specializes in the Vietnamese noodle soup. His most
complex version is pho Saigon, which contains brisket, flank and rare
steak, fish cake, beef and fish balls, squid, shrimp, book tripe,
tendon, onions, jalapenos, bean sprouts, basil, cilantro and a lime
wedge.</TE>
<TE>   Opposite the food gallery is the  Sejong Book Store, which deals
in Korean-language books, but has a few cookbooks in English. A good
choice for western cooks is "A Korean Mother's Cooking Notes" by
Chang Sun-Young. It's addressed to young Korean women (specifically,
her sons' wives), learning to cook traditional food in the United
States. The publisher is Ewha Woman's University in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   From the bookshop, walk into Cafe Galleria, which has a long menu
of coffees, teas, fancy drinks, juices and other treats. Don't expect
coffee in an ordinary mug. The cafe has a stunning collection of cups
in colorful patterns. If you approach from the Galleria rather than
the bookstore, you will see the almost-real array of French crepes
arranged like a menu in the window. Most are sweet, topped with
fruits and sweet whipped cream or ice cream. They have names like
Alsace, Bordeaux, Bretagne, Versailles and Nice. One topped with
kiwifruit is a digestif.</TE>
<TE>   Second Floor: Tableware</TE>
<TE>   This is mostly the domain of clothing and cosmetics. But there is
one store for the cook: the Silver Spoon Collection, a shop that
displays Waterford crystal and dinnerware from Wedgwood, Limoges,
Villeroy &amp; Boch, Royal Copenhagen and other prestige companies.
Interestingly, there's nothing from South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   First Floor: The Market</TE>
<TE>   Many people come to the Galleria just to shop in the supermarket.
This vast Galleria Market has everything needed for Korean cooking as
well as general merchandise, prepared foods and Korean-style packaged
convenience foods. A large section is devoted to panchan, the side
dishes served with Korean meals in restaurants. A hot-foods case is
filled with dishes ready for dinner, including soups, cooked
vegetables, fish and Korean sausages, even rice--either plain steamed
white rice or brown rice with beans. On the other side is a case of
sushi, followed by shelves of kimchi.</TE>
<TE>   The produce section is stocked with Korean greens such as ssukkat,
sesame and minari leaves, bags of soy sprouts, twist chiles and fat
Korean zucchini. Seasonal fruit is stocked in abundance and sometimes
cut for sampling.</TE>
<TE>   The meat department offers marinated meats for barbecuing and many
brands of Korean barbecue sauce. Look also for bulky packages of fish
or crab soup mix that contain fish, seafood, noodles and vegetables,
ready to dump into a pot of boiling water. Trays of sashimi
decorative enough to take to a party are also in this area.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the Galleria Market are a couple of interesting food shops.</TE>
<TE>   Near the checkout stands is Long Life Foods Tofu,  which sells
prepared dishes with tofu, including a silky tofu salad that has
converted at least one tofu-hater into a fan. This shop produces its
own tofu, which you can buy in packages to use at home. The other
shop, Koko's Chicken, makes hot dogs and fries, and two traditional
Korean snacks: fish-shaped cakes stuffed with red beans (watch as
they are baked in heavy black molds in the window), and pancakes
filled with melted sugar that are so irresistible, you won't be able
to stop at one.</TE>
<TE>   Near the market you'll find Wien Konditorei und Cafe, which sells
European-style cakes, cookies, sweet rolls and breads, some with a
Korean touch such as almond-sprinkled loaves filled with diced
chestnuts. Milk baguettes are sliced and coated with butter and
sugar, ready for snacking.</TE>
<TE>   Wien's cakes are glorious, and you can buy them by the slice or
whole. The eye-catching cakes coated with large, swirled tufts of
white frosting are white or chocolate chiffon. Golden ribbons are
tied around cheesecakes. Strawberries dusted with sugar and little
mounds of meringue finish off a cream cake.</TE>
<TE>   Small treats include little oval plastic containers that hold a
saucy rendition of tiramisu. Wien makes crisp, golden almond tuiles
that go well with coffee, which the shop also sells. Conveniently,
there's a line of tables and chairs just outside.</TE>
<TE>   The grandmotherly woman whose image is the logo for Ho Won Dang is
Jah Ho Cho, who founded the rice cake shop in Seoul in 1953. A son,
Un-hee Chung, owns this shop, which produces rice cakes and cookies
for ceremonies and celebrations. Tiny yellow cookies to go with tea
are naturally colored with pine tree pollen. Crushed pine nuts coat
crisp, fried cookies. Small round rice cakes are filled with fresh
grapes, chestnuts, grapefruit segments or cherries. Deep-fried,
syrup-soaked cookies contain a tiny, tantalizing shred of citrus
peel.</TE>
<TE>   Buy an assortment and the shop will pack them in a gift box,
wrapped in a large square of peach fabric tied in a fluffy bow.</TE>
<TE>   In a refrigerated case, Ho Won Dang displays jars of omijah
concentrate to dilute for a sweet tart pink drink. Omijah is a rare
red fruit that grows in high, cold parts of Korea. Chung's farm
produces most of the Korean crop.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the shops in the Galleria, this one is the most
traditional. Its woodsy look transports you to times long past in a
faraway land.</TE>
<TE>   Basement: Housewares</TE>
<TE>   Stairs or an elevator will take you to the basement and
KitchenPlus, Inc., a housewares shop that caters mainly to
restaurants. However, home cooks will find plenty to buy, including
South Korean-made plates and bowls, woks, skillets, bulgogi grills
and sets of metal chopsticks and long-handled spoons. Notice the
50-bowl rice cookers, the bright-green $349 garlic slicer and the
wooden trays for sashimi that are shaped like bridges.</TE>
<TE>   On the way home, stop back to the market level for
Galleria Flowers, where you can order a table centerpiece. In addition to
fresh flowers, the shop displays containers of lucky bamboo and
unusual artificial arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   As you leave, you will pass Jungle Juice, a drive-up stand where
you can order a coffee or juice drink for the road.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are recipes you dabble with, trying them once before moving on
to others. Then there are the ones that stick with you, that become
part of your everyday repertoire. They don't need to be especially
fancy--in fact, usually they're not. More often, they're simple
things that teach you a new technique or show you another face of a
familiar ingredient.</LD>
<LD>   The most recent example of this for me was Gazpacho Hoy from Janet
Mendel's new book, "My Kitchen in Spain" (HarperCollins, $34.95).
Gazpacho is one of those dishes I've never really "gotten"--is it a
soup? Is it a salsa? And what's with all that chopping? But Mendel's
version is so simple to prepare, yet so satisfying, that I know it is
one I will be making over and over.</LD>
<LD>   Here's how it goes: Puree garlic and bread you've soaked in water.
Add chopped tomatoes and a little cumin and puree again, adding olive
oil, a little vinegar and water. Now take your afternoon nap while it
chills in the refrigerator. When you wake up, you'll have one of the
best cold soups you've ever tasted.</LD>
<TE>   What's that, you say? No cucumbers, no bell peppers, no
meticulously minced everything? You can do all that stuff if you
want, and serve it as a garnish, but it's not necessary. The depth
and complexity of flavor of the basic recipe is astonishing--provided
you use good tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   This recipe is typical of the rest of the book, at least in
approach. Take basic ingredients and cook them simply but with
imagination. Mendel builds complexity not through the layering of
many flavors but through the careful use of a very few. There's only
one-fourth teaspoon of cumin in the gazpacho, and you certainly won't
taste it for itself. But it is just enough to add a certain earthy
bottom note to the sweetness of the tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   The use of bread as a thickener is repeated in other recipes as
well. With the gazpacho, it adds a creamy texture as well as
softening the bite of the raw garlic a bit. It does much the same
thing in the green beans with garlic sauce, another extremely simple
dish that will probably wind up on my table again. In this one,
blanched green beans are sauteed in olive oil with red pepper strips,
then the whole thing is lightly bound by further cooking with bread
softened in vinegar and pureed with garlic and some of the liquid
from the green beans. Just a dash of pimenton is the "complexer" this
time.</TE>
<TE>   Other recipes I tested were successful, though less world-shaking.
I was pleased that the Basque red bean stew called for cooking the
beans without pre-soaking--something I've long advocated. And I was
interested in the technique of "scaring" the beans periodically,
slowing down the cooking with occasional additions of cold water. The
texture of the beans was perfect, and the flavor was good (well, with
chorizo, ham hock and beans, how could it not be?). But I did find
that the dish needed a little vinegar at the end to really lift the
flavor.</TE>
<TE>   As you probably can tell from the descriptions, these are not
fancy dishes and neither do they go overboard in the quest for
authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the ingredients called for can be found in any
supermarket. Rather, this is exactly what the title implies:
real-world food from a very talented cook.</TE>
<TE>   And you'll probably find, as I did, that not a few of the dishes
from her Spanish kitchen wind up as regular visitors to yours.</TE>

<TE>   (Tumbet Balear)</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 45 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 15
minutes * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for preparing pan</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon fine dry bread crumbs</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups diced tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon crumbled dried basil</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   3 teaspoons salt, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds boiling potatoes, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds zucchini, cut in 1/4-inch slices</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, sliced</TE>
<TE>   4 eggs, beaten with 1 tablespoon water</TE>
<TE>   1 red bell pepper, roasted, peeled and cut into strips</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Oil a 13-by-9-inch baking pan or
casserole and dust with the bread crumbs.</TE>
<TE>   Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a saucepan over medium heat and
add the tomatoes, basil, sugar and 1 teaspoon of the salt. Cook the
tomatoes until the liquid is reduced, 10 minutes. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   In a large skillet, heat the remaining 1/4 cup of oil and fry the
potato slices slowly, turning to cook evenly, until they are
fork-tender, about 15 minutes. They do not need to brown. Sprinkle
the potatoes with 1 teaspoon of the salt while they are cooking.
Remove the potatoes from the skillet and spread in the bottom of the
baking pan.</TE>
<TE>   Add the zucchini and onion to the oil remaining in the skillet and
cook over medium heat until the zucchini is fork-tender, about 10
minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt.</TE>
<TE>   Pour a quarter of the beaten eggs over the potatoes. Spread the
zucchini and onion over the potatoes. Add another quarter of the
eggs. Lay strips of roasted pepper over the zucchini and pour a
quarter of the eggs over. Top with the tomato sauce. Pour the
remaining egg over the casserole.</TE>
<TE>   Bake 25 minutes. Let set for 5 minutes before serving.</TE>

<TE>   Today's Gazpacho (Gazpacho Hoy)</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1  1/2
hours, plus 1 hour chilling</TE>
<TE>   4 ounces (about 4 slices) stale bread, crusts removed</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic</TE>
<TE>   2 pounds tomatoes, seeded and coarsely chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 (2-inch-square) piece green bell pepper, optional</TE>
<TE>   1 (2-inch) chunk peeled cucumber, optional</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon ground cumin</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons salt</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup olive oil, preferably extra-virgin</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups water</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup chopped green bell pepper, for optional garnish</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup chopped white onion, for optional garnish</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup peeled, chopped cucumber, for optional garnish</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup croutons or diced bread, toasted crisp, for optional
garnish</TE>
<TE>   Break the bread into big chunks and soak it in water to cover
until it is softened, about 15 minutes. Squeeze out the excess water
and place the bread in a blender or food processor with the garlic.
Blend until the bread and garlic are smooth, scraping down the sides
as necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Add the tomatoes (it may be necessary to process the tomatoes in 2
batches) and the pieces of pepper and cucumber, if using, and puree.
Add the cumin and salt. With the blender on, add the olive oil in a
slow stream. As the oil is incorporated, the gazpacho will turn from
tomato-juice red to a paler, orange color. Blend in the vinegar and
enough water to make the desired thickness.</TE>
<TE>   Place the gazpacho into a tureen, bowl or pitcher and chill until
serving time.</TE>
<TE>   Place each of the garnishes--chopped peppers, onion, cucumber and
croutons--in small bowls or on a relish dish and pass them when the
gazpacho is served. This gazpacho also can be served, thinned with
additional water, in tall glasses for sipping, without the garnishes.</TE>

Ground Zero</HD>

<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William Langewiesche was in Europe writing a meticulously reported
narrative about the crash of Egypt Air Flight 990 when his editor at
the Atlantic Monthly called. Turn on the TV, he said.</LD>
<LD>   The World Trade Center had been hit. The United States was under
attack.</LD>
<LD>   Langewiesche was on the first plane headed for New York. He turned
the Egypt Air piece around in three days, after grappling with it for
six months. (It later won the prestigious 2002 National Magazine
Award for reporting.) Langewiesche, a seasoned foreign correspondent
who has spent time in the world's hell holes reporting for the
Atlantic, initially didn't know if the story was in Afghanistan or
New York. Ground zero was preferable, but to get that story, he
needed unfettered access to the site. He went to the police station
where press credentials were distributed, but he didn't feel
comfortable in the herd of newspaper and TV reporters. Getting lumped
in with them meant minimal access to the site.</LD>
<TE>   He left the police station, figuring he was headed for
Afghanistan. As he was walking away, he noticed a sign on the heavy
equipment for the city Department of Design and Construction. On a
whim, he faxed its commissioner a letter asking for access to the
site.</TE>
<TE>   It was granted. Langewiesche subsequently turned nine months of
reporting at Ground zero into a three-part series for the Atlantic
about the psychology of the site. The second installment of "American
Ground: Unbuilding the World Trade Center" arrived at newsstands
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   This series, which will be turned into a book, is an extraordinary
feat of journalism. Langewiesche chronicles the painstaking cleanup
process and the unexpected figures who became leaders there. He spent
every day at the site for six months, living in a dingy hotel in
Greenwich Village; the last three months he visited it occasionally.
He had access to private meetings, people and paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a photographer, and I'm not even a daily newspaper
writer," says Langewiesche. "Going in one time meant nothing. During
the [initial] walk I took there, it was very obvious to me that the
volunteer efforts underway ... were of no particular help to the
situation, as much as they were heartfelt. It was obvious to me that
heavy equipment was the story."</TE>
<TE>   Even for someone who has established a reputation for exhaustively
researched narratives, this one rises to a new level. With
excruciating detail, Langewiesche deconstructs the site and the
cleanup. In one account, he describes the PATH system (a commuter
line from New Jersey) and the possibility that the destruction of the
World Trader Center, which sat above one of the train stations, could
have led to flooding of much of the city's subway system. He takes
readers underground as he accompanies a crew through a treacherous
obstacle course to see if Freon is leaking into the city.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, Langewiesche's superb writing is evident: "For 30
years the Twin Towers had stood above the streets as all tall
buildings do, as a bomb of sorts, a repository for the prodigious
energy originally required to raise so much weight so high,"
Langewiesche writes. "Now, in a single morning, in twin 10-second
pulses, the towers released that energy back into New York."</TE>
<TE>   Part Two, "The Rush to Recover," describes the early weeks and
people who took over the cleanup and recovery. The final installment,
"The Dance of Dinosaurs," examines the conflicts that erupted and the
effect of the word "hero." It's due to hit newsstands in
mid-September.</TE>

<LD>"If you want to get wet, stand here," yells Dinah Weldon, counselor
supervisor at Camp Max Straus &amp; Jewish Big Brothers. She sprays into
the air with a green garden hose and about 10 young boys scamper into
the downpour she has created. "Can you do it one more time?" asks
one. "Wash my head," says another, yanking off his baseball cap and
tipping his head forward. Another just opens up his arms and yells,
"Yeah, baby, it's raining!"</LD>
<LD>   When girl campers approaches, they are hesitant about running into
the spray. They've just returned from practicing karaoke, where they
fine-tuned Britney Spears' "Oops, I Did It Again" and are engaged in
an argument about whether their cabin group name is the Powhatan
Princesses or just the Powhatans.</LD>
<LD>   "We are princesses," insists 10-year-old Jo'na Patterson, a Times
fund camper whose big brown eyes peek out from under a baseball cap.
"If you don't want to think of yourself as a princess, that's fine,
but I do." Her friend throws a hand on her hip and says, "You're not
a princess, you're a headache!"</LD>
<TE>   Camp director Gabby Leon doesn't blink at the commotion; getting
kids accustomed to working as a group is one of the camp's goals. "A
lot of our kids might have difficulty in group situations, so we tend
to give the entire group tasks to solve," he says. "Rather than
competitions, they have to work together."</TE>
<TE>   And sure enough, soon the girls are trying to find out what to do
with a lizard they caught and, more important, what to name it.
"Powhatan Princess!" rumbles through the crowd (spearheaded by
Jo'na), which is soon countered with "Speedy." Camp counselor Andie
Birdsell puts it to a vote, and the matter is settled.</TE>
<TE>   "Speedy," she says firmly, walking them off to their next
activity. "But its middle and last names are Powhatan Princess."</TE>
<TE>   Farther up the wood-chip trail, which winds through 112 acres of
rustic land near the Verdugo mountains, another group emerges from
the pool. With the scent of chlorine and sunscreen hanging in the
air, Maria Magadan, a 10-year-old from Long Beach, towels off with
her friends. "It is nice here," she says. "You are not afraid here to
be changing in front of others because they won't judge," says the
fifth-grader, nodding toward the rooms where her cabin mates are
putting on their street clothes. "Where I go to the pool at home,
they talk about people in the locker room. It's bad."</TE>
<TE>   The older campers seem to be most affected by camp and the
opportunity it gives them to relax and let down their guard. When the
bus comes to take them home, they're the last to get on. "The
12-year-old guys will all be in a huddle and will start to cry
because they don't want to leave that moment," said Weldon. Camp
counselor Sergio Amador nodded, adding, "They are such tough guys at
that age, then two seconds later they are crying. We try to make them
feel happy that they had such a good time and are feeling so much."</TE>
<TE>   Every year since 1954, readers and employees of The Times have
sent thousands of needy children to summer camp. This year more than
11,000 children will experience a special summer thanks to the $1.6
million raised last year.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of sending a child to camp for a week is $150.
This year, the McCormick Tribune Foundation will match the first $1.2
million in contributions at 50 cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Checks should be sent to: L.A. Times Summer Camp Campaign, File

<DH>At Centro Shalom, one social worker with a team of
volunteers battles hunger, eviction and immigration quandaries every
day</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Social worker Amelia Nieto's workday begins with a prayer. Standing
in a circle with the small army of volunteers at her Centro Shalom
office in east Long Beach, she asks, "Please grant us the wisdom to
give our people the relief they need."</LD>
<LD>   Then she takes her seat at a cluttered desk, surrounded by ringing
phones, squalling babies and impoverished clients chattering in
Spanish, Chinese, Cambodian and English.</LD>
<LD>   Some come seeking donations of clothing or food. Others arrive
with pressing legal problems: child-custody complaints, eviction
notices, immigration disputes, lawsuits involving traffic accidents.</LD>
<TE>   Hoping to avoid going into a foster care program, a young girl and
her sister whose mother is dying have asked for help in finding a new
home. Residents of a housing project are pleading for assistance in
ridding their units of gang members.</TE>
<TE>   Nibbling on tortilla chips while studying the fine print of a
client's disputed rental contract, Nieto said, "Our clients were
dealt lousy hands in life but can't afford lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not attorneys," she said. "But we help them with their
basic needs and to fill out forms and to connect them with the right
people, offices and agencies."</TE>
<TE>   Some would call that an understatement.</TE>
<TE>   Each day, the 25-year-old agency founded by her mother, Olivia
Herrera, feeds 165 people, hands out 200 pieces of clothing and
assists at least a dozen clients with legal problems. It also
sponsors a variety of neighboring programs, including a self-esteem
class for women.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, when local utility rates soared so high that some
residents began forsaking their gas stoves, washing machines and
daily showers, Centro Shalom started loaning out microwaves because
cooking with the electrical appliances was cheaper than using gas
stoves.</TE>
<TE>   All this, with 40 committed volunteers, including Nieto's
88-year-old grandmother, Trini Alvillar, and a daily cash expenditure
of about $95.</TE>
<TE>   By 3 p.m. one Friday, the line of people waiting to see Nieto and
her assistants still stretched out the door and onto the sidewalk
fronting bustling Anaheim Street.</TE>
<TE>   Surveying the afternoon workload, Nieto just smiled and said, "I
love my job. I'm where I'm supposed to be."</TE>

<DL>PASO ROBLES, Calif.</DL>
<LD>When we finally reach the vacation cabin by the lake--looking like
nine dusty characters from a Steinbeck novel, complete with our dusty
dog, Lucky--it is late in the day and I am walking funny from sitting
on a wad of vacation cash for five hours, which has deadened many of
my walking muscles. Limping, already. Like a fullback in the fourth
quarter.</LD>
<LD>   "OK, everybody grab a suitcase," I say.</LD>
<LD>   And the kids look at me like I just ordered them to dig a well.</LD>
<TE>   Work? You can see it in their eyes. Us? We're kids, for crying out
loud. Just look at us. Not a muscle among us.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, you," I say.</TE>
<TE>   And they groan and whimper as they drag their bags into the cabin.
Thirty feet. Forty feet. Down stairs. Up stairs. It's not easy, being
a kid today. Sometimes, you have to carry stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad, can you help me?" asks the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "You're Hercules," I say. "You can do it."</TE>
<TE>   "No, I'm not."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, you are," I say. "You're Hercules."</TE>
<TE>   "Jeeesh," she says, a French expression she picked up from her
mother.</TE>
<TE>   Family vacations are not for wimps. First, there was the car trip
itself, which went rather well, except for a little while when the
other family on the trip thought we were hopelessly lost. We circled
and circled in cars packed tight with vacation junk. Sardines travel
more comfortably. Canned and oiled.</TE>
<TE>   Then there were the occasional, random sightseeing stops,
something a father has no control over. A dad spots something
fascinating, he just has to share it with others.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad, what are we doing?" one of the kids asks.</TE>
<TE>   "This," I say, "is the exact spot where James Dean died."</TE>
<TE>   "Who?"</TE>
<TE>   "James somebody," says the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "Who?"</TE>
<TE>   "James Bond," says the boy.</TE>
<TE>   We stand staring at the monument to James Dean. We're in
California's midsection, dry and hot as the devil's ashtray. One of
the letters in Dean's name is missing from the memorial. Jame Dean,
it reads. Rebel without an "s."</TE>
<TE>   "Who's Jame Dean?" the boy asks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's supposed to be James," I explain.</TE>
<TE>   "Who?" asks the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "A famous actor," says my older daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "Dead," adds the boy.</TE>
<TE>   There's a long pause as they absorb it all. Cars zoom by on Route
46, the road that claimed Dean. Not much wider than a strip of
celluloid.</TE>
<TE>   "The history of American movies changed right here," I say. "Right
where you're standing."</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," says the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah wow," says her mom.</TE>
<TE>   So we pile back into the cars, our hearty tribe of summer
travelers, sitting shoulder to shoulder, nerve ending to nerve
ending, till we reach this beautiful lake, winking at us in the
August sun.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a nice lake," says the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, everybody grab a suitcase," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to our little cabin, and the unloading of the
luggage. A ceremony, really. One of the early stages of the car-trip
decathlon.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a spider on my bed," my older daughter yells.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a cricket in the kitchen," the boys says. "A live
cricket."</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, we're in the right place," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Yep, couldn't be more right, this little place on the edge of a
lake. Couple of barbecues on the wood deck. Twelve-pack in the
fridge. Cricket in the kitchen. A live one. Couldn't be better.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad, we're walking down to the lake," the boy says, and he and a
buddy head for the water.</TE>
<TE>   The lake. Few words resonate so much. Few things represent idle
time and summer as well. The lake. Lord, I love this lake.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's to our vacation," says my friend Chris, whose family is
vacationing with us.</TE>
<TE>   "We should see about a boat," I say.</TE>
<TE>   So we head to the marina, where they rent boats for about a
hundred bucks a minute, which isn't bad if you've ever owned a boat.
Even at a hundred bucks a minute, renting is far cheaper than
actually owning one.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't include gas," the marina guy explains.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course not," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Here at Lake Nacimiento, they have a good selection of boats to
choose from. Sleek ski boats. Kayaks. Pontoon boats too, the
flat-decked party barges your Uncle Bob used to own.</TE>
<TE>   I'm strangely attracted to these pontoon boats, with their
trailer-park aluminum awnings and roomy, cushioned seating. They are
the gangly ugly ducklings of the boating world, the kind of boat
Picasso would've designed.</TE>
<TE>   "I have one available tomorrow," the marina guy says.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll take it," I say.</TE>
<TE>   In the evening, we head over to the California Mid-State Fair,
which is in its final day. Nothing to sneeze at, this fair, except,
of course, for the various animal aromas. Sheryl Crow was performing
here earlier in the week, as were Alicia Keyes and Train. They are
gone. Instead, we have monster truck rallies and some singer named
Steve Holy.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad, I'm not going to watch monster trucks," my older daughter
says. "Seriously."</TE>
<TE>   "Your mom really wants to go," I explain.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom would never go to that," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "She wouldn't?"</TE>
<TE>   "Of course not," says my daughter.</TE>
<TE>   So instead we see Steve Holy, a country singer of some promise who
puts on a fine show before a few hundred folks, all of whom seem to
know who he is.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because my name is Holy doesn't mean I'm here to preach to
you," he jests.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy's pretty funny," I whisper to my wife.</TE>
<TE>   "Can we go now?" someone says a little too loud.</TE>
<TE>   "After the next song," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Back home, we sit around the cabin looking at each other.
Mercifully, the TV doesn't work. There's a deck of cards. An old
Monopoly game. A stack of Reader's Digests. In the kitchen, the
cricket chirps.</TE>
<TE>   "This baby keeps kicking," says my wife, profoundly pregnant atop
the couch.</TE>
<TE>   "You OK?"</TE>
<TE>   "All the driving around, all the activity," she says, rubbing her
tummy like a crystal ball. "This baby doesn't know what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh baby," coos the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   Between card games, the other kids stop by the couch, one by one,
to say hello. The boy gently rubs his mom's pregnant tummy.</TE>
<TE>   "Noogie-noogie-noogie," he says, gently rubbing his mother's belly
with his knuckles. "Baby's first noogie."</TE>
<TE>   "Jeeesh," says his mom.</TE>
<TE>   For a few minutes, we make womb jokes. Go to your womb. Womb for
rent. Womb with a view.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a comfortable womb," I say. "A little dark."</TE>
<TE>   "The Viper Womb," says my buddy Chris.</TE>
<TE>   Lord, I love this lake.</TE>
<TE>   Next week: A run-in with the ranger.</TE>

<HD>Summer in the City--a Simmering Mix of Scents and
Sensations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>That nobody walks in L.A. is one of the great lies of the 20th
century, equal to "there is no such thing as global warming" in
obvious ridiculousness if not international import. Of course people
walk in L.A.. All you have to do is try to make a left-hand turn in
this town and suddenly the crosswalk is crawling with people
seemingly unaware that when the "Don't Walk" sign flashes, they're
supposed to stay on the curb. Instead, these scofflaw pedestrians
give you dirty looks as you try to nose your way into a perfectly
legal turn while behind you rise the impatient horn stylings of three
drivers who don't understand that there are people walking in front
of you and that it's illegal to run them down.</LD>
<LD>   If only nobody walked in L.A.</LD>
<LD>   Plenty of people walk in L.A., it's just that many of them don't
walk terribly far, and some of them only walk in certain places--on
the dusty trails of Griffith Park or along Santa Monica Boulevard or
around their neighborhoods in evenings, misted by a thousand
sprinklers. This is especially true in the summer when Angelenos are
inevitably baffled and somehow personally hurt by the fact that,
jeez, it's gotten so hot. Who wants to go outside and walk around
when, man, it's just so dang hot?</LD>
<TE>   This is especially true downtown, where many of the streets seem
flayed and left for dead under a sun merciless even at 9 a.m. Those
dim with shade thrown by skyscrapers have more of a convex-oven thing
going on--retaining the day's heat, long after twilight.</TE>
<TE>   How much easier it is to drive these streets, windows up, AC on,
observing summer in the city as if it were a series of paintings in a
gallery. An air-conditioned gallery. In another city. Paris, maybe.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble with driving, however, is that you are limited to the
harvest of only one sense--sight. Walk through downtown on a summer's
day and you will find the city beneath the city. Reduced by heat and
time to its essential elements, this is the demi-glace of urban life.</TE>
<TE>   The air you pass through has hot and cold spots, like the ocean.
The heat surrounds you, from the sky yes, pressing on you from the
sky like a gentle insistent palm, but also it seeps out of warm stone
and bodies passing. It shoots out in sudden jets from exhaust fans
and the wide-open back doors of commercial kitchens, interspersed
then with bands of sudden chill, where front doors have opened and
conditioned air, with its promising scents of candy and dish soap or
the perfume of an optometrist in her white coat has escaped.</TE>
<TE>   Passing a market, it is almost impossible to know exactly what you
smell--the queasy sweetness of fruit ripening and bruised; the almost
artificial breath of roses full blown by the heat with their swampy
undertow of waterlogged stems; fish, flat-eyed and suspect on melting
ice. The sizzle of hot meat and tortillas hangs in clouds over
takeout windows, the lurid odor of unlit, homemade incense marks this
street corner or that, and the wretched breath of alleys, of corners
in parking lots and beside dumpsters, sighs over the people that live
there.</TE>
<TE>   Dropped gum turns to liquid; smeared into black by passing soles,
it spots the hide of the sidewalk. Smells rise from underfoot--urine
and tobacco ash, unexpected swaths of hot concrete cooled by the
hoses of fastidious shopkeepers, the mellow rot of trash cans.
Crossing the street, one treads through the sticky scent of asphalt,
and a tang like a dirty nickel pried from a child's fist.</TE>
<TE>   It is frightening at first to walk amid the unfamiliar, grimy
heat, to hear people ask you for things--cigarettes, money, a smile,
more than a smile--to wonder if it's true that when people get too
hot in the summer violence occurs more easily, more savagely. But
after a block or two, there is something exhilarating too. This is
the city, what it smells like and feels like. No matter the country,
you will feel eyes on you as you walk down city streets. The sidewalk
will be hot with sun and the trammel of feet and there will be the
smell of flowers and bodies and sweet fruit and hot bread. All
brought to a boiling broth by summer.</TE>

<DH>In David Ebershoff's new novel, a couple's passion and the
region's pristine past drive the story</DH>

<LD>Pasadena is where author David Ebershoff grew up, the place he
couldn't wait to leave, and the place he eventually turned to as the
source of his success.</LD>
<LD>   The city symbolizes all of Southern California in his epic new
book, he says. And when he writes about the staggering physical
beauty that existed here until a generation or two ago, it's clear
he's not just writing fiction, but also history.</LD>
<LD>   Until about 75 years ago, Los Angeles was the largest agricultural
county in the United States, says Ebershoff, who lives in New York
but was back in town to promote "Pasadena" (Random House). And for
many years after that, the coastal cities' outskirts remained
pristine, offering vistas that lured travelers with their visual
siren song, compelling them to settle here.</LD>
<TE>   In the time frame of his nearly 500-page story, extending from the
late 1800s to the 1940s, orange groves pushed up to the edges of
Pasadena, the road to San Diego was open scrubland leading to
untouched foothills that led to dramatic bluffs overlooking the sea.</TE>
<TE>   But when Ebershoff, 33, was growing up, all that was gone. Most
weekends, he would ride in the back of his mother's station wagon
from their Pasadena home to their place in Carlsbad, and it seemed
that every inch of ocean-adjacent property had been built up, he
recalls. All, that is, except for the stretch from Camp Pendleton to
the San Onofre nuclear power plant --land disturbed only by the
freeway running through it. After years of taking this weekly drive,
the boy began to realize that this piece of land was the only vestige
left of what once had been miles of beauty.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he imagined the struggling onion farm, high on a bluff
over the Pacific, which his novel's heroine would inhabit until she
took the dusty train ride to the more civilized world of Rancho
Pasadena, where she would meet her fate.</TE>
<TE>   Ebershoff addresses the issue of nature despoiled--and many other
issues--in his sweeping new work. It is a book of passions, people
and places in flux, of the untamed landscape that defined those who
lived in it--a force so dominant that it becomes one of the most
important characters in the book.</TE>
<TE>   Like "East of Eden" and "Wuthering Heights" (two of Ebershoff's
favorite reads), "Pasadena" throbs with a sense of place and with all
kinds of desire, much of it thwarted. It is, at heart, a passionate
love story that pulses through decades--one in which two perfectly
mated souls yearn and reach out for each other, reinvent themselves
to better suit one another, and yet, ultimately, fail to connect.</TE>
<TE>   It is a classic story of love gone wrong through missed cues,
wrong choices and bad luck. And all set against the scene of two
fast-transforming locales: Pasadena, once a place of huge ranchos and
luxury hotels where the wealthy wintered, and the coastal onion farm
where both protagonists started out.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of two people who are meant to connect but fail to
"haunts the book," he says. It is a concept at the core of much 20th
century literature, and it is still a concern today.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at daily life, see how one has to struggle to connect and
stay connected. We have all this technology to help us connect, yet
it seems even more and more difficult to do so. It's so much easier
to mis-or disconnect."</TE>
<TE>   The idea of two properties that dominate his story and his
characters' identities came from "Wuthering Heights," Ebershoff says.
"That was also a tale of two locations and painful choices." Emily
Bronte's heroine "left Heathcliff and Wuthering Heights for marriage
and the civilized life at Thrushcross Grange."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of Ebershoff's tale, thousands of wilderness and farm
acres have been paved over for the roads and housing tracts to come,
freeways are in the offing, and a strange yellow, sulfurous haze has
been seen hanging above the valley. The first smog.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An Abundance</TE>
<TE>   of Rich Detail</TE>
<TE>   The book is rich with descriptive nature details, with so many
textures, colors, shapes, sounds and smells of so many trees,
flowers, fish, birds, fruit, shrubs and brush that, at times, it
seems no breeze blows without a full description of everything it
blows upon.</TE>
<TE>   This has not pleased all the reviewers, unused to plowing through
such verbose terrain. When Ebershoff appeared at Vroman's Bookstore
recently to read and autograph his new work, an audience member, with
well-thumbed book in hand, tried to phrase her question delicately.
"Your sentences are, uh, ... so much longer in this book than in your
last one."</TE>
<TE>   "I did that for a reason," he said, explaining that he used
language that properly evoked the era. And he used the coast's lush
landscape to "describe the characters' internal as well as external
lives," much as Bronte did in "Wuthering Heights" and John Steinbeck
did in "Grapes of Wrath."</TE>
<TE>   He says he wanted to re-create what Southern California looked
like until so recently, to get the specifics of its natural history
down on paper, "to say this is a world no longer with us, to have it
captured definitively. I thought that you cannot do a history of this
area without doing the natural history of it. The two are
inseparable."</TE>
<TE>   Ebershoff is publishing director of the Modern Library at Random
House in New York--a prestige division that reprints the world's
great books along with new ones. And that's just his day job.</TE>
<TE>   In his spare time, he writes at his hay farm near the Vermont
border in upstate New York, and in a writing room in midtown
Manhattan, overlooking a Fed Ex depot. At least four times a year, he
says, he comes home to Pasadena, where he works in the incomparable
Old World elegance of the main branch of the public library--a
lamp-lighted, woodsy, Renaissance Mediterranean structure. It is
where he spent much time in his youth.</TE>
<TE>   In the library's sun-drenched, red tile patio cafe, Ebershoff
leaned back in a wire chair, lifted his face to the sky and seemed to
draw sustenance from the scene of birds chirping as palms swayed and
bookworms studied in the sun.</TE>
<TE>   He loves New York, he says, "but New York doesn't fuel me, doesn't
feed my imagination the way California does. The images I absorbed as
a child, with an arroyo at my corner, the way the sunlight hits
California, which is so much different than on the East Coast. You
don't really get sunsets in the East the way you get them here. I had
no idea that was something I would miss."</TE>
<TE>   The library is just a few blocks from his parents' baronial brick
home on a leafy street that dead-ends at an arroyo. And it is just a
few blocks from Pasadena's renowned Polytechnic school, which he
attended from pre-kindergarten through high school.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a liberal school that taught us how to think; it was in
Pasadena, but not really of it," he says in a kind of code
decipherable by those who know how conservative at its core Pasadena
can be.</TE>
<TE>   In his book, he describes the social life of upper-crust
Pasadenans in the early 1900s--an exclusive group with clubs and
societies to which even the wealthiest outsiders could not gain entry
unless they had the proper pedigrees. Things are not all that
different nowadays, Ebershoff says, about today's inner circle of
Pasadenans who live on exquisite sylvan streets and belong to the
same clubs named in his book that thrived so long ago.</TE>
<TE>   Writing Began</TE>
<TE>   in High School</TE>
<TE>   Ebershoff started writing in high school, where he edited the
school paper. His highly acclaimed first novel, "The Danish Girl"
(Viking, 2000) is based on a true story of the first transsexual
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   It traces the metamorphosis of a marriage as a Danish artist
transforms himself into a woman with his wife's consent and
assistance. The wife is from Pasadena. Ebershoff's book of short
stories, "The Rose City" (Viking, 2001), also featured Pasadena as a
locale.</TE>
<TE>   Four of his former Polytechnic teachers turned up at the Vroman's
reading, along with some of his mother's Junior League colleagues,
his father's law firm colleagues, the family eye doctor and a variety
of other associates from his past. The author is a local hero now, of
sorts. But he wasn't always so accepted or acceptable, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Although his parents were community pillars, and his school
experience was "wonderful," he was an outsider in many ways.</TE>
<TE>   A boy who thought too much--partly because he was smart and partly
because he was gay and felt isolated from his peers. "I was always
looking for a world beyond the world I was from."</TE>
<TE>   The Pasadena library became his refuge, he says. It is still where
he writes when he comes home. "This is the time of year I remember
most," he says, sitting in the library patio. "It was summer and I
was bored, and it was unbearably hot and smoggy. I'd come here and
read. I was 15 or 16 when I began to realize that this place I
thought of as a boring suburb has a history.</TE>
<TE>   "But it was only when I got to college [Brown University] that I
began to have a sense of the specialness of the place I'd left
behind. I began to think of California writers in a different way.
The summer I was 19, I read all of Joan Didion and John Steinbeck. I
admire his use of landscape, of the natural world to tell his
stories. I wanted to come back and find out what that was all about."</TE>
<TE>   His book gives new meaning to the term "mixed reviews"--a phrase
usually indicating that some reviewers liked a book and others
didn't. In Ebershoff's case it means that many reviewers are so torn
between intense admiration and irritation that their reviews
flip-flop from pro to con within the space of a few paragraphs--a
sure sign that something extraordinary is going on in the saga that
traces the evolution of Southern California, in general, and
Pasadena, in particular, from untrammeled backwater to smug and
smoggy boomtown within the space of a generation or two.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Wide Range of</TE>
<TE>   Reviewers' Comments</TE>
<TE>   The book has been called everything from "an immediate classic" to
"florid hocum," with almost all reviewers (including the "hocum" guy)
in agreement that Ebershoff writes brilliantly and tells a compelling
tale.</TE>
<TE>   Any complaints seem to be that the book is so densely and
digressively descriptive, so multilayered in theme, so rambling and
emotionally intense that it defies glib analysis or definition.</TE>
<TE>   Some reviewers claim that Ebershoff's vivid descriptions of nature
are the emotional heart of the book. Others say it's the lush
descriptive passages that slow the book down.</TE>
<TE>   The book makes you think, they say. It's an endangered quality
that was once the hallmark of all serious literature and that seems
to be the most significant characteristic of the author himself.</TE>
<TE>   One of his main characters in "Pasadena" is always reading Gibbon,
the great 18th century historian who wrote about the downfall of the
Roman empire. Gibbon is one of his favorite authors, Ebershoff says,
his expression suddenly turning somber.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last year, I've been thinking about history a lot. And
Rome is something that I, and a lot of people I work with, keep
returning to. In light of all that has happened and is happening, it
seems that Rome is in the air. A sense of decline, the question of
how an empire sustains itself. How does a civilization that is so
grand and far reaching go away? How does it fall apart?"</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps he tried to find some answers by writing his book? He does
not respond quickly. "I only know that Rome is an example you cannot
ignore."</TE>

<LD>   Patrick and his friend Otto the Auto were in the car for a drive
to the mall with Patrick's dad. Otto had just put on his seat belt
and noticed that Patrick had not buckled up.</LD>
<LD>   "I think you forgot something important, Patrick," Otto said.</LD>
<TE>   "Oh, you mean my Laker championship cap," Patrick said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, you forgot that, but I'm talking about your seat belt. You
haven't buckled up," Otto said.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick thought for a moment, knowing that Otto was right, then
said, "Oh, that's OK. We're only going a few blocks. Besides, my dad
is a very safe driver."</TE>
<TE>   "You know, Patrick, you have a bigger chance of being in a crash
close to your home than anywhere else," Otto said. "I know your dad
is a safe driver, but how about all the other drivers on the road? If
one of them hits you when you're not buckled up, you could be hurt
very badly."</TE>
<TE>   "In school we learned that children get hurt or killed more often
by car crashes than by anything else," Patrick said.</TE>
<TE>   "Right," Otto said. "That's why it's important that you buckle
your seat belt every time you get into the car."</TE>
<TE>   "You're right, Otto. From now on, I'll buckle up every time,"
Patrick said.</TE>
<TE>   Otto smiled and said, "When you do that, you are just as big a
champion as the Lakers."</TE>
<TE>   Principals can arrange for Otto to visit schools by contacting the
Automobile Club of Southern California at (714) 885-2317. Visit
Otto's Web site at www.aaa-calif.com/otto for parent and teacher

<HD>Lingerie With a Flair for Femininity</HD>
<DH>Fashion* Fall/spring lines are showing more frills. Even
the basic boy-cut options are adding lace.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAULINE M. MILLARD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Since vintage clothes and even 1980s styles are finding their way
back onto the cultural radar, it should come as no surprise that
lingerie for fall and spring has also been inspired by things past.</LD>
<LD>   At the Lingerie Americas show this year in New York City,
undergarments were lacy and frilly and very feminine. Designers
including Chantelle, Calvin Klein and Elle MacPherson Intimates took
girly looks and made them womanly, using lace and trim and fashion
colors such as yellows, deeps reds and violets.</LD>
<LD>   For everyday basics that still have a romantic flair, Jockey is
offering a line of all-lace bras, thongs, briefs and camisoles. Their
show for fall and spring highlighted garments made of a matte and
floral lace that are simple, pretty and seamless.</LD>
<TE>   Boy-cut briefs and hipster shorts are also big with designers.
Whether in lace or cotton, boy briefs are being paired with bras as
often as thongs.</TE>
<TE>   "The boy short was a European-inspired design that seems to be
becoming the item of the year," says Dorothy Wahl, vice president of
sales for women at Jockey. "The trend seems to be heading more toward
a feminine look in pastels and soft fabrics."</TE>
<TE>   Calvin Klein took the boy-cut brief and introduced what it calls
the "boy thong," which is half brief, half thong, and meant to be
worn with low-riding pants.</TE>
<TE>   However, if your fall and spring fashions are going to be clingy,
then your lingerie should be as understated as possible. Seamless is
a popular trend for the fall and spring. Designers across the
spectrum are creating garments that offer support and coverage
without becoming part of the outfit.</TE>
<TE>   Gap has come out with a seamless tank top made of a super-fine
cotton. Until recently this type of fabric has been available only in
high-end stores because it was difficult to make on a larger scale,
says Rachel DiCarlo, a spokeswoman for Gap. Seamless fabrics are knit
on a cylinder, and Lycra helps garments keep their shape.</TE>
<TE>   "These are designs that disappear under clothing while still
giving you a natural look," says DiCarlo.</TE>
<TE>   Gap has the Essential Bra, which molds to the body and is made in
both cotton and smooth nylon. They also have a T-Shirt Bra--smooth
with more padding than their other bras but without the seams,
perfect for wearing under thin clothing.</TE>
<TE>   Designers also kept in mind the client who may want her underwear
on display. 6ixty 8ight and its younger counterpart No Romeo, labels
out of Hong Kong making their debut in the United States, created a
line of bras, underwear and camisoles that are meant to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   "The line was inspired by French women, who are sometimes ahead of
the times when it comes to fashion," says Gardenia Ramirez, a
spokeswoman for No Romeo and 6ixty 8ight (www.6ixty8ight.com). "These
are pieces that are meant to be seen, that blur the line between
underwear and outerwear."</TE>

<LD>The language of media commerce is rather like very young

prospect of achieving it was the rationale used by chief executives
such as Bertelsmann's Thomas Middelhoff, AOL Time Warner Inc.'s
Robert W. Pittman and Vivendi Universal's Jean-Marie Messier to
relentlessly aggregate publishing houses, film studios, broadcasting
outlets, music companies and various online enterprises into
sprawling media conglomerates. The theory was that when each firm
reached an unspecified critical mass, it would become synergetic--a
whole whose value was more than the sum of its parts.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, all three companies turned out to be worth considerably
less. As a consequence, all three CEOs now are out of their
respective executive suites.</TE>
<TE>   Their failure is the subject of a publishing boomlet: Three
American houses--HarperCollins, Crown and Knopf--currently have
purchased books on the AOL Time Warner fiasco. (Coincidentally, the
latter two are divisions of Random House, Bertelsmann's largest U.S.
property.) Messier, meanwhile, continues to flout French cultural
traditions and is spending his August holiday writing a memoir of his
rise and fall. It is due out in September under the self-effacing
title "How I Was Betrayed."</TE>
<TE>   All of this raises interesting questions among media analysts. For
example: Were the synergetic media conglomerates destroyed by the
impatience of short-sighted investors? And, more important, what
impact will the firms' retrenchment have on the book publishers they
accumulated?</TE>
<TE>   "Partly, what has occurred does represent a failure of patience,"
said Martin Kaplan, who directs USC's Norman Lear Center and is
associate dean of the university's Annenberg School for
Communication. "But it's also proof that, sometimes, certain things
have to be allowed to arise organically from circumstances. You can't
create synergies with a business plan, especially in a creative
field, like filmmaking or publishing, where you're essentially
bottling lightning.</TE>
<TE>   "The history of media is replete with examples of partnerships
that virtually formed themselves when the moment was ripe: movie
studios co-financing each other's films; a book published by one
company becoming another company's hit movie. But you don't have to
create new brick-and-mortar institutions to achieve those sorts of
synergies," said Kaplan, whose center studies, among other things,
the "convergence of entertainment, commerce and society."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Osnos is publisher and chief executive of Public Affairs
Press, one of the growing number of successful independent publishing
houses. But from 1991 to 1996, he ran the Times Books division of
Random House, and much of what Osnos now believes will transpire has
a familiar feel.</TE>
<TE>   "In the case of Middelhoff and Messier, you have two new-style
European entrepreneurs who thought they could conquer the
international media, which now is the most glamorous part of
international business," Osnos said. "Neither succeeded, and both of
their enterprises are going to be downsized--all but broken up. I
think it's important to remember that this sort of thing has happened
before. It wasn't that long ago that the Japanese had their moment in
Hollywood and got their hands slapped badly. Even Sony, though it's
currently having a terrific year for films, was practically brought
to its knees when it bought a studio and found itself in real
trouble. And, at the time, Sony was practically an international
synonym for quality and success."</TE>
<TE>   As far as book publishing goes, Osnos believes "the most immediate
consequence is that Vivendi's Houghton Mifflin is for sale and is
going to be broken up and sold off in bits and pieces. Actually, its
trade division could become a significant independent player, which
would be nice for everybody, from a qualitative standpoint.</TE>
<TE>   "For Random House, Bertelsmann's shake-up probably is a very good
thing. It will reinforce the old-school publishing traditions at
Random House because Bertelsmann is a buy-and-hold outfit that gives
its managers a great deal of autonomy. That means that because Random
House is profitable, it probably is OK in its current configuration.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, it's another case of back to the future," Osnos said.
"When S.I. Newhouse, who sold Random House to Bertelsmann, bought the
company in 1980, the seller was RCA, which was then a media
conglomerate in the process of falling apart. Actually, it doesn't
exist at all today except as a name on a record label.</TE>
<TE>   "Some things, as they say, aren't what they used to be and never
were," Osnos quipped.</TE>
<TE>   But, when it comes to publishing, the Lear Center's Kaplan
believes, that's just fine.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime you have more buyers in the creative marketplace, the
consumer benefits," he said. "The more places an author can go to
sell their book, the better. The overarching problem with
consolidation in the publishing business has always been that when
there are too few buyers, diversity of viewpoint and expression
declines and everyone--readers, writers and publishers--is hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Ed Cray has written biographies of George C. Marshall, "General of
the Army," and Earl Warren, "Chief Justice":</TE>
<TE>   "After five years, I am completing a biography of Woody Guthrie,
which will contain a great deal of material that was not available
when Joe Klein published his bio in 1980. This has been the most
difficult of the three biographies I've written. In part, that's
because Guthrie was so complex a personality and, in part, because he
fabricated so much of his personal history. Certainly, the 'hobo'
Guthrie was far more sophisticated and well-read than he ever let on
to any but a handful of his closest associates.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on newly opened archives and more than 100 interviews with
people who knew Guthrie, this book makes clear his very strong
connections with Los Angeles. It was in Los Angeles that he got his
start as a radio entertainer and as a songwriter. He lived in
Glendale and Silver Lake from 1937 to 1940 and boasted he knew every
mountain ravine from Pasadena to Griffith Park. When the first
symptoms of Huntington's disease drove him out of New York City, he
fled to Topanga Canyon, where he bought land with the idea that was
where he'd retire."</TE>

<HD>He's Doing This for Peanuts</HD>
<DH>Mascot Buddy McNutty goes on tour to remind Americans to
eat their legumes</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROY RIVENBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Times are tough for the lowly peanut. Pro-legume president Jimmy
Carter is long gone from the White House. Schools and airlines have
started banning the snack because of potentially fatal allergies. And
peanut sales have sputtered in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   So the National Peanut Board did what anyone else would do in such
circumstances: It built a 32-foot-high peanut out of steel and foam
and began driving it around the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   It also hired a costumed mascot named Buddy McNutty, not to be
confused with a certain monocle-wearing peanut who works for the
Planters company.</LD>
<TE>   "I am not Mr. Peanut," McNutty stressed during an interview. "Mr.
Peanut wears tights. I wear leggings."</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, McNutty and his entourage visited Los Angeles as
part of the National Peanut Tour, a traveling exhibit of peanut
propaganda. They parked their giant peanut outside the L.A. Zoo and
entertained visitors with peanut trivia, recipes and paraphernalia.</TE>
<TE>   They also had a peanut museum that displayed a video on the making
of peanut butter ("Find out what jelly is so happy about"), a replica
peanut plant (peanuts grow underground, not on trees) and amusing
peanut facts:</TE>
<TE>   * In 1500 BC, the Incas of Peru used peanuts as a sacrificial
offering to their deities.</TE>
<TE>   * Arachibutyrophobia is the fear of getting peanut butter stuck to
the roof of your mouth.</TE>
<TE>   * Two peanut farmers have been elected president--Carter and
Thomas Jefferson.</TE>
<TE>   * Mountaineer Tom Miller used his nose to push a peanut to the top
of Colorado's Pikes Peak in four days, 23 hours and 47 minutes (if
true, that beats the record set by Texan Bill Williams, who took
three weeks and went through 170 pairs of pants to accomplish the
same feat in 1929).</TE>
<TE>   * The world's largest peanut butter and jelly sandwich was 40 feet
long and contained 150 pounds of peanut butter and 50 pounds of
jelly. It was assembled in 1993 in the town of Peanut, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   * When making PB&amp;J sandwiches, 96% of Americans put the peanut
butter on before the jelly.</TE>
<TE>   Also joining the tour was peanut chef Duane Nutter (yes, that's
really his name, and he has a Georgia driver's license to prove it).
Normally, Nutter dishes up a mixture of comedy and cooking, but the
zoo didn't have room for his kitchen, so he paced around in his
peanut-shell foam hat, greeting visitors.</TE>
<TE>   The star of the tour--aside from the hydraulically powered
17,000-pound, 32-foot steel peanut--was McNutty, a.k.a. Noah Pransky,
a 21-year-old professional mascot whose resume includes stints as
Wally the Green Monster (the mascot for the Boston Red Sox), Paws the
Polar Bear (a minor-league baseball team mascot) and Rhett the
Terrier (mascot for Boston University, Pransky's alma mater).</TE>
<TE>   To get the peanut gig, he had to defeat two other mascot
professionals whose combined work history included jobs as Buckley
the Buckle Upper (a mascot for a highway safety program), Firehawk (a
tire company mascot), Fuzzy Bear (an Atlanta radio station mascot),
the Tasmanian Devil (on loan from Warner Bros. as the mascot for the
1998 Goodwill Games), Harry the Husky (University of Washington) and
Sammy the Sounder (mascot for a Seattle soccer team).</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great career," Pransky says.</TE>
<TE>   Well, except for the health hazards. "During my four years in the
'Brotherhood of the Fur,' I've had heatstroke a few times and heat
exhaustion a lot," Pransky says. "I also tore the ligaments in my
thumb giving someone a high-five." Other mascots endure shoulder
injuries, knee injuries and broken bones, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "You're always pushing the limits physically while doing stunts,"
he explains.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he loves the job. "It's almost like the Clark Kent
phenomenon, where you have a secret life," he says. At Boston
University, Pransky didn't tell his roommates or his family that he
was the school mascot. "If people know who's in the suit, it loses
the magic," he says.</TE>
<TE>   As Buddy McNutty, Pransky cavorts, poses for photos and generally
makes a fool of himself. "It's like being an improv comedian," he
says. "You have to read people and react to them in comic ways, all
without talking."</TE>
<TE>   His other trick is climbing onstage at concerts and playing the
drums. "It blows people away," says chef Nutter. "They think he's
getting up there to dance, but instead this oversized fuzzy peanut
sits down at the drums and starts playing like a pro."</TE>
<TE>   Now in its second year, the National Peanut Tour makes stops at
state fairs, baseball games, barbecue festivals, horse races and the
Suffolk, Va., Peanut Festival, which features an annual peanut butter
sculpture contest.</TE>
<TE>   The $1.5-million tab is picked up by the Atlanta-based National
Peanut Board, which was formed two years ago after the ailing peanut
industry petitioned the U.S. Department of Agriculture to create a
legume version of the dairy industry's "Got milk?" campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Ballots were sent to all 23,000 U.S. peanut farmers, asking them
to impose a 1% fee on themselves for peanut advertising and research.
The result was, yes, a national nut board.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the group's budget goes toward finding a cure for peanut
allergies, but most is funneled into advertising. In one ad, a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich is shown next to the phrase: "Have lunch
with your inner child."</TE>
<TE>   The effort seems to be paying off, says National Peanut Board
chief Raffaela Marie Rizzo, a former timber industry spokeswoman:
"Since our campaign began, peanut butter sales are up 6%."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Rizzo might be seeing things through
peanut-butter-colored glasses. If the L.A. Zoo visit is any
indication, peanut professionals have a peculiar way of viewing the
world. For example, in the National Peanut Tour's timeline of
history, World War I is put on the same footing as the introduction
of Welch's Concord grape jelly.</TE>
<TE>   And construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 is a
milestone that is "eclipsed by ... the invention of crunchy peanut
butter by Skippy."</TE>

<LD>One afternoon a few weeks after Ruth and I learned about the secret
experiment, Ruth came running over to my house.</LD>
<LD>   "Guess what, Shirley?" she cried. "Daddy and Harry let me be a
taste tester."</LD>
<LD>   "What's that?" I asked.</LD>
<TE>   "They made a candied ice cream bar, and I got to taste it," Ruth
said.</TE>
<TE>   "They finally figured out a recipe that worked. They used
chocolate candy, cocoa butter and coconut oil--and the chocolate
turned hard and stayed on a bar of ice cream without turning into a
gooey clump or slipping off."</TE>
<TE>   "Really?" I cried, becoming excited too. "How was the taste test?"</TE>
<TE>   "Delicious!" Ruth answered.</TE>
<TE>   "Are they going to sell it in the shop now?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth shook her head. "Not yet," she said softly.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "There's another problem," Ruth said. "When Daddy and Harry gave
me the bar of chocolate-covered ice cream I picked it up with my
hands to eat it. But the chocolate began melting, and it turned into
an awful mess all over my hands and face."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone was disappointed, but not for long. Soon we found out
that Harry had another idea.</TE>
<TE>   In the basement they kept boxes of wooden sticks, which they used
for making the Good Humor Suckers. They decided to put the sticks
into one end of the ice cream bars and then freeze the bars with the
sticks in them. That would turn the bars into frozen lollipops! And
solve the messy eating problem, too. Ruth and I thought that was very
clever.</TE>
<TE>   We hoped that was their last problem.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: How will the chocolate candy and ice cream bar turn out?</TE>
<TE>   This story, by Nancy Smiler Levinson, is based on the true account
of the history of the Good Humor ice cream bar, a chapter in a book
on the social history of ice cream, "We All Scream for Ice Cream!" by
Lee Wardlaw, HarperCollins 2000. Levinson's story will be on The
Times Web site at www.latimes.comkids.</TE>

<HD>Olympics Producer Advising on N.Y. Sept. 11 Ceremonies</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York City has retained Don Mischer, who produced the opening and
closing ceremonies for this year's Winter Olympics as well as the
1996 Summer Games in Atlanta, as a consultant for its Sept. 11
commemoration.</LD>
<LD>   Mischer and his team will help coordinate the all-day memorial,
which begins with a bagpipe procession from each of the five boroughs
to the World Trade Center site, followed by a ceremony at ground zero
that will include reading the names of 2,823 people killed in the
attack.</LD>
<LD>   "They're providing a lot of logistical advice in executing our
vision for the day," said Ed Skyler, a spokesman for New York Mayor
Michael R. Bloomberg, who confirmed Mischer's participation.
Bloomberg recently said that his goal is for the event to be "simple
and powerful."</LD>
<TE>   Various anniversary memorials are scheduled across the country;
still, most media attention will undoubtedly focus on New York, which
President Bush will visit after stops at the Pentagon and
Shanksville, Pa., where United Flight 93 crashed.</TE>
<TE>   Mischer, whose associate David Goldberg has spent the past few
weeks in New York helping coordinate plans, likened the logistics
involved to the Olympics. "What we're really doing is trying to help
them mount the day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Over his career Mischer has produced a lengthy list of live events
and television specials, from the Emmy Awards and Kennedy Center
Honors to festivities marking Hong Kong's reunification with China.</TE>
<TE>   Notably, to fulfill his Olympic commitment he withdrew as producer
of last year's Emmys, initially pushed back by Sept. 11, after a
second postponement followed the U.S. attack on Afghanistan.</TE>

<HD>In Early Days, She Was Like a Sister to Elvis</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* Judy Spreckels, who could keep a secret, talks
about her friendship with Presley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA DEUTSCH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She was the sister Elvis Presley never had, a companion, confidante
and keeper of secrets in the exciting days of his early career.</LD>
<LD>   They drove bumper cars in Las Vegas, rode horses in California and
hung out at Graceland, the Memphis home he had just bought for his
mother.</LD>
<LD>   Her name is Judy Spreckels, and she agreed to her first sit-down
interview this week, with a reporter who was once the president of an
Elvis fan club. As the 25th anniversary of Presley's Aug. 16 death
approaches, memories were bubbling to the surface--although there
were still some things Spreckels wouldn't discuss.</LD>
<TE>   "He told me secrets that I never told and will never tell," says
Spreckels, now 70. "I had nothing to do with being a yes man for him,
and obviously he trusted me.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything he told me was not going to go to any publication. I am
the only person who was around Elvis who was a writer and didn't
write a book. I felt secrets were secrets."</TE>
<TE>   Her collection of memorabilia includes every record Presley made,
but, she says, "My house is not decorated with Elvis memorabilia. I
have so many indelible memories, I don't need to see them."</TE>
<TE>   They met when Spreckels, an heiress who had a ranch in Las Vegas,
was living at a hotel where Elvis was staying.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sitting at a writing desk in the lobby writing a letter,
and he just came up to me and started talking."</TE>
<TE>   It was 1956 and Elvis was a newborn star. "How could you not know
who he was even then?" she says. "I was friendly and told him I loved
his record, 'Heartbreak Hotel.' "</TE>
<TE>   Then he took her to the gift shop to show her a magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'This says I'm a hillbilly. I'm not, am I?' I said, 'No,
you're a singer.' And after that I was with him and the guys all the
time. There wasn't a crowd then, just a few guys."</TE>
<TE>   Back then, she says, Elvis was surrounded by the first wave of
what would become known as the Memphis Mafia. Spreckels was the only
woman in the group.</TE>
<TE>   She once described herself as having been like a sister to Elvis
but never a girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   "Girls come and go," she explained. "But sisters stay forever."</TE>
<TE>   Reminded of the comment now, she says it is true. "This sister
lasted forever. We were friends till the day he died."</TE>
<TE>   Spreckels glows when remembering the idyllic early days.</TE>
<TE>   "We were like kids," she says of that time when Elvis was about 21
and she was two years older. In the afternoons in Las Vegas, they
would ride bumper cars at an amusement park. And they went out for
adventures where they could escape the fans.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved the fact that I had a light blue Cadillac, and he bought
the same car for his mother in pink," she remembers.</TE>
<TE>   "One day, we drove my car out into the desert and his cousin came
with us. Elvis drove that car as fast as it could go, and I was in
the front seat whooping and screaming and laughing. His cousin was on
the floor in the back, he was so scared. But I'd been a stunt player
in the movies, and Elvis couldn't go fast enough to scare me."</TE>
<TE>   When they visited Graceland, she said, "We stayed up all night
listening to Elvis singing and playing the piano. He liked to sing
hymns. I didn't know any hymns, but I do now. He introduced me to
'Amazing Grace.' "</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Judy remembers going out on a Sunday with him and
his friend, actor Nick Adams.</TE>
<TE>   "Elvis decided to stop in a sports store and buy us bows and
arrows. It was just whimsy. We went up to Mulholland Drive and were
shooting bows and arrows and nobody saw us."</TE>
<TE>   Another time, the trio went horseback riding and were captured in
a snapshot by a teenager at the ranch. It shows Judy smiling up
adoringly at Elvis, the wind blowing her hair. "I'm the only one in
that picture who's still alive," she notes sadly.</TE>
<TE>   She has many unpublished photographs, she says, and, "He was
looking at me all the time and he was laughing. It was just such a
fun time."</TE>
<TE>   Often, she traveled to Elvis' singing engagements around the
country. And once, Spreckels, an artist, got him to sit for a
portrait she drew. He inscribed it, "To Judy Spreckels, I love you,
baby. Elvis Presley."</TE>
<TE>   "We loved each other, as it says on my picture. But it was just a
really terrific friendship."</TE>
<TE>   When his mother, Gladys, died in 1958, Judy came to the funeral.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anyone as sad as Elvis was," she says. "He
grieved. He cried continuously. We were in the front hall at
Graceland and he stood there hugging me for a half hour. He was
crying and crying and crying. It was the saddest thing I'd ever
seen."</TE>
<TE>   In later years, she attended his Las Vegas concerts, and he would
stop the show to introduce her. She had married by then and so had
he. By the time drugs invaded his life, she was less involved.</TE>
<TE>   "I never think of him as he was the last year or year and a half,"
she says. "I think of him as so vibrant and beautiful and funny. When
he died, a whole part of my life changed and I died a little."</TE>
<TE>   Spreckels now lives quietly in the San Fernando Valley. Asked if
she ever ponders the tragedy of Elvis dying at 42, she pauses for a
moment and says, "I think he got as old as he wanted to get."</TE>

<HD>Museums, Art Centers Make Sept. 11 Plans</HD>
<DH>Arts* Some are joining a national effort to provide special
programs; others will keep the day low-key.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To commemorate the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks on the United
States, museums and art centers nationwide are devising their own
projects and presentations for America's Freedoms: A Day of
Remembrance, a grass-roots project facilitated by the American Assn.
of Museums and the Federal Institute of Museum and Library Services
in Washington, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Martin, director of the federal organization, said the
project arose from a January gathering in Chicago of 40 museum
leaders from across the country. Martin said he expected the
discussion to revolve around the financial impact of Sept. 11 on
museums; instead, the participating institutions were less interested
in money and more consumed with devising a way to band together on
the one-year anniversary to provide a range of special services and
opportunities.</LD>
<LD>   "The idea was not to come up with a one-size-fits-all,
cookie-cutter, 'you've-got-to-do-this' program," Martin said. "They
have done all the work, we have provided no funds. The museum
community is incredibly diverse--we have zoos and aquariums, museums
devoted to children, or science and technology. You decide what you
want to do in your community."</LD>
<TE>   In North Carolina, the Charlotte Museum of History will ring its
American Freedom Bell on the hour on Sept. 11. Several New York City
museums will feature photo exhibitions on the history of the World
Trade Center as well as photos of the attacks. In Washington, D.C.,
the National Museum of American History will open a show of artifacts
from plane crash sites. The Hibel Museum of Art in Jupiter, Fla.,
will ask each Sept. 11 visitor to place a flower on the museum green.</TE>
<TE>   The list of participants, which leaders say is evolving, does not
yet include any major Los Angeles museums. A spokeswoman for the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art said the museum is considering a Sept.
11 commemoration but is still formulating its plan. The museum will
provide that information to the Day of Remembrance project for its
Web site when it becomes available. Two smaller Los Angeles art
centers--Forest Lawn Museum in the Hollywood Hills and Corita Art
Center at the Immaculate Heart Community in Hollywood, have already
signed on to participate. Forest Lawn plans a mural created by
bereaved children.</TE>
<TE>   Getty Center spokeswoman Karen Nelson said that the Getty so far
has no plans to join. "A lot of museums say they are waiving
admission, but we already have free admission," Nelson said. "We
definitely hope, like last year, that people would come and use the
museum as a place of solace and refuge." Nelson added that the Getty
will devote the September issue of its conservation newsletter to the
issue of how to commemorate historic sites with painful memories.</TE>
<TE>   Katherine W. Lee, spokeswoman for downtown's Museum of
Contemporary Art, said that the national project is "on our radar
screen," but the museum will be closed between Sunday--when its
current Andy Warhol show closes--and Sept. 15.</TE>
<TE>   MOCA will take advantage of a coincidence to educate museum
patrons about Sept. 11: Later in the year, MOCA will display a
large-scale sculpture by Nancy Rubins, constructed of airplane parts.
Though Rubins created the piece before the planes crashed into the
World Trade Center, Lee said MOCA has already discussed with the
artist the possibility that the piece's visual impact could lead to
discussion of the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   The museums of San Diego's Balboa Park, including San Diego Art
Institute, San Diego Aerospace Museum and San Diego Zoo, have been
plugged into the Day of Remembrance project for five months. Many
have special exhibition plans or reduced-ticket plans, and the zoo
will offer some free tickets to emergency workers and their families.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum gallery will
present an all-day memorial reading from the book "Portraits of Grief
9/11/01," a collection of New York Times obituaries of those who died
at the World Trade Center.</TE>

<HD>ABC Looks Back, Hoping It Will See the Future</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nostalgic TV was all the rage last season, as blockbuster ratings for
CBS' "The Carol Burnett Show" special triggered a reunion invasion of
vintage series during the May sweeps, with programmers piling on that
sprig of inspiration the same way beefy linemen pounce on a loose
football.</LD>
<LD>   One network, however, appears determined to keep living in the
past. Indeed, after examining ABC's new prime-time lineup, as well as
a flurry of deals that have left many in the TV industry scratching
their well-coiffed heads, there's reason to believe the ailing
network might be able to engineer a ratings turnaround--provided,
that is, it somehow finds a way to roll back the calendar to the
1970s.</LD>
<LD>   It shouldn't be a surprise that Walt Disney Chairman Michael
Eisner would yearn for a simpler time, specifically for those halcyon
days when he was a young ABC programming executive, as opposed to
being the one running the network's parent studio and being dogged by
the question, "Honey, who shrunk the stock price?"</LD>
<TE>   Life sure seemed easier then. Under founder Leonard Goldenson, ABC
rose to the top of the ratings, riding a wave of breezy low-octane
hits like "Happy Days," which also described the prevailing mood
inside the network.</TE>
<TE>   Small wonder that the ABC "cast members" (as Disney refers to all
employees) under Eisner's direction would seek to rotate the globe
back to an era before the sky fell in on them--bringing to mind the
heroics of a square-jawed Christopher Reeve, whom ABC will feature in
a prime-time special next month in 1978's "Superman."</TE>
<TE>   From that perspective, it's probably no accident ABC's great hope
heading into the fall is "8 Simple Rules...," a sitcom about an
overwhelmed dad starring "Three's Company's" John Ritter, an alumnus
from the network's class of '77. The main difference--to quote an
honest-to-gosh ABC radio spot--"This time he's not chasing the girls,
he's raising them!"</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the network is promoting its early-evening fare as the
"ABC Happy Hour," trying to unify a disjointed roster of programs by
evoking images of the lighthearted chuckles "Happy Days" and its ilk
engendered. Either that or ABC hopes people in Nielsen's ratings
sample will imbibe liberally between 5 and 7 p.m., then fall asleep
with the TV on.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's breadcrumb trail to the past doesn't end there. Programming
guru Fred Silverman, who oversaw the network during those years, has
been retained as a consultant. In addition, ABC recently appointed
Steve Sohmer, who helped turn "Dallas" and "The Cosby Show" into hits
for CBS and NBC in the 1970s and early '80s, as its head of
marketing.</TE>
<TE>   There have been some more forward-looking maneuvers too, although,
truth be told, most appear as confusing or disconnected from reality
as those already cited, as if closing your eyes and wishing the
average viewer still received a handful of channels, instead of 90,
could make it so.</TE>
<TE>   This shouldn't be construed, by the way, as criticism for calling
upon old pros like Silverman and Sohmer, who bring considerable
experience and savvy to the tasks at hand. Those hires, however, have
to be viewed in the larger context of the Fantasyland that ABC has
occupied since Disney took over, a reign characterized by instability
and chaos, in contrast to the no-nonsense approach that characterized
the former management at Capital Cities and before that Goldenson.</TE>
<TE>   Most of ABC's recent moves, in fact, amount to little more than
cleaning up earlier messes. Sohmer, for example, must compensate for
such misfires as the network's much-lampooned yellow ad campaign,
which operated from the premise that splashing a sunny color across
the screen would inspire people to watch mediocre shows. (As an
aside, he may discover that it's a lot more fun promoting "Cheers"
than "Life With Bonnie," comic Bonnie Hunt's latest series.)</TE>
<TE>   ABC also announced with considerable fanfare an agreement forging
ties to HBO, the pay cable service that waters its lawn with Emmy
nominations, to develop programs for the network. It's one of those
deals that look great on paper, generating enough headlines to foster
the impression ABC is taking steps to fix things.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even the HBO deal, on closer inspection, is puzzling. After
being frustrated by critically acclaimed also-rans such as "Once and
Again" and "The Job," ABC stated that it's looking for more
accessible fare. As ABC Entertainment President Susan Lyne put it
last month, "We'll leave groundbreaking to someone else."</TE>
<TE>   Fair enough, but then why plunge into business with a pay network
renowned for boundary-pushing edginess? Granted, HBO did play a role
generating "Everybody Loves Raymond," but that was its last hit for a
major network, and crafting a companion for "America's Funniest
Videos" is hardly a chore worthy of the swagger exemplified by the
channel's slogan "It's not TV. It's HBO."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, hooking up with HBO represents a tacit admission that
ABC erred by relying almost exclusively on Disney to generate this
year's crop of prime-time programming. And though most producers
welcome seeing the networks admit that corporate inbreeding can be
anathema to creativity, for ABC to do so now hardly sounds like a
ringing endorsement of its new series.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Lyne says she is enthusiastic about those shows,
while maintaining that program development for the coming
season--when Disney produced all but four of the network's 30 new
series candidates--was "an anomaly."</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm trying to do is bring some balance to it," she said,
referring to the deal with HBO and others designed to cultivate
projects from outside studios. "I am really committed to trying to
cast the widest net we possibly can."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, ABC knows one TV trick that never goes out of style:
aping the success of competitors, this week enlisting the producer of
Fox's "American Idol" to create a new contest show titled
"Supergirl." The competition will seek to find the "most talented"
girl--based on "athletic ability, mental agility, performance in the
popular arts and, of course, beauty"--with the survivor to earn $1
million in endorsements.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, if the winner can do all that, maybe ABC should consider
letting her run the network.</TE>
<TE>   For a studio that introduced the world to a magic mirror that
predicts the future, Disney has been plagued by remarkably
shortsighted and fuzzy vision regarding ABC. At this point, just
empowering the well-regarding Lyne to formulate and pursue a coherent
strategy for more than a few months would be progress, though based
on the uphill battle the network faces, soliciting help from a fairy
godmother shouldn't be ruled out.</TE>
<TE>   Lyne says she knew the challenge would be formidable when she
accepted her current post in January, and network officials insist
they recognize what needs to be done; still, given ABC's apparent
resolve to turn back time, even "Supergirl" would be pushed to the
limit. No, this looks like a job for Superman--or maybe Cher.</TE>

<LD>   Elvis: Fiscal Life Even After Death</LD>
<LD>   A quarter-century after his death, Elvis Presley is still raking
in the big bucks. The Recording Industry Assn. of America has
announced that 100 million albums by the "King of Rock 'n' Roll" have
been sold--putting him second to the Beatles, who have sold 165
million units in the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   And, for the second year running, Presley leads the list of the
top-earning dead celebrities, according to Forbes magazine. Sales of
all things Elvis totaled $37 million from June 2001 to June 2002--$4
million of which came from a British dance remix of his 1968 song "A
Little Less Conversation."</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 on the list is "Peanuts" creator Charles M. Schulz, with $28
million in earnings. John Lennon and race car driver Dale Earnhardt,
who's new to the list this year, both made $20 million. Other
first-timers: former Beatle George Harrison, with $17 million in
earnings; rapper Tupac Shakur, with $7 million; and author Robert
Ludlum, with $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes reporters determined the top dead earners by looking at
estates, interviewing lawyers and surviving family members, and
calculating pretax earnings to the estates from licensing agreements
and book and record sales.</TE>
<TE>   Stones Retrospective Due Out Soon</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 1, shortly after the launch of the Rolling Stones'
two-year world tour, Virgin Records will release what is being billed
as the first "complete and definitive" retrospective of the band's
40-year career.</TE>
<TE>   The two-CD set--with selections picked by the band itself--is the
first to combine the group's post-1970 music with the '60s hits
controlled by former manager Allen Klein. A thaw in the chilly
relationship between Klein and the Stones led the accountant to
approve the project, which his ABKCO Records is co-issuing.</TE>
<TE>   "The Stones wanted it, and I'm happy we could do it with them,"
Klein said.</TE>
<TE>   The set will also serve up four new tracks: "Keys to Your Love,"

<TE>   'Anna Nicole Show' Dips in Week Two</TE>
<TE>   E!'s "The Anna Nicole Show" averaged 3.4 million viewers on
Sunday, reflecting an 18% drop from the program's record-setting
premiere for the basic cable network the week before.</TE>
<TE>   E! noted that the rating actually rose among adults 18 to 34, the
target demographic for the program. Critics skewered the premiere of
the show, which tracks the life of model-actress Anna Nicole Smith
using the same cinema verite style as MTV's "The Osbournes."</TE>
<TE>   DANCE</TE>
<TE>   Bourne Has Stumbled  but Keeps Moving</TE>
<TE>   Director-choreographer Matthew Bourne, whose comi-tragic rewrites
of "Swan Lake" and "Cinderella" took the dance world by storm in
recent years, hasn't had an easy time of late. Feuding with the
administrator of his Adventures in Motion Pictures, he lost control
of the company. And plans to become the resident company at London's
Old Vic never panned out.</TE>
<TE>   Never one to roll over, however, Bourne has formed a new
company--one aptly called New Adventures. He's also rehearsing "Play
Without Words," an experimental mime creation about sex and class.
Commissioned by London's National Theatre, the project was aborted
during his "commercial period" with his former company.</TE>
<TE>   Though he "loved doing the big stuff," Bourne told the London
newspaper the Telegram, "shifting gears isn't hard.... Fame is quite
nice if it's only a very mild form of fame.... If I could just have a
company and do a piece a year, develop dancers, develop a style, I'd
be happy."</TE>
<TE>   After the opening at the National later this month, Bourne is
revising one of his old hits, "The Nutcracker!" for Sadler's Wells at
Christmas. In his spare time, the choreographer is developing ideas
for a stage show of "The Little Mermaid" for Disney. And next year,
he may create the stage version of Tim Burton's "Edward
Scissorhands."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Sally Field will make her Broadway debut in Edward Albee's
Tony-winning "The Goat: or Who Is Sylvia?" She and Bill Irwin will
replace Mercedes Ruehl and Bill Pullman starting Sept. 13.... PBS
commentator Bill Moyers pleaded guilty Monday to a charge of
negligent driving. He was fined $750 for taking the wheel under the
influence a month ago in Vermont.... Wolfgang Petersen ("The Perfect
Storm") will direct and produce "Troy," an adventure based on "The
Iliad." According to the Hollywood Reporter, he's putting his
"Superman vs. Batman" on hold to make the new project's 2004 release
date.... The famed "Lansdowne" portrait of George Washington will be
on display at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Nov. 8 through
March 9 as part of its first U.S. tour organized by the Smithsonian's
National Portrait Gallery.... Jodie Foster will receive the
outstanding acting achievement award at the Hollywood Film Festival
taking place at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Oct. 7. Naomi Watts
("Mulholland Drive") and director McG ("Charlie's Angels") will get
the breakthrough awards. .... Simon &amp; Schuster will publish Ellen
DeGeneres' second book of comic essays--a follow-up to her 1995
bestseller, due in the fall of 2003.</TE>

<HD>The Dome's New Domain</HD>
<DH>The ArcLight center is refreshingly comfortable, if not
groundbreaking</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The new ArcLight cinema-and-retail complex at Sunset Boulevard near
Vine Street is the kind of project that has become all too rare
today: a commercial development by a mainstream corporate firm that
you can actually learn to like.</LD>
<LD>   The $100-million project, which includes a 14-screen theater,
health club, restaurant and outdoor cafe, all set around the newly
restored 1963 Cinerama Dome, breaks no new formal ground. Nor is it
brimming with new ideas.</LD>
<LD>   What it does, however, is snatch up ideas that have been floating
around in the architectural atmosphere for a decade or so and mold
them into a design that works on many levels. Crisp in its
conception, with a refreshing lack of fussiness, the project packs
some punch. And it reminds even the most disheartened critic that it
is not impossible to make everyday architecture that works.</LD>
<TE>   Designed by Gensler, a 2,000-employee international firm that is
best known for its commercial buildings, the ArcLight project had to
accommodate a number of awkward site conditions. The Welton
Becket-designed Cinerama Dome is a local landmark and could not be
significantly altered. Two Brutalist 1970s-era concrete office
buildings take up the corner of Sunset and Vine. And a local
drive-through McDonald's--its kitschy red roof floating above its
parking lot--stands along Vine. (ArcLight's developer tried to buy
out the McDonald's lease, but the fast-food restaurant's owner
refused to move.)</TE>
<TE>   In effect, Gensler simply carved space out of the square-block
development to make room for the existing buildings. The architects
set the parking in back, in a six-story concrete structure along
DeLongpre Avenue. From there, they cut a pedestrian courtyard through
the center of the block, carving out more space around one side of
the Cinerama Dome to provide access to Sunset.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the activity is set along the internal court. The new
cinemas, which feature the kind of stadium seating and big screens
that are in vogue, are tucked behind the dome on one side, with a
themed restaurant and health club on the other. (The restaurant, a
Vegas-like concoction of compartmentalized fantasies that includes a
karaoke bar, piano bar and disco, has, fortunately, yet to open.)</TE>
<TE>   The simplicity of those moves heightens the tension between new
and old structures. In back, a driveway cuts through one side of the
parking structure to make room for the McDonald's drive-through.
Along the courtyard, a collage of sago palms, red leaf bananas and
tree ferns line the base of the dome, interspersed with a series of
"water walls" that are meant to dampen the noise of the boulevard.
The swooping, curved glass facade of the restaurant and health club
frame the courtyard's other side. Its second floor tilts backward
dramatically, exaggerating the upward thrust of the dome, which
hasn't looked so pampered in years.</TE>
<TE>   The dome, in fact, remains the centerpiece. Its freshly painted
stucco shell--a rip-off of Buckminster Fuller's earlier geodesic
domes--lifts you back to an earlier era of NASA launches and Cold War
anxieties. (Which makes it an ideal place for escapist fantasies.)</TE>
<TE>   These elements come together in the courtyard, which becomes a
voyeur's haven. The new cinema lobby is nicely over-scaled and
overlooks the courtyard through a towering 40-foot-tall glass facade.
A small cafe spills out from one side of the lobby onto an outdoor
patio. Across the courtyard, gym rats peer down at the space from
their exercise bikes. In back, four glass elevators, their forms
sliding up and down like slow-moving pistons, lead to the various
parking levels.</TE>
<TE>   In short, everyone here is on display, so that going to a movie
becomes the social experience it is meant to be.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there is nothing revolutionary about this. The
pedestrian arcade is a mainstay of Hollywood theaters that dates to
the 1920s. The parking structure, with its tapestry of chain link
hanging from the exterior, is a virtual knock-off of Frank Gehry's
1979 design for Santa Monica Place. Even the notion of viewing the
city as a place of colliding forces is a well-worn contemporary
theme, one that can be traced to the early works of greater talents
like Jean Nouvel, Christian Portzamparc and Rem Koolhaas.</TE>
<TE>   What is more, there are more than a few clumsy details in the
ArcLight design. A beige faux stone wall that flanks the entry to the
cinemas looks cheap and out of place. The streamlined pink and green
signs that announce the complex along the street are tacky.</TE>
<TE>   But to denounce the project for being derivative or for lacking
refinement is to entirely miss the point. Over the last century, the
role of breaking ground in architecture has been left to a relatively
small coterie of avant-garde architects.</TE>
<TE>   Such talents drove the profession forward and reshaped the
architectural language for a rapidly changing society. In the
process, they often elevated architecture to the level of art. The
task of translating those visions into an everyday architecture for
mainstream America, however, usually fell to bigger, more established
corporate firms.</TE>
<TE>   The heyday of such corporate architecture was the 1950s and '60s,
when firms, including Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill, A.C. Martin and
Welton Becket, were able to churn out high-quality architecture at a
remarkable rate. At times, they produced legitimate masterpieces,
such as A.C. Martin's 1964 Department of Water and Power building,
one of L.A.'s great Modernist landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 20 years or so, that tradition has withered away. A
new breed of Postmodernist architects began espousing a pasted-on
neo-classical aesthetic, and their corporate clients were more than
happy to reduce architecture to the level of superficial decor.
Today, most of these designers have no sense of how to create vibrant
urban spaces anymore.</TE>
<TE>   The gargantuan TrizecHahn retail-entertainment complex at the
corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue is a typical
example. Completed last year with a whopping budget of $615 million,
its maze of indoor and outdoor shopping corridors is a cynical
attempt to trap the consumer in a frenzy of shopping. But even on
that level, it doesn't work. The effect is suffocating, and most
visitors can't wait to escape it.</TE>
<TE>   It is in that sense that Gensler's design is refreshing. The
project is not high-minded architecture. It is a mall. But it is
better than most malls today. Its human scale and blunt appeal prove
that sensitivity to urban realities and a little knowledge of current
architectural trends can go a long way in producing decent urban
space. What you get is an agreeable place to take a stroll, go on a
date, gawk at passersby and see a movie. We could use more of that.</TE>

<LD>Leave it to Denis Leary to put things into sarcastic perspective. On
the heels of Fox's "American Idol" and its ilk arrives Comedy
Central's "Contest Searchlight," a self-described documentary whose
premiere tonight at 10:30 seems too funny to be true.</LD>
<LD>   The cable channel earnestly calls it a behind-the-scenes look at
the development of a comedy series, to be directed by the winner of a
contest held by Leary's production firm. The first four episodes
focus on the creative process, to be followed in January with six
installments of the winning series, according to the media notes. If
this sounds suspiciously like "Project: Greenlight's" filmmaking
foray on HBO, it is. Or it isn't, depending on whom you ask and when.</LD>
<LD>   " 'Contest Searchlight' was a completely original idea by Denis
Leary," executive producer Jim Serpico says, just as the scene
switches to Leary swearing at his staff for dragging him into this
crazy idea. Later, Leary protests that the show is not like
"Greenlight" at all.</LD>
<TE>   But soon he and his executive-producing partner in crime (Lenny
Clarke, with whom Leary was teamed on ABC's dear departed police
comedy "The Job") are saying they were inspired by the HBO series.
"We're like the Japanese.... We steal a good idea and improve on it,"
Clarke says.</TE>
<TE>   Leary plays his acerbic, profane shtick to a T as he and his
cohorts struggle to get the project off the ground. To ease their
anxiety, they down mass quantities of the sponsoring alcoholic
beverage, another jab at "Greenlight."</TE>
<TE>   This "contest" includes 10 stereotypical semifinalists. Beautiful,
spacey Amber pitches a show about four friends--and multiple
incarnations of Jesus ("Jesi!" Leary interjects)--living in New York;
dashiki-wearing Dwight boils everything down to race; and uber-yuppie
A.D. stresses about the shame of failure.</TE>
<TE>   Everything, from the characterizations to the camerawork, is just
a bit too smooth to be considered real, but who cares when it's this
much fun?</TE>

<LD>NBC's "Law &amp; Order" franchise combined with the all-unscripted Monday
lineup led by "Dog Eat Dog" to help the network secure a second
consecutive ratings win over CBS last week, based on viewing
estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the hubbub surrounding original summer shows, CBS' "CSI:
Crime Scene Investigation" has been the most-watched program five
consecutive weeks. As a sign of how well the crime drama is
repeating, its audience last Thursday more than doubled tune-in for
the "ER" rerun that followed on NBC.</LD>
<LD>   "Monday Night Football's" preseason Hall of Fame game, meanwhile,
featuring John Madden's debut, exceeded viewing of last year's
contest by 1.5 million viewers but fell short of Dennis Miller's
heavily touted first appearance in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The game and pregame show were nevertheless ABC's lone entries
among the week's top 20.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks primarily to its twice-weekly hit "American Idol," Fox is
up 4% for the summer (which by the TV calendar officially began in
late May) versus last year.</TE>
<TE>   CBS and NBC are also near year-ago summer levels, and all three of
those networks increased viewership last week compared to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Only "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"-less ABC is experiencing a
significant decline, down 22% in its year-to-year summer average.</TE>

last week (Aug. 5-11) as compiled by Nielsen Media Research. They are
based on the average number of people who watched a program from
start to finish. Nielsen estimates there are 269 million potential
viewers in the U.S. age 2 and older. Viewership is listed in
millions.</TE>

<HD>From 'Hey, Baby' to 'Let's Settle Down'</HD>
<DH>Some recent movies and TV shows get beyond pickup lines to
deal with messy, grown-up romance</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE VALDESPINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seen any good romantic comedies lately? If so, you might have noticed
that sometimes a kiss isn't just a kiss anymore. Some of today's
characters in meet-cute scripts move toward acceptance of the messy
realities of life, as various relationship movies and TV shows take a
turn toward the topics of grown-up romance and traditional marriage.</LD>
<LD>   In "L'Ultimo Bacio" (The Last Kiss), a sexy new Italian comedy
that opens Friday, gorgeous men and women of all ages carry on
scorching affairs. But the players must also decide if it's time to
settle down, get married and have kids, or stick it out in that
long-term marriage. More directors--even from the land of Sophia
Loren and Gina Lollobrigida--seem to be passing on tales of whirlwind
romance and opting for stories of real-life love, complete with
compromises.</LD>
<LD>   Italians flocked to see "Kiss," making it the
second-highest-grossing domestic film in Italy in 2001, taking in
more than $16 million. Writer-director Gabriele Muccino, whom the New
Yorker dubbed "an apparent maestro at 35," said people recognized
themselves in it and saw it more than once. "It forces you to think
about your own life and the decisions you're going to make or have
already made," Muccino said last week by phone from Rome.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, movies have always been about boy meets girl, and they often
end with wedding bells. But now, some films and TV shows are moving
beyond concerns about dating, sex and falling in love to
soul-searching about long-term relationships.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of new movies exemplify the trend, including this
summer's surprise hit "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and the recent Hugh
Grant comedy "About a Boy." Even Kevin Smith, king of the slacker
flick, is changing his stripes with the upcoming "Jersey Girl,"
starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, about a workaholic publicist
who decides to get married and have kids when he meets the right
woman.</TE>
<TE>   Smith ("Chasing Amy," "Clerks"), said it will be interesting to
see how his young fans react to this movie, which doesn't feature his
stock characters, Jay and Silent Bob, poster boys for the
unencumbered life. "It's not about subject matter they can all
identify with," Smith said about "Jersey Girl." "But we all think
about marriage and want it, even if we're not going for the white
picket fence."</TE>
<TE>   Smith thinks some of these movies stem from directors and writers
of his generation who are turning 30. "By 11 to 13, kids are sexually
active. By your mid-20s you've done it all. By the time you're 30,
you've gone out there and tasted life. Sooner or later, it's like, 'I
tested the waters, now it's time to swim.' "</TE>
<TE>   Some of the same impulses can be seen on the small screen.
"Friends" characters are having babies and settling down. And in
HBO's "Sex and the City," girls' night out has given way to marriage
(even if failed) and single motherhood.</TE>
<TE>   The characters in "Sex and the City" are still testing the waters,
said the show's executive producer, writer-director Michael Patrick
King. The four women, growing older, are weaving more traditional
options into their alternative lifestyles.</TE>
<TE>   "They're 32 to 37 now, more or less, and there is a natural
evolution," King said about the Emmy-nominated show's fifth season.
"At 32 it's not a revolving-door date situation anymore. And at 35 is
when we made the big changes, because that's when people make moves
toward the life they think they are supposed to have."</TE>
<TE>   Life Beyond Dating</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to romance movies that go beyond dating, the mood
seems to be global. Two films released in the U.S. this year, "Late
Marriage" from Israel and "Monsoon Wedding" from India, deal with the
conflict between traditional--and in these cases, arranged--marriages
and the single life.</TE>
<TE>   It's not the end of the sexual revolution, says "Kiss" director
Muccino, it's just art reflecting life. "The last big successes in
Italian films were movies with Sophia Loren or 'Life Is Beautiful'
and 'Cinema Paradiso,' but those were set in the '40s and '50s. The
Italy I'm describing is present day and it's realistic."</TE>
<TE>   In "Kiss," the main character, Carlo (Stefano Accorsi), has a
career and a beautiful live-in lover who's become pregnant. She wants
to get married. Carlo wants to bungee jump, drink and carouse with
friends who act like 35-year-old teenagers but are becoming
increasingly uncomfortable at their late-night parties.</TE>
<TE>   Carlo's longings resonate in other films released in the last few
years. Track Hugh Grant's career as a popular romantic comedy star.
Almost every film finds the mischievous playboy confused by, yet
drawn to, meaningful relationships. In "About a Boy," he has
graduated to grappling with parenting issues in a weird way, at first
inventing a child to use single-parent gatherings as pick-up joints,
and then befriending a boy who helps him grow into a better person,
primed for relationships.</TE>
<TE>   It's not really a romantic comedy, said co-director Paul Weitz,
who went from the wild sexual shenanigans of "American Pie" (1999) to
the more complex "About a Boy." "It's odd that it was seen as a
romantic comedy, because the love interest comes into the movie about
two-thirds of the way through. It's primarily about his relationship
with this kid who becomes his friend. And he becomes, to some degree,
a surrogate father."</TE>
<TE>   Is it just a matter of age?</TE>
<TE>   That's pretty much it, says Smith, who is now married. "I wanted
to marry the woman who rocked my head and my heart and rocked me
physically. I hope she feels the same," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   In "Sex and the City," Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) considered
marriage but opted out. That she even thought about it showed how far
the show has come since the first season. Then, she and her swinging
single friends wouldn't be caught dead snatching the bouquet at a
wedding. Now, playgirl Samantha has fallen in love; Charlotte, who
had a traditional wedding, is facing life as a divorcee and Miranda
has taken on single motherhood.</TE>
<TE>   Ringleader Carrie didn't marry, even though she really cared for
the guy.</TE>
<TE>   King said it was tough not having her follow through on that
long-term relationship. "There was a struggle in the writing room
when we decided it was 'No,' because we're trying to have the
audience understand and forgive and like her."</TE>
<TE>   But viewers must have known carefree Carrie wasn't really headed
down the aisle after she practically had a chemical reaction to
trying on bridal gowns.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the longing for true romance was palpable, and if half the
fun of the romance journey is getting there, the fence-sitting
becomes increasingly important, "About a Boy's" Weitz said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that to some degree it's about decisions, and whenever
you decide something, you kill other possibilities. That's what you
have to do to make emotional commitment in romance. You can't have
all possibilities in your life, and that's an aspect of emotional
maturity."</TE>
<TE>   But once the bed is made, it doesn't stay made, said Muccino.
Partners must keep choosing each other as they weather crises and
temptations. A subplot in "The Last Kiss" involves an aging beauty,
Anna, deciding whether to stay in her marriage. She is played by
Stefania Sandrelli, an actress who starred as the young temptress in
"Divorce Italian Style" (1961).</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a matter of age, it's a matter of soul," Muccino said.
"After being in love five or six years, we get restless for what's
around the corner, and we always want to fall in love. That happens
when you are 18, 28, 48 and 58."</TE>
<TE>   So, the soul-searching goes on, in the movies and in life, Muccino
said.</TE>
<TE>   "People often get tired of their relationships, but the best bet
[for staying together] is rediscovering every day the beauty of those
close to you."</TE>

<HD>He Shows You Can Go Home Again</HD>
<DH>Art* Once rejected as an intern at San Francisco MOMA, Bay
Area native Neal Benezra is its new director at a crucial time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL J. YBARRA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>When Neal Benezra was around 10 or 12 years old, he went to the San
Francisco Museum of Art, then a spotty collection crammed into an old
building in the city's civic center. One of the museum's few
strengths was its spectacular trove of Clyfford Still canvases,
monumental abstract paintings made of jagged, slashing forms, one of
which was titled "Self Portrait." The painting fascinated Benezra.</LD>
<LD>   "My first memory of a work of art anywhere is from this museum,"
Benezra says, sitting in his new office at the current San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art. "I was completely confused but also compelled.
How could Still have called this abstract painting a self-portrait?
It remains one of my favorite paintings. A great, great painting. It
has just a tremendous amount of power."</LD>
<LD>   At one point early in his career, Benezra tried to get an
internship at San Francisco MOMA and failed. On July 29, he started
work at the museum as its director.</LD>
<TE>   Benezra takes over the institution at a critical point. In a
decade, San Francisco MOMA, helped by the city's booming high-tech
economy, has vaulted from being a regional collection housed in
rented quarters to a nationally ranked arts repository with a
landmark building and one of the most aggressive art-buying programs
in the country.</TE>
<TE>   But now the museum is facing a world that is no longer booming:
Attendance is on the wane, staffers have been laid off, and the
museum patrons who underwrote the buying spree have seen their
fortunes shrink with the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   "The next year's going to be a challenge, no question," Benezra
says. "Institutions have to readjust what are reasonable goals. We're
all struggling. It's very hard to estimate revenue right now. What we
have to focus on is creating a program that is sustainable."</TE>
<TE>   Benezra, 48, has been a curator for 20 years, most recently at the
Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., and at the
Art Institute of Chicago, where he was also deputy director, earning
a reputation for his even temperament and incisive exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a huge fan of his," says James T. Demetrion, the interim
director of the Menil Collection in Houston, who hired Benezra to
work for him at the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa and later at the
Hirshhorn. "Good eye. Good guy. He would fit in extremely well
anywhere, but San Francisco MOMA is really kind of ideal."</TE>
<TE>   Elaine McKeon, chairwoman of the San Francisco MOMA board, agrees.
"It's a great fit," she says. "Neal's very low-keyed, which is very
refreshing at this point. It's a challenging time to run a museum,
and Neal's capable of running it."</TE>
<TE>   The museum was founded in 1935, making it one of the oldest
institutions devoted to modern and contemporary art in the country.
But it wasn't until San Francisco MOMA moved into its striped Mario
Botta-designed building in downtown San Francisco in 1995 that the
museum really attracted attention. Unfortunately, most of that
attention focused on how much better the building was than the art it
displayed.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998 the museum's board hired David Ross from the Whitney
Museum of American Art in New York, where his colorful personality
and nose for controversy attracted donations and attention. Over the
next three years under Ross, San Francisco MOMA's membership and
endowment almost doubled, attendance increased, and $140 million went
to acquiring an enviable selection of artworks, including 22 pieces
by Ellsworth Kelly and 14 by Robert Rauschenberg. In an
entrepreneurial era, Ross seemed the perfect CEO for a brash museum
in the cultural capital of Silicon Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Then last August, Ross suddenly resigned. The press release
attributed the parting to different priorities. One source of
friction between Ross and the board was the fact that he had become
involved with eyestorm.com, an online seller of art. After leaving
his $400,000-a-year job at San Francisco MOMA, Ross became chairman
of eyestorm and said he wanted to make some real money. In May the
company went out of business. Earlier this year Ross became director
of the Beacon Cultural Project, an urban renewal-arts project in New
York state.</TE>
<TE>   After a seven-month search, San Francisco MOMA settled on his
replacement: Benezra, who was deputy director and a curator at the
Art Institute of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "David was a great salesman; he was very externally focused,"
McKeon, the board chairwoman says. "Neal is much more capable of
running a museum administratively. That wasn't David's strong point.
He wouldn't have been right in these times."</TE>
<TE>   Benezra was born in Oakland, the son of a high school art teacher
who was also an amateur Abstract Expressionist painter. He went to UC
Berkeley, where he studied politics and planned to go to law school,
but he decided to stay at school an extra year and pick up a second
bachelor's degree in art history. He earned a doctorate at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   He also spent three years in the early '80s working for Harry and
Mary Margaret Anderson, San Francisco Bay Area residents who
assembled one of the country's finest private collections of Modern
and contemporary art. The Anderson collection was given three floors
at San Francisco MOMA for an exhibition in 2000, fueling speculation
that the museum might someday get it as a gift.</TE>
<TE>   Working for the Andersons was an important experience for Benezra.
"I did everything," Benezra recalls. "I installed the collection,
gave tours, did writing, all kinds of things. It was wonderful. It
kept me out of the library. Art history can sometimes become just
another academic discipline."</TE>
<TE>   Benezra went on to work as a curator at the Des Moines Art Center
in Iowa, then moved to the Art Institute and then to the Hirshhorn
before rejoining the Art Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Benezra has organized shows of artists as
different as Robert Arneson, Martin Puryear, Bruce Nauman and Juan
Munoz. "I was interested in what was new and current in our culture
and world," he says. "I always gravitated toward what was new."</TE>
<TE>   With San Francisco MOMA's pipeline of shows filled into 2005,
Benezra says he has no grand plans to change anything and is still
exploring his new home.</TE>
<TE>   "All museums are different; each has a different culture,
tradition, history, dynamic," he says. "It takes some time to
understand that. Learning a collection takes time. I want to learn
the architecture as well as the collection. Learning how your
galleries work is important in learning what's possible in your
institution."</TE>
<TE>   What's possible, of course, is quickly changing. Benezra will have
to figure out how to continue growing an institution that, at least
on paper, seems to have peaked. Museum attendance hit a high in 1990,
when 732,000 people visited, and has been trailing off since then,
reaching 640,000 last year. Membership has slipped also, down to
40,000 from 43,000 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody, he says, "is straining a little right now financially.
What an institution chooses to do, it needs to do well. Museums can't
be as ambitious in terms of the numbers of projects they once took
on. The quality has to be maintained."</TE>
<TE>   But Benezra says the museum still intends to make significant
purchases and says that it remains in decent financial shape. The
museum's endowment is about $80 million, 80% of which is in stock.
The operating budget is $32 million a year, although to cut costs,
the museum put in place a hiring freeze last year and then let go a
dozen people this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to focus in on the most important things," he says,
"building this collection, adding significant works of art, pushing
us forward in time. There's a great track record here that I want to
continue: mounting shows that are important for this part of the
country but also have national and international impact. It's also
very important not to focus only on cutting-edge art but to mount
shows that have broad popular appeal and keep the audience engaged.
You want to attract them and keep them engaged. It's a great balance
if you can achieve it.</TE>
<TE>   "Modern and contemporary art doesn't always come easily to the
general public. If you really believe in what you're doing and can
communicate it, that kind of passion is infectious and it's a very
important part of what we do, not just to develop programs and make
acquisitions but to be passionate about communicating it to the
community. It's crucial.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds easy. It's not easy. That's a lifetime's ambition right
there. If one can do a good job on all three areas, you've really
done something."</TE>
<TE>   Benezra compares the Art Institute to an ocean liner and San
Francisco MOMA to a yacht that can be steered much more responsively.
Board Chairwoman McKeon adds that Benezra seems to be planning for a
long voyage.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing that he said to me was," she recalls, " 'I want this to
be my last job.'</TE>
<TE>   "When he retires, he wants to retire from SFMOMA, and that's good
news for us."</TE>

<DH>Television* 'Teletubbies' is the latest PBS kids' show to
make changes in a bid for young viewers and their remote-controlling
parents.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>First "Sesame Street," then "Barney" and now "Teletubbies": The PBS
programs for the youngest TV viewers are getting new looks in the
face of intense competition for children's attention.</LD>
<LD>   Starting in January, "Teletubbies" will be the latest to get a
face-lift, when the Public Broadcasting Service begins airing 20 new
episodes that include 10 minutes each of material that teaches
children cognitive skills such as learning numbers and shapes. The
program's videos of real-life children will also begin to feature
kids from a wider array of countries, including China, Russia and,
for the first time, the U.S. The show, which has aired on PBS since
1998, is produced by Ragdoll, which is based in Stratford-upon-Avon,
England. PBS has agreed to continue airing it through 2008.</LD>
<LD>   "Sesame Street" got an extensive makeover in the spring because
producers realized that the average age of the 33-year-old show's
audience was getting increasingly younger, to a current range of 2 to
4, and the one-hour program needed to be structured in blocks
children that young could follow. "Barney" and "Teletubbies," on the
other hand, which both appeal to the young end of the "Sesame Street"
spectrum, are making changes largely to keep the shows top-of-mind in
the eyes of the adults who control the channel-changer.</LD>
<TE>   Children won't really notice the changes because the audience for
the likes of "Teletubbies" turns over every couple of years, as
children age and move on and new ones take their places, said Alyce
Myatt, PBS' vice president of programming. But for adults, the shows
can begin to seem stale. "We want to be able to keep things fresh,"
she said. Producers, too, "get tired of doing the same thing over and
over," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a classic brand like 'Teletubbies' that this spring will
be reaching its fifth year on PBS and it's important that we remain
fresh," said David Levine, vice president of corporate and business
affairs in Ragdoll's U.S. office in New York. "It helps to spark
interest in parents."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, parents can choose from an increasing array of programming
for preschoolers on Nickelodeon, the Cartoon Network and other
networks. If they want an ad-free environment such as that of PBS,
they can turn to Noggin or TLC, whose "Ready Set Learn!" block will
add Ragdoll's "Brum," about a vintage yellow car, in the spring.
Unlike PBS, the channels are largely backed by conglomerates with
deep pockets for marketing and promotion.</TE>
<TE>   The "Teletubbies" changes, by adding more cognitive teaching, will
also address a criticism that some parents have had. The oversized,
childlike Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po frolic inside as well as
around their outdoor meadow, known as "Teletubbyland," in adventures
meant to teach the target audience of 1-and 2-year-olds about social
skills such as friendship and sharing. Not all critics of the
slow-paced, repetitive stories got the lessons; the new segments are
more overtly educational.</TE>
<TE>   Shot against a colorful flat screen, the characters still move
slowly, play games, draw shapes and count in segments "thematically
connected to reinforce the educational concept, whether it is 3 or
circle or big or small," said Levine. "This will be a bit more
accessible to parents who might not have gotten it the first time,"
he said, as well as have the likely effect of "broadening the
audience a little bit," because it is older children who are ready
for those skills. The new segments, known as "Teletubbies
Everywhere," have already been airing in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   The videos of real children, which air on the television screens
on each of the characters' tummies, will also sport a more
multicultural look. "This country has gone through terrific changes
in terms of ethnic makeup, and it's important that our children, at
the earliest ages, become world citizens," Myatt said. In the new
version of the show airing on PBS next year, the new material will be
added to the characters' traditional adventures in "Teletubbyland."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, "Barney &amp; Friends," which has also in the past had more
appeal to children than to some of their parents, is getting a new
outdoor set and a new cast of kids who interact with the stuffed
purple dinosaur. A major advertising campaign targeted at parents and
new licensed products will accompany the introduction of new
episodes, beginning on Labor Day. "Teletubbies" will also get a
licensing push in advance of the launch, with a new line of plush
toys available exclusively at Toys R Us in the fall. Past toys, which
were sold at a wider array of retailers, talked; the new dolls will
make the characters' silly sounds.</TE>
<TE>   The on-air changes to the PBS shows, Myatt said, echo what PBS is
attempting to do with some of its signature prime-time series, such
as "Mystery!," as media become more competitive. "We feel that the
kinds of programs we create and the way we create them are special
and important," she said. "But we have to be realistic and
acknowledge that the landscape today is very different than it was."</TE>

<HD>Aerospace Shares Take a Hit</HD>
<DH>Stocks: Boeing and United Technologies lead the decline
amid worries about prolonged slump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks of aerospace companies, including Boeing Co., fell sharply
Tuesday as investors fretted over the possibility that the latest
airline woes could prolong the slump for new aircraft.</LD>
<LD>   Just two days after US Airways filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines said it was overhauling
operations, including grounding 74 regional jets and delaying
delivery of 35 new aircraft.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement, along with concerns that UAL Corp.'s United
Airlines may seek similar restructuring, prompted investors to unload
stocks of Boeing and other commercial aircraft parts makers. Boeing
fell $3.27, or 8.1%, to $37.23, while United Technologies Corp., a
leading maker of jet engines, fell $5.98, or 8.7%, to $62.47. Both
trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Stocks of other aerospace firms
fell an average of about 6%.</LD>
<TE>   But aerospace analysts and company officials downplayed the effect
of the latest airline announcements and insisted that the forecast
for the commercial aircraft industry remained unchanged since the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The industry, and Boeing in particular, dramatically cut back
production and slashed jobs anticipating one of the industry's worst
slumps as travelers cut back on air travel. The level of cuts in new
orders and deferrals so far has been as expected, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts and company officials were sticking to a general
notion that orders for new aircraft would hit bottom next year and
that some upturn may start in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're seeing here is nothing new," said Tom Ryan, a Boeing
spokesman. The company has said that jet deliveries will fall by
nearly half--to about 275 in 2003 from 527 last year--with a slight
upturn in 2004. Ryan said the company is not changing that forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, American Airlines' announcement of cutbacks in jets
appeared far more dramatic than it really was, analysts said. The
airline is retiring 74 Fokker 100 jets as they come up for overhaul
over the next three years. They have become costly to maintain after
its Dutch manufacturer declared bankruptcy earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Paul H. Nisbet, an aerospace analyst with JSA Research Inc., said
aircraft stocks already were priced high for the kind of slump the
industry is experiencing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's jerking stockholders back to reality," Nisbet said. "When
something like this happens, they suddenly realize all is not rosy.
It's confirmation that the original gloomy assessments are indeed
right."</TE>
<TE>   Other analysts said the latest airline restructuring could bode
well for the aerospace industry.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually look at it as positive news," said Jon B. Kutler,
president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners Inc., a Century
City-based aerospace investment bank. "It's a positive move to get
their houses in order. The only way they can afford to buy aircraft
is to reduce their cost structure."</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit Seeks Recall of Firestone Tires</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A California lawyer filed a lawsuit demanding Bridgestone Corp.'s
U.S. unit recall 27.5 million Steeltex tires that allegedly are prone
to tread separation similar to that which led to a massive recall of
its tires two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The suit seeks class-action status. A recall could cost
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., the U.S. unit of Japan's Bridgestone, as
much as $2.75 billion.</LD>
<LD>   A spokeswoman said the Steeltex tires had been tested by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from September 2000
through April 2002, and no defects were found.</LD>

<HD>Berkshire Hathaway Sues IRS Over Bill</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the investment company headed by billionaire
Warren Buffett, said in a suit that it mistakenly has been ordered to
pay the Internal Revenue Service $16.3 million in taxes and interest.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed last week in U.S. District Court in Omaha, said
the IRS improperly classified $750 million the company borrowed in
the late 1980s. The loans were intended to help the company keep
money on hand for investments or acquisitions and weren't earmarked
for dividend-paying securities as the IRS has ruled, the suit says.</LD>
<LD>   The IRS linked the borrowed money to purchases of dividend-paying
shares in several firms, including Coca-Cola Co. and Wells Fargo &amp;
Co., the suit said. As such, the IRS denied tax deductions for
interest owed on the debt, the suit said.</LD>
<TE>   Berkshire shares rose $1,205 to $74,005 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>After months of surreptitious layoff notices, technology giant IBM
Corp. revealed that it's in the process of cutting more than 15,600
jobs, or 5% of its work force, by the end of September. Analysts had
estimated the job cuts at 10,000.</LD>
<LD>   IBM has said it was reducing its payroll, which stood at almost
320,000 employees at the end of last year, but didn't reveal the
actual figures until its filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The company cited a decline in corporate spending on
technology services. But the Armonk, N.Y.-based company is also
expected to undergo a surge in employees when it completes the
acquisition of the consulting arm of accountancy
PricewaterhouseCooopers, which employs 30,000.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of IBM closed up 13 at $71.90 on the NYSE.</LD>

<HD>Texas Orders Farmers To Restructure Rates</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Texas Department of Insurance ordered Farmers Insurance Group of
Cos. to stop what the state labeled unfair pricing practices, a move
the department says effectively freezes the company's homeowner
rates.</LD>
<LD>   The order gave Los Angeles-based Farmers 90 days to enact a new
pricing structure. The company could be fined $25,000 for every
individual harmed if it doesn't comply.</LD>
<LD>   Farmers has denied any wrongdoing, and spokesman Bill Miller said
Insurance Commissioner Jose Montemayor's actions are a "mere image of
the governor's, whose motivation was strictly political."</LD>
<TE>   Black said the department is not talking about politics, but
talking about protecting consumers.</TE>

<HD>Applied Materials Says Orders Could Drop in Next Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Applied Materials Inc., the dominant maker of microchip production
equipment, reported a quarterly profit that topped expectations, but
warned that orders could drop as much as 15% in the next quarter.</LD>
<LD>   In the company's fiscal third quarter that ended July 28, Santa
Clara, Calif.-based Applied Materials said it earned $115.2 million,
or 7 cents a share, topping the Wall Street average expectation of 5
cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   The results were virtually flat compared with a year-ago profit of
$114.9 million, or 7 cents a share.</LD>
<TE>   For the fourth quarter, Applied Materials said orders, a measure
of what customers request but have not yet received, were expected to
fall 5% to 15% from the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue, the company said, will be flat or modestly higher than
the third quarter, and earnings per share will improve.</TE>
<TE>   Third-quarter orders rose 5% to $1.78 billion from $1.69 billion
in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Orders were below the company's guidance given at the end of its
last quarter but still were above analyst expectations that were
diminished by recent industry news.</TE>
<TE>   Net sales were up 26% to $1.46 billion from the second quarter,
but down from the year-ago figure of $1.58 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were expecting a third-quarter profit in the range of 4
cents to 7 cents a share, with an average estimate of 5 cents,
according to a poll of 27 analysts by market tracker Thomson First
Call.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were expecting revenue in the range of $1.21 billion to
$1.4 billion, with an average expectation of $1.29 billion, according
to First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Applied Materials fell 3.8% to $12.95 in after-hours
trading after ending regular trading on Nasdaq at $13.46.</TE>

<HD>Scramble Is On to Certify Results</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Today is the deadline, and hundreds of
companies may file last-minute statements as anxious investors wait.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Today is C-day--as in certification day--for executives of America's
largest companies.</LD>
<LD>   By 5:30 p.m. EDT, chief executives and chief financial officers of
695 big U.S. companies must file sworn statements with the Securities
and Exchange Commission certifying that their latest quarterly and
annual financial reports are accurate.</LD>
<LD>   The deadline is likely to bring a scramble this afternoon as
scores of companies file last-minute certifications.</LD>
<TE>   As of late Tuesday, more than 300 companies had filed
declarations, according to a tally the SEC maintains on its Web site.
The agency's calculations are not up to the minute and understate the
actual number of companies that have submitted forms. Still, as many
as half or more of the certifications are expected to be submitted
today.</TE>
<TE>   The deadline has weighed on the stock market in recent weeks amid
concerns that the process of certifying financial results could
produce a flood of new revelations from companies about accounting
problems.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, that has not happened and no executives have
told the SEC that they can't certify their results, SEC spokesman
John Nester said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, investors may not be able to breathe a sigh of relief any
time soon because uncertainty will remain after the deadline passes,
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the SEC will work late tonight to update its Web tally,
it may take a day or two to officially declare which companies filed
by the deadline and which did not. Also, some companies could ask for
an automatic five-day extension, which would expire at the end of the
day Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, it won't be known until next week whether companies filed
in the correct format. The SEC required the declarations to have
specific wording, but some attorneys have sought to make changes.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because we get through Aug. 14 doesn't mean we have moved a
magic wand over the market and lifted all vestiges of corrupt
accounting," said Tobias Levkovich, strategist at Salomon Smith
Barney.</TE>
<TE>   Investors who want to see whether specific companies have filed
should first check the SEC list on its Web site at www.sec.gov.</TE>
<TE>   If a company is not shown to have filed, investors then should
check EDGAR, an SEC-run database of corporate financial filings,
which can be accessed from the SEC's home page on the Web. Investors
should look for so-called 8K forms or 10Qs.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC order requires all U.S. companies with more than $1.2
billion in annual revenue to certify their most recent quarterly and
annual financial results. That's 942 companies, but many don't have
to file their certifications until later this year because they
operate on different fiscal years.</TE>
<TE>   Today's filing deadline has become even more hectic because of the
landmark accounting reform legislation signed by President Bush on
July 30. The law, known as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires
executives of virtually all public companies to file a separate
certification beyond that required by the SEC, according to
securities attorneys. The certifications for many companies are due
today.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in certification overload," said Karl Groskaufmanis, a
partner at Fried Frank Harris Shriver &amp; Jacobson in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The second certifications caused a headache for smaller firms,
which had only about two weeks to comply with the rule. Unlike larger
firms, which were long aware of the SEC plan, smaller firms were
caught off guard about the rule applying to them and had to scramble
to comply, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It has caused a large measure of confusion among public
companies," said Steve Crimmins, a partner at Pepper Hamilton in
Washington.</TE>

<HD>CalFed Deal to Be Discussed</HD>
<DH>Banking: Community groups decide to hold their own hearing
on Citigroup's takeover after requests for a Fed hearing are
rebuffed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unable to persuade the Federal Reserve Board to hold a public hearing
on Citigroup Inc.'s proposed takeover of California Federal Bank,
community groups have scheduled their own hearing next week at a
state office building in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Questions about whether Citigroup's sub-prime lending businesses
have been fair in their treatment of people with bad credit or little
credit history probably will top the list of concerns aired at the
hearing, said hearing organizer Robert Gnaizda.</LD>
<LD>   The groups also will raise issues involving Citigroup's huge
credit card business, as well as its commitment to making residential
and small-business loans to minorities, said Gnaizda, policy director
for the Greenlining Institute, a San Francisco organization that
lobbies for improved financial services in lower-income and minority
neighborhoods.</LD>
<TE>   The hearing will be held Aug. 21 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the
Ronald Reagan State Building, 300 S. Spring St. Use of an auditorium
in the building was arranged by state Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson
(D-Culver City) and Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles), who
heads the Latino Caucus in the Assembly. Former California Supreme
Court Justice Cruz Reynoso will preside.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Federal Reserve and the Office of Thrift Supervision,
which regulates savings and loans such as CalFed, must approve the
proposed takeover.</TE>
<TE>   The Greenlining Institute had pressured both agencies to schedule
public hearings on the case, but the Office of Thrift Supervision
held its hearing behind closed doors and the Fed, while asking
Citigroup dozens of written questions about its sub-prime lending
practices, has never suggested it will hold any hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "So that's why we're holding our own," Gnaizda said. He said
Greenlining hopes to show the depth of concern felt by California
community groups and will provide transcripts of the proceedings not
only to the Fed but also to Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, who
oversees the Office of Thrift Supervision, and to legislative banking
committees and minority caucuses.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson spokeswoman Patricia Soto said the speaker wanted to
encourage public discussion of the takeover and Citigroup's
practices. While not an official state proceeding, the hearing "is
something he thought was important for the community," Soto said.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup, the nation's largest financial services company,
announced May 22 that it had agreed to buy CalFed's parent, San
Francisco-based Golden State Bancorp, for $5.8 billion in cash and
stock. The deal would give the New York bank 335 additional branches
in California and 17 in Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   In evaluating the transaction, banking regulators are required
among other things to consider whether fair-lending and equal-credit
laws are being satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup said last month that it would commit $120 billion in
loans and investments over 10 years to minority and lower-income
customers in California and Nevada. But the plan met with skepticism
from the Greenlining Institute and other groups, which said they
wanted an even bigger commitment with more specific pledges of how
the money would be distributed.</TE>
<TE>   The community groups raised their concerns at the closed-door
hearing called by the Office of Thrift Supervision last month.</TE>
<TE>   The Greenlining Institute invited Robert T. Parry, president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, to attend next week's
hearing. A spokesman said Parry wouldn't attend and noted that the
Fed's central board in Washington is considering the merger.</TE>
<TE>   Greenlining also invited Citigroup Chief Executive Sandy Weill to
open the hearing with a presentation on the benefits of the merger.
Citigroup spokesman Steve Silverman said the company hasn't decided
whether it will send a representative, noting that executives of the
company already "have had numerous meetings with Greenlining. While
we ultimately did not reach agreement with them, we went ahead and
unilaterally made a tremendous commitment to the people of California
and Nevada."</TE>

<LD>Here is the statement on interest rates issued Tuesday by the Federal
Reserve:</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target
for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1.75%.</LD>
<LD>   The softening in the growth of aggregate demand that emerged this
spring has been prolonged in large measure by weakness in financial
markets and heightened uncertainty related to problems in corporate
reporting and governance.</LD>
<TE>   The current accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with
still-robust underlying growth in productivity, should be sufficient
to foster an improving business climate over time.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the committee recognizes that, for the foreseeable
future, against the background of its long-run goals of price
stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information
currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions
that may generate economic weakness.</TE>

<HD>Board Supports Register's Owners</HD>
<DH>Media: The parent of the O.C. paper wants the younger
Hoiles generation to devise a plan for the transfer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The board of Freedom Communications Inc., parent of the Orange County
Register, said Tuesday it supported a decision reached last weekend
by the Hoiles family owners to transfer ownership of the company to
the fourth generation of family members, now in their 20s and 30s.</LD>
<LD>   But the board took no immediate action on approving any specific
plan for this ownership transfer to take place. Tom Bassett, a tax
attorney and fourth-generation Hoiles who proposed the generational
transfer idea has said it could take six to 18 months to develop and
complete such a transaction.</LD>
<LD>   The 13-member board--which includes six shareholder members of the
Hoiles family, six non-shareholding outside directors and Freedom
Chief Executive Samuel Wolgemuth--on Tuesday directed younger
Hoileses to come up with a plan and time guidelines for the best way
for the company to change hands, said Tim Hoiles, a dissident
shareholder who has pushed for a sale of the company.</LD>
<TE>   Younger shareholders have scheduled a conference call this week
with family-business expert Francois De Visscher to devise the best
course. There are an estimated 30 fourth-generation Hoileses and 15
third-generation members, mostly in their 50s.</TE>
<TE>   To raise funds to buy out the third generation, the family could
sell shares to the public, tap private equity markets or sell parts
of the business, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, after two days of intense meetings, the family decided
against selling the entire company. Despite pressure from Tim Hoiles
and the looming threat of a lawsuit, the Hoiles shareholders opted
not to sell out completely because such a step would probably cost
the family control of its businesses. Such a sale also could end the
libertarian bent of Freedom's media holdings and potentially "have a
negative impact on the continuation of various family relationships,"
according to an internal Freedom document.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hoiles has supported a sale because he thinks it would bring
the highest price and would allow him to cash out most profitably.</TE>
<TE>   Some family members want to cash out some or all of their holdings
and have been dissatisfied with their lack of liquidity.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine-based Freedom owns 28 daily newspapers, 37 weeklies and
eight television stations. Independent analysts have valued the
company at $1.5 billion to $2 billion. The company's prized
possession, the Register, ranks as the nation's 25th-largest
newspaper by circulation.</TE>
<TE>   Freedom last year had revenue of $760 million and lost about $94
million because of a tough advertising environment and the roiled
economy, said sources familiar with the results.</TE>

<HD>GM to Shift Gears, Focus on Passenger Cars</HD>
<DH>Autos: After losing ground to Japanese and German
competitors, the U.S. truck leader seeks to regain its share of the
strategically critical market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAKERSFIELD</DL>
<LD>Spurred by their success with light trucks, General Motors Corp.'s
top executives said Tuesday that they will turn their focus to
passenger cars, for which the world's largest auto maker has lost
almost 10 points of market share in the last decade.</LD>
<LD>   Having finally overtaken longtime truck leader Ford Motor Co. in
the U.S. last year, GM wants to regain lost ground in the
less-profitable but strategically critical car market.</LD>
<LD>   "Where we need to do better is passenger cars. We don't want to
accept a situation where our gains in truck penetration are offset by
losses from our cars," Vice Chairman Bob Lutz said in an interview.</LD>
<TE>   "I just can't see the world's largest auto maker abdicating a
market of 8 million passenger cars," Lutz told The Times at the
Button Willow Raceway in Bakersfield, where GM was demonstrating
several of its newest and future models.</TE>
<TE>   GM will build up its passenger-car offerings with redesigns, new
engines, new transmissions and, above all, new models.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring the new direction toward cars, GM took the
unprecedented step Tuesday evening of showing journalists 13 future
vehicles--12 of which were passenger cars. GM showed the vehicles on
condition that details not be published.</TE>
<TE>   GM has 33% of the U.S. market for light trucks--pickup trucks,
sport utility vehicles and light trucks--making it the market leader,
thanks to a series of large and mid-size pickup trucks and SUVs
introduced in the last three years by the Chevrolet, GMC, Buick and
Cadillac divisions.</TE>
<TE>   But GM's share of the U.S. passenger car market plunged from 35.9%
in 1991 to 26.9% in 2001, as competitors from Japan and Germany ate
into the Big Three's home market.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese and Korean auto makers dominate the entry-level car
market of compacts and subcompacts, and Volkswagen has made huge
gains in the middle of the passenger-car market, with Audi, BMW and
Mercedes-Benz greatly increasing their sales at the high end.</TE>
<TE>   GM will continue its efforts in the entire market as it shifts its
attention to cars, Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said.</TE>
<TE>   "The philosophy is, let's drive to have the same success in
passenger cars we've had in trucks," Wagoner said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't mean that we have any less emphasis on trucks, because
that's still important--it's still the biggest part of the market in
the U.S. and it's still the biggest profit driver," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The GM executives' comments come a week after Chrysler Group Chief
Executive Dieter Zetsche said Chrysler, which from the mid-'80s was
the most aggressive of the Big Three in shifting its product mix from
cars to trucks, would concentrate on becoming more competitive in
passenger cars.</TE>
<TE>   Ford is the best-selling passenger-car brand in the country, ahead
of No. 2 Chevrolet, and the world's second-largest auto maker says it
is intent on strengthening its car lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "While trucks and SUVs are obviously an important part of our
business and will remain key, we are equally passionate about
leadership in the car market," Chris Theodore, Ford vice president
for North American product development, said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   GM's assault on the passenger-car market will be across all
brands, said Gary Cowger, president of GM North America.</TE>
<TE>   "To be a full-line manufacturer you have to be good at both cars
and trucks," he told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Future GM vehicles include a roadster and a "crossover" SUV/car
for Cadillac, a redesigned Pontiac Grand Am, Grand Prix and
Bonneville as well as an all-new sporty Pontiac coupe, a new Buick
Regal, a seven-seater crossover for Buick and another probably for
Chevrolet, a redesigned Saturn L-series and an all-new Saturn compact
coupe and sedan, and new small-car replacements for the Chevrolet
Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire.</TE>

<HD>Sun Microsystems to Increase Its Link to Linux</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Battered by the collapse of its free-spending dot-com and
telecommunications customers, Sun Microsystems Inc. said Tuesday it
would do more to link itself to the free operating system Linux.</LD>
<LD>   A year and a half after buying a manufacturer of inexpensive
servers running Linux, Sun said it would start selling a line of
low-end servers that would give users a choice of Linux and Sun's
Solaris operating system and that use Intel Corp. microprocessors
instead of Sun's more sophisticated chips.</LD>
<LD>   Since IBM Corp. and Dell Computer Corp. have been selling servers
with Intel and Linux for more than a year, analysts said the move was
seen as a defensive one. IBM has reaped big gains in hardware sales
and consulting by pushing Linux use on its entire range of computers.
Linux servers commonly run big e-mail or other applications instead
of PC networks.</LD>
<TE>   Sun has stood alone in selling a bundle of its own software,
machines and chips. But with $628 million in losses in its last
fiscal year and a stock price just off a five-year low, Sun is
looking for new markets.</TE>
<TE>   "The company is discounting aggressively to counter increased
competition" from IBM on big machines and from Dell and others
offering smaller Intel-based computers, said Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
analyst Steven Milunovich. Merrill, which has an investment banking
relationship with Sun, rates its stock a long-term "buy."</TE>
<TE>   Sun shares fell 19 cents to $3.93 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   In a keynote speech Tuesday at the LinuxWorld convention here, Sun
Chief Executive Scott McNealy admitted waiting too long to embrace
Linux, which is popular for firms cutting costs. "We've kind of
goofed. We walked away from a market space," McNealy said.</TE>
<TE>   McNealy said Sun's technical support can help Linux acceptance "if
we bring open-source to places people are afraid of it." Like the
Java programming language controlled by Sun, Linux is controlled by
its inventor but relies on the contributions of others through the
collaborative open-source process.</TE>
<TE>   Sun and Linux have something else besides their open-source
histories in common: their shared conviction that Microsoft Corp. is
the enemy. "You are doing things that the attorney general hasn't
been able to," McNealy said.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, Linux specialists were paying close attention to
Sun's hints that it soon will do much more in the space where Linux
is weakest: the desktop PCs that almost universally run Microsoft's
Windows operating system.</TE>
<TE>   Open-source attempts to give average computer users a viable
alternative are progressing slowly, and large companies are heavily
invested in Windows systems.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its settlement with the Justice Department, Microsoft
must reveal more of how its PC systems work and how they tie in to
its server software. Theoretically, that should weaken the
connection, allowing Linux and others to control more functions on
Windows PCs while giving Linux PCs a better chance in more offices.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft hasn't revealed how the interaction data would be
released under new licensing agreements, and critics believe that
Microsoft will withhold key information or restrict its use.</TE>
<TE>   Many Linux enthusiasts are hoping that Sun will bring more of its
deep pockets and engineering talents to the desktop war, where it
already has contributed a free alternative to Microsoft applications
for word processing and spreadsheet calculations.</TE>
<TE>   The adoption of desktop operating systems "depends so much on
marketing and macro-level industry things," said Jed Unterecker, a
Linux developer with Penguin Computing in San Francisco. Sun promised
news about non-Microsoft desktops in mid-September.</TE>
<TE>   "The Linux desktop environment grew last year," said Sun software
chief Jonathan Schwartz. "It seems like it might be time to bring it
all together."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Faces Criticism Over Plans for Parking Lot in Little
Tokyo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles officials plan to purchase a 10-acre parcel in downtown
Los Angeles on the edge of Little Tokyo for $43 million to create a
large parking lot where a private developer had proposed to build
hundreds of apartments.</LD>
<LD>   The parking lot proposal, which will be reviewed by the City
Council today, is viewed by some as a practical way for the city to
bank land for other uses in the future. But some urban planners say
the plan is shortsighted and undermines efforts to increase housing
and revitalize the central city.</LD>
<LD>   "Anything that goes toward parking instead of much-needed housing
is a detriment to the city," said downtown architect Andrew Liang.
"It just seems to be a very poor sort of urban planning."</LD>
<TE>   The notion of spending a sizable chunk of citywide parking revenue
to acquire the downtown site also has raised concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe there is a parking shortage downtown but ... there are many
other parts of the city that likewise suffer from a lack of parking,"
said City Councilman Jack Weiss, who represents portions of the
Westside and San Fernando Valley. "I think we have to be wise to
spread our limited resources equitably across the city when
addressing the need for parking."</TE>
<TE>   City officials say they need the property at the northeast corner
of First and Alameda streets, the former site of the Los Angeles Soap
Co. plant, to replace about 1,000 parking spaces that will be lost
when the Art Park property is developed into a public plaza, which is
slated to include a children's museum. Parking at that location is
used primarily by city employees.</TE>
<TE>   The city considered building a parking garage underneath the Art
Park site at Temple and San Pedro streets and looked at other sites,
said Jerry Miller, who spearheaded the deal for the Office of the
Chief Legislative Analyst. The property has been vacant for more than
a decade since it was purchased by an affiliate of Taiwanese shipping
company Evergreen.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said the city has no other long-term uses planned for the
site, part of which is to be sold for a rail transit station for a
line to serve East Los Angeles. "The only current planned use is as
surface parking," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The lot purchase would be financed with money from the city's
special parking revenue fund, which pays for public parking lots,
garage maintenance and construction. The fund has been hit hard by
the much larger-than-expected deficit at the city-owned Hollywood &amp;
Highland parking garage. While the city continues to look for a
"comprehensive" solution to remedy the Hollywood &amp; Highland
shortfall, Miller said the fund has sufficient capital to finance a
purchase of the downtown site.</TE>
<TE>   News that the city planned to purchase the land surprised many
downtown observers who regarded the parcel as a prime residential
site. Several developers had expressed interest in the property, and
Atlanta-based Trammell Crow Residential was negotiating to buy a
portion of the parcel to build as many as 600 apartments when it
heard that the city had agreed to buy the same land.</TE>
<TE>   "We were dropped," said Alex Wong, a partner in Trammell Crow
Residential, one of the nation's largest apartment developers. "I
would have gladly sold a big chunk back to the city for parking ...
and would have cooperated in helping the city achieve its goal."</TE>
<TE>   Wong said his firm remains interested in developing housing in the
area and has a contract to buy a parcel across the street.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the east side [of downtown] has the best residential
feel existing in downtown today," Wong said. "It's a place where you
have live jazz, restaurants and shops open after work hours. You
don't have those things" in other parts of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Some real estate observers say there are plenty of downtown sites
and buildings suitable for residential development. The supply of
housing being built and planned might even exceed demand, said real
estate broker Mark Tarczynski at CB Richard Ellis, which is handling
the sale of the soap plant site.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still quite a bit of housing in the pipeline in downtown
Los Angeles," Tarczynski said. "Taking this housing out of the mix
makes sense."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the city's insistence that it has no long-term plans for
the site, other observers say the lot purchase could be part of a
plan to ensure that the city bureaucracy has a place to expand near
the Civic Center. Potential uses for the site include a police
headquarters and homes for city agencies now spread out in leased
space.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, parking is not the highest and best use of the
property," said downtown developer Dan Rosenfeld. "Over time, there
is no telling what future needs there might be for this property."</TE>
<TE>   Another urban planner says downtown Los Angeles has all the
surface parking lots it needs.</TE>
<TE>   "If the goal is to make a vibrant downtown, surface parking is not
the way to do it," said John Kaliski, a former principal architect
for the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency. "We should be
working beyond surface parking. We need vision."</TE>

<HD>Study Says Net Could Benefit Music Firms</HD>
<DH>Web: Sales are down because of the weak economy, report
says, but consumers are buying CDs after hearing new bands online.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the music industry decries online piracy, a research report
released Tuesday insists that the record labels' true threat is the
slumping economy--and that downloadable music could provide more than
$2 billion in new revenue over the next two years.</LD>
<LD>   The report by Forrester Research notes that the major labels blame
file-sharing networks such as Kazaa and Morpheus for music sales
slumping 6% last year, and nearly 10% this year through the end of
July.</LD>
<LD>   But blaming music fans who pirate tunes from the Internet doesn't
add up, said Josh Bernoff, the Forrester researcher who wrote the
report.</LD>
<TE>   Although people who grab music more than nine times a month off
the Net say they'll decrease their record purchases by 2%, this still
represents a relatively small chunk of music consumers and doesn't
account for the two-year drop in music sales.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the report found that consumers who rarely--or never--use
digital tools to download music purchase more than two-thirds of CDs
sold in the U.S. Bernoff asserts that limited radio playlists,
high-priced CDs and a general economic recession are far more to
blame than online pirates.</TE>
<TE>   "This is worse, a lot worse, than what you saw during the
recession in 1991," Bernoff said. "Like then, there are other
elements at work causing the slump."</TE>
<TE>   In its study, Forrester interviewed 1,000 online consumers about
their music-buying habits: how many albums they bought last year, how
many they expected to buy in the next 12 months and whether they
bought fewer CDs after downloading songs from file-sharing sites.</TE>
<TE>   The results, which record label sources declined to discuss,
showed that 13% of avid online music users say downloading decreased
their CD buying habits.</TE>
<TE>   But 39% say they bought more CDs because they found new bands--and
new music that they wanted to buy--through the file-swapping
services.</TE>
<TE>   The Recording Industry Assn. of America insisted that, regardless
of Forrester's findings, Internet downloads are undercutting music
sales.</TE>
<TE>   A soon-to-be-released study conducted by Peter D. Hart Research
Associates for the RIAA shows that among people who download more
from file-sharing services now than six months ago, "41% purchased
less music in the past six months and only 19% purchased more music
in the past six months," said Amy Weiss, a spokeswoman for the RIAA.
"By more than two to one, those who say they are downloading more say
they are purchasing less."</TE>
<TE>   The Forrester report proposes that the major labels must be more
flexible in pricing and offer online access to their entire music
back-catalogs.</TE>
<TE>   If the labels can make downloading music effortless, and make
impulse buys easy, consumers will be more likely to spend their
limited entertainment dollars on music--rather than video games,
movies or DVDs, as they do now.</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, that shift could lead to a fairly
aggressive--and, critics would say, optimistic--boost: $937 million
in U.S. in album downloads, $805 million in singles downloads and
$313 million in subscription rates by 2007.</TE>
<TE>   Major record labels have yet to give music fans as comprehensive a
selection of songs as they've been getting from pirate services for
more than three years, despite a series of improvements that make
legitimate online music services more attractive.</TE>

celebrities and created a "tangled web" of insider deals that
benefited top executives and other insiders, an independent review of
the company shows.</LD>
<LD>   The once highflying restaurant company, which counted Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Demi Moore and Sylvester Stallone as
celebrity backers, is struggling to emerge from bankruptcy protection
for a second time in two years.</LD>
<LD>   The independent examiner's report, ordered by the court at the
request of the firm's unsecured creditors who are owed $20 million,
was filed Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Orlando, Fla. The names
of celebrities who had loans forgiven weren't made public.</LD>
<TE>   The examiner, Soneet R. Kapila, criticized Planet Hollywood's
founders, Chief Executive Robert I. Earl and Keith Barrish, for being
too chummy with the celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   The celebrity backers had been given shares of Planet Hollywood
when the company went public in 1996, but many of them later wanted
to divest their shares.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid bad publicity from celebrity sales, Planet Hollywood
helped the celebrities arrange loans secured against the company's
stock. Later, the company "effectively stepped into the shoes of the
financial institution" and posted the full value of the loans, the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   Earl and Planet Hollywood's bankruptcy attorney, Scott Shuker,
said the company didn't recover the loans because they were backed by
stock that is now worthless and the loans were written off the first
time the company filed for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   A legal analysis is needed to see whether the loans constitute
fraud or whether there was management misconduct, Kapila said.</TE>
<TE>   Earl and Chief Financial Officer Tom Avallone made sweetheart
deals for themselves and others by creating arrangements between the
company and franchises that were owned or controlled by the
executives or board members, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   Earl and Shuker deny any wrongdoing.</TE>

<HD>Wal-Mart, TJX See Profits Rise</HD>
<DH>Retail: Economic uncertainty prompts consumers to shop at
discounters. Loss narrows at J.C. Penney.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and discount apparel and housewares retailer TJX
Cos. on Tuesday reported double-digit increases in quarterly profits
as consumers sought discounters in an uncertain economy.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, J.C. Penney Co. posted a loss, though far narrower than
analysts expected, on disappointing sales.</LD>
<LD>   Upscale jewelry retailer Tiffany &amp; Co., bruised by weak sales,
recorded a 9% decline in profit. But the company raised its outlook
for the rest of the year, pushing its shares up nearly 8%.</LD>
<TE>   Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, said second-quarter profit
jumped 26%, or 46 cents a share, to $2.04 billion, from $1.62
billion, or 36 cents, a year ago, beating the Thomson First Call
consensus by a penny.</TE>
<TE>   Sales grew 13% to $59.69 billion, and sales at stores open at
least a year jumped 6.4%.</TE>
<TE>   The discount giant said business slowed toward the end of the
quarter, prompting it to lower sales expectations for the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   TJX, whose chains include TJ Maxx and Marshalls, recorded a 16%
increase in second-quarter earnings to $129.63 million, or 24 cents a
share, a penny better than expected. Revenue was up 11% to $2.8
billion.</TE>
<TE>   J.C. Penney said its second-quarter loss narrowed to $6 million,
or 5 cents a share, from $69 million, or 23 cents, helped by a new
centralized buying system. Analysts expected a 10-cent loss at
Penney, the nation's second-largest department store operator.</TE>
<TE>   Penney's latest results included a $2-million restructuring credit
contrasted with a year-ago net charge of $12 million.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue edged down to $7.2 billion from $7.21 billion, short of
analysts' expectations of $7.38 billion, as sales at department
stores open at least a year fell 2.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Tiffany reported second-quarter earnings of $32.71 million, or 22
cents a share, for the second quarter, down from $36.05 million, or
24 cents, a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts had lowered their estimates to 22 cents from 24 cents
last month after Tiffany warned of profit weakness.</TE>
<TE>   Sales were up a slight 0.8% to $374 million, but same-store sales
fell 5%.</TE>
<TE>   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Wal-Mart rose 30 cents to
$48.71, TJX rose 75 cents to $18.75, Penney fell 60 cents to $16.15
and Tiffany jumped $1.63, or 7.6%, to $23.19.</TE>

<HD>Autos Fuel Increase in Retail Sales; Other Spending Stalls</HD>
<DH>Economy: The 1.2% gain is the second monthly rise in a row
as cheap financing draws buyers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. retail sales rose for a second month in July, lifted by
zero-interest financing for automobiles and by a boost in gasoline
prices.</LD>
<LD>   But excluding cars and fuel, spending was unchanged. The overall
increase masked declines in sales at retailers of appliances,
building materials, clothing, electronic goods and furniture.</LD>
<LD>   Total retail sales rose 1.2% in July after a 1.4% gain in June
that was larger than previously estimated, the Commerce Department
said Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   But "the boost in July auto sales appears to have pulled sales
away from other items," said Joseph LaVorgna, economist at Deutsche
Bank Securities in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve on Tuesday decided against cutting interest
rates to help spur new spending. But the Fed indicated it has become
more concerned about the risk of an economic slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at car and parts dealerships jumped 4.2% in July, matching
June's increase.</TE>
<TE>   The June gain was the biggest since October, when manufacturers
offered incentives to lure back buyers after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline sales rose 2.7% in the month as prices increased. The
average cost at the pump for all grades of gasoline rose to $1.44 a
gallon in July from $1.42 a gallon the previous month, according to
data from the Energy Department.</TE>
<TE>   On the down side, sales at clothing and accessory stores fell 1.3%
in July. Department stores sold 0.1% less merchandise. Sales at
electronics and appliance stores fell 1%, and furniture sales slid
1.4%, the biggest drop since September.</TE>

<HD>Sirius Results Cast Doubt on Viability</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sirius Satellite Radio Inc., which began nationwide operations last
month after numerous delays, failed to meet Wall Street expectations
Tuesday, casting doubt on the company's ability to survive.</LD>
<LD>   Sirius has only 6,510 subscribers as of Sunday and projects it
will have 75,000 by the end of the year, the company said in its
second-quarter earnings report. The company won't break even until it
has 3 million subscribers, according to the filing.</LD>
<LD>   Investment bank Ladenburg Thalmann &amp; Co., which had predicted
91,000 subscribers by year's end, downgraded the company from "buy"
to "market perform."</LD>
<TE>   "There was a lot not to like about what they had to tell us
[Tuesday]," analyst John Stone of Ladenburg Thalmann said.</TE>
<TE>   Sirius' second-quarter net loss grew to $113.3 million, or $1.62 a
share, from $62.1 million, or $1.35, a year earlier, the company
said. Revenue was $70 million. The company had no sales in the
year-ago quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the slow growth in subscribers, the big problem for
Sirius is how much money it needs to raise, Stone said. According to
the filing, Sirius has $295 million in cash, which company officials
said will take it through the second quarter of next year. Then the
company needs to raise an additional $300 million to get through
2003.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a great time to raise money. There is just not a lot
of appetite in the market today for companies that need cash to break
even," said Stone, who owns stock in Sirius. Ladenburg Thalmann
neither owns stock in nor does business with the company.</TE>
<TE>   The company is negotiating with private-equity firms Apollo
Management and Blackstone Group, holders of about $500 million of
preferred stock, about an additional investment, people familiar with
the matter said. Sirius also is talking to bondholders about
exchanging debt for equity.</TE>
<TE>   Sirius charges customers $12.95 a month for access to about 100
commercial-free radio channels.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of New York-based Sirius slid 72 cents, or 35%, to $1.35 on
Nasdaq. They have fallen 88% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Eisner Crimping His Own Style</HD>
<DH>Media: Disney's CEO is revamping the board that's been
criticized as being too supportive of him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES and RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few companies have answered to the wishes and whims of a chief
executive the way Walt Disney Co. has during Michael Eisner's 18-year
tenure.</LD>
<LD>   Disney's $1.4-billion California Adventure theme park sprouted
from notes he scratched on a legal pad. It was Eisner who chose to
duke it out in court with former Disney studio chief Jeffrey
Katzenberg, costing the company a $270-million settlement. And "Pomp
and Circumstance" made its way into the movie "Fantasia 2000" after
Eisner heard it played at his son's high school graduation.</LD>
<LD>   But now the unfettered, freewheeling management style Eisner has
enjoyed for nearly two decades appears likely to end, partly from his
own doing. Eisner promised that an ongoing revamping of the company's
16-member board of directors will make it a first-rate independent
body.</LD>
<TE>   The changes come at a delicate time for Eisner, who in the last
two weeks has been under intense criticism from two key board
members, Vice Chairman Roy E. Disney and his chief lieutenant,
Stanley P. Gold, over the firm's lagging performance.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's board has long been criticized by institutional investors
as an undemanding group unwilling to challenge him. Business Week
named Disney's board the worst in America in 1999 and 2000. Critics
have cited Eisner's numerous personal ties to directors, including
his personal lawyer, his architect, the president of the college one
of his sons attended and the principal of the elementary school once
attended by his kids.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of big institutional investors are upset with the lack of
performance and what has been felt to be too cozy a board," said
Richard Koppes, a lawyer who advises companies on corporate
governance.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring those criticisms again was Disney's disclosure Friday
that four of its independent board members had relatives who were
employed by Disney or a related company in the last year. The
practice might not be allowed under rules proposed by the New York
Stock Exchange for independent directors.</TE>
<TE>   "These latest revelations don't come as a shock to me given the
company's history in this area," said Charles Elson, director ofthe
Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner appears in no immediate danger of losing his job, sources
close to both sides agree, in part because there is a dearth of
executives who could do the job. But with ABC's critical fall season
launching next month and the company's stock hovering at an
eight-year low--it closed Tuesday at $13.77 a share, down 46 cents on
the NYSE--Eisner is under particular pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "Eisner is going to be on a shorter leash," said corporate
governance expert Nell Minow, editor of the Corporate Library. "The
era of the imperial CEO is over. That means he, like every other CEO
in America, works for shareholders and that the board is their
representative."</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of a more activist board comes amid heightened
concerns after a wave of corporate scandals at Enron Corp., WorldCom
Inc. and other firms laying blame on lax directors.The escalating
pressure from Roy Disney and Gold is a result of Disney's sagging
stock price, Eisner's failure to stem losses at ABC and a bleak
forecast issued last week for Disney's pivotal theme park business.</TE>
<TE>   Neither side is talking about the other publicly, but both sides
are privately sniping at each other.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to Gold and Roy Disney suggest that other members of
the board, such as Andrea L. Van de Kamp, a chairman of Sotheby's
West Coast, have been asking pointed questions of Eisner. Van de Kamp
did not return a phone call seeking comment. Disney sources counter
by painting Gold in particular as an isolated malcontent whose views
don't reflect the majority of the board.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Disney, nephew of Walt Disney, is the company's largest
individual shareholder. He and Gold engineered the coup that brought
Eisner in to lead what became one of the biggest corporate
turnarounds in U.S. history. A spokesman for the two men declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner would not comment. Disney spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said:
"Michael has throughout the years worked very closely with the board
and will continue to do so.... He has and will continue to operate in
ways that grow our assets and benefit our shareholders."</TE>
<TE>   Eisner has successfully taken steps to transform the image of
Disney's board over the last two years, corporate governance experts
say.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Eisner disclosed that Disney will shrink its board,
reduce the size of its committees and strengthen its independence.
Sources say at least three board members could step down because of
their age, including actor Sidney Poitier; the longest-serving board
member, Ray Watson; and former Capital Cities/ABC Chief Executive
Thomas S. Murphy. A smaller board would be expected to give
independent directors more clout in decision making.</TE>
<TE>   Other reforms have included requiring directors to own at least
$100,000 in company stock, having outside directors hold meetings
away from management and prohibiting business relationships with
board members. That included $2.2 million Disney has paid the law
firm of former Sen. George Mitchell and $1.2 million in consulting
fees paid to architect Robert A.M. Stern's firm.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner also tapped respected corporate governance guru Ira
Millstein to evaluate the company's board structure.</TE>
<TE>   Although calling him a "reluctant reformer," Business Week lauded
Eisner this year, saying he "is now showing other CEOs how to clean
up their governance messes while restoring investor trust in the
process."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Disney observers note that changing Disney's board is only
the half of it. Eisner will have to adapt as well, they add, to a job
that may not afford the kind of unwavering board support and
independence he has come to enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   "That's up to him," Minow said. "He has what it takes to do the
job right, but he has to make some changes."</TE>

<HD>Airlines Need New Routes to Profitability</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What's really wrong with major airlines, and why they can't turn a
profit?</LD>
<LD>   They're trying to operate as full-service department stores in a
Wal-Mart and Costco world. Thus, they are unprofitable because their
costs are too high and not suited to a world where consumers
increasingly expect low fares, just like shoppers increasingly expect
discount prices.</LD>
<LD>   That's why major airlines are trying furiously to cut costs. AMR
Corp.'s American Airlines is shuffling some schedules, laying off
employees and retiring old airplanes. US Airways Group filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection over the weekend after failing to
get a wage concession agreement from its machinist union employees.
And UAL Corp.'s United Airlines is pressing for a government loan, on
grounds that its losses stem in part from the disruption to travel
patterns after the Sept. 11 terror attacks.</LD>
<TE>   But for many reasons, the airlines are unlikely soon to return to
profitability. One reason is that the business has changed, and today
the lower-cost air carriers, led by Southwest Airlines Co., account
for 19% of air passenger business, says Michael E. Levine, a former
executive at three airlines and now a law professor at Yale
University.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be, if you got eight or 10 full-fare business
travelers, you could fly profitably no matter what happened. The
major airlines built their business on that model," Levine says.</TE>
<TE>   Major airline service, geared to corporate customers, offers
convenience of frequent flights, rapid connections through hub
airports, ability to change or cancel travel plans on short notice
plus meals and movies in flight. In the late 1990s, business
travelers paying fares that rose dramatically in the boom environment
made the airlines profitable.</TE>
<TE>   "But that day is gone," says Levine.</TE>
<TE>   Today full-fare business travelers account for only 20% of
passenger traffic, says Barbara Beyer, president of Avmark Inc., an
airline-consulting firm in Arlington, Va. The real mainstay of the
airlines is the leisure and vacation travelers "in the back of the
bus," Beyer says.</TE>
<TE>   That spells trouble for the major airlines because leisure and
vacation travel has been down this year, in the aftermath of Sept.
11. And to compete for the leisure traveler's business, the major
lines have had to cut fares even as they operate at costs that are
50% to 100% higher than those of Southwest, JetBlue, AirTran, Spirit,
Frontier and many other discount airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines measure their costs in available seat miles, or
ASMs--what it costs them to transport a passenger in a single seat
for one mile. Southwest's cost is 7.5 cents per ASM, compared with
11.33 cents per ASM for American, 12.06 cents for United and 13.40
cents for US Airways.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest's costs are so much lower because it does not offer the
convenience of connecting passengers through hub airports, does not
transfer baggage to other airlines and does not serve meals.
Southwest's employees are unionized but paid on different terms.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest's pilots, for example, fly 70 hours a month compared
with 50 hours a month for pilots at American and United, and
Southwest's pilots are paid by the trip--piecemeal. But the airline
flies more trips than the majors because it specializes in short
distance flights.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest has succeeded over 30 years because from the start it
offered a Wal-Mart model--with its now semiretired Chairman Herb
Kelleher boosting employee morale by turning out to handle bags on
Thanksgiving weekends--and pledging no layoffs as long as the airline
kept growing.</TE>
<TE>   But in a world of international and transcontinental air travel,
all airlines can't copy Southwest's model. How can major airlines get
their costs down and turn a profit?</TE>
<TE>   They will have to reduce capacity, says consultant Beyer. She sees
the airlines using smaller aircraft to fly many routes--a Boeing 767
rather than a 747 from Washington to London, for example. Also, there
will be less frequency of flights into and out of major airports,
Beyer predicts.</TE>
<TE>   Given the delays for security procedures at all airports, that
would be a logical move as well as a cost-cutting one, she points
out.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Beyer sees major airlines having to choose the
specialties at which they can make a profit, such as long-distance
travel or special luxury flights.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the majors have used their hub airports to try to
attract as many passengers as possible, expanding their fleets of
aircraft and filling some seats at a loss in order to compete with
the discount carriers.</TE>
<TE>   Such practices not only reduced the major airlines' profitability
but also often annoyed their target customers, the full-fare-paying
business traveler.</TE>
<TE>   In the future, as they specialize and reduce the size of their
fleets, the majors could create a shortage of airline capacity and
charge more for the available seats, Beyer says. Charging more would
go against a trend of lower fares that dates to airline deregulation
in 1978. But so what, says Beyer.</TE>
<TE>   "Air travel at cheap fares is not an entitlement," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it is equally likely that discount airlines will continue to
proliferate.</TE>
<TE>   There is a surplus of usable airplanes, some of them new, parked
in "mothballs" in the California deserts during the current downturn
in air travel. Those planes are owned mostly by aircraft-leasing
companies, such as General Electric Capital and International Lease
Finance Corp., that would be happy to see them flying and producing
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict of the industry's economics is inescapable, says
Levine, the onetime airline executive.</TE>
<TE>   "The major companies will have to really cut their costs by
slashing their commitments to unions, to hub airports, to aircraft
manufacturers," he says.</TE>
<TE>   For the present, he expects changes to be gradual. But the process
may have begun that</TE>
<TE>   will lead to a very different</TE>
<TE>   airline industry a few years from now.</TE>

<HD>Exemption for Idealab Targeted</HD>
<DH>Internet: Shareholders ask SEC to reconsider the firm's
status. They want their money back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some of Idealab Inc.'s investors asked the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Tuesday to rescind the firm's exemption from rules
governing investment companies, a move that could force the Pasadena
Internet incubator to return some of the hundreds of millions of
dollars the investors gave it.</LD>
<LD>   The move is the latest salvo in the increasingly bitter battle
between Idealab and owners of its so-called preferred shares. The
group includes more than three dozen mutual funds, investment
partnerships, companies and individuals that include Dell USA, T.
Rowe Price Science &amp; Technology fund and Travelers Insurance Group.</LD>
<LD>   In a petition filed Tuesday, the investors said Idealab executives
misled federal securities regulators two years ago when they claimed
the firm was exempt from rules governing investment companies, the
formal term for mutual funds.</LD>
<TE>   Specifically, the shareholders asked the SEC to cancel a special
exemption to the Investment Company Act of 1940 that the agency gave
Idealab in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   If the SEC finds that Idealab is really a mutual fund, the
disgruntled investors would have the right to a full refund of their
initial investment, said Skip Miller, a Century City attorney for the
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   The petition alleges that Idealab launched a "carefully
orchestrated sham" to mislead the SEC in order to get its exemption
from the law. Had the firm been classified as a mutual fund, it would
have faced a more difficult time planning an initial public stock
offering.</TE>
<TE>   Idealab had planned to go public, a key reason so many large
investors poured more than $1 billion into the company in the heyday
of Internet stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The preferred-stock investors cited an e-mail to Idealab employees
in October 2000 from founder Bill Gross and his wife, Marcia
Goodstein, the company's president. It reads: "At times over the past
year, we digressed from our original business model. We used cash to
preserve our '40 Act position (to retain over 25% ownership) in a few
companies, and we invested in some later-stage companies that are out
of our sphere of influence. Our efforts were well worth it, as last
week we received a permanent exemption from the SEC. With this issue
behind us, we have recently returned to our core strategy."</TE>
<TE>   Doug McPherson, Idealab's general counsel, said he hadn't seen the
petition, but said the e-mail was "taken completely out of context."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC, which is reviewing the filing, declined to comment on the
matter.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the disgruntled investors filed suit in state
court against Idealab to liquidate the company and recoup at least
some of their more than $700-million original investment.</TE>
<TE>   The shareholders, a diverse group that includes William Morris
Agency, Alanis Morissette producer Guy Oseary and Internet poster
girl Cindy Margolis, claim that Idealab executives are keeping the
firm alive for their personal gain.</TE>
<TE>   The investors say they want the company dissolved before its
estimated $400 million in remaining assets are spent.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Idealab said the petition was based on distortions
and fabrications, and dismissed it as an attempt to force Idealab to
settle the suit with shareholders, who own 9% of the company's voting
stock.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1996 by Gross, Idealab has helped finance dozens of
companies, including such start-ups as now-defunct EToys Inc. and
Ticketmaster Online-City Search Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Idealab's plan for success centered on reaping huge capital gains
by bringing many of its companies public and eventually offering
shares in itself.</TE>
<TE>   But the plan was dashed by the collapse of Internet stocks
beginning in 2000, as the public's appetite for Net shares
evaporated.</TE>
<TE>   At one point Idealab was valued at nearly $10 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The shareholders initially filed suit against Idealab in Los
Angeles County Superior Court in January.</TE>
<TE>   In late July, the shareholders filed a second amended complaint,
adding new charges to allegations of breach of fiduciary duty and
fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Gross has called the suit "completely and totally baseless."</TE>

<HD>Intel to Use Technology for Building Tinier Chips</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intel Corp. on Tuesday unveiled a new way to make the world's
smallest commercial transistors, a critical advance in the
manufacturing of semiconductors that run everything from mainframe
computers to hand-held gadgets.</LD>
<LD>   Intel, the largest manufacturer of chips, said the first product
made using this technology will roll out in the second half of 2003.
Code-named Prescott, the chip will have wires that are 90 nanometers
wide, about 1/1000th the width of a human hair and 30% smaller than
its current 130-nanometer standard. Eventually, Intel will use the
new standard to manufacture all of its processors.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a process that will define all of our chips for the next
couple of years," said Bill Calder, a spokesman for the Santa Clara,
Calif., semiconductor giant.</LD>
<TE>   While the semiconductor industry struggles in its worst downturn
in decades, Intel has deliberately kept up its pace of churning out
newer and faster technology. This year Intel ramped up its
research-and-development budget to $4.1 billion from $3.8 billion in
2001 despite sluggish demand.</TE>
<TE>   "Intel very much marches to its own beat," said Mark Margavicius,
research director at Gartner Inc., a technology consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Under Chief Executive Craig Barrett, Intel has focused on driving
its manufacturing process to accommodate smaller transistors and
larger silicon wafers, moves that involve enormous upfront spending
but that pay off in the long run with fabrication plants that can
produce smaller, faster and less expensive chips. Intel's
announcement is a particularly aggressive stance because its rivals
are just now advancing to 130-nanometer technology.</TE>
<TE>   "Intel is essentially saying that it's the biggest semiconductor
company in the world by a large margin, and it's leveraging that by
investing heavily in process technology and buying competitiveness,"
said Joseph Osha, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., which does not
own Intel stock or provide investment banking services for Intel.</TE>
<TE>   The new technology relies on four innovations to produce smaller,
faster chips that consume less power.</TE>
<TE>   The first involves stretching silicon, the foundation for all
chips, so that signals run faster across the chip. In stretched, or
strained, silicon, there's more space between atoms, leaving wider
"lanes" for signals to travel in, said Rob Willoner, technology
analyst with Intel.</TE>
<TE>   The second is the ability to build tinier transistors, microscopic
silicon-based switches that rapidly open and close to create the ones
and zeroes of the digital world. Smaller transistors result in faster
processing speeds because they cut down on the distance that
electronic signals must travel.</TE>
<TE>   The third is the exclusive use of copper instead of aluminum to
connect transistors. Copper is a better conductor than aluminum.</TE>
<TE>   The final innovation is a carbon-based wire insulator that helps
reduce power consumption by cutting down the drag, or capacitance, on
signal speeds.</TE>
<TE>   Intel would not comment on how much the process would improve
speeds, but such new technologies in the past have roughly doubled
chip speeds.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its considerable resources, Intel, which has $8 billion in
cash, is not immune to market forces. The company last month posted
second-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations and
announced it would cut 4,000 jobs this year through a combination of
attrition and layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, a leading industry analyst at Salomon Smith Barney
Inc., Jonathan Joseph, trimmed his estimates for Intel's
third-quarter sales and profit. Joseph predicted that sales would be
$6.44 billion, down from an earlier estimate of $6.78 billion, and
earnings per share would be 12 cents, contrasted with a previous
estimate of 14 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Intel's shares fell 83 cents to $16.70 Tuesday on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Advancements in manufacturing technology can involve billions of
dollars in new equipment, but the 90-nanometer process can be run on
75% of Intel's existing tools, helping the firm conserve cash.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge advantage for us, even if it's not great news for
the equipment providers," Calder said.</TE>

<HD>Selling Wave Follows Fed's Stay on Rates</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Late sell-off sends the Dow down 206.50 points
amid a broad-based decline. Falling prices push investors into bonds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks caved in to a late sell-off Tuesday after the Federal Reserve
left interest rates unchanged despite warning of weak economic
conditions, disappointing traders who were hoping for an immediate
cut aimed at shoring up the economy.</LD>
<LD>   The Fed warning and falling stock prices pushed nervous investors
to the Treasury market, where the benchmark long-term yield sank to a
generational low.</LD>
<LD>   "The Fed is saying the economic recovery is still intact, but
unfortunately it's a slow one, and any further weakness in equities
could dampen growth in a major way," said Mat Johnson, economist at
Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   Though the central bank's policymakers stopped short of cutting
rates, they warned that the risks posed by slowing growth now
outweigh those of inflation. That marked a shift from their prior
stance that the risks to the economy were evenly balanced between
weakness and inflation, and left the door open for future rate cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Fed is concerned, the stock traders are concerned," said
Art Bonnel, manager of the Bonnel Growth fund in San Antonio. "We
think there is a good chance the Dow could hit 5,000, or maybe less,
at which point the Fed would have to do something."</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's immediate reaction to the Fed was muted, but a
selling wave in the last hour sent the Dow Jones industrial average
down 206.50 points, or 2.4%, to 8,482.39, while the tech-oriented
Nasdaq composite index closed off 37.56 points, or 2.9%, to 1,269.28.
The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index slid 2.2% to 884.21.</TE>
<TE>   Losers swamped winners by more than 2 to 1 on both the New York
Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Volume was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, the flight to government debt sent the yield
on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note plummeting to 4.09%, from
4.21% Monday.</TE>
<TE>   That broke through the lows set in November, when the Fed was
cutting rates aggressively in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Tuesday's yield was the lowest for the 10-year note since 1963,
according to Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the 30-year T-bond also fell Tuesday, tumbling below
5% for the first time in nine months. Shorter-term yields declined as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Bond traders said some of the demand for long-term Treasuries
stemmed from fears by owners of mortgage-backed bonds that those
issues could be retired early as more homeowners refinance. To
compensate for the potential early payoff of their mortgage bonds,
some fund managers were locking in yields on Treasuries.</TE>
<TE>   In the stock market, losses Monday and Tuesday stalled a rally
that began last week in part because traders were betting on an
interest rate cut at this week's Fed meeting. The rally pushed the
S&amp;P 500 up 5.1%--its biggest weekly gain since late September--and
provided hope that the market's brutal summer sell-off might be
ending.</TE>
<TE>   That level of Fed-inspired optimism mystified some investment
pros, who questioned Tuesday whether another rate cut would have much
effect on the economy and, by extension, the stock market. They point
out that the Fed's benchmark overnight bank lending rate is already
at a 40-year low of 1.75%.</TE>
<TE>   "Rates are so low at this point, what good would another quarter
point do?" asked Carl Domino, manager of the Northern Large Cap Value
fund in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is that the economy is still expanding. It would be
quick on the trigger to be firing off another rate cut," said Frazier
Evans, senior economist for the Columbia Management Group in Boston.
"If you consider each quarter point to be a bullet, [Fed Chairman
Alan] Greenspan only has seven left."</TE>
<TE>   Domino said some stock traders "may have just been selling on the
news" Tuesday, while others may have been bailing out of the market
in fear of surprises surrounding today's deadline for more than 700
chief executives to certify their companies' financial results.</TE>
<TE>   "If you own stock in a company whose CEO doesn't sign off on his
financial statements, watch out," Domino said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the market's near-term direction, Bonnel said today's stock
trading could offer telltale clues.</TE>
<TE>   "If the market recovers, that would signal that [Tuesday's]
sell-off was simply a reaction by short-term traders to the Fed. But
if the sell-off continues that would be the fundamental investors
saying, 'Whoa, maybe the economy is weaker than we thought--we'd
better get out of this market.' "</TE>
<TE>   In other trading Tuesday, the dollar rose against the yen and
dipped against the euro. Oil and gold futures rose slightly.</TE>
<TE>   Among other market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Only two of the 30 Dow stocks finished higher. Big losers

<HD>Technicolor to Settle Sexual Harassment Lawsuit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Technicolor Videocassettes Inc. agreed Tuesday to pay $875,000 to
settle a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by 18 women who said they
endured a hostile workplace in which lewd comments, sexually explicit
pictures and groping were common. In one instance, an employee said
she was forced to perform a sexual act for her supervisor.</LD>
<LD>   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will monitor working
conditions at Technicolor for as long as three years, according to a
consent decree filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.
Technicolor, a Camarillo-based division of Thomson Multimedia, is a
leading movie industry supplier and distributor of film prints,
videocassettes, DVDs and CDs.</LD>
<LD>   Technicolor executives also agreed to provide training for
managers and employees to correct what the EEOC described as an "open
and blatant" sexually charged atmosphere throughout the company's
Camarillo facility.</LD>
<TE>   EEOC officials said the case was unusual because most companies
quickly address abuse complaints to avoid the filing of a lawsuit.
The Technicolor case also is rare, according to the EEOC, because it
involves an entertainment company.</TE>
<TE>   Although the commission receives many inquiries each year by
organizations or individuals in the entertainment industry, few
follow through with a formal complaint, said Anna Y. Park, EEOC's
regional attorney in Los Angeles. "It's a closed-lipped culture, and
people are afraid to complain because of the backlash," she said.
"People are afraid of losing their jobs. They want to work in the
industry. It is a tight community, and once you're out, you're out."</TE>
<TE>   The EEOC's Los Angeles office receives as many as 4,000 formal
complaints each year, of which only about 20 result in lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Although Technicolor agreed to settle the lawsuit and pay the
women who complained, the company did not admit liability, according
to court documents. A company representative said officials wanted to
focus on improving workplace conditions rather than on litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel this proactive approach that we've taken is more positive
for our employees and our business than protracted litigation," said
Technicolor spokeswoman Laura Barber-Miller. She declined to comment
further.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the women in the lawsuit still work at Technicolor, Park
said, although most were employed at the facility when the lawsuit
was filed in August 2001. A majority of the women received minimum
wage for factory work.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints were made about supervisors in various divisions at the
company, including those in the executive ranks, EEOC officials said.
The women said they were subjected to sexually explicit photos and
cartoons, verbal abuse and crude comments about their anatomy or
questions about their sex lives. In one incident, a supervisor forced
an employee to perform a sex act, EEOC officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very hostile environment toward women," said Debra
Prescott, 44, of Ventura. Prescott, one of the women involved in the
lawsuit, worked as a senior technical analyst until she left in
September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Prescott said she felt uncomfortable when she had to go to the
manufacturing area to fix computers because some of the men would
leer at her and make comments. The harassment didn't end there. She
said a company executive once berated her in an obscenity-filled
tirade. And she once had to fend off a male colleague who made a
forcible advance. She said she discussed the incident with her male
supervisor but they decided against reporting it.</TE>
<TE>   "We said, 'What's the point, nothing would happen.' The more you
complain, the more you are ostracized," Prescott said. "I just hope
it gets better for the women who still work there."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the women involved in the lawsuit are Latino and speak
little or no English, such as Consuelo Dimas, 22, of Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Dimas now works at a computer printer manufacturing plant where
the management doesn't tolerate vulgar comments or behavior. But her
first job was at Technicolor. She started when she was 18, and during
her four years there she worked her way up to lead line worker
preparing videocassette tapes for distribution--a job she loved
despite the often suggestive remarks by a male supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all afraid of losing our jobs," Dimas said. "We just knew
that we weren't supposed to complain."</TE>

<DH>Argentina: Residents who believe corrupt provincial
officers abducted and killed a teenager overtake and burn a police
station.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>For a month, the case of 17-year-old Diego Peralta moved the
residents of this city, becoming the most visible symbol of the crime
wave gripping recession-ravaged Argentina.</LD>
<LD>   Diego was kidnapped while headed to school July 5 and held by a
band of criminals who demanded $200,000 in ransom. His fate became a
cause celebre. Even President Eduardo Duhalde worked to win his
release.</LD>
<LD>   Late Monday, Diego's body was found in an artificial pond, still
in his blue-and-white school uniform, his throat slashed. Hours
later, friends and neighbors attacked the people they believed had
kidnapped and killed the teen: officers of the notoriously corrupt
Buenos Aires provincial police, who had to flee as the mob took over
and then set fire to their station.</LD>
<TE>   "Justice no, death penalty yes!" the rioters chanted as they
surrounded the station in El Jaguel, a suburban community.</TE>
<TE>   By early Tuesday, the rioting had spread through the surrounding
neighborhood, with local businesses looted and half a dozen police
officers injured. After a few hours, and the arrest of a handful of
residents, order was restored.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery of the body--a horrific scene replayed repeatedly on
television--sparked widespread calls Tuesday for an investigation
into police corruption and tougher measures against crime.</TE>
<TE>   Former Army Col. Aldo Rico, now mayor of suburban San Miguel in
Buenos Aires province, said the case shows that the provincial police
force has descended into "a state of near anarchy." Former President
Carlos Menem said Argentina should consider adopting the death
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   But Juan Pablo Cafiero, the security chief of Buenos Aires
province, said there was as yet no evidence of police participation
in the crime. Cafiero's deputy, Marcelo Sain, suggested that the
kidnapping and killing were part of a political plot.</TE>
<TE>   The governor of the province, Felipe Sola, is a member of the
Peronist party, and the case has proved a major embarrassment ahead
of the party's presidential primary.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicion fell upon the provincial police soon after Diego was
abducted from the taxi he was taking to school.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first officers who came to the Peralta household to
investigate was later arrested and charged with an unrelated robbery
of a local business.</TE>
<TE>   And two officers in the community's newly created anti-kidnapping
unit--which also participated in the investigation of Diego's
abduction--were later arrested and charged with kidnapping a local
youth.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks after Diego disappeared, his parents had gathered only
$2,000 in U.S. currency and 9,000 pesos--about $2,500--toward meeting
the kidnappers' demands. The family, which runs a small business
distributing soft drinks, raised the money from friends and
relatives. Following instructions from the kidnappers, Diego's father
dropped off the money at a remote bridge.</TE>
<TE>   When Diego was still not released, Buenos Aires witnessed a
protest that echoed the demonstrations held during the "dirty war" of
the 1970s and '80s: hundreds of people marching to demand the freedom
of a kidnap victim.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought they [the kidnappers] would give him back to me alive,
but instead they gave him back to me in a ditch," said Emilse
Peralta, Diego's mother.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives told reporters here that the family had for years been
the target of harassment by police officers, who would ask for bribes
as Diego and his father drove through the neighborhood selling soft
drinks.</TE>
<TE>   According to an account in the Buenos Aires daily newspaper Pagina
12, frustration with the police boiled over late Monday, hours after
the discovery of Diego's body.</TE>
<TE>   A group of neighborhood residents at first gathered at the Peralta
home to console the parents and family. Then, from inside the home, a
woman's voice could be heard shouting, "We don't want any more
corrupt police!"</TE>
<TE>   A large group of women outside picked up the chant. Then a group
of young men joined them, and both groups marched toward the police
station.</TE>
<TE>   "All of you have to die!" a woman shouted at the officers as she
threw a rock at the station. The young men turned over and set fire
to a car parked outside, then charged into the building, setting fire
to a desk and smashing computers as a television crew filmed them.</TE>
<TE>   One of the few prisoners inside the station's holding cells was
treated for smoke inhalation. Like most of the other prisoners, he
was a former policeman.</TE>

<LD>   An outraged Italian mother has gone to court after her husband
furtively named their newborn son after a prizewinning horse while
she was still in the hospital.</LD>
<TE>   "He said his wife agreed," said an official at the records office
in the small southern town of Boscotrecase, where the boy was
registered as Varenne Giampaolo.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Issues Grim Pre-Summit Report on Environment</HD>
<DH>Development: The world has less fresh water and fewer
forests, a study finds. Air pollution deaths and energy use are also
cited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Two weeks before a global environmental summit, the United Nations
painted a dismal picture Tuesday of the world's ecological condition,
with fresh water and forests becoming scarcer and air pollution and
global sea levels rising.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers of the event, which will draw more than 100 heads of
state--but not, as of now, President Bush--to Johannesburg, South
Africa, hope these grim facts will help inspire action by summit
participants.</LD>
<LD>   The goal of this summit is to create partnerships among the
participants and tangible solutions to promote sustainable
development worldwide.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a real sense of urgency," Nitin Desai, the
secretary-general of the summit, said Tuesday as he released the
report.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the information in the report substantiates well-known
trends, but some is surprising. Desai said organizers were shocked to
learn that 3 million people--from Mexico to Tanzania to India--die
annually because of air pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had a disease killing 3 million people a year, you would
treat it as an emergency that needed an urgent response," Desai said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the victims are women and children who contract acute
respiratory infections because of indoor air pollution that comes
from burning wood or animal manure, the study found. Yet most control
efforts are aimed at outdoor pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Participants in the summit, including the United States, which may
be represented by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, are hoping to
craft strategies for attacking this problem and others highlighted by
the report.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1 billion people--one-sixth of the world's
population--still lack access to safe water, the report says. Most of
them live in Asia and Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The forested areas of the world shrank by 2.4% in the 1990s.
Africa took the hardest hit, losing 7% of its forests. Deforestation
slowed in Asia, from more than 8% during the 1980s to less than 1%
during the 1990s. There was a slight increase of forested areas in
developed countries, as a result of regulatory pressure and social
activism.</TE>
<TE>   On the positive side, poverty and hunger declined in developing
countries during the last decade. The number of chronically
undernourished people decreased by 40 million to 800 million over
that period.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the bleak statistics in the report focus on the challenges
to sustainable development in the developing world. But in the
developed world, growing energy consumption presents its own
challenges, the report says. While Eastern Europe's use of energy
dropped and Western Europe's stayed steady over the last decade,
North America's consumption grew.</TE>
<TE>   North America's emissions of carbon dioxide also increased during
the period, while Japan's held steady and Europe's decreased.</TE>
<TE>   Americans are expected to continue to produce more than their
share of carbon dioxide, which scientists believe contributes to
global warming. Bush has pulled the U.S. out of the international
accord on global warming, and his plans for addressing the problem
allow increased emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Bush's counterparts in the world's other economic
powerhouses, as well as many Third World leaders, plan to attend the
Johannesburg summit. Although the White House has yet to announce its
delegation, Powell has indicated that he hopes to attend.</TE>
<TE>   The summit's U.N. sponsors did not criticize Bush's decision to
not attend, but environmental activists and others said the White
House was missing an important opportunity to show that it cares
about boosting living standards around the world--and potentially
improve its image.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government is actively involved in efforts ranging from
providing safe water to growing crops with greater yields, said James
L. Connaughton, who chairs the White House Council on Environmental
Quality.</TE>
<TE>   Its partners in the effort include other industrialized countries,
developing nations, private companies and nongovernmental groups.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to see all of those groups coming together to
leverage both resources and technical know-how to advance each of
these goals," Connaughton said.</TE>
<TE>   He stressed that Bush was firmly committed to a results-oriented
approach to attacking the world's worst environmental and health
problems. The president helped launch this approach in March at a
meeting of world leaders in Monterrey, Mexico, pledging to increase
foreign aid by 50% to $15 billion annually by 2006.</TE>

<HD>Britain to Honor Sept. 11 Victims With Garden at U.S.
Embassy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET STOBART</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Britain will commemorate the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks with a
garden planted outside the U.S. Embassy here, a Cabinet official
announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Culture, Media and Sport Minister Tessa Jowell unveiled details
for the project, which will feature two large flower beds opposite a
large oak pergola and a pillared pavilion in Grosvenor Square. The
plans show a stone centerpiece, inscribed with words of remembrance,
standing on paving stones. Yew hedges and iron railings surround the
garden.</LD>
<LD>   "Naturally we are charmed and touched that the British government
is interested in making some sort of memorial," said Lee McClenny of
the U.S. Embassy press office.</LD>
<TE>   Plans for the memorial garden were discussed with families of the
67 British victims of the Sept. 11 attacks and drawn up with the
Royal Parks Commission and landscape architects from Land Use
Consultants, a private company. The government has set aside about
$1.5 million for the project.</TE>
<TE>   Jowell also announced that an anniversary remembrance service will
be held at St. Paul's Cathedral on Sept. 11. The 50-minute ceremony
will be attended by a congregation of 2,000 invited guests, including
families of British victims, U.S. Ambassador William Farish and
leading members of the American community in Britain. Representatives
of the royal family and British government also will attend.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to avoid the acrimonious discussion that occurred here
over plans for a memorial to honor the late Princess Diana, British
officials and relatives of victims reportedly collaborated closely on
the Sept. 11 project.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Clarke, whose sister died in the terrorist attacks, told the
Press Assn.: "We will all remember those we lost in our individual
ways, but having a permanent, public memorial in central London will
act as a focal point for us."</TE>
<TE>   Last September, Grosvenor Square was flooded with mourners and
sympathizers who placed flowers or lined up to sign books of
condolence in honor of the victims.</TE>

<HD>In Afghanistan, Iranian Chides U.S.</HD>
<DH>Asia: President Khatami offers support for the Kabul
government but says Washington 'has always caused the ongoing
terrorism.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>In the first visit by an Iranian head of state to neighboring
Afghanistan in 40 years, President Mohammad Khatami threw his support
Tuesday behind the U.S.-backed government here but strongly
criticized the American approach to the global war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently referring to the ongoing hunt by U.S. troops for
remnants of Taliban and Al Qaeda forces, Khatami said that the only
justifiable reason for an international presence in Afghanistan now
is to reconstruct the war-torn nation and that violence will lead
only to more violence.</LD>
<LD>   "America has come to a misunderstanding of its power and
interests," Khatami said at a news conference at Afghan President
Hamid Karzai's palace. "Their policy is wrong to control people by
force, and this has always caused the ongoing terrorism."</LD>
<TE>   Khatami also confirmed a weekend report out of Saudi Arabia that
Iran had handed over to their government 16 Saudi nationals suspected
of being Al Qaeda members. And he indicated that Iran has deported Al
Qaeda fighters to other countries.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if we had just a little suspicion, we delivered them to
their countries, and not just Saudi Arabia," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said he
could not confirm the report that Iran had turned over the suspects.
He emphasized that Iran has so far refused to cooperate with the U.S.
on apprehending terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "With respect to the terrorists that they say they've turned in,
they've turned none in to us," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question but that they have permitted Al Qaeda to
enter their country," he added. "They are permitting Al Qaeda to be
present in their country today, and it may very well be that they,
for whatever reason, have turned over some people to other countries.
But they've not turned any to us."</TE>
<TE>   Khatami also took the opportunity Tuesday to criticize the
American government for harboring anti-Iranian activists, saying the
United States is "where terrorists have been supported or at least
kindly treated."</TE>
<TE>   For years, Washington allowed the Iranian opposition group
Moujahedeen Khalq and its political party to have offices in the
United States, despite the group's alleged links to terrorism against
the Tehran regime. The Clinton administration put the group on its
terrorism list in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "We have always fought terrorism, and our suffering from it goes
back a lot farther than the United States' suffering," Khatami said.
"Iran is no place for Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups."</TE>
<TE>   Karzai's decision to play host to the Iranian leader represented
an attempt by the new Afghan government to broaden relations with its
neighbors. Last week, Karzai was host to India's foreign minister.
Karzai, an interim president elected by a tribal council in June,
needs all the support he can get. Under the hard-line Islamic Taliban
regime, Afghanistan had hostile relations with most of its neighbors
save its patron, Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Tehran in turn wants to build strong relations because of such
shared interests as stemming the flow of narcotics from Afghanistan,
which has spawned an estimated 2 million drug addicts in Iran. Tehran
also wants to counter U.S. influence in the region. With the strong
U.S. presence now in neighboring areas--including Central Asia,
Pakistan and along the Persian Gulf coast--Iran increasingly feels
surrounded.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Karzai offered to smooth relations between Iran and
the United States, which have been rocky for two decades and
especially since President Bush called Iran part of an "axis of
evil." Afghanistan has in recent months become a place where American
and Iranian diplomats have had contact on issues of common concern,
according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   It was a remarkable scene at the presidential palace as
machine-gun-toting U.S. Special Forces soldiers assigned to protect
Karzai mingled with Iranian intelligence police guarding Khatami.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to bolstering Karzai's tenuous grip on power, the
Iranian president came to tout his nation's commitment of $500
million in aid to the Afghan regime and to celebrate the restoration
of good relations between the neighbors, who have been enemies for
most of the last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Their relations sank as the Taliban attacked Afghanistan's Shiite
Muslims, who are a minority here but whose ethnic brethren make up
the majority in Iran, said Teresita C. Schaffer, director of the
South Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington. Most Afghans are Sunni Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   After the Taliban killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist
in 1998, the Tehran government briefly massed troops at the border
and threatened to invade. During the civil strife that racked
Afghanistan in the last half of the 1990s, Iran supported the
eventually victorious Northern Alliance faction against the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Outwardly, relations between the nations' leaders now seem warm.
Khatami's visit was to reciprocate for a trip Karzai made to Iran in
the spring. Khatami promised Tuesday not to meddle in Afghan
affairs--an apparently oblique reference to many other nations'
inability to resist trying to remake Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in Iran's interest to see Afghanistan stabilize and not be a
focal point for radiating instability," Schaffer said.</TE>
<TE>   Iran has pledged to underwrite the cost of a new 70-mile road and
a bridge connecting the western Afghan city of Herat to the Iranian
border. In addition, it has promised to donate 50 buses, along with
electric power and transmission lines. Khatami also said his nation
would award thousands of scholarships to Afghans to study in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time to compensate Afghanistan for all its suffering, and
this can come only through the cooperation of the international
community," the Iranian leader said.</TE>
<TE>   Iran's promises come at a time when Japan and European countries
are under fire for not delivering on pledges made in Tokyo early this
year to provide about $2 billion in relief and development funds to
Afghanistan, which is on the economic equivalent of life support.</TE>
<TE>   With its industry shattered by two decades of war, the country has
come to rely on Iran for consumer goods, medicines and gasoline. The
Herat road will facilitate the transport of such goods.</TE>
<TE>   A grateful Karzai acknowledged Iran's support, citing cultural and
linguistic affinities between the two "brother" countries.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration, however, remains a sore point between them. During
the civil war, about 2 million Afghans fled to Iran, and Khatami's
government would like many, if not all, to return to their homeland.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations said Sunday that some refugees in Iran are not
being given a choice. The number of repatriations from Iran doubled
last week over the week before, and many returnees reported being
coerced to leave, the U.N. said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Robin Wright and Esther Schrader in Washington
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Mayor Seeks the Helm of Labor Party</HD>
<DH>Politics: Leftists are abuzz over Amram Mitzna's candidacy.
He backs immediate, unconditional talks with Palestinians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>With a chance that national elections could be held as soon as
January, the popular mayor of one of Israel's few mixed Jewish-Arab
cities announced his candidacy Tuesday for leadership of the Labor
Party, a position that would put him in the running for prime
minister.</LD>
<LD>   The move by Haifa Mayor Amram Mitzna sent a buzz of excitement
through Israel's moribund left and peace camp. Many regard him as the
only chance to save the once-powerful Labor Party from extinction.
For a change, Israelis were consumed Tuesday by election politics,
rather than the usual, daily menu of war and recession.</LD>
<LD>   Mitzna, two-term mayor of Israel's third-largest city, is the
classic hybrid that this nation produces for its political echelons:
a former general and military hero who is now a left-leaning dove.</LD>
<TE>   Polls over the weekend gave this newcomer to national politics a
huge lead over the current chairman of the Labor Party, Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer, who is defense minister in the coalition government. Key
members of the Labor Party were rushing to Mitzna's side, and an
editorial cartoon Tuesday portrayed him as a huge, bow-wrapped gift.</TE>
<TE>   But some Israelis wondered whether Mitzna would be another
flash-in-the-pan politician and noted that the enthusiasm he is
generating speaks at least partially to the desperate plight of both
the Labor Party and Israel as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   Mitzna, 57, quickly staked out positions Tuesday that distinguish
him from both Ben-Eliezer and right-wing Prime Minister Ariel Sharon,
an old foe.</TE>
<TE>   While pledging to fight terrorism "with all means available,"
Mitzna called for immediate, unconditional negotiations with the
Palestinians--even if that means talking to Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat. It's the opposite of Sharon's policy and the
one espoused by President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "I will call the Palestinians to come back to the negotiation
table, and we will talk to the one that will be elected by the
Palestinians," Mitzna said in English at a news conference at Labor
Party headquarters in Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   The current strategy, he said, "of force, and force and more
force" will not work to restore security to Israelis or bring
peace--a lesson he says he learned as head of the army's central
command during the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising, in the
late 1980s and early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   And if negotiations don't work, he said, Israel must separate
itself unilaterally from the Palestinian West Bank and Gaza Strip,
build a wall between the two peoples and evacuate most Jewish
settlements on the Palestinian side of the line.</TE>
<TE>   For all the fanfare surrounding Mitzna, many here were remembering
the brilliant but brief careers of other recent candidates--men who
seemed like political saviors, only to fare miserably when truly
tested on the campaign trail or in office. One, Ehud Barak, ousted
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the Likud Party in a landslide
in 1999--only to fall to Sharon, also of Likud, by an even greater
margin a scant 21 months later.</TE>
<TE>   "Mitzna, today's shining star, the galloping knight on a white
horse, is likely to be a former star a few months down the line,"
Nahum Barnea, Israel's dean of political commentators, wrote Tuesday
on the front page of the top-selling newspaper Yediot Aharonot.</TE>
<TE>   "The media will grow tired of him and will become grouchier.
Everything here fades in the summer sun--even fresh candidates for
prime minister."</TE>
<TE>   One difference with Mitzna, analysts noted, is that unlike several
shooting-star candidates, he is not attempting to form his own party
but rather remain within the Labor structure. That could cut both
ways, because Ben-Eliezer commands the loyalty of much of the party
machinery. Labor members will vote for a party leader in balloting
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Labor has never recovered from Barak's landslide loss to Sharon in
February 2001. The party's activists have been tainted by association
with a peace process that included Arafat and was launched by the
1993 Oslo accords--and is discredited in the eyes of Israeli public
opinion, currently dominated by center-right views. And on the left,
Labor supporters have been dismayed that the party has stayed in a
government responsible for launching massive military offensives
against the Palestinians without pursuing political solutions.</TE>
<TE>   While support for Likud continues to grow, surveys show Labor at
its lowest point in its long history, according to Israeli pollster
Rafi Smith. The interest in Mitzna, Smith said, is a direct product
of generalized disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a vacuum on the left, and they need a clean candidate,"
said Shmuel Sandler, a political scientist at Tel Aviv's Bar Ilan
University. "He's probably the best candidate at this point that they
can recruit, but I don't know if he can win. They're basically
looking for damage control."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon this week threatened to call snap elections if Labor and
other major political parties in his coalition government make good
on their threat to vote against the 2003 budget, which cuts deep into
social welfare programs and defense while preserving subsidies for
Jewish settlers. The vote is to come before parliament in October.</TE>
<TE>   Holding elections in January--one of the possibilities raised by
Sharon's aides--would move the vote 10 months ahead of schedule.
Although the budget dispute serves as a good pretext, early elections
would enable Sharon, whose own poll rankings have started to slip, to
stave off the only rival he is really concerned about, Netanyahu.</TE>
<TE>   The former prime minister has been biding his time, preparing to
make a comeback by cultivating an increasingly angry, hard-right
following.</TE>
<TE>   For Mitzna to stand a chance in Israel's cutthroat electoral
politics, analysts said, he will have to portray himself as a fresh
alternative who has also efficiently run a major city. Haifa has
about 270,000 residents, 12% of whom are Arab.</TE>

<HD>N. Korea May End Nuclear Accord</HD>
<DH>Agreement: Pyongyang threatens to withdraw from pact with
U.S. that freezes suspected weapons program in exchange for reactors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>North Korea threatened Tuesday to withdraw from a 1994 accord with
the United States under which it would freeze its suspected nuclear
weapons program in exchange for two nuclear reactors.</LD>
<LD>   To preserve the agreement, Washington must compensate for the loss
of electricity caused by the delay in building the reactors because a
power shortage has "created grave difficulties" in North Korea's
economy, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   "The reality is pushing us to the phase where we should make a
final decision to go our own way," the spokesman told the North's
official Korean Central News Agency, which was monitored in Seoul,
the South Korean capital. Pyongyang has made similar threats in the
past.</LD>
<TE>   Under the 1994 agreement, a U.S.-led international consortium was
to build two light-water reactors to meet the Communist country's
desperate need for power. In exchange, the North said it would freeze
its suspected nuclear weapons program and allow international
scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has yet to open its facilities to inspections by the
U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency and said Tuesday that it
would not do so until there had been significant progress in the
$4.6-billion reactor project.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials suspect that the North may have stockpiled enough
plutonium to make one or two atomic bombs before it froze its program
under the 1994 accord. North Korea denies doing so.</TE>
<TE>   Pyongyang's latest complaint came amid high-level talks between
the North and South in Seoul and as South Korean President Kim Dae
Jung's office announced that he will not attend a Liberation Day
ceremony Thursday because he has symptoms of pneumonia.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, 78, had been advised to rest instead of making a speech as he
usually has on the anniversary of Korea's Aug. 15, 1945, liberation
from Japan, the presidential Blue House announced.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister-designate Chang Dae Hwan is to read a speech at the
ceremony instead of the president.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>Shouting in Hebrew, "The intifada will win," a handcuffed Marwan
Barghouti, popular leader of the Palestinian uprising, entered an
Israeli civil courtroom today for the start of his murder trial.</LD>
<LD>   "Peace will be achieved by the end of the occupation. No peace, no
security, with the occupation," the bearded Barghouti, in a brown
Israeli prison uniform and surrounded by police, told reporters in
Tel Aviv District Court.</LD>
<LD>   Israel accuses Barghouti of running the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a
militant group linked to Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat's Fatah faction that has carried out suicide bombings and
other attacks that have killed scores of Israelis.</LD>
<TE>   Barghouti, Fatah's West Bank chief, says he is a political leader
and is not involved in violence.</TE>
<TE>   In another legal drama, a Supreme Court judge Tuesday issued a
15-day injunction against the deportation of three relatives of
Palestinian militants from the West Bank to the Gaza Strip while the
tribunal considers a last-ditch appeal.</TE>
<TE>   A military court had approved Monday the deportation of two men
and a woman.</TE>

<HD>Mexican Ex-President Silent About Massacre</HD>
<DH>Court: Echeverria invokes right not to testify about 1968
student slayings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Former Mexican President Luis Echeverria Alvarez invoked his
constitutional right not to be forced to testify when he missed a
Tuesday deadline to answer questions about his alleged role in a
student massacre more than 30 years ago, the attorney general's
office said.</LD>
<LD>   Echeverria, 80, who entered a hospital for a few days last week
because of a respiratory infection, had until Tuesday to answer 186
questions from a special federal prosecutor about the slaying of
students in 1968, when he was interior minister.</LD>
<LD>   Echeverria's attorney, Antonio Cuellar, had said that his client's
health was delicate and that the former president would ask for an
extension of the deadline and answer the questions when he recovered
strength.</LD>
<TE>   But the attorney general's office released a statement saying
Echeverria had lodged a formal notification that he would not answer
the questions, citing the 20th article of the Mexican Constitution,
which gives suspects the right to remain silent.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general said Echeverria had to appear personally as
soon as possible to tell officials that he was invoking his right to
remain silent.</TE>
<TE>   Echeverria, who served from 1970 to 1976, is the first sitting or
former president to testify before prosecutors as part of a criminal
case against him. He has said his conscience is clear.</TE>
<TE>   In July, a special prosecutor questioned Echeverria twice, about
the 1968 massacre and a deadly protest clampdown in 1971. Echeverria
said he would get back to the prosecutor in writing on dozens of
questions.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors of the 1968 massacre criticized Echeverria's decision
not to testify now.</TE>

<HD>Suspected Extremists Held in Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Asia: About 20 alleged members of outlawed Islamic groups
are rounded up in raids ahead of independence day ceremonies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Police have rounded up about 20 suspected members of outlawed Islamic
groups in a series of raids in Pakistan's Punjab province, an
Interior Ministry official said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The raids took place in advance of ceremonies today marking the
55th anniversary of Pakistan's independence from Britain.</LD>
<LD>   At a public gathering at a convention center in Islamabad, the
capital, marking the creation of Pakistan out of British India on
Aug. 14, 1947, President Gen. Pervez Musharraf called attacks against
Christian minorities and Western interests "shameful and despicable"
and pledged to intensify security measures throughout the country.
Those detained in the two-day roundup included Khadim Hussain Dhilon,
the secretary-general of the banned Sunni Muslim extremist group
Sipah-e-Sahaba, the Interior Ministry official said on condition of
anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the others are believed to be members of Jaish-e-Mohammed,
an Al Qaeda-linked group fighting Indian rule in Kashmir, and
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. Both groups are suspected of involvement in last
week's attacks on the Murree Christian School in Jhika Gali and on a
Christian hospital in Taxila.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks have raised fears of a new wave of terrorism in this
troubled country.</TE>
<TE>   As a sign of heightened concerns, American authorities Tuesday
closed the U.S. Embassy-sponsored library and information center in
Islamabad, citing security fears.</TE>
<TE>   Embassy spokeswoman Linda Cheatham refused to elaborate on what
kind of threat, if any, had been made against the public facility,
which is known in Pakistan as the American Center.</TE>
<TE>   The closure comes a day after the State Department reissued its
warning that U.S. citizens should defer travel to Pakistan and
suggested that Americans already here leave.</TE>
<TE>   The warning also said that the U.S. Consulate in Karachi would
remain closed indefinitely for security reasons and that "the
possibility of other threats to Americans, Christian facilities and
other civilian targets continues."</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani officials believe that Islamic extremists are planning
more attacks in reprisal for Musharraf's support for the U.S.-led war
on terrorism.</TE>

<HD>Thousands Flee Prague as Deadly Floods Persist</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Workers try to save the Czech capital's
landmarks. Torrential rains across Europe have killed at least 88
people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic</DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of Czechs fled their historic capital for higher
ground Tuesday as torrential rains turned the Vltava River into a
menacing cascade, adding to flooding that has killed at least 88
people across Europe.</LD>
<LD>   Churning toward Prague's Old Town--the heart of the capital and a
popular tourist stop--the brown, swollen Vltava inflicted the worst
flooding in more than a century on the Czech Republic. Officials said
at least nine people had died after more than a week of heavy
rainfall.</LD>
<LD>   Water engulfed Prague's historic Kampa island, flooding
architectural gems dating to the Hapsburg Empire. Volunteers gathered
around landmarks and scrambled to fill hundreds of sandbags in a
desperate bid to save the city's treasures.</LD>
<TE>   Late Tuesday, cranes worked under floodlights and in pouring rain
to pull up crushed boats, barrels and even a refrigerator, and to
help the swirling river slip past barriers. Volunteers sprayed
plastic foam into the cracks between the sandbags to prevent water
from seeping through.</TE>
<TE>   At least 40,000 residents of low-lying areas of Prague--a city of
1.2 million--were ordered to leave their homes Tuesday, and a total
of 200,000 were evacuated nationwide, Interior Minister Stanislav
Gross said.</TE>
<TE>   The 340-room Intercontinental Hotel and the Four Seasons Hotel
evacuated their guests, at the peak of the summer tourist season.</TE>
<TE>   Police evacuated the Old Town early today--a surprise move given
that authorities only hours earlier had suggested that flooding risks
for the area were diminishing. Police circled the area with
bullhorns, ordering residents to move to higher ground.</TE>
<TE>   In neighboring Austria, where at least seven people have died,
firefighters and Red Cross volunteers were stacking sandbags to hold
back parts of the swollen Danube River, which flooded Vienna's port
and some streets.</TE>
<TE>   The Danube punched through dams in the town of Ybbs in Lower
Austria province Tuesday, and emergency workers in hip boots gingerly
waded along railroad tracks, pulling out debris. The Defense Ministry
said 8,000 soldiers were battling floods in Upper Austria province
and along the Danube.</TE>
<TE>   The flooding affected an estimated 60,000 Austrians, who were
either evacuated or whose homes suffered damage, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   In Salzburg province, more than 1,000 buildings were underwater,
and in the badly flooded Danube town of Krems, residents were urged
to abandon lower floors Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Europe's flooding casualties were in Russia, where at
least 58 people were killed late last week--mostly Russian tourists
vacationing on the Black Sea who were ambushed by flood waters that
swept cars and tents out to sea.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, flood-related trouble continued Tuesday in India, with

<HD>Tension With China Defused, Taiwanese Say</HD>
<DH>Asia: Beijing was infuriated when the island's leader used
the word 'independent.' But diplomatic moves seem to have cooled that
anger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL and SONNI EFRON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>Hurried damage control by Taiwan appears to have contained the latest
flare-up in the island's troubled relations with mainland China,
Taiwanese officials say.</LD>
<LD>   By canceling a long-planned military exercise, sending a senior
official to Washington to reassure the Bush administration that
Taiwan is not moving stealthily toward independence, and taking other
steps short of apologizing, the government in Taipei appears to have
soothed tempers in Washington and Beijing.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the situation has already calmed down," said Taiwan's
chief government spokesman, Chuang Suo-hang.</LD>
<TE>   But the tension after Taiwan's president declared that the island
was a "sovereign state" was a reminder that the simmering conflict
over the island Beijing considers a renegade province could reach a
dangerous flash point in the complicated relationship among the U.S.,
China and Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   And the Bush administration's silence on the matter seems to have
fanned speculation about what the blowup might portend.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis erupted this month when Taiwanese President Chen
Shui-bian unleashed a verbal broadside that enraged mainland Chinese
authorities and clearly startled U.S. policymakers.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing a group of staunch Taiwanese nationalists in Japan on
Aug. 3 via video link, Chen rejected the idea that Taiwan might one
day be absorbed into mainland China as a quasi-autonomous region,
much like Hong Kong and Macao, "because Taiwan is an independent,
sovereign state."</TE>
<TE>   "Simply put," he added, "with Taiwan and China on each side of the
[Taiwan] Strait, each side is a country. This needs to be clear."
Chen concluded with a hint that he might back a national referendum
on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   His comments seemed to hit every sensitive button within Beijing's
Communist hierarchy, which believes that Taiwan should rightfully be
under mainland control. Chen's words carried additional weight
because they were so unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   Although his Democratic Progressive Party officially favors
independence, Chen had earlier gone out of his way to ease mainland
worries since his election more than two years ago. In his May 2000
inaugural address, he pledged to neither declare independence--unless
mainland military forces attacked the island--nor to seek a
referendum on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Chen's recent speech ended months of softer statements from both
capitals and growing signs that the two longtime adversaries were
gradually edging toward exploratory talks to open direct
telecommunication, cargo and transport links across the Taiwan
Strait. Contacts between Beijing and Taipei, always arduous, have
been virtually frozen since Chen's predecessor, Lee Teng-hui, angered
Beijing with a statement that relations between Taiwan and the
mainland should be conducted like those of two independent states.</TE>
<TE>   Just why Chen fired his verbal salvo remains unclear, although
political observers note that he has received heavy criticism from
party hard-liners for policies seen as conciliatory toward Beijing
that have yielded little in response.</TE>
<TE>   With important mayoral elections scheduled for this year and a
presidential election due in 2004, Chen may have wanted to make at
least one appeal to a constituency he has largely alienated since
taking office.</TE>
<TE>   Or, some suggest, Chen may have given in to the irresistible
temptation to "push the envelope," to see just how much independence
would be tolerated by a friendly Bush administration that has
expressed deep suspicions about China's military buildup and possible
use of force against Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the reasons, the reaction to his remarks was immediate.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing's media denounced Chen as untrustworthy, politically naive
and a man embarked on a course that would "bring Taiwan into
disaster." As Taipei's stock market plunged and Taiwan's key
ally--the United States--stammered for an explanation, Chen's
government moved swiftly to contain the damage.</TE>
<TE>   Taiwan's most senior official dealing with cross-strait relations,
Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, said that the
president's speech was not a policy shift and that the government
still favors dialogue with Beijing. Democratic Progressive Party
Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung said Chen had told a meeting of
party officials that "my comments were oversimplified and may have
caused misunderstanding."</TE>
<TE>   A long-planned but potentially provocative Taiwanese
anti-submarine military exercise was abruptly canceled, and Tsai was
dispatched to Washington in an attempt to ease U.S. concerns. And at
subsequent public appearances, including a political rally last
weekend, Chen has passed up the chance to repeat his comments.</TE>
<TE>   On the economic front, the government announced Friday that it
would begin approving applications by Taiwanese microchip producers
wanting to invest on the mainland. Although largely
symbolic--Taiwanese chip producers have tended to ignore restrictions
on such investments--the move was viewed as politically significant.</TE>
<TE>   The collective result of these actions has been a surprisingly
swift reduction in the level of tension across the strait since the
first days after Chen's speech.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts in Taipei are convinced that the timing of Chen's
comments was carefully chosen and also helped dampen reactions.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Andrew Yang, director general of the Chinese Council
of Advanced Policy Studies in Taipei, argued that Chen picked a time
when China is preoccupied with its leadership succession, the U.S. is
busy with its war on terrorism, and neither is interested in a new
spat over Taiwan. Chinese President Jiang Zemin's scheduled visit to
the U.S. this fall is another reason to avoid a confrontation over
Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts in the U.S. and Taiwan believe that Chen
deliberately kept American officials in the dark about his remarks
beforehand in order to avoid pressure from Washington to scrap them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very calculated move for Chen," said Yang. "The timing was
good for him."</TE>
<TE>   Others insist that Chen's remarks were off the cuff. Chen's
detractors say the president has long been criticized for telling
audiences whatever they want to hear, and he was speaking to
pro-independence overseas Taiwanese who have been major donors to his
party.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Chen has used virtually identical language about "one
country on either side of the strait" in his political campaigns, a
Taiwanese source said. Those remarks never raised a ruckus--because
Chen wasn't then president.</TE>
<TE>   "He was not groomed to be president," the source said. "He's still
learning."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever his intentions, Chen is likely to pay a price for his
comments in the long term, political analysts believe. His
painstaking two-year effort to convince Beijing that he is a worthy
negotiating partner has probably been eroded. China had previously
criticized "Taiwanese authorities" but until this incident had not
named Chen. Now that he has been criticized by name, it will be
harder for the mainland regime to reach any agreement with him.</TE>
<TE>   Doubts about his leadership have also surfaced in Washington. The
U.S. does not support Taiwanese independence and wants China and
Taiwan to resolve their differences peacefully.</TE>
<TE>   After China fired missiles into the strait to quash independence
leanings in 1996 and again in 1999, when former President Lee said
China and Taiwan have a "special state-to-state relationship," the
U.S. made it clear that it expected prior consultation if Taipei
intended to alter its policy.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, the Bush administration has uttered no public
criticism of the Taiwanese leadership. Not only has it refused to
confirm rumors that Tsai was reminded that Washington expected not to
be blindsided by provocative Taiwanese statements, but the State
Department declined even to confirm that Tsai had met with specific
senior U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   However, in one meeting that did take place last week, a Bush
administration official reportedly recommended to Tsai books she
should read about how countries have underestimated China's
willingness to use military force, only to be attacked.</TE>
<TE>   Another China specialist reportedly told Tsai that the Taiwanese
were overestimating the rationality of their Chinese cousins on the
politically inflammatory question of Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   Tsai met briefly with reporters but was mum on what was discussed,
except to say that she "never, never apologized."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall reported from Hong Kong and Efron from Washington.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</DL>
<LD>President Vojislav Kostunica says he opposes a U.S. request for a
bilateral deal to prevent U.S. citizens from being turned over to the
new International Criminal Court.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S., which has about 5,000 peacekeepers in the
U.N.-administered Yugoslav province of Kosovo, opposes the new court
and has approached countries to negotiate bilateral agreements to
avoid the prosecution of American personnel in their jurisdictions by
the court.</LD>
<LD>   Yugoslavia's eastern neighbor Romania this month became the first
to sign a deal with the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   Kostunica, whose predecessor, Slobodan Milosevic, is on trial for
war crimes at the U.N. tribunal in The Hague, said any agreement to
exempt people from prosecution by the new court would undermine
international law.</TE>
<TE>   His remarks reflect a widespread feeling in Yugoslavia that
Washington is applying a double standard, pressuring Belgrade to
cooperate with the Hague tribunal while it seeks to win exemptions
for its own citizens from the ICC.</TE>
<TE>   Switzerland also said it would negotiate no deal. Canada and
Norway have also shunned the idea.</TE>

<HD>American Airlines to Cut Back</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Largest U.S. carrier says it will eliminate
7,000 jobs and trim its flight schedule.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American Airlines on Tuesday unveiled a major overhaul, shrinking
itself through layoffs and flight cutbacks while changing the way it
operates at its main airports.</LD>
<LD>   The effort is designed to slash costs and stop massive financial
losses but ultimately could make flying less convenient and more
expensive for travelers, some analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's largest airline said it would eliminate 7,000 jobs,
or 6% of its work force; reduce seating capacity by 9%; ground
certain jetliners to simplify its fleet; adjust the classes of
service it offers on international routes; and attempt to smooth the
flow of planes at its hub airports at Dallas/Fort Worth and Chicago.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the chief executive of US Airways, which just entered
bankruptcy proceedings, said Tuesday that his airline also would soon
trim its flight schedule and announce layoffs. Details of the cuts
have not been worked out.</TE>
<TE>   The moves by American and US Airways--if followed by other
carriers--could bring notable changes for travelers.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers could see fewer flights, longer waits at airports,
modestly higher fares, fewer first-class seats and more restrictions
on frequent-flier miles, some analysts said. Such passenger
sacrifices might be necessary so loss-plagued airlines can reduce
costs and operate profitably, they said.</TE>
<TE>   But others said the effect on passengers could be minimal,
especially when it comes to fares. It's unclear whether most other
major carriers will match American's move, and, until American and
others dramatically pare the number of available seats, passengers
will have the clout to demand--and get--low fares, some observers
said.</TE>
<TE>   The widening use of the Internet, where both leisure and business
fliers can see nearly all the fares available, also is giving
travelers a new tool to keep a lid on fares. Donald Carty, chief
executive of American and its parent, AMR Corp., recently blamed the
airline's huge losses partly on a 15-year low in average fares.</TE>
<TE>   The cutbacks at American come in the face of a travel slump that
prompted US Airways to file for bankruptcy protection Sunday and have
fueled fears that United Airlines also may seek bankruptcy
protection.</TE>
<TE>   American and most other airlines trimmed their schedules--by 15%
to 20%--and employment because of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but
were in the process of restoring service in recent months. Demand for
tickets, however, remains in a slump and the airlines can no longer
wait for the economy to bounce back and lift their fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the stock of United parent UAL Corp. plunged Tuesday
for the second straight day amid mounting concern that the
airline--the nation's second largest--would be forced to seek its own
bankruptcy reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   The stock tumbled $1.06 a share, or 28%, to $2.74 on the New York
Stock Exchange after analyst Sam Buttrick of UBS Warburg issued a
rare "sell" recommendation on the stock.</TE>
<TE>   The "bankruptcy risks at UAL [are] now too high for us," he said
in a report to clients.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks of Boeing Co. and other aerospace firms also fell as
investors fretted that airlines' growing woes could prolong the
downturn in aircraft orders. Boeing dropped $3.27, or 8.1%, to
$37.23, and aircraft-engine maker United Technologies Corp. lost
$5.98, or 8.7%, to $62.47. Both are components of the Dow Jones
industrial average, and their slide helped the blue-chip measure
tumble 206.50 points to 8,482.39.</TE>
<TE>   American is effectively shrinking the airline to adapt to the
travel slump, fend off encroaching lower-fare rivals such as
Southwest Airlines and ensure its long-term viability.</TE>
<TE>   AMR's stock rose 38 cents Tuesday, to $8.74 a share on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   American isn't at risk for a bankruptcy filing, but it has lost
$2.8 billion over the last six quarters. The airline says its
restructuring ultimately will lead to $1.1 billion in annual cost
savings.</TE>
<TE>   They're "moves to reposition and re-size the airline in light of a
continued sluggish economy and changes in consumer flying behaviors,"
Carty said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to the fact that passengers are no longer willing
to pay the higher fares of the late-1990s, especially business
travelers who are coping with the weak economy by not flying or by
buying cheaper tickets, analysts said. Efforts by the airlines to
raise fares, and thus generate more income, have largely failed.</TE>
<TE>   The big airlines continue to provide more seats than they can
fill, which means they're utilizing more people and equipment than
they can profitably absorb. The industry lost a staggering $7 billion
last year and has racked up nearly $4 billion of losses in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   American, which long specialized in using complex fare formulas to
garner the maximum revenue it could from each passenger, is attacking
the problem on another front, by lowering its costs and becoming a
more-efficient carrier.</TE>
<TE>   That in itself isn't a new concept, but American's new formula
calls into question the viability of the "hub-and-spoke" system used
by the nation's five largest airlines, in which they funnel flights
to a few hub airports where passengers get connecting flights to
other cities. By contrast, some smaller, more profitable airlines,
such as Southwest, rely more on frequent "point-to-point" service.</TE>
<TE>   American plans to have a smoother, continuous flow of airplanes
into its headquarters hub at Dallas/Fort Worth, rather than having
dozens of its arrivals bunched together at peak hours. American said
it already has tested this new "de-peaking" system at its Chicago hub
with good results--with planes and employees used more
efficiently--and that passengers get better flight options because
flights are "spread out more evenly throughout the day."</TE>
<TE>   However, the new system could mean longer waits for passengers
making connections at those hubs.</TE>
<TE>   American also is eliminating first-class seats on certain
international flights, "which is going to make it harder to use your
frequent-flier miles to upgrade your seat" to first class, said Ray
Neidl, an analyst at investment firm Blaylock &amp; Partners.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers also might see fares start to rise if American and the
other airlines succeed in reducing their size to match the lower
passenger demand. With fewer empty seats, the carriers could attempt
to push ticket prices higher, some analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they probably will [do] some of the same things as
American, to make themselves more efficient," said Peter Raven, a
marketing professor at Seattle University who specializes in travel.
"Prices could probably inch up."</TE>
<TE>   But others disagree. "I don't think it's going to have a dramatic
impact on fares," said Terry Trippler, who runs a fare-tracking Web
site, mainly because the two biggest major airlines that are the
healthiest financially--Northwest and Continental--have shown they're
not inclined to raise fares and probably will undercut any other
major airline that tries.</TE>
<TE>   "Fares won't go up unless Northwest and Continental want them to,"
Trippler said.</TE>
<TE>   And Northwest, the No. 4 U.S. airline with hubs at its home in
Minneapolis/St. Paul and Detroit, said it isn't planning to follow
American's lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We're satisfied with the hub-and-spoke concept, and our hubs ...
work fine for Northwest," spokesman Kurt Ebenhoch said. He added that
"we have been aggressively cutting costs" in other ways since early
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Mayer, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Assn., the union
representing American's 14,000 pilots, criticized the company for
retrenching rather than finding effective ways to generate more
income, which he said is what American CEO Carty has said was needed.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been telling us it's a revenue problem," Mayer said, but
now American is pursuing "the same tried-and-true things airlines
have done for years, furlough employees and cut costs."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Peter Pae contributed to this report.</TE>

though it was too soon to cut interest rates again.</LD>
<LD>   The Fed's statement was one of several important economic focal
points Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   At his economic forum in Waco, Texas, President Bush tried to
restore investor and voter confidence. But as his guests met, the
country's biggest airline--American--announced a significant
restructuring that will lead to the loss of 7,000 jobs.</LD>
<TE>   That move came after US Airways on Sunday sought bankruptcy
protection and amid continuing speculation that the parent company of
United Airlines might have to do the same. One key analyst voiced his
concerns about a bankruptcy filing for UAL Corp., and its stock
plunged.</TE>
<TE>   For consumers, there were mixed messages in the economic news
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The airlines' actions led to speculation that fewer flights, and
less emphasis on the hub system that many airlines use, could lead to
higher air fares and longer waits for travelers. Also on the horizon,
analysts predicted: reduced first-class service and fewer
opportunities to use frequent-flier miles.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners, on the other hand, got some good news with
expectations that mortgage rates, already at 30-year lows, could
conintue to drop, analysts said. That's because some investors fled
the slumping stock market and sought a safe haven in Treasury
securities, driving yields on longer-term bonds to levels not seen
since the 1970s. Mortgage rates generally track Treasury bond yields.</TE>
<TE>   All this provided a backdrop to the discussions in Waco, where
Bush said he and his economic advisors would be getting "a report
from what I call the front lines of the American economy."</TE>
<TE>   The report was generally upbeat: Participants backed Bush's
initiatives. But the president didn't mention the American Airlines
layoffs, and Democrats continued to criticize the forum as a public
relations ploy.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark short-term
interest rate unchanged at 1.75%, a 40-year low, dashing investor
hopes for a quick cut to bolster business and consumer spending. But
in its official statement, the Fed indicated that it is now worrying
about whether the economy, hit by slow growth and increasing
unemployment, will stall.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman Alan Greenspan and his colleagues implied that they are
prepared to lower rates if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fed is effectively saying that the economy is worse than we
thought," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The central bank's tone rattled financial markets, where bonds
attracted money at the expense of stocks. The Dow Jones industrial
average sank 206.50 points, or 2.4%, to 8,482.39, though trading was
relatively subdued.</TE>
<TE>   The economy's strength in the first quarter, when real gross
domestic product surged at a 5% annualized rate, withered in the
spring. GDP growth slowed to a 1.1% rate in the second quarter,
according to the government's official estimate reported July 31.</TE>
<TE>   Many employers have been reluctant to hire workers, creating a
virtually jobless recovery so far. And layoffs continue to dominate
in some industries, such as airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Also, after a promising first quarter, orders for durable goods
fell in June; and a key manufacturing index showed that growth in the
factory sector slowed sharply in July.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the
economy, has remained a bright spot. But the government's report
Tuesday of July retail sales showed that, apart from spending on cars
and fuel, expenditures were flat. An ABC News/Money magazine poll
released Tuesday said consumer confidence fell last week to a
six-year low.</TE>
<TE>   But the economy is giving off a number of positive signals as
well. Worker productivity remains solid, the housing sector continues
to sizzle, and corporate profits have begun to recover.</TE>
<TE>   "If you size up all the numbers, the rebound is continuing. Maybe
not at the pace we'd like, but it is continuing," said Mickey Levy,
chief economist at Bank of America.</TE>
<TE>   A mixed economy has prompted a cautious response from the Fed. In
contrast to its June meeting, when the central bank's Federal Open
Market Committee expressed guarded optimism about the economy's
prospects, the 12-member group this time highlighted conditions that
threaten to squash the rebound that began in the fourth quarter of
last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed said the slowdown in demand for goods and services that
began in the spring "has been prolonged in large measure by weakness
in financial markets and heightened uncertainty related to problems
in corporate reporting and governance"--references to the accounting
scandals that helped crush the stock market in June and July.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fed is clearly worried about the economy," said economist
David Jones, president of Denver-based DMJ Advisors, who predicts the
central bank will cut its benchmark rate by half a point, to 1.25%,
by year's end. "They are ready to cut rates as an insurance policy to
keep the recovery on track," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the Fed's decision Tuesday to stand pat leaves
its target for the so-called federal funds rate at a four-decade low
of 1.75%, where it has been since December. The federal funds rate is
the cost of short-term loans among banks. That rate, in turn, is used
by banks to set the prime lending rate, to which many business and
consumer loan rates are pegged.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed slashed the federal funds rate 11 times last year, from
6.5% in January 2001, marking one of the most aggressive rounds of
cutting in the central bank's history. The moves have been widely
credited with softening the blow of last year's recession by keeping
U.S. consumers spending after the technology stock bubble burst and
business investment collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   The housing sector may get another boost soon: The average rate on
30-year mortgages fell last week to 6.31%, the lowest since
mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac began tracking rates in the early
1970s. Mortgage rates are tied to yields on long-term Treasury bonds,
and those yields are tumbling anew.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, the principal benchmark
for mortgages, fell Tuesday to 4.09% from 4.21% on Monday, and now is
the lowest since the government began regular sales of the securities
in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   The strong demand for Treasury securities reflects a number of
factors, experts said. For one, many investors believe the Fed will
indeed cut short-term rates in the fall, leaving room for longer-term
yields to decline as well.</TE>
<TE>   Also, a strong fear factor is in the market, analysts said:
Concern that the U.S. economy is faltering, and that the recovery in
stock prices that began in late July will be cut short, is driving
many investors to put their money into Treasury securities as a
safe-haven move.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly the 'flight to quality' is an issue" in yields' latest
slide, said Robert Auwaerter, a bond portfolio manager at mutual fund
giant Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed, aware that another dive in share prices could further
undermine the economic recovery by hurting consumer and business
confidence, wanted to send a signal to Wall Street on Tuesday that
the central bank is ready to ease credit again in the fall if
necessary to forestall recession, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "They do think we're going to come out of this all right," said
Louis Crandall, economist at Wrightson Associates in New York. "But
they wanted to show they're not blithely ignoring all the turmoil
around us."</TE>
<TE>   But with short-term interest rates already the lowest since John
Kennedy occupied the White House and with consumers shouldering
record amounts of debt, some economists question whether additional
rate cuts can do much to juice the recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Although monetary policy has proved effective at propping up the
housing sector, Edward Leamer, director of the UCLA Anderson
Forecast, said lower interest rates may do nothing to address other
concerns weighing on the economy, including sluggish business
investment.</TE>
<TE>   "Wall Street needs to see a significant increase in corporate
profits ... and business spending," Leamer said. "But Alan Greenspan
can't wave a magic wand and make that happen."</TE>

<HD>Missing Girl Is Recovered at L.A. Clinic; Woman Arrested</HD>
<DH>Abduction: Child is apparently unhurt. Echo Park
neighborhood erupts in cheers at news.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY MCCARTNEY and HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Almost two days after her disappearance triggered a citywide search,
4-year-old Jessica Cortez walked into a Los Angeles clinic on Tuesday
and was quickly reunited with her parents.</LD>
<LD>   Jessica's mother, Maria Hernandez, "cried hysterically" as the two
embraced, according to LAPD Acting Chief Martin Pomeroy. The girl
laughed, then cried, he said.</LD>
<LD>   The girl, "clung to her mother," Pomeroy said, and "she continued
to cling to her mother and, as of last report, is still clinging to
her mother."</LD>
<TE>   Police arrested Patricia Cornejo, 34, late Tuesday and booked her
on suspicion of kidnapping. Cornejo had been detained after she
accompanied Jessica when she appeared at the clinic at about 4:30
Tuesday afternoon, according to LAPD Lt. Don Hartwell.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no accomplices," Hartwell said late Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Police had executed search warrants at two Los Angeles locations
late Tuesday and questioned two other people.</TE>
<TE>   The head of the clinic where Jessica appeared described her as
barefoot, disheveled and confused but said she did bear any visible
signs of injury.</TE>
<TE>   "She seemed to be in good condition," Steve Rutledge, spokesman
for Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, said after doctors there had
examined the girl Tuesday evening. Jessica also met with social
workers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   News that Jessica was alive was greeted with cheers of relief by a
crowd of people who had gathered at Echo Park Lake, where the girl
had vanished Sunday evening and police had set up a command post to
direct the search.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the crowd began chanting the girl's name.</TE>
<TE>   On her knees, hands clasped in prayer, an emotional Maria Mendoza
turned to police officers and remarked, "Mission accomplished."</TE>
<TE>   "I knew she was alive," Mendoza said. "I had great faith in God."</TE>
<TE>   Another Echo Park resident, Maria Manzanero, said that "We prayed
hard, and maybe our prayers sent fear to her abductor."</TE>
<TE>   Late Tuesday evening, shortly before Jessica was transferred from
Childrens Hospital to Los Angeles County USC Medical Center, police
used a battering ram to break into an apartment south of downtown Los
Angeles in a search they said was related to the girl's
disappearance. No arrests were made.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime later, in a search of another home on 91st Street, two
men were detained for questioning. Three children at the house were
taken into protective custody.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Mangia, executive director of the St. John's Well Child Center
just off the 110 Freeway at West Adams Boulevard, said that a
well-dressed woman came in to the clinic with Jessica just after 4:30
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The girl seemed disoriented and confused and did not speak, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   She was dressed differently than when she disappeared, police
said. According to clinic workers, she was wearing a pair of
dark-green shorts and a white T-shirt. Her hair was cut haphazardly,
Mangia said.</TE>
<TE>   The woman requested an examination for the girl, but would not
identify their relationship, causing the staff to become suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   The woman would not fill out forms asking for Jessica's date of
birth, Mangia said. And clinic workers thought they recognized the
girl.</TE>
<TE>   Anxious that the woman might leave, Mangia ordered a nurse to
conduct a lengthy exam in order to hold the girl as long as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "We were not going to let her leave with the child," Mangia said.</TE>
<TE>   While the woman was in a bathroom, a nurse asked the girl her
name.</TE>
<TE>   "She said, 'My name is Jessica,' " Mangia said.</TE>
<TE>   The girl then told the nurse the woman was not her mother.</TE>
<TE>   What followed was tense episode in which staff members took
positions to block the woman's exit. Staffers had been following the
case on television, Mangia said. Police then arrived and took the
woman into custody.</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by several hundred jubilant onlookers, Acting Chief
Pomeroy announced the girl's safe recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted so badly to find Jessica. Somtimes these things end in
bad results that break our hearts, so we are glad that this search
lifted our spirits," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't rest" until those involved are in custody, Pomeroy said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, hundreds of police officers had fanned out
across northeast Los Angeles, and divers continued to search murky
Echo Park Lake as efforts to find the girl stretched into a third
day.</TE>
<TE>   The mood was somber and neighbors were increasingly pessimistic as
the hours wore on. Investigators had so little to go on that late in
the day, they were carrying out two investigations at the same
time--one a possible drowning, the other a possible kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   The drama had begun Sunday evening when Jessica's parents, Rafael
Cortez and Maria Hernandez, lost sight of her at about 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Early leads--mainly the account of her 5-year-old brother--pointed
investigators toward a drowning. But Monday, new information
suggested Jessica had been lured away by an abductor.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD then circulated a composite sketch of a suspect,
described as a dark-skinned male with a cross tattooed on his left
leg. The man had a chihuahua, and was with a little girl, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The alert triggered scores of tips from the public and generated
considerable public interest in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Pomeroy suggested that media attention may have persuaded
Jessica's abductors that they needed to "take some action to
extricate themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Jessica's parents, who are taco vendors near Echo Park, have
frequented the lake for several years, often parking their cart at
the north end of the lake, said family friend Fernanda Leon. They are
from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   But they have been beset by tragedy since their arrival, having
lost a young daughter to an accident two years earlier. Police
declined to give details.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Jessica, the couple have three other children, ages 11
months, 2 and 5. The youngest has Down's syndrome, and officials said
the couple often kept the children with them as they worked at the
park, believing the area to be safe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a pity. Why does a man like this come looking in such a
tranquil place?" said Ana Roca, who lives nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Staff writers Andrew Blankstein, Richard Winton and Jessica
Garrison,</TE>

<HD>Desperate Parents Keep Child Smuggling Alive</HD>
<DH>Immigrants: Operation broken this week is only one of many
ferrying Central American youth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN, JENNIFER MENA and T.C. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After breaking what they described as the largest child-smuggling
ring investigators had ever encountered, federal authorities face two
challenges.</LD>
<LD>   One is that the ring, which reportedly smuggled hundreds--perhaps
thousands--of children into the United States from Central America,
was only one of many regularly used by immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   The second challenge is that many desperate immigrants, legal and
otherwise, have grown dependent on these networks to reunite their
families, paying an average of $5,000 per child.</LD>
<TE>   "It's as easy as going to a travel agent," said Tony Cisneros, 25,
of El Salvador. "Within five days, you can get a trip for your child
if you have the money."</TE>
<TE>   As they announced Monday the end of the decade-old ring,
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials tried to emphasize
the danger that parents face in employing smugglers.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand this is an emotional situation, and that parents
will do anything to be reunited with their children," said Hipolito
Acosta, who directed "Operation White Fields" as head of the INS'
field office in Mexico City. "But they need to understand ... they
are literally turning over the lives of their children to smugglers
who don't really care about anything but the money."</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities said the INS, in cooperation with authorities
in Mexico, El Salvador and Guatemala, had arrested a dozen people on
suspicion of operating a child-smuggling ring they said had started
as early as 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The smugglers moved as many as 100 children a month on perilous
journeys from villages in El Salvador to suburban neighborhoods in
Southern California. Careful to avoid detection, they would take as
long as a month on trips that could be made by bus or car in as
little as three days. They led children as young as 18 months from
bus stations to dingy hotels and through desert and mountain
terrains.</TE>
<TE>   Though U.S. authorities have not substantiated allegations that
some children were sexually assaulted, they said there was no
doubting the peril.</TE>
<TE>   One child who was transported by the ring, 11-year-old Sandy
Lilibeth Chavez, described Tuesday how she slept on floors in
different houses and was given only crackers and juice to eat. Her
four-day journey from El Salvador to Los Angeles ended prematurely in
January when Mexican authorities stopped her and five other smuggled
children in Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy said she had secretly saved the $300 her father in L.A. had
sent her each month, organizing her trip north without telling him.
"I was dreaming of going to school with my brother and seeing my
father," said Sandy, whose mother disappeared nine years ago. "It
didn't bother me how I was treated on the trip. I just wanted to be
in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Sandy's father, a cake decorator and nighttime janitor, said he is
ashamed of his daughter's treatment. "She said she was treated very
badly," said Juan Chavez, who said his work permit does not allow him
to leave and re-enter the United States. The girl was returned to El
Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's announcement that 12 alleged leaders of the smuggling
ring had been arrested made front-page news throughout Central
America, where immigration to the United States has long been a
burning issue.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus Aguilar, the director of Carecen, an El Salvadoran nonprofit
organization devoted to immigration issues, said the arrests would do
little to stem the flow of children rejoining their parents in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   "It's logical, human and normal for parents to want their children
to be at their side," Aguilar said. "In criminal terms," breaking the
ring was "an important blow to the process of identifying child
traffickers. But in terms of combating the roots of the problems,
it's severely lacking. It's not going to stop the problem. It's only
going to make it more hidden and more expensive."</TE>
<TE>   Aguilar said his group has been pushing the Salvadoran government
to negotiate special U.S. immigration agreements for children
separated from families that are in the United States and attempting
to legalize their status here.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration officials from the United States and other nations
insisted that despite the presence of other smuggling rings, Monday's
announcement represented a breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   "This one has been the biggest [case] so far," said Miguel Peralta
of the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles. "We hope it will lead to
other investigations to eradicate this problem."</TE>
<TE>   The lucrative nature of smuggling was underscored earlier this
year when authorities uncovered the huge ring: One of the traffickers
allegedly threatened not only the family of one smuggled child if
they cooperated with authorities, but the U.S. ambassador to El
Salvador as well, according to documents and interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Allegedly heading the smuggling ring was Berta Rosa Parada Campos,
identified by authorities as a permanent U.S. resident who had been
deported in 1995 and in 1998 for smuggling.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other 11 people arrested--seven of them in El
Salvador--were Campos' two sons and a former daughter-in-law, Blanca
Rivas. (The English translation of Rivas' first name and Campos' last
led authorities to dub their probe "Operation White Fields.")</TE>
<TE>   The first hint of the smuggling ring came in October when INS
agents in San Salvador interviewed four children who were about to be
smuggled into Guatemala.</TE>
<TE>   Three months later, on Jan. 29, six Salvadoran children were
detained, this time at Tijuana International Airport. Accompanied by
three adults, the children were found to have been smuggled from El
Salvador on their way to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   That same day, INS officials were dispatched to a so-called drop
house in San Bernardino where they found three children who were
about to be smuggled.</TE>
<TE>   And when Mexico's federal police pressed their investigation, they
found seven more children in Mexico City waiting to be smuggled into
the United States. "That is when we were able to get the bigger
picture," said Acosta.</TE>
<TE>   Working with Guatemala's immigration office and national police,
authorities on April 5 intercepted seven buses in Guatemala City
carrying a dozen adults and 49 children, from toddlers to teens.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation found that children were smuggled in small
groups of three to six. They would leave from the San Cristobal
border, crossing in El Salvador on Fridays, when the site was
transformed into an open-air market.</TE>
<TE>   Once inside Guatemala, according to authorities, the smugglers
would move the children by buses to Guatemala City and then to the
border city of Tecun Uman. There, the children would be handed over
to Mexican smugglers who would take them from Mexico City to Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, another group of smugglers would transport the children
into the United States, where they allegedly would be kept at the San
Bernardino home of Campos' daughter until the parents made the final
payment.</TE>
<TE>   Immigrant parents often turn to smugglers because they have used
them in years past to come here.</TE>
<TE>   Sonia Villas, 35, a Los Angeles factory worker, had used a
smuggler, also known as a coyote, to enter the United States in 1993
from El Salvador. She said she had been abandoned by her husband and
left with two small children. She wound up a shoeless beggar in L.A.,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   After nearly eight years, she paid a man she only knew as Carlo, a
coyote, to bring her daughters here. She would pay him $1,700 to take
her 14-year-old daughter, Raquel, from El Salvador to Mexico, and
then she would send an additional $1,500 to cross from Mexico into
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Raquel arrived in Mexico after several nights in which she and
about five other teenagers slept outside. They had little to eat. One
day, Raquel ate nothing.</TE>
<TE>   When the group arrived in Oaxaca--the southern tip of Mexico--the
deal turned sour.</TE>
<TE>   Carlo said he would not take Raquel farther if Villas did not pay
him an additional $900. She sent the money. When the group arrived in
Mexico City, he asked for $800 more.</TE>
<TE>   "I was heartbroken, but I said 'Leave her there.' I have no more
money to give you," said Villas, who earns $225 a week in the
factory. "I told my daughter [on the phone to] go to a church. I
can't help you more,"</TE>
<TE>   For days, she heard nothing. She cried to relatives and friends.
Her daughter eventually telephoned her and, with the aid of another
coyote, was able to journey to Los Angeles, but the emotional scar
was deep for the mother.</TE>
<TE>   She said she doesn't dare try to bring her other daughter here.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have not lived through the anguish of missing your
children, you can't understand why I did what I did," Villas said.</TE>
<TE>   Ismael Rodriguez, executive director of the San Salvador-based
Institute to Protect Children, on Tuesday applauded the crackdown for
sending a message that child trafficking is unacceptable, no matter
how understandable.</TE>

<HD>Bar Assn. Assails U.S. on Detainees</HD>
<DH>Rights: Lawyer group demands to know why immigrants held
after 9/11 have no counsel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The American Bar Assn., the nation's largest lawyers' group, on
Tuesday condemned the government's secret detention of hundreds of
immigrants after Sept. 11, demanding to know who has been held and
why many detainees have not received legal representation.</LD>
<LD>   In Norfolk, Va., meanwhile, a federal judge also sharply
criticized the Bush administration, saying it has mistreated a U.S.
citizen, Yaser Esam Hamdi, by detaining him for months without
charges or access to a lawyer.</LD>
<LD>   The administration, the Pentagon and the Justice Department have
staunchly defended their actions, saying the secret detentions were
needed because the nation is at war with an unseen enemy: terrorists
who aim to strike again and are hiding within the U.S. borders.</LD>
<TE>   The Justice Department, for instance, has appealed last week's
ruling that it release the names of more than 1,100 people detained
since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, arguing
that doing so would put the nation at risk of additional terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But the ABA, which has 408,000 members, and U.S. District Judge
Robert Doumar in Norfolk, expressed significant objections Tuesday to
the administration's detainee policies, suggesting that the
government was trampling the rights of immigrants and U.S. citizens
alike in waging its self-described war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The association, which consists of prosecutors, defense attorneys,
judges and legal experts, wields enormous influence in Washington and
in legal circles throughout the country. It issued its resolution at
its annual conference in Washington after a short debate and voice
vote.</TE>
<TE>   "It is essential that we not tamper with the most fundamental
freedoms," said Esther F. Larden, a Georgetown University law
professor who heads the ABA's Coordinating Committee on Immigration
Law. "At the most difficult times, when our freedoms are tested, we
speak out to preserve the rule of law, to preserve our core values
and to preserve our national heritage."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson attended the meeting at a
packed downtown hotel but did not address the group. Several lawyers
spoke in defense of the government, but the legal body appeared to
support the resolution overwhelmingly.</TE>
<TE>   The ABA formally opposed the "incommunicado detention of foreign
nationals in undisclosed locations" and urged that the constitutional
and legal rights of immigrants be protected.</TE>
<TE>   It also issued a series of recommendations for the Justice
Department and its Immigration and Naturalization Service.</TE>
<TE>   The ABA said authorities should immediately disclose the names,
detention facilities and charges against detainees, and ensure their
immediate access to lawyers. Also, it said the government should
promptly charge detainees or release them, and provide them with
prompt hearings before immigration judges "with meaningful
administrative review and oversight."</TE>
<TE>   It also urged the government to hold public hearings in detainee
cases, except in rare instances in which the nation's security is
believed to be at risk if information about terrorist plots is
disclosed. The group also urged the INS to create a set of standards
regarding the detention of such immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Immigrants were swept up by the hundreds in the dragnet that
followed the Sept. 11 attacks, when the FBI and other law enforcement
agents interviewed thousands of people and chased leads all over the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those detained remained in federal detention facilities
long after authorities had determined that they played no role in
Sept. 11 or any other terrorist conspiracy. Such detentions, and the
secrecy in which the detainees were held, prompted an outcry from a
broad array of civil and human rights groups, as well as legal and
constitutional scholars, and led to a lawsuit against the government.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler in Washington ruled
that the government must turn over the names of the detainees, saying
there was no justification for such blanket secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all of the detainees have been released from custody. Most
already have been deported for immigration violations, and none has
been charged with involvement in terrorist acts or conspiracies.</TE>
<TE>   In a related measure, the ABA delayed deliberation of a proposed
recommendation on the government's classification of Americans as
enemy combatants.</TE>
<TE>   So far, only two U.S. citizens are believed to be held by the
military as combatants: Hamdi and Jose Padilla, who is accused of
conspiring with members of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network to
detonate a low-level radioactive, or "dirty," bomb in the U.S. Both
men are being held without charges or access to attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   In Hamdi's case, the federal judge in Norfolk said Tuesday that he
was "concerned" that the government was trying to "punish" Hamdi,
perhaps in an effort to pressure him into talking.</TE>
<TE>   Hamdi has been held in solitary confinement since his capture in
Afghanistan, where the government alleges he was an armed soldier in
the Taliban army.</TE>
<TE>   Doumar has already given the government a deadline to turn over
information to justify its continued detention of Hamdi, who was born
in Louisiana but moved at a young age to Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   The government has refused to do so, saying Doumar does not have
the right to review anything but one declaration from a U.S. official
as to why Hamdi has been classified as an enemy combatant.</TE>
<TE>   Doumar repeatedly sided with Hamdi on Tuesday. During a two-hour
hearing, he said, for instance, that the government's declaration
said Hamdi was only "associated" with the Taliban, not fighting with
them.</TE>
<TE>   Separately Tuesday, Dennis W. Archer, a former mayor of Detroit,
became the first African American president-elect of the ABA, which
until 1943 banned membership by blacks. Archer, 60, a former Michigan
Supreme Court justice, is a past president of the competing National
Bar Assn., which was founded in 1925 by African American lawyers who
were refused membership in the ABA.</TE>
<TE>   The group also chose another black lawyer, Robert Grey Jr. of
Richmond, Va., to succeed Archer as president in 2004.</TE>

<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   The death of a 28-year-old runner in this year's Boston Marathon
was caused by a critical sodium imbalance brought on in part by
drinking too much fluid, according to the state medical examiner.</LD>
<TE>   Cynthia Lucero died of hyponatremic encephalopathy, which happens
when the brain becomes swollen because of an imbalance of sodium, the
medical examiner said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a relatively rare, catastrophic complication," said Dr.
Ronenn Roubenoff, associate professor of medicine and nutrition at
Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center at Tufts University.</TE>
<TE>   Friends said Lucero drank large amounts of Gatorade and looked
well for most of the April 16 race.</TE>

<LD>   A woman snatched a month-old baby from a van in an Abilene store
parking lot and drove away as the child's horrified mother held on
desperately to the getaway vehicle, police said.</LD>
<TE>   The mother was dragged more than 30 feet as the car sped away. She
was later treated for cuts and bruises, police Sgt. Kim Vickers said.</TE>
<TE>   The mother had just placed her three children, including a 2-and a
6-year-old, into the family van and was returning a shopping cart to
a storage area about 10 feet away.</TE>
<TE>   She then saw a woman take the infant girl from the van and place
her into a car, Vickers said.</TE>
<TE>   "The woman started screaming and trying to get the lady to stop,"
Vickers said.</TE>
<TE>   Surveillance video captured the car circling the parking lot
before the abduction, but the kidnapping was out of the picture.</TE>

<LD>   A Philadelphia man accused of leaving his 20-month-old
granddaughter in a broiling car for nearly eight hours was charged
with involuntary manslaughter.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Calvin Howell, 54, apparently forgot to drop
Sasha Fogle off at a baby-sitter's home and went to work, leaving the
child in the car as temperatures outside soared into the 90s.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said he worked his shift at the city sanitation
department and visited a car repair shop before noticing Sasha's
slumped body. An autopsy confirmed that the child died of heatstroke.</TE>
<TE>   Sasha's mother, Ayesha Fogle, said her father shouldn't face
charges. "He loved me. He loved my daughter," Fogle, 25, told
WPVI-TV. "It was an accident."</TE>

<HD>Princeton Moves Culprits in Yale Web Site Hacking</HD>
<DH>Ivy League: Several workers in the university admissions
office are disciplined for 'violations of basic ethical principles.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Princeton University has reassigned its admissions director and is
cooperating with an investigation by federal prosecutors examining
unauthorized entries into the admissions Web site of Ivy League rival
Yale University, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Shirley M. Tilghman, Princeton's president, said a summary of the
university's internal investigation of the embarrassing incident was
sent to the U.S. attorney's office in Connecticut.</LD>
<LD>   Yale administrators had notified prosecutors about the
unauthorized Web entries.</LD>
<TE>   Tilghman said that admissions director Stephen LeMenager had been
temporarily reassigned to the communications office while an
administrative position for him is being sought. Several other
admissions office workers also were being disciplined, she added.</TE>
<TE>   "Violations of basic ethical principles of privacy and
confidentiality are especially serious in a university that teaches
these principles and counts them among its core values," Tilghman
said. "Students who apply ... have every right to expect that
information they provide in good faith will be used only for the
purposes for which they provided it."</TE>
<TE>   Yale President Richard C. Levin praised Princeton's action, which
was announced at a news conference at the university in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "President Tilghman has handled a very difficult situation in an
exemplary manner," Levin said in a statement. "I am impressed by the
thoroughness of Princeton's internal investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Tilghman said that on 18 occasions in early April, Princeton
computers were used to gain access to the Web site Yale used to
report admissions results to its applicants.</TE>
<TE>   She said 14 unauthorized sign-ons took place from computers in
Princeton's admissions office and that LeMenager started the process
of looking at the Yale site.</TE>
<TE>   The other four sign-ons were from a Yale applicant who was
visiting Princeton's campus and from Princeton students who had
siblings applying to Yale and who received relatives' permission to
visit the Yale site.</TE>
<TE>   Tilghman said that LeMenager entered Yale's site by using the
name, birth date and Social Security number of a Princeton applicant
who he thought might have applied to Yale. The admissions director
then told Princeton Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon and other
members of the admissions office about the discovery.</TE>
<TE>   In the next hour, LeMenager, employing names and confidential
information of two additional Princeton applicants, demonstrated what
he had discovered to other staff members in the admissions office.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, staff members entered Yale's Web site, apparently
without the knowledge of Hargadon or LeMenager, to learn whether
certain applicants were admitted to Yale, Princeton's investigation
found.</TE>
<TE>   Tilghman said that LeMenager, who disclosed the entry into Yale's
Web site during a discussion of security issues at a meeting of Ivy
League admissions officers in May, agreed he should leave his post.</TE>
<TE>   Hargadon has accepted responsibility for his failure to recognize
the impropriety of the actions taken by his staff or to report them
to higher officials, the university added.</TE>
<TE>   Tilghman said Princeton would discipline all members of the
admissions office staff who signed onto the Yale site or knew that it
was being entered. The nature of the actions was not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, Hargadon said he accepted responsibility
for not calling attention to the impropriety as soon as he learned
about it. He apologized to the eight students whose names were
checked on the Yale site.</TE>
<TE>   Hargadon will retire in June and has pledged to do everything he
can this year to restore the integrity of the admissions office, the
statement said.</TE>

<HD>Cardinal Admits Not Checking Files</HD>
<DH>Religion: In transcripts, the Boston archbishop says he
relied on advisors. Knowing about abuse claims would have been
helpful, he says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Cardinal Bernard Law acknowledged having promoted a priest, who was
later charged with multiple counts of child rape, without examining
his personnel records, according to transcripts of court testimony
released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In videotaped and written records of depositions taken here in
June, Law asserted repeatedly that he relied on advisors in approving
parish appointments, including placements for Father Paul Shanley,
whose records detailed sexual abuse complaints from as early as 1966.
Law said it would have been "helpful" if the information about
Shanley had been "readily available."</LD>
<LD>   The wide-ranging transcripts placed Law--once described by Father
Richard McBrien of the University of Notre Dame as "the most
influential bishop in the United States with the Vatican"--in the
often-uncomfortable position of defendant. Law, archbishop of Boston,
is shown taking the same oath as any other citizen called to testify,
and, like many witnesses, sometimes changing his answers.</LD>
<TE>   The long-awaited court records address topics ranging from Law's
knowledge of pedophilia in the priesthood to his views on protecting
the church at the expense of children who may have been molested. Law
also was asked about individual priests charged with sexual abuse,
including one whom Law returned to his home parish without notifying
parishioners that the priest had undergone psychiatric treatment for
pedophilia.</TE>
<TE>   Law also was asked about a comment he made invoking "the power of
God" upon the news media following a high-profile clerical abuse case
here 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it would be a bad thing to do, even today, to call
down God's power on the news media," Law testified in June. "I think
that would be very good."</TE>
<TE>   Law had no comment Tuesday about the transcripts. Calls to Donna
M. Morrissey, spokeswoman for the archdiocese, were not returned.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Roderick MacLeish Jr., representing an alleged Shanley
abuse victim and his family, said he could not comment on the
substance of the cardinal's testimony. But, MacLeish said, "this is a
very, very important subject. It goes well beyond the Catholic
church. It also shows how we deal with children in our society."</TE>
<TE>   The documents and videotapes were released as Law resumed his
closed-door depositions in civil suits involving sexual abuse claims
against Shanley. The 71-year-old retired priest was returned to
Boston in May from California, where he had been assigned to a parish
in San Bernardino despite numerous complaints against him in
Massachusetts and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Law also was deposed in the spring in a civil suit brought by
alleged victims of former Boston priest John J. Geoghan. Documents
released in connection with Geoghan's January child molestation trial
set off the sexual abuse scandal that has rocked the Roman Catholic
Church in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But Law and the Boston archdiocese have remained at the epicenter.
The nation's senior Catholic prelate, who was sometimes mentioned
before the scandal as a potential candidate to be the first American
pope, has been forced to mount aggressive legal strategies as a
defendant in a cluster of embarrassing lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Law, 66, also has been under fire for backing out of a $20-million
to $30-million settlement with alleged Geoghan victims that was
nearly a year in the making.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 pages of transcripts released Tuesday show that the
June session with Law began on a cordial note.</TE>
<TE>   "If I refer to you as cardinal, is that acceptable, your
eminence?" MacLeish asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," Law replied.</TE>
<TE>   But soon enough MacLeish was interrogating the cardinal about his
knowledge of sexual abuse by priests. After first testifying that
child molestation was not on his "radar screen" when he worked in
Mississippi in the early 1970s, Law conceded he knew of a priest
involved in "boundary violations" with a child from the local
diocese.</TE>
<TE>   Law agreed, however, that in 1973 he understood child abuse to be
a sin.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly it was a sin, yes," the cardinal stated.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the policy of his church regarding the protection of
children in abuse cases, Law said, "It does seem to me that, in
retrospect, we tended to view cases in isolation and view the
component parts of these cases. So one would deal with a victim. One
would deal with a priest."</TE>
<TE>   When MacLeish queried the cardinal about whether one focus of this
policy was to avoid scandal in the church, Law responded, "That's
correct."</TE>
<TE>   He did not deny promoting Father Daniel Graham, then a priest in
Quincy, Mass., to vicar, although Graham had admitted molesting a
child.</TE>
<TE>   "He was allowed to continue, yes, after intervention by a medical
source," Law said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that "looking back on it now," he erred in not
informing Graham's parishioners of the charge against the priest.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal maintained he did not recall seeing a 1985 letter
about Shanley, a popular so-called street priest in Boston. The
letter said Shanley delivered a speech at an organizational meeting
for the North American Man-Boy Love Assn., declaring that "when
adults have sex with children, the children seduced them."</TE>
<TE>   MacLeish, who charges that Shanley abused some of his clients
after Law assigned him to a Boston parish, then showed the cardinal a
letter from a subordinate saying that Law had received the
correspondence about Shanley. The cardinal countered that church
records were housed in "a lot of disparate places" and that he did
not know about sexual abuse allegations against Shanley until 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Shanley is in a Boston jail, awaiting trial on at least six counts
of child rape. He is accused of molesting boys 6 to 15 years old at
St. Jean's parish in suburban Newton from 1979 to 1989.</TE>
<TE>   As evidence of the extent of the sexual abuse scandal, law
enforcement officials in Boston announced Tuesday that still another
priest will be arraigned this week on child rape charges. Since
January, the Boston archdiocese has furnished officials with the
names of more than 100 priests accused of child molestation over 40
years.</TE>

<HD>Caught by Internet's Long Arm</HD>
<DH>Murderer fled prison in 1970 and buried her identity. But
32 years later, one slip-up and a cop's computer check expose her
secret.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Daryl McCartor met Tonya Hudkins three years ago through a telephone
dating service. Their first date was at McDonald's. On their second
date, they went ballroom dancing.</LD>
<LD>   Within months, they were married. It was Daryl's second marriage,
Tonya's third.</LD>
<LD>   They were inseparable, a trucker and an insurance agent, both in
their 50s. They went bowling and horseback riding, rode in Daryl's
Kenilworth truck. Daryl called Tonya his "little ol' country girl,"
though she was a mother of four and a grandmother of three infants.</LD>
<TE>   It all came crashing down one Sunday in May, after breakfast at
Jolly Pirate Donuts and a family swim. Plainclothes police approached
Tonya in a health club parking lot. As her husband, son and
daughter-in-law stood blinking in the sunshine, the officers told
them Tonya wasn't who she said she was.</TE>
<TE>   Her real name, they said, was Margo Freshwater. In 1966, at age
18, she had taken part in a killing spree across three states that
left three people dead. Convicted of murder and sentenced to 99
years, Freshwater escaped from a Tennessee prison in 1970. Then she
vanished.</TE>
<TE>   And now, after 32 years, the law had finally caught up with her,
hiding in plain sight in her hometown. Not even her husband and
children knew the truth.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," Daryl said later, "it was like we'd walked out of a movie
theater and now we were in the movie."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, it is easier than ever to disappear in an America of
transient populations and suburban anonymity. More than 12,000
fugitives are on the loose at any given time. But it is also easier
to track someone in an age of computer databases and Internet
connections in which no scrap of identifying data truly ever dies.</TE>
<TE>   It was certainly possible for Margo Freshwater to deceive her new
husband and three grown children. And when they finally accepted the
cold truth that the woman they loved was a stranger named Margo
Freshwater, they were angry--not at her but at the police for
destroying the blissful life she had built with them.</TE>
<TE>   She may have once been a convicted murderer, but she was also Phil
Hudkins' caring mother and Daryl McCartor's devoted wife and the
doting grandmother of Casey Henry's 19-month-old boy, A.J.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom is a victim," said Tonya's youngest son, Timothy Hudkins,
22, who knows her only as the mother who worked two jobs, always had
supper on the table and drove him to Little League games.</TE>
<TE>   Margo Freshwater was careful to scrub away the residue of her
previous life. She changed her name. She applied for a new Social
Security number. On job applications, she invented a fictitious high
school. She managed to never once be fingerprinted. She never
contacted family or friends. And her siblings unwittingly helped by
having her declared legally dead in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Freshwater thought of almost everything.</TE>
<TE>   Tracking a Cold Case</TE>
<TE>   Special Agent Gregg Costas of the Ohio Bureau of Criminal
Identification was 4 years old in October 1970 when Margo Freshwater
and another inmate scaled a fence at the Tennessee Prison for Women
in Nashville and disappeared. Freshwater had served just 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Costas was assigned the case in 1993, it was cold. The
FBI had tracked Freshwater to Baltimore after the escape, but quickly
lost her trail. The agency's only solid lead had come from
Freshwater's captured fellow escapee, who revealed in 1971 that Margo
had used the alias "Tonya."</TE>
<TE>   Costas had been assigned to dig up Margo's foot-and-a-half-thick
file only because the TV show "America's Most Wanted" was preparing
an episode on Freshwater, and had asked Tennessee police for
background information. But as he reviewed the paperwork, he was
fascinated: An 18-year-old unwed mother from Columbus and a
38-year-old married lawyer from Memphis had, for reasons never fully
explained, embarked on a crime spree that left dead a liquor store
clerk in Memphis, a cab driver in Mississippi and a grocery clerk in
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Freshwater had just given up her infant son for adoption in
Columbus in 1966 when she went to Memphis to hire a lawyer for her
boyfriend, Alfred Schlereth, jailed there for armed robbery. She
contacted attorney Glenn Nash, later described by his own lawyer as
"crazy as hell."</TE>
<TE>   Schlereth, interviewed by Costas in 1994, said Nash and Freshwater
had planned to smuggle guns into the courtroom and free him. Instead,
the two became lovers--and then killers.</TE>
<TE>   In court, a prosecutor described them as "Bonnie and Clyde."
Courts in three states found Nash legally insane. He was confined to
psychiatric hospitals until his release in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Two Mississippi juries deadlocked on charges that Freshwater was
an accessory to the murder of cabdriver C.C. Surratt, and she was
never charged in the killing of the grocery clerk. But a Memphis jury
convicted her of murdering liquor store clerk Hillman Robbins. She
stayed at the front of the store while Nash took the clerk to the
back and shot him five times in the head.</TE>
<TE>   Freshwater testified that Nash had threatened to kill her if she
tried to leave him during the three-week rampage. But witnesses
testified that Freshwater had several opportunities to
flee--including a 30-minute interlude when she tried on clothes in a
department store while Nash waited outside.</TE>
<TE>   Freshwater testified that she had sex with Nash after the liquor
store murder.</TE>
<TE>   "You were intimate with him that night, right after Mr. Robbins,
that poor man, had been shot and killed?" the prosecutor asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the circumstances," Freshwater replied, "I didn't have any
other choice."</TE>
<TE>   It took the jury just three hours to convict her.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks after her escape, Freshwater rolled back into Ohio on
a train from Baltimore. She settled in Ashland, 70 miles north of
Columbus. She was 22, alone and pregnant, living in a boardinghouse
and working as a waitress. She called herself Tonya Myers.</TE>
<TE>   Nine months and one day after her escape, she gave birth to a son,
Phil. Police have not determined who the father was. Over the next
three decades, Tonya would marry three men and give birth to two more
children. She worked as a bartender, country club manager, insurance
agent and real estate agent.</TE>
<TE>   She became Tonya Hudkins when she married a trucker named Joseph
Hudkins. After Hudkins died in 1988, Freshwater moved to Columbus,
working in an insurance office just four miles from her childhood
home--and only 40 miles from Costas' police headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, Freshwater managed to avoid any contact with people
from her past. Once, she encountered her aunt at a flea market, but
the woman didn't recognize her. She ran into a nurse who had known
her in high school, but again was not recognized.</TE>
<TE>   "She was able to hide for 32 years because she kept her mouth
shut," Costas said.</TE>
<TE>   After getting the case in 1993, Costas interviewed Freshwater's
brother, half-brother, aunt, high school friends and ex-boyfriend. He
even tracked down the father of the son she had given up for adoption
in 1966. He reviewed phone records and got a court order for a "mail
cover" to monitor relatives' mail. Nothing came of it.</TE>
<TE>   After the "America's Most Wanted" episode about Freshwater aired
in 1994, viewers claimed to have seen her in grocery stores and
parking lots across America. Costas confronted middle-aged women
across Ohio, persuaded them to be fingerprinted, then apologized.</TE>
<TE>   Twice, Costas thought he might have found Freshwater. But a woman
named Freshwater who had married a man surnamed Margo proved to be a
dead end, as did a woman from Canada who had sent a cryptic letter to
Freshwater's half-brother.</TE>
<TE>   By 1995, Costas was out of leads. "I never really closed the case
out," he said, "but it kind of just sat there. I figured she was
probably dead."</TE>
<TE>   The investigation was also stalled in Tennessee, where four agents
had picked it up and put it down since 1970. By 2001, it had fallen
to Agent Greg Elliott of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a cold case," Elliott said. "There were just no
leads--period. She had disappeared off the face of the Earth."</TE>
<TE>   By this time, Freshwater, now 53, was living with Daryl McCartor
in an apartment on Windchime Way in Columbus, just 10 miles from her
childhood home. Daryl had taught her to drive his rig. Tonya's CB
handle was "Sexy Legs." Daryl's was "Leg Inspector."</TE>
<TE>   They drove across America, visiting Graceland and the Smoky
Mountains in Tennessee. Freshwater was ticketed twice for speeding,
in Indiana and New Mexico, but troopers had no reason to question her
because her trucker's license was valid.</TE>
<TE>   In March, a producer from TV's "Unsolved Mysteries" called
Tennessee authorities seeking information for a program about
Freshwater. Elliott pulled the file.</TE>
<TE>   For most of Freshwater's three decades on the run, police chasing
fugitives had relied on tips from family or friends, traffic stops,
or painstaking reviews of paper files in courthouses or state
agencies. But now Tennessee police had a sophisticated Internet
database linked to vital statistics nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of going through paperwork in a file room, you just punch
in numbers and there's a whole new world of possibilities," Elliott
said.</TE>
<TE>   He mentioned the case to a police computer analyst, who suggested
entering the alias Tonya and Freshwater's birth date--June 4, 1948.
To their astonishment, the computer came up with a Tonya Hudkins in
Worthington, Ohio, the Columbus suburb where Freshwater grew up.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott thought it was a longshot. It didn't seem logical that
Freshwater would risk hiding out in her hometown, or that she would
change her identity but not her birth date.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, he called Gregg Costas.</TE>
<TE>   Costas, too, thought it was probably another false lead. But he
pulled up a computerized version of Tonya Hudkins' Ohio driver's
license and compared it to Freshwater's 1966 police mug shot.</TE>
<TE>   "It blew me away," he recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Even after three decades, everything matched: hairline, eyes,
chin, ears, cheekbones. Margo Freshwater was 5-foot-3, 116 pounds.
Tonya Hudkins was 5-foot-2, 118 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Costas e-mailed the photos to Elliott.</TE>
<TE>   "Like looking at a mother and daughter," Elliott recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Costas subpoenaed Hudkins' employee records. He found a gap in her
work history from 1966 to 1970--when Freshwater was in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Hudkins had listed Cleveland as her birthplace on her 2000
marriage license, but Costas found no record of such a birth. The
high school Hudkins claimed to have attended did not exist.</TE>
<TE>   Costas remembers thinking: This woman may not be Margo Freshwater,
but she's definitely hiding from somebody.</TE>
<TE>   Costas began staking out the nondescript brick apartment Hudkins
shared with McCartor. No one came or went for days. As it turned out,
the couple were on the road in Daryl's rig.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, as Costas drove home from a drug case on Saturday, May
18, he decided to swing past the apartment. Daryl's maroon Chevrolet
Lumina, with the Ohio tag "ROOT 66," was parked out front. He called
Daryl's number and a woman answered. He pretended to have the wrong
number and hung up.</TE>
<TE>   Costas tried to control his excitement. He called the county
prosecutor, Ron O'Brien, at home and begged him to get a search
warrant for the next day, a Sunday. He feared the couple would be
back on the road by Monday, and he did not want to have to chase them
across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Costas provided the prosecutor with photo transparencies of
Freshwater's mug shot and Hudkins' driver's license photo. He called
Elliott, who flew up that night from Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, the agents followed Tonya and Daryl to a
doughnut shop, a carwash and a grocery store. To get a good look at
Tonya, Elliott followed her into the grocery and engaged her in small
talk about fabric softeners. He was convinced they had found Margo
Freshwater.</TE>
<TE>   A stakeout team followed the couple back to the apartment while
the two agents and prosecutor O'Brien rushed to a judge's home for a
search warrant requiring Hudkins to provide her fingerprints. The
instant the judge saw the photo transparencies, O'Brien said, he
issued the warrant.</TE>
<TE>   At midafternoon, Daryl and Tonya--along with Tonya's son Tim, his
fiance, Casey Henry, and their baby, A.J.--drove toward the Columbus
airport. The agents, fearing Tonya was planning to fly out of state,
discussed how to best intercept her inside a busy airport.</TE>
<TE>   But the family pulled into a health club next to the airport and
went inside for a swim. An hour later, they walked to the parking
lot. Tonya was carrying her grandson.</TE>
<TE>   The agents approached and asked if she was Tonya McCartor. She
nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "We have reason to believe you're not who you say you are," Costas
said.</TE>
<TE>   Daryl said: "This is my wife."</TE>
<TE>   Tim said: "This is my mother."</TE>
<TE>   The agents said they believed she was actually a fugitive named
Margo Freshwater.</TE>
<TE>   Tim laughed out loud. He thought it was a prank. Casey laughed
too. She thought it was one of those Internet scams where people's
identities are stolen.</TE>
<TE>   Daryl was certain it was all a mistake that would be ironed out in
a few minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Tonya said nothing. Her expression was blank. She handed the baby
to Casey.</TE>
<TE>   The agents produced the warrant. Tonya was told that a police van
would take her, handcuffed, to the police station to be
fingerprinted.</TE>
<TE>   Tonya asked for a moment to say goodbye. She gave long, tender
hugs to her husband and her son and her son's fiance and whispered
into the ear of each one. Then she was gone.</TE>
<TE>   She had whispered: "I was always afraid this day would come."</TE>
<TE>   A Quick Match</TE>
<TE>   It took only a matter of minutes to match Tonya's fingerprints to
the police prints taken from Margo Freshwater 36 years before. Tonya
took the news stoically.</TE>
<TE>   Costas felt numb: "After all these years, she was like some
fictitious character. She was like a ghost to me."</TE>
<TE>   There was so much he wanted to ask the trim, blond grandmother who
sat before him. He agreed to her request for a few minutes to say
goodbye to her family in return for answering questions.</TE>
<TE>   Costas asked whether she had lived her life looking over her
shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   No, she said, because Margo Freshwater no longer existed. She had
to die, she told the agent, so that Tonya could live.</TE>
<TE>   "She had compartmentalized it," prosecutor O'Brien said later.
"She had convinced herself that those events had never happened."</TE>
<TE>   Asked why she returned to the one place in the world where people
knew her face, Tonya said Ohio was all she knew--and besides, she
only had enough train fare to reach central Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   She could not explain why she had neglected to change her birth
date.</TE>
<TE>   Costas thought he knew: "People tend to cling to familiar things,
and what's more familiar than your birthday?"</TE>
<TE>   Tonya showed emotion only when Costas asked about the son she gave
up for adoption. Choking back tears, she told him that she had never
been able to find him.</TE>
<TE>   When her family was brought in to see her, Tonya hugged them
again. She told them: "I'm not that same person anymore."</TE>
<TE>   She said she had been a naive teenager who had been manipulated by
her lawyer. She went along with Nash, she told them, because she was
terrified he would kill her.</TE>
<TE>   Daryl told her he believed her and would stand by her. Tim and
Casey, in tears, told her they loved her.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Margo Freshwater is being held in "maximum security
segregation" away from other inmates at the Tennessee Prison for
Women, where she had escaped 32 years ago. The prison has since added
several security fences.</TE>
<TE>   Had she served her original sentence, she would have been eligible
for parole in 1998. Now she must serve her 99-year sentence, plus any
time she receives for escaping.</TE>
<TE>   In news stories following her arrest, relatives of the three
people killed in 1966 said justice had finally been done.</TE>
<TE>   "This woman committed a horrendous act," said Susie Robbins-West,
the granddaughter of murdered clerk Hillman Robbins. "She needs to
pay her debt, in full."</TE>
<TE>   Within days of the arrest, Freshwater's family began raising money
for the legal defense of the woman they still call Tonya.</TE>
<TE>   They held a carwash, sold soft drinks at a fair and peddled
grocery coupon books. They handed out a flier with Tonya's photo and
a plea: "A loving grandmother, mother and wife in Columbus, Ohio
needs your help!"</TE>
<TE>   Since her arrest, Margo has exchanged hundreds of letters with her
husband, sons and Casey Henry. Daryl has hired a law firm and signed
over his life insurance policy as a down payment. He hopes to win
clemency for his wife, or at least a new trial.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife is a gentle, loving person who got caught up in tragic
circumstances," Daryl said. He calls the arrest "blind justice from
the past."</TE>
<TE>   As a young mother herself, Casey Henry says she can understand how
"a 38-year-old lawyer could really take advantage of a scared
18-year-old girl." She believes in Tonya's innocence. "I'd suspect
myself before I'd suspect her," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Hudkins, 32, who was born during his mother's first year on
the run, said she is no killer. "Tennessee made a big mistake," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Hudkins said his mother doesn't belong in prison because
she has already rehabilitated herself by living a clean life for 32
years.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way, given the person she is today, that she could be
that person from back then," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A computer caught the woman they all loved. Perhaps, the family
believes, a computer will help set her free.</TE>
<TE>   They are now seeking donations through the official Tonya Hudkins
McCartor Web site.</TE>

<HD>Making Baseball's Washington Pitches</HD>
<DH>Politics: Calautti keeps low profile as she represents the
sport's interests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Baseball is in trouble. Accusations of steroid use are in the air.
Players are threatening to strike. Congress is eyeing the coveted
antitrust exemption. Small-market teams are raging about big-market
TV money. And following the action as closely as a manager in the
bottom of the ninth with the bases loaded and the score tied is the
woman who is Major League Baseball's lobbyist, Lucy Calautti.</LD>
<LD>   "I hired her because she was a huge fan and she knew Washington
and she was so conscientious," said baseball Commissioner Bud Selig,
who talks to Calautti two or three times a day. "It's turned out even
better than I could have imagined. She's very loyal, and she has
great judgment."</LD>
<LD>   Calautti, 55, rarely gives interviews, shuns the limelight and
prefers to see Selig's name in print to her own. "A very low
profile," is how USA Today's baseball writer, Mel Antonen, describes
her. "Her reputation? It's just not there."</LD>
<TE>   But Calautti, say her fans, is doing what she does best and what
baseball needs most--working quietly and influentially behind the
scenes. For baseball's Washington lobbyist, hitting a home run often
means keeping Congress out of the ballpark. And Calautti, who has 20
years of experience on Capitol Hill, knows how to do that.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball doesn't want someone who is highly visible," said Sen.
Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.), who hired Calautti nearly 30 years ago when he
was a young tax commissioner in Bismarck, N.D. Dorgan said Calautti
kept autographed baseballs on her desk when she worked for him in the
Senate. He calls her "not only America's No. 1 baseball fan but an
extraordinary talent."</TE>
<TE>   Her job is not so much to front the issues that separate sports
from politics as to take the front-line flak for the controversies
that spark from their uneasy alliance. When Selig announced plans
last fall to eliminate two teams, she advised him on how to weather
the storm of congressional hearings and threats to eliminate
baseball's antitrust exemption. And when Selig ended the All-Star
game in a tie after 11 innings, it was Calautti who had to put the
best spin on it around town.</TE>
<TE>   "I was watering the garden last night in front of my Capitol Hill
home and I was besieged with comments," she said last month.
"Everybody from a Library of Congress staffer, to members of
Congress, to reporters who are neighbors, to one young kid who's a
big Baltimore Orioles' fan had something to say."</TE>
<TE>   She explained to all that the two teams had simply run out of
pitchers, perhaps in a misguided attempt by the leagues to play
everybody. Selig, she told everyone, was very unhappy, and vowed that
it would never happen again.</TE>
<TE>   "My small job in baseball is to explain this in Washington, a town
where anything that happens in baseball can have a repercussion among
public policymakers with very strong opinions," she said.</TE>
<TE>   With the national pastime comes national scrutiny. One senator
even teased her that perhaps he would call hearings into the dearth
of pitchers at All-Star games.</TE>
<TE>   Calautti comes to her baseball credentials as most do, from
childhood. The daughter of an Italian-American father and an orthodox
Jewish mother ("we only cooked Italian, except on Passover," she
said), she was the second of three children, and the only girl.</TE>
<TE>   But she became the baseball child, as a teenager traveling with
her father by train from Queens to watch the New York Mets play at
the old Polo Grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Pasquale Oempedicles Calautti, a chandelier-maker by day and jazz
musician on weekends, taught Lucy about the infield fly rule and
showed her how to keep score. He also talked to her about the birds
and the bees ("he told me not to worry about it, because it was not
something I was going to be doing until I was married," she recalled
with a smile) and, mostly, about life.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the greatest lesson she learned from him--the one that
makes her indispensable to politicians and baseball commissioners
alike--concerns one of the Mets' earliest shortstops.</TE>
<TE>   Elio Chacon batted .236 in 1962, a three-year major leaguer who
had more hustle than skill.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't a great talent, but he tried so hard and he never gave
up and my father really wanted me to learn that," Calautti recalled.
"My father was right, Chacon never really went anywhere, but I
remember his name because of that lesson. Never give up. It doesn't
matter if you're not best at what you do, you just have to work
hard."</TE>
<TE>   Her father died one week before she took the baseball job, too ill
to appreciate the magic it represented for both of them. She muses
that "if he had been younger, and well, I can just hear him saying,
'How about my little girl.' "</TE>
<TE>   Calautti is like the hare, aiming to finish the task at hand no
matter the speed. To this day, she credits her career success to an
uncommon conscientiousness. Asked why her future husband, Kent
Conrad, hired her to run his maiden campaign for the U.S. Senate, she
replied, "He knew I'd work my heart out."</TE>
<TE>   Friends call her goal-oriented.</TE>
<TE>   "If she's supposed to achieve X, Y or Z, that comes first," said
Sara Garland, who worked with Calautti on the Hill and is now a
lobbyist. "She's very successful in putting in a job that needs to
get done in front of her own ego." If she learned tenacity from her
father, she inherited a sense of adventure from her mother. Eager to
leave home, scheming to figure out how to pay for college, she joined
the Navy after high school. The nation was at war in Vietnam, and the
Navy made her a photographer, though a battery of tests showed her
skills lay elsewhere. Soon, she found herself hanging out of
airplanes above the Atlantic, taking pictures of ships at sea,
thrilling to the adventure.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She returned to New York after her tour of duty but soon rebelled
against the crowds and other penalties of city life. Her best friend
in the Navy, Sandy Boyum, visited during the city's six-month garbage
strike and boasted of her life in North Dakota. The final straw came
one day in front of the No. 7 train at rush hour. The crowds pushed
her toward the train. Calautti ran the other way.</TE>
<TE>   She took a train instead to Denver, then boarded a bus to Fargo.
She arrived in a blizzard and stayed for decades. She got her
bachelor's and master's degrees in English from North Dakota State.
Now she considers herself a New Yorker who became a North Dakotan.
Sometimes she sounds like Marge Gunderson in the movie "Fargo,"
sprinkling her sentences with an occasional "you betcha."</TE>
<TE>   She married, had a son, divorced. Working for Dorgan in the tax
office and later in the U.S. House of Representatives, she met a
colleague who she thought was a brilliant strategist. He asked her to
run his longshot campaign for U.S. senator from North Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   In November 1986, Conrad was elected to the U.S. Senate. The
following Valentine's Day, he and Lucy Calautti were married. Among
the common denominators: They both loved baseball.</TE>
<TE>   He brings his glove to Orioles' games at Camden Yards. Every
morning, she reads the agate on team standings and player statistics,
and these days she also checks the attendance records. Barry Piatt,
Dorgan's communications director, once went to a game with the
couple.</TE>
<TE>   "It was particularly fun to sit next to Lucy," he said. "It's like
sitting next to your own radio broadcaster. She knows the stats on
everybody--who's struggling in the bullpen, and at the plate."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Calautti approached Selig at the All-Star game and
told him that she wanted to speak with him about what she could do
for baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart was pounding, like a kid," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Selig had just closed baseball's Washington office. Now he turned
to Calautti, and she left her Capitol Hill post in late 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Sports Illustrated published an interview with Ken
Caminiti. The former San Diego Padre said he had used steroids, and
half the league did too. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) pushed for
hearings. Selig demurred, telling Calautti he would rather Capitol
Hill understand baseball's position than hold hearings on it.
Calautti says she told him, "The Senate's the Senate."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Calautti counts the hearings as a success because they
allowed Selig to tell his side of the story--that Major League
Baseball has been pushing for mandatory testing for years. Since
then, it's been baseball union boss Don Fehr, rather than Selig, who
has been on the defensive.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we're the national pastime, we get all the attention,"
said Calautti, a trace of sarcasm creeping into her voice. "Did you
know the Charlotte Hornets are leaving Charlotte? Anybody holding
hearings on that?"</TE>
<TE>   Garland, who served as chief of staff to Conrad, walks with
Calautti from their homes on Capitol Hill to the Smithsonian Mall
whenever they can. She reports that Calautti is "bouncier" these
days. "Are you kidding? She's been dreaming about this job all her
life."</TE>

<HD>Skating Union Gives Files to U.S. Attorney</HD>

<LD>The International Skating Union said Tuesday it has given the U.S.
Attorney in New York its complete files relating to its inquiry into
the pairs figure skating controversy at the Salt Lake City Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   The documents became relevant when U.S. officials charged reputed
Russian mobster Alimzhan Tokhtakhunov July 31 with trying to fix the
outcome of the pairs and ice dance competitions at the Games. As a
result of the ISU inquiry, which was limited to the pairs event,
French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne and French ice sports federation
head Didier Gailhaguet were each suspended for three years and banned
from the 2006 Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   "Although the name Alimzhan Tokhtakhunov is not mentioned in the
hundreds of pages of documents and testimony, the U.S. investigators
may find the information to be of interest," ISU President Ottavio
Cinquanta and General Secretary Fredi Schmid said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. and Italian authorities say Tokhtakhunov arranged a
vote-swapping deal to help Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze win the pairs gold medal and French skaters Marina
Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat win the ice dance title. Le Gougne's
attorney, Max Miller of Salt Lake City, reiterated that his client
doesn't know Tokhtakhunov and knows nothing about an alleged fix. He
also repeated his contention the ISU's investigation of Le Gougne was
unfair because it did not interview any Russian officials or judges.</TE>
<TE>   The ISU also said it asked all 73 of its national member
federations to cooperate with U.S. and Italian investigations of
Tokhtakhunov. U.S. Figure Skating Assn. spokesman Bob Dunlop said the
U.S. group will send a letter to its officials making the same point.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ichiro Suzuki drove in three runs and scored once as the Seattle
Mariners defeated the Boston Red Sox, 10-3, Tuesday night at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Desi Relaford, who came to Seattle and vowed to contribute any way
he could this season, was a home run shy of hitting for the cycle.</LD>
<LD>   Relaford drove in two runs and scored twice while filling in for
injured shortstop Carlos Guillen. Guillen sat out for the third
consecutive game because of a strained left thigh muscle.</LD>
<TE>   Dan Wilson had three hits with a double for the American League
West leaders, and Suzuki doubled and singled.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox fell five games behind New York in the AL East.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Pineiro (12-4) won his second consecutive decision and eighth
out of nine, but made things tough on himself early. It took him
until the sixth to get a 1-2-3 inning but he was able to turn a rocky
start into a solid outing. John Burkett (10-6) lost his third
consecutive start.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox had seven baserunners in the first three innings on
five singles, but managed only one run. Nixon singled to center to
lead off the third inning and then scored on a single by Ramirez for
a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 5, Toronto 4--Eric Chavez broke a tie with a two-run
single in the seventh, and Barry Zito rebounded from consecutive
losses for his 16th victory as the Athletics won at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   After losing two in a row for the first time all season, Zito
(16-5) pitched eight innings of four-hit ball, striking out seven and
giving up only one earned run. Zito joined Boston's Pedro Martinez
and Derek Lowe for the AL lead in victories.</TE>
<TE>   Jermaine Dye hit an early three-run homer for the A's, who ended
their five-game losing streak to Toronto and won for the ninth time
in 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Hudson doubled and tripled for the Blue Jays, who tied it,
3-3, with two unearned runs on Vernon Wells' double in the sixth.
Toronto lost for the fifth time in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Koch pitched the ninth, giving up a run-scoring grounder to
Brian Lescher before striking out pinch-hitter Tom Wilson for his
29th save in 34 chances.</TE>
<TE>   New York 10, Kansas City 5--Bernie Williams homered, doubled and
drove in four runs and Roger Clemens got his 290th career victory as
the Yankees won at Kansas City, Mo. Clemens (10-3) won despite giving
up five runs, 10 hits and four walks in five-plus innings. The
Yankees have won 11 of the last 12 games against Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Sweeney hit a double in his first at-bat in nearly a month,
and went two for five for the Royals. He was activated from the
disabled list before the game after missing 30 games because of a
back and hip strain.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 6, Baltimore 0--Rick Reed pitched a five-hitter and Doug
Mientkiewicz homered twice as the Twins won at Minneapolis. Reed
(10-6) struck out four and walked one in his sixth career shutout.
Mientkiewicz had three hits and drove in three runs. David Ortiz also
homered and added a two-run double in Minnesota's four-run fourth
inning.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 12, Texas 3--Jose Valentin homered twice, including his
sixth career grand slam, and drove in six runs to power the White Sox
at Arlington, Texas. It was the 11th multihomer game for the
switch-hitter, who homered from both sides of the plate in the same
game for the third time.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 9, Tampa Bay 5--Karim Garcia hit his second career grand
slam during a seven-run fifth inning to help the Indians win at St.
Petersburg, Fla.</TE>

<HD>Erstad Scratched From Lineup With Leg Pain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Center fielder Darin Erstad was a late scratch from the lineup
because of what was described as fatigue in his right leg.</LD>
<LD>   Erstad left Monday's game in the fifth inning and was taken out of
the lineup Tuesday after his leg bothered him running in the outfield
during batting practice.</LD>
<LD>   Trainer Ned Bergert was not overly concerned and said Erstad's
hamstring is not involved--a great relief to Manager Mike Scioscia.</LD>
<TE>   "You don't ever want to take a chance with a hamstring," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With Erstad out and right fielder Tim Salmon sitting out a third
consecutive game after being hit on his left hand by a pitch
Saturday, Orlando Palmeiro started in center and Alex Ochoa started
in right.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad and Salmon are both considered "day-to-day," Scioscia said
after a CT scan Tuesday confirmed there is no evidence of a broken
bone in Salmon's hand. Salmon was still not ready to hit, Scioscia
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He can grip it but I don't think he can rip it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Dodger utility man Hiram Bocachica earned a rare start for
Detroit, batting leadoff and playing center field.</TE>
<TE>   He made it count at the plate, leading off the game with a single
and scoring the first run of the game before adding a solo home run
in the third--his third in eight games for Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Acquired from the Dodgers in a July 25 trade for minor league
pitcher Tom Farmer and a player to be named, Bocachica was batting
.215 with the Dodgers and was used primarily as a pinch-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad I'm here. I'm in the big leagues," Bocachica said. "You
play in an organization like the Dodgers or Yankees ... to be honest,
they never explained why I wasn't getting a chance to play."</TE>
<TE>   His start Tuesday was his fifth for Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy. Now I have my family. My daughter [Aliyah] is six
months.... I used to get aggravated [about not playing]. Now I
realized that attitude never helped. That's how you learn."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels will hold a ceremony honoring Hall of Fame broadcaster

against Cleveland that leads them into next week's crucial New
York-Boston trip. Detroit starter Mike Maroth, a rookie, might be
better than his numbers indicate. He is 3-1 since the All-Star break
and pitched 8 1/3 shutout innings against Baltimore in his last start
before a reliever recorded the final two outs.</TE>

<HD>Doubleday Agrees to Give Up Mets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nelson Doubleday agreed Tuesday in New York to sell his 50% of the
New York Mets to co-owner Fred Wilpon, settling an ugly lawsuit
filled with accusations of misconduct.</LD>
<LD>   Wilpon sued Doubleday last month in federal court to try to force
a sale of his partner's 50% share based on a $391 million appraisal
of the team made in March by Robert Starkey.</LD>
<LD>   There was no immediate word on the price Doubleday will receive as
part of the agreement, which was first reported Tuesday on Newsday's
Web site.</LD>
<TE>   Under the Starkey appraisal, Doubleday would have received $137.9
million--half the team's value, after adjustments for the team's
debt.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a higher appraisal, Doubleday had been seeking
provisions for an additional payment in the event the Mets move into
a new ballpark, which would increase the team's value.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Cummins, a Doubleday advisor, confirmed the agreement but
would not elaborate, and Wilpon spokesman Richard Auletta said the
announcement of the settlement by Commissioner Bud Selig "speaks for
itself."</TE>
<TE>   Wilpon will move to dismiss his suit when the deal closes, Selig's
office said. The commissioner's office said the sale is expected to
close within 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   "I was confident that at the end of the day they put their
personal feelings aside and act in the best interests of the game,"
said Selig, whose mediation led to the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ted Williams' eldest daughter asked a judge to keep jurisdiction
in the dispute with her half-siblings on whether to cremate or deep
freeze the slugger's body.</TE>
<TE>   The request made Tuesday by Bobby-Jo Williams Ferrell came five
days after the executor of Williams' estate withdrew his request
asking the judge to help resolve the spat over Williams' body.</TE>
<TE>   The estate's executor, Al Cassidy, said last week he's convinced
the Hall of Famer wanted to be cryonically frozen and that a judge's
guidance was no longer necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said in his will that he wanted to be cremated and his
ashes scattered off the Florida coast. But his youngest children,
John Henry Williams and Claudia Williams, maintain they signed a
handwritten pact with their father in November 2000 agreeing that
their bodies would be frozen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former relief ace Randy Myers, out of the majors since 1998, has
been training at the New York Yankees' complex in Tampa, Fla., for
more than a week.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no commitment on either side. We'll just see where it
goes," the left-hander said. "I'm just working out the kinks."</TE>
<TE>   Myers, 39, made a brief return last year, signing a minor league
contract with Seattle on Aug. 28. He pitched once for triple-A
Tacoma, and did not retire any of the four batters he faced.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Met catcher Mike Piazza was scratched from the lineup
shortly before the start of Tuesday's game against the San Diego
Padres because of a sore left wrist. The wrist started to bother
Piazza in batting practice.... Tampa Bay Devil Ray infielder Russ
Johnson is set to resume working out at the team's minor league
complex after missing the past month while undergoing treatment for
depression.</TE>

<LD>Piece-loving baseball fans, take note: It's a happening for the
hairless. The Mahoning Valley Scrappers of Niles, Ohio, the Class-A
affiliate of the Cleveland Indians, this evening will present "Jim
Traficant Night," with hairpiece wearers and sons of truck drivers
admitted free.</LD>
<LD>   Traficant, a former Ohio congressman serving an eight-year prison
sentence for bribery and racketeering, often calls himself "the son
of a truck driver" but is better known for his gravity-defying
hairstyle. It caused much speculation on whether it was real or a
rug--until he had to doff it for booking.</LD>
<LD>   "Former Congressman Traficant played a vital role in attracting
the franchise to the Mahoning Valley," General Manager Andy Milovich
said. "We felt a Jim Traficant Night would show our sincere gratitude
for his efforts."</LD>

<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the only player whose jersey number has been
retired by the Washington Redskins? Hint: The team has not retired
the numbers of any of their three Super Bowl most valuable players.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oh for two: Sunday's brilliant pitching performances by Tim
Wakefield of the Boston Red Sox and Steve Sparks of the Detroit
Tigers reminded Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle of an
old quote by former hitting coach Charlie Lau.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two theories on hitting the knuckleball," Lau said.
"Unfortunately, neither of them work."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not the end of the world: Regarding the Chicago Bears' complaints
about having to play their home games at the University of Illinois
in Champaign this season while Soldier Field is renovated, it should
be noted that the Tennessee Titans went 6-2 in the Liberty Bowl in
Memphis in 1997 while waiting for a new stadium to be built in
Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   J-Load: Regrading Kentucky quarterback Jared Lorenzen, who weighs
about 290 pounds, teammate Derek Abney told the Memphis Commercial
Appeal: "He stepped on my foot one time in a drill. I thought he
broke it."</TE>

<TE>   Twenty-five years ago: On this day in 1977, Lanny Wadkins won the
59th PGA Championship in a dramatic three-hole sudden-death playoff
with Gene Littler at Pebble Beach, the first sudden-death playoff in
a major championship.</TE>

<TE>   Amnesty international: Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News,
on threats by owner Mark Cuban of the Dallas Mavericks to keep his
players out of the World Championships: "So if Dirk Nowitzki and
Michael Finley play anyway, would you consider them Cuban defectors?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Sammy Baugh, who wore No. 33.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Dan Le Batard of the Miami Herald, on the decision by
major league baseball players Monday to postpone setting a strike
date:</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, a hiccup's worth of positive news in the sport that
keeps asking its fans to choose between the insanely greedy steroid
freaks and the billionaire liars with creative accountants.</TE>
<TE>   "Trying to pick a side between baseball's players and owners is
like choosing between *NSYNC (can't the Russians shoot them all into
outer space?) and the Greasy, Balding, Rehabbing Backstreet Boys--no
matter which way you lean, you are going to find yourself closer to
something evil."</TE>

<DH>Chargers' Flutie, Brees less-than-heated rivals in bid to
start</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Here's a sign that the San Diego Chargers are truly in the post-Ryan
Leaf era: They have a quarterback controversy that does not involve
questions of malingering or attitudinal deficiencies.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, it is hard to even call the issue of Doug Flutie versus
Drew Brees a controversy. A competition, perhaps, but given their
ages, it is not a matter of if but when the 23-year-old Brees will
replace the 39-year-old Flutie.</LD>
<LD>   New Coach Marty Schottenheimer says he wants to give each a chance
in the exhibition season to earn the starter's role. Beyond that,
he's noncommittal.</LD>
<TE>   "Doug played well and so did Drew," allowed Schottenheimer after
Saturday's 24-17 loss to the Arizona Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   Flutie, the starter, completed six of nine passes for 46 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I barely broke a sweat," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brees, entering the game to significant cheers, completed eight of
13 for 60 yards, although he threw an interception that Cardinal
cornerback David Barrett returned 38 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt great just to be able to get the opportunity [to play],"
Brees said.</TE>
<TE>   Last season Brees got only one such opportunity during the regular
season. When Flutie suffered a concussion in the second quarter
against the Kansas City Chiefs, Brees made his pro debut, completing
15 of 27 passes for 221 yards, one a 20-yard touchdown pass to
Freddie Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 19-0, when Brees entered, the Chargers took the lead,
and only a last-minute touchdown gave the Chiefs a 25-20 victory.</TE>
<TE>   The next game, Flutie was recovered and the rookie from Purdue
was, in effect, finished for the season. After a 5-2 start, the
Chargers stumbled to 5-11 and Coach Mike Riley was dismissed on New
Year's Eve.</TE>
<TE>   Under Riley, Flutie was promised the starter's job--the kind of
assurance he had never had during three seasons with the Buffalo
Bills.</TE>
<TE>   But Schottenheimer does not believe in entitlements and announced
soon after he was hired that he wanted Flutie and Brees to compete
during the exhibition season.</TE>
<TE>   He also used the Cardinal game to look at Dave Dickenson, last
year's third-stringer, and rookie Seth Burford from Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo.</TE>
<TE>   One factor that seems to undercut the idea of a controversy is
that Brees and Flutie get along fine. They play golf on days off and
during the Cardinal game stood on the sidelines, comparing notes.
Even the radio sports talkers have not been able to construct much of
a rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to think about it--and I know Doug does the same,"
Brees said. "The goal here is just for both of us to get better."</TE>
<TE>   On and off the field, they are a study in contrasts. Flutie is a
scrambler, Brees the more traditional drop-back passer. Flutie is
poised, articulate, analytical. Brees has a youthful grin and
sometimes during interviews, his words take the field without a clear
game plan.</TE>
<TE>   After eight years in the Canadian Football League and nine in the
NFL, Flutie has no need of false modesty.</TE>
<TE>   "It was solid," he said of his Saturday performance. "I made good
reads and made good decisions with the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Brees, still largely unknown to the San Diego public, is careful
not to promise too much.</TE>
<TE>   "I never rate performances," he said. "You'll never hear me say,
'I did really good.' "</TE>
<TE>   Fans with long memories are reminded of the John Unitas-Dan Fouts
competition of 1973. The aging veteran had joined the Chargers after
a stellar career at Baltimore but after four games, the rookie from
Oregon took over the job as first-string quarterback, which he held
through 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Even as he considers his quarterback situation, Schottenheimer has
other concerns. Minor injuries kept linebacker Junior Seau, running
back LaDainian Tomlinson, free safety Rogers Beckett, defensive
tackle Jamal Williams, cornerback Tay Cody and kick returner Ronny
Jenkins out of the Cardinal game. And the Chargers have yet to sign
top draft pick Quentin Jammer, the cornerback from the University of
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Cardinals, the Charger offensive line had trouble
lining up properly, leading to penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "We committed six fouls offensively before the ball was snapped,"
Schottenheimer said. "We can't do that to win in this league."</TE>
<TE>   Safety Rodney Harrison was even less forgiving, saying, "You can't
have excuses for those kind of penalties. We have to show more
discipline, a little maturity."</TE>
<TE>   Brees will start Friday against the Seattle Seahawks at Qualcomm
Stadium, with Flutie getting a turn. After that, the future lies with
the man with the straw hat and the take-charge demeanor.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea," Brees said. "You'll have to ask Marty."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Brown Not Ready to Pitch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>Kevin Brown will not pitch against the New York Mets on Friday night,
and until the right-hander proves to Dodger coaches he has regained
his form, rhythm and velocity, his return from June 11 surgery for a
herniated disk in his lower back will remain indefinite.</LD>
<LD>   "I know what Kevin Brown looks like when it's very right," Manager
Jim Tracy said. "And as the manager of this club, I'm not going to
put Kevin Brown back on that mound feeling like we are compromising
the situation because we're sending a name and a reputation out there
and not a name and a reputation with his good stuff. I won't do
that."</LD>
<LD>   Brown allowed one earned run and five hits in six innings for
triple-A Las Vegas against Edmonton on Friday night, seemingly
putting him on a course to return this week, but General Manager Dan
Evans said Brown "didn't have his best stuff."</LD>
<TE>   Brown's fastball, in the 93-95 range when he's in peak form, was
clocked from 87-90 mph Friday. Asked what the reports were on Brown's
rehabilitation start, Tracy said, "He got guys out."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who suffered two setbacks in his return from major elbow
surgery, in April and May, struggled during a bullpen workout in
Dodger Stadium on Sunday, and he threw again in the Olympic Stadium
bullpen before Tuesday night's game.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked better than he did the other day, but we haven't made
any decisions," pitching coach Jim Colborn said. "He was sharper, he
had better command, he was more consistent."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Brown showed enough to be activated, Colborn said, "He's
pretty close."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said Brown will not make any more minor league starts, but
Brown apparently didn't show him enough Sunday or Tuesday to warrant
a return this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to compromise this man," Tracy said. "He pitched
for us last year until all the fibers left in his elbow tore
themselves away. He had no gas in the tank."</TE>
<TE>   Brown feels like he can pitch, "but the question is, what best
serves the team's interest?" Brown said. "My stuff is obviously not
where it has been. Does it get better when you walk on the mound
[with the extra adrenaline of a game]? That's usually the case, but
still, I can't fault them for doing what they're doing.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't do me any good to walk out there just for the sake of
walking out there. I've got to be at the point where I'm going to
help the team."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy believes Brown can iron out his problems in one or two good
side sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "But until he finds it, I'm not moving forward," Tracy said.
"Rhythm and timing are important elements. He's been out for a while.
To just think you can go out there and have it all fall in your lap,
it doesn't work like that. If the delivery is not in sync, things
will get lost, and velocity is part of that equation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Jesse Orosco, who was unavailable the last two games
because of stiffness in his lower back, threw in the bullpen Tuesday
afternoon and was available Tuesday night.... Dodger muscle therapist
Bill La Seur, who vowed after an Aug. 6 loss to Pittsburgh not to eat
solid foods until the Dodgers lost again--and lost six pounds during
the Dodgers' subsequent four-game win streak--was finally able to hit
the postgame spread after Sunday night's 6-3 loss to the Phillies. "I
had a chunk of lasagna the size of a car battery," La Seur said.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Looking to Close the Gap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Major League Soccer's playoffs began today, the Galaxy would be
seeded fifth for the postseason tournament. This despite riding a
four-game league unbeaten streak, having picked up a league-leading
19 points in its last 10 games and sporting a better record than
every team in the Eastern Conference.</LD>
<LD>   The Galaxy has played the fewest games in MLS at 20 and has 33
points. And while every other team in the tight Western Conference,
where two points separate second place from fifth, has played at
least one more match than the Galaxy, the scheduling quirk begins to
rectify itself tonight with the Galaxy playing at Columbus.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think it ever feels great to have a midweek match,"
Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said Tuesday from Columbus. "But at least
[Columbus is] on the same schedule with us. It's more of a danger to
play a team that's rested.</LD>
<TE>   "But this will pull us even with Dallas in games played and we can
overtake them [for second place] with a win. We'll also be within a
game of Colorado [which has played 22 games and is tied with the
Galaxy]. This is a game we have in hand, it's like a chip we have to
use."</TE>
<TE>   In trying to become the first MLS team this season to win three
consecutive matches, the Galaxy is going at it short-handed. Schmid
left veterans Mauricio Cienfuegos, 34, and Alexi Lalas, 32, behind to
rest up for the stretch run as the Galaxy is in a string of six
games, three on the road, in 18 days.</TE>
<TE>   With the duo out, Sasha Victorine and Craig Waibel will get their
share of the minutes at midfielder and defender, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The Crew, meanwhile, will be without explosive forward Brian
McBride (sprained left ankle) and midfielder John Wilmar Perez
(sprained left knee ligament).</TE>
<TE>   The Crew's defense has also been somewhat porous, giving up six
goals in its last three games, a fact that must have Galaxy forward
Carlos Ruiz smiling.</TE>
<TE>   The Guatemalan rookie has scored a league-leading 16 goals, five
behind the Galaxy's single-season record of 21 set by Eduardo Hurtado
in 1996. Ruiz is second in MLS with 33 points.</TE>

<LD>Trainer Patrick Biancone, with one 2-year-old stakes victory at
Saratoga, will try for No. 2 in the $150,000 Saratoga Special today.</LD>
<LD>   Three weeks after Whywhywhy rallied from well off the pace to win
the Sanford, Zavata, generally considered the better of the two
talented colts, will be favored to win the Special, a Grade II at 6
1/2 furlongs.</LD>
<LD>   The son of Phone Trick, who was purchased by Michael Tabor for
$575,000 at a sale in February, has won two of three, including the
Tremont at Belmont Park on June 29.</LD>
<TE>   Prepping for the seven-furlong Hopeful, Zavata will leave from the
outside post and will be ridden by Jerry Bailey, who has won six
stakes at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   The colt Zavata most has to fear is Lone Star Sky. A son of
Conquistador Cielo owned by Walter New and trained by Tom Amoss, Lone
Star Sky is perfect in two starts. He won by slightly more than two
lengths in his bow at Arlington Park on June 13, then went to
Kentucky and won the Bashford Manor, a Grade II, by 3 1/2 lengths.
Mark Guidry, who rode him in the victory at Churchill Downs, has the
mount.</TE>
<TE>   The other entrants are Desert Warrior, who will be a first-time
Lasix user for trainer Wayne Lukas; Spite The Devil, a Devil His Due
gelding who has won one of two for trainer Allen Jerkens, and Awesome
Of Course, an upset winner at nearly 10-1 over a muddy track in his
first start at Saratoga on Aug. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Reine De Romance is the 120-pound high weight in
Del Mar's feature, the $75,000 Osunitas Handicap at 1 1/16 miles on
the turf. Opponents include Noches de Rosa, a Chilean-bred making her
U.S. debut for trainer Richard Mandella, and L'Emeraude, who earned
her first win in this country June 28 at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Tom Heard Jr. Thanks to Lawbook's victory in the
$75,000 Dr. Fager division of the Florida Stallion Stakes on Saturday
at Calder, Heard, 84, has trained a stakes winner in eight
consecutive decades. He had his first stakes winner, Be Blue, in
1938.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Mike Luzzi. The jockey began Saratoga two for 44.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Steamy Dreams, Poly Ole and
Seamstress in the fifth, singling Blind Ambition in the sixth, using
Reine De Romance, Noches De Rosa and L'Emeraude in the seventh, and
Fourth And Long, Mr. Machine and Wisdom's Mark in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/38. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $4.80/$216.60. Total money bet: $308.</TE>

<HD>Labor Talks Pick Up Pace</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Negotiator for owners expresses optimism that a
deal can be reached.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Negotiators Tuesday finally addressed the main issue that could
derail baseball labor talks fast approaching a deadline, focusing on
the contentious matter of a payroll tax as the sides returned to the
table in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Owners and the Major League Baseball Players Assn. intensified
their efforts to reach an agreement a day after the union said it
would wait until Friday to consider setting a strike deadline,
working throughout the day on management's demand to slow escalating
player salaries by taxing teams with high payrolls. The sides had
previously talked around the major item they acknowledge might
prevent them from reaching a deal but now appear determined to find
common ground in an attempt to avert the sport's ninth work stoppage
since 1972.</LD>
<LD>   "We are close enough that it is possible to make an agreement in
the next several days," said Rob Manfred, baseball's lead labor
lawyer. "The differences between the parties are smaller now than
they were 24 hours ago."</LD>
<TE>   The union views payroll tax as a component of revenue sharing,
another means of transferring money from high-revenue to low-revenue
clubs, and owners consider it an essential form of payroll
regulation, resulting in a bridge difficult to gap.</TE>
<TE>   However, negotiators expressed optimism about their first
substantive exchange on the issue in talks still proceeding with
civility and sincerity absent in previous collective bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel pressure to get something done in advance of the time that
any of what I regard to be the key events take place: the setting of
a strike date or the actual strike itself," Manfred said. "Both
parties feel tremendous pressure to get this resolved as quickly as
possible."</TE>
<TE>   The union's executive council has scheduled a Friday conference
call to reevaluate the status of negotiations. Potential strike dates
of Aug. 30, Sept. 2 and Sept. 16 were discussed Monday at the
executive council meeting in Chicago, and Sept. 2 or 16 might be
selected unless progress continues on the payroll tax.</TE>
<TE>   Management, seeking a tool to slow escalating player salaries, has
proposed a 50% tax on all payroll above $98 million. The union has
had long-standing opposition to any system that would penalize the
clubs that drive the market, but sources said the union could soften
its stance as a result of management broaching the idea of increasing
the tax threshold and phasing in the tax for high-spending teams.</TE>
<TE>   Although neither side would reveal specifics of Tuesday's
exchange, the union apparently made significant movement toward
owners.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that if we reach an agreement in the next few days, it
will contain a luxury tax," Manfred said. "For us to make a deal,
there has to be a luxury tax in it."</TE>
<TE>   If proposals for revenue sharing and the payroll tax were
combined, as the union would prefer, the sides would be $150 million
apart, with owners at $400 million and the union at $250 million.</TE>
<TE>   A compromise would seem possible on those numbers in an industry
that last year generated a record $3.55 billion in revenue, but
management wants to keep the issues separate.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think about the tax issue as a
how-much-money-does-it-move issue," Manfred said. "The union has
talked about it that way, but we don't share a common view as to
whether the tax is about raising money or not.</TE>
<TE>   "The negotiation is not about the amount of money it raises, but I
don't think this difference of opinion puts us farther or closer
apart. Whatever the parties' views are as to the philosophy of taxes,
a place exists in which a negotiation can be done."</TE>

<HD>Campbell Returns in a Statement Game</HD>
<DH>WNBA: It's a special moment for Monarch guard after
radiation treatment, two surgeries and chemotherapy.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Fighting breast cancer, Edna Campbell returned to the court Tuesday
night to help the Sacramento Monarchs beat the Seattle Storm, 59-51,
in the final game of the WNBA regular season.</LD>
<LD>   Undergoing radiation treatment after two surgeries and months of
chemotherapy, the 33-year-old guard scored four points on two-of-five
shooting shooting in 13 minutes. She was hugged by players from both
teams afterward.</LD>
<LD>   Campbell received a standing ovation when she was introduced
before the game, and the fans stood again and cheered when she
entered the game early in the first half.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just a statement to those going through cancer, breast
cancer, and those who have been touched by breast cancer, and it's
just a symbolic thing I wanted to do just to show that there is light
at the end of the tunnel," Campbell told CNN on returning to the
basketball court.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell, the first active WNBA player to be diagnosed with breast
cancer, received the WNBA Community Assist Award in July for her
outreach work.</TE>
<TE>   "That noise the crowd made was love and support," Campbell said.
"I was a little overwhelmed at first with the crowd behind me. This
was pretty memorable."</TE>
<TE>   "I was happy about everything tonight. It's great to end the
season this way."</TE>
<TE>   Yolanda Griffith had 19 points, and Tangela Smith added 17 for the
Monarchs (14-18), who won 10 of their last 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Reserve center Simone Edwards scored 14 of her 18 points in the
second half for Seattle (17-15).</TE>
<TE>   Vodichkova had 12 points, and Lauren Jackson added 11 points for
the Storm, which won seven of its final nine games to clinch a
playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle, which secured its first playoff berth with a victory
Sunday night at Utah, will face defending champion Los Angeles in a
first-round, best-of-three series. The opener is Thursday at 7 p.m.
in Seattle.</TE>

<LD>Natalie Coughlin shattered the 100-meter backstroke world record
Tuesday at Fort Lauderdale, Fla., finishing in 59.58 seconds at the
U.S. National Swimming Championships.</LD>
<LD>   Coughlin, of Concord, Calif., trimmed more than a half-second off
the previous record of 1:00.16 set by Chihong He of China in 1994.</LD>
<LD>   Coughlin is the first American to hold the world record since
Catherine Ferguson in 1966.</LD>
<TE>   "I was glad I finally did it," Coughlin said. "Breaking the world
record has been in the back of my mind, and I knew I could do it."</TE>
<TE>   In other finals, Aaron Peirsol, of Irvine won the men's 100-meter
backstroke in 54.01 seconds, beating world record-holder Lenny
Krayzelburg, of Los Angeles, who touched in 54.48.</TE>
<TE>   Nate Dusing, of Villa Hills, Ky., was the surprise winner in the
men's 200-meter freestyle in 1:47.08, only 0.43 seconds off the
American record. Dusing beat favorites Michael Phelps, of Baltimore,
and Klete Keller, of Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Top-ranked Serena Williams withdrew from the Rogers AT&amp;T Cup
Tuesday, the same day former No. 1 player Martina Hingis was
victorious in her return from ankle surgery. Hingis defeated Spain's
Magui Serna, 6-4, 6-3 in the second round at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Williams cited acute tendinitis in her left knee as the reason for
her withdrawal. Williams first injured her knee during practice
Monday and aggravated the injury during practice Tuesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The sixth-seeded Hingis, who had an operation to repair ligament
damage in her left ankle May 20, made several unforced errors but
still got past No. 53-ranked Serna.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Agassi broke Noam Okun's serve twice in the first three
games and never looked back as he advanced to the third round of the
Legg Mason Tennis Classic with a 6-2, 6-2 victory at Washington.
Third-seeded Sjeng Schalken won a second-round match, beating Cedric
Pioline, 7-6 (5), 6-1.... Arnaud Clement, the No. 15 seed, beat Jonas
Bjorkman, 6-4, 7-5, to reach the second round of the RCA

<TE>   Courtney Swaim of Sugar Hill, Ga., shot a three-under-par 68 at
Sleepy Hollow Country Club in Scarborough, N.Y., and was stroke-play
medalist in the U.S. Women's Amateur championship.</TE>
<TE>   Swaim, 22, finished with a two-day total of seven-under 135, three
shots ahead of Danielle Downey of Spencerport, N.Y., and will enter
match play today as the top-seeded player.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA sophomore Yvonne Choe and Walailak Satarak of UC Irvine tied
for ninth at 143. Pepperdine seniors Lindsey Wright (72-73) and
Katherine Hull (71-75) also advanced to match play, as did Hana Kim
of Los Angeles (70-77) and Sunny Oh of Torrance (77-70).</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   A French judge in Paris rejected a request to release the wife of
Lithuanian cyclist Raimondas Rumsas from jail. Edita Rumsas was
jailed last month for allegedly transporting illegal doping products.</TE>
<TE>   French police said Edita Rumsas was carrying performance-enhancing
drugs, including EPO and testosterone. Raimondas Rumsas, who finished
third in the Tour de France, was tested for doping four times during
the race with all the tests coming up negative. Rumsas said the drugs
found by police were intended for his mother-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander Daigle, a former No. 1 draft pick who walked away from
hockey two years ago, signed a tryout contract with the Pittsburgh
Penguins. Daigle appeared ready to go to camp with the San Jose
Sharks. He apparently changed his mind when given the chance to
possibly play alongside Mario Lemieux, who, like Daigle, is
French-Canadian. Daigle hasn't played since the 1999-2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Williams of the Chicago Bulls, an alternate on the U.S. men's
national basketball team, is expected to be added to the main roster
as a replacement for the injured Ray Allen. Allen said that a sore
knee would keep him from playing in the World Championships, Aug.
29-Sept. 8 at Indianapolis.... The NBA's No. 1 draft pick Yao Ming of
the Houston Rockets, along with Menk Bateer of the Denver Nuggets and
Wang Zhizhi of the Dallas Mavericks, have been named to the Chinese
team.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The NFL Players Association claims the Minnesota Vikings and Kansas
City Chiefs may have engaged in collusion while negotiating contracts
with their first-round draft picks.</LD>
<LD>   The union claims the teams may have had illegal knowledge of the
signing bonus offered to a player chosen after Kansas City selected
Ryan Sims with the sixth pick and Bryant McKinnie was picked seventh
by Minnesota.</LD>
<LD>   The players association says the teams subsequently offered the
players a lower amount, so the union filed a request for an
investigation on Monday with the NFL Management Council, ESPN.com
first reported Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   "If two clubs take the same position [on offers to their players],
then one player can't say, 'Look, No. 7 signed for this or that
amount, so I should get a few bucks more,' " said Richard Berthelsen,
an attorney for the players association.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Williams, the No. 8 pick by Dallas, was offered the larger
signing bonus, according to the union.</TE>
<TE>   Berthelsen said a letter to the management council asks for
information about any communication between the Chiefs and Vikings
regarding negotiations with their top draft picks.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Brzezinski, vice president of football operations for the
Vikings, called the accusations "ridiculous" and "baseless."</TE>
<TE>   Carl Peterson, president and general manager of the Chiefs, also
said the claims were baseless. He said Kansas City has never
discussed contract talks with any teams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Terrell Davis, the NFL's premier running back of the late '90s, is
so discouraged with the lack of progress on his injured knees that
he's contemplating retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm taking everything in stride, and whatever way the wind blows
I'm fine with it," said Davis, who has been plagued by injuries since
1998, when he became only the fourth player to rush for 2,000 yards
in a season.</TE>
<TE>   Davis received two injections on Monday to relieve swelling and
lubricate his knee joint. Coach Mike Shanahan said Tuesday that Davis
was feeling better and could practice in the next two-to-three days,
but questions remained about how much Davis will be able to play--if
he does come back.</TE>
<TE>   The doubt has left Davis weighing his options.</TE>
<TE>   One option for Davis might be to become a situational player.
Davis said he might accept the role if it means prolonging his
career.</TE>
<TE>   "Could I be a backup, a 5-to-10 carry back?" Davis said. "It's
humbling, but yes, I could probably do it. No doubt about it. As long
as I can contribute in some fashion, then I'll be content with that,
especially knowing my situation."</TE>

<TE>   Former NFL lineman Alonzo Spellman was ordered held without bail
in a federal jail at Philadelphia after a judge ruled he was too
dangerous to be released.</TE>
<TE>   Spellman, 31, is accused of threatening a pilot and flight
attendant and harassing passengers during a Delta Air Lines flight
from Cincinnati to Philadelphia. Spellman was released by the Detroit
Lions in October.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay Buccaneer lineman Cosey Coleman, who started all 16
games last season at right guard, will miss the next four weeks after
tearing cartilage in his left knee during warm-ups before Monday's
14-10 exhibition victory over Miami.... The Cincinnati Bengals and
linebacker Brian Simmons reached agreement on a six-year contract
extension. Simmons, 27, a first-round draft pick in 1998, was in the
final year of his original five-year contract. Simmons had 6.5 sacks
and 139 tackles, second best on the team, last season.... The Packers
signed wide receiver Andy McCullough to add depth to their banged-up
receiving corps. The Packers also waived injured wide receiver
Windrell Hayes to make room for McCullough, a former NFL Europe
standout.... Carolina Panther cornerback Dante Wesley, a fourth-round
draft pick,  will miss at least three to four weeks after suffering a
hernia that will require surgery.</TE>

<HD>Kent's Power Knocks Out Braves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds didn't hit career home run No. 601, but the two that Jeff
Kent hit did the trick.</LD>
<LD>   Kent homered twice, doubled and drove in four runs, backing the
solid pitching of Russ Ortiz as the San Francisco Giants beat Greg
Maddux and the Braves, 7-2, Tuesday night at Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   Benito Santiago added a two-run homer for the Giants, who moved
into the lead in the NL wild-card race with their seventh victory in
nine games.</LD>
<TE>   "We needed that," San Francisco Manager Dusty Baker said. "Our
bats came alive."</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta still has the best record in the majors at 77-41, despite
its third loss in six games.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds went one for three with two walks and a ninth-inning single.
He has eight lifetime homers off Maddux, tied for the most he has hit
off any pitcher. Bonds declined to speak with reporters after the
game, waving them off as he headed out of the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   After Kent doubled in the first, the Braves intentionally walked
Bonds, drawing a loud chorus of boos from the Turner Field crowd. The
strategy paid off when Reggie Sanders struck out.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz (8-8) pitched seven innings of five-hit ball, giving up a
solo homer to Julio Franco in the third and a run-scoring single by
Keith Lockhart in the seventh. He struck out three and walked two.</TE>
<TE>   Kent hit a three-run homer in the third, part of a four-run inning
off Maddux (11-4) during which San Francisco sent nine batters to the
plate.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh, Kent led off with a solo shot against reliever
John Foster. It was the 14th multihomer game of his career, and the
second this season.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux lost for only the second time in 20 starts, giving up four
runs--three earned--and eight hits in six innings. He threw a
season-high 102 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 6, Cincinnati 1--Steve Finley hit a two-run homer and Rick
Helling held the Reds to three hits in seven innings, showing no
lingering effects from a sprained ankle, as the Diamondbacks won at
Cincinnati, despite losing Luis Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez, who holds the longest active playing streak in the
majors at 446 consecutive games, strained a muscle in his rib cage
and had to leave in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   The loss knocked the Reds into third place in the NL Central and
extended their season-long struggle against good teams. Cincinnati is
44-23 against teams with losing records, only 17-33 against the rest.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 7, New York 2--Rookie Jake Peavy came within two outs of
his first major league complete game, and doubled his career total
with three hits to lead the Padres at Shea Stadium in New York. Peavy
(4-4), in his ninth major league start, gave up two runs and five
hits in 8 1/3 innings with six strikeouts and one walk. Peavy also
went three for four with a double as the Padres got 12 hits.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres won despite umpires reversing a call and taking a home
run away from Ryan Klesko after he had already rounded the bases.
Replays confirmed it was a foul ball. Trevor Hoffman got the last out
with the bases loaded for his 29th save.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 5, Florida 4--Larry Walker and Todd Helton each drove in
two runs and the Rockies won at Miami. Walker's two-run triple off
reliever Armando Almanza highlighted a three-run seventh as the
Rockies rallied from a 4-2 deficit. Earlier in the inning, Jay
Payton's groundout scored Juan Uribe.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Hampton (7-13) gave up four runs in six innings. He has won
consecutive starts for the first time this season. Jose Jimenez
pitched the ninth for his team-record 32nd save. Dave Veres had 31 in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 9, Pittsburgh 5--Scott Rolen drove in three runs for the
third straight game and the Cardinals got a season-high 18 hits to
win at Pittsburgh. Matt Morris (14-7) pitched eight innings, giving
up one run and six hits. He was staked to a 5-0 lead after three
innings and won for the fourth time in his last five decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Hyzdu's bases-loaded single capped a four-run ninth for
Pittsburgh. Jason Isringhausen got the last out for his 27th save.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, Milwaukee 1--Vicente Padilla gave up four hits
over seven shutout innings, and Mike Lieberthal hit a two-run homer
and doubled as the Phillies won at Philadelphia. Lieberthal, who hit
three home runs Saturday, is 25 for 58 (.431) in his last 14 games
with five doubles, six homers and 10 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla (12-7) gave up four singles to pick up only his second win
since June 29. Jose Mesa pitched the ninth for his 34th save in 42
chances.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 5, Chicago 4--Pitcher Pete Munro got his first major
league hit and RBI and also won for the first time since July 23 as
the Astros won at Chicago. The game was eventually completed after
almost two hours of interruptions, because of rain, as the Cubs
rallied after being down, 5-0.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Girardi's RBI single in the sixth made it 5-3, and Alex
Gonzalez hit a solo homer off Billy Wagner to lead off the ninth. But
Wagner retired the next three batters for his 27th save.</TE>

<HD>Els May Have Set New Course</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Ernie Els is the Tiger Slam Stopper, or something like that, since
he's the guy who won the British Open at Muirfield, halting Tiger
Woods' bid to win all four of golf's majors this year.</LD>
<LD>   Els says he thinks many want to see other players besides Tiger
win majors.</LD>
<LD>   "I can hear some comments out there, yeah," Els said. "Let's face
it, we are playing in the era of one of the greatest players ever,
maybe the greatest when he is done with his career.</LD>
<TE>   "When you have a player with that kind of talent, he's going to
win a lot of golf tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "I've listened to some comments out there on the golf course, just
from the general public, and I feel that they would like to see more
players compete against him or actually beat him and win more
tournaments."</TE>
<TE>   Said Els, who was asked how much he has changed since winning at
Muirfield last month: "I think it's a little early."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He has three top-10 finishes in the majors this year and he's only
22, but Sergio Garcia is still 0 for 16 in majors.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, who was eighth in the Masters, fourth in the U.S. Open and
tied for eighth in the British Open, says it's not that easy to win a
major.</TE>
<TE>   "They are all difficult to win," he said. "That's why they are
majors, because they are tougher than a normal tournament to win."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia said he knows what it will take for him to break through:</TE>
<TE>   "Make more putts. That's what it comes down to. In these kind of
tournaments, you know that you're going to miss some greens because
it's tough and if you're able to make a couple of par putts of maybe
eight feet or seven feet, something that really keeps you going.
That's what Tiger has been able to do for a long time. I think that's
a difference."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Phil Mickelson, who is 0 for 41 in majors, although
it took a hole-in-one by David Toms in the third round of last year's
PGA to beat him.</TE>
<TE>   At last year's PGA at Atlanta Athletic Club, Mickelson said he
wasn't thinking about winning one major, but several of them. But
despite a third in the Masters and a second in the U.S. Open, it
sounds as though Mickelson is putting a different spin on that topic
now.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that it would be wrong to put the whole outlook of a year
based on four tournaments," he said. "Now, I've been trying to win
major championships for a number of years and if I had looked at
every year on that premise, then it would be a very disappointing
career."</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson says he looks upon his play in majors as a steppingstone
to the future:</TE>
<TE>   "I do feel as though my game is ready and I feel as though I'm
ready to come out on top, finally, in one of these tournaments."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   They play the Ryder Cup in twosomes, not in groups of four, but
U.S. captain Curtis Strange might have been thinking about what
possible pairings he could use in next month's matches when he
arranged the practice rounds here Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The groups: Mickelson, Paul Azinger, Jim Furyk, Scott Verplank;
Mark Calcavecchia, Scott Hoch, Stewart Cink, Toms; Hal Sutton and
David Duval.</TE>
<TE>   Strange and Tom Watson played with Sutton and Duval. Woods played
with his usual practice-round partners, Mark O'Meara and John Cook.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This was supposed to be the first major to feature each of the top
100 ranked players in the field, but it's down to 98 of 100 since the
rankings of Pierre Fulke and Paul Casey dropped out of the top 100.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Skins Game is going to make history of a sort. Greg Norman,
who won it last year, is "unavailable" to defend his title. It's the
first time the defending champion is not returning, not counting
1997, when Fred Couples was unable to play because of the death of
his father.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, as the leading money winner on the PGA Tour, assumes
Norman's spot in the Skins Game, to be played Nov. 30-Dec. 1, at
Landmark Golf Club in Indio.</TE>
<TE>   With no defending champion returning, three other positions are
open, but four possible candidates have already taken themselves out
of the running--John Daly, Els, Garcia and Mickelson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The last major at Hazeltine was the 1991 U.S. Open, won by Payne
Stewart. There are 34 players in the field who competed in the Open
11 years ago, four of whom finished in the top 10--Larry Nelson, tied
for third; Fuzzy Zoeller, fifth; Hoch, sixth, and Jose Maria
Olazabal, tied for eighth. Woods was 15 at the time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   According to Thomas Bjorn, there is one spotlight this week and it
will shine on--guess who. Tiger, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "The focus is going to be on him to see if he can be the first guy
to win three majors in the same year twice," Bjorn said. "He's a
dominant player. I think we saw at the British Open, if you go out
there and play your game and he doesn't play his best game, well,
you've got a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "He goes into any tournament as a big favorite. I don't feel it's
any different at this tournament than any other tournament. It can't
get much bigger than this."</TE>
<TE>   Bjorn said he is considering playing both the PGA Tour and the
European Tour in 2003.</TE>

<HD>Hiddink Is No. 1 on China's List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having thanked Bora Milutinovic and sent him on his way, China's
soccer federation has turned its attention to finding a new coach.</LD>
<LD>   The man it wants is Guus Hiddink, the Dutchman who in 18 months
transformed South Korea from an also-ran into a legitimate contender
on the international level.</LD>
<LD>   China's official Xinhau news agency Tuesday revealed that a
four-person committee had narrowed the list of potential replacements
for Milutinovic to three names, with Hiddink being the preferred
candidate because of his "profound" understanding of Asian soccer and
his reputation as a disciplinarian.</LD>
<TE>   Hiddink, 56, is coaching PSV Eindhoven in the Netherlands but
maintains close contact with South Korea, which will certainly try to
bring him back once qualifying starts for the 2006 World Cup in
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   The other coaches under consideration by the Chinese are French:
Aime Jacquet, who led France to the 1998 World Cup, and Philippe
Troussier, who coached Japan into the second round of the 2002 World
Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Asian Champions League</TE>
<TE>   The Asian Football Confederation launched a new continent-wide
club competition called the AFC Champions League, modeled on the
hugely popular and lucrative European Champions League.</TE>
<TE>   "After the success of the World Cup in Korea and Japan, everybody
wants to invest in Asian football, everybody wants to be part of
Asian football," Peter Velappan, the confederation's general
secretary, said in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. "It's a gold mine."</TE>
<TE>   The AFC Champions League will feature 51 teams from 29 countries
and a total of $3 million in prize money, with the winner getting
$500,000.</TE>
<TE>   J-League Scraps Overtime</TE>
<TE>   Japanese soccer officials confirmed that the J-League will do away
with sudden-death overtime starting in the 2003 season and will allow
games that are tied after 90 minutes to end that way.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez Heads for Germany</TE>
<TE>   Defender Dario Rodriguez, who scored one of the finest goals of
the World Cup--for Uruguay against Denmark--is set to leave Penarol,
his Uruguayan club for the past three years, and sign for Schalke 04
of the German Bundesliga.</TE>
<TE>   The 27-year-old left back, who once played for Toluca in Mexico,
has played two dozen games for Uruguay since making his international
debut two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Alpay Demands Transfer</TE>
<TE>   Defender Alpay Ozalan, one of the key players for Turkey as it
earned third place at Korea/Japan '02, has demanded to be released
from his four-year contract with Aston Villa of the English Premier
League.</TE>
<TE>   The club said that Alpay, who has been with Villa for two years,
wanted a 50% raise despite already being one of its highest-paid
players. The club has refused that request.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Come Together in the End</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Victory over Phoenix gives L.A. the best
record in WNBA. Seattle is playoff opponent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>In May, the Sparks would not have believed it would take 32 WNBA
regular-season games to decide the Western Conference champion.</LD>
<LD>   Now they believe. After holding off Phoenix Mercury, 63-56,
Tuesday night at America West Arena, the defending champions
reclaimed the role as the team to beat in the WNBA.</LD>
<LD>   Lisa Leslie's 23 and 11 rebounds and a Spark defense that held
Phoenix to a 31.1% shooting clinched the league's best record (25-7)
for the defending champions and gave them a third consecutive Western
Conference title.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles will play the fourth-place Seattle Storm in the first
round of the playoffs beginning Thursday at Seattle. Games 2 and 3
(if necessary) will be played at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Getting to this point was a struggle for the Sparks. The Mercury
(11-21) got within 46-43 after Leslie sat down with five fouls, but
Slobodanka Tuvic and Adrain Williams each missed layups.</TE>
<TE>   "Experience got us through," said Spark guard Tamecka Dixon, who
had 10 points. "The core of this team has been playing together for
three years; myself, Lisa and Mwadi [Mabika] have been together for
six. When we get down to those [crucial] situations, we just focus in
on the little things and try to close it out.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a good job of staying focused on this road trip; we knew
it was important for us to win every game. Now we're ready to go into
the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   It was the Mercury's 10th consecutive loss to the Sparks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we had one of our better efforts against L.A.," said
Williams, who had 12 points and a career-high 14 rebounds. "You want
to leave everything on the court going into next season and I think
we did."</TE>
<TE>   Spark Coach Michael Cooper, who termed his team "in trouble" after
the Aug. 8 loss to Houston, believes L.A.--after three consecutive
road wins--is ready to defend its title.</TE>
<TE>   "The last couple of games, especially at Minnesota, we haven't had
those five-six minute lapses that can be deadly," Cooper said. "Our
turnovers are down. The players know it's playoff time."</TE>
<TE>   Armed with the knowledge that Houston had beaten
Minnesota--putting L.A. in a must-win situation to clinch the
league's best record--the Sparks nonetheless started on cruise
control. Phoenix--eager to entertain its Fan Appreciation Night crowd
of 11,347, a season high--took a 19-12 lead.</TE>
<TE>   But the Sparks turned on the defense and outscored Phoenix, 22-6,
to take a 34-25 lead at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   But L.A. struggled in the second half. With Mabika making only one
of nine shots from the field, the Spark offense struggled.</TE>
<TE>   But the Sparks never never lost the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's off to Seattle, which beat the Sparks twice in three
games. In the last meeting in Seattle on July 11, the Storm blew out
the Sparks, 79-60. It was the Sparks' worst defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure they have a confidence against us from what they did in
the regular season," Cooper said. "But the playoffs are different. In
1999 we swept Houston in the regular season, and in the playoffs they
swept us.</TE>
<TE>   "We now have the chance to home in on just them, not be worried
about a Houston or a Utah the next day.</TE>
<TE>   "But all four West teams are dangerous. That's why we worked hard
to get two games in our house."</TE>
<TE>   Considering the Sparks have lost three of their last four home
games, one has to wonder if Staples Center is a safe haven.</TE>
<TE>   "It is," Cooper said, "until someone proves otherwise."</TE>

<LD>USC defensive back Darrell Rideaux spent the last seven years
matching his talent and wit against Trojan wide receiver Kareem
Kelly.</LD>
<LD>   During four years at Long Beach Poly High and last three at USC,
the seniors challenged each other physically and verbally to raise
their performances.</LD>
<LD>   Rideaux and Kelly were woofing at each other again Tuesday during
a coverage drill that is becoming one of the most important testing
grounds during the Trojans' training camp.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Pete Carroll is looking for cornerbacks to replace Chris
Cash and Kris Richard, both of whom were drafted by NFL teams.</TE>
<TE>   Rideaux is one of the leading candidates, but he and Kevin Arbet
are being pressed by Marcell Allmond, Ronald Nunn and Justin Wyatt.</TE>
<TE>   "You want the pressure because it's going to get you revved up for
every play in practice," Rideaux said. "I'm fighting to keep the
other guys from coming up. I'm just trying to enjoy it."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, who could become the Trojans' all-time leading receiver,
said the 5-foot-8 Rideaux is more physical this spring and making
more consistent reads.</TE>
<TE>   "When I go up against Kareem, I know I'm going to get his best,"
Rideaux said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've lined up day in and day out for so long, neither one of us
wants to give in to the other. We feud and fight on the field but we
always hug and make up after practice."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Players were instructed Monday that they should run to the
sidelines when an alarm sounded during practice Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The alarm went off about midway through afternoon practice and
players scurried to the sidelines. Coaches then put them through a
series of 12 sprints to the middle of the field and back before
resuming drills.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just to make it hard and make them respond and push
through the end of practice," Carroll said. "These guys are going to
be under a lot of adversity and we need to get mentally right to
handle whatever happens."</TE>
<TE>   The sprints drained sophomore defensive end Shaun Cody, who
suffered cramps and was taken from the field on a cart. Cody received
intravenous fluids and said he would be ready to play today.</TE>
<TE>   "[The drill] is called 'The Winning Edge,' " Cody said. "It wasn't
quite the winning edge for me."</TE>
<TE>   Junior defensive end Daniel Urquhart also was treated for cramps.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans practiced field goals for the first time and kicker
David Davis made four of six during the morning workout, the final
one from 37 yards. He also converted all of his attempts from various
distances in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, a senior, made 15 of 18 field goals last season, including
12 in a row during one stretch. He converted four kicks from 40 yards
or farther, the longest a 47-yarder against Arizona</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offensive lineman Zach Wilson, who suffered a left foot sprain on
the first day of training camp, was examined and said he would
probably miss a week or two. Wilson's foot was fitted with a plastic
protective device. "They put a boot on me, like I had too many
parking tickets," he said.... Wide receiver Keary Colbert was held of
most drills throughout the day because of tightness in his legs....
Freshman quarterback Billy Hart and junior offensive lineman Nate
Steinbacher passed conditioning tests and took part in drills for the
first time.</TE>

<LD>Kelly Schumacher helped put Indiana into the WNBA playoffs, scoring a
career-high 15 points as the visiting Fever beat the Cleveland
Rockers, 60-56, on Tuesday night before 11,461 at Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   Fever guard Nikki McCray, who chanted "Kelly! Kelly" in the locker
room, missed the final 14 minutes because of a dislocated finger on
her right hand, but said she will try to play in the playoff opener
against New York.</LD>
<LD>   "I was really concentrating on defense and let everything else
just happen," said Schumacher, who also had a career-high nine
rebounds.</LD>
<TE>   Schumacher was making her first start of the season at center
after Olympia Scott-Richardson was placed on the injured list before
the regular-season finale because of a sore right foot.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot even begin to describe this," Coach Nell Fortner said
after Indiana capped an improbable run to the playoffs with its sixth
victory in seven games. "It is phenomenal. I'm so proud of this
team."</TE>
<TE>   Indiana and Orlando finished the season 16-16, but the Fever took
the fourth and final Eastern Conference playoff spot with a 2-1 edge
over the Miracle in the season series.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana, earning the first playoff berth in its three-year
history, tied for the league's worst record last season at 10-22.
Cleveland finished with that record this season.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 70, New York 63--Shannon Johnson had 14 points and seven
assists as the Miracle (16-16) earned a season-ending victory over
the Liberty (18-14) before 8,135 at Orlando, Fla. The Liberty is the
Eastern Conference's top seed.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 61, Detroit 56--Betty Lennox scored 20 points as the Sol
(15-17) was eliminated from the playoff race despite a victory over
the Shock (9-23) before 9,153 at Miami. To make the playoffs, Miami
needed to win and for both Indiana and Orlando to lose.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 67, Washington 57--Allison Feaster scored 20 points as
the Sting (18-14) beat the Mystics (17-15) before 11,461 at
Charlotte, N.C., to gain home-court advantage in their first-round
playoff series.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 63, Minnesota 51--Rita Williams scored a season-high 15
points to lead the Comets (24-8) past the Lynx (10-22) before 11,618
at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks, however, beat out the Comets for best record in the
Western Conference and home-court advantage throughout the playoffs
with a victory at Phoenix.</TE>

<HD>Defying Congress, Bush Slashes Anti-Terror Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Defiantly breaking a budget truce with Congress, President Bush
announced Tuesday that he would block more than $5 billion that
lawmakers had approved for homeland security, global AIDS relief and
other items. Since last year's terrorist attacks, Bush has worked
with both Republicans and Democrats to round up support for massive
spending packages for the war on terrorism, recovery operations in
New York and new domestic security measures.</LD>
<LD>   At times in recent months he used veto threats to get his way, but
in other instances he embraced bipartisan priorities.</LD>
<LD>   Now the president's stance is much more confrontational. At an
economic forum in Waco, Texas, Bush vowed Tuesday to assert control
over the federal budget through a rarely used executive power, akin
to a veto, to block already designated spending.</LD>
<TE>   But while the president struck a blow in the name of fiscal
restraint, his decision to eliminate billions from a recently enacted
anti-terrorism law drew immediate howls from congressional Democrats
and private complaints from some Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Gone in a stroke were funds meant to aid Israel, bolster local
firefighting forces and even replace antiquated election equipment in
counties nationwide. Gone too may be a great deal of the comity Bush
had counted on to help win congressional approval for some of his own
legislative proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats chastised Bush. Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, the
third-ranking Democrat in the House, charged that the president could
be risking "homeland security and foreign policy stability." Sen.
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a fierce partisan, said: "It makes no sense
to say we are at war and then block the bipartisan efforts of
Congress to protect the American people."</TE>
<TE>   In coming weeks, the president's shift on spending will
undoubtedly complicate already difficult negotiations over the annual
bills lawmakers must pass by year's end to keep the government
running.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers from both parties, long accustomed to cutting bipartisan
budget deals, are certain to seek to resurrect some of the spending
that Bush said he would kill.</TE>
<TE>   Some of it is money the president himself wants for aviation
security, economic aid to Israel and humanitarian relief for the
Palestinians, and global AIDS prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Some is money that influential lawmakers want for law enforcement,
defense and election reform, as well as more parochial concerns.</TE>
<TE>   White House aides signaled that those lawmakers--Republican and
Democrat alike--will have to reckon with a president unafraid to use
maximum executive power.</TE>
<TE>   Since taking office in January 2001, Bush has not used his veto
pen. But describing the president's action on Tuesday, Joshua Bolten,
the White House deputy chief of staff, said: "This is about as close
to a veto as there is."</TE>
<TE>   Karl Rove, Bush's chief political advisor, said the president was
not spoiling for a fight. "We're not taking on Congress--any more
than Congress took on the president," Rove said.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is a portion of a $29-billion anti-terrorism spending
bill that both houses of Congress overwhelmingly approved late last
month and Bush signed into law Aug. 2. Most of the spending was
proposed by the administration for military operations and homeland
security after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But $5.1 billion of it was added by Congress for various
initiatives lawmakers deemed urgent. To activate those funds, the
president had to agree with Congress and designate all of them for
emergency use. On Tuesday, he said he would not do so, effectively
killing those appropriations.</TE>
<TE>   In its effect, Bush's executive action is tantamount to a
line-item veto. Congress, however, has no power to override Bush, as
it could with a veto. Lawmakers who wish to pursue the spending
proposals must start over.</TE>
<TE>   Among the spending items that Bush nixed were:</TE>
<TE>   * More than $700 million for military operations and maintenance
and a defense emergency response fund;</TE>
<TE>   * $480 million for the troubled Transportation Security
Administration, which is struggling to tighten airport security with
such measures as bomb-detection machines;</TE>
<TE>   * $400 million for election reform;</TE>
<TE>   * $273 million for the Coast Guard;</TE>
<TE>   * $165 million for the FBI;</TE>
<TE>   * $90 million to monitor the health of emergency personnel who
responded to the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon;
and</TE>
<TE>   * Millions more for programs such as flood prevention, national
parks and even the Smithsonian Institution. Bush, in biting remarks,
derided one portion of funding as meant for "a new facility for
storing the government's collection of bugs and worms."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, members of Congress perennially stuff pet projects
into emergency spending bills. Bush has sharply criticized this
practice as "pork-barrel spending" but until now has been forced to
accept much of it as the price of doing business in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a game of chicken," said Forrest Maltzman, a political
scientist at George Washington University. "Members of Congress try
to use [spending bills] as a vehicle to get things through. And Bush
is now calling their bluff."</TE>

<HD>Guide Dies in Grand Canyon Fall</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>A physician and guide on a commercial river trip fell about 25 feet
to her death in the Grand Canyon, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Sabra Jones, 44, of Gallup, N.M., died Monday after the fall along
Havasu Creek, about three miles from the stream's confluence with the
Colorado River, National Park Service officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Rangers said they received a call Monday afternoon that someone
had fallen in the Havasu Creek area. A helicopter responded and
medics tried to treat Jones, but she died at the scene, rangers said.</LD>
<TE>   Jones was a board member of the Social Educational Environmental
Development Services, which was founded by a mountaineering guide to
provide basic necessities such as clean water and toilets for
impoverished villages in Nepal. A radiologist, she also provided
health care for the Navajo Nation and the Zuni Pueblo, according to a
biographical sketch on the SEEDS Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "No one was as full of life as Sabra," SEEDS co-founder Keith
Goldstein said Tuesday. "She was really the most active person I
knew. And she was a genius, really."</TE>
<TE>   Jones loved the outdoors and "threw herself into extreme
situations," Goldstein said. He said she recently returned from
Nepal.</TE>
<TE>   Employees at Rehoboth Christian Hospital, where Jones did some of
her work, attended a grief support session Tuesday morning, hospital
officials said. Hospital Vice President Bernice Brewer said radiology
department employees were distraught at news that Jones had died.</TE>
<TE>   The National Park Service and the Coconino County Sheriff's
Department are investigating.</TE>
<TE>   The river trip was being conducted by Tour West Inc., officials
said.</TE>

<HD>Even the Small Ideas Get an Airing</HD>
<DH>Economy: From broadband for rural areas to help for small
businesses, participants had thoughts on making U.S. more prosperous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WACO, Texas</DL>
<LD>Nancy Bacon had just what the economy needed, and she wanted Vice
President Dick Cheney to see it.</LD>
<LD>   "Solar cells," she said, holding up one of the panels made by her
company, Energy Conversion Devices of Troy, Mich. "I'd like to have
the administration think about using U.S. technology in some of their
programs."</LD>
<LD>   Curtis McGuire, owner of a Columbus, Ohio, trash hauling firm
called RedLeg's Lumper Service, told President Bush that health
insurance purchasing pools would help small businesses like his.</LD>
<TE>   Linda Aerni, chief executive of Community Internet Systems in
Columbus, Neb., said affordable broadband access for rural America
would make a big difference.</TE>
<TE>   One after another, participants in the president's economic forum
here offered their ideas Tuesday for making America--or at least
their little piece of it--more prosperous and productive.</TE>
<TE>   Most of their suggestions had little to do with revving up the
U.S. economy in the short term, to ensure that last year's
recessionary slump doesn't become this year's double dip. But they
were music to the ears of the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Although some of the 240 conference participants deviated from the
party line, most seemed inclined to build on existing policies and
programs designed to enhance America's long-term economic security.</TE>
<TE>   UPS driver Robert London of Waco said more international trade
agreements would mean more parcels for him to pick up and deliver.</TE>
<TE>   Discount broker Charles Schwab suggested bigger tax deductions for
stock losses and higher contribution limits for IRA and 401(k)
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Institute of Technology President Wayne Clough called for
more research and development affiliations between business and
academia.</TE>
<TE>   For many participants, the answer was not more of anything, but
less.</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Gornik, president of Theil Audio Products of Lexington, Ky.,
asked administration officials and conference participants to keep in
mind that a dollar taxed and spent by Washington on research and
development is a dollar removed from the private sector.</TE>
<TE>   "The message I want to leave with you is, whatever money you can
leave with me, that is a good thing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   George Dobbins, president of Southern Communications Systems of
Memphis, Tenn., was one of the few participants who dared to ask what
any of this had to do with averting another recession or propping up
the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'd like to know is, what is our short-range plan?" Dobbins
asked. "What can we do to get the economy going now? ... What can we
do about confidence?"</TE>
<TE>   He didn't get much of an answer.</TE>

<HD>Bush Upbeat, Sees Economy on Right Track</HD>
<DH>Business: President is optimistic on recovery. His
priorities are well-received at forum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WACO, Texas</DL>
<LD>President Bush and his economic team Tuesday heard a litany of
friendly advice from a cross-section of Americans on how to hasten an
economic recovery, a task whose urgency was underscored by a day of
more bad news about the nation's struggling economy and stumbling
stock market.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout some 14 hours of discussions, one participant after
another endorsed Bush's economic priorities, from medical malpractice
reform to the permanent abolition of the estate tax.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Democrats around the country accused the White House of
staging a public relations extravaganza to insulate Bush from voter
anger over the economy.</LD>
<TE>   "A made-for-TV economic forum isn't going to solve our problems,
or ease families' concerns," said Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.).</TE>
<TE>   But Bush described the gathering as a chance for him to "get a
report from what I call the front lines of the American economy." And
what he said he heard was: "Our economy has strengths that are
greater than the challenges."</TE>
<TE>   His upbeat remarks came near the end of a half-day conference at
Baylor University intended to highlight the president's concern about
the economy even while seeking to boost public and investor
confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Although the conference itself produced little news, the president
received sustained applause when he announced that he is rejecting
$5.1 billion in new spending approved by Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The American Airlines announcement of 7,000 new layoffs was only
one of several developments that intruded on the president's
conference.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates
unchanged, but warned that there is a growing risk of further
weakening of the economy, and said that it might cut rates later.</TE>
<TE>   Bush on Tuesday did not publicly mention the American Airlines
layoffs, part of a massive restructuring that will cut its work force
by 6%. But he was briefed on the news before he opened the forum.</TE>
<TE>   "He's obviously concerned," said Deputy White House Chief of Staff
Joshua Bolten.</TE>
<TE>   The forum's final, plenary session featured a rare, side-by-side
public appearance by Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks now, the vice president has been virtually absent from
the national spotlight amid the rash of corporate scandals over
fraudulent accounting. The firm he headed before becoming vice
president, Halliburton Co., is under investigation by the Securities
and Exchange Commission for its accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Although Cheney dropped in on four of the sessions, it was the
president who attended the one on corporate responsibility. The vice
president's only comment was that he was "here to listen."</TE>
<TE>   The conference was applauded by most of the guests, chosen to
represent what the White House described as representative of the
work force.</TE>
<TE>   They included about 240 Americans, from chief executives and
homemakers to small-business owners, academics and a handful of labor
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The forum "is very necessary, and I think, depending upon the
extent that we're listened to, it could be very, very useful," said
Jerry Levin, a small investor from Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Bush repeatedly told panelists that their ideas will be weighed,
telling the "economic recovery and job creation" session: "Any
recommendations that come out of this discussion will make it to my
desk."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, the president promoted anew the key elements of his
agenda, such as making permanent the $1.35-trillion tax cut, energy
independence and regulatory relief.</TE>
<TE>   Although he came with no fresh proposals, Bush delivered his
remarks with considerably more fervor than usual.</TE>
<TE>   He also expressed strong confidence in the economy's fundamental
strengths, declaring that, after three consecutive quarters of
positive growth, "the trend is in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Bush added:</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I know the hurdles. But I'm confident in America.... There
may be some tough times here in America, but this country has gone
through tough times before and we're going to do it again."</TE>
<TE>   The participants met in eight concurrent sessions to discuss
topics such as trade, corporate responsibility, health care and
retirement security. Senior administration officials, including
Cabinet secretaries, presided. Bush and Cheney dropped in briefly on
four sessions each before they jointly attended the plenary session.</TE>
<TE>   Several times, Bush told the retirement security panel he would
like to see simplified corporate financial statements and annual
reports "so that people can understand what they're looking at."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who holds an MBA from Harvard, also called on business
schools to emphasize corporate ethics. "Our business schools don't
want to teach right from wrong anymore," he fumed.</TE>
<TE>   The president also put some heft behind one of his prescriptions
for economic recovery: that Congress must refrain from excessive
spending.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the widespread support among the participants for Bush
policies, a few veered off the day's agenda.</TE>
<TE>   One woman, for example, called for a lifting of trade sanctions on
Cuba--definitely not Bush administration policy. That prompted Trade
Representative Robert B. Zoellick to joke: "See, we have a whole
range of opinions."</TE>
<TE>   Karl Rove, the president's chief political strategist, said after
the forum that he was struck by the "unanimity" of opinion between
people from Main Street and Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   He also said Bush relished the opportunity to "engage in a
dialogue with ordinary people."</TE>
<TE>   In a discussion about Medicare, Bush exchanged quips with Flora
Green, a senior activist from Salt Lake City who poked fun at
bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>   At another point, Bush strode across the room for a close-up chat
with Lucinda Harman, a Salado, Texas, registered nurse confined to a
wheelchair. When Harman's service dog, Quint, did not respond to
Bush's attention, the president quipped: "He was afraid I was going
to give a speech."</TE>
<TE>   The president said throughout the day that he was there to hear
from the guests. Bush listened attentively, often taking notes.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, who before the conference even began criticized the
lack of diverse opinions at the forum, did not let up afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "Under this administration, we've lost nearly 2 million jobs, $7
trillion in the market and more than $5 trillion of the surplus,"
Daschle said.</TE>
<TE>   In his closing remarks, Bush may have unwittingly reinforced
Democrats' complaints about the highly orchestrated event by thanking
Baylor for "putting on a great show."</TE>

<HD>In Gay Rights, Private Sector Is 'Unlikely Hero,' Survey
Finds</HD>
<DH>Reform: Businesses lead the way in ending bias in benefits,
other workplace issues, advocacy group says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA FACKLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Private industry is leading the way in ending discrimination against
gay and lesbian employees and providing benefits to same-sex domestic
partners, according to a survey released Tuesday by a gay and lesbian
political organization.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 319 companies surveyed by Human Rights Campaign, a
Washington-based advocacy group, 92% had written statements
prohibiting discrimination because of sexual orientation, and 69%
offered health insurance benefits for same-sex domestic
relationships. By comparison, the federal government offers no
benefits for unmarried partners--gay or straight--of its employees,
although legislation has been introduced to provide such coverage.</LD>
<LD>   "The truth is, it's corporate America that has been the unlikely
hero in the movement for equality for gay and lesbian Americans,"
said Elizabeth Birch, executive director of Human Rights Campaign.</LD>
<TE>   The group's Corporate Equality Index rated companies on seven
factors, including written nondiscrimination policies addressing
sexual orientation and gender identity or expression, health
insurance for employees' same-sex domestic partners, sensitive
marketing and advertising campaigns, and official corporate support
for equal rights for gays and lesbians.</TE>
<TE>   The results were based on responses received from companies
surveyed, examination of similar surveys done in the past, Human
Rights Campaign's own database of corporate policies, news accounts,
and information from employee groups and individuals. Before the
companies were rated, the information collected was also examined by
outside experts, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   On a scale of 0 to 100, corporate America averaged 57. Thirteen
companies, including California-based Intel Corp. and Apple Computer
Inc., received a rating of 100. A quarter of the companies surveyed
ranked second-best at 86, including American Airlines, Eastman Kodak
Co., Nike and Xerox Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Eight companies, including FedEx Corp., Domino's Pizza Inc. and
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., scored 14, the second-lowest category, because
they neither overtly resisted nor supported equal treatment of gay
and lesbian employees. CBRL Group Inc. (Cracker Barrel restaurants),
Emerson Electric Co., and Lockheed Martin Corp. received a 0 rating.</TE>
<TE>   "Equality and fair treatment in the workplace is no longer just
about doing the right thing; it is also a bottom-line issue," said
Birch, who joined the advocacy group from Apple Computer in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   California had the second-highest number of companies rated in the
survey and is among eight states with an average score of 71, well
above the national average.</TE>

<HD>FDA to Reassess the Risks of Hormone Therapy</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Study finds serious side effects in combination
drugs containing estrogen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal officials announced Tuesday that they have begun a major
reassessment of the risks and benefits of all combination hormone
products containing estrogen used by post-menopausal women, one month
after a large government study found potentially serious side effects
from hormone replacement therapy.</LD>
<LD>   The reassessment, which will include several public forums this
fall sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the Food and
Drug Administration and the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality will also try to guide future research.</LD>
<LD>   The move marks the first significant action by the federal
government in response to the latest findings about hormone therapy.
It is designed to address the widespread confusion that has caused
anxious women to inundate doctors with questions about whether they
should continue taking the powerful hormones.</LD>
<TE>   "Somebody needed to take a leadership role, because there is chaos
in the medical societies," said Wulf H. Utian, executive director of
the North American Menopause Society, who has been invited to
participate in the meetings. "It's time to clear the air and address
the issues."</TE>
<TE>   The brief announcement of the initiative came as the FDA
separately pushed for immediate changes in the label and the package
insert for the hormone combination sold as Prempro to reflect the
risks confirmed by the Women's Health Initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Part of that federally funded study was stopped three years early
because of small but statistically significant increases in heart
disease, breast cancer, stroke and blood clots among women taking
Prempro, a combined estrogen-progestin drug. Although the study used
only Prempro, agency officials said they have new questions about
other estrogen-progestin products on the market.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the immediate FDA concerns, officials at Wyeth
Pharmaceuticals, maker of Prempro, said the company expects to submit
new safety precaution information as early as this week that will
take into account the Women's Health Initiative findings. The
initiative's study tested the widely held hypothesis that hormone
therapy reduced the risk for heart disease in particular and, so, was
especially surprising.</TE>
<TE>   These initial steps can be taken without formal FDA approval. But
officials said that they are aggressively reviewing hormone
replacement therapy generally--now used by 14 million American
women--and that more wide-ranging changes can be expected.</TE>

<HD>Authorities Identify Man Who Killed 3 Virginia Girls in
1990s</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>SPOTSYLVANIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>Overwhelming evidence proves that a South Carolina man abducted and
killed three girls here in the mid-1990s, authorities announced
Tuesday, ending a frustrating criminal investigation and bringing
some peace to a community that had lived in fear of a serial killer.</LD>
<LD>   The families of Sofia Silva, 16, and Kristin and Kati Lisk, 15 and
12, looked on tearfully as members of a task force on the case
described how DNA analysis showed that hair from Richard Marc Evonitz
matched hairs found on the bodies of all three girls, and how blue
acrylic fibers from a pair of "furry" handcuffs he owned were
gathered from the three. Evonitz killed himself in June. Perhaps the
most damning evidence, authorities said--a palm print and
fingerprints matching Kristin Lisk's from the inside of the trunk of
Evonitz's car--was described by one forensic scientist as a "miracle"
because they were found five years after the abduction.</LD>
<LD>   The families said there is some comfort in knowing that the man is
dead.</LD>

<HD>Texas Execution Still Scheduled</HD>
<DH>Crime: Texas parole board rejects Mexico, U.N. pleas over a
man who killed police officer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HUNTSVILLE, Texas</DL>
<LD>Despite requests from the Mexican government and the United Nations,
the Texas parole board refused Tuesday to halt the scheduled
execution of a Mexican citizen for killing a police officer.</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Pardons and Paroles voted, 17 to 0, against commuting
Javier Suarez Medina's sentence to life in prison. The panel also
voted against recommending to Gov. Rick Perry that Suarez be given a
90-day reprieve.</LD>
<LD>   The Mexican government and the U.N. have asked U.S. authorities to
stop today's execution.</LD>
<TE>   Supporters say the 33-year-old Suarez should be spared because he
was not allowed legal help from the Mexican government when he was
arrested for killing Dallas Police Officer Lawrence Cadena during an
undercover drug transaction in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Suarez, who was 19 at the time of the shooting, should have been
informed that his Mexican birth entitled him to assistance from the
Mexican government under terms of the Vienna Convention, an
international agreement signed in 1963 by the United States,
according to supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "That issue was thoroughly reviewed by members," said Gerald
Garrett, chairman of the parole board.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said it was unclear whether Suarez was born in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican Senate ran half-page advertisements in some Texas
newspapers this week urging Perry and the parole board to approve
clemency and for "suspension of his execution, to allow a more
exhaustive evaluation of his case."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico President Vicente Fox also wrote Perry, calling the
punishment "illegal," and discussed the issue by phone with the
governor Monday.</TE>

<HD>Hatfill Wrote Novel About Bioterrorism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A draft novel by a scientist under scrutiny in the anthrax
investigation describes a biological attack by a Palestinian
terrorist on the White House and Congress, but the plot differs
significantly from last fall's attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The novel by Dr. Steven J. Hatfill has raised suspicions at the
FBI, though the story involves neither anthrax nor mailings. It does,
however, contain some on-target observations about how the nation
would react to bioterrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The agent used in the attacks is the bacterium Yersinia pestis,
which causes bubonic plague. It is first released in the White House
through sprayers in a wheelchair, sickening the president and later
members of Congress. The villain is a Palestinian funded by Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Titled "Emergence," the 198-page unfinished novel is on file at
the U.S. Copyright Office. It was registered in 1998 by Roger Akers,
a friend of Hatfill's who said Tuesday that he proofread it for
Hatfill and, with his permission, copyrighted it in both of their
names.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI also has a copy of the novel. On Tuesday, a law
enforcement official called it an "interesting coincidence at this
point."</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials say Hatfill, a biowarfare expert, is one
of about 30 "persons of interest" in the investigation of last fall's
attacks, which killed five people. On Sunday, Hatfill denied he had
any involvement in the attacks.</TE>

<HD>Florida Child Welfare Chief Resigns Amid Criticisms</HD>
<DH>Services: Kathleen A. Kearney had been denounced for her
agency's failings. She was seen as a political liability to Gov.
Bush.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Kathleen A. Kearney resigned Tuesday as head of Florida's child
welfare agency following months of criticism for blunders and
oversights by the department, which notoriously lost a 5-year-old
girl in its care.</LD>
<LD>   Kearney's continued presence in the position was seen by some as a
political liability for Republican Gov. Jeb Bush, who appointed her
and is seeking reelection in November. He accepted her resignation
immediately. It will take effect Sept. 3.</LD>
<LD>   As of last month, Kearney's department said it could not account
for 532 children it said had run away from foster homes or had been
abducted by parents against court orders.</LD>
<TE>   Over the weekend, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel newspaper
reported that it had been able to locate nine of the children, two of
them after less than three hours of searching.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats had seized on the holes in the state's child protection
system as a welcome campaign issue against an incumbent who appears
comfortably ahead in the polls.</TE>
<TE>   Former U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, a Democratic gubernatorial
candidate, said in the spring that Bush "came into office saying he
was going to do something about the child welfare system, but it's
only getting worse."</TE>
<TE>   In her letter of resignation, made public in Tallahassee, Kearney
said she decided to quit after much reflection and prayer, but she
gave no reason.</TE>
<TE>   "This job, often referred to as the toughest in state government,
has been the most rewarding and challenging of a lifetime," said
Kearney, a former prosecutor and juvenile court judge.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to believe that during my stay here it can be said
that: She believed, she hoped, she tried, she failed often enough,
but with God's grace, she accomplished more than she rationally could
have dreamed," she wrote in her letter to the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Bush praised Kearney's "tireless devotion to the protection of
Florida's children" and said he would quickly appoint a successor to
"continue the work of making our child welfare system function better
for these most vulnerable Floridians."</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Children &amp; Families has been under intense
criticism and scrutiny for years, but both intensified four months
ago when it became known that Rilya Wilson, a 5-year-old foster
child, had vanished while in state custody. The Miami-area girl had
been missing since January 2001, and no caseworker had checked on her
for 15 months. She is still missing.</TE>
<TE>   More headline-generating problems followed.</TE>
<TE>   A department caseworker filed a report saying a 2-year-old boy was
fine, but Polk County sheriff's deputies found the child had been
beaten to death before the caseworker's supposed visit. Another
department worker who police said was drunk and unconscious was
arrested in her car in Coral Gables with a baby who was officially in
her care in the back seat.</TE>
<TE>   Bush had publicly defended Kearney against the rising chorus from
child advocates and legislators that she be fired, but on Tuesday,
the day she quit, a Democratic lawmaker charged that the governor's
1999 appointee was no longer trusted.</TE>
<TE>   "The public, department employees and members of the Legislature
had grave concerns in Secretary Kearney's ability to effect
substantive policy changes and protect the vulnerable citizens
entrusted to her care," state Sen. Ron Klein said in a letter to
Bush. "All confidence in Secretary Kearney is lost, and, once again,
Florida is being held up as a national example of how not to do
things."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Levine, president of the Center for Florida's Children, an
advocacy group, has been a frequent critic of Kearney and of the
department she has headed. He said Tuesday he believed the secretary
had not been sacrificed for political gain but had simply been worn
down by the job and the mounting controversy focused on it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is the personal decision of someone who on each of
the 100 days since Rilya's disappearance has lived under tremendous
pressure," Levine said. "Trust me, this is a department, where there
is a tragedy a day, that is supposed to help the people most
vulnerable. Control of child abuse, control of drug abuse, control of
elder abuse is their task. Anyone who can stay in that job for 3 1/2
years needs to be credited for that tenure."</TE>
<TE>   Bush came to office in 1998 vowing to fix an already troubled
department and has more than doubled its budget. But by all accounts,
Florida's child protection system remains greatly overburdened, with
caseworkers struggling with a caseload far above the recommended
norms.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, as word of Kearney's resignation became public, so did
news of yet another apparent error in judgment by the Department of
Children &amp; Families.</TE>
<TE>   It conducted three separate abuse investigations into the home of
a 4-year-old Riviera Beach boy, but took no action to remove the
child, who was later fatally beaten. Tarquez Woodson was removed from
life support Friday and died of head and body trauma. His stepfather,
D'Andre Bannister, 20, has been arrested and charged with aggravated
manslaughter.</TE>

<LD>A woman who has gone from aircraft cleaning to passenger screening is
among the first wave of federal security officers deployed Tuesday at
Newark International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Danise Daville was one of 150 federal screeners deployed at the
airport. The new Transportation Security Administration still needs
850 more there by Nov. 19, the deadline for government security to
replace all private checkers at the nation's 429 commercial airports
under a law passed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York

<HD>Rapper's Relative Found Dead After Standoff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>The brother-in-law of rap performer Snoop Dogg was found dead Tuesday
in a barricaded apartment, 11 hours after wounding a Las Vegas police
officer in a struggle on the street.</LD>
<LD>   Police were investigating whether Jermaine Fuller died of a
self-inflicted wound or had been shot while fighting with the
officer, during which police said Fuller's gun was fired at least
twice.</LD>
<LD>   Las Vegas police Lt. Vincent Cannito said officers did not shoot
at Fuller during the initial confrontation, during the overnight
standoff or when a SWAT team entered the apartment a few miles from
the Las Vegas Strip.</LD>
<TE>   David Fox, lawyer for Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Calvin
Broadus, said Fuller was the brother of Broadus' wife, Shante.</TE>
<TE>   "The family is grieving over this sad news," Fox told Associated
Press.</TE>
<TE>   The incident began about 11:20 p.m. Monday when an unidentified
man flagged down a Las Vegas police officer and said a man had
confronted him and fired a gun. The man was not wounded.</TE>
<TE>   The officer approached Fuller near a bus stop and a struggle
ensued during which at least two shots were fired, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The unidentified officer was grazed on the side of his head,
Cannito said. He also was shot in the chest, but was protected by a
bulletproof vest, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "The bulletproof vest ... saved his life," Lt. David O'Leary said.</TE>
<TE>   Another officer, in a patrol car, had a bullet strike the radio
microphone clipped to his shoulder. He was not injured.</TE>
<TE>   Cannito said the gunman ran to an apartment complex near the
University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus and forced his way inside,
taking an unidentified tenant hostage. The male hostage escaped about
an hour later by diving out a first-floor window.</TE>
<TE>   O'Leary said the police SWAT team entered the apartment Tuesday
morning, using tear gas and flash-bang grenades. He said about 40
residents had been evacuated from the complex, and that no officers
or neighbors were injured.</TE>
<TE>   The officer wounded in the initial confrontation was in serious
condition at University Medical Center in Las Vegas, a hospital
spokesman said. He was expected to recover.</TE>

<HD>Crash Survivor Marks Year of Recovery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>More than a year after her sightseeing helicopter crashed in the
Grand Canyon, survivor Chana Daskal remains in the New York Weill
Cornell burn unit at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, recovering from
the third-degree burns she suffered over 85% of her body.</LD>
<LD>   "With the one-year mark, it is a pretty emotional time," said Gary
C. Robb, her attorney. "A lot of people didn't think she was going to
make it. She struggles every day. She is a triumph of the human
spirit and the desire to live."</LD>
<LD>   Federal investigators still are reviewing what caused the Aug. 10,
2001, Papillon Grand Canyon Helicopters tour crash near Meadview,
Ariz., about 100 miles east of Las Vegas.</LD>
<TE>   Daskal, 26, who is from the Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of
Seagate in Brooklyn, N.Y., was the only survivor of the crash. Five
New York City tourists, including her husband, were killed, along
with the pilot.</TE>
<TE>   The National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report said
Daskal told rescuers that the aircraft "got quiet and fell from the
sky." The NTSB has said the investigation has been hampered because
much of the American Eurocopter AS350 B2 helicopter was destroyed in
the crash. A spokeswoman for the agency said a final finding on the
cause of the crash may not be released until fall.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Daskal has undergone 42 operations. Most were skin
grafts, but she also has had her left leg and right foot amputated
and operations to stabilize her back, which was broken in the crash.
She is paralyzed from the waist down.</TE>
<TE>   Daskal spent seven months in the University Medical Center burn
unit in Las Vegas before she was taken to Brooklyn in February,
spending only about three weeks at home before being transferred to
the Staten Island University Hospital intensive care unit.</TE>
<TE>   Her sons, 4-year-old Eli and 1-year-old Avi, are living with
Daskal's twin sister, Brache Rosenberg. Daskal has incurred $4.5
million in medical expenses, Robb said.</TE>
<TE>   "She is a medical miracle. Her doctors have repeatedly said that
what she has gone through and how she has been able to progress is
just remarkable," Robb said. "She wants to see her kids grow up. She
told me, 'I need to be alive to raise my children.' "</TE>
<TE>   Daskal has filed a lawsuit in Clark County, Nev., District Court
against Papillon Airways Inc., based in Grand Canyon, Ariz. The
lawsuit, which alleges pilot error and a faulty engine caused the
crash, also names the pilot's estate and American Eurocopter Corp.
and Turbomeca Engine Corp., two manufacturers of helicopter and
engine parts in Texas.</TE>

<HD>Amtrak Suspends High-Speed Train Service</HD>
<DH>Rail: Acela Express fleet is pulled after cracks are found
in shock-absorber assemblies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Amtrak pulled its high-speed Acela Express trains out of service
Tuesday after discovering cracks in shock-absorber assemblies, the
latest in a summer-long series of financial and public-image blows to
the struggling passenger railroad.</LD>
<LD>   The entire fleet of 18 trains was halted after inspectors
discovered the cracks beneath several locomotives. Amtrak President
David Gunn said the trains would remain out of service for at least a
few days.</LD>
<LD>   Eight of the first 10 train sets inspected had problems, spokesman
Bill Schulz said. Each train set includes two locomotives, and each
locomotive has four of the shock-absorbing "yaw dampers."</LD>
<TE>   Inspections were continuing on the eight other Acela Express
trains, which operate only between Washington, New York and Boston
and are capable of a speed of 150 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Gunn met Tuesday afternoon with representatives of
Bombardier-North America and France's Alstom Ltd., the trains'
manufacturers, to design a repair plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working with the manufacturer on a temporary fix," Gunn
said. "We've got to make sure it's safe." He added that he believes
the repairs will be covered under Amtrak's contract with the
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak put additional conventional trains into service to try to
fill the service gap. Riders accustomed to the reserved seats and
comforts of Acela Express had to make do.</TE>
<TE>   "The train was packed and I had to stand," said Julio Francisco,
of Newark, N.J., after arriving in Philadelphia on Tuesday morning.
Other passengers arriving in Philadelphia later Tuesday said nobody
had to stand on their trains.</TE>
<TE>   Bombardier spokeswoman Carol Sharpe said the company was waiting
for its technical team to report its findings.</TE>
<TE>   Other Amtrak trains that serve the busy Northeast Corridor,
including Acela Regional and Metroliner service, are not affected.
"We're bringing as much equipment as we can into service to make up
for the shortfall," Schulz said.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak pledged to credit passengers for the difference in ticket
prices between Acela Express and the trains they take.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers were encouraged to check departures by visiting
Amtrak's Web site or calling (800) USA-RAIL.</TE>
<TE>   Acela Express is Amtrak's premier service in its busiest market.
More than 10,000 people ride the trains on a typical weekday,
enjoying amenities including a pub-style cafe car and electrical
outlets at every seat.</TE>

<HD>EPA Puts Idahoans in Charge of Cleanup</HD>
<DH>Environment: One of the biggest Superfund projects in U.S.
targets mining pollution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho</DL>
<LD>Federal, state and tribal representatives signed an unprecedented
Idaho plan Tuesday that puts local officials in charge of one of the
country's largest Superfund cleanups.</LD>
<LD>   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie Whitman
presided over the signing ceremony in a conference room seven stories
above Lake Coeur d'Alene.</LD>
<LD>   The pending $359-million Coeur d'Alene Basin cleanup plan does not
anticipate listing the lake itself as a Superfund site, although
numerous hot spots of mining pollution will need to be scrubbed, she
said.</LD>
<TE>   Wastes from more than a century of mining in northern Idaho's
Silver Valley have washed down the Coeur d'Alene River into the lake,
the headwaters of the Spokane River, which flows into Washington
state where it meets the Columbia River.</TE>
<TE>   An agreement signed by federal, state and tribal officials
establishes the Coeur d'Alene Basin Commission, which will direct
cleanup efforts called for in the EPA's decision, due later this
month.</TE>
<TE>   The decision affects areas of the 1,500-square-mile basin outside
an existing Superfund site.</TE>
<TE>   The five-member commission is composed of three Idaho elected
officials, EPA Regional Director John Iani and a representative of
the Coeur d'Alene tribe in Idaho. Washington state will have a
nonvoting member, appointed by the governor.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush "believes very firmly that not all wisdom resides
in Washington [D.C.], that the best solutions to problems often come
from those people closest to the problems," Whitman said before Iani
signed the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement was toasted with glasses of lake water.</TE>
<TE>   "Lake Coeur d'Alene is safe. We will continue to ensure that the
standards are met," Whitman said. "We are confident that, with the
plan for the lake, it will continue to get cleaner."</TE>

<HD>Glaus in Winner's Circle</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He leads the AL in game-winning RBIs and adds
another as Angels top Tigers, 7-6, in 12 innings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What lies ahead is so much more intriguing.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, the Angels could only face what was right in front of
them.</LD>
<LD>   That was the Detroit Tigers, last in the American League Central,
last in the majors in scoring, and first in the majors in errors.</LD>
<TE>   A trip to New York and a wild-card showdown in Boston wait next
week.</TE>
<TE>   But here were the Tigers--on a night that for them, rated as a
good one.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers, stubborn for once, took the Angels to 12 innings
Tuesday night before Troy Glaus singled to left to drive in the
winning run of a 7-6 victory in front of 19,694 at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Wooten, who had entered the game in the 10th as a
pinch-hitter, scored from second after reaching on a double.</TE>
<TE>   The game-winning RBI was the 16th of the season for Glaus--the
most by any player in the American League.</TE>
<TE>   Al Levine (4-2) pitched the 12th for the victory, which kept the
Angels two games behind Seattle in the American League West and
increased their lead over Boston in the wild-card race to two games.</TE>
<TE>   They had to come back to do it.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers forced the Angels to extra innings, then managed to
take a 6-5 lead in the 11th on a controversial call at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   With one out and Shane Halter on first after a single, Carlos Pena
drove the ball to left and Halter came all the way around to score a
controversial run on a close play. The question was whether catcher
Jose Molina made the tag on David Eckstein's relay from Garret
Anderson. Halter slid past the plate, but was coming back to touch
it, and the Angel fans made it clear they thought the call was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Angels came back in the bottom of the 11th.</TE>
<TE>   With runners on first and third and none out, Darin
Erstad--sitting out with a sore right leg--came in to pinch-hit for
Molina.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad's single off Juan Acevedo over the head of the shortstop
into center tied the game by driving in Glaus, who had doubled to
lead off the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter who we're playing, we've got to win," Erstad
said. "It was a tough one today. They scratched and clawed and so did
we."</TE>
<TE>   One out later, the Angels had the bases loaded, but Eckstein's
shallow fly ball wasn't deep enough to score a run, and Orlando
Palmeiro grounded out to third to send it to the 12th.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had shut out Detroit on Monday, but even before the
game, they swore they weren't thinking of this weekend against
Cleveland or next week's Eastern trip.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of players even called Detroit "a good team," earning
raised eyebrows.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ever look ahead, you're going to get beat," shortstop
Eckstein insisted.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Tigers, it wasn't so much the feeling they might get
beat as that they might get dragged late into the night.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 5-5, after eight innings, Manager Mike
Scioscia chose to use closer Troy Percival in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   He did his job, but the Angels' chances in the ninth against Jeff
Farnsworth slipped away.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Spiezio reached base on an error with one out after Carlos
Pena--a defensive replacement at first--fielded Spiezio's grounder
and tossed it awkwardly over the head of Farnsworth, covering first.</TE>
<TE>   Molina singled, but Spiezio was thrown out at third.</TE>
<TE>   Another single by Adam Kennedy moved Molina to second.</TE>
<TE>   But Alex Ochoa popped up to end the inning, and that meant extra
innings.</TE>
<TE>   With Percival already expended, Ben Weber came in to start the
10th, and despite allowing two runners to reach base, he struck out
pinch-hitter George Lombard with a runner on second to end the
inning.</TE>
<TE>   The game began with the Angels' streak of 22 innings without
giving up a run ending quickly.</TE>
<TE>   After consecutive shutouts anchored by starters Jarrod Washburn
and Kevin Appier, Aaron Sele's prospects of helping the club manage a
third in a row for the first time since 1974 evaporated in the first
inning when the Angels quickly fell behind, 2-0.</TE>

<HD>Arum Survives Crash</HD>
<DH>Accident: Boxing promoter, six others not seriously injured
after twin-engine Cessna overshoots runway at Big Bear Lake and
bursts into flames.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER and ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BIG BEAR LAKE</DL>
<LD>An executive jet carrying boxing promoter Bob Arum and six other
people crash-landed and burst into flames at the airport here Tuesday
morning, but no one was seriously injured.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Aviation Administration said the twin-engine Cessna
Citation 550 skidded off the end of the 5,850-foot runway, burst
through a chain-link fence, hurtled across a road and skidded to a
halt in a small field.</LD>
<LD>   "The plane was a ball of fire when it went through that fence,"
said Deputy Stan Wajnhamer of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's
Department.</LD>
<TE>   As the cabin filled with smoke, co-pilot Craig Terry managed to
open the fuselage door, and everyone aboard scrambled to safety
before the flames destroyed most of the jet.</TE>
<TE>   "When I went through that door, it was a wall of flame," Arum
said.</TE>
<TE>   The small jet had taken off from Las Vegas for the 100-mile flight
to Big Bear Lake, where the passengers later attended the opening day
of training camp for World Boxing Council super welterweight champion
Oscar De La Hoya. De La Hoya is scheduled to defend his title at the
Mandalay Bay Resort Hotel in Las Vegas next month.</TE>
<TE>   Those aboard the jet included Arum, the 70-year-old chief of Top
Rank Inc.; Scott Voeller, marketing director of the resort; H. C.
Rowe, the hotel's director of events and entertainment; Las Vegas
Review-Journal sportswriters Royce Feour and Kevin Iole, copilot
Terry and the pilot, Joseph Tophan.</TE>
<TE>   Feour was taken to Bear Valley Community Hospital, where he was
treated for minor injuries and released.</TE>
<TE>   The plane, built in 1985, was registered to Melita Eagle Inc. in
Wilmington, Del.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the crash and the source of the fire were not
immediately determined, and neither pilot commented on what happened,
according to Wajnhamer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a small runway, a big plane and, based on what some of the
passengers said, they just came in too low and too fast, but that's
speculation," the sheriff's deputy said.</TE>
<TE>   Arum said Voeller realized something was amiss as the plane
approached the runway, shouting, "Hang on, guys, we're going to miss
the runway," as the jet was about to touch down.</TE>
<TE>   Aviation sources said that because of the air temperature of about
85 degrees and the airport's altitude of 6,748 feet, the jet probably
landed faster than it would have in cooler temperatures at a lower
altitude.</TE>
<TE>   "They say any time you walk away from a plane crash, you're
lucky," Wajnhamer said. "But figure that plane bounced off the
runway, that it was on fire when it crossed the road, that it
screeched to a stop in the field, and then you look at what's left of
it and you have to say it is miraculous that everyone survived."</TE>
<TE>   John Morley, assistant fire chief for Big Bear Lake, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It is fairly remarkable," he said. "It you looked at the
wreckage, you wouldn't have high expectations anyone survived."</TE>
<TE>   The five passengers boarded a second plane sent by Mandalay Bay
late Tuesday afternoon for the return to Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "The odds are in my favor," Arum said. "It can't happen twice in
the same day."</TE>

<HD>Home Is Not So Sweet for Gagne</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After getting ovation in hometown, he gives up
game-winning homer and Expos beat Dodgers, 4-3.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>The thrill of pitching in his hometown before a few hundred family
members and friends, and a crowd that greeted him with a standing
ovation, wore off for Dodger closer Eric Gagne as quickly as Troy
O'Leary's eighth-inning laser left the park Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   O'Leary blindsided Gagne, lining his first pitch, a 97-mph
fastball, over the wall in right-center field for a two-run home run
with two out in the eighth to lift the Montreal Expos to a 4-3
victory over the Dodgers before 13,263 in Olympic Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Gagne's third blown save of the season--and first since July
3--dropped the Dodgers a season-high eight games behind Arizona in
the National League West and into second place in the NL wild-card
race, a half-game behind San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   It was the sixth homer Gagne (1-1) has allowed in 58 2/3 innings
this season, and it spoiled starter Andy Ashby's strong 7 2/3-inning
performance, in which he allowed three runs and eight hits while
striking out five.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of those things, he may have been over-pumped," Dodger
catcher Paul Lo Duca said. "He's pitching in front of the home crowd,
he gets a standing ovation.... It's probably my fault. I should have
gone out there and settled him down.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to joke with him [when he entered the game] but he was
focused. It was a tough situation--you have 300 people watching you
play, you're an icon here, he's human. The guy hit the ball out of
the park. What are you gonna do? You have to give O'Leary credit."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne didn't think he had too much adrenaline when he entered the
game with Vladimir Guerrero, who reached on a two-out single off
Ashby, on first.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I was a little anxious, but when you step between the lines
you have a job to do, and I didn't do it," Gagne said. "We played a
great game, we battled for eight innings, and I blew it."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne isn't the only Dodger reliever to watch a late-inning lead
disappear in recent weeks. Since July 21, the Dodger bullpen has
combined for a 5.90 earned-run average, seven blown saves and has
given up 14 home runs in 21 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers also blew an excellent chance to tie the score in the
top of the ninth Tuesday after Lo Duca led off with a double and was
replaced by pinch-runner Cesar Izturis. Eric Karros struck out, Mark
Grudzielanek bounced back to the pitcher, Izturis advancing to third,
and reliever Scott Stewart struck out pinch-hitter Mike Kinkade to
end the game.</TE>
<TE>   "This is definitely a tough loss," said right fielder Shawn Green,
who had three hits and scored a run. "We've struggled in the late
innings. It's almost like we're snake-bitten. We've had trouble in
close games late.... We're playing good baseball, but it seems like
it's one play, one pitch, one swing that is making the difference in
these close games."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night it was a pitch, a thigh-high fastball over the
middle to a hitter Gagne had never faced.</TE>
<TE>   "They read the scouting reports, they know I throw a lot of
fastballs," Gagne said. "If I locate the pitch, it's no big deal, but
I just didn't get it down and away enough, and he got it. It was
right down the middle, and he put good wood on it."</TE>
<TE>   The homer hit the Dodgers like a stun gun.</TE>
<TE>   "I've played against O'Leary for a lot of years, and I know he's
very capable of doing that," Green said. "Still, it's tough to do
that with a 97-mph fastball, and it's the first time you've ever seen
a guy."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had turned a 2-1 deficit into a 3-2 lead with two runs
in the fifth, a rally that began when Alex Cora reached on second
baseman Jose Vidro's fielding error with one out.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby bunted Cora to second, and Dave Roberts and Marquis Grissom
came through with clutch, two-out, run-scoring hits, Roberts' turning
what looked like an RBI single into a hustle double and putting
himself in scoring position for Grissom's single up the middle.</TE>
<TE>   But Ashby, who allowed two runs in the first and blanked the Expos
for the next six innings, couldn't close the eighth, giving up
Guerrero's single after retiring the first two batters. Manager Jim
Tracy summoned Gagne, who hadn't pitched in three days.</TE>
<TE>   "One pitch can win the game, and one pitch can lose the game,"
Tracy said. "There's nothing you can do differently there. We had
four outs to win, our closer was fresh and ready to go, and the guy
hit a ball out of the park."</TE>

<HD>Taking the Grand Out of Slam</HD>
<DH>Golf: When Woods' historic bid was derailed in Scotland,
PGA Championship became minor major.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Were it not for one, rain-drenched, wind-swept, dirty-rotten Scottish
third round at last month's British Open, this week's 84th PGA
Championship at Hazeltine National Golf Club could have been golf's
equivalent to, what, the Lindbergh landing?</LD>
<LD>   The PGA of America's annual ball, already fighting the tag as the
least significant of the four major championships, was frothing at
the chance to host the ticker-tape parade for Woods who, had he won
the British, would have been gunning this week for golf's Grand Slam.</LD>
<LD>   You wonder who took Woods' third-round 81 at Muirfield hardest,
Woods, the PGA, or CBS, which could have rung up gargantuan ratings
this week with Woods poised to make history.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, because Woods couldn't get over that hump at Muirfield, this
isn't the final climb for Tiger.</TE>
<TE>   It's just another glorified week on the PGA schedule, just another
major (minor), a chance for David Toms to defend his title.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, the PGA doesn't see it that way at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel like we've lost anything by him not winning the
British," Jim Awtrey, the PGA's chief executive, said of Woods.
"Tiger is still the person to beat. And you've still got Tiger going
against Ernie Els and it's a month before the Ryder Cup. Those are
good factors. I don't think we're at any disadvantage."</TE>
<TE>   What did you expect the guy to say, that Woods' third-round bobble
at the British felt like a knife wound to the heart?</TE>
<TE>   That it's a crying shame the PGA, which gets overshadowed in
August by company picnics and back-to-school sales, couldn't finally
catch a break and become can't-miss television?</TE>
<TE>   Woods, too, has to be disappointed, yet he can't really come out
and say it.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the red-carpet media bombing Nike would have unveiled, or
the "Grand Slam" references other Wood sponsors, Buick and American
Express, could have rolled into production.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, plenty is left for the taking. By winning the PGA, Woods
will have claimed three majors in one season for a second time.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Hogan is the only other golfer to have accomplished the feat,
and Hogan did it only once.</TE>
<TE>   Woods also is out to win his eighth major tournament in his last
13 tries.</TE>
<TE>   Still, because he isn't going for the Grand Slam, Tuesday's
opening news conference lacked the circus element.</TE>
<TE>   It was big tent, but not big top.</TE>
<TE>   Woods joked that the press coverage for his potential Grand Slam
had distorted an otherwise fabulous year that continued last week
with his win at the Buick Open.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's your responsibility, and your fault, for doing
that build-up," he chided.</TE>
<TE>   He said the 81 at Muirfield could have happened to anyone. That it
could even happen again here.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Nicklaus, a five-time PGA Championship winner, carded his
highest score in major championship play when he shot an 81 in the
1970 U.S. Open--here at Hazeltine.</TE>
<TE>   "I explained it, you guys saw it," Woods said of his 81. "It
wasn't exactly easy conditions on Saturday of an Open championship.
That's what happens sometimes.</TE>
<TE>   "But I've had a great year. Any time you can win one major
championship in a year, it's going to be a successful year. I think
winning two in one year so far, it's been even better. I'd like to
make it three."</TE>
<TE>   There is no doubt, though, that this week's tournament has lost
luster.</TE>
<TE>   The PGA Championship officially sold out two days after Woods had
won the U.S. Open in June as fans anticipated the chance of his
winning the Grand Slam.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, ticket packages that originally sold for $265 are
selling for half that price.</TE>
<TE>   John Moore, a 24-year-old teacher from Farmington, Minn., said
near the practice tees Tuesday that he'd paid $250 for his ticket
package last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he was disappointed that Woods was not playing for
the Grand Slam, Moore said, "It would have been pretty amazing, but
it didn't curb my enthusiasm."</TE>
<TE>   Really?</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, sure, it's a little disappointing," he said. "I was
definitely pulling for him to win at the British."</TE>
<TE>   Without the specter of the Grand Slam, some fans are hoping
someone else wins.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm one of those people who always roots for the underdog,"
Marilyn Errington, of Maumee, Ohio, said. "I go for someone who's
really struggling."</TE>
<TE>   Errington is pulling this week for Matt Kuchar.</TE>
<TE>   Even Els, the man who foiled Woods' plans by winning the British
Open, said a lot of people are looking for a change in routine.</TE>
<TE>   "I've listened to some comments out there on the golf course, just
from the general public," Els said, "and I feel they would like to
see more players compete against him or actually beat him and win
more tournaments."</TE>
<TE>   Sensing a possible theme, someone at Tuesday's news conference
actually had the audacity to ask Woods whether it might be good for
golf to have someone else win major tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what, dude?" Woods said, "I can't give you that."</TE>
<TE>   Woods, of course, thinks his winning all the time is sensational
for golf. His golf.</TE>
<TE>   Moore, the teacher, said being at Hazeltine was a great way to
spend part of a summer vacation. He's just happy to be here, no
matter what's at stake. He said he would have been tempted to sell
his tickets at a considerable profit had Woods been playing for a
place in history.</TE>
<TE>   "You wouldn't have been able to get within 200 yards of him,"
Moore said. "He would have been impossible to follow."</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, who knows, Moore may now be able to get within 100
yards of Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Grand Slam or no, though, Moore can't wait to get on the Tiger
trail.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, nobody ever got tired of watching Michael Jordan win all the
time," he said.</TE>

<DL>BIG BEAR LAKE</DL>
<LD>Oscar De La Hoya trains here, in a groomed compound surrounded by
deep green grass and a babbling brook.</LD>
<LD>   Fernando Vargas also trains here, in a creaky monolith at the end
of a chipped driveway with a busted fence and yard full of dust.</LD>
<LD>   "He's manicured," Vargas says. "I'm raw."</LD>
<TE>   In front of De La Hoya's guest house stands a golf bag, in
deference to the owner's hobby.</TE>
<TE>   In front of Vargas' house stands an old gasping horse, in
deference to the owner's children.</TE>
<TE>   "I will never play golf," Vargas says. "I can't see myself in
plaid pants."</TE>
<TE>   Inside De La Hoya's compound, pop music oozes from the television
while cool air flows through the rooms.</TE>
<TE>   The inside of Vargas' compound is filled with the thumping of rap
music and the whirring of cheap fans.</TE>
<TE>   "When we get hot in there, we blow on each other," Vargas says.</TE>
<TE>   The line in the battle of Los Angeles is being drawn here, one
month before De La Hoya and Vargas meet Sept.14 in a battle for our
city's unified boxing heart.</TE>
<TE>   The line stretches the curious distance between the two fighters'
training camps, five blocks on the map, five universes in reality.</TE>
<TE>   The line is as clear as De La Hoya's smile when he explains his
younger rival's rage.</TE>
<TE>   "All this talk from Vargas, it's just something for him to hide
behind," he says. "He's never been in a fight this big before. He's
scared."</TE>
<TE>   The line is as solid as Vargas' glare when he jumps in your face
and pulls off his shirt to show that De La Hoya is full of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at this body, look at this!" he cries, flexing his hardened
stomach, grabbing his giant tattooed left biceps. "Does De La Hoya
have something like this? Does he have this?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While jogging through the tall pines of this mountain hideaway,
the two Los Angeles street kids have passed each other twice.</TE>
<TE>   Each time, Vargas has been finishing his jog as De La Hoya was
getting started.</TE>
<TE>   Each time, Vargas has reminded him of the time.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to get up a little earlier!" Vargas has shouted to his
rival.</TE>
<TE>   On the first occasion, De La Hoya held up six fingers, signifying
that he intended to knock out Vargas in the sixth round.</TE>
<TE>   On the second occasion, De La Hoya's trainer Floyd Mayweather
dispensed with the predictions and simply shouted, "Fatso!"</TE>
<TE>   So often these fights are about hype. This one is not. The
loathing and fear are real enough to hear in their voices, to see in
their eyes.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya thinks Vargas is nuts.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas thinks De La Hoya is a phony.</TE>
<TE>   Both men fear for their careers if they attack each other with the
quick ferocity that fills their emotions.</TE>
<TE>   Both men fear for their reputations if they don't.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya seemed to gain the early emotional edge in January,
when Vargas shoved him at the fight's first news conference, starting
a street brawl in the Biltmore's elegant basement, resulting in a
broken leg for one of the publicists.</TE>
<TE>   You see?  The kid can't handle his emotions, and De La Hoya will
obliterate him.</TE>
<TE>   But then, this spring, Vargas seemed to gain the edge when De La
Hoya postponed the fight, originally scheduled for May, because he
said his surgically repaired left wrist had not healed.</TE>
<TE>   You see? De La Hoya doesn't want to fight him because he knows he
can't beat him.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, they have settled into their jogs, and hardened their
stares, and now nobody knows quite what to think.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing certain is that both fighters desperately long for
the giant embrace of their hometown.</TE>
<TE>   And that they know they will never be able to share it, because,
while both are Mexican American, they are as diverse as Los Angeles
itself.</TE>
<TE>   This was evident again Tuesday, when De La Hoya held a gathering
here for several dozen media members, while Vargas agreed to see just
one.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya's visitors were welcomed behind his ornate black gates
by a publicist.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas' visitor was welcomed inside his stark white gate by a
intercom voice barking, "What?"</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya glided into his guest house in a pressed sweat suit and
starched white baseball cap.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas sauntered into his living room in a tank top undershirt and
gym shorts.</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya treated his guests to box lunches while Vargas invited
his guest into his small, cluttered bedroom with a "Scarface" poster
on the wall and diapers on the dresser.</TE>
<TE>   Said De La Hoya: "I don't think this is about good against evil. I
don't think Vargas is an evil guy ... he's just nervous."</TE>
<TE>   Said Vargas: "Let them think I'm crazy. Let them think I'm going
to do something crazy. Maybe I will. Maybe I won't. Let them
think...."</TE>
<TE>   De La Hoya doesn't think Vargas will try anything else before the
fight.</TE>
<TE>   "He's on probation, so I don't think he'll try to mess with me,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas thinks De La Hoya should keep his legal opinions to
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "He wants to bring up stuff from out of the ring?" said Vargas,
who pleaded no contest to an assault charge last year. "Then we can
talk about the accusations of rape, about the accusation of how he
doesn't take care of his kids. That's why he needs to fight me, so he
can pay child support."</TE>
<TE>   Back and forth they go, with De La Hoya playing the part of the
sophisticate and Vargas playing the part of the street kid.</TE>
<TE>   It's compelling theater, only it's not theater, and De La Hoya
gets truly angered when it is suggested that Vargas is more "Mexican"
because of his hardscrabble attitudes.</TE>
<TE>   "What is being Mexican?" De La Hoya asked. "Because I don't talk
like him or dress like him, I'm not Mexican? I grew up on the same
hard streets ... but the fact is, I wanted to do something better in

<HD>O'Neal Surgery Is Likely</HD>
<DH>Lakers: He may undergo procedure on toe within two weeks
and could miss beginning of season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal could have surgery on his arthritic toe sometime in
the next two weeks in Los Angeles, and his recovery could linger into
the early part of the Lakers' regular season, according to sources
close to O'Neal.</LD>
<LD>   A date for the surgery could be set as early as today.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Robert Mohr, chief of podiatric surgery at UCLA Medical
Center, is expected to perform the procedure, called a cheilectomy,
in an effort to relieve the source of the pain in O'Neal's big right
toe last season.</LD>
<TE>   In cases like O'Neal's, bone spurs form on the top of the main
joint in the big toe and can bump together when the toe bends upward,
causing intense pain.</TE>
<TE>   A cheilectomy is a simple procedure in which the surgeon chisels
away the bone spurs on both sides of the joint so that they no longer
bump together.</TE>
<TE>   It usually lasts 20 to 30 minutes and can be performed under
either a local or a general anesthetic in an outpatient operation.
Healing typically requires about three months.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal has been told that he should be able to walk the day of the
procedure, could be running in less than six weeks and playing by
early to mid-November.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers open training camp in El Segundo on Oct. 1 and the
regular season on Oct. 29, when they will celebrate their third
consecutive NBA title before a game against the San Antonio Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   If O'Neal returns on Nov. 15, he will have missed eight games.
O'Neal, most valuable player of the NBA Finals for three consecutive
seasons and regarded as the most dominant player in the league, sat
out 15 games last season; the Lakers won seven of them.</TE>
<TE>   Several months ago, Mohr warned of the uncertainty of surgery and
frequently championed a more conservative course.</TE>
<TE>   "These are conditions where, with all the scans and all the
X-rays, there's really no way to determine exactly what the
conditions of the cartilage is prior to looking at it," he had said,
always adding that the first goal was to avoid surgery.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks since the conclusion of the NBA Finals, O'Neal and
his agent, Perry Rogers, have sought opinions from specialists across
the country; those recommendations ranged from radical surgery
amounting to reconstruction of the toe to a course of rehabilitation
designed to avoid surgery.</TE>
<TE>   While they, like Laker management, had hoped for a clear and
speedy conclusion to their decision to undergo surgery, Rogers and
O'Neal agreed not to rush to a conclusion that might risk O'Neal's
career.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, after reviewing O'Neal's options, Laker officials
believed it was the best course.</TE>
<TE>   As O'Neal's X-rays were sent from one specialist to another,
O'Neal conferred with others who had experienced cheilectomies, and
then he consented to the surgery, finally insisting on it.</TE>
<TE>   When at least one doctor strongly recommended rehabilitation
exercises, more shoe inserts and anti-inflammatory medication, O'Neal
declined.</TE>
<TE>   He told friends that he would not play another season as he did
last, when he was in nearly constant pain, often limped away from
games, and frequently lacked his signature mobility and explosion.</TE>
<TE>   He averaged 27.2 points and 10.7 rebounds, impressive numbers but
below averages for his career, and was less of a defensive force.</TE>
<TE>   Also, O'Neal so feared the long-term effect of his frequent
consumption of anti-inflammatory medication that late in the season
he asked to be tested for kidney damage.</TE>
<TE>   Tests revealed that O'Neal had no irregularities, but he continued
to suffer from frequent nausea and occasional vomiting, side effects
of the medication.</TE>
<TE>   "In the best hands, [cheilectomies are] successful 85% to 90% of
the time," said Dr. Carol Frey of Orthopaedic Hospital in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   About 9% of the time, the patient receives no benefit, and in 1%
of cases it actually gets worse, either from infection or progression
of the arthritis, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I do think he'll get better," Frey said. "The question is,
'How much?' "</TE>
<TE>   It would be O'Neal's second consecutive summer of foot surgery. A
month before last training camp he had surgery to correct a claw toe
deformity in the smallest toe of his left foot.</TE>
<TE>   While he returned in time for the regular season, the toe
frequently bothered him during the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have not acquired the prototype backup center, which
was among their off-season goals. The re-signing of Devean George
proved expensive, leaving the Lakers with only their $1.4 million
salary-cap exception.</TE>
<TE>   Samaki Walker, at 6 feet 9, played most of the minutes at center
behind O'Neal last season, and he has recovered from a bruised knee
that limited his playoff effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Mitch Kupchak could revisit the idea of signing a
veteran front-court player--Charles Oakley, for example--not to
replace O'Neal, but to add early season depth to the likes of Robert
Horry, Slava Medvedenko, Mark Madsen and Walker.</TE>

<KH>JOHN BALZAR</KH>
<HD>You Won't Be Happy to Hear This News About Materialism</HD>
<DH>Think that new boat will brighten your life? Don't bet on
it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Do material possessions really make us happy? Of course. So will more
possessions make us happier still?</LD>
<LD>   Alas, no. In fact, research on the topic tells us what we might
instinctively guess if we dared: Despite our mighty show of "consumer
confidence"--that is, our willingness to purchase more and more
things no matter what--we're not getting any happier as a people.</LD>
<LD>   Considering how hard we're working these days and the storminess
in the economy, it's enough to make you glum, isn't it? At USC,
economist Richard A. Easterlin has pioneered studies on the
relationship between materialism and happiness. Fair warning: His
findings aren't likely to make you very happy. But a man who breaks
from the dreary conventions of everyday economics to even consider
the question of "happiness" in relation to prosperity is someone who
deserves our attention.</LD>
<TE>   Happiness, he's concluded, is not like wisdom. We don't accumulate
it as we go along in life. Neither is happiness like physical
prowess. It doesn't normally deteriorate. In fact, our happiness is
more or less a constant in our lives. What we start with as working
adults is pretty much what we end up with at the finish line.
"Happiness does not change as people progress," Easterlin found.</TE>
<TE>   That is not to say we are all equally happy, of course. On
average, well-to-do people are happier than poorer ones, Easterlin
found. People with more things are generally happier than those with
fewer. We're talking averages here, not specific individuals.</TE>
<TE>   But, it turns out, the basic pattern is set early in life when we
take our places in the economic hierarchy. After that, Easterlin
explained to me, "material aspirations change over the life cycle
roughly in proportion to income." No doubt coaxed along by the
billions spent in advertising with the dubious promise of better
living.</TE>
<TE>   Social psychologists call it a "hedonic treadmill," which means we
never get ahead of our material wants. We don't get happier even as
our wealth increases and our possessions grow. I think this means
that when our closets begin to bulge from too many accumulated
clothes, we end up coveting a larger house, and so on. Basically, we
come back to the old wheeze: The more you have, the more you need,
especially if someone you know already has it.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble is, an array of other studies shows an overall
decrease in the happiness of Americans during the last 30 years.
We're losing ground despite material gains and lengthening life
spans. Surely, some of this can be explained by the ever-accelerating
pace of the hedonic treadmill. We're working 5% longer than we did in
the 1980s, and even more is demanded of us in efficiency, that
grimmest of trends.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, our boundless desire for things smacks headlong
into the fact that we can only work so hard to pay for them. Then we
start depriving ourselves of time at home. Stress creeps up the
backbone. Numbed, we lose our hold on the other things in life that
contribute to happiness. I'll take a wild guess and say we're on the
other side of that point already.</TE>
<TE>   But what's truly surprising is just how little we know about the
power of things to keep us happy, how shallowly we ponder the
fundamentals of what makes our economy go round and round.</TE>
<TE>   Easterlin and a growing number of social scientists have plunged
into the many questions that arise when we try to calibrate the value
of, say, a ski boat relative to the consequences of the second job
necessary to afford it.</TE>
<TE>   The converse is equally tantalizing: Can we gain, really, by
resisting the treadmill? Or is that counter-trend just a fancy?</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, I think it's safe to say that we understand more
about beach erosion or the shape of DNA molecules than the sources of
our own contentment in this age of things. I know hardly anyone, for
instance, who isn't nagged by doubts about materialism. At the same
time, I don't know a single person, me among them, who doesn't desire
something more, something better, something new.</TE>

<HD>Playing Deadly Politics With Family Planning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED SAI</AU>
<BD>Fred Sai is advisor to the president of Ghana on
reproductive health and HIV/AIDS and on the board of directors of
Population Action International.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even from my office in Ghana, it was clear that the recent U.S.
decision to cancel this year's contribution to the United Nations
Population Fund had nothing to do with China's abortion policies and
everything to do with politics.</LD>
<LD>   But that didn't stop my blood from boiling. How could one
man--albeit the U.S. president--so easily wager human lives and human
hopes for short-term political gain? This decision does nothing about
China's population policies. It doesn't help the women of the world
who need access to prenatal care, family planning or other
reproductive health services. This decision doesn't help those most
vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. The only person helped by this decision is
President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   People say the decision was motivated by a desire to placate the
Christian right and those who oppose family planning in the United
States. How can a decision that will leave women and children to die
be called "Christian"? This decision will undermine and erode
established and new reproductive health-care programs in 140
countries, including some of the poorest in the world.</LD>
<TE>   The only possible results are those the Bush administration claims
it wants to prevent: unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions and
increased dangers for mothers and infants. At a time when the world
has finally begun to grasp the devastating scale and pervasiveness of
the AIDS pandemic, this decision could not be more irresponsible.</TE>
<TE>   Today, 40 million people are living with HIV/AIDS; some 14,000
more become infected each day. Ninety-five percent of these people
live in the developing world, and it's precisely in these locations
that the United Nations Population Fund seeks to expand its programs.</TE>
<TE>   As an African living in Ghana, not a day goes by that I can forget
about this disease, the toll it's taking on my people or how it is
ravaging my continent. I am sad for the children of Africa--11
million of whom have been orphaned by AIDS. In high-prevalence
countries in sub-Saharan Africa, at least one-third of all boys now
age 15 will die of AIDS before their 35th birthday. The future of
this continent is dying.</TE>
<TE>   The population fund offers a beacon of hope in this otherwise
gloomy picture. It has strong relationships with governments and
local organizations; the agency is known, respected and trusted by
the people it helps. Its programs are also cost-effective.</TE>
<TE>   In less developed countries, a dollar or two is enough to buy some
medicine, pay for a medical visit or supply contraceptives for three
months or more. Sometimes it's enough to save a life. Of course, the
$34 million being withheld by the United States may seem
insignificant to a nation that spends $100 billion a year on fast
food. Regrettably, the decision also marks another step backward for
the U.S. on international family planning overall.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a decade ago, I chaired the main committee at the
International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo,
where leaders of the world promised to help make universal access to
family planning and other reproductive health services a reality for
all people.</TE>
<TE>   The international community is still little more than halfway
toward the spending goals set for 2000 at that conference. Only four
countries--the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Norway--have met or
achieved their "fair share" of the target funding. The United States
trails by far.</TE>
<TE>   There is word that the U.S. Senate is working on language for next
year's budget that will not only restore funding to the population
fund but increase it to $50 million. This would be the right thing to
do. I hope Congress and the American people will indeed restore
funding and make clear to the president how unacceptable his decision
is.</TE>

<HD>Camps for Citizens: Ashcroft's Hellish Vision</HD>
<DH>Attorney general shows himself as a menace to liberty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley is a professor of constitutional law at
George Washington University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's announced desire for camps for U.S.
citizens he deems to be "enemy combatants" has moved him from merely
being a political embarrassment to being a constitutional menace.</LD>
<LD>   Ashcroft's plan, disclosed last week but little publicized, would
allow him to order the indefinite incarceration of U.S. citizens and
summarily strip them of their constitutional rights and access to the
courts by declaring them enemy combatants.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed camp plan should trigger immediate congressional
hearings and reconsideration of Ashcroft's fitness for this important
office. Whereas Al Qaeda is a threat to the lives of our citizens,
Ashcroft has become a clear and present threat to our liberties.</LD>
<TE>   The camp plan was forged at an optimistic time for Ashcroft's
small inner circle, which has been carefully watching two test cases
to see whether this vision could become a reality. The cases of Jose
Padilla and Yaser Esam Hamdi will determine whether U.S. citizens can
be held without charges and subject to the arbitrary and unchecked
authority of the government.</TE>
<TE>   Hamdi has been held without charge even though the facts of his
case are virtually identical to those in the case of John Walker
Lindh. Both Hamdi and Lindh were captured in Afghanistan as foot
soldiers in Taliban units. Yet Lindh was given a lawyer and a trial,
while Hamdi rots in a floating Navy brig in Norfolk, Va.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the government refused to comply with a federal judge
who ordered that he be given the underlying evidence justifying
Hamdi's treatment. The Justice Department has insisted that the judge
must simply accept its declaration and cannot interfere with the
president's absolute authority in "a time of war."</TE>
<TE>   In Padilla's case, Ashcroft initially claimed that the arrest
stopped a plan to detonate a radioactive bomb in New York or
Washington, D.C. The administration later issued an embarrassing
correction that there was no evidence Padilla was on such a mission.
What is clear is that Padilla is an American citizen and was arrested
in the United States--two facts that should trigger the full
application of constitutional rights.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft hopes to use his self-made "enemy combatant" stamp for
any citizen whom he deems to be part of a wider terrorist conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because of his discredited claims of preventing
radiological terrorism, aides have indicated that a "high-level
committee" will recommend which citizens are to be stripped of their
constitutional rights and sent to Ashcroft's new camps.</TE>
<TE>   Few would have imagined any attorney general seeking to
reestablish such camps for citizens. Of course, Ashcroft is not
considering camps on the order of the internment camps used to
incarcerate Japanese American citizens in World War II. But he can be
credited only with thinking smaller; we have learned from painful
experience that unchecked authority, once tasted, easily becomes
insatiable.</TE>
<TE>   We are only now getting a full vision of Ashcroft's America. Some
of his predecessors dreamed of creating a great society or a nation
unfettered by racism. Ashcroft seems to dream of a country secured
from itself, neatly contained and controlled by his judgment of
loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   For more than 200 years, security and liberty have been viewed as
coexistent values. Ashcroft and his aides appear to view this
relationship as lineal, where security must precede liberty.</TE>
<TE>   Since the nation will never be entirely safe from terrorism,
liberty has become a mere rhetorical justification for increased
security.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft is a catalyst for constitutional devolution, encouraging
citizens to accept autocratic rule as their only way of avoiding
massive terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   His greatest problem has been preserving a level of panic and fear
that would induce a free people to surrender the rights so dearly won
by their ancestors.</TE>
<TE>   In "A Man for All Seasons," Sir Thomas More was confronted by a
young lawyer, Will Roper, who sought his daughter's hand. Roper
proclaimed that he would cut down every law in England to get after
the devil.</TE>
<TE>   More's response seems almost tailored for Ashcroft: "And when the
last law was down and the devil turned round on you, where would you
hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? ... This country's planted
thick with laws from coast to coast ... and if you cut them down--and
you are just the man to do it--do you really think you could stand
upright in the winds that would blow then?"</TE>
<TE>   Every generation has had Ropers and Ashcrofts who view our laws
and traditions as mere obstructions rather than protections in times
of peril. But before we allow Ashcroft to denude our own
constitutional landscape, we must take a stand and have the courage
to say, "Enough."</TE>
<TE>   Every generation has its test of principle in which people of good
faith can no longer remain silent in the face of authoritarian
ambition. If we cannot join together to fight the abomination of
American camps, we have already lost what we are defending.</TE>

<DH>Words matter. Sept. 11 tributes demand a measure of
originality.</DH>

<AU>ERIC WEINBERGER</AU>
<BD>Eric Weinberger teaches expository writing at Harvard
University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Someone should tell New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg that it is
a mistake to read famous speeches from history when called upon to
commemorate contemporary events.</LD>
<LD>   I learned this lesson from my mother on a far more trivial
occasion, when I was 17 and setting out on my valedictory speech to
the class of 1985 at the American School of The Hague. I didn't want
to write a speech; I wanted to "deliver" the one that thrilled me
most, an address brought to my attention by my gifted history
teacher, Jerry DeWitt.</LD>
<LD>   The speech--Pericles' funeral oration to the Athenians as recorded
in Thucydides--seemed to me a better choice than adolescent ramblings
on one chapter closing, another chapter opening, rites of passage,
etc.</LD>
<TE>   My mother reminded me, however, that that was what the occasion
called for: a near-18-year-old sharing his vaguely expressed hopes
and fears with other near-18-year-olds embarking on the same
transition in life. A speech by a dead Greek on sacrifice, valor and
the greatness of Athens would be out of place.</TE>
<TE>   So I relented, giving instead a conventional speech that today I
don't remember, save that it quoted the great German soccer manager,
Helmut Schoen, about facing life with "one eye laughing, the other
eye crying."</TE>
<TE>   Now we as a nation are to observe on Sept. 11 ceremonies at ground
zero in New York, where Bloomberg will recite Franklin D. Roosevelt's
"Four Freedoms," New York Gov. George Pataki will read the Gettysburg
Address and New Jersey Gov. James E. McGreevey will deliver excerpts
from the Declaration of Independence.</TE>
<TE>   As much as they might resonate on the occasion--Roosevelt with his
lines about "freedom from fear," Lincoln on the soil "we cannot
dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow"--these texts were
written for their times.</TE>
<TE>   The events of 9/11 require a similar effort from our politicians,
rhetorically challenged though they may believe themselves to be.
Leadership is in words, not only deeds; our leaders will be failing
us if they cannot summon up even a handful of sentences that have
their own eloquence, even if not quite matching Lincoln's. If
Bloomberg and others speak their hearts and avoid sentimentality,
bombast and bellicosity, they will be remembered generously for their
effort.</TE>
<TE>   That said, the mayor would do well to pick up Thucydides for the
echoes he will find in New York and America today.</TE>
<TE>   Alighting as he will on passages such as "our city is thrown open
to the world," "Athens is the school of Greece" and "in magnifying
the city I have magnified" the dead, Bloomberg can gain inspiration,
much as did Pericles himself, who begins by mentioning his reluctance
to talk at all: "It is difficult to say neither too little nor too
much; and even moderation is apt not to give the impression of
truthfulness."</TE>
<TE>   Pericles feared--possibly with false modesty--that his eloquence
was lacking and that consequently the reputations of the fallen would
be at risk. This is a standard gambit of politicians (at Gettysburg,
Lincoln said that "the world will little note nor long remember what
we say here") but a welcome one, coming as it does from a long
rhetorical tradition in which the great and mighty behold themselves
with humility before the truly awesome.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Sept. 11, that is a fitting fear, but one that must
be overcome.</TE>

<HD>A Void in Fiscal Leadership</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush's televised forum in Waco, Texas, on Tuesday showed
his determination to avoid repeating his father's mistakes--and his
fate. Bush's meeting with everyone from chief executives to plain
folks was a first step toward acknowledging economic woes that his
father, in an earlier presidency, cavalierly dismissed. But it
doesn't take a doctorate in economics to see that far more than words
will be necessary to begin mending the problems.</LD>
<LD>   Even as Bush held his sessions, the stock market plunged 206.5
points. Retail sales increased only slightly in July, and
productivity growth slowed to a 1.1% annual rate in the second
quarter, from a 8.6% pace in the previous quarter. If consumer
spending plummets, the potential exists for a so-called double-dip
recession.</LD>
<LD>   How much blame does Bush deserve? No president can fully control
the economy. Despite the continued weakness in the economy, the
Federal Reserve announced Tuesday it would not drop interest rates,
in that existing rates provide sufficient stimulus--for now. The
Fed's decision offers a reminder of how much economic policy power is
concentrated outside the presidency.</LD>
<TE>   But Bush could at least help restore confidence. Upon entering
office, he tried to pin any potential downturn on Bill Clinton.
Though the Clinton era may not have been a true Golden Age--the
dot-com collapse did not come out of nowhere--it holds important
lessons. Clinton and his Treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, reined in
spending, did not carry out massive tax cuts and, as a result, ran a
budget surplus.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has done the opposite. To be sure, as a wartime leader he has
had to increase spending dramatically for homeland defense and the
military. But he could display a different kind of
leadership--backing away from the fiscally reckless tax cuts that he
wants to make permanent. In total, permanent tax cuts, heavily
weighted to the most affluent, would cost the Treasury about $4
trillion in the decade after 2012. Nothing would do more to show that
Bush is serious about the economy than a return to fiscal discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Bush engaged in grandstanding at the forum, calling
for a permanent repeal of the estate tax and rejecting $5.1 billion
in new spending by Congress. Abolishing the so-called "death tax"
would be extremely costly, benefiting only a relatively small number
of large estates, and withholding $5.1 billion hardly can be compared
with $4 trillion in future tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The don't-worry-be-happy message of the economic meeting is not
enough; Bush's tax cuts send no real message about fiscal
responsibility. The longer the president dithers, the more it costs
consumers and workers.</TE>

<LD>There are 350,000 photos in the inventory built over the decades by
Galen and Barbara Rowell. But mention Galen Rowell and a single shot
comes to mind--of a huge rainbow seeming to cast an ethereal light on
the hilltop Potala Palace, onetime home of the Dalai Lamas in Lhasa,
Tibet.</LD>
<LD>   The Sierra Club's Carl Pope said: "He didn't make you wonder how
he got that shot. He made you wonder, how did he get that rainbow?"
Visitors to the Rowells' gallery in the Eastern Sierra town of
Bishop, Calif., will find an answer of sorts, a tale of persistence
and sweat penned by Rowell and posted near a print of the photo. But
there is no way to explain the spirit that knew such a photo was
possible.</LD>
<LD>   Galen Rowell was one who almost could will that rainbow to be
there just then, just that way, elevating a photo to true art. His
intensity helped him achieve nearly everything he tried, from more
than 100 first ascents in Yosemite Valley and the Sierra Nevada to
tracking the rare Tibetan antelope this summer.</LD>
<TE>   At 61, Rowell still did the marathon in less than three hours and
ran mountain trails with ease. He recalled spotting "an incredible
dark granite spire shaped like the Luxor pyramid" in remote Pakistan
a few years ago. Of course, he had to find a way up.</TE>
<TE>   Always exploring, pushing the edge, but always in control. He
brought those traits, and patience, to his photography of the world's
mountains, wildlife and native peoples, often with his wife, Barbara,
flying the two of them in a private plane. While he shot mountains,
she captured people, most strikingly the peasant faces and families
of Pakistan and Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   They died a few miles from home Sunday when their chartered plane
(she was not flying) crashed short of the Bishop airport on a return
from the Bering Sea. Two others died with them.</TE>
<TE>   Galen had said he wanted to travel less and spend more time at
home. He and Barbara each had a book about to be published. Barbara's
is "Flying South: A Pilot's Inner Journey," from Ten Speed Press.
Galen's is "High and Wild: Essays and Photographs on Wilderness
Adventure," by Spotted Dog Press in Bishop. Publisher Wynne Benti
called it "a labor of love" for Galen Rowell; they had planned to go
over final photo proofs Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Rowells' Mountain Light studio, moved to Bishop from the Bay
Area a year ago, was an instant magnet for visitors to the Eastern
Sierra and a spark to the region's economy. We hope it continues to
be that for years, and that it will stand as a monument to their
spirit and their work in the shadow of their beloved Sierra, the
range of light.</TE>

<LD>For 22 hours last week, 50 doctors, nurses and other medical staffers
performed the intricate, delicate work of separating year-old
Guatemalan twins joined at the head since birth. Did anyone not feel
a wallop of emotion when the UCLA doctors declared the operation a
success? Did anyone not, a moment later, imagine such fine medicine's
staggering financial wallop?</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately for the parents of "Las Maritas," a young and humble
couple from an impoverished village in southern Guatemala, an
organization called Healing the Children paid for the girls' trip to
Los Angeles. The medical personnel involved in the surgery donated
their services, and the Mattel Children's Hospital at UCLA hopes that
private contributions will pay for the estimated $1.5 million in
other costs.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately for other poor children, such generosity is common in
Southern California, where individuals, organizations and medical
institutions do good deeds daily--repairing cleft palates, attaching
artificial limbs--deeds that don't get the publicity of a dramatic
procedure that will allow twins to look into each others' eyes for
the first time.</LD>
<TE>   Consider that Dr. Stuart Siegel, the director of the Childrens
Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases at Childrens Hospital Los
Angeles,  has for two decades done part-time doctoring and
fund-raising for children with cancer. An estimated 25% of the
center's budget comes from charity.</TE>
<TE>   A similar generosity moved Capt. Marc Segal and a group of
firefighters based in South-Central Los Angeles to assist Genesis
Avila, 9, who lost part of her right arm in a meat grinder. Concerned
about her future, Segal contacted Shriners Hospital in Los Angeles,
which agreed to provide Genesis free medical care and a prosthetic
limb as well as counseling and physical therapy until she turns 18.
The Shriners routinely offer that kind of help.</TE>
<TE>   Still, thousands of Southern California children need medical and
dental attention--as do countless others in less fortunate places.
The Guatemalan twins have inspired thousands to open their
checkbooks. The less dramatic good work going on each day could use
support too.</TE>

<LD>What a wonderful idea Byron Slater of the Border Solution Task Force
has (letter, Aug. 9). Let's have the Army protect the United States
from invasion by people entering the country illegally. I have no
problem with any foreign person entering our country legally and
abiding by the rules, such as reporting changes in location, school,
employment. I do not understand, however, why Congress does not
enforce our illegal-entry laws. Isn't that why the Army was organized
in the first place, hundreds of years ago, to protect our homeland?</LD>
<LD>   Let's stop writing new laws that always seem to have loopholes in
them and just start enforcing the laws that have been on the books
for these many years. Put the Army, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard to
work protecting our borders and I think we would all be pleasantly
surprised.</LD>

<LD>John Julis' Aug. 12 letter implies that there is some shame to having
the actions of a police officer formally reviewed after a shooting.
Professionals in most fields have major decisions reviewed in the
normal course of business. An engineer will have her design for a
bridge reviewed before it is built, to ensure that it does not pose a
danger to the public. Because we cannot ask our public safety
officers to submit their decisions to review before the fact, we rely
on post facto  review boards to ensure that their training and
decision-making were effective.</LD>
<LD>   Our police have an awesome responsibility that may require
life-and-death decisions. That the officers involved were found to
have been justified in their actions ("Killing of Abductor Is Ruled
Justified," Aug. 8) is an honor to their professionalism and
training.</LD>

("Wealthy Residents Urge Higher Taxes on Rich," Aug. 8). Why is this
news?</LD>
<LD>   Is there some reason that actor Ed Asner and the rest of the
Hollywood left cannot voluntarily pay high taxes? They could forgo
all of their deductions. If Asner really wants to tax the rich, why
does he not propose a wealth tax--say, 1% of your net worth over $1
million, including your home? That way only "millionaires," by
definition, would be taxed.</LD>

<LD>Re "L.A. District Finds Extra $228 Million on the Books," Aug. 10:
Gee! The Los Angeles Unified School District has found extra money.
Only after putting teachers, support staff, school administrators and
the union through hell. And Joe Zeronian, the chief financial
officer, didn't have any idea why there was such a discrepancy? Why
does this man have this job?</LD>
<LD>   How convenient for the school board and district. Now they have
the whole fiscal year to hide the money. I hope they don't use it to
pay for the balances on their renovation and redecorating costs.</LD>

<TE>   I see the LAUSD circus is back in town. The downtown elephants are
now carrying a newly "found" surplus of $228 million. This annual
circus parade is led by Supt. Roy Romer, who of course says that he
has only been there two years, so he's not really in charge yet.</TE>
<TE>   The clowns are headed by the funny school board President Caprice
Young, who takes such joy in knocking down teachers, counselors,
nurses, clerical, police and custodial staff so that they all fall on
the children. Hilarious! And there, sitting in the stands, is the
all-knowing money manager, the omnipotent Zeronian, who looks down on
all this and says, "Who? Where? What parade? Huh? I don't see any
circus. $228 million? When? Why?" Let the show begin!</TE>

<TE>   Finds? Windfall? Bad accounting? No, it's just the same game the
district has been playing for the 37 years that I've been teaching.
It's business as usual--make cuts, "find" the money and then pretend
that students and employees have gained something. But this time the
incompetence is astounding, even for the LAUSD's leaders. They can't
reverse the class size increases because they have already been done?
Huh? They can't track spending or even--get this--tell how many
employees they have because their computers are old.</TE>
<TE>   My eighth-grade students are much more creative than this with
their why-I-didn't-do-my-homework stories. I'd better send a few of
them downtown to help Romer and Young.</TE>

<LD>Re "The New Import: Teachers," Aug. 10: So there is a "teacher
shortage" in California. That must be why I can't buy myself a
teaching job. I am a fully credentialed teacher who has completed
student teaching in a California middle school and worked in two
districts as a substitute. I have a master's degree and language
capabilities beyond English. Teaching would be my second career,
after more than 25 years as a newspaper and magazine writer and
editor.</LD>
<LD>   I suspect the reasons for my underemployment are rooted in one
simple fact: The district-established pay scales for "highly
qualified" teachers like me are higher than those for unqualified,
sometimes foreign, emergency-waiver recruits.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Neal Gabler has a new patsy for why there is corruption in big
business ("Desperately Seeking Celebrity," Opinion, Aug. 11). In the
good ol' days of the Ivy-educated upper-crusts like the Bushes, these
things never happened, he says; it is only when members of the
money-grubbing, lowly, educated middle-class (like the Greek
immigrant John Rigas of Adelphia) take over the corporate reins that
they succumb to the temptations of wealth and celebrity. What rot!</LD>
<LD>   The collusion between politics and big-business corruption has
been going on for some time--and perpetrated by the likes of
President Bush as well. It is just that their good ol' boy network
has always protected them. How else do you explain Martha Stewart
being investigated for insider trading on a stock she had no direct
relationship with while Dubya gets away with it, pretending that
while he was on the board of Harken Energy Corp. (and on its audit
committee) he did not know?</LD>
<LD>   Sridhar Subramanian</LD>
<TE>   Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why does Gabler choose the word "shenanigans" in his fourth
paragraph to describe the plundering of Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and
Adelphia? I've also seen these legal problems described as "woes."
The world knows what happened--these executives acted deliberately
and ruined the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Words have
power, and choosing to make the deeds sound like a prank (e.g.,
toilet-papering a house) is a breach of the writer's ethical
responsibilities.</TE>

<LD>According to "Natural Hormone May Lead to New Weight-Loss Drugs"
(Aug. 8), "New ways of controlling weight gain are desperately
needed. Some researchers estimate that as much as 60% of the American
population is overweight." Maybe we should just eat less. We would
certainly lose weight, and then perhaps others could eat more. A huge
percentage of the world's population goes to bed hungry each night
(mostly in other countries, but in our own also). And we wonder why
much of the world resents us so much?</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "The Iraq Divide," Opinion, Aug. 11: Jack Germond is a breath of
fresh air! While almost all of the talking-head media are embracing
the Bush administration's war drive on Iraq, Germond arrives with a
little common sense. Certainly, few of us doubt the U.S. military's
ability to defeat and overthrow Saddam Hussein and his troops. What
isn't being discussed, however, is how many millions, if not
billions, of dollars we taxpayers would have to put out to ensure the
stability of the economic and political infrastructure of Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   And ultimately, how would U.S. unilateral action against Hussein
affect our "war on terror" international coalition? We can only hope
that somewhere in this government there lurks a Jack Germond handing
out a little wisdom here and there.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Teigan</LD>
<TE>   Simi Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Germond notes, "Some ... suspect that Bush's determination to oust
the Iraqi leader is driven by a need to atone for his father's
failure to drive on to Baghdad 11 years ago." I don't think atonement
has much to do with it. I attribute Bush's championing of war to a
different motive: Don't get mad, get even. I believe that Bush is
obsessed with Hussein because Bush Sr. was dumped from office while
Hussein continues to be in power and thumbs his nose at Bush Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Parker</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charles Duelfer's premise that the U.S. "can't stand by" and allow
Hussein to assemble a nuclear weapons arsenal is overly simplistic
and arrogant. What right do we have now to abuse Iraq's sovereignty?
Direct military intervention without allied support would further
undermine our position as a responsible world leader. President Bush
is already thought of as a gunslinger.</TE>
<TE>   In this economic climate, the U.S. can no longer afford to finance
the "world policeman" role. Our deteriorating medical care and school
systems need resources. A more responsible strategy would be to deal
with the devil we know, develop new energy sources and reserves to
reduce dependence on the region and let the U.N., imperfect as it is,
wrestle with the problem. If our children and grandchildren must
fight a war, I for one would prefer it not be over oil, power and
political maneuvering. Let's put the people's priorities on top for a
change.</TE>

<HD>Mayor of Arvin Seems to Fend Off Recall Bid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It appeared late Tuesday that Arvin's controversial Mayor Juan
Olivares, whose confrontations with old-line white farm interests has
made him devoted friends and bitter enemies, had survived a recall
election by a narrow margin.</LD>
<LD>   Unofficial returns from the Kern County elections office showed
that 622 voters in the town southeast of Bakersfield wanted to remove
Olivares, while 639 opposed the recall. The separation between yes
and no votes was less than 2%.</LD>
<LD>   Election officials said 181 absentee and other ballots still had
to be counted. Earlier absentee ballots favored Olivares. The count
will not be finished until Friday, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Olivares was elected in 2000 on a reform platform. He said he
wanted to be a voice for a long-suffering Latino community. Although
more than nine in 10 residents are Latino, he said, the city had long
been controlled by a white minority representing commercial farm
interests.</TE>
<TE>   During his term, he has tried to make the Police Department more
community-friendly. Instead of ticketing children who ride bicycles
without helmets, he started giving helmets away free. He also hands
out business cards to motorists who feel that they have been unfairly
ticketed. A chief of police who balked at some of Olivares' policies
was fired.</TE>
<TE>   Olivares' opponent in Tuesday's election, Joet Stoner, said ethnic
hostilities in town were a product of Olivares' imagination. Stoner,
who is half Latina, said ethnic groups had gotten along well for
years before Olivares started stirring up resentments. The Kern
County Grand Jury has been investigating allegations of corruption in
Arvin for months. Three indictments have been issued, one against the
former police chief for using city money to pay off a truck loan.
Another was issued against City Councilman Julio Perez, who is
accused of diverting child care money for his personal use.</TE>
<TE>   The police chief, Rande Eighmy, pleaded guilty and was given
probation. Perez's first trial ended in a hung jury.</TE>

<HD>Donald E. Biederman, 67; Lawyer Provided Face for Skin
Cancer Ad</HD>

<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Donald E. Biederman, a veteran entertainment lawyer and law school
professor who put a face on the dangers of too much exposure to the
sun by appearing in a graphic public service commercial sponsored by
the American Academy of Dermatology, has died. He was 67.</LD>
<LD>   Biederman, founding director of the National Entertainment and
Media Law Institute at Southwestern University School of Law in Los
Angeles, fought a six-year battle with skin cancer, during which
doctors were forced to remove his nose and a cheek. He died Thursday
at St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Before joining the full-time faculty at Southwestern in 2000,
Biederman spent 17 years as executive vice president and general
counsel of Warner/Chappell Music, the world's largest music
publishing company.</LD>
<TE>   As the firm's chief legal officer, he supervised its legal staff
and outside counsel in litigation in the U.S. and abroad. He also
served as liaison with Time Warner's corporate legal staff and worked
with trade groups on legislation to combat piracy in electronic
media.</TE>
<TE>   Biederman wrote what many consider to be the finest case book on
entertainment law, "Law and Business of the Entertainment
Industries," which is in its fifth edition and is used in more than
80 law schools.</TE>
<TE>   But it was his battle with skin cancer and his decision to appear
in 1999 in a national campaign about the dangers of sun exposure that
propelled him into the public spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell Mithun, the Minneapolis-based advertising agency for the
American Academy of Dermatology, told The Times in 1999 that the
commercial had been inspired by a photograph in National Geographic
that showed an Australian man who had lost his nose to cancer.</TE>
<TE>   After sending inquiries to dermatologists, the agency found
Biederman, who had a malignant form of squamous cell cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Biederman, who had undergone a total of 58 surgeries in 5 1/2
years, had his nose and cheek removed in 1996. He wore a prosthetic
nose that hid his missing cheek.</TE>
<TE>   Family members were apprehensive about his appearing in the
commercial.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept saying, 'Is this something you're sure you want to do?' "
Marna, Biederman's wife of 39 years, said Tuesday. "Our friends saw
his face had been completely altered, and he said it was really
important."</TE>
<TE>   "It is a tough choice to do this--make myself available as a
public monster," Biederman told The Times in 1999. "I am hoping more
than anything that people will be sufficiently terrified to ... stay
out of unprotected sun."</TE>
<TE>   The commercial featured home movie clips showing Biederman's son
as a toddler playing on a beach and his now-deceased father,
reclining shirtless on a lounge chair. Those images were juxtaposed
with close-ups of Biederman as he talked about his changed attitude
toward sun exposure.</TE>
<TE>   "All my friends used to say, 'The first time you go to the beach,
get a good burn. You'll tan faster.' ... A tan was considered
healthy," he said in the commercial. "None of us knew the potential
ramifications."</TE>
<TE>   The commercial ended with Biederman turning sideways and removing
the prosthetic device, which exposed the dark cavity where his nose
had been.</TE>
<TE>   The advertising agency said at the time that ABC rejected the spot
as too graphic to broadcast nationally. NBC rejected it because the
American Academy of Dermatology did not meet its guidelines for pro
bono advertising. The ad wasn't submitted to CBS because its
guidelines were similar to NBC's.</TE>
<TE>   However, the commercial was sent to local broadcast stations
around the country and to cable networks. Los Angeles, New York and
Atlanta were among the local markets that aired the spot, though only
briefly.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand it was pulled very quickly because of the graphic
nature of it," Biederman's son, Jeff, a Nashville attorney, said
Tuesday. "The medical community was very unhappy it was pulled
because, to them, it was effective because it was so dramatic."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, according to a spokeswoman for the American Academy
of Dermatology, Donna Stein, Biederman's public service spot "reached
millions of people and we felt he was very courageous in sharing his
important story."</TE>
<TE>   "Because it was so graphic and because it was so controversial in
nature, it also received a lot of editorial play, and there was a
significant debate about how bold the campaign was," Stein said.</TE>
<TE>   Biederman got first-hand proof that the commercial had affected
many who saw it.</TE>
<TE>   "He received countless letters from people who saw that
commercial, and who literally said he saved their lives because they
just put off going [to a doctor] for a little spot on their face and
it turned out to be malignant," said his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Biederman was born Aug. 23, 1934, in New York City. He earned a
bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1955 and graduated from
Harvard Law School in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   He entered entertainment law in New York in 1972, first as general
attorney for CBS Records Group and then as vice president of legal
affairs and administration for ABC Records in L.A. He joined
Warner/Chappell in 1983 after several years as a partner in the Los
Angeles law firm of Mitchell Silberberg &amp; Knupp.</TE>
<TE>   Biederman became an instructor in UCLA's extension program in 1979
and adjunct professor of law at Southwestern in 1983. He later became
director of the National Entertainment and Media Law Institute.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife and son, Biederman is survived by a
daughter, Melissa, an assistant attorney general in Des Moines; and a
grandson.</TE>

<LD>The city of Los Angeles is considering suing owners of several
apartment buildings who want to evict low-income tenants and stop
accepting rent subsidies from the federal government.</LD>
<LD>   The 237 apartments are in South Los Angeles, Sun Valley and
Venice. Affordable-housing advocates say the property owners broke
state and federal laws by not giving tenants proper notice of the
evictions.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday the City Council directed the city attorney to
investigate ways, such as a lawsuit, to prevent the evictions.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>State earthquake safety engineers in a downtown office building
deemed seismically unsafe have demanded that the state agree by
Monday to either fix the building or move them out.</LD>
<LD>   A letter released Tuesday from the engineers' attorney to the
state attorney general's office asked for a timetable.</LD>
<LD>   Both the owner of the building and a spokesman for the state
Department of General Services indicated this week that the building
would be retrofitted, but they gave no timetable for completing the
work.</LD>
<TE>   "The state's intent is to bring this building into compliance,
because our first priority is not only the safety of the tenants but
also the public," said Rob Deignan, a department spokesman. He said
department inspectors were now assessing the problems.</TE>
<TE>   About 300 state employees work in the Washington Building at 311
S. Spring St., which the state leases for $2 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   A structural engineering report issued last month said the
Washington does not meet code requirements and could be severely
damaged in a moderate quake.</TE>

<HD>Rail Line Decision Delayed</HD>
<DH>Transit: Irvine council puts off till Sept. 10 its vote on
a proposal to shorten CenterLine by six miles. OCTA sought time to
resolve concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Irvine City Council on Tuesday postponed a decision on whether to
shorten the CenterLine project by six miles to prevent the proposed
light-rail line from going through neighborhoods strongly opposed to
the project.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Larry Agran, who wanted to reschedule the matter, said city
officials need to discuss the revision with the Orange County
Transportation Authority. The OCTA board of directors has notified
the city that it has serious concerns about the truncated line that
must be resolved before the authority can support it.</LD>
<LD>   Agran and Councilman Mike Ward want to shorten the 18-mile route
and eliminate the need to build an elevated portion of the line
through the Woodbridge, Oak Creek and West Park neighborhoods.
Residents of those communities are planning a ballot initiative
against CenterLine.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of ending the route at the Irvine Transportation Center as
now planned, Agran and Ward say the Irvine Civic Center should be the
terminus. Once the system is built, city officials say, the system
can be extended later to the transportation center via another route.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the OCTA board voted to notify Irvine officials that it
has concerns about the potential for traffic congestion in the civic
center, increased costs for OCTA and the elimination of a key transit
hub as a destination.</TE>
<TE>   If the line must shortened, the Irvine Business Complex or UC
Irvine might be cheaper alternatives to the civic center, OCTA board
members say.</TE>
<TE>   They also cited the potential loss of a rail maintenance yard at
the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. They say the change
would force OCTA to consider building the yard in Santa Ana, where
there is potential opposition to the facility.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine council rescheduled the issue to its Sept. 10 meeting.
If approved, the city would recommend shortening of CenterLine to
OCTA, which would consider adopting the change.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current plan, CenterLine would run from the Irvine
Transportation Center to South Coast Plaza before heading north on
Bristol Street to the Santa Ana Transportation Center.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second time this summer, an Antelope Valley school board has
ignored the advice of its district staff and voted to continue
backing a charter school that may owe the state more than $1 million.</LD>
<LD>   The year-old Desert Sands Charter School operates campuses in
Lancaster and Palmdale. It specializes in home-study programs for
students who have struggled in traditional classrooms. As a charter
school it receives state funds, but it operates on a for-profit
basis.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this summer, a district-commissioned audit found that the
school could not produce documentation to back up its enrollment
figures, said Jane Maxwell, assistant superintendent of the Antelope
Valley Union High School District.</LD>
<TE>   The school says it currently has roughly 1,000 students. The state
uses enrollment numbers to calculate the amount of money it gives to
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Sterling, director of fiscal services for the California
Department of Education, said the school owes a large amount of money
to the state--though she could not say how much--because of
overpayments it has received from the state based on its reported
enrollment figures. The district's audit had suggested that the owed
amount could be more than $1 million. Desert Sands will not receive
any additional payments from the state for the coming school year
until the money is repaid, Sterling said.</TE>
<TE>   Desert Sands officials referred calls to their attorney, who could
not be reached for comment. They have defended the school's
educational record and bookkeeping practices in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the problems with the enrollment figures, the staff of
the Antelope Valley district recommended that the district refuse to
renew Desert Sands' charter. But the board, in a 3-2 vote Monday
night, rejected that suggestion.</TE>
<TE>   District staff members first recommended that the board deny the
charter in June. However, on June 19, the board voted to extend the
charter for five years on a conditional basis.</TE>
<TE>   The board will reconvene Thursday to decide whether to grant final
approval for the charter, Maxwell said.</TE>

<HD>Wife in Simi Beating Called Abused Woman</HD>
<DH>Trial: Defense attorney says her client, accused with her
teenage daughter of attempted murder, was 'terrorized' by her
husband.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The attorney for a Simi Valley mother accused of trying to burn and
beat her husband to death began her case Tuesday by describing Eileen
Childs as an abused woman who lived in fear of her short-tempered
husband.</LD>
<LD>   "You will hear a lot about fear, terror, bravery, looming death
and about abusiveness," attorney Jenny Scovis told a Ventura County
jury during her opening statement. "There was constant fear in that
home."</LD>
<LD>   Eileen Childs, 37, and her daughter, Jennifer Childs, 19, face
charges of attempted murder, arson and use of deadly weapons stemming
from an early morning altercation with Jennifer Child's stepfather,
Larry Childs, on March 25 in the family's Simi Valley home.</LD>
<TE>   Ventura County prosecutors contend the mother and daughter
conspired to kill Larry Childs by setting his bed on fire and then
waiting in the hallway to ambush him with baseball bats.</TE>
<TE>   Their motive, prosecutors say, was to collect on a $1.4-million
life insurance policy. Prosecutors say the women wanted the money to
further Jennifer Childs' career as a pop singer and possibly open a
Jiffy Lube franchise.</TE>
<TE>   But defense lawyers say the two women acted in self-defense when
an abusive Larry Childs flew into a rage after a candle accidentally
sparked a fire in his bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Scovis told the jury her client's testimony will paint
a much different picture than what prosecutors say occurred that
morning.</TE>
<TE>   Scovis presented a computer simulation based on Eileen and
Jennifer Childs' account, in which Larry Childs is shown attacking
his wife moments before his stepdaughter struck him with a bat from
behind. When he turned to grab Jennifer Childs, the simulation shows
Eileen Childs striking him with a glass mug.</TE>
<TE>   "They heard an unearthly, wild scream from the bedroom when Larry
Childs comes out and grabs Eileen and Jennifer Childs by the hair,"
Scovis told jurors. "Jennifer manages to break loose and grabs the
first thing she saw--a baseball bat--and tries to make him stop. You
will hear she had no intention of hurting the man she called 'Dad.' "</TE>
<TE>   Eileen Childs, who suffers from lupus, a chronic inflammatory
disease, also is accused of felony grand theft for allegedly stealing
$132,000 from her husband by forging his signature on an insurance
check.</TE>
<TE>   Scovis told jurors that her client used the money to pay off debts
the family had incurred--including a hair plug procedure for Larry
Childs--and did not tell her husband for fear he would "explode" and
harm her or the children.</TE>
<TE>   "She was terrorized by him," Scovis said.</TE>
<TE>   Scovis' opening statement came after prosecutors wrapped up their
case against the pair with testimony from two of Larry Childs'
co-workers, who said Childs was a decent man who never lost his
temper at work.</TE>
<TE>   "He seemed like a regular guy to me," said James Hlavaty, human
resources director for Larry Childs' employer, Kenwood Americas Corp.
in Long Beach. "He deals with people the way I would like to be dealt
with."</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Childs' attorney, Deputy Public Defender Jean Farley,
delivered her opening statement when the trial began July 23.</TE>
<TE>   Outside court Tuesday, Farley said she hoped the defense can wrap
up its case before the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Farley also said she planned to file a motion today to dismiss the
attempted-murder charge against Jennifer Childs, who performs under
the name Jenni Childs.</TE>
<TE>   Farley said prosecutors have not offered any evidence to show her
client intended to kill Larry Childs. Farley earlier introduced a
statement from a secretly taped conversation between the two women in
which Jennifer Childs says she struck her stepfather with a bat to
"make him stop."</TE>

<DH>Summer workshops help teachers make lessons come alive. And

<DL></DL>
<LD>At the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Carrie Lynne
Strasburger took lessons on how to spit candy into a cup of Jell-O,
inflate a giant trash bag and toss M&amp;M's into ice cream--not the most
challenging of tasks for a 44-year-old sixth-grade science teacher.</LD>
<LD>   But she's convinced that what she has learned will get her
students fired up about science.</LD>
<LD>   "I have students who don't even realize we've been to the moon,"
said Strasburger, who teaches at Williamsburg Middle School in
Arlington, Va. "Kids have MTV, Nintendo and [Sony] Play Stations, but
they're oblivious about science."</LD>
<TE>   Last month, 25 teachers from 16 states and a school in South Korea
participated in a two-week workshop sponsored by NASA, allowing them
to learn about real-world applications of the subjects they teach:
science, mathematics, geography and technology.</TE>
<TE>   They observed research at Caltech's labs, toured the Deep Space
Network tracking station near Barstow, and learned about airplane
propulsion at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air
Force Base.</TE>
<TE>   But they had the most fun doing their own low-tech experiments,
which they planned to take back to their fifth-through eighth-grade
students.</TE>
<TE>   "We enjoyed it so much--we felt like kids ourselves," said
Strasburger, who wore a denim shirt embroidered with her school's
name.</TE>
<TE>   The teachers will return to their classes armed with activities
such as "the incredible edible comet," which uses ice cream and
toppings to teach students the anatomy of a comet.</TE>
<TE>   Jen McSheffrey, 31, who teaches at the Osan American Elementary
School in South Korea, said of the sugary, melting project: "We'll
just have to make sure to give this to them at the end of the day."</TE>
<TE>   The teachers also inflated a giant black plastic tarp using a box
fan and poked holes through it with ball point pens to create a
makeshift planetarium.</TE>
<TE>   The objects, they learned, can serve a useful purpose in the
classroom, not only to teach science but to hone writing skills.
Teachers might first instruct students to draw constellations on
paper, then to write fictional stories about their star patterns, and
to match their sketches with the patterns they see in the
planetarium.</TE>
<TE>   "These are things anyone can do," Strasburger said. "Even for the
teachers who may only have $50 a year to spend."</TE>
<TE>   The annual workshops are co-sponsored by the National Science
Teachers Assn. and take place at 10 NASA centers around the country.
Since they began in 1984, more than 4,750 educators have
participated.</TE>
<TE>   The workshops are divided by grade level: preschool and
kindergarten, elementary, middle and high school. Teachers can
receive graduate or professional development credits for
participating. Travel, housing and meals are provided by NASA.</TE>
<TE>   To apply, teachers must be U.S. citizens and be certified by their
state departments of education. They must also teach full time in
U.S. or U.S.-affiliated schools and have a minimum of three years'
teaching experience. This year, NASA accepted 300 out of 1,200
applicants.</TE>
<TE>   On this particular morning, the 30 teachers attending the workshop
at the NASA educator resource center in Pomona were eager to learn
about Mars.</TE>
<TE>   "Where would you land on Earth that is representative of Earth, if
you were an alien?" Black asked.</TE>
<TE>   "My house!" shouted one teacher from the back of the room.</TE>
<TE>   The teachers laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "Hawaii?" responded Debra Gonchros, a seventh-grade science
teacher from Kapa'a, Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   "But is Hawaii representative of Earth?" Black asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," said Gonchros, "We have rain forests, volcanoes, snow,
desert and water."</TE>
<TE>   Black said teachers might start a discussion like this with
students to introduce a lesson on how NASA astronauts use Mars
exploration rovers to map safe landing spots on the planet's surface.</TE>
<TE>   The teachers also learned ways their students could participate in
NASA space research.</TE>
<TE>   The Mars Student Imaging Project, which is affiliated with NASA
and Arizona State University, allows fifth-through 12-graders to
analyze and map images from the spacecraft Odyssey, which is orbiting
Mars.</TE>
<TE>   Any student group can participate by sending a proposal for a
scientific research question members would like answered about the
planet's surface. A review board selects student teams to travel to
Arizona State in Tempe, Ariz. for training with Odyssey mission
scientists. The school or the students are responsible for room,
board and transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Those who are not selected or who are unable to go can conduct the
experiment over the Internet for free. The Web site address is
msip.asu.edu. Students can ask the Odyssey astronauts to take images
of certain areas and transmit the images to Earth for the students to
map and study.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers applaud the concept.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll see how the scientific method works in real life," said
Dana Glidden, a science teacher at Orangeview Junior High School in
Anaheim. "They'll know that their data matters and will want to do it
right, because their work makes a difference."</TE>
<TE>   "Besides, have you ever met a kid that didn't want to talk to an
astronaut?" asked Mary Kathryn Erdelt, an eighth-grade science
teacher from Palacios, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Erdelt said her experience at the NASA program had reenergized
her. "I was just about at teacher burnout, and this has picked me
up," she said.</TE>
<TE>   On the last day, the teachers packed stacks of books, pamphlets,
posters and computer software that they could use to teach the new
lessons.</TE>
<TE>   "There are more resources out there than we know," Glidden said.
"We sit in our classrooms and think, 'Oh, my God! This is all I have
to use,' looking in old boxes in our classrooms....</TE>
<TE>   "If we participate in these projects, I guarantee you'll hear
'Cool!' all the way down the hall. They'll want to come to science."</TE>

<HD>Jury Finds School District Wasn't to Blame in Death</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Palmdale School District's negligence did not contribute to the
death of a 13-year-old boy during a fistfight on campus in 1999, a
Van Nuys jury found Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The panel of 10 men and two women deliberated less than a day
before reaching the verdict.</LD>
<LD>   Mary Corson had sued the district, alleging that lack of adult
supervision had contributed to the death of her son Stephan from
injuries suffered in the fight.</LD>
<TE>   In an unusual split decision, jurors found that the school
district had been negligent in not better supervising the students at
Juniper Intermediate School as they prepared to leave campus for the
day. Yet the panel determined that the negligence had not contributed
to Stephan's death, and did not award any money to his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Corson's attorney, Melanie E. Lomax, said she would ask
Superior Court Judge Richard A. Adler for a new trial.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses testified that Stephan Corson started the fight with a
14-year-old after the other boy allegedly threw paper at him in
class.</TE>
<TE>   Lomax said their teacher should have noticed the tension between
the boys and accompanied them outside at the end of school, when the
fight occurred. The district said another teacher responded quickly
and tried to end the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Corson hit his chin on the pavement, causing a spinal cord injury,
Lomax said. He died 40 minutes later. Lomax said that, if not granted
a new trial, she will appeal.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>RBC Dain Rauscher Inc. will pay a half-million-dollar penalty to
settle a Securities and Exchange Commission proceeding stemming from
its role in underwriting and advising Orange County municipal
borrowers, the SEC announced late Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The firm, a successor to Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc., didn't
admit or deny allegations that documents prepared by Rauscher for a
dozen Orange County bond offerings failed to disclose their risks.</LD>
<LD>   Documents for offerings in 1994 also neglected to report declining
investment performance, which forced Orange County into bankruptcy
that year, the SEC said.</LD>
<TE>   Rauscher served as underwriter or financial advisor to Anaheim and
Irvine and four county school districts that raised $680 million
through bond offerings, which were invested in pools managed by the
country treasurer. The pools suffered huge losses as interest rates
rose.</TE>
<TE>   "RBC Dain Rauscher is pleased to have this matter resolved. It
relates to events that occurred almost 10 years ago and RBC Dain
Rauscher has implemented many changes in procedures and personnel
since that time," said the firm's attorney, Michael Missal.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to paying a $500,000 fine, the firm agreed to cease
and desist from future violations.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC agreed to dismiss its case against former Rauscher
investment banker Virginia Horler, now retired, and a pending case in
federal court against Rauscher.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC's case against Kenneth Ough, another former Rauscher
investment banker, is continuing. Ough, who drafted offering
documents for 10 bond offerings, initially succeeded in a motion to
dismiss the SEC's case.</TE>
<TE>   The agency appealed the ruling and won a reversal from the 9th
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, sending the case back to U.S. District
Court in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   A trial date has not been set.</TE>

<HD>Police Commission to Review Space Allocation in Crime Lab</HD>
<DH>Public safety: At district attorney's urging, the panel
will assess plans for the facility, including a proposed expansion of
the DNA-testing section.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prompted by an appeal from Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley, the Los Angeles
Police Commission decided Tuesday to jump into the fray over how much
space to devote to analyzing DNA in a new state-of-the-art crime lab.</LD>
<LD>   "The science is here today," Cooley said. "An adequate facility
and the staff to fill it are the missing elements, and are long
overdue."</LD>
<LD>   Commission President Rick Caruso said the panel will review the
plans for the facility and decide "what we are going to do with the
crime lab."</LD>
<TE>   For months, Cooley has publicly urged the LAPD to expand the DNA
testing section of its share of the lab. In June, he proposed changes
to the lab's board of directors, comprised of the region's top police
officials, who rejected his suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   The commission action Tuesday follows revelations that the LAPD
has mistakenly destroyed evidence from 1,000 rape investigations.</TE>
<TE>   One of the obstacles to exploiting advances in the police use of
DNA has been the lack of space and personnel to perform the required
analysis. The LAPD and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department
maintain about 3,700 untested samples of biological evidence from
cases that have gone unsolved, or in which no suspect has been
identified.</TE>
<TE>   On average, each agency receives 60 to 80 new requests for DNA
analysis each month.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed $96-million lab, shared by both departments, will
house separate laboratories for each in the same 213,000-square-foot
building. It is scheduled to open at Cal State L.A. in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Analysis of biological evidence from sexual assaults frequently
allows criminalists to develop a DNA profile of the rapist, which
they can then run through a State Department of Justice database of
244,000 profiles of convicted felons in search of a match.</TE>
<TE>   The new crime lab provides "the opportunity to have no more Night
Stalkers ... no more Hillside Stranglers," Cooley said.</TE>
<TE>   The Night Stalker was Richard Ramirez, who committed serial rapes
and murders in 1985. The Hillside Stranglers were Angelo Buono Jr.
and Kenneth Bianchi, who committed a series of murders in 1978 and
1979.</TE>
<TE>   The "LAPD's projections for staff and space for their DNA section
are grossly inadequate for present and future needs," Cooley told the
commission.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley has argued that the Police Department needs to double the
12,528 square feet of space it plans to devote to DNA analysis. That
would accommodate only 25 DNA criminalists, about 15 less than are
needed, Cooley said.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley supports the sheriff's plan for its lab, which calls for
more than 26,397 square feet for DNA analysis, enough room for 44
criminalists. The LAPD needs as much as the Sheriff's Department
because each agency has similar caseloads, according to Cooley.</TE>
<TE>   Interim LAPD Chief Martin Pomeroy said that he would like to have
as many criminalists as Cooley advocates, and agrees "DNA is at the
forefront of crime fighting."</TE>
<TE>   But he said the LAPD's plans are adequate for the number of
criminalists that the City Council will fund. Those plans provide
enough flexibility for more space later.</TE>
<TE>   "We will find the floor space when we get them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have protested the destruction of evidence in the rape
cases, which LAPD officials said was destroyed largely because
detectives were not aware that the applicable statute of limitations

<HD>10 Hurt as Blast Levels House</HD>
<DH>Torrance: At least 80 other homes are damaged in the
powerful explosion. Officials say some sustain buckled walls or
collapsed roofs.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A house tented for termite fumigation in Torrance blew up about dawn
Tuesday, damaging at least 80 homes and injuring 10 people, none
seriously.</LD>
<LD>   The blast, which leveled the one-story house and scattered debris
over a two-block area, was felt as far away as Manhattan Beach and
the Palos Verdes Peninsula.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators from the Torrance Fire Department and Southern
California Gas Co. sifted through mounds of shattered timbers and
household items but were unable by late Tuesday to identify the cause
of the explosion in the 20900 block of Tom Lee Avenue.</LD>
<TE>   Natalie Reed, 19, said she was sleeping in the back bedroom of her
home just in front of the one that exploded on a quiet cul-de-sac.
She was jolted awake by the shock of the blast and the sound of her
windows shattering and glass flying across the bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I just thought I was having a nightmare, then I thought
we were being attacked by terrorists--I thought somebody was bombing
us," said Reed as she stood with her family on a nearby lawn. Her
foot, which she cut stepping on glass as she rushed out of the house,
was wrapped in a makeshift bandage.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe I'm still alive," said Reed.</TE>
<TE>   The owners of the home that exploded, identified through property
records as Robert T. and Helen Mimura, were out of town while the
place was being fumigated, according to Tad Friedman, a spokesman for
the Torrance Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   Torrance police and about 40 firefighters from the city and
adjoining Redondo Beach responded to the 5:45 a.m. blast. They
evacuated the area surrounding the home and soon determined no one
was missing or trapped in any nearby houses.</TE>
<TE>   At least 60 homes in Redondo Beach were damaged, according to Fire
Chief Pat Aust, while about 20 in Torrance sustained broken windows,
buckled walls or collapsed roofs, Friedman said.</TE>
<TE>   Ten people, including five who were taken to hospitals, were
treated for injuries ranging from cuts and bruises to sprains,
Friedman said. Most were cut by broken glass as they made their way
out of darkened rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very fortunate and very relieved that all we had were 10
minor injuries," Friedman said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Torrance Building and Safety inspectors were evaluating
damaged homes to determine whether they could be safely reoccupied.</TE>
<TE>   The American Red Cross set up an evacuation center at nearby West
High School.</TE>
<TE>   Arson specialists joined the investigation, but officials said
they did not suspect foul play.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, representatives of Southern California Gas said they
found the home's main gas valve left open, raising the possibility
that natural gas had filled the tent-sealed home and may have been
ignited by a pilot light. Later, however, investigators found
another, unauthorized valve that had shut off the gas flow to the
house, making it less likely that a natural gas buildup caused the
explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Fumigators are responsible for shutting off gas mains, according
to utility spokesman Peter Hidalgo.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for El Redondo Termite Control in Gardena said it had
subcontracted the work to Anaheim-based Network Fumigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no information as to the cause," said the attorney, Leo
Grizzaffi. "We're not even sure what work exactly was done out
there."</TE>
<TE>   A woman answering the phone at Network Fumigation said the company
had no comment and hung up.</TE>
<TE>   Many residents of the pleasant neighborhood of winding streets and
well-tended homes said they thought the blast was an earthquake or
perhaps an incident at a refinery a few miles away.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed like an earthquake, but there was no shaking. I didn't
realize how close it was until I went to the window and saw flames
shooting high into the sky just up the street from us," said Gloria
Simonson.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Rumbaugh, who lives half a block away, was just getting out of
bed when her house shook.</TE>
<TE>   "It was terrifying," she said. "At first I saw just a cloud of
smoke, then the flames started."</TE>
<TE>   Rumbaugh's home sustained broken windows and other damage. The
worst damage was in the den, where windows shattered and sprayed a
carpet of glass throughout the room where Rumbaugh likes to have her
morning coffee.</TE>
<TE>   "Just a few more minutes," she said, "and I would have been
sitting in there, right in the middle of it."</TE>

<LD>A single mother supporting three children, Garthea Clayton always
dreamed of becoming an attorney. This fall, she was taking a major
step toward making her dream a reality by completing her second year
at Western State University of Law.</LD>
<LD>   "She just struggled and used that as a steppingstone to put
herself together and motivate herself," said her mother, Judy Carter.
"She saw that there was a bigger world out there for her and that she
could have an impact."</LD>
<LD>   Clayton, 38, was killed Sunday along with another law student,
Karina Davidds, 24, of Whittier when a man suspected of driving while
drunk slammed his van into their vehicle in Cowan Heights.</LD>
<TE>   It was Sunday evening when Jesus Torres, 19, of Santa Ana
allegedly ran a red light on Newport Avenue and broadsided Davidds'
car as she was making a left turn, said California Highway Patrol
Officer William Kwon.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said they saw Torres speed through at least two red
lights before the collision, Kwon said. Torres was charged Tuesday
with gross vehicular manslaughter, driving under the influence and
driving without a license.</TE>
<TE>   Tests of Torres' blood-alcohol level had not been released
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Family members gathered at Clayton's Garden Grove apartment to
mourn her death but also to celebrate her life.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't generate the anger. I just feel so sorry," said Carter,
58, of Las Vegas. "My comfort comes in knowing that she's with Jesus
and that she didn't suffer."</TE>
<TE>   Carter said the road to law school was not easy for her daughter.
Clayton struggled financially as she raised her daughter Dietra, 18,
son Daren, 17, and daughter Daja, 13. Daja has cerebral palsy and
epilepsy.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these hardships, she completed a bachelor's degree in
liberal arts from Arizona State University.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the problems that she had securing services for Daja that
really inspired her toward law school and toward civil liberties,"
Carter said. "She just found herself constantly battling for services
for her children as a single mother."</TE>
<TE>   Family and friends remember Clayton for her desire to help and her
passion for social justice.</TE>
<TE>   "She was the type of person that if there was something wrong, she
would say, 'There is a better way to do this,' " said Clayton's law
school classmate Jeff Johnson, 44, of Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service for Clayton will be held at Western law school
Friday. The school plans to create a scholarship fund in her honor.</TE>

<HD>Finding on Energy Trades Falls Short of Condemnation</HD>
<DH>Utilities: Gov. Davis calls report a whitewash after FERC
fails to find widespread market manipulation. Agency orders new
inquiries into other firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS and DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal regulators accused Enron Corp. and two other energy traders
Tuesday of possible misconduct and concluded that natural gas prices
may been manipulated in the state's energy crisis. But the interim
report stopped short of the condemnation of the traders sought by
state officials.</LD>
<LD>   In a news conference, Gov. Gray Davis called the report by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a whitewash and said the panel
was spineless because it had failed to issue broad sanctions against
generators and power traders. California is seeking refunds of nearly
$9 billion for what it alleges are electricity overcharges in 2000
and 2001.</LD>
<LD>   FERC stressed that the report delivered Tuesday to Congress was
preliminary and that the broad investigation into alleged market
manipulation continues.</LD>
<TE>   The agency ordered new inquiries into three Enron subsidiaries,
including Portland General Electric Co., and two companies with which
Enron did business: Avista Energy of Spokane, Wash., and El Paso
Electric Co., the utility serving El Paso. (El Paso Electric is not
affiliated with the larger El Paso Corp. of Houston.)</TE>
<TE>   The companies said they are cooperating with the FERC
investigation and the forthcoming hearings into their conduct.</TE>
<TE>   For six months, FERC has been examining whether trading by
now-bankrupt Enron Corp. and others caused electricity and natural
gas prices to rise in California and 10 other Western states. Some of
the trading strategies were given colorful nicknames by Enron
traders, such as Death Star and Fat Boy, while others reportedly
involved the phony swapping of electricity or natural gas, known as
"wash trading."</TE>
<TE>   The interim report is the first look at the agency's wide-ranging
investigation, and it found instances of possible
manipulation--notably of the indexes of California natural gas
prices, which could strengthen the state's case for bigger refunds,
some FERC observers said.</TE>
<TE>   But the document contained no evidence of widespread manipulation
of energy prices or illegal actions by market participants.</TE>
<TE>   The report said that some of the Enron-style strategies had
involved market manipulation, but that the ploys had not helped Enron
revenues much or significantly affected the market, which the
document said was hurt more by flawed market rules and shortages of
electricity.</TE>
<TE>   FERC Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell said the report "gets into
fact vs. fantasy."</TE>
<TE>   "I have heard people in California say there was no problem with
[electricity] scarcity and the market design flaws really didn't
explain any of this well. If that's what you want to believe, then
this report is probably not what you want to hear," Brownell said.</TE>
<TE>   She said FERC, through its report and orders, is issuing strong
signals to companies that "there's no place to hide. If you are a
company that engaged in one of these behaviors ... we're going to
find you and deal with you."</TE>
<TE>   The report disappointed some California politicians, who were
hoping for a clear sign that refunds were on the way.</TE>
<TE>   The report comes amid growing tension between FERC and California
officials, who have long contended that the agency was too slow in
offering help during the crisis. Davis and his appointees to the
governing board of the California Independent System Operator, which
oversees most of the state's transmission system, recently defied a
FERC order to dissolve the Cal-ISO board and replace it with an
independent board chosen by committee.</TE>
<TE>   "This report was a whitewash," Davis said. "California's consumers
are at serious risk as long as the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission is in charge."</TE>
<TE>   "The FERC has demonstrated once again how spineless they are,"
Davis said, adding that the state will continue to pursue refunds
through FERC and might consider suing if refunds are not handed out.
"They are not regulating. They have no interest in protecting the
American consumer. Their only interest is in padding the pockets of
the energy companies."</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), who heads a special committee
of the state Legislature that is investigating possible market
manipulation, said: "If prices were charged above just and reasonable
prices due to market manipulation, FERC has always had the ability to
order refunds under those circumstance. The problem is that FERC just
won't do it."</TE>

<HD>Media Draw Ire of Trial Judge</HD>
<DH>Coverage: Jurist in Van Dam case won't relax his courtroom
ban on a San Diego radio producer, and calls two L.A. radio talk show
hosts 'idiots.'</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>As the jury deliberated Tuesday for a fourth day, the judge in the
trial of David Westerfield vented his anger at portions of the media
and labeled as "idiots" a pair of Los Angeles radio talk show hosts.</LD>
<LD>   The pair has been deriding the jury for taking the time it has to
decide Westerfield's fate.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge William Mudd also refused to reverse his
order banning a producer of a San Diego radio talk show from his
courtroom for the remainder of Westerfield's trial on charges of
kidnapping and killing 7-year-old Danielle van Dam.</LD>
<TE>   River Stillwood, a producer for the Rick Roberts show on KFMB-AM
(760), had refused to divulge the source of a story on Roberts'
"Court of Public Opinion." The story focused on an insulting remark
allegedly made by Danielle's father, Damon, to the mother of
Westerfield defense attorney Steven Feldman. Van Dam had been warned
by Mudd not to be disruptive.</TE>
<TE>   According to the KFMB story, van Dam's comment surfaced during a
closed-door session last week attended by Mudd and opposing lawyers.
Journalists had been excluded from the session.</TE>
<TE>   Stillwood's attorney said that her client did not know who had
told the station about Van Dam's alleged comment, and that, even if
she did, she is protected by California's shield law for journalists.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd responded that though his ruling banishing Stillwood might be
overturned by an appeals court, he felt obligated to "protect the
integrity of this proceeding."</TE>
<TE>   Mudd said Stillwood will be barred from court when the verdict is
read, and during the penalty phase if one is required. And he said
she won't be allowed to conduct post-trial interviews with jurors in
the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   The judge has made no secret of his displeasure with Roberts, who
has used his show as a forum for callers to discuss, among other
topics, Mudd's handling of the trial and his decision to halt it for
a week so he could take a vacation.</TE>
<TE>   "[Stillwood] is out and will remain out because she is the
representative of an individual who takes great glee and delight in
shoving it in this court's face in the name of the 1st Amendment,"
Mudd said.</TE>
<TE>   He also criticized KFMB-TV (Channel 8), the CBS affiliate in San
Diego, for running a picture of Westerfield's 18-year-old son, Neal,
who was called as a prosecution witness. Mudd had ruled that the son
could not be photographed while he was testifying and asked the media
not to try to photograph him leaving the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd said KFMB was the only station to use "paparazzi-style
pictures" of the son leaving the courthouse. "They just don't get
it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   KFMB news director Fred D'Ambrosi said the station used a yearbook
photo of Neal Westerfield, not pictures taken as he left the
courthouse. And he said the decision to bar Stillwood is unfair and
unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   "She violated no court order," he said. "If the judge can throw
her out, he can throw out anyone who has done a story he doesn't
like."</TE>
<TE>   Mudd's strongest words were reserved for the afternoon radio team
of John and Ken from KFI-AM (640) in Los Angeles. Broadcasting from
outside the courthouse on Monday, the pair referred to jurors as
"broccoli," their all-purpose put-down, for not having reached a
verdict yet.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday morning, court security personnel refused to let the
KFI van park on a street adjacent to the courthouse that has been
reserved for the media.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had my druthers, idiots from a Los Angeles talk station
would not be outside this courthouse acting like teenagers," Mudd
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Chiampou and John Kobylt said they were surprised at Mudd's
anger, noting that their show was mild compared to what they did
outside the O.J. Simpson trial without arousing the wrath of
authorities in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a control freak," Kobylt said. "It drives him crazy that he
can't control everybody."</TE>
<TE>   "Judge Mudd is acting [like] a sheriff of a small town who just
isn't going to put up with this stuff in his town," Chiampou said.</TE>

<LD>San Bernardino County authorities said Tuesday that they served a
search warrant on an Alta Loma house in connection with the reported
intimidation of a 16-year-old girl allegedly gang-raped in Newport
Beach last month.</LD>
<LD>   According to property records, the house belongs to Gail Haidl,
mother of one of the three boys charged with the crime and ex-wife of
Orange County Assistant Sheriff Donald Haidl.</LD>
<LD>   "The warrant was served yesterday, and I don't know what was
found," said Robin Haynal of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's
Department.</LD>
<TE>   The search warrant was issued, police said, after reports about
three weeks ago that the girl and members of her family were being
followed and photographed. Police added that fliers were posted in
the girl's neighborhood and at local business complexes asking people
to call one of two numbers if they had information on her family or
the rape.</TE>
<TE>   When the numbers were called, police said, a woman on an answering
machine who said she was related to the girl thanked callers and
asked them to leave their names and numbers. Police served a search
warrant on Verizon Communications, which connected the numbers to the
Alta Loma address.</TE>
<TE>   The three teens are accused of drugging and gang-raping the girl
during a July 5 party at the Newport Beach home of Donald Haidl.</TE>

<HD>Ed Headrick; Inventor of Pro Model Frisbee</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ed Headrick, who turned a national fad into an enduring sports trend
by designing the first professional model Frisbee, has died from
complications resulting from two strokes. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Headrick died in his sleep on Monday at his home in Santa Cruz,
family members said. He was left partially paralyzed after suffering
the strokes last month at a Frisbee golf tournament in Miami.</LD>
<LD>   Headrick is credited with patenting the concentric, ridge-like
rings that improved the aerodynamics of the discs first invented by
Fred Morrison and marketed in the mid-1950s by Emeryville,
Calif.-based toy manufacturer Wham-O.</LD>
<TE>   Headrick is also credited with coming up with the idea for disc
golf. He was co-founder of the International Frisbee Assn., the
Professional Disc Golf Assn. and the Recreational Disc Golf Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Frisbees, which took their inspiration from the metal pie pans
thrown by Ivy League students starting in the 1930s, were introduced
to the nation in 1957 as the "Pluto Platter." The name was an effort
to tap into the country's fascination with space and unidentified
flying objects.</TE>
<TE>   When "Steady Ed" Headrick joined Wham-O in the 1960s, he created
the "professional model" Frisbee disc design, which had better lift
and could be thrown far greater distances than its flatter
predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   "When he did that, all of a sudden you had something that could
fly with maximum height and distance," said Peter Sgromo, marketing
director for Wham-0. "And when kids got a hold of that, they had a
great tool for legitimate sports."</TE>
<TE>   As sport combined with fad, the popularity of the Frisbee soared,
and the discs could be spotted aloft in parks, beaches and college
campuses. They also came to embody a freedom from the rigid rules of
traditional American sports such as football.</TE>
<TE>   Frisbees became, as Headrick told The Times in 1985, "the emblem
of the unruly, something for people who were anti-everything to be
pro-something."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the popularity of the Frisbee transcended its
anti-establishment appeal and Wham-O went on to sell more than 100
million of the professional model discs, which were first introduced
in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   Frisbee lovers created games like Ultimate Frisbee, in which teams
faced off against one another with the object of scoring by passing
to a teammate positioned in an end zone.</TE>
<TE>   Headrick invented another popular sport, disc golf, that is played
like regular golf except it uses a disc instead of a golf ball.</TE>
<TE>   The first formal disc golf course was designed by Headrick and
installed in 1975 in Oak Grove Park in La Canada-Flintridge. Headrick
went on to design 200 more.</TE>
<TE>   Born in South Pasadena, Headrick is survived by his wife Farina;
three sons; a daughter; and 11 grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   According to the San Francisco Chronicle, it was Headrick's wish
to have his ashes molded into memorial flying discs that would be
given to select family and friends, and others who made donations to
his memory.</TE>

<HD>Hospital Ordered to Stay Open</HD>
<DH>Health: Judge cites pending trial for owner of the Freeman
facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge Tuesday ordered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital, which had
been slated to close in two weeks, to remain open, pending trial on
charges that its owner had violated commitments made when it bought
the facility.</LD>
<LD>   California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer had requested the order,
arguing that Tenet Healthcare Corp. had not provided sufficient
evidence that it had solicited input from the public, elected
officials and others before deciding to close the Marina del Rey
facility.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet also did not consult the hospital's governing board before
deciding to close the hospital, which it bought in December, said
Wendi Horwitz, deputy attorney general.</LD>
<TE>   Tenet attorney Margie Lewis argued that, since her company
announced the closing in May, employees have left for other jobs and
staffing has dropped to unsafe levels, endangering public safety if
the hospital is kept open.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs compared that argument to the
plea of a man who kills his parents and then begs the court's mercy
because he is an orphan.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it very troublesome, what you are doing," Janavs said. "I
don't have sympathy for you at all."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital must restaff to appropriate levels so it can resume
accepting nonemergency patients, Janavs said. It had been taking only
emergency patients since May 30.</TE>
<TE>   If Janavs finds that Tenet has complied with the conditions of the
purchase, the closing will be allowed to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   "We will comply with the judge's conditions and requirements as
expeditiously as possible," said Tenet's spokesman, David Langness.</TE>
<TE>   "We will not wait for a trial," Langness said.</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of community and labor groups brought the matter to
the attorney general's attention in June.</TE>

<HD>Officers Will Be Tried in Torrance</HD>
<DH>Court: Venue is changed after lawyers challenge two judges.
Jury pool may be more white.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two Inglewood police officers charged in the videotaped beating
of a 16-year-old boy will be tried in Torrance, about nine miles from
the scene of the incident, a Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Although attorneys for neither side objected, the move angered
community activists, who gathered outside the Inglewood courthouse to
protest the transfer.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an outrage," said civil rights lawyer Leo Terrell. "They
have just moved this case to the Simi Valley of the South Bay,"
referring to the city where the four LAPD officers accused of beating
Rodney G. King were tried and acquitted.</LD>
<TE>   Judge Rodney G. Forneret ordered the move after a defense attorney
and a prosecutor each challenged judges assigned to preside over the
court proceedings. The Torrance and Inglewood courthouses are both
part of the Southwest District of the Los Angeles County Superior
Court and draw jurors from a 20-mile radius around each courthouse,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an overlap," said Superior Court spokesman Kyle
Christopherson. The jury pools are "slightly different," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood's population is 46.4% black and 4.1% white, while
Torrance is 52.4% white and 2.1% black, according to the 2000 census.</TE>
<TE>   Joel S. Oiknine, a criminal defense attorney who practices in the
South Bay, said the jury pool for the Torrance courthouse is
traditionally more conservative, white and upper middle class than
the pool for the Inglewood courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, a Torrance jury may be more favorable to police
officers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "As a defense attorney, I'd be very happy about the transfer,"
Oiknine said. "If I were a prosecutor, I would be a bit
disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers did not request that the case be tried in
Torrance, and are still considering whether to seek a change of venue
to move the case out of Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Forneret set Oct. 15 for trial and assigned the case to Judge
Francis Hourigan, a Loyola Law School graduate and former prosecutor.
Defense attorneys had objected to Judge John Meigs in Inglewood, and
prosecutors challenged Andrew Kauffman as the judge in Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   Because Meigs is the only judge who hears felony trials in
Inglewood, the case was sent to Torrance, the other major courthouse
in the district, Christopherson said. The pretrial maneuvering is
typical of criminal cases.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Jeremy J. Morse, who is white, is seen on the videotape
slamming a handcuffed Donovan Jackson, who is black, onto a patrol
car and punching him in the face. Morse was indicted by a grand jury
for assault under the color of authority. Officer Bijan Darvish is
charged with filing a false police report--for writing that his
partner "assisted Jackson to his feet and had him stand facing the
police vehicle."</TE>
<TE>   Morse, 24, and Darvish, 25, have pleaded not guilty and face three
years in state prison if convicted. They are scheduled to return to
the Torrance court Aug. 21.</TE>
<TE>   The Inglewood Police Department has recommended that Morse be
fired and Darvish be suspended for misconduct in the July 6 incident
at an Inglewood gas station. The department has delayed imposing the
discipline as a result of court challenges.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, protesters accused both prosecutors and defense
attorneys of doing a disservice to the community, chanting, "No
justice, no peace! No racist police!"</TE>
<TE>   Speaking over the chants, Morse's attorney, John Barnett, said it
was that type of behavior that could prevent his client from
receiving a fair trial in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   "This is exactly the type of thing which prevents a fair trial,
and what these people are doing is ensuring that a change of venue
must be made," he said over the shouts.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Brower, who represents Darvish, said, "My client is
factually innocent, and I'm satisfied he can get a fair trial
anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   District attorney's office spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said the
office would "vigorously oppose" a change of venue. "We believe this
case should be tried in Los Angeles County."</TE>

<LD>A former employee was convicted Tuesday of killing an Antelope Valley
rancher and the rancher's companion 18 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Josif Jurcoane fled to Mexico the day after Lloyd William Bryden,
67, and Alice B. McCannel, 39, were shot to death July 4, 1984, at
Bryden's Mountain Brook Ranch near Palmdale. He was charged in their
deaths a few days later.</LD>
<LD>   Jurcoane evaded authorities until last year, when he was arrested
in Mexico on drug charges. He was extradited to the United States to
face murder charges.</LD>
<TE>   A San Fernando jury found Jurcoane guilty on two counts of
second-degree murder and of using a firearm and causing great bodily
harm to a person older than 60. The panel took two days to reach its
verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Jurcoane, 52, faces 30 years to life in prison, Deputy Dist. Atty.
Rouman Ebrahim said. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Shari K.
Silver set sentencing for Sept. 20.</TE>
<TE>   During the weeklong trial, Jurcoane testified that he had lied to
Mexican immigration officials when he blamed a killer he called "El
Loco" for the deaths.</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier, an immigration official told jurors that Jurcoane
had said he feared he would be wrongly prosecuted because "El Loco"
had used Jurcoane's shotgun to kill the two victims.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities matched shotgun shells from the crime scene to a
weapon found in a pickup truck parked in front of Jurcoane's trailer,
Ebrahim said.</TE>
<TE>   The defendant's daughter, Josephine Jurcoane, 22, testified that
she recalled having seen her father leave the house moments before
Bryden and McCannel were killed, then hearing gunshots.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, she said, she saw Jurcoane return to the
family's trailer, adjacent to the Bryden ranch, and hastily pack his
clothes before vanishing.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said that Jurcoane had little, if any, contact with
his family during the 17 years he lived in Mexico, many of them with
another woman. They tried to force Susan Jurcoane to testify at her
estranged husband's preliminary hearing last year, but failed.</TE>
<TE>   Jurcoane had worked as a mechanic on the 450-acre Bryden ranch and
had helped manage the property.</TE>

<TE>   A state appellate court ruled that she retained the right to
invoke her marital privilege even though the couple had lived apart
for nearly two decades. Jurcoane had worked as a mechanic on the
450-acre Bryden ranch and had helped manage the property. About
Memorial Day 1984 Bryden fired Jurcoane and ordered him to move off
the property, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said McCannel and Susan
Jurcoane argued over the ownership of some farm animals before
Jurcoane killed her and Bryden. Jurcoane, they said, raced over to
the ranch after his wife told him of her dispute.</TE>

<HD>Junior Lifeguards Put Skills to Test</HD>
<DH>Sports: More than 300 youths from around the county run,
swim and paddle in an annual contest at Castaic Lake.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cool lake water beckoned, but 11-year-old Leah Dunbar had
something more important on her mind than Tuesday's triple-digit
heat.</LD>
<LD>   Watching her teammates with tight-lipped concentration, amid
shouts and cheers, she waited her turn to seize the relay baton. Then
her bare feet flew across the sand and her arms pumped like pistons.
Crossing the finish line first, she traded high-fives and
nonchalantly said she would much rather be learning lifeguard skills
than milling around the mall.</LD>
<LD>   "It's work and it's fun," she said. "It's fun work."</LD>
<TE>   About 310 children ages 9 to 16 were at Castaic Lake on Tuesday to
participate in the annual junior lifeguard competition held by the
Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation Department.</TE>
<TE>   Some said they might want to apply for a lifeguard job one day,
but many were just there for some cool, clean fun.</TE>
<TE>   The competition is the culmination of a four-week lifeguard skills
program. For $180, youths learn calisthenics, kayaking, paddle
boarding and first aid, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
Sessions are held at Castaic Lake in Castaic, Bonelli Regional Park
near San Dimas and Santa Fe Dam near Irwindale.</TE>
<TE>   The program hit all the high points for Christina Zych, 15, of
Lake Elizabeth. "I get to make friends, I get a tan and I lost five
pounds," she said.</TE>
<TE>   During a break from the dozens of running, swimming and paddle
board events, she said she was having such a good time that she
didn't care if she won or lost her races. "Even when I got last
place, I tried my hardest." But, she added with a giggle, "It's
really bad when the 9-year-olds are leaving you in the dust."</TE>
<TE>   Program Director Pete Moore said teaching youngsters lifeguard
skills fosters a healthy attitude toward competition while keeping
them physically fit. It has also saved some lives.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the years, we've had at least three kids in this program
rescue other kids from pools." But mostly, he said, it's four weeks
of fun exercise and motivating competition.</TE>
<TE>   "See that boy over there?" he asked, pointing to a chubby
red-haired kid. "For the first two weeks, he came in last in every
race. Then one of our lifeguards took him aside and said, 'Hey, if
you keep at it, you're going to beat some of these kids at
something.' In the next race he beat five of the others and he was
the happiest kid around."</TE>
<TE>   Parent Vicki Munoz of Canyon Country said the program has been
healthy for her daughter, Sesalee Kennedy, 13.</TE>
<TE>   "She likes the competitive angle," Munoz said. "It makes her
self-esteem much higher, even if she loses, because next time she
wants to try harder."</TE>

<HD>Supervisors Order 100 Juvenile Hall Inmates Moved to Jails</HD>
<DH>Board: Those affected are accused of adult crimes. Report
details lapses at the youth facility where two murderers and a
carjacker escaped.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deciding that security is inadequate at juvenile halls for more than
100 teenagers accused of adult crimes, the Los Angeles County Board
of Supervisors on Tuesday directed their transfer to adult jails.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors acted after learning of security lapses at Central
Juvenile Hall, where three teenagers, including two convicted
murderers, escaped July 31 armed with a gun.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Mike Antonovich proposed sending the additional
juveniles to join 42 minors, most of them accused of violent crimes
such as murder and attempted murder, who are already in county jails.</LD>
<TE>   Officials of the county Probation Department, which runs the
juvenile detention facilities, said Tuesday that they welcome the
move of "unfit minors." Those charged with serious offenses are much
more likely to try to escape because they face lengthy prison
sentences, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our facilities are secure, but they don't match the county
jails," Chief Probation Officer Richard Shumsky told supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Any transfer, most likely to the Lynwood Justice Center, is
contingent on funding and approval by the presiding juvenile judge,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Bob Hoffman, head of the Sheriff's Department custody
operations, which run the massive jail system, said the Lynwood
facility is available. "We've been forced to release inmates on
[lesser] charges because of budget constraints, so we won't be taking
anyone else without compensation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Reviewing the July 31 escape from Central Juvenile Hall in Lincoln
Heights, probation officials found several security shortcomings,
including inadequate use of metal detectors, trees that aid escapees
and a ladder left accessible to those in custody.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time there has been an escape, there have been lapses,"
Shumsky told supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   In the July incident, Jose Argueta, 17, convicted in the
execution-style murder of a gang rival, asked guards to release him
from a locked room in a special housing unit for the most violent
inmates so he could get a drink of water. Once outside he produced a
.45-caliber handgun and forced three guards to release convicted
murderer Marvin Sandoval, 17, and convicted carjacker Fernando
Nupiri, 18.</TE>
<TE>   After locking the guards in a utility room, the three--who
authorities say are all gang members--fled to an outside yard and
used a 5-foot ladder from a utility closet placed on a 3-foot tree
stump to climb to a rooftop. They then scaled a perimeter wall and
descended to the street using bedsheets as ropes. They remain at
large.</TE>
<TE>   The key question, said Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, is "How
did a gun get in there?"</TE>
<TE>   Shumsky said he won't know until one of the escapees is captured.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors also directed probation officials to work to relocate
medical treatment to within juvenile halls. Just days after the three
escaped, 16-year-old Steven Frazier fled from custody while at
County-USC Medical Center for a medical appointment. His guard
violated policy by letting Frazier move out of sight, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Since those escapes, Shumsky said, security has been tightened. No
one in juvenile facilities is allowed to carry a gun. Everyone
entering, including staff members, must pass a metal detector. And
bags are randomly searched.</TE>
<TE>   The report on security quoted staff at Central Juvenile Hall,
which houses about 600 inmates, as describing the metal detector
there as "unreliable." At Sylmar Juvenile Hall, "alarms that sound
are commonly ignored," according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   The report also said probation officials had failed to operate
some closed circuit surveillance cameras, failed to install motion
detectors on rooftops and conducted inadequate searches.</TE>

<HD>Dumped Lawyer Criticizes Johnnie Cochran</HD>
<DH>Fame: As the latest to be replaced by high-profile rival,
Joe Hopkins is publicizing his gripes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN L. MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pasadena attorney Joe C. Hopkins had landed the biggest case of his
20-year legal career, one that would thrust him into the national
spotlight, one with the potential of a huge settlement.</LD>
<LD>   Hopkins was representing 16-year-old Donovan Jackson in the
Inglewood police beating that had been caught on videotape. He had
been on the "Today" show, "Good Morning America" and CNN. He had
enlisted help from John Sweeney, a noted attorney who had mentored
under one of the best: Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. Together, Sweeney and
Hopkins filed a lawsuit in federal court.</LD>
<LD>   But then, just as quickly as they were in, they were out--replaced
by none other than Cochran himself.</LD>
<TE>   Now, a bitter Hopkins is portraying himself as the latest in a
string of small-time lawyers big-footed by Cochran, whose law firm
has expanded nationally in recent years. It is an assertion that
resonates among several other attorneys whose high-profile clients
left them for Cochran.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs can't be blamed for wanting higher-profile lawyers as
their cases turn into social causes and become daily headlines. But
in a climate in which lawyers are reluctant to publicly criticize
colleagues--particularly powerful ones like Cochran--Hopkins has
declared war. He is not only speaking out, but also airing his gripes
in a free, 10,000-circulation weekly newspaper he publishes.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it's sour grapes," said Hopkins, who shares a converted
duplex office with another attorney. "But there is nothing wrong with
complaining about sour grapes. He took a case from me, and that is
what he does. Cases show up on the national radar, and he ends up
with them. No matter who had it in the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   Cochran did not return phone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   But in a July 23 letter to Hopkins, Cochran said that Hopkins had
provided "substandard" service and that Jackson and his father, Coby
Chavis, had "lost all faith and confidence in you." Cochran also
wrote that he had subsequently offered Hopkins a role on the legal
team but that Hopkins refused.</TE>
<TE>   Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law professor at USC, said
Cochran's credentials in a string of police-abuse cases dating to the
1960s make him irresistible to many clients.</TE>
<TE>   "He has credibility with juries.... To the extent that media
matters, he's someone who can get media coverage," Chemerinsky said.
"My sympathies are with the lawyer who lost the case, but you have to
look at it from the client's perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Added John Burris, a civil rights attorney: "It's a very
competitive business. Who do you want to be at bat? Barry Bonds or
the guy on the triple-A farm team?"</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins was retained by Jackson and his father July 8, two days
after the beating, to represent them in a civil suit. A few days
later, the attorney said, he began getting feelers that Cochran was
preparing to step in.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I had just gotten a message from the mob godfather,
tantamount to saying there is too much notoriety and money at stake
for the godfather to miss this case," Hopkins wrote in a July 25
editorial in his Pasadena Journal. "Godfather or not, it was an offer
I could and did refuse."</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, Hopkins said, he received a message that
another attorney, Milton Grimes, best known for representing
police-beating victim Rodney King in his lawsuit against the city of
Los Angeles, was "seeking out" the case.</TE>
<TE>   Grimes sent Hopkins a letter saying he represented the family.
Cochran then moved in, Hopkins wrote. Ultimately, Cochran became
Jackson's lawyer, and Grimes took over representation of the father,
the subject of the police stop that led to the Jackson beating.</TE>
<TE>   "I then realized that I was experiencing the underbelly of the
legal profession, up close and personal," Hopkins wrote. His
editorial included a cartoon depicting Cochran, dollar bills stuffed
in his pockets, with six hands grabbing cases in states across the
country. (That was a reference to the fact that Cochran's
firm--Cochran, Cherry, Givens &amp; Smith, which has more than 100
attorneys--has opened offices in New York, Alabama, Illinois,
Georgia, Tennessee and Washington, D.C.) On the next page, the paper
had an article on "capping," a practice in which an attorney employs
someone to solicit cases.</TE>
<TE>   In Cochran's letter to Hopkins, he wrote, "I never did anything to
solicit or otherwise obtain this case.... I was contacted and
ultimately retained by Mrs. Chavis and Donovan Jackson because the
clients were very unhappy with your representation."</TE>
<TE>   Grimes, who became King's attorney after King grew dissatisfied
with another lawyer, also denied Hopkins' claim. "I don't have to
steal cases. There are plenty of cases out there," he said. "I have
never stolen a case. It is unethical and dishonest to steal cases. I
don't advertise. I don't use cappers. My cases come by word of
mouth."</TE>
<TE>   Chavis said in an interview that he decided to change attorneys
because Hopkins improperly put his son in front of television cameras
shortly after the beating. In response to a question about how he was
feeling, Donovan said he was OK.</TE>
<TE>   "My son made a slight mistake when he said he felt OK," Chavis
said. "The attorney should have been closer to my son to stop him
from saying that. He tried to clean it up, but the harm was already
done." Hopkins declined to respond to Chavis' criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Cochran first became prominent as a plaintiff's attorney with his
representation of a young black man named Leonard Deadwyler, who was
shot to death by police as he tried to rush his pregnant wife to the
hospital in 1966. In the early 1970s, Cochran defended Black Panther
Party leader Geronimo Pratt against murder charges. He then became a
high-ranking county prosecutor. After returning to private practice,
he won a judgment on behalf of Ron Settles, a college football player
who Signal Hill police said hanged himself in a jail cell after being
picked up for speeding.</TE>
<TE>   It was against that backdrop that Cochran became a member of O.J.
Simpson's criminal defense "Dream Team." Later, the attorney was part
of the team of lawyers that won a $3-million settlement in Riverside
for the survivors of Tyisha Miller, a black 19-year-old woman killed
by a white police officer.</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins, described by colleagues as having built a solid practice,
said his sense of betrayal is deeper because of the admiration he had
felt for Cochran. He said he had long believed that Cochran improved
the standing of African American lawyers such as himself. He recalled
giving Cochran a standing ovation when Cochran walked in to address a
gathering of black attorneys. And he said he had defended Cochran
against a public opinion backlash after a jury acquitted Simpson of
murder.</TE>
<TE>   Cochran and his associates have won settlements beyond Los Angeles
in recent years, including $18 million in the police shooting death
of unarmed black motorist LaTanya Haggerty in Chicago in 1999 and
$8.7 million in a suit filed by Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant
tortured with a broken broomstick in a New York police station
bathroom in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Figeroux, an attorney who represented Louima before Louima
replaced him with Cochran's office, criticized Cochran's operation as
a Wal-Mart-style big business whose magnitude makes it difficult for
local minority attorneys to maintain a base. "When he comes into the
community, how many businesses does he destroy?" Figeroux asked.</TE>
<TE>   In another New York police case, Cochran overshadowed the first
attorney hired by the family of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West
African immigrant whose death in a barrage of police gunshots in 1999
raised racial tensions. Lawyer Kyle Watters said he was forced into a
secondary role once Cochran entered the picture. (Ultimately, the
family discharged the entire Cochran team.)</TE>
<TE>   "I think Cochran as an attorney should be free to make as much
money ... as he can," Watters said. "My problem is ... when someone
else is hired and he comes in and pushes them out of the way. I think
that's wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Cochran doesn't always prevail in these matters.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after he agreed to represent Jackson, he took the case of a
32-year-old man who said he had been beaten by the same Inglewood
police officer who beat Jackson. Cochran was hired to replace a young
attorney straight out of law school. But the plaintiff changed
lawyers again, replacing Cochran with Steve Lerman--the lawyer who
was once Rodney King's civil attorney, only to be replaced by Milton
Grimes.</TE>

<HD>Let's Not Make a Spectacle of Rape Victims' Recovery Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last time I wrote about the two Antelope Valley girls who were
abducted and later freed when their captor was shot dead in their
midst, I noted that one of them appeared on TV the next day and spoke
with "an eerie detachment."</LD>
<LD>   That demeanor, or flat affect, is common among rape victims, says
Gail Abarbanel, director of the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center.
She refused to speak specifically about this case, but responded
generally.</LD>
<LD>   "In the immediate aftermath, victims are often in a state of
shock," she said. "You're numb, and it's very hard to foresee all the
implications of having been raped."</LD>
<TE>   That is precisely why neither girl should have been on television,
striking out on what has become a national publicity tour, regardless
of whether they specifically discuss the rape. This week, they're on
the cover of People, and many of my colleagues in this business are
congratulating them for coming forward, as well as suggesting the
media should stop withholding the names of rape victims.</TE>
<TE>   I think the wheels have finally come off the wagon.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision ... to appear on national television last week to
discuss their abduction by a sexual predator who raped them deserves
applause," the New York Times wrote in a daft editorial that never
mentioned the girls are minors.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder, first of all, how many parents on the New York Times
editorial staff would push their children in front of a camera a day
or two after they'd been kidnapped and raped. And did anyone in that
august crew suggest the possibility that becoming a teen celebrity 10
minutes after a kidnap-rape might actually complicate recovery over
the long haul?</TE>
<TE>   If we're changing the rules about protecting minors, where do we
draw the line? Should 8-and 10-year-old rape victims hit the talk
show circuit?</TE>
<TE>   The same editorial noted the "spectacle" of the network battle to
rush the girls onto the air.</TE>
<TE>   Of course there was a spectacle. That's one of the very reasons to
protect minors from the glare. Television doesn't illuminate or
console; it numbs and alienates. It works on society like an
undertow, dragging us, and our standards, down with it.</TE>
<TE>   Among readers who roasted me for my earlier column, there was a
familiar refrain. The girls shouldn't have to feel ashamed about what
happened to them, I was scolded. More power to them for speaking out.
And I should stop blaming the victims, or else rape victims are
always going to cower in the shadows.</TE>
<TE>   Of course they shouldn't be ashamed, and no one but an idiot would
blame the girls for what happened.</TE>
<TE>   But there are two issues here.</TE>
<TE>   First, at 16 and 17, the girls are technically minors. Whether
they want to go public or not, society and the media have an
obligation to err on the side of privacy and protection.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the crime was too fresh. The victims could not possibly
have begun to come to terms with their brutal assault, and national
television is not exactly the ideal place to have your first therapy
session.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that they didn't discuss the rape is irrelevant. The
self-promoting Kern County sheriff already blabbed it to Larry King,
and before further exposing the girls, the media should have stepped
back until we were certain they were in a reasonably healthy state.</TE>
<TE>   Rape is a violent, controlling and brutal crime. The damage is
deep and layered, and it spreads far beyond the physical and into the
emotional and psychological.</TE>
<TE>   "Victims often say a rapist killed a part of them, or I have a
broken soul, or it was like torture," says Abarbanel, who sees 100
new rape victims a month at her agency.</TE>
<TE>   It is such a complete violation, victims often remain silent,
failing to tell loved ones or even report the crime to police. That
is in part because of the stigma associated with rape, and society
has a long way to go in that regard.</TE>
<TE>   But before we start publishing the names of rape victims and
shuttling them between Oprah and Geraldo, we ought to keep a few
things in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "Talking helps, but that means talking to someone in a
professional position, or someone you know and trust, so you get some
relief," says Abarbanel. "Talking to a therapist is different from
talking to a reporter on national television."</TE>
<TE>   Abarbanel said there have been cases where a victim went public
and not only helped herself, but also helped educate the public on
the trauma of rape. But those victims were adults, first of all, and
they didn't speak out until months, or in some cases, years, after
the assault.</TE>
<TE>   "All the literature on trauma victims, including rape victims,
indicates it's critical in the immediate aftermath to provide privacy
and safety, and to help the victims regain some sense of control.
It's so illogical to think that compelling victims to be publicly
identified in the press is going to erase the shame and stigma, or
comfort victims."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it could render more victims silent.</TE>
<TE>   Eighty percent of all rapes, by the way, are acquaintance rapes,
not the sensational kinds of crimes the media get worked up about. I
asked Abarbanel to again describe the demeanor of victims when they
first walk in the door at her clinic.</TE>
<TE>   "Technically, what we see is something called psychic numbing.
They look stunned, dazed, numb, and they can sound almost as if
they're speaking about the crime as if it happened to someone else."</TE>
<TE>   That's the teen I saw on TV, a day after she was raped.</TE>
<TE>   My heart goes out to her.</TE>

<HD>Orange County Renews Its Ties to Merrill Lynch</HD>
<DH>Finance: Supervisors OK guidelines for doing business again
with the brokerage they blamed for the 1994 bankruptcy. Dealings are
to be public, approved in advance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday adopted a policy under which
Orange County would again do business with Merrill Lynch, the Wall
Street brokerage firm it accused of causing the 1994 bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   The action represents a milestone for Orange County, which
collected $420 million from Merrill Lynch to end a bankruptcy-related
suit, and came after an emotional debate about whether the firm could
be trusted.</LD>
<LD>   "When I think of the bankruptcy, I think of Merrill Lynch," said
Supervisor Jim Silva. "As a supervisor, I really don't want anything
to do with Merrill Lynch."</LD>
<TE>   In the end, the board unanimously approved a policy that requires
any Merrill Lynch business--including the buying and selling of
securities--to be made public and approved in advance by supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   The Wall Street giant has been trying for months to renew business
ties with the county. Treasurer-Tax Collector John M.W. Moorlach, who
gained fame for predicting the county's bankruptcy, has been a
prominent supporter of restoring ties.</TE>
<TE>   Moorlach said the county could save $800,000 a year by using
Merrill Lynch, which is offering lower rates than other brokerage
firms.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County lost $1.7 billion in the financial collapse. County
officials blamed the bankruptcy on risky investments Merrill Lynch
sold to then-Treasurer Robert L. Citron. The county is still burdened
with a hefty $900-million bankruptcy debt.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Merrill Lynch agreed to pay $420 million to settle a
civil lawsuit alleging that the company encouraged the county to make
exotic investments that violated state law.</TE>
<TE>   The firm also paid a $30-million fine levied by the Orange County
district attorney's office to resolve a criminal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Moorlach said in a prepared statement that the settlements ended
an "adversarial relationship" and suggested that the county and the
firm might be able to have "constructive relationships" in the
future.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's vote prompted Merrill Lynch officials to say they are
eager to renew ties with the county. "We think we can benefit the
county by increasing the amount of business through competition,"
said Bill Halldin, a Merrill Lynch spokesman. "We have attempted to
set a new standard for research integrity on Wall Street."</TE>
<TE>   But some officials remain skeptical. Board Chairwoman Cynthia P.
Coad said Merrill Lynch still has a long way to go to restore Orange
County's confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who proposed the rules adopted Tuesday,
pointed out that Merrill Lynch has been accused of misleading
investors in the Enron scandal.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the brokerage firm agreed to pay $100 million and change
some of its research policies to settle charges by the New York
attorney general that Merrill Lynch analysts gave investors bad
advice. The firm denies any wrongdoing in the Enron case.</TE>
<TE>   Moorlach said any dealings with Merrill Lynch will be public. "I
would not use them without contacting you personally and being
assured of your comfort level," he told supervisors in a letter.</TE>
<TE>   Brett Barbre, a spokesman for Moorlach, said Merrill Lynch will
never have the influence over county finances that it did in the
years before the bankruptcy when Citron was in charge: "All John
[Moorlach] wants is the ability to shop at that store, not having
Merrill Lynch serve as a personal shopper, which they did under
Citron."</TE>

investment policy Tuesday to read:</TE>

<HD>Educator Pleads Not Guilty in Sex Case</HD>
<DH>Court: Charges against former principal involve two L.A.
County girls. He's also accused in a Thousand Oaks case.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Westlake Village middle school principal pleaded not guilty
Tuesday to eight felony counts of lewd conduct with a child,
involving two Los Angeles County girls he allegedly molested.</LD>
<LD>   Jonathan Andreas, 36, was denied a reduction of his $1-million
bail by a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, defense attorney
Robert Schwartz said.</LD>
<LD>   Andreas, recently fired from his post at Oaks Christian High
School, also faces charges in Ventura County involving an alleged
molestation this summer of a 13-year-old female student at Oaks
Christian.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office refused to say
whether the two girls Andreas is accused of molesting in 2000 and
2001 were students at Calvary Christian School in Pacific Palisades,
where Andreas worked as a third-grade teacher from 1996 to 1998.</TE>
<TE>   His next court appearance in Los Angeles was set for Sept. 4.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, Andreas faces 15 counts of lewd conduct with a
minor stemming from acts that allegedly occurred in late June and
early July with a Thousand Oaks girl whose family he had befriended.</TE>
<TE>   He is scheduled to be arraigned on those charges and one
misdemeanor count of possessing child pornography on Aug. 22.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, he could receive 52 years to life in prison in
Ventura County and 15 years to life in prison in L.A. County,
spokesmen for the prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Andreas wrote love letters to the Thousand Oaks girl and told her
parents he wanted to marry the girl, according to information secured
through a search warrant issued by the Ventura County Sheriff's
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators confiscated love letters, computer equipment and a
Bible from Andreas' Thousand Oaks apartment, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Andreas began tutoring the girl in May and developed a friendship
with her family. Authorities said the molestations occurred while
Andreas was on a trip with the girl and her family, at the girl's
home, and at his apartment.</TE>
<TE>   After learning of the alleged molestations, the girl's father
confronted Andreas, who said he loved the teenager and wanted to
marry her, according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Andreas was fired by Oaks Christian after his arrest July 20. He
began working as the middle school principal in fall 2000, when the
independent parochial school opened.</TE>
<TE>   Andreas is scheduled to appear Friday in Ventura County Superior
Court for a bail-review hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Douglas Ridley has asked Judge Kevin J. McGee
to increase bail from $250,000 to $1 million.  Andreas' case is the
latest among recent sexual allegations by students against Ventura
County educators.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo High School science teacher Chad Wenzlick Pridgen, 30,
was charged earlier this year with 33 felony and misdemeanor counts
of child molestation for allegedly trying to have sex with 11 teenage
boys. Pridgen has been on unpaid leave since his Feb. 5 arrest and is
free on $500,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Paul Fonseca, 23, a former volunteer wrestling coach at
Moorpark High School, pleaded guilty in July to having sex with a
14-year-old female student. He remains in jail pending a sentencing
hearing Friday.</TE>
<TE>   And former Newbury Park High School coach Jeffrey S. Magruder
pleaded not guilty in March to five charges-- involving three girls
at Thousand Oaks High.</TE>
<TE>   He is free on $100,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in court
Sept. 16 for a preliminary hearing.</TE>

<HD>MTA Launches Prepaid Monthly Ride Passes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced Tuesday the
launch of a new prepaid pass that planners hope will usher in more
efficient travel on buses and trains countywide. The MTA's Regional
EZPass will go on sale Aug. 25, available at MTA transit centers,
officials at the agency said.</LD>
<LD>   The monthly pass, aimed at simplifying commutes by allowing
unlimited travel through most of the county's bus and train system
for a $58 base fare, is a predecessor to a computer chip-embedded
card that the MTA plans to start selling in the next three years.</LD>
<LD>   "If you frequently travel long distances and end up using multiple
bus agencies, this pass is going to make life a lot easier," said Ed
Scannel, an MTA spokesman. "You won't have to worry about paying
extra cash for transfers or having to buy new tickets all the time."</LD>
<TE>   The foundation of the county's transit network is made up of the
MTA's three rail lines and its fleet of about 2,200 buses. Augmenting
the MTA are about a dozen transit companies, among them Long Beach
Transit and Santa Monica Big Blue Bus. The multitude of agencies can
make commuting cumbersome, particularly for people traveling long
distances, because many of the agencies do not accept bus transfers
and tokens of competitors.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA and its partners in the plan, 11 of the largest Los
Angeles County transit companies, provide about 500 million bus and
rail trips per year, according to Scannel.</TE>
<TE>   The pass is the first step in an MTA plan to develop a pass
allowing riders to use the entire countywide transit network,
including the Metrolink rail system and taxi service for the
disabled. That pass, which the MTA is developing under an $84-million
contract, will be embedded with a computer chip. Riders will pay
their fare by swiping the card near a sensor as they board. Planners
hope the new chip will speed boardings and allow them to improve
tracking of ridership trends.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The police log of the Dana Point News listed a call from a motorist
who "reported a huge thing in the left lane on Camino Del Avion." The
log entry added: "The informant could not be more specific." No need
to be more specific. That's the best description I've heard yet of an
SUV.</LD>
<LD>   Disturbing road sights (cont.): Near the Mar Vista Recreation
Center, Ira Bibbero of L.A. spotted a pedestrian signal that made him
wonder if "the city is encouraging break-dancing as a form of
recreation" (see photo).</LD>
<LD>   In comedy, nothing succeeds like secession: Ex-Valleyite David
Alan Miller flew in from Albany for a stint as guest conductor of the
L.A. Philharmonic and drew some laughs at the Hollywood Bowl when he
asked if the Valley was still part of L.A.</LD>
<TE>   But the biggest laugh, says Valley historian Kevin Roderick
(americassuburb.com), came when singer Audra McDonald told the crowd
her hometown is Fresno and asked if it was still part of L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Let's get back to the first question: Colleague Cary Schneider
noticed that Entertainment Weekly recently wrote about two pop stars
who bought a home in the San Fernando Valley, which was described as
"just outside of Los Angeles." And closer to Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. dues for Angelenos? Forget about trivia like Valley
secession.</TE>
<TE>   Myra Hillburg of Long Beach came upon a legal form indicating that
Los Angeles has transcended mere cityhood (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Slow-food eateries: In his entertaining memoir, "Paris to the
Moon," author Adam Gopnik wrote of the outrage of locals when a
landmark restaurant in the French capital changed hands and announced
that diners would be limited to 70 minutes at a table.</TE>
<TE>   The locals charged that the time limit "was--well, there was no
other word for it--so American." One Parisian related the shocking
story of how "he had eaten once in Santa Monica, and the young woman
slapped the bill on the table after an hour and a half."</TE>
<TE>   Gopnik "could only imagine the waitress, on the way to her tai chi
or acting class, dying on the vine while a couple of Frenchmen sat
polishing off a bottle and solving the world's problems." Maybe she
had to drive all the way back to the Valley, too.</TE>
<TE>   Eat your heart out, Paris: It's not like we're primitives here
when it comes to cuisine. Denis Kurutz, for example, noticed a real
estate listing for a house where people can actually dine indoors
(see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   It's enough to drive you crazy: At my son's baseball camp, I
couldn't help but notice one spectator, a chatty little girl who was
holding her hand to her ear, mimicking a cell-phone user.</TE>
<TE>   No, she didn't have her other hand on an imaginary steering wheel.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: I'm informed that a 3 1/2 day "animal communication
workshop" will be dished out in Silver Lake next week. It's billed as
a real opportunity for you and your pets to understand each other
better. Not to brag, but my cat Tiger and I already communicate
brilliantly. When Tiger sneaks into the house, I tell her to get out.
And she always obeys--when I follow up my order by stomping my foot
on the floor a dozen times or so.</TE>

<HD>Land Trust Formed to Build and Run Parks</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Coalition will focus on L.A.'s poorest areas.
Combined public and private financing could be tapped, organizers
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing statistics that Los Angeles ranks last among major cities in
per capita open space, a coalition of private and public
organizations announced plans Tuesday to form a nonprofit urban land
trust to develop and manage neighborhood parks.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody in L.A. deserves to have a park within walking
distance," said Councilman Eric Garcetti, who co-chaired the Urban
Land Trust Task Force with Councilman Ed Reyes. "What this trust
would do is to democratize the parks in our city, and invite
community groups into the design, maintenance and construction of
parks. We are turning the smallest lots into jewels in the center of
the city."</LD>
<LD>   "We are talking about bringing together private, public and
government entities to explore how we can be creative about our land
use," said Jerilyn Lopez Mendoza, of Environmental Defense.</LD>
<TE>   The group released a report Tuesday, "Walking to the Park,"
outlining how an urban land trust might be formed to serve the city.</TE>
<TE>   If the organizers behind the new land trust get their way, the
"emerald necklace" of small city parks proposed for Los Angeles by
the sons of famed 19th century urban planner Frederick Law Olmsted
may finally be realized in Los Angeles' urban core.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the land trust's focus will be on the city's poorest
areas. The National Recreation and Parks Assn. recommends that a city
offer 10 acres of park space per 1,000 residents. According to
Environmental Defense, the five poorest of Los Angeles' City Council
districts have just 0.455 acres of park space per 1,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   Creating neighborhood-based parks and gardens is a primary
recommendation for the new land trust, said Misty Sanford, author of
the Environmental Defense report. "We are trying to hand over the
control to the community groups and organizations on the ground who
are in the community on a daily basis."</TE>
<TE>   According to Environmental Defense, a number of methods will be
used for land acquisition--including conservation easements,
full-market purchases and arrangements in which landowners might
donate unsalable property to the land trust. Chicago, Boston,
Philadelphia and New York all have similar land trusts.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza said she expects that funding for the land trust will come
from a combination of private and public funding. The Ford Foundation
financed the initial study, and Garcetti has directed the city's
chief legislative officer to explore ways to supply some of the land
trust's start-up costs.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the nonprofit urban land trust received Mayor James K.
Hahn's endorsement during a morning ceremony at the Rosewood
Community Garden in Hollywood, and later in the day, two key City
Council committees asked the city attorney and the Planning
Department to begin assembling a list of surplus properties that
might be turned over to the trust. A goal was set, Garcetti said, to
create five pocket parks in the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Sanford, who has been working since the task force first met in
April, welcomes the strong support the plan has received from city
government--especially because it seems to go against the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a top-down model of agencies making decisions
about land" in Los Angeles, she said. This new model, she said, "is
something outside the way the city usually does things."</TE>
<TE>   The complete text of "Walking to the Park" is available on the
Environmental Defense Web site, www.environmentaldefense.org.</TE>

<HD>A House Divided Stands in Cypress</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At Monday night's Cypress City Council meeting, longtime resident
Mary Crowder stepped to the microphone. She wanted to make clear what
she thought of the Cottonwood Christian Center's plan to build a
mega-church on land it owns instead of letting the city develop it as
a site for a Costco store.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't care where they go," Crowder said of the church and
congregants, "but get the hell out of Cypress!"</LD>
<LD>   Six speakers later, another longtime resident in the audience
approached the council. Siding with Cottonwood, he said, "When you
buy something, you ought to be able to build on it."</LD>
<TE>   The speaker was Al Crowder, Mary's husband of nearly 49 years.</TE>
<TE>   And you thought the Cottonwood issue hadn't divided the city?</TE>
<TE>   Depending on which side you're on, the church is either selfishly
denying Cypress a chance to generate tax revenue at a prime location,
or the city is being heavy-handed in trying to thwart the church's
plans to expand.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, I tried mediation with the Crowders.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know she was going to speak," Mr. Crowder, 73, says. "I
asked her, 'What are you going to get up and speak about?' She said,
'None of your business.' "</TE>
<TE>   I ask Mary Crowder, 68, why she can't change her husband's mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I've tried," she says, "but this has been one of our biggest
issues that we've never seen eye-to-eye on. I've tried to show him
where the church is wrong, but he just thinks the city is trying to
overstep its bounds. He never did stand up and fight for the city
like I did."</TE>
<TE>   I ask Mr. Crowder why he can't change his wife's mind.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd really have to live with her for 49 years," he says, wryly.
"She's too hard-headed, and she probably has the same opinion of me."</TE>
<TE>   To Mr. Crowder, the church's ownership of the land at Katella
Avenue and Walker Street entitles it to do what it wants. "I'm
against eminent domain, period," he says. "I believe the church has a
right to build wherever it wants and have their congregation. This is
an established church that needs to expand."</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Crowder bridles at that. "I think the church is trying to
overrun the city. They're trying to be the boss instead of the people
who live in Cypress. I'm not for eminent domain, but I am against the
church and the way they are going at things. I think the city has
been more than fair [in its monetary offer for the land], and the
church ought to be thankful I'm not on the council, because it would
have heard words it didn't want to hear."</TE>
<TE>   Such as?</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be calling them hypocrites, because nobody who's a true
Christian would do the things they're doing." She's miffed that some
Cottonwood supporters have, in her opinion, sullied Cypress'
reputation by suggesting the city is anti-church.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of just keeping this local, in Cypress, they went all
over the U.S., to Oral Roberts and those kind of ministers ... and
then people overseas got hold of the message that Cypress is not
friendly and we don't want a church here. That bothers me as a
longtime resident, because we've never had that name."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Crowder shrugs that off. "I think the city has gotten more or
less a black eye. But no, I don't think the church has done it. The
city has done it to themselves. They're the ones who dragged the
whole thing out. If they'd gone ahead and let them build the church,
this never would have come up."</TE>

<HD>Bill on Seismic Risk Disclosure Nears Passage</HD>
<DH>Land: Disagreeing with hazard maps, Laguna Niguel pushed a
plan to inform buyers of mitigation. Realtors back it, but state
officials find faults.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All it took was one map released by the state in December to send
scores of Laguna Niguel residents into a panic about the resale value
of their homes.</LD>
<LD>   The map declared that half the city is a seismic hazard zone where
thousands of houses are at risk of being swept away in landslides or
sinking into the ground in a major earthquake--something the owners
would have to disclose upon selling their houses.</LD>
<LD>   It's a situation that's playing out in cities all over Southern
California as the state releases seismic hazard maps that show vast
areas where such dangers may exist.</LD>
<TE>   But Laguna Niguel officials argue that the maps are misleading
since many of the hazards are based on records and aerial photos that
are decades old. Hilltop grading, soil movement and the addition of
structures that protect homes against the seismic shifts are not
reflected in the maps, they say.</TE>
<TE>   The city took their case to state lawmakers, who are now poised to
pass a bill that would inform home buyers about how the risks have
been dealt with and direct them to several places where they can
learn about the potential dangers beneath properties.</TE>
<TE>   The state Board of Realtors has thrown its considerable weight
behind the bill, SB 1500.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal seems simple enough. Yet mitigation often fails and
critics of the bill say some of the places it would direct people to
go to research property are likely to give them wrong information.</TE>
<TE>   They say that the bill takes a disclosure process that is already
filled with flaws and makes it even worse, heightening the risks for
home buyers.</TE>
<TE>   "All this bill does is muddy the waters," said Sen. Sheila Kuehl
(D-Santa Monica). "I don't know what Laguna Niguel thinks they will
gain from this, except perhaps the ability to say everything is
fine."</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Conservation has lobbied against the bill,
and even shared photographs with state lawmakers of an area of Laguna
Niguel that collapsed in a landslide years after mitigation efforts.
They say the proposed disclosure changes direct home buyers to review
complex state guidelines that have nothing to do with their
particular development.</TE>
<TE>   "The proposed changes in this bill are ... likely to create an
unfortunate impression in the minds of home buyers," wrote department
director Darryl Young in a letter to state lawmakers, adding that the
changes would "actually direct the home buyer further from the best
source of information" available about risks on a property.
Department officials say the only reliable source of information is a
city planning office.</TE>
<TE>   Others warn that even the local planning office is unreliable and
say a complete overhaul of the seismic mapping program is needed to
effectively warn home buyers of the risks they face.</TE>
<TE>   Former State Geologist Jim Slosson says the mitigation records at
city offices are of dubious value because the program relies on
consultants hired by developers to certify that work has been done
properly. Builders are free to disregard the opinions of experts they
hire until they hear one they like, Slosson said.</TE>
<TE>   "The loophole is big enough for an elephant to walk through," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from Laguna Niguel defend their proposal as a way of
giving home buyers as much information as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want buyers to categorically dismiss a property because
it is in a landslide area when the reality is the landslide danger
has long since been removed," said Bob Lenard, the city's community
development director.</TE>
<TE>   The city had initially lobbied the state to remove from seismic
maps those areas where mitigation efforts are in place. Lenard and
others presented state officials with detailed data showing what they
said was successful mitigation in areas the state warned were at
risk.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of areas are mapped as seismic hazards that shouldn't be,"
Lenard said.</TE>
<TE>   The city's proposal to change the maps was met with fierce
opposition from Department of Conservation officials, who presented
pictures of the landslide in Laguna Niguel to show that the process
of removing seismic risks is far from fail-safe.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was stripped of language calling for the maps to be
changed, but opponents worry that passage in its current form will
only give momentum to the push for those changes later.</TE>
<TE>   "Proponents of this bill seem to be worried that people will be
panicked about where the house they are buying is located," Kuehl
said. "If people are getting panicked, that may be because they are
getting real information for the first time about where the house is
located. The panic can be appropriate."</TE>

<HD>Surgical Strike Sought Against Pesky Raccoons</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: A Berkeley councilwoman has proposed sterilizing
the mischievous creatures. Animal experts say that it's a poor
solution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frustrated residents of woodsy Berkeley are at wits' end over a
raccoon invasion. They've tried scaring them. They've tried catching
them. And now they want to make it really personal--they want to
neuter them.</LD>
<LD>   In what officials say could be the first ordinance of its kind in
the nation, a Berkeley city councilwoman wants captured raccoons to
be sterilized before being let back into the community. "They've
become a real nuisance," said the councilwoman, Linda Maio, who plans
to introduce the ordinance next month. "But state fish and game laws
say we can't release them into the wild and the city doesn't want to
just kill them. So we're stuck."</LD>
<LD>   The proposal is already drawing protests from wildlife experts. In
an ultraliberal community that worries about the kind of coffee it
drinks, many say that residents are overreaching in trying to find a
politically correct solution--that sterilization is crueler to the
animals than euthanasia.</LD>
<TE>   "Neutering is an invasive surgery," said Susan Heckly, wildlife
rehabilitation director at the Lindsey Wildlife Museum, a nonprofit
in Walnut Creek. "It's not normal for wild animals to be unable to
reproduce. That's what wild animals are all about."</TE>
<TE>   State fish and game laws prohibit the relocation of wild animals,
which officials say spreads disease and violates the turf of other
creatures. And while many communities trap and kill problem skunks
and possums, squeamish Berkeley often turns away from such harsh
measures.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course people are going to say, 'Oh, this is liberal, crazy
Berkeley at it again,' " Maio said. "But I'd like to ask those people
what the alternatives are. Should we all just go out with our
shotguns and start shooting them?"</TE>
<TE>   State Department of Fish and Game officials said they know of no
city in the state that neuters raccoons, and said their approval
would be needed before any local law could take effect.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife advocates said the best course would be to educate
residents in ways to stop attracting the animals. That means not
leaving pet food and water outdoors and closing crawl spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "Communities need to change human behavior first," said Laura
Simon, urban wildlife director for the Fund for Animals' Urban
Wildlife Office in Connecticut. Kate O'Connor, manager of the
city-run Berkeley Animal Care Center, said the city's raccoon
population has remained stable in recent years and presents no more
of a problem than that for other area cities.</TE>
<TE>   She said that about 10 captured animals are brought in each month.
The city euthanizes only if the raccoons are sick or injured, or if
officials cannot determine the neighborhood where they were caught.</TE>
<TE>   "In theory, neutering is a good idea," she said. "But how long
would veterinarians have to keep them in captivity before releasing
them?"</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Pacific Grove, near Monterey, considered neutering
raccoons after an infant suffered permanent brain damage when he
became infected with roundworm, an infection endemic in raccoons.
Officials decided that sterilization would work only if they could
sterilize 90% of the population.</TE>
<TE>   Officials were criticized after asphyxiating scores of raccoons
with carbon dioxide pumped into traps, and activists threatened to
sue to protect the animals.</TE>
<TE>   Maio has had raccoon run-ins. A family nested in her attic. And
raccoons recently invaded a guest's car parked outside her home after
the convertible top had been left down.</TE>
<TE>   "She went out in the middle of the night and found the raccoons
sitting at the wheel of her car, eating cookies," Maio said. "And now
I continually find raccoon paw prints all over my car each morning.
They're looking for more cookies. They remember. They're smart."</TE>

<HD>New Street-Race Penalties Urged</HD>
<DH>Council: Plan would hike fee for reclaiming seized
vehicles, make watching a misdemeanor offense.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After spending a recent night busting street racers in the San
Fernando Valley, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Wendy Greuel on
Tuesday proposed new penalties to deter racers and spectators.</LD>
<LD>   "Illegal street racing terrorizes our neighborhoods and kills our
children, and we must stop it," she said at a City Hall news
conference.</LD>
<LD>   But some racers and business owners said higher fines, stiffer
penalties and more speed bumps won't stop an activity that has been
popular for years on the Valley's straight and wide streets.</LD>
<TE>   "Street racing is like a drug, man," said Eddie Perazzo, owner of
Hi Speed Motor Sports in Sylmar. "You can't raise the prices and just
hope it will go away."</TE>
<TE>   Greuel proposed raising the fee paid to reclaim a vehicle
impounded for racing from the current $123 to $300 for the first
offense and double for each subsequent offense.</TE>
<TE>   Watching an illegal race would become a misdemeanor, carrying up
to a year in jail and a maximum $1,000 fine. Spectators now face no
jail time and pay no more than a $250 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel's motion, which council committees will consider after
Labor Day, would also direct the city attorney and Los Angeles Police
Department to propose a sort of three-strikes bill for street racing
that could be promoted in the state Legislature. Vehicles involved
three times in racing would be confiscated.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel would also like the city to install speed bumps, rumble
strips (dotted or grooved pavement) and other "traffic-calming"
devices on Glenoaks Boulevard in Sun Valley, which runs through her
council district. She joined police and other agencies there Friday
night to witness the racing problem.</TE>
<TE>   But business owners along the boulevard on Tuesday said that
slowing midnight racers with speed bumps is not fair to law-abiding
drivers who travel during the day.</TE>
<TE>   Standing with Greuel at the news conference was Phil Tabbi, who
fondly recalled racing Chevys as a teenager. Now a parent, he
suggested that Los Angeles create a sanctioned drag strip.</TE>

<HD>Railroad Proposal Draws a Crowd</HD>
<DH>Transportation: San Juan Capistrano citizens voice
opposition to proposal for more train tracks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of outraged San Juan Capistrano residents turned out Tuesday
night for a public hearing on a proposal to dig a two-mile trench and
add a second set of train tracks near the city's historic downtown
district.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first opportunity that residents had to officially
voice their displeasure over a controversial proposal to install a
double-track along the coastline in southern Orange County. And speak
out they did, nearly filling the city's community center.</LD>
<LD>   The trench is one of several ideas being studied by Caltrans for
the Los Angeles-San Diego corridor as part of multibillion-dollar
improvements to rail transportation statewide.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think that my house will survive the construction or the
ongoing operation," said Stephen Rios, whose ancestors were among the
original settlers and whose adobe was built in 1794. "As it is, the
house rumbles and the beds move over time."</TE>
<TE>   Rios is also concerned that the project will harm Indian burial
sites. "We don't build roads through our contemporary cemeteries. Why
would we build train tracks through historic Indian burials?"</TE>
<TE>   In June, about three dozen residents strung garments on a 15-foot
clothesline across tracks at the city's old depot in a reenactment of
an 1889 protest against the Santa Fe Railroad.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, overflow crowds turned up at two Caltrans
public hearings in San Clemente to protest a plan to add a second set
of tracks along the city's beach.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed trench through San Juan Capistrano would run from
north of the city's historic mission to Descanso Veterans Park. San
Juan Capistrano residents and city officials worry that construction
of such a tunnel would hurt business and tourism.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents worry that the vibration from the added tracks
would be disruptive and damage the town's old structures, including
the 226-year-old mission and original adobes in the Los Rios Historic
District. Adding a second set of tracks also could force the
demolition of a downtown parking structure and the historic train
depot.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't just dig up the middle of San Juan Capistrano," said
Councilman John Gelff. "This not only impacts the historic district,
but also the Villas [a Latino neighborhood] and a mobile home park."</TE>
<TE>   Business leaders, mission representatives and several elected
county and city officials spoke emotionally in opposing the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the railroad that brought prosperity to this area," said
Tom Bogdanski, who believes that his restaurant in the historic
district could lose $2 million a year because of the proposed
construction. "Don't let this proposal be the golden spike that is
driven into the heart of San Juan Capistrano."</TE>
<TE>   City officials are pushing two inland alternatives--one along the
Foothill Transportation Corridor and the other along the Riverside
Freeway and Interstate 15. Caltrans officials agreed Tuesday night to
study several potential inland routes, including the two proposed by
the city.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans is also considering a three-mile tunnel under Interstate
5. The tunnel would begin 1 1/2 miles north of downtown San Juan
Capistrano and continue under the freeway. Another six-mile tunnel
under Interstate 5 in San Clemente is being studied. Caltrans
officials said tunnels cost from $80 million to $200 million a mile.</TE>

<LD>A construction worker died after falling from the Golden Gate Bridge
on Tuesday, according to Mary Currie, spokeswoman for the Golden Gate
Bridge, Highway and Transportation District.</LD>
<LD>   The 42-year-old man fell about 9:15 a.m., landing on the ground at
the south end of the bridge, Currie said. He was working on the
bridge's earthquake retrofitting.</LD>
<LD>   Currie said she believed it to be the first work-related death on
the bridge since the early 1970s. Several agencies, and Shimmick
Obayashi Joint Venture, the Hayward company contracted to do the
$122-million retrofit, are conducting an investigation.</LD>

<HD>Group Says Asian Americans' Jobs Could Be Jeopardized by
Secession</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new group called Asians for a United L.A. announced Tuesday it will
oppose secession, arguing that breaking up Los Angeles would likely
worsen the lives of Asian Americans, especially recent immigrants and
the working poor.</LD>
<LD>   Secession advocates disagreed, saying they believe a municipal
breakup would create more efficient government that would help all
residents, regardless of ethnicity.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference with Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, city
Public Works Commissioner Ron Low--a past president of the Southern
California Chinese Lawyers Assn.--said Asian Americans who work for
the city could be jeopardized by secession.</LD>
<TE>   He said 1,400 of the 6,200 Asian Americans in the City Hall work
force had been hired in the last few years and would lack seniority
to protect their jobs if secession led to cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "Secession is not a good thing for the Asian-Pacific American
community," Low said. "No one can guarantee the new cities would
adopt programs that provide outreach to minority and women businesses
so they can compete at the public trough."</TE>
<TE>   Low and more than 40 other Asian American community leaders
appeared with Hahn at the Korean Education Complex in Koreatown.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that if the Valley and Hollywood break off, the
Asian-Pacific American community will be left behind in a city that
would have diminished clout in Sacramento and Washington," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis C. Jung, chairman of the Asian Business League of Southern
California, added that his community would be especially harmed if
the breakup led to tax and fee increases because Asian Americans
represent a disproportionate share of the city's small-business
owners.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart Kwoh, executive director of the Asian Pacific American
Legal Center, said a breakup could cause other problems. Valley city
Asian Americans would probably not get the same multi-language
services that they receive from Los Angeles, and their political
influence would be diminished, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asian Americans make up 10% of the population in Los Angeles, but
would account for 8.7% of the population in a Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, chairman of Valley VOTE, said the issue is one of
making city government work for all people, regardless of race, so
"Hahn's continuous focus on ethnicity creates problems."</TE>
<TE>   The secession leader said the news conference gives the false
impression that the Asian American community is united against Valley
cityhood. But Valley VOTE includes Asian American activists, and two
have filed papers to run for a Valley city council, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Groups that have endorsed secession include the Filipino-American
Chamber of Commerce of the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the San Fernando Valley Independence Committee said
that Joel Fox, ex-president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., has
joined the secession group as an analyst and advisor.</TE>

<HD>425-Year Term Urged for Campus Murderer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The district attorney's office recommended a prison sentence of 425
years to life this week for 16-year-old Andy Williams, who pleaded
guilty to last year's shooting rampage at Santana High School that
killed two students and wounded 13 others.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorneys have asked Superior Court Judge Herbert J.
Exarhos for the minimum sentence of 50 years to life, noting that
Williams has accepted responsibility for his crimes and expressed
remorse.</LD>
<LD>   An Illinois couple who are part of a group called Friends and
Supporters of Charles Andy Williams decried the prosecutors' Monday
recommendation.</LD>
<TE>   "It doesn't surprise me, but it certainly shows what happens when
we begin trying children as adults: Anything goes," said Robert
Grimm, who lives in a Chicago suburb and started the support group.
"Here's a kid who was bullied very badly, and then he exploded. We
need to stop treating children as predators."</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Dist. Atty. Kris Anton said she rejected the request
for concurrent sentences for two counts of murder and 13 counts of
attempted murder stemming from the six-minute shooting spree on the
morning of March 5, 2001, in suburban Santee.</TE>
<TE>   "I could not justify concurrent terms because there were separate
acts of violence and separate victims," Anton said. "If he had
stopped shooting after he killed Bryan Zuckor, the sentence would
have been 50 to life but he didn't. He kept shooting."</TE>
<TE>   Several victims and their family members plan to testify Thursday
before Exarhos decides Williams' sentence. Grimm's group is planning
a candlelight vigil outside San Diego Juvenile Hall on Thursday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Anton said that she talked to victims and their family members
before deciding on her recommendation. "In general, they want to make
sure he never gets out."</TE>
<TE>   Williams is set to be sent to a youthful offender portion of a
state prison until he reaches 18 and is transferred to the adult
section.</TE>

<LD>To give children better access to public transportation, the Los
Angeles school board voted unanimously on Tuesday to help streamline
the process for buying student discount passes.</LD>
<LD>   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's application
requirement is too cumbersome for children and parents, said board
member Genethia Hudley-Hayes. "We should be making that as easy a
process as possible."</LD>
<LD>   Her motion, which board President Caprice Young praised as being
long overdue, directs school officials to work with the MTA to
develop a plan in the next 90 days to streamline the student transit
pass application process.</LD>
<TE>   To qualify for a $20 monthly pass, students must submit an
application with a small photo, verification from their school and a
$1 processing fee. They then receive an annual pass in the mail,
which they must activate by buying a $20 stamp every month. A student
must re-apply every year.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to make sure they're legitimate students," said MTA
spokesman Marc Littman. He said the MTA's new automated system sends
passes 20 days after receipt of an application.</TE>
<TE>   But members of the Bus Riders Union said they have known instances
in which students waited months for their passes. Littman said the
problem could be caused by delays from schools in forwarding
applications to the MTA.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Adapting INS Idea to Track Terror Suspects</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A system credited with helping the Immigration and Naturalization
Service catch hundreds of wanted felons along California's border
with Mexico will soon become part of a national security net aimed at
identifying possible terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   The national program, unveiled this week, will require thousands
of foreign visitors to be fingerprinted and photographed, beginning
Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The pictures and fingerprints will then be checked against a
database of wanted criminals and suspected terrorists. They will also
be cataloged to keep track of those entering and leaving the country.</LD>
<TE>   The fingerprint-and photo-matching technology has helped INS
agents catch more than 2,000 fugitives trying to reenter the country
this year, U.S. Department of Justice officials said.</TE>
<TE>   At San Diego's three ports of entry, among the busiest in the
country, INS officials have arrested more than 600 people in the last
10 months wanted for crimes ranging from murder to robbery.</TE>
<TE>   The national program uses existing technology and adds a second
database to track foreign visitors who are believed to present a high
terrorism risk, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Those who will come under scrutiny include visitors from Iran,
Iraq, Libya, Sudan and Syria, countries that are on the State
Department's list of terrorism sponsors. Other visitors who meet
"intelligence criteria reflecting patterns of terrorist
organizations' activities" will also be fingerprinted and
photographed.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Martinez, a U.S. Justice Department spokesman, declined to
describe the "intelligence criteria," citing national security.</TE>
<TE>   The program is a response to federal legislation passed last year
that called for tighter control of the flow of visitors in and out of
the country after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It will be
implemented at several ports of entry on Sept. 11 and, after a 20-day
test phase, expanded to all sea, air and land ports.</TE>
<TE>   "The vulnerabilities of our immigration system became starkly
clear on Sept. 11," Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said Monday. "This
system will expand substantially America's scrutiny of those foreign
visitors who may present an elevated national security risk."</TE>
<TE>   But the program also drew criticism from civil libertarians and
immigrant groups.</TE>
<TE>   "It is nothing short of racial profiling," said Hussam Ayloush,
executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations in
Orange County. "The main impact will be to send a message to
law-abiding visitors who happen to be Muslims and Arabs that America
is a land where they will be treated differently."</TE>

<HD>Separated Twins' Parents Get No Peace</HD>
<DH>Surgery: Media hound the couple, who hope the publicity
leads to a better life back in Guatemala.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE-MARIE O'CONNOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Television crews knock on their door at all hours. A Hollywood
producer is chasing the rights to their story. People want to know if
they have an agent.</LD>
<LD>   The parents of the formerly conjoined Guatemalan twins: Will their
lives ever be the same?</LD>
<LD>   The father, Wenceslao Quiej, who until recently earned about $2 a
day bagging bananas, hopes not.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to return to Guatemala and have a better future than the
one I had," he said late Monday, after a long day dealing with People
magazine, The Times and NBC's "Today" show.</TE>
<TE>   The family arrived by an incredible stroke of destiny. A medical
philanthropy group learned their conjoined baby daughters faced an
uncertain fate living in a Guatemalan state hospital and brought them
to the UCLA hospital where a medical team separated the girls.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Quiej, 21, and his wife, Alba Leticia Alvarez, 22, stay at
the Los Angeles apartment of a cousin, visiting their daughters in a
hospital where TV crews wander the pediatric floor and occasionally
erupt into loud squabbles.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been interviewing me every day," Quiej said. "Every
morning, the phone starts ringing, and it keeps ringing until we go
to bed."</TE>
<TE>   Instant fame followed a 22-hour operation that has touched hearts
around the world. Already, a foundation is talking about creating a
job for Quiej in Guatemala City so he and his wife can be with their
daughters while the twins get the long-term medical care doctors say
they will need. He currently holds a 65-day visa that he would like
to extend and said his wife's tenure in the U.S. is more open-ended.</TE>
<TE>   Radio, TV, newspapers and, apparently, Hollywood, are all
interested in recounting the journey of the young banana packer and
his wife from Belen, a remote hamlet at the foot of a volcano, to
center stage of the world's media capital.</TE>
<TE>   It is a story that begins four years ago on a river-laced stretch
of Guatemala's Pacific Coast, where daily rains nurture orchid-filled
tropical forests, as well as a banana industry serving U.S.
supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   It was here that Quiej met Alba Leticia Alvarez during her
village's May 2 Santo de Las Cruzes festival, one of the religious
celebrations that are the backbone of provincial social life.</TE>
<TE>   Quiej, then 17, thought Alvarez was pretty. She was shy, and
unlike Quiej, she could converse in Kakchiquel, one of dozens of
Mayan languages. He began to court Alvarez a year later, after
starting work in the banana fields alongside his father, Wenceslao
Quiej Sr.</TE>
<TE>   Quiej and his father's workday began at 4 a.m. with a 90-minute
bus ride along the rain-swollen Rio Bravo to the lowlands of the
Bella Mar II banana farm in Tiquisate, 35 miles south. Their work
ended at 3:30 or 4 p.m., but workers often did not make it down the
rutted stone road to Belen until 7:30 or later, Quiej said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a life of necessity," Quiej said, shrugging.</TE>
<TE>   When Quiej turned 20, he and Alvarez married at the yellow
cinder-block church in Belen, a settlement with limited electricity
and where many people lack running water. He moved in with his wife's
family in Las Cruzes, 11 miles from the banana fields. And then, he
said, he looked forward to becoming a father.</TE>
<TE>   'Bereft of All Hope'</TE>
<TE>   At the end of her pregnancy, Alvarez suffered wrenching pains and
the family took her to the city of Mazatenango, an hour's drive from
Belen. The girls were born by caesarean section on July 25, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   When Quiej had his first astonishing look at his daughters,
Alvarez was still under anesthesia. The girls were joined at the
head, facing opposite directions. Together, they weighed 8 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt sad, bereft of all hope," Quiej said. "They were so
skinny. I thought they would die."</TE>
<TE>   But the girls began to eat "very hungrily," he said. When his wife
awoke, he told her they had twins, but he wouldn't let her see the
girls, and he began to search for a way to tell her they were
conjoined. Two days later, he still hadn't found the words.</TE>
<TE>   "She wanted to see them, but I didn't show her," Quiej said. "I
said, 'I'm sorry, I can't. They're not right.' "</TE>
<TE>   By the third day, the clinic had alerted the state hospital in
Guatemala City and arranged to send the twins there. Then Quiej told
his wife she could see her new daughters.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez declined to be interviewed for this story. A photo of her,
taken at the clinic that day, shows her staring at the girls, her
hands covering her mouth, a look of despair on her tear-stained face.</TE>
<TE>   Mother 'Emotional'</TE>
<TE>   "I told her not to cry. She was very emotional," Quiej said.</TE>
<TE>   The twin girls, according to relatives in Guatemala, quickly grew
strong. When they learned to smile, they were all smiles. When they
learned to speak, they sang out "Mama" and "Papa" to the doctors,
nurses and relatives who visited their room at the Guatemalan
Institute of Social Security hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "We were so worried, but the Maritas were happy, God bless them,"
said their grandmother, Loyda de Jesus Lopez, 47, using the family's
nickname, "the little Marias," for the twins, Maria Teresa and Maria
de Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   "When you walked into the room, they held out their hands so you
would hug them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Visits to the hospital required a five-hour bus ride from Belen.
Quiej said the family made the trip to Guatemala City every eight
days, but occasionally 15 or 20 days would pass before they could
visit. Sometimes they had to return the same day.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to hug them and cradle them a little, but we had a long
road home," Quiej said.</TE>
<TE>   The Guatemalan Pediatric Foundation took an interest in the twins
and began to investigate whether they could be separated, but Quiej
said the idea stalled.</TE>
<TE>   An international medical charity, Healing the Children, alerted
UCLA. Dr. Jorge Lazareff, the pediatric neurosurgeon, flew to
Guatemala to see the twins, and in June the charity paid to fly the
girls and their mother to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Quiej's relatives in Los Angeles visited Alvarez and the twins.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Alvarez "felt very alone," he said. "She couldn't
get used to hospital food, so my family would bring her chicken and
beef stews, like we cook in Guatemala."</TE>
<TE>   Quiej said Lazareff insisted that he fly to Los Angeles for the
operation. When Quiej arrived on Aug. 2, he and Alvarez moved in with
his cousin.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt happy," he said, "happy we were all together again."</TE>
<TE>   Girls Remain Stable</TE>
<TE>   The surgery was complex: UCLA surgeons had to cut through the
bone, redirect shared blood vessels and cover the exposed brain with
skin. On Tuesday, they remained in critical but stable condition.</TE>
<TE>   "In two months, if they're running around and going at each other
as sisters do, we'll know they're coming along," said Irwin Weiss,
the pediatric care specialist.</TE>
<TE>   The doctors have donated their services and UCLA hopes to recoup
the cost of the twins' care, estimated at $1.5 million, through
donations.</TE>
<TE>   The family's L.A.-based relatives know press attention is the best
way to drum up support, and they try to persuade Quiej and Alvarez to
give interviews at the hospital. But when they do, they are often
dismayed by the questions.</TE>
<TE>   Quiej said one Spanish-language reporter asked his wife which girl
she would choose if they could save just one.</TE>
<TE>   The other day, Alvarez got upset when she saw photographers had
been allowed to take pictures of the girls before she arrived at the
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Wife Reluctant to Talk</TE>
<TE>   Quiej is more comfortable with the attention. But his wife's
reluctance often prompts the couple to back out of interviews at the
last minute, prompting reporters to try again on their doorstep.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters who traveled from Guatemala were refused an interview
until a relative persuaded the parents to talk.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez has been very nervous since the operation, explained a
cousin, Victor Hernandez. "She's from a little village. This has been
a lot of pressure."</TE>
<TE>   It's all a little overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   "A Spanish-language reporter said I was a machista, that I was
prohibiting Leticia from giving interviews," Quiej said. "But I
don't.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is, sometimes Lety just doesn't want to talk."</TE>

<HD>Gas Leak Forces Evacuation in Oxnard</HD>
<DH>Safety: More than 30 people must leave their homes when a
pipeline bursts during a fumigation effort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 30 Oxnard residents were evacuated from their homes early
Tuesday after a gas pipeline burst as workers cut the fuel supply to
a house tented for fumigation.</LD>
<LD>   Residents were rousted from their beds, breakfast tables and
showers when the pipeline broke just after 8:30 a.m. at a house in
the 1500 block of Morris Street.</LD>
<LD>   There were no injuries.</LD>
<TE>   "We were all ready to fumigate, but then we just smelled the gas
and got out," said Rogelio Gonzales, 50, after fleeing the house with
the gas leak. "How could I not be afraid? One spark and we are all
gone."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales said his family has lived in rented house for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent Guerrero, an employee with Oxnard-based Tri-Fume Inc.,
said he was attempting to shut off the house's gas supply when the
valve shot from the gas meter. Smelling fumes, Guerrero said he
immediately began alerting neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to shut off the gas and I heard this loud spurt of gas,"
he said. "I had two of my helpers with me and we started knocking on
people's doors. I was concerned for everybody's safety."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard fire officials said that corrosion and rust built up on the
section of pipe leading to the house may have caused a break.</TE>
<TE>   But Southern California Gas Co. officials later inspected the
pipes and found no signs of corrosion or other damage, said Joe Chow,
a spokesman for company.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of shutting off the gas, Chow said Guerrero might have
mistakenly opened up the gas line, causing the valve to pop off and
leading to pressure that caused a break in the line.</TE>
<TE>   Chow said Guerrero told inspectors he attempted to reattach the
valve but was unsuccessful. In a few seconds, the pressure on the
metal pipeline went from less than 1 pound per square inch to at
least 40 pounds, Chow said. A loud hissing sound could be heard as
the highly flammable natural gas shot into the air.</TE>
<TE>   Alerted by Guerrero and others about the gas leak, residents
quickly filed into the street.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero said he's well-acquainted with the gas meters and lines
for homes and apartment buildings. He said it's not uncommon for him
and his crew to turn off the gas at half a dozen homes a day.</TE>
<TE>   He said natural gas is routinely shut off during fumigation
because a chemical released during the process can permanently fog
windows and mirrors if it mixes with the fuel.</TE>
<TE>   While Guerrero spoke with gas company officials, residents sipped
coffee and waited in curlers, pajamas or work clothes for
firefighters to declare the area safe. Shortly after 10 a.m., yellow
tape that had cordoned off 10 homes on both sides of the street was
removed, and residents were allowed to return.</TE>
<TE>   The incident occurred just hours after an explosion in Torrance
leveled a home tented for fumigation. The explosion damaged at least
80 homes and injured 10 people. The cause was unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Fire Capt. Craig Freeman said he and other members of his
truck company were watching television news reports of the Torrance
explosion when the call came in.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us have been on enough explosions so we know what can
happen," said Freeman, who has been a firefighter for 21 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the realities of the job."</TE>

unrelated incident, a house in Torrance that was being fumigated
exploded Tuesday. B4</CP>

the Ventura County Superior Court, is leaving the public bench to
become a private jurist.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson, an appointee of former Gov. Jerry Brown, has notified
court officials that she will resign her $139,000-a-year Superior
Court position in late September and enter the lucrative rent-a-judge
business.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson said she's not changing jobs for the money but to stay
fresh intellectually and to learn something new. When she passed her
20th anniversary on the bench this year, she said she knew it was
time to go.</LD>
<TE>   "People ask me why I'm leaving, and [former Baltimore Oriole] Cal
Ripken comes to mind," Johnson said. "He did what he did longer than
anybody else; then one day he said, 'I'm going to sit out a game.'
There's a rhythm to things and a pace to things. You know when it's
time for something new."</TE>
<TE>   Considered one of the county's top judges, and ranked as
outstanding by the local bar association, Johnson's departure will
leave a large hole on the Superior Court, judges and lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   Witty and outgoing, the calm, disciplined jurist has used a keen
intelligence and meticulous preparation to become expert in family
law, probate and civil procedure--an instructor of lawyers and other
judges statewide.</TE>
<TE>   "I think of the time John Wooden left as coach at UCLA. Or how
would you like to follow Chick Hearn with the Lakers?" said Steve
Henderson, executive director of the Ventura County Bar Assn. "Her
shoes are going to be very difficult to fill."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson plans to leave the Superior Court on Sept. 27 and begin
work as a judge-for-hire the following week.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know whether it's work ethic or guilt," she said, "but I
do everything I can down to the last minute. Besides, our court is
short-handed."</TE>
<TE>   The Superior Court, down one judge for years, will now need two to
reach full strength with 28 jurists. A bar association committee will
evaluate candidates and make recommendations to Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers familiar with the application process say potential
candidates include Court Commissioners Manuel J. Covarrubias and Gary
K. Barrett, and lawyers Gregory J. Ramirez and Carmen O. Ramirez of
Oxnard and Dennis O. LaRochelle of Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever is selected will need to reach for Johnson's standard,
colleagues said.</TE>
<TE>   "She's probably our most experienced and versatile judge," said
Bruce Clark, presiding judge of the Superior Court. "She is
exceptionally bright, not to denigrate any other judge. Rumor has it
she was considered for the Court of Appeal."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and her longtime Superior Court office mate, Steven Z.
Perren, were both top candidates when Perren was chosen justice for
the state 2nd Court of Appeal in Ventura in 1999. More recently, she
was a top contender for an appellate position in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a hard worker and terrific judge," Perren said. "She's as
smart a judge as ever sat on the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Although excelling in several disciplines of civil law, the former
county prosecutor may be most expert in family law, which she has
taught at the state Judicial College in Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Lascher, an appeals lawyer who heads the local bar's
Judicial Evaluations Committee, said she has had plenty of
opportunity to gauge the quality of the decisions of local judges.</TE>
<TE>   "My work is looking at what they've done," she said. "And believe
me, I've seen some bad ones from some of our sitting judges. But
never from her."</TE>
<TE>   Lascher, a contemporary of Johnson's, said the judge has always
stood out: "She's just very nice, very smart, calm and sensible.
Actually, I've never seen her get excited."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's biggest critics are probably county prosecutors, who
think she has been too lenient in sentencing criminals.</TE>
<TE>   "I liked her," Assistant Dist. Atty. Greg Totten said. "But she
wasn't somebody who, generally, we thought we got good results from.
We had her disqualified from cases on occasion."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Bill Redmond, who worked in
Johnson's juvenile court daily for two years, said her sentences were
not always as tough as he would have liked, but she always was
evenhanded in explaining her decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't always agree," he said. "And she was one of the most
caring individuals that I experienced on the juvenile bench. She
really took the time to get to know the juvenile defendant, their
family situation, their whole social history. And she really tried to
structure a disposition that would rehabilitate that kid."</TE>
<TE>   When she started at Hastings School of Law in San Francisco after
graduation from Stanford University in 1969, Johnson said, there was
an unwritten 10% ceiling on women law students. Now, nationwide, more
than 50% of law school graduates are women. "Fascinating, isn't it,
what happens when you take the lid off," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, Johnson was the first woman on the Superior
Court and its first female presiding judge. And she was the first
woman to serve on the 2nd Court of Appeal, albeit for a fill-in
stint.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big deal to everyone else, but I was raised in a
newspaper family--my dad was the bureau chief for Newsweek--and I
would sit out there and talk politics with guys from the New York
Times and the Washington Post," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was 6 or 7, I'd discuss the Suez Canal crisis, and they
told me I'd be the first woman president. So I always thought I could
be anything I wanted to be."</TE>
<TE>   Still, she had to balance work and family. She's been married to
Harley-riding defense lawyer Jay Johnson, and she sometimes hops onto
the back of his bike for a Sunday ride. They met at Stanford and her
license plate bears their wedding date: 9-13-69.</TE>
<TE>   Yet she describes herself as the ugly duckling of her family,
since one sister is the writer of the movie "ET" and the wife of
actor Harrison Ford, and the other is an Emmy-award winning
television writer. One brother is a freelance writer and the other a
musician.</TE>
<TE>   Two big cases indicate the broad scope of her judicial career: She
oversaw a multimillion-dollar product liability verdict against Ford
Motor Co. because of gas fumes leaking into one of its sedans in the
1980s and imposed a $4-million jury award against Target stores for
alleged illegal detention of employees suspected of theft in the
1990s.</TE>

<LD>A former Buena High School custodian pleaded guilty Tuesday to
possession of child pornography, a misdemeanor with a maximum
sentence of one year in jail.</LD>
<LD>   John Gomez Ruiz, 41, was arrested Feb. 2 after several videotapes
depicting children having sex were found when detectives from the
Ventura County Sheriff's Department searched Ruiz's Saticoy home and
school work area, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The search was prompted by a sting operation with the U.S. Postal
Service to catch mail-order buyers of child-porn videos, Deputy Dist.
Atty. David Lehr said.</LD>
<TE>   Lehr said authorities also found Ruiz in possession of more than
400 pieces of women's underwear, including Buena High cheerleading
clothing, and adult pornography. No students appeared to be involved,
Lehr said.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz has been on unpaid leave from the Ventura Unified School
District since his arrest, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Council Member Is Again an Officer</HD>
<DH>Police: Dennis Zine, who had served with West Valley
Division, joins LAPD reserves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Residents of Los Angeles now have another opportunity to meet one of
their City Council members--when he arrests them.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Dennis Zine, who represents the west San Fernando
Valley and served 33 years as a Los Angeles Police Department
officer, rejoined the LAPD as a reserve officer on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In handing Zine a badge at Parker Center, acting Police Chief
Martin Pomeroy set aside his concerns about putting an elected
official in a potentially dangerous job and allowing someone with
control over the Police Department's budget to work in its
ranks--even for just two days a month.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, he said, having a member of the council's Public Safety
Committee carrying a gun and riding in a squad car is a "unique, rare
and pleasurable" opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to two days a month having my boss working
for me," Pomeroy said.</TE>
<TE>   Zine, 55, said he will fill in for active officers on nights,
weekends and holidays, most likely in the West Valley Division, where
he used to work as a motorcycle officer. He is classified as a "line
reserve" officer--one of a group of 235 members of the reserve force
who are allowed to make arrests and perform all the other duties of a
patrol officer on active duty.</TE>
<TE>   Becoming a line reserve officer usually requires 1,000 hours of
training, but the LAPD waived that requirement because of Zine's long
career with the department before his 2001 election to the council.</TE>
<TE>   Zine, the first L.A. police officer since Tom Bradley to be
elected to the City Council, is the first council member to serve as
a reserve officer, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It sends a strong message to the officers that someone is
supporting them," Zine said, adding that he hopes more Angelenos will
join the LAPD's reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Zine's son, Christopher, is an active-duty officer with the LAPD's
Pacific Division.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the Police Department has 680 reserve officers, all of
them volunteers. Most of them do administrative work and are not
peace officers.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD says it is short 1,100 officers, and loses more officers
than it hires. Last week, Mayor James K. Hahn signed legislation to
make it easier and more attractive for officers who leave the LAPD to
return to active duty.</TE>
<TE>   Zine will receive a $50 monthly stipend to maintain his uniform
and for other incidentals. He said he will donate the stipend to
charity. Joining the reserve force will have no impact on Zine's
eventual LAPD pension, which he has not yet begun to draw.</TE>
