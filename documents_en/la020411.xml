<HD>Trip to the Near East Rekindles Love for L.A.</HD>

<LD>It is my personal belief that a desert is for sidewinders,
centipedes, scorpions and small rodents that feed on grubs. I don't
think God ever intended it to be occupied by retired cardiologists,
octogenarian golfers, aging actors with jet-black hair and old ladies
in shorts so tight they can hardly walk.</LD>
<LD>   Then why, in all of his secular wisdom, did he create Palm
Springs?</LD>
<LD>   I ask that with a child's innocence, having just returned from a
weekend in the place. I was so happy to be back in L.A., I could have
kissed the ground, but I know better than to kiss anything dirty.</LD>
<TE>   Before I get into the Palm Springs story, however, I am forced to
make reference to a previous column in which I waxed Victorian over
the fog, the jazz and the martinis of San Francisco. I called it my
spiritual home, more or less, and pretty much dismissed L.A. as a
kind of pimple on a pleasant memory.</TE>
<TE>   Well, I've changed my mind.</TE>
<TE>   In the world of column-writing, we don't always offer a reason
when we switch from one point of view to the other with the speed of
a cobra strike. That's partly because we don't always remember our
earlier point of view and partly because we're hoping that you don't
remember our earlier point of view.</TE>
<TE>   At any rate, after a trip to San Francisco, I was required by
prior commitment to visit what my wife, the observant Cinelli, refers
to as Beverly Hills South or Malibu in the Desert. That would be the
aforementioned Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   After only about an hour there, sandblasting winds, an unrelenting
sun and the prosaic nature of it all quickly wiped the romantic
images of San Francisco from my head and replaced them with a view of
what hell would be like if the devil had money.</TE>
<TE>   For those who have never been to the jewel of Coachella Valley, it
is a city of about 42,000 souls most of the time, but double that
number in the winter months, when cold people come to get warm or
when spring-breakers come to get drunk and throw up.</TE>
<TE>   With about a third of the population over 60, there are more gray
heads on Palm Canyon Drive than possibly anywhere else in the world,
wandering back and forth with the aimlessness of grazing cattle.</TE>
<TE>   Because I am over 60 and gray, I kept thinking as I watched them
that there but for the grace of taste and ambition go I. A friend,
Chuck Morrell, who moved a year ago from Pacific Palisades to Palm
Springs for reasons that now escape him, lamented during our visit,
"Everyone here looks like me."</TE>
<TE>   Morrell is also in his 60s but is not about to spend his life
shuffling about in the desert. He's sorry now that he ever left L.A.,
with its ocean and its energy, to come to a place where the wind
continuously turns his patio into a sand dune. He wants out.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, there is Nigel Brown, another displaced person
from L.A., who lives in a Palm Springs condo with his giant dog and
loves everything about the place. One can only ascribe that to
lowered expectations, or the effect of too many hours in the sun
without a hat. I tried to see what he saw, looking, as it were,
through the eyes of a dreamer, but it just wasn't there for me. To
each, I suppose, his own.</TE>
<TE>   Having said all that, let me get to the reason for being in Palm
Springs in the first place. It was the Follies. They have been
produced annually for 11 years by their creator, Riff Markowitz, and
consist of three hours of entertainment that even teenagers with
minimal IQs would enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   None of the performers, including the chorus "girls," were under
60, and some were in their 80s. Even the animals in the dog act were
old. It was pure vaudeville, a page torn from the past that must have
seemed like yesterday to a good part of the audience, who were also
old. In addition to the dancers, retired professionals who can kick
higher than I can reach, the show consisted of singers, musicians, an
impersonator, a real vaudeville team and some of the flashiest
costumes west of Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   Markowitz, an ex-circus clown and television producer (why does
that seem to go together?), emceed the show with humor oriented
toward time and the passing years. For instance, comparing the simple
pleasures of yesterday with the high-speed, electronic demands of
today, he remembers a trip along Route 66 and asks, "Can you imagine
your granddaughter driving 2,400 miles and being entertained by Burma
Shave signs?"</TE>
<TE>   When the audience gives a performer a standing ovation, Markowitz
ad-libs, "I can't tell you how good it is to see an audience stand."
Pause. "Especially this audience."</TE>
<TE>   And: "Some of you have been coming back for years." Pause. "You do
remember coming here before?"</TE>
<TE>   I had read in advance the remark of a critic that no one would pay
to see old ladies' legs, but the critic was wrong. More than 2
million people have paid to see them and the jump-roping dog and the
three-legged dancer and an emcee who can make you laugh so hard your
rib bones crackle.</TE>
<TE>   I wish Markowitz would bring the show to L.A., so I could go see
it again without crawling through the desert like a Gila monster
looking for something to bite. I'm tired of picking sand out of my
beard.</TE>

<HD>Counseling From a Man Who Knows Divorce</HD>

<AU>GINA PICCALO AND LOUISE  ROUG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Stephan Cohen is the kind of person you would want on your
side in the courtroom.</LD>
<LD>   Chairman of the law firm Morrison Cohen Singer &amp; Weinstein, Cohen
is a high-profile matrimonial lawyer: He handles divorces. Wearing a
blue handmade shirt from England, gold antique cuff links and a
Cartier wedding band, Cohen exudes the confidence you would expect
from the man who has represented clients including Christie Brinkley
against Billy Joel, Tommy Mottola against Mariah Carey, and Ivana
Trump and Marla Maples against The Donald.</LD>
<LD>   Despite his metier, however, Cohen is more interested in helping
people stay together than helping them split, he says over lunch on a
recent afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   To that end, he wrote "Reconcilable Differences" (Simon &amp;
Schuster, 2002), an anatomy of divorce that offers seven "essential
tips to remaining together."</TE>
<TE>   "I know more about divorces than therapists," says Cohen, who's
based in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "You're part-time shrink, lawyer and sycophant. You become part of
the client's life."</TE>
<TE>   The 63-year-old lawyer began writing the book two years ago,
prompted in part, he says, by his second divorce some years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd been married 20 some-odd years," says Cohen, adding he didn't
know how awful divorce was until then. "Most people want to stay
married," he says. "You're a lot better off married."</TE>
<TE>   People get married because they love each other, because they want
to be committed, intimate, "all good things," he says. "To rip that
apart is wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen is especially disturbed by the notion of "starter
marriages." "People in their 20s who view this marriage as a test
drive," he says. "There's zero commitment. They're not even buying
the car, they're just test-driving it."</TE>
<TE>   Divorce, he says, is a sad and dirty business.</TE>
<TE>   "Doing divorce work, you see people at their worst. In business
litigation, there's a clear objective." Divorce, he says, "is not a
deal. It's a deal plus ... the objective is sometimes to punish, to
get even."</TE>
<TE>   Although every marriage can't be saved, Cohen says many couples
can work things out, and he is not afraid to turn away prospective
clients and urge them to give it another go, he says.</TE>
<TE>   His main words of advice for a successful marriage could be
straight from Dear Abby: work and commitment.</TE>
<TE>   "We're [more] committed to making our jobs work, to get a low
[golf] handicap, to play tennis," he says. "I want people to make
it."</TE>
<TE>   Theater That</TE>
<TE>   Reflects Life</TE>
<TE>   Playwright-actor Daniel MacIvor sits cross-legged in the empty
theater, silently pondering the nature of his work. It's
Tuesday--rehearsal night--at the Freud Playhouse at UCLA, and members
of his Toronto-based company da da kamera are testing sound, running
lines and setting lights for their show, which runs through Saturday.
It's the group's first appearance in Los Angeles, a city that MacIvor
says smells of celluloid and possesses the well-preserved appearance
of a movie set. Suddenly, the noise of a high-volume car crash
screams through the room. It's a sound effect that makes MacIvor
cringe. The room falls silent again, and he smiles. "That kind of
describes the process very well," he says. "We learn by failing."</TE>
<TE>   Da da kamera is an avant-garde theater company that MacIvor
founded in 1986. MacIvor says the name is his invention, which
translated from Russian (da da) and German (kamera) means "Yes, yes,
to the small room." The phrase is a metaphor for the intimacy that
MacIvor aspires to bring to each performance. "We're minimalists," he
says. "My work has always been about getting to the essential."</TE>
<TE>   The company's new show "In on It" features MacIvor and actor
Darren O'Donnell on a bare stage with minimal lighting. They portray
former lovers who are rehearsing a play that in some ways reflects
the subtleties of their relationship. Consequently, Tuesday's
rehearsal was steeped in surreal moments of life imitating art
imitating life.</TE>
<TE>   After an opening monologue, O'Donnell offers a critique to
MacIvor: "You think that's a good way to start?" Later he adds, "It
doesn't end very well." These lines are delivered in character.
"We're inviting the audience to make a judgment," MacIvor says of the
show. "Then to some extent, I suppose, pulling the carpet out [from
under it]."</TE>
<TE>   Ozzy Fest</TE>
<TE>   Grammy Award winner, rocker and sitcom dad Ozzy Osbourne will get
a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Friday. The 53-year-old, who
currently stars as himself in the MTV reality sitcom "The Osbournes,"
will be honored with the 2,195th star, in a ceremony presided over by
honorary Hollywood mayor Johnny Grant.</TE>

<HD>A Kung-Fu Grip on Their Hearts</HD>
<DH>G.I. Joe reigns as the ultimate action hero at a convention
of military toys and demonstrations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a weekend convention where hundreds of foot-high G.I. Joes were
posed doing everything from patrolling the Tora Bora mountains on
horseback to fighting the enemy with their kung-fu grips, Hollywood
resident Larry Taylor found a way for his prized action figure to
stand out. He made it look just like him.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't just that the 38-year-old and the ageless doll were
outfitted with the same rifle, helmet, gloves, goggles, boots and
desert camouflage fatigues. They also had the same face. Taylor, who
works for a movie special-effects studio in Burbank, custom crafted
his doll's mug to replace Joe's store-bought original.</LD>
<LD>   "I never thought I'd be one of those guys standing here holding
one of these," said Taylor, hamming it up with his G.I. Joe mini-me.
"But I've really gone full bore into this."</LD>
<TE>   Like a couple thousand others of his stripe, mostly young and
middle-aged men, Taylor couldn't resist the bugle call to "A Weekend
of Heroes," a gathering of military buffs buying and selling
collectibles and participating in demonstrations, lectures and
reenactments at the Pacific Palms Conference Resort in Industry last
weekend. Sponsored by what could best be called the toy
military-industrial complex, the three-day spectacle's main mission
seemed to be to sell as many dolls as possible, or pretend to die
trying.</TE>
<TE>   Conventioneers, some of whom flew in from as far away as
Washington, D.C., and Guatemala, were greeted by an impressive fleet
of authentic and still-functioning World War II tanks, planes and
armored personnel carriers. Scores of World War II
reenactors--representing German, Russian and American G.I.s--roamed
the grounds as well.</TE>
<TE>   Demonstrations of commando tactics by Navy SEALS were staged.
Retired Col. Danny McKnight, depicted in the movie "Black Hawk Down"
by actor Tom Sizemore, talked about his experiences commanding troops
in Somalia in October 1993. The piece de resistance was a nighttime
Nazi-Soviet battle reenactment featuring a real Russian T-34 tank.</TE>
<TE>   But tanks and reenactments are child's play, mere distractions,
compared with a conventioneer's serious pursuit of G.I. Joe. To
outsiders, G.I. Joe is often used as a generic term for all action
figures with a military bent made by a number of different toy
manufacturers. But enthusiasts will never go that route; "G.I. Joe"
will always mean the specific brand created by Hasbro, which first
introduced the wildly successful doll in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1960s, the patriotic action figure and his many, many
new cousins have come a long way. A peek inside the bag of a
conventioneer who would identify himself only as 23-year-old "Matt
the Dork" clearly illustrates how the toys have changed.</TE>
<TE>   Matt, sporting a Mohawk cut with black and orange hair, a dozen
body piercings and 4-inch platform shoes, didn't want to give his
full name because he said he didn't want to draw even more attention
to himself. He bought dolls of Adolf Hitler, German tank commander
Erwin Rommel and a Navy SEAL.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to get here early and leave early," said Matt, who helps
design action figures for fast-food restaurants. "Those guys in there
are dorks ... just dorks. But I guess I am too."</TE>
<TE>   While Matt's choice in fashion and action figures were somewhat
atypical among the conventioneers, his spending total was not. He
shelled out $240 for the trio. (The SEAL was most expensive at $110,
in part because of its elaborate scuba accessories; at $50, Hitler
was the cheapest.)</TE>
<TE>   With prices like that, it's easy to see why G.I. Joe and his
legions of action-figure imitators are responsible for hundreds of
millions of dollars in annual sales. The profit potential has
translated into virtual warfare among the handful of toy
manufacturers, such as 21st Century Toys, eager to capture Matt the
Dork's dollar.</TE>
<TE>   And when 40-plus toy vendors are crammed into a hockey rink-size
hotel ballroom, flaring tempers are inevitable, said the show's
affable promoter, John Lu.</TE>
<TE>   "Toy politics," said. Lu. "My hair is turning gray over toy
politics. It's like a car show where GM doesn't want Honda there and
Honda doesn't want GM there."</TE>
<TE>   There are times, for instance, when one vendor complains that
another has an unfair vantage point for sales, and the tension can
become so thick you'd think shooting might break out, jokes Lu. Of
course, it doesn't. But if so inclined, the vendors wouldn't have to
go far for weaponry.</TE>
<TE>   A company called Airsoft Elite was selling authentic-looking
handguns and rifles that shoot BBs. In addition to the Airsoft Elite
Babes drawing attention to their booth, the company also set up a
shooting gallery. One 11-year-old boy in safety goggles fired off 200
rounds from an MP-5, a weapon costing roughly $500 that shoots
semiautomatically or automatically at the flick of a switch. From
less than 10 yards away, the boy blew the face off an Osama bin Laden
poster.</TE>
<TE>   The real fireworks, however, exploded on a chilly Saturday night
when more than 50 World War II German and Russian Army reenactors
took to the hills above the hotel. About as many spectators were
bused up to the "Caucasus Mountains" (local bluffs) to witness the
fierce battle (everyone fired blanks) to capture two enormous oil
tanker trucks (water tankers).</TE>
<TE>   After waiting half an hour on a windy bluff in near-darkness for
the mock battle to begin, one battle reenactment-hardened American
vet sighed, "War is 95% boredom and 5% shock and terror. Right now,
you're getting the 95% part of it."</TE>
<TE>   During the pre-battle monotony, Soviet reenactor Theresa Mekker,
47, lighted up a Russian-made Prima cigarette. The cigarette was a
nice authentic touch, but didn't compare with her weapon--a
Russian-made Tokarev SVT 40 with sniper scope. Total cost? About
$1,500.</TE>
<TE>   Does she feel out of place as one of the few women participating?</TE>
<TE>   "Are you kidding?" said Mekker, who works as a car mechanic in
Santa Barbara. "I kick the guys' butts."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the battle starts. The night crackles with gunfire, which
is drowned out only occasionally when the T-34 tank cannon roars,
billowing smoke that nearly blankets the bluff top. For almost the
first 20 minutes of the half-hour battle, few soldiers fall over
dead.</TE>
<TE>   "If you get killed early," said one veteran reenactor, "you just
have to lay there. It's too cold tonight for that."</TE>
<TE>   War reenacting is hell.</TE>
<TE>   But, finally, when the Russians launch their counterattack and
overrun the German position, soldiers start dropping. Then the
Russian soldiers capture a German officer. (Moments earlier, another
German officer was shot, turned a somersault and, apparently,
expired.) The prisoner is hauled in front of a firing squad and given
his last cigarette. The Russian squad takes aim. "Deutschland uber
alles!" the prisoner defiantly cries as he collapses in a hail of
blanks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the mock cruelty, the weekend was not without its
sensitive side. A seminar intended to promote the one-sixth
hobby--called this by purists who collect action figures roughly
one-sixth the size of a real soldier, as opposed to the many other
sizes available--quickly took on the air of a support group.</TE>
<TE>   James DeSimone, who has written four books about G.I. Joe
collecting and has sponsored more than 60 collectibles shows, led the
group, which numbered only seven at its high-water mark. The stocky
45-year-old Brooklyn native shared the roots of his passion for his
beloved dolls.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to sleep with my G.I. Joes," confided DeSimone, who today
lets his toy collection rest in a specially built two-story garage.
"My father was in jail and I didn't see him much. I don't know if
G.I. Joe was my father as a kid, but he was certainly a friend."</TE>
<TE>   But there was anger too, particularly at Hasbro, which DeSimone
and others say no longer makes G.I. Joe with the exacting standards
it once did. In fact, the collectors assert, foreign competitors now
make better-quality action figures. "They have dragged my G.I. Joe
through the mud," said DeSimone. "I could just cry over this."</TE>
<TE>   And there was regret.</TE>
<TE>   "Collecting G.I. Joes can be like a drug," said DeSimone, who once
cut down on expenses so much he lived in a garage with no running
water to support his doll-buying habit. "I've seen guys lose their
cars, their houses, their wives. Everything over G.I. Joe."</TE>
<TE>   But mostly, for DeSimone, there was pride. Pride over G.I. Joe and
his amazing collection of hundreds, if not thousands. He doesn't keep
count anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "People see my toy collection and they are in awe. It brings back
happy memories for them and me. I tell you, I get the chills just
thinking about it--the good feeling they get from seeing my toy
collection."</TE>

<DH>Using computer technology, the Southern California firm
CTEK gives shape to visionary projects ranging from science-fiction
vehicles to glittering glass walls.</DH>

<LD>In less than five years, Tustin-based CTEK has become known for
fabricating innovative products that include one-of-a-kind futuristic
cars for the entertainment industry, unusually contoured glass panels
for the likes of Frank Gehry and artworks for major artists such as
Robert Graham and Liz Larner. The company also designs and produces
its own projects, among them the new Ford Thunderbird.</LD>
<LD>   "We started in 1997 with five people making automotive clay
models. Our idea was to find new solutions through existing
technology. Now, with 50 people working here, we're a pretty diverse
group of designers, engineers, technicians and fabricators," says
Eric Adickes, president of CTEK.</LD>
<LD>   CTEK--the name is derived from Creative Technologies--works in a
variety of ways. Sometimes the company both designs and fabricates a
project, as in the Ford Thunderbird body kit and the new Breez system
of contoured safety glass panels for architects; sometimes people
come to CTEK with a plan or model and the firm creates it.</LD>
<TE>   The Breez system glass panels, which architects can fit together
to create walls, are among CTEK's most recent designs. The firm
started producing them after it created contoured glass for Gehry's
glass draperies in the Conde Nast dining room in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unlimited what we can do here," says Javier Valdivieso,
executive vice president. "We're like a hobby shop in a way. We're
the missing link for a lot of designers because many designs cannot
be executed without knowledge of technology. Most of the things we do
have never been done before."</TE>
<TE>   CTEK technicians begin with a clay model, running a 3-D laser
scanner over it to transmit the shape into a computer. "Once we have
that information, we dump that into a machine that prints the
specifications out," says Valdivieso. With the resulting data, a
full-scale cast is molded from rigid foam. The foam is then covered
with clay to create a hard surface. For some larger works, the firm
uses aerospace metal tooling to strengthen the form. The exterior of
the piece can be finished in any number of ways, using bronze, paint
or another surface material.</TE>
<TE>   L.A.-based artist Robert Graham created a small-scale model of the
statue of Mary for the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los
Angeles, from which CTEK fabricated the 8-foot-high statue as well as
small souvenirs that are exact replicas. The firm also fabricated
Graham's 30-foot-high bronze doors, which will stand at the entrance
to the new cathedral, and his design for the Franklin Delano
Roosevelt monument now in Washington, D.C. CTEK's customers range
from high-culture to populist: The company often works for Disney
Studios using similar techniques, enlarging Disney characters to as
much as 40 feet high for theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   In one section of the 24,000-square-foot CTEK facility, work
continues on an energy-efficient motorcycle, the "c2c" (coast to
coast) project designed by Doug Malewicki, Len Stobar, Bob Schureman
and Joe Valencic, all on the faculty at Art Center College of Design
in Pasadena. This summer, the three-wheeled two-seater--looking like
a small, low-flying jet plane--will drive from Long Beach to New York
City on 24 gallons of gas at speeds up to 75 miles per hour. CTEK is
one of the sponsors of the prototype.</TE>
<TE>   The firm also fabricated two molds of the futuristic cars for
Steven Spielberg's science-fiction movie "Minority Report," starring
Tom Cruise, due in theaters this summer. "They gave us a computer
design, and we turned it into a drivable unit," says Valdivieso. By
using the computer, CTEK can make in three months what would take six
to eight months with any other technique, Valdivieso says. "And the
accuracy is perfect," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   CTEK is especially proud of its work in laminated safety glass,
including the large glass boulders that light up in front of the
recently renovated Cinerama Dome theater on Sunset Boulevard, which
the firm fabricated for Gensler Architects. It also created curved
14-foot-high glass walls for the new Shell Museum in the Netherlands
and curving glass for the handrails of a spiral staircase in a Corona
del Mar home.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of these projects are very challenging," says Valdivieso,
"so we have to rethink existing technology, tweaking it and combining
it with our craftsmanship to create the designs. Every project is
different, but that's what we all like about working here."</TE>
<TE>   CTEK is on the Internet at www.ctek-on-line.com. For more

<LD>POSSESSING GENIUS</LD>
<LD>   The Bizarre Odyssey of</LD>
<LD>   Einstein's Brain</LD>
<TE>   By Carolyn Abraham</TE>
<TE>   St. Martin's Press</TE>
<TE>   288 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   When Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955, his body was
cremated, but not before parts of him were removed for questionable
safekeeping. His eyeballs ended up with an ophthalmologist friend,
who stored them in a safety deposit box at a New Jersey bank. And
Einstein's brain was claimed by an itinerant, elusive man named
Thomas Harvey, who decided to take first and seek permission later.</TE>
<TE>   The story of the Nobel laureate's precious brain--which took on a
life of its own long after Einstein's death--is the focus of
"Possessing Genius," the compelling first book by Canadian science
journalist Carolyn Abraham. Over the decades, numerous reporters
delved, mostly in vain, into the postmortem whereabouts of Einstein's
gray matter. Two years ago, journalist Michael Paterniti published
the weird and entertaining "Driving Mr. Albert" (since optioned for
film), in which he chronicles his cross-country road trip with
Harvey. Stored in the trunk of their rental car are pieces of
Einstein's brain, jiggling around inside an alcohol-filled Tupperware
container.</TE>
<TE>   "Possessing Genius," which weaves a mini-biography of Einstein's
life into the narrative, distinguishes itself by being the first
comprehensive history of the brain's haphazard travels for the last
five decades. Although some information overlaps with Paterniti's
book, Abraham's well-researched account is also worth reading and
serves as a more substantial companion to the largely anecdotal
"Driving Mr. Albert."</TE>
<TE>   A simple version of what happened to Einstein's brain goes like
this: In 1955, Harvey was the chief pathologist at Princeton
Hospital, where Einstein died at 76. Harvey handled the autopsy,
extracted Einstein's brain and kept it for more than 40 years. "Did
he take the brain for science," Abraham writes, "or as a souvenir?"
The answer is an enduring mystery. Harvey hoarded his prize but never
exploited it for money or fame.</TE>
<TE>   Although he is portrayed as well-meaning, Harvey also seems
maddeningly inept, secretive, disorganized and indecisive. He saw
himself as the brain's guardian, but he also hoped to dissect and
study it. He wanted to determine whether size really did matter--if
having a bigger brain had any relation to a person's intelligence.
Although he intended to analyze the brain's physiology and publish
his findings in a scientific journal, he never quite got his act
together.</TE>
<TE>   "Possessing Genius" unfolds with the kind of unsparing
detail--precise, clinical, anatomical--that makes you want to skip
ahead but then stops you in your tracks with vivid passages that
remind readers why we can't all go to medical school. "Tilting
Einstein's head left," Abraham writes of the autopsy, "[Harvey]
jabbed first behind the ear, pulling his blade down the side of the
neck, over the clavicle and curving inward beneath the collarbone ...
he drew the scalpel down again, across the chest, across the abdomen,
pasty, weathered skin giving like cold butter to the groin, until he
had carved a Y shape into the torso of the corpse."</TE>
<TE>   It is shocking to discover that the mind of the man who worked out
the theory of relativity could be handled with such poor, sloppy
supervision. Yet Abraham effectively explains the chaos that erupted
after Einstein's death. (She interviewed many of the key figures,
including Harvey, and was given access to private letters, records
and documents.) She describes the intense media attention on
Einstein's death and the angry turf wars between Princeton Hospital
and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine; as well as the tensions
between Einstein's relatives and the estate's executor, who would
insist until the day he died, at 94, that Harvey fully explain his
actions.</TE>
<TE>   The dilemma was that no one had told Harvey that he couldn't take
the brain--and no one had ever given him permission to take it. It's
baffling that neither the family nor the executor pressed Harvey to
relinquish the brain, and he had publicly claimed that he had the
family's consent to do what he'd done. What mattered most to the
relatives was that the issue remain private, and in that regard
Harvey's custody satisfied them. They were protective of Einstein's
legacy, which might explain why they never pressured Harvey with
legal proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   The story Abraham tells is so engaging that the brain becomes an
intriguing character. Before being carved into pieces, Einstein's
brain served as a still-life for a portrait, as commissioned by
Harvey. Through the years, the brain would accompany Harvey through
different states, various jobs and three failed marriages. It was
analyzed by neuroscientists and subjected to controversial studies.
To this day, debates persist about how the brain has been used by the
scientific community and about the restricted access to it.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey was at last relieved of his career-bungling burden in 1996,
at the age of 84. Through the years, small pieces of the brain had
ended up with different researchers, but ultimately Harvey returned
what was left to Princeton Hospital, where he had completed the
infamous autopsy four decades earlier. "I really wanted to get out
from under all that responsibility," Harvey says, "but I have no
regret about keeping it this long, you know, before it is completely
studied. There is still lots to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Abraham proves a conscientious and thorough reporter, refusing to
cast Harvey as an absent-minded professor, a noble custodian or a
mere thief. She presents the messy details as they are, and perhaps
with too much distance. What's missing in this otherwise fine book
are not the facts, but an interpretation of the facts. Although it's
no surprise that Harvey can't explain his often bewildering behavior,
it's disappointing that the author doesn't add her insight. Abraham
is a careful, steady guide through this strange odyssey, but don't
expect to have all your questions answered at the end of the tour.</TE>

<LD>California seldom gets April showers, but there is no shortage of
spring flowers. Take time to savor the garden in its full spring
glory.</LD>
<LD>   If you want to work, there's still time to plant just about
anything, from summer's petunias to a new lawn.</LD>
<LD>   With ample water, new plants will be established before the heat
of summer arrives.</LD>
<TE>   Roses bloom early in the month. As these blossoms fade, prune
flowering branches so only two "eyes," or buds, remain on the branch
that has flowered, to make sure that the next round of bloom comes on
sturdy stems.</TE>
<TE>   Fertilize after each round of bloom, and water well.</TE>
<TE>   Some rose experts put Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate, available at
drugstores) around the bases of roses after this first flush of
flowers to encourage new canes.</TE>
<TE>   Sprinkle one cup around each bush and water in.</TE>
<TE>   Now through May is the best time to plant citrus.</TE>
<TE>   Make sure to water several times each week for the first month so
they don't dry out.</TE>

<LD>   Next time you are going to share a snack with a friend, try this
out. Find a snack food that comes in small, equal pieces. Count out
the snacks before your friend arrives, making two piles with the same
amount of snacks in each.</LD>
<LD>   Now arrange one pile of snacks so they are close together. Take
the other pile and spread the snacks out over a larger area. Ask your
friend to choose one. Most kids choose the snacks that are spread
over a larger area, thinking they are getting more.</LD>
<TE>   You, of course, know that each pile contains exactly the same
number of snacks. You have just demonstrated something called
"conservation of number."</TE>
<TE>   Conservation of number is an important mathematical principle. It
means that the number of objects (or their length or mass) doesn't
change when the objects are moved, arranged differently or hidden.</TE>
<TE>   Here's another one for you to try. Get some modeling dough or
clay. Divide it into two equal balls. Keep one ball in its round
shape, and make the other into a completely different shape. Ask a
friend to tell you which sculpture has more clay in it. After your
friend has answered, show him or her that the two balls are equal in
size. In this case, you have demonstrated "conservation of mass."</TE>
<TE>   To learn more, join the Math Monsters as they tackle problems
using conservation of number, length and mass. See what happens when
they try to use objects that are the same but look different. The
program airs on KLCS-TV Mondays at 1:15 p.m. and Fridays at 8:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The Learning Link was provided by KLCS-TV, a noncommercial
educational public television station licensed to the Los Angeles
Unified School District. It is broadcast over the air on Channel 58
and is also available through most cable companies and selected
satellite television systems.</TE>

<HD>When a Neutra Landmark Becomes a Tear-Down</HD>
<DH>Rancho Mirage home built in 1963 is sold for $2.45 million.
Preservation is hinted at, then wrecking ball quickly falls.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a time when the revival of interest in Modernist architecture is
at a historic high, a Rancho Mirage house considered a masterwork of
the Modernist architect Richard Neutra was torn down late last month.
Built in 1963, it had been considered a landmark in the Palm Springs
area as a showcase for the owner's Modern art collection and as an
example of the livability of Neutra's simple, sensitive designs.</LD>
<LD>   Widely written about and known as the Maslon House, for the late
Minneapolis lawyer Samuel Maslon and his wife, Luella, who
commissioned it as a second home, the residence was put up for sale
in the wake of Luella Maslon's death in July. The house sold for
$2.45 million and closed escrow Feb. 28 after spending less than a
month on the market.</LD>
<LD>   Architecture aficionados and preservationists kept a close eye on
this unique property when the Maslon heirs listed the house for sale.
Fear-filled rumors circulated early on that potential buyers might
alter or demolish the 5,000-square-foot, six-bedroom house, built on
1.3 acres in the Tamarisk Country Club. But those anxieties were
allayed when the selling agent, Deidre Coit of Fred Sands Canavan
Coit Real Estate in Palm Desert, said the new owner, Richard J.
Rotenberg of Hopkins, Minn., was thinking of restoring it.
Rotenberg's father was a partner in Samuel Maslon's law firm.</LD>
<TE>   Within a month after escrow closed, the house was flattened. Why
this happened remains a mystery. The Rotenbergs have not responded to
requests for comment, and the listing agent, Sotheby's International
Real Estate, says it cannot say. Jim Maslon, son of the original
owners and whose wife, Laura, is Sotheby's director of public
relations in Los Angeles, said, "We were so disappointed. That would
never have been our desire."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the motives, reaction from the architecture and
preservation communities has been heated.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm continually amazed at how disposable our disposable culture
is," says Barbara Mac Lamprecht, author of "Neutra: Complete Works"
(Taschen, 2000). "This residential palazzo of art embodied
sophisticated abstractions about positive and negative space in a
structure that was equally sophisticated in construction. I'm sure it
wasn't easy to demolish, at least I hope so."</TE>
<TE>   Janice Lyle, executive director of the Palm Springs Desert Museum,
which included the house on a sold-out tour of Palm Beach Modernist
landmarks last year, says museum officials were shocked to hear the
Maslon house was gone. "This house was a local landmark and a
masterpiece of architecture in the desert. We had had little concern
initially because we were told that the new owners were aware of the
architectural importance of the house. And this house was in great
condition and had never been changed or modified."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Neutra was born in Vienna in 1892, immigrated to the
United States in 1923 and died in 1970. He was based in L.A. from
1926 until his death, and his first major commission, the Lovell
Health House in Los Feliz (1929), gained worldwide recognition in
1932 when it was included in "Modern Architecture-International
Exhibition," the first architecture show at the Museum of Modern Art
in New York. Among Neutra's strengths was his ability to extend
architectural space into the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   The Maslons' U-shaped, flat-roofed house was built to fit the
landscape, allowing for a vista from the living room and master
bedroom across the green oasis of the golf course to the mountains
beyond. And it did so perfectly, says Leo Marmol, whose firm Marmol
Radziner+Associates in Santa Monica restored the nearby
Neutra-designed Kaufmann House in Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Adele Cygelman features the house prominently in her book, "Palm
Springs Modern" (Rizzoli, 1999), which quotes Luella Maslon as saying
that she and her husband wanted a house with immediate access to the
pool, an indoor barbecue and as much natural and recessed light as
possible for their paintings. Cygelman writes: "Outside the living
room and den, the overhang created a deep corner pocket that
functioned as an outdoor living area."</TE>
<TE>   Coit says that before the house was torn down she had believed the
Rotenbergs were thinking of restoring it because they asked for books
on Neutra, were aware of the house's importance and requested
information about local restoration firms. She says she was not told
of their plans to tear down the house and was surprised to find the
house gone.</TE>
<TE>   "I was showing the house to some other potential buyers in case
there was a problem with escrow when I drove up and found the house
being destroyed. I was devastated when I saw it almost gone," she
says. "The Maslon heirs were keen on finding a buyer who would
appreciate the house. And the land alone wasn't worth what the
Rotenbergs paid for it."</TE>
<TE>   Only two Neutra-designed houses remain in the desert, the 1946
Kaufmann House and the 1937 Grace Miller House in Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Moruzzi, chairman of the Palm Springs Modern Committee, a
volunteer organization dedicated to promoting and maintaining
Modernist architecture in the Palm Springs area, says the Rotenbergs
paid a premium for the property because of the house's architectural
importance. Nevertheless, getting a demolition permit is easy in
Rancho Mirage; after an asbestos review, a permit can be issued over
the counter. The house had not been designated a historic landmark.
The lack of review, says Ken Bernstein, director of preservation
issues for the Los Angeles Conservancy, "shows an appalling
misunderstanding of the California Environmental Quality Act. Many
local governments have the misconception that if a building is not
officially designated a local landmark it does not need to be
considered as a potential historic building. Under CEQA, a city has
an obligation to decide if a building is significant or not. You
cannot destroy historical properties without a review."</TE>
<TE>   But, Bernstein said, "that did not happen in this case." CEQA is a
self-enforcing statute, and its power comes from the public, through
litigation or the threat of litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "For the museum it's a tremendous loss, since the Maslons
supported the museum for over 30 years and in the mid-'70s and '80s
were a major force in the contemporary arts community," Lyle said. So
major, in fact, that their art collection, to be auctioned by
Sotheby's in May, is expected to bring up to $33 million.</TE>
<TE>   "What we lost was precious," says architect Marmol. "The
architecture supported the Maslons' art and lifestyle. It was very
different from the other two Neutra houses in the desert, although
every nook and cranny showed [Neutra's] passion for human things.
It's not the raw materials. It's the histories, stories, human
activities and all they represented. Houses like these aren't valued
as relics. Instead they show who we are and where we come from."</TE>

<LD>Barry ran to the garage, where he found a box full of enormous pieces
of folded-over cardboard, each with a golden tassel hanging from a
hole punched through the fold. He ran back into the kitchen with one
of them and showed it to his friends.</LD>
<LD>   "What is it?" Kyle asked.</LD>
<LD>   Barry held it up. On the front was a single word in swirly gold
letters.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a menu from Gusto, my parents' restaurant. Each dish is
described. Maybe Ral can find something he likes here." He put the
menu in front of Ral.</TE>
<TE>   Ral read the menu eagerly. "Hmm," he said. "Chicken Marsala. That
sounds good. And this one--steak Diane."</TE>
<TE>   "I can get you the recipe for anything on the menu you want,"
Barry said proudly.</TE>
<TE>   Ral continued reading the menu. "Unfortunately, I've seen all of
this before," he said. "It's all in the official Thousand Galaxies
Cookbook. For instance, in my world, chicken Marsala is called
evots."</TE>
<TE>   "You would eat something called evots?" Kyle asked with amazement.</TE>
<TE>   "Indeed we would. And something called kruchseh, too."</TE>
<TE>   Gloom gathered around Ral as he read the rest of the menu. "Look
at me," he cried at last. "Look at me! You're looking at a person who
will be a third assistant chef forever!"</TE>
<TE>   Barry, Kyle and Alexis looked at Ral. They'd gotten used to his
vertical mouth. He seemed less like an alien and more like just a
regular person in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Sherlock sat on the floor near him and laid his head on Ral's
foot. They seemed to be beaten.</TE>
<TE>   But Barry refused to admit defeat. He searched through the
refrigerator and rummaged through the cupboards, hoping to see
something that would suggest a solution to Ral's problem. And
something did!</TE>
<TE>   "Quick!" he cried. "Out of the kitchen. I have work to do!"</TE>
<TE>   Friday: Will Barry come up with the perfect food?</TE>

eats. His books and stories always contain food jokes. This story

<DL></DL>
<LD>Celine Dion's dramatic return to the top of the nation's album sales
chart after a two-year break from the pop scene was short-lived
because of a spectacular first-week showing by R&amp;B newcomer Ashanti.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to her own hit single "Foolish" and guest roles on other
hits, the 21-year-old New Yorker built enough fan interest for her
self-titled debut album to sell nearly 503,000 copies in its first
week in stores.</LD>
<LD>   That's the second-highest first-week sales total this year, behind
the 527,000 registered two weeks ago by Dion's "A New Day Has Come."
Dion's album fell to second this week with sales of 263,000.</LD>
<TE>   Besides "Foolish," Ashanti has been featured in recent weeks on
two other top 10 radio airplay singles: "What's Luv?" with Fat Joe
and "Always on Time" with Ja Rule.</TE>
<TE>   In another strong debut, Tweet's "Southern Hummingbird" entered
the charts at No. 3 with sales of 195,000. The 29-year-old R&amp;B
singer, based in Atlanta, has one of the season's most celebrated
singles in "Oops (Oh My)."</TE>
<TE>   The other positions in the top 10 this week are claimed, in order,
by Vol. 9 of the "Now That's What I Call Music" compilation series,
the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack, the Jay-Z and R. Kelly
collaboration on "The Best of Both Worlds," Avant, "The Scorpion
King" soundtrack, Ludacris and Pink.</TE>
<TE>   The best-selling single remains 'N Sync's pairing with Nelly on
"Girlfriend."</TE>

<TE>   When the Perm State Ballet (Russia's third-largest company) danced
locally for the first time two years ago, The Times noted the
"obvious budget limitations" of the tour repertory. "But they work
their hearts out," the review concluded, and "the style is elegant
and unified." For 2002, the company is bringing two full-length
ballets set to music by Prokofiev: Nikolai Boyarchikov's "Romeo and
Juliet" and Oleg Vinogradov's "Cinderella." Balletomanes will recall
that the Kirov Ballet had been scheduled to dance the Vinogradov
"Cinderella" in Costa Mesa in 1995, but tour difficulties led to a
cancellation of that engagement. Now we can see what we missed--and
hear it too, for the 50-member company orchestra is in the pit to
guarantee that Prokofiev is spared any unwanted perm-mutations.</TE>
<TE>   Perm State Ballet, Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, 12700
Center Court Drive, Cerritos. Friday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m.
("Romeo and Juliet"); Saturday, 2 and 8 p.m. ("Cinderella"). $37 to

<TE>   2002 has already been busy for jazz singer Dianne Reeves. In
February, she won a Grammy for her CD "The Calling: Celebrating Sarah
Vaughan." In March, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn. announced her
appointment to a new post, creative chair for jazz. She'll advise the
orchestra on jazz programming for the 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons.
Southland jazz buffs have two chances to hear Reeves this weekend.</TE>

<TE>   Vincent (Aurelien Recoing) takes long drives through the French
countryside. He also sleeps in his car, stays away from home for days
at a time, and spins a detailed web of deceit to hide his unemployed
status from his family in the psychological drama "Time Out"
("L'Emploi du Temps"). Director Laurent Cantet, who won critical
acclaim for his debut feature "Human Resources," examines the
fleeting freedom Vincent feels before gradually slipping into a
tightening existential and practical conundrum.</TE>
<TE>   "Time Out" ("L'Emploi du Temps"), rated PG-13 for sensuality,
opens Friday at Laemmle's Music Hall, Beverly Hills; Laemmle's
Playhouse 7, Pasadena; Laemmle's Fallbrook 7, West Hills; and

<TE>   Martin Scorsese's 1978 documentary "The Last Waltz," possibly the
greatest rock concert film ever made, memorably captures the farewell
concert of the Band at San Francisco's Winterland Theatre. Band
guitarist Robbie Robertson, pianist Richard Manuel, drummer Levon
Helm, organist Garth Hudson and bassist Rick Danko were joined on
Thanksgiving in 1976 by a litany of music greats for a show produced
by famed Bay Area promoter Bill Graham. Bob Dylan and Ronnie Hawkins,
Neil Young, Eric Clapton, Joni Mitchell, Neil Diamond, Van Morrison,
Muddy Waters, Emmylou Harris, Stephen Stills, Ringo Starr, Dr. John
and Paul Butterfield were among the luminaries to grace the
Winterland stage that night helping to create rock 'n' roll history.</TE>
<TE>   "The Last Waltz," rated PG, opens Friday at Pacific's ArcLight 14,
6360 W. Sunset Blvd., Hollywood; Mann's Criterion 6, 1313 Third
Street Promenade, Santa Monica; and Edwards' University 6, 4245
Campus Drive, Irvine.</TE>

<TE>   Nearby Palm Springs is chic again, thanks in part to its dazzling
modernist architecture: retro hotels and a slew of mid-century homes
by architects such as John Lautner, Richard Neutra and Albert Frey.
Following through on current interest in the era's design, the Palm
Springs Desert Museum is hosting the daylong symposium and home tour
"Modernist Residential Architecture in Palm Springs." The day begins
at the museum with talks by Brooke Hodge, curator of architecture at
the Museum of Contemporary Art, and Michael Webb, author of
"Modernism Revisited." A motor-coach tour will follow, stopping at
the Kaufmann House, designed by Neutra; the Kaplan House, designed by
Conrad Buff and Donald Hensman; the Kirk Douglas House, designed by
Donald Wexler; and the Sanders House, designed by E. Stewart
Williams. Another classic, Neutra's Maslon house near Palm Springs,
was recently demolished by new owners. The lesson: see them while you
can.</TE>

<AU>JULIA GAYNOR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sunshine, the surly and careworn barmaid at Smog Cutter, brays above
the drunken din, "Shawn and Christ, get over here. You're up." The
questionably named Sunshine doubles as a karaoke hostess when she's
not razzing the regulars at this watering hole-cum-karaoke bar on a
sketchy stretch of Virgil Avenue south of Los Feliz. It's Sunday
night's usual mix of slouchy Silver Lake boys and girls in their 20s
mingling with the regulars--Vietnam vets and serious drinkers--most
signing up to sing.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's next, um, performers (actually named Shawn and Chris)
sit at their bar stools, microphones in hand. In the best karaoke
tradition, they're ready to stumble, smirk and sing their way through
David Bowie's "Under Pressure," a rendition that barely resembles
anything Bowie had in mind. But this crowd doesn't care--Shawn, Chris
and everyone else in sight is having a great time.</LD>
<TE>   Smog Cutter is far from unusual in a metropolis dense with karaoke
bars. Yes, other cities have karaoke, but in no other major urban
center is it as prevalent, as popular, as hip. Since its American
debut right here in Los Angeles 20 years ago, karaoke has morphed
into this decade's answer to happy hour. From Koreatown to the
Westside, from uber-trendy Moomba in West Hollywood to the
super-seedy Smog Cutter, karaoke transcends social strata, bringing
enough warmth to the bar scene to melt the frost off a chilled
martini glass. The club scene can be an ugly place, filled with
cliques of beautiful people glaring at one another. Karaoke cuts
through that. And in this town, where image often triumphs over
anything else, karaoke's humanizing qualities might just be downright
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. offers a brand of karaoke to cater to almost every
crowd--young and cutting-edge, middle-aged and wistful.</TE>
<TE>   Some places, such as the Brass Monkey in Koreatown, Dimples in
Burbank and many primarily Asian venues have karaoke every night.
Others, such as Barney's Beanery on Santa Monica Boulevard, Zen in
Silver Lake and Liquid Kitty on the Westside dedicate just one or two
nights a week to the craze. But more nightspots are adopting the
Japanese import, and more people are discovering karaoke's
therapeutic thrill of letting off some steam.</TE>
<TE>   It's a simple formula: Take a bar, add karaoke, and walls come
down, image maintenance is momentarily forgotten, stress is relieved,
strangers bond as they prepare to rip through an emotional ballad or
simply share the joy of singing along to a familiar song with an
entire roomful of strangers.</TE>
<TE>   Smog Cutter, a long, small hole in the wall, is one of L.A.'s more
visceral karaoke scenes. There's no stage here. You just stand in the
middle of the room, or sit at your stool, and sing a song from the
big book after slipping the hostess a piece of paper with your name,
the song title and its number, and maybe a small tip as a gesture,
but not an obligation.</TE>
<TE>   Most karaoke bars show the song lyrics on large TV screens, but
Smog Cutter includes schmaltzy videos that usually have no relevance
to the song--blowsy blonds in sheer shirts and leggings pouting in
front of a mirror to the tune of, say, Sinatra's "My Way."</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that there are actually two Chrises at Smog Cutter
this evening--one African American Chris and one blond-haired,
blue-eyed Chris. Sunshine wastes no time in pointing this out,
proving that Smog Cutter is no palace of political correctness.</TE>
<TE>   "Chocolate and Vanilla Chris, come up here," she wails. She then
coerces the Chrises to sing an impromptu rendition of "Ebony and
Ivory." Genius.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn McDougal, friend of one of the Chrises, says, "People come
here to get out of their boxes. It's a little community that's
created because of a sense of freedom and fun."</TE>
<TE>   This sense-of-community phrase is thrown around a lot at karaoke
bars. Dr. Choi Choi, an L.A.-based psychiatrist, is not surprised.
"There's a community feeling created by karaoke that a lot of
American bars, especially ones in L.A., lack," Choi says. "In Europe,
the pubs have that community feeling naturally. Here, many bars are
filled with TV screens and people don't always talk to one another."</TE>
<TE>   For Stephen Ingle, 33, an independent filmmaker who lives in the
Hollywood Hills, karaoke bars are an alternative to "snooty,
overpriced places where you have to be on a list or stand in the line
of shame waiting to get in."</TE>
<TE>   The paradox, of course, is in such an image-conscious town, why
are so many people prepared to make fools of themselves? The
entertainment industry has given L.A. a rich talent pool, so at least
theoretically there are fewer fools ... well, singing fools at least.
On any given night behind the microphone, four out of every five
singers can at least carry a tune. At most bars, professional singers
rub shoulders with those whose previous best performances have been
in the car or the shower. That its crowds embrace the bad as
enthusiastically as the good is one of karaoke's enduring appeals.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone forgets about the cool image they have to portray at
other clubs," says Darren Cohen, 28, a real estate analyst from West
Hollywood. "It breaks everyone down to their basic elements and they
can relate as human beings."</TE>
<TE>   From Cameron Diaz in "My Best Friend's Wedding" to Andy Garcia in
"Black Rain" and, of course, Gwyneth Paltrow and Huey Lewis in
"Duets," movies were good to karaoke in the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Karaoke has been a business here since 1983, when Santa
Monica-based Sing Young began importing home machines to the U.S. But
it didn't really take off until machines migrated to bars. Even now,
the home machines are "not as popular as going out," says McCoy Mao,
general manager of Sing Young, still a top L.A. distributor.</TE>
<TE>   Sing Young may have been the first to import the machines, but
Dimples, a Burbank karaoke institution, claims to be the first
karaoke bar in America. The brainchild of owner Sal Ferraro, it began
with an eight-track "singing machine" and sheets of song lyrics, in
1982. With its proximity to Warner Bros., NBC and Universal, Dimples
seems to attract more than a few aspiring actors and fallen stars.
But it's the super-surreal perks that make Dimples worth a visit: an
applause machine and an enormous video screen reflecting the singer's
image--very humbling if you've been staring too long at your
airbrushed head shot.</TE>
<TE>   Also, there are props. Cowboy hats for belting out "Rocky Mountain
High," a Mexican sombrero for more fiery numbers, a small guitar for
those who want to feel like Elvis. And for first-time singers,
there's an audiocassette of their performance--a very tinny
recording, but a great gimmick.</TE>
<TE>   The Farmers Market weekly karaoke night, another local
institution, is a much more stripped-down version than at Dimples. No
gimmicks, no props, just really great singers, many in their 50s, 60s
and up. On this night, Diana, a sixtysomething woman in a plastic
silver dress with a zipper up the front and mesh sleeves, sings the
swing song "Jump Jive and Wail." A man in his 50s blasts out a
version of "I Feel Good" that's as good as the original and then
finishes with a full split on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   There are some younger people, but they watch. Liz Hackett, a
27-year-old writer from Hollywood, says, "There's a slightly more
poignant quality here than at other karaoke places. The younger
people come here for the same reason they go to the Kibitz Room at
Canter's--for the kitsch value."</TE>
<TE>   The Asian venues--in Koreatown, Little Tokyo and Chinatown--have
long favored the private karaoke experience as opposed to the
Americanized barroom rousing sing-along. I headed out with five
friends to Vaskia in Koreatown, where we found a mix of clientele
that made it clear the karaoke scene there is hardly a secret
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Vaskia has about 20 private rooms (in Korean they're called
no-rae-bangs, which translates as "singing rooms"). Ours is cozy and
intimate, just enough room for six to share the zebra-print velvet
couches.</TE>
<TE>   There's a huge songbook, with only a few pages of English songs.
Luckily, they're classics, and after warming up with some Korean
liquor called soju, we're ready.</TE>
<TE>   There's no host here, just an automated machine and a remote
control. After each person sings, the karaoke machine judges your
performance, giving scores that seem to range from 82 to 100, a nice
touch for those who crave instant gratification. I never thought six
people singing in a room could be so much fun.</TE>
<TE>   In West L.A., there is a growing enclave, with three
Japanese-style karaoke studios on the corner of Sawtelle and Olympic
boulevards. It's what Ralph Koyamo, owner of Karaoke Bleu, calls
"Little Tokyo of the Westside." To the Japanese, karaoke is "what
baseball and apple pie are to Americans," according to Koyamo.
Karaoke Bleu is the most Westernized of the lot, he says, a bar
rather than private rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Karaoke isn't the focus of attention here. People chat through
performances, and after you sing, there's no cheering audience. But
as Antonia Roeller, 23, a UCLA film student points out, "this is the
most authentic experience of being a lounge singer, because people
carry on drinking and talking, totally oblivious to the fact that
you're singing."</TE>
<TE>   In L.A., even the stars crave a moment under the karaoke
spotlight. Actually, stars and star makers--the publicists,
producers, agents, lawyers, development execs, makeup artists,
stylists.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Parker is a karaoke hostess, a karaoke diva, in fact, who,
along with her partner Johnny See, caters to this particular niche.
Their Los Angeles-based company, JVS, provides karaoke hosting
services to several bars around town, including Dublin's on the
Sunset Strip, Liquid Kitty, Jillian's at Universal CityWalk, Moomba
and, until recently, J. Sloan's on Melrose Avenue. Parker also does
private parties--Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt have used her
services, as did GQ magazine for its recent party at the Sunset Room.</TE>
<TE>   But, Parker says, it was her stint at Miyagi's, that West
Hollywood circus on the Sunset Strip, that made her realize karaoke
was alive and well in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything like it. Jamie Foxx was there all the
time. Chris Tucker, John Popper from Blues Traveler, Christina
Aguilera, Britney Spears, 'N Sync, the Backstreet Boys. Sometimes
they'd sing off each other." Miyagi's, which took a 10-month hiatus
from the karaoke carnival, expects to start up again later this
month.</TE>
<TE>   But it's at the Brass Monkey where you'll find all of the
different karaoke scenes in L.A. converging. Located in Koreatown,
it's the epitome of an eclectic crowd. Eastside locals mix with camp
drag queens, who share microphones with TV stars, while Asian
American torch singers slap the backs of African American soul
singers. The Brass Monkey truly is a karaoke melting pot.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't book a table in advance and arrive by 9 p.m., you
probably won't be able to sit in the cozy, nonglitzy wood-paneled
cavern. If you don't arrive by 10, you probably won't be able to
sing. But by that time of night, it's not really about the singing,
it's about the energy, an infectious feverish party-like buzz you
can't escape.</TE>
<TE>   On this Friday night, there are more than a few familiar faces.
Some cast members from the WB's "Angel" have come to let off steam,
including J. August Richards, who nails a rousing version of 'N
Sync's "Bye Bye Bye." The high point though, is when Marcella
Detroit, formerly of the band Shakespeare's Sister, treats the room
to her hit song "Stay."</TE>
<TE>   There's also the Brass Monkey's own celebrity/godfather,
74-year-old Art Himmel, who delivers spine-trembling operatic
renditions of Sinatra's "My Way." He's a fixture here and can often
be seen swanning about, hugging and kissing pretty young things,
sitting at tables of twentysomethings.</TE>
<TE>   By midnight, it doesn't matter who you are or what you sound like.
Sleek, long-legged model-actress look-alikes bump and grind against
heavyset college girls, buff Hollywood boys, middle-aged co-workers,
all screaming and dancing along to Sister Sledge's "We Are Family."
This sort of energy, found in varying intensities around the city,
suggests karaoke not only is thriving, but it also hasn't peaked.
Brass Monkey's weekend host Chris Whitt, for one, is convinced
karaoke is only getting more popular. There are new karaoke nights
launching each month and new venues opening regularly.</TE>
<TE>   One of those is Boardwalk 11, on the Westside, in what was
formerly Stevie Joe's Supper Club. The owners, Stephen and Hirome
Spears, come with something of a karaoke pedigree--Spears is the son
of Brass Monkey owner Alan Spears. It's too soon to tell if Boardwalk
11 will have the same magic, but Martin Moakler, 26, an actor from
Hollywood who loves the Brass Monkey, was here to check it out. "I
sang a few slow songs.... I did a few guilty-pleasure numbers, even
some show tunes, and it was really fun."</TE>
<TE>   Late in the evening, I find myself on stage, singing Faith Hill's
"You're Still the One." An attractive woman in her 50s punches the
air and shouts, "You go, girl!" This is the kind of impromptu sharing
with strangers that karaoke inspires. Afterward, she pulls me aside
and says I remind her of her daughter, who has just moved to the East
Coast.</TE>
<TE>   She tells me she used to sing on Broadway, and with her daughter
gone, she's come to Boardwalk 11 to cheer herself up. Will she sing
for us tonight? "Oh, I don't know, honey," she says and sighs. "I
come here for the healing, and I can get that from singing or
listening, just being here."</TE>
<TE>   Like so many other Angelenos, she has found that karaoke can take
the sting out of a lonely night, create a community out of strangers
or give a struggling singer a few moments in the spotlight. Forget
yoga, reiki, psychics and masseurs. For some, karaoke is the only
healing they need.</TE>

<HD>10 Tips to Take the Scare Out of Karaoke</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julia Gaynor</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>1. If you're nervous, just look at the screen, not at the crowd. No
one will care if you don't make eye contact with them, and if the
screen's up on a wall, you'll just look as if you're singing to some
people in the back of the room anyway.</LD>
<LD>   2. Pick a song you've sung along to at home or in the car or
shower a few times so you at least have a vague idea of how it goes.</LD>
<LD>   3. If you start singing and suddenly realize it's the chipmunk
version when you were hoping for a Barry White baritone, don't be
afraid to ask the karaoke host to change keys or change the speed.
Most machines can do this.</LD>
<TE>   4. Eat the microphone. Professional singers say the best way to
get quality sound from a karaoke mic, especially in a loud room, is
to hold it as close to your mouth as possible.</TE>
<TE>   5. Pick upbeat songs later in the night--especially on the
weekends--because people like to party and dance. If you're desperate
to do a weepy ballad, do it early, do it midweek, or get a private
room.</TE>
<TE>   6. If you're having serious performance anxiety, pick a crowd
pleaser--songs people can't help but sing with you or dance along to,
so the focus is on your song, not you. Consider Billy Joel's "Piano
Man," Elton John's "Rocket Man" or the ubiquitous "I Will Survive."</TE>
<TE>   7. If you're tone-deaf and you know it, this does not exclude you
from seizing your three minutes of stardom on the karaoke stage. Just
rap it or sing-speak it if you have to. As long as you have
personality, people will still love it. And if they don't, they'll
still clap. "Devil Went Down to Georgia" by the Charlie Daniels Band
and "Baby Got Back" by Sir Mix-a-Lot are popular nonsinging songs.</TE>
<TE>   8. If the crowd gets rowdy and doesn't seem to be paying attention
to your song, don't take it personally. It's not "Star Search," it's
a night out with friends.</TE>
<TE>   9. Don't be afraid to tell singers what a great job they did.
Everyone loves praise, and where else in this city can you
comfortably talk to random strangers?</TE>
<TE>   10. Remember, no matter how bad you think you are, someone else in
the room is bound to be worse.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Julia Gaynor</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amagi's--It calls itself "L.A.'s premier karaoke spot," but this was
probably a few years ago. Pro: You can sing every night at this
Japanese restaurant-karaoke bar. Con: You have to pay $1 per song
request, and it's usually a few notches shy of cutting edge. 6114 W.
Sunset Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 464-7497.</LD>
<LD>   Barney's Beanery--What karaoke may have felt like during the
Depression: lifeless and droning. You'd be better off staying home
and singing in the shower. 8447 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood,
(323) 654-2287.</LD>
<LD>   Boardwalk 11--Boardwalk 11 elevates karaoke to a sophisticated and
elegant singing experience. You'll feel more like a lounge singer at
this swanky karaoke supper club on the Westside with its sound
system. Karaoke every day from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. 10433 National Blvd.,
West L.A., (310) 837-5245.</LD>
<TE>   Brass Monkey--The Monkey lets you sing every night, but if you
want to let your hair down with a good-looking crowd, the weekends
are your best bet. 659 S. Mariposa Ave., Koreatown, (213) 381-7047.</TE>
<TE>   Dimples--Their "extreme sport" version of karaoke has props, an
applause machine and claims to be America's first karaoke bar. It's
on every day from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m., but stay away on the weekends if
you want to avoid a $5 cover charge and some loud and aggressive
patrons. 3413 W. Olive Ave., Burbank, (818) 842-2336.</TE>
<TE>   Dublin's--The infamous bar with the "frat party"
feel--conveniently located just across the Sunset Strip from
Myagi's--will soon start having karaoke again Sunday nights after a
short hiatus. 8240 W. Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, (323) 656-0100.</TE>
<TE>   Fubar--Only on Tuesdays can you catch "Barry Dwight Lamano's
Karaoke Extravaganza," which is always fun, if only for Barry's
running commentary between songs. Smack in the middle of West
Hollywood, Fubar draws a mixed crowd for its karaoke night. 7994
Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood, (323) 654-0396.</TE>
<TE>   The Farmers Market--The karaoke at this L.A. institution is
limited to Saturday nights from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. Unless you're an
old pro, you might not actually sing, but it's great for watching
kitsch karaoke at its best and revving up to sing later that night at
a more nonprofessional friendly joint. East Patio, Farmer's Market,
corner of 3rd Street and Fairfax Avenue. (323) 933-9211.</TE>
<TE>   The Gaslite--With an Eastside edge and "down home" feel, this
dimly lit, garland- and Christmas-tree-light-strewn watering hole has
a friendly staff and is good for occasional celebrity spotting and
eccentric regulars. 2030 Wilshire Blvd., Santa Monica, (310)
829-2382.</TE>
<TE>   Karaoke Bleu--If you don't want too much attention paid to your
singing talents, Karaoke Bleu is the place for you. Where Sawtelle
and Olympic meet there's a kind of karaoke corner, with three
Japanese karaoke places. Karaoke Bleu is a western-style karaoke bar,
but singing here is more of a sideshow than the main event. Karaoke
nightly from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. 2064 Sawtelle Blvd., West L.A., (310)
477-4794.</TE>
<TE>   Liquid Kitty--Great name, great venue, too many baseball caps.
Monday nights, a young, probably UCLA-heavy crowd comes here to sing
and screech at this Westside watering hole. 17780 W. Pico Blvd., West
L.A., (310) 473-3707.</TE>
<TE>   Miyagi's--The legendary Sunset Strip magnet for pretty young
things, hardly any of whom actually live anywhere near the Sunset
Strip, will be relaunching its celebrity-studded (Britney, Christina,
'N Sync, Backstreet Boys ... ) Tuesday night karaoke later this
month. 8225 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, (323) 650-3524.</TE>
<TE>   Moomba--Monday nights at Moomba feature the always outrageous
Alexis Arquette, who hosts a fun sing-along alternative to the
otherwise overhyped nightclub in West Hollywood. 665 N. Robertson
Blvd., West Hollywood, 310-652-6364.</TE>
<TE>   The Queen Mary--Transvestites share space with Valley girls in
this relaxed but campy bar, complete with working fireplace and
Victorian paintings. There's a big stage with three backup
microphones in case you want to add that Destiny's Child flavor to
your song. Wednesday and Thursday nights. 12449 Ventura Blvd., Studio
City, (818) 506-5619.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Lion--Monday nights at the Red Lion have been described as
"ghetto karaoke," which might appeal to the Smog Cutter crowd. 2366
Glendale Blvd.,Silver Lake, (323) 662-5337.</TE>
<TE>   Smog Cutter--L.A.'s hippest dive karaoke bar has some kind of
singing every night but Tuesday. 864 N. Virgil Ave., Los Angeles,
(323) 667-9832.</TE>
<TE>   Star Shoes--In the heart of "new Hollywood," along the Cahuenga
corridor, even this so-hot-it-smolders saloon plans to add karaoke to
its schedule in the coming months, or maybe even weeks. 6364
Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 462-7827.</TE>
<TE>   Vaskia--For the bashful or those who want to hog the microphone,
Vaskia is one of many traditional Asian-style karaoke venues in the
heart of Koreatown with private rooms. You can choose a room for
one--great for practicing before your big debut--or rent one to fit
up to 15. Hourly rates for private rooms: $20 to $30. Open every day
from 5 p.m. to 4 a.m. 3377 Wilshire Blvd., Koreatown, (213) 351-0070.</TE>
<TE>   Zen--Another place that charges $1 per song. It has potential,
with its super-trendy Silver Lake location, but hasn't really found
its audience yet. 2609 Hyperion Ave., Silver Lake, (323) 665-2929.</TE>

<KH>MY FAVORITE WEEKEND</KH>
<HD>TV Actress Valarie Rae Miller</HD>

<AU>Adam Bregman</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>* The actress, who plays Original Cindy on Fox's "Dark Angel," also
appears in the current film "All About the Benjamins."</LD>
<LD>   Hot Rock Massage: The last time I went to Palm Springs I went to
this spa, La Quinta, which is in a city which is called La Quinta and
is the next stop after Palm Springs. They have this massage where
they heat these really smooth rocks and place them on different parts
of your back, and it's the nicest feeling. It radiates through your
skin, and it's so relaxing.</LD>
<LD>   Fairfax South: I like that Ethiopian strip on Fairfax. There's the
Blue Nile and another excellent restaurant across the street. They
bring you a million vegetarian dishes like beans and the different
potato dishes and then some sort of meat and you twist it up in that
bread called injera. I like that whole effect.</LD>
<TE>   Hollywood Hip-Hop Hangout: I've been to Grandville, which is
normally at that club called Peanuts. On Saturday nights, they play
hip-hop music and then at midnight strippers come out. They play
really good dance kind of stuff and mix it up a lot. It makes you
move. And usually the house is packed and everyone is dancing.
Sometimes, it gets a little Hollywood heavy. The last time I was
there, I went with Jessica Alba from the show, and Demi Moore, Owen
Wilson and Tobey Maguire were there.</TE>
<TE>   Bumper Boats: What I kind of like to do, but I don't do regularly,
is we go to these kid's arcades. I had my birthday two years ago at
Bullwinkle's, off the 405, which is pretty far south. We had so much
fun. We took it over. I have a lot of cousins who are teenagers and
little kids and we had this huge group. We played video games and did
bumper boats, go-carts and putt-putt golf.</TE>
<TE>   Exotic Fabric: Once or twice a year, I go to Artesia, like Little
India, and I go buy fabric. They have all these beautiful Indian
fabrics and they are really inexpensive. They have great
furniture--handcrafted, Indian stuff.</TE>
<TE>   HBO: I like to be home early on Sundays, because I like to watch
"Six Feet Under." The writing on that show is so good. It's truly an
ensemble show. They didn't just try and focus on one or two people in
the family. They actually use the whole family and then all the
friends, so it's so many more interesting elements drawn together.</TE>
<TE>   The actors are really great too. I think my favorite character is
the mom.</TE>

<LD>   Insurrection: Holding History--In its Los Angeles premiere after
developmental presentations at Mark Taper Forum New Work Festivals in
the mid-'90s, Robert O'Hara's powerful, provocative "Insurrection:
Holding History" stares deep into the darkness of slavery and
prejudice--and dares to laugh. This time-bending adventure begins
when Great-Great-Grandpa (Wil Bowers) insists that his descendant,
Ron (Jeramie Gladman), take him for a ride. As time fragments around
them, they find themselves on an 1830s slave plantation, where the
weighing of cotton is turned into a game show. In the present day, a
white character offhandedly spouts epithets, only to find himself
ambushed by hatchet-wielding revolutionaries from Nat Turner's 1831
slave rebellion.</LD>

<HD>Armory With New Arsenal</HD>
<DH>Renovation adds space and commitment to the arts in
Pasadena.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCARLET CHENG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"As with so many renovation projects," says Scott Ward, sitting amid
new construction at the Armory Center for the Arts, "it began with,
'Well, wouldn't it be great if we could utilize that storage space
... ?' Then it just expanded and expanded."</LD>
<LD>   It is a couple of weeks before Saturday's official unveiling of an
extensive remodel at the Armory, and Ward, the executive director of
the exhibition and art education center in Pasadena, is monitoring
banging hammers, buzzing drills and the rest of the rush to finish
the nine-month project.</LD>
<LD>   Outside the nearly finished offices, he finds architect Donna
Vaccarino on the new mezzanine that bisects the center's vast
two-story central space. Vaccarino helped transform the building once
before, when the arts organization took possession in 1987.</LD>
<TE>   "You don't often get a chance to redo something you did 15 years
ago," she says, looking happily from rafter to deck as her latest
plan for the center takes shape.</TE>
<TE>   From this section of the mezzanine, you can see into the
exhibition space on the building's south side and into classroom
space on the north side. Right now, the workers in both areas are
dappled by brightly colored light. As the work on the renovation goes
on, an exhibition celebrating the rejuvenated space is also under
construction, and it involves using the overhead skylights to create
a stained-glass-window effect.</TE>
<TE>   All morning, artist Jane Mulfinger has been up on the roof
covering the skylights with a patchwork of old clothing--mostly
bright blues in the front skylight, hot reds in the rear. Mulfinger
calls her work "Armory as Cathedral." It's one of 11 installations
commissioned by Jay Belloli, the Armory's curator, for "New Work, New
Spaces," which opens Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   From time to time, Mulfinger descends to the mezzanine to get a
viewer's perspective. "I didn't know what to expect," Vaccarino tells
her on this trip, "but it really transforms the whole space; the
colors are caught all over."</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena's Armory Center for the Arts traces its history back to
1947, when the Pasadena Art Museum formed an education department. In
1974, the department became the Pasadena Art Workshops, and when the
1930s-era Armory building was made available by the city of Pasadena,
the group moved there and renamed itself accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   "The building had been a badminton club," recalls Vaccarino, of
her first go-round with renovating the space. "It needed an enormous
amount of work."</TE>
<TE>   However, the budget for converting the building was limited to
$600,000. Programming was also more modest then. When the renovation
was completed in 1989, the center had eight full-time employees and
an operating budget of $500,000; today there are 24 employees, plus
nearly 100 part-timers and teachers, and a budget of $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The lease was up on the Armory last year, and the center's board
members considered other options before deciding to enlarge and
upgrade the 21,400-square-foot space. They liked its location, at the
north end of Pasadena's Old Town night life and shopping district,
and a subway stop is scheduled to open across the street in 2003. And
the building was already familiar to art lovers as a place to see
contemporary regional work, to music lovers as the site of open
rehearsals for the Southwest Chamber Music ensemble, and to art
students from children to adults.</TE>
<TE>   The upgrades include added central air-conditioning, retrofitting
for earthquakes and an elevator for handicap access. Vaccarino
suggested adding the mezzanine to the central space, which not only
connects the front and back areas of the building at the second-story
level, but also wraps around the north classroom side of the
building. The mezzanine, with its own narrow gallery space and a new
studio structure in the Armory's former parking lot, together add
6,800 square feet to the center.</TE>
<TE>   The total renovation package, including furnishings and new art
equipment, is costing $2.4 million. "It does show ambition, but it
also shows an attainable goal," says Ward. "We've already raised 98%
of those funds." For "New Works, New Spaces," Belloli, the curator,
handpicked 11 mostly mid-career artists from the Southern California
area. They are Lynn Aldrich, Marsia Alexander-Clarke, Geoff Allen,
Deborah Aschheim, Enrique Martinez Celaya, Tamara Fites, Michael C.
McMillen, Jane Mulfinger, Pae White, Steve Roden and Lisa Yu.</TE>
<TE>   Belloli tapped some with specific locations in the Armory in mind,
but the fact that there will be installations from the roof to
beneath the floor is, as he says, "serendipities of the show." His
first priority was simply "looking for artists who could do
interesting works in the spaces I had available." With Mulfinger, for
example, "it struck me right away that her work was wonderful, and
then I thought she might be interested in the skylight."</TE>
<TE>   Mulfinger, who has done large-scale fabric coverings before,
agreed. The Santa Barbara artist mined used-clothing stores for
months, picking out the raw material for the work--T-shirts, blouses,
pants, pajamas, dresses, even a clown suit and evening gown--with
color and density in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "For me this work has a lot to do with making something
extraordinary out of mundane objects," Mulfinger says. The personal
but anonymous nature of the clothes is also important. "They all have
some kind of narrative," she adds, "but I'll never know what that
story is."</TE>
<TE>   On the mezzanine, Aschheim has created a fanciful 40-foot-long
interpretation of how the eye works--with lit-up "rods" and "cones."</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a giant retina for the building," says Aschheim. "It
will show what's happening in your retina and brain while you're
looking at it." Her intention was not a scientific diagram; instead,
she says, "I want to share my sense of wonder about the whole process
of how we see."</TE>
<TE>   Aldrich, Lu and White will be among the artists whose work will be
displayed on the main floor. Each has created new versions of works
done before. Lu's grouping of large white pots had been done for a
backyard installation. White's candy-colored cushions wrapped in
vinyl are meant to be used as seats. Aldrich, known for her use of
garden hoses, has glued together several hundred lengths of a dozen
varieties, mostly green, making a cylindrical bundle, 5 feet in
diameter and 6 feet long. Plenty of hose, but not a drop of water.</TE>
<TE>   "I envision it as a cut-off section of a big water main left high
and dry," she says. "It's sort of a metaphor for human longing. There
seems to be this huge abundance in our society; at the same time we
seem to lack something."</TE>
<TE>   McMillen, who has previously shown a predilection for excavated
spaces, was offered such an area in the foyer, part of which had been
dug up to install new piping. His "Motel [Under the World]," set into
a 4-foot-by-10-foot hole, 21/2 feet deep, is the lair of a figure who
sits in front of a TV set, surrounded by salvaged objects,
channel-surfing past seemingly unrelated images. "We don't know if
we're looking into the future or the past," says McMillen. "It's
definitely about media, and the corporate world of ours and the
individual."</TE>
<TE>   With the Armory building open again, Belloli and his exhibition
staff will have their hands full. The main gallery is slated for four
shows a year; the community room, in the front of the building, will
be used for six exhibitions. For now, they'll also continue to put up
shows in the hangar in northwest Pasadena used as temporary
exhibition space during the renovation, and two satellite spaces at
One Colorado, in Old Town. All told, the exhibition program will
nearly double from what it was before the renovation project began.</TE>
<TE>   Ward is certain the audience is there for an expanded effort in
Pasadena. "We believe art is an essential aspect to a healthy life,"
he says. "People are really hungry to get involved."</TE>

<HD>'Happy Hip-Hop' Sets Festival's Vibe</HD>
<DH>The organizers of Audiotistic expect 37,000 fans to show up
for an event that plays against type.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among the outdoor festivals that pop up in Southern California during
the spring and summer, there is a conspicuous shortage of events
devoted to urban music. Discounting those radio-sponsored packages
that trot out stars of the moment in truncated sets, or behemoths
such as the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, which will
feature a goodly amount of hip-hop in its lineup this year, only
Audiotistic foregrounds rap in a meaningful way.</LD>
<LD>   Now in its fifth year, Audiotistic will feature an invigorating
mix of A-list stars at the National Orange Show Event Center in San
Bernardino on Saturday, including OutKast and the Roots. Along with
leading alternative hip-hop artists such as Oakland's Blackalicious
and Black Star, and master turntablists including QBert and DJ Swamp,
Audiotistic will also showcase techno and its numerous offshoots.</LD>
<LD>   Roni Size and King Britt, two DJs who like to mix up vigorous
beats with R&amp;B flavoring, will anchor an electronic music flank that
will also include Ed Rush, DJ Craze and Jason Bentley. There will be
separate stages devoted to house, techno, and drum-and-bass.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to its music lineup, Audiotistic will try to plug into
L.A. skateboard culture by erecting a makeshift skate park inside the
Orange Center's pavilion that will be free to use for anyone willing
to lug their board along.</TE>
<TE>   The park is designed by pro skater Chad Muska, whose company,
Circa Footwear, is also hosting a $5,000 best trick contest at the
event.</TE>
<TE>   The festival, which began in 1998 as a mostly techno, strictly
underground event, has grown to the point where founder Meelo Solis,
a veteran promoter at age 24, expects roughly 37,000 to attend this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "It began at the [San Bernardino] Sports Arena, which had become a
rave venue," says Solis. "We spread the word strictly through flier
marketing. There was no real advertising, and we got 2,500 people to
attend that year."</TE>
<TE>   Audiotistic is being produced and promoted by an unlikely
alliance: Solis, a self-described "club kid" who has been promoting
events since age 18; his brother Ben, 27; and investment bankers
Darin Feinstein, 29, and Bevan Cooney, 28, whose company, U.S.
Concerts, provided the seed money for this year's event, allowing
Meelo to snag album-of-the-year Grammy nominee OutKast as the
headliner.</TE>
<TE>   "Darin really gives me the freedom to spend the kind of money I
need to spend, where other investors might back off and worry," says
Solis.</TE>
<TE>   It was Feinstein who suggested that the festival nudge its way
toward a stronger hip-hop emphasis, thereby attracting a larger crowd
and more sponsors as well. "We've morphed the [festival] to try to
make it more mainstream," says Feinstein, who is a co-owner with
Meelo Solis of the El Dorado nightclub in Brentwood and a planned
steakhouse in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   With the move toward hip-hop, Audiotistic began attracting
high-profile sponsors to the event, companies eager to reach the
16-to-25 suburban demographic that the festival targets. This year,
30 vendors will be on-site. "We've got it covered: clothing lines,
lots of skateboard companies, people selling food," says Feinstein.</TE>
<TE>   Solis and Feinstein's objective is to put the best possible face
on contemporary hip-hop by showcasing those acts that stress uplift
in their music--what Solis calls "happy hip-hop."</TE>
<TE>   "We're dealing with two demons in the general public's view," he
says. "First, the perception of hip-hop being associated with guns
and violence, and the perception of techno and raves being associated
with the drug Ecstasy. But our track record speaks for itself. We've
never had a single violent incident or drug overdose at Audiotistic."</TE>
<TE>   That vibe has appeal for positive-minded groups such as the
Philadelphia-based Roots, which will be performing at its second
Audiotistic on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "California audiences are laid-back and into it at the same time,"
says Amir, a rapper with the Roots. "I like the atmosphere out there.
The weather's nice, and Californians have an appreciation of good
music. It's just a situation where you've got to try and distill the
show into a 45-minute set, and hit them with a punch. It's a
challenge, but we've done it before, and we'll do it again."</TE>

<CX>   El Dorado--A story about the Audiotistic music festival in
Thursday's Calendar Weekend incorrectly identified Meelo Solis as a
co-owner with Darin Feinstein of the El Dorado club in Brentwood and a
planned steakhouse in Las Vegas. Bevan Cooney and Feinstein are the
partners in both ventures.</CX>

<LD>8pm Music</LD>
<LD>   Robert Thies, the American prizewinner in the 1995 Prokofiev
Competition in Russia, has proved since then to be a versatile
virtuoso as well as a gifted chamber musician. He returns this week
to play Ernst von Dohnanyi's daunting "Variations on a Nursery Tune"
with the Pasadena Symphony, Jorge Mester conducting. Also on this
program: Rossini's "William Tell" Overture and Shostakovich's 15th
Symphony.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Thies and the Pasadena Symphony, Civic Auditorium, 300 E.
Green St., Pasadena, 8 p.m. $10 to $64. (626) 584-8833.</LD>

<TE>   Sandy is having a bad day. His hillside apartment is seedy; his
only means of support is selling home-grown pot; his newly homeless
and destitute parents have arrived--in their Rolls-Royce--in- tending
to move in; and he can see the flames of the L.A. riots in the
Hollywood streets below. Justin Tanner directs Chautauqua Theatre
Alliance's production of Taylor Negron and Lawrence Justice's newly
revised comedy, "Gangster Planet," starring Negron ("So Little Time"
and "The Hughleys"), David Groh, Jeannette O'Connor and Italian
comedian Simon N. Butera.</TE>
<TE>   "Gangster Planet," Egyptian Arena Theatre, 1625 N. Las Palmas
Ave., L.A., 8 p.m. Regular schedule: Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.;
Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends May 19. $18. (323) 960-8865.</TE>

<TE>   8pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   Many of us have yearned to throw something at an insufferably
self-enchanted performer. But in a uproarious, on-target satire
titled "Out of Season or Eating Pizza While Watching 'Raging Bull,'"
David Dorfman gave plastic golf balls to the audience, inviting them
to respond to his deliberately transparent attempts at manipulation
("I care about you") and parodies of confessional performance art.
Now he's back with another multidisciplinary truth or dare piece, "To
Lie Tenderly," along with a newly commissioned work in which his
troupe will dance alongside students from the Cal State Long Beach
dance department. Golf balls, anyone?</TE>
<TE>   David Dorfman Dance, Carpenter Center for the Performing Arts, Cal
State Long Beach, 6200 Atherton St., Long Beach, 8 p.m. $20
(students, seniors) to $25. (562) 985-7000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   2 &amp; 8pm Movies</TE>
<TE>   Standing in stark contrast to the routine courtroom dramas churned
out by Hollywood today is Billy Wilder's entry in the genre, "Witness
for the Prosecution." Fueled by its triple-reverse surprise ending,
the 1958 adaptation (Wilder scripted with Harry Kurnitz) of Agatha
Christie's melodrama provides an acting field day for Tyrone Power as
the accused, Marlene Dietrich as his seemingly heartless wife and,
especially, Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester as a wily barrister
and his wilier nurse.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Film Society presents "Witness for the Prosecution," Alex
Theatre, 216 N. Brand Blvd., Glendale, 2 and 8 p.m. $6 to $8.50.
(818) 754-8250.</TE>

<TE>   Aspiring poets, ages 5 to 17, get out your berets, shades, black

Cafe," the bookstore and art gallery's annual celebration of National
Poetry Month, all comers are invited to perform their favorite poems,
songs, haiku, raps, limericks or interpretive dance moves, original
or not. Kathy Kinney, "The Drew Carey Show's" Mimi, returns as guest
reader and host; and critically acclaimed guest poet Kristine
O'Connell George ("Little Dog Poems") will read her work and lead an
"instant poetry" project.</TE>
<TE>   "6th Annual Storyopolis Kids' Poetry Cafe," Storyopolis, 116 N.
Robertson Blvd., Plaza A, West L.A., 11:30 a.m. Free, but
reservations advised. (310) 358-2512.</TE>

<TE>   7pm Movies</TE>
<TE>   The fringe genres of horror, sci-fi, rock 'n' roll, Eurotrash, art
house, experimental, sexploitation, plus rebel films and midnight
movies, come together for Anxiety Films' first Mini-Shock Film
Festival. The seven-hour amalgam of B-movie shorts from independent
filmmakers also features rockin' B-movie bands, prize giveaways and
the world premiere of a film with a title that is not suitable for a
family newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Anxiety Films presents the first Mini-Shock Film Festival, the
Smell, 247 S. Main St., downtown L.A., 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. $6. (323)
666-2871.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   8pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, the group Quetzal is an heir to Los Lobos, with its
mix of Mexican roots music, folk and rock--and it looks as if the
band is also following its forerunner's example as a social force.
Quetzal is spearheading an event called Firetenders, combining music
and spoken word in an evening of social and political commentary from
L.A.'s ethnic communities.</TE>
<TE>   Firetenders, with Quetzal, John Trudell, Wanda Coleman, Velina
Hasu Houston, Jose Montoya, Japan America Theatre, 244 S. San Pedro
St., downtown L.A., 8 p.m. $15 to 20. (213) 680-3700.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>OK, it's time for a crackdown on Sunset Strip parking prices. Went
cruising on the Strip on a recent Saturday night and much to my
dismay, I found parking attendants charging $30!? Greed is not
good.... After a hectic search, I found a parking lot behind the
Shamrock Social Club tattoo parlor that was charging only seven
bucks. But man, the city of West Hollywood needs to check itself.</LD>
<LD>   Also had the displeasure of revisiting the Roxy, which recently
underwent a modest remodel. Between being told to move every three
seconds, I fantasized about a complete renovation, one that included
proper ventilation and a revamped layout. The only salve to the
discomfort was amazing performances by Too Rude and Slightly Stoopid,
two reggae punk bands that are blowing up big time.</LD>
<LD>   In 10 years of party crashing, I've never been to anything
lovelier than Denzel Washington's recent Sunset Room bash. The Oscar
winner sure knows how to pick his friends. Among the guests who
showed up at the Hollywood club were John Travolta, Eddie Murphy,
Will and Jada Pinkett Smith, Ethan Hawke, Jesse Jackson, James Brolin
and Barbra Streisand. I got the chance to yap with the man of the
hour, who was sporting a Yankees cap and a grin but, alas, I didn't
get to tango with Travolta. There's always next year....</LD>
<TE>   Popped into the Key Club on Saturday for FREQ, the Sunset Strip
nightclub's newest erotic dance party. Lemme just tell you, it's
super freaky.</TE>
<TE>   Ran into that cutie-patootey actress Alison Eastwood at the
Shamrock Social Club. She'd just inked a lucky horseshoe on her
ankle. I also spotted author Shawna Kenney, who penned the cult
classic "I Was a Teenage Dominatrix." Shooter Jennings, the son of
the late wailin' Waylon, brings his band Stargunn to the Viper Room
on April 24, kicking off a monthlong Wednesday night residency for
the Southern-fried rock band.... And mark your calendars for Dr.
Lady, a hot buzz band playing the Viper next Thursday.... Looks like
the Echo in Echo Park is reverberating with good times on Saturday
afternoons, when it hosts a weekly punk rock comedy cabaret. Oi! The
new nightclub is also hosting the Third Annual Iggy Pop birthday bash
and barbecue on April 20, with performances by Texas Terri &amp; the
Stiff Ones, Motorcycle Boy, the Hangmen and more.</TE>
<TE>   Man, the boys behind the Sunset Strip faves Miyagi's and the
Saddle Ranch Chop House are at it again. Larry Pollack and Tom Dillon
are launching a new Saddle Ranch at CityWalk on May 11, just in time
for summer. Yee-haw.... Just 19 more shopping days till the Rainbow
Bar &amp; Grill turns 30. The veteran rock spot's planning an ill bash
for its b-day on April 30. Let the good times roll, yo.</TE>

<LD>Our Cuban restaurants have always had their own style. The Miami
sort, the flashy nightclubby places with crystal chandeliers and red
velvet, never really got off the ground here. Neither did the old
Jackson Heights-type dives reeking of frying lard and cigar smoke.</LD>
<LD>   After Castro's ascent, a lot of tidy mom-and-pop Cuban dinettes
opened around town, each cultivating its own delightfully quirky
personality. They offered homesick Cuban newcomers "abuelita
cuisine"--the dishes any Cuban grandmother can cook by heart:
codfish, roast pork marinated with tart Seville orange juice,
garlicky chicken with crisp skin, all in the portions for which the
doggie bag was invented. Many of these places are still going strong,
but more recently the Nuevo Latino cuisine developed on the East
Coast has fostered a few newcomers such as Xiomara.</LD>
<LD>   The Cuban Bistro in Alhambra is unlike any of these, and very much
an L.A. place. The decor is simple but sharp: teal walls, tablecloths
covered with butcher paper, a big Cuban flag. The kitchen aims, with
a fair measure of success, to appeal to trendy tastes while pleasing
customers who just want grandma's food in a chichi ambience.
"Traditional Cuban cuisine with a California twist" is how the menu
describes the cooking.</LD>
<TE>   From the main dining area you can hear laughter mixing with the
clatter of dishes floating over a low wall that marks off a section
often used for parties. There's a small bar off the entryway--too
small, perhaps, for the ambitions of the very lengthy bar menu that
offers a bubble gum martini and other wacky baroque libations.
(Liqueur-spiked tequila is a "Cubarita"; Miami Nice Tea has six
alcoholic ingredients.) Naturally, there are Cuban mojitos of rum and
sugar, and very good ones, refreshingly minty and not too sweet.</TE>
<TE>   Most appetizers stay within familiar territory, but there's one
sensational exception: testones rellenos, two-inch lengths of
plantain hollowed into boat shapes, fried crisp and stuffed with
chopped shrimp and crab meat. Cuban ham croquettes can be a serious
appetite suppressant, but Cuban Bistro's croquetas are dainty logs of
smoky ham held together with a mere whisper of bechamel sauce and
crumbs.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner specials tend to be the most adventurous items, and among
the most carefully cooked. One evening there was an impressive
chicken breast stuffed with goat cheese and paprika-laced Spanish
sausage in a shallow pool of saffron-scented chicken reduction and
Chilean sea bass in a mojo sauce that used fresh tangerine juice in
place of Seville orange juice. Both entrees came without the black
beans many consider essential to a Cuban--or even a Cal-Cuban--meal.
The $3.50 side of perfectly cooked black beans or the restaurant's
rich smooth black bean soup can fill the breach.</TE>
<TE>   Fish and seafood occupy the longest section of the menu. A
mango-papaya salsa with avocado chunks brightens the garlic-laced
grilled mahi mahi. Tender lobster tail, served in a potent buttery
garlic sauce, is a luxury version of the traditional camarones al
ajillo (which is also available).</TE>
<TE>   Cuban comfort-food classics--lechon asado, ropa vieja, breaded
pollo a la milanesa (accompanied with the bean-rice-plantain
trilogy)--fill out the regular menu. For the most part, dishes are
not overcooked the way they can be in Cuban restaurants, but a few
items could be tended more carefully. My roast chicken (in a subtly
sweet guava sauce) had dried out on re-heating; the shoestring sweet
potatoes accompanying a beautifully grilled beef tenderloin were as
limp as noodles.</TE>
<TE>   Among the desserts, the classic flan and the coconut flan are both
as tender as a mother's sigh, but the waiter always promotes the
banana roll--a banana and chocolate chips wrapped in a flour
tortilla, deep-fried, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and served a la
mode. It turns out to be a delicious pastry--one of the many details
that give Cuban Bistro a style of its own.</TE>

<HD>Smokin' Grooves Tour, Keys Among Acts at Greek, Universal</HD>
<DH>A folk-bluegrass event and blasts from the past such as
Poison, New Edition and Loverboy are also on the schedule of
concerts.</DH>

<LD>The return of the Smokin' Grooves tour, an encore from the Down From
the Mountain folk-country-bluegrass showcase and a turn in the
spotlight for Grammy winner Alicia Keys are among the highlights of
the 2002 seasons at the Greek Theatre and the Universal Amphitheatre.</LD>
<LD>   Smokin' Grooves, launched in 1996 as an ambitious attempt to
present rap acts in a high-quality setting, returns after a
three-year hiatus, with OutKast, the Roots, Jurassic 5 and DJ Shadow
playing Universal on July 19. Down From the Mountain, built around
the music from the film "O Brother, Where Art Thou?," moves to the
Greek on Aug. 1 after playing the Amphitheatre in February, while
Keys' July 30 date at the Greek will be her biggest show yet in L.A.</LD>
<LD>   The 2002 season is the first since Nederlander Concerts, which
operates the Greek, and House of Blues Concerts Inc., which runs
Universal, ended a bitter rivalry in September by striking an
agreement to jointly produce and market concerts at the two venues.</LD>
<TE>   One result is a merger of the theaters' two ticket clubs into a
new subscription program. Tickets for the season will be available
Sunday through the Premiere Marquee Club, by online orders at
www.premieremarqueeclub.com, by mailing an order form to Premiere
Marquee Club, P.O. Box 8679, Universal City, CA 91618, by faxing the
form to (818) 622-3638 or by phone through Ticketmaster, (213)
480-3232.</TE>

<DH>Re-creating old-style broadcast dramas allows kids'
imaginations to take flight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE J. NELSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a small, modern room overflowing with antique sound-effects props,
a game of Clue has sprung to life. Mothers scream. Fathers do their
best Monty Python imitations. A handful of children stand at the
center of a whodunit, surrounded by the sound of dead bodies dropping
faster than you can say "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes."</LD>
<LD>   Or "Inspector Rufflethorpe," the 1938-style radio show that's a
respectful salute to the detective genre. A cast of 18, more than
half of them children, is taping the show as part of the "Re-Creating
Radio" family workshops that take place Saturday mornings at the
Museum of Television &amp; Radio in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Casting kids in adult roles is part of the fun, says Tony Palermo,
producer of the shows. "In our Rick Lowell series, the femme fatale
is going, 'What do the Nazis want with me?' And the answer is, 'It's
not a manicure, sister.' To hear a 9-year-old say that, it's just
unbelievable."</LD>
<TE>   Thousands of children have gone through the program since it
started six years ago as an offshoot of the long-established workshop
at the museum's New York location. The dozen or so original radio
dramas they produce are mainly thrillers but include tales of
superheroes, western adventures and outer space sci-fi.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had an 83-year-old lady doing 'The Shadow.' The
grandparents really love coming to this," Palermo says. "People have
this idea that radio's old-fashioned. It's a wonderful, imaginative
exercise. It's what kids do, make noises or use voices."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cecil Castellucci, the show's director, begins the 90-minute
session by driving home the need to create a "mental picture" using
voices and sound effects. Film clips show how a 1939 "Tom Mix" radio
program was produced and relive the fallout of 1938's "War of the
Worlds."</TE>
<TE>   When the kids are asked to voice act, three make creepy,
evil-alien sounds. One 8-year-old, whose mother swears she's never
done this before, is an over-the-top damsel in distress.</TE>
<TE>   Half the kids want to do special effects, so they are led to the
recording studio to become familiar with authentic props donated by
NBC and CBS, as well as time-honored effects techniques.</TE>
<TE>   "You can act out an entire war using a box of metal popcorn cans,
dishes, stones, pennies, spatulas and mixing spoons," says Palermo,
who got his start in radio in a class show at age 8. "In radio you
can do anything, and that's what we try to do."</TE>
<TE>   The young "sound effects artists" will work with two tables full
of props. They'll use a wind machine, a wood cylinder that rotates
with fabric attached, to conjure up wind during a seance; tap on a
coconut shell with a drumstick to imitate rapping on a secret
passage; and crinkle a plastic grocery bag to mimic the crackle of
fire. (My 11-year-old son's favorite will be "the body slam," where
he bangs two "caveman clubs" on the floor to simulate the sound of
bodies dropping.)</TE>
<TE>   In the 40-seat screening room, the director is sizing up the kids,
trying to determine who's a good enough reader to take on a big part.
Everyone was handed a casting sheet when they showed up, and some
will be asked to read from it. But reading perfectly is never really
the point.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel really, really strongly that kids should be allowed to do
what they are interested in," Castellucci says. "Everyone who wants
to read gets a part. Whether it's big or little is the difference."</TE>
<TE>   My 14-year-old daughter snags the lead, but it's not because she
oozes star potential. Because she's the oldest kid in the room, the
director knows she'll be able to handle Inspector Rufflethorpe's
lines. Once the children are cast, the adults fill out the bill. (In
a bit of family typecasting, I am Elsie the maid as well as Col.
Frothingham, "a retired military man.")</TE>
<TE>   We run through the 24-page cliche-filled thriller written by
Palermo, who admits, "I've read more Agatha Christie than I should
have." We go over a pronunciation guide of characters' names and a
glossary of about 20 potentially unfamiliar words (harum-scarum,
potassium cyanide). We learn to do "walla wallas" (idle background
chatter) and to follow the director's cues.</TE>
<TE>   We're nowhere near ready to perform, considering we've been an
ensemble for a little more than an hour. Yet it's show time for this
Inspector Rufflethorpe episode subtitled "The Twitshire Murder Case."</TE>
<TE>   In the studio, the voice actors gather around three microphones
while the special-effects artists flank their own director and props.
"Something always goes wrong," Castellucci says of the taping. "There
are always funny things that happen, like horses galloping before the
people get on them."</TE>
<TE>   We're so busy running through the script, almost no one seems to
notice our big flub. One of the child actors is on the wrong page
when it's his turn to deliver a big monologue. "Usually, you just
move on," Castellucci says, "but everybody was frozen in that
situation. We stopped the tape and rewound so we wouldn't have two
minutes of dead air."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After the taping, "Countess Valeska" (a.k.a. Sara Corcoran, 8, of
Culver City) says, "I loved it. It was really fun. I liked doing an
accent." Her mother, "Lady Bensington," is equally enthusiastic. "It
was unexpectedly really fun," says Christy Humphrey, 42. "It was a
pleasant surprise."</TE>
<TE>   For Castellucci, another of the 200 shows she'll direct this year
is in the can. She has no doubt that we'll all be pleasantly
surprised when we play the tapes that will be mailed to us in a few
weeks--bad British accents and cross-gender roles notwithstanding.</TE>

<HD>'What's on the Hearts of Men' on a Mission</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Malik Yoba, director (with George Faison), writer (with brother A.
Rahman Yoba) and star of the musical "What's on the Hearts of Men,"
playing through Sunday at the Wilshire Theatre, has described himself
as an "actorvist." The actor part is self-explanatory; Yoba, best
known for his role in the TV series "New York Undercover," also
appears in "Hearts of Men." The "-vist" part comes from his offstage
devotion to social causes, most notably the Malik Yoba Fatherhood
Project, serving fathers and families.</LD>
<LD>   With "What's on the Hearts of Men," the Yoba brothers become
theatervists, or playwrightvists, or something like that.</LD>
<LD>   This boisterous, unabashedly emotional story of three confused
guys (portrayed with crystal clarity by Malik Yoba, Michael LeMelle
and BeBe Winans) and their struggles with the realities and
stereotypes of what it means to be an African American male at the
millennium is a sometimes moving, often baffling combination of
musical play and sermon, theater and therapy.</LD>
<TE>   This show, which stopped in New York, Milwaukee, Detroit,
Minneapolis and Atlanta before coming to L.A., seems to be less on a
theater tour than on a mission to change American society, complete
with a recurring high school lecture on birth control ("two
words--con dom.")</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the long-running, three-woman confessional "The Vagina
Monologues," currently at the Coronet Theatre, the opposite sex
appears onstage in "Hearts of Men"--most notably the diminutive vocal
powerhouse Stephanie Mills, who has returned from wherever she's been
since "The Wiz" to portray Carmen, the relentlessly perky
girl-next-door, friend and conscience to the men. This is not a male
monologue, but an attempt at a conversation between the sexes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet this earnest, uneven effort is at its best in those scenes
when it's not too teachy and preachy. Possibly to the detriment of
the intended message, these three men are at their most real, and
most appealing, when they're behaving very, very badly. It's almost
worth enduring the melodramatic plot twists--and scoldings from
Stephanie--to get to the smart, edgy, hilarious vernacular of these
emotionally wounded men when they're alone. Onstage, the Yobas'
script offers plenty of instruction on how men should treat women,
but they seem to write better when females are completely out of the
room.</TE>
<TE>   There are some gorgeous voices here, most notably Mills and
Winans, belting out unmemorable songs. Unfortunately, the power of
the voices was compromised by an erratic sound system, cranked up
beyond the threshold of pain.</TE>

<HD>In Echo Park, He's Spreading Word on Movies</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JESSICA HUNDLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the center of a brightly lit Echo Park storefront, Paolo Davanzo
beams like a proud father. The source of the 31-year-old activist and
artist's paternal delight is arranged neatly in the room around
him--a rack of rare experimental and documentary video rentals, a
shelf of film journals, a glass case containing stacks of
8-millimeter film canisters, cameras and projectors and (Davanzo
presents this last feature with a dramatic flourish) a large white
screen, which, when lowered from its nest just above the plate-glass
windows, converts the storefront into a makeshift screening room.</LD>
<LD>   Painted in cheery shades of blue and orange, this
clubhouse-studio-store and home-grown screening room is Davanzo's
dream project, the Echo Park Film Center.</LD>
<LD>   "It really is like I've given birth to a child," says Davanzo,
"and some days it's sweet and cuddly, and some days it's angry and
doesn't want go to bed!"</LD>
<TE>   The center, which opened in December, occupies a slice of Alvarado
just off Sunset Boulevard, an area that has experienced a speedy
gentrification over the past year, its boarded-up windows and
graffiti-covered brick giving way to the film center, a clothing
store, a skate shop and the homey Down Beat Cafe.</TE>
<TE>   Davanzo and his partner, Ken Fountain, founded the center in the
hopes of creating a grass-roots organization that would allow
neighborhood families and the area's resident hipsters to share a
mutual love and fascination for the movies. Fountain concentrates
mainly on the reconditioning and revamping of vintage film equipment,
which the center sells at cut-rate costs. Davanzo's duties include
amassing the store's video offerings: an array of abstract
experimentation, political documentaries and rare animation, the sort
of material you'd be hard pressed to find at your local Blockbuster.</TE>
<TE>   Davanzo is also in charge of curating (and enlisting guest
curators) for the center's Thursday night screenings. Past events
have included a night of avant-garde cinema (with works from the
likes of Austrian filmmaker Martin Arnold and experimental pioneer
Maya Deren), as well as program titled "Broken Music," which featured
videos from Christian Marclay and the band Sonic Youth.</TE>
<TE>   Davanzo's focus, however, is not merely on the obscure and
eclectic. Upcoming screenings include everything from an evening of
Pixelvision entertainment (films made on the now-defunct Fisher Price
toy camera) and a cinematic version of an open-mic night, where local
filmmakers strut their stuff for the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I always meet these people who are not making the sort of stuff
you're going to see at the mall," says Davanzo. "A lot of these
filmmakers tour like rock 'n' roll bands and they need local venues
like this. Basically we want to provide something for everyone, and
we try to encourage the audience to engage in a dialogue afterward.
We hang out and play a little music and make people feel like they're
part of something bigger."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the center's other offerings, Davanzo is also about
to begin the first in a series of film classes he will offer free to
local students younger than 17.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll start with Super 8," he says, "because a lot of these kids
can't have a computer at home. People talk about the media
revolution, where anyone can make a film, but it's still really
limited to finances. So the Super 8, which is just a beautiful
medium, is to get the blood coursing through the veins and get them
excited about film."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the seven-week course, students will be encouraged to
structure, shoot and edit their own short movies. Meanwhile, Davanzo
is in the process of acquiring donated computer editing equipment,
which he hopes to utilize in upcoming classes.</TE>
<TE>   "Computer editing is a vocational skill for kids, but obviously,
having an art background, I also want the kids to dream and work with
images," says Davanzo. "I don't want this place to be a fly-by-night
venture. Part of what I want to do with these classes is I want the
kids I teach to become skilled enough to teach the younger kids and,
in turn, really take this into the community."</TE>
<TE>   With his film center classes and his day job as an instructor for
the L.A. Unified School District, Davanzo seems to have found a way
of combining his love of teaching with his longtime passion for
filmmaking. Born in Italy and raised in the U.S. by politically
active parents, Davanzo discovered the tremendous power of the moving
image while earning his political science degree at an Italian
university.</TE>
<TE>   "It was during the Gulf War and I was talking with friends in
America who were experiencing this kind of sanitized CNN war where no
Iraqis were getting hurt," Davanzo says. "But meanwhile I was in
Italy, which has so many political parties, so we were getting the
Communist interpretation, the Green Party interpretation, and what
you were seeing was much more disturbing. It really made me respect
the power of the media and the power of visual imagery to influence
opinion."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After finishing his degree, Davanzo enrolled at Humboldt State
University in Northern California and earned his master's in
filmmaking with the hope of using images to convey the deep-seated
political beliefs instilled in him by his mother and father. After
the deaths of his parents, Davanzo found he could also use film as a
means of dealing with grief. After the passing of his father four
years ago, Davanzo retreated to the sanctuary of his van and spent
eight weeks traveling across the country, hosting free screenings in
small towns and midsize cities.</TE>
<TE>   "Some nights the police would tell me to leave," Davanzo says with
a mischievous grin, "some nights it would be two people saying, 'I
don't get these films,' but some nights it would be 40 people with
picnic baskets all having a great time. It definitely helped me to
deal with my loss."</TE>
<TE>   From this initial adventure, the idea of a traveling festival
(dubbed "The Super Super 8") grew, and eventually Davanzo began to
take films to sites as far away as Japan and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we've gotten older and wiser," Davanzo says of the festival.
"We still do free screenings, but around the world and at established
venues. It's a kind of carnival. We play bingo, we sing songs, and we
find a local band to add music."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the films Davanzo has screened at the Super Super 8 are
available for rental on videocassettes at the Echo Park center, and
filmmakers he has met over the years are often invited to curate
screenings. In this way, Davanzo has managed to establish a looseknit
grass-roots community of filmmakers from all over the globe.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of organization is virtually nonexistent here in L.A.,"
says Davanzo, shaking his head, "and the city is hungry for it. Film
is so much a part of the community here, yet so much of the community
is alienated from the process."</TE>
<TE>   This passion for bringing art to the people was also undoubtedly
inspired by Davanzo's parents, both of whom were activists and
involved in charity work.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the idea of this place revolves around how I was
raised," Davanzo says. "So many children are alienated from their
parents, and there's this kind of TV dinner mentality where they
can't wait to leave at 18. But my parents' death was in a lot of ways
a catalyst for me to try to continue with the ideas that they
instilled in me, to give back to the community.".</TE>
<TE>   Davanzo pauses and gazes around the room. "It's about letting
everyone have a piece of the pie," he says. "It's not about a
filmmaker and an audience, it's not about that division. It's about
breaking down those barriers and showing people that if they love
film, they can make film. It's not about equipment, it's about
ideas."</TE>

<HD>'High Noon' Showdown</HD>
<DH>Film* An upcoming PBS documentary, based on a letter by
Carl Foreman outlining his role in the making of the classic film, is
the basis of a dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new PBS documentary, "Darkness at High Noon: The Carl Foreman
Documents," revolves around a letter that blacklisted
writer-director-producer Carl Foreman wrote in 1952 from England to
Bosley Crowther, the famed New York Times film critic. Crowther had
written a rave review of "High Noon," the classic western Foreman
wrote.</LD>
<LD>   Foreman relates in the lengthy and revealing letter his version of
the history of "High Noon," his battle with the House Un-American
Activities Committee and his subsequent firing from Stanley Kramer
Productions, of which he was one of six partners, after he exercised
his 5th Amendment rights before the committee.</LD>
<LD>   The documentary, which screens tonight at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art and is scheduled to air later this year on PBS, has
raised the ire of Karen Sharpe Kramer, Stanley Kramer's widow. The
film, she maintains, paints her husband as a villain. Karen Kramer
also doubts the authenticity of the Crowther letter, explaining that
the critic was a lifelong friend and admirer of her husband and never
mentioned the letter to him.</LD>
<TE>   "If I don't stand up and I don't say this is not true, this is not
the way it was, then people will assume that what they made this film
about is the way it was," says Kramer, a TV and film producer. "They
have indicted Stanley Kramer and have provided no defense."</TE>
<TE>   The documentary was written, directed and executive-produced by
Lionel Chetwynd, an Emmy-nominated writer-director of such films as
"Kissinger and Nixon" and "The Man Who Captured Eichmann," and
executive produced by Norman S. Powell. "A lot of what she [Kramer]
says is simply not true," says Chetwynd.</TE>
<TE>   "These people ruined [Foreman's] life once. By what right do they
do it a second time? That is what this is, the blacklist redux."</TE>
<TE>   Foreman, who died in 1984, was a well-respected, Oscar-nominated
screenwriter, director and producer who was a victim of the Hollywood
blacklist. A member of the Army Signal Corps during World War II, he
joined Stanley Kramer and his young company after the war when they
made such socially conscious films as "Champion" (1949), "The Men"
(1950) and "High Noon" (1952). Foreman's scripts for all three films
received Oscar nominations.</TE>
<TE>   A communist before and briefly after World War II, he refused to
name names when called to testify before HUAC and fled to London
before "High Noon" was released. He continued to work anonymously on
scripts, including 1957's Oscar-winning "The Bridge on the River
Kwai." He began his own production company in the early '60s, writing
and producing the 1961 action-adventure classic "The Guns of
Navarone." Kramer, who died last year, came to Hollywood as a writer
in 1933 and worked as an editor and associate producer before World
War II. After the war, he became one of the most daring producers in
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   After producing a string of successful films, he made his
directorial debut in 1955 with "Not as a Stranger." In subsequent
films, he examined racism in 1958's "The Defiant Ones," religious
freedom in 1960's "Inherit the Wind," Nazi war criminals in 1961's
"Judgment at Nuremberg" and race relations in 1967's "Guess Who's
Coming to Dinner." Karen Kramer believes that "Carl Foreman was a
very paranoid man. I would be paranoid, too, I suppose if this
happened to me. But you have to understand that this was his free
choice to become a communist. It wasn't Stanley's choice. Stanley
didn't believe in the blacklist."</TE>
<TE>   As for Foreman, she says, "they [Kramer productions] had just
moved their offices to Columbia Pictures [from United Artists] and he
had just signed a deal with Harry Cohn to have autonomy in his choice
of material, but they were still under contract to Harry Cohn. This
documentary skirts the role the studio played in this. Harry Cohn
said, 'If Carl Foreman takes the 5th Amendment, I'm firing him.'"</TE>
<TE>   Since receiving a copy of the documentary from an anonymous
friend, Kramer has spent three months collecting evidence she
believes refutes several points in the documentary. Kramer says that
about six months before her husband died, she received a call from an
assistant of Chetwynd's requesting an interview with her husband. He
was too ill to do it and she offered to do the interview.</TE>
<TE>   "They said: Oh, no, this is only in the first person. They never
asked me: Do you know anyone [they could interview]?"</TE>
<TE>   "We imposed a very, very stiff rule, only first-person testimony,"
says Chetwynd, who had been friends with Foreman since the late '60s
in London. He first got a copy of the Crowther letter from Foreman's
widow shortly after his death. He says he and Powell pleaded for
Kramer's widow to supply them the name of someone from that time who
could talk on her husband's behalf. "She never answered the calls,"
says Chetwynd. "We have records of the logs. Then we wrote her a
letter and we never heard from her."</TE>
<TE>   Kramer and several of the filmmaker's friends--including Abby Mann
who penned the screenplays of "Judgment at Nuremberg" and "Ship of
Fools"--feel Chetwynd has attacked the late director because Chetwynd
is widely known for his conservative views. "I think on a deeper
level, this is a political situation," says Kramer. "I am for freedom
of speech, but when someone passes away you can say anything you
please and there's not much you can do about it. You can't sue for
defamation of character. Unfortunately, Stanley cannot fight back,
not legally anyway ... the family's hands are tied."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Darkness at High Noon: The Carl Foremen Documents" screens
tonight at 7:30 at the Leo S. Bing Theatre at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art, 5905 Wilshire Blvd. Following the screening, L.A.
Weekly film critic F.X. Feeney will conduct a Q&amp;A with filmmaker
Lionel Chetwynd. Admission is free.</TE>

<HD>Fun and Games in a First Family</HD>
<DH>The well-dressed Kennedys play to win in a biting musical
satire on the life of 'Jack.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kennedys were famous for their games of touch football--a fun
pastime that had the added advantage of enhancing the family's image.
They all looked so rugged, so sexy, so American. How could anyone not
want them to be the nation's first family?</LD>
<LD>   Playwright Jim Tosney and composer-lyricist Tom Megan take that
ball and run with it, suggesting in their new musical satire, "Jack,"
that the Kennedys tried to run the country the same way they
approached backyard football. They played to win, and they looked so
fantastic while doing it that a dazzled nation didn't look too
closely at the family's otherwise troubling behavior.</LD>
<LD>   In its premiere staging at Sacred Fools Theater in Hollywood,
"Jack" is broad but biting--a bit like Vaughn Meader's
generation-defining 1962 comedy album "The First Family."</LD>
<TE>   The songs are neither memorable nor terribly organic, but like
everything else on display here, they prove to be rather cheeky and
entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   As embodied by Robert Machemer, Jack Kennedy is impossibly
handsome--in an Eastern preppy sort of way--with a gleaming smile
that borders on a smirk. He was born for the camera, which will
become an invaluable ally in his campaign for the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Although JFK is an attractive figurehead, the real power resides
in Papa Joe (Chad Restum), who assures generals, Mafiosi and a
distrustful J. Edgar Hoover (John Sylvain) during the 1960 election
campaign, "We'll all make money on this deal."</TE>
<TE>   The younger, smarter Bobby (Tom Chalmers) is better equipped to be
president, but Papa Joe holds him back because he's not as well cast
for the role--at least, in terms of movie-star good looks--as his
brother.</TE>
<TE>   The show takes a while to build momentum, but it hits a high point
in the first act with a terrifically funny take on Jack's televised
debate against Republican nominee Richard M. Nixon. John Bigham keeps
his head lowered to make himself look jowly, and he sounds like the
real Nixon as he mops the sweat from his brow and generally falls
apart in front of America. This leads to a little ragtime number in
which he asks: "Why does everybody hate me? Why do I make babies
cry?"</TE>
<TE>   "Jack" looks great, dressed in crisp, straight-lined period
costumes by Ruth Silveira and Tara Keenan, and plays out against the
backdrop of a world map--the board upon which the Kennedy family
plays its little parlor games. Director Warren Coleman keeps the
action crackling with mordant humor.</TE>
<TE>   The real glory of the production, though, is its
impersonations--the sharpest coming from Machemer, with his dead-on,
JFK-like Brahmin accent; Amy Arnelle, with her surprising facial
similarities to the real Jackie; Bigham, with his scene-stealing
Nixon; and Ahmed A. Best as a hep-cat Sammy Davis Jr., who keeps
helping the Kennedys, only to be shoved aside when politically
expedient.</TE>
<TE>   The show doesn't entirely come into its own until about its last
15 minutes; just when things are getting fun, the show, abruptly, is
over. But then, that's just what happened with the Kennedy
presidency, isn't it?</TE>

<LD>   Kmart Bags Tabloid Trashing Stewart</LD>
<LD>   Kmart Corp., depending heavily on Martha Stewart products to help
it climb out of bankruptcy, pulled this week's issue of the Globe off
its shelves. The front-page headline in the tabloid paper reads,
"Mean Martha Stewart Exposed."</LD>
<TE>   Stewart has an exclusive partnership with the discount retailer,
selling a collection of bedsheets, kitchen accessories and closet
organizers.</TE>
<TE>   The Globe story quotes sources it claims had "sneak peeks" at the
book "Martha Inc.," a 350-page unauthorized biography that portrays
Stewart as a ruthless businesswoman who often exploited the loyalty
of her employees and family. The book, written by Christopher M.
Byron and published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, hits retailers' shelves
this week.</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Dowswell, a Kmart spokeswoman, confirmed that the issue of
the Globe was not available at Kmart stores but declined to say why.</TE>

<TE>   Brooks Makes Rio Offer Too Good to Refuse</TE>
<TE>   James L. Brooks, an executive producer of "The Simpsons," reacted
quickly to news that Rio de Janeiro was threatening to sue the Fox
network over what it perceived as a negative portrayal of the
Brazilian city on a recent episode of the animated series.</TE>
<TE>   "We apologize to the lovely city and people of Rio de Janeiro," he
said in a statement, "and if that doesn't settle the issue, Homer
Simpson offers to take on the president of Brazil on 'Fox Celebrity
Boxing.'"</TE>

<TE>   Drama 'The Shield' Loses More Sponsors</TE>
<TE>   "The Shield," FX's gritty new police drama based in Los Angeles,
has lost some advertisers. Anheuser-Busch and Tricon Global
Restaurants have joined Burger King, Office Depot and New Balance,
which pulled out last week.</TE>
<TE>   The companies didn't say why they withdrew, but the show, which
premiered March 12, has been criticized in some circles for its tough
language and violence.</TE>
<TE>   An FX spokesman said the Tuesday night series is still 75% sold
out for the first 13 weeks. "While a handful of advertisers have
opted out of the show, new ones have come in to replace them," he
said.</TE>

<TE>   Settlement Is Reached in Eminem Lawsuit</TE>
<TE>   Rapper Eminem has agreed to pay $100,000 to a man who filed a
civil lawsuit after the rap superstar allegedly pulled an unloaded
gun and hit him in the head and face outside a Michigan bar.</TE>
<TE>   The Grammy Award winner was said to be miffed because John Guerra,
28, had kissed Eminem's then-wife, Kim Mathers, in public two days
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The suit was filed shortly after the confrontation in June 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers III, pleaded guilty to
carrying a concealed weapon and is serving two years' probation on
the criminal charge.</TE>

<TE>   Crawford Compensated for Injuries in Vegas</TE>
<TE>   Michael Crawford has settled his lawsuit against the MGM Grand
hotel-casino in Las Vegas stemming from his appearance in the show
"EFX" there. Terms were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   The singer, who parlayed his fame from Broadway's "Phantom of the
Opera" into a $150,000-a-week role in the production, sued the resort
in 1998, saying injuries suffered while working on the show led to
him needing a hip replacement.</TE>

<LD>New this week: Bosnian writer-director Danis Tanovic's exceptional
debut feature, the Academy Award-winning "No Man's Land," is a savage
comedy about the war in the former Yugoslavia that artfully mixes
comic absurdism with a passion for what's right and a concern for the
individuality of all concerned. Events conspire to create a kind of
face-off between Ciki (Branko Djuric), a Bosnian soldier who wears a
T-shirt with the Rolling Stones tongue logo as part of his uniform,
and Nino (Rene Bitorajac), an inexperienced Serb newcomer, two
basically decent men. Frantic, skittish, mistrustful, each accuses
the other of acting badly, causing atrocities, starting the war
itself. Inevitably, this confusion comes to the attention of the
U.N.'s military force, and not far behind are the journalists,
typified by the Global News Service's Jane Livingstone (Katrin
Cartlidge). In a situation in which everyone acts badly, including
the U.N. and the self-serving media, "No Man's Land" doesn't spare
its wrath and makes sure that no party unfairly takes a hit.</LD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among the films screening in this year's "Method Fest" starting
Friday at the Playhouse 7 in Pasadena are two pictures that
impressively exemplify the festival's emphasis on acting. Carl
Bessai's "Lola" (Saturday at 7:30 p.m. and Monday at 2 p.m.) is an
intriguing take on the assumed identity plot. Sabrina Grdevich's Lola
is a scattered young Vancouver wife whose lack of self-confidence is
chronically worsened by her exacting, impatient husband (Colm Feore)
whom she seems never able to please. When she saves Sandra (Joanna
Going), a young woman in a blond wig, from being hit by a car, she
encounters a woman who is her complete opposite, indeed an apparent
prostitute used to living on the edge. They strike up an
acquaintance, and a drastic development propels Lola into an
adventure in self-discovery.</LD>
<TE>   "After Freedom" (Monday at 7 p.m. and Wednesday at 2 p.m.) is a
"Mean Streets" set in the prosperous boulevards of Glendale, which
has become home to a large Armenian community. Michael Abcarian (Mic
Tomasi) is the conflicted central figure in this taut, well-wrought
drama set in a tradition-minded ethnic community in which loyalties
can be as negative as they are positive. At 30ish, he feels
increasingly obligated to care for his widowed father, Leon (Greg
Satamian), who years ago gave up a good job with British Airways in
Soviet Armenia so that his children could grow up in a free country.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Leon has managed only to go from one menial job to
another, and Michael is getting nowhere as an assistant supermarket
manager because one of his pals, Mato (Ioannis Bogris) keeps
pilfering. Worse, Michael and Mato are in the thrall of Avo (Shant
Bejanian), a cynically manipulative older guy whose criminal impulses
are escalating.</TE>
<TE>   "After Freedom" engrossingly charts the increasing pressures upon
Michael that could either liberate or destroy him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Screening Friday at 7:30 p.m. in LACMA's "Out of India: The Films
of Satyajit Ray" is "The Music Room" (1958), one of Ray's finest
films, a superb study of the decline of an impoverished nobleman
whose abiding passion is to hold costly, lengthy recitals of
classical Indian music in his decaying mansion. Ray views his
obsolete mandarin (Chabi Biswas, the patriarch in "Kanchenjungha") as
a tragic figure, a victim of his overweening pride and the inevitable
crumbling of his princely way of life in a time of change. Biswas
makes this arrogant, selfish aristocrat's obsession seem a grand
folly and not mere frivolity, thus inspiring compassion rather than
contempt. "The Music Room" and the second feature, "Company Limited"
(1971), will be screened with prints restored by the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Archive. (323) 857-6010.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Screening Saturday at 9:45 p.m. at the Music Hall in the 18th
annual Israel Film Festival is Benny Torati's "Desperado Square,"
which takes its title from a derelict plaza in a rundown Tel Aviv
neighborhood similar to the Hatkiva district where the first-time
feature director was raised. When a former theater exhibitor dies,
his younger son Nissim (Nir Levy) has a dream that he takes as a
signal to reopen the long-closed theater and decides it should screen
its most popular film, "Sangam," a florid 1964 Hindi film starring
the beloved Raj Kapoor.</TE>
<TE>   Avraham (Mohammad Bakri), the uncle of Nissim, and his older
brother George (Sharon Rejeano), who left when the theater closed,
return for the funeral. His arrival and the idea of screening
"Sangam" dismays his sister-in-law Seniora (Yona Elian) for reasons
her sons do not understand.</TE>
<TE>   What becomes clear is that not only does the plot of "Sangam"
parallel events surrounding Avraham's departure but also that
"Desperado Square" has been made in affectionate emulation of popular
Indian cinema in which emotion-charged melodrama has been intercut
with broad, corny comic relief and substantial musical
interludes--handily, a lot of the action takes place in a local
nightclub. "Desperado Square" attests to the worldwide potency of
often primitive genre movies--spaghetti westerns and Italian
sword-and-sandal muscleman epics as well as long-winded Hollywood
potboilers. Those who can go along with Torati's homage, which tends
to be as awkward as the Indian originals it salutes, might be
surprised to find "Desperado Square" does a bit of effective
heart-tugging. "Desperado Square" will be repeated at the Music Hall
and at the Town Center 5 in Encino. (877) 966-5566.</TE>

<TE>   The Laemmle Theaters' "Documentary Days 2002" continues Saturday
and Sunday at 10 a.m. at the Sunset 5 with Gayle Ferraro's revealing
and encouraging "Sixteen Decisions." Its title refers to a social
charter for a Utopian community with precepts regarding respect for
the environment, the importance of sanitation and hygiene and
harmonious and mutually supportive community life. Instead it is a
manifesto established by the progressive Grameen Bank of Bangladesh,
founded by Dr. Muhammad Yunus, a socially conscious visionary who
believed that poor people could be good credit risks and that
receiving additional income of less than a dollar a day could
transform someone's life.</TE>
<TE>   Ferraro focuses on young Selina, a mother of two boys, ages 4 and
5, who has just joined a group of women in her rural village who have
formed a collective to receive small loans from Grameen to buy
livestock, open a tiny store or make improvements to their homes.
Regular payments on the loans as agreed upon are mandatory if a woman
is to stay a member of the collective. Selina has joined to obtain a
loan so her husband can buy a rickshaw rather than rent one at high
cost. Selina's parents were so impoverished that they sold her at the
age of 7 into virtual slavery in a wealthy family; she was married at
12. In telling Selina's story sensitively, Ferraro discovers how the
oppressive condition of Bangladeshi women is changing through the
Grameen bank's program. "Sixteen Decisions" screens Saturdays and
Sundays at 11 a.m. April 20-21 at the Monica 4-Plex, (310) 394-9741;
April 27-28 at the Playhouse 7, (626) 844-6500; and May 11-13 at the
Lido, (949) 673-8351.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This year's "City of Lights, City of Angels" festival concludes
Sunday at 8 p.m. with "Chaos," followed by a Q&amp;A session with its
director, Coline Serreau, best known for the blithe comedy "Three Men
and a Cradle," successfully remade in Hollywood as "Three Men and a
Baby." There's lots of humor in this picture, but it is far more
serious and lots bolder than a tale about three swinging bachelors
who have an infant thrust upon them. A beautiful Algerian-born
prostitute (Rachida Brakni) in Paris' gamy Pigalle district, begs a
well-dressed couple (Catherine Frot, Vincent Lindon) to open the door
of their expensive car, but the husband refuses. Later, the wife sees
the light and seeks out the prostitute, an act that completely upends
her life and allows Serreau to skewer the low status of women in Arab
culture, the sense of entitlement of privileged men and the
self-absorption rampant in modern life. With the great Line Renaud as
Lindon's neglected but uncomplaining mother, this is an ambitious and
entertaining film that sustains its 109-minute running time, normally
long for a comedy. (323) 651-4119.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Opening a regular run Friday at the Fairfax Cinemas, Geoff
Cunningham's "Rocky Road" is a well-meaning but overly preachy and
heavy-handed account of the hostility confronting a young interracial
couple, Talia and John, played by the attractive and capable Nicole
Smith and Will Wallace, real-life spouses. Opposition is intense from
John's father, a brutal, racist cop, and from Talia's brother and
sister, intent on breaking up the romance because John is white.
(323) 655-4010.</TE>

<LD>"Just Shoot Me" may not aim for any kind of high-minded TV
breakthrough, but in its sixth season it still hits the humorous mark
with its gently cynical take on relationships, vanity and office
politics.</LD>
<LD>   The Blush magazine staff gets a dose of corporate therapy in
tonight's episode (9:30 p.m. NBC), written by Brian Reich and
directed by Pam Fryman.</LD>
<LD>   Playing herself, New York handbag designer Kate Spade (real-life
sister-in-law of series co-star David Spade) visits the fashion
magazine to discuss a promotional campaign, but the staff's rude
antics scare her away.</LD>
<TE>   Publisher Jack (George Segal) hires New Age therapist Drake "Dr.
Drake" Kelson (guest star Stephen Root, the bumbling boss from
"NewsRadio") to help the hostile staff achieve harmony.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Drake manipulates Finch (Spade), Nina (Wendie Malick) and Maya
(Laura San Giacomo) with mindless psychobabble, but Elliott (Enrico
Colantoni) grows suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   All the more so when Dr. Drake makes him lean forward on one leg
and twirl his arms like windmills, a supposed relaxation technique
from Nepal.</TE>
<TE>   When Elliott confronts Dr. Drake, the quack concocts a scheme to
get him fired.</TE>
<TE>   If you expect this all to end warmly with a group hug, you're

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the entertaining DVD of "Spy Game" (Universal, $20), the CIA
espionage thriller starring Hollywood golden boys Robert Redford and
Brad Pitt, director Tony Scott spills the beans on how the two actors
work at their craft.</LD>
<LD>   Scott, the colorful brother of Ridley, explains on the digital
edition that Redford comes totally prepared for the day's work; the
actor knows his character inside and out. On the other hand, says
Scott, Pitt arrives on the set prepared but eager to improvise and
try new things if he feels the character or the scene warrants it.</LD>
<LD>   Despite their diverse acting styles, the two superstars and
friends--Redford directed Pitt a decade ago in "A River Runs Through
It"--worked well together.</LD>
<TE>   Highlights of the disc include deleted and alternate scenes
complete with Scott's commentary, a look at how Scott uses
storyboards in making his films, a list of requirements for
acceptance into the CIA, trailers, talent files, commentary with
producers Marc Abraham and Douglas Wick and commentary from Scott.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the disc is a feature called "Clandestine OPS." Each
time an icon appears on screen, viewers can click on it to watch
several interesting mini-documentaries on the making of the film.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Director Peter Chelsom is a delightful, charming guide through the
digital version of his romantic comedy "Serendipity" (Miramax, $30),
starring John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale as two strangers destined to
be together who meet cute at Bloomingdale's during Christmas. Jeremy
Piven, Eugene Levy and John Corbett also star in the farce that never
really realizes its potential.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD features 16 minutes of deleted scenes, which should be
viewed after watching the movie. In his commentary, Chelsom explains
that after the filming was completed, he re-shot the three opening
scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Those pivotal sequences were filmed before the chemistry between
Cusack and Beckinsale was really established. Chelsom realized that
the actors appeared nervous and thought re-shooting those sequences
would make the film stronger. His decision was correct. In the
deleted scenes, Cusack and Beckinsale make an attractive couple, but
there isn't much of a spark between them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Skulls," a thriller from 2000 about a secret and deadly
college fraternity, didn't exactly attract the attention of critics
and audiences. But that fact hasn't stopped Universal from producing
a made-for-video sequel, "The Skulls II" (VHS is priced for rental:
$27 for DVD). "Skulls II" is quite numbing. The original at least
starred Joshua Jackson from "Dawson's Creek."</TE>
<TE>   The sequel is peppered with a lot of attractive but boring
unknowns--Robin Dunne, Nathan West and Ashley Lyn Cafagna. This time
around, when new member of the Skulls (Dunne) sees a woman murdered
within the walls of the group's private chambers, he finds his life
is in jeopardy</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Nude Set" (First Run, $25 for VHS; $30 for DVD) was probably
considered pretty racy when it was released in 1960. But the French
farce is pretty tame and quaint in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Agnes Laurent, who is described as "the new French love kitten,"
stars in this hoot about a young girl from the provinces who
convinces her wealthy parents to allow her to study art in Paris, so
she can continue her romance with a handsome young doctor.</TE>
<TE>   When she arrives in Paris, she discovers that her boyfriend loves
to go to a strip club where he has romanced several of the young
performers. Before you can say "oo-la-la," she goes from observer to
performer in the club.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Also new from First Run is the fascinating documentary "The Man
Who Bought Mustique" ($60 for VHS; $30 for DVD) from British
filmmakers Joseph Bullman and Vikram Jayanti. In 1956, Scottish Lord
Glenconner bought the tiny Caribbean island paradise of Mustique and
ended up transforming it into a playground for the rich and famous.
Visitors included the late Princess Margaret, Mick Jagger and David
Bowie. By the late '70s, Glenconner ran out of money and lost control
of his land. He moved to nearby St. Lucia, where he operates a
popular restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   The 78-minute documentary, which is alternately funny, shocking
and sad, follows Glenconner as he returns to Mustique for the first
time in a decade. Director Bullman captures Glenconner, warts and
all, as he berates his family and friends, verbally abuses the
filmmakers and treats his help as if they were slaves.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For sheer fun, check out "Flash Gordon: The Peril From Planet
Mongo" (Image, $20) starring Buster Crabbe. A feature-length edited
version of Chapters 7 through 12 of the 1940 serial, "Flash Gordon
Conquers the Universe," this zippy action-adventure finds Flash, Dale
Arden and Dr. Zarkov returning to the planet Mongo on a special
mission for their friend Barin, whose kingdom of Arboria is being
threatened by Emperor Ming's heat projectiles.</TE>
<TE>   A sharp script, gorgeous production design, perfect performances
and fast-paced direction make it a must-see for "Flash Gordon" fans.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The pedestrian 1995 Sandra Bullock vehicle "The Net," in which she
plays a computer expert whose identity is erased by an evil computer
conspiracy, makes its special edition DVD bow (Columbia TriStar,
$25).</TE>
<TE>   The disc is better than the thriller deserves. Included are a new
wide-screen transfer; the HBO documentary "Inside the Net"; a new
documentary, "The Net From Script to Screen"; talent files;
serviceable commentary from director Irwin Winkler and producer Rob
Cowan; and an amusing commentary track with writers John Brancanto
and Michael Ferris.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The same week it premiered on A&amp;E, "Shackleton" arrives on VHS
($40) and DVD ($60) from A&amp;E Home Video.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Branagh stars in the handsome miniseries about British
explorer Ernest Shackleton, who set out for the South Pole in 1914
only to have his ship, the Endurance, trapped by ice. An incredible
adventure ensues as he tries to save his crew from their freezing
surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   The three-disc DVD sets includes a comprehensive "making of"
documentary, the Shackleton episode of A&amp;E's "Biography" series and
the History Channel's two-hour documentary, "Antarctica: A Frozen
History."</TE>

<HD>The Musical Moods of Robben Ford</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robben Ford, the gentle blues hero who has called Ojai home for
several years, has been busy recording and touring recently. A
veteran of bands led by Joni Mitchell, Miles Davis and George
Harrison--and long a leader in his own right--Ford makes one of his
homecoming visits Saturday, headlining a show at the Ventura Theater,
along with the bluesy groove sound of Derek Trucks.</LD>
<LD>   The Robben Ford bin in music stores has two new entries,
showcasing different sides of his musical persona. "Blue Moon," his
first project on the Concord label, is a juicy, colorfully produced
new vocal album, with Ford singing in his unpretentious style and
playing guitar with his usual tasteful fire. The album's musician
list includes the Yellowjackets' Russell Ferrante on piano (who was
on Ford's debut album in the late 1970s), nimble drummer Vinnie
Colaiuta and a cameo by Ojai's Julie Christensen, purring on the
slow-brewing "Make Me Your Only One."</LD>
<TE>   Off in the more instrumental corner of the music scene, Ford is
also at the center of a subtle "power trio" session with Colaiuta and
bassist Jimmy Haslip--another player on Ford's debut album--on his
new "Jing Chi," released on the Bay Area guitar-oriented label Tone
Center. If "Blue Moon" is all about integrating instruments and
vocals, and different variations of the blues idiom, then "Jing Chi"
is all about three musicians indulging in clean-burning playing,
dishing out heated improvisation and collective energy.</TE>
<TE>   Take your pick: Both albums abound in the signature
musicality--off to the side of blues, jazz and pop--that Ford has
fashioned into his own artistic domain.</TE>
<TE>   Robben Ford with Derek Trucks, Saturday at Ventura Theater, 26 S.
Chestnut St., 8 p.m. $22 to $32. (805) 653-0118.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Theater of Struggle: Henrik Ibsen's tough-skinned and rarely seen
play "Ghosts" will have a monthlong run at the Ojai Art Center
Theater starting this weekend. This Ibsen play is one of his realist
works, alongside "A Doll's House" and "An Enemy of the People,"
exploring social hypocrisy and repressed emotion. Twisted lines are
drawn between family members, which include a womanizing alcoholic
and his similarly inclined son along with their wife/mother, who
suffers the sins of her male counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Jesse Lovejoy, the play's cast includes Catherine
Dain, Arnold William Geer, Ron Rowe and Brook Masters.</TE>
<TE>   "Ghosts," Ojai Art Center Theater, 113 S. Montgomery St.  Fridays
and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends May 12. $12 general; $10
for senior citizens and Art Center members. (805) 640-8797.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Convergence: Classical music and theater converge in the next
production of the Rubicon Theater's season, "Old Wicked Songs," which
is being presented in association with the Ventura Chamber Music
Festival, May 2-12.</TE>
<TE>   A Pulitzer Prize finalist written by Jon Marans, directed here by
frequent Rubicon artist Jenny Sullivan, the play is a two-character
tete-a-tete starring Harold Gould and Joseph Fuqua, who portray an
imperious Austrian music teacher and his young American pianist
protege, respectively. Between them, skeletons are coaxed from
closets and tensions flare up, all to the tune of Robert Schumann's
song cycle "Dichterliebe."</TE>
<TE>   * "Old Wicked Songs," at Rubicon Theatre Co., 1006 E. Main St.,
Suite 300, Ventura. Wednesdays to Saturdays, 8 p.m.; matinees
Saturdays and Sundays, 2 p.m. $21 to $38. Saturday to May 19. (805)
667-2900.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the Bach Beat: Bach had his notable celebration two years ago,
the 250th anniversary of his death in 1750, but his music is always
timely. This weekend, a Bach Festival brings the music of the great
composer to the campus of Cal Lutheran. The festival, with scholarly
discussions and musical events, includes an organ concert Saturday
night in Samuelson Chapel by noted organist Martin Jean. Sunday
afternoon, "St. John Passion" will be performed in the chapel,
featuring tenor Christopher Cock.</TE>
<TE>   * Bach Festival, Saturday and Sunday at Cal Lutheran University,
60 W. Olsen Road, Thousand Oaks. (805) 493-3305.</TE>

<HD>Haim Cohen, 91; High Court Justice in Israel, Champion of
Rights</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Haim Cohen, a former Israeli Supreme Court justice and a human rights
advocate, died Wednesday in Jerusalem. He was 91.</LD>
<LD>   Cohen was the first president of the Assn. of Civil Rights in
Israel, one of the nation's leading human rights organizations, a
position he assumed after retiring in 1981 after 21 years as a
Supreme Court justice.</LD>
<LD>   Many of his most notable decisions as a justice were minority
opinions on human rights issues.</LD>
<TE>   In one case, he disagreed with the court majority, arguing for the
right of an extremist party tied to Arab militants to run for the
parliament. Later, his view was adopted in the opposite context, when
a party founded by Jewish extremist Rabbi Meir Kahane was permitted
to run.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, in one of his last dissenting opinions, Cohen argued
against the right of the government to expel Palestinian activists
from the West Bank and Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the conscience of this country," said Judge Hadassah
Ben-Itto, president of the International Assn. of Jewish Lawyers and
Jurists, which Cohen helped found.</TE>
<TE>   A member of many legal and human rights organizations, Cohen was
Israel's U.N. representative for human rights and served as a member
of the World Court at The Hague.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen wrote five books, including "The Trial and Death of Jesus."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Luebeck, Germany, Cohen studied at a Jewish seminary in
Hamburg before going to Israel in 1930. He later returned to Germany
to study law at Frankfurt University before opening his own law
practice in Jerusalem in 1937.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen was buried in Jerusalem on Wednesday.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Morris Wosk, 84, a Ukrainian immigrant who became one of western
Canada's leading businessmen and philanthropists, died Tuesday in Las
Vegas of heart failure.</LD>
<LD>   Wosk estimated that he gave away the equivalent of $30 million in
U.S. dollars in his lifetime to institutions ranging from Simon
Fraser University in British Columbia to Hebrew University in
Jerusalem. He was a longtime member of the Board of Trustees of the
Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Odessa, Ukraine, then part of Russia, he fled with his
family to Canada in 1928 to escape rising anti-Semitic persecution.</LD>
<TE>   At 15 he quit school to work with his father and brother as street
peddlers with a horse and cart, acquiring secondhand goods to repair
and resell.</TE>
<TE>   In 1932, the Wosk family rented a storefront and set up shop, the
first of what became a 12-store chain in British Columbia and
Alberta.</TE>
<TE>   With his brother he founded Wosk's department stores, one of
Vancouver's top retailers in the 1940s, '50s and '60s. After
splitting from his brother, he became a real estate mogul and owned
several well-known hotels and apartment complexes in Vancouver.</TE>

<LD>Nancy Ann Holman, 66, the first woman Superior Court judge in
Washington state, died Sunday at her Seattle home of complications
from a stroke she suffered in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Adams, Mass., Holman graduated from Wheaton College and
earned her law degree at the Boston College law school. She went to
work as a trial and appellate lawyer in Boston in 1959 before moving
to Seattle, where she joined a law firm specializing in construction,
product liability, personal injury and divorce cases.</LD>
<LD>   In 1970 she was named by then-Gov. Dan Evans to the King County
Superior Court bench in Seattle. Since then, 75 women have been
Superior Court, Appeals Court and state Supreme Court judges in
Washington.</LD>
<TE>   She taught at the University of Puget Sound Law School, now the
Seattle University Law School, as well as at the University of Nevada
and Boston College Law School. She retired from the bench in 1997.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Annalee Davis Thorndike, 87, the New Englander who made the
hand-painted collectible dolls that bear her first name, died Sunday
in Meredith, N.H. The cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   Thorndike began making the one-of-a-kind, poseable dolls after
graduating from high school in 1933. At first she sold them for store
displays and business advertising, including New Hampshire's first
tourism campaign.</LD>
<LD>   When her husband's poultry egg business began to falter in the
early 1950s, the couple decided to turn doll-making into a full-time
business.</LD>
<TE>   The Annalee factory became one of the area's largest employers,
with 250 to 300 workers. A downturn in the collectibles market,
however, led the company to move most of its manufacturing to China.</TE>
<TE>   Thorndike was awarded the Collectibles and Gift Industry Pioneer
Award in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Meredith is home to the Annalee Doll Museum, established in 1983,
and holds a festival for collectors each summer.</TE>

<HD>Along the Canals, Summer Party Never Ends</HD>
<DH>Immune from many urban woes, Naples residents enjoy boat
races, cookouts, gondola rides and a long tradition of neighborly
fun.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even past combatants admit that the water fights of Naples got out of
hand. Boaters cruised the canals and hurled water balloons onto the
patio parties above them. Partygoers retaliated with garden hoses.</LD>
<LD>   "Kids would go up on the bridges and dump buckets of water down on
unsuspecting boaters," said Dr. Rick Adams, a physician in his 40s
who used to take part.</LD>
<LD>   By nightfall, revelers would quaff enough beer, wine and
margaritas to sink a cargo ship. Fun? Like a pillow fight while your
parents are sleeping. Like sneaking out the window to go dancing. Fun
hardly began to describe it, unless you showed up unprepared to get
wet. Which was, said Adams, part of the problem: "Not everyone knew
about the tradition of water fights on the Fourth of July."</LD>
<TE>   A crackdown by patrol boats has muted the water wars on the Naples
canals, but the canal people still manage to enjoy life pretty much
all year-round. Like some chosen tribe, immune from the urban woes of
greater Los Angeles, these Long Beach residents are blessed with
money and--imagine it--good times too.</TE>
<TE>   They are forever holding kayak races, swim races and regattas.
They run their skiffs up and down Alamitos Bay and take their yachts
to Newport Beach and Santa Catalina Island.</TE>
<TE>   Any time the weather is nice--and mostly it is--they fill the
weekends with cocktail parties and cookouts on the brick patios
lining the canals. Some begin on sunlit afternoons, with breezes
pushing at the weather vanes, and end at night with flames leaping
from the fire pits.</TE>
<TE>   At Christmas, the homes are festooned with so many lights the
canals almost shimmer. Thousands of people come down to stroll the
waterways. The annual boat parade consists of craft small enough to
fit under the canal bridges: electric boats, dinghies, kayaks and ski
boats, all strung with lights. Miniature barges carry high school
bands.</TE>
<TE>   The Neptunes, a group of free-divers, slip into wetsuits and
endure the chilly waters to push around a segmented dragon: a Loch
Ness-like monster that spouts flames from its butane-fed mouth. The
divers number from two dozen to four dozen, and they take turns
abandoning the dragon to beg for beer and cocktails at the crowded
docks.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll start barking like seals," Adams said. "If you don't give
them something, they'll splash you."</TE>
<TE>   Stan Poe remembered watching the parade with a woman who confused
the Neptunes with the Neptune Society, a separate organization that
scatters human remains at sea. She watched the dragon's impressive
flame and expected to see someone cremated.</TE>
<TE>   Poe laughed. He has pushed the float himself and said the effort
is rather informal.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, one of my neighbors just jumped in [and helped]," Poe
said. "He didn't even know anybody. Just swam around and drank."</TE>
<TE>   Poe, 56, a teacher who swims every day in the canals, is the
Naples historian, the author of a pictorial history that shows the
canals when home lots sold for $900 to $4,000. Those prices have
inflated in 99 years by roughly three more zeroes. A tear-down goes
for close to $1 million. Larger homes command $4 million and up.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was to build an Italian paradise," Poe said. "Oh, it
worked."</TE>
<TE>   Land barons Harry Huntington and Arthur M. Parsons envisioned the
canals in 1903, the same year similar development was started up the
coast in Venice, Poe said. The Venice canals were beset by early
financial problems and never overcame the poor tidal flow that
rendered much of them a dirty backwater. Naples, while not as well
known, evolved into a hidden jewel, part of a tiny island near the
border of Long Beach and Seal Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Two canals provide a mile or so of waterfront: Naples Canal, which
divides Naples Island from Treasure Island, and the longer Rivo Alto
Canal, which runs in a circle through Naples under a series of
roadway bridges. Originally, said Poe, no cars were allowed on the
island. Second Street, now the heart of nearby Belmont Shore, began
as a canal. Other streets still bear deliberately pedestrian names:
Riviera Walk, Savona Walk, Via Di Roma Walk.</TE>
<TE>   "What they ended up with," said Poe, "was a really tight little
community." Early residents could get mail without even using
addresses. A name and "Naples" were enough for delivery. Single-story
cottages have given way to two-story showcases of various
styles--Mediterranean, Cape Cod, Victorian, storybook, modern--but
the people, or their children, have generally stayed.</TE>
<TE>   "I was at a party yesterday," Poe said, "and everybody had roots
back into the '20s." His wife, Maureen, recently had hip surgery, and
various neighbors have come by with food every day. "We haven't had
to cook since Feb. 28."</TE>
<TE>   There are summer concerts on the Colonnade, the greenbelt joining
the main canal entrance with a central fountain. Residents volunteer
to help run the Naples Improvement Assn., which raises money with an
annual pancake breakfast. Many families could afford to send their
children to the finest private schools, but they tend to funnel them
into Wilson High, the nearby public campus, because it's where they
went.</TE>
<TE>   "Growing up in the canals--it was one of the most incredible
playgrounds you could have," said Michael O'Toole, who played for the
Wilson water polo team. He remembered when the team used to hold
summer workouts in the canals, putting a goal on each wall and
keeping an eye out for boats. "That led to ball tag, jumping off the
sea walls, illegally jumping off the bridges."</TE>
<TE>   O'Toole and his friend David Black took the roses out of an old
Pakistani fishing boat that had become a planter and started giving
gondola rides through the canals in 1982. At first they had no
business license or official location. They'd get messages on an
answering machine and make arrangements to pick up people at their
own docks.</TE>
<TE>   Now the company, Gondola Getaway, has 10 boats, 35 employees and
hauls about 60,000 people a year through the canals, feeding them
cheese and salami, letting them bring wine, and serenading them with
Italian opera songs. O'Toole and Black travel every year to gondola
races in Venice, Italy, and prepare for that event by holding their
own regatta in Naples.</TE>
<TE>   Dinghies, kayaks, gondolas, outriggers and English racing sculls,
any kind of hand-powered craft you can bring, all compete
side-by-side. Between 100 and 200 boats are expected to race through
the canals on May 4.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a sense of craziness out there," said O'Toole, who
launches the race with the blast of a tiny cannon. "There's a
festival-type feeling."</TE>
<TE>   The hourlong gondola rides operate day and night. A lot of couples
spend the $65 to celebrate engagements, weddings, anniversaries.
"Under a bridge, with a full moon and a bottle of champagne-- that's
hard to beat," O'Toole boasted.</TE>
<TE>   Joanne Dalis was treating her husband, Don, one recent afternoon
for his birthday. They had spent the night at a bed-and-breakfast in
Seal Beach, and Joanne had driven Don to a spa for a massage before
departing in the gondola. Drifting through the canals, on a placid,
flawless spring afternoon, they sipped a cabernet and listened to
opera on the gondolier's CD player.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful experience, I've got to tell you," Don, a 40-ish
stockbroker, said later. "And it's all hand-powered. I thought there
was an engine, like a Disneyland ride."</TE>

<HD>Randy Tufts, 53; Discovered Kartchner Cave Complex</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a cloudy day in November 1974, Randy Tufts and a friend pushed
aside some rocks, squeezed their way into a tiny hole in the
mountains of the Arizona desert and stumbled on a pot of gold, of
sorts.</LD>
<LD>   At a time when discovering anything new in the well-trodden West
was nearly impossible, Tufts and his roommate, Gary Tenen, went home
that evening not realizing they had found the entrance to one of the
nation's most extravagant cave complexes.</LD>
<LD>   And that's only half the story.</LD>
<TE>   Tufts, who unearthed Kartchner Caverns and contributed to
groundbreaking research on Jupiter's moon Europa, died April 1 in
Tucson of a rare blood disorder. He was 53.</TE>
<TE>   Tufts was best known for his conservation ethic and a sense of
wonder about the natural world that seemed to grow as he got older.
"I don't know many people who made major geological discoveries both
on Earth and in space," said Peter Zimmerman, a longtime friend.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Tucson, Tufts fell in love with spelunking while in
high school, where he announced to friends his intention to discover
a major new cave. Soon, a miner provided Tufts with a vague tip:
Somewhere in the Whetstone Mountains east of Tucson there was an
interesting sinkhole, and maybe a cave.</TE>
<TE>   After earning a bachelor's degree in geology at the University of
Arizona, Tufts and his roommates--whom he took spelunking--often
pored over geologic maps of the Arizona desert. Tufts was certain he
could find a new cave by identifying areas with certain types of
limestone and then exploring them inch by inch.</TE>
<TE>   "We were doing grid searches," said Tenen. "We'd walk back and
forth over ridges and hills; we'd go in a canyon and Randy would take
one side and I'd take another."</TE>
<TE>   While exploring a sinkhole with Tenen in November 1974, Tufts
caught a whiff of bat guano from a small fissure. They crawled into
the opening, but hesitated. No one knew where they were. No one could
help if they got stuck.</TE>
<TE>   So they went back the next weekend with friends. Reaching the
cave's interior required squeezing through a 10-inch hole and then
navigating a long, narrow tunnel covered in guano.</TE>
<TE>   Over subsequent months, they pushed deeper into the 21/2-mile
cavern. While nowhere near the size of the world's longest
cavern--Mammoth Caves in Kentucky is 348 miles long--they found three
huge chambers; long, pencil-thin stalactites called soda straws, and
other strange features. The cave's humidity was more than 99% and
water was percolating down from the surface. Formations were still
growing.</TE>
<TE>   They gave the cave the code name Xanadu. Only a few select friends
were told, fearing that if word leaked out, the cave would be trashed
by vandals and others simply eager to explore.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't take us long to become hermetic about it," said Tufts
in a 2000 interview with the Irish Times. "We seldom even used the
'cave' word. We were obsessively secretive. We were known among
cavers in Arizona for hiking in that region, and just the idea that
people might know we'd found something--well, they'd probably know
the whereabouts straight away."</TE>
<TE>   Despite having no money, Tufts and Tenen hired a real estate agent
to inquire about buying the land, which was part of a family ranch
dating back to the state's pioneer days. The owner didn't want to
sell.</TE>
<TE>   Tufts and Tenen arranged a meeting with James Kartchner, the
family patriarch, in 1978. First they showed him photos of another
Arizona cave that had been vandalized. Then they showed him photos of
the cave beneath his property.</TE>
<TE>   Kartchner was amazed. All his life--he was then in his 70s--he had
galloped across the ranch on horseback thinking the ground often
sounded hollow.</TE>
<TE>   The Kartchners agreed to keep the cave a secret while Tufts and
Tenen figured out a way to permanently protect it. "We took the
perspective that the decisions we made had to endure for hundreds of
years," Tenen said.</TE>
<TE>   After an initial attempt to interest Arizona State Parks in the
cave was met with indifference, Tufts got word of their find to the
state's governor, Bruce Babbitt, who had degrees in geology and
geophysics.</TE>
<TE>   Early one morning in 1985, Babbitt slipped away from his work and
secretly visited the cave, which led to the state's purchase of the
cavern from the Kartchners in 1988. Eleven years later, the cave was
opened to the public after a long, and sometimes contentious
process--with Tufts the primary watchdog--about how best to build a
tunnel and lighting system that would allow tourists to visit while
preserving the cave's delicate ecosystem.</TE>
<TE>   Kartchner Caverns now attracts 180,000 visitors a year, with many
lining up each day at 4 a.m. to buy tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Tufts had long worked in community development, but in the
mid-1980s he took a 14-month trip around the world. During that time
he read about Europa, the fourth largest of Jupiter's moons, and
became intrigued.</TE>
<TE>   "He heard it had an icy surface with an ocean under the ice, and
he was interested in the possibility there may be life there," said
Richard Greenberg, a professor of planetary sciences at the
University of Arizona. "So, he repeated what he did with caves and
went back to school."</TE>
<TE>   Tufts began studying under Greenberg, who was a member of the
imaging team for Galileo, the NASA spacecraft that reached the Jovian
system in 1995. By studying photos of Europa, Tufts discovered a
500-mile-long fault called Astypalaea Linea, which resembled the San
Andreas fault. Tufts also determined that the fault appeared to have
been caused by tidal stress and that the cracks in the moon's surface
probably extend to an ocean below.</TE>
<TE>   Other evidence found by the Galileo mission has strongly suggested
the existence of a Europan ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Tufts--he earned his doctorate in geosciences at the age of
50--became increasingly concerned that a spacecraft that landed or
crashed on Europa could introduce organisms that would inadvertently
wipe out any life that was there.</TE>
<TE>   Much as he did with the cave, Tufts buckled down and got to work,
this time writing papers about the stewardship and preservation of a
place millions of miles from home.</TE>
<TE>   Tufts is survived by his wife, Ericha Scott; mother Carol Tufts;
and sister Judy Rodin. A memorial service is planned for Sunday in
Tucson. Donations can be sent to the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society,
Suite E-100, 2990 E. Northern Ave., Phoenix, AZ, 85028.</TE>

<HD>Yu Chi-chung, 92; China Times Founder Offended Nationalist
Party of Taiwan</HD>

<LD>Yu Chi-chung, founding publisher of the China Times, a leading
Taiwanese newspaper, has died. He was 92.</LD>
<LD>   Yu died Tuesday at his home in Taipei after a long battle with
liver and colon cancer, said James Tu of the China Times Group.</LD>
<LD>   Now one of Taiwan's top three news organizations, the group also
includes the Commercial Times business daily, the evening China Times
Express, a weekly news magazine and a book publishing company.</LD>
<TE>   Born in mainland China, Yu studied at what are now Nanjing and
Southeastern Universities and the London School of Economics and
Political Science. During World War II, he served as an aide to a top
Chinese general. At the end of the war, he participated in diplomatic
talks to recover Manchuria from the occupying Soviets.</TE>
<TE>   Yu started a small newspaper, the Sino-Soviet Daily, in 1946 in
what is now Shenyang. But he fled the mainland along with Gen. Chiang
Kai-shek and other Nationalist Chinese who settled in Taiwan as China
came under Communist control in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Yu founded his newspaper, then called the Credit
Information and produced it on a mimeograph machine. He sold only six
copies the first day. The paper received its current name in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak in the early 1980s, the China Times had a circulation
of more than 1 million, and, in 1982, Yu created a U.S. edition of
his newspaper with publication in New York and in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his membership on the Nationalist Party's policymaking
Central Standing Committee, Yu could not protect his more-liberal
American edition from political scrutiny and was forced to close it
in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Yu and his American edition first got into trouble over coverage
of the Olympics that summer in Los Angeles, where the paper had a
circulation of 10,000.</TE>
<TE>   Mainland China sent athletes for the first time and won 15 gold
medals. Most Taiwan news media downplayed the victories by the
Communist Chinese, but Yu provided full front-page coverage.</TE>
<TE>   His colleagues on the Standing Committee accused him of "making
propaganda for the Communist bandits."</TE>
<TE>   The second problem was an editorial in the China Times of America
criticizing President Reagan and the Republican Party platform.
Nationalist Chinese leaders, who favored Reagan's China policies,
accused the paper of "hurting Sino-American relations."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. edition was closed, official Taiwan spokesmen insisted,
because of economic difficulties. But diplomats and Chinese
journalists agreed the Nationalist Party silenced it.</TE>
<TE>   When the Democratic Progressive Party was formed in Taiwan in
1986, Yu defied another of his government's bans by providing full
coverage in the China Times. In 2000, the party's President Chen
Shui-bian saluted Yu as "a helmsman of Taiwan's democracy."</TE>
<TE>   The publisher, who retired only last fall after turning the China
Times over to his son, Yu Chien-hsin, is survived by his wife of 60
years, the former Tsai Yu-hui; four children; and eight
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>An Enron 'Elixir' Would Try to Cure What Doesn't Ail Us</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HARRIS N. MILLER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A wag once said that for every challenge, there is a solution that is
simple, straightforward--and wrong.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, that seems to be the case in the congressional
response to the Enron collapse. And the worst example of a wrong
solution to Enron is the Levin-McCain bill on stock options.</LD>
<LD>   Proposed in the Senate by Michigan Democrat Carl Levin and Arizona
Republican John McCain, the bill would require the stock option tax
deduction to be reflected as an expense on a company's income
statement, reducing reported profit. It would have the harmful effect
of limiting the use of stock options, a form of employee ownership,
for all but the most senior executives.</LD>
<TE>   Levin-McCain takes away the incentive for companies to encourage
employee stock ownership, a practice that Congress and other
provisions of federal tax law have tried to promote. Never mind that
the tax on stock options is paid by the individual employee who
receives the benefit and usually at a higher rate than the company
would pay. If either the financial or tax costs of offering stock
options to employees is increased, as happens with Levin-McCain,
companies will be forced to limit option grants.</TE>
<TE>   A 1999 study by the human resources consulting firm William M.
Mercer found that 17% of large public companies offer stock options
to most or all of their employees. Although it is mostly associated
with technology and Internet companies, the practice goes well
beyond. Warehouse stores, publishing houses and restaurants offer
this popular benefit, which has allowed employees at even the lowest
levels to benefit from the hard work they contribute to their
employers. Levin-McCain would effectively end it in publicly traded
companies and many private companies as well.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Levin-McCain is being touted as an elixir to cure the
problems caused by Enron. But stock options are not what brought down
Enron and caused thousands of employees to lose their retirement
savings. The collapse of Enron is entirely unrelated to the method of
accounting or taxation of stock options. The Enron debacle was caused
by improper accounting for special-purpose entities and corporate
policies relating to how much company stock should be invested in
employees' 401(k) plans--issues having nothing to do with stock
options.</TE>
<TE>   Levin-McCain is not only bad for stockholders and employees; it
harms companies and innovation as well. The bill would create less
accurate financial statements and thus would deprive investors of the
accurate information needed to judge a company's performance.
Finally, Levin-McCain would limit the ability of companies to take
deductions when stock options are exercised and therefore effectively
would raise taxes on those companies. Employee stock options are
widely used by many small and medium-size businesses, the engine of
growth for the economy. Thus, stock options are directly linked to
strong job growth.</TE>
<TE>   Levin-McCain is an attempt by Congress to leverage the emotion and
real hardship elicited by Enron's failings in order to clamp down on
the benefits industry can bestow on its employees. And nobody--not
companies, not employees--will be better off.</TE>

<HD>Suicide Bombers May Be Shocking, but Dying for the Cause Is
Not New</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suicide bombers are morbidly fascinating, but that fascination
reveals as much about us as it does about them. While Americans
ponder the roots of murderous martyrdom, searching for explanations
that fit within their notions of Third World psychology and religion,
the Palestinians seem less interested in spiritual inspiration than
in practical military innovation. And it seems to be working.</LD>
<LD>   But for now, the dominant view in the United States is that
suicide bombing has deep roots in Muslim culture. As Reuel Marc
Gerecht, a Middle East expert at the American Enterprise Institute,
wrote recently in the Wall Street Journal, "Martyrdom--istishhad--is
an old and esteemed idea in Islam." Gerecht traces it to the year
680, when Husayn, the grandson of Muhammad, became "the prince of all
martyrs," scripting into Muslim consciousness "a never-ending passion
play."</LD>
<LD>   Other Americans are simply perplexed. On CNN, Air Force Gen.
Richard Myers wondered aloud what made "that beautiful young lady,"
Hayat Akhras, 18, decide to "put on a bomb costume" and kill herself
and two others in a Jerusalem supermarket March 29.</LD>
<TE>   But maybe the issue is simple: the Palestinians are trying to win,
and they are willing to use any tool available, including the
flesh-and-blood equivalent of a cruise missile. That is, the Arabs,
having proven unable or unwilling to live with the Israelis in peace
and, being equally incapable of defeating the Israelis on the
"symmetrical" battlefield, have finally found an asymmetrical tactic
that works.</TE>
<TE>   One might recall that few people other than the Palestinians cared
about Palestinian statehood until the intifada began in 1987,
confronting Israel with the downside of continued occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, the chief Palestinian weapon was the stone. But that
spasm of violence was enough to bring about the Oslo accords of 1993,
creating the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The violence in the last 18 months, of course, has been much
worse; the big difference has been the wave of suicide bombings. In
response, the Israelis started frisking young Palestinian men; in
response to that, older men stepped forward to kill and die
themselves. And Jan. 27 brought the first female suicide bomber.</TE>
<TE>   But is it proper to think of suicidal terrorists as a military
force? Apparently the Palestinians do. And suicidal fighting is
nothing new in the region. In the Book of Judges, the Hebrew hero
Samson says to himself, "Let me die with the Philistines" and pulls
down the enemy temple.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there's a fine line between military heroism and suicide,
even in the U.S. What does one say, for example, about the 69th New
York volunteer militia during the Civil War--the so-called Irish
Brigade--which suffered 75% casualties when it charged Confederate
positions at the Battle of Fredericksburg on Dec. 13, 1862?</TE>
<TE>   On other occasions, suicidal sacrifice has brought victory to
Americans. On June 4, 1942, at the Battle of Midway, U.S. commanders
dispatched 41 obsolete Douglas Devastator torpedo bombers at the
Japanese fleet. The lumbering Devastators were easy targets; in the
words of aviation historian Walter Boyne, "The American crews knew
that they weren't coming back."</TE>
<TE>   And in fact, 35 were shot down, without scoring a single hit. But
their sacrifice, Boyne notes, was not in vain; the Devastators
distracted the Japanese, allowing American dive bombers to sink four
enemy aircraft carriers, turning the tide of the Pacific war.</TE>
<TE>   And that's the point: War is Darwinian competition at its most
ferocious--evolve or lose. And while keeping suicide bombers in their
arsenal, the Palestinians are evolving new tactics. In February, they
blew up two Israeli tanks using mines and fired high-explosive
rockets at Israeli targets. On March 3, a single sniper killed 10
Israelis, including seven soldiers, at a West Bank checkpoint--and
escaped. And Tuesday, the Palestinians killed 13 Israelis in a West
Bank booby trap ambush.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the Israelis are inflicting many more casualties. The
Palestinians seem prepared to pay any price, even as they raise the
price paid by their foe. They think that the Israelis, tiring of
their own losses, will soon leave the West Bank. And they're probably
more right than wrong.</TE>

<HD>Arafat's One Last Chance to Be a Leader</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS ROSS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The United States may have realized some newfound leverage with
Yasser Arafat, thanks to President Bush's speech last Thursday, and
it is important for Secretary of State Colin Powell to use it when he
meets the chairman as he plans to do this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The president implied that it was now or never for Arafat. If
Arafat fears that the U.S. will sever ties with him if he does not
give unequivocal orders to prevent terror and publicly discredit it
as a threat to the Palestinian cause, he may finally be forced to
make a choice. My experience with him suggests that he only chooses
to act when he has no choice.</LD>
<LD>   If there is any hope for Arafat, he must conclude from his meeting
with Powell that he is out of chances.</LD>
<TE>   Bush also threw down a gauntlet, challenging Arab leaders either
to help produce a change in Arafat's behavior or to exert their
leadership given the absence of effective Palestinian leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, simply calling on the Arabs is not going to produce
the role we seek. They have a long history of avoiding any
responsibility for the Palestinians. They embrace the cause of the
Palestinians, particularly given its resonance among their public,
but run for cover when asked to pressure the Palestinians. No Arab
leader ever wants to be accused by the Palestinians of forcing them
to surrender their rights or their struggle.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt Powell hoped that by meeting Arab leaders and the
Europeans before going to Israel he could build a consensus behind
his efforts to pressure both the Palestinians and Israelis. But in
the current circumstances, the Arab leaders were bound to turn the
tables on him.</TE>
<TE>   They insisted that before they do as he asked, Powell must meet
with Arafat--something he has announced he will do--and commit to
launch a credible negotiating process. Powell also must produce an
end to the Israeli military operation in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   If that is the price the Arabs impose for making any real effort
to help, the secretary's challenge in Israel will be truly
formidable. Leaving aside Ariel Sharon's unwillingness to negotiate
under fire or with Arafat, the Israeli military operations in the
West Bank have extraordinary support among the Israeli public, which
wants its military to finish the job of destroying the terrorist
infrastructure that Arafat has allowed to flourish in the Palestinian
cities and refugee camps. Wednesday's bus bombing in Haifa only added
to that resolve. Israelis have no illusions that the military
operations will stop terror forever. But they believe it will provide
at least some respite.</TE>
<TE>   While Sharon will not want to appear to be saying no to President
Bush, he will be very reluctant to appear to be giving in until the
military believes it has completed the mission.</TE>
<TE>   Will the Arab leaders be satisfied short of a full halt to the
incursions? I don't believe so. Powell will certainly try to get
Sharon to wrap up the operations on an accelerated basis, but he may
need to stay in the region until such time as the Israelis complete
their pullback. There will be no cease-fire without that, and there
will be no negotiating process without a cease-fire that holds.</TE>
<TE>   Having said all this, I do not believe that Powell is on a mission
impossible. He has leverage with all sides.</TE>
<TE>   The Arabs want his intervention. He must tell them that his
readiness to persist with U.S. efforts to produce a meaningful
negotiating process depends on their leaning on the Palestinians to
stop the terror attacks and that they also must change their own
rhetoric on suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Bear in mind that the very anger on the Arab street that has
motivated the administration to act is a source of real fear to Arab
leaders. They need the situation to be stabilized. They believe that
we are the only ones who can influence the Israelis. They need to
know that that won't happen unless they do their part.</TE>
<TE>   With the Israelis, their very understanding that the current
operations can only produce a respite from terror provides an
important opening. But a respite will mean nothing if there is not a
political strategy to build on it.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, Arafat has to decide. He will try to up the ante,
insisting there can be no cease-fire without a U.S. commitment to
Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 borders. He will settle for less but
also claim he can take only partial measures.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary of State must echo the president: No more failed
leadership and no acceptance of half measures.</TE>
<TE>   If we succumb to the allure of half steps by Arafat now, any calm
that results from Powell's trip will be very short-lived.</TE>

<HD>Good Riddance to Oprah's Book Club, and Her Literary
Amateurism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oprah Winfrey is shelving her book club.</LD>
<LD>   Publishers and grubbing authors everywhere already are bemoaning
the diminished sales they anticipate--somewhere in the neighborhood
of 600,000 per selection.</LD>
<LD>   A mountain of profit lost, to be sure, but there is a larger
question at stake, one that arose not long ago when the daytime talk
show impresario bestowed her coveted imprimatur on Jonathan Franzen's
book "The Corrections," and the author snubbed the honor.</LD>
<TE>   What was wrong with Oprah's Book Club? Or perhaps, what
relationship should the masses have with literature and vice versa?</TE>
<TE>   It's a particularly American question, given our nation's
egalitarian bent. We're uncomfortable with those little words
"highbrow" and "lowbrow."</TE>
<TE>   We abhor snobs, mostly because we live in the bravest of new
worlds, where class, race and sex form an odious triad of historical
oppression, which the enlightened among us are supposed to have long
since dispensed. Accordingly, Franzen was widely pilloried for
declining to have his opus besmirched by the thumbprints of the great
unwashed, or at least by their queen bee arbiter, Winfrey.</TE>
<TE>   But there is more than petit bourgeois snobbery in a dislike for
Oprah's Book Club.</TE>
<TE>   First, there's the celebrity issue. Because she is famous,
Winfrey, who will continue sporadically to feature books she feels
strongly about, exercises more than her share of influence on public
debate.</TE>
<TE>   Her opinion in matters of literary taste is amateurish to say the
least, but it carries considerable weight solely because she is a
household name.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, a movie star's offhand remarks about politics always
seem to make the news.</TE>
<TE>   Because someone famous said it, suddenly it matters, even though
the famous person in question often knows little or nothing about the
matter at hand.</TE>
<TE>   Winfrey presumed where she should not have, and while her
presumption may have led millions who might not otherwise have done
so to read some good books, one can understand why someone like
Franzen would disdain her haphazard tap on the head.</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't want her sticker on my book either.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the question of effort.</TE>
<TE>   In our fast-food nation, we tend to think that the intellectual
life, like everything else, can be had pre-chewed and in bulk just
for the asking.</TE>
<TE>   But that attitude is a grievous insult to the people who spend
their lives earning the respect of their literary peers and versing
themselves in the arduous ways of their trade.</TE>
<TE>   What Yeats wrote of love applies equally to literature: "Hearts
are not had as a gift but hearts are earned by those that are not
entirely beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there's the question of quality. People who dislike
Oprah's Book Club dislike it for the same reason that they dislike
Barnes &amp; Noble. The fact that the two do a brisk business isn't
accidental.</TE>
<TE>   Winfrey and B&amp;N represent the same pernicious homogenization of
American life that makes existential despair all but unavoidable.</TE>
<TE>   They are the generic market force that always pushes the charming,
singular neighborhood bookstore cafe out of business or the quirky
black comic novel into the remainder bin; the bland cultural
juggernaut that makes every corner of America look the same and, more
frightening, think the same.</TE>
<TE>   Books are not commodities, but the gilded age of treadmill
publishing--to which Winfrey has contributed her demeaning
sensibility--has made them so, thereby spawning harried plagiarists
such as Stephen Ambrose and yellow journalists like David Brock.</TE>
<TE>   If Oprah's Book Club is gone, good riddance. Now if only B&amp;N would
go with it.</TE>

<HD>Security for More Afghans</HD>

<LD>The attempted assassination of Afghanistan's defense minister this
week provided the latest and most dramatic example of the need to
expand the international security force to cities outside Kabul, the
capital.</LD>
<LD>   The 4,500 troops from Britain, France and other countries have
brought relative peace to Kabul, allowing adults to shop and visit
and children to walk to reopened schools without fear. Washington
originally did not want international peacekeepers in Afghanistan at
all, despite their success in enforcing truces in such places as
Bosnia and Kosovo, and has not supplied U.S. troops to the force.
But eventually the Bush administration agreed to the international
soldiers, so long as they came under U.S. Central Command
jurisdiction.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the Pentagon opposes letting the peacekeepers take
up posts in Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif and Jalalabad, where a bomb just
killed five people and narrowly missed killing Defense Minister
Mohammed Qassim Fahim. The regional security troops, untrained and
inept, were useless in preventing the attack, helping the injured or
getting Fahim and his entourage to safety quickly. There is no
guarantee that NATO soldiers would have prevented the explosion or
avoided taking casualties, but their neutrality, combined with
superior training and equipment, would give them better odds in such
situations.</LD>
<TE>   The Pentagon says its soldiers are fighters, not nation-builders.
In Afghanistan the picture is not that simple. U.S. officials say
American troops have been forced at least 10 times to intervene
between rival Afghan warlords, actions that could have been taken by
peacekeepers. The eventual goal is to have an Afghan army to provide
security, but it is likely to take several years to train that force.
The immediate need is providing security in wider areas of the
country to reduce the role of warlords and clear a path for aid to a
population devastated by a 10-year Soviet occupation, years of brutal
combat among many of the same warlords, and rule by the Taliban. Even
pared-down forces of hundreds of soldiers would be helpful in cities
outside Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Another need is paying those Afghan police officers and soldiers
who are trying to provide a semblance of order. Some may be little
more than thugs, but paying and training them is better than letting
them use their weapons to extort money at checkpoints or protect
farmers almost ready to harvest their opium poppies. The government
of interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai, desperate for funds, has not
been able to pay farmers enough to persuade them to forgo money
earned from the opium, which gets converted to heroin.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai wants more peacekeepers. Other Afghan officials are
interpreting U.S. opposition as a desire to get out as soon as
possible. Washington turned its back on the country after the Soviets
were ousted in 1989, opening the door for internecine warfare and
eventually the Taliban, Al Qaeda and Sept. 11. That mistake must not
be repeated.</TE>
<TE>   More money and more supplies need to be provided. Quickly. And
that depends on security for a much greater area than just the
capital.</TE>

<LD>No sooner did President Bush sign campaign finance reform into law
March 27 than opponents started searching like a pack of bloodhounds
for loopholes. But their defeat in a House vote Wednesday showed that
the usual tricks may not suffice this time.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield), chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee and an avowed enemy of campaign finance reform,
attached a campaign finance loophole provision to an otherwise
mom-and-apple-pie tax bill that would have permitted some taxpayers
to pay the government in installments and given electronic filers an
extra 15 days next year. Thanks to Thomas, however, it would also
have encouraged the revival of unregulated "soft money," the target
of the long fight for reform. It would have weakened the campaign
donation reporting requirements for certain private nonprofit
political organizations, ranging from the Republican Leadership
Coalition to the Sierra Club.</LD>
<LD>   According to a new report called "Deja Vu Soft Money," by the
independent government watchdog Public Citizen, 25 such groups have
raised $67.3 million in the past 18 months for political activities.</LD>
<TE>   Thomas thought that he could ram the measure through by firmly
linking it to the tax bill, cynically believing that no elected
official could safely oppose a taxpayer rights measure. He refused to
allow any amendments, and what little debate took place was scheduled
for late at night so that it would attract as little press as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   Such bullying tactics have succeeded in the past. Thomas and his
friends introduced endless alternative "reform" bills in past years.
After the Shays-Meehan bill, the original reform, successfully fought
off the pretenders, its consideration was delayed six months because
proponents had to obtain enough signatures to force the House GOP
leadership to call a vote. In the end, it was only the Enron scandal
that generated the final signatures.</TE>
<TE>   Foes of campaign finance reform will not stop trying to whittle
away at it. But supporters proved Wednesday that they can muster a
successful defense in Congress. Now backers are hoping for a
toughened Federal Election Commission and support in the federal
courts to keep reform from sagging.</TE>

<LD>There is almost no support for so-called "reproductive cloning''--the
morally repugnant notion of copying DNA for the purpose of creating a
child. But what about creating a few human cells that might cure
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cancer or other serious diseases, without
creating a fetus? That use, though it requires examination, certainly
does not fall in the same class as baby-making.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush threw out the medical with the immoral Wednesday in
a White House speech calling for a comprehensive, no-exceptions ban
on human cloning. He gave his support to legislation by Sen. Sam
Brownback (R-Kan.) that would impose a 10-year prison term and a
$1-million fine on anyone who tried to clone human cells for any
purpose.</LD>
<LD>   Bush called for the support of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.), which is about as likely as Bush supporting new taxes.
There's a possibility that the president's speech was really meant to
score points with ardent abortion opponents, many of whom were in the
audience, and provide ammunition to use against Democrats in
November. But even if that cynical scenario is true, Bush is
rebuffing science.</LD>
<TE>   The Brownback bill would bar federally funded scientists from
engaging in so-called "therapeutic" or "research" cloning:
replicating the DNA of early-stage embryos to pursue promising leads
in disease treatments. As 40 Nobel Prize-winning scientists
underscored in a letter sent to senators this month, the Brownback
bill ''would impede progress against some of the most debilitating
diseases known to man.''</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the worst result of the bill would be to drive public
research into the private sector, where no federal ethics or public
disclosure rules apply and where scientists would have no official
oversight whatsoever. The possibility of that outcome should trouble
everyone.</TE>
<TE>   A sensible alternative to Brownback's bill is pending legislation
by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that distinguishes between human
cloning and regenerative medicine, imposing stiff penalties on
scientists who try to create a person while allowing scientists to
continue seeking cures.</TE>
<TE>   Given the recent, unconfirmed reports that Italian gynecologist
Severino Antinori had produced a cloned human embryo, the need for
regulation is urgent. Feinstein's bill does the job much more
carefully than Brownback's overbearing legislation.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The true agenda for those seeking driver's licenses for illegal
aliens is coming clear (April 9). Despite all their arguments that
they only want illegal aliens to be able to legally drive in
California, advocates now oppose any indicator on a legal driver's
license that the bearer is residing in the country illegally.
Obviously, they want the state to join in their conspiracy to thwart
federal laws against illegal immigration and the hiring of illegal
immigrants and could not care less about whether illegal aliens are
legally driving in the state.</LD>
<LD>   James R. Dorcy</LD>
<LD>   San Diego</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Here we go again, another harebrained scheme to fool the
electorate--giving illegal aliens California driver's licenses but
not wanting to identify the driver on the driver's license as an
illegal alien. Gov. Gray Davis attempts to give credibility to this
latest scheme by using Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca to head
the task force to craft a compromise bill to give illegal aliens
California driver's licenses. To Baca's credit, he did admit that it
is virtually impossible to enforce a law that permitted driving for
employment purposes only. He also admitted that it is against the law
for an employer to knowingly hire an undocumented worker.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is so desperate to court Latino voters that he will do
almost anything to get their support. Sometimes I think I am in a
parallel universe when I learn about the antics in Sacramento.</TE>

<LD>Re "U.S. Jews Cannot Acquiesce to Sharon's Monstrous Behavior,"
Commentary, April 9: How ironic that on the day we remember the
murder of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust, Robert Scheer urges us to
stand idly by while Jews--including elderly Holocaust survivors--are
massacred daily in Israel. By arguing that both sides are morally
equivalent, he dangerously confuses the distinction between terrorism
and counter-terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   He is right that Judaism calls for healing the world. And as a
true liberal, I passionately believe in Judaism's demand to help the
poor, the orphan and the widow. I also believe in Judaism's pursuit
of the truth. Here the truth is indisputable: Israel offered Yasser
Arafat a far-reaching peace deal, and Arafat promptly responded with
an unrelenting campaign of terror.</LD>

<TE>   It is all too evident that George W. Bush, president of world's
only remaining superpower, has absolutely no control over Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. So how is it that Arafat is expected to
control terrorism from his two bombed-out rooms in Ramallah?</TE>

<LD>Re "Police Commission Rejects Parks," April 10: L.A. Police Chief
Bernard Parks says he will fight the decision of the Police
Commission to not renew his contract, and he will go to the City
Council. Why, may I ask, is he appealing to a group of politicians
when his own rank and file do not want him around? I respect his use
of the system and due process, but why make it any harder than it has
to be? Why would he wish to stay at a party where he is not welcome?
It's time for him to collect his hat and coat and make a graceful
exit with what little respect he has left in this city.</LD>
<LD>   He compared this to a lost battle, and his war will continue. If
this is a war, Chief Parks must be made aware that he is a casualty
of his own war, by his own hand, and his fellow soldiers have turned
their backs on him. If he refuses to listen to the words of the
Police Commission, perhaps he should listen to the sound of the rank
and file who support him--the only sound is deafening silence.</LD>

<TE>   Chief Parks, please leave as chief and please return as mayor; I'm

that your return in that capacity happens.</TE>

<TE>   Did not Chief Parks state when he was selected for the post of
chief of police that at the end of his five years he would abide by
the Police Commission's decision on whether to seek another five-year
term? Chief Parks, who is turning this situation into a political
one? Who is behaving like a politician, making promises that are not
meant to be kept?</TE>

<TE>   "Hahn Isn't Welcome, Black Leaders Say" (April 6) reports that
Mayor James Hahn is no longer welcome at the Urban League's awards
dinner or black churches because he doesn't support another term for
Parks. This is disturbing. Does the Urban League think that Hahn
should support Parks just because he is black, even though Hahn feels
that Parks didn't do a good job? Or even more disturbing, does the
group think that Hahn approves of Parks but won't support him because
of racist reasons?</TE>
<TE>   Turn the situation around. Imagine a largely white group telling a
black mayor that he's not welcome at an event because the black mayor
doesn't support another term for a white police chief. Now, that
would be front-page news.</TE>

<LD>Re "Plan for Drug Tests Dropped," April 10: It has been eight years
since I graduated from high school. I'm aware that some things have
changed, but others haven't. Parents should be more worried about
alcohol, rather than focusing all their attention on drugs. Binge
drinking doesn't start in college; high school parties are where it
all begins.</LD>
<LD>   Parents beware, your son or daughter is more likely to engage in
sex, get in car wrecks and do or say just about anything while
intoxicated. Why is alcohol always overlooked? Oh yeah, because this
drug is legal.</LD>

<LD>Re "A Mountainous Misstep," editorial, April 5: It would seem a
horrendous environmental mishap if the small airport outside Mammoth
Lakes were to be enlarged to accept passenger jets. What is so wrong
with having a large airport at Bishop, which is approximately 40
miles away, and shuttling visitors to the Mammoth village? It is an
effortless drive to the mountain.</LD>
<LD>   I have visited many ski resorts in Europe where a plane and/or
train and shuttle ride was necessary to get to distant slopes. The
journey required never deterred us from visiting any particular
slopes.</LD>

<LD>"Renters Serve Notice to Landlords" (April 5) indicates that AB 2330
would allow "tenants who are charged two months' rent as a security
deposit to pay in installments" and that "tenants who have lost their
jobs would be able to use part of their security deposit as an
emergency rent payment." What part of "security deposit" does
Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco) not understand?</LD>
<LD>   Once a tenant has moved in, the prepaid security deposit is the
major measure of insurance the owner has that the tenants will abide
by their agreement. It is also an offset against the potential of
lost rent and significant damages that do occur. Passage of AB 2330
would only accelerate the disappearance of affordable housing.</LD>

<TE>   Every month, housing grows more and more unaffordable in Los
Angeles. At the same time, congestion on the freeways and surface
streets grows, and pressure to develop such wilderness areas as the
Ahmanson Ranch continues. Yet there are vast, yawning stretches of
ugly and abandoned streets where new residential development could be
built.</TE>
<TE>   I am speaking of Van Nuys Boulevard, north of Vanowen Street. This
area could accommodate dozens of perhaps 10-story-high residential
buildings. The road could be landscaped with trees, and a depressing
and ugly section of the San Fernando Valley would be brought back to
life. The same could be said for Sherman Way east of Coldwater Canyon
and Vineland Avenue north of Burbank Boulevard. Development should be
directed to already-developed areas that are in need of help.</TE>

<LD>John Balzar, in his April 7 commentary, "The Cussing Canoeist Can't
Make a Wrong a Right," made an excellent point about a man in
Michigan who got away with yelling profanities around small children:
The court maintained Timothy Boomer's 1st Amendment right to swear in
a park setting--but it would never tolerate swearing in the
courtroom.</LD>
<LD>   I saw a similar 1st Amendment dimension in "Video Game Maker Finds
Shock Value" (Business, April 7), about the video game "Grand Theft
Auto 3." In this game, a driver picks up a prostitute and later
murders her. Take Two Interactive Software and other producers of
extremely violent games will also use the 1st Amendment argument
against any effort to censor them.</LD>
<LD>   It's depressing to see the free-speech argument used to defend
actions that embarrass, humiliate or dehumanize the members of our
society who are young and/or economically powerless. They are
considered unimportant compared with, say, judges and software game
developers.</LD>

<LD>After happily living in Los Angeles for 14 years (as a Minnesota
transplant), in February I moved to New York City to help my brother
run his restaurant. Like many Americans, Sept. 11 caused me to
reassess my life and to do things I always wanted to do. Because I'm
in a relationship, I commute back and forth once a month. My air
travel has been virtually hassle-free. As long as you're ready with
identification in hand and follow the new rules set forth, everything
goes smoothly.</LD>
<LD>   I miss L.A. dearly, while finding my New York City experience
thrilling as well as a dream come true. To experience these two
American greats is amazing. I've seen the "Tribute in Light" and paid
tribute at ground zero. And I make a point to patronize lower
Manhattan. For all the competition and cliches between the two
cities, it all comes down to how they both embody our great nation.
Diverse. Magical. And full of opportunity. One is not better than the
other. They truly are apples and oranges.</LD>

<HD>Telemundo Hires Talent From Rival</HD>
<DH>Media: Announcement comes as NBC's $2.7-billion purchase of
the Spanish-language network is approved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the same day federal regulators approved NBC's $2.7-billion
purchase of Spanish-language television broadcaster Telemundo, the
network Wednesday also signed Emmy Award-winning anchorwoman Maria
Celeste Arraras from its chief rival, ratings leader Univision
Communications Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The marketing of Arraras' new show provides a glimpse of the
strategy that Telemundo and NBC will employ to take advantage of
cross-promotion and programming collaboration between the two
broadcasters.</LD>
<LD>   "There aren't going to be any walls between NBC and Telemundo,"
said Andy Lack, chief operating officer of NBC, a subsidiary of
General Electric Co.</LD>
<TE>   For the last eight years, Arraras headlined the investigative news
magazine "Primer Impacto" on Univision, the country's largest
Spanish-language television network, which is watched by about 80% of
Spanish-language viewers. Last month, she announced she was not
renewing her contract with the network and immediately went off the
air.</TE>
<TE>   Although her hiring by Telemundo is a competitive blow to
Univision, more significant is the role she will play in capitalizing
on one of Univision's few obvious vulnerabilities--its absence of an
entree into reaching bilingual audiences who move back and forth
between Spanish-language and English-language broadcast networks.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of announcement is exactly what my colleagues [are
looking for]," Lack said, adding that he expects to see Telemundo
reporters contributing to NBC News programs such as "Dateline NBC"
and the "Today" show. "You'll see NBC and Telemundo taking great
advantage of this extraordinary talent."</TE>
<TE>   Arraras, who speaks Spanish and English with equal ease, will be
managing editor of "Al Rojo Vivo con Maria Celeste" ("Red Hot with
Maria Celeste"), an hourlong news magazine that will air weekdays at
5 p.m. It is scheduled to premiere April 29.</TE>
<TE>   She also will host "Boletin de la Migra," a standing feature
segment on the show about immigrants and their life in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Communications Commission's approval was an important
formality for NBC, which acquired Telemundo Communications Group Inc.
in October in a deal that includes 11 TV stations in major cities
such as New York, Chicago and Dallas as well as 17 low-power TV
stations.</TE>
<TE>   To comply with a federal law restricting companies from owning
more than two stations in the same city, NBC will sell Telemundo's
KVEA-TV (Channel 52) in Los Angeles. It already owns KNBC-TV (Channel
4) here and, through the Telemundo deal, also acquired KWHY-TV
(Channel 22) and KVEA.</TE>
<TE>   Telemundo was controlled by Sony Corp. and Liberty Media Corp.,
who each owned about 34% of the network.</TE>
<TE>   Details of Arraras' multi-year contract were not disclosed, but at
Wednesday's news conference in Coral Gables, Fla., with Telemundo
President Jim McNamara and Lack, she said: "I will be paying lots of
taxes, but I'll be making less than Katie Couric," referring to the
"Today" anchor, who signed a $65-million contract with NBC several
months ago.</TE>
<TE>   General Electric shares rose 75 cents to $37.20 on the New York
Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Univision shares rose 8 cents to $41.76,
also on the NYSE.</TE>

<CX>   Telemundo sale--A story in Thursday's Business section said that
NBC would sell KVEA-TV (Channel 52) in Los Angeles after acquiring the
Spanish-language network to comply with Federal Communications Commission
ownership restrictions. NBC rather intends to divest itself of
Telemundo's other local station, KWHY-TV (Channel 22). The information
was incorrect in the FCC's initial announcement approving the deal.</CX>

<HD>AT&amp;T to Seek OK for Reverse Split</HD>
<DH>Stocks: Long-distance giant looks to boost the market price
of its shares after the sale of its cable business to Comcast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN and ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Corp. surprised Wall Street on Wednesday by announcing a step
more typical of tiny companies with poor prospects: a reverse stock
split.</LD>
<LD>   The long-distance giant said it will ask shareholders to approve a
1-for-5 reverse stock split once management sells the company's cable
business. The effect should be to boost the market price of the
stock, though the change won't affect shareholders' wealth.</LD>
<LD>   AT&amp;T, whose shares have been battered since early 2000 along with
most other telecom issues, appears to fear that the pending sale of
its cable assets to Comcast Corp. could leave AT&amp;T stock trading
below $5, hurting the company's image, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   "They're doing it because when you back out the Comcast offer for
AT&amp;T Broadband, the stock would be in the single digits, which is not
what the largest 'telco' in the U.S. would like people to see," said
Vik Grover, managing director for equity research at brokerage
Kaufman Bros. "It's cosmetics."</TE>
<TE>   The news wasn't warmly received on Wall Street: AT&amp;T shares fell
59 cents to $14.42 on the New York Stock Exchange despite a rally in
the broader market Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Conventional stock splits, such as when a company exchanges two
shares for every one outstanding, are considered bullish. Companies
often use such splits to lower the market price of their shares after
the stock has surged, to make the shares appear more accessible to
the average investor.</TE>
<TE>   If a stock is trading for $100, and it splits 2-for-1, the market
price of a single share immediately falls to $50. Shareholders have
the same dollar amount of stock, just twice as many shares at half
the previous price.</TE>
<TE>   A reverse split, as the term implies, reverses the process. In
AT&amp;T's case, every five shares would be exchanged for a single share.
If the stock is around $15 at the time of the split, the "new" shares
would trade for about $75 each immediately after the split.</TE>
<TE>   Reverse splits are rare for major companies, analysts said. They
typically are used by tiny companies with checkered histories. Often
the goal is to prevent being booted, or "delisted," from Nasdaq or
the New York Stock Exchange by lifting the share price from the
single-digit range. Stocks that trade below $1 for an extended period
face possible delisting.</TE>
<TE>   "Ordinarily there's a real stigma to reverse splits," said Scott
Rader, head of Active-Investor.com, a Dayton, Ohio, firm that tracks
splits. "It's the domain of 'penny' stocks, those that trade below
$1."</TE>
<TE>   In AT&amp;T's case, however, analysts say the company is more worried
about appealing to institutional investors, whose guidelines often
preclude them from buying or holding any stock under $5, than about
potential delisting.</TE>
<TE>   Once the company completes the sale of its cable business, the
remainder of AT&amp;T would be valued in the $4-to-$5-a-share range,
analysts say, based on recent trading. And given the still-worsening
telecom market, several analysts said that without intervention
AT&amp;T's stock easily could have sunk below the $5 mark after the cable
sale.</TE>
<TE>   "This saves them some embarrassment," said Patrick Comack, telecom
analyst at Guzman &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T spokeswoman Eileen Connolly said the company's aim is simply
"to adjust the price on its common stock following the AT&amp;T
restructuring transactions."</TE>
<TE>   The company unveiled the reverse-split plan Wednesday in a federal
filing outlining issues for the company's shareholder meeting this
summer. At that meeting, shareholders also will vote on the planned
sale of AT&amp;T's cable business to Comcast and on a plan to create a
so-called tracking stock for AT&amp;T's consumer long-distance unit.</TE>
<TE>   Once the cable business is sold, AT&amp;T will be left with two units:
AT&amp;T Business, which sells data and voice services to corporations,
and AT&amp;T Consumer, which includes the bulk of AT&amp;T's long-distance
business, plus the company's consumer Internet service.</TE>
<TE>   Both businesses are suffering amid stepped-up competition and
falling long-distance prices. AT&amp;T's residential long-distance unit,
which will fund the company's ongoing dividends, is especially
vulnerable because its high profit margins are shrinking along with
revenue, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Connolly said Wednesday that dividend payments are at the
discretion of AT&amp;T's board, but she said the company's pattern after
previous spinoffs has been to increase the per-share dividend to
match the effects of the change. If that holds true after the reverse
split, the dividend, now at a 15-cents-a-share annual rate, would
rise to 75 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Reverse splits don't change a business' fundamentals, analysts
say, and more than a few stocks immediately boosted by such splits
have quickly fallen back toward single-digit territory. Costa
Mesa-based Irvine Sensors Corp., for example, has slumped 30% since a
1-for-20 split in September.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts said many other telecom and tech stocks seem to be
better candidates for reverse splits than AT&amp;T--for example, Nortel
Networks Corp., now trading at $3.50, Lucent Technologies Inc. at
$4.03 and WorldCom Group at $4.77.</TE>
<TE>   Will the practice spread in the tech and telecom world?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised some of the others haven't gone the same route,"
Rader said. "The Lucents and the Nortels of the world would seem like
candidates, simply because of the $5 [institutional] guideline. If
business doesn't pick up in the telecom equipment sector, I wouldn't
be surprised to see other companies do a reverse split, especially if
AT&amp;T's move is well-received by investors."</TE>
<TE>   Some major AT&amp;T shareholders say they aren't concerned about the
planned split, calling the stock a bargain.</TE>
<TE>   "The attractiveness of AT&amp;T, unfortunately, keeps growing,"
quipped Chicago-based mutual fund manager Bill Nygren, who said he
has added to his AT&amp;T holdings in recent months in the Oakmark and
Oakmark Select funds. The stock is down 20.5% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   Nygren said he believes the traditional phone business is being
grossly undervalued at around $4 a share.</TE>
<TE>   "It may not be a great business, but it's worth two to three times
what it's being valued at," he said.</TE>

<HD>PUC Gives Utility Customers a Break</HD>
<DH>Energy: Companies ordered to raise the allotment of
electricity and gas that is billed at the lowest rates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most residential customers of Southern California Edison and Southern
California Gas Co. can look forward to slightly lower bills because
regulators ordered the state's investor-owned utilities to boost
their "baseline," the allotment of electricity and natural gas each
month that is billed at the lowest rates.</LD>
<LD>   SCE on Wednesday was still calculating new baselines for the six
regions in its 50,000-square-mile territory and could give only a
rough estimate of potential average savings of about $1.50 on an
average monthly bill of $70.50.</LD>
<LD>   For Southern California Gas, the savings are considerably smaller,
averaging 36cents a month in winter and 9cents a month in summer for
most customers.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling Tuesday by the California Public Utilities Commission
also applies to Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and San Diego Gas &amp;
Electric, but not to the Los Angeles Department of Water &amp; Power,
whose rates are not controlled by the PUC.</TE>
<TE>   Baseline is the amount of electricity or natural gas that
supposedly meets the minimum needs of a typical household in each
region.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers complain that the many baselines in each utility's
territory were calculated using old data that didn't account for the
energy use of modern homes.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, critics say the baseline regions are too large, with
each containing communities in which electric usage varies greatly.
For example, Santa Monica and Compton are in the same baseline
region.</TE>
<TE>   Baseline pricing, an arcane bit of utility rate-making, became a
hot issue during California's energy crisis as the price of
electricity and natural gas soared.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the PUC instituted California's largest electricity
rate hike ever and designed the new rates in five tiers tied to
baseline. Customers who used up to 130% of baseline saw no rate
increase. (Natural gas rates are partly deregulated, and gas
utilities are allowed to pass along changes in the fluctuating
commodity price of natural gas.)</TE>
<TE>   The five-member PUC, in a unanimous vote, ordered the utilities to
increase the different baseline allotments by varying amounts,
depending on the baseline region.</TE>
<TE>   All-electric households were not affected by the decision because
their baseline was already set by law.</TE>
<TE>   Utilities initially will lose money while consumers save. Utility
customers should not celebrate too quickly, however, because the PUC
intends the changes to be "revenue-neutral" to utilities, meaning any
revenue lost because of higher baselines must be made up somewhere
else. How that will balance out will be determined later.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking only at how the pie is sliced, not the size of the
pie," the PUC said in its order.</TE>

<HD>Universal Music Is Tops in Pop</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Battling an abysmal music marketplace, Universal Music Group in the
last week has captured seven of the top 10 best-selling albums on the
nation's pop chart.</LD>
<LD>   This year, the Vivendi Universal division accounts for an
estimated 28% of new music sales, far outpacing its four major
competitors at a time when executives say sales are suffering from a
dearth of hit acts and increasing digital piracy.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, music sales industrywide had their first year-to-year
decline in at least a decade. Sales of current albums this year
continue to slide, declining about 10% from a year ago, according to
music research firm SoundScan.</LD>
<TE>   But Universal topped the sales list for the week ended Sunday with
albums from R&amp;B act Ashanti, the Now music compilation, the duo of
Jay-Z and R. Kelly, soundtracks from "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" and
"The Scorpion King," rapper Ludacris and R&amp;B singer Avant.</TE>
<TE>   The music conglomerate's market share is down slightly from a year
ago, but group Chairman Doug Morris said, "We're doing a good job
against the stream of the overall business. We're going to outperform
everybody because of the people who work here."</TE>
<TE>   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Vivendi shares rose 4cents to
$33.40.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Sales May Miss Forecast, Analysts Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp.'s 2002 sales may rise less than the
cable television operator forecast because a possible slowdown in
system upgrades would curb customer growth, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The company is under scrutiny by regulators after disclosing
$2.3billion in loans guaranteed to Chairman John Rigas' family.
Analysts, including Sean Egan of Egan-Jones Ratings Co., have
predicted the company may cut in half its 2002 capital spending
budget of as much as $2.2 billion to free up cash.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia is upgrading cable lines to sell digital TV and Internet
access services, products the cable industry is counting on to spur
sales as overall subscriber growth slows.</LD>
<TE>   A delay in those improvements might crimp customer growth and
cause the sixth-largest U.S. cable provider to fall short of its
sales forecast this year, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Coudersport, Pa.-based Adelphia have fallen 51% since
the additional debt was disclosed March 27.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia has forecast a 44% increase in digital TV subscribers
this year to 2.7 million. Digital TV offers hundreds of channels and
better sound and picture quality than standard cable TV.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Adelphia expects a 0.5% rise in basic cable
subscribers in 2002, the same as last year and down from 1.3% in
2000. Adelphia finished last year with 5.81 million cable customers.</TE>
<TE>   The company may lose customers to satellite-TV providers because
Adelphia systems serving 46% of subscribers haven't been upgraded for
digital TV, said Jefferies &amp; Co. analyst Kavir Dhar. EchoStar
Communications Corp. and Hughes Electronics Corp., which are
combining, sell digital TV on satellite throughout the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "If they don't upgrade, then satellite could steal away more
customers," Dhar said. "That's the longer-term problem."</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia shares fell 61 cents to $9.90 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Chrysler Expects to Post Operating Profit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DaimlerChrysler's U.S. arm Chrysler is expected to post a small
operating profit for the first quarter, climbing back into the black
after six quarters of losses, DaimlerChrysler Chief Executive Juergen
Schrempp said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Schrempp didn't offer specific numbers at a shareholders' meeting
in Berlin, but said the company will post "slightly positive"
earnings at the end of this month.</LD>
<LD>   Operating results ignore such financial items as interest and
taxes, and the cost of Chrysler's ongoing three-year restructuring.
But many auto analysts look to the operating figure as the best clue
to the health of a company's core business.</LD>
<TE>   Schrempp has endured sharp shareholder criticism for taking
Daimler-Benz into a 1998 merger with the U.S. auto maker in an
attempt to forge a global auto giant. Turning around Chrysler would
be a big step toward justifying his grand strategy, which included
the company taking a 37% stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler head Dieter Zetsche, a former Mercedes-Benz executive,
has been leading a cost-cutting campaign at the U.S. group. Chrysler
lost $4.7 billion last year including the costs of the restructuring,
which includes closing six plants and eliminating 26,000 jobs, or
about 20% of Chrysler's work force.</TE>
<TE>   Schrempp also said DaimlerChrysler was sticking with its earlier
forecast that the parent company would more than double its 2001
operating profit of $1.1billion in 2002 this year, while reiterating
that the car maker would not reach an earlier target of operating
profit between $4.8billion and $5.2billion for the year.</TE>
<TE>   "Due to projected economic trends, we will only be able to achieve
these targets at a somewhat later date," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some securities analysts have expressed frustration at Schrempp's
pronouncements on future earnings, saying they are too vague.</TE>
<TE>   Including one-time costs such as the restructuring expenses,
DaimlerChrysler posted a net loss of $1.1billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   In trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange,
DaimlerChrysler shares rose $1.65 to close at $45.81.</TE>

<HD>Confidential Bidders for Global's Assets Revealed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some got a chuckle, others appeared perturbed, but few of the
potential bidders for the assets of Global Crossing Ltd. are likely
to walk away because a lawyer for the telecommunications company
inadvertently revealed their names in an e-mail message.</LD>
<LD>   The message, sent March 28 by a lawyer at Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges
in New York, contained the more than 50 e-mail addresses of those who
had signed confidentiality agreements in exchange for a look at
Global Crossing's books. The bidders did not know whom they were
competing against in what could become a hotly contested auction.</LD>
<LD>   The message contained public information about the bidding
procedures for Global Crossing, a fiber-optic network builder that
filed a bankruptcy petition Jan. 28 that made it the nation's
fourth-biggest corporate collapse. Neither the law firm nor Global
Crossing would comment.</LD>
<TE>   "It was kind of humorous when it first came out, and we need a
little humor with the way the telecommunications industry is," said
one potential bidder, who did not want his name or his company's name
disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   "But it was not appropriate. It's like giving your home number
out."</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail list contained the names of some companies that have
said they may bid for Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Among them are two Los Angeles technology turn-around firms,
Platinum Equity and Gores Technology Group, run by brothers Tom and
Alec Gores, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The long list of e-mail addresses included telecom giants such as
AT&amp;T Corp., Verizon Communications, Deutsche Telekom, Telefonica of
Spain, Telefonos de Mexico and France Telecom that would probably be
looking for any strategic fit that some or all of Global's 100,000
miles of cable could give them.</TE>
<TE>   The list also includes financial investors like the Carlyle Group,
Credit Suisse First Boston, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. CIBC, an early major investor that sold
its Global holdings, said that any interest it might have in bidding
for Global assets would be on behalf of a client.</TE>
<TE>   Most companies contacted would not comment about any interest in
Global.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally speaking, I take commitments of confidentiality and
nondisclosure extremely seriously," said e-mail recipient John Buck,
principal for TenX Capital Partners in Conshohocken, Pa.</TE>

<HD>Hewlett Questions HP's 'Extraordinary' Efforts</HD>

<AU>BRIAN BERGSTEIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Two days before Hewlett-Packard Co. shareholders voted on the
contested purchase of Compaq Computer Corp., HP Chief Executive Carly
Fiorina told another executive they might have to take
"extraordinary" steps to win over two big investors.</LD>
<LD>   Disclosure of Fiorina's late-night message to Chief Financial
Officer Robert Wayman surfaced as HP's last-minute moves to win
support for the $19-billion Compaq deal are at the center of a
lawsuit against the company by dissident director Walter Hewlett.</LD>
<LD>   Hewlett, the son of an HP co-founder and the leader of the proxy
fight against the deal, claims HP improperly got the investment arm
of Deutsche Bank to switch 17million votes in favor of the deal by
threatening to take away future business.</LD>
<TE>   Deutsche Bank had helped arrange a multibillion-dollar line of
credit for HP just days earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett wants a Delaware judge to throw out Deutsche Bank's votes,
which he believes were enough to give HP what Fiorina called a "slim
but sufficient" margin in the March 19 vote.</TE>
<TE>   HP confirmed that Fiorina's message to Wayman was authentic.</TE>
<TE>   The company said that nothing discussed in the message was
improper or illegal.</TE>
<TE>   In her voice mail to Wayman, Fiorina said she and HP's proxy
solicitor were nervous that Deutsche Bank and Northern Trust Corp.,
another large HP shareholder, would reject the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Wayman released a statement saying top HP executives were
constantly assessing whether they had effectively pitched the deal to
large investors and "did in fact make extraordinary efforts" in the
final days, with dozens of last-minute presentations.</TE>
<TE>   HP shares closed up 31 cents at $17.72 and Compaq shares closed up
48 cents at $9.76, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Files Suits in Crackdown on Tax Scams</HD>
<DH>Courts: Three people allegedly sold bogus trusts that
defrauded the government of more than $135 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Justice Department said Wednesday that it filed a series of
lawsuits as part of a continuing crackdown on complicated tax schemes
that cost the federal government an estimated $3 billion a year.</LD>
<LD>   In suits filed in San Diego, Boston and Cincinnati, the government
alleges that three individuals defrauded the U.S. of more than $135
million by selling bogus trusts to hundreds of taxpayers.</LD>
<LD>   Trusts are legal entities that can hold assets and be used to
distribute property.</LD>
<TE>   Bogus trusts, especially offshore trusts, have become a hot area
for tax cheats, who often use them to disguise the true owner of
taxable assets.</TE>
<TE>   The Internal Revenue Service is cracking down on the trusts, which
are heavily promoted in advertisements and over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's technology has made marketing tax fraud schemes
incredibly easy," said Eileen J. O'Connor, assistant attorney general
in charge of the Justice Department's tax division.</TE>
<TE>   "While the promoters of these schemes say they lead to tax
savings, they can lead instead to substantial penalties, including a
prison sentence," O'Connor said.</TE>
<TE>   Trusts can be used for many legitimate business and estate
planning purposes, such as leaving an inheritance to a minor child or
a charity.</TE>
<TE>   However, the IRS has been pursuing promoters who establish
multiple trusts that are used to hide the true owner of taxable
income or to fabricate deductions.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to asking that the defendants be barred from violating
tax laws in the future, the Justice Department is asking the courts
to force the promoters to turn over lists of clients, who could then
be targeted for future tax audits.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS is increasingly employing this strategy to catch thousands
of cheating taxpayers. The agency recently reached agreements with
several large credit card issuers that will provide records of their
clients' credit card transactions from offshore banks. These banks
often are used by U.S. residents who hold their assets in offshore
trusts to avoid income taxes, accessing their money with credit
cards.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS believes that as many as 2 million Americans may be
skirting tax laws by using these offshore trusts. The credit records
are expected to help the agency establish the extent and nature of
the cheating, potentially leading to thousands of prosecutions for
tax evasion and fraud.</TE>
<TE>   In the case filed Wednesday in San Diego, the government alleges
that Roderick Prescott of Solana Beach sold hundreds of scam trust
packages through a company called Trust Educational Services.</TE>
<TE>   The program Prescott promotes involves setting up a series of
business and personal trusts that will hold the taxpayers' personal
property, ranging from homes to cars and equipment. The trusts then
charge each other for services, creating fictional tax deductions,
the suit alleges.</TE>
<TE>   The taxpayer's home is called "trust headquarters," allowing the
taxpayer to improperly deduct living expenses as business costs
related to managing all of the trusts.</TE>
<TE>   Prescott denied the allegations Wednesday, but said he had not yet
seen the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything and everything we have advocated has always been in
keeping with IRS codes and regulations," said Prescott, who said he
runs a seminar business. "I don't sell trusts. I sell education. We
have always advocated that people pay whatever taxes are due."</TE>
<TE>   In the Boston case, filed against Kevin Mahoney of Attleboro,
Mass., the U.S. alleges that Mahoney sold so-called pass-through
trusts. Individuals use this type of trust to deduct all personal
expenses by using a series of trusts. The U.S. alleges the trusts are
a sham and seeks to enjoin Mahoney from selling or promoting them.</TE>
<TE>   Mahoney said he prepares legal documents on behalf of attorneys,
but has never advocated tax fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "Somehow, the IRS has decided to make us the soup of the day and
say that we are doing something illegal. That is absolutely not
true," Mahoney said. "We advocate paying whatever tax you owe."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Welti, an accountant from Ripley, Ohio, was charged in the
suit filed in Cincinnati with preparing false tax returns for clients
in 20 states. Welti's actions, which involve setting up trusts based
in Belize, have cost the government an estimated $3 million a year,
according to the Justice Department's complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Welti said he was acting properly. It's the IRS and the Justice
Department that are breaking the law by assessing income taxes on
money earned while working in the United States, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Citing a series of books and Internet sites, Welti said only
income derived from foreign sources or criminal activity is taxable.
The IRS maintains that such arguments are frivolous and the agency's
position has been consistently upheld by federal tax courts.</TE>
<TE>   The government suit seeks to bar Welti from preparing future tax
returns and force him to provide a list of his clients.</TE>

<HD>SEC May Proceed Against KPMG</HD>
<DH>Probe: Agency is in talks with firm about possible
securities violations while an auditor for Xerox.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>KPMG is in talks with the Securities and Exchange Commission about
possible securities violations the fifth-largest U.S. accounting firm
may have committed while serving as auditor for Xerox Corp.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been talking with the SEC staff about the possibility of a
proceeding against the firm," KPMG spokesman George Ledwith said. "No
final decisions have been made."</LD>
<LD>   John Heine, a spokesman for the SEC, declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   Xerox, the largest copier maker, last week tentatively agreed to
pay a record $10-million fine and restate results since 1997 to
settle claims that it prematurely booked revenue from equipment
leases in a manner that could have inflated sales and profit. The
settlement ended an almost two-year investigation of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox resisted SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt's effort to have companies
cooperate with investigators, a person knowledgeable about the
investigation said. Pitt said in October that companies may get
reduced penalties when they disclose abuses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of the ratcheting up of the concern over auditing,"
Alan Bromberg, a securities law professor at Southern Methodist
University, said about the possible action against KPMG.</TE>
<TE>   Enron Corp.'s collapse last year and the indictment of its
auditor, Andersen, has led to increased government scrutiny of
complex financial reporting.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG, Xerox's auditor for 30 years, delayed signing Xerox's 2000
annual report and, at the time, insisted on a broader internal review
of the company's accounting after information from the SEC
investigation was shown to KPMG, Ledwith said. Xerox fired KPMG five
months after the auditor signed off on the filing.</TE>
<TE>   "We are bewildered if this is evidence of what happens after we
did the right thing--served our role as independent auditors, raised
the right questions and took difficult tough positions with our
clients," Ledwith said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that KPMG
partner Michael Conway, who helped lead the Xerox audit, received a
so-called Wells notice from the SEC giving him a chance to prepare a
case against being charged. Ledwith said he was "not at liberty to
discuss an individual."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Allaire, Xerox's former chairman and chief executive, along
with former Chief Financial Officer Barry Romeril, also were notified
by the SEC of possible sanctions, the paper reported, citing people
close to the investigation. Allaire and Romeril couldn't be reached
for comment.</TE>

<HD>Focus on Defense, Industrial Stocks Perks Up the Dow</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Broad market gains despite earnings fears,
carrying battered tech sector along.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dow Jones industrial average scored its biggest one-day gain in
five weeks Wednesday as investors scooped up industrial and defense
stocks and scoured the wreckage of the tech sector.</LD>
<LD>   "The parade of bad news still marches in [tech] but ... there are
other areas that are doing well," said Erick Maronak, research
director at NewBridge Partners. "After a very trying February and an
OK March, investors probably figure things have come back a little
and it's not a bad idea to [buy]."</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 173.06 points, or 1.7%,
to 10,381.73--its biggest one-day point gain since March 4. The broad
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 1.1% to 1,130.47.</LD>
<TE>   The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index gained 24.50 points, or
1.4%, to 1,767.07, after hitting its lowest close in five weeks
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   Profit jitters have plagued the market since a surprise warning
from IBM on Monday. There was still plenty for investors to worry
about as they braced for next week's flood of earnings reports.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of WorldCom tumbled 12%, losing 66 cents to $4.77, to hit
near 10-year lows amid worries it would post grim results. And AOL
Time Warner dropped $1.15 to $20.70, falling to lows not seen since
1998, as concerns about its growth prospects intensified after the
head of its flagship Internet unit was replaced Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Earnings concerns are still out there," said David Memmott, head
of listed block trading at Morgan Stanley. "Next week is the real
beginning of technology earnings, and with IBM warning a couple of
days ago, there is a lot of nervousness out there. It looks like it's
going to be a tough quarter."</TE>
<TE>   Cisco Systems rose 73 cents, or almost 5%, to $15.55. IBM's
warning, its first in more than a decade, helped fuel rumors Tuesday
that Cisco would warn as well, sparking a sell-off in the stock.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, however, Wall Street came to Cisco's defense.
Merrill Lynch said it believes Cisco will meet estimates, but the
final weeks of the quarter will be crucial. UBS Warburg said it
doesn't believe a profit warning is likely.</TE>
<TE>   Investors found plenty of other attractive stocks Wednesday.
Industrial shares gaining on optimism about an economic recovery
included GM, up $2.03 to $62.48; Caterpillar, up $1.61 to $59.49; and
Honeywell, up $2.31 to $39.95.</TE>
<TE>   Among other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Consumer shares were strong. Procter &amp; Gamble helped the Dow
with a gain of $2.21 to $92.34 after Chief Executive A.G. Lafley said
it should meet its long-term sales and earnings growth goals in
fiscal 2003. Sears Roebuck, the No.4 U.S. retailer, jumped $2.98 to
$54.18. The company forecast stronger-than-expected first quarter
earnings.</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of real estate investment trusts rose, continuing a
powerful advance in recent weeks. The Bloomberg index of 148 REITs
rose 1.1%. Prentiss Properties surged $1.20 to $31.45 and Centerpoint
Properties jumped 75 cents to $56.75.</TE>
<TE>   * Nvidia, which makes chips for the Microsoft Xbox game system,
fell $2.25 to $38.51. Analysts are saying Xbox consoles may fall
short of sales expectations. Microsoft rose $1.43 to $56.30.</TE>
<TE>   * Biotechnology stocks rallied. Genentech, the world's No.2
biotech company, jumped $2.07 to $43.12. After Tuesday's close, the
company said first-quarter net income more than tripled. And Idec
Pharmaceuticals gained $3.76 to $61.70. The company said it expects
quarterly earnings per share to jump from a year ago, driven by
sharply increased sales of its cancer drug Rituxan.</TE>
<TE>   * Allergan rose $3.91 to $62.61 after a UBS Warburg analyst raised
his rating on the stock to "buy" from "hold."</TE>
<TE>   * In foreign trading, Mexico's main share index rocketed 3.4% to a
52-week high. The Mexican market is up 18% this year.</TE>

<HD>Judge Denies States' Request to Bring In Microsoft
Interviews</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Nine states pursuing the antitrust case against Microsoft Corp.
suffered a setback Wednesday, when the judge rejected a request to
freely introduce transcripts and video of interviews with 18
Microsoft officials, including Chairman Bill Gates.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said the nine states,
which are seeking stiff sanctions against Microsoft, should have made
their request earlier under a timetable she issued before the
hearings began.</LD>
<LD>   "Before the trial started, something should have been said," said
Kollar-Kotelly, who is weighing what remedies should apply against
Microsoft for illegally maintaining its Windows monopoly in personal
computer operating systems.</LD>
<TE>   A video of Gates almost certainly would prompt comparison with
video played during the original Microsoft trial nearly four years
ago, in which he appeared uncooperative and quibbled with government
lawyers over the meaning of common words.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said she would allow portions of the pre-hearing
depositions to be entered during cross-examination of Microsoft
employees if the material was touched on in their written testimony.
She added that she might make some exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   The nine states, nearing the end of their 16-witness slate, had
approached Kollar-Kotelly over the weekend seeking to introduce
transcripts and play up to an hour of video in resting their case.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly also is considering whether to endorse a proposed
settlement of the case reached between Microsoft and the Justice
Department in November.</TE>
<TE>   In court Wednesday, Microsoft lawyer John Warden objected to the
introduction of the depositions, saying the software giant would have
conducted its defense differently if it had known earlier about the
states' plan.</TE>
<TE>   "There is obviously a clear prejudice when the number of witnesses
more than doubles" for the states, Warden said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the states said they misunderstood the deadline for
requesting that the depositions be entered as evidence, thinking they
could notify the court within five days of resting their case.</TE>

<HD>Oil Prices Rise as Strike Grips Venezuela</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Unrest disrupts crude supplies from the
fourth-largest exporter to the United States. Protest leaders say the
labor action will continue indefinitely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Oil prices rose as Venezuela's worst labor strife in 30 years began
to disrupt supplies from the fourth-largest exporter of crude to the
U.S., highlighting the importance of the sometimes overlooked Latin
country to the world market.</LD>
<LD>   Benchmark crude prices rose 31 cents Wednesday to $26.13 a barrel
in New York as Venezuela was paralyzed for a second day by a general
strike called to protest the policies of President Hugo Chavez. Only
Saudi Arabia, Canada and Mexico exported more oil to the United
States last year.</LD>
<LD>   Some analysts said this week that as much as half of Venezuelan
crude shipments, which averaged 1.28 million barrels a day to the
U.S. last year, have been lost to the strike.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. oil market, they said, could easily absorb such a loss
for a short period, but prices would begin to spike if the
interruption stretches out.</TE>
<TE>   "We have solid reports of lack of loading and ships queuing up in
Venezuela. There are more than 25 empty oil tankers lined up at
various terminals around the country waiting for oil," John Kingston,
global oil director at Platts, a division of McGraw-Hill, said
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Late Wednesday, labor leaders announced that the strike would
continue indefinitely. It was unclear whether that would cut oil
output even further.</TE>
<TE>   Although Iraq's suspension of oil shipments has grabbed most of
the headlines in recent days, analysts said a disruption of
Venezuelan crude poses a more direct threat to U.S. fuel supplies and
prices.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes 40 days for Mideast oil to reach the United States,
whereas with Venezuela, Canada and Mexico, the lag is much shorter
and so you feel the impact of an interruption a little quicker," said
Doug MacIntyre, a senior market analyst with the Energy Information
Service, a unit of the U.S. Energy Department.</TE>
<TE>   Oil workers, members of other unions and nonunion white-collar
workers participated in the stoppage Tuesday and Wednesday that shut
down about 80% of Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, as the
state-owned oil company is known.</TE>
<TE>   The government called in emergency workers Wednesday to boost
production, but with unknown results.</TE>
<TE>   Oil markets were relieved Tuesday when Saudi Arabia said it would
make up for any loss of global supply caused by an Iraqi suspension.</TE>
<TE>   But continued Venezuelan strife and the increasingly polarized
political atmosphere there are making traders increasingly nervous.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez has sought to politicize PDVSA by naming a leftist
professor as president and five low-level employees, believed to be
Chavez's cronies, as board members, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The actions, they said, reverse a process during the 1990s when
PDVSA was streamlined and made to operate more as an independent
business.</TE>
<TE>   Not only have Venezuelan oil shipments been cut in half, but
gasoline shipments from Venezuelan refineries, which are especially
important to East Coast wholesale markets, also have been hurt,
sending wholesale prices up, said Adam Sieminski of Deutsche Bank in
Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   El Palito refinery in central Venezuela, responsible for nearly 1
million barrels of gasoline a day, was forced to shut down Tuesday,
with others slowing to a halt.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. wholesale gasoline prices, which dipped dramatically after
the Sept. 11 attacks, now are back up to about 84 cents a gallon,
where they were during most of last year before the attacks,
Sieminski said.</TE>
<TE>   Oil analyst Michael Rothman of Merrill Lynch in New York said a
big risk to global oil markets is the prospect of increasing
political and labor disarray in Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   "There is some concern that the electric power industry might
follow the PDVSA and white-collar workers into a strike, in which
case things would become more complicated," said Rothman, who added
that he believes any disruption of Venezuelan oil supply will be
short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   The United States imports about 9.1 million barrels of crude a
day, or roughly 45% of its consumption. Venezuela accounts for about
13% of U.S. imports.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Giusti, a former head of PDVSA and now a senior advisor at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in
Washington, said the labor conditions at PDVSA have reached a low
point as a result of Chavez's reshuffling of management.</TE>
<TE>   "The government has shown great contempt for the employees, it's
attacked them, threatened them, fired some executives, pushed others
past the point of no return. So the employees have responded with
what's been called Operation Turtle. Everything is slowing down."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq had been exporting about 1.5million barrels a day to world
customers, just a fraction of the 76million barrels of petroleum the
world consumes daily.</TE>
<TE>   But there is generally little margin for shortages, so any change
in the supply chain can produce a wild price response that may seem
out of proportion to the cause.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico, also one of the top exporters to the U.S., is not an
avenue the United States can turn to if Mideast or Venezuelan
supplies get tight, since Mexico operates its oil wells at 100%
capacity, Rothman said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Mideast jitters and the turmoil in Venezuela, analysts
said odds are that oil prices are more likely to head down than up in
coming days and weeks, given current market conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Morse, executive advisor of Hess Energy Trading Co. in New
York, said current prices are significantly above historical averages
and "that would indicate these prices are not sustainable."</TE>
<TE>   "We are at price levels that, if sustained, bring on investment,
and that brings on new supply and that saturates the market and pulls
down prices," Morse said.</TE>
<TE>   But Venezuela is something of a wild card that definitely has oil
analysts' attention, said MacIntyre of the Energy Information
Administration.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly something to monitor, especially now that it's the
time of year when refineries start to run more crude to gear up for
the summer driving season. Any disruption to a smooth flow could
certainly provide a little jar to the system," he said.</TE>

<HD>New Loan Considered to Limit Refinancing</HD>
<DH>Mortgages: Lenders may offer lower rates to borrowers who
agree to the restrictions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. mortgage lenders may introduce a home mortgage that could not be
refinanced during the first two years of the loan--an effort to
protect a key source of profit for the banking industry.</LD>
<LD>   Executives at an industry conference in Chicago said this week
that they believe borrowers could be enticed to take loans with
refinancing restrictions in return for lower rates.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, the mortgage banking industry processed $2 trillion in
mortgage loans as rates fell to historic lows. More than half of this
record business was related to processing loan refinancing
applications for homeowners seeking to cut monthly mortgage payments
and to squeeze equity out of their home through cash-out
refinancings. Some borrowers refinanced their loans three times last
year.</LD>
<TE>   This immense volume of business related to refinancings was a
source of profit for mortgage lenders, but the business of servicing
a pool of loans--the collection of monthly loan payments that is an
important source of profit--was tricky. Many loans that were
refinanced were sources of profit that servicing companies lost to
their competition.</TE>
<TE>   Some lenders are considering creating a type of loan that could
not be refinanced for 24 to 30 months, said David Olson, managing
director at Wholesale Access, a mortgage research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Although mortgage rates have risen from their historic lows and
refinancings have cooled, lenders are looking to protect themselves
from future declines in rates because technology has made the
refinancing process faster.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been the Achilles' heel of the market," said Tom LaMalfa
of Wholesale Access.</TE>
<TE>   "Not one lender is against this," said LaMalfa, who added that
this is not a new idea but one that has gained favor in the wake of
2001's massive refinancing wave.</TE>
<TE>   Also, securities backed by home loans have been prepaid because of
refinancings, forcing investors to put their money back to work in a
low-rate environment where yields are lower for portfolio managers.</TE>

<HD>Defense Stocks Still Posting Solid Gains</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Extending an extraordinary run-up that began in earnest after
Sept.11, defense-related stocks surged again Wednesday as investors
continued to embrace the prospect of sharply higher Pentagon
spending.</LD>
<LD>   Even though some analysts are warning that the sector is just
about played out and shares are fully valued for now, momentum
continues to build with new buy recommendations.</LD>
<LD>   In a run-up not seen since the hefty defense spending days of the
Reagan administration in the early 1980s, shares of some major
defense contractors have jumped by more than 60% since the terrorist
attacks, with many of them reaching 52-week highs during recent
weeks.</LD>
<TE>   Lockheed Martin Corp. rose $1.43 on Wednesday to close at $61.03,
the highest in more than three years and more than triple the value
of its shares in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   A Lockheed investor who purchased 100 shares for $1,700 two years
ago had a paper profit of $4,400 on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Defense is a magic word again," said Paul H. Nisbet, a longtime
defense analyst with JSA Research Inc. "People are jumping in."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's surge in defense stocks was partly attributed to an
announcement that investment firm UBS Warburg is beginning coverage
of the industry and is recommending investors buy stocks of several
defense firms, including General Dynamics Corp., Raytheon Co. and
Lockheed.</TE>
<TE>   Coupled with a broader market gain, the entire defense sector
appeared to benefit.</TE>
<TE>   General Dynamics climbed $1.36 to $96.07, Raytheon gained 97 cents
to $39.67, and Northrop Grumman Corp. rose $2.90 to $117.65.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect the group to outperform the general market in the
current environment of higher defense budgets, economic uncertainty
and war," wrote UBS analyst David Strauss, who said Lockheed stock
could rise to $68, General Dynamics to $108 and Raytheon to $50.</TE>
<TE>   But some longtime defense analysts weren't as bullish, cautioning
investors that the fundamentals of the industry have not changed
since the Bush administration proposed a 14% increase in defense
spending, the largest such jump in 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, some analysts have recently switched their
recommendations to "hold," believing defense stocks have climbed as
high as they can go for now.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to believe that some analysts and investors are using
U.S. defense budget growth rates as a proxy for defense company
growth rates," Byron K. Callan, a Merrill Lynch Co. analyst said in a
report Wednesday to investors.</TE>
<TE>   "This is flawed, in our view, because most major defense/aerospace
companies derive no more than 60% to 70% of their sales directly and
indirectly from the Department of Defense," Callan said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are little bit rich in our perspective," said Todd B. Ernst,
a Prudential Securities Inc. analyst, who has a "hold" recommendation
for most of the major defense stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Wednesday's surge seemed to signal that investors weren't
going to stop flocking to defense stocks any time soon, particularly
for those that appear better positioned for the kind of defense
spending that analysts are expecting.</TE>
<TE>   An index of 16 major defense shares gained 2.6% on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The index, which includes Boeing Co., General Dynamics, Lockheed
Martin and Northrop Grumman, has surged more than 30% since Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest beneficiaries have been companies such as L-3
Communications Holdings Inc. that primarily are focused on making
defense communications and electronic devices.</TE>
<TE>   L-3 Communications climbed $3.28 to $123.81, a record high, on
some optimistic comments from an analyst at CIBC World Markets. L-3
is up more than 45% since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "As we go into the procurement up cycle, there are several
companies that are better positioned than others," said CIBC's
Stephen J. Murphy, who has a "buy" recommendation for L-3.</TE>
<TE>   "We think there is going to be accelerating growth, and that's
getting reflected in the stock prices of certain companies."</TE>
<TE>   The run-up also has prompted a few mid-size defense companies to
go public, including Integrated Defense Technologies Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The Huntsville, Ala.-based company began trading in February at
$25 and closed Wednesday at $30.90, up 70 cents.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Oklahoma's Supreme Court has upheld a multimillion-dollar verdict
against Ford Motor Co. in a case charging the No. 2 auto maker built
and sold an "unreasonably dangerous vehicle" because of an allegedly
defective seat belt in a Ford Ranger pickup truck.</LD>
<LD>   The product liability case was brought by the parents of Ricky
Johnson, 19, who suffered severe injuries including permanent brain
damage when his truck careened off a road near his home in Tecumseh,
Okla., in June 1997 and plowed into the bottom of a creek.</LD>
<LD>   With interest compounded since the first ruling against it, Ford
must now pay Johnson and his family more than $6.5 million, according
to Lydia JoAnn Barrett, one of the plaintiff's attorneys.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson's parents argued his injuries were caused when the sharp
edge of his seat belt latch plate cut through the belt during the
crash, rendering it useless and allowing him to slam his head into
the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Ford has long denied any responsibility for Johnson's injuries,
arguing that there was nothing wrong with the seat belt.</TE>

<HD>Herbalife to Go Private in Merger Deal</HD>

<BD>A Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Herbalife International Inc., a multilevel marketer of nutritional
and weight-management products, said it has agreed to be acquired by
two private equity firms for about $685 million.</LD>
<LD>   Under the merger agreement with Whitney &amp; Co. and Golden Gate
Capital Inc. announced late Wednesday, shareholders of
Westchester-based Herbalife will receive $19.50 a share in cash for
each share they own. In Nasdaq trading, Herbalife's Class A shares
closed up 24 cents at $15.39 and the Class B shares closed up 16
cents at $14.40 before the deal was announced.</LD>
<LD>   Herbalife Chief Executive Frank Tirelli said the deal "provides a
solid foundation with committed, long-term investors dedicated to the
future success of Herbalife."</LD>
<TE>   Last July, two major Herbalife investors urged the board to put
the firm up for sale, citing concern over its direction since the
death of its charismatic leader, Mark Hughes. Hughes, who founded the
company in 1980, died in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Whitney, based in Stamford, Conn., manages about $5 billion of
assets for major endowments and pension plans. San Francisco-based
Golden Gate Capital is an investment firm with about $700 million of
capital under management.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Texas judge is threatening to jail and fine lawyers with Houston
firm Vinson &amp; Elkins for "intentionally" causing a mistrial in a
quadriplegic's suit against Bridgestone Corp.'s Firestone unit.</LD>
<LD>   Matagorda County District Judge Craig Estlinbaum declared a
mistrial last week when the tire maker's lawyers violated a court
order barring any mention of the plaintiff's marijuana use. The judge
ordered Firestone and its lawyers to show why he shouldn't impose as
much as six months in jail and $500 each in fines for contempt.</LD>
<LD>   Relatives of Erin Brunner claim a faulty Firestone tire
contributed to the 1999 rollover of a Ford Explorer that left the
22-year-old paralyzed.</LD>
<TE>   Vinson &amp; Elkins attorney Morgan Copeland told jurors that Brunner,
another passenger and the vehicle's driver had bought a bag of
marijuana before driving from California to Texas. Neither Firestone
nor Vinson &amp; Elkins had any immediate comment.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>SunTrust Banks Inc., the 10th-biggest U.S. bank, said first-quarter
profit dropped 9.7% on a jump in bad loans, including losses related
to Enron Corp. The bank is eliminating jobs to cut costs.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell to $304.9 million, or $1.06 a share, from $337.5
million, or $1.15 a share, in the same period last year. The
Atlanta-based bank reported a 79% rise, to $118.5 million, in loans
that can't be collected.</LD>
<LD>   The results for SunTrust, the first of the 10 largest U.S. banks
to report first-quarter earnings, indicate rising bad loans are
damping profits for banks and may hinder an economic rebound,
analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   The bank will eliminate jobs "sharply and quickly" and freeze
hiring to control costs as the recovery from the recession lags
expectations, Chief Executive L. Phillip Humann told analysts.</TE>
<TE>   SunTrust shares rose 23 cents to $67.28 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co. said first-quarter profit will rise more

<HD>Sears Says Profit Will Beat Forecasts by 50%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. estimated Wednesday that first-quarter profit
will beat the Wall Street consensus forecast by more than 50% after
savings from job cuts and other restructuring activities bolstered
its retail earnings.</LD>
<LD>   The news drove shares of the No. 4 U.S. retailer to their highest
level since July 1998.</LD>
<LD>   The shares ended the trading session up $2.98, or 5.8%, at $54.18
on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   Sears said it expects first-quarter earnings of 93 cents a share
before special items, up from 45 cents a year earlier. Estimates from
eight analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call averaged 61
cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Sears said first-quarter operating earnings in its retail business
were up $104 million from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   It also said it expects a 20% increase in earnings from its credit
business.</TE>
<TE>   "All of our businesses did well in the first quarter," Chief
Executive Alan Lacy said.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Sears announced a broad three-year restructuring for
its 860 department stores. The plan included cutting 4,900 salaried
jobs, trimming unprofitable product lines and overhauling its apparel
business.</TE>
<TE>   Sears also made plans in January to cut about 3,600 field
positions, eliminating three to five jobs in each of its department
stores.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest quarter, Sears expects to take a noncash charge of
64 cents a share for an accounting change, an 18-cent gain from the
sale of an investment in Advance Auto Parts and a 13-cent charge
related to Sears Canada's plan to convert Eaton stores.</TE>
<TE>   Including those items, Sears said it expects first-quarter
earnings of 34 cents a share, down from 53 cents a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Sears also raised its forecast for full-year profit growth to 17%
from a previous outlook of 13% to 15%. The company earned $4.22 a
share in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at domestic stores open at least a year fell 4.7% in March
from a year earlier, Sears said. It had forecast a low single-digit
decline on a percentage basis. Total sales in March fell 1.8% to
$2.52 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Consulting Group, said
investors should not worry about the sluggish sales growth. "They are
very much on the right track," he said.</TE>

<HD>Ex-PacifiCare CEO Named President of Health Net Unit</HD>

<LD>Former PacifiCare Chief Executive Christopher Wing was named
president of Health Net of California on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Wing, 44, was president and CEO of Santa Ana-based PacifiCare of
California, another major health insurer, until March when he
resigned to pursue other interests. He was replaced by James A. Frey,
PacifiCare's senior vice president of branding and strategic
initiatives.</LD>
<LD>   The two companies are on very different tracks. Woodland
Hills-based Health Net Inc. saw its profit for the fourth quarter of
2001 increase 21% as it cut costs and debt and added enrollment. For
the same period, PacifiCare lost $26.4 million, contrasted with net
income of $12million the previous year.</LD>
<TE>   "PacifiCare is still in its turnaround. Health Net has been
through theirs and is growing," said Wing, who added that the major
challenges in his job are to continue building enrollment and rolling
out new product.</TE>
<TE>   Wing said California's health plans are underfunded and face broad
challenges in the near future, including demands on hospitals that
threaten to drive premium increases higher than current double-digit
rates.</TE>
<TE>   Wing cited minimum staffing requirements for nurses despite a
major nursing shortage, a loss of Medicare funding, high energy costs
and state-mandated seismic retrofits as some of the "major strains"
on the state's hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "They will have to pass those costs on to private payers, and
we'll have to raise premiums or allow hospitals to close their
doors," said Wing. "This is a huge issue for California."</TE>
<TE>   Health Net shares rose 7 cents to $27 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Telecom Worries Send WorldCom Shares Lower</HD>
<DH>Outlook: Some analysts expect 2002 sales forecast will be
reduced. Stock falls 12%; bonds also drop in value.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of AT&amp;T's archrival, WorldCom Inc., slumped to a new
multi-year low Wednesday on fears that corporate spending on telecom
services won't revive soon.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom Group, the stock that represents the company's commercial
data and Internet businesses, slid 66 cents, or 12%, to $4.77 on
Nasdaq, the lowest price since 1992.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom MCI, which tracks the firm's long-distance unit, dropped
60 cents, or 12%, to $4.32, also on Nasdaq. The MCI stock began
trading last year.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom's bonds also tumbled in value, traders said.</TE>
<TE>   The company's investors worry that "slow growth in revenues for
the telecom industry will continue throughout 2002," said Rosemarie
Kalinowski, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, which rates the
company's debt BBB-plus, three notches above junk status. The rating
company has a negative outlook on the debt, meaning WorldCom is more
likely to be downgraded than not.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, which is the subject of an accounting investigation by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in February that its
data unit's 2002 sales would rise by a mid-single-digit percentage
rate. But some analysts expect the forecast will be reduced when the
firm posts first-quarter results April 25.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts also have warned that the firm is likely to cut the
dividend it pays on the MCI stock. The annual dividend now is $2.40 a
share, which provides a huge annualized yield of 55.5% based on the
stock's closing price Wednesday--that is, if the company continues
the dividend at the current rate.</TE>
<TE>   Claire Hassett, a spokeswoman for Clinton, Miss.-based WorldCom,
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom is cutting network costs to make up for slowing sales.
The company last week announced the elimination of 3,700 jobs at the
data unit.</TE>

<HD>E-Trade to Pay at Least $100 Million for Tradescape</HD>
<DH>Securities: Brokerage expects trading volume to balloon
with exposure to 'highly active' clients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>E-Trade Group Inc. said Wednesday that it will pay at least $100
million for a specialty service that will nearly double its stock
trading volume and trump rival Ameritrade Holding Corp.'s plans to be
the busiest online broker.</LD>
<LD>   With the purchase of New York-based Tradescape Corp. and its
portfolio of gung-ho stock traders, Menlo Park, Calif.-based E-Trade
expects its volume to balloon from a daily average of 114,000 trades
in 2001 to more than 200,000 when the deal closes this summer.</LD>
<LD>   Omaha-based Ameritrade projects a daily volume of 164,000 trades
after it completes its $1.3-billion takeover of Datek Online Holdings
Corp., a deal announced Monday. San Francisco-based Charles Schwab
Corp., which boasts the most online brokerage accounts, handles about
152,000 online trades daily.</LD>
<TE>   E-Trade expects Tradescape, founded in 1997, to give the company
more than just bragging rights.</TE>
<TE>   The deal will expose E-Trade to a new breed of customer--"highly
active" traders who take their investments so seriously that they
prefer not to buy and sell stocks from their home computers. Instead,
these traders gather in 19 Tradescape offices around the country and
immerse themselves in a whirl of information as they wheel and deal
with the zeal of Wall Street professionals.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys view this as if it's their job and they want to be
doing it around other traders," said Jarrett Lilien, E-Trade's chief
brokerage officer.</TE>
<TE>   Like other online brokerages, E-Trade's business has suffered
during the last two years as the stock market's steep downturn scared
off casual day traders who had flocked to the Web in the late 1990s
when unprofitable Internet companies soared in value.</TE>
<TE>   Tradescape customers, though, have continued to trade at a robust
rate even during the volatility of the last two years, making
E-Trade's acquisition look like a good move, said analyst Richard
Repetto of Putnam Lovell Securities.</TE>
<TE>   "This helps diversify their business by giving them a new segment
of the market," Repetto said.</TE>
<TE>   E-Trade has been diversifying in the other direction over the last
year, adding banking services and other non-trader-oriented services
as Wall Street's deep bear market has soured many investors on
stocks.</TE>
<TE>   As a privately held company, Tradescape doesn't disclose profit,
but the company is apparently bullish about its prospects: If
Tradescape's business hits its aggressive earnings targets during the
rest of this year and next year, E-Trade has agreed to boost the
purchase price from $100 million to as much as $280 million.</TE>
<TE>   E-Trade will pay in stock. Its shares Wednesday gained 9 cents to
close at $9.05 on the New York Stock Exchange before the news was
announced. They slipped to $9 in after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   Tradescape's offices are spread through 10 states: New York,
Texas, Florida, New Jersey, Colorado, Connecticut, California,
Georgia, Illinois and Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate deal Wednesday, E-Trade said it will pay brokerage
A.B. Watley Group Inc. $5 million for the ownership rights to stock
trading technology that it has previously licensed for use on its
site.</TE>

<LD>A former brokerage and its owner must repay nearly $1.1 million in
lost savings to nine investors who claimed they were never told it
could be risky to buy government-backed bonds with borrowed funds, a
National Assn. of Securities Dealers panel ruled.</LD>
<LD>   Arbitrators awarded the damages against Long Securities Corp., a
defunct Glendale firm that specialized in government-backed mortgage
securities, and its owner, Lawrence S. Jay. Jay's attorney, H. Thomas
Fehn, couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Heavy mortgage prepayments in 1998 cut the value of certain
securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Assn. by about
5%, a loss magnified to 20% for the investors because so many of the
bonds were purchased on margin in their accounts, said Montgomery
Griffin, a Newport Beach consultant who advised the investors.</LD>

<HD>Yahoo Posts Loss as Online Advertising Remains Sluggish</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The Internet giant meets estimates for operating
profit and raises the forecasts for the rest of the year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Internet media giant Yahoo Inc. reported its sixth consecutive
quarterly loss Wednesday because of lingering weakness in online
advertising, but increased forecasts for the rest of the year, saying
its momentum was picking up.</LD>
<LD>   However, analysts responded with confusion over whether the higher
forecasts for the rest of the year were entirely because of the
acquisition of the online career site HotJobs or also showed progress
in other areas.</LD>
<LD>   The company closed the acquisition of HotJobs during the first
quarter and said it had already started to bring large volumes of job
seekers to the site.</LD>
<TE>   Yahoo shares slipped 2 cents, to $18.44 in regular Nasdaq trading.
After the close, when the earnings were announced, the stock rose to
nearly $19 before drifting as low as $17.85.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo reported a first-quarter net loss of $53.7 million, or 9
cents per share, compared with a net loss of $11.5 million, or 2
cents per share, a year earlier. On an operating basis, excluding
unusual items, the company turned a profit of $10.5 million, or 2
cents per share, compared with a loss of $11.5 million, or 2 cents
per share, last year.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts on average had been looking for an operating profit of 2
cents per share, according to research firm Thomson Financial/First
Call. Estimates ranged from 1 cent to 2 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo said its revenue rose to $192.7 million from $180.2 million
in the year-ago first quarter, which was well above forecasts for
revenue of $175.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which has been working for more than a year to reduce
its dependence on online advertising by adding more fee-based
services, provided little detail on the performance of any such
service that has been recently introduced. In a statement, Chief
Executive Terry Semel did say that the first-quarter performance
reflected the overall success of these efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The company also said it now expects to report second-quarter
revenue of between $205 million and $225 million, and to show
full-year revenue of between $870 million and $910 million.</TE>
<TE>   That increase will be at least partly due to the acquisition of
the online career site HotJobs, whose results had not previously been
included in financial guidance.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A bill to name a post office in Santa Ana after longtime Orange
County postmaster Hector Godinez passed unanimously Wednesday in the
House of Representatives.</LD>
<LD>   The bill was written by Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden Grove) and
co-sponsored by the entire California delegation. Rep. Christopher

Santa Ana. He later was named Southern California district manager
for the U.S. Postal Service. When he died in 1999, he had spent 46
years with the post office.</LD>
<TE>   Godinez was a founding member of the Santa Ana League of United
American Citizens, was a trustee for Rancho Santiago Community
College District for 17 years and was the first Latino president of
the Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   The bill moves to the Senate for approval, then to President Bush.</TE>

<HD>Salvation Mountain Artist Has Blessings Bestowed on His
Work</HD>
<DH>Landmark: Labor of love in the desert is deemed a national
folk art shrine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NILAND, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Fame has found Leonard Knight, the religiously inspired artist who
has spent 16 years in the desert of Imperial County painting "God Is
Love" and other inspirational messages on a mound of baked earth that
he calls Salvation Mountain.</LD>
<LD>   After years of happy obscurity, the 70-year-old Knight and his
multicolored creation have caught the notice of art scholars.</LD>
<LD>   The Folk Art Society of America has declared his site a national
folk art shrine.</LD>
<TE>   What Knight calls a mountain is actually a sloping, terraced hill
about three stories high and 100 feet wide.</TE>
<TE>   The land is controlled by the state of California, which views
Knight as a trespasser but does nothing to evict him.</TE>
<TE>   With an estimated 100,000 gallons of donated paint, Knight has
created a mosaic of waterfalls, free-form designs and biblical
quotations.</TE>
<TE>   He has erected a cross that can be seen for miles.</TE>
<TE>   Folk art devotees and journalists from around the world have
traveled to this desert hamlet (population 1,143) east of the Salton
Sea to marvel at his work.</TE>
<TE>   The BBC, a Japanese magazine and a German film crew have made the
trek, among others.</TE>
<TE>   A museum in Baltimore took one of his two trucks--complete with
painted tires and decorated in much the same fashion as the
mountain--across the country to put it on display.</TE>
<TE>   A documentary video and several books have featured Knight and his
work. Museums in Palm Springs and Santa Barbara have had photo
exhibitions in his honor.</TE>
<TE>   And one of the nation's leading folk arts scholars now is
petitioning Congress to recognize Salvation Mountain as a national
treasure, one that should be protected even after Knight's demise
(which Knight says will not be any time soon).</TE>
<TE>   "Leonard's mountain is the largest monument ever created to send a
universal message of unconditional love, at no expense to taxpayers
and with great good heart," said Rebecca Alban Hoffberger, director
and founder of the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore. "It
should be honored."</TE>
<TE>   Knight's neighbors have paid tribute in their own way, giving him
a permanent place of honor in the annual Tomato Festival parade in
Niland and the Cattle Call parade in nearby Brawley.</TE>
<TE>   Fans have created a Web site for him. It is a link from a site run
by "snowbirds" who spend the winter rent-free in their recreational
vehicles and tents at an unofficial, unregulated camp called Slab
City.</TE>
<TE>   All of this for a man who once was branded a public nuisance and
threatened with eviction by county officials who wanted his mountain
ripped down as an eyesore and alleged environmental hazard.</TE>
<TE>   The threat of eviction fizzled when neither the state nor the
county had money for the removal project and soil tests failed to
confirm the suspicions that toxic residue from the paint posed a
health hazard.</TE>
<TE>   Knight is taking his celebrity in stride, getting by on Social
Security checks and sleeping in the back of his 1951 truck, even when
the summer heat soars to 120 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   A pet cat is his only companion.</TE>
<TE>   "God has blessed me ever since I've been at Salvation Mountain,"
he said in his thin, reedy voice, still redolent of his native
Vermont.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I think I'm living half in this world, half in heaven
already."</TE>
<TE>   Knight was floating by in his hot air balloon in 1986 when the
balloon--also emblazoned with "God Is Love"--crash-landed, never to
fly again.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, employed in San Diego at the time, decided that the ballon
landing, hard though it was, was a kind of sign from above.</TE>
<TE>   After decades of working as a truck driver, welder, handyman,
guitar teacher, painter and automotive body-and-fender man, he
decided to devote himself full time to his art and become a "desert
hobo bum."</TE>
<TE>   Knight opted to stay put right where the balloon had come down, in
a gravelly, weed-strewn patch of ground on the outskirts of a World
War II desert training base used by Gen. George Patton's tank corps.</TE>
<TE>   The property is controlled by the State Lands Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Salvation Mountain serves as the gateway to Slab City, whose
residents provide Knight with buckets of paint lugged from their
summer homes.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't anybody who doesn't love Leonard," said Slab City
resident Phil Sullivan, a retiree from Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the only truly gentle and kind man I've ever met. He's
eccentric but he's wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Seven years ago, the Imperial County government considered
assuming control of the Slab City site from the state and turning it
into a desert park.</TE>
<TE>   Under that plan, Salvation Mountain was to have been razed and
Knight evicted.</TE>
<TE>   The park plan is being considered anew but, this time, Knight's
fame has made him and his work untouchable.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see us doing anything to Leonard or his mountain," said
Supervisor Gary Wyatt, who is sponsoring the park idea.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become too much of a worldwide phenomenon. Leonard has done
an incredible job of getting his message out."</TE>
<TE>   With his recent acclaim has come a new burst of artistic energy.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks also helped convince Knight that
the world needs his inspirational messages more than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Recently he has branched out, painting an adjacent hill and
fashioning two huts from bales of hay. For subject matter, he still
prefers John 3:16, the Lord's Prayer, American flags, and scenes of
green valleys and flowing streams.</TE>
<TE>   His technique depends on spontaneity. He never makes preliminary
sketches.</TE>
<TE>   "I just make a lot of mistakes and correct them," Knight said.</TE>
<TE>   "I just keep working and praying. It's the best thing I can do."</TE>

empty American Airlines jetliner rolled away from a maintenance
hangar at LAX and smashed through a chain-link fence. The Boeing 767
blocked an employee access road for several hours, but airport
operations were unaffected. The plane, which weighs 175 tons without
fuel or passengers, traveled about 15 feet onto World Way West,
knocking down a telephone pole. Airline officials were investigating
to see if the parking brake had been set.</CP>

<HD>Secessionists Are Next on Mayor's Fight Card</HD>
<DH>City Hall: Breakaway efforts gained ground as Hahn was
diverted by the battle over chief. That victory may cost him allies
in coming fight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD and TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Commission's decision to deny Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks a second term was a win for Mayor James K. Hahn, but
the political cost of that fight could hamper the mayor as he takes
on his next biggest challenge: stopping secession movements in three
parts of the city.</LD>
<LD>   Civic leaders opposed to breaking the city apart said they fear
that the mayor's controversial decision to oppose a second term for
the chief has distracted the administration during the last few
months and given secession advocates a chance to gain momentum, even
as a decision nears to put the matter on the November ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The commission's decision to side with the mayor against Parks
reinforced the anger of African Americans, one of Hahn's most
important constituencies. Some black leaders who were once staunch
Hahn allies now warn that African Americans are so upset at the
ousting of the black police chief that they will not follow the
mayor's lead on secession.</LD>
<TE>   "What he has done is lost the ability to be trusted," said Rep.
Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles). "Now people are going to question him
on that issue. I think he's in a weakened position."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who has vowed to do all in his power to keep the city
together, formed a political committee called L.A. United in November
to fight possible ballot measures and signed up some of the city's
top political operatives to run the anti-secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Hahn called it absolutely imperative that he do
everything he can to prevent the breakup of the city. "There's really
no other individual who can speak for the city of Los Angeles more
than the mayor can," he said then.</TE>
<TE>   But in the last few months, the mayor has spent more time arguing
for a change in leadership at the Police Department than talking
about why secession is a bad idea.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, secessionists have been moving forward, even
touting several proposed names for a new Valley city, while state
Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar) has mused about running to be mayor
of the new municipality.</TE>
<TE>   "What's disappointing about the secession issue is it's been a
one-sided argument for the past several months," said City Councilman
Jack Weiss, whose 5th District includes portions of the San Fernando
Valley, which is home to the strongest secession effort. "There are
forceful arguments to be made that will show people that secession is
not in anyone's best interest. But so far those forceful arguments
are not being made."</TE>
<TE>   Weiss said he believes the mayor has had "too many complicated
balls in the air" to give secession sufficient attention.</TE>
<TE>   Secession Supporters Exploited Opportunity</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, chairman of a group advocating for Valley
secession, agreed the mayor's focus on other matters has given his
group an opportunity to talk to voters about why creating a separate
city is a good idea.</TE>
<TE>   ''We hope the mayor waits until three weeks before the election to
start running his ads,'' Close said. ''By that time we believe we
will have solid numbers.''</TE>
<TE>   Billionaire Eli Broad, who has already donated $100,000 to the
mayor's anti-secession effort, said he thinks voters will be
convinced to keep the city together once a campaign starts up in the
summer. But the lack of public focus on the issue has given
secessionists an opening, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The anti-secession people--the mayor and others--have been
relatively quiet as the secession people are beating the drums, and
as a result of that, some people have the impression that the
anti-secession people aren't doing anything," Broad said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook said that Hahn has been working hard
to fight secessionist sentiments in the Valley, Hollywood and the
harbor area by making city government more responsive and
strengthening the new neighborhood council system.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to make the argument about keeping the city
together, city government needs to have credibility," Middlebrook
said. "Changing how government does business has been a key focus of
the mayor for the last nine months."</TE>
<TE>   Political consultant William Carrick, who is running the L.A.
United campaign, said Hahn is also working behind the scenes to raise
money for the effort, pulling in about $1 million so far.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the mayor has focused on the secession issue pretty
strongly, and he speaks out against it every chance he has," said
Carrick, adding that a more formal campaign will start in the summer.
"There will be a much stronger debate throughout the community as we
get closer to the reality of having it on the ballot."</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, Hahn has publicly tried to soothe the
discontent fueling secession through low-key public events showing
that he is improving city services. Last month, he stood on a busy
street corner in Van Nuys and announced that the city has made
improvements to 25 of Los Angeles' worst intersections. He attended a
Board of Fire Commissioners meeting in San Pedro to demonstrate how
city panels were taking their meetings to neighborhoods. And he
visited a Northridge electrical company to showcase the city's new
e-permit system.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, that's what I do every day, is campaign to keep the city
together by making city government work better," the mayor said last
week in Pacoima.</TE>
<TE>   Panel to Rule on Putting Measures on the Ballot</TE>
<TE>   The Local Agency Formation Commission, which bears the
responsibility for evaluating the feasibility of creating cities,
will decide in May and June whether the three secession efforts
qualify for the November ballot. If approved by LAFCO, each would be
a separate measure on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   If secession goes on the ballot, the mayor will have to deliver a
forceful message to voters about why they should oppose the
measure--a prospect complicated by his recent slump in popularity,
especially in his political base.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's approval ratings among African Americans dropped
significantly after he said he wanted to replace Parks, according to
a recent Times poll. The mayor may not be able to turn to some of his
former black allies to win back African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Basketball star-turned-entrepreneur Earvin "Magic" Johnson has
expressed anger at his decision, and suggested he may want to run
against Hahn in 2005. More than a dozen African American leaders,
many of them clergy at prominent South Los Angeles churches, are
withholding invitations to the mayor to speak at their organizations.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, a black city commissioner resigned her post, saying
she believes Hahn manipulated the chief's reappointment process by
speaking out before the panel made its decision.</TE>
<TE>   Some civic leaders say a broad coalition is needed to fight
secession so the issue does not come down to a measure of Hahn's
popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this should be a referendum on Jimmy Hahn," said
Miguel Contreras, head of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor,
AFL-CIO, an umbrella union organization opposed to secession. "I
think that would be a bad position, because of what's going on in the
city. We shouldn't let the Parks issue color secession."</TE>
<TE>   Carrick said the anti-secession campaign will draw in other
leaders, such as former Mayor Richard Riordan, who has agreed to
participate.</TE>
<TE>   But he disputed the argument that bitterness about the mayor's
stance on the chief will hurt Hahn's ability to rally voters against
secession.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried about it, because I think secession is going to
be judged on the substantive merits," Carrick said. "I don't think
the African American community is going to see secession doing any
good for them."</TE>
<TE>   And Hahn thinks the anger about his decision has been overstated.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a few political leaders who have strong disagreements
with me," he said during a news conference Tuesday. "But everywhere I
go, and talk to regular folks in the community, I still get very
positive reaction."</TE>

<HD>Cop Will Not Face Charges in Death</HD>
<DH>District attorney: LAPD officer who shot an actor at a
Halloween party did so in self-defense, thinking a fake gun was real,
prosecutor says. A civil lawsuit still looms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County district attorney's office will not prosecute
a police officer who fatally shot an actor during a Halloween costume
party 18 months ago, concluding in a report issued Wednesday that the
officer acted in self-defense.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Police Department Officer Tarriel Hopper shot
39-year-old Anthony Dwain Lee after the actor allegedly pointed a
replica handgun at him during a party at a Benedict Canyon mansion
Oct. 27, 2000. Hopper, a three-year officer at the time of the
shooting, fired nine times, hitting Lee once in the back of the head
and three times in the back.</LD>
<LD>   "Given the rapidly evolving manner in which this entire incident
occurred, coupled with the immediate danger that he perceived, we are
convinced that Officer Hopper was justifiably in fear for his life at
the time he shot Anthony Lee," Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Kenneth
Pettersen wrote.</LD>
<TE>   Pettersen said in an interview Wednesday that Hopper reacted the
only way he could because he believed the gun was real. The officer
was forced to make a split-second decision to draw and fire his
weapon, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "To ask him to wait any longer could have put his life and the
life of others in the direct vicinity in peril," Pettersen said.</TE>
<TE>   But Lee's sister, Tina Lee-Vogt, disagreed, saying that the
officer was overly aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if he thought it was a real gun, there are hundreds of cases
of officers who are confronted with people with real guns who don't
kill them," said Lee-Vogt, a civilian administrator with the
Sacramento Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Lee-Vogt said she was not surprised by the district attorney's
decision, but was frustrated that prosecutors seemed to blame her
brother for the shooting by saying his actions were threatening to
the officer. She filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Hopper, his
partner, the LAPD and the city. The civil case is expected to go to
trial this year, Lee-Vogt's attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Hopper declined to talk about the night of the shooting because of
the pending civil suit. He said he was thankful, however, for the
district attorney's decision not to file charges, saying, "That much
is relieving."</TE>
<TE>   According to the district attorney's report, Hopper and his
partner, Natalie Humpherys, responded shortly after midnight to noise
complaints at a house in the 9700 block of Yoakum Drive known as "The
Castle." In an effort to locate the party hosts, the officers walked
through the house and out onto a back walkway.</TE>
<TE>   Once outside, Hopper noticed a man staring through glass doors
into a dimly lit bedroom, so he shined his flashlight toward the
bedroom, and witnessed what he said he believed to be a drug deal.
Lee, who was inside the room, then pulled what appeared to Hopper to
be a semiautomatic handgun and pointed it at the officer, the report
said. Standing about six feet away from Lee, Hopper pulled his
handgun from his holster and fired at Lee. Lee died at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Officers later determined that Lee's gun was a movie prop replica
of a blue steel .357 magnum semiautomatic pistol.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's report said Lee had alcohol and cocaine in
his system, a finding originally made by the medical examiner Oct.
29, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   An LAPD internal review board determined in October 2001 that the
shooting was justified because the officer believed the fake gun was
real. The review board said Hopper should not be disciplined for the
shooting but should undergo additional training. The civilian Los
Angeles Police Commission voted 4 to 1 that same month that the
officer justifiably used deadly force and followed department policy.</TE>
<TE>   Hopper, 28, now works in an administrative position in the
department, but not as a result of disciplinary action, said LAPD
spokesman Sgt. John Pasquariello.</TE>
<TE>   Pasquariello said he was pleased that the district attorney's
office agreed with the department's findings. "The reality is that
Hopper did nothing wrong and we shouldn't vilify him for his
actions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lee-Vogt's attorney, Cameron Stewart, said both the LAPD and the
district attorney's office ignored the fact that the officers put
themselves in jeopardy by entering the house. Stewart added that
Hopper could not have been acting in self-defense, since Lee was shot
in the back.</TE>
<TE>   During the district attorney's investigation, Pettersen reviewed
LAPD investigation reports and photographs, listened to audiotapes of
witnesses and watched a video reenactment of the shooting. He also
consulted with a professor who has studied officer-involved
shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Explaining why Lee was hit in the back, Pettersen wrote that the
actor was probably hit as he was turning to the left and ducking
down.</TE>
<TE>   The key witnesses, Pettersen said, were Hopper and partygoer Eric
Schuberg. Hopper told detectives that he shot because he feared for
his life.</TE>
<TE>   "During this entire time, it happened very, very quickly, his gun
was continually pointing at me," Hopper said.</TE>
<TE>   Schuberg gave detectives a nearly identical account, saying he saw
Lee pull out what appeared to be a gun and point it in the direction
of the glass doors.</TE>
<TE>   Schuberg said he believed the gun was real and that he felt
threatened by it.</TE>
<TE>   Another partygoer, William Frey, told detectives he saw Lee pull
the gun from his waistband and begin to raise it. But he said Lee
never pointed the weapon directly at the officer.</TE>
<TE>   In another controversial police shooting, prosecutors decided in
August not to file charges against the officer who fatally shot a
mentally ill homeless woman.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, the district attorney's office determined that
Officer Edward Larrigan should not be prosecuted for shooting
Margaret Laverne Mitchell in the chest in May 1999 after she
allegedly lunged at him with a 12-inch screwdriver.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Larrigan may have acted in self-defense, but that
there were too many conflicting witness statements for them to make
that concrete determination.</TE>
<TE>   The accounts of Lee's death were much more consistent, Pettersen
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a far different case than the Margaret Mitchell case," he
said. After reviewing the material, Pettersen said, "there was never
a question in my mind ... that this was anything less than
self-defense."</TE>

<LD>Ray Ratto, ridiculing the NFL draft in his column at ESPN.com:
"Nobody knows anything, won't for years, and far more often than not
will end up being wrong ...</LD>
<LD>   "The NFL, more than any other industry, is insulated against its
own silliness. Throw a team logo up on the screen, and jaws go slack,
drool forms at the corner of the mouth, and a hypnotic hum fills the
room.</LD>
<LD>   "People love this stuff, even without the burden of accuracy. [And
you can take it from me, because I'm the guy who said Ronnie Lott
would never make it]."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the only player to complete the career Grand
Slam at the Masters?</TE>
<TE>   Not a clue: "Hockey Night in Canada" commentator Don Cherry
doesn't believe the Ottawa Senators have enough playoff-caliber
players. He believes that team is soft and he blames the Senators'
general manager: "Marshall Johnston, he wouldn't know a hockey player
if he tripped over Bobby Orr."</TE>
<TE>   Give me a Dodger dog: A survey by People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals marks Coors Field in Denver the No. 2 vegetarian-friendly
ballpark in the nation, behind Tropicana Field, home of the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays.</TE>
<TE>   Tropicana Field was cited for its garden burger, French fries,
fruit smoothies, garlic knots, peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches,
black beans and rice, vegetable stir-fry and pasta.</TE>
<TE>   That's fine, but other than pasta and fries, what do you eat if
you're really hungry?</TE>
<TE>   Good old days: Reader Devlin Espeleta to the San Francisco
Chronicle:</TE>
<TE>   "I was watching a baseball movie the other day, and Kevin Costner
and James Earl Jones went to a Red Sox-A's game in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "They bought two dogs and two beers for $8. Talk about 'field of
dreams.'"</TE>
<TE>   A no brainer: A full week before the Detroit Tigers had an 0-6
record and fired manager Phil Garner and general manager Randy Smith,
Bernie Lincicome of the Rocky Mountain News posed this quiz question:</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing to go in baseball is: (a) the legs; (b) the eyes;
(c) the manager."</TE>
<TE>   A trend? The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that the Reds had their
weekly chapel services before Sunday's game in the usual place--the
weight room.</TE>
<TE>   That won't be necessary next season. Great American Ball Park will
be the first major league park with a chapel.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1907, New York Giant catcher Roger
Bresnahan introduced an innovation in a game against Philadelphia:
wooden shin guards to protect his legs and knees.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Gene Sarazen, who won in 1935, defeating Craig Wood
in a playoff.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Jon Stewart, host of the Daily Show on Comedy
Central, had this take on baseball economics:</TE>
<TE>   "The New York Yankees lead all teams with a record payroll of $126
million, with the Boston Red Sox coming in second at $108 million. A
Red Sox official defended his payroll, saying: 'You have to spend
money to come close to winning, then slip back, then appear to win
again, then ultimately choke and dash the hopes of millions of
fans.'"</TE>

<HD>It's a Sure Bet Mickelson Will Scramble His Plans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I played in a golf tournament earlier this week and found myself
teamed with three jokers, who individually, were the worst I've ever
seen. And that includes Dwyre, and all the women I've watched play.</LD>
<LD>   Had I known ahead of time that Rod Pitts, who arranged the
pairings, was a former USC football player, I'd have expected to be
stuck with such hackers.</LD>
<LD>   Anyway, it wasn't a total loss, because the Mickelson Solution
came to me on about the 15th hole as my scramble teammate Eddie
Delahoussaye lined up a putt, and I found myself yelling at the
jockey, "Don't be short."</LD>
<TE>   In fact, wouldn't you think if anybody was going to have a good
short game it would be somebody like Delahoussaye? Well, let me tell
you, he does--off the tee.</TE>
<TE>   His idea of letting the shaft out and really going for it is to
try to clear the ladies' tee. His golfing friends, Ray Kravagna and
Tiny Gelalich, are so bad, they had no such lofty expectations.</TE>
<TE>   I will say this, however, Phil Mickelson has about as much chance
of winning the Masters tournament as Delahoussaye, Kravagna or
Gelalich.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE'S ONLY one way for Mickelson to win a major, and that's if
the gods of golf, who have already tampered with Augusta National,
continue to be sacrilegious and play the Masters as a scramble.</TE>
<TE>   The whole idea of a scramble is for everyone to go for it on every
shot, which would make Mickelson a prohibitive favorite. The only way
you can gag in a scramble is to be the team's anchor, and leave a
putt short like Delahoussaye, the choker.</TE>
<TE>   Golf has so many dull, conservative players. You put two or three
of them with Go-For-It-All Phil, and there's no way anyone could
assemble a scramble team to beat them. In fact the only thing
separating Mickelson from greatness and a half dozen major wins, is
Mickelson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   YOU CAN make the argument Mickelson is the most compelling player
in golf now, and much like the Indianapolis 500 everyone is waiting
for the crash.</TE>
<TE>   The reason for this, of course, is that Mickelson has a gambling
problem.</TE>
<TE>   You go to Las Vegas and take a $20,000 flyer on the Ravens at 28-1
to win the Super Bowl before the season and collect $560,000, as
ESPN's Bob Ryan reported previously about Mickelson, and I guess
that's not that outlandish for someone making the money he does. And
with that kind of luck, it's understandable why he'd put another
$20,000 down on Arizona to win the World Series at 38-1--winning
$760,000.</TE>
<TE>   There's no indication how many wagers he's lost, but here's the
real gambling problem for a professional golfer: When you're packing
that kind of roulette attitude, you also better be carrying some
extra golf balls with you. Let's face it, Mickelson's ball is the one
most likely to go in the drink because he's the one most likely to
try to hit it across the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson is No. 1 in recording birdies on the PGA Tour, making
him the perfect scramble player. He also has something like 16 bogeys
on par fivesdemonstrating he plays every tournament like it's a
scramble and pays for his aggressiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Remember when the PGA frowned on him for betting with golfer Mike
Weir during a Jim Furyk-Tiger Woods playoff at the NEC Invitational
last August?</TE>
<TE>   That wager tells you all you need to know about Mickelson and his
all-or-nothing attitude--wagering $500 that Furyk would hole a bunker
shot.</TE>
<TE>   He won that bet like his shot-in-the-dark football and baseball
wagers. Maybe that's the Mickelson Solution, making himself into such
a longshot now that he might want to bet on himself.</TE>
<TE>   Makes you wonder if he'd play it safer with his own money on the
line.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   RADINE RAMSEY grew up loving sports, she said, because her father,
Ray Quincy Hayes, took her to Rams' games, and later split season
tickets to watch the Kings. I was concerned about this, because I'm
not sure a father should be commended for making a hockey fan out of
his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   But Ramsey tells me Hayes was something special, and it would mean
a lot to her, and Hayes' many friends and family, if I mentioned his
name and gave him his due as a father, husband and long-time Los
Angeles sports fan.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes died on March 25. There will be a memorial service for him
on Sunday at the Learning Light Center in Anaheim. Other than myself,
I don't think anyone will object if you show up wearing a hockey
sweater.</TE>

<HD>County Shelves Plan for Early Learning Center at the Mall</HD>
<DH>Education: Despite getting donated space at Del Amo and
$440,000 in federal aid, officials decide to move program to existing
facilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was designed to grab attention: a new kind of school for the
youngest of children in the biggest of malls.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County education officials hinted at an opening this
spring. News releases were drafted. Designs for the school were
drawn. In its official materials, the U.S. Department of Education
featured the project as a prototype for teaching early literacy to
children younger than 5. The Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance
agreed to donate 5,500 square feet of prime retail space. Congress
earmarked $440,000 to launch it.</LD>
<LD>   Despite all this, the Early Advantage Center hasn't opened.
Staffers at the Los Angeles County Office of Education, which was to
run the mall-based center, say it probably will never open. After
five years of planning, the county quietly abandoned the center
earlier this year, with little notice to the idea's backers.</LD>
<TE>   As word has leaked out, the reversal has puzzled those supporters.
Adding to the confusion is the wide variety of explanations given by
the county's education leaders for dropping the idea. Its acting
superintendent said the county Office of Education--a little-known
but powerful bureaucracy with a $700-million budget--now prefers to
offer the services at existing nutrition centers for a wider
geographic spread. Other officials worried that the mall-based school
might not survive financially beyond one year.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the center's backers allege that the cautious education
bureaucracy was scared off by the possibility of political battles
set off by jealousy from other parts of the county.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing has sort of fizzled," said Rose Kauffman, a
former county assistant superintendent who originated the concept.
"No one can give you a good reason why it won't happen."</TE>
<TE>   Kauffman, an educator for 30 years, said the idea of a
school-in-a-mall first occurred to her in a dream five years ago.
Long a close reader of scientific studies on brain development in
young children, Kauffman had been thinking about ways to communicate
that research to parents. After conversations with educators and
scientists around the state, she worked with the Bakersfield City
School District in putting together a literacy center for young
children at a mall there three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   For Los Angeles, Kauffman envisioned an even grander learning
center. With the backing of then-county Office of Education Supt.
Donald Ingwerson, she proposed a facility that, like the mall, would
be open evenings and weekends. It would have no steady enrollment,
but instead would allow parents to walk in with children at any time.
Instead of permanent classes, it would offer a variety of learning
stations, with activities repeated throughout the day. Parents and
child-care providers also could sign up for special classes in how to
stimulate the brains of the very young.</TE>
<TE>   "The concept had a lot of support," said Madeline Hall, the county
grants development coordinator, who sought funding. "In terms of the
county office trying to help the most districts and kids, we can do
this by focusing on school readiness. And a mall is a place where
people from a variety of different places assemble."</TE>
<TE>   The county's Early Advantage program formed partnerships with
local hospitals to offer classes at the center and develop pamphlets
and videos with tips on boosting young children's capacity to learn.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very, very challenging concept but also a good one,"
said Dr. Lloyd Brown, associate director of the pediatric residency
training program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, one of Early
Advantage's partners.</TE>
<TE>   County officials also began to look for a mall that would host the
center. By last year, Torrance Co., owner of Del Amo Fashion Center,
had agreed in writing to donate retail space worth $1.2 million a
year next to Macy's department store, county officials say. The
county facilities staff performed a study. Architects made drawings
of a facility. It was to be decorated in "Sesame Street" style--with
colorful floor stencils of numbers and letters.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, four California members of Congress--Reps. Jane
Harman (D-Venice), Howard P. "Buck" McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), David
Dreier (R-San Dimas) and Gary G. Miller (R-Diamond Bar)--began
aggressively lobbying congressional appropriators to specifically
fund a learning center in the mall.</TE>
<TE>   With the commitment from the mall in place, the county launched an
aggressive public relations effort to promote the new learning
center. Sophia Waugh, president of the county Office of Education
board, talked up the idea to reporters. The concept received a
mention at a White House meeting on child development last year. A
team from the U.S. Department of Education was invited to inspect the
program; a subsequent article in a fall issue of the department's
Community Update referred to the new center as a fait accompli.</TE>
<TE>   In that article, the county described the Del Amo site as "a
prototype for major malls throughout Los Angeles County."</TE>
<TE>   "What this office--its board and superintendent--realized," acting
county Supt. Marilyn Gogolin, who replaced Ingwerson last summer,
told the publication, "is that if we really want to change student
achievement, if we really want to stop playing catch-up or stop
trying to change the life of a child after the child's already in
school, we have to do something different."</TE>
<TE>   In December, the county learned that congressional appropriators
had come up with $440,000 for the Early Advantage Center--enough to
open it. Harman heralded the new facility in a news release
announcing the funding.</TE>
<TE>   But almost immediately after the funds came through, Gogolin and
other county officials began to reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   County officials say that during two planning meetings in January,
Gogolin and senior staffers decided to back away from the idea of a
mall-based center. Instead, they chose to put the federal money into
an outreach program at Women, Infants and Children (WIC) nutrition
centers around the county. Two weeks ago, the county submitted an
application to the federal government asking to use the money in five
WIC centers. That application makes no mention of the mall idea and
gives no explanation of why it was abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Backers Shifted Positions Abruptly</TE>
<TE>   That abrupt shift came without public notice from the same county
officials who had been touting the mall project all last year. In
mid-March, a county spokesman told The Times that it was still being
planned.</TE>
<TE>   Late last month, members of the county Board of Education were
still talking up the new center. "It's still very viable," Angie
Papadakis said. "The board is still gung-ho."</TE>
<TE>   Mall officials received no clear message of the change of heart
until March. "We thought it was a wonderful idea," said Brandace
Bruning, vice president for the mall's owner. "But now we understand
that the program has changed and is no longer appropriate for a major
shopping venue."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, county records show--and county officials concede
privately--that the mall center is dead. In the last few weeks, they
have offered a variety of reasons, some contradictory. At first,
county Director of Communications Frank Kwan said the mall concept
had never been the focus of the county's efforts; the federal money
could be put to better use by spreading out services among five
locations across the county. "We wanted to reach families,
particularly low-income families, where we could," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a subsequent interview, Gogolin and other county officials said
a lack of funding was at the center of their decision. The federal
funds, while generous, weren't enough to sustain the mall center,
they said. The nutrition sites are federally funded and managed by
local agencies and nonprofits. Instead of the county providing its
own staff at a mall, the WIC staff could be given additional training
in teaching literacy.</TE>
<TE>   As such, Gogolin argues, the WICs are more stable locations than
donated retail space.</TE>
<TE>   "The credibility issue would be if we opened a mall center and 12
months from now we closed it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the mall center say that explanation represents, at
best, excessive caution. Early Advantage, they argue, had unusual
strengths for a start-up--congressional backing, free and
high-profile space--which would have made it attractive to
foundations and corporate donors.</TE>
<TE>   County officials had talked to Toyota with an idea of making it
the center's title sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   "But they won't fund the opening or the build-out; corporations
and foundations prefer to fund existing programs," said Kauffman, the
plan's originator. "You need to get the doors open first before
Toyota comes in.... I think politics played a part."</TE>
<TE>   Change in Leadership Cited as One Reason</TE>
<TE>   Kauffman points to the departure of the longtime superintendent,
Ingwerson, as one possible reason for the change. Kauffman and county
Board of Education member Rudell Freer say county officials feared
opening a high-profile school in just one place instead of the
multiple locations that might please more Congress members or county
supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Gogolin is a finalist in the Board of Supervisors' search for a
permanent superintendent. She dismisses speculation that she killed
the idea for any political motive. "I don't need this job," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ingwerson, who left office in August, said his concerns about the
center's viability would have eased with the award in December of the
congressional money, but he added: "If the WIC concept serves kids
better, more power to them."</TE>
<TE>   Kauffman, meanwhile, hopes the mall concept can be revived.</TE>
<TE>   "The multiple centers are simply not as easy or as visible as a
mall," she said. "A mall is a destination for people. The mall idea
still deserves a chance."</TE>

<HD>Cubs' Farnsworth Breaks Right Foot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As if the Chicago Cubs needed more trouble, reliever Kyle Farnsworth
broke a bone in his right foot Wednesday and probably will be
sidelined from four to six weeks.</LD>
<LD>   He'll be put on the 15-day disabled list today. The Cubs didn't
announce who will take his spot, but it probably will be either Scott
Chiasson or Carlos Zambrano, among the last relievers cut in spring
training.</LD>
<LD>   Farnsworth, the right-handed setup man, was warming up in the
bullpen in the seventh inning when he felt something "pop" in his
foot. X-rays showed a stress fracture in his right foot.</LD>
<TE>   "I was just warming up, and I felt a pop. Just a freak thing,"
said Farnsworth, who left Wrigley Field on crutches and with his foot
wrapped in gauze and in a walking boot.</TE>
<TE>   His injury could be a costly one for the Cubs. The hard-throwing
reliever had a 2.74 earned-run average last season, and has a 0.00
ERA with two strikeouts in 11/3 innings this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Our biggest fear was health, and that's what we got," said Jim
Hendry, the Cubs vice president of player personnel. "He's an
integral part of our pitching staff and we're certainly going to miss
him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Felipe Alou plans to decide today if he will accept the Detroit
Tigers' three-year offer to join the organization.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm either going to my home in the Dominican Republic or I'm
going to Minneapolis with the Tigers," he said Wednesday from his
home in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers want the 66-year-old former Montreal manager to spend
at least one year as Luis Pujols' bench coach, with an option to be a
special assistant for two years.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger president Dave Dombrowski was an Expo executive while Alou
was with Montreal. Pujols was on Alou's staff from 1993-2000.</TE>
<TE>   Dombrowski hired Pujols as manager for the rest of the season and
fired two coaches Tuesday, one day after dismissing Manager Phil
Garner and General Manager Randy Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "David Dombrowski will be successful, with our without me, I'm
confident of that," Alou said. "He's done it in two places [Montreal
and Florida] and he'll do it in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   "And I will always be there for Luis, whether I'm his bench coach
or not."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ken Griffey Jr.'s injured right knee is healing quickly and he
could return to the field in three to six weeks, the Cincinnati Red
team doctor said after a re-examination.</TE>
<TE>   There has been "vast improvement" in the knee since the All-Star
center fielder partially tore the patella tendon and partially
dislocated his kneecap during a rundown in Sunday's game against
Montreal, Dr. Timothy Kremchek said.</TE>
<TE>   "Junior has a full range of motion," Kremchek said. "I am
convinced he is right on target to return in three to six weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Griffey, who began twice-daily physical therapy sessions on
Monday, was put on the 15-day disabled list and stayed behind in
Cincinnati as the Reds began a road trip in Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The New York Mets purchased the contract of outfielder Tony
Tarasco from triple-A Norfolk, and sent outfielder McKay Christensen
outright to the minor league team.</TE>
<TE>   Tarasco was hitting .250 with four runs batted in in six games at
Norfolk this year. He was with the Mets in spring training, hitting
.237 with a homer and six RBIs in 24 games.</TE>
<TE>   Christensen, claimed on waivers April 3 from the Dodgers, hit .333
in four games with the Mets.</TE>

<HD>Chew on This: More Gumgate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Luis Gonzalez apparently won't have to give DNA samples after all. No
more gumshoe detective work will be necessary.</LD>
<LD>   The Arizona Diamondback All-Star reportedly has decided to end any
controversy over the legitimacy of a piece of
already-been-chewed-by-Gonzo gum being sold at auction on the
Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzalez said he would chew a new piece of gum while on a Tucson
radio program via telephone this morning, according to Johnjay of the
"Johnjay and Rich" show on station KRQ.</LD>
<TE>   Gonzalez will then place the new gum in an envelope and ship it
either to the collector of the original gum, Jason Gabbert, or to the
high school that is to get the proceeds from the Internet bidding,
Johnjay said.</TE>
<TE>   The highest bid so far is $3,275 by Dave Pierce, a student at
Indiana University of Pennsylvania. That edged out the $3,200 bid by
The Topps Co., which manufactured the gum Gonzalez allegedly chewed.</TE>
<TE>   A public chew by Gonzalez on the radio show where he often has
appeared would bring an end to a bizarre tale that features
characters right out of a Bazooka bubble gum comic. They include
Johnjay the DJ, Ponytail John the security guard, Tom Vigilante, the
security company owner, and, of course, Gonzo.</TE>
<TE>   The gum's authenticity was called into question when Vigilante,
who owns Vigilante Security Services of Phoenix, said he had an
affidavit signed by Ponytail John denying that he had given Gabbert
the gum at a spring training game in Tucson on March 7.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Ponytail John, whose last name Vigilante declined to
give, said he saw Gabbert pick up another piece of gum and say "this
will do."</TE>
<TE>   Gabbert, who owns a memorabilia store, in Wood Lake, Minn., said
the security guard is lying. Gabbert said he believes the security
company is just worried about losing its contract at Tucson Electric
Park, spring training home of the Diamondbacks and Chicago White Sox.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Eduardo Perez's home run cut came earlier in the at-bat. When he
connected for the game-winning shot in the 11th inning of the St.
Louis Cardinals' 6-5 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers, he was
choking up on the bat.</LD>
<LD>   Perez hit a 2-2 pitch from Luis Vizcaino (1-0) over the wall in
left-center field with one out in the 11th to give the Cardinals
their second consecutive victory by the same score in the three-game
series. St. Louis rallied from a five-run deficit.</LD>
<LD>   "On the 2-0 pitch I tried to at least get a ball that I could
drive and it fooled me," Perez said. "The 2-2 pitch I choked up and
was just trying to put it in play. It gives you a better opportunity
to put more of the meat of the bat on the ball."</LD>
<TE>   Edgar Renteria tied it in the ninth with a two-out, RBI single off
Mike DeJean. Renteria's third hit completed a Cardinal comeback from
a 5-0 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 2, Arizona 1--Deivi Cruz homered off Rick Helling
leading off the sixth inning at San Diego as the Padres completed a
three-game sweep, their first of Arizona since April 1998.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego has won four in a row against the defending World Series
champions, who are 0-5 in games started by anyone other than Randy
Johnson or Curt Schilling.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 9, Florida 7--Michael Barrett drove in a career-high six
runs, giving him 13 RBIs in five games against Florida this season,
as the Expos won at Miami in front of 5,422, the smallest home crowd
in Marlin history.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Penny (1-1), who entered 6-0 with an 0.82 ERA in six starts
against Montreal, gave up seven runs, seven hits and five walks in
42/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   New York 3, Chicago 2--Roberto Alomar homered for the first time
since being traded to the Mets and Mike Piazza followed with a home
run of his own in the eighth inning for the victory at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Wood struck out 10 and gave up only four hits over seven
innings, leaving with a 2-1 lead and a blister on his middle finger.
Jeff Fassero (0-2) gave up the home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 4, Houston 1--Todd Zeile homered for the third

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Pat Burrell pumped his fist, pointed into the dugout and watched the
ball soar into the left-field seats.</LD>
<LD>   Burrell's two-run homer in the 11th inning lifted the Philadelphia
Phillies to a 7-5 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Even though it was Burrell's second walkoff homer in four
games--his solo shot in the 11th beat the Florida Marlins, 3-2,
Sunday--he still didn't know how to react.</LD>
<TE>   Was he pointing at someone specific in Philadelphia's dugout?</TE>
<TE>   "No, I don't know what I was doing," Burrell said. "I was just
excited."</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies, who finished two games behind Atlanta in the NL East
last season, won their second in a row for the first time this year.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Rolen's two-out homer in the ninth off John Smoltz sent the
game into extra innings.</TE>
<TE>   Smoltz, who hadn't given up a run in two appearances after giving
up eight runs in the ninth inning of an 11-2 loss to the Mets last
Saturday, retired the first two batters.</TE>
<TE>   But Rolen, who had popped out with one out and the tying run on
third against Smoltz in Monday night's 2-1 loss, hit the first pitch
deep into the left-center field seats.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to bury it outside, but I threw it right down the
middle," Smoltz said.</TE>

<LD>The class assignment was to cook French toast--an easy enough task
until you consider the chefs.</LD>
<LD>   One is a 10-year-old boy who's more interested in becoming the
next Kobe Bryant than Emeril Lagasse. The other is a blind,
developmentally disabled 19-year-old who's afraid to touch the
ingredients and howls when confronted with them.</LD>
<LD>   The two were paired last week for a session of a partnership that
brings students from the 54th Street Elementary School across the
street to work and play with youngsters at the Foundation for the
Junior Blind.</LD>
<TE>   What began as a limited exercise in exposure nine years ago has
become a favorite time for both the foundation youths and the 54th
Street school third- through fifth-graders, who mix four times a week
for several hours. The Social Integration Program, however, is not
always easy.</TE>
<TE>   "Aarrgh!" screamed Kevin Malloy, one of the would-be French toast
cooks. Every time his fingers touched a piece of the white bread that
Marc Copeland tried to hand him that morning, Kevin would turn his
head and cry out, "Aarrgh!"</TE>
<TE>   Holding the triangular slice of bread, Copeland, a fourth-grader
at 54th Street school, sat beside Kevin looking puzzled about how to
make him stop yelling. And about how they'd ever turn that bread into
French toast.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin is developmentally delayed and has cortical blindness--a
condition that prevents the visual systems of the brain from
consistently interpreting what the eyes see.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes they react that way because it's scary to touch things
they can't see," said Gaby Hernandez-Gonzalez, one of Kevin's
instructors at the Foundation for the Junior Blind. Gently, she took
Kevin's hand, picked up an egg and explained its qualities--cold,
round, hard--to him before rubbing it against his outstretched
fingers. Kevin still screamed.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin is part of the foundation's special education school, an
individualized learning program for 3- to 21-year-olds who are
visually impaired and developmentally disabled. The students, many of
whom can't speak, learn skills that allow them to function more
independently in society, such as communication techniques and how to
bathe, dress and feed themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Vrbka, director of the foundation's special education
services, who started the integration program in 1993, said, "It's an
opportunity for our children to interact with non-disabled kids, to
be around kids who they can model their behavior after. They're not
going to get that anyplace else."</TE>
<TE>   The first time Sydnee Childress, 10, went to the foundation, she
wasn't sure she'd be able to play much with the students there
because of their disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Then when we got here, I had more fun than I thought I was going
to have," Sydnee said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of her classmates won't make the trip across the street
because of their fears, but those who participate tell their
classmates later that they had a "good time."</TE>
<TE>   Youths from the foundation also visit 54th Street school during
recess once a week. Last week, an integrated group of students stood
in a circle on the concrete playground and sang "If You're Happy and
You Know It." As recess went on, the circle swelled with little boys
and girls who joined in.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation added View Park Preparatory Accelerated Charter
School to the integration program last year. Fifth-graders from the
charter school also work with the foundation's students a couple of
hours a week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been so rewarding for our kids to work with the kids from
the Foundation for the Junior Blind," said Michael Piscal, an
administrator at View Park Preparatory. "The kids that they see, some
of them have problems getting around. To be working with a kid like
that who has an upbeat outlook to life has just given our kids a
whole new outlook to life."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the children in the special education school live on the
foundation's eight-acre campus in the Windsor Hills area of Los
Angeles as part of a residential program. The Foundation for the
Junior Blind, founded in 1953 to provide recreational services for
blind children, includes two residential halls, a cafeteria, a pool,
basketball courts, an outdoor playground and an education center.</TE>
<TE>   Although working with children who are blind and disabled can be
daunting even for adults, Vrbka said the elementary school youngsters
deal with them well. "They really look past their disabilities and
see the kids for who they are," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To start the integration program last week, Hernandez-Gonzalez
formed a circle with her students and those from 54th Street school
and sang their favorite songs.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin, who likes "Three Blind Mice," continually called out his
own name. Mikey Hill-Thompson, 15, who swung his head along with
"Wheels on the Bus," opened his mouth wide and repeated the teacher's
acknowledgment, "Good job," over and over. Nikolai Smith, 19,
stomped, laughed and bit his shirt as the class sang "John Jacob
Jingleheimer Schmidt."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't mind all the noise," Hernandez-Gonzalez said to the 54th
Street students. "Sometimes that's the way the kids communicate."</TE>
<TE>   At first, the fourth-graders just sat in their chairs, some with
faces upturned, not singing along. But by the end of the day, they
had cooked with the foundation children, played with them in a ball
bin and on an air mat and served them lunch. When it came time to go
back to their own school, they could hardly tear themselves away.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Stanford, 9, said he felt good spending time at the
foundation because he realized that "there's other people that need
more help than you."</TE>
<TE>   Katheryn Cardwell, 9, said her visits to the foundation taught her
how blind people discern things and how disabled people communicate.
"We get to learn about other kids that are not like us because
they're special," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Keenan Johnson, 9, said about the blind students, "There's really
nothing wrong with them. They just need some more special attention."</TE>

<HD>District Halts Contract Vote After Audit</HD>
<DH>L.A. Unified: The study found improper review of property
management firm and alleges conflict of interest on part of a lawyer
involved in deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Internal investigators have determined that officials of the Los
Angeles Unified School District sought to award a $5.1-million
property management contract to a firm without properly reviewing
costs and the company's qualifications.</LD>
<LD>   A confidential report by the district's inspector general also
alleges that an outside lawyer who oversaw the selection process for
the contract had an undisclosed conflict of interest. His law firm
also represents Trammell Crow Co., the firm recommended by a
selection panel to find rental office space and maintain properties
where the district wants to build new schools. The attorney says he
previously disclosed the conflict and that it did not influence the
selection process.</LD>
<LD>   The allegations were considered serious enough that a vote on
awarding the contract was postponed indefinitely at Tuesday's Board
of Education meeting. However, Trammell already has been performing
the work on a temporary basis.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the district began a major endeavor to acquire
properties for 158 new schools. Houses and apartment units are on
some of those sites, and the district wanted a company to maintain
them until occupants are relocated and those structures are
demolished.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the district's real estate branch and the office of
the general counsel acknowledged some irregularities in the selection
for that contract, but said those were not serious. That the district
stopped a flawed contract-awarding process proves that its internal
oversight works, according to real estate branch director Scot
Graham.</TE>
<TE>   The inspector general "made these recommendations before a
contract was signed," said Graham. "It means we can do something
about it."</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Trammel was chosen as the favorite bidder to
represent the district as it sought to lease administrative office
space. Later, that proposed contract was expanded to include managing
the school site properties.</TE>
<TE>   Graham said the subsequent internal audit prevented his office
from taking Trammell's proposal before the Board of Education for
approval, but that the district employed the company anyway on a
temporary basis. Graham said that such measures are certainly unwise
but are common and necessary to get things done in the bureaucratic
district.</TE>
<TE>   "Hundreds of vendors work without contracts," he said, noting that
one public relations firm was employed by another department for
seven months before a contract was approved by the board.</TE>
<TE>   District general counsel Hal Kwalwasser acknowledged that Trammell
has been employed to seek office leases for the district since
August, but said that he will not stop that. Kwalwasser said that he
has the authority to bypass the formal bidding process when the
district knows the market, when "time is of the essence" and when the
contractor in question has a proven track record.</TE>
<TE>   Graham and Kwalwasser agree that the district crossed the line
when the scope of Trammell's work was expanded to include property
management without putting the extra work out to bid. Kwalwasser said
he may allow Trammell to manage the district's newly acquired
properties until June 1, when a separate contract would have to be
drawn up.</TE>

<HD>Proposed Soda Tax Advances in Senate</HD>
<DH>Bill: Proceeds would be used for programs to fight
childhood obesity and to wean schools from vending machine revenue
now used to fund student activities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A bill to tax soda to fight childhood obesity cleared a Senate
committee Wednesday after a debate over whether soft drink sales
should be banned from California campuses.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Deborah Ortiz (D-Sacramento) wants to tax sodas and other
sweetened drinks, including certain iced tea and cranberry juice
beverages, at a rate of about 2 cents per 12-ounce serving and use
the revenue to combat rising cases of obesity, diabetes and
osteoporosis among children.</LD>
<LD>   Diet sodas and beverages that contain more than 50% natural fruit
juice would be exempted.</LD>
<TE>   The excise tax, which would be imposed on beverage distributors
but would probably be passed on to consumers, would raise about $340
million a year, according to projections. Some of the revenue would
be devoted to programs aimed at preventing childhood obesity,
educating kids about their teeth and paying dental bills. But most of
the money would be used to help get schools out of the business of
selling soda and junk food, which they now depend on to fund
activities.</TE>
<TE>   "One-third of California children are overweight or obese," Ortiz
told members of the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services,
which she chairs. "Young people today are consuming more soda than
water or milk."</TE>
<TE>   The committee approved Ortiz's "California Soda Tax Act" 7 to 3 on
a party-line vote, with Democrats prevailing over Republicans despite
two abstentions by Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen health-care advocates, county officials and
school administrators testified in support of the measure, including
Los Angeles Board of Education President Caprice Young. She said the
soda tax would allow districts like hers to end what she described as
the "soda sports gotcha."</TE>
<TE>   Young said schools receive about $1,000 a year from each soda
machine on campus to pay for clubs and programs that keep kids
active.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough choice," Young said. "Obviously, nobody likes to
raise taxes, but this is going to be a win for our kids and win for
all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Young's contention, however, drew a sharp response from Sen. Jim
Battin (R-La Quinta), who repeatedly asked Young why the Los Angeles
school system has not then removed soda machines from campuses. He
also took issue with the state making money through a tax hike on a
product portrayed as unhealthy for children.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's immoral for the government to profit from harming
someone," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Members of California's business, restaurant and soda industries
testified Wednesday that the bill would result in a triple tax on
soda, because the state already levies a sales tax and a redemption
fee on them.</TE>
<TE>   Jot Condie, a lobbyist for the California Restaurant Assn., said
the tax could hurt the state's restaurant business by forcing owners
to raise prices or absorb the higher cost charged by beverage
distributors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a serious, scary decision a restaurateur faces," he said.</TE>

<HD>Jury Convicts Man in 1988 Killing of His Estranged Wife</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Redondo Beach engineer was convicted Wednesday in Torrance
Superior Court of murdering his wife more than 13 years ago in the
midst of a bitter divorce dispute.</LD>
<LD>   William Terry Bradford, 69, a retired TRW employee, was found
guilty of the shooting death of Barbara Joan Bradford, 52, on Sept.
16, 1988. The verdict came after a six-week trial and two days of
jury deliberations.</LD>
<LD>   He faces a term of 27 years to life. Sentencing is scheduled for
May 29 before Judge James Ideman. Bradford's attorney, Mark Overland,
could not be reached for comment Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   After court, Shaun Rickerl, 35, Bradford's daughter, told
reporters that until Torrance police and Los Angeles County
prosecutors reopened the case in late 2000, she had practically given
up hope that the murder would be solved.</TE>
<TE>   About four years ago, Rickerl, one of four Bradford children, said
she had concluded that "our father was going to get away with
murder."</TE>
<TE>   Rickerl and her then 16-year-old brother found her mother's
bullet-riddled body in their home less than 30 minutes after she was
shot, said Deputy Dist. Atty. John Lewin, a prosecutor who
specializes in cold cases. Rickerl said the case has been especially
painful.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the defendant happens to be your father, it's hard to go
from suspecting your father committed murder to hearing a jury say he
is guilty of this crime," Rickerl said.</TE>
<TE>   Lewin said in an interview that he decided to reopen the
investigation after reviewing about 30 old homicide files at the
Torrance Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Bradford was living in La Quinta near Palm Springs when the
district attorney's office filed the case in May.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the killing, Bradford and his wife of 23 years were
in the middle of a dispute over a divorce settlement, Lewin said.
They had been separated for about five years, and Bradford had fallen
behind in alimony and child support payments, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lewin said Bradford shot his wife because she had garnisheed
$40,000 from his share of the proceeds from the impending sale of
their home.</TE>
<TE>   He learned about the garnishment the day before she was killed, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lewin said Bradford shot her twice in the back, once in the neck
and two more times after she fell to the floor in her home in an
upscale south Torrance neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   He said Bradford admitted owning a .357 magnum handgun loaded with
the same kind of hollow-point, silver-tipped bullets that were found
in his wife's body.</TE>
<TE>   One week after her death, Bradford turned himself in but denied
any guilt. Bradford told detectives he "felt betrayed and deceived"
by his wife, the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   Four days after he was arrested in 1988, prosecutors declined to
file charges, saying the evidence against him was insufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Lewin said the evidence he presented was no different from what
was available in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "It was prosecutable 14 years ago," he said. "People just have
differences of opinion," he added, referring to prosecutors.</TE>

<HD>Term Limits Can't Stop Mayor</HD>
<DH>Long Beach: Write-in candidate Beverly O'Neill receives the
most votes, putting her in a runoff with Dan Baker, but still not on
ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Cinderella write-in campaign by termed-out Long Beach Mayor
Beverly O'Neill proved formidable by Wednesday, forcing a runoff
election June 4 with Vice Mayor Dan Baker.</LD>
<LD>   Final results from Tuesday's city election showed 27.5% of the
vote went to O'Neill, 24% to Baker, and 22% to Norm Ryan, author of a
proposition that cut utility taxes.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan's close finish to Baker was almost as surprising as O'Neill's
upset victory. A runoff election is required if none of the
candidates wins 50% of the vote.</LD>
<TE>   O'Neill's name did not appear on the election ballot because a
voter-approved 1994 term limits law created a two-term cap for all
Long Beach elected officials. For the same reason, her name will not
appear on the June ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The law allowed for an incumbent to run as a write-in candidate.
But because write-in victories are rare, the flock of veteran
consultants working on other campaign bids viewed O'Neill's as a long
shot.</TE>
<TE>   Write-In Outdoes Top Fund-Raiser</TE>
<TE>   "Can you believe it? It's exciting," O'Neill said Wednesday as a
television crew waited to interview her. "I'm thrilled with the
results because it ... shows that, if people want someone enough,
they will take the extra steps to vote."</TE>
<TE>   From the start, Baker was the top fund-raiser and the favorite of
handicappers. He won the endorsement of the police union and city
employees.</TE>
<TE>   He was also backed by the Gay &amp; Lesbian Victory Fund, a
Washington-based political action group that finances and supports
gay candidates for public office.</TE>
<TE>   If Baker wins in June, Long Beach will become the nation's largest
city with an openly gay mayor, said Jason Young, spokesman for the
Victory Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Although his being openly gay was not an issue in the race, the
Victory Fund contacted major media to highlight what it views as
important progress.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach's estimated population of 461,500 dwarfs by seven times
that of Portland, Maine, which currently is the largest city in the
country with an openly gay mayor, Young said.</TE>
<TE>   Baker, a Long Beach City Council member since 1999 and a U.S.
Customs officer before that, was undaunted Wednesday by O'Neill's
margin of victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, she got a lot of votes," Baker said, referring to her
27.5% share of the vote. "But the good news, from our perspective, is
that 73% of our voters said it's time for a new mayor. So I need to
reach out to that 73% to let them know what I'm about."</TE>
<TE>   Candidates Divided on Federal Breakwater</TE>
<TE>   Supporting a study of the pros and cons of lowering the breakwater
off the Long Beach coast, and a vow to address serious environmental
issues spawned by the Port of Long Beach, will distinguish him in the
June race, Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about port issues and the breakwater, O'Neill said she
believes no one issue defines a race and that citizens vote for, not
against, candidates. She opposes study of the federally owned
breakwater, citing a position by the Army Corps of Engineers that
essentially said, if it's not broke, don't fix it.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill said her campaign will continue to spread the word on how
to write in a vote. A popular mayor, she was endorsed by the
influential Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce and by the Press
Telegram.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor has a salary of $98,900, but no vote apart from veto
power. Yet the mayor makes commission appointments, and in Long Beach
the most powerful is the Harbor Commission, which governs the port on
a $1-billion annual budget with no city oversight and no term limits.</TE>
<TE>   Baker said he would focus on solving the problem of air pollution
from coke dust generated by the port, which has resisted measures to
contain the dust, citing the cost. Air-quality officials have ordered
the port to clean up coal facilities in the harbor, noting that coke
dust contains carcinogens.</TE>
<TE>   In other notable Los Angeles County municipal races, growth and
utility taxes were issues in several campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   In Lancaster, a meager 14% voter turnout gave Mayor Frank Roberts
and Councilman Henry W. Hearns their fifth terms. Ed Sileo, a
planning commissioner, won a council seat vacated after Councilwoman
Michelle Idelman chose not to seek reelection.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Clarita, two incumbents and a newcomer won council seats.</TE>
<TE>   The top vote-getter, Frank Ferry, a high school teacher and
incumbent councilman who coined his own nickname--Road Warrior--ran
on a record of building city roads. Ferry, incumbent Lauren Weste and
Marsha McLean are all known for their ties to local community
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   In El Segundo, the proposed expansion of Los Angeles International
Airport was a major issue in the election for two council seats.
Incumbents Kelly McDowell and John Gaines, who oppose expanding the
airport, won decided victories over William V. Wegner and Spencer
Shakstad, who had expressed a willingness to negotiate with expansion
planners.</TE>

<HD>Judge Orders Fraternity to Rein In Its Loud Parties</HD>
<DH>Courts: Injunction is aimed at Cal State Long Beach
chapter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long Beach's chief prosecutor has obtained an injunction against a
Cal State Long Beach fraternity chapter to prevent its members from
"engaging in activities which have terrorized a neighborhood and
taxed police resources."</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutor Bob Shannon said the action stems from a lawsuit filed
in December against the Sigma Pi chapter because of its long history
of "loud and obnoxious parties" involving hundreds of revelers at its
Belmont Heights house on East 4th Street.</LD>
<LD>   "These parties," he said, "last into the early morning hours, have
music played at excessively high levels, and result in the littering
of the surrounding neighborhood with beer cans, vodka bottles, cups,
party invitations, used condoms and other assorted trash."</LD>
<TE>   Members on some occasions reportedly hurled footballs and bottles
at neighboring residences, smoked marijuana in the streets and mooned
police officers.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the fraternity could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The injunction issued Tuesday by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge
James Wright orders members of the fraternity and property owners to
cease engaging in such nuisance-related activities.</TE>
<TE>   Failure to abide by the terms of the injunction could result in
criminal prosecution, Shannon said.</TE>
<TE>   "The neighbors are mad as hell, and we're ready to assert their
cause," he said. If fraternity members "don't clean up their act,
we'll seek appropriate sanctions against them, the most drastic of
which would be shutting down the house."</TE>

<LD>The Vietnam War? There was Jim Robertson, out on the picket line.
Abortion rights? Back to the picket line again. Name your cause, and
there he was.</LD>
<LD>   It is 7:45 on a dull spring morning in Gardena, and Jim Robertson,
in a double-breasted suit, his hair gone to thistledown-white, is
walking a picket line again.</LD>
<LD>   It is a one-man picket line, and his sign reads: "I Was Sexually
Abused at This School." His cause is his own, and anyone else's who
is what Robertson says he is--a man molested in his youth by a
Catholic clergyman.</LD>
<TE>   He walks a long loop on the pavement outside Junipero Serra High
School, where he graduated 38 years ago. As he paces, he can glimpse
the double doors beyond which lie the chemistry lab.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, Robertson had won the lead in the school play but was
flunking chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   The chemistry teacher, a brother of the Marianist order, offered
one-on-one help. Each time Robertson got something wrong, which was
often, he says, the brother "would twist my arm behind my back and
eventually shove it down the front of his pants."</TE>
<TE>   For eight days this went on, Robertson recounts, until the brother
force-marched him into the room next door, and exposed himself and
masturbated.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson kept thinking of a holy woman the nuns had told him
about who had been sexually abused. He tried to imagine himself being
somewhere else, and remembers hearing the thwaps and shouts from the
baseball game going on outside.</TE>
<TE>   The school looks little changed to him. Next door, where the
brothers lived, is now a convent, and the nuns, out early, walk wide
of the white-haired man on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   Only Robertson has changed, from the altar boy, the scholarship
boy, the teenager cast in "Playboy of the Western World"--and didn't
that turn out to be a joke--into an unbeliever and a job seeker so
wary of authority that he has ricocheted through the world of
commerce in grunt-level jobs, and now sells antiques and
almost-antiques at flea markets.</TE>
<TE>   The self-help books he read, the veterans' hospital support groups
he attended let him confront his problems but not resolve them.</TE>
<TE>   "What's destroyed when people do this to you is trust, and how do
you have relationships without trust?"</TE>
<TE>   That's why he is alone--and why he could come out to this sidewalk
in Gardena: "I don't have a job to lose. I don't have a career to
lose. I don't have a spouse to lose. I don't have children to shame."</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere in the country, the day's news lays out another account
of something sordid and maybe even illegal that some priest allegedly
did to some child.</TE>
<TE>   It is news, but to me it isn't new. In the 1980s, I wrote about a
teenage girl in a parish in Wilmington, seduced by seven
priests--yes, they made Snow White jokes--and impregnated by one.</TE>
<TE>   The church was excused as a defendant in her lawsuit, and the
priests, all Filipino, were nowhere to be found when the process
servers went calling.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years later, the eldest priest called me to get things off
his chest.</TE>
<TE>   He showed me letters from the archdiocese advising him to stay in
the Philippines, and copies of checks equal to his priest's salary
sent to him with a note asking that he "not reveal that you are being
paid by the Los Angeles Archdiocese unless requested under oath."</TE>
<TE>   Reading Jim Robertson's 1995 lawsuit this week, I saw that same
case cited by the church: that it is not liable for sexual misconduct
by its priests.</TE>
<TE>   And Robertson's case was dismissed, for statute of limitation
reasons, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the '80s, parishioners in Wilmington were furious with the
messengers. On the day the front-page story ran, the paper was
scolded from the pulpit by the cardinal himself, Timothy Manning.</TE>
<TE>   Fast-forward to now, to the sidewalk in Gardena. The parents
taking their children to class at Serra High glower at Robertson and
his sign. Only one so much as asks him, "Is he still teaching here?"</TE>
<TE>   Before he filed his suit, Robertson says, he met with church
lawyers, a Marianist and a therapist. He was offered $12,000 for
therapy, he says, but "the look on [the Marianist's] face was, 'I
know you'll go for the money because that's what this is all about.'"</TE>
<TE>   He felt abused all over again, angry all over again. That's why he
filed the lawsuit; that's why the other side of his picket sign
reads, "Not all victims are compensated."</TE>
<TE>   All he got from this was a passing grade in chemistry. He says he
and some friends had sent the teacher notes: "'Given what happened, I
think I need to get at least a B.' So I was turned into this
blackmailer at 16."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson says the brother stopped him on his way out the door one
day and said, "'You know, they have a name for things like this.' And
I said, 'You know, they've got a name for what you did too.'"</TE>

<HD>Members Seek Funding to Save 2 Jewish Centers</HD>

<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To keep Jewish community centers open in Granada Hills and Silver
Lake, members are looking at ways to independently fund them.</LD>
<LD>   Jewish Community Centers of Greater Los Angeles, which operates
seven facilities in the region, announced in December that five
centers were in danger of being closed for lack of money.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, centers in Sherman Oaks and West Los Angeles have
resolved their problems and are expected to stay open, said David
Novak, a spokesman for the organization.</LD>
<TE>   In a letter dated Friday, the Jewish Federation expressed a desire
to continue operating the Silver Lake facility for a year and the
West Valley center in West Hills indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Prizant, the federation's senior vice president of
communications, confirmed that funding is likely to be available to
the Silver Lake center for one year.</TE>
<TE>   Janie Schulman, who spearheaded the effort to save the Silver Lake
center, said the news is "welcome relief." Its members will discuss
ways to continue when the year is up, she said.</TE>
<TE>   At the North Valley center in Granada Hills--due to be closed in
June--a committee is considering purchasing the land from Jewish
Community Centers, Chairwoman Andrea Goodstein said.</TE>
<TE>   North Valley members will vote on whether to pursue an effort to
fund the center independently. Another option, Goodstein said, is to
find property elsewhere.</TE>

<HD>A Bad Memory for Sele</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He surrenders two home runs to former team, and
Angels lose to Seattle, 8-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Disney invested $80 million in the disastrous adventure that was Mo
Vaughn, then swore off free agency for three years. When the company
rekindled its commitment to winning over the winter, Disney shrugged
off the Vaughn debacle and approved the Angels' $24-million
investment in Aaron Sele.</LD>
<LD>   It's less than two weeks into the season, far too soon to write
off Sele, the Angels or any team except the Detroit Tigers. But the
early return on Disney's investment is not promising: Sele got
shelled in an 8-1 loss to the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday that only
highlighted the gap between the Angels and the defending American
League West champions.</LD>
<LD>   The Mariners beat the Angels 15 of 19 times last season and
haven't missed a beat this season. The Mariners have won the first
three games of this series, by a combined score of 18-6. James
Baldwin held the Angels to one run over seven innings, and Bret Boone
and John Olerud hit home runs off Sele, as the Mariners extended
their Edison Field winning streak to 11 games before a crowd of
17,784.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to beat these guys. There's no ifs, ands or buts about
it," Angel infielder Scott Spiezio said. "If we can't beat these
guys, it's going to be real hard for us to reach our goal and go to
the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners considered Sele a replaceable part of their team. The
Angels consider him an essential part of theirs.</TE>
<TE>   Sele escaped the first inning, in which three batters reached
base, thanks to a double play. But he gave up one run in the third
inning, four in the fourth and two more in the fifth before the
Angels yanked him.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to look any farther than the starting pitcher,"
Sele said. "When you put your team down, 7-0, after five innings,
that's on the starting pitching, period."</TE>
<TE>   Sele won 15 games for the Mariners last season, posting a 3.60
earned-run average. In two starts for the Angels, he's 0-2 with a
9.90 ERA, and he has given up 18 hits in 10 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "He was battling his mechanics out there," catcher Jorge Fabregas
said, "but there's no doubt he'll bounce back. His stuff is too good
not to."</TE>
<TE>   While Sele was willing to take the blame for the defeat, Angel
Manager Mike Scioscia was not willing to pin the loss entirely on his
starting pitcher. Scioscia said the Mariners "got five outs" in the
fourth inning, when they scored four runs.</TE>
<TE>   Olerud, who led off the inning, reached base on an infield single.
Scioscia disputed the call of first base umpire Matt Hollowell, who
ruled that Olerud had beaten the throw from second baseman Adam
Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   With the bases loaded, Dan Wilson doubled home two runs, on a fly
ball that Scioscia said right fielder Tim Salmon should have caught.
Salmon has struggled on offense and defense this season.</TE>
<TE>   On offense, at least, Salmon prospered for one game. Scioscia
dropped him to sixth in the batting order, and Salmon got two hits
and drove in the Angels' lone run.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia's move produced results for Salmon but did nothing for
the rest of the stagnant lineup. Neither did the extra work of
hitting coach Mickey Hatcher, who brought Kennedy and Darin Erstad
out early for a special session of batting practice.</TE>
<TE>   For the second consecutive night, the Angels failed to force the
opposing starter to work hard. Baldwin, discarded by the Dodgers last
fall, needed just 70 pitches to complete seven innings, and the
Angels drew no walks.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariner accountants had to be smiling. The Mariners decided
they ought to spend more money on offense, so they said no thanks
when Sele inquired about a new contract.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners, winners of a record 116 games last season, replaced
him with Baldwin, who attracted little interest in free agency and
signed for $1.25 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are hitting .212, and no one except Troy Glaus has hit
a home run.</TE>

<DH>Prep basketball: Azzam started Westchester's winning ways,
long before school received support from Nike.</DH>
<SE>last in a series</SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He drives the luxury model now, the sharpest-looking,
highest-horsepower boys' basketball team of the lot.</LD>
<LD>   But Ed Azzam also knows there are plenty of people who believe the
Westchester High squad he coaches is nothing but a vehicle of Nike,
its well-heeled sponsor.</LD>
<LD>   Those folks probably weren't around in the early days, he says.</LD>
<TE>   Azzam, 47, has been head coach of the Westchester boys' basketball
team nearly half his life, and he vividly remembers when he could
only dream the Comets would win two state championships and be the
headliner in tournaments across the country, all while receiving free
gear from the world's No. 1 sports retailer.</TE>
<TE>   When Azzam came to Westchester 23 years ago--supposedly for only
one season--he inherited a roster of players who, by his
recollection, ''couldn't dribble, couldn't pass, couldn't shoot.''</TE>
<TE>   Which was OK, because he couldn't coach. He had come to
Westchester after three years as an assistant at West Los Angeles
College thinking he ''had to manage every screen, every shot.''</TE>
<TE>   ''It was bad coaching,'' he said. ''The guys fought me. I fought
the guys.''</TE>
<TE>   And while his teams were snuffed, Azzam burned.</TE>
<TE>   Short and stocky, he had been a guard of little renown as a
player, for Gardena High and West L.A. He fancied himself a good
shooter, but he prided himself on defense.</TE>
<TE>   He coached with the same tenacity as he once hawked opposing
players. He took each loss personally, as if it were a direct
reflection on him.</TE>
<TE>   One particularly humiliating loss stands out.</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw, which dominated City Section basketball in the 1980s,
was badly beating Westchester when Coach Willie West inexplicably
reinserted his starters for the final minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Azzam was beside himself. His team was being shown up, and he was
embarrassed.</TE>
<TE>   John Williams, the Crenshaw star who went on to play for Louisiana
State University and in the NBA, was having a field day ... until he
knocked himself out when, after he ferociously threw down a dunk, the
rim snapped back and hit him in the forehead.</TE>
<TE>   At which point Azzam calmly walked over to Coach West, folded his
arms, and said dryly, ''I hope he's dead.''</TE>
<TE>   The coach smiles when he tells that story. It's an old one but a
good one.</TE>
<TE>   In the past three seasons his teams are 84-11, having won
consecutive City championships by an average of 22 points a game. In
the past six years, Comet alumni includes Brandon Granville and David
Bluthenthal of USC, Billy Knight of UCLA, Tony Bland of San Diego
State, Chris Osborne of Arizona State and Chad Bell of New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Turning Point</TE>
<TE>   Westchester broke Crenshaw's hold by winning City championships in
1991 and '92, and the Comets have had an upper hand in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Things have changed so much that the coach who once felt compelled
to micro-manage everything nowadays lets his players work out for
themselves who they should guard.</TE>
<TE>   By most accounts, Westchester turned the corner for good by
winning its first state championship in the 1997-98 season. Nike was
a partial sponsor that season, providing free shoes to Comet players.</TE>
<TE>   When Westchester won its title, the team was rewarded with a
contract for free complete outfitting for the next four years, making
it easier than ever to attract top players.</TE>
<TE>   This past season, when the Comets went 32-2 and won their second
state championship, each player received more than $1,300 in gear and
most of the team's travel to four out-of-state tournaments was paid
for.</TE>
<TE>   But if anyone thinks Azzam should feel guilty about that, they can
think again. With a friend, he says he once figured out that the
$2,200 he is paid by the school to coach works out to about 25 cents
an hour over the course of a year.</TE>
<TE>   He has worked too hard to attribute too much of his teams' success
to Nike, although, he concedes, its backing ''probably has something
to do with it.''</TE>
<TE>   Nike is certainly a big piece of Westchester's network, but Azzam
has many connections. To wit, part of the foundation for his current
championship team was built this way:</TE>
<TE>   A former Westchester player, Dartgnan Stamps, became a youth
coach, and plucked the best players from the talent-rich playgrounds
in Venice and Inglewood for his travel team. For practice, Stamps
brought his team to the Westchester gymnasium, where the players met
Westchester players and coaches and ended up wanting to attend
Westchester games. At the games, they were allowed into the
Westchester locker room, where they listened to the chalk talks and
go-get-'em speeches of the straight-talking head coach.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, to the surprise of no one, three of Stamps' best
players--none of them from the school's primary attendance
area--enrolled at Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, another of Stamps' youth players--a grade behind the
others--decided to become a Comet. Around the same time, DeWitt
Cotton, another former Westchester player who is now one of the
team's assistant coaches, invited an acquaintance of his--Marlon
Morton--to join him on the Westchester staff.</TE>
<TE>   A year after that, Morton brought in a transfer, a kid he'd known
for nearly 10 years, who quickly became the team's star.</TE>
<TE>   Two years after that, Westchester was state champion.</TE>
<TE>   From Stamps' travel team, seniors Ashanti Cook and Keith Everage
were starters and Brandon Heath, the sixth man, was the Comets'
second-leading scorer. Trevor Ariza, a junior, averaged 12 points and
12 rebounds in skyrocketing to the top of about every major college
recruiting list for next year.</TE>
<TE>   And the kid Morton brought in?</TE>
<TE>   That would be Hassan Adams, a 6-4 guard who led the team in
scoring and became the first Westchester player ever participate in
the prestigious McDonald's All-American game.</TE>
<TE>   Farm System</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Westchester in recent years has been lucky along with being
good. Consider the circuitous route Adams took to the team.</TE>
<TE>   He was barely four feet tall when he started polishing his game on
the courts of St. Andrews Recreation Center, two miles east on
Manchester Boulevard from where the professionals played at the
Forum.</TE>
<TE>   With manicured grass, a sandbox filled with playground equipment,
two well-kept baseball diamonds, three tennis courts, two basketball
half courts and an indoor gymnasium, the park was usually bustling
with activity.</TE>
<TE>   But for Adams it was an escape, a place where he could dream.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in the shadows of the St. Andrews backboards from the
age of 7, he worked on his jump shot and dribbling skills--always
making sure he left before it got too dark and the park changed
personalities.</TE>
<TE>   Decades before, Morton played on the same courts. Only the game
wasn't always basketball. Sometimes, it was gang activity.</TE>
<TE>   Later, breaking free of the street life, Morton played basketball
at Los Angeles Southwest College and the University of La Verne. Then
he came back to St. Andrews as a youth coach, where he quickly became
a fan of Adams.</TE>
<TE>   Morton immediately recognized the kid's talent, but he was even
more impressed by his manners. He was nice, polite and bright-eyed
rather than cocky. And he worked on his game.</TE>
<TE>   Adams wasn't on the team the first year Morton coached, but after
that he made sure to pick him. It was important that his protege
retained the will to stiff-arm beckoning gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Driven to the park by his mother, Adams always had a ride home
from Morton if he needed one.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, Morton predicted Adams would become a special player.
''I told everybody I had the best-kept secret in L.A.,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester is Adams' third high school. As a freshman he attended
Wilmington Banning, and he spent his sophomore year at Verbum Dei
before deciding to leave when former UCLA star David Greenwood quit
as coach.</TE>
<TE>   For another team, Adams would be the centerpiece of the offense
and probably average about 25 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   Not at Westchester. Azzam is steadfast in his share-the-ball
approach. No one player is allowed to carry the scoring load--or even
play the whole game.</TE>
<TE>   Adams, who will be in the University of Arizona's lineup next
season, averaged 18.3 points for Westchester. Darting in and out of
the lineup, six other players averaged between 14.9 and 7.1 points.</TE>
<TE>   Attracting top players is one thing. Keeping them happy is
another. Most quickly conform to their coach's no-nonsense,
team-first tactics. Others transfer.</TE>
<TE>   Jamal Sampson, a starter at center for California last season who
recently declared himself eligible for the NBA draft, played for
Westchester as a freshman. Then he transferred to Santa Ana Mater
Dei, where he teamed with Cedric Bozeman to help the Monarchs to a
state championship in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Another former Westchester player is in his second NBA season.
Jason Hart, a guard, left after his junior season in 1995. The next
year, he averaged 24.5 points for Inglewood, earning a scholarship to
Syracuse. He is a reserve for the San Antonio Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   Azzam didn't like losing either player, but he understood why they
had to go.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is generation of instant gratification,'' he said. ''From
the channel changer to the Internet it's everywhere, and I think it's
carried over to athletics.''</TE>
<TE>   Controlling Egos</TE>
<TE>   With so many potential stars, Westchester coaches are careful to
keep an eye out for petty jealousies than can pop up like knotweed in
a seemingly well-manicured landscape.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's tough keeping their heads from getting too big,'' Azzam
said. ''They all have entourages wherever they go.''</TE>
<TE>   Early in the season against Hawthorne, Ariza dribbled into the
frontcourt and launched a three-point shot without looking to pass, a
mistake the prompted frowns and stares from teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Azzam, whose moods can range from strangely stoic to comically
animated over the course of a game, quickly took control.</TE>
<TE>   ''If we don't stop playing selfish, we'll play four-on-five in the
second half,'' he said. The score at the time, with about a minute
left before the half, was 58-21. Westchester would go on to win,
118-45.</TE>
<TE>   Azzam tried to keep a short leash, all the while acknowledging,
"if none of our coaches ever showed up for games or practices, we'd
still win almost every game. Structure only shows up in important
games."</TE>
<TE>   The Comets had a breakdown in one such situation later in the
season, and it cost them the No. 1 national ranking.</TE>
<TE>   Matched against then-No. 2-ranked Oak Hill (Va.) Academy, the
favored Comets barely showed up. Their defense was bad, their
rebounding worse, and they made only three of 16 three-point shots.</TE>
<TE>   "All of you, every time you get the ball, all you're looking to do
is score," Azzam yelled at halftime. "You're too busy looking at the
ball, dribbling it between your legs, to notice anybody else."</TE>
<TE>   The aftermath of that game, the players say, was the turning point
of Westchester's season.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Williams, a seldom-used guard, called a players-only meeting
in his hotel room. It started about 12:30 in the morning and lasted
for 90 minutes as each player was given an opportunity to speak.</TE>
<TE>   Fingers were pointed, voices were raised, and the Comets emerged a
closer and better team.</TE>
<TE>   "Our heads had become swollen a little," Adams said. "I'm kind of
glad we lost."</TE>
<TE>   Calm Before the Storm</TE>
<TE>   Ten days later, the bus was near silent as Westchester traveled to
play Fairfax, its Western League rival. There were 11 varsity
players, 18 from the junior varsity, five coaches, 14 cheerleaders
and a team manager, but conversation was practically nonexistent.</TE>
<TE>   Azzam likes it that way. No noise on the bus.</TE>
<TE>   There was plenty enough in the Fairfax gym.</TE>
<TE>   By the second quarter of the junior varsity game, there already
were 1,200 fans in place waiting for the main event. Outside, about
100 fans were stuck without tickets, including members of the UCLA
basketball team who later barged in.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, it was so hot that the gym appeared to be sweating,
condensation snaking down the pale, damp walls.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester was just as hot during the game, playing its best ball
of the season in a 100-68 rout of the team it would later play for
the City championship.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester would lose only one more game--a league rematach
Fairfax--and would end the season on a 12-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Azzam wasn't always satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   There is a catch to always being the best-funded, most-talented
team.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't win the way I'd like to," he said two months later,
after the Comets defeated Oakland Tech, 80-75, in the state title
game. "I hate winning just because we're more athletic."</TE>
<TE>   It looks like he'll have to get used to it.</TE>
<TE>   Although Westchester's contract with Nike is up, it's partnership
probably isn't.</TE>
<TE>   Coming off a championship season, and with standout juniors Ariza
and Scott Cutley expected back next season, Westchester will be a hot
commodity. Another shoe contract seems certain, the next one probably
even more lucrative than the last.</TE>
<TE>   Adidas plans on taking a run at stealing the Comets from Nike, but
not even Sonny Vaccaro, the adidas consultant, holds much hope.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll help Westchester get a big raise [from Nike]," he said.
"There's no way in the world that Nike would allow Westchester to get
out of their stable."</TE>
<TE>   And so the rich will get richer.</TE>
<TE>   Probably in more ways than one.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, the senior point guard, has a younger brother, Ahmaad, who
is due in. Granville's brother, Cameron, is also expected to join the
Comets, as is Andre Dunn Jr., a 6-foot guard from a local middle
school, and Matthew Shaw, a 6-7 post player from Gardena who experts
favorably compare to Sampson at the same age.</TE>
<TE>   There are also whispers about possible transfers who are on the
way, including Compton Centennial guard Gabriel Pruitt, who would
have two years of eligibility remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Not everything looks rosy, though. Westchester has adversaries,
coaches and administrators who would like to see the days of lavishly
sponsored teams come to an end.</TE>
<TE>   Comet Athletic Director Brian Henderson isn't worried. "Positive
things are still going to happen for us because we have an excellent,
well-coached program," he said.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Takes a Slice Out of the Dodgers</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Opposite-field double in ninth gives Giants a 2-1
victory after L.A. misses opportunities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>That familiar chant began echoing through Pacific Bell Park in the
seventh inning Wednesday night. "Beat L.A.! Beat L.A.! Beat L.A.!"
San Francisco fans yelled in unison.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers did just that, committing a seventh-inning baserunning
blunder that proved costly in a 2-1 loss to the Giants before a
sellout crowd of 40,762.</LD>
<LD>   Barry Bonds won the game in the bottom of the ninth for San
Francisco, slicing a fly-ball double off reliever Paul Quantrill
inside the left-field line to score David Bell from first and snap a
1-1 tie, but the Giants didn't so much win the game as the Dodgers
lost it.</LD>
<TE>   Dave Roberts ran through a stop sign and was doubled off second
base in the first inning, and Mark Grudzielanek failed to advance a
runner from second with no outs in the seventh and to execute a
sacrifice bunt with two on and no outs in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   But the most glaring mistake came in the seventh, when the
Dodgers, who had their win streak ended at four, failed to score
despite hitting two doubles.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 1-0, Eric Karros opened the seventh with a double to
left off Giant starter Ryan Jensen. Grudzielanek flied to center.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy replaced Karros with seldom-used Hiram
Bocachica, who would have a much better chance than Karros of scoring
on a hit.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers got that hit, as Adrian Beltre rifled a double off the
center-field wall, but even though it was clear center fielder
Tsuyoshi Shinjo had virtually no chance of catching the ball,
Bocachica went back to tag up.</TE>
<TE>   Shinjo played the carom perfectly and fired a throw back to the
infield in time to hold Bocachica at third. With the San Francisco
infield back, conceding a run, Chad Krueter struck out. Felix
Rodriguez came on to retire pinch-hitter Paul Lo Duca on an
inning-ending grounder to third.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers tied the game with an improbable ninth-inning rally
off closer Robb Nen, but that was of no consolation to Bocachica.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost us the ... game, what can I say?" Bocachica said.</TE>
<TE>   Third-base coach Glenn Hoffman said he tried to help.</TE>
<TE>   "I was yelling at him, 'Halfway! Halfway!' He turned around to
watch it," Hoffman said. "People were screaming, and he couldn't hear
me. I can't yell over that many people. It was a mistake. Hopefully
he'll learn from it."</TE>
<TE>   Wasted was a superb effort by Dodger starter Odalis Perez, who
limited the Giants to one run--Shinjo's fourth-inning solo homer--and
three hits in six innings. The left-hander struck out three and
walked none in an extremely efficient 55-pitch outing.</TE>
<TE>   But at least Perez wasn't tagged with the loss. Roberts saved a
run with a diving catch of Shinjo's flare in shallow left-center to
strand Ramon Martinez to end the eighth inning, a play that loomed
large when the Dodgers tied the game in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Nen, who led the National League with 45 saves in 52 chances last
season, gave up singles to Brian Jordan and pinch-hitter Dave Hansen
to open the inning. Grudzielanek fouled off two bunt attempts before
striking out.</TE>
<TE>   Nen shattered Beltre's bat with a nasty inside pitch, but Beltre
got enough of the ball to send a dribbler to third for an infield
single, loading the bases. Pinch-hitter Marquis Grissom rolled a
grounder to the shortstop hole for an RBI fielder's choice and a 1-1
tie.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre appeared to beat the throw to second, but umpire Tim
Timmons ruled Beltre out on the force. Lo Duca then flied to center,
ending the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a call at second base that was missed, and that changed
the complexion of the top of the ninth," Tracy said. "Instead of the
bases loaded and one out, we have runners on first and third with two
out."</TE>
<TE>   That play, however, wasn't as pivotal as the Dodger baserunning
errors.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very tough game to lose, due to the fact we made a
couple of mistakes that hurt us," Tracy said. "From an execution
standpoint, we've had a high percentage of success on the small
aspects of the game, but there's no guarantee you're going to get
100% execution over the course of 162 games."</TE>

<HD>Augusta Ready for Big Finish</HD>
<DH>Golf: Of all the changes made to Masters course,
lengthening of 18th hole appears most significant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>The Masters begins today at Augusta National, which must have been
puny before because it's certainly buff now. Actually, the place did
look sort of weak last year when Tiger Woods played the 18th hole
Sunday with a driver and sand wedge.</LD>
<LD>   It sounded almost like dance step ... driver, sand wedge, 15-foot
birdie putt ... cha, cha, cha. But it was hardly music to the ears of
the guys in the green jackets. It's true that the Augusta National
honchos already had announced they were going to make the course
tougher days before Woods made it look puny, but you can be sure that
the ease with which Woods handled the 18th made their resolve even
stronger.</LD>
<LD>   Hootie Johnson, chairman of Augusta National, said he feels good
about the 18th hole. In fact, he used the words "real good," so you
know he means business.</LD>
<TE>   "A three-wood and a pitching wedge won't do for a finishing hole,"
Johnson said Wednesday. "I think most everyone agrees that the hole
was weak for a finishing hole in a [major] championship.</TE>
<TE>   "Some folks, if they are leading by one, they are going to be damn
glad to get a par, and that's OK."</TE>
<TE>   And so the 18th is now 60 yards longer, up to 465 yards, and might
become the new signature hole at the old course.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Norman says it will soon be one of the best last holes in the
world.</TE>
<TE>   "It will work its way up there being one of the great finishing
holes," he said. "You know, when you see a guy hitting a sand wedge
to the 18th hole of a major championship, it doesn't do anything for
you. It doesn't do anything for the game, [but] it wasn't just one
guy last year, it was a lot of guys doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Norman was referring to Woods, of course, the undisputed leader in
long-ball-hitting at the Masters and its defending champion.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, Woods is the player to beat in the 89-player field,
although there is a slight difference of opinion. It's probably just
a game of shift-the-pressure. Norman says Phil Mickelson is the guy
and Mickelson says Woods is the guy and Woods says he's just one of
the guys.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson was pretty direct in his comments.</TE>
<TE>   "The player to look at is the No. 1 player in the world, Tiger,"
Mickelson said. "And given his length and accuracy and distance
control, he's going to be the guy to beat."</TE>
<TE>   All Woods will allow is that hitting the ball a long way isn't
going to hurt anyone who can do it.</TE>
<TE>   "It helps to have distance off the tee, but you've got to be
accurate," he said. "You know, the golf course definitely favors a
guy that hits the ball a little farther, but you have to hit the ball
straight too. You can't just bomb it away with the intent that with
any drive you make birdie or par like you used to in the past."</TE>
<TE>   It rained Tuesday night and sprinkled during the day Wednesday,
which slowed down the greens, much to the chagrin of the tournament
committee. On Sunday and Monday, the committee had them the way they
liked them, which is faster than a pace car. But rain also softens
the fairways and cuts down on the amount of roll the players are
going to get from their drives, thus making the course play longer.</TE>
<TE>   Now, whom does that condition favor?</TE>
<TE>   Woods, of course, or players with the advantage of distance off
the tee.</TE>
<TE>   It's Woods' opinion that the changes made to the course weren't
really necessary for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 300 yards were added and nine holes were altered, some by
enlarging or moving bunkers, relocating tees and regrading fairways.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they were as necessary right now, but I understand
where they are coming from," he said. "The guys are getting longer
and they don't want to see the winning score being--well, I won with
18 under [in 1997] and they don't want to see it that low. They would
rather see it in single digits."</TE>
<TE>   Woods plays the first two rounds with Bubba Dickerson, the U.S.
Amateur champion, and Toshi Izawa of Japan. Izawa had consecutive
aces in Wednesday's par-three contest, thus guaranteeing that he has
used up all his luck for the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson, Vijay Singh, Ernie Els, Jose Maria Olazabal, Retief
Goosen and David Duval, to name a few, have drawn attention as
possible contenders for Woods' title. Of those, only Singh in 2000
and Olazabal in 1994 and 1999 have won here before.</TE>
<TE>   Duval says he likes the changes to the course, although he wasn't
sure he would.</TE>
<TE>   "The way they were done, the way that they have really settled in,
they just seem to fit and flow so well," he said. "I wasn't as
overwhelmed as I thought I might have been. It seemed very natural to
me, kind of like they had been there for quite some time."</TE>
<TE>   John Daly, one of the longest hitters, believes players won't be
able to put as much spin on the ball because they're hitting longer
clubs into the green. That could be an advantage, Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could just get the putter going a little bit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Daly said the changes have increased the difficulty of Augusta
National, mainly because players who are so accurate with wedges will
be hitting seven-irons or eight-irons much more often.</TE>
<TE>   Said Daly: "I think it's a great test of golf. It's a lot harder
than it has been in the past and I think that's probably good for
me."</TE>
<TE>   And the new 18th, the one that makes Johnson smile, might be the
hardest of them all. For the record, Woods says he will hit an
eight-iron into the green. That's after he keeps the ball from going
right off the tee and into the trees ... and avoids the yawning
bunker on the left ... and before he tries for the new pin position
on the right, just over that bunker ... and before he putts the ball
on a slippery green.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody said winning the Masters should be easy.</TE>

<HD>Traditionally, Masters Creates Mixed Emotions</HD>

<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>And so, for the 66th time, the sports world gathers today to ponder a
question more enduring than an oak, more colorful than an azalea,
more compelling than a long amen.</LD>
<LD>   What's with the green jackets, anyway?</LD>
<LD>   Dashing? Or dog ugly?</LD>
<TE>   There are people in this world--89 this week, in particular--who
spend their lives striving to win such a jacket.</TE>
<TE>   There are others, however, who wouldn't dare drape one across the
back of anything other than a table or a thoroughbred.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the Masters, a golf tournament that, like sweet tea and
sour mash, depends completely on your point of view.</TE>
<TE>   It has been relentlessly billed by its television partner as "A
tradition unlike any other."</TE>
<TE>   While absolutely true, that does not mean it is necessarily good.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the history of organized athletics, there have been
other traditions unlike any other.</TE>
<TE>   The Olympics were once contested entirely in the nude. Pasadena
once celebrated New Year's Day with a chariot race.</TE>
<TE>   I love the Masters, with its grace and good manners and gumption
to resist change.</TE>
<TE>   But there are times I feel awfully guilty about it.</TE>
<TE>   I love it that the world's greatest golf tournament is run by a
small club that controls a special course that is open only several
months each year.</TE>
<TE>   But this club has no women members and reportedly only four black
members and answers to no one.</TE>
<TE>   When asked to explain himself on another topic Wednesday, chairman
Hootie Johnson gave an answer that pretty much covered them all.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have to give you a reason," Johnson said. "Mr. Roberts
wouldn't give you a reason."</TE>
<TE>   He was speaking of Clifford Roberts, a Wall Street sharpie who was
one of the Augusta National Golf Club's co-founders with legendary
golfer Bobby Jones.</TE>
<TE>   They envisioned this place as a perfect golfing retreat, and,
indeed, it is.</TE>
<TE>   Perfectly beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   Perfectly eerie.</TE>
<TE>   I love it that it is the only remaining professional sports event
of any magnitude that allows no advertising in its arena, accounting
for a golf course that is as dignified as it is quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Yet officials have scolded or blackballed announcers who have
criticized the grounds, and until this year they have rarely allowed
television to show any part of the front nine.</TE>
<TE>   Oops. They don't call it a "front nine." They call it a "first
nine."</TE>
<TE>   They also don't call the area outside the fairway a "rough." They
call it a "second cut."</TE>
<TE>   And so will you if you want to talk about it on television.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that Mr. Roberts and Bobby Jones set a pace for
excellence and for courtesy and doing the right thing," Johnson said.
"We just try to continue that."</TE>
<TE>   As witnessed in the concession offerings--egg salad sandwiches,
pink lemonade, headache powder--the right thing is different here
than in other places.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, certainly, it feels right. Other times, though, it
plays as awkwardly as a grainy black-and-white movie with jumbled
sound.</TE>
<TE>   The Masters is the only major tournament that has continually
invited its former winners to play each year.</TE>
<TE>   It is a lovely practice that came to a sudden halt this winter
when officials decided that Doug Ford, Billy Casper and Gay
Brewer--the bottom three finishers in last year's tournament and all
at least 70--were just too old.</TE>
<TE>   How did the three men find out?</TE>
<TE>   They were mailed letters.</TE>
<TE>   Brewer was so "devastated," according to Casper, that he boycotted
this year's Champions Dinner.</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether he should have handled it differently, Johnson
said, "I don't look back."</TE>
<TE>   Thus proving that the chairman is as paradoxical as his
tournament, a respected banker with a sterling record on diversity
who puts on a green jacket and suddenly sounds like an arrogant
small-town sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere you look here, it seems, it is a tradition that comes
with baggage.</TE>
<TE>   I love it that the Masters tickets are incredibly cheap by modern
standards--$125 for a four-day pass in a world of $400 Super Bowl
tickets.</TE>
<TE>   But the tickets haven't been available for 40 years, passed down
from old families, old money, old connections.</TE>
<TE>   While today's average golf crowd is increasingly diverse, the most
compelling sight here in recent years is that of Tiger Woods walking
down a fairway surrounded by cheering throngs that are completely
white.</TE>
<TE>   Once inside, the prices get even better, with one able to purchase
two sandwiches, a soda and chips for $5.</TE>
<TE>   Even the souvenirs, which cannot be purchased anywhere else, or on
any other weekend, are the cheapest in sports.</TE>
<TE>   "We think a piece of clothing or souvenir here is kind of special
to the people that have been here," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Although located on what appears to be the corner of Waffle House
Drive and Bojangles Court in a commercial strip of a cluttered little
town, the course itself is a classic souvenir.</TE>
<TE>   The tree-lined entrance area feels like a giant back porch, with
green wooden booths and ceiling fans and even an old-fashioned water
fountain.</TE>
<TE>   The grounds are so quiet, the most dominating sound for the next
four days will be that of the birds.</TE>
<TE>   The air smells like someone ran down the middle of the fairway
spraying pine-scented air freshener.</TE>
<TE>   When the player hits a ball into trouble, that often means he is
hitting into something that looks like the showroom of your
neighborhood florist.</TE>
<TE>   The grounds are impeccably maintained by kids wearing yellow
jumpsuits with caps that read, "Litter."</TE>
<TE>   Even the bathrooms are clean, and permanent, meaning 7,270 yards
of course and not one Porta Potti.</TE>
<TE>   The Masters also attempts to be pure in the game itself, and
officials have added 285 yards to this year's course in hopes of
making it more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Barkley's silly racist charges aside--hey, this gives
Tiger Woods a bigger advantage--most have agreed that the changes
will be good.</TE>
<TE>   But ... and yes, with the Masters, there is always a but ...</TE>
<TE>   There are no periscopes allowed. So unless you're in one of the
front rows, or camp out on one of the bleachers, you cannot see.</TE>
<TE>   There are, for the first time, no cell phones or beepers allowed.</TE>
<TE>   And the one sin that will get your ticket pulled faster than a
Tiger fist pump?</TE>
<TE>   No running.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, don't try to hurry over to watch a new leader,
just enjoy the view.</TE>
<TE>   A wonderful assignment, as long as one doesn't look too close.</TE>

<LD>"Winning Solves All Problems"</LD>
<LD>   Gold-lettered sign</LD>
<LD>   on the desk of J.D. Morgan</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   J.D. Morgan was athletic director during UCLA's spectacular ascent
in basketball and assorted smaller sports in the 1960s and '70s, a
bottom-line numbers cruncher with an accounting background who
forbade black ink to turn red.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan, however, knew that the nickname "J.D. Midas" referred more
to his golden touch with win-loss records than with dollar signs.</TE>
<TE>   Pauley Pavilion opened two years after he took the post in 1963,
providing Bruin basketball with a permanent home after years of
playing at the on-campus men's gym, the Sports Arena and several
other Los Angeles venues. But without 10 national championships in 12
years, few would have cared.</TE>
<TE>   Drake Stadium and Spaulding Field also were built early in
Morgan's tenure, but it was the Bruins' first Rose Bowl victory, in
1966, that had Westwood buzzing.</TE>
<TE>   He quickly wiped out a six-figure deficit, doubled the athletics
budget, quadrupled radio-TV income and cut student fees. Yet UCLA's
30 national titles during his 17-year tenure became his legacy, the
standard against which other Bruin athletic directors are measured.</TE>
<TE>   So who's next?</TE>
<TE>   A replacement for current Athletic Director Pete Dalis--whose
retirement is effective in June--will come from a group of finalists
comprised of his top assistant, Betsy Stephenson, and athletic
directors Gary Walters of Princeton, Gene Bleymaier of Boise State
and Dan Guerrero of UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Purdy, UCLA associate athletic director for fund-raising, and
Gary Cunningham, athletic director at UC Santa Barbara and a former
Bruin basketball coach, were candidates until this week.</TE>
<TE>   Chancellor Albert Carnesale is conducting final interviews with
the four finalists, who were chosen by a six-person search committee
headed by Vice Chancellor Pete Blackman. The job is expected to be
filled before May 1.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Morgan's success was a product of the era. Building
facilities was far less expensive, women's sports received scant
attention and the Bruin basketball dynasty was primarily the work of
legendary Coach John Wooden, who was beginning his 16th season when
Morgan took the reins.</TE>
<TE>   But the charismatic athletic director, whose deep, resonant voice
projected unquestioned authority, also took firm control, relieving
Wooden of budgetary and scheduling duties. Upon his hiring, Morgan
wrote in a memo, "We are going with the same head coaches. I have
faith and confidence that the staff will do an outstanding job. If
there has been a weakness, it has been in the tools with which
they've had to work. My job will be to develop those tools, whether
they be buildings, equipment, funds or programs, to assist these top
coaches in doing a great job."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan retired 1980 because of failing health and after a national
search was succeeded by his assistant, Robert Fischer. Three years
later Fischer resigned and Chancellor Charles Young went the
expeditious route, appointing Dalis, a little-known director of
cultural and recreational affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the inherent constraints, Dalis held the job two years
longer than Morgan and continued UCLA's overall success, winning 39
national titles in 14 sports. Only one national title came in
basketball, however, and football is still seeking its first
championship since 1954.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Dalis' greatest accomplishment was launching a program
that endows more than half of UCLA's athletic grants-in-aid. The
principal has grown to $20 million and interest is used to pay for
scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   Dalis also supervised the construction of the $13-million Morgan
Center, which opened in 2000 and houses athletics offices and the
UCLA Hall of Fame. A $14-million renovation of the Acosta Center is
underway, expanding weight training and sports medicine facilities,
providing meeting rooms and additional space for lockers.</TE>
<TE>   But the same factors that dampened the interest of high-profile
candidates upon Morgan's retirement apply now. The pay is lower than
at most comparable universities--Dalis makes $230,000 after getting a
$70,000 raise in response to the contract given new California
Athletic Director Steve Gladstone--and the opportunity to make a
lasting imprint by developing new facilities is almost nonexistent.</TE>
<TE>   The expensive Westwood and Bel-Air neighborhoods surrounding the
campus will not allow the construction of an on-campus football
stadium, leaving UCLA little choice but to continue playing home
games at the aging Rose Bowl in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Facilities director Rich Mylin does a good job keeping Pauley
Pavilion from falling into disrepair, and serious renovation of the
37-year old arena is in only the discussion stages.</TE>
<TE>   It is also questionable whether a new athletic director will have
the autonomy to replace high-profile coaches. Shortly after the
Bruins won the NCAA basketball championship in 1995, then-coach Jim
Harrick said, "There's only been one guy that had any influence over
the UCLA basketball program. When I was an assistant it was J.D.
Morgan. And since he passed away, there's only been one name, and
that's Chancellor Young."</TE>
<TE>   Now the names are Blackman, a Bruin basketball player under Wooden
from 1960-62, and Carnesale, who replaced Young in 1997, one year
after football Coach Bob Toledo and basketball Coach Steve Lavin were
hired.</TE>
<TE>   It is presumed in Westwood that both coaches are secure until
Blackman and Carnesale indicate otherwise, a situation that Morgan--a
World War II torpedo boat commander--probably would have found
intolerable.</TE>
<TE>   "The two most important ingredients of a strong athletic program
are expert coaches and superior student-athletes," Morgan, who died
in December 1980, once said. "If you can't pick the right people to
coach your teams, it doesn't do much good to have a good business
mind."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan hired Terry Donahue as football coach, but spurning Denny
Crum as Wooden's replacement in 1975 is regarded as his most glaring
mistake. Crum, a former Wooden assistant, was the coach at Louisville
and wanted to succeed his legendary mentor.</TE>
<TE>   But Morgan tabbed Gene Bartow, beginning a seven-coach shuttle
that eventually led to Lavin in 1996. Crum won more than 600 games
and won two NCAA championships in 30 years at Louisville.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, Dalis' successor might be faced with finding a new
basketball or football coach, or at least making a recommendation to
Blackman and Carnesale. But the immediate task is more
mundane--cleaning up the image of a program beset by embarrassing
incidents and rules infractions.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in 1995, there was the softball team forfeiting the
national title for using an ineligible player, the firing of Harrick
for falsifying an expense report, the handicapped parking scandal
involving football players, the fraudulent college degree of soccer
coach Todd Saldana, the extra-benefits violations of basketball
player JaRon Rush and football player DeShaun Foster, and the highly
publicized personal problems of basketball players Jelani McCoy and
Kris Johnson, and football player Cory Paus.</TE>
<TE>   Another challenge will be to continue balancing the $35-million
budget, something Dalis accomplished every year since erasing a
$3-million deficit in the early 1990s. The tripod of traditional
revenue--ticket sales, television revenue and private donations--is
reliable yet difficult to enhance.</TE>
<TE>   A quick fix could be home basketball attendance, which dipped from
about 11,000 per game in 1994 to 8,765 in 2000-01 before spiking to
10,021 this season.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, it appears there is less to the job of UCLA athletic
director than meets the eye. The person Carnesale chooses will be
relatively underpaid, probably lack the authority to fire and hire
coaches as he or she pleases, and be limited in building facilities
because of land and capital shortages.</TE>
<TE>   It's a far cry from the position that awaited Morgan, who
considered it "the most interesting, rewarding, challenging,
stimulating, satisfying and fascinating work a man could hope to
find."</TE>

<LD>Gene Bleymaier</LD>
<LD>   Boise State</LD>
<LD>   athletic director, 21 years</LD>
<TE>   A week ago Bleymaier unveiled a new school logo with a horse head
and the script "Boise State Broncos" underneath--but most of his
accomplishments involve substance.</TE>
<TE>   Although Boise State is nowhere near the size of UCLA, fielding 17
sports on a $10-million budget, a quarter of the money goes toward a
football program that upgraded from Division I-AA to Division I-A in
1996 and joined the Western Athletic Conference in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   It is significant that he is the only external candidate from a
school with Division I football and the team is 33-14 the last four
years.</TE>
<TE>   Boise State has played host to the first two rounds of the NCAA
men's basketball tournament six times under Bleymaier and hosted the
women's West Regional in March.</TE>
<TE>   He was the driving force behind the 1997 creation of the
Humanitarian Bowl, which the host Broncos won in 1999 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Until this year, a knock on Bleymaier was that he had not fired a
prominent coach. But in March he fired men's basketball coach Rod
Jensen after a 13-17 season, replacing him with Oregon assistant Greg
Graham, and forced the resignation of women's coach Trisha Stephens,
replacing her with Colorado assistant Jen Warden.</TE>
<TE>   Bleymaier has UCLA roots, playing tight end on the football team,
graduating in 1975 and serving as assistant athletic director under
J.D. Morgan while still in his 20s.</TE>

<LD>Dan Guerrero</LD>
<LD>   UC Irvine</LD>
<LD>   athletic director, 10 years</LD>
<TE>   Guerrero is the only candidate to openly acknowledge interest in
the job, saying, "I was contacted by a representative at UCLA and
asked to consider the job. UCLA is my alma mater, and that position
has not opened for 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   His impact at Irvine has been profound, resurrecting the baseball
program this year and spearheading $38 million of newly constructed
and renovated facilities, including track and soccer complexes and a
64-meter swimming pool.</TE>
<TE>   Another $22 million in facilities enhancements are planned soon,
including an additional 27 acres of athletic field space and tennis
courts adjacent to a newly built $35-million recreation center, an
expansion of the sports medicine, strength and conditioning center
and a new boathouse for crew.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the facilities money came from two student referendums
that Guerrero was instrumental in pushing through. He tabbed five
prominent Anteater athletes to head the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero, the lone minority candidate, was athletic director at
Cal State Dominguez Hills, where he earned a master's degree. If he
has an advantage over the other external candidates, it is that he
knows the Southern California landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Like Bleymaier, he graduated from UCLA and was an athlete,
starring on the baseball team for four years. Guerrero was inducted
into the UCLA Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996.</TE>

<LD>Betsy Stephenson</LD>
<LD>   UCLA</LD>
<LD>   associate athletic director,</LD>
<TE>   six years</TE>
<TE>   Stephenson's workload has increased as the 19-year tenure of
Athletic Director Pete Dalis has come to a close. Last fall, she was
the liaison to the NCAA in rules infraction cases involving tailback
DeShaun Foster and volleyball player Kristee Porter.</TE>
<TE>   However, she also hired soccer coach Todd Saldana twice--as
women's coach in 1998 and as men's coach in 1999--without recognizing
that his bachelor's degree was from an unaccredited university.
Saldana resigned under pressure in January.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to supervising 12 men's and women's sports, Stephenson
oversees the recruiting, academic services, student services and
marketing units.</TE>
<TE>   Stephenson had many of the same responsibilities from 1992-96 as
associate athletic director at Kansas, her alma mater. She played on
the Jayhawk volleyball team and graduated in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Her first administrative job came with the NCAA, and for four
years she was director of Division I men's basketball operations. At
UCLA, she succeeded longtime administrator Judith Holland, who during
a 20-year tenure saw Bruin women's athletics evolve from little more
than a recreational activity with a $263,000 budget into one of the
nation's top programs.</TE>
<TE>   If hired, she would join a select group of female Division I
athletic directors that includes Barbara Hedges of Washington,
Deborah Yow of Maryland and Judy Rose of North Carolina Charlotte.</TE>

<LD>Gary Walters</LD>
<LD>   Princeton</LD>
<LD>   athletic director, seven years</LD>
<TE>   Some at Princeton were unsure what to make of it, but being
selected the No. 10 Jock School in the nation by Sports Illustrated
five years ago was a feather in the cap of Walters, a former
basketball player and coach at the school.</TE>
<TE>   He once said, "Intercollegiate athletics is a complementary
element of the educational curriculum at Princeton.... Athletics just
happens to be the sweatiest of the liberal arts."</TE>
<TE>   Princeton has had the Ivy League's most successful athletic
program under Walters, winning 83 league titles and 17 national
championships. Of the school's 33 Ivy League sports, 30 have won
league titles.</TE>
<TE>   Princeton finished in the Top 25 in the Sears Directors' Cup,
which rewards broad-based programs, in 1996, 1998 and 2001--the only
nonscholarship school to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Walters has overseen a dramatic renovation of facilities, most
notably the demolition of Palmer Stadium and the building of
Princeton Stadium and a track and field stadium in its place.</TE>
<TE>   A point guard who played in high school under legendary Coach Pete
Carril and at Princeton under Butch van Breda Kolff, Walters at 24
became the youngest head basketball coach in NCAA history when he
took over at Middlebury College in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   He also was head coach at Union College, Dartmouth and Providence,
and worked in private business for 15 years. Walters is a longtime
acquaintance of UCLA Chancellor Albert Carnesale.</TE>

<HD>One Extreme to Other for Giambi</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Giambi's first two home runs for the Yankees failed to get New
York a victory.</LD>
<LD>   Giambi homered in his first two-bats but then struck out in his
final three as the Toronto Blue Jays ended New York's seven-game
winning streak, 9-7, Wednesday night at Toronto.</LD>
<LD>   "It felt good to get that first one out of the way, but I'd
definitely trade it for a Yankees win," Giambi said.</LD>
<TE>   Giambi, who began the season in three-for-21 slump, hit a two-run
homer in the first inning off Brandon Lyon, a drive off the window of
SkyDome's Windows restaurant in center field. He had a solo shot in
the third.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm starting to come around," said Giambi, who left Oakland to
sign a $120-million, seven-year contract in the off-season. "I'm
starting to feel really comfortable at the plate. Hopefully, soon
enough things will start working out."</TE>
<TE>   After Giambi struck out with the bases loaded in the seventh,
Jorge Posada's two-run double tied the score, 7-7.</TE>
<TE>   Felipe Lopez hit a tiebreaking homer off Ted Lilly (0-1) in the
bottom half and Carlos Delgado homered off Steve Karsay in the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "Giambi only drove in three runs," Toronto's Homer Bush said. "Our
pitchers deserve some credit for getting this cat out. He went from
one extreme to the other."</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Borbon (1-0) got two outs in the seventh, striking out Robin
Ventura with the bases loaded, as the Blue Jays ended a five-game
losing streak. Ventura has a .346 career average with the bases
loaded.</TE>
<TE>   Kelvim Escobar pitched the ninth and got the save in his first
chance of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 7, Detroit 5--The Tiger losing streak stretched to eight--
their worst start in a half-century--as Frank Thomas capped a
five-run fifth inning with a three-run homer that led the White Sox
to a victory at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers, the major leagues' lone winless team, also started the
1952 season 0-8. Detroit has lost two games since Luis Pujols
replaced Phil Garner as manager.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 4, Oakland 2--John Rocker got his first save for the Rangers
and Rusty Greer hit his first homer since June 8 against Houston as
the Rangers won at Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Rocker, who blew his first save opportunity after coming in with a
3-2 lead in the ninth Tuesday night, got three called strikeouts in
the ninth to save the game for Dave Burba (1-0).</TE>
<TE>   Juan Gonzalez missed the game for the Rangers because of a bruised
right thumb.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 6, Boston 2--Paul Byrd (2-0) gave up two runs and five
hits in seven innings at Boston and Mike Sweeney got three hits and
scored twice, ending a four-game winning streak for the Red Sox, who
hadn't lost since opening day.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Lowe (1-1) gave up two runs and eight hits in seven innings.
It was his first start since holding Baltimore hitless for seven
innings in a 3-0 victory last Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 9, Minnesota 3--Jim Thome busted out of another April
slump with a grand slam and five RBIs at Cleveland as the Indians won
their seventh in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Thome was batting only .143 and hadn't hit a homer before
connecting in the second inning off Rick Reed (1-1).</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 3, Baltimore 2--Paul Wilson (1-0) gave up four hits in
seven innings at Baltimore as the Orioles lost their sixth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Tyner drove in a run and scored one for the Devil Rays, who
improved to 4-3, tying the best mark in franchise history after seven
games.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Salmon Is Sixth in New Order</HD>

<LD>Last season, Angel Manager Mike Scioscia waited seven weeks before
dropping Tim Salmon in the lineup. This season, Scioscia waited one
week.</LD>
<LD>   Scioscia dropped Salmon from third to sixth in the batting order
Wednesday. In a lengthy meeting with Scioscia and hitting coach
Mickey Hatcher, Salmon was told that his swing is fine and that he
needs to relax.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe the psychological burden that a lot of people perceive
comes with the No. 3 spot can be taken off his shoulders for a little
bit," Scioscia said.</LD>
<TE>   For the first eight seasons of his career, Salmon's performance
was predictable and excellent--.290, 30 home runs, 90 runs batted in.
He hit .227 with 17 homers and 49 RBI last season, a poor season he
and the Angels attributed largely to injuries.</TE>
<TE>   In the first seven games of this season, he hit .125, with no home
runs and nine strikeouts in 24 at-bats. He is sound, and Scioscia
insists the bat speed that Salmon lost last season has returned.</TE>
<TE>   By dropping him in the order so soon, Scioscia might do more to
shatter Salmon's confidence rather than rebuild it, but the poor
offensive performance of the rest of the team convinced Scioscia he
could no longer afford to hit Salmon third.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to balance what Tim's confidence level is with what the
needs of the club are," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Hatcher: "This does not mean Tim is not going to hit third
for us any more.... I think he's going to be fine. I really do. We're
just trying to get him to relax."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon said he must fight a tendency to second- and third-guess
his at-bats. "I analyze every night. I've got to get to the point
where I quit analyzing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to get off to a good start. In the first week, it didn't
happen," he added. "Now we're playing Seattle and Oakland, and maybe
I am pressing a little bit. I'm trying to keep it in perspective.
It's a week into the year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Casey Kotchman, the Angels' top prospect and their
top draft pick last June, played in 11 games before a sprained wrist
ended his first pro season. He is fine this season, hitting .389 at
Class-A Cedar Rapids.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' Class-A Rancho Cucamonga affiliate will give out
Kotchman bobblehead dolls Aug. 23, regardless of whether Kotchman has
been promoted to the Quakes by then.</TE>
<TE>   "That's pretty funny," said Kotchman, 19. "It might be nice to
look at later on, but it's not going to help me perform."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitching coach Bud Black left the team after his mother, Helen,
died Tuesday night. She was 83. Black is expected to rejoin the team
Friday.... Outfielder Gary Johnson, the lone power-hitting prospect
at triple-A Salt Lake, has a torn rib cage muscle and is expected to
miss one month. Johnson hit .400 in spring training, with a .714
slugging percentage that trailed only Salmon and Troy Glaus.... The
hot rumor in Seattle is that Ken Griffey Jr., whose image
deteriorated from happy-go-lucky superstar in Seattle to selfish and
injury-plagued star in Cincinnati, would like to return to the
Mariners. If Griffey did return to Seattle, how would that affect the
balance of power in the AL West? "Wouldn't matter," one Angel said.
"He's always on the DL."</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Gentry Is Committed to Finishing Strong</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whatever prompted last week's grousing evidently has ended. The
Clippers have a new goal, winning their final four games and
finishing with the franchise's first winning record since the 1991-92
team won 45 games.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers are 38-40 with games remaining against Sacramento,
Minnesota, Memphis and Golden State. They already have won seven more
games than last season's team, which was 16 more than in 1999-2000.</LD>
<LD>   "We had a good practice, a lively practice," Coach Alvin Gentry
said Wednesday. "Our goal is still to have a winning season and we
have to win our last four games. We're going to play out the season.
We're still going to work on things. Our approach is not going to
change."</LD>
<TE>   In fact, the Clippers' approach did change for a while, with
center Michael Olowokandi talking pointedly about his lack of a
contract for next season and its impact on the team's play.</TE>
<TE>   After being fined $50,000 by the team for last week's comments,
Olowokandi has returned his attention to the court. Gentry believes
Olowokandi and the rest of the Clippers have returned their focus to
where it should be: playing and winning.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been great in the last few games," Gentry said. "We did
what we wanted to do in the Dallas game [last Thursday's 25-point
loss to the Mavericks]. We just didn't shoot well. We played great
defensively in the Denver game [Sunday's 22-point victory over the
Nuggets]. We played great in the Seattle game [Monday's two-point
loss to the SuperSonics].</TE>
<TE>   "We're back to competing and doing the right things."</TE>
<TE>   Of finishing the season with solid efforts in the final four
games, Gentry said: "It's important to everybody in the
franchise--the players and the coaching staff. We have tried to
establish to our fans that we play hard. We're going to do what's
right for as long as I'm here."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry admitted for the first time Wednesday that the loss of
forward Lamar Odom for all but 29 games this season because of
injuries and a drug suspension was a devastating blow to the
Clippers' playoff hopes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to have a guy like Lamar be out of the lineup like he
was," Gentry said. "He's one of the best players in the league. He's
our most versatile player. It really took away from our team."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry is looking forward to Odom's healthy return next season.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be like adding the No. 1 pick in the draft, in my
opinion," he said. "Other guys have been able to step up. Elton Brand
really established himself in the West. Michael [Olowokandi] really
improved his game. Adding Lamar to the mix gives us a pretty good
front line."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' average attendance has increased from 14,621 last
season to 17,880 this season, the league's third-highest jump. Only
Michael Jordan and the Washington Wizards and the Detroit Pistons
have had bigger increases.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Fast Roberts Off to Slow Start</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Dave Roberts knocked in a key insurance run in the seventh inning
with a bloop single to left field Tuesday night, but that wasn't the
swing the Dodger leadoff batter remembered most about that at-bat.
Just before delivering his hit, Roberts flailed at a shoulder-high
fastball from Giant pitcher Russ Ortiz.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't swing at balls like that," Roberts said Wednesday. "I
don't want to say I'm pressing, but that just shows I am. That's why
I'm getting to the park so early [1:30 p.m. for a 7:15 p.m. game].
I've got to get comfortable."</LD>
<LD>   Roberts was impressive in his Dodger debut, going two for four
with a double, two runs and a stolen base in a 9-2 loss to the Giants
on April 2, but in his next six games, Roberts had only two hits in
16 at-bats.</LD>
<TE>   He took a .200 average and a .273 on-base percentage into
Wednesday night's game against San Francisco and had drawn only two
walks, not the kind of production the Dodgers envisioned from the
leadoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Roberts hasn't been able to use his most valuable
asset--speed. After the season opener, Roberts didn't try to steal a
base in the next six games through Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Pitchers are going right after me," Roberts said. "I've noticed
I'm behind in a lot of counts because I'm trying to see pitches, but
in certain hitters' counts, I'm taking pitches when I should be
swinging. I've got to start turning the tables on them."</TE>
<TE>   Part of a leadoff batter's job is to work counts, to be patient,
to give his teammates a chance to see more pitches, but that strategy
can backfire when pitchers throw strikes, putting the hitter in a
hole.</TE>
<TE>   "They know the book on me, that I like to bunt and I like to take
pitches, so they're going right at me," Roberts said. "I've got to be
more conscious of them throwing the ball over the middle of the plate
and take advantage of it."</TE>
<TE>   He did in the first inning Wednesday night. Roberts took a strike,
and Giant pitcher Ryan Jensen came back with a fastball over the
middle. Roberts lined it to center for a single. Roberts stole
second, his first stolen base since the season opener, but was
doubled up when he took off for third on Brian Jordan's fly to left.
He had another single and stolen base and is hitting .250.</TE>
<TE>   "The cure is to be more aggressive in the strike zone," Roberts
said. "Obviously, the first pitch of the game, I'll be taking 99% of
the time, but from that point on, I've got to hit fastballs."</TE>
<TE>   With the Dodgers in the second day of a stretch in which they play
13 games without a day off, Manager Jim Tracy didn't start No. 3
hitter Paul Lo Duca, who entered the game late. Shawn Green, Jordan
and Eric Karros each moved up a spot in the order, but Adrian Beltre,
who entered with a .150 average, remained in the seventh spot while
No. 8 batter Mark Grudzielanek moved to sixth. ... Tom Goodwin and
Mike Trombley cleared waivers and are free agents.</TE>

<HD>Gagne Turning Heads, Hoping to Close the Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca shook his head and chuckled as the
veteran outfielder left the plate muttering in frustration after
facing Eric Gagne.</LD>
<LD>   The productive player struck out looking on three pitches against
the first-year closer who appears to be developing quickly in his new
high-pressure job. Lo Duca has already witnessed many confused looks
during Gagne's fast start, prompting the Dodgers to reevaluate their
closer-by-committee plan.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers didn't use Gagne in Wednesday's 2-1 loss to the Giants
at Pacific Bell Park, but they're confident he'll be ready when
needed.</LD>
<TE>   "He's throwing pellets and guys are turning around asking me,
'Where's this guy been?' Lo Duca said. "I tell them he's been here
starting for the last couple of years, but what we're seeing now is a
different Eric Gagne."</TE>
<TE>   That's what the Dodgers hoped for when they took an unconventional
turn and officially made Gagne the closer at the end of spring
training although he had no professional experience in the key role.
The 26-year-old right-hander was supposed to be eased in slowly,
sharing save opportunities with the rest of the new-look bullpen
while building confidence.</TE>
<TE>   But plans change, especially when eager young converted starters
are determined to prove themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne easily converted his two save chances, giving up only three
singles in his first five appearances spanning 52/3 innings. He has
continued to display the outstanding command that opened eyes in the
exhibition season, striking out eight without a walk.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne said he needs only about 20 pitches to get warmed up and has
not experienced arm stiffness. He adjusted his workout schedule to
help build endurance for more appearances throughout the season.</TE>
<TE>   A National League West scout who watched Gagne close Tuesday's 3-0
victory over the Giants raved about the movement on his 96-mph
fastball, sharpness of his changeup and improving curveball. The rest
of baseball is discovering what the Dodgers have known since early
this spring: Gagne is ready.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really matured and his confidence level is through the
roof," Lo Duca said. "He's throwing the ball harder and his pitches
are sharper than they've ever been.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that we're just getting going and he's never done this
before, but his stuff is as good as any closer in the game right now.
Really."</TE>
<TE>   Said first baseman Eric Karros: "As far as a closer by committee
is concerned, the committee seems to consist of Eric Gagne."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy is not willing to concede that. Well, at least
not completely.</TE>
<TE>   "Could it be going a little faster than we anticipated? Yes it
could be," Tracy said. "But are we ready to say definitively that
he's our closer, case closed? No, I'm not ready to say that. But I
will go as far as to say that he's definitely starting to show [good]
signs."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne's desire to succeed is high on the list.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be the one," he said. "They told me [it's a committee],
but they have to tell me that because I'm still young. They're trying
to help me relax, and that's good, but I feel confident about this."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Wallace, senior vice president, said last season Gagne "has
the make up of a closer" because of how he challenges batters.
However, starters are rarely converted to closers in the major
leagues.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers bucked conventional baseball wisdom with the risky
move, but so far so good. Then again, even Gagne acknowledges it's
too early for the Dodgers to get too excited.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never done it before and it's not something you learn
overnight," he said. "I'm going to go through some stuff, and I'm
going to give up some runs, but I'm going to stay mentally strong and
just come back and do it the next day."</TE>

<HD>Giguere Still Looks Up to Roy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere was 9 years old and growing
up in Canada, already fostering dreams of playing for an NHL team,
when he discovered who his idol would be.</LD>
<LD>   Giguere wanted it to be someone from the old Quebec Nordiques, his
favorite team as a youth, but they weren't competitive in the mid-to
late-1980s. So he became attached instead to a member of the rival
Montreal Canadiens, a hotshot with a quick glove named Patrick Roy.</LD>
<LD>   Giguere, 24, will be across the ice from his idol Friday when the
Ducks play Colorado, and although it won't be for the first time, it
still brings back memories of his childhood.</LD>
<TE>   "I still look up to him," Giguere said. "I was a Quebec fan and I
didn't want Montreal to win, but at the same time, [Roy] was the
best. He was special."</TE>
<TE>   When he was with Calgary in 1998, Giguere defeated Roy and
Colorado, but has yet to top him in three tries with the Ducks, going
0-1-2.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think he's the best goalie in the game, but when I play
against him I've got to focus on my game, not him," Giguere said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The injury news continued to be bad for the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Defensemen Keith Carney and Oleg Tverdovsky skated lightly in
practice Wednesday, but Murray doesn't expect them back for the
Colorado game.</TE>
<TE>   Carney is still recovering from a deep cut on his elbow and
Tverdovsky has been slowed by a strained groin.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't look very promising that either one is going to play,"
Murray said. "Oleg is skating, but it's hard for him to really do
everything he likes to do."</TE>

<HD>No Major Changes for Mickelson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the outside, it seems as if it would be easy to be Phil Mickelson.
Win 20 tournaments, great off the tee, terrific touch around the
greens, soft hands, big-time putter. And no major titles. Of course,
that's old news about Mickelson and he could change it all with a
good week at the Masters.</LD>
<LD>   It's not too late for Mickelson to alter his reputation as a
risk-taker who is so aggressive on the course that it eventually
costs him. He hurt himself last year at the Masters when he didn't
back off a little on the back nine and even acknowledged afterward he
probably should have.</LD>
<LD>   But Mickelson doesn't seem to be changing at all. On the last day
at Bay Hill, he tried to reach the green with a near-impossible shot
from underneath some trees but knocked it into the water. It wasn't
aggressive play but poor putting that cost him at the Players
Championship, where he five-putted a hole in the third round, and at
the BellSouth, where he drove a hole during the third round and wound
up four-putting.</LD>
<TE>   Whatever you choose to call it, Mickelson doesn't care. In fact,
after getting criticized for his Bay Hill gambit, he decided the best
way to answer questions about his approach is not to answer at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have anything more to add to it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson sounds a little testy these days because he thinks he
has been treated unjustly by reporters for a while now. That would be
since the PGA Championship, when he said he wasn't thinking about
winning only one major, but several.</TE>
<TE>   So it was no surprise what he said when someone asked him if any
part of his game was in disarray and how he would handle it at
Augusta National.</TE>
<TE>   Said Mickelson: "I guess I would just say no to your first part.
So that negates the second part."</TE>
<TE>   So there.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Mickelson is just getting his game face on for another run
at a green jacket. Maybe he doesn't like reporters anymore. Maybe
none of this matters anyway.</TE>
<TE>   It's interesting to note that Jack Nicklaus called Mickelson "a
good player." Is that it? Just a good player?</TE>
<TE>   "You become a great player when you win a major," Nicklaus said.</TE>
<TE>   Monty Update</TE>
<TE>   News item: Colin Montgomerie takes four swings on the practice tee
and then stops after tweaking his back.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: This is not good preparation.</TE>
<TE>   Shark Says</TE>
<TE>   Greg Norman says he doesn't think Mickelson needs to change
anything about the way he plays golf and reporters are making too big
a deal out of the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope he never changes," Norman said. "I think that's just being
under the microscope. People like to see that. They make a point of
making it a point. Phil Mickelson's nature is [his] nature. You can't
change that.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably would have won more majors if I wasn't that way, but I
would not be the same guy as I am right now. And Phil is the same
way. The risk-reward is there, and when it happens he's great, and
when it doesn't, he looks terrible.</TE>
<TE>   "Arnold [Palmer] could have won 20 [majors] if he wasn't so
aggressive, but Arnold was Arnold. So I hope Phil doesn't change.
He's going to win his share of tournaments and he's going to lose his
share of tournaments, and that's it."</TE>
<TE>   No Filibusters</TE>
<TE>   News item: Retired U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, a long-time member of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, has a new job at the Masters as a
media official.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: That's good training.</TE>
<TE>   She's No. 4</TE>
<TE>   In its most recent listing of the 10 most-hit searches on Google
(from March 25), Tiger Woods' girlfriend, Swedish model Elin
Nordegren, was No. 4, behind the Oscars, Halle Berry and Easter, but
ahead of Passover and best supporting actress winner Jennifer
Connelly.</TE>
<TE>   The Singer</TE>
<TE>   John Daly is what, a guitar-picking, long-ball-hitting golfer
Bubba? Hey, get down with it. Daly sings and plays guitar on a CD
that features tunes with such titles as "Where I Am Now," "I'm Drunk,
Damn, and I Don't Have a Penny to My Name," "My Life," "Got to Find
It" and "All My Ex's Wear Rolexes."</TE>
<TE>   Now you know. Consider yourself warned.</TE>
<TE>   More Changes?</TE>
<TE>   Masters Chairman Hootie Johnson says discussions are underway
about lengthening the 435-yard par-four fifth hole, perhaps as early
as next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Too easy," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   You Know Jack</TE>
<TE>   Here is the question and answer of the week, courtesy of Nicklaus.</TE>
<TE>   Question: In your day you were the Tiger Woods of the time ...</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus: "That's what they called me in those days, yeah, the
Tiger Woods of my time."</TE>
<TE>   He Said It</TE>
<TE>   The quote of the week is also from Nicklaus, when asked if the
longer, tougher course will discourage some of the former Masters
champions from competing in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Said Nicklaus: "If they have got any sense."</TE>
<TE>   History Lesson</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth, the last player to win the tournament the
week before the Masters and then win the Masters was Sandy Lyle in
1988.</TE>
<TE>   Lyle won Greensboro first.</TE>
<TE>   Bogey Man</TE>
<TE>   Davis Love III has a history of playing well in the Masters (two
seconds and two sevenths in a six-year span), but he isn't exactly
coming in flushed with success. He has missed five cuts in eight
full-field events.</TE>
<TE>   At the BellSouth, he had 11 birdies and still missed the cut by
three shots. Love also had a quadruple bogey, a triple bogey, two
double bogeys and three bogeys.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Update</TE>
<TE>   In 26 rounds at the Masters, Woods has played the par-three holes
in 10 over par, but he has played the par-five holes in a collective
56 under.</TE>
<TE>   Good Guy Award</TE>
<TE>   Nick Price won the inaugural ASAP Sports/Jim Murray Award for his
"cooperation, quotability and accommodation to the media."</TE>

<HD>Injury Ends Career of Val Royal, Winner of Breeders' Cup
Mile</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Mieszerski</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A tendon injury has ended the career of Val Royal, the winner of last
year's Breeders' Cup Mile.</LD>
<LD>   Trainer Julio Canani and owner David Milch made the decision after
a small lesion was discovered on the 6-year-old's right front leg. A
tendon injury located below where the new one surfaced had caused the
son of Royal Academy to be away for about 18 months after he had won
the 1999 Del Mar Derby in his first U.S. start.</LD>
<LD>   "You don't want to take any chances with a horse like him," Canani
said. "He was going to be retired at the end of this year anyway.
It's a big loss."</LD>
<TE>   Bred and raced in France before coming to this country after being
purchased privately, Val Royal finishes his career with seven
victories from 12 starts and earnings of $1,286,444.</TE>
<TE>   Two of his defeats came in his only two starts of 2002. He was
fourth as the favorite in the $300,000 Kilroe Mile on March 2, then
was fifth in the $2-million Dubai Duty Free in the United Arab
Emirates on March 23.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he might have [been injured] when he ran here," Canani
said. "It takes a while for something like this to show up."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Breeders' Cup Mile, which he won by nearly two lengths
over Forbidden Apple on Oct. 27 at Belmont Park, and the Del Mar
Derby, Val Royal's other stakes win in the U.S. came in the Oak Tree
Breeders' Cup Mile on Oct. 7. In his only other American race, he was
second to Road To Slew in the 2001 Kilroe Handicap.</TE>

<LD>Those wondering why jockey Kent Desormeaux has been absent from the
entries at Santa Anita should look east.</LD>
<LD>   Second to Alex Solis in the standings as Santa Anita winds down,
Desormeaux had mounts at Keeneland Wednesday and today, then will
ride in New York this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Desormeaux is on four horses today, including two for trainer
Bobby Frankel. His first mount is Tempestuous Wind, a 3-year-old son
of Danzig trained by John Kimmel and second at 14-1 in his first
start last month at Gulfstream Park. Tempestuous Wind breaks from
post 11 going seven furlongs in the fourth.</LD>
<TE>   He will then ride Beefeater Baby for Frankel in the sixth, a
nine-furlong allowance race for fillies and mares on the turf, and
Tates Creek for the trainer in the $100,000-added Jenny Wiley at
11/16 miles on the grass. Desormeaux will conclude his day on
Sharbayan, who will make his second U.S. start for Wally Dollase in
the ninth, a nine-furlong contest on grass.</TE>
<TE>   The filly to beat in the Wiley, a Grade III, is Snow Dance.
Trained by John Ward for owner John Oxley, she has won six of eight
on the turf. Most recently, she won the Suwanee River, another Grade
III, on March 3 at Gulfstream Park. She will again be ridden by Pat
Day.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The fifth at Santa Anita, a contentious sprint on
the hillside turf course, is the third leg of a pick six that has a
carryover of almost $115,000.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Victor Espinoza. The jockey won three times Wednesday,
including a 15-1 surprise on Continental Miss.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Michael Gass. The trainer, now based at Oaklawn Park,
is two for 48 this year.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Instant Karma, A Lil
Sweet, King La Boo and Tender Lovin Jones in the sixth, Eyes Wide
Open, Raypour and Justice Minister in the seventh and singling Rather
Be Wild in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/211. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $12.60/$1,227. Total money bet: $1,306.</TE>

<HD>One Point Will Secure Spot in Playoffs</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada</DL>
<LD>With three games in three cities over the next four days, the Kings
have not yet found their way into the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   But they're wiping their feet on the mat, reaching for the door.</LD>
<LD>   The helping hand they needed to clinch a playoff berth while they
were idle the last two nights never materialized, so if they want to
nail down a spot before midnight tonight, they'll have to do it
themselves.</LD>
<TE>   A victory, tie or overtime loss against the Vancouver Canucks at
General Motors Place will end the suspense, but the high-scoring
Canucks are the league's hottest team, with only two losses in their
last 14 games.</TE>
<TE>   Mathematically, the Kings still could finish anywhere from second
in the Western Conference, which would require at least five points
in their last three games, to ninth, which would require a total
collapse.</TE>
<TE>   In the tightly bunched Western Conference race, seven points
separate the San Jose Sharks, who stand second in the West after a
5-3 victory Wednesday night over the Columbus Blue Jackets, from the
Canucks and Edmonton Oilers, tied for eighth after the Oilers' 3-0
victory over the Phoenix Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   With 93 points, the Kings are four behind the Sharks in the race
for the Pacific Division championship, which would bring with it no
lower than a No. 3 playoff seeding and home-ice advantage for at
least the first round.</TE>
<TE>   The teams play Saturday at San Jose in the Sharks' season finale,
by which time the Sharks could have sewn up the division title with a
victory tonight over the St. Louis Blues, before the Kings wrap up
their schedule Sunday against the Mighty Ducks at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, fifth in the West, also are only three points ahead of
the Oilers and Canucks in the battle for the conference's final
playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   With one more point, the Kings could finish no worse than tied
with the Oilers, who would lose out in a tiebreaker because the Kings
won the season series.</TE>
<TE>   After Monday night's 3-0 victory over the Dallas Stars, the Kings
could have clinched a playoff berth Tuesday night if the Canucks had
lost in regulation to the Colorado Avalanche, but the Canucks won,
2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, a loss or tie by the Oilers on Wednesday night would
have guaranteed the Kings a playoff spot, but the Oilers got a
shutout from Tommy Salo.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't expect any different," King Coach Andy Murray said late
Wednesday night. "We always anticipate that these other teams are
going to win. You have to do it yourself. We want to win [tonight]
and take care of our own business....</TE>
<TE>   "It's not easy, but nothing has come easy to us. We've had to go
out and earn it every single night. It'll be a battle, but we expect
to get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Adam Mair, who had not dressed for five of the Kings' last six
games, was loaned to the club's American Hockey League team at
Manchester, N.H. The 22-year-old forward had one goal and one assist
in 18 games with the Kings.</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Canucks are 11-2-1 since March 10 and unbeaten in
their last seven games, among them a 4-0 victory over the Kings on
March 26 at Vancouver and a 4-4 tie April 2 at Staples Center in
which they overcame a two-goal deficit in the last 21/2 minutes.
Goaltender Dan Cloutier is 10-2-1 during the surge.</TE>

<HD>O'Neal Is Absent as Bryant Muses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal did not attend practice Wednesday, the day after his
two-technical ejection against the Utah Jazz. He called in sick with
what a club official called "a migraine or something."</LD>
<LD>   Already bothered by an arthritic toe and a sprained wrist that,
based on his shooting, seems to be healing, O'Neal doesn't practice
much anyway, so he probably wasn't missed.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Phil Jackson took a day away from the media, possibly for
mental health purposes, but for sure to continue his post-All-Star
break meetings with each player. Wednesday was power forward Samaki
Walker's turn, and he dashed from practice with full apologies.</LD>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant also did not practice, which is typical for him late
in the season, even when relatively healthy. He has played 650 more
minutes than the next-closest Laker--O'Neal--and going on 200 minutes
more than in any of his previous five seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I got off my feet," Bryant said. "I'm going into the playoffs
healthy. Gearing up, you know what I mean? I feel good. [Tuesday]
night my legs felt great."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant looked positively 23, both in age and jersey number,
against the Jazz, particularly in a handful of possessions in the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   It seems that Bryant, who is 23, and Brian Shaw, who was that age
13 years ago, have made a running joke of Bryant's legs.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Brian, 'I save a lot of my jumping ability,'" he said.
"You guys don't see me out there jumping and doing all that crazy
stuff. [Tuesday] night was the first time I'd done it in a long time.
I save my legs for seasons down the line. I'm not going to go out and
jump myself crazy right now. I'm going to conserve my energy,
conserve my legs, build my legs. Now, when I get 27, 28, then I'll
start doing something crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Shaw knew 23. He reached 27. His legs hadn't gained anything.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him," Shaw said, laughing, "it doesn't work like that."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers will raise two banners honoring their past in a
halftime ceremony tonight, when they play the Minnesota Timberwolves.</TE>
<TE>   The banners will commemorate the five NBA titles won by the
Minneapolis Lakers and their players. George Mikan, Vern Mikkelsen,
Slater Martin, Clyde Lovellette, coach John Kundla and Arilee
Pollard, the wife of the late Jim Pollard, will be in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Former Lakers Magic Johnson, Jerry West, James Worthy, Elgin
Baylor and Michael Cooper will present the players with championship
rings.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Lakers will wear replicas of the old Minneapolis Laker
road uniforms, light blue with gold lettering--MPLS--across the
chest.</TE>
<TE>   Given their two most recent games against Minnesota--Target Center
losses of 120-102 and 112-101--the Lakers would seem to have
something to prove against the Timberwolves, particularly on defense.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a high-energy team at home," Derek Fisher said. "There
are a lot of teams in the league like that. Like we said then, until
they can come here and show us that same type of toughness and energy

<LD>The hottest horse in action tonight at Los Alamitos is Hallelujah
Train.</LD>
<LD>   A 4-year-old gelding owned and trained by Jaime Gomez, Hallelujah
Train has won three in a row and will step up in class again to take
on $50,000 claimers at 300 yards in the seventh of eight races.</LD>
<LD>   After losing 19 of his first 21 races, the Texas-bred started his
streak with a nose victory Jan. 19, won by a half-length Feb. 8, then
prevailed by a neck March 10.</LD>
<TE>   All three victories have come since Alex Bautista started riding
Hallelujah Train and he will be aboard again this evening.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the program, Gomez will unveil Coup Of Corona, a
promising 2-year-old filly by Corona Cartel out of the Coup De Kas
mare Lethal Coup.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Celina and Corina Molina, the Oklahoma-bred has impressed
in her drills and she will break from post four--in a field of
seven--in tonight's second at 300 yards. Her rider will be Bautista.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Frog. 2. Coup Of Corona. 3. Ashren. 4. Masquerade
Bawl. 5. Night Lines. 6. Icey Gambler. 7. Hallelujah Train. 8.
Vallarta Royal.</TE>
<TE>   Four! In the fifth, let's use Night Lines, Shes A Royal Scat and
Lost In Traffic, single Icey Gambler in the sixth, use Cool Brown
Dasher and Hallelujah Train in the seventh and the entry of A Dash Of
Romance and Vallarta Royal, Harley May and Stuff It Jazz in the
eighth. Total cost: $18.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Danbrook gets a jockey upgrade to Bautista as
he seeks his third lifetime win in the first and East Vali is a
thoroughbred debuting against a weak field of maidens in an 870-yard
contest in the fourth with a hot jockey (Ramon Guce) aboard.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The playoff berth that appeared to be slipping away for the Indiana
Pacers is once again within reach.</LD>
<LD>   Jermaine O'Neal scored 29 points and grabbed 15 rebounds and Brad
Miller added 23 points and 11 rebounds at Indianapolis as the Pacers
beat Toronto, 98-82, Wednesday night, snapping the Raptors' nine-game
winning streak.</LD>
<LD>   The Pacers moved one game behind the Raptors and Milwaukee for the
eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Pacers
play host to the Bucks on Friday. Milwaukee has won all three games
against Indiana this season, clinching the tiebreaker.</LD>
<TE>   Indiana also would lose a tiebreaker with the Raptors by virtue of
its 1-3 record vs. Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Reggie [Miller] before the game we've got to find a way to
win this," O'Neal said. "We had to play the best basketball of our
careers. I wasn't going to let my team lose it.</TE>
<TE>   "The playoffs are within reach and now they're ours for the
taking. The door is opening up again. This was a big win, but it's
over. Milwaukee is a bigger game than this. We win that, and the door
is wide open."</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Davis had 24 points for the Raptors, who cut a 21-point
deficit to three early in the third quarter but could get no closer.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 118, Golden State 116--Chris Webber had 31 points and
12 rebounds at Oakland as the Kings clinched at least a tie for the
NBA's best record with their 10th consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   With one more victory or one loss by the Lakers and the Dallas
Mavericks, the Kings will clinch the franchise's first division title
since the Kansas City Kings' Midwest Division crown in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Antawn Jamison had 20 points for Golden State.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 106, Milwaukee 81--The Bucks' road losing streak reached
10 games as Wesley Person scored 23 points to lead the Cavaliers to
victory at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee lost for the 14th time in 18 games overall. Two months
ago, the Bucks led the Central Division, but are now in danger of
missing the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Bucks are tied with Toronto for the eight-best record in the
Eastern Conference. Milwaukee's next three games are against Indiana,
Charlotte and Toronto--all battling the Bucks for a playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the Bucks' problems, starting guard Sam Cassell did not
play in the second half because of a sprained left big toe.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Robinson led Milwaukee with 21 points.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 70, Miami 65--Antoine Walker's three-pointer tied the score
and his baby hook gave the Celtics the lead for good at Boston as
they clinched home-court advantage in the first round of the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   With the loss, Miami was eliminated from playoff contention--the
first quiet postseason in Coach Pat Riley's 20-year career.</TE>
<TE>   It was the lowest-scoring game in the NBA this season. Boston
scored only 12 points in the third quarter and Miami had only nine in
the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Walker led Boston with 21 points. Alonzo Mourning and Eddie Jones
each had 16 points for the Heat.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 101, Charlotte 95--Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 33 points to
help the Hawks prevent the Hornets from clinching a playoff spot at
Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte, tied with Philadelphia for fifth in the Eastern
Conference, is still chasing Orlando for the fourth spot and
home-court advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Jamal Mashburn led Charlotte with 26 points.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 102, Detroit 101--Jalen Rose scored 24 points and rookie
Tyson Chandler added a career-best 21 points and 12 rebounds to help
the Bulls upset the Pistons at Auburn Hills, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was Chicago's first against the Central Division
champions since Jan. 22, 2000, ending an eight-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Robinson had 27 points for Detroit, which led by 16 points
in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 90, Philadelphia 77--Michael Jordan, sidelined for the
season by a knee injury, sat on the bench for the first time since
being injured and watched his Wizards hold off the visiting 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   Washington blew a 17-point halftime lead before closing the game
with a 13-0 run over the last three minutes. Richard Hamilton scored
21 points as the Wizards stayed mathematically alive for the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Snow had a career-high 26 points for the 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 87, Denver 79--Tim Duncan had 16 points and 11
rebounds, ending his streak of 24 consecutive games with at least 20
points, as the Spurs won at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio won its fifth consecutive game overall and its 12th in
a row at home.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another giant step in auto racing safety appears imminent. A new
"soft wall" system, which dissipates crash energy before it reaches
drivers' bodies, should be in place for next month's Indianapolis 500
and may soon be adopted by NASCAR.</LD>
<LD>   "If we go forward with it, it's going to be one of the most
revolutionary safety aspects in modern racing," Brian Barnhardt, the
Indy Racing League's chief technical officer, said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   While NASCAR hasn't taken the last step, NASCAR vice president Jim
Hunter said that all the tracks "are aware of this technology" and
"are receptive to it."</LD>
<TE>   Two more crash tests on the new system will be conducted by the
end of April.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well with the walls at the Indy 500, they will be left
in place for the August NASCAR race there, the Brickyard 400.</TE>

<TE>   Kareem Rush, Missouri's second-leading career scorer who helped
the Tigers reach the NCAA regional finals this year, will skip his

<TE>   Rush, who averaged 19.8 points this season, hasn't hired an agent,
a move that would prohibit his return to Missouri under NCAA rules.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Crean, who guided Marquette into the NCAA tournament for the

Josh Pastner, who came to Arizona as a non-scholarship player because
he wanted to be a basketball coach, was promoted to assistant by
Coach Lute Olson.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore guard Adam Boone will transfer from North Carolina after
the spring semester.... Dustin Brown, a 6-foot-7 forward from the Bay
Area, signed a national letter of intent with Loyola Marymount. Brown
played in high school at San Rafael but spent this past season at St.
Thomas More Academy in Connecticut where he averaged 14 points and
seven rebounds.... Tennessee basketball players April McDivitt and
Michelle Munoz, daughter of NFL Hall of Famer Anthony Munoz, plan to
transfer at the end of the semester.</TE>

<HD>Sharks Overtake Avalanche in West</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Jose Sharks became only the second team in NHL history to
improve its point total for six consecutive seasons.</LD>
<LD>   But Shark captain Owen Nolan wasn't all that impressed after
Wednesday night's 5-3 victory over the Blue Jackets at Columbus,
Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   "I guess that's a good milestone for the regular season, but we've
got our sights set on the playoffs," Nolan said after scoring two
goals and adding an assist. "It's sort of like winning the
Presidents' Trophy (for best regular-season record) and then getting
beat in the first round of the playoffs."</LD>
<TE>   The Sharks, who moved into second place in the Western Conference
over the idle Colorado Avalanche, matched the achievement by the New
York Islanders from 1973-79.</TE>
<TE>   Nolan scored the first two goals and assisted on the third as the
Sharks built a 3-0 lead on their way to their fifth win in six games.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 3, Phoenix 0--Mike Comrie and Daniel Cleary scored
third-period goals a minute apart, leading the Oilers to a critical
victory at Edmonton, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Salo stopped 23 shots for his sixth shutout of the season
and 30th career.</TE>
<TE>   The Oilers and Vancouver Canucks are tied with 90 points for the
eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. Edmonton and
Vancouver trail Phoenix by one point, and all three teams have two
games remain- ing.</TE>
<TE>   Cleary scored his 10th goal 6:23 into the third when he jammed in
a rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, Dallas 4--Jim Dowd and Andrew Brunette scored 21
seconds apart midway through the third period as the Wild fought back
from three goals down to tie the Stars at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   The point gives Dallas 87 with two games left. The Stars would
have to win both and hope for losses from Vancouver and Edmonton in
their final two games for any chance to extend their streak of
consecutive postseason appearances to seven.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 3, Detroit 3--Darren McCarty's 100th career goal helped
the Red Wings overcome a two-goal, third-period deficit at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The point enabled the Blackhawks (40-26-13-1) to clinch their
first playoff berth since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 1, Philadelphia 0--Martin Brodeur stopped 22 shots, and
John Madden scored with 10:42 to play to give the Devils a victory at
East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the fourth in a row and ninth in 12 games for the
Devils, and it also prevented the Flyers from clinching the Atlantic
Division title.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 7, New York Rangers 2--Darcy Tucker and Cory Cross each
scored two goals as the Maple Leafs clinched the fourth seed in the
Eastern Conference playoffs at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 4, Tampa Bay 2--Ron Francis and Rod Brind'Amour scored
first-period goals at Raleigh, N.C., as the Hurricanes beat the
Lightning to win the Southeast Division title for the second time in
four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 4, Atlanta 4--The Panthers' Pierre Dagenais scored the
game's final goal with 4:26 remaining at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo 4, Pittsburgh 4-- Miroslav Satan scored twice and host
Buffalo squandered a pair of two-goal leads, but still ran
Pittsburgh's winless streak to eight with a tie.</TE>

<HD>England's Beckham Breaks Bone in Foot</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Midfielder, known for passing and free kicks, could
miss World Cup after being hurt by hard tackle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Beckham, the player with the pop-star lifestyle who England was
counting on to lead it to World Cup glory this summer, suffered a
broken bone in his left foot Wednesday and likely will miss soccer's
quadrennial world championship.</LD>
<LD>   The injury, which will sideline the midfielder for six to eight
weeks, occurred while Beckham was playing for Manchester United in
its 3-2 European Champions League quarterfinal victory over Deportivo
La Coruna of Spain.</LD>
<LD>   Beckham was felled by a hard tackle by Deportivo's Aldo Duscher 16
minutes into the match at Old Trafford in Manchester and left the
field limping. He was immediately taken to a hospital, where X-rays
revealed the break.</LD>
<TE>   "He is doubtful for the World Cup," said Sir Alex Ferguson,
Manchester United's coach. "It was a bad tackle, but games of
football are about tackles and the player had to go for it."</TE>
<TE>   Duscher is from Argentina, which plays England in a crucial "group
of death" game in Sapporo, Japan on June 7, but there was no
suggestion that his tackle was anything but clumsy.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not single out Beckham for any special treatment,"
Deportivo Coach Javier Irureta said. "I'm sorry for what has happened
and hope he recovers quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Beckham's lifestyle as much as his playing ability have made him a
favorite subject of the British press, which reports as much on the
off-field activities of the England captain and his wife, former
Spice Girl Victoria "Posh" Spice, as it does on his soccer exploits.
Their home is jokingly known as Beckingham Palace.</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, Beckham is the heir to another Manchester United
legend of old, George Best.</TE>
<TE>   But while Best never played in the World Cup, Beckham, 26, saw the
tournament as his chance to shine on the world stage. Now, it appears
he will miss the opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Referee Markus Merk of Germany did not caution Duscher for the
tackle, but the midfielder did get two yellow cards later in the game
and was ejected.</TE>
<TE>   Injuries such as Beckham's normally take at least six weeks to
heal.</TE>
<TE>   England's first World Cup game is against Sweden on June 2, less
than eight weeks away.</TE>
<TE>   It plays Argentina five days later in a rematch of the famous game
during the France '98 World Cup in which Beckham was ejected for
retaliating to a foul by Argentina's Diego Simeone.</TE>
<TE>   Without Beckham, England played with 10 men for 70 minutes and
held on for a memorable 2-2 tie.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible that Sven Goran Ericksson, England's Swedish coach,
will still select Beckham to his World Cup roster when the May 21
deadline arrives, hoping that he will be fit for the knockout stage,
should England get past Sweden, Argentina and Nigeria in the first
round.</TE>
<TE>   But the three early games, always a test, now will be that much
more difficult for England.</TE>
<TE>   Beckham is renowned for his passing skill and is widely regarded
as the best free-kick specialist in the world.</TE>
<TE>   His inspirational play led England to its 5-1 demolition of
Germany in World Cup qualifying last year and his last-minute goal
off a free kick against Greece clinched England's World Cup place.</TE>

for Mikan-Led Title Teams</DH>

<LD>The lane was thinner in 1948 when George Mikan joined the Minneapolis
Lakers, and no one called it "the paint."</LD>
<LD>   It was six feet across, instead of the current 16, crowned on top
by the free-throw circle and called "the key," a term that has since
faded into the mists.</LD>
<LD>   Players didn't dunk--it was considered showing off--or go between
their legs on the dribble, or cross-over. They'd have to start using
their left hands before they could think of crossing over.</LD>
<TE>   They had begun jumping off both legs to shoot, but it wasn't
called a "jumper," much less a "J." Rather than the all-purpose
weapon it is now, the "jump shot" was just part of repertoires that
included the hook (the old rolling variety, jump hooks being decades
away), the running one-hander and that old stand-by, the set shot,
which could be one-handed, or, for purists, two-handed. Free throws
often were taken underhanded.</TE>
<TE>   The national TV schedule was limited, as in nonexistent. There
wouldn't be any until 1953, when the Dumont Network (another goner)
ponied up $39,000 for a 13-game package, then dropped the NBA after
one season.</TE>
<TE>   Players didn't do TV commercials for sneakers, sports drinks,
hamburgers or anything, much less rap CDs, there being no rap or CDs.
There wasn't even any rock 'n' roll yet. Elvis was 13.</TE>
<TE>   There were no basketball "superstars," another word that didn't
exist. Celebrity was a lot to hope for, until the Lakers arrived in
New York to see their game billed on the marquee of (the old) Madison
Square Garden as:</TE>
<TE>   WED BASKETBALL</TE>
<TE>   GEO MIKAN VS. KNICKS</TE>
<TE>   However, it wasn't because Mikan embodied that young/hot look
that's in favor today.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Pollard, a 6-5 forward who was the Laker star, remembers
Mikan, who'd been the main attraction of a rival league, first
walking into their dressing room before a game in Sheboygan, Wis.,
which was then a league city, or village, and introducing himself.</TE>
<TE>   Happily, he was 6 foot 10, or they might have thought he was the
new trainer.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that was the biggest-looking dumb character that I'd
ever seen for a guy that was barely 23 years old," Pollard said
later. "He had these great big thick glasses and he had this homburg
hat on."</TE>
<TE>   The lenses in Mikan's glasses, secured during games by an elastic
band, were said to be a quarter-inch thick. He was anything but a
prodigy, having been cut by his high school team in Joliet, Ill.
Amazing as it sounds now, basketball was considered a small man's
game of cutting and passing. Coaches didn't wait on big guys who were
always so far behind developmentally.</TE>
<TE>   That was until DePaul Coach Ray Meyer made Mikan the first great
project, improving his mobility painstakingly, with dance lessons and
shadow boxing, then turning him loose onto a world that suddenly
couldn't match up.</TE>
<TE>   An apt and enthusiastic student, Mikan became the Shaquille O'Neal
of his day, a hulking, broad-shouldered 260-pounder among the
Lilliputians, able to hook with either hand, dominating by whatever
means necessary.</TE>
<TE>   That tucked-elbow spin O'Neal kept laying out Dikembe Mutombo with
last spring? That was Mikan's basic move into the lane.</TE>
<TE>   "He just had his way in those days," former Boston Celtic great
Bob Cousy said. "The Lakers ran no transition. It wasn't unlike what
the Sixers did with Wilt [Chamberlain] after a while.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lakers simply waited for Big George to get down the floor and
then the offense started with him getting it. They'd run some splits
and things, but basically, he would just overpower you.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't clumsy. I say awkward and plodding and I suppose that
implies clumsy, but he wasn't clumsy. But he wasn't agile either. It
was somewhere in between that. He simply was able to go where he
chose to go."</TE>
<TE>   This was no dinosaur. This was the first big NBA center to walk
erect.</TE>
<TE>   In the days when they celebrated high-scoring "point-a-minute"
teams, Mikan began tabbing big numbers, winning five scoring titles
in a row, averaging 23 points--before they put in the 24-second
clock--turning it up in the biggest games ... averaging 30 in the '49
playoffs ... getting 40 in Game 6 when the Lakers clinched the title
in '50.</TE>
<TE>   Before him, NBA centers ran about 6-8, 220, like Boston's "Easy"
Ed Macauley, who was OK the rest of the time but an endangered
sub-species when the Lakers were in town.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd walk through train stations," Cousy said, "and he would walk
by one of these huge columns. Macauley had a wry sense of humor and
would bump into the column and say, 'Oh, excuse me, George.'</TE>
<TE>   "To Macauley, trying to guard him in the pivot, that's what it
seemed like, trying to guard one of these huge columns. Mikan was
unmovable. He was so much stronger than anyone in the league at that
time."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his gentlemanly, "square" ('50s term, also yet to come
into favor) manner, Mikan was anything but shy, demanding the ball
and letting people know about it when he didn't get it.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a rookie from Tennessee named Lefty Walther," longtime
big man's guru Pete Newell said. "The kid was a real good player.
They're playing a game and Mikan is in the post and the guy drives
right by Mikan, goes in for a layup. Mikan's got his hand up for the
ball, he's the top dog. He gets mad and yells at him.</TE>
<TE>   "The next time the kid gets the ball, he drives and his man and
Mikan's man go up to block the shot. The third time he drives, his
guy, Mikan's man and Mikan all go after the shot.</TE>
<TE>   "Mikan's thing was, 'They're paying you $5,000 to play out there
and they're paying me whatever to play in there, so when I ask for
the ball, darn it, give it to me!'</TE>
<TE>   "The kid was gone in a few games."</TE>
<TE>   In the ultimate compliment accorded to the greatest
revolutionaries, Mikan and Wilt, the rules were changed to deal with
them. The NBA widened its lane for the first time for Mikan. The NCAA
rewrote its defensive goaltending rules, fearing otherwise Mikan
would just bat everything away.</TE>
<TE>   Now it seems like a long, long time ago in a Midwestern town far,
far away, but without Mikan, Pollard, Slater Martin, Clyde
Lovellette, Vern Mikkelsen and Coach John Kundla--all Laker Hall of
Famers whose names will be raised on a banner in Staples Center
tonight--without the generation that rode trains, had jobs in the
off-season and played for peanuts because they loved the game so
much, there'd be no modern NBA with its jaded, $100-million pop
icons.</TE>
<TE>   Appropriately, today's Lakers are taking a moment tonight to honor
so distinguished a heritage and the men who established it. Not that
sentiment and appreciation entirely explain why they finally got
around to it.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally or not, the same retro "MPLS" jerseys the Lakers
wear tonight are available for $69.99, at the NBA Store on NBA.com,
the NBA Store on Fifth Avenue in New York, NIKETOWN, Staples Center,
Champs, East Bay and Fanzz, emblazoned with Shaq's No. 34 or Kobe
Bryant's No. 8 (but not Mikan's No. 99).</TE>
<TE>   A banner commemorating the five Minneapolis titles will be raised
too, which will be great for the Lakers. As far as banners go, they
will have just closed the Celtics' lead to 16-13.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the motivation, it's about time. Thanks for the memories
and for the game.</TE>

<HD>Members Seek Funding to Save 2 Jewish Centers</HD>

<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To keep Jewish community centers open in Granada Hills and Silver
Lake, members are looking at ways to independently fund them.</LD>
<LD>   Jewish Community Centers of Greater Los Angeles, which operates
seven facilities in the region, announced in December that five
centers were in danger of being closed for lack of money.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, centers in Sherman Oaks and West Los Angeles have
resolved their problems and are expected to stay open, said David
Novak, a spokesman for the organization.</LD>
<TE>   In a letter dated Friday, the Jewish Federation expressed a desire
to continue operating the Silver Lake facility for a year and the
West Valley center in West Hills indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Prizant, the federation's senior vice president of
communications, confirmed that funding is likely to be available to
the Silver Lake center for one year.</TE>
<TE>   Janie Schulman, who spearheaded the effort to save the Silver Lake
center, said the news is "welcome relief." Its members will discuss
ways to continue when the year is up, she said.</TE>
<TE>   At the North Valley center in Granada Hills--due to be closed in
June--a committee formed to save the operation is considering
purchasing the land from Jewish Community Centers, Chairwoman Andrea
Goodstein said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, North Valley members will vote on whether to pursue an
effort to fund the center independently. Another option, Goodstein
said, is to find property elsewhere in the north Valley area to build
a Jewish center. "There will be a JCC in north Valley," she said.
"There has to be. There are enough people who want one."</TE>
<TE>   The 12-member North Valley committee has been disappointed in the
JCC's efforts to save the Granada Hills center, Goodstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Selling the property "is what they feel they need to do to
survive," she said. "But don't you think that looking for a solution
is a better way than to just shut it down?"</TE>
<TE>   Jewish Community Centers is working to continue services at
Sherman Oaks and West Hills facilities, which are financially viable,
Novak said. "That's not the case for North Valley, unfortunately."
Only nine students signed up for next year at the center.</TE>

<LD>Working her way through school? David Chan of L.A. sent along this
"crime report" from UCLA's Daily Bruin newspaper: "A woman wearing a
business suit solicited sex from a passerby on Bruin Walk near
Kerckhoff Hall."</LD>
<LD>   More jolts: If that item isn't enough to perk you up, Chan points
out you could almost get a caffeine high from the newspaper's police
log, which lately has reported a "suspicious package" on a bus that
turned out to be a coffeemaker, "a bag with a powdery substance" in a
cafe that turned out to be Coffee Mate and a bee nest near the Coffee
Bean restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   While across town...: USC's Daily Trojan said authorities
responded to a report of a fourth-floor fire at Harris Hall only to
find nothing more than "burnt socks left in the hallway." Don't tell
me college kids are back to smoking weird stuff.</LD>
<TE>   Marquee madness (cont): In what has apparently become a daily
component of this column, Phil Proctor of Beverly Hills contributed
another twin bill featuring a current Sissy Spacek movie (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   For another view: In Santa Monica, writer Hank Rosenfeld saw this
variation: WHEN WE WERE SOLDIERS/IN THE BEDROOM.</TE>
<TE>   Stories that were all wet: I mentioned that the April Fool's issue
of the Reef Seekers Dive Co. newsletter talked about filling Dodger
Stadium with water for a scuba-diving event. That didn't panic the
populace. But Ken Kurtis of that Beverly Hills company said numerous
people were alarmed about the publication's lead article: the
decision to have all international flights in this area take off and
land from Catalina's airport in order to provide increased security.</TE>
<TE>   "People called to say how this was going to inconvenience them and
make them think twice about flying out of the country," Kurtis said.
Especially the part about passengers being transported from LAX to
the island via an old fleet of bankrupt cruise ships.</TE>
<TE>   Food for thought: Nora Hunter of Whittier served up a soft-drink
ad from a newspaper that included one variety "for those who are
really, really vengeful" (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Stupid criminal tricks: A man in a trench coat stuffed several
digital video discs into his clothing and tried to run from a store
that was about to close. But employees, who were observing, had
locked the door, the Long Beach Press-Telegram said. The thwarted
thief emptied his pockets of 20 discs.</TE>
<TE>   "Duh!" award winner? I spotted today's warning to drivers in Long
Beach (see photo). Then again, this being Southern California, maybe
it does come as news to some motorists.</TE>
<TE>   And, finally: Psychotherapist Dennis Marsella was upset that I
wrote about him running in the L.A. Marathon while wearing a trench
coat. "I ran in a HEAVY WINTER COAT," he wrote. "I also carried a
pizza in a box, topped by a water bottle, waiter-style." I hope
someone tipped the guy.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: In a survey of houses of worship in 200 cities, the
Ladies' Home Journal found Irvine to have the fewest in Southern
California. And only five cities in the nation had fewer.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's unofficial slogan, you may recall, is "Another Day in
Paradise."</TE>
<TE>   As any religious person could tell you, one definition of
paradise, of course, is heaven.</TE>

Los Angeles City Council met Wednesday in a Canoga Park theater to
debate one of the hot-button issues in the San Fernando Valley:
Ahmanson Ranch.</LD>
<LD>   The council was weighing its response to Ventura County's latest
environmental analysis of Ahmanson Ranch, a 2,800-acre suburb planned
for the hills north of Calabasas.</LD>
<LD>   An overflow crowd packed the Madrid Theatre and spilled onto the
sidewalk during debate. Some wore anti-Ahmanson T-shirts, while
others wore "Build It" stickers on their shirts.</LD>
<TE>   For opponents, the report's lack of current statistics on traffic
was the key. For supporters, the need for housing was paramount.</TE>
<TE>   In a rare appearance before the City Council that he sat on for
nearly 20 years, Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky urged
the panel to demand a new traffic study for the project, even if it
means going to court.</TE>
<TE>   "If you went to a doctor complaining of a pain in your chest
today, and you handed him a chest X-ray from 1992," Yaroslavsky said,
"and he looked at the X-ray and looked at your chest and said,
'You're fine,' you'd have a cause of action against that doctor."</TE>
<TE>   But Steve Weston, an attorney for developer Washington Mutual,
countered that the project had been thoroughly studied and the
traffic studies approved by transportation experts.</TE>
<TE>   "The traffic studies reasonably forecast and properly mitigate
traffic impacts," Weston said.</TE>
<TE>   Several business leaders also spoke in favor of Ahmanson Ranch,
calling it an essential housing component.</TE>
<TE>   Skip Cooper, president of the Black Business Assn., said the
project was "an important step toward addressing a housing shortage
that is affecting all our communities."</TE>
<TE>   Critics were equally outspoken.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Parks, a Thousand Oaks council member who was recently
elected to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, urged the public
to pressure Washington Mutual to sell the land.</TE>
<TE>   "There are sufficient funds out there to purchase Ahmanson Ranch
for parkland," Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Councilman Dennis Zine, smiling at the huge crowd:
"Obviously, there is not an apathetic feeling here in the San
Fernando Valley, as some people think."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County and Los Angeles officials are sparring over the
development that would bring 3,050 homes, 400,000 square feet of
commercial and office space, golf courses and a resort hotel to the
eastern edge of Ventura County, overlooking the West Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The $2-billion development by Washington Mutual, the nation's
largest savings and loan, also has sparked an extraordinary counter
campaign by Hollywood celebrities such as Rob Reiner and Martin
Sheen.</TE>
<TE>   The area already is one of the city's fastest-growing spots, with
population in the 3rd Council District jumping 11.4% in the last
decade, according to census figures.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County approved the project, which has yet to break
ground, 10 years ago. The county commissioned a supplemental
environmental impact report after two rare species were found at the
site.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the new report dealt with the San Fernando Valley
spineflower and red-legged frogs discovered three years ago at
Ahmanson Ranch. Building the development would destroy almost 7% of
the flowers and could imperil some of the frogs or their habitat, the
study found.</TE>
<TE>   But it was what the report didn't say that vexed many Los Angeles
residents. It did not reconsider the effects of increased traffic
flowing from Ahmanson Ranch--estimated at more than 45,000 car trips
a day.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County planners decided there was no need to update 1992
traffic projections, because the original environmental impact report
already had considered the congestion that increased traffic would
bring to the Ventura Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   But Caltrans has sent mixed signals about whether a fresh traffic
analysis is necessary, said Dennis Hawkins, the Ventura County
planner overseeing the Ahmanson proposal. Twice the state agency has
asked the county to conduct a new traffic study, only to withdraw the
request after meeting with the county staff, Hawkins said. Now
Caltrans wants Ventura County to impose a $5.4-million fee to offset
effects on the Ventura Freeway, he said. The developer has agreed to
pay a $1.6-million freeway mitigation fee.</TE>

<LD>Taking its show on the road to the heart of secession country, the
Los Angeles City Council met Wednesday in a Canoga Park theater to
debate one of the hot-button issues in the San Fernando Valley:

<LD>   The council was weighing its response to Ventura County's latest
environmental analysis of Ahmanson Ranch, a 2,800-acre suburb planned
for the hills north of Calabasas.</LD>
<LD>   An overflow crowd packed the Madrid Theatre and spilled onto the
sidewalk during the debate. Some wore anti-Ahmanson T-shirts, while
others wore "Build It" stickers on their shirts.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously, there is not an apathetic feeling here in the San
Fernando Valley, as some people think," said Councilman Dennis Zine,
smiling at the huge crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County and Los Angeles officials are sparring over the
development that would bring 3,050 homes, 400,000 square feet of
commercial and office space, golf courses and a resort hotel to the
eastern edge of Ventura County, overlooking the west San Fernando
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The $2-billion development by Washington Mutual, the nation's
largest savings and loan, also has sparked an extraordinary
counter-campaign by Hollywood celebrities such as Rob Reiner and
Martin Sheen.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to the project is intense on the Los Angeles side of
the county line, chiefly because Ahmanson Ranch would funnel its
traffic onto the streets of the west San Fernando Valley. The area
already is one of the city's fastest-growing spots, with population
in the 3rd Council District jumping 11.4% in the last decade,
according to census figures.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County approved the project, which has yet to break
ground, 10 years ago. The county commissioned a supplemental
environmental impact report after two rare species were found at the
site.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the new report dealt with the San Fernando Valley
spineflower and red-legged frogs discovered three years ago at
Ahmanson Ranch. Building the development would destroy almost 7% of
the flowers and could imperil some of the frogs or their habitat, the
study found.</TE>
<TE>   But it was what the report didn't say that vexed many Los Angeles
residents. It did not reconsider the effects of increased traffic
flowing from Ahmanson Ranch--estimated at more than 36,000 car trips
a day.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County planners decided that there was no need to update
1992 traffic projections, because the original environmental impact
report already had considered the congestion that increased traffic
would bring to the Ventura Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   But Caltrans has sent mixed signals about whether a fresh traffic
analysis is necessary, said Dennis Hawkins, the Ventura County
planner overseeing the Ahmanson proposal. Twice the state agency has
asked the county to conduct a new traffic study, only to withdraw the
request after meeting with county staff, Hawkins said. Now Caltrans
wants Ventura County to impose a $5.4-million mitigation fee to
offset effects to the Ventura Freeway, he said. The developer has
agreed to pay a $1.6-million freeway mitigation fee.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles City Council voted last fall to keep a stretch of
Victory Boulevard closed, even though it's a major access point to
the ranch and the developer claims legal rights to the street.</TE>
<TE>   "I am adamantly, completely and without reservation opposed" to
the project, said Councilman Zine, who was elected last year after
vowing to do "whatever it takes" to stop Ahmanson.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell the people who are supporting it to drive the Ventura
Freeway seven days a week like I do and sit in gridlock for an hour,"
Zine said. "It is the most frustrating thing. If I had hair, I'd pull
it out."</TE>
<TE>   Zine, who represents the West Valley, has asked the city attorney
and various city agencies to review the environmental report.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In what is shaping up as the next great political fight over a
prospective judge, Republican senators and Latino activists called
Wednesday for swift Senate approval of Miguel Estrada, a 40-year-old
native of Honduras and a favorite of Washington's conservatives.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush nominated Estrada last May for a seat on the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia, often a springboard for
elevation to the Supreme Court. If confirmed, Estrada could be positioned
to become the first Latino named to the high court.</LD>
<LD>   But no confirmation hearing has been set in the Judiciary Committee,
and Republicans charged Wednesday that the Democrats are stalling because
the stakes are so high.</LD>
<TE>   "If you're conservative and a minority, the bar is set higher for
you," Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) told a small rally of Estrada's
supporters at the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   "This is Clarence Thomas all over again. If you're conservative and a
minority, they hate you," he said, referring to liberals and Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "He is likely to be the first Hispanic American to sit on the Supreme
Court. That's the thing they are holding against him," added Sen. Orrin
G. Hatch of Utah, the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>Democrat Cites Lack of Judicial Experience</TE>
<TE>   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) labeled
the Republicans' charges as "pure partisan bunk."</TE>
<TE>   "To contend that Mr. Estrada, a young attorney with no judicial
experience, is the only Hispanic who could be a nominee to a potential
vacancy on the Supreme Court does a disservice to the many outstanding
Hispanic judges serving in our federal and state courts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy repeated his promise to hold a hearing on Estrada's nomination
this year but did not set a date. Aides predicted that the hearing would
be held in June or July.</TE>
<TE>   But the Republicans are not alone in seeing a parallel to the battles
over Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, the senior President Bush put Thomas, then 42, on the same
U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington. Thomas also had no judicial
experience, which is not uncommon for nominees to the court.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, when Justice Thurgood Marshall retired, Bush selected
Thomas--the only black Republican on the federal appellate bench--to fill
his seat on the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Neas, president of the liberal People for the American Way,
contended that the Bush administration had been searching for a "Latino
Clarence Thomas" and appears to have found him in Estrada.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember, George W. Bush [as a candidate] promised to appoint judges
in the mold of Thomas and [Justice Antonin] Scalia. And we take him at
his word. They are looking for someone who can undermine the key legal
precedents of the last 40 years and also divide the progressive
community, like Thomas did, at least for a few weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Neas said his group has not taken an official stand on Estrada's
nomination. Nor have some Latino legal groups, such as the
Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. But the Latino
Coalition, representing seven national groups, called Wednesday for
Estrada's swift approval.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here to blow the whistle on unnecessary partisan obstruction,"
said Robert Deposada, the group's president. "To deny Latinos, the
nation's largest minority, the opportunity to have one of our own serve
on this court in our nation's capital is unforgivable."</TE>
<TE>Court Rules on Regulatory Issues</TE>
<TE>   The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is often considered
the nation's second most important because it decides national regulatory
issues, such as appeals from the Federal Communications Commission and
the Environmental Protection Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the court has nine active judges, four Democratic
appointees and five Republican. Like the high court, it has never had a
Latino judge.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago attorney Angel G. Gomez, president of the Hispanic National
Bar Assn., said his group endorsed Estrada because of his background and
experience, not because of his legal views.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a lot on the record about his views. We are aware he is
very conservative, but in the totality of the circumstances, our board
chose to endorse him," Gomez said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Among both his admirers and detractors, Estrada is regarded as highly
capable and strongly conservative.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, and his father
was a commercial lawyer. After his parents divorced, he moved to New York
at age 17 to join his mother and go to college. He graduated near the top
of his class at Columbia College and Harvard Law School. His professional
life has been divided between New York and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   He served as a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy,
worked for Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr in the first Bush
administration and then joined the Washington office of Gibson Dunn &amp;
Crutcher, where Theodore B. Olson, the U.S. solicitor general, was a
partner.</TE>
<TE>   In person, Estrada is blunt and direct. He has made no secret of his
disdain for liberal Supreme Court rulings favoring criminal defendants
and affirmative action.</TE>
<TE>   When the Clinton administration took office in 1993, Estrada stayed on
for a time in the solicitor general's office. The lawyers there represent
the government in the Supreme Court and, by tradition, they seek to avoid
partisanship.</TE>
<TE>   However, Paul Bender, a liberal law professor who served as deputy
solicitor general during the Clinton years, said he found Estrada so
"ideologically driven that he couldn't be trusted to state the law in a
fair, neutral way."</TE>
<TE>   "Miguel is smart and charming, but he is a right-wing ideologue. He
has an agenda that's similar to Clarence Thomas'. I don't think it
reflects the agenda of most Hispanics," Bender said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Because Estrada has not served as a judge or been published in law
reviews as a professor, he has a rather limited record for the Judiciary
Committee to examine. He was rated well-qualified by the American Bar
Assn. and he has argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court. In most of
these, however, he was presenting the views of the Justice Department and
the solicitor general's office.</TE>
<TE>Latinos Went Unheard Under GOP Control</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said he found it "fascinating that
the Republicans are suddenly concerned about fairness to Hispanic
nominees when they were not concerned during the Clinton administration."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton nominated Texas lawyers Jorge Rangel and Enrique Morena to the
U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans, but neither was given a hearing
when Republicans controlled the Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Clinton chose Colorado Deputy Atty. Gen. Christine Arguello
for the U.S. Court of Appeals in Denver, but she too waited four years
and never received a hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy also noted that it took nearly four years for the Republicans
to allow a confirmation vote on Judge Richard Paez of Los Angeles for the
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Since last July, when the Democrats took control of the Senate, 42 of
Bush's 98 judicial nominations have been confirmed. Of these, seven
joined appellate courts and 35 became trial judges. One nominee--Charles
Pickering--has been rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy says the number of confirmations exceeds the average number of
judges confirmed when Clinton faced a Republican Senate.</TE>
<TE>   However, only three of Bush's first 11 appeals court nominees have had
hearings, and two of them were black Democrats nominated originally by
Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Estrada would not get favorable
treatment simply because he is a Latino.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care if a nominee is white, black, Latino or anything," he
said. "If they are in the mold of Scalia and Thomas, I'm not going to be
stampeded into voting for them."</TE>

<HD>Ohio Ban on Concealed Guns Voided</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI
</DL>
<LD>A state appeals court Wednesday declared Ohio's ban on concealed
weapons unconstitutional--delighting gun-rights advocates who are pushing
hard to get citizens in all 50 states the right to carry hidden firearms.</LD>
<LD>   Just six states, all in the Midwest, block citizens from walking or
driving the streets with loaded guns tucked out of sight. Ohio has long
been one of them.</LD>
<LD>   But a three-judge panel from the 1st Ohio District Court of Appeals
unanimously ruled that the ban violated the first article of the state
Constitution, which says that "the people have the right to bear arms for
their defense and security."</LD>
<TE>   Presiding Judge Mark P. Painter read aloud that line from the state's
founding fathers, then added: "We believe they meant what they said."</TE>
<TE>   The decision applies only to the court's jurisdiction of southwest
Ohio, including Cincinnati. An appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court is
certain.</TE>
<TE>   Still, advocates of concealed weapons counted the ruling as a major
victory. And they predicted it would help sway sentiment in their favor
elsewhere across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great day," said Dave LaCourse, a spokesman for the Second
Amendment Foundation, a gun-rights lobbying group that funded the
challenge to Ohio's law. "We've created a blueprint for potential
lawsuits in other states."</TE>
<TE>   California, he said, was among the likely targets.</TE>
<TE>   California law allows citizens to obtain a concealed gun permit if
they can convince their local sheriff or police chief that they need one.</TE>
<TE>Los Angeles a Tough City to Get a Permit</TE>
<TE>   Local authorities have complete discretion, so standards vary widely.
The city of Los Angeles has long been considered one of the toughest
jurisdictions; from the late 1970s though the early 1990s, the city went
17 years without issuing a permit.</TE>
<TE>   The Second Amendment Foundation is considering suing on the grounds
that the uneven permit process violates guarantees of due process and
equal protection in California.</TE>
<TE>   Other key targets for gun-rights advocates are the Midwest
states--Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois and Ohio--that
ban concealed weapons. Several have become political battlegrounds this
year, as gun-rights groups attempt to capitalize on a new public interest
in self-defense they see emerging since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers may not bear out the perception of a society increasingly
drawn to guns. Despite a strong spike in September and October, the FBI
did fewer background checks on citizens purchasing handguns in 2001 than
in 2000. The pace is even slower this year.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, National Rifle Assn. spokesman Andrew Arulanandam says
"we're hearing that people are interested more than ever in personal
protection, so we see a need for state legislation to address that."</TE>
<TE>   Thus, a fierce debate about easing the concealed-carry ban was already
underway in Ohio before Wednesday's ruling. Missouri and Illinois
lawmakers are grappling with the issue as well.</TE>
<TE>   A bill to allow hidden guns made it through Wisconsin's House earlier
this year before Democrats blocked it in the Senate. A Nebraska state
senator vows to push a similar bill in his statehouse next year. In
Colorado, meanwhile, lawmakers are weighing a proposal to make it easier
for citizens to get concealed-carry permits.</TE>
<TE>   "The gun lobby, like partisan politicians, see the Midwest as a key
battleground," said Mark Pertschuk, who fights for gun control as the
legislative director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying everything possible and if that doesn't work, they
come back and try again," Pertschuk said. "They're relentless."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, gun-rights advocates say they are approaching the Midwest
fights this year with a refined strategy. They are more willing than in
the past to compromise with gun-control advocates--to accept restrictions
on who can get a permit, on what kind of training will be required and on
where a concealed weapon can be carried.</TE>
<TE>   In Missouri, instead of pushing for a comprehensive concealed carry
bill, gun-rights activists are trying to win the more limited right for
citizens to carry loaded guns under their seats or in their glove
compartment as they drive through the state.</TE>
<TE>   The goal, they say, is to get some laws on the books--with the
expectation that they can return in a year or two and lobby for easing
the restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to get your foot in the door," explained Rick Salyer, a
National Guardsman active in the gun-rights movement in Missouri. "Then
you can open the door a little more, then a little more. And pretty soon
you've got your freedom back."</TE>
<TE>   The tactic is drawn from experience: In Florida, Texas, Oklahoma,
Tennessee and elsewhere, concealed-carry laws passed years ago after
tight restrictions were imposed to appease opponents "who made dire
predictions that fender-benders would lead to blood in the gutters," said
Joe Waldron, director of the Citizens Committee to Keep and Bear Arms, a
lobbying group.</TE>
<TE>   After a few years, standards were relaxed, Waldron said, "because they
found it wasn't a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Or as Ross Dykman, a Michigan gun activist, put it: "You take what you
can get . . . and then, when people see it isn't causing any trouble, you
take it further." He plans, for instance, to lobby the state next year to
ease the ban on taking concealed weapons into schools, hospitals, bars,
day-care centers and sports arenas. He calls it the "baby steps"
strategy.</TE>
<TE>New Momentum Seen in Ohio</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court ruling in Cincinnati may give the tactic fresh
momentum, at least in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   By voiding the state ban on concealed weapons, the judges paved the
way for anyone to carry a firearm, with no background check or training.
That, in turn, has spurred calls for a permitting system that would
impose some controls.</TE>
<TE>   "We now have no regulation whatsoever," said Hamilton County Dist.
Atty. Mike Allen. "It's a public safety issue. Our Legislature has to get
off the dime and enact a reasonable concealed-carry law."</TE>
<TE>   In Michigan, however, Washtenaw County Prosecutor Brian Mackie warns
that the gun-rights lobby will work to weaken laws that look reasonable
now. "It's a calculated strategy," said Mackie, who opposes concealed
weapons. "You have to think about the next step and the step after that.
What is it they really want? What is it they will be satisfied with?"</TE>
<TE>   Striding through his rumpled Cincinnati neighborhood, private
investigator Chuck Klein knows how he would answer that question.</TE>
<TE>   He was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit challenging the Ohio ban. And
he has little use for the baby-step strategy the gun lobby has deployed.
Walking streets that were torn by race riots a year ago, Klein says he
will be satisfied only when he can take his gun with him wherever he
goes.</TE>
<TE>   He wants the right to carry it into the courthouse, into schools, into
his synagogue, into a baseball stadium, into City Hall. That's what his
lawsuit was about. That's what he will keep pushing for as the political
debate churns on. "If you have the inalienable right to carry a gun, you
have the inalienable right to carry it anywhere," he said. "When nobody
has a gun except the bad guys, everyone's at their mercy."</TE>
<TE>   Ohio state Rep. Edward Jerse responds with a plea to put away the
slogans and think about the message concealed-carry laws send.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an unacceptable level of violence in our society," said
Jerse, a Democrat. "We have got to change our culture. And you don't do
that by throwing up your hands and saying, 'OK, everybody get a gun.' "</TE>

<HD>Sharon Rebuffs U.S. as Jenin Camp Is Seized</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Mass surrenders and large numbers of deaths are reported
as army continues offensive. Powell is to arrive in Israel tonight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HAIFA, Israel
</DL>
<LD>On the eve of a crucial U.S. diplomatic drive, Israel on Wednesday
again refused to withdraw from the West Bank cities it invaded 13 days
ago and said a deadly suicide bombing on a bus earlier in the day showed
why the offensive must continue.</LD>
<LD>   As the army reported that it had finally succeeded in conquering the
beleaguered Jenin refugee camp, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and members
of his government told the United States that although they appreciate
America's friendship, Israel will wage its war on Palestinian militants
as it sees fit.</LD>
<LD>   "I hope our great friend the United States understands that this is a
war of survival for us," Sharon told reporters during a visit to troops
at an army base overlooking the Jenin camp. "It is our right to defend
our citizens, and there should be no pressure put on us not to do that."</LD>
<TE>   In Madrid, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and ranking officials
from three other world powers called for an immediate end to Israel's
military operation in the West Bank and for both Israelis and
Palestinians to end "this senseless confrontation."</TE>
<TE>   Powell, who is expected to arrive in Israel late tonight, huddled in a
crisis session with officials from the United Nations, the European Union
and Russia in the city where the current peace process was born 11 years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank, the Israeli operation continued Wednesday. In the
Jenin camp, mass surrenders were reported--along with large numbers of
deaths. Scores of Palestinians and about 30 Israeli soldiers were killed
in a week of fighting. Israel said Palestinian gunmen put up their
stiffest resistance in Jenin; Palestinian officials accused Israel of
"massacres."</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank city of Bethlehem, a monk was shot and wounded when
he stuck his head out of the besieged Church of the Nativity. Israeli
troops said it was unclear who shot him.</TE>
<TE>   And in the northern Israeli port city of Haifa, the bodies of eight
Israelis were removed from a bus twisted and charred by a suicide bomber.
The radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for the Haifa
blast, the first suicide bombing to target civilians in a week and
clearly designed to undermine Powell's visit.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the bombing, Sharon again rejected the U.S. and
international pleas that Israeli forces pull out of the West Bank,
digging in his heels hours before the arrival of Powell, who is making a
long-shot attempt to broker a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of right-wing Israelis rallied Wednesday night outside the
U.S. Consulate in West Jerusalem to demand that the United States cease
its pressure on the Sharon government. "Bush, Don't Push!" read one
gigantic banner.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army announced today that it had pulled out of 24 villages
overnight, while continuing to operate in the West Bank cities of
Ramallah, Jenin, Nablus and Bethlehem and entering the villages of
Birzeit and Dahariya.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Defense Ministry announced a pullout from three
villages: Yatta, Kabatiya and Samua.</TE>
<TE>   The Jenin refugee camp succumbed after a week of shelling by Israeli
tanks and helicopters. By midmorning Wednesday, the resistance appeared
to be all but over, although sporadic shooting was reported throughout
the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>A Group of Holdouts Reported to Be Trapped</TE>
<TE>   One group of about 50 holdouts was reported to have become trapped
deep inside the camp without ammunition as Israeli bulldozers were
bearing down. Jamal Hweil, one of the men, telephoned the pan-Arab Al
Jazeera television network to claim that the Israeli army was refusing
their surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Hweil said the men feared that the bulldozers would demolish their
hide-out, with them inside.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Jenin who were contacted by telephone said Israeli
helicopters continued flying over the camp throughout the day without
firing. But they said that bulldozers went into action around noon,
knocking down homes damaged by the assault.</TE>
<TE>   Omar abu Rashid, a Jenin businessman whose house overlooks the camp
from half a mile away, said he saw five bulldozers demolish several
hundred of the camp's 2,000 to 2,500 homes.</TE>
<TE>   Refugee families, ordered into the streets by the army, were dispersed
to various neighboring villages. Men were separated from women. Residents
complained of a large number of civilian casualties and the destruction
of water, electrical and sewage infrastructure along with large amounts
of private property--homes, stores and cars.</TE>
<TE>   Journalists were barred from Jenin. Two convoys, from UNICEF and the
International Committee of the Red Cross, were allowed into the city to
drop off food, medicine, other relief supplies and a generator for the
city's hospital but were barred from the camp.</TE>
<TE>   Saeb Erekat, a top Palestinian official, said about 500 Palestinians
had been killed in Jenin and in Nablus, the largest West Bank city, since
the offensive began late last month, dying in what he labeled a string of
"Israeli massacres."</TE>
<TE>   Among the dead was Mahmoud Tawalbeh, the head of the radical Islamic
Jihad in Jenin.</TE>
<TE>   Outside Haifa, a Palestinian man with explosives strapped to his waist
boarded bus No. 960 bound for Jerusalem during Wednesday morning's rush
hour. About 20 minutes later, he detonated his bomb, killing himself and
eight Israelis, most of them police officers on the way to work.</TE>
<TE>   The blast lifted the bus off the ground, tossed about nearby cars and
shattered what had been a lull in the relentless suicide attacks that
terrorized Israelis last month. Senior military commanders cited the
relative quiet as proof that their invasion of the West Bank was doing
the trick.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the dead, 14 people were hurt. Blood spilled down the
side of the bus. Body parts were scattered the width of the highway.</TE>
<TE>   As he was being wheeled in to surgery, bus driver Yehuda Akst told
reporters that the bomber didn't do anything to rouse suspicion. He might
even have been wearing an Israeli army uniform, said Akst, who has driven
a bus for 31 years.</TE>
<TE>   Akst's wife later told reporters that he was especially fearful, and
vigilant, on the Haifa-Jerusalem route.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day when he came home, he said that he felt fear," said Zvia
Akst, surrounded by friends and family in the waiting room of Haifa's
Rambam Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Dvora Sinvani also waited while her son, a 24-year-old engineering
student and reservist, underwent surgery to remove pieces of metal that
the bomb had embedded in his body.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is, I felt the situation had become more relaxed, but you
can never tell," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Omri Saleh, 29, was driving along behind the bus "when suddenly
everything exploded." The Israeli Arab resident of Nazareth, who works
for the electrical company, suffered minor injuries, including the loss
of hearing in his left ear.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm angry," he said from a bed in the emergency room of another Haifa
hospital where some of the victims were taken. "I used to live fine with
the Jews, and now I can't even go out at night. I just want this all to
stop."</TE>
<TE>   There were conflicting reports about whether the bomber came from
Tulkarm, a city invaded and just abandoned by Israeli troops, or Jenin.</TE>
<TE>Tensions Increase at Church of the Nativity</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, tensions increased at the Church of the Nativity on
Wednesday when an Armenian monk was shot and wounded.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army's siege of the church, where more than 140
Palestinians and nearly 80 clerics have been trapped for eight days, has
been marked by bloodshed. On Tuesday, a Palestinian police officer was
killed and two Israeli border police officers wounded in a predawn
shootout. Last week, a bell ringer was killed by Israeli troops when he
ran out of the compound.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli military said it was unclear who shot the monk Wednesday
and where he was in the compound. Israeli and Palestinian snipers are
active in the area.</TE>
<TE>   The incident came at a time when Israeli troops were bringing in food
and supplies to drop off at the compound and came under fire, according
to the Israeli army. The monk was rushed to a hospital in Jerusalem,
where officials said he was badly hurt but in stable condition with a
gunshot wound in the back.</TE>
<TE>   The religious compound is shared by three houses of worship: an
Armenian Orthodox church; a Franciscan monastery attached to St.
Catherine's, a Roman Catholic church; and the Church of the Nativity,
which Greek Orthodox clerics share with the other two denominations.
Although Palestinian gunmen have taken over the compound, they are
concentrated in the Church of the Nativity and St. Catherine's. The
Armenian monks have kept their doors shut and reportedly did not allow
the Palestinian fighters to enter their church, according to sources
inside.</TE>

<DL>ORANIT, Israel
</DL>
<LD>Terrorized by human bombs, Israel needs human shields.</LD>
<LD>   That's why Sgt. Elinor Uzan volunteered for the Recon 7 unit of the
Israeli border police. Her specialty: subduing suicide bombers.</LD>
<LD>   The baby-faced Uzan has freckles, orange-blond curls and an
irrepressible smile. Armed with a Jericho semiautomatic pistol and
wearing street clothes, the 19-year-old patrols malls, nightclub
districts and other public places that are the bloodstained home front of
the Mideast conflict.</LD>
<TE>   She scans crowds for a heavy coat, a sweaty brow, whitened knuckles
and other signs of an imminent confrontation with walking death. When the
moment comes, she will do the opposite of what most people would do. She
will attack, trying to overpower the bomber before he or she turns her
into another victim.</TE>
<TE>   "Either you respond or you freeze," Uzan said. "A lot of people are
depending on you. It's very hard to train for this. How do you train for
something like that? You work mainly on your mind, how fast you are, how
alert you are."</TE>
<TE>   A barrage of bombings last month gave the unit an extensive dossier of
carnage to study. Training intensely for close-quarters combat, the
officers also learn everything they can about the nihilistic psychology
and sophisticated methodology of the enemy. And sometimes, intelligence
from informants in the West Bank helps.</TE>
<TE>   A suicide bomber killed eight people on a bus near Haifa on Wednesday,
ending a weeklong lull in bomb attacks on civilians during Israel's
military offensive in the West Bank. Israel says it launched the
operation in Palestinian territory to stop an onslaught of suicide
bombings against civilians that killed 85 people and wounded 672 between
Jan. 22 and April 1.</TE>
<TE>   In today's Israel, the border is everywhere. Arabs and Jews live close
together, glaring at one another across boulevards, walls and barbed-wire
fences. Street checkpoints, military foot patrols and cruising police
cars have multiplied in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and other cities.</TE>
<TE>   To beef up defenses, the national police force has yanked detectives,
supervisors and cadets off assignments and sent them on street patrol.
And the border police, a force with a two-fisted reputation, is changing
roles.</TE>
<TE>   The border agency has never patrolled international boundaries in a
conventional sense. Rather, it has been a paramilitary force responding
to demonstrations and riots by Arabs, as well as handling rural law
enforcement and occasional military duties.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of facing stone-throwing youths, units such as Recon 7 rove
the internal front line with the ultimate--and unenviable--tactical
challenge of detecting and intercepting suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Uzan belongs to one of a number of specialized units that work around
the nation. Sometimes in uniform and sometimes in plainclothes, her
40-officer unit patrols an area north of Tel Aviv that encompasses
Netanya, the coastal resort where a bomber killed 27 people at a Passover
dinner in a hotel--and triggered the military drive into the West Bank.
The units work in teams of three or four officers.</TE>
<TE>   The mission makes being a member of the SWAT team or the bomb squad
seem relatively safe. At least bombs don't struggle and explode
themselves at will; and gunmen can only kill one person at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "If a terrorist comes to a scene and shoots, there is a firefight,"
said Superintendent Shlomi Abukasi, the commander of the unit. "You have
a couple of seconds of shooting. But in the case of a suicide bomber, you
don't have that window of time."</TE>
<TE>Some Have Volunteered</TE>
<TE>   Abukasi, 36, is of Jewish Moroccan descent. Like U.S. Border Patrol
agents, about half of whom are Latino, the Israeli border police force
attracts working-class immigrants. The officers who trained Tuesday with
pistols and M-16s at a firing range in a rock quarry in this semirural
area east of Tel Aviv came from a variety of backgrounds, including
Ethiopian, Kurdish and Druze Arabs. Some officers in Recon 7 have
volunteered for the duty, but not all.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting on a rock by the firing range, the lean and quiet Abukasi
looked unwaveringly alert. Asked about his mind-set on the street, he
said: "It's imagination and memory. My imagination and memory work
together. I imagine a terrorist exploding, the damage that's done. When I
go after a terrorist, I imagine what will happen when I blow up. And my
memory recalls all the experiences from the calls I have worked on, the
little pieces of bodies everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Although suicide bombing seems individualistic and anarchic, each
attack is the product of a network. Experts prepare exploding belts and
vests in secret laboratories, 15 of which have been discovered by Israeli
troops during the West Bank operation. Accomplices often drive bombers
into Israeli cities from Palestinian areas.</TE>
<TE>   The involvement of a terrorist structure gives Israeli forces a better
chance of detecting a plot in the making. Sometimes intelligence agents
provide police and private security companies with photos and names of
suspected bombers and anticipated times they might strike.</TE>
<TE>   Even if officers are on the lookout for a known face, the Recon 7 unit
faces a profound dilemma when it comes to using deadly force.</TE>
<TE>   "Shooting is a problem," Abukasi said. "Because if you make a mistake,
you can't turn back the clock." It's a tightrope between under-reaction
and overreaction. In one incident, Uzan said, an Arab suspect seemed like
the real thing: He acted nervous. He carried a big bag. When challenged,
he made a move to flee, then reached into his bag as the officers aimed
their guns.</TE>
<TE>   Although the officers were as terrified as the suspect, they did not
fire. It turned out that he was just reaching into the bag to pull out
his ID card.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very close to being killed," Uzan said.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, shouting an alert in a crowded place could be problematic.
It could cause panic, and many Israelis pack guns.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic stops are another nightmare. Checkpoints are especially
vulnerable; an officer died in Jerusalem last week when he stopped a car
and a bomber inside immolated them both.</TE>
<TE>   The instinct is to keep a suspect at a distance, Uzan said. But if you
stay too far back, you can't see or hear enough to make decisions.
Officers take turns, some at a distance and one approaching the car to
ask questions and examine documents.</TE>
<TE>   "We flip a coin," Uzan said, chuckling.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the Recon 7 officers respond to a call or spot a suspect on
their own, the grimmest scenario is the most likely one: stealthily
jumping the bomber and grabbing his or her hands.</TE>
<TE>   On one occasion, Uzan and her team rushed a bona fide bomber. The
explosives he was carrying were not yet wired to go off, she said. But
that didn't reduce the adrenaline flow or the pride she felt
afterward--the reasons she signed up in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm enjoying it," Uzan said. "I know I save a lot of lives. My father
is very, very proud. My mother is very nervous and worried."</TE>
<TE>Police Criticized</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the aggressive police response brings criticism. On March
8, a border police unit intercepted Mahmoud Salah, 23, and another
Palestinian in a housing project in the Beit Hanina area of Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Salah wore explosives strapped to his torso and was on his way to
commit an attack in a Jewish area, according to police and to the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade, an extremist group to which he belonged.</TE>
<TE>   During the excruciating incident, which was recorded by a
photographer, at least three police officers struggled with Salah, held
him face down and pulled off his shirt and pants. A bomb squad expert
arrived and tried to defuse the explosive, but Salah rolled around trying
to press the trigger button on his stomach against the cement, according
to police.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the officers shot Salah in the head. Palestinian activists
accused the officers of executing him in cold blood, saying he was under
control when he was shot.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli police, however, said the officers fired because they feared
he would ignite the explosives. They argued that police hope to capture
suspected bombers alive to assist their investigations.</TE>
<TE>   A prosecutor's inquiry found no wrongdoing and the case was closed,
according to Gil Kleiman, a national police spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Matter-of-fact heroism has accompanied some of the more than 35
bombing attempts this year. On March 7, a man with a backpack walked into
a popular cafe in Jerusalem's German Colony neighborhood. A customer
thought he was suspicious and pointed him out to restaurant employees.
Realizing that the man had a triggering device in his hand, the customer,
a security guard and a waiter pushed him outside and wrestled the
would-be bomber down. It was the guard's first day on duty.</TE>
<TE>   The war at home has caused unprecedented demand for security guards.</TE>
<TE>   "It's madness," said Drol Chayu of Shahaf Security in Haifa.
"Everybody wants guards, armed guards. We don't have enough people. And
we don't have enough guns. There has never been this frequency, never so
many guards for restaurants and pubs and streets."</TE>
<TE>   Security guards have become a fixture outside establishments such as
the Hillel Cafe, a street-corner coffeehouse on Jaffa Street in downtown
Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Propped against a stool in the doorway with a rifle slung over his
shoulder, security guard AmotzSegal watches the urban landscape through
wraparound sunglasses: soldiers on foot patrol, citizens with pistols
jammed in their waistbands, pedestrians walking quickly and wasting no
time window-shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Segal, 22, recently finished his military service after three years in
a combat unit that saw action in Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Then he went to work for $4 an hour as a sentry on Jaffa Street, which
has been a major bombing target. The sidewalks are half-empty.</TE>
<TE>   The job requires constant threat assessment, Segal said. The idea is
to spot a potential attacker before he gets too close and stop him at
gunpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Guards are a deterrent because terrorists want to get inside, where
it's likely they will kill more people, Chayu said.</TE>
<TE>   Small comfort for the minimum-wage human shield. Just having an
espresso on a sunny day has become an act of patriotism and daring, Segal
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's braver than me," Segal said, nodding at a customer at an outdoor
table. "I've got a weapon and he doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   Many Israelis now stay home for safety's sake; video rentals have
soared. But Uzan, who spends her days stalking death, is having none of
it. At work or at play, she stands up for her country.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to go out more," Uzan said cheerfully. "I don't have much free
time, but when I do, I say: 'Let's go dance. Let's go to a restaurant.' I
don't want them to stop our lives."</TE>

<HD>A Cloud of Ruin Hangs Over Poppy Crop</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Growers vow to fight ban. 'Yes, we know it's poison,
but we have to feed our families.'</DH>

<DL>ARABAN, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>A bountiful spring harvest has come to Nangarhar province. A
gorgeous carpet of pink and violet flowers has sprung from the red earth,
stretching for miles past fields of young green wheat and white-topped
onions.</LD>
<LD>   These are opium poppies, the first crop since the Taliban outlawed
opium growing in July 2000, reducing the crop by a stunning 96%. This is
also the first poppy crop since the interim Afghan government was
installed in December, and it has precipitated a crisis in Nangarhar.</LD>
<LD>   In a matter of days, the poppies will be ready for extraction of the
gummy gray opium paste that is processed into heroin in Pakistan and sent
via Iran and Turkey to addicts in Europe.</LD>
<TE>   But the Kabul government, under pressure from the United States and
Britain, has threatened to destroy the entire harvest unless farmers
accept token cash payments to plow under their poppies. Nangarhar's opium
farmers, a contentious lot, have responded with a volatile mixture of
fear and defiance.</TE>
<TE>   "Destroy my crop? Hah! The government wouldn't dare," said Abdul Ali,
a stout farmer of 25 who says he has invested 120,000 rupees, or about
$2,000, in his six acres of poppies here in the lush Sukh Rod (Red River)
valley southwest of Jalalabad. "If they try to touch one poppy, there'll
be big trouble, I promise you."</TE>
<TE>   Farmers have barricaded roads, stoned passing cars, blocked returning
refugees and shot dead a provincial functionary who dared set foot on a
poppy field. Some Afghans speculate that opium had something to do with a
bomb that killed five people Monday in a failed attempt in Jalalabad to
assassinate the country's defense minister--the man who would send in
soldiers to destroy poppies.</TE>
<TE>   Nangarhar is the country's second-largest opium-producing province
after Helmand in the south (where eight protesting farmers were killed by
government forces Sunday and authorities began destroying poppy crops
Wednesday). Nangarhar is also the source of the finest-quality opium
paste. The opium trade is the engine of the local economy, generating
millions of dollars for wealthy drug traffickers and smaller sums for
thousands of farmers and their illiterate laborers.</TE>
<TE>Government's Offer Is Deemed an Insult</TE>
<TE>   Farmers say they are insulted by the government's offer of $250 per
jerib, about half an acre. They say they earn at least $2,000 from the
opium paste produced on one jerib--many times the income from wheat or
corn. On Wednesday, the government increased the offer to $350 per jerib.</TE>
<TE>   For Nangarhar's political bosses and military commanders, opium is a
delicate subject. According to the farmers, top officials profit
handsomely from the drug trade either by leasing their considerable land
holdings to opium farmers, growing poppies themselves, or charging fees
to permit opium trafficking through their territories.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing furtive or shameful about growing opium poppies here.
They grow openly on corner lots in Jalalabad, the provincial capital.
People plant poppies in their gardens.</TE>
<TE>   The other day, Haji Abdul Qadir, the provincial governor, sat slumped
in a padded chair inside the governor's palace, sweat glistening on his
tanned bald head. He had just emerged from a meeting with hostile
farmers--tall, bearded, sunburned men in dirt-streaked robes who had
upbraided him.</TE>
<TE>   "The farmers say we are taking bread from their mouths," Qadir said, a
plaintive edge in his voice. "But what can I do? I am obligated to obey
the government. If it was up to me, I'd say begin the harvest tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   The region's security chief, the urbane and polished Haji Mohammed
Zaman, sat wearily in his orange grove, lamenting his fate. He had enough
problems maintaining day-to-day security on his troubled patch of earth
without the added burden of an opium war.</TE>
<TE>   Zaman too had been chastised by the farmers. And now, he said,
American drug agents had joined the U.S. Special Forces soldiers living
in his compound. He sensed trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "The farmers are right," Zaman said. "Two hundred fifty dollars a
jerib--it's nothing. But the orders have come, and we must obey orders."</TE>
<TE>   It so happens that the farmers who produce the country's finest opium
hail from Zaman's home district of Khogiani near Tora Bora. And it so
happens that some of the biggest and most impressive poppy fields in the
region surround the country estate of his good friend, Qadir.</TE>
<TE>   "That," the governor said nonchalantly, "belongs to another person."</TE>
<TE>   Qadir and Zaman seem intent on filibustering the issue to death,
scheduling an endless series of meetings with farmers until after the
harvest is actually in.</TE>
<TE>   Once the paste is extracted, the poppies are just weeds. Then, the
farmers say, the government is welcome to them.</TE>
<TE>New Ban on Crop Was Poorly Timed</TE>
<TE>   Timing is everything with opium. The Taliban announced its 2000 ban in
July, three months before the November planting season. But the interim
government announced its ban in January, after the crop had been planted.</TE>
<TE>   At planting time, most farmers borrow huge sums from the mafia-like
syndicates of Pakistanis and Afghans who buy and transport opium paste.
They must pay for seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, weeding and workers to
tend the labor-intensive plants. At harvest time, they pay back the loans
at 50% interest.</TE>
<TE>   In the idyllic Sukh Rod valley, white-bearded Mohammed Sohbat, 57,
stood atop a haycock and admired his crimson poppies swaying in the soft
spring breeze. He listed every last borrowed rupee he had spent on seeds,
weeding, fertilizer and the like for his 14 jeribs. He rattled off the
ages of his 13 children.</TE>
<TE>   "So you see," he said, "I have a very big investment. If the
government destroys my poppies now, when my money is almost in my hands,
they will be killing my family. I will not let that happen."</TE>
<TE>   Sohbat was trying to rush the harvest. He was up early the other day,
scratching tiny wounds into a poppy pod with a sharp, comb-like tool
called a nashter. The wounds bled a sticky pink resin. Sohbat studied it
and shook his head. It was not quite time to collect the paste with his
metal scraper, or rambee.</TE>
<TE>   "Not yet," he said. "Another two days, maybe three."</TE>
<TE>   Sohbat and other farmers say they detested the Taliban, which enforced
its ban through intimidation and one-year jail terms. They were overjoyed
when Qadir and Zaman returned from exile as the Taliban was driven from
Jalalabad on Nov. 13. Within days, the farmers were planting poppies and
lining up at the governor's palace to pay homage to Qadir.</TE>
<TE>   Now they wonder. "Is this government just putting on a big show for
the Americans?" asked Said Ehsan Sadat, owner of six lush acres of
poppies.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Qadir said, the British are applying most of the pressure.
Afghan opium ends up as heroin in Europe. The Americans, whose heroin
comes from Colombia and Mexico, are more concerned with killing off
Taliban and Al Qaeda survivors and propping up the Kabul government, a
Western diplomat told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Qadir said the Western powers talk a good game about drugs but don't
always deliver. Under Western pressure in the early 1990s, in his first
term as governor, Qadir cut poppy production 25%. But then, he said, the
promised Western financial and technical assistance never materialized.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Qadir delivered a bitter speech that is fondly remembered by
farmers. He told them to grow poppies from their rooftops and flowerpots.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the farmers have other allies.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Yunis Sidiky, a United Nations anti-drug worker, called the
government offer "feeble." He added: "The farmers will commit suicide
before they accept it."</TE>
<TE>   Maulavi Fazalhadi Shinwari, a Koranic scholar who serves as chief
justice for the interim administration, said of his government's offer:
"Paying $250 for something that's worth much more--that's not justice."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is growing opium haram, or forbidden by Islamic law, Shinwari
said, because "we make an exception for exceptional circumstances, such
as people living in poverty."</TE>
<TE>   Maulavi Shafiullah Miakhel, the mullah for the poppy-growing Sukh Rod
valley, sighed and said, "If only there were some alternative cash crops
instead of poppy."</TE>
<TE>   The farmers know that their opium brings misery and despair to Western
cities, as well as to some in Pakistan and Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, we know it's poison, but we have to feed our families," said
Sadat, the grower.</TE>
<TE>   His fellow Sukh Rod valley farmer, Abdul Ali, interrupted him and
said: "We prefer to think of it as growing medicine. What do you call it?
Yes, morphine."</TE>
<TE>   Poison or medicine, it is certain to be the finest crop in two
seasons. The U.N. Drug Control Program estimates the 2002 Afghan harvest
at between 110,000 and 160,000 acres, if not interrupted--far larger than
the more than 18,000 acres cultivated under the Taliban ban last year and
about what the country produced in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "And the quality is higher this year because of the good rainfall,"
said Samsul Haq, the provincial drug-eradication administrator under the
Taliban, who delivered the edict from Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar
banning poppy production.</TE>
<TE>   Now it is the American-backed interim government delivering the edict,
with the job falling to security chief Zaman. In his orange grove, Zaman
sucked on a cigarette and exhaled slowly. "This isn't going to be easy,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>What of Reform Without Parks?</HD>
<DH>Leadership: Losing the chief will have little effect on progress
made under consent decree, but his changes could be threatened.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The almost-certain departure of Chief Bernard C. Parks from the
helm of the Los Angeles Police Department is unlikely to have a major
impact on the extensive package of court-approved reforms set in motion
by a federal consent decree during his tenure.</LD>
<LD>   Largely unaffected by any leadership change will be many areas covered
by the government order. It contains scores of detailed provisions that
guide changes on use-of-force investigations, collection of racial
profiling data and taking of complaints. It also lays out elaborate
requirements for a system to track problem officers.</LD>
<LD>   But under new leadership, there may well be other challenges to the
changes ushered in under Parks--in particular the strong, personal
control he has asserted over officer discipline.</LD>
<TE>   Many uncertainties remain, and despite federal pressure, many reforms
can be influenced by local leadership. Reform in the LAPD today is partly
a matter of closing loopholes--that is, of designing systems to make sure
that officers stay within the rules and that individual discretion in
applying the rules is carefully defined.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly how such systems are designed, and how effectively they can be
made to work in the real world, are looming issues for whoever leads the
department in the future.</TE>
<TE>   It may take years, for example, before anyone really knows whether
there will be erosion in such areas as Parks' tough officer discipline
system. Also unclear is whether his departure will mean further advances
on such reform fronts as civilian oversight, as his key opponent, Mayor
James K. Hahn, contends. Parks' disciplinary system was a particular
flash point, fueling the ire of opponents who sought his removal.</TE>
<TE>   Even more uncertain is whether the police reforms undertaken in recent
years will achieve the desired effect: preventing riots and Rampart-style
corruption scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Questions over the future of LAPD reform hinge partly on what is meant
by the term--and who's asking.</TE>
<TE>   They are further complicated by the fact that the reform banner has
been waved by all camps in the recent debate over Parks, whose
reappointment request was denied 4 to 1 by the Los Angeles Police
Commission on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   From the mayor, to the chief, to the commissioners, even to the
officers union--each party has claimed to be the bigger reformer. Reform
was touted by all, although sometimes to promote quite different agendas.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, who says he will appeal the commission's rejection to the City
Council--but is highly unlikely to prevail--has long insisted that his
commitment to new discipline standards is one reason he has taken so much
heat.</TE>
<TE>   The revamp, he says, is to blame for low officer morale, an issue that
weighed heavily against him in the commission's deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners countered that the chief had failed to "take ownership"
of morale problems in the department, and that he could have done more to
improve morale without compromising reform.</TE>
<TE>   This week, as union leaders rejoiced at Parks' defeat, commissioners
sought to assuage fears among some of the chief's supporters that losing
him would lead to a rollback on reforms designed to keep officers from
impinging on residents' civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   Sensitive on this point, Police Commissioner Silvia Saucedo took pains
to make clear that Parks' defeat would not set back reforms, many of
which are mandated by the 2000 consent decree agreement with the federal
government.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as I am a commissioner, we are not going to backslide from
reform. We are going to move forward full force," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Most experts accept a definition for police reform today that is quite
different from past reform concepts. Police reform efforts were once
intended mostly to counter corruption--officers protecting bookmakers,
for example.</TE>
<TE>   In more recent times, the focus has shifted to racial justice issues,
particularly racial profiling, police use of force and the protection of
civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   In practice, this has come to mean an increasingly standard menu of
reforms spreading to police departments across the country, many with
roots in Los Angeles' troubled history.</TE>
<TE>   The menu is reflected to a large extent in the federal consent decree,
which LAPD Cmdr. Dan Koe-nig calls "without question the most complex
consent decree anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   The decree followed a federal investigation--launched in 1996--of
alleged patterns of civil-rights violations by LAPD officers, according
to a high-level U.S. Justice Department official.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, in a political atmosphere still colored by LAPD officers'
beating of motorist Rodney King, federal legislation was approved to give
federal justice officials new powers to sue police departments. The
resulting consent decree in Los Angeles was one of the earliest actions
initiated.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government has since established a total of four consent
decrees, and three similar documents known as memorandums of agreements,
with various police agencies around the country.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD still represents the largest agency the federal government
has attempted to reform this way. Few claim that such changes will bring
perfectly clean police departments. But the idea is to "create a wide
variety of systems to identify police corruption and attempt to manage
it," said Merrick Bobb, a special counsel to the Board of Supervisors who
oversees Sheriff's Department reform.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government's decree with Los Angeles reflects one of the
twists of new police reform efforts--a trend toward viewing the process
in financial terms rather than strictly as a racial-justice issue.</TE>
<TE>   Systems to help police departments identify potential civil
liabilities and save costs are becoming more popular as a result.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to use computer systems to track information on officers
and analyze statistical trends that might expose local governments to
higher liability costs. For example, such a system might help to zero in
on force policies that boost risk of injury.</TE>
<TE>   This federally mandated effort will continue under whoever is chief.</TE>
<TE>   The idea "is to get information to look at and manipulate it . . .
rather than hunting down all these paper files spread out all over," said
LAPD Deputy Chief David Doan, who heads the effort.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, the department is in the early stages of setting up
prototype computer systems likely to cost the city millions of dollars
over several years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Down the road, Doan said, the LAPD hopes to have the software power to
crunch such arcane bits of information as whether officers use twist
locks or wrist locks, he said. The LAPD and the city had long been
criticized for being slow to develop such a system. Now, partly owing to
the pressure from the Justice Department, "we are taking this to a level
no one has been at before," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There still remain lots of potential problems, however.</TE>
<TE>   City and federal officials continue to bicker over some details of the
system. And labor issues remain--for example, how to fairly deal with
officers who may not be pleased to find themselves flagged as trouble by
computer software.</TE>
<TE>   But the federal official, who is closely involved in the issue, said
Wednesday that "the L.A. consent decree does hold real promise for
bringing about . . . lasting reform for LAPD. We are engaged on our end,
and the city officials are engaged on their end."</TE>
<TE>   Because the reform issue is so complex, the question of whether Hahn
or Parks is the greater reformer remains arguable.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's reform agenda includes a proposal to replace internal LAPD
disciplinary systems with civilian review.</TE>
<TE>   Some insiders say that Parks rammed so many new procedures and
organizational changes through the enormous Police Department that it was
actually disruptive.</TE>
<TE>   Besides introducing his discipline system, Parks has sought to flatten
the command structure and reduce opportunities for defense lawyers to
challenge LAPD officers in court by taking those with problems off the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   Parks also oversaw production of a 362-page critique of the LAPD in
the wake of the Rampart scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The report explores LAPD policies in numbing detail, recommending such
technical changes as tighter restrictions on use of confidential
informants.</TE>
<TE>   The report did not yield what some critics wanted, however: more
punishment for more LAPD brass after Rampart. And Hahn was recently
contemptuous of the effort--criticizing the LAPD's "self-congratulatory
euphoria" over it.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit Police Chief Jerry A. Oliver, whose city recently invited the
federal government to scrutinize its department, said Wednesday that in
policing circles, Parks' Rampart report has been embraced as a blueprint.</TE>
<TE>   The report, which provides the basis for many changes in the LAPD,
also "was used by every progressive police department across the
country," Oliver said. "It was a road map of how to look at this stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Parks has also been faulted by civilian critics during his term for
not applying discipline fairly--an allegation that is hard to prove or
disprove. He has also been criticized for not providing information to
civilian overseers, and most recently, for not dealing squarely with the
Police Commission.</TE>
<TE>   These were not small points, his critics argue. If reform is to work,
civilian overseers "cannot be kept in the dark," Hahn says.</TE>
<TE>   There remains a question over whether a new chief would seek to alter
some of Parks' changes, such as his effort to eliminate the ability of
supervisors to ignore citizen complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Parks has argued for all complaints to be investigated. The union has
suggested that some don't warrant it.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Police Commission President Rick J. Caruso has suggested
that the pendulum of reform may have swung too far in this and other
areas, and that the complaint system has been too damaging to officer
morale, resulting in attrition.</TE>
<TE>   "If crime is going up and the number of officers you have is going
down, how long are you going to stand around?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   For now, there is one area of reform in which the controversy over
Parks' reappointment may have already set the city back:</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials say one of their goals in the consent decree is
political accountability. They designed the decrees to make politicians,
police and civilian overseers all take part, so they can't simply blame
one another if reforms don't work.</TE>
<TE>   This point, however, was sometimes lost in the recent debate over
Parks, as partisans swapped attacks on one another's reform credentials.</TE>

<HD>Battered Wife Will Get Parole in Murder</HD>
<DH>Prisons: Davis agrees for just the second time to free a killer.
Woman shot her husband in 1985.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis agreed Wednesday to grant parole to a woman who
said she killed her husband because he abused her--only the second time
in 84 cases that Davis has moved to let a convicted murderer go free from
prison.</LD>
<LD>   The decision means Cheryl Sellers, 43, will be released from the
California Institution for Women in Corona in September 2003, the date
set by the state Board of Prison Terms. Advocates, who had mobilized
across the state on Sellers' behalf, said they hoped Davis' decision
would pave the way to free other inmates who killed their batterers.</LD>
<LD>   Sellers was granted parole in December by the parole board, which
concluded that battered woman syndrome drove her to kill Norman Sellers
19 years ago. Under the law, her case went to Davis, who had the power to
block her release--as he has done in 83 of 84 murder cases he has
reviewed as governor.</LD>
<TE>   In this case, Davis said that although Sellers "committed a grave
crime," she killed her husband "in reaction to the abuse and threats."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he said, the law did not allow testimony on battered woman
syndrome at the time of Sellers' trial, meaning the jury heard no such
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "The [parole board] determined Ms. Sellers would pose a low degree of
risk to public safety," Davis said in a statement. "Indeed, prior to the
life crime she had no criminal history. . . . She now accepts
responsibility for what she did and expresses remorse."</TE>
<TE>   In considering Sellers' parole, Davis faced a delicate political
quandary, caught between those who advocate a tough-on-crime stance and
women's groups that pressed for parole.</TE>
<TE>   Many groups lobbied for Sellers' release, among them the Legislature's
women's caucus and influential feminists. They argued that battered woman
syndrome drove Sellers to kill, that she had been an exemplary prisoner,
and that she had served enough time for the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis had these two large support groups opposing each other: the
keep-everyone-in-prison group and the women," said Barbara O'Connor,
director of the Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at Cal
State Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>Davis Denies Parole for Another Woman</TE>
<TE>   Sellers' supporters were gratified by the decision. "We're extremely
pleased," said Carrie Hempel, an attorney for Sellers. "There was
substantial evidence that she was battered by her husband. . . . It's the
right decision."</TE>
<TE>   But the prosecutor in the case, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty.
Susan Catalano, disagreed. Catalano said that at the time of the crime,
Sellers denied she had been beaten by her husband.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy may not have been the world's best person. I don't know,"
Catalano said in an interview Wednesday. "But he did not abuse her. And
he certainly didn't deserve to be shot."</TE>
<TE>   While he approved Sellers' release, the governor denied parole for
another battered woman inmate, Valere Boyd, 41, who shot and killed her
husband, Kermit Boyd, in Riverside County in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Sellers' case had attracted the most attention, and some
legislators cheered the news that she would be freed.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier), chairwoman of the Legislature's
women's caucus, stood outside the governor's office awaiting word on
Sellers' fate Wednesday evening. When she heard the news, she declared
herself thrilled.</TE>
<TE>   Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), who for years
has urged the early release of battered women inmates, said he hoped
Davis' action is "a harbinger of things to come for the many abused women
who are still awaiting a day of freedom."</TE>
<TE>   Sellers was convicted in 1985 of first-degree murder for shooting her
husband two years earlier as he lay in bed in their San Gabriel home. She
was sentenced to 25 years to life, with the chance of parole no earlier
than September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   At her December parole hearing, commissioners concluded that battered
woman syndrome drove Sellers to commit the crime. Their decision was
based on a parole board investigation that found she exhibited evidence
of "psychological, physical, sexual, economic and social [abuse] through
the victim's domination and control over her."</TE>
<TE>   Sellers told the commissioners that the abuse began on her wedding
night and continued throughout their four-year marriage. On one occasion,
she said, her husband shot her in the leg and refused to permit her to
seek medical attention. Another time, she said, he kicked her repeatedly
in the stomach, causing her to miscarry.</TE>
<TE>   Sellers shot her husband in the head, she told the board, after he
threatened to kill her young daughter and make her watch.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Catalano, however, disputed that account and said
Sellers had previously denied suffering physical abuse. She said the only
mental abuse Sellers mentioned was her husband's habit of saying his
former girlfriends were superior to her.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I thought her motive had to do with her losing her meal
ticket," Catalano said. "He had told her he wanted a divorce. . . . She
may very well have battered woman syndrome, but not as a result of this
man's actions."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say battered woman syndrome is a behavioral condition that
afflicts those who are systematically abused. Feeling powerless or
fearing reprisals, victims tend to stay in abusive relationships and may
ultimately see suicide or homicide as the only way out.</TE>
<TE>   Battered women in prison first drew attention in the early 1990s, when
advocates filed clemency petitions on behalf of 34 California inmates.
Then-Gov. Pete Wilson granted clemency to three of them and rejected 10.
Most are pending before the Davis administration.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the women hope the Sellers case will lead to freedom for
others who argue that they killed because of abuse. In 2001, 36 cases
were reviewed by parole board investigators, and 14 inmates were found to
have suffered from battered woman syndrome at the time of their crimes.
Of those, eight so far have been given parole grants by the board.</TE>
<TE>   But they must still win the endorsement of Davis. The only other
convicted murderer freed by Davis was Rose Ann Parker, who was freed
after the governor concluded that she shot her abusive boyfriend out of
fear for her life.</TE>
<TE>Some Lie to Conceal Murder, Prosecutors Say</TE>
<TE>   By releasing Sellers, the governor may blunt some of the criticism of
his record on parole. Shortly after his election, Davis said no murderer
would go free on his watch, and critics say he has pursued an illegal
blanket policy against parole.</TE>
<TE>   Later this month, the state Supreme Court will decide whether to
review a case involving a Calabasas man, Robert Rosenkrantz, that tests
the extent of the governor's authority over parole.</TE>
<TE>   The release of Sellers may also fuel debate over the use of battered
woman syndrome in legal cases. Some prosecutors argue that in some cases,
women fabricate stories of beatings as an excuse for coldblooded murder.</TE>
<TE>   At Sellers' parole hearing, for instance, Los Angeles County Deputy
Dist. Atty. Keith Thompson called battered woman syndrome "a bandwagon .
. . people are jumping on."</TE>
<TE>   "If there's credible proof, fine, a person deserves the credit,"
Thompson said in opposing Sellers' parole. "But when there is not any
credible proof, they don't."</TE>

<HD>Tijuana Chief, 40 Police Officers Held</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Army, federal force make the arrests as part of the
Mexican government's crackdown on drug- related corruption.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>The Tijuana police chief and about 40 other Baja California state
and local police officers were arrested by Mexican army units and special
federal police in a surprise operation at a Tecate police academy
Wednesday as part of the Mexican government's crackdown on drug-related
corruption.</LD>
<LD>   Details of the morning raid remained sketchy, but Baja California Gov.
Eugenio Elorduy Walther confirmed the operation at a news conference. The
governor's office and the Tijuana mayor's office said Tijuana Police
Chief Carlos Otal Namur was among those arrested.</LD>
<LD>   The sweep is part of the intensifying war on narcotics traffickers
being waged by President Vicente Fox's administration. Several top drug
traffickers have been arrested in recent weeks, including Benjamin
Arellano Felix, chief of the so-called Tijuana cartel. His brother Ramon,
the cartel's top enforcer, died in a shootout with police in Mazatlan on
Feb. 10.</LD>
<TE>   Police corruption in Mexico is high on the list of obstacles to
winning the drug war, U.S. and Mexican officials say. All levels of
Baja's police forces--federal, state and municipal--are commonly thought
of as having been corrupted by drug cartels as well as by local dope
dealers.</TE>
<TE>   Many top-ranking U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials were
attending an Interpol convention in Mexico City today and were
unavailable for comment. But Elorduy Walther said the police were
apparently lured to the state police academy in Tecate on a ruse of
having their firearms checked and test results delivered.</TE>
<TE>   "We have asked the army and the federal prosecutors that the operation
be carried out with respect for human rights but that whoever has a dirty
record or proves to be a bad element, that justice be carried out
swiftly," he said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The police officers arrested were flown to Mexico City. It was not
clear late Wednesday how many army units and federal officers
participated in the raid.</TE>
<TE>   The bloody history of drug wars in Tijuana during the 1990s includes
shootouts between opposing police squads acting on behalf of rival drug
lords. One shootout occurred in 1994 when federal police officers tried
to arrest Javier Arellano Felix and a top lieutenant and were fired on by
a bodyguard composed of Baja state police.</TE>
<TE>   Mass firings of Mexican police officials have been made in recent
years, but mass arrests such as Wednesday's in Tecate are thought to be
unusual.</TE>
<TE>   The administration of President Ernesto Zedillo fired 700 federal
police in one swoop in 1996, including 60 in Baja. In early 1997, all 87
federal police officers assigned to Baja California were replaced after
the slaying of state prosecutor Hodin Gutierrez Rico in Tijuana.
Authorities had dismissed Gutierrez's police bodyguards a few months
before he was slain.</TE>
<TE>   The Tijuana cartel, as well as the so-called Juarez cartel, are known
to use Baja police forces as their private armies, say U.S. officials
involved in the drug war.</TE>
<TE>   Police corruption is not confined to Baja. U.S. officials now believe
that Ramon Arellano Felix was executed by Sinaloa state police acting as
proxies for the drug kingpin Ismael Zambada, Ramon's sworn enemy.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests in Tecate occurred near a 1,200-foot tunnel discovered in
February that was used by the Arellano Felix cartel to transport drugs
illegally across the border to the United States. The tunnel was
destroyed last week.</TE>
<TE>   "We reiterate our commitment that the actions we carry out in the
state be always against corruption and impunity so that Baja California
is a safe and peaceful place. To this we are committed and we have only
begun," Elorduy Walther said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Accused of Bid to Recruit Spy</HD>
<DH>Espionage: The Russian revelation, made while Putin is out of the
country, is seen as part of covert opposition to his foreign policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>Russian agents caught two CIA operatives trying to recruit a spy
from a top-secret Russian military installation, the KGB's main successor
agency, the Federal Security Service, said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In an unusual twist, the Russians also said the two agents, working
undercover as U.S. diplomats, had administered mind-altering drugs to the
recruit, which erased his memory for a long period.</LD>
<LD>   The Americans "used some psychotropic medications unknown to us . . ,
" a counterintelligence officer with the FSB, as the agency is known,
said in an interview on the ORT television network. He was not
identified, and his face was hidden in shadow. "But they did not take
proper account of human physiology, which resulted in his impaired
condition."</LD>
<TE>   After his memory returned, the would-be recruit cooperated with the
FSB and continued contacts with the alleged agents--who offered him large
sums of money in return for classified information, the Russians said.</TE>
<TE>   "We got involved at an early stage, which allowed us to thwart the
leakage of classified information," said a second anonymous
counterintelligence officer interviewed on state television. "After we
acquired enough data to finish the operation, a decision was made to stop
the U.S. intelligence activity."</TE>
<TE>   The spy case comes as anti-American sentiment is rising in Russia
toward the levels seen during the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's
1999 air war on Yugoslavia. Those levels were the highest since the end
of the Cold War. In six weeks, President Bush is scheduled to arrive for
a summit with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin.</TE>
<TE>   "At a time when anti-Americanism is raging in Russia, the release of
the information about U.S. intelligence activities on Russia's territory
is some sort of a covert opposition to President Putin and his foreign
policies on the part of Russian secret services," said Viktor A.
Kremenyuk, deputy director of Russia's independent USA-Canada Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything has been done in a very Russian style--no one has stepped
forth and openly criticized Putin for his policies toward the U.S., but
at the same time, the FSB has once again sided with the chorus in Russia
that is lashing out at the West in general and the USA in particular,"
Kremenyuk said.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview with The Times, a spokeswoman for the FSB,
who declined to be identified, confirmed the accusations against the two
diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   She identified one as Yunju Kensinger, a former third secretary in the
consular section of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, who is believed to have
already left Russia. The second diplomat was David Robertson, she said,
and he held an unspecified post in a U.S. Embassy in another former
Soviet republic. She said she could not provide further details,
including correct English spellings of their names.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Moscow refused to comment on the
case; he also refused to confirm whether a diplomat named Kensinger had
been stationed there.</TE>
<TE>   According to news reports, the would-be recruit, a Russian named
Viktor, works at a secret Russian rocket facility. The reports said he
made a business trip to the second unidentified ex-Soviet republic, where
he was found in an impaired state by local police, who took him to the
Russian Embassy.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities sent him to the FSB in Moscow. The intelligence agency
determined that he had been given psychotropic drugs for so long that he
could no longer recall his name.</TE>
<TE>   After recovering his health, the Russian reports said, the recruit
resumed contact with the U.S. diplomats, who sent him an encrypted letter
asking him to place two classified documents at special "drop spots" in a
Moscow park in return for $15,000. The news reports included footage of
the letter, one alleged drop spot and the bundles of $100 bills allegedly
left in payment.</TE>
<TE>   The news reports said the case began a year ago, but they did not say
when it ended or when the diplomats might have left.</TE>
<TE>   The case is the first involving U.S. diplomats since March of last
year; the United States expelled about 50 Russian diplomats from
Washington, and Russia retaliated with a similar expulsion of U.S.
diplomats from Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some forces interested in preventing any further
rapprochement between Russia and the USA," said Alexander A. Konovalov,
president of the independent Institute for Strategic Assessment in
Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   "For instance, it would be rather logical to assume that the Russian
secret services would not like to see Russia and the USA establish closer
relations. And it is also logical to believe that they may have chosen a
moment in time like this one--right before the U.S.-Russia summit--in
order to influence the president and influence the sentiments of the
Russian public," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Putin was on a visit to Germany on Wednesday, and Foreign Minister
Igor S. Ivanov was to meet with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell in
Madrid today.</TE>

<HD>Global Court Near Despite U.S. Rebuff</HD>
<DH>Law: A permanent international criminal tribunal is to be ratified
today. Bush admini- stration may 'un-sign' treaty that set it up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>The United States is dead set against it, and its most optimistic
advocates had long thought it would be many years before judges called
the new court to order.</LD>
<LD>   But today, the International Criminal Court, the first global tribunal
since the World Court set up shop in the Netherlands a century ago, is to
be ratified in a ceremony here by more than the required minimum of 60
U.N. member states, a group including most leading U.S. allies.</LD>
<LD>   Within 12 to 18 months, legal experts say, magistrates from around the
world will assemble in the court's temporary quarters in The Hague and
begin examining charges of war crimes, genocide and other offenses
"against humanity" punishable by sentences in the court's own jails.</LD>
<TE>   But the Bush administration says it wants to ensure that U.S. citizens
will never appear in the court, which it fears could be used for
politically motivated prosecutions of U.S. troops or officials stationed
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to dramatize its opposition, the administration is planning
to take the highly unusual step of "un-signing" the international treaty
that sets up the court, annulling the signature of President Clinton in
December 2000, U.S. officials said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>Washington Plans to File a Revocation</TE>
<TE>   Formal notification of Washington's revocation will be filed at U.N.
legal offices within a week or two, said the officials, who asked not to
be identified. Pierre-Richard Prosper, the U.S. ambassador at large for
war crimes, said in New York last month that the administration was
considering "un-signing" as one of its options.</TE>
<TE>   American critics of the administration's plan note that it will strip
the United States of its rights as a signatory to participate in the
selection of judges and cases but won't stop the court from coming into
being.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe un-signing would be a silly and petulant act that will
have no effect in stopping the momentum that has spurred this institution
forward," Richard Dicker, director of the international justice division
of Human Rights Watch, said Wednesday. "There has been a sea change
against the impunity all too often associated with these horrific crimes.
What the Bush administration decides to do in the near future will not
derail that--it will simply put the Bush administration on the wrong side
of history."</TE>
<TE>   The court can prosecute only nationals of countries that have ratified
the treaty.</TE>
<TE>   Ratifying nations can avoid prosecutions of its citizens in the
international court by undertaking their own domestic legal action
against the accused. The U.N. Security Council can override such action
by referring cases to the court, but U.S. veto power in the council
should prevent abuses against U.S. nationals, the court's advocates say.
The council can also mandate suspensions of International Criminal Court
trials.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Senate was never expected to even consider ratification
without a strong push from the executive branch. But as long as the
treaty remains signed, Senate Democrats who support the court retain the
option of submitting the treaty for debate and possible ratification.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. legal experts say there is no precedent for the removal of a U.N.
treaty signature, a contention the State Department doesn't challenge.</TE>
<TE>   But the administration, backed strongly by Republicans in Congress and
conservative foreign policy analysts, believes that the court as now
constituted is irredeemably flawed.</TE>
<TE>   Some veteran U.S. diplomats have warned about the politicization of
previous U.N.-affiliated human rights forums and institutions, where
divisive issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can come to
dominate proceedings to the exclusion of other problems.</TE>
<TE>   In January, President Bush signed into law a defense appropriations
measure forbidding military funds from being used "to cooperate" with the
International Criminal Court. Senate and House leaders are meeting in
conference committee this week to draft a joint version of a proposed
American Servicemembers' Protection Act, which could restrict military
aid to countries participating in the court (with an exemption for North
Atlantic Treaty Organization members and a few other key allies).</TE>
<TE>   The bill as passed in the House would ban U.S. participation in U.N.
peacekeeping missions unless American personnel are specifically and
"permanently" exempted from war crimes prosecutions by the court.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration had opposed several provisions of the
treaty as it was adopted at an international conference in Rome four
years ago. Joined by Israel and China, the only other open dissenters,
the U.S. voted against the final document. But to preserve U.S. influence
over the new court, Clinton signed the treaty Dec. 31, 2000, three weeks
before he left office and the last day on which signing was permitted.</TE>
<TE>   From the start, the principal U.S. objection was that the court would
be legally autonomous and independently funded, with links but not
subservience to the Security Council. Washington wanted member states to
have individual veto power over cases involving their own nationals, a
proposal roundly rejected in Rome. Such a provision could have, in
effect, blocked prosecutions similar to those now underway against former
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and former Rwandan leaders,
supporters say.</TE>
<TE>   "That would cripple the court," Philippe Kirsch, the Canadian diplomat
who chairs the U.N. committee charged with setting up the new tribunal,
said here Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We would all like to see the U.S. on board, " he added. "But its
absence is not going to prevent the court from functioning, because the
court is supported by many states, including all U.S. allies."</TE>
<TE>Ratification Was Expected to Take Longer</TE>
<TE>   When the court treaty was adopted in Rome, most experts thought it
would take about a decade for the required 60 countries to ratify it in
their parliaments, a process that in many cases involved extensive
rewriting of other statutes. But as of last week, 56 states had
subscribed, and today the United Nations will receive ratifications from
10 more. So far, 139 countries, including the United States--for
now--have signed the treaty.</TE>
<TE>   On July 1, U.S. opposition notwithstanding, the treaty establishing
the court will formally come into effect. The treaty is not retroactive;
the court can prosecute only new alleged rights violations, and advocates
say they hope that its mere presence may act as a deterrent.</TE>
<TE>   Signatory countries will meet here in September to begin selecting
judges, and the court could start operating at its interim offices as
early as next spring, Kirsch and other experts say. "The statute creating
the court is an extremely watertight document, with all kinds of
safeguards to ensure that the court will be a legal instrument and not a
political instrument, which is, I think, the underlying U.S. concern,"
Kirsch said.</TE>
<TE>   The court is backed by virtually every U.S. human rights organization,
as well as many liberal church groups. The decade-long international
campaign to create the court has been underwritten in large part by
leading U.S. philanthropies, from the Ford and MacArthur foundations to
George Soros' Open Society Institute. But its U.S. opponents include the
top brass of the Pentagon, the Republican congressional leadership, the
National Security Council and, most important, Bush himself.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a new national Roper poll released Wednesday showed that most
Americans--61%, according to the survey--had never heard of the
International Criminal Court. Told that "over 100" countries favor the
court's creation but that the U.S. does not, 57% of those polled said the
U.S. should support the court and 37% said it shouldn't, according to the
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, a court backer, which commissioned
the survey.</TE>

<HD>Military Draft in Germany Upheld by Highest Court</HD>
<DH>Europe: The ruling overturns a 1999 lower-level decision that one
conscript was within his rights to reject the compulsory service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>Germany's highest court ruled Wednesday that compulsory military
service is still legal and justified despite a considerably reduced
security threat to this nation since the end of the Cold War.</LD>
<LD>   The Constitutional Court also rejected claims that the draft violates
a citizen's right to equality under the law because only about one in
five German men is compelled to perform the nine-month service after
turning 18.</LD>
<LD>   Germany's army has been in the process of downsizing since 1990, when
West Germany's reunification with East Germany erased the tense and
heavily fortified inter-German border at the same time it swelled the
ranks with conscripts.</LD>
<TE>   But Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's governing Social Democrats as well
as the main opposition party, the conservative Christian Democratic
Union, argue that conscription remains the best guarantee of keeping
Germany's military anchored in democracy and civil society.</TE>
<TE>   They also note that the draft, which accounts for about one-third of
the 300,000-strong army, remains a more affordable alternative to an
all-volunteer defense force.</TE>
<TE>   About 90,000 recruits are summoned each year, or about 22% of the
eligible age group. An additional 120,000 who are called up opt instead
for civilian service, which provides workers for hospitals, retirement
homes and public works.</TE>
<TE>   The high court ruled that justification for the draft can range beyond
the need for immediate resistance to a military threat, including
Germany's responsibility as a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to assist in alliance actions.</TE>
<TE>   The Karlsruhe-based court concluded that the complex considerations of
risk assessment, recruitment costs and democratic influences were all
matters best left to the government and Parliament to decide.</TE>
<TE>   With its ruling, the court overturned a 1999 decision of the
Brandenburg state court in Potsdam that draft dodger Volker Wiedersberg
was within his rights to reject both conscription and civilian service
because democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe had sharply reduced the
risk of a military invasion.</TE>
<TE>   Wiedersberg, who could still face punishment once his prosecution
resumes, shrugged off the high court decision as far from the end of the
matter.</TE>
<TE>   "This issue is not going to disappear. It's only been put off," he
told reporters in Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Britain, France and Italy have switched to professional, all-volunteer
armies, but Germans still marginally favor retaining a draft as a means
of preventing any reversion to the aggressive militaristic strivings of
the past. A poll by the Emnid group published this week by the daily Die
Welt showed 51% of German respondents in favor of keeping the draft and
45% opposed.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder told an annual assembly of army officers this week in his
hometown of Hanover that conscription will be enshrined in his party's
platform as he campaigns for reelection in September.</TE>
<TE>   But the environmentalist and pacifist Greens, who are coalition
partners of Schroeder's Social Democrats, oppose continued conscription,
as do the liberal Free Democrats and the former Communists of the Party
of Democratic Socialism. That has made the subject an awkward point of
divergence for Schroeder's party, both with his current governing
partners and with the liberals who are seen as the likely junior party in
the next government.</TE>
<TE>   German conscripts are increasingly being used to guard domestic
defense installations while troops with longer service commitments and
more extensive training take part in international missions abroad,
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping noted at the Hanover gathering Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Germany now has 10,000 soldiers taking part in foreign peacekeeping
missions, including the United Nations-mandated force in Macedonia that
is under German command and the multinational deployment trying to
improve security in Kabul, the Afghan capital.</TE>

<DL>ISABELA, Philippines
</DL>
<LD>Three Philippine senators launched an investigation Wednesday into
alleged rights abuses during a military offensive against Muslim
extremist rebels holding an American couple hostage.</LD>
<LD>   Residents tearfully described alleged illegal arrests and killings
during a crackdown last year on Abu Sayyaf rebels and supporters on the
island province of Basilan.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Gen. Roy Cimatu, who heads government forces waging an offensive
against the Al Qaeda-linked rebels, responded that troops were under
strict orders to uphold human rights and that the military was looking
into complaints.</LD>
<TE>   No accusations have been made against U.S. troops who arrived in
January for a training exercise aimed at helping local troops wipe out
the Abu Sayyaf.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw my son half-buried in the ground; he was deformed, almost
unrecognizable," Anissa Angulo told members of the Senate committee on
justice and human rights in a public hearing.</TE>
<TE>   A report by the government's Commission on Human Rights cited
witnesses as claiming that her son, Elnie, was arrested, tortured and
killed in September by Philippine marines who suspected that he was an
Abu Sayyaf rebel or supporter. His tongue and genitals were cut off, his
ribs fractured and his body hacked, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Dentist Manar Saliddin said army soldiers, accompanied by hooded
informants, arrested his brother and father in July. They were charged
with involvement in the kidnapping of 52 teachers, schoolchildren and a
priest by the Abu Sayyaf two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "My father asked for warrants. Nobody replied," Saliddin said, wearing
a yellow shirt reading "Free Basilan 73," referring to the number of
Basilan residents allegedly arrested in the crackdown and now jailed in
Manila.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Francis Pangilinan, the committee chairman, said he would
recommend prosecution of military officers if the allegations were
proved.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is providing training and weapons to Filipino troops
who are battling the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas on Basilan and trying to
rescue missionary couple Martin and Gracia Burnham of Kansas and a
Filipino nurse.</TE>

<HD>Afghans to World: Send the Checks</HD>
<DH>Aid: Most of the $4.5 billion pledged has yet to arrive. Officials
seek funds for the army, police and infrastructure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai on Wednesday called on the
world community to make good on promises to help rebuild his country,
saying Afghans' expectations are very high but almost nothing has been
delivered.</LD>
<LD>   In the first meeting on how to implement pledges of $4.5 billion in
assistance, Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N. envoy to Afghanistan, called for
international donors to fund the country's police and army.</LD>
<LD>   That is the only way, Brahimi said, to guarantee security outside
Kabul, the capital, and lead Afghanistan toward peace and stability.</LD>
<TE>   Karzai called for big infrastructure projects, in particular roads, to
make the country economically viable and secure.</TE>
<TE>   The conference was held here amid growing calls from Afghan officials
for access to the aid, promised in Tokyo in January.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is critical for Karzai, whose leadership is supported by the
United States. Unless the money flows soon, and the population perceives
him as a powerful leader, Karzai risks losing out in a loya jirga--or
grand council--to be held in June to elect a transitional leader and
government.</TE>
<TE>   Brahimi's call on the world community to help pay for a national army
and viable police force outside Kabul follows a series of security scares
in Afghanistan: a bomb attack in Jalalabad two days before, apparently
aimed at assassinating Defense Minister Mohammed Qassim Fahim, and
several incidents in which international forces have been fired on in
Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Nine suspects have been arrested in the bombing and the attacks on the
peacekeepers, officials said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We must acknowledge that, unorthodox as it might be to fund an army
and a police force, the establishment of a well-trained, properly
equipped national security force is an absolute priority right now,"
Brahimi said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the only way to bring about the security for which the people
of Afghanistan yearn and which is indispensable if this country is to be
reconstructed."</TE>
<TE>   Security is a problem in most of Afghanistan, Brahimi said. Although
the International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF, and the Kabul
police run patrols day and night in the capital, warlords and their
militias largely still reign elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Most Afghans have not yet seen the dividends of peace," said Brahimi,
reminding the international community that the six-month term of Karzai's
government will soon be up.</TE>
<TE>   "The time has come for the international community to make good on its
promises made in Tokyo and write out its checks," he urged.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai said his country needs development projects that would provide
jobs, boost trade and help the economy.</TE>
<TE>   He warned the international community not to make the mistake of
neglecting the majority of Afghanistan's people, who live in remote
villages.</TE>
<TE>   "The reconstruction of roads is neglected, but when we speak to our
donor countries, no one is interested," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The government also needs international help in paying the salaries of
public servants, teachers and doctors who haven't received wages in
months, Karzai said.</TE>
<TE>   He also called for serious international support to help Afghanistan
stop opium production.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, the Wall Street
darling toppled last year amid rioting over food, has been charged with
weapons smuggling, his lawyer said.</LD>
<LD>   Cavallo was arrested last week on orders of a judge investigating

<DL>KILINOCHCHI, Sri Lanka
</DL>
<LD>The Tamil Tiger chief, one of South Asia's most wanted men, made
his first public appearance in 15 years on Wednesday, emerging from a
jungle hide-out to say he will not yet abandon the fight for an
independent state.</LD>
<LD>   "The struggle for political independence is the demand of Tamil
people," said the reclusive rebel leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran.</LD>
<LD>   Still, he insisted that his Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are
"sincerely and seriously committed to peace," as demonstrated by their
declared cease-fire in the 19-year-old separatist war.</LD>
<TE>   Prabhakaran also expressed confidence that a Norwegian-mediated peace
process will succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time a third party or government has involved
itself in facilitating the peace process," Prabhakaran said of the more
than two years of Norwegian efforts that culminated in a cease-fire
agreement Feb. 22.</TE>
<TE>   "With the mediation help by the Norwegian government, I believe this
process will succeed this time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Prabhakaran's Tamil Tigers have been fighting government forces since
1983 to create a separate homeland in northern and eastern Sri Lanka. The
civil war, one of Asia's longest, has cost more than 64,000 lives.</TE>
<TE>   Flanked by guards in camouflaged body armor and armed with automatic
rifles, Prabhakaran addressed the news conference at a secret location
near rebel-held Kilinochchi, about 175 miles north of the capital,
Colombo.</TE>
<TE>   Journalists underwent six hours of security checks before being
allowed in, with the guerrillas searching between toes and in mouths, and
checking pens and notebook pages.</TE>
<TE>   Cleanshaven and dressed in a gray safari suit instead of his trademark
battle fatigues and pistol, Prabhakaran spoke in the Tamil language and
his remarks were translated by an aide.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels and the government of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe
are scheduled to hold peace talks next month in Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   But Prabhakaran said Wednesday that there will be no talks until the
government lifts a ban on his group, which has been declared a terrorist
organization in six countries, including the United States.</TE>

<LD>A U.S. soldier charged with murder in the drowning of her two young
children suffered from mental illness but knew she was doing wrong, a
forensic psychiatrist told a court-martial.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Park Dietz, a witness for the prosecution, said the primary motive
of Spc. Lillie Morgan, 22, was to hurt her husband, who she thought was
cheating on her.</LD>
<LD>   "She knew she was drowning her children," Dietz testified, disputing
defense claims that Morgan was too disturbed to understand her actions.</LD>
<TE>   Morgan, of Marksville, La., has admitted to drowning 3-year-old Joshua
and 2-month-old Jazmin on Sept. 18 in her family's apartment in a
military housing complex in Hanau, near Frankfurt.</TE>

Vatican and Russia's dominant Orthodox Church.</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. Stefano Caprio, who has lived in Russia since 1989, said
passport officers ripped up his visa as he left Moscow on Friday for
Italy. Caprio said by phone that he was refused a new visa and was told

</DL>
<LD>A six-year study of the 1995 massacre of thousands of Muslims by
Bosnian Serb troops in the "safe zone" of Srebrenica spread
responsibility for the debacle among the Dutch government, its army
commanders and the United Nations.</LD>
<LD>   More than 7,000 Muslim boys and men in the U.N.-declared safe haven
were killed during one ferocious week of bloodletting in July 1995. Most
were slain after being caught trying to flee the Bosnian Serb onslaught,
but many were killed after being taken from a Dutch-staffed U.N. base
where they had been promised protection.</LD>
<LD>   The 7,600-page report, commissioned by the Dutch government, said no
evidence was found to link the Serbian leadership in Belgrade, the
Yugoslav capital, to the killings.</LD>

<HD>Mexican Mayor Charged With Murder in Corruption Scandal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TLALNEPANTLA, Mexico
</DL>
<LD>The mayor of a Mexico City suburb and three other people have been
charged with murder in the death of a young city councilwoman who was
delving into protection rackets, drug trafficking and rigged city
contracts, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Juan Antonio Dominguez of Atizapan was charged with murder,
extortion, engaging in organized crime and fraud in connection with the
Sept. 5 shooting death of Maria de los Angeles Tames, 27.</LD>
<LD>   Tames had been openly critical of city contracts and land-use
policies, and was gathering evidence of wrongdoing to turn over to
investigators, her family has said.</LD>
<TE>   At a news conference in Tlalnepantla, another Mexico City suburb near
Atizapan, Atty. Gen. Alfonso Navarrete Prida of the state of Mexico said
Tames was killed because she had uncovered a complex and far-reaching
"web of corruption" in City Hall, and was about to expose it.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, it took the death of a person to bring us to know
about this criminal activity," Navarrete said. Tames' father, Pedro, an
administrator at the Notimex news agency, sat on the dais next to
Navarrete during the news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Also charged in the case were the mayor's former personal secretary,
Daniel Garcia; the city's public works chief, Javier Sanchez Garcia; and
the alleged triggerman in the slaying, Jaime Ortega Gonzalez. Dominguez
and his former secretary are in jail; the other two suspects are
considered fugitives.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia lost his job as the mayor's secretary shortly before Tames was
killed, partly because of her complaints about city land-use practices.
His brother, Isaias Garcia, allegedly paid Ortega $33,000 to kill Tames.
She was shot five times with a .38-caliber weapon in front of the home
she shared with her parents.</TE>
<TE>   An arrest warrant has been issued for Isaias Garcia, but he is still
at large and has not been formally charged in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez's attorney Marcos Castillejos said he would probably seek to
have the case moved from a state to a federal court. "I do not completely
trust the independence of the local judiciary," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The case has generated controversy because of the extent of corruption
apparently pervading the town's local government and because of the youth
and idealism of the councilwoman.</TE>
<TE>   There have also been strong political overtones. The state government,
which is controlled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has
been accused of using the probe to tar the National Action Party, or PAN,
to which both the mayor and the slain councilwoman belonged. The PRI
ruled Mexico for more than seven decades before PAN's Vicente Fox won the
presidency in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Navarrete said the investigation included previous Atizapan mayors,
and singled out Carlos Madrazo Limon, who is now a federal senator
representing the PAN.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview, Madrazo said he supported the Tames
investigation, and criticized the state government for making
insinuations about him. Instead, he said, investigators should be looking
into evidence of corruption in the state of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Navarrete said evidence exists of wide-ranging organized crime in
Atizapan, a wealthy bedroom community northwest of the capital, including
a racket run by police in which bars paid up to $40,000 a year for
protection from prosecution on prostitution and drug charges.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez allegedly took out $900,000 in low- or no-interest personal
loans from the city coffers, which he lent out at high interest rates,
Navarrete said.</TE>
<TE>   State officials also charged that criminals linked to Dominguez,
Garcia and fugitive Police Chief Antonio Vega de la Garza wiretapped
Tames and other city council members, and that city contracts were rigged
so that associates of Dominguez and Garcia were sure to win.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before she was killed, Tames uncovered a city contract to a
sham cleaning company, with payments allegedly siphoned off by corrupt
officials, her father told The Times in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   After Tames was killed, other city council members and witnesses were
either threatened with death or offered bribes to keep quiet, the
attorney general said.</TE>

<HD>Assault Leaves Camp Cut Off From Aid</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Efforts to get relief to Jenin, where the fighting was
deadliest, are harrowing. Israeli bulldozers move in.</DH>

<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALEM, Israel
</DL>
<LD>On a ridge along the Green Line between Israel and the West Bank, a
small crowd of Palestinians gathered in a dusty parking lot Wednesday to
plot a clandestine mission.</LD>
<LD>   They were waiting for Israeli soldiers, who were patrolling the line
within earshot, to move on so they could sneak three truckloads of food,
clothing, medicine and mattresses over dirt roads to thousands of
Palestinians from the shellshocked refugee camp outside Jenin.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli army's weeklong tank and helicopter assault on armed
militants in the refugee camp seven miles from here, the deadliest battle
of its 13-day-old West Bank offensive, is all but over. But the struggle
to help the survivors and count the dead--feared to number in the
hundreds--is just beginning.</LD>
<TE>   On one side are international and Palestinian relief organizations,
plus foreign journalists trying to report the battle's scale. On the
other side is the Israeli army, which a week ago declared the area a
"closed military zone" and was still on a war footing Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle are 12,000 camp dwellers, the bulk of them now homeless
and an undetermined number of them wounded. The camp was first settled by
refugees from past Middle East wars who are now on the move again,
seeking shelter elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "We are having to smuggle supplies to those people, because it seems
that the Israelis don't want them to get it," said Younis Younis, 33, an
Israeli Arab computer engineer who was helping to coordinate the relief
effort in the parking lot of this Israeli Arab village. "The Israelis are
trying to punish our people."</TE>
<TE>   Israel says it launched the campaign to end a wave of suicide bombings
that has terrified the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers unloaded bundles from pickup trucks so they could be hauled
in smaller, less conspicuous tractor-drawn carts over the rugged terrain
of the open valley below. The destination was Rummaneh, a village between
here and Jenin where more than 600 people from the refugee camp have
arrived this week.</TE>
<TE>   From the ridge, the distant battle appeared to be over.</TE>
<TE>   In the past week, Israeli tanks and helicopter gunships have pummeled
the camp, overwhelming the fiercest resistance to Israel's offensive. The
camp was a densely packed settlement whose residents included hundreds of
armed Palestinian militants and many suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   The resistance collapsed Wednesday, a day after the militants'
deadliest strike--an explosion that killed 13 Israeli soldiers in one of
the camp's narrow alleys. About 300 residents surrendered, and Mahmoud
Tawalbeh, a 23-year-old leader of the Islamic Jihad group who
masterminded a number of suicide bombings, lay dead in the street.</TE>
<TE>   Most journalists trying to reach Jenin and the camp were barred by
Israeli soldiers at several checkpoints. An Associated Press photographer
who managed to drive through the camp Wednesday found the streets
deserted. He said he saw many building facades with wrecking-ball-sized
holes from Israeli shelling.</TE>
<TE>   Where the helicopters and tanks left off, the bulldozers took over.
Abu Rashid said he saw at least five bulldozers swing into action around
midday, knocking down the remains of damaged homes and opening wide,
dusty avenues between those left standing.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian sources said the death toll in the camp could exceed that
for all other parts of the West Bank since the offensive began. The
Palestinian Red Crescent said 128 Palestinians had been killed so far in
the offensive; the Israeli army put the number at 200 Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "In Jenin, people talked about 500 people killed in the camp," said
Bertrand Bainvel, UNICEF's coordinator in the Palestinian territories. "I
can't tell you whether it's reliable or not."</TE>
<TE>   Thousands have fled. Fatih Zakarneh, a doctor at Amal hospital in
Jenin, said about 2,000 people had passed by his hospital in search of
shelter in the last three days. But people have also left the camp in
other directions.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of fighting-age men from the camp, rounded up by the army and
freed after security checks, have been banished from greater Jenin until
the occupation is over. The army has trucked many of them to Rummaneh and
another village, Zbouba.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to get relief to those in Jenin or still trapped in the camp
have been harrowing.</TE>
<TE>   It took the International Committee of the Red Cross six hours to
manage the evacuation Monday of three seriously wounded people from the
camp because Israeli soldiers stopped the ambulances at each checkpoint
and forced their Palestinian drivers to lie on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   That evening, the Red Cross succeeded in arranging a cease-fire
agreement with the Israeli civil administration in the West Bank so
ambulances could bring out a larger number of wounded the next day. But
when Red Cross delegates arrived Tuesday morning, the Israeli army
refused to let the ambulances enter the camp or the city, an agency
spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   No ambulances even tried to get to Jenin on Wednesday, but the Red
Cross delivered water and food, as well as a generator for the government
hospital, which had run out of electricity Tuesday evening.</TE>
<TE>   A UNICEF convoy also reached Jenin on Wednesday, bearing tents,
blankets, kitchen utensils, beans, rice, flour, bread and powdered milk
for babies. But it had to turn around at an army checkpoint about 200
yards short of its designated drop-off point.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli army spokesman said relief convoys had been thwarted by
ongoing fighting, not by an intent to stop the humanitarian aid. He said
the military operation in the camp was in its final stages.</TE>
<TE>   The army had also surrounded three refugee camps on the edge of
Nablus, the West Bank's largest city. After heavy predawn shelling,
soldiers moved into the Al Ain camp at dawn and rounded up about 400
fighting-age men and teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said Mutasem Omar Ayyad, 16 and unarmed, was one of the
first to come out but was shot to death. The Israeli army offered no
explanation for the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Others who surrendered lined up along the camp's main street, facing
an army checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   After being put up against a wall and frisked, the detainees were led
into an open-air compound, manacled and forced to squat for hours.
Finally, they were driven to an army base for security checks.</TE>

<HD>Quartet of World Powers Demands an End to 'Senseless' Fighting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MADRID
</DL>
<LD>In the city where the current peace process was born 11 years ago,
a quartet of world powers called Wednesday for an immediate end to
Israel's military operation in the West Bank and for both Israelis and
Palestinians to stop "this senseless confrontation."</LD>
<LD>   Ranking officials from the United Nations, the United States, the
European Union and Russia huddled in crisis session here to discuss the
escalating Mideast violence and issued a tough joint statement that also
warned of the growing risk that the fighting will ignite a wider regional
conflict.</LD>
<LD>   "Believing that there has been too much suffering and too much
bloodshed, we call on the leaders of Israel and the Palestinian Authority
to act in the interests of their own people, the region and the
international community and to immediately halt this senseless
confrontation," they said in the statement, read at a news conference
here.</LD>
<TE>   The four parties specifically called for a meaningful cease-fire to
end the worst fighting in a generation between Israelis and Palestinians
and for a full Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian cities, including an
end to the siege of Yasser Arafat's headquarters in Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   The quartet then called on the Palestinian Authority president to make
the "maximum possible effort" to stop the terrorist attacks on Israel and
to immediately take all possible steps to dismantle the terrorist
network, end the incitement to violence and block financing of extremist
groups.</TE>
<TE>   In a message to the militant groups behind the Palestinian assaults,
the statement condemned suicide bombings as "illegal and immoral" and
warned that the tactic was doing grave harm to the Palestinians'
aspirations to achieve their own state.</TE>
<TE>   The four parties warned both sides that "there is no military solution
to the conflict."</TE>
<TE>   They also offered full backing for Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell's high-stakes diplomatic mission to Israel, adding important
international leverage and new momentum to his mediation, scheduled to
begin Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But the difficulties ahead for Powell were underscored Wednesday by
yet another suicide bombing, this time in Haifa, that killed eight
Israelis and injured 14. Shortly afterward, the Israeli Cabinet announced
that its 13-day military operation would continue, according to Israel
Radio.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was quoted as calling Powell's
intention to meet with Arafat "a tragic mistake."</TE>
<TE>   After talks with Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Pique, Powell said
that his mission was "not in the least in jeopardy" because of Sharon's
comments and that it was important to meet with Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the leader of the Palestinian people, and I think the
Palestinian people and the Arab leaders with whom I've met over the past
several days believe he is the partner that Israel will have to deal with
at some point," Powell said at a news conference with Pique.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality," he added, "is that no other Palestinian or Arab leader
was prepared to engage until Arafat had a chance to express his views."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer spoke of
Sharon's refusal to comply with a demand by President Bush to withdraw,
saying, "Welcome to the Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   "The United States has no choice but to help, and help we will,"
Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it surprises the American people that this is a
challenge, that this is difficult, and that people in the region don't
simply stop, salute the United States and say, 'Yes, sir.' That is not
how diplomacy works. But it will not stop this president from doing
everything in his power to find ways to bring the parties together."</TE>
<TE>   The Madrid meeting with Powell included U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana and Russian
Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov.</TE>
<TE>   In blunt language, their statement called on Israel to refrain from
"the excessive use of force" and to do everything possible to protect
civilians. The two-page document was laced with references to
deteriorating conditions in the West Bank and the need for humanitarian
assistance for Palestinian civilians.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate statement, Annan said he was "frankly appalled" by the
situation in the Palestinian territories and appealed to Israel to stop
the damage and destruction to civilian and personal property.</TE>
<TE>   "None of us will know the full gravity of the situation until we gain
access to all territories that are now the theater of battle. I have a
sense that we will be shocked by what we see," the U.N. chief told
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Annan also called on Lebanon and all other relevant parties to take
steps to prevent cross-border attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas in southern
Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   Annan said he had talked to Syrian President Bashar Assad and Lebanese
President Emile Lahoud, who provided assurances that they were doing
whatever they could to hold down attacks along the border between Lebanon
and Israel.</TE>
<TE>   But Hezbollah fired about two dozen mortars and rockets across the
border into the northern Galilee on Wednesday. The guerrillas, who are
backed by Syria and Iran, have launched almost daily strikes against
Israel since the Jewish state's military incursion began.</TE>
<TE>   The Madrid stop is part of an orchestrated U.S. strategy to build
international and Arab support for Powell's mission before he lands in
Israel late today. Russia is a co-sponsor of the Mideast peace process
launched in Madrid in 1991, and the European Union has become
increasingly involved in the Mideast crisis. EU representatives tried to
see Arafat in Ramallah last week but were refused access by Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Angered over Israel's continuing campaign, the European Parliament in
Strasbourg, France, voted Wednesday on a nonbinding resolution to impose
trade sanctions on the Jewish state.</TE>
<TE>   The 269-208 vote precedes a meeting of foreign ministers from the 15
EU governments Monday in Luxembourg to discuss the crisis. A decision by
EU member nations, which buy 27% of Israel's exports, to adopt sanctions
could be a serious economic blow to the country.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Germany is preparing its own peace plan, which will be a
focal point of talks when the EU foreign ministers meet. Incorporating
ideas from plans put forward by the United States and the Arab League, it
calls for bold steps centered on the early creation of a Palestinian
state and an end to Jewish settlements on Palestinian territory, with an
international peacekeeping force to provide a buffer between the two
communities.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter published in two Arabic-language papers in London, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair said his country is prepared to assist in
monitoring any cease-fire.</TE>

<HD>Inmate Indicted in Hate-Crime Deaths</HD>
<DH>Law: Prosecutors say the man, jailed in Virginia in an unrelated
assault case, targeted the two female hikers in 1996 because he believed
they were gay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT L. JACKSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>With the filing of federal capital murder charges, law enforcement
authorities said Wednesday that they had solved one of the nation's most
egregious hate crimes against gays--the slayings of two young women in
the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia nearly six years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The deaths of Julianne Marie Williams, 24, and Laura S. Winans, 26,
attracted national attention because the two women were lesbians and
their bodies were found just off the Appalachian Trail, one of the most
popular hiking destinations in the country.</LD>
<LD>   Darrell David Rice, a Virginia prison inmate already serving time for
an unrelated assault and attempted abduction of a female bicyclist in the
same park, was indicted in their deaths by a federal grand jury.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Rice, 34, had targeted the two hikers because he
believed that they were gay. Their bodies were found June 1, 1996, beside
their tent in a secluded campsite about half a mile off the trail. Their
throats were slashed and their hands bound.</TE>
<TE>   Rice told fellow prisoners months ago that he "hates gays" and
intentionally selected women to attack "because they are more vulnerable
than men," authorities said. Since then, authorities said they have built
a case against Rice by collecting physical and other evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also quoted Rice as saying that Williams and Winans
"deserved to die because they were lesbian."</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, he could receive the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long and tedious investigation," said Lawrence Berry, a
spokesman for the Richmond, Va., FBI field office, which investigated the
slayings with the National Park Service. "We're certainly pleased it has
resulted in an indictment."</TE>
<TE>Case 'a Sad Reminder' of Violence, Group Says</TE>
<TE>   The case was heard by a federal grand jury because the slayings took
place in a national park.</TE>
<TE>   The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, which had urged a full
investigation of the slayings in 1996, expressed relief at "closure" of
the case but said it was "a sad reminder" of the pervasiveness of
violence against gays.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, reports of hate crimes against lesbians have increased in
recent years, according to FBI statistics, from 146 incidents in 1995 to
181 in 2000--a 24% increase.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' parents, Tom and Patsy Williams of St. Cloud, Minn., said
they were "grateful that a suspect has been apprehended and indicted."
They said, however, that they prefer to focus on the memory of their
daughter's life.</TE>
<TE>   The women, both experienced hikers, had worked as interns for
Woodswomen Inc., a Minneapolis-based group providing outdoor adventure
and education programs for women.</TE>
<TE>   Williams had graduated summa cum laude from Carleton College in
Minnesota, and Winans was finishing a degree at Unity College in Maine.
Friends said Winans had been developing a program to help victims of
sexual abuse find healing in the outdoors.</TE>
<TE>Attorney General Announces Indictment</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, who announced Rice's indictment, said that
the women's slayings denied the world their budding talents, "which would
have been substantial."</TE>
<TE>   "These families have suffered what Americans now know all too
well--the pain and destruction wrought by hate," Ashcroft told a news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   "The volatile, poisonous mixture of hatred and violence will not go
unchallenged in the American system of justice," Ashcroft said after
meeting with relatives of the victims.</TE>
<TE>   Rice, an inmate in the federal prison in Petersburg, Va., was charged
in a four-count indictment with capital murder and with "intentionally
selecting and murdering the two young women because of his hatred of
women and homosexuals."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. John L. Brownlee of the Western District of Virginia said
the slayings were "part of an ongoing plan, scheme or modus operandi to
assault, intimidate, injure and kill women because of their gender."</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest in the 1997 case for which Rice is now serving time,
investigators discovered hand and leg restraints in his truck similar to
those found on the hikers' bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Officials declined Wednesday to discuss why the case had not been
solved sooner.</TE>
<TE>   As officials tracked down more than 15,000 tips and leads in the
hikers' case, Rice made relevant comments in prison that "indicated that
he may have been involved," Brownlee said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said they also had evidence of Rice's "numerous physical and
verbal assaults upon randomly selected women, including . . . acts of
road rage, physical assaults, demeaning sexual comments and threats of
injury and death."</TE>

<HD>Facing Goose Eggs in Texas, Democrats Field Big Hitters</HD>
<DH>Politics: Ex-Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk heads a 'Dream Team' billed as
the party's best chance in years to top the GOP.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>When former Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk was chosen this week to run for
Senate on the Democratic ticket, a carefully crafted comeback strategy
went into effect for a party that has slumped dangerously close to
irrelevance in Texas politics.</LD>
<LD>   Kirk is one-third of a so-called "Dream Team," a racially diverse
triumvirate that Democrats hope will win back a portion of the party's
long-lost Lone Star eminence. As the first black man elected mayor in
what was long a famously segregated city, Kirk holds automatic sway with
minority voters. But, like gubernatorial candidate and borderland oil
baron Tony Sanchez, the former lobbyist is known as a socially centrist,
economically conservative candidate.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the best shot Democrats have had in a long time," Southern
Methodist University political science chair Calvin Jillson said.
"They're positioned here to make a comeback."</LD>
<TE>   The Kirk-Sanchez duo is rounded out by lieutenant governor candidate
John Sharp, a white and the state's former comptroller. "It's one of the
most exciting tickets ever in this state," Democratic chairwoman Molly
Beth Malcolm said. "It's real. It's made up of real people from all parts
of the state. A lot of times people look at the South and think we're
kind of backwards. We're going to show you we're not."</TE>
<TE>   Times have changed since the tumult of the civil rights movement
fractured the decades-old Democratic "solid South" and stripped the Texas
party of its former glory. These days, with every statewide elected
office in President Bush's home state held by a fellow Republican,
ethnicity is once again at the heart of the two-party power struggle.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say race politics are Texas Democrats' surest chance to get
back into business in a state marked by rapid ethnic evolution. The Texas
electorate is already more than 40% black and Latino--and Latinos are the
fastest growing portion of the population.</TE>
<TE>   Casting for a viable candidate to face Gov. Rick Perry, Texas
Democrats approached Sanchez, a savvy businessman who speaks flawless
Spanish, walks with the swagger of a borderland cowboy and made millions
in oil and banking. Sanchez agreed and began pouring his fortune into a
costly campaign to beat former state Atty. Gen. Dan Morales in a March
primary.</TE>
<TE>   Then the party looked to Kirk. His father was an Austin post office
worker; his mother an activist with the National Assn. for the
Advancement of Colored People.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1999 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Kirk recalled the
daily childhood journey from his black neighborhood to a newly integrated
school. He was teased in both places. "You felt like, ' . . . I'm too
black at school and not black enough at home,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the years before he was mayor, Kirk worked for then-Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen and moved on to become assistant city attorney and lobbyist for
Dallas. He was pulled into statewide office when former Texas Gov. Ann
Richards--renowned for her diverse appointments--named him secretary of
state.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk made history as Dallas' first black mayor--but radical social
reformer he wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   During his seven years at City Hall, Kirk pushed for a $125-million
stadium for the Mavericks and Stars, the city's professional basketball
and hockey teams. He plugged upscale downtown renovation and lobbied
unsuccessfully to bring the Olympics to town.</TE>
<TE>   "It was big-ticket, glamorous, signature projects," Jillson said.
"There was maybe not enough attention to the nuts and bolts of daily
life--streets and parks. He was not a black civil rights candidate."</TE>
<TE>   And that, analysts say, is just the point.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hardly a radical ticket," said Ed Martin, an Austin political
consultant. "It's a very mainstream ticket, an interesting mix of
people."</TE>
<TE>   Kirk is likely to face a particularly arduous and expensive fight.
With the Democrats clinging to Senate control by one seat, the position
left vacant by the retirement of Phil Gramm is of premium value to both
parties. Bush already popped home once to raise cash for state Atty. Gen.
John Cornyn, Kirk's Republican competition. And given the opportunity to
elect Kirk to a Senate that doesn't have a single black member, "the
money will be pouring in from all over," University of Texas political
scientist Bruce Buchanan said. "Nobody will lose for lack of spending."</TE>
<TE>   Due to sheer demographics, few analysts doubt that Texas politics will

<HD>INS Tried to Hide Elian Case Memo, Group Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI
</DL>
<LD>An internal Immigration and Naturalization Service memo surfaced
Wednesday indicating that the besieged agency may have ignored evidence
supporting the asylum request of Elian Gonzalez--the 6-year-old shipwreck
survivor who was returned to Cuba after months of political and legal
wrangling.</LD>
<LD>   A handwritten notation on the document released by Judicial Watch, a
conservative watchdog group, says that then-INS Commissioner Doris
Meissner ordered the memo destroyed the next day and decreed further
deliberations about the case not be put into writing.</LD>
<LD>   Arguments over what to do about the Cuban youngster--whose mother and
10 others died when their boat capsized during the journey from Cuba to
the United States in 1999--violently polarized the people of Miami.</LD>
<TE>   For many Cuban Americans, the memo has bolstered suspicions that Elian
was sacrificed for the sake of expediency. "The Clinton administration
was horrified of another refugee crisis, and they did everything possible
to accommodate Havana," said Frank Calzon, executive director of the
Center for a Free Cuba. "This is an example."</TE>
<TE>   Judicial Watch on Wednesday accused Meissner of obstruction of justice
and equated her with Arthur Andersen--the accounting firm that carried
out large-scale shredding of paperwork related to the collapse of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   The INS memorandum, dated Dec. 29, 1999, "evidences criminal activity
by a high-level government official," said Tom Fitton, president of
Judicial Watch. "You're not allowed to destroy this type of document."</TE>
<TE>   Meissner, who now works at the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace in Washington, did not return a call for comment.</TE>
<TE>   A copy of the memo somehow survived in the form of an e-mail and was
released by Judicial Watch in Miami. The group is representing INS
special agent Rick Ramirez, who has accused his agency and the Justice
Department of anti-Latino bias in dealing with Elian.</TE>
<TE>   The memo, written by INS attorney Rebeca Sanchez Roig, summarized a
discussion by Meissner and other INS officials about the Elian case. It
noted that Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, apparently had applied
at one time for a U.S. visa.</TE>
<TE>   When Elian was rescued at sea on Thanksgiving Day 1999 and temporarily
placed with Miami relatives, the government of Fidel Castro began a noisy
campaign to secure his return. His father joined in the chorus, but the
INS memo mentioned allegations that he was acting under Cuban government
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   If coercion were involved, the memo said, the INS could "potentially
accept" the asylum application filed on Elian's behalf by Miami-based
relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Mancha, an INS spokeswoman in Miami, said she would not
comment on the memo because of the ongoing litigation involving Ramirez.
Some INS officials, however, said that internal documents are destroyed
all the time and that the practice wasn't necessarily illegal.</TE>
<TE>   INS officials also said Wednesday that they could find no record that
Juan Miguel Gonzalez had ever sought a U.S. visa.</TE>
<TE>   On. Jan. 5, 2000, a week after the memo was written, Meissner
announced she had decided to return Elian to his father. Now 8, the boy
lives in Cardenas, Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   If the INS "had any indication that the father had applied for a visa
in the lottery, they should have pursued it and determined what the facts
were," said Jose Garcia Pedrosa, a lawyer who represented Elian's Miami
relatives. "They didn't."</TE>
<TE>   The INS has been under intense criticism for admitting the Sept. 11
hijackers to the United States, losing track of other foreigners targeted
for deportation and failing to control an illegal immigration population
that has ballooned to 8 million. On Wednesday, a House committee approved
a bill that calls for dissolving the agency and dividing its duties into
two--immigration enforcement and citizenship services.</TE>
<TE>   "If news reports are accurate, that directive to withhold documents is
extremely troubling," said Kendall Coffey, a former U.S. attorney who
worked on behalf of Elian's relatives. "It confirms the concerns of many
that a dramatic overhaul is needed at all levels of the agency if
commands like these could come from the top."</TE>

<LD>Nearly two dozen Amish men went on trial in Ebensburg for refusing
to put orange reflective triangles on their horse-drawn buggies.</LD>
<LD>   An Amish scholar testified that members of the highly conservative
Swartzentruber order consider the 16-inch safety symbol offensive.</LD>
<LD>   The state requires the triangles on all vehicles that don't exceed 25
mph. State police have issued citations to 22 men in the three years
since the Swartzentruber community arrived in central Pennsylvania from
Ohio. One man was jailed for three days after he refused to pay a $100
fine.</LD>

<LD>Two homeless shelters in Dallas received a $784,000 chunk of a
$2.65-million settlement won two years ago by apartment dwellers who were
illegally billed for water.</LD>
<LD>   Roger Mandel and Bruce Priddy filed the class-action lawsuit in 2000
on behalf of 18,000 apartment dwellers, accusing United Dominion Realty
Trust of Richmond, Va., of charging for water at apartments that did not
have metered service.</LD>
<LD>   The suit was settled that year with a provision for the money to go to
the Vogel Alcove and the Austin Street Centre. Mandel and Priddy split
$904,000.</LD>
<TE>   The Rev. Harry Dailey of the Austin Street shelter said he was
heartened to get money from two lawyers. "They could have pocketed it.

<HD>New Jersey Town Reels From a 2nd Deadly Gun Rampage</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police officer wounds his boss, kills five neighbors,
himself. In February, four others were fatally shot nearby.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>DOVER TOWNSHIP, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>For the second time in less than two months, a man with police
training has gone on a murderous rampage in this Jersey Shore
community--shooting five people dead before turning the gun on himself.</LD>
<LD>   Although the incidents are seemingly unrelated, residents in the
quiet, middle-class neighborhood of small ranch houses and backyard
basketball hoops were nonetheless shaken Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "It's weird," said Laura Epstein, 37, who moved here recently. "It's a
fairly nice place."</LD>
<TE>   According to police, Edward Lutes, a 15-year veteran of the nearby
Seaside Heights Police Department and a member of a regional SWAT team,
emerged Tuesday night from his two-story Colonial house with a gun in his
hand. He crossed the street, shot three neighbors in their home and then
fired on two more people in the house next to his.</TE>
<TE>   The dead were identified as Dominick Galliano, 51; his wife, Gail, 49;
their son Christopher, 25; Gary Williams, 48; and his wife, Tina, 46. The
Williams' son escaped by jumping out of a window. He injured his ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said that Lutes, 42, then took off in his 1995 Buick Regal
with a handgun and a semiautomatic weapon. More than 100 law enforcement
officers spent 12 hours searching for him. Streets were cordoned off with
yellow police tape. Area residents were warned there was a "dangerous
armed man on the loose." Rumors of what might be happening quickly spread
throughout downtown restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   "All the customers were coming in telling us that a cop went crazy,"
said Debbie Geiser, a waitress at a Denny's a few miles from Lutes' home.</TE>
<TE>   Lutes turned up early Wednesday morning at the home of his boss,
Seaside Heights Police Chief James Costello, and shot him three
times--twice in the wrist and once in the leg--police said. Lutes fled,
but soon was found in his parked car, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot
wound.</TE>
<TE>   From his hospital room, Costello said he was baffled by the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't know why," he told Associated Press. "He's a very
close friend of mine."</TE>
<TE>   Dover Township Police Chief Michael Mastronardy said Wednesday that
Lutes had been involved in an Oct. 30 criminal mischief case and that
there were other reports of neighborhood spats. But he also was portrayed
as a dedicated officer and friendly guy.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Mark Akalewicz, 39, said he often ran into Lutes when they
were both out walking their dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "He would say: 'How are you doing?' " Akalewicz said. About the
coincidence of two shooting sprees in such a short period of time, he
added: "There is no such place as Eden."</TE>
<TE>   There was some speculation Wednesday that Lutes, who lived with his
12-year-old daughter and other family members, still was reeling from the
death of a girlfriend in a car crash less than a year ago. Assistant
Ocean County prosecutor Greg Sakowicz said that, while authorities had
"suspicions about Lutes' motives," police were not prepared to speculate
about what set him off.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors still are searching for an explanation for the Feb. 21
killing rampage allegedly committed by John Mabie, a long-retired Newark
police officer who lived about a mile from Lutes.</TE>
<TE>   The 71-year-old Mabie, according to police, locked his wife in the
basement of their home and walked out the door with a .38-caliber
revolver. He first went down the street to his mother-in-law's house,
where he allegedly shot and killed 22-year-old Natalie Gingerelli, who
was said to be his favorite granddaughter. Then, police said, he went to
each of his next-door neighbors' homes, fatally shooting Sue Keiran, 42,
a single mother; Thomas Luyster, 27; and Luyster's fiancee, Suzanne
Lavecchia, 27. He then returned home and put down his pistol, authorities
said. He was arrested and remains in jail awaiting trial.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very saddening to me and troublesome," said Wayne Rupert of the
Ocean County Sheriff's Department. "In both cases, there was a traumatic
event that took place in the past that might have festered within both of
these police officers. But that really doesn't explain it for sure, does
it?"</TE>
<TE>   Mabie had been involved in the accidental death of a small child in
1971.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's shootings occurred in a community of about 90,000
residents, many of them retirees from New York City and northern New
Jersey. Across the bridge in Seaside Heights--which boasts one of the
busiest boardwalks on the Eastern seaboard--the population triples in
size every summer. But police work here mostly involves drunken revelers
and minor car accidents. A spokesman for the county of about 500,000 said
there usually are about a dozen murders a year.</TE>

<HD>Nevada Shuts Off Water to Proposed Nuclear Dump Site</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS
</DL>
<LD>Nevada made good Wednesday on a promise to shut off water to the
site of the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump, but the federal
project won't run dry.</LD>
<LD>   The Energy Department is using a newly built 1-million-gallon tank and
one small well for the site 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Department officials said the stored water, plus 400,000 gallons
stored in other tanks at the Nevada Test Site, should last several months
while scientists continue experiments and design work at the site.</LD>
<TE>   "We have a small window until this water issue begins to impede our
ongoing scientific work," said Joe Davis, spokesman for Energy Secretary
Spencer Abraham in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Stopping the water was Nevada's latest tactic to try to prevent the
federal government from storing nuclear waste at the site. The state has
filed three lawsuits to block the storage.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada State Engineer Hugh Ricci banned the Energy Department from
drawing water from all but one well after a temporary permit expired
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The state had also shut off water to the site in February 2000, but
the federal government sued and the water kept flowing. Yucca Mountain
averages less than 7 inches of precipitation a year.</TE>
<TE>   The case is pending before U.S. District Judge Roger Hunt in Las
Vegas. He heard last month from a Justice Department lawyer, who said the
Yucca Mountain project would be in "dire need of water" if Ricci denied
the permits.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci said the federal government was allowed water from one well
because documents filed Monday asserted the water was being put to
"beneficial use." The well provides up to 750,000 gallons a year.</TE>
<TE>   That amount is less than 1% of the 140 million gallons a year the
Energy Department has requested, Ricci noted.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, state lawmakers approved using up to $3 million in
emergency funds to lobby against the waste dump. The funds must be
matched by public or private sources before they can be used.</TE>

<HD>Bush Won't Delay Ban on Personal Watercraft</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration will not try to delay a ban on personal
watercraft scheduled to take effect April 22 in 13 national parks and
recreation areas.</LD>
<LD>   The ban is a result of a Clinton-era rule that set a deadline for
parks to either establish regulations governing the watercraft or impose
a blanket ban.</LD>
<LD>   Personal watercraft, familiarly known by the trade name Jet Ski, are
high-speed, gas-powered vessels designed to be ridden by one or two
people.</LD>
<TE>   So far, eight of the 13 parks, including Whiskeytown National
Recreation Area in California, have decided to ban the watercraft.
Superintendents at five other parks have decided some watercraft use
might be appropriate, but environmental assessments are still underway
and rules are being drafted at those parks, meaning they will be forced
to ban watercraft on April 22.</TE>
<TE>   The National Park Service had considered trying to push back the
deadline at the five parks where rules were being crafted, but it didn't
have the legal authority to do so, said Kym Hall, regulations program
manager for the Park Service.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to have to close temporarily," she said. "We didn't want
to have to do that, but we're going to have to."</TE>
<TE>   The Park Service plans to make an announcement today to explain the
reasons for the closures to the public. Eight other areas--including Glen
Canyon National Recreation Area in Arizona and Utah, and Lake Mead
National Recreation Area in Arizona and Nevada--have until Sept. 15 to
adopt rules for watercraft or ban them.</TE>
<TE>   The National Park Service has already prohibited watercraft use on 66
of the 87 bodies of water under its jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   Two factors could delay the April 22 ban.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge in Texas has been asked by a watercraft industry group
to stop the ban. The judge has scheduled a hearing for April 17.</TE>
<TE>   The House also could vote next week on a bill that would postpone the
ban until December 2004, although it is unlikely the bill will make it
through the Democratic-controlled Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Bosak of the National Parks Conservation Assn. said personal
watercraft are inappropriate in national parks.</TE>
<TE>   "These are places that Americans go to get away from the noise of
their everyday lives and hear the waves lapping against the shore without
hearing the incessant buzzing of the Jet Ski sound," Bosak said.</TE>
<TE>   But Monita Fontaine, executive director of the Personal Watercraft
Industry Assn., which sued the Park Service over the rule, called it
premature to act without environmental assessments.</TE>

<HD>Bush Presses for Cloning Ban</HD>
<DH>Science: President says the procedure is a 'step toward a society
in which human beings are grown for spare body parts.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>On a day tinged with warnings that biologists could misshape the
human race, President Bush on Wednesday urged a tentative Senate to pass
a total ban on human cloning, even if used as part of research into cures
for disease and disability.</LD>
<LD>   "Allowing cloning would be taking a significant step toward a society
in which human beings are grown for spare body parts, and children are
engineered to custom specifications. And that's not acceptable," the
president told about 175 lawmakers, religious activists, researchers and
disabled people in the East Room of the White House.</LD>
<LD>   He spoke of human "embryo farms" created by scientists to pursue
cloning research. And he warned that, even if cloning yielded cures for
disease, it "would create a massive national market" for women's eggs,
"and exploitation of women's bodies that we cannot and must not allow."</LD>
<TE>   The 15-minute speech marked the second time Bush has devoted a major
address to controversial advances in biology, a reflection of the speedy
pace of the science. In August, he devoted the first prime-time televised
speech of his term to the subject of embryonic stem cells, the medically
promising cells that come from dissected human embryos.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spoke as lobbying intensified in the Senate in preparation for a
vote on cloning, expected before the Memorial Day break in May.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of cloning for any purpose said Wednesday they brought
several hundred members of antiabortion and religious groups to
Washington to lobby lawmakers. But 40 Nobel Prize winners urged the
Senate to allow cloning as part of medical research, warning that a ban
"would impede progress against some of the most debilitating diseases
known to man."</TE>
<TE>   Cloning involves taking DNA from a donor, often from a skin or cheek
cell, and merging it with an egg cell that has been stripped of its own
genetic material. The result is an embryo with the same genetic makeup as
the donor, although there are no credible claims that any scientist has
produced a cloned human.</TE>
<TE>   Theoretically, a human embryo created this way could be placed in a
woman's uterus and grown into a child. This is called reproductive
cloning, and the Senate, House and Bush are united in supporting
legislation to make it a federal crime, subject to heavy fines and jail
terms.</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists want to create cloned embryos for another purpose.
Starting with a patient's DNA, they would create an embryo and dissect it
after five days for its stem cells. Those cells, in turn, might be grown
into replacement heart, brain or other cells, as the patient required.</TE>
<TE>   Cells created this way would presumably match the patient's genetic
makeup and might be readily accepted by the person's body, avoiding the
tissue rejection that is a major problem in transplants.</TE>
<TE>   But cloning to make stem cells and tissue, often called therapeutic
cloning, has drawn strong opposition from antiabortion groups and social
conservatives. They say destroying an embryo is equivalent to destroying
a child.</TE>
<TE>   In a lopsided vote last year of 265-162, the House voted to bar
cloning for any purpose, and Bush quickly praised the move. But the
Senate is sharply divided. About 40 senators are believed to favor a
total ban. An equal number are thought to back a proposal that would
outlaw cloning to produce children while preserving it as a tool of
medical research.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of therapeutic cloning could be on the verge of picking up
an important vote. As several lawmakers prepared Wednesday to file
legislation that would permit research cloning, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch
(R-Utah) placed a call asking them to hold off while he reviewed it with
an eye toward offering support, two people familiar with events said. The
measure would bar cloning for reproduction.</TE>
<TE>   Hatch is a conservative and abortion opponent, and his support could
draw other Republicans to the bill. His spokeswoman declined to comment
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's speech was aimed in part at senators who have announced no
position. It also won a warm response from social conservatives and
religious activists, who form a core part of the Republican voting bloc
and could be decisive in November's midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks, Bush cheered the medical advances expected to come
from deciphering the human genetic code. But he called for "restraint and
responsibility" in embracing the new powers of science.</TE>
<TE>   "We can pursue medical research with a clear sense of moral purpose,
or we can travel without an ethical compass into a world we could live to
regret."</TE>
<TE>   Citing three reasons to ban all human cloning, he said a partial ban
would be "unethical" because it would allow the destruction of embryos.</TE>
<TE>   "Research cloning would contradict the most fundamental principle of
medical ethics, that no human life should be exploited or extinguished
for the benefit of another," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Second, he said, therapeutic cloning would make cloned embryos "widely
available," and their use in reproduction would be inevitable. "Even the
tightest regulations and strict policing would not prevent or detect the
birth of cloned babies."</TE>
<TE>   And third, he said the research's benefits are "highly speculative."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of therapeutic cloning disputed some of the comments.
Michael West, chief executive of Advanced Cell Technology Inc. of
Massachusetts, said the promise of the technique was far greater than
Bush acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   "This technology is only a few years old, and it has already been
demonstrated that you can make neurons, blood-forming cells and others"
through cloning, said West, whose company was mentioned in Bush's speech,
though not by name, for its claim to have produced the first cloned human
embryo. "There is a very strong scientific case here. To say that this is
purely hypothetical is a gross misrepresentation of the facts."</TE>
<TE>   West also played down the idea that cloning would create a market for
women's eggs. He said people would donate eggs when a family member was
sick, much as they might donate a kidney today.</TE>
<TE>   Before his speech, the president met with three people who were left
partially paralyzed by accidents, and he singled them out in the audience
during his address. All three oppose therapeutic cloning, even though
they have the types of disabilities that advocates say might be helped.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the president had a good understanding and a grasp of the
facts, and doesn't make these decisions whimsically," said one, Steven
McDonald, after the speech. A New York police detective, McDonald, 45,
became a quadriplegic after a teenager shot him in the head.</TE>
<TE>   At a Capitol Hill rally, members of several religious groups warned of
the dangers of cloning.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Anderson, chief executive of the Knights of Columbus, called
therapeutic cloning "a form of biotech slavery." Richard Land of the
Southern Baptist Convention called it "high-tech cannibalism in which we
consume our young."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A new airline safety system created after the 1996 ValuJet crash
lacks well-trained inspectors and a timetable to expand the program to
all carriers, the Transportation Department inspector general said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The inspector general's report said the Federal Aviation
Administration has made some progress in setting up its Air
Transportation Oversight System, designed to focus on areas found to have
safety problems rather than on making sure airlines follow regulations.</LD>
<LD>   The system began in 1998, two years after a ValuJet DC-9 crashed into
the Florida Everglades, killing all 110 people on board. The National
Transportation Safety Board said a lack of FAA oversight was partly to
blame for the crash.</LD>
<TE>   The report said FAA inspectors have received minimal training. Many
inspectors are located far from the airline maintenance bases they are
supposed to oversee, and some had no training in the kinds of airplanes
they were supposed to check, the inspector general said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Prison Ranks Surge, States' Slow</HD>
<DH>Crime: The gap is likely to widen as federal officials broaden
their reach. California and others opt for treatment rather than jail for
drug offenders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>With convictions for drugs, guns and immigration offenses on the
rise, the size of the federal inmate population is swelling in record
numbers, as California and many other states are locking up fewer people,
according to a new federal study released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The split between the federal and state systems is likely to grow even
wider in years ahead because of changing strategies in law enforcement:
Federal officials are broadening their reach to lock up criminals once
outside their domain, but states such as California are opting to send
many drug offenders to treatment programs rather than prison.</LD>
<LD>   The result is that the federal prison population added an average of
more than 200 prisoners a week in the first half of 2001--the biggest
increase since statisticians began tracking data in 1977--while state
prison populations increased at their slowest rate in 28 years. In
California, the state prison population even decreased slightly after a
decade-long boom in the 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   "The federal system continues to grow, and grow quickly, but the state
systems in the aggregate are slowing down--and slowing down rapidly,"
Allen J. Beck, co-author of the Justice Department study, said in an
interview.</TE>
<TE>L.A. County Keeps Title of Biggest Local System</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County held on to its unenviable title as the biggest
local jail system in the country, with an average daily population of
more than 19,300 inmates, the study showed. That far eclipsed New York
City, with an average of 14,490 inmates, and Cook County, Ill., which
includes Chicago, with 10,212.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, 1 in every 145 U.S. residents--1.97 million--was locked up
in local, state or federal prisons on the day in mid-2001 that the
figures were tracked by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Other highlights from the report:</TE>
<TE>   * Privately run prisons, an increasingly popular alternative for
overburdened governments in recent years, saw inmate populations increase
nearly 5% nationwide, to about 95,000 inmates.</TE>
<TE>   * The prison populations for the largest state systems decreased for
the one-year period ending June 30, 2001. Texas was down 3,661 inmates,
California down 525 and New York down 2,553. For California, the 0.3%
decrease brought the number of prisoners down to 163,965 inmates, with
468 people per 100,000 serving sentences of more than one year.</TE>
<TE>   * Men continued to be locked up in prisons and local jails at far
higher rates than women, with 1,318 male inmates per 100,000 men in the
population at large. There were 113 female inmates per 100,000 women.</TE>
<TE>   * Racial and ethnic differences persisted. For men in their 20s and
early 30s, an estimated 12% of blacks, 4% of Latinos and 1.8% of whites
were in prison or jail. Incarceration rates for female inmates revealed
similar disparities, the study found.</TE>
<TE>   The most dramatic changes in the data occurred in the federal system,
where the number of prisoners grew to nearly 153,000, a 7.2% increase
over the previous year. The increase of about 7,400 prisoners over six
months earlier represented the single biggest jump in the federal system
since the Justice Department began tracking such data 25 years ago, Beck
said.</TE>
<TE>   Driving the trend, he said, are rapid increases in the last five years
in the number of people locked up for drug-related crimes--a group that
makes up about 60% of the federal prison population--along with inmates
convicted on weapon offenses and immigration violations. The numbers do
not include the more than 1,000 people taken into custody on immigration
offenses in the post-Sept. 11 crackdown on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government has moved aggressively in the last several
years to implement pilot programs for prosecuting felons caught with
guns, imposing stiff prison terms in cases that previously might have
generated lesser sentences if tried in state courts.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has also continued to add new crimes to the federal books, a
trend that even Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist has spoken out against
as a threat to the criminal justice system.</TE>
<TE>   The surge in federal prisoners "is another manifestation of the
growing presence of the federal government in crime control," said
Carnegie Mellon University criminologist Alfred Blumstein.</TE>
<TE>   "It's of significant concern, because crime control has always been a
state and local function, and over the last decade or so it's been moving
to the federal system as they've passed a whole variety of new laws,"
Blumstein said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>Experts Differ on Causes of States' Trend</TE>
<TE>   In state prison systems, meanwhile, the reversal of many years of
rising prison populations reflects the declining crime rates of the
1990s, most analysts agree. But experts differ over what other factors
may be causing the trend.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Ziedenberg, associate director of the Center on Juvenile and
Criminal Justice, a Washington group that supports alternatives to
incarceration, pointed to liberalized drug laws. He noted that judges,
lawmakers and voters in states around the country are beginning to send
more drug offenders to treatment centers instead of prison. Measures such
as Proposition 36, implemented by California voters last year, are likely
to intensify the trend, he and other legal analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that some people are now being diverted to treatment who
weren't being diverted before. Time will tell how many people that
ultimately affects," he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice
Legal Foundation, a victims' rights group in Sacramento, said he believes
that the stabilization of state prison numbers has been driven not by new
lenient sentencing policies, but by the wave of tougher measures
implemented years earlier, such as California's three-strikes law.</TE>
<TE>   Scheidegger said it is too early to judge the effect of drug treatment
sentencing measures. What is clear, he maintained, is that get-tough
measures are deterring crime.</TE>
<TE>   When California first passed its three-strikes law in 1994, analysts
"made the assumption that if you toughen sentencing, you'll have these
huge prison populations. That hasn't happened," he said. "The fact of the
matter is, when crooks fear that additional crimes will have severe
consequences, they curtail their illegal behavior."</TE>

<HD>Bush OKs Sweeping Changes for Top Posts of the Military</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush has approved sweeping changes at the top of the U.S.
military that will put in place a new generation of relatively
nonconformist officers who are likely to be more supportive of the
administration's goal of radically changing the armed forces, Pentagon
officials said Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   The changes will, among other things, for the first time put a Marine
in charge of U.S. military operations in Europe and Africa, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has worked for months on filling
the top command slots, which involve the chiefs of U.S. forces in every
region of the world except the Pacific, as well as the heads of two of
the four armed services. He has said he expects the moves to be one of
his most significant acts at the Pentagon.</LD>
<TE>   For two of the most important positions--the top military job in
Europe and the new head of the Army--Rumsfeld has selected independent
types who stand out among the current top brass as unconventional
thinkers who are likely to be supportive of his drive to "transform" the
military to better address terrorism and other new challenges, the
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The changes come as part of the normal rotation of the top slots in
the military. But Rumsfeld's decision to package them is a marked
departure from the usual practice of filling the jobs in a piecemeal
fashion, and underscores his goal of bringing radical change to the
military at a time when it is waging a global war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld has not disclosed to aides how and when he plans to
officially announce the nominations. But by reaching his decisions,
discussing them broadly within the administration and securing the
president's approval, Rumsfeld effectively has made lame ducks of current
holders of the positions.</TE>

<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>The space shuttle Atlantis docked at the International Space
Station Wednesday, its seven-member crew prepared to resume major
construction on the U.S. side of the orbiting outpost for the first time
in nearly a year.</LD>
<LD>   For the three men already living on the station, these were their
first visitors since an earlier shuttle crew left them behind in
mid-December, 117 days ago.</LD>
<LD>   "It's great to see these guys. They look wonderful and the station
looks like it's in great shape," shuttle commander Mike Bloomfield told
Mission Control after entering the orbiting laboratory.</LD>
<TE>   The combined crew of 10 astronauts will spend a week together in joint
operations, installing a new truss segment on the station, 44 feet of
what eventually will become a 360-foot span holding an acre of solar
panels to power future laboratories.</TE>
<TE>   Nine of the astronauts are American and one, station commander Yury
Onufrienko, is Russian.</TE>
<TE>   Atlantis astronaut Jerry Ross was the first to report sighting the
international station, the largest spacecraft ever to fly, from about 50
miles away.</TE>
<TE>   "ISS is in view," said Ross, a spacewalker on the Atlantis crew who
set a human spaceflight record Monday with his seventh launch into space.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>The son of Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt has been arrested in connection
with a teen-run fight club operating inside a Mormon Church gymnasium.</LD>
<LD>   Chase Leavitt, 18, was charged this week with battery, disturbing the
peace and trespassing. A 17-year-old was cited for assault and disorderly
conduct but has not yet been charged.</LD>
<LD>   The incident, which took place in December, came to the attention of
authorities because neighbors noticed that attendees arriving at the
church meeting house were being charged admission.</LD>
<TE>   The fights were advertised on fliers that had been passed out by
students from East High School, where Leavitt was a student.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Leavitt, a Republican, was supportive of his son, one of his five
children.</TE>
<TE>   "I have confidence in the process," Leavitt said. "He's a great young
man. His life is on track in every other way, he has the love and
affection of his father and mother and we'll work through this."</TE>
<TE>   The case has received national attention because it involved the child
of a public figure and because the problems associated with fight clubs
are increasing.</TE>
<TE>   "We are treating this as an average young person making a dumb
mistake," Simarjit Gill, Salt Lake City prosecutor, said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The incident took place on Dec. 14, when, according to a police
report, 50 to 80 high school-aged youths gathered inside a gym attached
to a church in Salt Lake City. Most of the teenagers fled when police
arrived, but officers found a video camera used to film the fights.</TE>
<TE>   Gill said the videotape shows Chase Leavitt hitting another fighter, a
minor. Both participants were wearing boxing gloves, but not protective
headgear, Gill said. "They were punching each other, taking shots. It was
a crowd of high school kids cheering them on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The two fighters were the first to be identified, said police
spokesman Sgt. Fred Lewis, adding that others may be charged after a more
complete review of the tape.</TE>
<TE>   Police say the teenagers were in the church without permission,
gaining entry with keys. Although the gymnasium was a "mess," according
to the report, with overturned chairs and beer or urine staining a
carpet, authorities from the church did not press charges. Lewis said he
did not know whether the teens were members of that particular church or
whether the building was simply a convenient venue.</TE>
<TE>   So-called fight clubs are increasingly popular among suburban youths.
Since the 1999 movie "Fight Club"--which depicted working-class men
pummeling each other bare-fisted in underground clubs--teens and others
have been promoting backyard bouts.</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of professional wrestling has also spurred a boom in
no-holds-barred fighting, events that sometimes offer cash prizes for
winning fighters. Often called extreme fighting, there are no referees or
judges and the objective is to hit the opponent until he submits or is
knocked out.</TE>
<TE>   The phenomenon is not unknown in Salt Lake City but police said this
was the first arrest made in a fight club case.</TE>
<TE>   "They are very popular with the kids," Lewis said. "Apparently they
have been going on for some time. Our concern is public safety of kids.
These are non-sanctioned fights. We want to send the message that we
don't condone this weekend combatants type of thing."</TE>
<TE>   Gill said the four-month lapse between the arrest and the charges was
part of a backlog created by the Olympics, which were held in Salt Lake
City in February. The investigation was complicated by the number of
people on the tape who have to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "The video didn't come with a witness list," Gill said.</TE>
<TE>   Police say the investigation is ongoing and further arrests are
anticipated.</TE>

<HD>Senate Rejects Closer Look at Energy Pacts</HD>
<DH>Derivatives: Proposal would have given lawmakers more oversight on
an Enron-related activity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Senate on Wednesday scuttled one of the first legislative
proposals sparked by the Enron Corp. meltdown, rejecting a bid to bring
the kind of energy derivatives traded by the now-bankrupt company under
greater government oversight.</LD>
<LD>   The vote came as the Senate moved closer to a showdown, perhaps as
early as today, on the marquee issue in its energy bill: President Bush's
call to open up a portion of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to
oil drilling.</LD>
<LD>   A bipartisan group of senators led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)
sought to include the derivatives measure in the energy legislation,
contending it would help regulators investigate allegations of market
manipulation.</LD>
<TE>   Feinstein and California's other Democratic senator, Barbara Boxer,
have contended that Enron used the complex financial contracts to drive
up electricity prices last year. The company has denied the charge.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of more government oversight of derivatives said it was
necessary to shed light on an often secretive activity that affects
consumer pocketbooks. Regulation-wary Republican senators, however,
argued that the proposal would roil a multitrillion-dollar derivatives
market that is critical to the nation's economic recovery and cited among
the opponents Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.</TE>
<TE>   The vote underscored the difficulty of a closely divided Congress to
reach agreement in an election year on a raft of proposed reforms
inspired by the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. The GOP-controlled
House today is expected to act on Enron-triggered safeguards for employee
retirement accounts, but that bill faces an uncertain fate because
Democrats who control the Senate say it does not go far enough.</TE>
<TE>   Derivatives are essentially contracts based on the future price or
performance of a commodity, such as electricity. The contracts are used
to hedge against sudden and large price increases.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein dropped her amendment that would have given the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission oversight of energy derivative trading after
the proposal fell well short of the 60 votes needed to end debate. Only
48 senators voted for the motion; 50 voted against it.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein said she was simply trying to extend to energy trades the
same rules that apply to trading in such commodities as pork bellies and
wheat, most notably requirements for disclosure of price information.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the measure said it would close a loophole that allowed
Enron to escape scrutiny in a major part of its operations.</TE>
<TE>   "This loophole was created for Enron, by Enron, and I think it is
tragic that the Enron experience was not enough to enable its passage at
this time," Feinstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents warned against acting hastily on such a complex issue.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to tamper with [the derivatives market] unless you
know what you are doing," said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas). "You don't want
unintended consequences."</TE>
<TE>   Gramm's wife, Wendy, was the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
chairwoman who in the early 1990s shepherded an exemption from government
oversight for the trading of energy products. She later joined the Enron
board.</TE>
<TE>   Assailing the Senate action, Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director
for USPIRG, a public interest research group, said, "The Senate failed
the first major test of whether Congress is going to enact Enron reforms,
or just wring its hands and stick with business as usual."</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, Press Secretary Ari Fleischer cited the
instability in the Middle East to make the case for Bush's push for
increased production of domestic energy--a plan that includes the Arctic
drilling proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "What the president is saying to the Senate is we need conservation,
we need more efficiency, but don't turn your back on making America more
energy-independent because you're not willing to explore within our own
lands," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   At an anti-drilling rally on Capitol Hill, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman
(D-Conn.) expressed confidence that opponents have the votes to block the
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "It will not happen," he told a cheering crowd. Lieberman dismissed
suggestions that the Middle East turmoil has made drilling in the refuge
more imperative as "the biggest bunch of hokum."</TE>
<TE>   Drilling proponents will need 60 votes in the Senate to break a
threatened Democratic filibuster over the issue. A number of Republican
senators contend that if they can muster 50 votes, it will give them more
political leverage to try to include the drilling in any final energy
bill crafted by a House-Senate conference committee. An energy bill
passed by the House last summer authorizes the drilling.</TE>
<TE>   Some GOP senators privately have talked about linking drilling in the
Arctic refuge to aid for the steel industry in an effort to attract the
support of Democratic senators from steel-producing states.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows how desperate they are," Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.) said.</TE>

<HD>Energy Dept. Withholding Files, Groups Charge</HD>
<DH>Documents: More pages on policymaking task force are released. Data
on five key members are missing, opponents say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Energy Department on Wednesday released an additional 950 pages
of documents related to the Bush administration's controversial task
force charged with setting a new national energy policy last year.</LD>
<LD>   But environmental groups that are seeking to prove that the task force
was heavily influenced by energy industry lobbyists immediately
complained that the administration still refuses to release key
documents, including the calendars of top Energy Department officials who
led the effort.</LD>
<LD>   "The administration continues to play games and stonewall," said
Sharon Buccino, attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an
environmental group that won a court order earlier this year forcing the
Energy Department and other government agencies to release all relevant
documents by Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The council also complained that the Interior Department has failed to
adequately comply with the court order. The council plans to announce
today that it will return to federal court to ask a judge to compel the
Interior Department to release additional documents.</TE>
<TE>   Energy Department officials said the latest release--consisting
chiefly of calendar entries for half a dozen senior employees--fulfills
its obligations under the court order.</TE>
<TE>   The council sued the agency under the Freedom of Information Act.
Judicial Watch, a government watchdog organization, won a similar suit.</TE>
<TE>   Several media organizations, including the Los Angeles Times, also
received the documents Wednesday under separate FOIA requests.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's action by [the Energy Department] concludes its production of
documents in response to these FOIA requests," the department said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   But Buccino said the department continues to refuse to release the
calendars of five key task force members, including Andrew Lundquist--the
task force's executive director--and Karen Knutson, its deputy director.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a gross omission," Buccino said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the agency released about 11,000 pages of documents
related to the task force, revealing that Energy Secretary Spencer
Abraham met with more than 55 energy industry representatives while
developing the national energy policy.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, environmental groups complained that Abraham and
Vice President Dick Cheney, who led the task force, turned down requests
for meetings.</TE>
<TE>   The earlier documents also showed that the task force and the Bush
administration appear to have adopted many of the industry's suggestions
verbatim.</TE>
<TE>   The council noted that a "suggested" presidential executive order
written March 20, 2001, by the American Petroleum Institute sought to
require federal agencies to assess the effects of proposed regulations on
energy supplies. Bush issued such an executive order two months later,
the environmental group said.</TE>
<TE>   Judicial Watch also complained that the Energy Department still has
failed to turn over all requested documents, noting that thousands of
pages in the March 25 batch were withheld or heavily edited. Under the
Freedom of Information Act, government agencies may refuse to release
information for a variety of reasons, including protecting an
individual's privacy or shielding policy debates.</TE>
<TE>   Judicial Watch officials said they would go back to court soon to make
the administration justify the omissions and explain why it withheld as
many as 15,000 additional documents.</TE>
<TE>   "We plan to challenge their sweeping redactions," said Tom Fitton,
president of the organization. "Frankly, the large number of redacted
documents raises the inference that something is up."</TE>
<TE>   The larger showdown over the task force remains unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   In a rare lawsuit filed by the General Accounting Office against the
vice president, the agency is demanding that Cheney provide details about
his meetings with industry lobbyists as part of the energy task force.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney has refused, contending that it would set a bad precedent for
future administrations seeking candid advice from outside experts.</TE>

<HD>Former Police Panel Head Agrees Parks Misled Board</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Los Angeles Police Commission President Raquelle de la Rocha
spoke publicly Wednesday in support of three current police commissioners
who said this week that they based their decision to oust Chief Bernard
C. Parks in part on him misleading them about one of his job performance
reviews.</LD>
<LD>   De la Rocha, who was called by the commission during their
deliberations Monday to share her account, said Parks had knowingly given
them a draft performance review instead of a final version. Contrary to
the chief's claims, she added, Parks knew the document was only a draft
and no final evaluation was issued. "I told him explicitly," she said.</LD>
<LD>   Parks on Wednesday strongly objected to the allegation that he had
acted deceitfully, and he gave a different version of events.</LD>
<TE>   The chief acknowledged that he had contacted De la Rocha as she
described, and that she told him his evaluation wasn't finished. He said
De la Rocha told him she needed more information, which he and others
provided.</TE>
<TE>   Parks then assumed, when he received the hand-delivered evaluation
some time later, that it was the finished report, he said. He reiterated
that the document looked like all the other completed ones.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission voted 4 to 1 Tuesday to reject Parks'
application for a second five-year term, climaxing a drama that began in
February when Mayor James K. Hahn voiced his opposition to the chief. Up
until then, many city officials had assumed the chief's position was
secure.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners did not have to follow Hahn's recommendation, but they
did anyway, citing the disputed personnel evaluation among their reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners said Parks submitted a long report to the commission
defending his tenure, citing in several places excerpts from a 2001
performance evaluation signed by De la Rocha, who was commission
president then.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners later determined that the evaluation had not been
approved by the full commission, and was instead a draft written by De la
Rocha, who was generally supportive of the chief but also sometimes took
him to task.</TE>
<TE>   Current Commission President Rick J. Caruso in particular
characterized this finding as an influential factor in key votes against
Parks. He said it led him and others to question the chief's integrity.</TE>
<TE>   De la Rocha said Wednesday that she had told Parks the evaluation was
just a draft when he called her recently to ask for a copy. "He said, 'At
least it counts as to what you thought,' " she said.</TE>

<HD>Campaign Reform Spat Derails Tax-Extension Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A campaign reform dispute caused the House on Wednesday to reject
an otherwise popular bill that would have extended the deadline for tax
returns filed via the Internet and provided taxpayers other benefits.</LD>
<LD>   The 219-205 vote against the measure pushed by House Republican
leaders was, to some degree, an embarrassment for both parties.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats, who led the opposition to the bill, won their argument that
the legislation contained an unacceptable provision loosening financial
disclosure requirements for certain political groups.</LD>
<TE>   But they faced the challenge of explaining to voters why defeating
such an arcane proposal was more important than passing a bill dubbed the
Taxpayer Protection and IRS Accountability Act.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would have changed the April 15 deadline for the first time
in nearly half a century, granting an estimated 50 million "e-filers" an
extra 15 days to file, starting next year. It also would have expanded
aid to low-income taxpayer clinics and eased some penalties for taxpayers
who make good-faith mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   But the financial disclosure provision caused the vote to be viewed by
most lawmakers as a question dealing more with campaign reform than
taxpayer rights.</TE>
<TE>   For GOP leaders, the vote represented their second stinging defeat
this year on campaign finance reform. Twenty-five Republicans strayed
from the leadership line, demonstrating anew the strength of the
coalition that backed a major campaign law enacted last month.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Rob Portman of Ohio, a Republican leader on tax issues who
supported the bill, blamed its defeat on partisan strife.</TE>
<TE>   Leading Democrats, though, praised the outcome as another victory for
advocates of campaign reform. House Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi (D-San
Francisco) said reformers had turned back "sneaky tactics employed by
Republicans to try to railroad this vote through the House--using a bill
with a popular-sounding name."</TE>
<TE>   At issue was a provision to ease 2-year-old rules requiring some
tax-exempt groups active in politics to report their donations and
contributions to the federal government. The GOP leaders said they merely
wanted to exempt state and local groups that were already filing similar
information to state authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said the provision could enable groups wishing to hide their
political activity to take advantage of lax reporting requirements in
some states. The result, they claimed, would be a weakening of current
disclosure rules and of the newly enacted law curbing the unlimited
political donations known as soft money.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield), chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee and the chief proponent of the provision, derided the
criticism as an "urban myth."</TE>
<TE>   But 25 Republicans joined 193 Democrats and one independent to block
the provision and the entire bill. All of California's 32 House Democrats
voted against the bill. Only one California Republican joined them: Rep.
Stephen Horn of Long Beach. Rep. John T. Doolittle (R-Rocklin) did not
vote.</TE>
<TE>   The vote against the bill was not even as close as it looked. House
Republican leaders called up the measure under a special procedure that
limited debate, barred amendments and required a two-thirds majority for
passage.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the bill had passed the House, leading senators were promising
to block its political disclosure provision.</TE>
<TE>   On another campaign finance matter, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)
announced that a coalition of groups is joining his legal challenge to
the new campaign reform law.</TE>
<TE>   Among the groups McConnell said would be co-plaintiffs in a lawsuit
seeking to overturn the law as unconstitutional: the American Civil
Liberties Union, the National Right to Life Committee, the Southeastern
Legal Foundation, the Libertarian National Committee and the Christian
Coalition of America.</TE>
<TE>   "Where constitutionally guaranteed American political freedoms are
concerned, there is no ideological divide," McConnell said of the
diversity of the groups. "There are no special interests. There is only
one interest: freedom."</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, the Senate moved to end debate on a bill to overhaul
voting systems nationwide in response to the 2000 election controversies.
A vote on final passage could come as early as today.</TE>

<HD>House GOP Blocks Food Stamps for Noncitizens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Republicans on Wednesday blocked President Bush's election-year
proposal to restore food stamps to low-income noncitizens who have lived
in the country at least five years.</LD>
<LD>   The plan is popular with groups that represent Latinos, a voting bloc
the White House has targeted.</LD>
<LD>   But a House-Senate conference committee that is negotiating a farm
bill set aside the food stamp issue after House GOP members insisted
Wednesday on a much more restrictive plan than the president wanted.</LD>
<TE>   "We ought to target those people who are most in need of assistance,"
said Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.).</TE>
<TE>   Food stamps for legal immigrants were cut off when Congress overhauled
the welfare system in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's proposal, which was included in a farm bill passed by the
Senate in February, would have restored benefits to an estimated 363,000
people at a cost of $2.1 billion over the next 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   House Republicans want to take most of that money and shift it into
agricultural research and subsidy programs for farmers and landowners.</TE>
<TE>   Under their plan, immigrants would have to prove they had worked in
the country for at least five years and could not receive food stamps for
more than two years. Under the White House plan, there would be no time
limit on benefits.</TE>
<TE>   House Republicans also would deny benefits to any immigrants who have
ever been in the country illegally for more than a year. Federal and
state officials say that curb would be very difficult to enforce.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to see why they [Republicans] are digging in their heels,"
said Ellen Vollinger, a spokeswoman for the Food Research and Action
Center, an advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   Farm workers, whose jobs are seasonal, would be among the biggest
beneficiaries of the White House plan, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   House members of the conference committee voted 8 to 6 along party
lines to support the GOP proposal over the White House plan.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP move would break an agreement that leaders of the conference
committee reached in March on overall spending levels for various
sections of the farm bill.</TE>
<TE>   That agreement earmarked $6.4 billion in new spending for nutrition
programs over the next 10 years. Overall, the legislation would increase
spending for agriculture and nutrition programs by $73.5 billion over the
decade.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiators are trying to merge a farm bill that passed the House
last fall with the rival version approved by the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) said he did not expect much progress before
next week.</TE>

<HD>Camera Program Aimed at Catching Speeders Ended by Hawaii Governor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU
</DL>
<LD>Hawaii Gov. Ben Cayetano on Wednesday ordered the shutdown of the
state's controversial traffic camera program to catch speeders.</LD>
<LD>   The governor said he took the action because of the Legislature's
intent to repeal the three-year pilot program.</LD>
<LD>   Cayetano, who is on the mainland, said he intends to allow the repeal
bill to become law without his signature, according to a statement
released by his office.</LD>
<TE>   "The traffic van cam law is the creation of the Legislature, and if
they want to now cancel the program it will be canceled," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said it is unfortunate that the pilot program is being terminated
because its objective of promoting safety and controlling speeding is
good.</TE>
<TE>   The program was scheduled to move to other islands this summer. But
since it began on Oahu in January, the program has faced harsh criticism
and legal challenges as attorneys found loopholes to exploit.</TE>
<TE>   Judges threw out the first batch of citations on a technicality that
later was fixed, only to have lawyers successfully argue that all tickets
issued for drivers going less than 10 mph over the speed limit be
dismissed because it conflicts with police practice.</TE>

<HD>2 Pipeline Deaths Draw Settlement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE
</DL>
<LD>The families of two boys killed in a 1999 gasoline pipeline
explosion while playing along a creek will share a $75-million settlement
from the pipeline company.</LD>
<LD>   The parents of Wade King and Stephen Tsiorvas said Wednesday that they
will spend much of the money to fight for pipeline safety reform and
other causes. Their lawsuit had been set for trial April 22.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a rough day for me, despite the fact that we got $75 million,
whatever that means," said Tsiorvas' mother, Katherine Dalen. "I don't
have my son."</LD>
<TE>   The pipeline ruptured and spilled more than 225,000 gallons of
gasoline along Whatcom Creek in Bellingham near the boys' homes. The fuel
exploded, scarring the landscape and killing the two 10-year-olds and
18-year-old Liam Wood, who was fishing at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Wood's family settled separately with Olympic Pipe Line Co.</TE>
<TE>   "We again express our deepest sympathy to the families," said Olympic
chairman Lawrence B. Peck. "We are mindful of the tragic circumstances
that occurred that day and are committed to ensuring that nothing
resembling this incident ever happens again."</TE>
<TE>   The company did not admit liability in the settlement. Olympic, its
partner Equilon Pipeline of Houston and two company officials are still
awaiting federal trial on criminal charges in the blast.</TE>
<TE>   The families had accused the company of knowing the pipeline needed
repair but deferring the work. The company also failed to fix a pressure
problem it knew about, the lawsuit said.</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the explosion, the company got an electronic alarm
indicating a leak, which temporarily shut the line, but the company
restarted the line without checking on repairs, the lawsuit said.</TE>
<TE>   King's father, Frank King, said his family was disappointed there was
no trial but felt the size of the settlement would serve notice "that
ordinary people will no longer sit back and allow these companies to be
unaccountable for their actions."</TE>

<HD>Nicotine Pops Illegally Sold on Net, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Nicotine lollipops and lip balms sold by three Internet pharmacies
as aids to quit smoking are illegal, U.S. regulators said Wednesday as
they warned the firms to stop selling the products.</LD>
<LD>   The Food and Drug Administration ruled that the products are
unapproved drugs because they contain a type of nicotine that has not
passed safety and effectiveness tests for smoking cessation.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA sent letters to Bird's Hill Pharmacy in Needham, Mass.;
Ashland Drug of Ashland, Miss.; and the Compounding Pharmacy of Aurora,
Ill. Owners of Ashland Drug and the Compounding Pharmacy said they had
complied with the FDA's order. Bird's Hill Pharmacy could not be reached
for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Pharmacists had asserted the right to sell the products at stores and
over the Internet under federal rules that permit them to make medicines
easier to take, a practice known as compounding.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA determined that the lollipops and lip balms violated those
rules because some were being sold without a doctor's prescription. The
type of nicotine typically used, nicotine salicylate, is not permitted in
compounding, the FDA said. It is different from the nicotine used in
approved gums and patches that help smokers quit.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators said the products did not have proper directions for use
and failed to carry adequate warnings against use by children.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who last week urged the FDA to
stop sales of nicotine lollipops, called the action "an important
precedent for further action involving nicotine and other unapproved
products."</TE>
<TE>   The lollipops, sold in a variety of flavors, are promoted as a tasty
way to give up cigarettes, or a means for smokers to get a nicotine fix
in locations where they cannot light up a cigarette.</TE>

<LD>Arnold Schwarzenegger's face is blotched with rubber-like makeup,
depicting wounds and blood and bits of metal skull. But I could be
wrong. This is a very strange place.</LD>
<LD>   The former Mr. Universe is wearing a tight T-shirt that emphasizes
his barrel chest and bulging biceps, along with Terminator garb:
black leather pants and jackboots. We're at L.A. Center Studios,
where pre-production has begun on "Terminator 3."</LD>
<LD>   Schwarzenegger has just stepped off the set--a top-secret place
where no reporter is allowed--and into his trailer to briefly reenter
the world of politics.</LD>
<TE>   He's eager to talk about his November ballot initiative that would
annually pump $433 million in state money into after-school programs
for kids in kindergarten through junior high.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen the incredible success you can have with children who
attend after-school programs," says Schwarzenegger, who has promoted
these programs nationwide for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Aides pull out several studies that match facts with logic:
Children in after-school programs--being tutored, enjoying culture,
playing sports--are much less likely to join gangs, do drugs and
burglarize the neighborhood. They'll also improve their grades.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, I had a great childhood," recalls Schwarzenegger, 54.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents were there in the afternoon when I came from school. I
had to sit down, had to do my homework. And I did get whacks with the
yardstick over the head when I didn't. It was Austria under different
times. Now it's child abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "But I had someone there. 'Now we do the reading. Now we do the
math. Now we do the soccer.' Boom-boom-boom....</TE>
<TE>   "I know how important it was to get me over to America and make me
feel comfortable. To make me feel, 'I can do it. I can be the world
champion bodybuilder. I can be the highest-paid entertainer.' I felt
that way because of what I got from my childhood: the confidence and
determination."</TE>
<TE>   But today, both parents often work, Schwarzenegger notes. So kids
wander.</TE>
<TE>   His initiative--which soon will qualify for the ballot--would
entitle each elementary school to a $50,000 state grant; each junior
high to $75,000. The schools would have to match half that, using
public or private money.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis currently is proposing $117 million for
after-school programs, but this funding is threatened by the budget
crunch. Schwarzenegger's proposal would not take effect until 2004,
and then only if the economy has turned around and is generating
significant new revenues (at least $1.5 billion).</TE>
<TE>   His after-school program would not dip into the education money
guaranteed by Proposition 98, which is why it is endorsed by the
California Teachers Assn. Conceivably, parks, prisons and other
competitors for non-education money could object, however.</TE>
<TE>   Really, I ask, isn't this about dipping your toe into politics to
learn how it feels before maybe running for governor in four years?
See how voters react to you? His initiative strategist is George
Gorton, former Gov. Pete Wilson's longtime political advisor.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest," Schwarzenegger replies, "that is not my mentality.
I have never tried  anything. I've done it or I've not done it. In
sports, you don't go to 500 pounds and try  to lift it. You lift it.
If you just try, chances are you will not make it. Trying is not good
enough .... I don't get my feet wet."</TE>
<TE>   The moderate Republican seemed close last year to diving into the
gubernatorial race. The White House encouraged him. "I was flirting
with the idea."</TE>
<TE>   Davis strategist Garry South was so concerned he faxed reporters
two sleazy articles by fringe publications alleging boorish behavior
toward women by the actor. "Trash" and "stupid," Schwarzenegger said
in denying the accusations.</TE>
<TE>   He opted out of the race, but says the smears "had absolutely
nothing to do with it." In fact, he adds with a smile, his poll
numbers rose 6 points after the seedy stories ran.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger got out, he says, because "Terminator 3" came
together. He was threatened with lawsuits if he didn't honor his
contract. It's paying him $30 million for the picture.</TE>
<TE>   Has he ruled out a future race? "Absolutely not," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something I've thought about many times. I don't believe in
just complaining. The best thing to do is jump in there and
participate and make changes ....</TE>
<TE>   "But right now my mind is on one thing. After the initiative
passes, we will have two years to build the program. Then I can think
about the rest of the stuff....</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to make this initiative succeed. It's absolutely
important. That is my mission right now.</TE>
<TE>   "It is like the, you know, the Terminator mode."</TE>
<TE>   The Terminator has never lost. And, unlike most Terminator
battles, this one should be almost bloodless.</TE>

<HD>Killer of Boy, 12, Given Death</HD>
<DH>Crime: O.C. judge rules that Egyptian immigrant's illness
was not severe enough to overcome the gruesome nature of the crime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man convicted of molesting and killing a 12-year-old boy and
encasing his body parts in concrete blocks that he scattered around a
La Habra neighborhood was sentenced Wednesday to death.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Superior Court Judge John Ryan issued his ruling
after the boy's father made a tearful statement to the court
describing how the gruesome 1998 slaying has haunted his family.</LD>
<LD>   "My other children don't want to go to school because they don't
like people to ask them about it," said Jose Delgado, a La Habra
truck driver. "When I'm about in public, I don't like people to ask
me about it."</LD>
<TE>   Delgado urged swift justice for the killer, Egyptian immigrant
John Samuel Ghobrial.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like that he be punished so that he can never do this to
another child and another family. I don't want anyone to go through
what we've been through," the father said. "I will always carry this
pain for the rest of my life. I don't think I will ever reach a
healing on this."</TE>
<TE>   The 31-year-old Ghobrial sat slumped in his chair, staring forward
without emotion as Jose Delgado spoke and the judge handed down his
decision.</TE>
<TE>   A jury in December convicted the one-armed panhandler of sexually
abusing and then killing Juan Delgado, who had befriended Ghobrial
when he started hanging around the boy's working-class neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, defense attorney Denise Gragg argued that Ghobrial
suffered from "severe and intractable" schizophrenia and that his
treatment for that illness in Egypt consisted of damaging
electroshock treatments. But Ryan ruled that Ghobrial's illness was
not severe enough to overcome the aggravating factors of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor David Brent said that if anyone deserves the death
penalty, it's Ghobrial.</TE>
<TE>   "There are those cases--rare, I hope--where it is appropriate for
the government to take a life," Brent said. "I don't like it, but
it's appropriate here."</TE>
<TE>   The death sentence follows a six-month trial in which prosecutors
introduced evidence that Ghobrial beat and sexually assaulted another
boy, his cousin, in the early-1990s while living in Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   As Egyptian police began searching for him in connection with that
case, Ghobrial fled the country. Three years later, he made his way
to Texas.</TE>
<TE>   There, he told federal officials he had been persecuted in Egypt
because he was a Coptic Christian. An immigration judge granted him
religious asylum.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Ghobrial moved to La Habra. He had no job, but some
residents were touched by his disability and tried to help him.</TE>
<TE>   One family rented him a backyard shed. Ghobrial became known in
the neighborhood for giving candy to children. He befriended Juan, a
Washington Middle School student who lived nearby. The boy was last
seen in March 1998, walking with a one-armed man carrying a
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Four days after Juan disappeared, neighbors discovered the first
of the large concrete pieces. Detectives searched Ghobrial's shed and
recovered some of Juan's clothes, a school detention slip, bags of
concrete and pornographic magazines.</TE>
<TE>   Ghobrial's trial was delayed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
when his attorneys questioned whether a Middle Eastern man could
receive a fair trial.</TE>

<HD>Altercation With Photographer Won't Derail Priest's Rape
Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A defense attorney dropped an effort Wednesday to derail the rape and
lewd conduct trial in Santa Rosa of a Roman Catholic priest accused a
day earlier of assaulting a newspaper photographer outside court.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Andrian, attorney for Donald Kimball, withdrew a motion for
a mistrial after Judge Gayle Guynup polled jurors and determined that
few if any had even heard that Kimball had been arrested on suspicion
of the assault.</LD>
<LD>   Kimball, 58, was jailed Tuesday for allegedly shoving a camera
into the face of San Francisco Chronicle photographer Penni Gladstone
as she tried to snap his picture in a courtroom hallway. He was
released after posting $30,000 bail but is set to be arraigned today
on assault charges.</LD>
<TE>   Gladstone was snapping Kimball's picture as he left for a lunch
recess because cameras were not allowed in the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   "He just came at me with his fist," she told Associated Press. "I
saw the whole thing happening through the camera."</TE>
<TE>   As about a dozen witnesses looked on, Kimball then allegedly
grabbed the camera and threw it, hitting reporter Clark Mason of the
Santa Rosa Press Democrat. Mason was not hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Gladstone suffered a cut under her right eye and her glasses were
broken. She went to a hospital for X-rays and a tetanus shot and was
released.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses called out for help and bailiffs restrained Kimball, who
was taken to the Sonoma County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, the incident threatened to snowball into something
that could derail the trial. One juror saw Kimball being escorted by
bailiffs after the attack and told other jurors.</TE>
<TE>   But after being questioned for an hour by the judge, Kimball's
attorney was satisfied the incident would not color the verdict and
pulled his request for a mistrial.</TE>
<TE>   Kimball was a popular youth pastor who ran an outreach program
that drew national attention with its mix of Top 40 music hits and
Bible teachings.</TE>
<TE>   He is charged with raping a 14-year-old girl behind the altar of a
Santa Rosa chapel in 1977 and molesting a 13-year-old girl in 1981 at
St. John's Rectory in Healdsburg.</TE>
<TE>   Though not a practicing priest since 1990, Kimball has not been
defrocked by the local diocese. He denies all charges. In recent
years, he has remained active in a nonprofit religious organization
that allows him access to young people.</TE>
<TE>   Kimball's attorney has argued that the allegations are a mix of
fantasy and questionable memories dredged up during therapy.</TE>

<HD>Woman Recalls Terrifying Chase</HD>
<DH>Court: Witness says Vincent Sanchez, charged in the slaying
of a Moorpark woman, tried to ram her car.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Murder suspect Vincent Sanchez tried six times to ram his truck into
the car of a terrified 21-year-old woman as she desperately tried to
evade him 18 months ago during a high-speed chase through eastern
Ventura County, the woman testified Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Identified only as Makala, the woman told a judge that she feared
for her life as Sanchez brazenly pursued her from Newbury Park to the
darkened streets of suburban Simi Valley in October 2000.</LD>
<LD>   "I was scared and shaking," the woman testified during Sanchez's
preliminary hearing on murder, attempted rape and assault charges. "I
just wanted to get away."</LD>
<TE>   The testimony could prove significant to the prosecution's case
because the alleged incident occurred nine months before Sanchez
fatally shot 20-year-old Megan Barroso of Moorpark after a freeway
pursuit in the same area.</TE>
<TE>   The Moorpark College student's bullet-riddled car was found
abandoned under a freeway overpass in the early morning hours of July
5, 2001, with the engine running. Her remains were recovered a month
later in a canyon near Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez, a 31-year-old handyman who has pleaded guilty to sexually
assaulting seven women prior to the homicide, has also admitted
killing Barroso but denies that he did so during a rape and kidnap
attempt. If convicted on all counts, Sanchez could face the death
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors are attempting to demonstrate that they have
sufficient evidence to proceed to trial.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the murder charge, Sanchez faces felony counts of
assault with a deadly weapon and attempted kidnapping for the alleged
attack on Makala, as well as attempted kidnapping charges involving
another woman.</TE>
<TE>   According to Makala's testimony, the October 2000 chase occurred
about 2:30 a.m. as she drove home from work. A bartender at the time,
Makala testified that she routinely kept an eye out for drunk drivers
when heading home.</TE>
<TE>   On that night, she said, she initially thought the driver of the
white Chevrolet truck behind her was under the influence, based on
his erratic movements.</TE>
<TE>   At the Olsen Road offramp from Highway 23, the truck came within
inches of hitting her rear bumper. She sped away and the truck
pursued, passing her, then slowing down. This continued until she
turned onto eastbound Highway 118, she said.</TE>
<TE>   It was miles later, when Makala noticed the truck was still behind
her with its headlights turned off, that she became frightened, she
testified. She turned off the highway. The truck followed. She ran a
red light and the truck still bore down.</TE>
<TE>   "I was flying," she said, describing how she raced down city
streets at 90 mph in her red Honda Civic to get away.</TE>
<TE>   At two residential intersections in eastern Simi Valley, she said,
the driver of the truck attempted to run into her car, at which point
she decided to head to the police station.</TE>
<TE>   As she drove west on Alamo Street, she said, the truck appeared
three more times and almost rammed her car--the last time in front of
the police station driveway.</TE>
<TE>   Makala testified that she got a good look at the driver through
her rear-view mirror that night and again nine months later.</TE>
<TE>   On July 8, she said, she was driving home with friends and noticed
a similar white truck on Highway 23. She pulled up alongside it and
recognized the driver as the man who had chased her, she said.</TE>
<TE>   One of her friends took down the license plate number. So far,
there has been no testimony about whether the plate matched the
defendant's vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Makala testified that she identified Sanchez after seeing his
picture in the newspaper when he was arrested for a string of
unsolved sexual assaults that had terrified Simi Valley residents for
years.</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination, public defender Neil B. Quinn questioned
Makala's description of the chase and the plausibility of six near
run-ins with the truck.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn asked whether there could have been two trucks, and he
suggested that Makala's emotions over the arrest of the long-sought
"Simi Valley serial rapist" could have swayed her account.</TE>
<TE>   Makala acknowledged that after seeing a newspaper article and then
learning that Sanchez was a suspect in the Barroso slaying, she felt
she had narrowly escaped being raped.</TE>
<TE>   "I flipped out," she said. "I drove home every night. I thought,
'What if that was me?'"</TE>
<TE>   Testimony is scheduled to resume today.</TE>

<HD>Accident Victim Is Awarded $5.2 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Yorba Linda, a construction firm and a local water
district must pay $5.2 million to a 20-year-old motorist who was
severely injured in a car crash in a construction zone, an Orange
County jury decided.</LD>
<LD>   Keith Saul of Yorba Linda, who is quadriplegic as a result of his
injuries, had hit gravel as he was driving through a construction
zone. He lost control and hit a large excavator.</LD>
<LD>   The jury found Saul partly responsible for the Aug. 5, 2000,
accident because he was speeding and not wearing a seat belt,
according to Saul's attorney, Steven M. Barnhill of Los Angeles.
Still, it found that the defendants also held responsibility.</LD>
<TE>   Albert M. Davies Inc., in Rancho Cucamonga, was laying a water
pipe along Richfield Road for the Yorba Linda Water District. Both
were named defendants in addition to Yorba Linda, but the city will
not have to pay any damages because of an agreement made with the
other two, said Linda S. Bauermeister, the city's trial lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the jury had a lot of sympathy for the defendant and
wanted to award the young driver money," said Lester Davies, a
spokesman for the contractor.</TE>
<TE>   Saul settled with two other defendants for $1.7 million,
Bauermeister said.</TE>

<HD>FERC Orders Nevada Hearings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a hearing closely watched by California politicians, federal
energy regulators on Wednesday warned Nevada utilities seeking to
force renegotiations of deals struck during the energy crisis that
they "bear a heavy burden."</LD>
<LD>   Meeting in Washington, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
refused to accept, at least for now, the argument of Nevada utilities
that their long-term power contracts should be overhauled because
they were signed at a time when Western power markets were
dysfunctional and manipulated by power sellers. California has made
similar arguments in support of renegotiating deals struck here at
the height of last year's electricity crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the commission asked an administrative law judge to hold
hearings to decide whether soaring spot-market prices in 2000 and
2001 justify overturning long-term power contracts that were signed
by the Nevada utilities.</LD>
<TE>   The judge will then make recommendations to the FERC. The
commission also ordered the utilities and its power sellers to sit
down with arbitrators and voluntarily amend the long-term power
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The administration of Gov. Gray Davis, which is trying to
renegotiate tens of billions of dollars' worth of contracts with
energy companies even as it challenges the legality of the contracts,
found encouragement in Wednesday's order.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor is pleased that FERC apparently is nudging reluctant
generators to the table to renegotiate contracts that were signed at
the height of the energy crisis," said Davis spokesman Steve
Maviglio. "Several generators are negotiating in good faith, but some
have told us, frankly, to pound sand. Perhaps FERC's action will be a
wake-up call to them to get serious."</TE>
<TE>   The 4-0 FERC decision to order hearings and arbitration, with a
partial dissent by Commissioner William Massey, gives a good
indication of how the FERC will consider California's request because
both petitions use the same legal reasoning.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada's petition, filed in December, involves contracts worth $1
billion.</TE>
<TE>   California's petition, filed by the Public Utilities Commission in
February, asks the FERC to nullify or modify nearly $43 billion worth
of contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Those deals helped rescue California from exorbitant spot-market
prices last spring. But market prices have since plummeted, making
the contracts a political liability for Davis and financial burden
for utility customers.</TE>
<TE>   A longtime advocate of deregulated electricity markets, the FERC
repeatedly referred to the "sanctity of contracts" in its order and
stated that power plant builders need "regulatory certainty,
including certainty that the commission will not modify market-based
contracts unless there are extraordinary circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Massey, one of two Clinton appointees on the commission, argued in
his dissent that the FERC must also consider its obligation to ensure
that wholesale electricity rates are just and reasonable.</TE>
<TE>   "Here you had an out-of-control spot market that was out of
control for months, and it would be shocking indeed to me if that had
no adverse impact on long-term contract prices," Massey said.</TE>
<TE>   The FERC has not set a date yet to hear California's complaint.</TE>

<HD>Monks, Marines Change Police Firing Range Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OCEANSIDE</DL>
<LD>Confronted by an alliance between Benedictine monks and U.S. Marines,
the Police Department here withdrew a controversial proposal
Wednesday night to build an outdoor firing range on city property
between the Prince of Peace Abbey and Camp Pendleton.</LD>
<LD>   The police instead will search for alternative locations that do
not disrupt either the monks' devotion to God or the Marines training
for combat.</LD>
<LD>   City Council members, who in recent days had criticized the site
as unacceptable, unanimously accepted the department's decision to
drop its request for a city permit.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm a little concerned that this got so far along without anyone
testing the fact that it was going to have so many objections," said
Councilwoman Betty Harding. "I hope in the future we plan a little
better."</TE>
<TE>   The city Planning Commission had unanimously endorsed the site,
but that action is now moot.</TE>
<TE>   "We're back to the drawing board," said Officer Rich Davis, the
department's master.</TE>
<TE>   Council members said they had received hundreds of e-mails and
letters from residents opposing the plan and virtually none in favor.</TE>
<TE>   "We should be able to worship without hearing the sound of
gunfire," retired high school teacher Charles Hall, who attends Mass
at the abbey, told the council members.</TE>
<TE>   The monks at the Prince of Peace Abbey feared noise from the
firing range would ruin the silence needed for the Roman Catholic
order's life of prayer and contemplation. Twenty-five monks spend
their days and nights praying and studying at the 130-acre hilltop
site.</TE>
<TE>   "Silence isn't a way of life," said Abbott Charles Wright, who
runs the abbey. "It is our life."</TE>
<TE>   After the council's action, Wright joked that he is finished with
politicking.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to retire to my shell again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the monks gained an important ally: a key colonel at
the sprawling Marine base who wrote to city officials expressing
concern about the proposed range's proximity to base housing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm particularly concerned about the quality-of-life effects this
range may have on base residents, especially with its operation
during nighttime hours," wrote Col. L.H. Farmer, the base chief of
staff.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Department had wanted to build the range in a canyon in
the San Luis Rey Valley, within 2,500 feet of the abbey and 1,600
feet of the Camp Pendleton housing on Wire Mountain. The department
has lost its lease on its current firing range and must move by
October.</TE>
<TE>   The city has a $150,000 grant toward the estimated $900,000 cost.
The facility would be used as a firing range--including for SWAT
members--and a training site for police dogs.</TE>
<TE>   City Manager Steve Jepsen, who oversees the Police Department,
noted that the site preferred by police "does not enjoy public
support."</TE>
<TE>   The monks and Marines were not placated by assurances from police
officials that berms and fences would muffle the noise and corral any
errant bullets.</TE>
<TE>   Although dozens of law enforcement agencies use firing ranges at
Camp Pendleton, Oceanside police officials insist that is not a
practical alternative for their 171-officer department because of the
long drive times to those ranges. The Oceanside department prefers to
have its officers on call for emergencies even when at a firing
range.</TE>
<TE>   Like other residences in northern San Diego County, the abbey's
windows often rattle when Marines at Camp Pendleton are training with
heavy artillery.</TE>
<TE>   "We've learned to live with that," Wright said.</TE>

<DL>SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The bodies of a Visalia pilot and three teenage passengers were found
Wednesday at the site where the plane crashed.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick Carey, 43, was piloting the plane Saturday over the Moro
Rock area as part of a birthday surprise for Bobby Craine, 16.
Craine's friends Justin McClain and Jason Tilley, both 15, were also
aboard.</LD>
<LD>   A helicopter from Vandenberg Air Force Base spotted the Piper
Cherokee at 11 a.m. and lowered a California Highway Patrol officer,
who confirmed that there were no survivors, said Shauna Dyas, a park
employee.</LD>
<TE>   The flight followed a scavenger hunt Saturday morning that led the
boys to Visalia Municipal Airport. They were to return from the
flight and go out for Mexican food. Their families were waiting at
the restaurant when they learned the plane had not returned.</TE>

<LD>Gov. Gray Davis on Wednesday announced he is opposing the California
teacher union's most eagerly sought bill of the year, one that would
give them the right to bargain over textbooks used by their students
and other classroom issues.</LD>
<LD>   Davis for the first time publicly said he opposes the bill as
written. He sought to strike a middle ground, saying local school
districts should consider teachers' "advice and guidance" on
classroom issues in some sort of formal process.</LD>
<LD>   But the Democratic governor said he opposes legislation that would
turn over to the collective bargaining process questions about
textbooks and other aspects of curriculum.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't want textbooks to be held hostage to issues involving
wages," Davis said. "The collective bargaining process is the
appropriate forum for negotiating wages and salary increases. That is
perfectly appropriate. But we want textbooks in the hands of kids."</TE>
<TE>   The head of the California Teachers Assn. called the legislation,
headed for its first committee vote next week, a "defining issue,"
and said Davis' opposition could prompt the teachers to "sit on their
hands" in the November election.</TE>
<TE>   The union spent $1.3 million to help Davis win election in 1998,
and has given him $62,000 since he took office.</TE>
<TE>   The California Teachers Assn. has been trying to raise the
visibility of the issue by airing radio ads advocating that people
support granting teachers a greater say in curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, the 300,000-member union is pushing AB2160 by
Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles) to require local school
districts and teachers unions to negotiate over ways to improve
student performance. School administrators oppose the bill, calling
it a union power grab and contending that it would undermine school
reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what he says right now," Goldberg said of Davis' announced
opposition to her bill. "Do things change? You bet they do."</TE>
<TE>   But in an interview, CTA President Wayne Johnson said Davis'
opposition is "going to cost the governor significantly with
teachers."</TE>
<TE>   "The CTA is going to find out who its friends are," Johnson said.
"The CTA has a long memory. Politicians come to you with their hands
out for money and support, and then, on tough issues, they go south
on you."</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign spokesman Roger Salazar was unfazed by Johnson's
comments, saying: "I think when all is said and done, Gov. Davis is
going to have strong support of teachers."</TE>
<TE>   Salazar also said it shows that the governor "doesn't base his
decisions on contributions or endorsement. He bases his decision on
what is the best public policy."</TE>

<HD>Vandalism at UC Berkeley Unnerves Jews</HD>
<DH>Crime: Some students question their safety after
anti-Semitic incidents. Many are bitterly divided over Mideast
conflict.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>A spate of anti-Semitic vandalism has stung Jewish students at the
University of California campus, leading some to question their
safety at school.</LD>
<LD>   Known as a hotbed of political activism, many UC Berkeley students
are bitterly divided over the conflict in the Middle East. Rallies
and counter-demonstrations frequently turn into screaming matches.
Now, some students say, the angry rhetoric has crossed the line from
free speech to acts of destruction and hate:</LD>
<LD>   * The glass door at Berkeley Hillel, the center of Jewish life on
campus, was smashed with a cinder block March 27 as Jews marked the
first night of the holy days of Passover. Anti-Jewish profanities
were also scrawled on the center's recycling bins.</LD>
<TE>   * Last Thursday, officials discovered anti-Israel epithets and the
phrase "Free Palestine" spray-painted across the front a church next
to the campus.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued several days after the Hillel vandalism, UC
Berkeley Chancellor Robert Berdahl called for calm. "Our greatest
contribution to the resolution of this conflict is reasoned,
thoughtful interaction based on compassion for one another," he said.
"Our community must stand in opposition to such acts and in favor of
reasoned, civil approaches to the resolution of conflict."</TE>
<TE>   Berkeley police say they are investigating the incidents, as well
as an attack last week on the 21-year-old son of a prominent rabbi
and a man who came to his aid a block from the campus. Police Lt.
Cynthia Harris said officers suspect the attack was an attempted
robbery, but members of the Jewish community believe it was a hate
crime, noting that the assailant took no money.</TE>
<TE>   The door to the Hillel building was repaired before students
returned from spring break, but the attacks have left them shaken.
Jewish students say they have no idea whether the destruction is
linked to any individual or group on campus. But many expressed
exasperation and fear.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to go from being so comfortable to being actively
afraid of violence," said Daniel Frankenstein, 20, a member of the
Berkeley student senate and the school's Jewish community.</TE>
<TE>   "You think of Berkeley as this place of peace and love, but it's a
very angry and bitter place," said Randy Barnes, 29, co-chairman of
Berkeley Hillel's Israel Action Committee. "The strength of the
opinions held here doesn't surprise me. It's the uniformity of
thought and the lack of tolerance for other opinions that surprises
me a lot. The dominant opinion at Berkeley is that the Jews are evil
and Israel is evil."</TE>
<TE>   Emotions flared again on campus Tuesday as competing vigils were
held just yards apart.</TE>
<TE>   Jewish students observed the Holocaust remembrance day, Yom
Hashoah, for 24 hours by continuously reading the names of some of
the 6 million Jews killed by the Nazis. Pro-Palestinian students
assembled nearby on a campus plaza at midday, marking the anniversary
of a 1948 incident in which 100 to 250 Palestinian civilians were
killed in the village of Deir Yassin by right-wing Jewish militants.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking from a cell phone during the demonstration Tuesday, Basim
Elkarra, leader of Berkeley's Muslim Students' Assn., said
pro-Palestinian students are accused of being anti-Jewish in an
attempt to silence their views.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to distinguish between anti-Semitism and being against
Israeli policies. That's a deliberate campaign they've been focusing
on us for years," said Elkarra, who heads the association's West
Coast chapter, which covers many college campuses in California. "We
are against any vandalism or violence against any religion."</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, anti-Semitic incidents, which range from harassment to
actual crimes, declined 11% last year, according to an annual audit
released Wednesday by the Anti-Defamation League, a national
organization that monitors such incidents. California had the
greatest drop, with 122 incidents, compared with 257 the prior year.</TE>
<TE>   However, ADL National Director Abraham H. Foxman said one area
where incidents did not decline nationally was on college campuses.</TE>
<TE>   The number of reported campus incidents rose 23% last year,
from 69 to 85, Foxman said. In 1999, 60 such incidents were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the tenor on college campuses becomes increasingly
polarized over the conflict in the Middle East, many Jewish leaders
believe the debate at Berkeley is uniquely rancorous.</TE>
<TE>   "While there are obviously disagreements on many campuses, people
have developed relationships over time and are able to work them out.
Berkeley has been one of the unfortunate exceptions to that," said
Jay Rubin, executive vice president of Hillel International in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   The vandalism of Berkeley Hillel was not the first time Jewish
students have been harassed, students said. A group of students was
pelted with eggs 18 months ago as they emerged from services
celebrating the Jewish New Year.</TE>
<TE>   The rabbi's son attacked last week could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   According to Shneor Zalman Stern, 50, a lone male began beating
the rabbi's son as he returned home from a walk. Stern, a family
friend, was leaving his house at the time. He pulled the attacker
away and then himself came under attack. Both men suffered bruises,
and Stern was treated at a hospital for other minor injuries. No
money or possessions were taken from either man.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a robbery, and we don't have any reason to believe it
was a hate crime," said Harris of the Berkeley police.</TE>
<TE>   Stern, however, disagreed. "I was dressed in traditional garb for
the holiday," he said. "I was unmistakably Jewish, and I feel it was
a factor."</TE>

<HD>County Prepares to Take Command in a Crisis</HD>
<DH>Safety: Sheriff's Department mobile trailers are available
to local police and fire agencies.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to better prepare county law enforcement agencies for a
terrorist incident or natural disaster, the Orange County Sheriff's
Department rolled out two mobile command trailers Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The custom 53-foot expandable trailers will be used as
communication centers during terrorist acts, civil unrest,
earthquakes, floods or major fires.</LD>
<LD>   The trailers, which together cost $1.75 million, were ordered
before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and are ready to be deployed.
"I think 9/11 shows what can happen if you don't have something like
this in place," Sheriff's Department spokesman Jon Fleischman said.</LD>
<TE>   "As we've seen in New York City, things can get crazy in a hurry.
They didn't have the in- frastructure necessary, so they had to
commandeer a post office for their command center. The whole goal is
to be prepared for the unexpected."</TE>
<TE>   The command and communication centers will be made available to
all Orange County police departments and agencies such as the Orange
County Fire Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "In case of a major fire, the Orange County Fire Authority could
establish a perimeter around the fire, communicate with hospitals
about the number of injured people and also talk to John Wayne
Airport about a possible hazard to airplanes," Fleischman said.</TE>
<TE>   A 50-inch exterior plasma screen can give visual aid to personnel
outside the trailer.</TE>
<TE>   "You can do like John Madden football," Fleischman said. "You
write on a monitor and show people outside how you want them
deployed."</TE>

<DH>Courts: Santa Ana-based judge seeks investigation into case
involving Anna Nicole Smith.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. attorney's office is reviewing allegations of perjury and
financial malfeasance made against players in the long-running
probate dispute involving former Playboy Playmate Anna Nicole Smith.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge David O. Carter encouraged federal prosecutors
to review the case after he found that the son of J. Howard Marshall,
Smith's late husband, engaged in fraud to cheat Smith out of a share
of her husband's multimillion dollar estate.</LD>
<LD>   In March, Carter awarded the former centerfold nearly $89
million--a decision Marshall's son, E. Pierce Marshall of Texas, has
vowed to appeal.</LD>
<TE>   ''The matter was referred to us by Judge Carter, and the matter is
currently under consideration,'' said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for U.S.
attorney's office in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce Marshall denies any wrongdoing, said his spokesman, David
Margulies. Last year, a Texas probate court ruled that Pierce
Marshall did nothing improper and named him sole heir of the Marshall
estate, Margulies said.</TE>
<TE>   Carter, in his March 7 federal court ruling, found that Pierce
Marshall acted ''in concert'' with his father's attorney, Edwin
Hunter of Lake Charles, La., to defraud Smith by falsifying documents
and by committing perjury.</TE>
<TE>   ''Evidence of Pierce's tortious conduct is legion,'' the judge
wrote. ''Acting in concert with Hunter, they backdated documents,
altered documents, destroyed documents, suborned falsified notary
statements, presented documents to J. Howard under false pretenses,
and committed perjury.''</TE>
<TE>   The judge asked federal prosecutors to determine whether Hunter
perjured himself, and the Santa Ana-based judge also encouraged the
IRS to take a ''closer look'' at tax deductions taken on J. Howard
Marshall's behalf. But Margulies said that because the judge's
opinion did not specifically ask the U.S. attorney's office to review
the allegations against Pierce Marshall, there is no reason to
believe federal prosecutors will take action against his client.</TE>

<HD>Tustin Marine Base Land to Be Auctioned</HD>
<DH>Sale: Three parcels, 235 acres, will be sold online this
summer as the military tries to recoup costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal government has posted three parcels of land at the former
Tustin Marine base for online auction, an act that carries as much
symbolism--for the former helicopter station and the closed El Toro
Marine base--as it does potential cash for the Navy.</LD>
<LD>   Interest generated by the Tustin auction probably will affect how
the Navy handles the disposal of the 4,700-acre El Toro base. The
Navy announced a day after last month's election rezoning El Toro for
a future park that it would declare on April 23 whether it will
dispose of all or part of that base through a public sale.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, four of Orange County's five supervisors have met with
Navy officials in Washington to argue against a piecemeal sale of El
Toro, and for more time to present an alternative redevelopment plan
for the base.</LD>
<TE>   But the Navy "is focused on removing the El Toro property from the
books, and its mission is to put dollars back into the Navy coffers,"
Supervisors Tom Wilson and Chuck Smith said in a joint statement this
week.</TE>
<TE>   Until a few months ago, most of the 1,600-acre Tustin base was
slated to be given free to the city of Tustin for redevelopment. Navy
officials announced in February that they would keep some of the land
and sell it.</TE>
<TE>   The General Service Administration's announcement of the upcoming
sale on its Web site is a first for the Orange County bases, which
closed in July 1999. Proceeds are intended to help cover the
$1-billion cost of relocating troops, reflecting a policy established
by the Bush administration to recoup military costs.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy also wants to dispose of its closed bases, such as El
Toro, as Congress eyes a new round of military closures in 2005. The
Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station is said to be among U.S. bases
considered for shutdown.</TE>
<TE>   The Tustin land is among five "Hot Properties" featured on the Web
site for GSA's Office of Property Disposal. It is the largest chunk
of former military land for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Other properties include the 174-acre former Oak Knoll Naval
Hospital outside Oakland, which goes out for bid May 15 with a
suggested opening bid of $6 million; more than a dozen parcels of
less than 10 acres each in Las Vegas; and several single-family homes
in Florida. A house in Northern California that was used as an
airport weather station also is for sale.</TE>
<TE>   The 235 acres to be sold in Tustin are among the most valuable on
that base. They hold the bulk of 1,257 single-family homes used as
military housing, and they account for more than half of the total
base area designated for new homes in the city's redevelopment plan.</TE>
<TE>   The GSA Web site initially posted the Tustin land's minimum value
at $25 million--a figure a Navy spokesman said was a misprint.</TE>
<TE>   No dollar value has been or will be established for the property,
said Lee Saunders, environmental public affairs spokesman for the
Navy's Southwest division in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an auction," he said. "The purpose of an auction is to get
the best price."</TE>
<TE>   Residential land ready for development in nearby Irvine--without
existing homes--has gone for as much as $1 million an acre.</TE>
<TE>   Sale details still are being worked out, including opening bid
amounts for each parcel, Saunders said.</TE>
<TE>   School District, City Deal Is Still Needed</TE>
<TE>   Interest could be heavy; 22 developers submitted bids to the city
of Tustin for a smaller, undeveloped parcel without roads, sewers or
utilities that the city will get on the northeast corner of the base.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin officials said many of the former military houses on the
Irvine side of the base are less than 20 years old and can easily be
refurbished. Others will be demolished and rebuilt.</TE>
<TE>   The only remaining hurdle for redevelopment is a dispute between
the city and the Santa Ana Unified School District, which wants land
on the base for a school. A bill passed last year by the Legislature
requires Tustin to turn over 100 acres to Santa Ana Unified if
ongoing negotiations fail for a 22-acre parcel and $38 million in
cash.</TE>
<TE>   The city cannot zone its base property--a necessary step for
redevelopment--until the land dispute is resolved. Tustin and the
school district have been fighting for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't stopping the Navy from moving forward, Tustin City
Manager William A. Huston said. The Tustin land sale will occur
sometime this summer, and the Navy hopes that will provide enough
time for the city and the school district to reach a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we'll arrive at a deal before then," Huston said. "If
not, that's something we'll have to deal with. [The Navy] wants to
move on like the rest of us."</TE>
<TE>   Of the three parcels for sale, 94 acres are in Irvine and hold 550
houses. The rest are within Tustin in an area known as Tustin Villas.
The oldest neighborhood, Moffett Meadows, was built in 1964; the
other houses were built in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government will turn over 14 of the homes to Families
Forward, a nonprofit group that wants to use them to house homeless
people attending career development classes. The houses will stay on
site.</TE>
<TE>   Toxic contamination was found years ago near one of the housing
areas, according to the Marines. An area near Tustin Villas used for
helicopter operations was treated in 1996 to remove petroleum from
the soil.</TE>

<HD>Trial Set for Felon Facing 3rd Strike</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jury will determine competency of Santa Paula man
accused of shoplifting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury will determine the mental competency of a career criminal from
Santa Paula who faces life in prison for allegedly stealing $12 worth
of wine, breath spray and lip balm, a judge ruled this week.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge Frank Ochoa has scheduled a May
21 trial for convicted rapist and robber Ronald Steven Herrera.</LD>
<LD>   The trial will determine if he "is competent to cooperate with his
attorney," Santa Barbara County Deputy Dist. Atty. Darryl Perlin said
Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Herrera, 56, has spent 22 years in prison for raping a woman and
her teenage daughter in Ventura and for a series of robberies in
Virginia. He is now charged with burglary and petty theft for
allegedly shoplifting at a Von's store in Carpinteria in January.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Herrera faces 25 years to life in prison under the
state's three-strikes law. He has pleaded not guilty and remains in
custody in lieu of $250,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is whether Herrera can effectively assist his attorney,
said Deputy Public Defender Jeff Chambliss, Herrera's lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "The law says if you are unable to understand the nature of the
charges against you due to a mental illness or are incapable of
cooperating with defense counsel, you go to Patton [mental hospital]
until you are ready," he said.</TE>
<TE>   During a hearing last month, Ochoa questioned the defendant's
competency after Herrera, in a series of apparently rambling and
disjointed statements, asked whether he could represent himself at
the criminal trial.</TE>
<TE>   Herrera told the judge that Chambliss was capable of doing the job
but that he would rather present his own case, Perlin said. While
answering more questions from Ochoa, Herrera asked that a female
attorney represent him.</TE>
<TE>   "In the course of making this motion, he said a number of things
that made the judge feel that Herrera might not be capable of
representing himself," Perlin said.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa ordered two mental health experts to examine Herrera and
report back at Tuesday's hearing. Because the evaluations were not
entirely conclusive, Chambliss made the request for a more thorough
competency trial.</TE>
<TE>   If Herrera is found competent, a jury trial on the criminal
charges would be next, Perlin said. If not, he will be hospitalized
at Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino County for an undetermined
amount of time.</TE>
<TE>   Before his prison release in 1996, Herrera was one of the first
inmates in California ordered to a state mental health hospital under
the terms of the Sexually Violent Predator Act, which allows
prosecutors to place repeat sexual offenders in such facilities for
two-year increments after they had completed their prison terms.</TE>

<HD>Special Election Caps Are Pushed</HD>
<DH>Politics: Spitzer wants the $1,000 limit on contributions
that's in effect for primary and general campaigns to cover all
races.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Supervisor Todd Spitzer is asking his colleagues to amend Orange
County's campaign finance law so that if a special election is held
next year for his seat, it would be conducted with a $1,000 limit on
contributions.</LD>
<LD>   County law now limits contributions to $1,000 for candidates in
primary and general elections but doesn't mention special elections.
Voters last month created a new county charter, however, which calls
for special elections for supervisor. Vacancies in other county
offices are filled by the board.</LD>
<LD>   The charter, written by Spitzer, replaced the old method of
filling supervisorial vacancies: appointment by the governor. Spitzer
is the Republican nominee for the 71st Assembly District, which is
mostly Republican, and expects to be elected in November. He faces
Democrat Bea Foster, a Santa Ana teacher.</LD>
<TE>   Spitzer said he wants the contribution changes approved this
month; they would take effect 30 days after adoption. In the interim,
he said, it would be unfair for candidates anticipating a special
election to collect unlimited amounts.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the potential candidates would be hard-pressed to raise
money outside of it and not expect a public backlash," he said of the
county law, known as TINCUP, for Time Is Now, Clean Up Politics.</TE>
<TE>   Government activist Shirley Grindle, who helped write the county
law, said she included restrictions for special elections in the
original law, approved in 1978, but they were removed by the county
counsel's office.</TE>
<TE>   An amendment establishing the $1,000 limit was passed by voters in
1992.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors could adopt the proposed restriction on special
elections without voter approval because the board can limit campaign
activity on its own. Anything that would weaken the law, however,
would have to go before voters.</TE>
<TE>   Grindle said she is working with state officials to resolve
another campaign issue that cropped up during recent elections: the
use of slate mailers that feature mostly one candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton Councilman Chris Norby, who defeated incumbent
Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad in March and takes office in January,
benefited from a dozen slate mailers that either featured him or
criticized Coad and were funded in part by South County forces
opposed to an airport at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Grindle said she is working on an amendment to state law that
would limit the amount of space on a slate mailer that could be
devoted to a single candidate and would require payments to reflect
the amount of space provided.</TE>

<HD>Tax Man Gets His Due as He Sweetens Deal</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The familiar candy bowl was there, filled with treats for the
homeowners who lined up outside the Ventura County tax collector's
office Wednesday to meet their property tax payment deadline.</LD>
<LD>   But wasn't that a different man holding it?</LD>
<LD>   Yes, it was.</LD>
<TE>   Larry Matheney was on hand to answer questions about tax bills and
playfully joust with residents as they carried out a dreaded chore.
Following tradition, Matheney passed out Hershey's Kisses to people
who had their checks signed and ready to hand over.</TE>
<TE>   Matheney was elected to the treasurer-tax collector's post last
month. Although he won't officially take office until Jan. 1,
Matheney was filling in for the man who has carried out tax-day
banter for the past 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Harold S. Pittman, the county's tax man since 1988, is ailing from
a painful nerve disease and was unable to roam the tax counters.
Pittman, 62, dropped by for a short time Wednesday, but decided to
leave the taxpayers in Matheney's hands.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm realistic, and the way to get well is do what the doctor
says: Go home and get some rest," Pittman said.</TE>
<TE>   Pittman was diagnosed two years ago with myasthenia gravis, a
chronic neuromuscular ailment in the same group as multiple sclerosis
and lupus. He said the weakening in his muscles was aggravated late
last year when he was rear-ended in an auto accident.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes to be well enough to man the tax counter for payments due
in December--his last lap before retiring.</TE>
<TE>   "As their elected official, people have a right to meet the person
who is collecting taxes from them," he said. "I told Larry it's
important to have that personal touch."</TE>
<TE>   Matheney seemed to be learning that lesson fast Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   He worked the lines cheerfully, printing out copies of tax bills
for those who had lost theirs and joking with homeowners as they
waited in line. The county will take in an estimated $680 million in
property taxes this year, he said. That is up from $628 million last
year.</TE>
<TE>   "Check made out?" he asked one woman.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yeah," she groaned.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could make it smaller, I would," Matheney said.</TE>
<TE>   Hilda Hines, 62, of Santa Paula handed over $908. She always pays
in person, Hines said. Her envelope was addressed, simply, "Harold."</TE>
<TE>   "Harold has taken enough of my money over the years, so I figured
I should make the envelope out to him personally," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hines and her daughter, Ticia Foster, said they appreciate being
able to talk to Pittman and Matheney in person.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of living in a small county," Foster said. "The tax man
is on a first-name basis."</TE>

<HD>Court Hears Tape in Slaying</HD>
<DH>Law: Gang member is accused of playing role in fatal
beating of teen in 1999. Defense contends Ventura police coerced a
confession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura gang member on trial in the 1999 bludgeoning death of a
local teen told police detectives before his arrest that the victim
was a former schoolmate with whom he had partied and discussed
religion.</LD>
<LD>   Details of the friendship between Ramiro Salgado and victim
William Zara, an 18-year-old Ventura Theatre stagehand, were revealed
Wednesday during the first half of a two-hour, taped confession that
was played for the jury. It was the first day of Salgado's trial on
charges of taking part in a gang-related murder.</LD>
<LD>   "We used to talk about God in school," Salgado tells detectives on
the tape. "I used to like that guy."</LD>
<TE>   Salgado, 22, is charged with aiding as many as 20 fellow gang
members and associates in the Sept. 25, 1999, killing of Zara, who
was beaten in the head with a bat and shovel, stabbed and kicked.</TE>
<TE>   The angry mob, whose members had been drinking beer and listening
to loud music at a house across the street from Zara's Warner Street
apartment, attacked the teen because they mistakenly thought he had
reported their party to police.</TE>
<TE>   Four people have so far been convicted of murder charges in the
case, including 18-year-old gang member Benny Lopez, who inflicted
the fatal blows. All are serving prison terms of 15 to 32 years.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado, a former fast-food worker who aspired to join the Army,
has denied kicking and punching Zara or knowing it was Zara who was
being attacked. He claims his confession was coerced.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said, though, that he was part of the agitated mob.</TE>
<TE>   "This was one of the most chaotic, frightening, brutal attacks you
can imagine," Deputy Dist. Atty. Maeve Fox said during a two-hour
opening statement, which featured a computer presentation with
snapshots of the defendant's fellow gang members.</TE>
<TE>   "And Mr. Salgado was right there, one of those people in the
crowd," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The taped confession was obtained nearly a year after the slaying
when a gang member said Salgado was involved. On the tape, Salgado
tells Ventura Police Det. Pat Stevens that he had been drinking
tequila at the party when he saw 20 or 30 people walk toward Zara's
home.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado says he warned his friends not to go over because he knew
something bad could happen. At the start of the interview, he denies
being in the fray but gradually admits to seeing someone being beaten
badly. He says the last time he saw Zara was when the teen was loaded
into an ambulance that night.</TE>
<TE>   "I have dreams about him ... because I used to go to school with
him," Salgado says on the tape. "That was a mistake ... what they
did. That was bad."</TE>
<TE>   Today, as promised by Fox during her opening remarks, jurors will
hear the remainder of the tape in which Salgado confesses to
participating in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   But the admissions, considered by authorities to be the key pieces
of evidence, are a weak link in the case, defense attorney Richard
Loftus said. Loftus told jurors there was no doubt the slaying was
shocking, vile and disgusting, but that his client is the victim of
questionable police tactics in which coercion was used to get him to
admit some involvement in the beating.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado, Loftus said, was the target of similar tactics in 1998
when he was arrested and jailed on suspicion of stealing beer from a
local store. Detectives finessed a confession out of him, Loftus
said, but Salgado was released after a store surveillance camera
proved his innocence.</TE>
<TE>   Loftus also attacked the state's key witness, a gang member who
participated in the attack but who was granted immunity in exchange
for his testimony against Salgado.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no credible evidence ... to convict Mr. Salgado," Loftus
said.</TE>
<TE>   The trial resumes today. It is expected to last two weeks.</TE>

<LD>Despite a shortage of dwellings for sale, the number of homes and
condominiums sold by members of a west Ventura County Realtors group
soared 41% in March.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of single-family homes increased from 217 in February to 320
in March, and condo sales jumped from 72 to 88, the Ventura County
Coastal Assn. of Realtors reported.</LD>
<LD>   The group represents real estate agents in Oxnard, Ventura,
Camarillo, Santa Paula, Port Hueneme and Fillmore.</LD>
<TE>   The median price of a detached house dropped slightly from month
to month, from $304,500 to $299,000. The median is the price at which
half the homes sell for more and half for less. Median condo prices
increased to $200,000, from $188,500 the month before. But the median
asking price of 498 homes listed in March was $499,000.</TE>

<LD>J.D. Power &amp; Associates, the international marketing research firm
based in Agoura Hills, is moving its world headquarters up the road
to Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   This weekend the company will begin shifting about 350 workers to
a 93,000-square-foot, three-story building at 2625 Townsgate Road in
the Westlake section of the city. About 100 of those employees now
work at a facility in Newbury Park and will move later this month.</LD>
<LD>   "It doesn't mean a lot more jobs," said Gary Wartik, the city's
manager of economic development.</LD>
<TE>   "What it does is give the company more growing room. And as they
grow, that's going to benefit everyone in the Conejo Valley," Wartik
said.</TE>
<TE>   J.D. Power, best known for its automotive industry consumer
satisfaction surveys, has another California office in Orange and
other offices in Japan, Canada, Singapore, England and Australia.</TE>

<HD>Bracero Protest 'Caravan' Comes to L.A.</HD>
<DH>Labor: WWII-era guest workers say they're owed money that was
deducted from wages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alex Becerra stood a little way from the protest Wednesday outside
the Mexican Consulate, observing the old braceros bearing banners and
picket signs and singing Mexican folk songs that he remembered from his
childhood.</LD>
<LD>   He had heard the stories countless times from his father, who was a
bracero guest worker in Somerton, Ariz., during World War II, and he knew
what the protest was about.</LD>
<LD>   About 80 Mexican braceros and their families had gathered to support
the Braceroproa Alliance, a group that has been pressing American and
Mexican governments for reimbursements of up to $1 billion, money that
they say was deducted from their pay during the World War II-era bracero
program.</LD>
<TE>    Bracero advocates say American employers deducted 10% of each
worker's pay as a savings. The Mexican government was to return the money
when the braceros went home, but much of it was never refunded, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Becerra's father "told me a lot about this," he said, squinting
against the sun. "They made a lot of promises to him, and when he went
back to Mexico, they didn't give him anything."</TE>
<TE>   Becerra, 32, of East Los Angeles, said his father thinks the protests
are useless, because he has given up hope that he'll ever see the money.
But shortly after noon, when leaving the consulate on unrelated business,
Becerra felt compelled to stop and show support. "Because they took
everything from my father," he said. "This is good, this is real. The
government took a lot from a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's gathering was one leg of a symbolic "caravan" that started
with rallies earlier this month in Yakima, Wash., and will end in Mexico
City, where members of the alliance plan to lobby the Mexican Congress
for reparations. They also plan to deliver a symbolic message to
President Vicente Fox, said the group's founder and financial
coordinator, Ventura Gutierrez, 53, of Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez has collected nine pairs of cowboy boots, a new pair at each
rally point. When he gets to Mexico, he hopes to give Fox a pair that
fits.</TE>
<TE>   "His boots are worn out. We'll give him a new pair that fits him,"
said Gutierrez. "He's made too many promises already. With Mexican
politics, you have to beat someone over the head with a message so they
get it."</TE>
<TE>   Martha Jimenez of East Los Angeles said "justice needs to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Her father and uncles were braceros in Salinas from 1957 to 1964, she
said. "This is not only a Mexican issue, but a U.S. labor issue as well,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Crescenciano Ortiz said he has been waiting for justice since 1946. By
his count, the Mexican government owes him about $3,000. "They took the
10% deduction from everybody," he said through an interpreter. "When we
went back to Mexico, they didn't give us anything."</TE>
<TE>   Allegations that wages were unpaid triggered international protests, a
Mexican congressional investigation and legal actions in the United
States. About $28 million was paid to the workers by 1946, according to
records examined by The Times last year, and about $6 million is
unaccounted for.</TE>
<TE>   Those records also indicate the deductions were discontinued by 1949
and didn't continue until 1964 as advocates claim.</TE>

<HD>Two Security Gaps Reported at San Onofre</HD>
<DH>Public safety: Operators of the nuclear plant downplay the
post-9/11 incidents. But industry watchdogs are appalled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal review of safety at the San Onofre nuclear plant has
found that two security breaches occurred in the weeks after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, but that overall security is good.</LD>
<LD>  On Oct. 9, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors found two
unescorted visitors trying to use a visitor badge on an automatic
security device to gain access to the control room. When questioned, they
said they were trying to rejoin their escort. The inspectors told them
they did not have security clearance to enter the control room, and
remained with them until the escort returned.</LD>
<LD>  About three weeks later, inspectors watched a security guard search a
plant firetruck that was about to enter a protected area for a fire
drill. The guard performed a cursory pat-down of a duffel bag and moved
on. "Security personnel failed, until prompted by inspectors, to perform
a complete search of a station firetruck," the report says.</LD>
<TE>  The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, which is operated by
Southern California Edison, has two 1,120-megawatt reactors at its plant
just south of San Clemente that provide energy for 2.2 million homes from
Santa Barbara to San Diego. A third, older reactor is being
decommissioned.</TE>
<TE>  Federal inspection reports said both errors were of minimal concern.
San Onofre officials said they regret the mistakes, but urged the public
to remember the many successful truck searches and visitor tours.</TE>
<TE>  "Taken as an isolated incident, it has one appearance," said Ray
Golden, plant spokesman, "but when you look at the overall program ...
we're searching hundreds of trucks a month without these types of
shortcomings."</TE>
<TE>  Industry watchdogs were appalled.</TE>
<TE>  "If the private utility, at its highest state of alert and with [NRC]
inspectors physically on the grounds, still lets unescorted visitors into
protected areas and fails to adequately check vehicles, we're in a lot of
trouble," said Daniel Hirsch, director of the Los Angeles-based Committee
to Bridge the Gap and former director of the Adlai Stevenson program on
nuclear policy at UC Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>  Since Sept. 11, San Onofre and the nation's other 102 nuclear power
plants have been on the highest stage of alert. That means armed security
guards greet plant employees and visitors, public access to sensitive
areas has been discontinued, and technical information has been taken off
the plant's Web site. At the time, plant spokesmen said security at the
plant was ultra-tight.</TE>
<TE>  The report says inspectors determined both incidents had a credible
impact on safety, but according to a formula used by the NRC, were later
categorized as the most minor of breaches.</TE>
<TE>  Golden declined to say whether the employees involved were disciplined.</TE>
<TE>  Still, the NRC reported in a March 4 assessment of security from April
1 to Dec. 31, 2001, that overall, the plant's operations preserved public
safety and met federal goals.</TE>
<TE>  Nuclear activists say the agency is not taking security seriously
enough.</TE>
<TE>  "They certainly seem to be downplaying these things," said Steven
Dolley, research director of the Nuclear Control Institute in Washington.
"I don't think you can rely on such issues being treated rationally and
seriously all the time by the NRC."</TE>
<TE>  Hirsch said such incidents show the need for a bill by Sen. Harry Reid
(D-Nev.) to federalize nuclear power plant security.</TE>
<TE>   "It underscores the need to have security taken over by forces capable
of dealing with terrorists," he said.</TE>
<TE>  NRC and Edison officials will discuss the security assessment at a
public meeting at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the San Clemente Inn, 2600 Avenida
del Presidente.</TE>
