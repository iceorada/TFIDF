<LD>Hollywood, Sacramento and a Hollywood-loving ex-president came
together Friday night for what was billed as an evening of music,
message and comedy to benefit the environment.</LD>
<LD>   Music and levity were provided by the local version of the Soggy
Bottom Boys--Steve Martin, Christopher Guest and Tom Hanks--who
performed on banjo and guitars between comedy skits.</LD>
<LD>   When Hanks asked Martin why he had given up the banjo for acting,
Martin was quick to answer. "You never hear the following sentence:
'Oh look, it's the banjo player's Porsche.'"</LD>
<TE>   Martin Short quipped that he was honored to appear at the "Earth
to LA II!" event, benefiting the National Resource Defense Council,
even though he wasn't the organization's first choice. "Robert
Blake," he joked, "is such a different type."</TE>
<TE>   As the evening segued toward the serious, Leonardo DiCaprio (who
had a brief, if controversial, career as a journalist for ABC News in
2000 ) took care of the message, with an appeal to save the
environment.</TE>
<TE>   Carole King got more specific, asking Gov. Gray Davis, in the
audience, to help protect the California Channel Islands. Before she
left the stage, she also performed, with Mick Fleetwood backing her
up on drums.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was time for the political big guns. Seinfeld co-creator
Larry David introduced Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a senior NRDC attorney,
by comparing the David and Kennedy clans, observing among other
things that the Kennedys have great hair whereas "even the women [in
our family] are bald."</TE>
<TE>   Last to take the stage was the keynote speaker, introduced by
Hanks, who asked the audience to imagine the music from "The Dating
Game" as he did a voice-over, recounting the previous
administration's environmental legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "The big man," he intoned. "The guy I still like to call the boss,
William Jefferson Clinton."</TE>
<TE>   The former president told Hanks: "I didn't come up here to talk
about the environment. I came up here to meet Forrest Gump."</TE>
<TE>   The evening, which raised about $1.6 million, drew to a close, and
Hanks told the audience: "OK, you hippies, thanks for coming. Have a
safe carpool ride home."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Wadsworth Theater in Brentwood, a line of limos and
Range Rovers was parked by the curb, engines running, waiting to take
the hippies home.</TE>
<TE>   Heated Up for Film</TE>
<TE>   Soaring temperatures Sunday afternoon in Hollywood made the
long-awaited premiere of "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones"
a test of endurance for fans and eager ticketholders. It was enough
to make a fantasy villain melt. Two men dressed from head to toe in
white plastic armor hovered under an awning of Grauman's Chinese
Theatre as a reporter noted, "The storm troopers are seeking shade."</TE>
<TE>   Few of the film's stars turned up for the Mother's Day event,
primarily because they were scattered around the country at the 10
other "Star Wars" premieres Sunday. Hayden Christensen attended one
near his home in Toronto. Natalie Portman appeared in New York.
George Lucas and Carrie Fisher attended a premiere in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, Samuel L. Jackson, who plays Jedi knight Mace Windu,
arrived with his children in tow, praising the picture. "It's full of
information we didn't get before," he said. Nearby, Ahmed Best (Jar
Jar Binks), said his controversial role "has given me the opportunity
to never miss a meal." (Later inside the theater, he chided the
audience of about 1,000: "Anyone have a Jar Jar question? If you do,
keep it to yourself, because it's the only job I have in Hollywood
and I'd like to keep it!")</TE>
<TE>   On the red carpet, Billy Zane handed out tangerines to reporters.
"It's my popcorn," he explained. When one magazine writer tried to
engage the actor, Zane shouted: "Good scoop!" and marched off.</TE>
<TE>   Moments before the screening began, Ewan McGregor arrived from the
airport looking dressed for comfort. He flew in from Glasgow,
Scotland, where he's filming the British film "Young Adam," made a
quick tour of the red carpet, then raced back to the airport.</TE>
<TE>   All proceeds from tickets sales went to the Fulfillment Fund, a
nonprofit that mentors underprivileged children and helps fund their
college education. The group's chairman, Gary Gitnick, appeared
unaffected by the heat. He smiled, wiped his brow and said, "We
believe we'll get about $1 million today."</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "When Brian Grazer and I had just started photography on 'Night
Shift,' a comedy for Warner Bros. and the Ladd Co., we had gotten
some negative responses to the dailies and it was our first studio
feature and we were terrified of literally getting the plug pulled on
the whole film. I couldn't shake this image I had in my head of Brian
and I swimming around in a giant toilet bowl." --Director Ron Howard
talking about insecurity and the film business during his
commencement speech Friday to the USC Film School's Class of 2002.</TE>

<LD>Political novice and real estate agent Ely Dela Cruz Ayao had been
hospitalized in intensive care for nine nights with a
life-threatening virus of the nervous system when he started
bargaining with God: If I survive this, he prayed, I will do whatever
I am called to do.</LD>
<LD>   Six months later, after he had recuperated from Guillain-Barre
syndrome, he says, God responded. A member of the Republican Party in
the northeast Valley approached him about running for the 39th
Assembly District seat. A real estate broker since 1987 and owner of
First World Realty, Ayao was dumbfounded by the prospect. But the two
spent some time discussing crime, education and housing. Soon, Ayao
was convinced that this was his end of the bargain with God. He
agreed to run, despite the fact that the 39th District, which runs
from Sylmar to Sun Valley, is predominantly Democratic. In the March
Republican primary, he ran unopposed. He now faces Cindy Montanez in
the November election.</LD>
<LD>   "The reason we are having the problems we are having now," said
Ayao, 51, who lives in Panorama City, "is because we have a
Legislature that is dominantly Democratic and a governor who is
Democratic. Whatever the governor wants, he gets. I would like to be
the voice out there who says no to things. Since my line is business
and corporate management, I think I can use that expertise to help
run this government better."</LD>
<TE>   Born in the Philippines, Ayao earned a bachelor's degree in
business and immigrated to California in 1985. He is married to
Marilu Beltran, a registered nurse, and they have five children. One
of the founding members of the Philippine Jaycees of L.A., he has
received several humanitarian awards.</TE>
<TE>   As a legislator, Ayao says his priorities would be crime
prevention, affordable health care and affordable education.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that, despite her age, Cindy Montanez is well-versed in
governance," he said. "But this is an era of first-timers. The issues
I'm concerned with are universal issues, not partisan issues. People
... will listen to someone who has the real desire to serve the needs
of the people."</TE>

<LD>FOX GIRL</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Nora Okja Keller</LD>
<TE>   Viking</TE>
<TE>   290 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   There are stories you'd be foolish to enter without steeling
yourself emotionally beforehand. "Schindler's List" and "Sophie's
Choice" come to mind, both on page and screen, as does Tim O'Brien's
"The Things They Carried," all of which require a shoring up in order
to delve into the narrative and not be destroyed by what you find
there.</TE>
<TE>   Equally disturbing, riveting and necessary is Nora Okja Keller's
"Fox Girl," the tale of throwaway children and prostitutes stranded
in the aftermath of the Korean War. Following up on her first novel,
"Comfort Woman," in which Keller mined the same difficult terrain of
war, sex and power, "Fox Girl" tells the distressing first-person
account of Hyun Jin, a young Korean girl on the cusp of maturity
whose face is inscribed with a large birthmark and whose mother shows
her nothing but contempt.</TE>
<TE>   Yet compared to her friends, Hyun Jin is lucky. She's a stellar
student often put in charge of her classmates and has a doting father
who owns a shop and thus has an income. She is blissfully unaware of
what exactly goes on in America Town, an area where women prostitute
themselves and even their children to be able to buy food, where Coke
and other American products are the envy of all, and where, as Hyun
Jin comes to realize, "no one's free."</TE>
<TE>   Hyun Jin's best friend Sookie is a castaway child--the daughter of
a prostitute and some unknown GI--as is Lobetto, the son of an
African American solider who left with promises to bring him to
America but hasn't been heard from since. Lobetto has only the
years-old, worn-thin letter he carries as a talisman. Scorned by his
community for his mixed race, Lobetto works as a courier and pimp for
the women of America Town, including his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Hyun Jin knows herself to be better than these friends and in
quiet ways, lords her superiority over them. It is through Sookie and
Lobetto, though, that she slowly begins to understand the world into
which she's been born and the harsh realities that are about to
overtake her. Sookie's prostitute mother, Duk Hee, tries to prepare
Sookie and Hyun Jin for the rapacious, violent sex they can expect
from the American GIs. When Duk Hee gives Hyun Jin a package of
condoms for "protection," Hyun Jin makes a necklace with hers,
wearing it around her neck under her school uniform. "During tests, I
would touch my chest and feel the packet crinkle against my skin."
Such is the only type of protection she can envisage. But when
Sookie's mother fails to return from her weekly checkup at Dr. Pak's
Love Clinic No. 5 (Dr. Pak gives clearance examinations for "women
working as patriots of the Republic of Korea") and Hyun Jin begins
sneaking what little food she can to her abandoned friend, it isn't
long before these three young lives--Hyun Jin's, Sookie's and
Lobetto's--begin their rapid descent into the grown-up world of
hustling, heinous sex and constant hunger.</TE>
<TE>   All that Hyun Jin had previously known of this hostile world had
come from a parable of the fox who, by wrapping herself in the skin
of a dead girl, steals life from the boys she kisses, "trying to
regain what those boys stole from her." Both girls must now become
like fox girls, Sookie tells her after Hyun Jin is disowned by her
parents, if they are to survive.</TE>
<TE>   A brutal coming-of-age tale, "Fox Girl" is devastating, and yet is
leavened by moments of redemptory closeness among the three friends.
Through Keller's use of crisp writing, razor-sharp metaphors and
utter narrative command, we witness the destruction of Hyun Jin's
innocence by greed, bad luck and forces beyond her control, as she,
like innumerable others, becomes yet another unacknowledged victim of
war. Still, her spirit continues to demand a better life.</TE>
<TE>   Told in stark, painful, sexually graphic and heart-rending images,
"Fox Girl" is a story that haunts, with scenes that replay long after
the book is closed. Steel yourself before opening the pages, but,
surely, open them. This is a vital, urgent work, reminding us not
only of the horrors of war, but, as Sookie sees it, how "only
Americans believe in happy endings."</TE>

<LD>Under the Hollywood sign they came to rock 'n' roll--more than 700
gathered, most of them bold and beautiful and young and restless.
They chowed down, chugged beer and as the day heated up, eventually
peeled off clothes--women in bra tops showed off abs that could rival
Janet Jackson's and shirtless guys were ripped and ripe for
sunbathing.</LD>
<LD>   For six hours Lake Hollywood Park unofficially became
Hollywoodstock--just as low-rise Frankie B. jeans queen Daniella
Clarke envisioned the Saturday-in-the-park fashion fest to benefit
VH1 Save the Music Foundation, which raises money for musical
instruments and programs in schools.</LD>
<LD>   A carefree vibe was evident as regular folk mingled with the likes
of Leonardo DiCaprio, Minnie Driver, Tyra Banks, Carmen Electra,
Shannon Elizabeth and shirt-free Red Hot Chili Pepper Dave Navarro,
who sent several teens into the swoon zone.</LD>
<TE>   For non-stargazers, there were yoga sessions and quickie dance
lessons from strolling belly dancers eager to bump and grind on the
spot. Other guests roamed the park, listening and dancing to the live
music of Gilby Clarke (Daniella's hubby) and his band and soulful
songstress Nikka Costa.</TE>
<TE>   There were booths offering tie-dyeing, Tarot card reading, hair
weaving, body art and massage therapy. Rita Sahakian spoke about
"finding the goddess within yourself" with every mehndi tattoo she
drew.</TE>
<TE>   For the beauty-bound, there was eyebrow shaping and skin-care
consulting. Michael Baruch, chief executive officer of Fred Segal
Beauty, and his staff offered free microdermabrasion facials.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly, everyone--from grandpas in straw hats to pierced and
tattooed lovers of rock music and hip-hugging fashion--baked in the
sun while sprawled on blankets with friends, pets and family.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke, who unleashed her line of low-cut jeans on the world four
years ago, said she decided not to present her collection during
L.A.'s recent fashion week because she wanted to do something
different--and outdoors, reminiscent of Woodstock.</TE>
<TE>   As models, including Electra, hit the catwalk in Clarke's fall
2002 collection--a mix of tight jeans and tops in denim, velour and
the softest of corduroys--a throng of revelers surrounded the stage
for a better view as "Brown Sugar" blared.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted a real rock 'n' roll, kind of picnic fashion event,"
said Clarke, whose line is named for her 8-year-old daughter,
Francesca. "This was a major project to pull off."</TE>
<TE>   By the looks and sound of it, Clarke conquered. Guests applauded,
whistled and shouted during the show. A couple of guys even whipped
out their Bic lighters to salute the fanny-flashing fashion
parade--definitely a low-rise, natural-high moment.</TE>

<LD>When you hear the clatter of wheels and a shrill whistle, you know
that a train is heading your way. But 200 years ago people wouldn't
have known what to make of such sounds because trains weren't around
at that time!</LD>
<LD>   At first, people were hesitant to ride on these new vehicles.
Trains were noisy and smoky and sped along at a dizzying 20 to 30
mph. Can you imagine how fast that must have seemed to someone who
was used to traveling on land at about 3 mph by foot, or 8 mph in a
horse-drawn carriage? Why do you think people called the new trains
"iron horses"?</LD>
<LD>   Railroad companies wanted to convince people that train travel was
safe and fun, and they hired photographers to take pictures so people
could see what trains looked like. The photographs also showed the
exciting and beautiful sights that one could view from the window of
a train as it journeyed across the country. After daring to take a
train trip, travelers often liked to buy copies of these photographs
as souvenirs to show family and friends.</LD>
<TE>   You can see photographs of early trains and the routes they
traveled, and listen to old recordings of whistles, alarms, and
engine sounds made by locomotives at the Getty through June 23 (West
Pavilion, Plaza Level). The museum invites children ages 12 and
younger to stop at the information desk in the entrance hall to
receive a free train magnet. For more information or parking
reservations, call (310) 440-7300 or visit www.getty.edu. Parking
reservations are not needed Saturdays and Sundays or after 4 p.m.
weekdays.</TE>

<HD>Montanez, Ascending</HD>
<DH>A young and eager-to-serve Latina mayor eyes the next rung
on her political ladder</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARIA ELENA FERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here, at the Casa Torres banquet hall in San Fernando, it feels like
a family affair. The DJ is spinning rancheras and cumbias; the tacos,
enchiladas, rice and beans are quickly vanishing, and young children
are chasing after one another. It's a festive March night, promising
to be long, because the polls have just closed and there will be a
delay in the counting of ballots for this primary election.</LD>
<LD>   Ni modo. No matter. The 200 people gathered here will not leave
until San Fernando Mayor Cindy Montanez is pronounced victorious in
her bid for an Assembly seat. Some of the partygoers are her family
members; the rest might as well be.</LD>
<LD>   Everyone in the hall knows the northeast Valley's rising Chicana
politician and her gushing parents, both dressed casually, as they
work the room thanking their daughter's supporters. Manuel Montanez,
55, the candidate's father and top precinct walker, has spent long
hours convincing area residents to vote. His wife, Margarita, 55, is
the campaign's primary caregiver, feeding hundreds of volunteers her
popular carne asada, rice and beans.</LD>
<TE>   "They're a good example of how you can have little money but a lot
of passion for your kids," says Montanez, 28, "and amazing things can
happen in just one generation. My father taught us to think each day
what we can do to make everything better. Every night I go to sleep
thinking about how I can make tomorrow better than today."</TE>
<TE>   By night's end, Montanez is declared the primary's winner,
sweeping the election with 65% of the votes. But the crowd's
enthusiasm is about much more. In November, the mild-mannered Chicana
is expected to win the working-class, heavily Democratic 39th
District seat, joining the northeast Valley's undisputed political
Latino power base. As an assemblywoman, Montanez vows, she will make
public safety and school funding her priorities; she plans to expand
after-school programs, develop quality parks and recreation in all
neighborhoods and return to her first love of preserving historic
homes and cleaning up neighborhoods throughout the district.</TE>
<TE>   "This victory is a victory for our community, not for me,"
Montanez tells the crowd. "The northeast Valley is going to continue
to be a beautiful place to live and work because we're going to
continue to work together. Se los digo de todo corazon (I tell you
this from the heart)."</TE>
<TE>   Representing the district, which reaches from Sylmar on the
northern end to Sun Valley to the south, is a job Montanez has been
preparing for all her life without even realizing it. In the
one-bedroom house she shared with her parents and five siblings,
Montanez dreamed of becoming a city administrator who could improve
her community by refurbishing its Victorian homes and building a
library and performing arts center. She credits her affinity for
public service mostly to her father, who, despite working three jobs,
started a union at the plant where he worked and inculcated in his
children the idea of giving back.</TE>
<TE>   After her 12th birthday, Montanez committed all of her summer
vacations to community service work, volunteering to help organize
the pope's visit to Los Angeles, working as a peer counselor in
juvenile hall and as a candy striper in a hospital. Thin and shy,
Montanez cried easily and always preferred thinking to talking, her
mother says.</TE>
<TE>   But her sister, San Fernando City Councilwoman Maribel De La
Torre, saw something special in her little sister the day she learned
to ride a bicycle. All of the children were playing in the yard when
Cindy, then 5 or 6, hopped on a bike and asked her siblings to follow
her. Quickly, she took off and then fell.</TE>
<TE>   "She started crying, but then she got back on and continued to
ride," De La Torre says. "The thing that was amazing to me is that
she was able to mobilize us to be her support network and stick with
her until she completed what she wanted to do. That's what she's done
in this district. It's the way she's always operated: building
coalitions for a good cause."</TE>
<TE>   Mentors, such as state Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar), recognized
that ability as well when Montanez, then a student at UCLA, made
headlines by organizing a 14-day hunger strike in 1993 to bolster the
Chicano studies program. For two weeks, Montanez and seven others,
including her younger sister Norma, then a high school junior, drank
only water and inspired the support of civil rights activists and
Chicanos across the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   "That she was able to make that kind of decision at a young age
made me so proud," Manuel Montanez says. "I've always told all of my
children that the only way to truly help their community is to be in
... a decision-making position."Montanez interned at Alarcon's Los
Angeles City Council office and later quit UCLA to become his
legislative aide. Alarcon, who was impressed with her ability to
articulate the issues in San Fernando, said Montanez was a "bright
light that was so easy to see."</TE>
<TE>   It was in Alarcon's office, the San Fernando mayor says, that she
discovered the elected official's duty she loves most: following up
with constituent requests. Satisfying them made her curious about
running for office herself. In 1999 she was elected to the San
Fernando City Council, and she was appointed mayor last year. The
one-on-one contact with voters, she says, is what most drives her. "I
know I don't live the typical life of a 28-year-old," she said. "When
you're in this position, a lot of people look up to you, and you
should do a good job of fulfilling those roles."</TE>
<TE>   Her Youth Is an Issue</TE>
<TE>   Montanez was opposed in the primary by Yolanda Fuentes, 27, who
grew up in Pacoima and has worked as district director for state
Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama City) for four years. Fuentes
and Montanez ran on similar platforms, but Montanez raised four times
as much money in contributions and compiled an impressive list of
endorsements.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, critics have found fault with Montanez for choosing
to run for office before earning her college degree, for remaining
unemployed while serving on the City Council, and also for being
young. Her detractors argue that a young woman who has not completed
college or had substantial work experience is not mature enough to
run the daily operations of a city--or represent a large, diverse
district in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a working person. I belong to the union, and the majority of
our people are working people," says San Fernando Councilman Richard
Ramos, 33, who was elected to the council at the same time as
Montanez. "If you're not working, you can't speak to the issues that
working people have. I don't think Cindy has the work experience to
take a position, let alone to run for state Assembly. I just don't
think she represents the hard-working people of the northeast
Valley."</TE>
<TE>   But former San Fernando Mayor Raul Godinez II says voters should
not be quick to discount Montanez's City Council experience or her
many years of community activism. Godinez, 40, now the assistant
director for Oakland's public works agency, served on the City
Council from 1994 to 1999 and appointed Montanez to the city's first
cultural arts commission in 1995. Godinez withdrew his endorsement of
Montanez in 1999 because of her involvement with a protest against
the city while she was running for office, but he supports her today.</TE>
<TE>   "Is she perfect?" he asks. "None of us are. She was coming from a
college environment, an activist environment, and that was her
worldview. But the level of maturity and growth she's gone through is
phenomenal. I'm very impressed by her willingness to take an
unpopular side. Her unique resume, and the fact that she's younger
with the added dimension of being Latina, brings a different
perspective to the Assembly."</TE>
<TE>   Her upbringing, more than anything else, represents the ideals and
values of the working families of her district and helps her to
understand the needs of her constituents, says Montanez. She says she
intends to complete her bachelor's degrees in math economics and
Chicano studies after the election and pursue graduate work in urban
planning in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "My family has always been about hard work; that's what I'm
about," Montanez says. "In the world of policymaking, some people
start their work in their 40s or 50s. I may be 28, but for 16 years
I've worked consistently in this district. When I commit, I not only
commit myself but I commit the strongest team possible and a very
strong grass-roots effort that hasn't always existed. I do expect to
hold a strong leadership role in Sacramento. I grew up like the
people in this district, and I live like them."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up, the Montanez bunch--three boys and three
girls--possessed few material things and focused on keeping their
minds and bodies healthy, studying and practicing their Catholic
faith. The family did not own a television until Cindy was a
teenager, and she did not have her own bed until she was 13. Everyone
in the house was required to be fluent in English and Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   At 5 o'clock every morning, the family rose to run in the park. As
Manuel Montanez raced ahead with the older children, Margarita jogged
in the back with the younger ones. After classes, the children, all
nationally ranked swimmers, practiced after school with their
teammates. "I always believed that a healthy body fosters a healthy
mind," Manuel Montanez says. "To motivate them was very important to
me, and what better way than as a family?"</TE>
<TE>   In their spare time, the young children completed puzzles with
their mother, read books and helped their parents earn extra cash. On
weekends the family drove to Fresno to pick surplus tomatoes, oranges
and watermelons, and sold them on the streets in San Fernando,
directly across from where Montanez's campaign office sits today.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad would make a game out of it," De La Torre says. "He would
challenge us to see who could pick the biggest, greenest watermelon.
We never really looked at it as work or were ashamed of it. My dad
always made us feel so secure and proud of what we did."</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen years ago, after putting himself through electrician's
school at night, Manuel Montanez opened Montanez Electric, the
business he runs today with the help of his wife and all of his
children. But even greater than the family's entrepreneurial spirit
is its love for its community, says De La Torre, 31, who was elected
to the City Council last year. Her brother Roberto, 26, serves on the
San Fernando planning commission; brother Eziquiel, 32, is a teacher;
and brother Miguel, 29, is a librarian. Her sister Norma, 25, is a
homemaker and mother of three.</TE>
<TE>   The excitement and influence of the Chicano movement in the 1970s
also helped inspire her siblings and other young Latinos in the
Valley to strive for more, De La Torre says. "Who would have ever
thought the northeast Valley would have such a Latino power base?"
she says. "The immigrants who came here in the 1970s have such a
strong foundation of traditional Mexican values, support and
education. It couldn't help but create a generation of leaders. The
Chicano movement also laid the foundation for the kids who were
growing up. I think all of the right things happened to this
generation at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   The northeast San Fernando Valley, in fact, has become a Latino
political stronghold in the six years since Cardenas was elected a
lawmaker. Cardenas--a mentor to Los Angeles City Council President
Alex Padilla, who grew up in Pacoima--narrowly lost his bid for Los
Angeles City Council in March and has filed to run in the city's 2003
election. Fuentes, his district director, says she does not know if
she will run for office again.</TE>
<TE>   "As the Democratic nominee, I will support Cindy," Fuentes says.
"[But] coming from San Fernando, she's going to have to learn the
rest of the district, the different communities and the issues in
Sacramento."</TE>
<TE>   The primary now behind her, Montanez is excited and energized by
the general election ahead, in which she will run against Republican
Ely Dela Cruz Ayao, a real estate agent. The girl who was once the
shyest member of her family revels in the campaign trail she'll walk
until November, connecting easily with people from all walks of life
as she knocks on doors for support. San Fernando residents, in
particular, welcome her as if she were family, offering her avocados
and lemons from their trees, or meals when concerned mothers think
she is hungry. Frequently she peppers her conversations with
historical tidbits about the Valley's neighborhoods, making sure she
also asks personal questions to let residents know she is interested
in more than just their votes.</TE>
<TE>   "People feel more empowered when you deal with them in person,"
she says. Montanez's commitment to enfranchising Latinos motivated
campaign volunteer Miguel Mendevil, who lives in Whittier, to drive
100 miles round trip to help her get elected to a state seat that
doesn't even represent him. Mendevil, now a Los Angeles Unified
School District administrator, invited Montanez to speak to his
first-grade students last year at Laredo School of Social Justice in
Cypress Park about her job as mayor. He expected her to visit for two
hours, as most of his guests did. Montanez spent the entire day.</TE>
<TE>   "She brought them pamphlets about the city and her business cards,
and she helped them edit their papers and everything," he says. "She
did this in an area where she won't get any money, definitely no
votes, and there was no photo opportunity. This told me she was real,
and it makes driving 100 miles a day pretty easy."</TE>
<TE>   For Steven Veres, 26, supporting his friend is about more than
personal loyalty. By working for her campaign as a field coordinator,
Veres believes he is ushering in a new era for politics in the
Valley. "People have been dissatisfied with the way politics has
worked here for a long time. This is our chance to make a change," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   On primary night in March, Margarita Montanez tries to make a
speech, but her emotions get the best of her. Seeing her at the
lectern, next to Alarcon, makes the mother feel overcome. But later,
when she has collected herself, she says what is on her mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so overwhelmed by what I'm seeing here tonight, the way
people respond to her," she says. "But now she needs to respond to
her constituents. This is not for Cindy. This is about the northeast
Valley."</TE>

<LD>History teacher Gene Almeida took a group of high school students
from the California Academy of Math and Science, which meets on the
campus of Cal State Dominguez Hills and sends 95% of its graduates to
college. Across the aisle from them were Elijah Woodson's special
education students from Locke High School in South Los Angeles, where
three of every four ninth graders drop out before graduation.</LD>
<LD>   Screening for them onstage at the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum
of Tolerance was a PBS documentary that had messages for both groups
of kids.</LD>
<LD>   The film, "Partners of the Heart," tells the inspiring story of a
34-year partnership between a white surgeon and his black research
assistant that challenged racial prejudices and led to life-saving
advances in cardiac care. It was supposed to nudge toward a career in
science the high school students invited to its premiere last week.
But it offered other just as valuable lessons as well.</LD>
<TE>   For Woodson's kids, it was a chance to learn the meaning of words
like "cardiology" and "congenital" that were already familiar to
magnet school students. For Almeida's, it was a chance to see a
painful period of American history that had affected science and
medicine in ways they never dreamed. For all the students in
attendance, it was a testimony to the value of medical research, the
cost of societal prejudice and the power of perseverance and
humility.</TE>
<TE>   "Partners of the Heart" tells the little-known story of Vivien
Thomas, a black man whose dream of attending medical school
evaporated when he lost his savings in the Great Depression. He went
to work as a hospital janitor, but his talent was recognized by white
surgeon Alfred Blalock, who took him on as a lab technician. And in
an era when racial segregation kept the two men from even eating
lunch together at  Johns Hopkins University Hospital, they partnered
in 1944 to conduct one of the world's first successful heart
surgeries, pioneering a procedure that saved the lives of thousands
of so-called "blue babies," born with congenital heart defects.</TE>
<TE>   Later Thomas, with only a high school education, was awarded an
honorary doctorate and an official position on the faculty of Johns
Hopkins, where he helped train some of the country's most prominent
surgeons.</TE>
<TE>   "The film is much more than the simple story of a medical
discovery," producer Andrea Kalin told the student audience last
week. "It's a story of struggle and triumph" over social barriers and
cultural differences.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in the audience among her students from Monroe High School
in the San Fernando Valley was chemistry teacher Mary Stepter. She
didn't need a movie to acquaint her with the travails faced by black
pioneers in science. She grew up in Mississippi in the '50s and '60s,
when even the smartest black girls were steered toward menial jobs.
She got turned on to chemistry by an encouraging high school teacher
who "was willing to let me create," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She so loved what went on in that lab that she went on to major in
chemistry in college, even though she was the only black student and
the only woman in her classes at Texas Christian University. That
meant she did every experiment alone, because none of the white, male
students was willing to be her lab partner.</TE>
<TE>   Now the overt discrimination is gone, but obstacles to the pursuit
of careers in science and medicine remain. Stepter has no lab of her
own on the overcrowded campus, so she hauls her supplies on a cart
wheeled from room to room. The equipment must be minimal and
scaled-down to make it portable, so no complicated experiments can be
done. And she has just 58 minutes to unpack, prepare, teach and clean
up after what should ideally be a two-hour lab.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she had 73 students eager enough for inspiration that they
signed up to attend the documentary premiere last week, even though
it required extra homework and in-class assignments. "It broke my
heart," Stepter said, "that we only had room on the bus for 51. We
tell the students, if you really want something, don't let anything
stop you. Then we wind up leaving some kids behind."</TE>
<TE>   The state of science education is the subject of much
hand-wringing these days. Last year, California's eighth-graders tied
for last among 40 states on a prominent national science exam. In the
push for higher math and reading scores, California has de-emphasized
the kinds of hands-on science that encourages students to pursue
research.</TE>
<TE>   The deficiencies are particularly glaring among black and Latino
students in urban districts like Los Angeles, where students are
handicapped by a shortage of qualified science teachers and by
outdated, overcrowded labs.</TE>
<TE>   You can see the results of that gap in the crowd at Los Angeles
County's annual science fair, where the vast majority of the entrants
are typically white and Asian kids, most from suburban or private
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "That's something that concerns us, and we've started asking why,"
said science fair President Gilbert Dean. "It's not that kids of
color aren't able or interested, but there are obstacles some of
these kids have that other students don't face. Schools that don't
have computers, no money for materials.... Sometimes it's a
self-esteem issue that makes them think they can't compete."</TE>
<TE>   Last year fair officials launched an outreach campaign to knock
down those obstacles. They trained teachers to teach students how to
do research, recruited college students to act as mentors for
promising kids, got the Metropolitan Water District to donate money
for project boards and provide vans to ferry kids and their projects
to the competition. The effort paid off, as the number of schools
submitting science fair entries this year jumped from 89 to 160, with
many of the newcomers inner-city campuses that had not previously
participated.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the quality of the work these kids can do,"
Gilbert said, "you realize how important it is to help remove those
obstacles."</TE>
<TE>   And when you watch a movie like "Partners of the Heart," you
realize how much we owe to those who showed us that obstacles can be
overcome. And wonder whether we're doing all we can to encourage
every young scientist's aspirations.</TE>

<LD>"She's got your dimples, dear," said Grandma, patting the baby's back
lovingly. Mama's warm smile showed off her dimples.</LD>
<LD>   Jasmyn didn't have dimples. Sometimes when no one was looking,
she'd look into the mirror and press her fingertips deep into her
cheeks hoping to make some sort of dent. Nothing. No dimples.</LD>
<LD>   "Buurp!"</LD>
<TE>   "Did you hear that?" giggled Jasmyn. "She burped like Grandpa!"</TE>
<TE>   "Little boys burp and little girls bubble," Grandma reminded her.</TE>
<TE>   Even her burps were cute, Jasmyn thought. And why would Grandma
kiss her stinky toes? "Yuck," she cringed.</TE>
<TE>   "I can spell 'invisible,' said Jasmyn, wanting to show off.
"I-N-V-I-S--"</TE>
<TE>   Grandma interrupted, "She's wet again."</TE>
<TE>   "Jasmyn, get the baby a clean diaper," said Mama, as she folded
the baby's laundry.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever," she muttered. She took her sweet time walking up the
steps to the baby's nursery.</TE>
<TE>   She reached into a package and pulled out a doll-size diaper. It
had a baby-power fresh smell.</TE>
<TE>   "That's it!" Jasmyn said. "Everybody loves Baby Ashley because she
smells brand new."</TE>
<TE>   She sniffed the back side of her hand. Nothing. She smelled as
bland as a soda cracker.</TE>
<TE>   She wasn't sure when it happened, but her brand-new smell must
have worn off. But where did it go? And how could she get it back?</TE>
<TE>   "Jasmyn!" her mother called. "Could you please bring the
Baby-Be-Fresh?"</TE>
<TE>   She quickly snatched the baby powder and bounced down the stairs
like a kangaroo. She handed the diaper and powder to Grandma.</TE>
<TE>   "Be a good girl and toss this out," said Grandma, passing the
disposable diaper to Jasmyn.</TE>
<TE>   "Ohh, gross!" said Jasmyn, pinching her nose and dangling the wet
diaper at arm's length. Mama and Grandma giggled. Jasmyn didn't think
wet diapers were funny.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Webb works in the wee hours, rising about 2 a.m. and writing
on a laptop until nearly 6. Creating things that will have an
audience beats cleaning houses, acting as caretaker-manager for a New
Jersey nudist colony, picking fruit or clerking at Kmart, which is
what the author of "The Graduate" was doing, among other things,
during a 25-year publishing drought.</LD>
<LD>   And when he's done working and goes to the windows of his
apartment, this son of Pasadena, now 63, looks out on the cool and
mostly wet mornings of Brighton, on the southern coast of England. It
certainly beats a trailer park in Ojai, or a three-year stay at a
Motel 6 in Carpinteria, both of which he's called home.</LD>
<LD>   With a handsome new edition of "The Graduate" just published by
Washington Square Press--the play based on the book now running on
Broadway--and a well-received novel, "New Cardiff" (his first since
1976)--published last year and now out in paperback--Webb has made a
remarkable comeback. He and his wife, Fred, even have some financial
certainty after years on the margins of minimum wage, maxed-out
credit cards and bankruptcy, due to the six-figure movie-rights sale
of "New Cardiff."</LD>
<TE>   His agent, Caroline Dawnay, speaking from her London office at PFD
Ltd., Europe's largest literary agency, said, "It's been the fastest
turnaround this agency has ever known. From acquiring the rights to
releasing the film will have taken slightly less than a year--a great
tribute to Charles' talent." The movie, to be renamed "Hope Springs,"
will open in October and stars Colin Firth, Heather Graham and Minnie
Driver.</TE>
<TE>   It's good the check for the movie sale arrived. Webb receives
nothing from the new edition of "The Graduate," or from the
play--which grossed more than $14.5 million and, though receiving
poor reviews in New York, had an advance sale there of $5.3 million,
the record for a nonmusical. The theatrical rights were sold not long
after the book's original publication in 1963, and the novel's
copyright was given permanently to the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith in 1991. Reached by phone in Brighton, where he moved to
get away and experience a new culture, Webb said, "Though neither
Fred nor I are Jewish, we gave the rights to the ADL because we felt
they had influenced us in a profound way, to understand prejudice in
all of its forms and victims."</TE>
<TE>   He and Fred are no strangers to the grand, and sometimes
eccentric, gesture. Married in the '60s, they divorced to protest the
ban on gay marriage (only to remarry to smooth the emigration process
to Britain in 1998), and Fred, formerly Eve, changed her name in
solidarity with a support group of men named Fred who suffer low
self-esteem. "True story," Webb said, "but the original impetus was
for other reasons. 'My father always wanted a boy' would be closer to
the mark, although my father-in-law already had two of them, so his
appetite was seemingly insatiable in this regard."</TE>
<TE>   The author speaks about success and failure in the laconic manner
of an aristocrat who would find it bad form to complain or boast
about anything, a man equally at home in a cowshed or a palace. Never
bitter, Webb seems amused by most things, but added to his charm and
courtesy is a survivor's iron confidence. Asked perhaps one too many
personal questions, he responded with a gentlemanly but prickly sense
of humor: "Well, what do you think of this? Next time you're at your
dentist, what if you said: By the way, I'd be interested in knowing
more about your wife. Can I see a picture of her? Is she your first
wife? Have you ever been sued? Are you straight or gay? Do you have
affairs? How much money do you make?"</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1939 to the son of a successful doctor and, "I suppose
we'd have to call my mother a homemaker," Webb boarded at a prep
school in Santa Barbara and then went on to Williams College in
Massachusetts. He won a writing prize at graduation that allowed him
enough money for the two years it took to write "The Graduate." Mike
Nichols' 1967 film soon transformed his creation into part of
American cultural history.</TE>
<TE>   Reading the novel, one is struck by how Buck Henry's script merely
transcribed it, almost scene by scene, line by line, but with two
notable exceptions: The word "plastics" is never mentioned, and the
novel doesn't demonize Southern California. (The film's first line,
also not in the book, is a pilot's announcement, "Ladies and
gentlemen, we are about to make our descent into Los Angeles.") Webb
said, when asked about this, "If I'd grown up in Peoria, it would've
been the same book. I'm happy it's out again."</TE>
<TE>   The roots of his distinctive style can be traced to a trip to
London during his college years, when he saw "The Caretaker," by
Harold Pinter. "It was the one piece of writing that moved me more
than anything else. The dialogue, characterizations, it really stood
out, an electrifying experience." In "The Graduate," you can see
Pinter's influence, especially the deadpan sense of menace beating at
the heart of ear-perfect exchanges. Question marks are eliminated
where they would normally be employed, which adds a note of
alienation between characters who aren't terribly interested in
answers anyway but are conversing by rote, barely hearing one
another.</TE>
<TE>   The novel holds up well because of its stripped style and the
absence of politics, historical events, brand names, fashion or any
reference that would place it in a particular era. It's a good bet
that certain young people will always understand this tale of
youthful inertia, chronicling a few months in the life of a young man
with a first-class education but no ambition and less hope, at sea in
a culture he finds grotesque, honest enough to say: "I don't see any
value in anything I've ever done and I don't see any value in
anything I could possibly ever do. Now, I think we've exhausted the
topic. How about some TV." Shipwrecked in the real world, he embarks
on an affair with his father's law partner's wife, one of the great
villains of American fiction, Mrs. Robinson. It is only when he falls
in love with her daughter, and then loses her, that he sees the
course he has to follow.</TE>
<TE>   "Benjamin is part of a long line of naive, confused, innocent
heroes in the coming-of-age tradition of Holden Caulfield," said
Morris Dickstein, Distinguished Professor of English at City
University of New York, author of "Gates of Eden," the seminal study
of 1960s culture, and the just-published "Leopards in the Temple," an
examination of postwar American fiction. "'The Graduate' is a
generation-gap story, pitting the unspoiled freedom of youth against
the sterility of their middle-class families. Its point of view is
that older people live unhappy, materialistic, sexually frustrated
lives and impose their boredom on the young. That's why it touched a
nerve in the '60s. It's a declaration of independence, of
generational rebellion in the name of greater innocence and purity of
motive."</TE>
<TE>   Six other novels followed, none approaching the success of "The
Graduate." Asked if one of them, "Booze," a story of an alcoholic
artist, was in any way autobiographical, Webb said: "I've never had
that particular problem, though I had a lifelong smoking habit. I
finally kicked it, working in Hackettstown, New Jersey. I had to. Any
drug limits your perceptive horizons. And at that point in my life,
I'd drifted into this job at Kmart, which on one level I thought of
as a great lark. But it was a horror show. I felt I was limiting my
clarity of mind. To see my way out of it, I discovered a connection:
I'm either going to keep smoking and stay here forever, or quit and
leave the job. The day I quit Kmart was the day I quit smoking."</TE>
<TE>   Webb speaks of the years without an audience as a "hiatus" and
"not wanting to be distracted by the publishing process." He referred
to the new novel, a love story and comedy of manners about an artist,
Colin, and two women he's involved with. Colin hasn't worked in a
while and says, "Some artists go for years without doing any work....
It's common with creative people." But then later he says, "I've lost
my art, and I don't know what to do." And finally, a startling
admission: "I've been leading a secret life, the life of someone
slowly losing their sanity."</TE>
<TE>   He's completed a screenplay with the working title "Home School"
and is in the middle of a play. He doesn't read much. "Every writer
is supposed to provide a list, aren't they, of what they're reading.
After writing and thinking and thinking about writing, when I'm done
for the day, I'm not much interested in more fiction. I watch
'Eastenders,' this great soap they have over here. In the States, I
was addicted to 'All My Children.' Brighton's interesting; it's like
the West Hollywood of Europe. Getting a perspective on one's self by
leaving one's culture is important. I felt like I was soaked in all
things American." He paused. "It's always good to go away."</TE>

<LD>Hearing Adrian Lyne talk about Diane Lane, the co-star of
"Unfaithful," his new film about a happily married woman's affair
with a younger man, you begin to understand why almost any actress in
America would happily do anything--including strip naked--to be in
one of this director's movies.</LD>
<LD>   "Diane breathes a kind of eroticism you just don't see very often
in Hollywood," Lyne explained over lunch at his Benedict Canyon home,
his voice husky and low, as if he were in the confessional. "Sexy
women in Hollywood tend to be tough or hard. But Diane is vulnerable
and totally natural. I was desperate to take all her makeup off
because she looked so naturally beautiful--she just has this
wonderful smeared, ragged kind of radiance."</LD>
<LD>   When Lyne was filming the scene in which Lane first meets her
lover, played by Olivier Martinez, he'd whisper in her ear before
each take, "Vulnerable. You're vulnerable," he says. "When you're
making a movie, you get this astonishing intimacy with actors--it's a
lot like having an affair."</LD>
<TE>   When it comes to sex, Lyne is the expert. For the past two
decades, the 61-year-old British-born director has made a series of
titillating morality tales that often ended up being debated on the
op-ed pages--the New York Times' Maureen Dowd weighed in Sunday with
her take on the movie's portrayal of scorned men and straying wives.
His films have provoked critical derision and sent feminists into
high dudgeon.</TE>
<TE>   Lyne's movies have a common theme; they chronicle people whose
lust sends their lives careening out of control. He is Hollywood's
poet laureate of headlong erotic abandon. What makes Lyne so unusual
is that he has continued to probe these affairs of the heart in an
era when sex has virtually disappeared from Hollywood movies.</TE>
<TE>   His first big hit, "Flashdance," was a female-empowerment fantasy,
starring Jennifer Beals as a welder by day, bar dancer by night. The
movie got awful reviews, but its sleek visuals inspired hundreds of
copycat MTV videos. Next came "91/2 Weeks," the saga of a sexually
obsessive relationship between Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger. That
was followed by "Fatal Attraction," which starred Michael Douglas as
a happily married man who has a fling with a sexpot who turns out to
be a psycho.</TE>
<TE>   Not long afterward came "Indecent Proposal," with Robert Redford
as a high-roller who offers a young married couple a million bucks if
he can sleep with the wife (Demi Moore) for one night. Most recently,
Lyne directed a remake of "Lolita," the Vladimir Nabokov novel about
a middle-aged man's self-immolating obsession with a 12-year-old
nymphet.</TE>
<TE>   Typically for a Lyne film, "Unfaithful" has inspired mixed
reactions. While critics have raved about Lane's performance, opinion
has been split about the movie itself. The film had a good opening
weekend ($14.1 million) but in tracking polls men showed little
interest in seeing a movie in which a beautiful wife cheats on a
husband who's a doting provider.</TE>
<TE>   Lyne says that when he showed the film to test audiences, some men
were so enraged by Lane's betrayal of her husband, played by Richard
Gere, that he stopped reading their reaction cards. Focus groups
would erupt in heated arguments. "One of the men would say, 'I can't
understand how this woman could have an affair when her marriage was
so good. It's such a slutty thing to do.' And women would go crazy.
They'd literally pounce on the guy, saying, 'That's the point, you
idiot! You do irrational things when sex is involved.'"</TE>
<TE>   Films from around the globe still deal frankly with carnal
relations, whether it's Alfonso Cuaron's current "Y Tu Mama Tambien"
or recent French films like "Romance" and "Baise-Moi." But in
America, where "Sex and the City" is a huge cable-TV hit, R. Kelly
concerts have more raunchy crotch-grabbing than any strip-club show,
and Internet pornography is almost as big a business as the defense
industry, mainstream movies have been curiously chaste. As critic
Michael Atkinson puts it, in today's Hollywood "the sex scene is
cinema non grata."</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1970s, sex was a hot dramatic topic in such movies as
"Shampoo," "Carnal Knowledge," "Don't Look Now" and "Last Tango in
Paris." Today sex is on the backburner, relegated to a subject for
teen snickering or to indie films like "Mulholland Drive" and
"Monster's Ball."</TE>
<TE>   What's changed? Just about everything. Movies in the 1970s were
still an adult medium, in which filmmakers grappled with serious
dramatic issues like the sexual revolution that were part of the
cultural zeitgeist. Today's movies are allergic to reality: They're
mostly superhero fantasies, like "The Scorpion King" and
"Spider-Man," or gimmicky romantic comedies, like "Kate and Leopold"
or "40 Days and 40 Nights."</TE>
<TE>   Rob Cohen, director of last year's hit "The Fast and the Furious,"
says a movie like 1987's "The Witches of Eastwick" could never be
made today. "You'd never get three major movie actresses willing to
squirm around in bed with the Devil, even if it was Jack Nicholson,"
he says. "You have a whole new generation of movie stars who are very
prudish today."</TE>
<TE>   Lyne's "Lolita" was turned down by every studio in town before
eventually airing on Showtime. "I can't imagine that we would've had
trouble releasing it in the 1970s or 1980s," he says. "But after the
JonBenet [Ramsey] case, there was this international obsession with
pedophilia. Wherever I took the film, the corporate executives were
petrified of being involved with condoning pedophilia."</TE>
<TE>   Lyne says he spent six weeks in an editing room on "Lolita" with
an attorney at his side, telling him what to keep in and what to take
out. "There was an atmosphere of real paranoia. At one point we were
frightened to send the film across interstate lines to New York."</TE>
<TE>   When Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has two statues of partially nude
figures at Justice Department headquarters covered with blue drapes
for his TV appearances, it would not be a stretch to say that we're
in a period of profound sexual repression.</TE>
<TE>   But the New Economics play just as big a role as the New
Puritanism. With most movies aimed at teens, studios want films with
a PG-13 rating. "There can be a 40-million or 50-million-dollar
difference between a PG-13 and an R movie," says Cohen, whose film
"XXX" is due in August. "You need to keep your movie sexy without it
being sexual. We have a scene in 'XXX' where a guy nuzzles a girl's
breast, but you can't show a nipple or any nudity without tipping it
into 'R' territory.</TE>
<TE>   "So in a lot of movies you end up with more sexual tension than
sex, which must be why we're all walking around with tension
headaches."</TE>
<TE>   Today's young moviegoers also seem to have a different attitude
about sex. In the 1970s, cinema sex was groundbreaking. Today, with
sexual imagery in practically every corner of the culture, sex isn't
such a hot topic. "Sex is so in your face, from advertising to music
videos to kids' clothing, that you have to wonder, what is there left
for an artist to explore?" says DreamWorks production chief Michael
De Luca.</TE>
<TE>   "If great young filmmakers like Paul Thomas Anderson, David O.
Russell, Alexander Payne, Wes Anderson and Darren Aronofsky wanted to
pursue the subject, they could get movies made about it. But either
they don't feel it's especially relevant to their lives or they think
it's already been explored."</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers who still have a passion for sexual
pyrotechnics--Lyne, Philip Kaufman ("Henry &amp; June") and Paul
Verhoeven ("Basic Instinct")--are all men in their 60s who came of
age at a time when sex was still a taboo subject, a juicy forbidden
fruit for an audacious artist. That's not to say that sex isn't
firmly on the mind of every teenager in America. But as a dramatic
topic, as De Luca puts it, "it's the property of an older generation
of filmmakers and moviegoers. And unfortunately, the last demographic
that studios chase after is middle-aged moviegoers."</TE>
<TE>   Call me middle-aged (ouch!), but I think young moviegoers are
missing out. Drama is all about exploring our dark side, and what's
best about "Unfaithful" is the way it unveils the turbulent emotions
that lurk under our skins, even in the coziest relationships.</TE>
<TE>   When Gere first begins to suspect something could be amiss, he
asks Lane, "Do you love me?" She soothingly responds, "What a silly
question." And then she walks out of the room and turns off the
light, leaving her husband in the dark, having already forgotten he
was there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the little moments that give away what people are feeling,"
says Lyne. "I hope moviegoers will recognize things like that as
something they've done or could've done themselves."</TE>
<TE>   I ask him where the idea for the scene came from. "Oh, my wife did
it to me once," he says dryly. "Though I hope she did it for
different reasons."</TE>

<HD>NBC Stands Pat; ABC Draws</HD>
<DH>Television* The latter goes with family-friendly shows such
as 'Dinotopia' in the fall, while the former's lineup features
relatively minor tweaking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can dinosaurs help breathe life into a network whose ratings have
been on the brink of extinction?</LD>
<LD>   ABC will apparently find out, attempting to jump-start a
prime-time schedule perceived to be in free fall during the current
television season by offering family-based programming at 8 p.m.
Monday through Friday next season--including a weekly series version
of the just-premiered "Dinotopia" to go up against "Friends" and
"Survivor" on Thursdays.</LD>
<LD>   The network, which will present its revised fall schedule to media
buyers today in New York, is assembling a prime-time roster that
includes seven new series while making this spring's unscripted hit
"The Bachelor" and "America's Funniest Home Videos" components of its
lineup.</LD>
<TE>   "NYPD Blue" is also expected to return to its former 10 p.m.
Tuesday beat, though ABC has canceled producer Steven Bochco's other
drama, "Philly," along with the existing comedies "Dharma &amp; Greg,"
"Spin City" and "The Job."</TE>
<TE>   ABC will also be without "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," which
occupied four hours on its schedule less than two years ago. The show
will return later in the season, after a daily, early-evening version
makes its debut on local television stations.</TE>
<TE>   ABC had already initiated production on episodes of "Dinotopia,"
though it wasn't thought the fantasy-oriented concept could be ready
when the season gets underway in September because of its special
effects. The six-hour production opened to impressive ratings Sunday,
averaging nearly 17 million viewers and building over the course of
its two hours.</TE>
<TE>   "Dinotopia" represents a major gambit for ABC Entertainment
President Susan Lyne, who oversaw movies and miniseries before being
promoted to her current position in January, with ABC's poor
performance leading to the ouster of predecessor Stu Bloomberg.</TE>
<TE>   The network's steep ratings decline has prompted officials at the
Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC, to acknowledge their active
involvement in putting together the lineup, with six of the seven new
series produced by Disney.</TE>
<TE>   ABC wasn't discussing its plans Monday, but sources said "The Drew
Carey Show" and "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" will move to Monday
nights, where they will precede "Monday Night Football" in most of
the country and follow it on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Three new comedies will join the Tuesday lineup along with the
first-year sitcom "According to Jim," while "The George Lopez
Show"--which premiered this spring--will apparently retain the
Wednesday slot following "My Wife and Kids." "The Bachelor" finds a
home Wednesdays versus "The West Wing," with ABC seemingly emboldened
by the fact that CBS and Fox enjoyed some success in that hour with
unscripted series "The Amazing Race" and "Temptation Island,"
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The new comedies are "Eight Simple Rules," featuring John Ritter
as the father of teenage daughters; "Life With Bonnie," starring
Bonnie Hunt as a talk-show host; and "Less Than Perfect," being
likened to "Bridget Jones's Diary."</TE>
<TE>   The other dramas are "That Was Then," about an adult man who gets
to go back to high school as a teenager knowing what he knows now,
expected to follow "Funniest Videos" on Fridays; "Push, Nevada," an
interactive mystery targeted for Thursdays; and "Meds," about
crusading young doctors, penciled in for Wednesdays.</TE>
<TE>   NBC, meanwhile, officially unveiled its lineup Monday, which NBC
Entertainment President Jeff Zucker proclaimed "the most stable
schedule of any network," allowing NBC to focus its promotion behind
a handful of new properties. Four nights remain unchanged, with NBC
introducing a pair of Sunday-night dramas and a trio of comedies
designed to pump some new blood into the aging "Must-See TV"
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Zucker also stated that NBC's expectations are "incredibly
realistic" for "Scrubs," the first-year show that will shift from
Tuesdays to follow "Friends" in the fall--a time slot that has
claimed its share of casualties. The network has been quick to
proclaim the show a hit, even though it is declining 25% from
"Frasier's" audience in the preceding half-hour.</TE>
<TE>   NBC also said that "Watching Ellie," its comedy starring Julia
Louis-Dreyfus, will return sometime next season, albeit minus the
ticking clock in the corner of the screen that counted down the time.
Despite the show's poor ratings, Zucker said the network still feels
Louis-Dreyfus is a bankable TV star. The network has three episodes
left from this season and would not discuss how many more will be
ordered. Competitors were quick to characterize the renewal as a
face-saving maneuver for NBC, which bombarded those tuning in for the
Winter Olympics with promos for "Ellie" and "Leap of Faith," which
has been canceled.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's new hourlong shows are the L.A.-based crime drama "Boomtown"
and the 1960s coming-of-age series "American Dreams." The sitcoms are
"In-Laws," about newlyweds who move in with the bride's parents,
played by Dennis Farina and Jean Smart; "Hidden Hills," a satiric
look at couples in the suburbs; and "Good Morning Miami," about a
struggling morning TV show.</TE>
<TE>   Here is NBC's fall schedule (new programs are in italic):</TE>
<TE>   Sunday: "Dateline NBC," "American Dreams," "Law &amp; Order: Criminal
Intent," "Boomtown."</TE>
<TE>   Monday: "Fear Factor," "Third Watch," "Crossing Jordan."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: "In-Laws," "Just Shoot Me," "Frasier," "Hidden Hills,"
"Dateline NBC."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: "Ed," "The West Wing," "Law &amp; Order."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: "Friends," "Scrubs," "Will &amp; Grace," "Good Morning
Miami," "ER."</TE>
<TE>   Friday: "Providence," "Dateline NBC," "Law &amp; Order: Special
Victims Unit."</TE>

<HD>They Sing a Song Man's Praises</HD>
<DH>'A Class Act' sometimes loses its way as it revisits Edward
Kleban's work, but Robert Picardo's portrayal steadies this Pasadena
Playhouse show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the production that opened at the Pasadena Playhouse on Sunday, "A
Class Act" emerges as an ambitious but curiously self-destructive
musical about ambition and self-destruction in the musical theater
world.</LD>
<LD>   It wants to be a backstage musical about the creation of the
greatest backstage musical of all time, "A Chorus Line." But it
reduces director-choreographer Michael Bennett and composer Marvin
Hamlisch to nasty cartoons and the creative process to near-parody.</LD>
<LD>   It wants to be a revealing biography of Edward Kleban, who wrote
the lyrics for "A Chorus Line," as well as music and lyrics for a
number of shows that never made it to Broadway. Though we're told
that Kleban sabotaged every opportunity he had for success after "A
Chorus Line," we never see anything of the sort but rather focus on a
series of mundane love relationships, some fictional.</LD>
<TE>   Most of all, "A Class Act" wants to be a celebration of Kleban's
talents as a songwriter. But after culling showstoppers from those
failed Kleban projects, it gives us only one song performance that
actually stops this show: Luba Mason in glorious full cry for the
ballad "The Next Best Thing to Love."</TE>
<TE>   As written by Linda Kline and Lonny Price, "A Class Act" remains
so obsessed with the facets and failures of Kleban's personal and
professional life that it demands a brilliant, antiheroic star
performance.</TE>
<TE>   Happily Robert Picardo is superb, not only deftly ironic and
believably complex in the role but someone you believe could actually
have written the spectacular Kleban lyrics we hear all evening.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Picardo plays not Kleban, but Kleban's ghost: In what he
calls "a Thornton Wilder return," he materializes during his 1988
memorial service, reliving his life to prove that things were better
than some of the mourners keep saying.</TE>
<TE>   But Picardo's performance makes success and failure, shows and
lovers largely irrelevant: We care about him because he's unfailingly
interesting and deeply human--while no other character, however
brightly performed, seems more than a collage of mannerisms, except
perhaps for Lenny Wolpe's warmly paternal sketch of Broadway
conductor Lehman Engel.</TE>
<TE>   However, even Picardo can't redeem some of the dialogue, as when
Kleban learns he has cancer and tells an ex-girlfriend who happens to
be a cancer specialist, "You can always fix the second act," and she
replies grimly, "The second act is trouble, Ed."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, we're always only a minute or two away from the next
Kleban song, and under Price's direction, blocks of light and color
pierce the funereal black of James Noone's set once those songs take
over. We get mirrors, of course, for the "Chorus Line" sequences
(plus a revolving platform), but the sharpest design invention may be
a ghostly panorama of Broadway marquees displaying the titles of
Kleban's failed musicals a la "Jerome Robbins' Broadway." Call it "Ed
Kleban's Limbo."</TE>
<TE>   Costumes by Carrie Robbins and choreography by Marguerite Derricks
do little more than keep the action grounded in a sense of period,
but the musical direction of Steve Orich inspires faith in Kleban as
a fine Broadway composer (not only a lyricist) and sustains the
feeling of a major Broadway production even with an eight-member cast
onstage.</TE>
<TE>   However several lead women could use a Mama Rose backstage,
screaming "Sing out, Louise," just before their big numbers. Michelle
Duffy, for instance, grows alarmingly anemic in what should be Mona's
sure-fire, lascivious seduction ditty, and Donna Bullock as
long-suffering Lucy never deigns to sell a song but stays merely
tasteful and promising when stronger options beckon.</TE>
<TE>   As the overbearing Felicia, Nikki Crawford does go for broke, but
she's principally used for comic relief, while Andrew Palermo and
Will Jude double Bennett and Hamlisch with roles as generic nonentity
friends. Mason, as mentioned, sings magnificently as Sophie but can't
bring this amalgam character to life.</TE>
<TE>   And that leaves Picardo to turn "A Class Act" into his
property--acting, singing and dancing (sort of) his way to glory,
making us sad he's dead and glad he's alive, whatever it takes.</TE>
<TE>   God keep him safe and well at least until June 16. "A Class Act"
may have been nominated for a 2001 Tony Award as best musical, but
what we feel about it and about Edward Kleban depends completely on
him.</TE>

<LD>Having struggled fruitlessly to establish sitcoms on Sunday nights,
the WB network will move its comedy lineup to Thursdays opposite
NBC's sitcom block in the fall, while shifting the established dramas
"Charmed" and "Angel" to Sundays.</LD>
<LD>   Relocating "Angel" opens a slot after the WB's top-rated program,
"7th Heaven," to launch what the network considers its most promising
drama, "Everwood," starring Treat Williams as a widowed surgeon who
chucks his life in Manhattan and moves his family to the fictional
small town of Everwood, Colo.</LD>
<LD>   It's one of six new series that will premiere on the network,
which will officially present its revised prime-time schedule today
to advertisers in New York, including a revival of the 1960s comedy
"Family Affair," with Gary Cole and Tim Curry in the roles played by
Brian Keith and Sebastian Cabot, respectively. That series will go up
against NBC's "Friends," followed by "Do Over," one of two new series
set for the fall (the other being ABC's "That Was Then") that
involves a grown man going back in time to reexperience his teenage
years.</LD>
<TE>   Continuing the WB's teen orientation, Nickelodeon star Amanda
Bynes will star in a new sitcom, "What I Like About You," which will
lead off Fridays. The WB has also ordered "Greetings From Tucson,"
about a family in which the father is Latino and the mother is Irish,
told from the perspective of their teenage son.</TE>
<TE>   After achieving success this year with the Superboy series
"Smallville," the network will try another superhero concept from DC
Comics (like the WB, a unit of AOL Time Warner) with "Birds of Prey,"
about a trio of female heroes. (The WB is also partly owned by
Tribune Co., which owns the Los Angeles Times.)</TE>
<TE>   The WB will open Sundays with reruns from the first season of
"Gilmore Girls," having previously employed a similar strategy that
helped establish "7th Heaven" early in its run.</TE>
<TE>   The network has dropped the sitcom "Raising Dad," starring Bob
Saget, as well as "Maybe It's Me," "Nikki" and "Felicity," which will
air its finale next week. "The Steve Harvey Show" also finished its
run earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   The WB spreads 13 hours of original programming across six nights,
compared with 22 hours on the three major networks and 15 on Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Here is the WB's fall schedule (new programs are in italics):</TE>
<TE>   Sunday: "Gilmore Girls" reruns, "Charmed," "Angel."</TE>
<TE>   Monday: "7th Heaven," "Everwood."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: "Gilmore Girls," "Smallville."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: "Dawson's Creek," "Birds of Prey."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: "Family Affair," "Do Over," "JKX: The Jamie Kennedy
Experiment," "Off Centre."</TE>
<TE>   Friday: "What I Like About You," "Sabrina," "Reba," "Greetings
From Tucson."</TE>

<HD>Shock Waves Issue From Jumppanen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Paavali Jumppanen was aiming to make an especially splashy
impression in his California debut at Schoenberg Hall Sunday
afternoon, he succeeded. The sandy-haired, 27-year-old Finnish
pianist clearly has stupendous technical ability and the stamina of a
heavyweight champion, taking on and conquering Rachmaninoff's
finger-smashing Etudes-Tableaux, Opus 39--not just one or two (that
would have been taxing enough), but all nine of them.</LD>
<LD>   Yet before he made his splash, Jumppanen made a statement, one
that was no less attention-grabbing. Reversing what would have been a
conventional sequence, Jumppanen opened with Ravel's "Valses Nobles
et Sentimentales" and then played Mozart's Sonata No. 17, as if to
say that Mozart shouldn't be taken for granted as a mere warmup for
the main courses. And though the Ravel was somewhat mannered and
fussy in patches, the Mozart was extroverted and large-boned, with an
astounding variety of coloring in the finale at a lightning tempo.</LD>
<TE>   Tchaikovsky's Dumka ("Russian Rustic Scene"), in which Jumppanen
provided bursts of impetuous drive, served as a preview of coming
attractions. After the break, he went to work on Rachmaninoff, at
times giving the Steinway a furious battering with raw, metallic
sonorities in the deep bass but also bringing out subtleties of color
in the right hand. Jumppanen has a good feeling for the style, with
plenty of expressive yet not excessive rubatos, and occasionally he
produced visceral shock waves of near- Horowitz-ian proportions.
Tchaikovsky's "June" Barcarolle and "November" Troika, from "The
Seasons," were the encores.</TE>
<TE>   What we didn't hear Sunday was Jumppanen's contemporary side. He
is reputed to be a formidable champion of Dutilleux, Boulez and
various Finnish compatriots. Maybe next time, and, we hope, soon.</TE>

<HD>Catalyst for Dialogue Is Lost</HD>
<DH>'The Vagina Monologues,' which departed from the L.A. stage
on Sunday, afforded an opportunity for understanding and for
liberation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the raucous musical comedy "The Full Monty" continues to dance
over the surface of male sexuality at the 1,600-seat Ahmanson
Theatre, "The Vagina Monologues," Eve Ensler's probing social
commentary on the mystique surrounding the female genitalia, closed
Sunday at the 280-seat Coronet Theatre on La Cienega.</LD>
<LD>   To even a casual observer it may come as no surprise that the
vagina would end its run without fanfare in a small, dark theater,
while the penis is downtown, on the big stage, starring in its own
Broadway show.</LD>
<LD>   When it comes to recognition on the L.A. theater scene, size
matters. But there's an argument to be made that, even though it
inhabited a comparatively small venue, with the closing of
"Monologues," Los Angeles loses a still-vital catalyst for dialogue.
It's a show with a remarkable ability to change and grow with each
different cast--and one that reveals more about sexual shame,
self-discovery and liberation than the winking, fun-loving "Full
Monty" ever will, even though the cast of "Monologues" never
literally drops its pants.</LD>
<TE>   Ensler's "Vagina Monologues" began as a one-woman show starring
Ensler, later developing into a reader's theater piece for three
women, with the performers sitting onstage on stools, usually with
minimal set decoration.</TE>
<TE>   For the Los Angeles production, said one of the producers, James
B. Freydberg, casting always included one younger woman, one older
woman and a "woman of color," although there were no set rules as to
which woman would perform which monologue in each cast.</TE>
<TE>   The piece was inspired by Ensler's own history as a survivor of
childhood incest and abuse. The monologues, some hilarious, some
somber, are based on interviews with 200 women, and include frank
speeches such as "My Angry Vagina," "Because He Liked to Look at It"
and "The Flood."</TE>
<TE>   Although it started small, "Vagina Monologues," easy to move and
cheap to produce, has become a theatrical franchise, a veritable
McVagina. It has toured the world and drawn a wide range of
celebrities to the stage (even Erin Brockovich, in Toronto) since it
took the New York theater world by surprise at a SoHo theater in
1996. In 1998, Ensler and other organizers created an annual "V-Day,"
observed every Valentine's Day to raise money to end violence toward
women. In February, a version of "Monologues" was presented on HBO.
Productions continue in New York and other cities.</TE>
<TE>   "Monologues" also had a long and healthy life in L.A.: The show
opened at Beverly Hills' 382-seat Canon Theatre in October 2000, with
audiences clamoring for tickets to see the all-star cast of Julianna
Margulies, Rosie Perez and Julie Kavner. The production lasted there
until December of last year. After multiple casts, the show had
started to run out of big Hollywood stars to revolve through the
roles, and attendance began to drop.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the producers decided to take "Monologues" to the
smaller Coronet Theatre in hopes of relieving some of the financial
pressure to fill seats.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran producer Freydberg , Tony Award winner for "Fool Moon" and
producer of numerous critically acclaimed shows on both coasts,
believed the move would also allow the opportunity to take some
casting risks, introducing talented actresses whose names might not
be known from movies or TV. That list included the warm and funny
Rose Abdoo, a veteran of Chicago's Second City Theatre, who appeared
in the final cast with former MTV VJ Julie Brown and the glamorous
Tia Carrere.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   "My friends and I used to open the paper and say: 'Who's doing it
this time?'" a rueful Abdoo, who also performed in a Chicago
production of "Monologues," said in a phone conversation a few days
before the show closed. "Now, I think they open the paper and say:
"Who is Rose Abdoo?' They want to say: 'Wow, it's that girl I used to
love on 'Dallas' or 'One Day at a Time.'"</TE>
<TE>   Freydberg blames the situation on competition from the recent HBO
"Monologues," as well as Los Angeles' obsession with movie and TV
stars. "New York is a theater town; after a while, it didn't matter
at all who was in it," he said. (This observation must be taken with
a grain of salt; although I {heart} NY as much as anyone, tell me no
Manhattanite ever goes to see Jane Leeves in "Cabaret" just because
she's on "Frasier.")</TE>
<TE>   Probably more realistic, and certainly less irritating, is
Freydberg's other observation about why a show can run for years in
New York and not in L.A.: "In New York, your first three to six
months, or even nine months, off-Broadway is the New York audience,
and then it switches to the tourist audience that is there to see
theater," he said. "People don't come to L.A. for three days and
decide they're going to see three shows. They don't even decide to
see one."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, "Vagina Monologues" wasn't drummed out of town in L.A.
and enjoyed a longer run here than any show in recent memory,
enjoying an audience that Freydberg reported to be about 65% women
when it played at the Canon. Abdoo notes that, in Chicago, the male
audience increased when a local critic observed that a performance of
"Monologues" was a great place to meet women.</TE>
<TE>   "After doing this show for a week or so, you begin to think
differently about being a woman; you begin to feel like we must be
very powerful people if [men believe] we need to be anchored down and
held in check," said Phylicia Rashad, a member of the second
"Monologues" cast at the Canon.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a conversation with a young man in my family who saw the
show, and I asked him: 'Do you think men are afraid of women?' His
answer was most interesting," she said. "He said: 'Men are
intimidated by women.' I said: 'Why?' He said: 'A man plays games
with a woman all the time, but once a woman figures out the game, it
no longer is a game.' I almost ran the car off the road, he was
speaking so honestly."</TE>
<TE>   And certainly there's some truth in this observation by a Chicago
theatergoer about why a "Vagina Monologues" is needed more than a
"Penis Monologues." (Although that title has been used for a few
short-lived, jokey satires in various cities, as well as a "Saturday
Night Live" skit, there's really never been a serious attempt to
create a male version of Ensler's confessional show.) Said the fan:
"Every show is 'The Penis Monologues'; every movie is 'The Penis
Monologues.'"</TE>
<TE>   Producer Freydberg agrees. "I don't think that men are put down by
that part of their body as women are; these monologues are about
women finding equality," he said. "I don't think a 'Penis Monologues'
would have any viability; men are not afraid to talk about that."</TE>
<TE>   Or are they?</TE>
<TE>   Freydberg spoke of his first reaction to "Monologues," years ago
in New York. "I got it all. I knew exactly what to do with it," he
said excitedly--then added, after a long pause: "But then, I had a
whole different life experience that was similar to what some of the
women go through in the show, so I basically understood what this
was." How so? He didn't want to talk about it. "No. Not for the
newspaper. No."</TE>
<TE>   I thought about what Freydberg didn't tell me while watching the
10 o'clock news the same day of our conversation. Two men, flanked by
their lawyers, were talking about something that happened years ago
with their priests, hesitantly, but in words as harsh and graphic as
anything in "Vagina Monologues." Both spoke until they started
weeping--not freely, but in those raspy, inexperienced guy sobs that
sound like the opening of a rusted hinge.</TE>
<TE>   Which makes one wonder if the only reason there hasn't been a male
answer to "The Vagina Monologues" is not because the penis has
already been spoken for, but because men remain, in some ways, more
afraid to speak than women. At least in the theater, men don't have
their Eve Ensler yet, haven't really offered their monologue--and
despite all that singing, dancing and stripping at the Ahmanson, have
yet to reveal the full monty.</TE>

<HD>Cole Tries to Step Out of King-Size Shadow</HD>
<DH>The similarities to his older brother have hurt more than
helped Freddy's career. Yet he displays unique talent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dilemma facing Freddy Cole becomes immediately apparent every
time he sits down at the piano and begins to play and sing. It's
called Nat King Cole. The uncanny vocal similarities between older
and younger siblings have made it extremely difficult for Freddy
Cole, who is Nat's junior by 12 years, to receive the attention that
his talents warrant.</LD>
<LD>   Cole didn't get around to addressing that dilemma in his
performance at the Cal State Northridge Performing Arts Center on
Sunday until the end of his set. Singing the humorous "I'm Not My
Brother, I'm Me," he made a jovial effort to deal with the situation
directly. Unfortunately, he also somewhat undercut that effort by
adding a medley of his brother's tunes that included such mega-hits
as "Mona Lisa," "Straighten Up and Fly Right" and "Sweet Lorraine."</LD>
<LD>   All of which simply tended to underscore Cole's dilemma. But the
fact is that the vocal resemblance to his brother is considerably
modified, even enhanced, by his own sound's rougher, somewhat more
emotionally edgy qualities. Blessed with the attractive appeal of
what clearly seems to be a Cole family vocal quality, his singing
adds an easygoing connection with the blues and a briskly swinging
approach to phrasing.</LD>
<TE>   Working at CSUN with the fine backing of guitarist Jerry Byrd (who
handled most of the instrumental solo chores), bassist Zachary Pride
and drummer Curtis Boyd, Cole devoted the opening half of his program
to a mixed bag of less frequently heard standards such as "It's
Crazy," "Them There Eyes," "Invitation" and "Love Walked In."</TE>
<TE>   Cole punched out the words in an instrumentalist's fashion, rarely
holding notes, phrasing his lines to produce the most effective
rendering of the songs' stories. His piano playing was serviceable if
not especially intriguing, working best when he used it to counter
and punctuate his singing.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half of the bill, he moved more firmly into the
blues orbit--a familiar and compatible arena for him--adding a few
Brazilian songs from his new album, "Rio de Janeiro Blue." The
results were equally engaging, especially during a seductive
rendering of Oscar Brown Jr.'s lyrics for Luiz Bonfa's classic "Manha
de Carnaval."</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was finished, it was hard to avoid the thought that
Cole's dilemma is the jazz world's dilemma. At a time when male jazz
vocal artists are in short supply, he has all the qualities required
to rise to the top of the genre. One can only hope that the pleasures
of the Cole family sound, combined with the unique talents of the
Freddy Cole manner, will energize that ascent.</TE>

<LD>In a long Sunday night of music, poetry and art at the Palace in
protest of post-Sept. 11 U.S. military actions, the truest words
spoken from the stage may have been about the event itself.</LD>
<LD>   "Performance isn't strictly performance. It's ritual. We are here
tonight for ritual," said poet-rapper Saul Williams midway through
the nearly eight-hour "ArtSpeaks! A Concert Against the War," put on
by the Artists Network of Refuse &amp; Resist.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, rituals from past protest and pop culture movements shaped
the event. L.A. ensemble Ozomatli, honored with the organization's
Cultural Resistor award for its stance after the attacks, screened
Vietnam-era film clips in its set. Bay Area rap acts the Coup (given
the same award) and Blackalicious slotted their criticisms alongside
throw-your-hands-in-the-air hip-hop rituals.</LD>
<TE>   The event's titular slogan, "Not in Our Name," lacks the
rhetorical wallop of "Hell, no, we won't go" or "No justice, no
peace," and the emotions of the situations in the spotlight can be
contradictory.</TE>
<TE>   While art projected throughout the evening and chants and
commentary from various speakers and emcees were pointed, there was
little outright topical music.</TE>
<TE>   That's not actually bad, given the pedantic nature of most protest
music. As always, Ozomatli led by example, letting its culturally
blended lineup and music be the message. The Coup and Blackalicious
offered sharp observations, but little specifically about the topics
at hand.</TE>
<TE>   In an event that also featured hip-hop artists Mystic and Dilated
Peoples, Moroccan rock from Hassan Hakmoun and progressive jazz from
the Pan Afrikan People's Arkestra, the most pointed call for peace
came in brief remarks by Ji Sung Kim, who had family members on the
second plane that crashed into the World Trade Center. And the most
effective representation of the issues and emotions came in a video
of Brooklyn-based Palestinian American poet Suheir Hammad performing
the first piece she wrote after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Laying out a personal perspective with passion and grace, the
piece concludes with a statement worth ritualizing: "You are either
with life or against it. Affirm life."</TE>

<LD>   Both Sides Appeal</LD>
<LD>   in James Brown Case</LD>
<TE>   Soul singer James Brown and the woman who won a
wrongful-termination lawsuit against him have both appealed the
verdict, their attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Agbalaya claimed Brown fired her as West Coast president of
New James Brown Enterprises because she rejected sexual advances he
made when she visited his Georgia home in 1999. She sued the
69-year-old "Godfather of Soul" for $1 million for sexual harassment,
retaliation, wrongful firing and infliction of emotional distress. A
jury awarded Agbalaya about a year's salary for wrongful termination
($40,000) but rejected the other charges.</TE>
<TE>   Brown wants the judgment against him overturned. He denied that he
made any unwanted sexual overtures to her and testified that Agbalaya
was laid off after he closed his West Coast office because it wasn't
making money.</TE>
<TE>   Agbalaya's attorney, Shelly McMillan, also has asked for a review,
saying there were problems with the handling of evidence and jury
instructions.</TE>

<TE>   Warwick Arrested</TE>
<TE>   on Drug Charges</TE>
<TE>   Dionne Warwick was arrested at Miami International Airport on
Sunday after 11 suspected marijuana cigarettes were allegedly found
in a lipstick container in the singer's carry-on luggage.</TE>
<TE>   Warwick, a five-time Grammy Award-winner and cousin of Whitney
Houston, was scheduled to fly to Los Angeles when screeners noticed
what they described as a suspicious item in her carry-on bag. The
singer was charged with possession of less than five grams of the
drug and released after signing an affidavit promising to appear in
court.</TE>
<TE>   Warwick, 61, who became famous in the 1960s for songs such as
"Walk on By" and "I Say a Little Prayer," could not be reached for
comment.</TE>

<TE>   Pavarotti Hints That</TE>
<TE>   He May Soon Retire</TE>
<TE>   Luciano Pavarotti has hinted that he might retire from singing
following his cancellation of two performances of "Tosca" at New York
City's Metropolitan Opera House last week.</TE>
<TE>   His last-minute withdrawals on Wednesday and Saturday, triggered
by a bout of the flu, were greeted disapprovingly by audiences
attending what was expected to be the legendary tenor's swan song at
the venue.</TE>
<TE>   According to BBC News, Pavarotti wrote an open letter to fans,
some of whom paid up to $1,875 for a concert-dinner gala,
unapologetically explaining that his voice wasn't strong enough to
perform. He also told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that
he might be forced to consider retiring soon. Though he has no future
dates booked at the Met, he is scheduled for future arena concerts
and recitals.</TE>
<TE>   "The media seem to imply that the New York opera public will not
forgive my cancellation," he said. "But forgiveness assumes that one
has made a mistake; no matter how much I regret with a passion not
being able to sing at the Met on this occasion, catching the flu was
certainly not a willful mistake I made."</TE>

<TE>   Sotheby Victims Get No Financial Satisfaction</TE>
<TE>   Many of the 130,000 customers filing a class-action suit against
Sotheby's and Christie's have yet to collect any money, the New York
Times reports. This, despite the fact that a year has passed since
Manhattan Federal Court Judge Lewis A. Kaplan approved a $512-million
agreement between buyers and sellers who lost millions in the
price-fixing scheme concocted by the two auction houses.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, A. Alfred Taubman, former chairman of Sotheby's, was
sentenced to a year and a day in prison for his role, and Diana D.
Brooks, the chief executive, is facing six months of house arrest,
three years' probation and 1,000 hours of community service.</TE>
<TE>   Because a Manhattan law film has filed an appeal on behalf of
customers who say the settlement is unfair, the money can't be
released. And the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in
Manhattan says that the situation is compounded by the inability of
lawyers to settle on a hearing date.</TE>
<TE>   Not so, says Richard Drubel, a lawyer representing the customers:
"We have been available since December. We call every week to try to
get a date, but no results so far."</TE>

<HD>The Promise of Things to Come</HD>
<DH>As he leaves the Young Musicians training orchestra,
conductor Wilson Hermanto proves his leadership qualities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wilson Hermanto, the personable young conductor from Indonesia, led
the final concert of his three seasons as music director of the Young
Musicians Foundation Debut Orchestra on Sunday afternoon at the
Wilshire Ebell Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Now he moves on. That is what conductors of this marvelous
training orchestra do. Hermanto, who next season becomes assistant
conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra, is a proud addition to a
47-year-old list of YMF successes that includes Andre Previn, Michael
Tilson Thomas, Lawrence Foster, Myung-Whun Chung and Neal Stulberg.</LD>
<LD>   A conductor needs many attributes, some that can be learned, some
that develop over time and some that are natural. Hermanto still has
much to learn and discover, as he demonstrated in a performance of
Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony that had many fine and exciting moments
but was not yet of a piece. Even so, his skill was obvious. He has a
clear stick technique. He is a natural leader who generated
confidence and enthusiasm from his players (ages 14 to 25). And he
made the whole thing sound like he was having a lot of fun (grim
symphony though it can be). It is a work for him to grow into, and
Sunday there was plenty of evidence that he will.</LD>
<TE>   But more impressive was what he, and an exceptional young pianist,
Amir Khosrowpour, did with a far worse piece, Lowell Liebermann's
Piano Concerto No. 2. Growth wasn't necessary to get to the bottom of
this derivative score, which was written in 1992 by an American with
a Rachmaninoff complex. But who cares that Liebermann's thematic
material sometimes sinks to the level of warmed-over wide-screen
1950s biblical epic accompaniment? For Hermanto and Khosrowpour, it
was an occasion for joyous music making.</TE>
<TE>   A word about Khosrowpour. He is from Irvine and is a junior at the
University of Kansas. He does not yet know his way around the stage
and seemed unsure about taking bows, deferring to conductor and
orchestra. But he knows his way around the keyboard. The Liebermann
concerto has a devilish solo part (although on a recording by British
virtuoso Stephen Hough, for whom the work was written, the piano
writing sounds slick as snake oil). Khosrowpour played it with
irresistible verve, unpretentious directness and fingers of steel. I
doubt that Kansas will be able to contain a talent of this size for
long.</TE>
<TE>   Hermanto was a great help as well. Liebermann's most impressive
technique is as a colorful orchestrator, and he provided the YMF with
much opportunity to show off. Once again, these young players brought
to the work a sparkling life missing from the hard-sell recording,
with the BBC Scottish Symphony under the composer's direction.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of immediacy also made Schumann's "Manfred" Overture and
the Tchaikovsky Fourth winning. Hermanto is a propulsive interpreter
with a flair for sharp rhythmic articulation and clear textures. He
has a complementary lyrical sensibility. And while he did not connect
all the points in Tchaikovsky and Schumann, both of whom are
long-range composers, most of the key moments brought out the best in
his orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   Not everything, of course, was spot on, and by not taking the
repeat of the exposition in the symphony's first movement, Hermanto
missed an opportunity to get the quiet opening in the strings right.
He did take an unconventional repeat, however, that worked
splendidly. He brought the symphony to a smashing close, and then,
for an encore, he reprised the coda, faster. This was the sound of
adrenaline rushing, and just the thing to propel this promising
conductor to Cleveland and America's best orchestra.</TE>

<HD>A Promising Prognosis for 'Scrubs'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Patient name: "Scrubs."</LD>
<LD>   Date of birth: Oct. 2, 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Symptoms: The chief complaint is anxiety over the end of the first
season, which will occur next Tuesday, preceded by an episode tonight
at 9:30 on NBC.</LD>
<TE>   Diagnosis: The patient exhibits signs of hysteria and an active
imagination, envisioning itself in a hospital populated by interning
doctors named J.D. (Zach Braff, in actuality), Turk (Donald Faison)
and Elliot (Sarah Chalke). They can be tormented by taskmaster Dr.
Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins), ridiculed by the oddly heroic Dr. Perry Cox
(John C. McGinley) and vexed by fellow interns and even the janitor
(Neil Flynn). This altered state of reality has resulted in mildly
delusional, "Ally McBeal"-esque moments and dramatic tension undercut
by uncontrollable fits of laughter.</TE>
<TE>   Upon examination, the patient is concluding a two-part episode
tonight in which Dr. Cox's former brother-in-law (Brendan Fraser) is
battling leukemia, with J.D. helping to treat him.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Turk must come to terms with the fact that he isn't as
good as he thinks he is; and Elliot and Nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy
Reyes) get their chance to exact revenge on Dr. Kelso. All of these
scenarios point to the basic difficulties of how to face the truth,
something the patient clearly has deep-seated issues with.</TE>
<TE>   Further examination reveals that "Scrubs" is lacking a laugh
track; however, because laugh tracks are vestigial, the patient is
better off without one.</TE>
<TE>   Prognosis: With all vital signs holding strong and regular
Thursday night sessions planned for next season, the outlook is good.</TE>
<TE>   If laughter is the best medicine, "Scrubs" has all the means to
cure the anxiety and lead a fulfilling life.</TE>

<KH>BEHIND THE WHEEL</KH>
<HD>Road Scholars Driven to Go the Extra Mile</HD>
<DH>A small but dedicated band of buffs spends free time
studying and, yes, traveling the state's highways and byways.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some people in California--perhaps the majority of them--see highways
as a necessary nuisance, something to complain about on the way to
and from work, maybe, but certainly not worth contemplating during
their free time.</LD>
<LD>   Then there are people like Mike Ballard.</LD>
<LD>   He once spent three vacation days voluntarily organizing old
records at Caltrans' Sacramento headquarters, where the librarian
knows him by name. He owns 40 years' worth of Chevron gas station
maps, and a set of concrete road markers adorns his front yard. He
has adopted a two-mile stretch of Interstate 5 in Kern County so
he'll have an excuse for legally parking on the freeway, getting out
of his car and poking around.</LD>
<TE>   In other words, roads are Ballard's hobby, one he devotes himself
to with the same enthusiasm others reserve for bird-watching or
collecting vintage glassware. A sometime college student and Santa
Clarita native, he may be the only person ever to set a goal of
driving the entire California highway system--all 16,622.16 miles of
it. It only seems fair to ask: Why?</TE>
<TE>   "I ask myself that often, and I'm not totally sure," laughs
Ballard, 23. "I chalk it up to my curiosity. I'm just always
wondering what places once looked like."</TE>
<TE>   Although Ballard's obsession might seem a little offbeat, he is
not the only native son with a serious road trip. He is part of a
small but dedicated group of highway enthusiasts who spend their
leisure hours thinking about, studying and, yes, driving the state's
roads, making a serious pastime of something most folks take for
granted.</TE>
<TE>   Where the average motorist observes only a uniform blur of green
and white whizzing past the windshield, for example, Joel Windmiller
of Sacramento finds human foible in freeway signs and scours every
one for misspellings and other bureaucratic bloopers. And while other
drivers probably give little thought to the nonsequential numbers
identifying state highways, Daniel Faigin, an aerospace engineer from
North Hills, sees them as pieces of an intriguing puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   After researching the history behind every highway naming and
numbering, Faigin, 42, published his route-by-route findings on a Web
site, www.cahighways.org. The project led to other interests, and his
site now includes pages on proposed transportation legislation,
updates on actions of the California Transportation Commission, and
the latest Caltrans news.</TE>
<TE>   "When you start looking at the history of highways, it takes you
into a lot of areas, like railroads, architecture and politics," said
Faigin, who attributes his own status as a self-described "road geek"
to his "very geographic mind."</TE>
<TE>   Like Faigin and Ballard, Andy Field, 29, of San Diego has been
fascinated with highways for as long as he can remember. During car
rides with his family as a child, he would pore over maps and imagine
what towns he'd never visit looked like.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting a road atlas was like a major gift for me," Field said.
"I would write in them where I thought roads should be."</TE>
<TE>   He abandoned the pastime when he was in high school--"It wasn't in
vogue. No one wanted to go out and look at road signs with me"--only
to rediscover it during college in Wyoming. "I went back to my atlas
and plotted how I would renumber all the interstate and U.S. routes
in the country," he said. But it wasn't until he returned to
California and discovered a road-related Internet newsgroup that he
felt comfortable identifying himself as a highway groupie.</TE>
<TE>   According to Field, "disbelief and relief" were his reaction upon
realizing, "Oh, my God! There are other people out there like me.
Finally, I have someone I can talk to about this stuff."</TE>
<TE>   After meeting online, he and several other California-based
highway buffs have become friends who accompany each other on field
trips. Last spring, a group of seven people that included Field,
Faigin and Casey Cooper, 28, a road enthusiast from Orange County,
spent a day exploring bridges, new freeway construction and signage
in Riverside and San Bernardino counties. (An account of their
outing, complete with pictures, is available on Field's Web site,
www.aaroads.com.)</TE>
<TE>   When they are not on the road, they indulge their hobby by
reading. Windmiller, the Sacramento-based highway junkie, regularly
visits Caltrans headquarters to scout out the latest reports for his
friends. Cooper is the envy of his traveling companions because he
owns a lot of back issues of "California Highways and Public Works,"
a magazine published by Caltrans' predecessor from 1911 until 1967.</TE>
<TE>   "I read them all the time," he said. "It's fascinating to me
because these are historical documents and they offer a lot of
insight of how people thought back then. Whether they are talking
about highway projects in terms of jobs during the Depression or
building freeways to service the suburbs during the 1950s,
ultimately, roads are a metaphor."</TE>
<TE>   Although their areas of interest overlap, each has a slightly
different take on roads. Ballard and Cooper, for instance, are
chiefly attracted to historic roads. Faigin is into the numbers.
Field is a generalist who takes equal delight in studying interchange
design, considering ways to improve the state's signage standards,
and taking the time to stop and smell the asphalt.</TE>
<TE>   Of them all, though, none is so committed a highwayman as Mike
Ballard. How committed is he? Suffice to say that he grows wistful
while discussing the history of the Santa Clarita segment of Sierra
Highway, which once served as part of the main highway linking Los
Angeles to Lancaster.</TE>
<TE>   The road, which was first posted as State Route 7, then U.S. Route
6 and finally State Route 14, lost its highway designation altogether
after construction of the Antelope Valley Freeway in 1963. Ballard
paid the company that makes Caltrans' road markers $35 to make him a
custom "U.S. 6" shield. He took it out there one afternoon so he
could experience what the route looked like in its heyday.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you go along the old roads, you start seeing old gas
stations and old restaurants that don't get much business anymore,"
he said. "They were once part of the main road and now they've been
delegated to some side road, and that's if you're lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Two-and-a-half years ago, Ballard fulfilled his ambition of
traveling every highway mile in California. He made most of the
journey in his 1965 Ford Ranchero. The leg that took the longest to
complete, Route 271 south of Eureka, is also one of his favorites. "I
ended up walking part of it where it was closed because of a
landslide," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although he spread his journey over a couple of years, he
estimates it took him about three months of actual driving time. It
would have taken longer if he hadn't given himself credit for routes
he'd already traveled.</TE>
<TE>   You'd think he would be sick of pounding the pavement after so
many miles, but if anything, his appreciation has deepened. He is
writing a book about U.S. 99, the former Los Angeles-to-Bakersfield
route that, to Ballard's thinking, is just as significant as its more
famous cousin, Route 66. And he still enjoys hitting the highway. He
has been revisiting the roads he particularly liked on his travels,
this time on a bicycle.</TE>
<TE>   "With an old road, there are only two ways it's best done: in a
Model T, which I've yet to experience, or on a bike, so you are going
slow enough to see everything and enjoy it more," he said.</TE>

<HD>Sihung Lung, 72; Starred in Ang Lee Films</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sihung Lung, the Taiwanese actor who had pivotal roles in director
Ang Lee's well-regarded "Father Knows Best" trilogy of films, has
died. He was 72.</LD>
<LD>   Lung, who also appeared in Lee's Academy Award-winning "Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and acted in more than 100 Chinese-language
films, died of liver failure at a hospital in Taipei on May 2.</LD>
<LD>   Born in a village in mainland China, Lung completed his secondary
school education and joined the Nationalist armies of Chiang Kai-shek
as a teenager. He fled to Taiwan in 1949 in the face of the communist
victory in the civil war.</LD>
<TE>   While in his 20s, he started his acting career in an army theater
group in Taipei. He participated in productions of Chinese and
Western plays, including some Shakespeare.</TE>
<TE>   By the age of 40, Lung was acting in Taiwanese television
productions--basically soap operas--and was often cast as a heavy,
playing tough guys.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned to act in virtually any role during my army days, and I
became very proficient on the stage. From small roles to large roles,
comedy to drama, it was an excellent learning experience, and I knew
that acting was what I wanted to do," he told the publication
Transpacific in an interview years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But he had retired when Lee, who remembered seeing him in
productions when he was a child, asked him to play the part of the
father in "Pushing Hands," the first of Lee's trilogy in which a
parent with grown children confronts a vastly changing world.</TE>
<TE>   In that film, the father figure is a tai chi master who has come
to America to live with his son and daughter-in-law in suburban New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues recalled that Lung, who knew nothing of tai chi before
the filming, would rise each morning at 5 to take part in a tai chi
class, learning enough to persuade audiences that he had a firm grasp
of the discipline.</TE>
<TE>   The title, "Pushing Hands," refers to a tai chi exercise designed
to help keep one's balance while destroying that of one's opponent
and reflects the father figure's struggle against his fate.</TE>
<TE>   "The Wedding Banquet," the second part of Lee's trilogy, is a
farce in which Lung plays a Taiwanese father who wants his New
York-based son to marry, not knowing that he is gay. The son agrees
to a marriage of convenience, but problems develop when his father
and mother decide to fly to New York for the wedding.</TE>
<TE>   In the final film in the trilogy, "Eat Drink Man Woman," Lung
plays a master chef who is also the father of three beautiful
daughters who all live at home and who are all growing tired of the
spectacular meals he throws together every Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Lung's work in the "Father Knows Best" trilogy earned good
critical marks and brought him to the attention of Western audiences.</TE>
<TE>   His role of Sir Te, a wise court official in Beijing who receives
the 400-year-old sword, the Green Dynasty, in Lee's "Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon," gained him more exposure.</TE>
<TE>   For his work in "Pushing Hands," Lung won a Golden Horse award,
Taiwan's only prize for motion pictures, in 1991. It was his second
Golden Horse, after one in 1976 for best supporting actor.</TE>
<TE>   A devout Catholic, Lung first married in his late 40s.</TE>
<TE>   He had been in failing health for some time with diabetes, high
blood pressure and clogged arteries.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Pao Chia, a television producer, and
their daughter.</TE>

<HD>It's Too Early for a Palestine State</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AVI DAVIS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The decision of the Likud Party's Central Committee in Israel on
Sunday to reject the concept of a Palestinian state came as little
surprise. It reflects the prevailing mood of the Israeli right and a
growing acceptance on the left that the Palestinians have forfeited a
right to statehood.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, with the vote the Likud Party is challenging a central
canon of international relations: the automatic right to
self-determination. It has good reason to do so. Many of the same
Arab nations that fought for their freedom after World War II and
claimed the right of self-determination have transformed themselves
into entrenched enemies of progress, brutally repressing their people
and projecting a threat to their neighbors and to the maintenance of
international order. Instead of a comity of nations dedicated to the
advancement of their people, countries such as Libya, Syria, Sudan
and Iraq have devolved into dictatorships, unconcerned with human
rights or individual liberties.</LD>
<TE>   That pattern would doubtlessly repeat itself with the creation of
a Palestinian state. For anyone observing the development of the
Palestinian Authority over the past nine years and the Palestine
Liberation Organization over the past 40 years, the view is grim.
Instead of freedom the people of Palestine could expect only further
repression; instead of peace they would be urged to constant
aggression  against neighboring countries; instead of prosperity they
would see more corruption and nepotism.</TE>
<TE>   In reviewing the failures of the past century, shouldn't we be
reassessing the standard for statehood? Rather than becoming an
automatic right, statehood should be qualified by the following test:
Are the people capable of governing themselves by building solid
institutions that promote freedom, peace and prosperity? Would the
creation of a state engender less danger for neighboring states? How
much better off would the subject population be with a native
government? If the would-be nation cannot meet these basic standards,
statehood is not the answer.</TE>
<TE>   There is a better solution. After World War I, the Paris Peace
Conference recognized that the populations of certain regions were
not ready, by reason of internal discord or an absence of leadership,
for statehood. Thus Palestine (incorporating Trans-Jordan) and
Lebanon became wards of the British Empire and the Third French
Republic, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The mandates these nations were awarded carried specific
instructions to nurture the regions into political maturity. Although
neither Britain nor France always acted responsibly in carrying out
its directives, there were some promising results. General
prosperity, the development of representative institutions and the
institution of secular law set a tone that left a lasting memory.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab population in the West Bank and Gaza could benefit from a
similar mandatory system. Supervised by the United States under a
plan negotiated in advance with Israel and Jordan, Palestinian towns
and villages could be nurtured with representative institutions,
allowing Palestinians a say in their own administration, even if
short of sovereignty. The U.S. mandate would facilitate the
development of an educational system and an economy focused on
peaceful coexistence with neighboring states. Security would be
jointly in the hands of Israel, Jordan and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The imposition of such a mandate, however, requires one vital
preliminary step: The Palestinian terrorist infrastructure must be
crushed and expelled. The Palestinian Authority, as constituted,
represents the greatest threat to peace in the region and the welfare
of the Palestinian people.</TE>
<TE>   Once freed of the Palestinian Authority's control, there
eventually would rise a tier of middle-class merchants and
intellectuals who appreciate the viability of a state founded on the
principles of democracy and a respect for human rights.</TE>
<TE>   No one should pretend that such a concept will obtain immediate
acceptance. But as the Bush administration prepares to dismantle
another self-determined terrorist state in the same region, it is
certainly an appropriate time to consider alternatives.</TE>

<HD>The Melting Pot's Missing Ingredient</HD>
<DH>Immigrants need civic training to integrate well.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LUIS LUGO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few tears will be shed at the funeral for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.</LD>
<LD>   The House of Representatives voted last month to abolish the INS
and replace it with separate bureaus charged with protecting our
borders and providing services to immigrants under a newly created
Agency for Immigration Affairs.</LD>
<LD>   But the INS has a third critical mission that largely has been
ignored: to promote instruction and training in citizenship. This
includes helping impart basic English language skills and
understanding of our history and democratic principles. This
oversight becomes all the more critical in light of the unprecedented
number of immigrants who have flocked to our shores over the past 30
years. According to the 2000 census, the foreign-born population
stands at 28.4 million, or 10% of the total U.S. population. That's
the highest number ever and the highest proportion since 1930, the
end of the previous great wave of immigration.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, also during the past 30 years, the proportion of
naturalized citizens in the foreign-born population plummeted from
nearly two-thirds to barely more than one-third. The result is that
today nearly 18 million of the foreign-born are not citizens. The
backlog of citizenship applications to the INS now numbers in the
millions, despite the commendable efforts of charitable
organizations, many of them religiously affiliated, to assist with
the naturalization process.</TE>
<TE>   There are several reasons for this lower rate of naturalization,
but one of the most obvious and most easily addressed is government
inattention to the essential task of integrating immigrants into our
common civic life. This is not simply a matter of providing
client-friendly services, essential though that is, but of preparing
immigrants to become fellow citizens.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform in 1997 gave Congress
its final report, titled "Becoming an American." The report strongly
encouraged the revival of instruction for all immigrants on "the
common civic culture that is essential to citizenship," including the
English language, which the commission correctly identified as the
most basic skill for successful integration into American society and
civic life.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the bill the House passed last month was amended to
include establishment of an Office of Citizenship, the basic mission
of which would be to promote instruction and training. We would be
well served if the Senate, when it takes up an INS reform bill this
month, includes such a provision. Better yet, the Senate should
consider elevating this office into a third bureau within the new
Agency for Immigration Affairs. This could serve to underscore the
seriousness with which we view this matter of becoming a U.S. citizen
and to help ensure that it receives adequate funding to carry out its
core educational mission.</TE>
<TE>   As a nation of immigrants, we need to take seriously our
responsibility of training future citizens to fully assume the rights
and duties that belong to all Americans.</TE>

<HD>The People's Voice in Myanmar Must Not Be Muffled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAVITA MENON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the military government in Myanmar announced the release from
house arrest of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, an official
statement made a tantalizing promise: "We shall recommit ourselves to
allowing all of our citizens to participate freely in the life of our
political process."</LD>
<LD>   What could the generals in charge possibly mean? The last time the
junta allowed citizens to participate in the country's political life
was in 1990, and the government ignored the election results when it
became clear that the regime had lost, badly.</LD>
<LD>   Suu Kyi's release came after months of secret talks between the
opposition leader and the ruling generals. It's time to let the
public in on the discussion. If the government is serious now about
permitting the public a voice in the country's affairs, then the
first step toward political reform must be to lift state censorship
of the media.</LD>
<TE>   Myanmar, which was known as Burma before the junta renamed it, is
a country in crisis. The economy is a shambles. One-third of all
children under 5 are malnourished, according to the United Nations,
and more than half a million citizens are HIV-positive. The country
is one of the world's leading exporters of opium. Its jails hold more
than 1,000 political prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Yet information about these issues is hard to come by because real
journalism is nearly impossible. Local journalists are forbidden by
state censors to publish almost anything of substance and are subject
to imprisonment for simply expressing a dissenting view. "The
censorship board has told us we must not write about AIDS,
corruption, education or the situation of students," an editor said
last year. "We also cannot write about any bad news, and we must be
careful about everything political. That does not leave very much for
us to publish."</TE>
<TE>   Witness Suu Kyi's release, which grabbed headlines around the
world--but not in Myanmar, where state-controlled newspapers and TV
neglected to mention it.</TE>
<TE>   Censorship used to be obvious, with the Press Scrutiny Board
either inking over or ripping out offending sections from magazines
and books. In the past few years, however, the censors have become
subtler, forcing editors themselves to make the required cuts and
adjust layouts to hide the damage. Because these last-minute changes
can be costly, self-censorship is widespread. And even when
journalists do tackle sensitive topics, they often write in an
elliptical style that is designed to confuse the censors but can be
equally puzzling to ordinary readers.</TE>
<TE>   Restrictions on foreign correspondents also have helped ensure
that Myanmar's problems do not receive the international attention
they deserve.</TE>
<TE>   The regime announced that "national unity, peace and stability"
must accompany any moves toward democratization. But these worthy
goals will never be born of repression. To get there, the junta must
consult the people and this time listen to what they have to say. A
national conversation, carried through free media, would be a
beginning.</TE>

<HD>Lights Out on Bush's Excuses</HD>
<DH>He left California hanging in the energy crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that the Enron culprits have been caught red-handed, might not
the media inquire of the president whether he takes any
responsibility for nearly bankrupting California by refusing to come
to the state's aid in a timely fashion?</LD>
<LD>   Forgotten in all the excitement of the damning revelations of
internal Enron memos describing the energy company's dastardly
techniques for market manipulation is the apparent stupidity, if not
complicity, of the Bush administration that made Enron's chicanery
possible.</LD>
<LD>   Too rough, am I? Just go back a year, when rolling blackouts were
helping to wreck California's massive economy while the Bush-Cheney
team stood insufferably aloof, blaming the victim. Exonerating Enron
and other energy traders, President Bush refused to impose wholesale
federal price caps to end the gouging.</LD>
<TE>   Couldn't do that, the Bush administration said, because that would
intrude on the supremely rational free market. But now we know that
the Invisible Hand was actually the grasping tentacle of Enron, and
probably other Texas-based energy hustlers, whose antics must have
poor Adam Smith spinning in his grave.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Dick Cheney said the Bush administration viewed
wholesale price caps as "a mistake" because "there isn't anything
that can be done short-term to produce more kilowatts this summer."
Yet, at the same time, Enron was grabbing electricity from California
and selling it in Oregon at an obscene profit. Federal price controls
would have prevented Enron from playing one state against another. If
Cheney didn't know that, he must not have learned anything from his
own enormously lucrative days in the Texas energy racket.</TE>
<TE>   And could Bush himself not have guessed that his Texas buddies
were gaming the market? After all, his vaunted business experience
was also in Texas--and in the energy industry. But let's assume he
saw no evil when he was on the inside of the energy biz; wouldn't it
have behooved him to have done some due diligence research on his top
campaign donor? Could it be that he wasn't too eager to find out that
his political career was hugely indebted to money siphoned from
Enron's apparently ill-gotten gains?</TE>
<TE>   Surely Army Secretary Thomas E. White could have tipped off his
commander in chief to what was brewing, since he had been recruited
by the administration from his position as head of Enron Energy
Services--a subsidiary of the collapsed energy giant--which was
deeply involved in ripping off California consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe Poppy Bush could have warned his son, since as president
he had signed into law the 1992 Energy Policy Act, which opened the
way for electricity to become a tradable commodity, and an appointee
of his, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairwoman Wendy L.
Gramm, had sealed the deal by exempting electricity trading from the
regulatory oversight afforded other commodities. (Gramm, wife of a
Texas senator, herself moved on quickly to join Enron's board of
directors, even serving as a member of the board's ill-fated audit
committee.)</TE>
<TE>   In any case, during its first year, the younger Bush's
administration catered to every whim of Enron chief and Bush family
sponsor Kenneth Lay. After six meetings with Lay and other Enron
executives, Cheney came up with an energy plan that did nothing for
California but used the state's woes as justification for nuclear
power and further deregulation, accompanied by the planned rape of
pristine wilderness areas.</TE>
<TE>   Out West, California officials were spending billions of taxpayer
dollars to secure power to keep vital services functioning, while
inside Enron a memo admitted that the company "may have contributed"
to a Stage 2 power emergency, pushing the state to the brink of
widespread blackout. If some wacko damages a transformer in a
hospital to cause a power outage, it's jail time. But these Enron
characters deliberately denied Californians energy needed to sustain
life while Bush blithely covered for them.</TE>
<TE>   Another memo detailed the company's so-called Death Star strategy:
jamming transmission lines in order to collect payments for fixing
problems they created.</TE>
<TE>   When the mob does things like this, we call it blackmail and
extortion. Now that a glossy corporate giant cozy with the president
has done such things, what does the Justice Department propose we
call them?</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, California Gov. Gray Davis told Bush: "We are
literally in a war with energy companies that are price-gouging us;
many of those companies are in Texas. You didn't create this problem,
but you are the only one who can solve it. And with all due respect,
Californians want to know whether you're going to be on their side."</TE>
<TE>   The president wasn't.</TE>

<HD>Audit Reform Starts Here</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Accounting scandals are a national problem, and Washington should be
leading reform efforts. But, if Washington won't do it? California,
to its credit, is considering effective and focused accounting reform
bills in both the state Senate and the Assembly.</LD>
<LD>   Paralysis in Washington has been driven by intense lobbying by the
Big Five accounting firms--or the Remaining Four, as pundits are
calling them in the wake of Andersen's implosion. The nonpartisan
Center for Responsive Politics reports that the industry in 2000
spent $14.7 million on campaign contributions and $12.3 million on
lobbying.</LD>
<LD>   A reform bill in the House would force publicly traded companies
to disclose certain financial transactions that can now be concealed.
It would not, however, directly cure abuses.</LD>
<TE>   The Democratic-led U.S. Senate hasn't developed a better solution
and seems content to use the flawed Republican proposal in the House
as an election-year weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt has failed
to propose effective reforms and is seen by his critics as far too
cozy with the industry he regulates.</TE>
<TE>   That leaves a void that the states, at least for now, must fill.
The California Board of Accountancy, the state's licensing body, has
identified several "critical issues." Legislation moving out of
Senate and Assembly committees reflects the board's recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   The issues include:</TE>
<TE>   * Prohibiting auditors from shredding pertinent documents
generated during audits. Firms now are free to toss documents that
investigators would need during subsequent disciplinary actions. AB
2873, sponsored by Dario Frommer (D-Los Feliz) and Lou Correa
(D-Anaheim), would require that important paperwork be kept for seven
years.</TE>
<TE>   * Slowing the revolving door that is feeding a stream of
accountants into high-paying jobs with recent clients. AB 2970, by
Assemblyman Howard Wayne (D-San Diego), would create a two-year
waiting period before auditors could accept employment with
customers.</TE>
<TE>   The Accountancy Board stopped short of recommending that audit
firms be prohibited from handling lucrative consulting work. The
board did, however, underline the need to protect auditor
independence by restricting nonaudit services. AB 1995, also by
Correa, would limit the consulting that audit firms could handle for
customers, and SB 1527, by John Burton (D-San Francisco), would
define allowable consulting services.</TE>
<TE>   The state legislation would technically affect only accountants
licensed by California. But this would cover so many auditors that it
could not be ignored by the rest of the nation, especially if other
large states followed suit.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Every spring, Forest Service officials yell "Fire!" in crowded
legislative hearing rooms in an attempt to get more funding. This
time, their talk of an ominous, early fire season in Southern
California and across the West is all too true. Exhibit No. 1: the
wildfires that swept areas from Santa Clarita to Camp Pendleton over
the last few days.</LD>
<LD>   Cold temperatures in the tropical Pacific over the winter produced
weather patterns that caused dry conditions in the West, and
forecasts call for warmer-than-usual temperatures this summer.
Droughts have hindered the controlled burns used to get rid of small
trees and brush while sparing large trees. A century of fire control,
aimed at quickly suppressing fires at all costs, has allowed this
underbrush to accumulate, becoming kindling that turns small brush
fires into devastating conflagrations.</LD>
<LD>   Most problems, including this one, come down to more than just
throwing money at them. But the $39 million that the Bush
administration seeks to cut from the federal government's fire
prevention budget should be restored this year.</LD>
<TE>   The funding is part of a supplemental budget, called the National
Fire Plan, that Congress gave the Forest Service and Interior
Department in 2000 after a savage fire season. It is aimed at helping
those agencies pay for controlled burns and other fire reduction
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, restoring $39 million to the approximately $2 billion
that Congress has allocated for the National Fire Plan is only part
of a solution. Congress also needs to examine its own behavior. It
tends to shower the Forest Service with funding after devastating
summer fires and stiff the agency in other times. Lawmakers
philosophize that fires should be allowed to burn because they are
part of a balanced ecosystem, but they rail against the practice when
a fire threatens the Wyoming ranches or California beach houses of
wealthy constituents.</TE>
<TE>   The argument between let-it-burn and fight-every-fire has raged
for nearly a century. In 1908, William Mulholland, architect of the
Los Angeles water system, refused to send men to battle fires burning
in Southern California mountains. Big fires, Mulholland insisted,
were beyond "the power of man to stop." Mulholland's notion that
fires are ecologically healthy has become conventional wisdom, but it
was considered blasphemous through most of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   Decades of fire mismanagement can't be corrected in a day, but the
fire planning fund, if it is kept healthy, can establish a lasting
middle ground for forest fire management.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has rejected one international agreement
after another, from a curb on global warming to the creation of an
international criminal court that would investigate war crimes. So
the president's announcement that he wants to "liquidate the legacy
of the Cold War" by signing a treaty May 24 with Russian President
Vladimir V. Putin to slash bloated nuclear arsenals comes as a
refreshing change.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed treaty would make the world a bit safer, not just by
taking some nukes out of commission--the United States and Russia
have more than 90% of the world's nuclear weapons--but by tightening
the relationship between two former enemies.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement contains massive cuts in long-range warheads, from
the 6,000 permitted under the 1991 START treaty to between 1,700 and
2,200. Russia can't afford to maintain a big Cold War-style missile
force, and the Bush administration's insistence on putting warheads
in storage rather than destroying them, as the Russians wanted, held
up a deal.</LD>
<TE>   A compromise on how many warheads are to be dismantled was
apparently reached, though the percentages have not been revealed
yet. Bush did agree to a formal treaty, rather than the informal
agreement he had been pushing for.</TE>
<TE>   In the works since fall, the agreement is supposed to form the
centerpiece of Bush's visit to Russia late next week. The Senate will
doubtless ratify the treaty but will have a chance to call for
greater cuts--which should alarm no one, since the U.S. could easily
go below 1,000 warheads and retain an overwhelming deterrent force.</TE>
<TE>   However Bush and Putin resolve their now relatively small
differences, the forthcoming treaty is evidence of a new relationship
based on trust and common national interests. Already a NATO-Russia
council is being created that will give Moscow a greater role in
counter-terrorism and military actions. The result could be anything
from a joint training center to an anti-terrorism center.</TE>
<TE>   The sooner Russia is included in NATO decisions, the more willing
it will be to work with the U.S. and its allies. In improving ties,
Bush is following in the footsteps of President Clinton, who was
ferociously attacked by the Republican right on the ground that he
was appeasing Russia. But the United States and Russia have far more
to gain by cooperating than returning to Cold War-era confrontation.
The benefits of working with Russia show that an American go-it-alone
foreign policy is dangerously counterproductive.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Ashcroft's Gunslinger Style," editorial, May 10: What an
outrage! Our U.S. Department of Justice actually has the gall to
argue that the constitutional "right of the people to keep and bear
arms" means that the people have a constitutional right to keep and
bear arms! What will these wild-eyed gunslingers think of next? Maybe
they'll completely flip out and decide that "the people" also have a
1st Amendment right to peaceably assemble and to petition the
government for redress, a 4th Amendment right to be free from
unreasonable search and seizure and 9th and 10th Amendment rights to
retain any other rights and powers not enumerated in the
Constitution. Heaven forbid.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff Bishop</LD>
<LD>   Culver City</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One might reasonably paraphrase the 2nd Amendment as saying:
Because a well-regulated militia is necessary to the security of a
free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not
be infringed. One might also read it as: A well-regulated militia is
necessary to the security of a free state. Therefore, the right of
the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.</TE>
<TE>   However, one cannot plausibly read it to say that the states, or
the National Guard, have the right to keep and bear arms but the
people do not. That would be rewriting the Constitution. Nor can one
read it to say: The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall
not be infringed, until such time as the government decides that a
well-regulated militia is no longer necessary to the security of a
free state. That too would be rewriting the Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has taken an oath to preserve, protect
and defend the Constitution. That is precisely what he is doing. If
you don't like what the Constitution says, amend it.</TE>
<TE>   Robert A. Philipson</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Ashcroft and the Justice Department believe that the 2nd
Amendment to the Constitution really means the government can't
restrict an individual's right to bear arms, then why can't I own a
nuclear weapon?</TE>

<HD>Going From Bad Grammar to Worse</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After having read the opinions on the use of the word "like," I'd
like to mention another annoying issue concerning grammar
(Commentary, May 5, and letters, May 9). Since when have the words
"me" and "him" become subjects of a sentence, such as, "Me and him
saw the whole thing"? At one time scriptwriters used this ploy to
indicate that a character was uneducated or crude, but now you hear
our smartest teenagers saying, "Me and him applied to Yale." You hear
it in commercials, TV programs, movies and news interviews.</LD>
<LD>   Adding insult to injury, this flagrant misuse of grammar is also a
violation of good manners. The rule used to be that when you referred
to yourself with someone else in the subject or the predicate, you
always put yourself last as a courtesy.</LD>
<LD>   Isn't it about time that teachers and parents insist that these
children sound like the bright beings and overachievers that their
proud parents think they are?</LD>

<LD>In "San Diego Losing Its Football Team Spirit" (May 11), you cover
the San Diego Chargers' desire to move to greener pastures in L.A.
Let's see: a billionaire like Philip Anschutz angling a strapped L.A.
County and reeling in L.A. citizens to buy him a new stadium. A team
that managed to squeeze San Diego into buying unsold tickets (to the
tune of $25 million) complaining it's not making enough money. And,
spurning a $78-million civic investment in its own stadium, a team
management that is ready to run. These people want to suck even more
money from us. In an environment in which L.A. can't even afford to
fund its own hospitals?</LD>
<LD>   What a bunch of whiners. If Anschutz and the Chargers want a
stadium so badly, let them pay for it themselves. What do they have
against the free-enterprise system?</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The column by Steve Lopez ("Watch Out for Sneak Play in Massive
Redevelopment Plan," May 10) covers all the salient points. If
Anschutz wants to build a football stadium, let him use his own
billions of dollars and not taxpayer money.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley is again getting shafted by this tax giveaway. Is it
any wonder that it wants to secede? Mayor James Hahn is courting
Valley voters, and all the while he has his hand in their hip
pockets. Lopez's column should be required reading for the City
Council and Hahn.</TE>

<LD>Re "Party Rebuffs Sharon Over Palestinians," May 13: I thought Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon showed the worst extent of Israeli extremism,
but after the vote by the Likud Party denying the Palestinians a
state of their own, I see that the Israeli right is actually much
worse. When will we wake up to the fact that the Israelis are not
looking to destroy terrorists but are seeking to keep the
Palestinians in virtual bondage by annexing their land and denying
them rights?</LD>

<TE>   What an incredible photo essay on the Church of the Nativity by
Carolyn Cole (May 11). My husband and I always wanted to visit
Bethlehem and never got the chance, but now we feel that at least we
have seen a part of this great church. The photograph of the corner
of the sanctuary is especially poignant, with the Palestinians asleep
and the sun shining through the window; it belies the fact that
outside there is still so much violence.</TE>
<TE>   A true test of a good journalist is one who truly lives the story.
Thank you for transporting us to the birthplace of Christ, if only
for a minute.</TE>

<TE>   Cole's golden photos have placed terrorists in the hallowed light

<TE>   Over 200 Palestinian men--many heavily armed--smoked, ate, slept,
strewed trash and, apparently, urinated in almost every room of
Christianity's most holy church. These men put the existence of this
sacred place in jeopardy. Even worse, they jeopardized the lives of
holy men from three different Christian branches.</TE>
<TE>   These men were not seeking sanctuary; the 13 accused of committing
heinous crimes were evading capture, and the remaining men, either
willingly or not, were acting as human shields. Cole reports spotting
50 cell phones and states that many of these men left to get supplies
and then came back. These men were a cell-phone call away from safely
leaving. Shame on those who have allowed suicide murders and willful
desecration of holy sites to become legitimate forms of protest.</TE>

<LD>Re "In Artist's Freeway Prank, Form Followed Function," May 9:</LD>
<LD>   Kudos to Richard Ankrom for doing and saying something that had to
be said. Even as a lifelong resident of Los Angeles, I've often been
confused by misleading and inadequate signs all over the place, from
freeways that assume everyone (including foreign visitors) knows that
"Sacramento" means north, to terrible passenger signs at LAX. The
sign makers who live here obviously assume everyone is as familiar
with these places as they are, so I suggest they hire a consultant
from outside the area to help them understand how much information is
really needed to help people find their way.</LD>

<TE>   Marina del Rey</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, sure--the form is fine but the function fails.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of miles north of the artist's "prank," and once through
the tunnels, motorists are still having difficulty getting into the
left lane in time for the hard-left transition from the Harbor
Freeway to the Golden State Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   And all this time I thought it was just lousy, thoughtless L.A.
drivers waiting until the last possible moment to merge, thereby
causing that consistent clog on one's way up the historic Arroyo Seco
Parkway.</TE>

<TE>   Maybe the clandestine art project eluded official notice for

<LD>Illegal immigration is as American as apple pie. Those who wish to
put an end to it obviously do not understand it. Illegals do not
leave their families and risk their lives to sneak into the United
States because they want to improve the U.S. economy. They are here
because we need them and we want them.</LD>
<LD>   While they may cost us money, in the long term their presence is
beneficial. Most are very hard-working people who develop a feeling
of patriotism for their new home. Often they start families and, if
given the chance, become outstanding citizens. Their children
contribute to the vibrancy and diversity of our nation.</LD>
<LD>   Legal immigration could never supply us with sufficient low-cost
labor nor could it generate the wonderful new immigrant communities
that are the pride of Los Angeles. Besides, despite what
anti-immigration people may think, God did not give this land only to
those who were born here. God is a lot more generous than that.</LD>

<LD>Re "Laura Bush Ready to Try Her Wings as a U.S. Envoy," May 10: So,
Laura Bush and Jenna Bush are going to do a little mother-daughter
bonding on a trip to Europe. Coincidentally, my daughter and I are
planning to do the same. While in Paris, Laura is looking forward to
setting some time aside for "sightseeing, shopping, eating."</LD>
<LD>   Unlike the Bushes, my daughter and I will not be going to Paris.
We will not support a country whose people have, over recent months,
attacked, looted and torched Jewish synagogues, cemeteries and
schools--a place where Jews are being terrorized on a daily basis and
whose ambassador to Britain was quoted as referring to Israel with a
scatological term. I'm not sure where my daughter and I will wind up,
but I hope Laura and Jenna are not too blinded by the Louvre and the
brioche to miss the rampant anti-Semitism that will surely surround
them.</LD>

<HD>Bill Peet, 87; Disney Artist, Storyteller Wrote '101
Dalmations,' Children's Books</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Peet, a legendary Disney artist and writer who drew such
indelible characters as Dumbo, wrote the screenplay for "101
Dalmatians" and went on to create 35 children's books with
curiosity-tweaking titles ranging from "Capyboppy" to
"Whingdingdilly," has died. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Peet died Saturday at his home in Studio City, said Howard Green,
vice president of communications for Disney Studios.</LD>
<LD>   Peet recently had pneumonia, and suffered for many years from
cancer and heart problems, beginning with a heart attack in 1977. He
lost one vocal cord and part of his larynx to cancer in 1985.</LD>
<TE>   The multitalented Peet was a revered storyteller, forever admired
by fellow artists and children alike.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Peet was Walt Disney's greatest story man and considered to
be on a par with Walt himself in terms of telling strong stories with
vibrant characters," said animation historian John Canemaker, author
of the recently published "Walt Disney's Nine Old Men" and animation
director for the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University.</TE>
<TE>   "[He] profoundly influenced some of the studio's greatest features
and created some of its most memorable characters."</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues from the early Disney decades, in which shorts and
feature films began as scenarios, then were developed by artists into
a series of storyboards and handed to animators, agreed that Peet as
a story man was second only to Disney.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Peet did the most stimulating story sketches, especially on
'Song of the South,' when they take the Rabbit out to find his
Laughing Place.... It was just a magnificent piece of story work for
animation," Frank Thomas, one of the fabled "Nine Old Men," said
Monday after learning of Peet's death.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody could touch Bill Peet," said another of the nine, Ollie
Johnston. "His drawings were staged beautifully. They suggested
attitudes and acting--just a great springboard for the animators."</TE>
<TE>   Peet the "story man" was Disney's logical choice to write the
studio's first screenplay, "101 Dalmatians" in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   The artist not only became the screenwriter, but also drew
characters and directed actors' voice performances, and then repeated
the same multi-tasking effort for "The Sword in the Stone" two years
later.</TE>
<TE>   The features remained among Peet's favorite creations, along with
his drawings for "Dumbo," the 1941 film that first gained the artist
personal attention from Disney.</TE>
<TE>   But the two animated feature films were to be the finale of the
27-year love-hate association between Disney and the individualist
Peet.</TE>
<TE>   Theirs had always been a prickly relationship, and Peet conceded
in his "Bill Peet: An Autobiography," published in 1989, that he drew
the evil Captain Hook in "Peter Pan" to resemble Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Peet left the studio and its creator in 1964 during the creation
of "Jungle Book," and asked that his name be stripped from the
credits because he didn't like changes that were made after he left
the project, a problem he always attributed to group creation.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't have a collective idea about what is funny," he told
The Times in 1990. "Creative work is a very personal thing. You have
to have a single point of view."</TE>
<TE>   Working on a Disney film, he said, was an "assembly line" process
with all the credit floating to the top.</TE>
<TE>   "Walt was very sensitive about credit. He would say, 'Dammit, we
are all in this together,'" Peet said.</TE>
<TE>   "But what he meant was 'the credit is all mine.' I knew the we
stood for Walter Elias [Disney's first and middle names]. Everything
came out 'Walt Disney presents' and the rest of our names might as
well have been in the phone book."</TE>
<TE>   Among the Disney classics featuring Peet's talents are "Fantasia,"
released in 1940, "Song of the South" in 1946, "Cinderella" in 1950,
"Alice in Wonderland" in 1951, and "Sleeping Beauty" in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   Four decades after Peet's exit from filmmaking, copies of his
drawings still adorn the offices of artists at Disney and other
animation studios as models of how to tell a story visually.</TE>
<TE>   The man who so longed for personal control and credit turned to
books as the proper outlet for his storytelling abilities.</TE>
<TE>   He had already published a handful of children's books--"Goliath
II" in 1959, an outgrowth of the story he did for the Disney feature
of the same title released in 1960, and such rhyming tales as
"Hubert's Hair-Raising Adventure," "Huge Harold," "Smokey" and "The
Pinkish, Purplish, Bluish Egg."</TE>
<TE>   So on his birthday on Jan. 29, 1964, Peet declared himself a
full-time children's author, never to return to an animation studio.</TE>
<TE>   Soon came "Randy's Dandy Lions" and "Ella," both in 1964, and
"Chester the Worldly Pig" in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   "Chester," Peet always said, was his favorite book character
because they shared the same background--born in the Midwest and
determined to see the larger world.</TE>
<TE>   Chester came from the artist's pen and mind. William Bartlett Peet
(originally Peed but later changed) was born in Grandview, Ind., a
dot on the map on the Ohio River, and moved to Indianapolis when he
was 3.</TE>
<TE>   A year or so later, he started drawing the trains that chugged
through the city and the animals that traveled with circuses.</TE>
<TE>   Peet won a scholarship to the John Herron Art Institute, now a
part of Indiana University, where he said his life "really began."</TE>
<TE>   He left Herron after three years and worked briefly as an artist
for a greeting card company in Dayton, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Depressed when he was assigned to illustrate sympathy cards,
however, he joined legions of other young men in the Depression who
responded to the advertisement "Walt Disney is looking for artists."</TE>
<TE>   Peet began as an "in-betweener," helping to draw Disney's Donald
Duck cartoons, until he got so fed up he stormed out screaming, "No
more ducks!"</TE>
<TE>   Expecting to join an unemployment line, Peet instead was assigned
to work on "Pinocchio," beginning his ascension in the Disney
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing came as easily as breathing to Peet. Writing was hard
work, but he quickly learned at Disney that the "story men" had more
control, so he wrote and created the memorable storyboards.</TE>
<TE>   When he left Disney to concentrate on books, Peet found that ideas
came even harder than writing.</TE>
<TE>   But as a father, he had told bedtime stories and suffered through
a long succession of family pets.</TE>
<TE>   He also wanted to make reading fun for children and teach them
useful things like how to get along with others.</TE>
<TE>   Starting with those ingredients, Peet cooked up a few ideas and
began, as he described it, to "write and draw at the same time ...
kind of a hodgepodge."</TE>
<TE>   Remembering, for example, the exotic South American capybara his
son Bill once ordered from an animal importer, Peet created the 1966
book "Capyboppy." In the book, as in real life, the tailless rodent
grew so big and got so spoiled that it had to be given to the zoo.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1975 book "Cyrus the Unsinkable Sea Serpent," Peet taught
that kindness is heroic by drawing Cyrus as a serpent out to sink a
ship and eat the passengers so he wouldn't seem like a "sissy," only
to wind up defending the ship against pirates.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his career, Peet loved meeting with children--and
drawing animals for them.</TE>
<TE>   He would start to draw some recognizable animal, he explained in
his autobiography, only to switch to several others as fast as his
little fans could shout out identifications.</TE>
<TE>   Such a combination of camel, dog, elephant, giraffe, reindeer,
rhino and zebra turned into the creature and 1970 book
"Whingdingdilly."</TE>
<TE>   Even after cancer surgery in 1985 forced him to abandon classroom
visits, Peet continued to personally answer his fan mail, often
sketching animals in the margins of his notes to his little fans.</TE>
<TE>   "My favorite compliment from the kids is, 'We think your books are
funny and make us laugh,'" Peet told The Times in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are trying to get kids to read, a book should be
entertaining. If it isn't fun, it becomes a chore."</TE>
<TE>   For more than 25 years, Peet churned out books that his little
readers grew up to read to their own children--"Farewell to Shady
Glade," "Buford the Little Bighorn," "How Droofus the Dragon Lost His
Head," "The Ant and the Elephant," "Merle the High Flying Squirrel,"
"The Gnats of Knotty Pine," "Cowardly Clyde," "Encore for Eleanor,"
"Pamela Camel," "Jethro and Joel Were a Troll" and "Zella, Zack and
Zodiac."</TE>
<TE>   "Cock-a-Doodle Dudley," published in 1990, was his final book.</TE>
<TE>   To add to his Annie Award for contributions to animation, Peet
received more than a dozen book awards for children's literature,
including the California Reading Assn.'s Significant Author Award in
1983.</TE>
<TE>   His autobiography was a Caldecott honor book in 1989 and earned
the Southern California Children's Book Writer's Medal.</TE>
<TE>   Peet is survived by his wife of 64 years, Margaret; a son, William
B. Jr.; and three grandchildren. Another son, Stephen, died in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services will be private.</TE>
<TE>   A public memorial service is scheduled at 3 p.m. Saturday at the
Church of the Hills, Forest Lawn Memorial Park, 6300 Forest Lawn
Drive, Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that memorial donations be made to the
Wilderness Society, 1615 M St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20036.</TE>

<HD>Major Adelphia Shareholder to Seek Three Seats on Board</HD>
<DH>Cable: Leonard Tow, whose family owns a 12% stake, has seen
the value of the stock tumble by nearly 70%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEREK CANEY</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp.'s largest shareholder outside its
founding family said Monday he will seek representation on the board,
six weeks after the company incurred the wrath of Wall Street with
the disclosure of $2.3 billion in off-balance-sheet loans.</LD>
<LD>   Leonard Tow, who, along with his family trusts, owns 12% of
Adelphia's Class A shares, said he will exercise his right to appoint
himself and two other directors to the debt-laden company's board.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia executives were not immediately available for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Adelphia's stock lost 8 cents to close at $6.06 in Nasdaq trading.
Since the deals were disclosed, the shares have lost nearly 70% of
their value.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have become wary of off-balance-sheet items since the
spectacular collapse of energy trading company Enron Corp., whose
off-balance-sheet deals are believed to have been used to hide debt
and enhance earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Tow, chief executive of telecommunications firm Citizens
Communications, said in a statement that he has the right to appoint
the directors as part of Adelphia's 1999 agreement to buy Tow's
Century Communications Corp., which operates cable systems in the Los
Angeles area. Adelphia bought the company for $3.6 billion in cash
and stock.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia, the No. 6 U.S. cable company, is the target of a
Securities and Exchange Commission probe after the company disclosed
it guaranteed $2.3 billion in loans to partnerships controlled by its
founders, the Rigas family.</TE>
<TE>   The family has said it used some of the money from the loans to
buy an undisclosed amount of Adelphia shares. Such information is
expected to be disclosed in its delayed annual report filing.</TE>
<TE>   "Tow's move does very little for Adelphia's fundamentals," said
Joseph Galzerano, debt analyst with CIBC World Markets. "We're still
looking for what the company has to say in its annual report. Until
then, the slow trickle of news is unlikely to be positive for the
company."</TE>
<TE>   In April, Gordon Crawford, portfolio manager at Capital Research &amp;
Management and one of the most influential media investors, began
rounding up disgruntled shareholders to support Tow's appointment to
run Adelphia's day-to-day operations, replacing the Rigas family. The
effort was largely symbolic, however, as the Rigas family has voting
control of the company.</TE>
<TE>   "To protect my family's substantial investment in Adelphia, as
well as the interests of other minority shareholders, I have
determined that I must now enforce my family's right to be
represented on Adelphia's board of directors," Tow wrote in a letter
to Adelphia's board that was released to the media.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to himself, Tow is seeking the appointment of Rudy
Graf, president of Citizens Communications, and Scott Scheider to
Adelphia's board.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia said last week that it would sell a number of cable
systems representing nearly half of its subscriber base in an effort
to pare down its debt, which totaled $14.7 billion, according to its
preliminary balance sheet issued in March.</TE>

<HD>Amgen, FDA Warn of Counterfeit Drug</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THERESA AGOVINO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amgen Inc. and the Food and Drug Administration warned that
counterfeit vials of Epogen, an anemia drug given to dialysis
patients, have been discovered.</LD>
<LD>   Letters have been sent to doctors, pharmacists and drug
wholesalers to alert them to the problem, which was announced on the
Web sites of the FDA and Amgen, the maker of Epogen, on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The letters say the counterfeit vials contain Epogen's active
ingredient, but the concentration is about 20 times lower than it
should be. The counterfeit drugs were found in one batch of 10-pack
boxes containing 40,000 units of the medicine.</LD>
<TE>   Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, wouldn't say how many patients may
have received the counterfeit product or offer any further details
about the problem.</TE>
<TE>   About 150,000 patients take Epogen, Amgen's best-selling drug,
which racked up almost $2.2billion in sales last year.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second time in a year that counterfeit doses of an
Amgen medicine have been discovered. In June, phony vials of
Neupogen, a drug given to chemotherapy patients to help fight
infections, were discovered.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see this as someone targeting Amgen," company spokesman
Jeff Richardson said Monday. "Incidents of counterfeiting just crop
up once in a while."</TE>
<TE>   Both incidents are the subject of a criminal investigation,
Richardson said.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen's drugs make attractive targets for counterfeiters because
they are expensive.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-pack box of Epogen would retail for about $4,000, said
Dennis Harp, a biotech analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. "If
counterfeiters are going to take a risk, they are going to target
high-value products," Harp said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the beginning of the month, two other drug companies have
reported product problems that could have harmed patients. Eli Lilly
&amp; Co. warned that a few bottles of its psychiatric drug Zyprexa
contained white tablets marked aspirin. Last week, GlaxoSmithKline
said four bottles of AIDS drug Combovir actually contained another
AIDS drug called Ziagen. Both companies are investigating the
problem.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WellPoint Health Networks Inc., one of California's biggest health
insurers, said the U.S. government has subpoenaed documents about its
relationship with TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The subpoena, which seeks information related to TAP's drugs
Lupron and Prevacid, was received April 22 from the U.S. attorney's
office in Boston, WellPoint said in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. WellPoint said the subpoena involves a unit that
manages pharmacy benefits and said the company isn't a target of the
investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Pharmacy benefit managers Caremark Rx Inc. and Express Scripts
Inc. also said this month that they have received subpoenas from the
same U.S. attorney's office concerning their relationships with TAP,
a venture of Japan's Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd. and Abbott
Laboratories. Those subpoenas also concerned the cancer drug Lupron
and the ulcer drug Prevacid.</LD>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks-based WellPoint said it is complying with the law
and will cooperate with any investigation. Its shares closed off 90
cents at $71.97 on the Big Board.</TE>

<HD>Salmonella Linked to Cantaloupe</HD>
<DH>Food: Importer recalls Susie brand after 36 cases are
reported in U.S. and Canada. Tainted melons are again from Mexico.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About three dozen people in the U.S. and Canada have been sickened in
recent weeks by Mexican cantaloupe contaminated with a rare form of
salmonella bacteria--the third such outbreak in three years.</LD>
<LD>   Importer I. Kunik Co. of McAllen, Texas, said Monday that it was
voluntarily recalling all cantaloupe sold under the Susie brand,
which was responsible for the Salmonella poona outbreak.</LD>
<LD>   Eight of the 36 illnesses have been reported in California, and
more cases in the state are being investigated, said Ben Sun, an
epidemiologist with the California Department of Health Services.</LD>
<TE>   The cantaloupe came from farms near Guerrero, Mexico, Kunik said.
That is about 40 miles from the origin of cantaloupe responsible for
last year's outbreak.</TE>
<TE>   About 25,000 boxes of the fruit are being taken off shelves in
eight states and Canada. Kunik executives say all of the Susie brand
cantaloupe in California has been consumed or disposed of.</TE>
<TE>   No fatalities have been reported, according to the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The last illness associated with the outbreak was reported April
25, but because of the lag time in collecting and analyzing samples,
government officials say there could be additional cases confirmed in
the weeks ahead.</TE>
<TE>   FDA officials say they are still working to determine how
widespread the problem is.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still trying to sort all of that out," said an FDA official
who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Salmonella poona causes the same symptoms as other types of
salmonella, including fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea, usually
one to three days after tainted food is ingested.</TE>
<TE>   It is not generally life-threatening, but it can pose greater
danger to the elderly, young children and those with weakened immune
systems.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, more than 30 illnesses and two fatalities were reported
from Salmonella poona-contaminated cantaloupe. The year before, this
type of tainted cantaloupe sickened 39 people in five states.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the pattern points to weaknesses in the government's
inspection system.</TE>
<TE>   Fruit from farms in problem regions can be sold under a different
brand name by another distributor and avoid rigorous scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, California growers worry that the outbreak will dampen
demand and prices when their season starts in coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "It depressed prices for a month and a half last year," said Dan
Robinson, a grower in Blythe.</TE>
<TE>   Salmonella bacteria, which cling to the melons' rough surface, can
come from contaminated water, manure used as fertilizer or other
sources.</TE>
<TE>   FDA officials say consumers can reduce their risk of food-borne
illness by washing their hands and cutting surfaces before and after
handling produce and washing melons with cool water and a clean
produce brush.</TE>

<HD>CoStar Loses in Software Dispute</HD>
<DH>Courts: A judge strikes parts of an injunction barring an
ex-employee from developing products that interface with the firm's
proprietary data.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Irvine commercial real estate software developer has won a court
dispute with CoStar Group Inc. over his selling software that can
manipulate proprietary CoStar data.</LD>
<LD>   San Diego Superior Court Judge S. Charles Wickersham ruled mostly
in favor of software developer Andrew Blount in Blount's dispute with
national commercial property data supplier CoStar Group.</LD>
<LD>   Wickersham's ruling acknowledges that a key element of a permanent
injunction limiting Blount's activities is too broad.</LD>
<TE>   Wickersham authorized that injunction five years ago while
overseeing a dispute over Blount's activities as he departed from
Comps Infosystems in 1996. Comps later merged into CoStar, which now
is a publicly traded company offering a database of commercial real
estate in- formation in 50 metropolitan areas.</TE>
<TE>   Blount, meanwhile, established RealHound.com, an Irvine software
company specializing in programs that help commercial real estate
professionals track and analyze market and property data and
customize related reports.</TE>
<TE>   RealHound's clients include several large commercial real estate
services companies and property owners active in Southern
California--many of which also buy information from CoStar.</TE>
<TE>   Bethesda, Md.-based CoStar earlier this year asked the court to
find Blount in contempt for allegedly violating the injunction, which
among other restrictions prohibited him from developing or selling
computer programs able to manipulate, read or even interface with
CoStar's proprietary data.</TE>
<TE>   Blount's attorneys at Perkins Coie argued that certain
restrictions in the injunction constitute unlawful restraint of trade
and said their client would have to "refrain from writing database
management software altogether" in order to comply with the order.</TE>
<TE>   CoStar's attorneys from Luce Forward Hamilton &amp; Scripps argued in
court filings that Blount "attempts to piggyback on [CoStar's]
confidential and proprietary information by selling a software
program which loads and manipulates [CoStar's] information in direct
violation of the permanent injunction."</TE>
<TE>   Wickersham agreed with Blount's attorneys that the section of the
injunction pertaining to Blount's software-development restrictions
was too broad and ordered that section stricken from the injunction.</TE>
<TE>   CoStar said in a statement that the company was "deeply
disappointed" by the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   CoStar's stock fell 15 cents to close at $21.67 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Critical Path Chairman, Founder Resigns</HD>
<DH>Internet: David Hayden says e-mail provider is on the right
track after nearly collapsing in accounting scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LIEDTKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Beleaguered e-mail provider Critical Path Inc. on Monday parted ways
with its chairman and co-founder, David Hayden, a former building
contractor who cashed in on the Internet craze and then watched the
company nearly collapse in an accounting scandal.</LD>
<LD>   Hayden said he was resigning to focus on a new venture, which he
didn't identify. He also said he felt confident that San
Francisco-based Critical Path is back on the right track under Chief
Executive William E. McGlashan Jr., a venture capitalist Hayden
recruited last year.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel that I have succeeded in doing what the board asked me to
do in February of 2001--restore Critical Path to health," Hayden
said.</LD>
<TE>   Although its balance sheet has been strengthened by a $95-million
infusion made by investors last year, Critical Path remains
unprofitable.</TE>
<TE>   After losing $1.9 billion the last two years, the company suffered
a $26-million loss during the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Hayden, 46, had been working for a $1 annual salary, but the
company lent him $1.5 million in August, according to documents filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In February, Critical
Path agreed to forgive the loan if the company is sold for at least
$10 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Critical Path also agreed to pay Hayden $350,000 if he resigned
"for good reason." The company didn't indicate whether Hayden's
resignation would qualify him for the severance payment.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's resignation comes at a time when Hayden is under fire on
Wall Street for his role in another high-profile Internet company--
ETrade Group Inc.</TE>
<TE>   As chairman of ETrade's compensation committee, Hayden signed off
on a package that awarded the online brokerage company's CEO,
Christos Cotsakos, $80 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   The rich package drew fire from investors who zeroed in on the
ties between Critical Path and ETrade, which do business with each
other.</TE>
<TE>   In reaction to the criticism, Cotsakos last week agreed to return
about one-fourth of his pay package and forgo his salary for the next
two years.</TE>
<TE>   Hayden's resignation from Critical Path isn't related to the
highly publicized outrage over Cotsakos' contract, a Critical Path
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Hayden, who co-founded Critical Path in 1997, returned to the
company last year after the management team that replaced him
admitted to fabricating some sales during 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Two former Critical Path executives have pleaded guilty to
criminal charges that arose from the accounting scandal. An FBI
investigation is continuing against other former executives of the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Critical Path's shares closed up 7 cents to $1.56 on Nasdaq,
before news of Hayden's resignation was announced.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Daewoo Owners, Dealers Left in the Dust</HD>
<DH>Jobs, servicing are in question as GM buys just overseas
units</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As General Motors Corp. prepares to use the assets of bankrupt South
Korean auto maker Daewoo Motor Co. to expand its presence in Asia,
many Daewoo customers and dealers, as well as its distributor in the
U.S., say they've been run over by GM like so much road kill.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of Daewoo dealers have been left hanging, with no
indication from GM or Daewoo whether they will still be in business
in two months, and tens of thousands of customers are facing the
prospect of a lack of parts or service for their cars--at least until
July, when the GM-Daewoo deal closes.</LD>
<LD>   The world's biggest car company is spending $400 million to
acquire key Daewoo assets overseas, but not the company's U.S. import
and distribution arm--Compton-based Daewoo Motor America--or the
franchise contracts of any of Daewoo's 525 U.S. dealerships. That
leaves the U.S. operation in the hands of an empty shell in South
Korea, a bankrupt company with no funds and few assets.</LD>
<TE>   In the U.S., as many as 8,000 jobs in Daewoo dealerships are on
the line, as well as the fortunes of many Daewoo dealers who saw the
company as a way to break into the new-car retailing business. Some
of them spent millions of dollars building new, stand-alone Daewoo
sales and service facilities in the last year. Collectively they have
sold 160,000 Daewoo cars and station wagons since the company began
North American operations in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   GM will continue to manufacture Daewoo-brand cars at the plants it
is acquiring, for sale in South Korea and Europe. It may also use the
factories, to be operated by GM Daewoo Automotive &amp; Technology Co.,
to produce cars that bear the Chevrolet, Opel or other GM brands and
export them to other countries in Asia, Latin America and eventually
even the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The seeming collapse of Daewoo in this country over the last month
has left many owners wondering what hit them.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I'd have to worry about worldwide corporate
politics when I bought my car," said Ari Mishkin. The 38-year-old
hairstylist, who lives in Corona del Mar, paid $20,000 in 1999 for a
Daewoo station wagon with luxury equipment including leather seats
and a CD player.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was getting a good deal, and I've been really happy
with the car," he said, "but now it looks like I bought an Edsel."</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Burdick, a homemaker in Redondo Beach and owner of a
1999 Daewoo, said she's particularly disappointed "because we had the
chance to trade it in when we bought a new car a few months ago."
Instead, she and her husband opted to keep the $17,000 station wagon
as a commuter car.</TE>
<TE>   Now, she says, "we'll probably just drive it into the ground. I
don't think anyone would buy it." She also worries that if Daewoo
dealers fold, "we don't know where to take it for repairs or even if
we can get it fixed."</TE>
<TE>   Neither, apparently, does anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   GM has said that once the purchase of the overseas Daewoo units is
completed in July, "provisions will be made" for warranty repairs on
Daewoo cars in the U.S. But its plan seems to depend on existing
Daewoo dealers' staying in business--even though they are not getting
new cars or parts these days--in order to perform the warranty work.</TE>
<TE>   Some Daewoo dealers may choose to receive parts from South Korea
and remain in the service business, GM suggests. Or the new company
GM and its investment partners have formed to acquire the Daewoo
assets could set up a trust fund to reimburse U.S. Daewoo dealers or
others for performing warranty services.</TE>
<TE>   "We're concerned that customers are serviced properly," GM
spokeswoman Toni Simonetti said. "They should not have a problem."</TE>
<TE>   But until the GM deal closes in July, Daewoo owners should
continue to contact their Daewoo dealers, she said.</TE>
<TE>   And those dealers shouldn't look to GM for help. "GM never had a
relationship with Daewoo Motor America," Simonetti said.</TE>
<TE>   "Any issues dealers have are with Daewoo Motor Co. [in South
Korea], not with GM." Expecting GM to make Daewoo dealers whole is
"like asking Wal-Mart to be responsible for Kmart's bankruptcy," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   A group of more than 300 Daewoo dealers has retained legal counsel
and argues in a claim filed Thursday in Florida that GM should
continue honoring the dealers' franchise agreements. Dan Myers, the
Florida attorney representing the group, said he expects to file
similar claims with franchise regulators in Texas and Pennsylvania
this week and is considering an administrative action in California
and a federal damage suit as well.</TE>
<TE>   Despite GM's claims that it has no relationship with Daewoo in the
U.S., by saying it will honor Daewoo warranties later this year, the
auto maker seems to be claiming to have distribution rights for
Daewoo, Myers said. "If that's the case, then it should offer
existing Daewoo dealers the same franchise arrangements they had with
Daewoo," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those dealers wonder how long they'll be able to keep
their doors open.</TE>
<TE>   "The most frustrating part is that we really don't know anything.
We are in the dark because GM isn't talking to us, Daewoo in the U.S.
isn't talking to us and Daewoo in South Korea isn't talking to us,"
said John Haddad, owner of Daewoo dealerships in Huntington Beach and
Bakersfield. He also sells Kia vehicles, another South Korean brand,
and expects to simply close down the Daewoo side of his operation and
expand the Kia franchise.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be that easy for Bobby Colon, owner of Daewoo dealerships
in Cerritos, Fullerton, Ontario and Downey. His Downey store also
sells Dodges, so that will remain open, but a spokesman for Colon
said the three other stores are likely to be forced to close at some
point. Together, they employ about 120 people.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Uribe, the new general manager at Daewoo of Cerritos, said
Colon's dealerships would continue servicing customers' cars, with or
without warranty coverage, as long as they are able to remain open.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Connelly, vice president and general manager of Daewoo Motor
America, said he sympathizes but can't offer any comfort. "No one is
talking to us either," he said. "We keep calling [Daewoo in South]
Korea, but they don't call back. And GM won't tell us anything."</TE>
<TE>   Connelly said that Daewoo Motor America has an adequate stock of
most parts in its warehouses in Compton and Atlanta but acknowledged
that some parts--including critical pieces such as timing belts that
are necessary to keep cars running--are in short supply.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been on a cash-only basis with Korea," Connelly said,
"and we can't get new cars or buy new parts because we don't have
cash." Daewoo Motor America laid off about 100 employees late last
month, with a skeleton crew of 60 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Some industry watchers say the situation is a study in how not to
do things.</TE>
<TE>   "GM really needs to weigh the cost of the bad relationships it is
breeding," said Chris Denove, a partner at auto marketing consultant
J.D. Power &amp; Associates. "Daewoo is so small it just doesn't make
sense for GM to purchase parts of it while allowing customers in the
U.S. to go unfulfilled."</TE>
<TE>   Not every Daewoo owner feels abandoned, though.</TE>
<TE>   Vicky Weiseman, a 29-year-old Daewoo customer in Bethlehem, Pa.,
said in an e-mail interview that "it is reassuring to know that [GM]
will take care of Daewoo owners after July."</TE>
<TE>   Weiseman, who recently bought a 2001 Daewoo Lanos hatchback, the
company's smallest car, said, though, that she is "a bit nervous to
know that if something happens before July, I may have to pay the
total cost even if it is under warranty."</TE>
<TE>   It might be cheaper simply to buy a new Daewoo.</TE>
<TE>   Haddad, the Huntington Beach dealer, said he is offering 2002
model Daewoo sedans with a factory sticker price of $16,000 "for
about $9,000 now. I just want to get them off the lot" to reduce
carrying costs. He said he has 185 Daewoos in stock.</TE>

<HD>Dollar's Weakness May Persist, Analysts Warn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dollar was little changed against the euro and the yen Monday,
but it continued to lose value against other key currencies. Some
analysts warn that the dollar's recent weakness is likely to persist.</LD>
<LD>   That would be bad news for American tourists headed abroad this
spring and summer but potentially good news for U.S. investors in
foreign stocks.</LD>
<LD>   The dollar had been the strongman of world currencies in the last
few years, but this year it has lost ground against the euro, the yen
and many other major currencies. The dollar's weakness in part
reflects that some global investors have soured on the outlook for
the U.S. economy and markets.</LD>
<TE>   "People are realizing that the U.S. is not as good a place to
invest in as it was," said Scott Barlass, who helps manage $20
billion in assets for Abbey National Asset Managers in Glasgow,
Scotland. "It will be a grind lower for the dollar," he predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone agrees. Expectations of relatively strong economic
data this week "bode well for the dollar's prospects," said Greg
Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting in
Washington. "People seem to want to flood right back" into
dollar-denominated assets on signs of an improving U.S. economy, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   One dollar was worth 127.70 yen and 1.097 euros in New York on
Monday. That's down from 131.62 yen and 1.122 euros at the start of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar has taken a bigger fall this year against some other
currencies, notably the Australian and New Zealand dollars, which
have been boosted by the strength of their economies.</TE>
<TE>   A weaker U.S. dollar means American tourists' money won't go as
far overseas this year. But a falling dollar can enhance returns for
U.S. investors in foreign stocks, because those stocks are worth more
when translated from local currencies into dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Though the dollar has fallen against many key currencies, it is
gaining value in Latin America. The dollar buys nearly 7% more
Brazilian reals and 4% more Mexican pesos than at year's end.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's currency has weakened on concerns that left-wing
presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is gaining in the
polls, though the election won't be held until October.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico the peso has fallen as the country's central bank has
lowered interest rates. Many analysts say the central bank is heeding
the calls from major Mexican industrial companies that have lobbied
for a weaker currency, which makes the country's exports cheaper
abroad.</TE>

<HD>Group Targets Digital TV Piracy</HD>
<DH>Technology: Studios and companies seek to put electronic
locks on broadcasts, limiting what viewers can do with recorded
media.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the name of fighting piracy, a group of Hollywood studios,
technology companies and consumer-electronics manufacturers wants to
slap electronic locks on free, over-the-air television programs that
viewers record digitally.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal is just one of a bundle of restrictions on digital TV
signals that the group is considering for digital TV sets, computers
and other devices. The restrictions, which are being fought by a few
companies and consumer advocates, could spell trouble for viewers as
they upgrade from analog TVs and VCRs to their digital successors,
such as DVD recorders.</LD>
<LD>   For instance, a viewer who digitally records "The West Wing" on
his or her living room DVD recorder may be unable to play the disc on
one of today's DVD players.</LD>
<TE>   Stopping digital TV piracy is part of a broad effort by the
studios, record companies and other copyright holders to limit what
viewers can do with media in the digital age. These companies argue
that piracy poses an extraordinary threat, but critics say the
studios, labels and publishers are trying to stifle innovation and
roll back consumers' rights.</TE>
<TE>   The main goal of the studios, TV manufacturers and computer
companies in the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group is to prevent
programs aired on digital TV stations from being transmitted over the
Internet. Online file-trading networks already make a substantial
number of TV shows available for free, but the studios fear that
digital TV will make it even easier for pirates to record, copy and
share programs on the Net.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the studios say they're reluctant to let broadcasters
air their most valuable movies in high-definition TV, the richest
form of digital signal. Set manufacturers, in turn, blame the
shortage of compelling HDTV programming for the sluggish sales of
digital TV receivers, which are in fewer than 1million homes today.</TE>
<TE>   The Broadcast Protection Discussion Group's latest draft proposal,
released Saturday, would require devices that receive digital TV
broadcasts to protect them with an approved anti-piracy technology
before sending them over a digital connector to be displayed,
recorded or stored. The proposal is still being debated within the
group, with a final version expected this month.</TE>
<TE>   After that work is finished, a separate group will try to come up
with a way to make sure that manufacturers equip their new sets,
recorders, cable TV boxes, satellite receivers, computers and related
devices with the technology.</TE>
<TE>   That effort is likely to involve lobbying Congress for a mandate
affecting all devices capable of receiving, displaying or recording
digital TV signals.</TE>
<TE>   The only anti-piracy technologies on the initial approved list are
ones that scramble the digital TV signal electronically. And the only
digital TV programs that would not have to be scrambled after they're
received are those that aren't marked by the broadcaster for
protection or that aren't moved digitally from device to device.</TE>
<TE>   A likely result, critics say, is that DVD recorders will
automatically scramble the programs they record from local digital
channels. And a scrambled disc won't play on any of the tens of
millions of DVD players that consumers already have purchased,
including the growing number in cars.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, those discs will play only on a new generation of DVD
players and recorders that include one of the approved protection
technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Epstein, a senior researcher at Philips Research Labs,
acknowledged that consumers could avoid the scrambling problem by
using an analog connection between their recorder and their digital
set. But most consumers would connect their recorders to the digital
output on a cable TV receiver, unwittingly triggering the scrambling
function.</TE>
<TE>   "More than likely, people wouldn't understand what they would have
to do" to rewire their entertainment centers and solve the problem,
Epstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Kraus, founder of advocacy group DigitalConsumer.org and of
Excite.com, said a more fundamental problem is the assumption that
all retransmissions online have to be stopped, rather than just the
ones that violate copyright law. His privately funded group wants to
exempt fair uses, such as including excerpts from a digital TV
broadcast in a homework assignment submitted by e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that it's next to impossible to design a protection
technology that can tell the difference between fair use and piracy.
But, Kraus countered, "we don't prevent anybody from driving because
some people drive drunk."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "Technical measures like this rarely prevent piracy, but
burden consumers, stifle innovation and generally are bad ideas."</TE>
<TE>   Chairmen of the discussion group and the Motion Picture Assn.'s
representative on the panel could not be reached Monday for comment.</TE>

<HD>Questions Raised by E-Mail on Energy</HD>
<DH>Policy: Message gleaned from administration energy task
force staff member leads Democrats to voice suspicion over meaning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An e-mail from a high-ranking staff member of the Bush
administration's energy task force said officials were "desperately
trying to avoid California" in a report dealing with the energy
crisis last year, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The e-mail, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by
watchdog and environmental groups and also provided to Waxman, was
largely redacted and neither administration officials nor the
congressman could say specifically what the task force staffer was
discussing.</LD>
<LD>   But Waxman seized on the missive to turn up the heat on the White
House to release all documents relating to the task force's
discussions about California's energy crisis.</LD>
<TE>   Waxman said the e-mail, along with the recent release of documents
showing Enron sought to manipulate the California energy market,
"underscores the need for the administration to provide a complete
accounting of its understanding of and approach to the energy
crisis."</TE>
<TE>   "It is important to know what, if anything, the administration
knew about Enron's efforts to manipulate the California energy
market," Waxman said in a letter to Vice President Dick Cheney, who
chaired the task force.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail was sent May 4, 2001, by Karen Knutson, deputy director
of the energy task force, to Environmental Protection Agency official
Jacob Moss. It raised concerns about putting into the report a
paragraph "emphasizing environmentally difficult issues about
expediting permitting to deal with a crisis."</TE>
<TE>   "We are desperately trying to avoid California in this report as
much as possible," it continues. "Can you make the same point without
going into California?"</TE>
<TE>   Knutson could not be reached for comment, and administration
officials could not say what it was about California that she sought
to keep out of the report. But they defended their actions on
California's energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "Congressman Waxman has confused the Bush administration with the
lack of action taken by the Clinton administration," said Energy
Department spokeswoman Jeanne Lopatto. She said the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, on Bush's watch, imposed electricity price
controls and launched an investigation into whether Enron and other
power sellers sought to use their market power to drive up prices.</TE>
<TE>   The task force report released last year features California
prominently, using the state's problems to bolster its arguments for
building more power plants.</TE>
<TE>   Waxman said the e-mail appeared to have come to light through an
"inadvertent failure on the part of EPA to redact information it had
intended to redact."</TE>
<TE>   He said it raised questions about whether the widespread deletion
of information from thousands of pages of documents turned over by
federal agencies were the result of the administration's claims that
disclosure would chill frank and open discussion or were intended to
avoid embarrassment.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney spokeswoman Jennifer Millerwise called Waxman's letter
"another in a long list of politically motivated letters that
Congressman Waxman regularly sends out."</TE>
<TE>   She said the purpose of the administration's national energy plan
was "to develop a strategic, long-term energy policy for the country
... not to focus on short-term problems specific to a state."</TE>
<TE>   Waxman's letter was the latest salvo in a yearlong effort by
congressional Democrats to force the administration to make public
details of private meetings held with lobbyists during drafting of
the energy plan.</TE>
<TE>   The battle was fired up last week with the release of internal
Enron memos that detailed an array of Enron price-manipulation
strategies. Two Senate committees plan hearings on the memos
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), chairman of the Senate subcommittee
on consumer affairs, said he plans to grill the authors of the Enron
memos to "try to figure out who was involved in creating the
strategies" and how far up in Enron's management knowledge of the
strategies reached.</TE>
<TE>   Dorgan said he also expects to question an official from FERC,
probably its chairman, Patrick H. Wood III, to find out "what it knew
and what it didn't know and why."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a horrible failure on the part of regulators," Dorgan said
in an interview Monday. "FERC was sitting on its hands."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a member of the subcommittee on
consumer affairs, cited California's budget problems Monday in urging
Wood to act swiftly to complete its price-manipulation investigation
and provide refunds and renegotiated energy contracts, "so other
vital services, such as health care and education, do not have to be
cut to continue to pay for manipulated electricity prices."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Comedian Jimmy Kimmel will launch a late-night talk show on ABC in
January, the network is expected to announce today, a move that would
spell the end of "Politically Incorrect With Bill Maher."</LD>
<LD>   ABC is said to be negotiating with Maher and his representatives
as to when "Politically Incorrect," which airs weeknights at 12:05
a.m. after "Nightline," will leave the air.</LD>
<LD>   Although Maher's show is under contract through the end of the
year, it isn't expected to last beyond the summer. At that point,
ABC, a unit of  Walt Disney Co., could extend "Nightline" to an hour,
eventually airing Kimmel's show at 12:30 a.m., or give the comedian
Maher's current time slot.</LD>
<TE>   Kimmel will be introduced as ABC unveils its new fall prime-time
schedule at the annual "advertising upfront" presentations in New
York.</TE>

<LD>Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB satellite broadcaster said it will force
Germany's collapsing Kirch media conglomerate to repay $1.5 billion,
money the Munich-based company probably doesn't have.</LD>
<LD>   BSkyB said in a statement it was exercising an option granted when
it bought a 22% stake in KirchPayTV, the failed pay television wing
of Kirch Group, Germany's largest private broadcaster.</LD>
<LD>   The move was an additional blow to Kirch Group, after its
KirchMedia television and film rights division and its KirchPayTV
filed for bankruptcy protection.</LD>

money out of Kirch, which is saddled with a mountain of debt reaching
some $5.7billion.</TE>

<HD>Blackstone Near Deal to Buy Columbia House</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blackstone Group, a privately held investment group, is close to a
deal to buy Columbia House, the music club owned by Sony Corp. and
AOL Time Warner Inc., for about $450 million, sources familiar with
the matter said.</LD>
<LD>   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a deal
could be announced early this week, confirming published reports.</LD>
<LD>   Spokesmen for Blackstone, Sony and Warner Music Group declined to
comment.</LD>
<TE>   Columbia House has been facing tough competition in its music
sales business from Amazon.com and other online retailers. The music
club had been in a deal to merge with music retailer CDNow in 1999,
but that deal fell apart.</TE>
<TE>   Sony and Warner have been looking for a buyer for Columbia House
for the last few years. Bertelsmann, which runs a rival music club,
BMG Direct, bought CDNow in 2000 for $117 million.</TE>
<TE>   Columbia House went through a restructuring in early 2000 and
closed a major compact disc and video distribution center last year,
a move that cost 500 jobs. But business is believed to have picked up
recently with a move to DVD sales.</TE>
<TE>   Blackstone Group is an investment firm with stakes in real estate,
Universal Studios Florida, Allied Waste and Centennial
Communications. It was founded in 1985 by chairman Peter Peterson and
CEO Stephen Schwarzman.</TE>
<TE>   Columbia House was started in 1955 as a music club and now also
sells TV and movie videos as well as DVDs.</TE>
<TE>   It offers more than 14,000 music titles and has 14 million members
in the United States, Canada and Mexico.</TE>

<HD>Sony to Lower the Cost of PS2</HD>
<DH>Games: Microsoft is expected to match price. Nintendo
announces move into online market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sony Corp. will slash the price of its popular PlayStation 2 video
game console by a third today, potentially sparking a price war with
rivals Microsoft Corp. and Nintendo Co. as the three companies jostle
for a share of the $27-billion global games market.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, Nintendo said it will break into the online
games market by selling a modem for its GameCube console this fall.</LD>
<LD>   Monday's announcements came a week before the start of the
Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, the industry's biggest
convention, which begins next week in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Sony's price cut puts the PS2 at $199 in the United States, the
same as the GameCube. Sony also is slicing by half the cost of its
less powerful PS One console to $49.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's Xbox continues to sell for $299, but many analysts
expect the Redmond, Wash., giant to match Sony's price within a few
days.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear Microsoft has to cut to $199," said Michael Pachter,
director of research at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles, who
estimated that a combined price cut from Microsoft and Sony would
boost console sales by an additional 15% to 20% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft declined to comment, and Nintendo said it had no plans
to cut the price of its GameCube.</TE>
<TE>   Those who stand to gain most from a price war are software
companies that make games for the discounted consoles. In the long
run, however, console companies also benefit from additional
royalties on every game sold.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers will have an extra $100 to spend on games, so the two
biggest beneficiaries are specialty game retailers and software
companies" such as Electronic Arts Inc., THQ Inc., Activision Inc.
and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., Pachter said.</TE>
<TE>   Sony's news lifted the stocks of those four game publishers above
the market average Monday. Activision shares rose 5.3% on Nasdaq,
Take-Two gained nearly 5%, THQ jumped 4.5%, and EA rose $3.4%. Nasdaq
jumped 3.2% in comparison.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Nintendo said it will sell two modems for $34.99 each,
one for dial-up connections and one for high-speed connections to
play games such as Sega Corp.'s "Phantasy Star Online." Nintendo's
news surprised analysts, who pointed to the company's numerous
negative comments about the market for online games played via
consoles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a complete reversal of what they said a month ago when they
indicated they had no interest in online gaming," Pachter said. "That
said, I don't think it's a big deal. It's not a significant market."</TE>
<TE>   Both Sony and Microsoft also have online plans. Sony has said it
will sell an adapter in August for $39.99 that will let gamers
connect via dial-up or high-speed connections to play games such as
"EverQuest" and "Final Fantasy."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft is expected to unveil at E3 its online program, Xbox
Live. Xbox comes with a built-in Ethernet adaptor.</TE>

<HD>Incentive Pay for Execs at Global Crossing OKd</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High-speed network operator Global Crossing Ltd. will pay some
workers incentives to stay on, with nearly half a million dollars
allotted to two executives who are defendants in suits related to the
company's collapse, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge ruled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Robert Gerber, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York in Manhattan, approved the plan to give 417
employees a total of $8.25 million to stay with Global Crossing while
the company reorganizes under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan. Incentive
awards are not uncommon in bankruptcy cases.</LD>
<LD>   Gerber agreed with the attorneys representing Global Crossing that
the individuals were critical to ensure the value of the company to
attract buyers and pay creditors.</LD>
<TE>   Bermuda-based Global Crossing, which became the fourth-largest
insolvency case when it filed for protection from creditors, is
expected to leave about $10 billion to $12 billion of claims in its
wake.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing faces an investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and continued scrutiny by congressional
investigators who are probing questionable accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Despite objections from lawyers representing the State Teachers
Retirement System of Ohio and Public Employees Retirement System of
Ohio, Gerber allowed Joseph Perrone, Global Crossing senior vice
president of finance, and Dan Cohrs, the company's chief financial
officer, to receive the largest incentives.</TE>
<TE>   "They were essentially in charge of the ship when it ran into the
iceberg," said Geoffrey Jarvis, attorney for the Ohio pension fund
that lost about $116 million in its investment in Global Crossing.
Perrone and Cohrs are named in a shareholder suit the Ohio pension
fund filed.</TE>
<TE>   Jarvis noted that Cohrs sold $7.6million in Global Crossing stock,
$2.1 million in the last 14 months, and Perrone was chief audit
partner for Arthur Andersen's business with Global Crossing before
the telecommunications company hired him in May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The plan awards Perrone an incentive of $225,000 and Cohrs
$250,000. The average award will be about $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   However, the judge agreed with attorney Michael Walsh of Weil
Gotshal &amp; Manges, which represents Global Crossing. Walsh said the
men were "absolutely essential" to the company's reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   Perrone oversees all payments the company has made since it filed
for bankruptcy protection on Jan. 28. Cohrs is involved in the
restructuring and in negotiations with potential bidders.</TE>
<TE>   The plan also includes $5 million in a discretionary fund if other
employees are identified. The creditors committee, composed of
unsecured creditors and banks, must approve the use of half the fund.
The court agreed not to name the 417 others because of possible
poaching by Global Crossing rivals.</TE>

<HD>Bond Guru Says Risks Are Rising</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bond market guru Bill Gross on Monday again warned investors that
long-term bonds may be a poor investment for the foreseeable future.</LD>
<LD>   Gross, a managing director at $250-billion-asset Pacific
Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach, said on CNBC that he
believes the U.S. inflation rate could double to more than 3% as the
economy rebounds.</LD>
<LD>   He wasn't specific about how soon inflation might revive, but
Gross said he is already positioning Pimco's bond portfolios
accordingly, moving assets out of longer-term securities and into
shorter-term ones.</LD>
<TE>   If inflation rises, pulling interest rates in general higher,
longer-term bonds probably would suffer the biggest declines in
value, Gross noted. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of
market interest rates. "We want to be invested in shorter pieces of
paper because they have less price risk," Gross said.</TE>
<TE>   Long-term Treasury bond yields bottomed in November, when the
10-year T-note yield fell to 4.2%. The yield on that security rose to
5.22% Monday from 5.12% Friday, fueled in part by Gross' comments. On
Dec. 31 the yield was at 5.05%, and it rose as high as 5.43% in
April.</TE>
<TE>   Even though government and corporate bond yields have inched up
this year--the exception being yields on corporate junk bonds, which
have fallen--investors in bond mutual funds are mostly enjoying
positive "total" returns of between 1.5% and 3% year to date. That's
because interest earnings are more than compensating for any decline
in bond values.</TE>
<TE>   But Gross is warning that investors in longer-term bond funds
could see red if market rates surge with inflation.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grubb &amp; Ellis Co., one of the nation's largest commercial real estate
brokerage and services firms, on Monday reported a loss and lower
revenue during its fiscal third quarter as a weakened economy
undermined property sales and leasing activity.</LD>
<LD>   For the three-month period ended March 31, the New York-based
company reported a net loss, before one-time charges, of $5.2million
compared with a loss of $903,000 during the same period last year.</LD>
<LD>   Third-quarter revenue dropped 27.4% on a year-over-year basis to
$58.2 million.</LD>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, Grubb &amp; Ellis shares
fell 3 cents to $3.</TE>
<TE>   The company has undergone significant changes in recent years as
it expanded beyond its core commercial real estate brokerage to offer
a variety of real estate and consulting services.</TE>
<TE>   "The current economic recession continues to impact our revenue,
which has been running about 30% below last year since the start of
our fiscal year," said Barry M. Barovick, president and chief
executive.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that the initiatives we've established to provide our
clients with integrated real estate services operate more efficiently
and secure the company's capital structure."</TE>

<HD>Office Tenants Bet on Early Renewals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Southern California's office market lingering in the doldrums,
many tenants are taking advantage of the situation by renewing their
leases while they have an edge over landlords.</LD>
<LD>   The strategy is a gamble on the part of tenants, who are betting
that rents today are lower than they will be a year from now.</LD>
<LD>   Landlords may not like negotiating under such conditions, but the
growing number of early renewals is a noticeable improvement over the
lack of leasing that has characterized the market in recent months,
say industry observers.</LD>
<TE>   "More companies have a sense of security about what's going on in
their business, and they are willing to commit early to take
advantage of the economic conditions in the leasing market," said
Steve Case, senior managing director for CB Richard Ellis in Orange
County. "It's an encouraging sign."</TE>
<TE>   Depending on their size, most tenants start talking to their
landlords about renewing leases six months to 24 months before their
current agreements expire.</TE>
<TE>   Some tenants now are beginning discussions as much as three years
in advance. "Of the business being done, it's probably the majority
of the deals," said Julien J. Studley Inc. broker Howard Sadowsky of
early lease renewals.</TE>
<TE>   Although tenants can avoid future increases and, in some cases,
reduce their current rent, the strategy could backfire if the economy
and real estate markets continue to weaken.</TE>
<TE>   "Rates could drop again and tenants are going to say, 'Maybe we
should have waited,'" said broker David Thurman of Grubb &amp; Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   However, if tenants wait too long, their bargaining power may
wane.</TE>
<TE>   "The best time to be a tenant in the marketplace is when the
perception is that the markets are still declining," said Dave Toomey
of Cresa Partners, a real estate brokerage. "Once things start to
pick up, and landlords start to see activity and the vacancy rate
drops below 10%, then tenants start to lose their leverage."</TE>
<TE>   One of Toomey's clients, accounting firm RBZ, had three years
remaining on its full-floor lease in Brentwood when it approached the
landlord about renewing.</TE>
<TE>   The landlord agreed to start discussions, and the firm stands to
save an estimated $1 million over the life of the new 10-year lease
by avoiding an anticipated turnaround next year in the Westside
market.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the market is going to be a landlord's market, and we
might have gotten hit with a higher rental rate at that time," Toomey
said. "Right now is a very good time for a tenant to be in the
market. We think it will continue to be the case for the next 12
months. Maybe longer."</TE>
<TE>   Landlords who agree to sign a deal now may lose out on a possible
increase in lease rates. But they can take comfort in retaining
tenants who now have the flexibility to shop around in a market with
ample amounts of vacant space, brokers say.</TE>
<TE>   Freight hauler Conway Western Express started negotiating its
lease renewal last summer, even though its agreement does not expire
until early 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Conway was able to take advantage of lower rates and committed to
a 10-year lease and will expand into 26,000 square feet of space,
said broker Travis Boyd at CB Richard Ellis.</TE>

<HD>Dow Surges on Chip, Job Reports</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Strong forecast for Applied Materials fuels tech
hopes. Skeptics question whether recent momentum will last.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A promising profit forecast for Applied Materials and a sign of
possible improvement in the job market incited another round of
bargain hunting on Wall Street on Monday, lifting technology stocks
and propelling the Dow Jones industrials nearly 170 points higher.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second triple-digit gain for the Dow in four sessions,
but analysts were skeptical that the momentum would last. The advance
followed a losing week for the major indexes, suggesting that the
market was merely rebounding as investors searched for good deals,
rather than shaking off the malaise that has weighed on trading for
more than a month.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow rose 169.74 points, or 1.7%, to close at 10,109.66.
Broader indicators fared even better. The tech-focused Nasdaq
composite index rose 51.69 points, or 3.2%, to 1,652.54. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 index gained 19.57 points, or 1.9%, to 1,074.56.</LD>
<TE>   Even with the big advance, market breadth was less than eye-
popping, with winners outnumbering losers by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq and the
New York Stock Exchange. Also, volume was light, an indication that
many investors were staying away.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street got a lift from a survey by Manpower, the nation's
largest staffing company, showing that businesses expect to hire more
employees in the third quarter, particularly in manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   Top chip-manufacturing equipment maker Applied Materials,
scheduled to report its quarterly results after the closing bell
today, rose $1.88, or 7.9%, to $25.58 after Goldman Sachs raised its
earnings estimates for the company. Several chip equipment makers
followed Applied Materials higher. Novellus Systems rallied $3.10 to
$49.40; KLA-Tencor rose $3.07 to $57.47.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's buying spread across the tech sector. Microsoft climbed
$2.64 to $52.69, while Intel advanced $1.51 to $28.52, Dell Computer
gained $1.48 to $25.36, and IBM, working its way back from last
week's 3 1/2-year low, added $2.51 to $82.19.</TE>
<TE>   Investors are hoping that technology companies, including Dell,
will unveil quarterly earnings this week that top analysts'
estimates. A positive earnings report from tech bellwether Cisco
Systems last week sparked the market's biggest one-day showing since
September, but the rally faded by week's end as some investors
decided not to risk their gains and cashed out.</TE>
<TE>   "We are still working off what is technically an oversold market,
and a good-news story can cause a decent rally," said Barry Hyman,
chief investment strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. "As far as
sustainability, though, we'll have to see."</TE>
<TE>   Financial stocks also fared well. American Express advanced $1.50
to $43, while Citigroup rose 94cents to $44.24 despite a published
report questioning its finances.</TE>
<TE>   Lands' End surged $10.71, or 21%, to $61.73 on word that Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co. was buying the catalog retailer for about $1.9 billion.
Sears rose 19 cents to $52.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street is waiting for today's Commerce Department report on
April retail sales.</TE>
<TE>   Stores released their own figures last week, and many were
disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   Bond yields rose as money moved from fixed-income investments to
stocks.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of power companies tumbled again as questions mounted
about the firms' energy-trading practices. Michigan utility owner CMS
Energy slumped $3.24 to $16.05. Energy trader Dynegy fell for a ninth
day, losing 57 cents to $9.31. Williams, another energy trader, fell
94 cents to $15.55.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant Resources plunged $2.06, or 17%, to $9.94 after Friday's
17% loss. Parent Reliant Energy fell $3.86, or 18%, to $17.59 and was
the biggest drag on the S&amp;P 500.</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil prices hit an eight-month high, rising 39 cents to
$28.38 a barrel in New York trading, pulling oil stocks higher. Exxon
Mobil added $1.05 to $40.01, ChevronTexaco climbed $2.15 to $90.10,
and oil-field services giant Schlumberger rose $1.04 to $56.54.</TE>

<HD>Reliant Admits Bogus Trades; Stock Plunges</HD>
<DH>Energy: Power industry and investors are shaken by the
latest revelation of unethical practices. The Houston company blames
'misguided employees.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Houston energy company Reliant Resources Inc. admitted Monday that it
used phony trades to inflate the company's revenue by about 10%
during the last three years--a disclosure that caused investors to
further doubt the health of all energy merchants and raised new
questions about the ethics of the industry.</LD>
<LD>   Reliant's sham deals are the latest practices disclosed by the
energy-trading industry amid investigations by federal regulators and
Congress into phony accounting and market manipulation. Other major
energy-trading companies have acknowledged structuring deals to cut
taxes, hide debt and possibly manipulate prices.</LD>
<LD>   Several energy companies, already stung in financial markets last
week by investor fears that they might be linked to market
manipulation in California of the sort revealed by Enron Corp., lost
even more value Monday with Reliant's admission. The sham trades
would amount to nearly $6 billion, based on Reliant's revenue, though
the company did not put a specific dollar value on the matter.</LD>
<TE>   And the admission, coming on top of a disclosure last week of
similar trades by Dynegy Inc., raised new questions about whether
potential expansion of electricity deregulation and energy trading in
the United States would encounter new resistance.</TE>
<TE>   "After last week's events, the credibility and confidence in the
unregulated power sector reached new lows," said Steven Fleishman, a
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. utility analyst.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the stocks of virtually all the major energy traders have
dropped sharply in the last year as Enron's meltdown frightened
investors and the economic slowdown hammered profits. Reliant
Resources shares have slid 73% from their peak in the last year, and
its parent company, Reliant Energy Inc., has seen its shares drop 63%
during the same period.</TE>
<TE>   R. Steve Letbetter, chief executive of Reliant Resources, blamed
the bogus trades on "some misguided employees" who wanted to improve
the company's standing on industry top 10 lists. He did not identify
the managers but said they no longer work for Reliant.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant's income figures were unaffected by the transactions,
known among professionals as "round-trip" trades, Letbetter said. The
company is financially strong but is taking a "time out" from most
pure trading activities not related to its assets, which include
several power plants in California, Letbetter said.</TE>
<TE>   "These transactions are inconsistent with our company
philosophy....These types of transaction are no longer occurring at
Reliant and will not occur in the future," Letbetter said in a
conference call with analysts. He said the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which is conducting an informal investigation of Reliant
after a recent earnings restatement, also is looking at the sham
energy trades.</TE>
<TE>   In the deals, Reliant sold energy to another company and bought
the same amount of energy back for the same price. The practice did
not affect the price or availability of power but made Reliant look
as if it were trading more power than it really was, Reliant said.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, for example, Reliant did round-trip trades of 78 million
megawatt-hours of electricity and 45 billion cubic feet of natural
gas, boosting its trading volumes enough to rank it third among
traders that year after Enron and American Electric Power Inc.
Without those trades, the company actually ranked fifth, Reliant
said.</TE>
<TE>   Such trades accounted for 30 million megawatt-hours in each of the
years 1999 and 2000, the company said. In all, revenue for the last
three years, which totaled $64.3 billion, was pumped up by about 10%,
Reliant said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Reliant abruptly canceled a $500-million private debt
placement and disclosed that round-trip trading had occurred, but it
did not give details. When asked if the practice is widespread in the
industry, Reliant Resources Executive Vice President Joe Bob Perkins
in Monday's conference call said tersely: "It's possible. I don't
really know."</TE>
<TE>   Reliant said its primary partner in the bogus trades was CMS
Energy Corp. of Dearborn, Mich., but it also did smaller trades with
Encana Energy Services, a subsidiary of Encana Corp.; Public Service
Co. of Colorado, a unit of Xcel Energy Inc.; and Merchant Energy
Group of the Americas.</TE>
<TE>   These developments are only the latest to roil the energy-trading
business, which turned sour even before the December bankruptcy
filing of Enron, at the time the world's largest energy trader.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks have been pummeled in recent weeks by suspicions of
accounting irregularities at other companies as well as worries that
other power sellers might have used techniques to manipulate
California's power market such as those revealed in memos written by
Enron lawyers and released by federal regulators last week.</TE>
<TE>   Although Reliant Resources moved quickly to try to soothe
investors and regulators, its shares lost 17% of their value Monday,
closing at $9.94, and those of Reliant Energy, which hopes to fully
spin off Reliant Resources, fell 18% to $17.59; both trade on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies hit hard were CMS Energy, down 16.8% to $16.05 a
share; Dynegy, down 5.77% to $9.31; and Williams Cos., down 5.7% to
$15.55. San Jose-based Calpine Corp. bucked the trend, rising 3.51%
to $8.85.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expressed surprise at the extent of Reliant's round-trip
trades but doubted that they violated any laws except possibly SEC
reporting requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "It may not have been very prudent, but I'm not sure it was
criminal," said Jon Kyle Cartwright, an energy analyst with the
brokerage firm Raymond James &amp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The trades "just raise questions at a time when you don't want to
be raising them," said Christopher Budzynski of the investment firm
Legg Mason Wood Walker. "At this point, the market is pricing at a
pretty draconian, worst-case view of these stocks."</TE>
<TE>   However, the developments raise new questions about the growth
potential of energy trading and the future of deregulated markets in
the United States, analyst Fleishman said.</TE>
<TE>   "The market has grown skeptical of this sector," he said. "Up
until last week, the momentum toward full deregulation had been
picking up again thanks to low wholesale prices and a better
political backdrop. But after last week, the tone can best be
described as 'one step forward, two steps back.'"</TE>
<TE>   Reliant is active in the California market and was among the 150
energy companies that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asked
to state whether they engaged in any of the practices that Enron
memos revealed it used to manipulate prices in California.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant acknowledged Monday that it submitted false power
schedules at least twice to the state's grid operator but that it did
so one time at the operator's request, said Reliant Resources general
counsel Hugh Rice Kelly. The second incident was minor, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Reliant at times bought power in the primary market,
the California Power Exchange, and sold it at a higher price in the
last-minute market run by the California Independent System Operator,

<HD>Justices Back FCC in Local Phone Battle</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court on Monday supported the effort to bring competition
to the local telephone market as the justices upheld federal rules
that allow outsiders to lease local lines at a relatively low cost.</LD>
<LD>   The 7-1 ruling is a victory for the Federal Communications
Commission, which is seeking to spur competition, and for
long-distance providers such as AT&amp;T Corp. and WorldCom Inc., which
have been eager to move into the local phone market when local phone
carriers increasingly are allowed to offer long-distance services.</LD>
<LD>   To offer local service, the long-distance companies need to lease
lines running from switching centers into homes and offices, and
Monday's ruling clears the way for them to do just that at prices
that are believed to be competitive.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling is a setback for what the court referred to as the
"incumbent monopolists," such as Verizon Communications Inc. and
BellSouth Corp., that are fighting to preserve their traditional hold
on local phone service.</TE>
<TE>   After the breakup of AT&amp;T in 1984, local phone service was divided
among seven companies, known colloquially as the "Baby Bells." In
1996, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act, which encouraged
other companies to compete with the Baby Bells in the
$100-billion-a-year local phone business. However, disputes over the
best way to achieve competition have thwarted that goal.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon and other Baby Bells went to court to challenge the
authority of the FCC to set pricing rules. After losing in the
Supreme Court on that issue, they challenged the rules themselves as
unfair, contending that pricing rules should allow them to profit
from their original investment in building the lines, rather than the
lower cost of duplicating new lines today.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court justices said Monday that there was no entirely
right or fair answer to this complicated regulatory dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "The job of judges is to ask whether the [FCC] made choices
reasonably ... in deciding what and how items must be leased and the
way to set rates for leasing them," said Justice David H. Souter for
the court. The commission's pricing rules "appear to be a reasonable
policy for now, and that is all that counts."</TE>
<TE>   Experts disagreed, however, on whether there is still a market for
competitive, wired local phone service. Given the recent financial
carnage in the telecommunications industry, the court's ruling may
have come too late to benefit consumers or jump-start significant
local phone competition.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 local telephone companies have gone out of business
since Congress passed telecom reform in 1996. Some 80 regional rivals
to the Baby Bells remain, and they control just 10% of all local
phone lines, according to the Assn. for Local Telecommunications
Services in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the cell phone industry has driven down the cost of
wireless service to the point that some consumers are abandoning
their wired phones. The trend has left investors wary of pouring more
money into establishing local phone business, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   The decision comes at a critical time for California, where state
regulators are scheduled Thursday to set new interim leasing prices
to promote local phone competition.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being the nation's largest market for telecommunications,
the state has seen little competition in residential phone service.
Rival companies have said they have stayed away because the state's
leasing prices were too high, making it impossible for newcomers to
make a profit.</TE>
<TE>   SBC Communications Inc.'s SBC Pacific Bell, the dominant phone
provider in California, has opposed efforts to reduce the leasing
prices. Had the Supreme Court sided with the local companies, it
would have been a blow to the efforts of California regulators to set
lower leasing prices for parts of the SBC PacBell network.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, California regulators are set to select one of three
proposals for new pricing for SBC PacBell. MCI, the consumer phone
service arm of WorldCom, backs the proposal supported by Loretta
Lynch, president of the California Public Utility Commission.</TE>
<TE>   If those price are approved, "MCI will aggressively enter local
phone markets throughout [PacBell's] territory in California," said
Jim Lewis, the company's senior vice president for public policy.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Toys R Us Inc., the No. 2 U.S. toy retailer, said it will post a
narrower fiscal first-quarter loss after the company reduced costs
and shoppers bought more toys at remodeled stores.</LD>
<LD>   The loss in the period ended May 4 was as little as 2 cents a
share, less than the year-earlier loss of 9 cents, the toy seller
said. The retailer was expected to lose 9 cents, the average estimate
of analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<LD>   The retailer sold more exclusive items, which carry higher profit
margins, and reduced costs after cutting jobs, closing stores and
combining parts of some divisions, investors said. Chief Executive
John Eyler is improving service and remodeling stores to win
customers from Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the No. 1 toy seller.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Paramus, N.J.-based Toys R Us fell 11 cents to $17.09 on
the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has declined 17% this year.</TE>

<LD>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. posted its first annual profit in three years
despite lower sales, helped by cost cutting as part of a turnaround
plan with German partner DaimlerChrysler.</LD>
<LD>   Executives said the Japanese auto maker still faced a challenge in
repairing its battered corporate image.</LD>
<LD>   Mitsubishi Motors posted a net group profit of $89 million for the
fiscal year ended in March, largely on cost-reduction efforts with
DaimlerChrysler, which owns 37.3% of Japan's No. 4 auto maker. Sales
for fiscal 2001 totaled $25 billion, down 2% from a year earlier.</LD>

<LD>A judge rejected billionaire Ronald Perelman's proposed
$14.75-million settlement of investor lawsuits over the sale of his
stake in movie camera maker Panavision Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Delaware Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine ruled that the agreement
shortchanged investors in Perelman-controlled licorice maker M&amp;F
Worldwide Corp. M&amp;F's board bought Perelman's Panavision shares for
$128 million in April 2001. Strine said the amount of the settlement
wasn't enough to justify dropping the suits.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court asked the U.S. government for its view on a ruling
that dismissed Canada's civil racketeering lawsuit accusing R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. and its affiliates of smuggling
billions of cigarettes to avoid paying taxes.</LD>
<LD>   A U.S. appeals court upheld the dismissal of the lawsuit, which
alleged the defendants tried to defraud Canada of tax revenue in the
early 1990s with a scheme that shipped Canadian cigarette brands to
the United States and then smuggled them back to Canada.</LD>
<LD>   The appellate decision declared that Canada's case represented an
impermissible effort to use U.S. courts to collect foreign taxes.</LD>

<LD>U.S. existing-home sales set a record in the first quarter, and
prices rose 8% from a year earlier, helped by low mortgage rates and
a limited supply of new homes, the National Assn. of Realtors said.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of previously owned single-family homes rose to an annual
pace of 6.54 million units, beating the record of 6.11 million set in
the first quarter of 2001. The median existing-home price rose to
$150,900 from $139,700 a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest price increase was in the Nassau-Suffolk region on
Long Island in New York, where the median rose 26.5% to $287,000. The
median in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area rose 17.7% to $265,000.</LD>
<TE>   The most expensive market was the Bay Area, with a median of
$482,300, followed by Orange County at $372,000.</TE>

<LD>Toyota Motor Corp.'s fiscal second-half profit rose a
better-than-expected 4.2% to a record, as the world's largest auto
maker by market value sold more cars in the U.S. and gained from a
weaker yen and lower costs.</LD>
<LD>   Net income for the six months ended March 31 climbed to $2.55
billion.</LD>
<LD>   Toyota joins Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. in posting
record earnings for the fiscal year just ended. All three grabbed
U.S. market share from rivals, including Ford Motor Co., helped by
sales of profitable light trucks and the weaker yen.</LD>
<TE>   In the U.S., the source of about 70% of its profit, Toyota's
market share topped 10% for the first time, propelled by demand for
light trucks such as the Highlander.</TE>

<HD>Even High-Income Young Save Less</HD>
<DH>Money: Their financial attitudes differ greatly from those
of older Americans with smaller incomes, survey shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Younger Americans with larger incomes and college education still
save less when compared with older Americans with smaller incomes,
according to a report that examines a Federal Reserve survey of U.S.
household wealth.</LD>
<LD>   More than a quarter of all American households have net assets of
less than $10,000, said a report released Monday by the Consumer
Federation of America and the Credit Union National Assn.</LD>
<LD>   In general, these Americans with little or negative financial
assets tended to be young, have low or moderate incomes and rent, not
own, their homes.</LD>
<TE>   The group also tends to have different financial attitudes than
other Americans, Consumer Federation of America Executive Director
Stephen Browbeck said.</TE>
<TE>   They tend to plan for the next few months rather than for at least
five years and to spend more than their incomes, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They not only cannot cover major emergency expenditures without
borrowing, they probably cannot afford to buy a house, pay for an
education or start a business," Browbeck said.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, about 42% of American households had net assets of at
least $100,000, according to the 1998 Federal Reserve Survey of
Consumer Finances.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 5% of American households had net assets of at least
$1million.</TE>
<TE>   The report used the term "wealth-poor" to define affluence and
poverty not just by income, but by wealth, or assets, as well.</TE>
<TE>   It found that wealth-poor Americans divided into two major groups,
the under-35 households with moderate incomes and the older
households with smaller salaries.</TE>
<TE>   But the majority of the group who had negative assets, or debt,
were under 35. They also had an annual income of at least $25,000 and
at minimum some college education.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast the Americans who had small savings tended to be black
or Latino households made up of people over 35 who had less education
and smaller incomes.</TE>
<TE>   The younger group, who had average debt of about $15,000, also
were more inclined to take financial risk when saving or investing,
and more likely to spend more than their income, compared with the
second group, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The data show the need to teach young people more about saving,
said Dan Mica, chief executive of the Credit Union National Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to redirect thinking, to educate young people
particularly on the miracle of compound interest," Mica said.</TE>
<TE>   "They can indeed, with just a little bit of savings, have the
funds to educate children, buy a home, to retire."</TE>
<TE>   But economist Keith Leggett said the information should not be
viewed as alarming.</TE>
<TE>   The report is consistent with life-cycle models of economic
theory, he said.</TE>
<TE>   People under 35 are borrowing against future earnings, Leggett
said.</TE>
<TE>   "A great number of people under 35, they've gone to college, they
probably have student loans and they're trying to set up their
households," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people wondered if the baby boomers were ever going to
save," said the American Bankers Assn. senior economist. "What we now
see is baby boomers are savers."</TE>

<HD>Sears Says It Will Buy Lands' End</HD>
<DH>Retail: The department store chain is offering $1.9 billion
in cash for the upscale brand to help boost its lagging apparel
division.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. said Monday that it will acquire Lands' End Inc.
for $1.9 billion in cash, adding the direct-to-consumer retailer's
classic apparel and accessories in a bid to boost Sears'
long-suffering apparel division.</LD>
<LD>   Sears Chief Executive Alan J. Lacy said Lands' End will continue
offering its line of conservative and dependable fashion, luggage and
home furnishings via the Lands' End catalogs and Web site. In
addition, Sears will begin offering select Lands' End items in some
of its 870 department stores by this year's holiday season, with a
full roll-out by fall 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Some analysts cautioned that the purchase could be risky and
pricey. Sears is offering $62 a share for Lands' End stock, a 26%
premium over the 90-day average price of $49.03. This for an upscale
brand that could lose some of its following through an association
with the more moderately priced Sears.</LD>
<TE>   But other analysts were cautiously optimistic, noting that the
more upscale brand, with a clear following, could only help Sears
broaden its appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "Martha Stewart's cachet wasn't lessened by going to Kmart," said
Bernard Sosnick, a retail analyst with Fahnestock &amp; Co. in New York.
"It's a terrific idea; it gives them a very well-established brand
that differentiates Sears from other retailers."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, many discount and moderately priced retailers
have had considerable success adding exclusive national brand names
into their stable of goods. Kmart's biggest success in an otherwise
sinking retail chain has been its Martha Stewart line. Target Corp.
is the only national seller of the Mossimo brand of sportswear.</TE>
<TE>   In separate news Monday, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. said
Sears' Canadian unit will be granted exclusive rights to sell the
homemaking queen's retail products north of the border.</TE>
<TE>   The long-rumored Lands' End deal is Sears' biggest move to revamp
its soft goods, which have lagged behind the company's tools and
appliance sales. Although Sears has been able to woo middle- to
upper-income Americans into its stores for top-of-the-line
appliances, it has had trouble converting those customers into buyers
of higher-margin soft goods, such as clothing and footwear.</TE>
<TE>   Lands' End adds what Lacy calls a "premium" brand, with a
higher-income target customer and strong brand recognition. One of
the company's big hopes is that upper-income customers who already
shop Sears for high-end appliances will add clothing to their
purchases.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a clear objective to improve the relevancy, consistency
and quality of our soft-lines offerings," Lacy said. "The acquisition
of Lands' End represents an important element and step toward
achieving this vision."</TE>
<TE>   Lois Huff, vice president at consulting firm Retail Forward, said
that although the acquisition offers some opportunities for Sears, it
is not a clear-cut winner.</TE>
<TE>   Lands' End goods, at higher prices than many Sears shoppers are
accustomed to, might not tempt Sears' current customers or bring in
new, younger patrons who are used to buying Lands' End products in
catalogs or online.</TE>
<TE>   "The more likely scenario is that you aren't likely to see a
transfer of Lands' End shoppers into Sears," Huff said. "That
customer would have some image issues with transferring their
clothing buying to Sears."</TE>
<TE>   Lands' End, founded in 1963, last year reported revenue of
$1.6billion and has more than 8,300 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Lands' End will maintain its headquarters in Dodgeville, Wis.,
under Chief Executive David Dyer, who also will oversee the Sears
direct-to-consumer business, including catalogs and Sears.com.</TE>
<TE>   Suburban Chicago-based Sears, which last year reported revenue of
more than $41 billion, said the deal will have no material effect on
2002 or 2003 earnings, with an expected revenue gain in 2004. The
company's stock buyback, however, will likely slow from its pace
during the first quarter, when Sears bought back 2.5% of outstanding
shares for a total of $427million.</TE>
<TE>   Shares in Sears rose 19 cents to close at $52 on the New York
Stock Exchange. Lands' End shares gained $10.71 to $61.73, also on
the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Silicon Graphics to Settle Class-Action Suit</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Silicon Graphics Inc., whose computers created images for movies such
as "Shrek," agreed to pay $4 million in cash and 8 million shares
worth $20.7 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that accused the
company of artificially boosting its stock price.</LD>
<LD>   The company had paid 2.4 million shares to the plaintiffs'
attorneys, the New York-based firm Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp;
Lerach. The rest of the stock will be distributed later this year to
shareholders as they are identified, Silicon Graphics said. The terms
of settlement weren't disclosed when the agreement was ratified by a
U.S. district judge in January.</LD>
<LD>   Shareholders in the class-action lawsuit alleged Silicon Graphics
and its directors made false statements in 1997 and 1998 to
artificially increase the price of the company's stock to facilitate
the exchange of a new convertible security for $200 million of
outstanding zero-coupon debentures.</LD>
<TE>   The company's shares rose 9 cents to $2.59 on the Big Board.</TE>

<HD>Rambus Shares Slip on FTC Report</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Trade Commission may sue to bar Rambus Inc., a Los Altos
computer memory-chip designer, from collecting royalties on some
patents.</LD>
<LD>   The company said the FTC staff is investigating allegations it
failed to disclose patent applications while participating in an
industry group that set standards for the technology. The company
also is appealing a federal jury's verdict in a case brought by
Infineon Technologies that it committed fraud in obtaining
memory-chip patents.</LD>
<LD>   Rambus shares slipped 19 cents to $6.41 on Nasdaq, following a
report in USA Today that the FTC was preparing an antitrust lawsuit
against the company.</LD>
<TE>   FTC spokeswoman Cathy MacFarlane declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   John D. Danforth, general counsel for Rambus, said, "We think
there is no case here."</TE>
<TE>   Arguments on the company's appeal in the Infineon case are set for
June 3 before a federal appeals court. Danforth said the FTC should
await that outcome before deciding whether to authorize its staff to
bring a case.</TE>

<HD>Sonicblue Moves to Overturn Court Order</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sonicblue Inc. moved to overturn a court order for it to track users
of its Replay TV digital recording devices and share detailed viewing
data with major studios and television networks, saying the order
would violate privacy rights. Santa Clara-based Sonicblue called the
May 2 order from Central District Court Magistrate Charles Eick
"breathtaking and unprecedented" and said the directive to track what
television viewers watch "violates consumers' privacy rights,
including those guaranteed by the 1st and 4th amendments."</LD>
<LD>   The plaintiffs in the case, including film studios Paramount,
Universal, Walt Disney Co. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., as well as
TV networks CBS, ABC and NBC, have argued that they need the data,
including details on what commercials viewers skip and what files
they transfer across the Internet, to build their copyright
infringement case against Sonicblue. The lawsuit is part of a broader
campaign by the studios, and TV networks to a lesser extent, to
combat what they say is video piracy that costs them billions of
dollars each year in lost sales in advertising and subscription-based
programming.</LD>

<HD>RealNames Shuts Down, Ends Microsoft Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>RealNames Corp. is shutting its alternative naming system for the
Internet after Microsoft Corp. decided to stop incorporating the
system in its Internet Explorer browsers. The decision means that
users who had reached certain Web sites through shortcuts from
RealNames would need to type in the full address or use a search
engine. Users who had typed in Chinese or Japanese addresses may find
their sites unreachable.</LD>
<LD>   The shutdown takes effect June 30, when the partnership between
RealNames and Microsoft ends. RealNames laid off its 83 employees
Friday, though some will serve as consultants during the transition.
Although the RealNames system was designed independent of any
specific browser, it needed a major platform like the Microsoft
browser to allow for users to recognize keywords.</LD>

<HD>S&amp;P 500 to Drop WorldCom, US Airways</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Battered WorldCom Inc. suffered another blow late Monday when
Standard &amp; Poor's said it is dropping the telecom giant from the
blue-chip S&amp;P 500 index.</LD>
<LD>   The news, reported after regular trading ended, sent the stock to
a fresh 10-year low in after-hours trading, where it slid to $1.38.
In regular Nasdaq trading the stock had slumped 14 cents to $1.44.</LD>
<LD>   S&amp;P said it will delete WorldCom from the index at the close of
trading today. S&amp;P said US Airways Group will be kicked out of the
blue-chip index as well today. US Airways, which dropped 62 cents, or
17%, to $2.98 in regular New York Stock Exchange trading, fell to
$2.85 after hours.</LD>
<TE>   S&amp;P said it is deleting the stocks for "lack of representation," a
catch-all term for shares that S&amp;P believes no longer may accurately
represent their industries.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, US Airways (ticker symbol: U) said it may seek
bankruptcy protection. WorldCom (WCOM) has consistently denied it may
file for bankruptcy, but the market has been treating the shares as
if the firm's financial failure is inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   The stocks may face more selling today by institutional investors
that seek to mimic the S&amp;P 500, and thus no longer will be compelled
to hold the shares.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P said it will replace WorldCom and US Airways in the index with
Apollo Group (APOL) and BJ Services (BJS), respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Apollo operates higher-education programs for working adults. Its
units include the University of Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   BJ Services is an oilfield services company.</TE>
<TE>   Apollo shares jumped $1.28 to $36.65 on Nasdaq in regular trading,
then rose to $37.21 after hours. BJ rose 44 cents to $38.36 in
regular NYSE trading, but wasn't active after hours.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS to Retain Philippines Investments</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News, Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As expected, the California Public Employees' Retirement System said
Monday it won't sell off its investments in the Philippines, after
the giant pension fund acknowledged that an initial decision to sell
was tied to erroneous information from a consultant.</LD>
<LD>   The fund's board changed its mind after an April 19 meeting in
Washington in which Philippine finance officials pointed out that
consultant Wilshire Associates had incorrectly found the Philippines
market used a manual system to settle stock trades, not the more
efficient computer system used in the U.S. and many countries.</LD>
<LD>   "It became clear that they were not given credit for their level
of proficiency" in stock clearance, said Mark Anson, chief investment
officer for $151-billion CalPERS.</LD>
<TE>   The fund's staff last month said it would recommend that CalPERS'
trustees rescind the sale decision. The vote came Monday.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS this year tightened standards for investing in emerging
markets. Those standards are based on technical issues, such as
liquidity, and on human rights concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The fund's initial decision to exit the Philippines was a blow to
the nation's image, and could have influenced other U.S. investors.</TE>

<HD>Blazes Rage Across Southland</HD>
<DH>Wildfires: Heat and wind fuel flames from Santa Clarita to
Camp Pendleton. One home is destroyed; two firefighters are hurt.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wildfires raged across thousands of acres in Southern California on
Monday, destroying at least one house in Riverside County, prompting
the evacuations of dozens more homes in Orange County and blackening
hills above the San Fernando Valley and Camp Pendleton Marine base in
San Diego County.</LD>
<LD>   Brisk breezes, 90-degree temperatures and one of the driest years
in history hindered the efforts of the hundreds of firefighters.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of residents grabbed belongings and fled the advancing
flames. In many cases, their exodus was slowed by heavy smoke and
flames that snarled traffic.</LD>
<TE>   The fire in Woodcrest, just south of Riverside, began about 4 p.m.
in a patch of vegetation at the base of a small canyon.</TE>
<TE>   "It just swept up the canyon," said Rick Vogt, a captain at the
California Department of Forestry.</TE>
<TE>   "And when it shot up, it shot up like a blowtorch."</TE>
<TE>   The fire spread quickly to a house and three outbuildings
containing vintage automobiles and motorcycles, burning all four
buildings to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Two people suffered smoke inhalation and were taken to hospitals.
The blaze was controlled before nightfall after charring about three
acres.</TE>
<TE>   A much larger fire erupted in Orange County shortly after 2 p.m.
in Rancho Santa Margarita and spread rapidly to the north and east,
scorching more than 1,100 acres within six hours. At least 200 homes
were briefly threatened in the exclusive Wagon Wheel neighborhood
near Coto de Caza.</TE>
<TE>   As dusk approached, temperatures dropped and the winds abated. The
efforts of ground crews and water-dropping tanker planes appeared to
be succeeding, and the fire was about 80% contained by 9 p.m. Flames
came within a few feet of some of the Orange County homes, but none
of them burned, said Dave Romano, a spokesman for the Orange County
Fire Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "That's because the homes out there did an excellent job in
preparing for a brush fire: They cleared the brush from within 100
feet of their homes, and what vegetation they did plant is all
greenbelt," Romano said.</TE>
<TE>   The fire spread up the hill, "and that's where we're holding it
off," Trish Sysak, a Fire Authority spokeswoman, said late Monday.
"It got very close."</TE>
<TE>   Mopping perspiration from his grimy face, firefighter Gordon
Levine said: "It's hot and dirty in there. It's black as far as you
can see. The brush is very, very dry."</TE>
<TE>   Sysak said the fire started about 2:45 p.m. in the unincorporated
area of Las Flores, near Antonio Parkway and Meandering Trail. "We
don't know what caused it," she said. "We have our investigators
out."</TE>
<TE>   Two arson investigators placed small blue-and-white flags at three
places about 50 yards apart, across Antonio Parkway from Tijeras
Creek Golf Course. The officials said they are considering the
possibility that somebody set fires at each spot.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation officials closed about two miles of the Foothill
toll road, as well as Antonio Parkway from Tijeras Creek to
Meandering Trail and Oso Parkway at various points. "Traffic is being
diverted," said Officer Mark Reeves of the California Highway Patrol.
"There's a big traffic jam off Antonio Parkway."</TE>
<TE>   Abriana Valentine, 20, watched nervously from her window as fire
approached within four miles of her Rancho Santa Margarita apartment.
Her mother had already made arrangements for the family to stay the
night in a hotel, and the two planned what to take with them should
the fire shift and they be ordered to evacuate.</TE>
<TE>   "We have it planned so we know where we will go and what we will
do," she said.</TE>
<TE>   From the apartment window, Valentine saw layers of thick, black
smoke and little else. "You can't see the sky at all. It's all
smoke," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Moreno, 41, watched the fire burn to within 500 yards of his
large home on Coto de Caza Drive. "It is literally in front of our
balcony," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Moreno remained calm. "I had a house burn down in one of these
firestorms. This is not a firestorm like I have seen in the past."</TE>
<TE>   The largest blaze, which blackened 4,500 acres in the Angeles
National Forest north of Santa Clarita, was nearly contained Monday
after an intense three-day air and ground battle. At its peak, more
than 1,000 federal, state and local firefighters battled the blaze
that began Saturday morning in Bouquet Canyon and quickly burned east
and south.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was 70% contained by Monday night after hand crews, aided
by bulldozers, steered the flames into an area charred by a
3,000-acre October brush fire, said Capt. Brian Jordon of the Los
Angeles County Fire Department. Full containment was expected by
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Two minor injuries were reported: One firefighter suffered a cut
arm and another sustained a first-degree burn, Jordan said. He said
the fire destroyed an outhouse and a shed.</TE>
<TE>   A brush fire continued to burn Monday night in the northeast
corner of Camp Pendleton after incinerating more than 1,000 acres of
brush. Officials predicted full control by dawn today.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the fires could be a harbinger of what may be one
of the most dangerous fire seasons in years.</TE>
<TE>   Rainfall totals in some locations are 11 inches below normal, and
meteorologists said the Southland could have its driest season in
history.</TE>
<TE>   In a normal year, the fire season starts in June and runs through
year's end. But some Southern California agencies, including the
Forest Service, declared the season underway in mid-April.</TE>

<HD>D.A. to Seek Discipline Files of Police</HD>
<DH>Trials: Under a new policy, prosecutors will ask for a
review of personnel records, and a judge will decide what is to be
disclosed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY and JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Staking out new duties for prosecutors, Los Angeles County Dist.
Atty. Steve Cooley decided Monday that his office will take the lead
role in obtaining the disciplinary records of police officers who are
scheduled to testify in criminal cases.</LD>
<LD>   The new policy calls for creation of a computer databank with
information that might cast doubt on an officer's credibility.
Cooley's "special directive" issued Monday requires prosecutors who
become suspicious to formally request a review of any officer's
personnel files.</LD>
<LD>   When officers with a history of misconduct are needed in court,
Cooley directed his prosecutors to ask judges to decide what
information will be disclosed to the defense.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a good deal of interest throughout California in what
L.A. County is doing" because few other counties have such policies
or databanks, said Larry Brown, executive director of the California
District Attorneys Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Barbara district attorney's office has established a
databank, but police representatives have sued, claiming it violates
their privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction from defense lawyers ranged from praise to strong
denunciation.</TE>
<TE>   "They're knuckling under to the police union," said Deputy Public
Defender Mark Harvis, referring to the union's traditional resistance
to opening up police personnel files. "The databank is not a big
breakthrough ... because the amount of information in it will be so
limited and very restrictive."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Gigi Gordon said the policy "does not go far
enough," but she said she is still impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's revolutionary that they did anything," Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   A top LAPD officer called it a positive step.</TE>
<TE>   The policy seeks to quiet long-running disputes between the
district attorney's office and defense lawyers over what information
prosecutors must turn over under state and federal laws that require
prosecutors to reveal information that may help the defendant.</TE>
<TE>   Going back to the 1991 Christopher Commission report, which
addressed LAPD problems after the beating of Rodney King, police have
resisted efforts to reveal disciplinary histories, while civil
libertarians have generally called for greater disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, authorities determined that part of the
disciplinary record of Rafael Perez, the convicted drug thief at the
center of the Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart controversy,
had not been disclosed and was not used to impeach him when he
testified in cases before the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Would Not Have Prevented Rampart</TE>
<TE>   Erwin Chemerinsky, a USC law professor, said the new policy would
not have prevented the Rampart Division scandal. Officers were caught
lying in court, planting evidence and committing other misdeeds in
Rampart's anti-gang unit.</TE>
<TE>   "It might have helped expose Rampart sooner by bringing to light
... the [officers'] disciplinary records," Chemerinsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley's predecessor, Gil Garcetti, proposed a databank during his
last few months in office, prompting a lawsuit by the Police
Protective League that claimed it violated police privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley killed Garcetti's databank idea shortly after he took
office in December 2000, and formed a committee of prosecutors,
police officers and a representative of defense lawyers, including
Gordon, to devise the new policy. Gordon dropped off that committee
several months ago.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the onus is on defense lawyers to seek information
from an officer's personnel file if they suspect those records
contain information that would raise questions about the officer's
credibility. In such cases, the Police Department is required to
submit the personnel file to the judge, who reviews it and determines
what information should be disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Under Cooley's policy, the judge will still do that.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors will take a lead role, although they will not be
allowed to rummage through police personnel files.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever prosecutors suspect a police witness' personnel file may
contain information that could help the defendant, they formally
request the police agency to search the officers' records for such
material. If the agency finds data helpful to the defense,
prosecutors will be required to file a formal motion in court asking
that the police agency be ordered to provide the file for review by a
judge.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Deputy Chief Michael Bostic called the policy "a step in the
right direction." But he said it leaves some questions unanswered,
and may raise others.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD has some 9,000 officers, and their personnel records are
kept confidential. So it's unclear how prosecutors would know when
they needed to seek additional information, Bostic said.</TE>
<TE>   The department has restricted the duties of officers whose court
testimony might be vulnerable to challenges. The officers affected
were chiefly those with disciplinary histories that involved perjury
or falsification of documents. They were taken out of jobs that
required them to make arrests, to ensure their disciplinary records
did not jeopardize prosecutions. That policy has been highly
controversial within the LAPD, and was criticized by the officers
union. It is also the subject of an ongoing lawsuit against the
department.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley's new directive also requires prosecutors to ask the judge
to issue orders forbidding the defense from sharing any disclosed
information with other lawyers, or use it in any other case.</TE>
<TE>   Value of Information Limited, Attorney Says</TE>
<TE>   Harvis, who is an appellate attorney for the public defender's
office, said that provision severely limits the value of the
databank.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he said, the databank will unnecessarily exclude most
complaints filed against an officer unless the evidence in the
complaint meets an extremely high standard of proof.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new policy, disciplinary information will not be used
unless the police agency or the district attorney's office determines
the evidence against the officer is "clear and convincing," a legal
standard just below the reasonable doubt guideline juries must use in
determining the guilt or innocence of a defendant in a trial.</TE>
<TE>   Harvis said most defense lawyers will not rely on Cooley's
directive because the policy allows prosecutors in many cases to
decide when confidential information will be sought.</TE>

<HD>37 Blame Illness on Fumes in Workplace</HD>
<DH>Health: L.A. Unified awaits test results for employees at
office who filed for workers' comp.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly a third of the employees in a subdistrict headquarters for the
Los Angeles city schools have filed workers' compensation claims
because of repeated exposure to solvent fumes from an adjacent print
shop.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Unified School District officials are awaiting results
of tests to determine how badly the 37 workers were exposed at the
Boyle Avenue building on the Eastside.</LD>
<LD>   A workers' compensation doctor who examined the employees observed
symptoms consistent with a solvent exposure in most of them, said
Angelo Bellomo, director of the district's Office of Environmental
Health and Safety.</LD>
<TE>   The solvent was not identified.</TE>
<TE>   The symptoms included respiratory problems such as dry cough and
lightheadedness, Bellomo said.</TE>
<TE>   Lab tests, however, did not show levels that would be expected to
have long-term effects on health.</TE>
<TE>   The workers' compensation filings streamed in about the same time
the district's internal auditors warned that workers' compensation
costs are rising dramatically because of poor attention to injury
prevention, fragmented tracking of cases and poor internal
communications.</TE>
<TE>   Inspector General Don Mullinax said in the April 22 report that
the district's annual losses had climbed steadily through the 1990s,
hitting $100 million in 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   The chemical exposure also illustrates how difficult it is for the
district to find suitable space in Los Angeles--for administrative
functions as well as schools.</TE>
<TE>   The Subdistrict H office is at the back of a Verizon Information
Services industrial complex and shares a building with a print shop
that produces the Yellow Pages.</TE>
<TE>   Workers' complaints began almost immediately after the district
office opened in October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Verizon has made modifications to the air-conditioning
system that seemed to lessen the odors.</TE>
<TE>   District inspectors took air samples at the site several times.</TE>
<TE>   However, they detected no solvent traces that would trigger
intervention from environmental health regulators, Bellomo said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, however, the odors became unbearable for some workers
when the air-conditioning system malfunctioned.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very noticeable as soon as you walk in the door," said Luz
Cotto, a coordinator in the district's secondary literacy program.</TE>
<TE>   Cotto said she had an allergic reaction that made her sneeze and
cough, gave her a headache and caused a burning sensation in her
throat.</TE>
<TE>   She went home.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to leave," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Another worker, Robert Drake, said he wasn't bothered and
continued to work.</TE>
<TE>   But Bellomo, who came to the site in person after a worker called
the South Coast Air Quality Management District, said he was "shocked
at how bad the problem was."</TE>
<TE>   The district then convened an all-hands meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Officials provided workers' compensation forms and offered the
employees consultations with a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 37 workers who filed claims, only one has been given the OK
to return to work, Subdistrict H Supt. Bonnie Rubio said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve others remain home on the doctor's orders and five have
returned to work against the doctor's advice.</TE>
<TE>   Nineteen are on field assignments outside the building.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon officials referred questions to its corporate
communications office in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Spokeswoman DeAnna Kriege said that the company works hard to
maintain a clean shop.</TE>
<TE>   She said that it has easily passed inspections by the South Coast
Air Quality Management District and the California Division of
Occupational Health and Safety.</TE>
<TE>   A March inspection by the division found that the concentrations
of regulated chemicals in the area where Verizon workers use solvents
to clean the presses were only about half the maximum levels allowed,
Kriege said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bellomo said, inspectors from his office who visited the
site over the last two years had failed to take into account the
subjective nature of human chemical reactions.</TE>
<TE>   Many people could be bothered or even injured by low-level
exposure to chemicals that others can tolerate and that would meet
the regulatory standard for an industrial setting, Bellomo said</TE>
<TE>   Just the fact that so many people reacted, Bellomo said, "is
highly suggestive it does not provide the kind of environment that
office workers expect, unless they work for a print shop."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ashokkumar L. Jain, a USC occupational toxicologist, said
solvent exposures can have immediate effects from forgetfulness and
irritability to long-term health troubles including balance problems
and cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The reactions depend on the types of chemicals and amount of
exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Jain said he has seen circumstances in which workers outside a
plant had higher exposures than those actually working with the
chemicals because the exhaust system was moving the vapors in their
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Bellomo said he expects to give employees the results of the
toxicological tests later this week.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, he is still considering whether he will recommend
moving the headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm close to that decision, but I'm not there yet," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The odors, even if not at a toxicological level, are unacceptable,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rubio said she has worked with Verizon to try to solve the problem
rather than recommend a move elsewhere because she believes that most
employees want to stay put.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they want to stay here," Rubio said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good location," she said. "We are near our schools. We
feel it serves our purpose. "</TE>
<TE>   The location provides plenty of parking and floor space, which is
tough to find in the crowded area.</TE>

<HD>State to Rule on Pleas for Redesign of Planned Gold Line
Crossings</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Safety changes sought by residents may
delay light rail, set to open in 2003.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Running smack down the middle of Pasadena's Foothill Freeway are
scores of new power lines and two sets of freshly laid rail track. A
mile south, a 24-foot-wide tunnel slinks under a shopping district.
In Los Angeles' Mount Washington neighborhood, a cement platform
rises, one day to be flooded with train riders.</LD>
<LD>   All along a nearly 14-mile stretch from downtown Los Angeles to
Pasadena are signs that a long-sought light rail line, considered one
of the region's transit priorities, is nearly completed.</LD>
<LD>   But even as work continues six days a week, the fate of the
railway known as the Gold Line stands in doubt.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, the five-member Public Utilities Commission, which
oversees California's rail safety, is to rule on the design of
several controversial intersections on the route.</TE>
<TE>   Approving the design would grant legal right of way for completion
of the rail line--expected, shortly after a July 2003 opening, to
send as many as 250 trains and 38,000 riders a day through dense
neighborhoods. Plans are underway to eventually extend the line all
the way to Claremont.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if the commission asks for the most aggressive of the safety
changes it is considering, transit experts say, it may take a decade
or more for trains to run on the Gold Line, mainly because there is
little money available to alter the intersections.</TE>
<TE>   That would be a major setback for transit planners--and thousands
of hopeful residents--who have waited for the railway since at least
1980, when funding was first made available. They envision the Gold
Line whisking riders end-to-end in about 30 minutes, part of a
blueprint to ease congestion in Los Angeles by getting more riders on
a rail network that is sprouting from downtown in all directions.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been sleeping well, thinking about this, reading all of
the material," said PUC President Loretta Lynch, who would not say
how she will vote. "I'm completely for the building of the Gold Line,
but we have to build it in the safest way."</TE>
<TE>   The commission is making its decision late in the game because the
Los Angeles to Pasadena Metro Construction Authority, the contractor
established by the state in 1988 to build the Gold Line, failed to
get proper approval before starting construction. Rick Thorpe, the
authority's chief executive, says such methods are duplicated by rail
builders across the state, a claim confirmed by the PUC. Still, he
recognizes it was a gamble that may end up backfiring.</TE>
<TE>   In the past month, the commission has received conflicting
opinions from a variety of official sources and interested parties,
including an administrative law judge hired by the PUC to hold
hearings and make recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Among the commission's options:</TE>
<TE>   * It could green-light the railway with slight
modifications--calling for measures such as the slowdown of trains
and a partial ban on horn blowing, particularly near residences in
Mount Washington, where an elementary school, businesses and homes
often sit feet from track.</TE>
<TE>   * It could call for trains to travel in a trench underneath Del
Mar Boulevard, the busiest street on the trip, where trains will
travel through a soon-to-be-constructed apartment complex, a
structure that some say poses risks by blocking views of the trains
from the street. Such a move could delay the project by two to three
years.</TE>
<TE>   * Or it could call for more radical surgery: forcing the builder
into a massive redesign of four intersections spread out over five
miles. That aggressive a move would put a near foolproof guarantee of
safety at those locations above the goals of light rail: a belief
that placing commuter trains on streets is the most cost-effective
way to ease congestion, at about 40% of the cost of subways.</TE>
<TE>   If the PUC decides on the more radical approach, the cost of the
fixes would be close to $80 million. Operating under a tightly
planned budget of $451 million, Thorpe and others argue that it could
take 10 years or more to come up with the money, then redesign and
rebuild the line at those intersections.</TE>
<TE>   People living near those streets, anticipating the decision, say
the sudden mix of official opinions is fraying nerves. Some of
them--residents of Pasadena, Highland Park and Mount Washington
mostly--have diligently fought for changes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard enough just waiting around for Thursday ... [but now]
it feels like we're on a roller coaster," said Sue Baldwin, a
paralegal who is part of a group in the canyon-like Los Angeles
neighborhood of Mount Washington worried about not only safety, but
also noise pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "We just don't know what to think," said Karen Cutts, founder of a
group opposing trains running on streets just south of Pasadena's
bustling Old Town, a popular shopping strip that is currently one of
two tunneled portions of the railway. "It's still a David versus
Goliath struggle."</TE>
<TE>   Cutts' stance was given a huge lift this month by Judge Sheldon
Rosenthal, the administrative law judge hired by the PUC to run
hearings and come up with a recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   In a 34-page opinion, Rosenthal focused mostly on Del Mar
Boulevard. He worried that the crossing would be a hazard because of
the limited sight lines, and was not convinced of the effectiveness
of the railway's four-armed crossing gates, specially designed to
keep cars from trying to beat trains across the track. "We find that
an at-grade crossing at Del Mar Boulevard will not be safe," he
wrote, arguing that the railway should be forced underground.</TE>
<TE>   Responses, rebuttals and addendums, some taking direct aim at
Rosenthal's stance, have since flooded in to the PUC.</TE>
<TE>   The most important dissenting view came from PUC Commissioner
Henry Duque, who unlike Rosenthal represents one of the five deciding
votes. He said the line is safe as designed, calling only for some
speed restrictions in addition to having trains not sound their horns
in Mount Washington. Thorpe's building authority said nothing should
change. The MTA, which will run the trains, originally echoed Thorpe.
Then on Monday, the agency backed off its protest against proposed
noise and speed limits at Mount Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC's rail safety staff argued for the most intrusive,
costly--and safest--approach. Last week, they decided Del Mar and two
crossings in Mount Washington should be built below ground or on
bridges. One crossing in South Pasadena was denied as currently
designed.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Friday in Los Angeles, Lynch said she was most
concerned that pedestrians at the Del Mar crossing will find ways to
walk around the traffic gates, a sight she said that happens
frequently on rail tracks near her San Francisco home. Lynch said she
thought the line could be engineered to connect with an underground
parking structure, larger than two football fields, already being
built at the apartment complex.</TE>
<TE>   "This has to be a well-considered decision, because the line is so
important, for the entire state," said Lynch. "If we run into
problems and accidents down the line, the prospects for similar
projects could be hurt. And that's not something we can really
afford."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Officials Float Plan to Pay for Hotel Downtown</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unable to persuade a developer to build a hotel considered vital to
the success of the city convention center, Los Angeles officials
proposed Monday that they create a nonprofit corporation to pay for
the $280-million project.</LD>
<LD>   In a report to the City Council, Chief Legislative Analyst Ron
Deaton proposed that the corporation issue tax-exempt bonds to
finance construction and use revenue generated by the 1,200-room
hotel to pay off the debt.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate report recently delivered to the council, a
consultant estimated that the City Redevelopment Agency would be
required to pay about $67 million in subsidies if the hotel project
is approved by the City Council. Others say the subsidies could reach
$80 million. The money would come from hotel bed taxes, property
taxes or sales taxes generated by the hotel.</LD>
<TE>   The reports detailing the city's potential involvement in the
hotel project touched off a debate over its role in developing
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council considers the hotel vital to reversing the
fortunes of the convention center, which has lost business because of
a lack of hotels within walking distance. Some council members
support the city taking a lead role in the project; others have
expressed misgivings about public subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel is part of a large redevelopment project that the
council approved last week. It will come before the council again
Wednesday for final approval. Separate actions would be needed to
create the nonprofit corporation or to provide any subsidies to the
hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed hotel would be built at the southeast corner of
Olympic Boulevard and Georgia Street. Under Deaton's plan, the new
nonprofit would be called the Downtown Revitalization Corp. and would
contract with a hotel firm to run the business on a day-to-day basis.</TE>
<TE>   "The city believes that the lack of hotel accommodations within
walking distance severely undermines efforts to attract conventions,"
city representatives said in a letter to the Internal Revenue
Service, asking for approval of the nonprofit.</TE>
<TE>   A February 1999 report by PKF Consulting found that over a
three-year period, 70 groups representing 1million hotel room nights
did not choose Los Angeles because of the lack of a hotel adjacent to
the convention center.</TE>
<TE>   City officials, businesspeople and economists said a convention
center hotel is key to rehabilitating blighted areas of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "It will take the revitalization of downtown to another level by
bringing brand-new jobs for people who are unskilled into the
downtown area," said Councilwoman Jan Perry, whose district includes
the hotel site. Without a private developer in sight, Perry said, the
city ought to step up and get the hotel built. "If that was going to
happen, it would have happened already," she said. "Obviously, it's
not going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Private developers have been uninterested in the project because
convention center hotels are expensive to build and offer amenities,
such as large conference rooms, that don't provide a steady return on
the investment. Also, the Los Angeles market has been soft, with
existing hotels having trouble filling their rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn declined to comment on Deaton's plan, saying
through a representative that his office needs to analyze the
proposal. However, others questioned the wisdom of the city getting
into the hotel business, even in an indirect way.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absurd," said Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Assn. "We have a situation where private capital has looked
at a situation and decided not to invest, and now the public sector's
response to that is 'Let's have the public sector do it.' "</TE>
<TE>   He was not moved by the argument that the hotel is necessary to
stem the flow of red ink at the convention center. "Does the phrase
'throwing good money after bad' mean anything?" Coupal asked.</TE>
<TE>   Others said the revitalization of downtown Los Angeles is a public
good that justifies the city's getting involved in a hotel project.</TE>
<TE>   "The convention center has hemorrhaged money for a number of
years, and that amounts to a loss of a lot of revenue that Los
Angeles could use to fund all kinds of city services," said Mara
Marks, associate director of the Center for the Study of Los Angeles
at Loyola Marymount University.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel would be built as part of a sports and entertainment
district that the City Council tentatively approved in September for
the developers of Staples Center. When they outlined their plans for
restaurants, theaters and other attractions, the developers told the
council they had no interest in building the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed hotel site is on 2.7 acres that the City
Redevelopment Agency helped purchase as part of the Staples Center
project and gave to the Staples builders. It is currently being used
for parking.</TE>
<TE>   With the Staples developers and other private firms unwilling to
build the hotel alone, Deaton has proposed that a nonprofit
corporation be set up and run by a board including city
representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike a private developer, a nonprofit board can issue tax-exempt
bonds for construction, which can save up to 2% on financing charges,
or millions of dollars over the life of the project.</TE>
<TE>   The City Charter prohibits the city from directly issuing
tax-exempt bonds, as other cities have done, for construction of a
hotel, Deaton wrote to the council, explaining why a nonprofit
corporation is proposed. That would also protect the city general
fund from liability if the hotel goes bust, officials said. The
corporation will own the hotel until the bonds are paid off, possibly
25 years, and can sell it afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Although Deaton's report says that setting up the corporation does
not commit the city to any subsidies, the accompanying letter to the
IRS said one analysis found that the hotel might generate $77million
in revenue the first year against $60million in expenses. The
$17million in profit would not be enough to cover the $31.9-million
debt service payment the first year, although the gap shrinks in
later years.</TE>
<TE>   The PKF report estimated that the project would require a total of
$67 million in subsidies, although some city officials said privately
this week it might require $80 million. The report was sent to the
council last week as part of the new redevelopment proposal.</TE>
<TE>   PKF indicated that potential sources of the subsidies include the
hotel's property tax, which will be about $2.8 million a year; its
hotel bed tax, which would be $6.3 million annually; the sales tax it
generates, which would be $2.2 million; and the parking tax of
$196,600.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in several other cities, including Austin, Texas;
Houston; Myrtle Beach, S.C.; and Chicago, have used public financing
on convention center hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss said he is opposed to subsidies for the
hotel and needs to hear more details about the corporation to make
sure the city is fully protected. "My overall concern is that such a
project not cost the city any money," Weiss said. "I don't want it to
cost the city money upfront, and I don't want to set up a scenario
where, if we hit hard economic times, the city is left holding the
bag."</TE>

<HD>Radke Is Injured in Twins' Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>As soon as David Ortiz comes off Minnesota's disabled list, Brad
Radke pulls up lame.</LD>
<LD>   The Minnesota Twins survived the injury to their starting pitcher
Monday night, beating Kansas City, 3-2, when Ortiz doubled home the
tiebreaking run in the eighth in his first game back.</LD>
<LD>   The American League Central-leading Twins seem to be having more
than their share of injuries. They've had six players go on the
disabled list.</LD>
<TE>   "Our team's cursed with injuries," said Radke, who pulled his
right groin while throwing a changeup in the second inning.</TE>
<TE>   "We can just try to overcome it. There's nothing you can say about
injuries."</TE>
<TE>   Radke did not come out for the third inning after throwing 19
pitches and giving up only a bunt single.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, he'll just miss one start," Manager Ron Gardenhire
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz, who sat out 18 games following surgery to remove a bone
chip in his left knee, was one for four. After Jason Grimsley (1-2)
walked Doug Mientkiewicz in the eighth, the Twins' cleanup hitter
doubled off the wall in right-center field for what proved to be the
winning run.</TE>
<TE>   "The knee didn't bother me at all," Ortiz said. "It feels fine.
When I went on the DL and had to stay home and just watch the games
on TV, it was really frustrating. But it just made me work harder to
get back."</TE>
<TE>   J.C. Romero (3-0) pitched 22/3 innings of one-hit relief for the
victory that put the Twins ahead of the Royals in the all-time
series, 241-240.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Guardado worked a perfect ninth for his league-leading 13th
save in 13 opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   The loss dropped the Royals to 0-7 in one-run games.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that stat going into the game. About the sixth inning, I
told someone we're 0-6 so it's about time we won a one-run game,"
Royal interim Manager John Mizerock said.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't happen. This early in the year, I'd say it's a
coincidence."</TE>
<TE>   The Royals were trying for their first four-game winning streak
since Aug. 9-12.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>DaVanon May Open Things Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In spring training, Jeff DaVanon won a roster spot because he could
play all the outfield positions, pinch-run and contribute some power
to a bench otherwise without any. After he hit .167 in 30 at-bats,
the Angels sent him to the minor leagues to find his batting stroke.
If and when the Angels recall him, he figures to fill the same major
league role.</LD>
<LD>   But DaVanon has played center field in each of his 10 games at
triple-A Salt Lake City, abusing Pacific Coast League pitching in the
process. Since a concussion has not stopped Angel center fielder
Darin Erstad from diving for balls and slamming into walls, the
Angels could consider preserving Erstad's well-being while keeping
his bat in the lineup by moving him to first base and putting DaVanon
in center field.</LD>
<LD>   "That option for this club is there," Manager Mike Scioscia said.
"You want to have as many options as you can. But it's not something
we're considering right now. We're very pleased with the way we're
doing things right now, and Darin in center field is a big part of
that."</LD>
<TE>   Scioscia said DaVanon would play the other outfield positions
during his time with Salt Lake. DaVanon is hitting .400 with a .519
on-base percentage and an .875 slugging percentage. He hit his fourth
home run Sunday in the Stingers' 19-2 victory over Edmonton, a game
in which designated hitter Robb Quinlan tied a franchise record by
driving in eight runs.</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake pitcher Mickey Callaway, whose success as a starter
would not preclude the Angels from calling him up to help in their
bullpen if necessary, is 7-0 with a 1.47 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel closer Troy Percival has been virtually untouchable since
giving up a three-run homer to Oakland's Greg Myers on April 21. In
eight subsequent innings, all scoreless, he has given up two hits and
struck out 14. He has posted two victories and four saves in that
span, shrinking his ERA from 21.60 to 3.72.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whistle while you work: With the Angels having won 14 of their
last 16 games, optimism is running rampant in the clubhouse--and in
the front office too. The Rolling Stones will play Edison Field on
Nov. 2 and as he announced the concert booking in a staff meeting
last week, Kevin Uhlich, senior vice president for business
operations, smiled broadly.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like we're in for a busy fall," Uhlich told front-office
employees. "First the World Series, then the Stones."</TE>

<HD>Canseco Calls It a Career</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former American League most valuable player Jose Canseco announced
his retirement Monday, 38 home runs shy of the 500 mark, which he
wanted to reach to help his chances for induction in the Hall of
Fame.</LD>
<LD>   Canseco, 37, signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White
Sox on April 18. He was batting .172 with five home runs and nine
runs batted in at triple-A Charlotte.</LD>
<LD>   "Jose felt that because of personal reasons and a strong desire on
his part to spend more quality time with his young daughter, it was
time to announce his retirement," Alan Nero, Canseco's agent, said in
a statement released by the White Sox.</LD>
<TE>   Canseco's surprise decision leaves him with 462 home runs, 22nd on
the career list, three behind Dave Winfield.</TE>
<TE>   A career .266 hitter, Canseco finishes with 1,407 RBIs and 200
stolen bases in 1,887 games with Oakland, Texas, Boston, Toronto,
Tampa Bay, the New York Yankees and the White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Canseco, born in Cuba and reared in Miami, is one of nine players
with 400 homers and 200 stolen bases.</TE>
<TE>   He hit 33 homers and drove in 117 runs in 1986, and was selected
AL rookie of the year.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, he led the majors with 42 home runs and 124 RBIs, and was
a unanimous choice as MVP. He became the first player to hit 40 home
runs and steal 40 bases.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston's Manny Ramirez doesn't need surgery on the broken left
index finger that will sideline him at least four weeks, but the
injury will be monitored to see if the fracture spreads.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Met reliever John Franco, out for the season because of
an injured left elbow, has decided to go through with reconstructive
elbow surgery in an attempt to prolong his 18-year career.</TE>

<HD>Mayweather Wary of L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Promoter Bob Arum, angry that he can't get Floyd Mayweather Jr. to
agree to a title rematch against Jose Luis Castillo at Staples
Center, has made today the deadline for Mayweather to change his
mind. Arum, who had planned on holding the fight Aug. 10 at Staples
Center, insists that if Mayweather doesn't budge, he will reschedule
the match for the fall in Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   According to Arum, Mayweather doesn't want to fight in Los Angeles
because he doesn't trust the judges and doesn't want to fight in
front of a crowd that figures to be largely Latino, which would favor
Castillo.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't make any sense of what he is thinking," Arum said. "He
doesn't know what he is doing. He's got morons around him that have
convinced him that fighting in L.A. is like fighting in Mexico. I
don't know if he'll change his mind. Nobody can figure him out."</LD>
<TE>   Arum didn't name the "morons," but specified that he wasn't
referring to James Prince, Mayweather's manager, or Roger Mayweather,
his uncle and trainer.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked Floyd if he trusted the judges in L.A. and he said,
'No,'" Arum said. "I asked him if he trusted the judges in San
Francisco and he said, 'Yeah.' He doesn't even know L.A. and San
Francisco are in the same state."</TE>
<TE>   Mayweather was not available for comment, but Roger Mayweather
confirmed the negotiations are deadlocked.</TE>
<TE>   Mayweather won the World Boxing Council lightweight title from
Castillo last month in Las Vegas in a unanimous decision that was
scored far more one-sided than most ringside observers believed.</TE>
<TE>   The match was to be on pay-per-view from Staples Center, but, Arum
said, if it is switched to Las Vegas, it would be moved to the HBO
network, meaning a smaller purse for Mayweather</TE>
<TE>   Although he says he won't try to change his nephew's mind, Roger
Mayweather could make a good argument for going ahead with a Staples
Center bout based on his experience.</TE>
<TE>   He made a successful career fighting Latino boxers, including
Julio Cesar Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't make any difference to me," Roger said. "I ain't never
been scared to fight anywhere. I never ducked nobody nowhere. I was a
fighter. But he probably feels like he can't get a fair decision in
L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Roger thinks Floyd shouldn't be that concerned about the rematch.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it will be any harder than the first time," Roger
said. "Castillo did the best he can do and Floyd had an injured
rotator cuff."</TE>
<TE>   So why wouldn't Roger make that argument?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not my job tell Floyd where to fight," Roger said. "I'm not
in Floyd's body. I can't say what he thinks. I can't tell him to
fight in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "Me, it wouldn't make any difference, but Floyd has to fight where
he's comfortable."</TE>

<HD>Using Food to Protect Their Meal Tickets</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is often known simply as "the spread," the meal laid out in the
clubhouse for a major league baseball game.</LD>
<LD>   Though it once typically featured hot dogs, pizza or
chicken--that's for you, Wade Boggs--the spread, along with salaries,
has gone uptown.</LD>
<LD>   Shortstop Miguel Tejada of the Oakland Athletics interrupted a
conversation before a recent game to jump up, find a trashcan and
spit out a piece of sushi that didn't sit well with him, the San
Francisco Chronicle reported.</LD>
<TE>   The A's and Giants' spreads have been catered by such restaurants
as MoMo's, Jardiniere, Tarantino's, P.F. Chang's and Hayward Fishery,
and the Chronicle reports that Bay Area clubhouse fare has included
halibut, turkey burgers, crawfish and alligator.</TE>
<TE>   More on the spread: Why the big change? Teams have recognized the
importance of protecting their investments by helping players eat
healthier--and increasingly sophisticated athletes are focused on
maximizing their careers.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more emphasis on it than before," Oakland equipment
manager Steve Vucinich told the Chronicle. "It seems like the
visiting clubhouse managers now are judged on their food service.
When I started it was, 'Did you run a clean clubhouse?' 'Was the
equipment in order and clean?' 'Were you cooperative?' Now it just
seems to be, 'Hey, we're going to Tampa. The guy makes Cuban
sandwiches.'"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Before he was the Mick, Mickey Mantle had another
nickname, born of his Oklahoma hometown. What was it?</TE>
<TE>   Love means letting go: Courtesy of Steve Hummer of the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution: "Those people in Charlotte who paid large money
to watch the Hornets in the postseason are the same ones who, when
they broke up with their girlfriends, not only gave them all the good
albums, but also helped pack them, in alphabetical order."</TE>
<TE>   No kidding: The Hornets' David Wesley wasn't interested in all the
fuss about Jason Kidd lifting New Jersey to victory despite a
battered, swollen eye in Game 4 of the NBA's Eastern Conference
semifinal series.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my God, he got stitches," said Wesley, whose head had
inflicted the damage on Kidd in the previous game. "What did you
expect him to do--limp?"</TE>
<TE>   That's baseball, by gum: The Arizona Republic's Dan Bickley talked
to major leaguers about a hazy memory of their youth, the baseball
card accessory that comes in hard pink rectangles, dusted with
powder.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember that gum," Diamondback pitcher Brian Anderson said.
"It turned to foam in your mouth."</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks' Mark Grace collected cards too.</TE>
<TE>   "You put them in your bicycle spokes so it sounded like you had a
motor," Grace said. "I'm sure I put a few Pete Rose rookie cards in
my spokes and messed them up. But it sounded like I had a motor, so
that was the important thing."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The Commerce Comet.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: All that emphasis on healthier clubhouse food doesn't
mean players don't still order pizza.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm becoming more aware," Giant rookie pitcher Ryan Jensen said.
"Practicing it--I don't really do it. I'm still a junk-food eater.
I'm a big Jack in the Box guy."</TE>

<HD>BBC Line Holds Strong for Carolina</HD>

<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>Carolina didn't want to play a seventh game against the Montreal
Canadiens. The BBC line made sure that didn't happen.</LD>
<LD>   Rookie Erik Cole, the "C" in Carolina's high-scoring line that
also includes Rod Brind'Amour and Bates Battaglia, scored twice in
the first 3 minutes 33 seconds Monday night and the Hurricanes
blitzed Montreal for five first-period goals en route to an 8-2
victory that clinched the best-of-seven playoff series in front of
21,000 at the Molson Centre.</LD>
<LD>   "We said that we wanted to come out and try to get the momentum
right away and take the crowd out of the game, but we never expected
it to be like that," Cole said. "It's just what's been going on the
last couple of games, where we're fortunate to get the bounces."</LD>
<TE>   It was the first victory in six playoff games against the
Canadiens for the franchise, which entered the league in 1979 as the
Hartford Whalers and moved to North Carolina five years ago. Montreal
won two Game 7s of those series with overtime goals.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've taken steps every year," said Carolina captain Ron
Francis, who was Hartford's first choice in the 1981 draft and is in
his second stint with the club. "This year we've taken some big
steps, there's no question. This is the best and deepest team we've
had."</TE>
<TE>   Carolina will make the franchise's first appearance in the
conference finals, against either Toronto or Ottawa. That series is
tied, 3-3, with the seventh game tonight at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's the first time in my career, so it's certainly nice
to be on the winning end against these guys," said Francis, whose
assist on Battaglia's second-period goal gave him a team-record 32
career playoff points, one more than Kevin Dineen.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>After an earthquake shook the Compaq Center, Peter Forsberg's goal 2
minutes 47 seconds into overtime gave the Avalanche a 2-1 victory
over the San Jose Sharks on Monday night and sent the Western
Conference semifinal playoff series back to Colorado for a deciding
Game 7.</LD>
<LD>   The game was marked by a substantial earthquake that shook the
arena with about nine minutes left in the third period.</LD>
<LD>   The sellout crowd of 17,146 was unruffled, apparently more
interested in the tight game on the ice, and play continued
uninterrupted.</LD>
<TE>   Forsberg took a pass from Joe Sakic and beat goalie Evgeni Nabokov
from right in front of the crease. It was Forsberg's sixth goal of
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The defending Stanley Cup champion Avalanche were on the verge of
elimination by the Sharks, who have never been to the Western
Conference finals. The series is tied, 3-3.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Roy stopped 21 San Jose shots. He has given up a
surprising 18 goals during the series against the Sharks.</TE>

<TE>   Phil Mickelson finished 10 strokes back at the Byron Nelson
Classic over the weekend. After two rounds, he had been only three
strokes behind. He was either going to win or finish back in the
pack.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson's aggressive style has gotten him a lot of attention.
Some say that aggressiveness is the reason he has never won a major.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant Gumbel gets Mickelson to talk about it in one of the
segments on this edition of "Real Sports," and Mickelson says the
criticism he gets is largely responsible for the way he plays.</TE>
<TE>   "The type of individual I am, when somebody tells me to do
something, I tend to go the other way," Mickelson says. "So I
actually think that ... some of the criticism that has taken place in
the media about me being aggressive has forced me to be overly
aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to give in to what somebody says. I may even try a
shot that I wouldn't have tried before, just to prove a point."</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson says he's not trying to prove people wrong but rather to
show that he enjoys playing his style of game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm at a point where I really don't care about an eighth-place
finish or a second-place finish," he says. "I want to try to win. I'm
going to take that extra step, that extra gamble, to try to separate
myself from the field. Sometimes it pays off, sometimes it doesn't."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Get Bounce From This Victory</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Reboulet's hit beats Mets in 13th when throw
skips away from Piazza, enabling Karros to score for a 3-2 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeff Reboulet, the forgotten man on the Dodger bench, the utility
player who had one at-bat in the previous 15 games, lined a pinch-hit
RBI single to center field in the bottom of the 13th inning Monday
night, lifting the Dodgers to a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets
before 27,659 in Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Karros started the winning rally with a one-out single to
left and, after Hiram Bocachica struck out, took second on Mark
Corey's wild pitch. Adrian Beltre was walked intentionally, and
Reboulet singled to center.</LD>
<LD>   Timo Perez fielded the ball as Karros rounded third and the center
fielder made a strong throw home, but the ball short-hopped catcher
Mike Piazza and caromed away as Karros slid home with the winning
run.</LD>
<TE>   Dodger right-hander Giovanni Carrara blanked the Mets in the 12th
and 13th innings to gain the win, and left-hander Omar Daal struck
out four in the 10th and 11th innings, buying some time for a Dodger
offense that ranks 14th in the National League in runs.</TE>
<TE>   Daal survived a scare in the 11th when Roger Cedeno singled with
two outs and Timo Perez hammered a high fastball to the warning track
in right, where Shawn Green, who went 0 for 5 and hit into two double
plays, made the inning-ending catch.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers put runners on first and second with two outs in the
bottom of the 10th, but Paul Lo Duca flied to the warning track in
left. They had two on with two out in the 11th, as well, but Met
right-hander Grant Roberts blew a fastball by Alex Cora for strike
three.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger starter Odalis Perez gave up two runs on seven hits in 71/3
innings, the seventh consecutive game he has gone six innings or more
and allowed three earned runs or fewer, raising his National
League-leading earned run average to a mere 1.75. Not since San
Francisco's three-run sixth inning during his Dodger debut on April 4
has Perez given up more than one run in an inning.</TE>
<TE>   He struck out six and walked three, one intentionally, during a
111-pitch performance in which he threw 74 strikes. But Perez, who
has held opponents to a league-low .164 batting average, didn't have
a solution for Met third baseman Edgardo Alfonzo, who doubled and
scored in the fourth and eighth innings.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 2-1, Alfonzo opened the eighth with a drive to deep
right-center, a ball that could have, and probably should have, been
caught but bounced off the glove of sprinting center fielder Marquis
Grissomand fell for a double.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger shortstop Cesar Izturis made a nice play on Roberto
Alomar's grounder up the middle, fielding the ball to the second-base
side of the bag and throwing Alomar out as Alfonzo took third.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy chose to intentionally walk cleanup batter Mike
Piazza, seemingly a wise choice considering Piazza had singled in his
two previous at-bats. But Mo Vaughn, who replaced the injured John
Valentin at first base in the bottom of the fifth, fisted a
full-count pitch into center field for an RBI single and a 2-2 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Orosco replaced Perez and struck out Jeromy Burnitz, and the
Mets loaded the bases when Jay Payton, facing reliever Paul
Quantrill, reached on second baseman Mark Grudzielanek's error. But
Izturis charged Rey Ordonez's slow roller and made a strong throw to
first to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Alfonzo also sparked New York's first run when he doubled to
left-center to open the fourth, took third on Alomar's bunt and
scored on Piazza's single to center.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers didn't exactly throttle Met starter Shawn Estes, a
left-hander who has given them little trouble; he entered with a 3-7
career record and 5.36 ERA against L.A., and six players in Monday's
Dodger lineup--Grissom, Lo Duca, Karros, Brian Jordan, Adrian Beltre
and Grudzielanek--combined for a .393 average (55 for 140) against
Estes.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers had to scratch and claw for the two runs they
scored against him.Both came in the fifth, when Jordan walked, Beltre
singled him to second and Grudzielanek brought him home with a
single. Odalis Perez sacrificed and Beltre scored on Izturis' fly
ball to medium right-center.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are reserve players, and then there is Jeff Reboulet, the
Dodger infielder who seems to play only when the fuel light is
illuminated and the gas gauge is well below empty.</LD>
<LD>   Before Monday, Reboulet had a team-low 12 at-bats, which raises
the question: With the Dodger offense struggling, the bench
contributing little, Alex Cora available to back up shortstop and
second, and Reboulet seeing minimal action, isn't there a player at
triple-A Las Vegas who might offer more than Reboulet is
contributing?</LD>
<LD>   The numbers would indicate as much. Mike Kinkade, who can catch,
play outfield and first base, is batting .382 with six homers and 26
runs batted in, and catcher Todd Greene is batting .339 with 10
homers and 35 RBIs. Both have significant big league experience.</LD>
<TE>   Front-office executives are monitoring the two players, but no
roster moves appear imminent. Reboulet, meanwhile, will try to stay
sharp, which isn't easy when you've had five at-bats since April 14.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I've gone through a couple of slumps already in batting
practice," said Reboulet, who hit .266 with 22 RBIs in 94 games for
the Dodgers last season. "It's a constant battle to keep your timing.
I'm a situational guy, and there haven't been many situations for
me."</TE>
<TE>   Reboulet, 38, didn't play for nine consecutive games before last
Tuesday, when he led off the sixth inning in Atlanta with a pinch-hit
double.</TE>
<TE>   "I put him in dry ice for two weeks, and he leads off with a
double against Tom Glavine," Manager Jim Tracy said. "He hasn't had a
lot of opportunities, but he understands what's going on here, and
he's handled it like the absolute pro he is."</TE>
<TE>   Reboulet rewarded Tracy on Monday, getting a single in the 13th
inning to score Eric Karros in a 3-2 victory over the Mets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Met first baseman Mo Vaughn, acquired from the Angels for pitcher
Kevin Appier in December, is off to a slow start, batting .247 with
two homers and 11 RBIs in 23 games, his season shortened by two weeks
after he went on the disabled list April 6 because of a broken bone
in his right hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting myself out, fouling balls back, swinging through some
balls that I hit real well when I'm right," said Vaughn, who missed
the 2001 season because of a ruptured biceps tendon in his left
elbow. "But the year off hasn't made a difference. I've hit third all
my career, so no one is giving me any cookies. I just have to stay
positive and know that I'm going to do the job."</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn's struggles mirror those of the Mets, who were supposed to
mash the ball this season but entered Monday night's game ranked 11th
in the National League in batting (.241), 10th in runs (154), 12th in
home runs (31) and first in errors (40).</TE>
<TE>   "We've done some things I didn't think we'd do, and some of the
mental mistakes are surprising, considering all the veterans on this
team," Vaughn said. "We have a lot of talent. Does that mean we're
going to win? No. Do we have to focus more? Yes. We've shown signs we
can be a great team, but how consistent we are will determine how
well we'll do."</TE>

he could play tonight. Right fielder Shawn Green (left wrist),

<LD>Moorpark High won a share of the Marmonte League baseball title, but
the Musketeers won't get the chance to play for a Southern Section
championship after getting shut out of the Division II playoffs
Monday when pairings were released.</LD>
<LD>   The rare circumstance was the result of a four-way tie atop the
league standings. Moorpark, Agoura, Newbury Park and Westlake each
posted a 7-5 league record, necessitating the use of tiebreakers,
including a coin flip, to determine the league's three automatic
playoff entrants.</LD>
<LD>   Agoura and Newbury Park received the first and second entries,
respectively, because they had the best records against the other
champions, each going 4-2. Agoura gained the first entry because it
swept Newbury Park in the regular-season series.</LD>
<TE>   That left Westlake and Moorpark, each going 2-4 against the other
champions, for the third entry. Since the teams split their two-game
regular-season games, they flipped a coin Thursday to determine the
third entry, and Westlake won.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark Coach Scott Fullerton still figured his team would make
the playoffs as an at-large entrant and conducted practices over the
weekend. Then he heard Monday that there were no at-large entries in
Division II.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough way to not go in after being a co-champion,"
Fullerton said. "The kids were pretty devastated. I told them,
'Sometimes life isn't fair.'"</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton acknowledged that Moorpark could have avoided the
letdown by winning either of its final two league games. "We had
opportunities that we didn't cash in on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Villa Park pitcher Erik Averill was suspended for the playoffs
after making contact with an umpire in a game last week, Principal
Fran Roney said. Averill has committed to Arizona State....</TE>
<TE>   Defending champions Huntington Beach Edison (Division II) and
Placentia El Dorado (Division III) failed to qualify for the playoffs
after late-season slides. Edison, No. 2 in The Times' preseason
rankings, lost its last four games and six of its last seven with
catcher Cory Vanderhook sidelined by injury. El Dorado dropped three
of its final four games....</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach Marina may be the most tested team in Division II
after winning a two-game playoff last Friday to gain entry into the
postseason. The Vikings (18-10), who play at La Verne Damien (18-7)
in a first-round game Friday, defeated Los Alamitos and Edison to
gain the third-place entry from the Sunset League.</TE>

<HD>Ejections Threaten Sunset League Rivals</HD>

<LD>Flared tempers and an altercation at the end of a softball game last
week between Sunset League rivals Los Alamitos and Anaheim Esperanza
resulted in three ejections, which, in turn, could mean early exits
for the teams when the Southern Section Division I playoffs get
underway this week.</LD>
<LD>   Pairings for softball were released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Esperanza, a Division I finalist last season, shared the league
title with Los Alamitos but goes into the playoffs as the league's
No. 2 team because it lost twice to the Griffins. The Aztecs will
play at Downey (23-4), the San Gabriel Valley League champion.</LD>
<TE>   Los Alamitos (18-11) drew an easier assignment, facing the winner
of Wednesday's wild-card game between Long Beach Wilson (15-11) and
Downey Warren (15-7), but the Griffins will be handicapped by not
having their starting pitcher and catcher.</TE>
<TE>   Both pitchers, Esperanza's Kristen Dedmon (11-7) and Los Alamitos'
Kim Dillon (12-9), were ejected from the game, along with Griffin
catcher Cat Cusick. Each must sit out the next game which, in this
case, is a first-round playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   In the bottom of the seventh inning of a game Los Alamitos
eventually won, 5-3, Esperanza's Heather Rangel hit a two-run homer
and knocked over Dillon, the pitcher, who was standing at home plate
without the ball. Esperanza players were out of the dugout to
congratulate Rangel when the altercation broke out.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a lot more fired up because I know that without Kristen,
we're going to have to try so much harder because we're not going to
have our dominating pitcher out there," said Brittany Fox,
Esperanza's third baseman.</TE>
<TE>   Her father, Coach Dennis Fox, said the incident has rallied them.</TE>
<TE>   "I was worried about chemistry all year," he said, "and this
really seemed to bond the team."</TE>
<TE>   Valencia (23-4-2) is the No. 1-seeded team in Division I, Dana
Point Dana Hills (21-7-1) is No. 2, Lakewood (19-6) is No. 3 and
Capistrano Valley (19-1) is No. 4.</TE>
<TE>   The premier division this season, however, is Division II, in
which Santa Ana Foothill (27-3), Riverside Poly (24-2), Santa Ana
Mater Dei (23-5) and Simi Valley Royal (23-5-1) are seeded Nos. 1-4.</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove Pacifica (25-2-1), the No. 1 team in The Times'
rankings, is top-seeded in Division III, followed by Orange El Modena
(24-5), Laguna Hills (23-4) and Riverside King (22-2).</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo (22-3) in Division IV, Los Angeles Baptist (16-6) in
Division V and Oaks Christian (25-4) in Division VI are also seeded
No. 1.</TE>

<HD>Kings Learning to Act the Part</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Sacramento closes out Dallas, 114-101, but
realizes there's still a long way to a title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Sacramento Kings are trying to act nonchalant. They do not want
to act giddy over a conference semifinal series victory or get cocky
about the way they seem able to make every pass meaningful, make
every loose ball theirs, contest every rebound, guess right on every
bounce.</LD>
<LD>   After defeating the Dallas Mavericks, 114-101, Monday night at
Arco Arena and winning this Western Conference best-of-seven series,
4-1, the Kings wanted to act as if this were no big deal.</LD>
<LD>   In their heads, the Kings know they really aren't champions of
anything yet. A Western Conference regular-season title does not make
a team special or spectacular, and the Kings desperately want to be.</LD>
<TE>   Advancing into the conference finals is only a step, not a leap.
And so the Kings walked off the floor biting the insides of their
cheeks to keep from giggling, tugging at their lips, trying to make
the smile turn into something closer to a frown. They did a little
group dance on the court, but it wasn't too juvenile. Owner Gavin
Maloof was the only King acting as if he hadn't been here before.
Maloof tried his own dance with the cheerleaders and proved only that
owners should be heard and not seen.</TE>
<TE>   While the fans spent most of the fourth quarter chanting "Beat
L.A.," expecting that the Lakers will defeat San Antonio and play the
Kings in the conference finals, Sacramento players would not be
pulled into a discussion about the two-time defending NBA champions.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't give up on San Antonio yet," guard Mike Bibby said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not talking about our next opponent until we know who the
next opponent is," Chris Webber said.</TE>
<TE>   It was right that the Kings behaved as potential champions after
the game because they had played as champions during this game and
all during this series.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with a significant injury (sprained ankle) to a star player
(Peja Stojakovic), the Kings conquered Dallas twice on the road and
came home to end the series immediately and dispassionately.
Sometimes teams unaccustomed to the furious pace of the playoffs will
not treat each opportunity for an ending blow with the reverence and
determination required.</TE>
<TE>   But the Kings did. They led from almost the start (Doug Christie's
fadeaway 15-footer with 8:49 left in the first quarter gave
Sacramento the lead for good) to the glorious finish.</TE>
<TE>   During the middle, the Kings turned back a frantic one-man charge.
Maverick forward Dirk Nowitzki scored on a twister from the lane, on
a baseline drive, on a slam-dunk rebound and on a 20-footer in a
matter of 108 seconds in the third quarter and single-handedly
brought Dallas from a 70-61 deficit to 70-69.</TE>
<TE>   It was as close as the Mavericks had been since Christie's jumper
in the first quarter. When Bibby missed a hurried jump shot on the
next possession, it seemed that maybe Dallas had stolen the momentum
for good. One of its stars, Michael Finley, received a pass while he
was wide open and a step beyond the three-point line.</TE>
<TE>   Finley has probably made hundreds of similar shots in his career
and the cowbell-clanging din of this raucous place went silent with
the expectation of Finley's shot. Except Finley didn't shoot. He
caught the ball, stood still, looked longingly at the basket, double
clutched ... and passed. Steve Nash ended up missing an off-balance
jumper.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings scored the next 10 points.</TE>
<TE>   Finley's hesitation was the last bit of help Sacramento needed.</TE>
<TE>   With Stojakovic missing his second consecutive game, the Kings
showcased their depth and versatility. Six players scored in double
figures.</TE>
<TE>   Nowitzki finished with 32 points and 12 rebounds for Dallas and
Finley had 26 points, but the Dallas bench contributed only 10
points, four rebounds and little enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   Webber and Bibby each had 23 points for the Kings. Webber spent
some time in the third quarter in the locker room, having a sprained
ankle treated. He also took a hard hit to the head from what was
called an intentional foul by Eduardo Najera. But Webber didn't stay
in the locker room long or on the floor for more than a head-clearing
moment. It is, Webber said, what champions must do.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to knock me out to keep me out now," Webber said.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in place of Stojakovic, Hedo Turkoglu found his missing
jump shot and scored 20 points and had a career-high 13 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just a step in the journey," Webber said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Christie: "We've come a ways, and we have a way to go. A long
way."</TE>

<HD>He Isn't Called Coach for Nothing</HD>

<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phil Jackson, the laissez-faire coach, has had his assertive moments
this spring, primarily because of matchup conundrums in the first two
series, injuries to Shaquille O'Neal and the many close playoff
games.</LD>
<LD>   That's a lot of coaching for a man who preaches self-reliance.</LD>
<LD>   "Phil is funny, man," Kobe Bryant said. "He doesn't say too much.
He gives you that little look. He might smirk a little bit. He did
that [Sunday]. He said, 'We can't give them two possessions.'"</LD>
<TE>   Those sage instructions were dispensed during a timeout when the
Lakers were down by eight in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Daniels had just missed a long jump shot, and Tim Duncan
had taken the loose-ball rebound from three Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a smirk on his face, said we can't let that happen with
four minutes left in the game," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant has gone out of his way to commend Jackson and the coaching
staff at least twice since the start of the playoffs, particularly in
regard to game preparation.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say all has been well on the sideline.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson and O'Neal have had a running dialogue in the newspapers,
none of it apparently damaging, some of it humorous, and Jackson did
allow O'Neal to draw a fourth foul before halftime of Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   The upshot: O'Neal continues to grind through his physical misery.
Maybe Jackson's public pondering of harder play or fewer minutes for
O'Neal is unrelated to the center's more active rebounding and
defense. O'Neal did admit, half in jest perhaps, that he took the
second-biggest rebound of Game 4 in part to forestall another Jackson
lecture.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Derek Fisher's late shot went up Sunday, when nearly every
eye in a very large house followed the basketball, Rick Fox looked
for Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   So, while Bryant was getting the rebound and scoring on the
put-back, Fox was to the right of the basket, boxing out Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thinking in my mind, he's the one guy. If he doesn't get the
ball, we've got a great chance," Fox said. "You take yourself out of
the play and a chance for a rebound, but you take him out too."</TE>
<TE>   The box-out not only kept Duncan from the rebound, but pinned him
away from the play when Bryant went back up, leaving David Robinson
alone to contest the eventual game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a friend call me, a guy who knows basketball, from Vegas,
drunk off his mind, yelling, 'You made the play of the day!'" Fox
recalled. "I was like, 'You saw that?'</TE>
<TE>   "It helps. That's something we're supposed to do. As I get older,
the story will be that as Kobe was going up, I was pushing him up.
Boxing out Duncan with one arm and lifting Kobe with the other.
That's how he got up so high."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If the Laker series ends tonight, or Thursday in San Antonio, Los
Angeles would open the Western Conference finals Saturday against the
Sacramento Kings at Arco Arena, with Game 2 Monday also at
Sacramento.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Ready to Work Until Closing Time</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: L.A. has won its last six potential
clinchers, and players say they grasp importance of ending series
tonight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The moment lasted several hours for Kobe Bryant, long enough to board
a chartered jet out of San Antonio, long enough to return to Los
Angeles surrounded by teammates who appreciate who he is and what he
does.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant did not stand alone in beating the San Antonio Spurs in
Game 4 on Sunday night. He stood tallest, but among them. He made the
shot, but Shaquille O'Neal got the rebound, and Derek Fisher got the
loose ball, and Rick Fox got the box-out.</LD>
<LD>   They gorged themselves on it, on their three-games-to-one lead in
the Western Conference semifinals, on what they all had done in those
final frantic seconds, when they pushed and the San Antonio Spurs
went to pieces.</LD>
<TE>   Then it was gone, because Game 5, their chance to close out the
Spurs with relatively little fuss, comes tonight at Staples Center. A
victory would put them into the conference finals against Sacramento,
starting Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I got home," Bryant said, "I started thinking about
[tonight's] game."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have won six consecutive potential clinchers--Game 6
against Indiana for the 2000 title; Game 3 at Portland, Game 4 at
Sacramento, Game 4 versus San Antonio and Game 5 at Philadelphia last
year, and Game 3 at Portland 21/2 weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   They have won most of the difficult playoff games, 11 in a row on
the road, 22 of their last 24 overall.</TE>
<TE>   This year alone they've won in the final ticks with Robert Horry's
three-pointer in Portland and Bryant's put-back in San Antonio,
immediately followed, respectively, by Scottie Pippen's turnover and
Tim Duncan's air ball.</TE>
<TE>   They've won the fourth quarters, but then they've had to, because
of their first three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to play our game and put them away," O'Neal said.
"They're not going to give up easy. They have a lot of pride."</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Fox called it, "That understanding that you don't give
somebody life."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers tend to games these days with a different slant. O'Neal
has a handful of injuries that cause pain when he runs and when he
catches the basketball, and he lacks his usual deftness around the
basket. Fisher (bruised knee, so he'll probably wear a pad in Game
5), Fox (sore shooting shoulder) and Samaki Walker (bruised knee) are
hurt too, but expected to play without being hindered.</TE>
<TE>   On offense, that leaves Bryant, ever talented, ever ambitious and
ever curious.</TE>
<TE>   So the Lakers for the time being go to O'Neal with a little less
determination, and clear out for Bryant with a little more
regularity. It is, they assume, a temporary condition because of
O'Neal's injuries and Bryant's vitality.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, they pay tribute to their limping big man, who
grinds through his days hurt that not enough observers see his pain,
injured that they can't understand his physical limitations, and just
plain hurt and injured.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm really happy about is Shaquille has recognized what he
can do for the basketball team," Coach Phil Jackson said Monday
afternoon. "In years past, he's been the strength and tower of this
basketball team. We've saddled him up and rode his back. Except for
the San Antonio series last year, where we talked to Kobe about being
the initiator and carrying the scoring load because they were
double-teaming Shaquille without distinction from Duncan and [David]
Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it has to do with screen-and-rolls, setting picks,
making passes, drawing the defense, guarding Tim Duncan and doing the
things that have to be done in order to win a ballgame. About a week
ago, he was talking about some of the things that were happening to
him. He said, 'I'm going to have to play defense and rebound now.' I
said, 'That's all you have to do for us to win.' He said, 'You'd like
that, wouldn't you.'"</TE>
<TE>   Jackson laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to see him shoot a high percentage in his field goals,"
he said. "The reality is, he's doing enough for us to win.... Not
enough for us to blow teams out, that's for sure, but enough."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant almost always has the ball in his hands, a gradual
transition that means he brings the ball up the floor, initiates the
offense and then, at times, runs to the low block, where he has
posted Antonio Daniels, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the series, he made threes at the top, sliced to the rim
from the wing, and spun for finger rolls from the low post.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant misses too. He has shot 44.6% in the series. But the man
misses nine of 10 threes, only to get to the fourth quarter of the
fourth game and make two. In 45 seconds. In front of 36,000 people
who could just weep over it.</TE>
<TE>   He's playing so hard, so fast, tears are practically rolling out
of the corners of his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fine line," Bryant said. "It used to be difficult in the
past to learn how to have an impact on the game when I'm not shooting
the ball well. But I've kind of grown into a role where the team
trusts me with the basketball making decisions, to set up
opportunities in situations on the floor. So I'm able to have much
more of an impact when I'm not shooting the ball."</TE>
<TE>   So the Spurs arrive dismayed, annoyed and frustrated, but knowing
they absolutely will not be swept this year, which is something. Only
six teams have come from a 3-1 deficit to win a series.</TE>
<TE>   They won Game 2 in Los Angeles seven days ago, however, when the
Lakers had won 19 consecutive games at Staples Center. Meanwhile,
back in San Antonio, the local paper and townsfolk have dubbed the
Spurs chokers for their fourth-quarter shutdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers wouldn't believe it.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were playing by themselves and missing shots, maybe you
could say they were choking," Fisher said. "We've been much more
active late in the games."</TE>

<DH>After winning every MVP award the WNBA has to offer, Leslie
showed in the off-season she's not satisfied yet</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a gloriously sunny day in Los Angeles as Lisa Leslie entered
Gold's Gym with a strong, regal stride.</LD>
<LD>   Heads swiveled and cries of "hey champ" and "great season" were
heard as the 6-foot-5 Leslie made her way toward a back room for her
second workout of the day--and it wasn't even noon yet.</LD>
<LD>   The center and centerpiece of the WNBA champion Los Angeles Sparks
had begun her day at 6:30 a.m. with some stretching before heading to
the El Segundo practice facility that the team shares with the
Lakers. There, she and Coach Michael Cooper spent nearly two hours
working on new moves for the season, which starts May 25 with a home
game against New York.</LD>
<TE>   Cooper, who calls Leslie by her nickname "Smooth," positioned her
at the three-point line for the first drill, which had Leslie running
to a spot, catching the ball and shooting. Later, Leslie switched to
working inside the lane. There were hook shots with both hands,
followed by catching passes near the basket to practice the footwork
Leslie needs to get free for layups. Leslie finished by running about
the court, shooting over foam cutouts that stand seven feet.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie is coming off a breakthrough season in which she shed her
genteel on-court image and became the first WNBA player to be named
the most valuable player of the regular season, the All-Star game and
the playoffs. But as she aims to repeat that performance this year,
Leslie said success only drives her to try harder.</TE>
<TE>   "I love to learn," Leslie said, adding that such personal tutoring
by Cooper, one of the NBA's best defenders during his 11-year career,
is an educational experience other WNBA players envy. But she said
she also values the lessons from less-celebrated instructors.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to pick [Cooper's] brain, learn what he was thinking when
he was playing defense. But say it's a no-name guy just walking into
the gym. If he has a nice move or crossover dribble and I could talk
to him about it, I will."</TE>
<TE>   After her practice with Cooper and a light breakfast, she became
pupil to personal trainer Adam Friedman. On this day, she
concentrated on arms and chest, lifting and curling for 90 minutes
and finishing up with a stretch-and-massage.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie is "one of the most diligent and disciplined clients I
could ask for," said Friedman, who also serves to shoo away fans
who'd rather bother Leslie instead of doing their own workout. But
Leslie is usually gracious to those who approach for a photo or an
autograph.</TE>
<TE>   "She handles it well," Friedman said. "She is one of most
recognized people in that gym."</TE>
<TE>   It isn't just at the gym.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie is a star in a league that has precious few, and she is
especially recognizable in Los Angeles after leading the Sparks to
their first WNBA championship last year, ending the reign of
four-time champion Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie tends to be shy and introverted, but in an effort to be an
ambassador for women's basketball, she tries to embrace the fame
game. Even that has its limits.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shopping at Palm Springs before Christmas," Leslie said. "I
got there about 10:30, and normally I'd stay all day. But I had to
leave by 2 p.m. I had marker stains all over my hands trying to sign
all the autographs."</TE>
<TE>   There's More to Success</TE>
<TE>   Leslie's performance last season topped a basketball career that
includes two Olympic gold medals as well as being named college
player of the year while at USC. She became the WNBA's all-time
leading scorer with 2,670 points. In addition to MVP honors, she
finished the 2001 season second in scoring (19.5), second in blocked
shots (2.29), third in rebounds (9.6) and third in double-doubles
(16).</TE>
<TE>   When she lifted the WNBA championship trophy over her head after
vanquishing Charlotte, 82-54, in the WNBA title game Sept. 1, the joy
and relief Leslie felt was a marked contrast to the tears she wept
when Houston beat Los Angeles in the 2000 Western Conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time I was able to finish a season, look back at it
and be proud of the whole season," Leslie said. "My biggest thing was
I didn't want to be on the floor crying again [after losing the title
one year earlier]. That thought alone gave me enough drive and hunger
to want to finish well and win the championship. It's one thing to
have tears of joy, it's another to have sorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie's outstanding season did not translate into a windfall of
endorsements, but compared to other WNBA players Leslie has had her
share.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie and NBA star Kevin Garnett recently lent their images to a
new video game, and Leslie also signed a deal with Fleer SkyBox
trading cards. Dr. Scholl's foot product company added two more years
to her endorsement deal and she was feted by Sports Illustrated and
the Oscar De La Hoya Foundation at black-tie affairs. There also have
been television appearances on "Hollywood Squares" and "One On One,"
and a turn as grand marshal at this year's Martin Luther King Day
parade here.</TE>
<TE>   Agent Bruce Binkow would not say how much she earns, but allowed
that $1 million a year is "in the ballpark."</TE>
<TE>   Still, one can't help but wonder if Leslie--whose flashing brown
eyes and taut physique have been the subject of many modeling
shoots--could have done better.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Greene, a West Coast representative for Nike, said Leslie
would get far more attention if she were the NBA MVP.</TE>
<TE>   "The trick for women is to get the equal dollars, and the [size of
the] audience is the difference," Greene said. "The NBA draws more
people, men and women."</TE>
<TE>   Not everything is about money.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie volunteers her time for public-service announcements aimed
at fighting teen pregnancy. She has a nonprofit foundation
coordinated through Nike that mentors children. She is a spokeswoman
for the Sears Breast Cancer Awareness campaign and recently spent
time in Washington assisting First Lady Laura Bush with the Reading
to Achieve program for elementary schoolchildren. She often spends
weekends with the girls' Olympic development team.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything in my life is a blessing," Leslie said. "Right now I'm
in that window of opportunity. I might be hot, people know my name.
But that window only stays open for a short period of time. When it
closes, it will be someone else's turn.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand that while the window is open, I give all I can. I
do the autographs, smile at people, try to touch lives in the ways I
can. There are many things I like to do in life, but I recognize that
while the attention is on me, people are listening. So I have to use
my ability to hopefully help some kid want to set goals and do
something with their lives."</TE>
<TE>   That attitude led her to involvement with a foster family of six
boys in Compton. She takes them on outings and is there when they
need to talk to someone.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a part of my life," Leslie said. "I met the foster
father at church in 1997. We formed a relationship, whether it is
worshiping together, having dinner on Sundays, playing with the boys
or helping with their homework.</TE>
<TE>   "I love these boys.... They're part of my extended family--the
youngest is 11 and the oldest is 18. Two are Mexican, the others are
black; we're just family."</TE>
<TE>   No Place Like Home</TE>
<TE>   Leslie's sprawling, split-level home in Los Angeles is more about
serenity than being a showcase.</TE>
<TE>   A 12-foot moss green couch centers a living room bathed in soft
whites and accented by high ceilings. Leafy ferns and ivy are
prominent. A mirrored bar is off to the left; several steps beyond, a
chandelier hangs over a small dinette set. Three large picture
windows offer a view of a pool and, on a clear day, the beach. A
small pond is home to three Koi fish. The backyard is home to Lennox,
Leslie's pit bull puppy.</TE>
<TE>   Save for two scrapbooks fat with photos from her 1996 and 2000
Olympic teams, there is nothing here that reveals Leslie's
occupation. A portrait of Leslie in a one-shoulder black evening gown
hangs over the stone fireplace. On the mantel is a block wood cross
with the inscription "But GOD forbid I should boast except in the
cross of our Lord, Jesus Christ."</TE>
<TE>   "This is my sanctuary," Leslie said.</TE>
<TE>   But she's not stopping here long. Lunch is waiting at her mother's
home, about a mile away. Fried chicken wings, rice and corn is the
menu.</TE>
<TE>   "My baby's favorite," Christine Leslie-Espinoza said.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie is the second of Christine's three daughters. She is
definitely a momma's girl, always addressing Christine as "Mommy" and
humming happily when lunch is served. They animatedly discuss how
Lisa will look at the Sports Illustrated dinner that night, where she
will receive an award.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't wear black lipstick, it makes your face look sad," her
mother said.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie rolls her eyes gently and smiles.</TE>
<TE>   Tough Stuff</TE>
<TE>   The biggest change Leslie made last season was throwing off her
"finesse" label for good.</TE>
<TE>   She muscled up her 170-pound frame by running and lifting weights.
She also changed her attitude; if people got rough with her, Leslie
got rough right back. Her near fight last May with New York Liberty
center Tamika Whitmore--6-2, 190--sent the message around the league
that no one, New York or otherwise, would take liberties with Leslie.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got here three years ago," said Spark forward DeLisha
Milton, "I had heard stuff about her--a great player, but 'very
feminine' on the court. That she didn't like to get hit, that she,
well, played like a girl. And I saw some signs of that.</TE>
<TE>   "But now, she has this 'in your face' mentality; almost thuglike.
She's still feminine, but there is lots of sweat in her game. She
gets a busted lip every two, three games."</TE>
<TE>   Some coaches, who declined to be named, even accused Leslie of
turning into a dirty player. Not everyone agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "A dirty player? You can say that about almost anybody who is
competitive," Sacramento Coach Maura McHugh said.</TE>
<TE>   "Lisa has a tendency to use a lot of elbows, that kind of stuff. I
don't know if she is any more 'dirty' than anybody else. But I
wouldn't say she is squeaky clean out there, either."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie said she is only defending herself.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never, ever in my career hit somebody first," Leslie said.
"I've never intentionally elbowed somebody first. I'm not out there
trying to undercut people or do something to hurt someone. I play
hard, and if you hit me I'm gonna hit you back. Or if you elbow me
I'm gonna hit you back unless I think it wasn't intentional.</TE>
<TE>   "There are certain things that happen that are part of the game.
They don't bother me; I can take a hit. But if you're trash talking
and you hit me, or if I feel you intentionally hit me, I may not get
you back right then, but you're gonna get it at some point. It might
not even be that game, but I'm not gonna forget."</TE>
<TE>   At 29, Leslie is at the peak of her powers. Are there still
challenges?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Leslie said. She wants the Sparks to have a dynastic run
similar to Houston's. She wants to repeat as the league's best
player. That's why she has thrown herself into rigorous off-season
workouts as she did last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, in regards to my career, I have fulfilled a lot of the
goals I have set," Leslie said. "But even when I found myself the
best at certain levels--whether high school, college or pros--there
is always something I could learn and do better. That's my attitude.
The day I stop doing that is the day I'm going to be done."</TE>

<HD>Defense Is Key to Celtics' Playoff Run</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Boston Celtics have a stifling defense and a whole lot of history
on their side.</LD>
<LD>   The Celtics, who hold a 3-1 series lead over the Detroit Pistons,
are one victory away from advancing to the Eastern Conference finals
for the first time since 1988.</LD>
<LD>   Boston, which hadn't made the postseason in seven years, has never
lost a playoff series after leading, 3-1.</LD>
<TE>   The Celtics will try to eliminate the Pistons tonight at Auburn
Hills, Mich., using the same defensive game plan that held Detroit to
a 73.3-point average the last three games.</TE>
<TE>   Boston, which gave up 96 points in a Game 1 loss, kept the Pistons
to 77, 64 and 79 points in the next three games.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons credit Boston's strategy of taking away the middle,
but they also blame too many unforced turnovers and missed shots.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need to make any adjustments," said Detroit's Ben
Wallace, the league's defensive player of the year, who had 21
rebounds in each of the last two games. "We're playing solid defense
and getting good shots. We just haven't been knocking them down."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defense is also the constant that has put the New Jersey Nets
within a victory of their first Eastern Conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   In winning three of the first four games in the best-of-seven
series against Charlotte, New Jersey has shut down the Hornets in the
fourth quarter. Charlotte is 17 for 54 from the field in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "In the fourth quarter, we all understand what we have to do, and
that's get stops," New Jersey's Jason Kidd said. "I think we all have
sacrificed in some way to do that. That's what it takes, team defense
in the fourth quarter, if you want to win."</TE>

<HD>Haskins Must Return $815,000</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the last chapters in the Minnesota men's basketball scandal
ended Monday when a judge ruled that former coach Clem Haskins must
return $815,000 of his $1.5-million contract buyout.</LD>
<LD>   Hennepin County (Minn.) District Judge Deborah Hedlund accepted an
arbitrator's recommendation. Both sides had agreed to let the
arbitrator resolve the long-running dispute.</LD>
<LD>   The scandal broke in 1999 when Jan Gangelhoff, a former office
manager in the men's athletic department's academic counseling unit,
disclosed she had written more than 400 papers for players.</LD>
<TE>   Haskins denied involvement. But the university later concluded
that he had lied to investigators and committed fraud by taking the
buyout, and filed a lawsuit to recover the money.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the key point here is if you lie and cheat the
university, you pay," Mark Rotenberg, the university's general
counsel, said of the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Since $425,000 of the buyout was deferred compensation, the award
means more than three-quarters of the money the university paid to
get rid of Haskins--$1.075 million--will return to the university,
Rotenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The arbitrator, former Hennepin County District Judge Richard
Solum, said the $815,000 figure was a compromise, dictated in part by
Haskins' financial circumstances. Solum said it fell between the
university's last demand and Haskins' last offer.</TE>
<TE>   Solum also wrote that he believed the school could have difficulty
proving its case to a jury.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The remaining two misdemeanor drug and alcohol charges against
Texas running back Cedric Benson were dropped after officials at
Midland, Texas, decided there wasn't enough evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Benson, 19, and Melanie Robinson, 20, were arrested at his
apartment April 27 after police responded to a call about loud music.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Andre Agassi withdrew, and Pete Sampras was defeated as the German
Open lost two of its biggest stars within hours.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to organizers, Agassi said his victory Sunday at the
Italian Open made him reconsider playing in Germany. His late pullout
will cost him a $40,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Sampras' drought stretched to 27 tournaments without a title. At
Hamburg, he offered little resistance in a 6-3, 6-4 loss to unseeded
Max Mirnyi of Belarus.</TE>
<TE>   "I am trying to find my game," Sampras said. "I haven't found it.
It's pretty frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   Other upsets included No. 3-seeded Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain
falling to countryman Albert Costa, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4; and No. 4 Yevgeny
Kafelnikov of Russia losing to Alex Corretja of Spain, 6-1, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt struggled in beating German wild-card
entry Philipp Kohlschreiber, 7-5, 6-4; and fifth-seeded Tim Henman
beat Nicolas Escude, 6-4, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mary Pierce and Anna Kournikova, two former top 10 players making
their way back from injuries, won first-round matches at the Italian

<TE>   France's Pierce defeated Marie-Gaiane Mikaelian of Switzerland,
6-3, 5-7, 6-4; and Russia's Kournikova swept Marta Marrero of Spain,
6-3, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   Meghann Shaughnessy, seeded 10th, lost to Asa Svensson of Sweden,
6-3, 6-3.</TE>

<TE>   Dwight Clark, best known for making "The Catch" for the San
Francisco 49ers, is resigning as the Cleveland Browns' director of
football operations, clearing the way for Coach Butch Davis to take
greater control of personnel decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Clark had been with the Browns since 1999, when they returned to
the NFL as an expansion team.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd have to consider this a joint decision," team President
Carmen Policy said. "He wants to try something else."</TE>
<TE>   Policy, in Houston at the NFL meetings, said Clark is leaving the
Browns to pursue other goals in football and that the shift is not a
result of losing a power struggle with Davis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mickey Loomis was promoted from director of football operations to
general manager by the New Orleans Saints, four days after the firing
of general manager Randy Mueller. Loomis was with Seattle for 15
years before joining the Saints two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The latest controversy involving Washington Redskin quarterbacks
has been resolved. The jersey numbers of Joe Theismann and Sonny
Jurgensen will remain off-limits.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Wuerffel took the practice field wearing No. 17. He had been
wearing No. 7--Theismann's number--at previous spring practices, but
a debate over whether new quarterback Shane Matthews could take
Jurgensen's No. 9 prompted Coach Steve Spurrier to reconsider his
policy and declare certain numbers off limits.</TE>
<TE>   Matthews will wear No. 6.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an upside-down nine," Matthews said. "I'd love to be wearing
No. 9, but that's in the past.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll just sign my autographs with a six with a line over it."</TE>

<HD>Slovakia Cherishes Its Finest Moment on Ice</HD>

<LD>The Kings' Ziggy Palffy and his Slovak teammates might have had a
forgettable experience at the Salt Lake City Olympic Games but they
made the most of their time at last week's World Championships.</LD>
<LD>   On a late third-period goal by Washington's Peter Bondra, Slovakia
won its first gold medal with a 4-3 victory over Russia in the
championship game at Goteborg, Sweden, before a pro-Slovakia crowd
that included President Rudolf Schuster.</LD>
<LD>   With the victory, the Slovaks avenged the perceived lack of
respect shown them at the Olympics, where they had to play in the
preliminary round, whereas Canada, Finland, Sweden, Russia, the Czech
Republic and the U.S.--supposedly international hockey's elite
teams--got direct byes into the qualifying round. Slovakia failed to
advance because some NHL players had difficulty freeing themselves
from their teams before the league's Olympic break. Slovakia finished
13th among 14 teams.</LD>
<TE>   That was not a problem in Sweden, and Palffy, who joined Team
Slovakia after the Kings had been eliminated from the playoffs by
Colorado, Bondra and several other NHL players, among them King
defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky and former King Jozef Stumpel, made
their country of 5.4 million people proud.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just indescribable," Peter Stastny, Slovakia's general
manager said of his country's first gold medal since the breakup of
Czechoslovakia 10 years ago. "It was a gradual, rising euphoria.
People the last few days back home, I don't think they worked.</TE>
<TE>   "This is, without a doubt, the greatest success of the country.
Our people suffered after the Olympics. They felt an injustice. And
this is probably the best revenge."</TE>
<TE>   More than 25,000 Slovaks gave the team a hero's welcome on its
return to Bratislava on Sunday. Dozens carried Slovak flags, wore
jerseys similar to those of the national team or painted their faces
in the national colors--white, blue and red.</TE>
<TE>   Although Russia had only three NHL players on its roster, and
Olympic finalists Canada and the U.S. each had teams playing at less
than full strength, the Slovaks cherished their victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't describe what this means in Slovakia," said captain
Miroslav Satan of the Buffalo Sabres, the tournament's MVP. "The
people in Slovakia don't have much good news. This is the biggest and
best news since we started our own country.... I'm very happy and I
will remember it for the rest of my life."</TE>
<TE>   One lasting memory of the tournament was forged in the semifinals
when Slovak players and coaches locked arms on the bench during a
tense shootout victory over Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   "I really believe we were the best team here," Stastny said.
"Peter Bondra was unbelievable. So was Miro Satan. So was Ziggy
Palffy."</TE>
<TE>   Don't look for Slovakia to be left out of the elite group at the
2006 Olympic Games because the Slovaks already have been added to the
2004 World Cup of Hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke on Hot Seat</TE>
<TE>   An Internet site, clarkemustgo.com, has been set up by a group of
Philadelphia fans upset with General Manager Bobby Clarke since the
Flyers were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Ottawa,
after finishing with the second-best record in the Eastern
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   The site's home page features the words "Clarke Must Go" with an
Xed out No. 16, Clarke's old jersey number. More than 7,300
people--one from Helsinki, Finland--have visited the site and added
their names to a petition calling for Clarke's firing.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke, though, has more pressing issues to deal with than a
negative web site.</TE>
<TE>   First on his list is naming a new coach after firing Bill Barber.
Former Boston coach Pat Burns, former Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock,
Colorado assistant Bryan Trottier and Montreal assistant Guy
Carbonneau are believed to be the leading candidates. Hitchcock has
emerged as the favorite and could be named coach as early as today.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke also will spend time in an Atlantic City, N.J., courthouse
this summer, testifying in Dave Babych's lawsuit against the Flyers,
which will start July 15.</TE>
<TE>   Babych was nearing the end of his 17-year NHL career in 1998 when,
in the playoffs against Buffalo, after a talk with the Flyers'
orthopedic surgeon, Arthur Bartolozzi, he played on a frozen foot
that turned out to be fractured in three places.</TE>
<TE>   Babych contends his career was cut short by the further damage he
did to his foot, and maintains that the Flyers were aware that he
would suffer such a fate.</TE>
<TE>   Line Shifts</TE>
<TE>   Montreal fans sank to a new low last week when someone threw
bananas toward black Carolina goaltender Kevin Weekes. Kevin Paul
Dupont of the Boston Globe wrote: "Quite a run for Habs' fans. They
booed 'The Star-Spangled Banner' during the Bruin series, and now a
sad display of racism. If they're going to act that, uh, American,
why don't we just buy 'em?" ... The New York Rangers, Dallas,
Washington and the Mighty Ducks are looking for coaches. Herb Brooks,
the two-time U.S. Olympic coach, is reportedly the leading candidate
for the Ranger job--one he held 20 years ago--after former New Jersey
and King coach Larry Robinson told the team he wasn't interested. The
New York Times reported last week that former Ranger and current
Florida Coach Mike Keenan also remains a possibility.... There is
very little sympathy outside of Toronto for Maple Leaf winger Darcy
Tucker, who was knocked out of the playoffs with a shoulder injury on
a hit by Ottawa's Daniel Alfredsson in Game 5. "He's a guy who has a
reputation for diving and embellishing injuries," one unidentified
player told the Ottawa Sun. "There's no way he was going to get the
benefit of the doubt on that one after what he did to [New York
Islander] Mike Peca. You live by the sword, you die by the sword."
Peca suffered a sprained knee in a low hit by Tucker earlier in the
playoffs.</TE>

<TE>   From his seat in the stands, injured forward Mikael Renberg likes
the Toronto Maple Leafs' chances in Game 7 tonight against the Ottawa
Senators.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like we have a mental advantage over them," Renberg said
after watching his Toronto teammates practice Monday. "I feel great
about us. We have an advantage over them and they know it."</TE>
<TE>   The Senators lost the only seventh game they've played, blowing a
3-2 series lead to Buffalo in the first round in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The Maple Leafs have won 10 of 18 series that reached a seventh
game, rallying from a 3-2 deficit six times.</TE>

<TE>   Ron Wilson, in his first public comments since he was fired by the
Washington Capitals, conceded that his message was probably getting
stale after five years as coach.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson was dismissed Friday by General Manager George McPhee, who
said the players were starting to "tune things out."</TE>
<TE>   Said Wilson: "If you have the same core group for a number of
years, it's difficult to keep things interesting and not drone on
about the same things. Changing the messenger is probably not a bad
idea."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Arizona's Curt Schilling couldn't have had a smoother ride to his
major league-leading eighth victory. Kris Benson's long-anticipated
return to the mound for Pittsburgh was much rougher.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling pitched seven shutout innings, and Luis Gonzalez drove
in four runs as the Diamondbacks ruined Benson's return to the Pirate
rotation with an 11-0 victory Monday night at Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling (8-1) struck out 11, walked none and gave up four hits.
Gonzalez had a homer, double and single.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a quarter of the season," Schilling said. "We're playing
better now when I pitch. They're scoring runs and playing fantastic
defense. I think if I pitched this way last year I might not have
eight wins."</TE>
<TE>   Benson, making his first start after sitting out last season
because of elbow surgery, gave up nine runs, seven earned, and 10
hits in 32/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Benson rented a stadium suite to entertain 40-plus family and
friends who gathered for his comeback.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 7, Atlanta 6--An earthquake jolted Pacific Bell Park
during the ninth inning, and Jeff Kent drew a bases-loaded walk in
the 11th to lift the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   The game was not stopped as glass panes in the front of the press
box rattled with Atlanta's Chipper Jones batting with one out in the
ninth. There was no noticeable reaction from the players or the crowd
of 36,331.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 3, Chicago 0--Matt Morris pitched a four-hitter for the
host Cardinals in the first game between the teams since accusations
of sign-stealing last week at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   In Morris' previous start, he gave up a home run to Sammy Sosa,
prompting the Cardinals to claim Sosa got help on pitch location from
his coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Morris (6-2) struck out seven, walked two and retired 20 of 21
batters in one stretch. The Cardinals won for the fourth time in five
games.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 5, Milwaukee 0--Jose Rijo, pitching on his 37th
birthday, threw five scoreless innings and rookie Austin Kearns
homered and drove in three runs at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Rijo (3-1) gave up three hits, walked four and struck out one.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 7, Montreal 3--Mark Kotsay had four hits at San Diego,
including a home run, and Ray Lankford drove in three runs to double
his season total.</TE>
<TE>   Lankford had three hits and Bubba Trammell drove in two runs.
Lankford, whose $7.6-million salary tops the Padres, was batting .209
with one home run and three runs batted in before the game.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 17, Philadelphia 3--Geoff Blum had three doubles and a
career-high five runs batted in, and the host Astros set season highs
for runs and hits. The Astros finished with 20 hits, but no home
runs.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 7, Florida 3--Denny Stark came up from the minors to
pitch six shutout innings in his NL debut, and pinch-hitter Greg
Norton had a grand slam at Coors Field, where the Rockies have won
seven in a row.</TE>

<HD>War Emblem Definitely Has His Charms</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Baffert says his Derby winner is in same
class as Silver Charm and Real Quiet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NEIL MILBERT</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Silver Charm won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness in 1997 and Real
Quiet took the first two legs of the Triple Crown in 1998. Their
trainer, Bob Baffert, says his newly acquired Kentucky Derby winner,
War Emblem, is "as good as a Real Quiet or a Silver Charm."</LD>
<LD>   "He's as good as any horse I brought there," continued Baffert,
recalling all 11 of his previous starters in America's most famous
race. "But I'd like to have Point Given for the last two legs."</LD>
<LD>   Point Given, the trainer's most highly touted Kentucky Derby
candidate, failed to deliver on the first Saturday in May 2001. But
after finishing fifth in the Kentucky Derby, Point Given won the
Preakness and Belmont, and was voted North America's horse of the
year.</LD>
<TE>   Going into the Derby, War Emblem didn't appear to be in the class
of Silver Charm, Real Quiet and Point Given.</TE>
<TE>   And, despite the good game that Baffert has been talking since the
Derby, the jury is still out going into Saturday's Preakness at
Pimlico.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Derby, Silver Charm had won two graded stakes in
Southern California and had run a close second in two others. Real
Quiet had won the Grade I Hollywood Futurity and, like Silver Charm,
had placed in the Grade II San Felipe and Grade I Santa Anita Derby.
Point Given had won all three of those high-profile races plus the
Grade III Kentucky Cup Juvenile and had been a strong runner-up in
the Grade I Breeders' Cup Juvenile and the Grade I Champagne.</TE>
<TE>   As for War Emblem, his lone pre-Derby stakes victory in seven
starts for his previous owner, Russell Reineman, had been a
six-length runaway in the Grade III Illinois Derby at Sportsman's
Park, a race in which he had no competition for the lead. In his two
earlier stakes ventures at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans, he had
faded to sixth in the Grade III Risen Star and had fallen back to
fifth in the ungraded Lecomte.</TE>
<TE>   For Baffert and Prince Ahmed Salman of Saudi Arabia, seeing the
Illinois Derby on TV at different locations was believing War Emblem
could do what he did in the Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Four days after the Illinois Derby, Baffert and Richard Mulhall,
racing manager for the prince's Thoroughbred Corp., watched while
Reineman's trainer, Frank Springer, had War Emblem audition by
working out at Keeneland.</TE>
<TE>   Springer had given Baffert a rundown on War Emblem's physical
problems. But Baffert was undaunted and asked Mulhall to recommend to
the prince that they make the $900,000 deal that gave Thoroughbred
Corp. its 90% ownership of the colt and allowed Reineman to retain
10%.</TE>
<TE>   "This horse had just won that big race in Illinois and was full of
himself," Baffert said. "If the prince had passed on the horse I
would have bought him for somebody else. This is a very good horse.</TE>
<TE>   "I bought this horse from experience. They all have problems, like
any athlete. I was buying a horse that was 20-1 [in the Kentucky
Derby]; I wasn't buying a horse that was 1-2."</TE>
<TE>   The problems were bone chips in both ankles and possibly in his
left knee.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of my good horses have had chips," Baffert said. "Real
Quiet had a chip in his ankle. Silver Charm had a little chip.</TE>
<TE>   "This horse was sort of a project. He's a one-dimensional horse in
that he wants to run on the lead. My other ones weren't like that. I
had to get him to relax. Basically, we were working on how we would
handle it if he got into a speed duel."</TE>
<TE>   No speed duel materialized in the Derby. After setting a moderate
pace into the stretch, War Emblem accelerated and drew away to win
the 18-horse race by a widening four lengths over Proud Citizen, who
was second all the way.</TE>
<TE>   But Baffert believes a speed duel may be forthcoming Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "The next race is going to be totally different," he predicted.
"Booklet [who didn't run in the Derby] is really fast. He's a good
mile horse and a good mile-and-a-16th horse. And with [frequent
front-runner] Medaglia d'Oro breaking badly in the Derby, he didn't
really get a chance to run the way he can."</TE>
<TE>   Baffert says he's more worried about Derby runner-up Proud Citizen
than Booklet.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the one I fear in the Preakness," said War Emblem's trainer.</TE>
<TE>   Silver Charm and Real Quiet each had nine opponents in the
Preakness and Point Given raced 10 foes. War Emblem is expected to
have to cope with 11 or 12 but Baffert believes that will work to his
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "A large field won't hurt a horse like mine," he predicted. "He's
a speed horse. He's going to be out there in front of them. If I had
a Real Quiet or a Point Given, I'd worry about a large field. With
War Emblem, the more traffic the better. Horses that close will have
a tougher time getting there."</TE>

<LD>Colin Wilcox and Kyle Dowden of Camarillo High took advantage of
local knowledge, finishing first and second in the one-round Southern
Section Northern Individual Regional golf tournament at Sterling
Hills Golf Club in Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   Wilcox, a sophomore, shot two-under-par 69 to lead the field of 84
players trying to qualify for the Southern Section finals May 20 at
Canyon Country Club in Palm Springs. Wilcox, who had five birdies in
his round, was the only player to break par.</LD>
<LD>   Dowden, a junior, tied with Brandon Christianson of Valencia and
Mike Paglialonga of Atascadero, two strokes behind Wilcox. The top 24
players advanced to the section finals. The cut came at 76. Camarillo
does not use Sterling Hills as its home course, but Wilcox and Dowden
both credited familiarity from living nearby as an advantage.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew that if the pins were in certain places on certain holes
that you shouldn't go after them," said Wilcox, who had bogeys on
Nos. 14 and 15, then followed with birdies at Nos. 16, 18 and No. 1
in the shotgun format. "And that's what I did. I just happened to
make some putts."</TE>
<TE>   Patience was imperative on a course that was set up with high
rough and fast greens for the Camarillo City Championships a week
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it would be set up tough, and that helped me pick and
choose my spots," Dowden said. "I just tried to get pars because if
you were too aggressive, one hole could jump up and bite you."</TE>
<TE>   Central Regional--Henry Liaw of Hacienda Heights Los Altos, the
reigning U.S. Junior champion, shot five-under-par 67 at the Desert
Willow Golf Resort Firecliff Course and won by four shots over Brian
Mahoney of Palm Desert and Trevor Schultz of San Dimas.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Regional--The Southern tournament was postponed because
of a fire that burned nearly 600 acres near tournament site Tijeras
Creek Golf Course in Rancho Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   Tournament manager Bob Bosanko said players were not in danger,
but helicopters needed to use the golf course ponds for water to
fight the fire. Players had completed about five holes when the
Orange County Sheriff's office evacuated the course. All scores will
be wiped out when the tournament is replayed, Bosanko said.</TE>
<TE>   Bosanko hopes to have a makeup date and location secured by the
end of today. It must be played by Sunday because it is a qualifying
tournament for the section finals on Monday.</TE>

<HD>Time Stands Still for These Little Leaguers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have two children, and since I know all about Xs and Ys, I
understand it was pretty much up to me what brand I got. I had girls.</LD>
<LD>   I made the decision from the very beginning to avoid a life of
T-ball and Little League games, volunteering the wife to work in the
snack stand, and worrying about who makes all-stars.</LD>
<LD>   I know there are some girls who can play baseball, but I watched
the wife try to hit a 16-inch softball while we were still dating and
talking to each other, so I knew if the girls took after their mother
they'd be shopping most of the time.</LD>
<TE>   That's why I don't have much sympathy for a large group of parents
who found themselves standing for two hours outside Dodger Stadium
recently with more than 100 excited, antsy Santa Monica T-ballers and
Little Leaguers.</TE>
<TE>   They could have had girls, and dropped them off at the mall.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what happened. The Dodgers invited the Santa Monica
youngsters to the stadium with the promise of going on the field and
told them to arrive by 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The kids, ranging in age from 4 to 12, brought their baseball
gloves because they've seen the way Shawn Green plays defense, and
obviously the team could use one of them. They also brought balls and
paper for autographs, so when they get older, they can sell them on
EBay.</TE>
<TE>   After about an hour, three young women from the Dodgers' marketing
department showed up and told the parents to leave their kids and to
take their seats inside the stadium. There was no indication if they
would ever get their kids back.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't allowed to bring our backpacks into the stadium, but
parents were told to just leave their 4- and 5-year-olds behind with
no sign of any real security, and it was kind of insane," said Todd
Dufour, manager of the T-ball Giants. "None of the parents wanted to
leave their kids because it was such a mess. There was talk of
writing the cell phone number of the parents on every kid's hand so
they could be found later."</TE>
<TE>   I hope the parents didn't think the Dodgers were going to pay for
those cell phone calls. Boy would that have been a disaster.</TE>
<TE>   I called Dodger public relations and got a recording with Tom
Lasorda's voice telling me no one was home. I called the Dodger vice
president of always putting a positive spin to everything that
happens in Dodger Stadium and was put on hold so I could hear Vin
Scully tell me about Tom Lasorda. When I got to the ballpark, Tom
Lasorda was the first one to greet me in the Dodger clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   When Lasorda leaves for good, I don't know what the Dodgers will
do for public relations.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just expecting more from the Dodgers," said Andy Finley,
one of the most vocal fathers in attendance. "You remember that look
Pat Nixon always had on her face; that's what we got from the Dodger
marketing reps. You'd think they'd find somebody who likes kids and
who'd entertain them, maybe give them baseball cards or something
while waiting. They told the kids they'd be going on the field in a
couple of minutes, the kids got excited and an hour later, nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Two hours after arriving, they herded the kids on the field to
graze, and the parents tried to get into the stadium to take their
pictures, but weren't allowed in because many of them had backpacks."</TE>
<TE>   The kids never got an autograph or close to any Dodgers, the
parents didn't get their pictures, and yet by all accounts once the
kids got into the stadium they had a grand time. That's also when
they started eating hot dogs and ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   When I finally reached a Dodger spokesman, Derrick Hall said, "By
the time the season is over, 45,000 Little Leaguers will have been on
the field." There was no indication if he was including the 25
players on the Dodger roster.</TE>
<TE>   Hall said the Dodgers have received nothing but positive remarks
from other groups about their visits, but after checking with team
personnel he admitted there were mistakes made with the Santa Monica
group. "The experience should be just perfect and something they can
talk about for the next 20 years and this wasn't," Hall said. "I'd be
unhappy too, waiting that long with young kids."</TE>
<TE>   He said the team will make up for it with the Santa Monica group.
I'd think sending everyone to a Laker playoff game would cover it. My
girls will baby-sit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LASORDA SAYS he is going to China in a few weeks to look for
players. I still say he's just searching for a group of people who
haven't heard all of his stories.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FLIP-FLOPPING back and forth between Tim Salmon, Eric Karros and
Green is beginning to wear me out. Before Monday night's game I
reminded Karros his average has dropped below .300, and I'm worried
now he will never recover. Karros said, "Work with me," and then
singled in his first at-bat. Green came by, and while I commended him
on having one more hit (35) than strikeouts (34) for the first time
this season, he said, "You've got me taking baby steps and you've got
Karros going for it all; what's with that?"</TE>
<TE>   Green hit into a double play in his first at-bat; his way, I
guess, of showing me he's not any different from Karros.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IF YOU tune into Dodger Talk on 1150, and you hear A. Martinez
talking, don't let him kid you--it's George Martinez. The Dodgers
require him to use his real first name on his media badge.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT MIGHT be worth it to go to a Spark game just to see Naomi
Mulitauaopele's name on the back of her jersey. Or maybe somebody can
take a picture and send it to me.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Steve Abrams:</TE>
<TE>   "Your finals' prediction of the Lakers against the Celtics may be
correct, but even a broken clock is right twice a day."</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to give you the time of day, but I can't.</TE>

<HD>Injury to Armas Leaves a Hole</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WARREN, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The loss of Chris Armas to injury has left United States Coach Bruce
Arena with a difficult puzzle to solve: Who to play in Armas' crucial
defensive midfield position?</LD>
<LD>   Arena had no time to experiment Monday, first because the truck
carrying all the U.S. team's equipment broke down on the New Jersey
Turnpike en route from Washington, and second because a thunderstorm
blanketed the area with heavy rain.</LD>
<LD>   That left Arena and assistants Dave Sarachan, Glenn Myernick and
Milutin Soskic with time to discuss the problem.</LD>
<TE>   Armas has been a fixture on the national team for the last three
years and started 14 of the 16 qualifying games that earned the team
its place in Korea/Japan '02. Sunday's 2-1 warmup victory over
Uruguay at RFK Stadium was his 46th appearance for the U.S. but
lasted only 24 minutes before he crumpled to the ground in pain.</TE>
<TE>   The injury was first believed to be a twisted right knee and Armas
played on for another eight minutes before being replaced by Pablo
Mastroeni. An MRI exam Sunday night, however, showed that he had torn
a ligament, thus ending his chances of playing in the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm extremely disappointed," he said. "It was a very odd play, a
movement I've made a thousand times. I had planted on my right foot
and I felt the knee go. In life, these things happen."</TE>
<TE>   The 29-year-old Chicago Fire and former Galaxy player also missed
the 2000 Olympics in Sydney because of an injury to the same knee.</TE>
<TE>   Armas, from the Bronx, returned home to New York on Monday, but
Arena made no immediate decision about calling in a replacement.
Among the options on his list of 10 standby players are midfielders
Brian Maisonneuve, Brian West and Richie Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Arena was surprised by the severity of the injury.</TE>
<TE>   "There was not even contact," he said Sunday. "There was no one
around him. It could have happened walking off a curb, in training,
whatever."</TE>
<TE>   Asked his immediate options in defensive midfield for Thursday
night's game against Jamaica at Giants Stadium, Arena offered four
names.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a number of guys who can play there," he said. "[John]
O'Brien, [Claudio] Reyna, [Tony] Sanneh and Pablo [Mastroeni]."</TE>
<TE>   Playing any of the first three there in the World Cup, however,
would mean having to replace them in their respective positions.
Using Mastroeni would solve that problem, but he has little
international experience. Sunday's game was only his ninth for the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team's final warmup game before leaving for South Korea
is against the Netherlands on Sunday in Foxboro, Mass. That game
became marginally easier Monday when Dutch striker Ruud van
Nistelrooy withdrew because of a groin injury. Van Nistelrooy scored
35 goals for Manchester United this season in the English Premier
League.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The United States was drawn to play England, Chinese Taipei and
Australia in the first round of the inaugural FIFA under-19 Women's
World Championship in Canada Aug. 17-Sept. 1. All three U.S. games
will be played in Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   Europe</TE>
<TE>   Portugal Coach Antonio Oliveira named the 23 players he will take
to the World Cup to play the U.S., Poland and South Korea in the
tournament's first round. Only three forwards--Pedro Pauleta, Nuno
Gomes and Joao Pinto--are included on the squad, the heart of the
Portuguese team being its midfield, which features Luis Figo of Real
Madrid, the reigning world player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Portugal will conduct a training camp from Saturday to May 29 in
Macau and will play its last warm-up game against China in Macau on
May 25 before opening against the U.S. on June 5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Valery Lobanovsky, one of the game's premier coaches over the last
quarter-century, died Monday at 63 of complications after brain
surgery in his home city of Kiev, Ukraine. He had been in poor health
for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Lobanovsky coached the national teams of the Soviet Union, the
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Ukraine in a career that spanned 44
years as player and coach. He coached the USSR to the bronze medal at
the 1976 Montreal Olympics and into the second round of the 1986
World Cup in Mexico. He was best known as coach of Dynamo Kiev, which
he led to numerous Soviet and later Ukrainian national championships
and European Cup Winners' Cup victories in 1975 and 1986.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Turkey is imposing limits on foreign media and has banished four
Chinese journalists, representing the Beijing Youth News and Chinese
state radio, from its training camp because they were asking too many
questions.</TE>
<TE>   "They were asking repetitive questions about the team's tactics or
players' conditions, as if they were trying to double-check things,"
said Can Cobanoglu, the Turkish squad's manager.</TE>
<TE>   Latin America</TE>
<TE>   Four-time world champion Brazil left from Sao Paulo for the World
Cup in a chartered airliner that will follow a roundabout route.
Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari's team will stop off to train and play
warm-up games in Barcelona, and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, before
reaching South Korea on May 27.</TE>
<TE>   Costa Rica left on Saturday and became the first foreign team to
arrive for the May 31-June 30 tournament, landing at Kansai
International Airport, near Osaka, Japan.</TE>

<HD>Ramos to Announce His Retirement</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEWARK, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Tab Ramos, considered the best U.S. soccer playmaker ever, will
announce his retirement at the end of the Major League Soccer season,
a source close to the league said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Ramos would not confirm the report in a telephone interview.
However, a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the
announcement would be made today.</LD>
<LD>   A news conference has been scheduled at St. Benedict's Prep in
Newark, where Ramos first burst onto the national scene as a
15-year-old playing for the United States in a qualifier for the FIFA
World Youth Championship.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's best to be left for tomorrow," Ramos said.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Uruguay and reared in New Jersey, Ramos appeared on the
U.S. World Cup team in 1990, 1994 and 1998 and had eight goals in 87
international appearances.</TE>

<HD>Levandusky Cut by Sparks</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sparks cut four players Monday, one from last year's team. But
they also welcomed to training camp one of last year's players, who
was playing in Europe, and added three free agents.</LD>
<LD>   The defending WNBA champions waived 5-foot-6 guard Kim Williams, a
two-year WNBA veteran who played with Utah in 1998; 6-1 forward Kelly
Siemon, who played on Notre Dame's 2001 national championship team
and was drafted by the Sparks but sat out last season; 6-1 forward
Jackie Higgins, the Sparks' second-round pick in the April draft; and
5-8 guard Nicole Levandusky, who was on last year's team.</LD>
<LD>   Levandusky was a second-round draft pick from Xavier. She played
sparingly with the Sparks in 2001, appearing in 13 games and
averaging 1.5 points as one of the last players off Coach Michael
Cooper's bench. Rejoining the team is 6-1 Vedrana Grgin Fonseca,
whose team in Spain finished its season.</LD>
<TE>   Invited to camp were Shala Crawford, Vicki Hall and Naomi
Mulitauaopele, players waived by Houston, Indiana and Utah.</TE>

<HD>Good Defense on Bryant Isn't Enough</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Short of having him detained by the Texas Rangers--the real ones, not
the baseball players--the Spurs believe they did all they could to
stop Kobe Bryant in the two games in San Antonio.</LD>
<LD>   Toss out the fourth quarters of Games 3 and 4, and the Spurs have
done a credible job of guarding Bryant. In Game 3, he needed 31 shots
to score 31 points. In Game 4, he missed 17 of 27 en route to 28
points.</LD>
<LD>   Trouble is, when Bryant and the Lakers needed a big basket, he
came up with one, and there didn't seem any way for the Spurs to
thwart him. Sunday, for instance, he made two three-pointers and the
winning layup to rally the Lakers from an 84-79 deficit to an 87-85
victory.</LD>
<TE>   Like Ruben Patterson before him, Bruce Bowen is having little
success defending Bryant. Like Patterson's Trail Blazers, Bowen's
Spurs will soon be on vacation if they don't find a way to contain
Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers hold a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series, with Game
5 tonight at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Gregg Popovich refused to fault Bowen, a former standout at
Cal State Fullerton, saying he's "thrilled with the way Bruce is
playing." Signed last summer as a free agent, Bowen has "made a
difference," according to Popovich.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone guarded him last year," Popovich said,
referring to the Spurs' inability to contain Bryant during the
Lakers' four-game sweep in the 2001 playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what the Spurs need to do to win tonight and force a Game 6,
Popovich said flatly, "We've got to play even more perfect,
especially in the fourth quarter."</TE>
<TE>   No part of their game needs to be "more perfect" than their
defense of Bryant down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reserve forward Danny Ferry has been a go-to guy for reporters,
particularly after Game 4, when the San Antonio locker room emptied
quickly after the Spurs' two-point loss. He certainly pulled no
punches about the Spurs' situation heading into Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   "They're playing good defense," he said of the Lakers. "We got
into another situation where we didn't execute down the stretch.
That's on the players. We've got to make the plays and execute down
the stretch."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have outscored the Spurs by 32 points in the fourth
quarters of the first four games in the series. The Lakers' late-game
effectiveness has been partly a result of their suffocating pressure
on Tim Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio went the final 6:58 without a basket Sunday. Bowen's
three-pointer from the corner gave the Spurs an 82-72 lead, but they
got only three free throws from Duncan the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   "Their strategy down the stretch was to make the guys around Tim
beat them," Ferry said of the Lakers. "We didn't get it done."</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs made three of 18 shots (16.7%) in the fourth quarter
Sunday. Duncan, who missed both of his shots, Ferry (0 for 3) and
Antonio Daniels (0 for 5) were among the noteworthy brick-throwers in
the final quarter.</TE>

<DH>Stevenson's 904 victories are only part of the story</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wanting to show up the official in front of the small gathering at El
Segundo High, George Brett laughed in disgust after being whistled
for a ticky-tack foul during a junior varsity basketball game.</LD>
<LD>   Sitting in the gym that winter day in 1969 was El Segundo's
baseball coach, John Stevenson, who waited until the first day of
baseball practice to lambaste his rising sophomore star for the
display of disrespect.</LD>
<LD>   "You'll never do that here," Stevenson barked. "You will respect
the game."</LD>
<TE>   Over his 43-year career, spent entirely at El Segundo, Stevenson
has 904 victories, the most of any high school baseball coach in
California. Yet, his biggest achievement has been the way in which he
has preached the fundamentals of baseball and citizenship,
emphasizing responsibility on the field and in the community.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Stevenson has instilled in his players his
unbridled passion for a game that has kept him youthful at 68,
charging out his front door with a sense of urgency for the six-block
walk to Recreation Park, where El Segundo plays its home games.</TE>
<TE>   "He taught me to respect the game and to always play hard," said
Brett, who went on to a Hall of Fame career with the Kansas City
Royals. "I think that's why I ended up playing 20 years in the major
leagues. I had more fun than anyone else, and it started with high
school.</TE>
<TE>   "I got used to winning and expected to win every time I went out
on the field."</TE>
<TE>   Winning has also been a constant for Stevenson, whose teams have
won six Southern Section and 27 league titles, but it is only a small
part of his story and he would like to keep it that way.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, when third base coach Gregg McMullin informed Stevenson
of a milestone victory by telling him he had reached 600, he
responded by asking, "Six hundred what?"</TE>
<TE>   Typical Stevenson. Always quick to deflect attention and spread
praise all around.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't want to take sole credit for something that so many
other people had a major hand in," Stevenson explained. "I didn't do
this. I was the person who was fortunate enough to be in the position
to have these things delivered to me."</TE>
<TE>   Stevenson attributes much of his success to El Segundo, a
tight-knit beach community of 16,033 recognized as much for its love
of baseball as its long-standing association with the Chevron
refinery that borders the city on the south.</TE>
<TE>   The small town has produced a disproportionate number of talented
baseball players who developed their skills through the equivalent of
a minor league farm system. Before reaching high school, they have
been schooled in the fundamentals by wildly successful Little League
and Babe Ruth League programs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like I get the polished product that has been nurtured since
T-ball," Stevenson said.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have followed Stevenson's career say he is a master
tactician who hasn't achieved 900 victories by simply tossing out
bats and balls.</TE>
<TE>   "It might sound easy, but you have to get the right guys in the
right spots," said West Torrance Coach Harry Jenkins, Stevenson's
longtime nemesis. "You also have to mold talent. He's consistently
done that more than anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Stevenson has transformed average players into good players and
good players into great players by simple means, such as hitting
infielders 150 balls a day. He has also mastered his players'
psyches, tearing them down by making them run sprints after mental
gaffes only to pump them back up by embellishing their abilities.</TE>
<TE>   "The key is making players believe they can play, even though they
might not be as great as their parents think they are," said El
Segundo assistant Craig Cousins, who played on two section
championship teams under Stevenson in the 1960s. "He's always had the
ability to say, 'You're my first baseman. You're not coming out.'"</TE>
<TE>   Stevenson's teams have averaged 21 victories a season, but glory
has been elusive in recent years. The Eagles finished the season
Thursday with a 9-6 victory over Culver City, raising their record to
13-15 but saddling Stevenson with consecutive losing seasons for the
first time in his coaching career.</TE>
<TE>   The losses do more than lower Stevenson's career winning
percentage of .721, said his wife of 32 years, Gail.</TE>
<TE>   "They eat at him," she said. "He thinks about what he could have
done differently. He'll come home afterward and ask, 'What do you
think the turning point in the game was?' He mulls it over in his
mind.</TE>
<TE>   "The team used to play on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and if it lost,
you hoped it was on a Tuesday because you only had to hear about it
for one night. If it lost on Thursday, you had to hear about it until
the next week."</TE>
<TE>   Gail didn't endure much second-guessing during the 1971 season,
widely considered to be Stevenson's best. That team, featuring Brett
and record-setting pitcher Scott McGregor, went 33-2 and captured
Stevenson's third section title.</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't feature the best of the four Brett brothers, at
least at the high school level. That distinction went to Ken Brett, a
pitcher and outfielder who was the 1966 section player of the year.
Stevenson called him the best player to come out of the South Bay
during his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   "When Ken pitched, you worried until you got your first run,"
Stevenson said. "Then you started thinking about where you were going
to dinner."</TE>
<TE>   Stevenson's favorite championship was the one he won with his son
Eric at Dodger Stadium in 1989. It is the one topic that brings tears
to the coach's eyes and makes his son's voice quaver with emotion.</TE>
<TE>   "To actually do it, and hug my dad after we won, was a phenomenal
feeling," said Eric, 30, a supervisor of human resources for a
telecommunications company in El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Stevenson is celebrated as much for his fairness and
integrity as he is for his championships. After El Segundo played
poorly in a victory over now defunct Lennox High, the Eagles returned
to Recreation Park to drop off their equipment. As the team bus
pulled up to the stadium, Stevenson ordered his players to run
sprints to atone for their sloppy play.</TE>
<TE>   Players rose from their seats only to be startled when the team
captain shouted, "Sit down!" The captain turned to Stevenson and
argued that a win was a win and that the Eagles shouldn't be
punished.</TE>
<TE>   "To John's credit," Cousins recalled, "the captain won."</TE>
<TE>   Stevenson has also drawn praise for a time he refused to back
down. After El Segundo reached the section's major-division title
game in 1979, section commissioners told Stevenson they wanted the
Eagles to play the final against Oxnard Hueneme at Pepperdine because
they felt fans wouldn't drive to Anaheim Stadium during a gas crisis.</TE>
<TE>   After a few days of haggling, the commissioners agreed to allow
the game to be played at Anaheim Stadium but moved the starting time
to the afternoon so that two lower-division teams could play in the
coveted nightcap to draw a bigger crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after El Segundo won, 5-0, Eagle and Hueneme players
gathered to unfurl a banner with a picture of a trophy and a message
telling section commissioners to "sit on it." Stevenson left the
trophy on the field in a spur-of-the-moment protest.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a very important statement that was made," Stevenson
said. "We had to stand up for our players, because our players had
earned the right to play in that stadium."</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo didn't get the trophy back until two years later.</TE>
<TE>   For all his success, Stevenson has never entertained offers to
coach elsewhere. "El Segundo, for me, is as good as it gets," he
said. "I guarantee I enjoy my coaching wins and practices just as
much as Mike Gillespie does at USC."</TE>
<TE>   Much has changed since the Manhattan Beach native who attended
Redondo Union High and UCLA took over the El Segundo program in 1960.
Stevenson has been around for so long now that senior catcher Steve
Eno calls him "the Lord."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the most significant changes Stevenson has witnessed have
been the advent of the aluminum bat and the proliferation of
weightlifting programs and specialized instruction. Stevenson labored
without an assistant coach until 1973.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he misses the old days on occasion.</TE>
<TE>   "You used to be able to just outwork other teams," Stevenson said.
"You could overachieve with your team because you had put in harder
work, longer hours. Today, I don't know that you can do that."</TE>
<TE>   Stevenson still puts in his fair share of work, but those who have
followed his teams over the years say he is slowing down. A heart
attack coupled with quintuple-bypass surgery in 1991 made the
white-haired coach rethink his priorities, and suddenly he questioned
whether baseball still topped his list.</TE>
<TE>   He started delegating more to his assistants, who noticed that he
had lost a little of his fire.</TE>
<TE>   Stevenson said he has no intention of retiring.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as they'll have me and as long as my health is good and
my fungo bat holds out, I'll be here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   George Brett is among those who hope Stevenson can close the gap
on Gene Schultz, the nation's all-time winningest coach with 1,299
victories and counting at Lansing (Iowa) Kee High.</TE>
<TE>   During his 1999 Hall of Fame induction speech in Cooperstown,
N.Y., Brett thanked Stevenson for teaching him how to be a winner.
Later, after the cameras stopped rolling, he turned to his old coach
and thanked him for much more.</TE>

<LD>After blowing fourth-quarter leads at home in Games 3 and 4, the
bottom line for the San Antonio Spurs is that they need a second
scoring option to complement Tim Duncan.</LD>
<LD>   David Robinson, Steve Smith, Danny Ferry and Terry Porter aren't
options; their best days are behind them.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Bowen and Malik Rose are better on the defensive end, and
Tony Parker and Antonio Daniels are too inconsistent as shooters to
be counted on.</LD>
<TE>   That's the main reason the Spurs find themselves one game from
being eliminated by the Lakers for the second consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   Although the best-of-seven series has been a lot tougher than the
Lakers probably expected, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Co. find
themselves right where they want to be heading into tonight's game at
Staples Center. A breakdown of Game 5:</TE>
<TE>   SPURS' MOVE--Coach Gregg Popovich has made a lot of good moves to
give his team a chance to win, but he blew it in the final seconds of
Game 4 by not having Parker on the floor and going with Porter.</TE>
<TE>   The result was a poorly executed play that ended with a weak
fadeaway attempt by Duncan that fell short at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   Parker and Daniels are the only Spurs other than Duncan who give
the Lakers a scare, because of their quickness and athletic ability.
When Popovich teamed them in the backcourt with Bowen at small
forward in the second quarter Sunday, the Spurs had the Lakers on the
run. Laker Coach Phil Jackson was forced to play seldom-used Lindsey
Hunter with Derek Fisher, and that's not a good backcourt mix for the
Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson was much more aggressive in Game 4, scoring 12 points and
grabbing 11 rebounds, but the Spurs need him to be more active on the
offensive boards. With Robinson on the floor, minutes have been taken
away from Rose, who has given the Lakers fits with his offensive
rebounding in the series.</TE>
<TE>   Although O'Neal has done a decent job at the free-throw line, the
Spurs are still not fouling him enough; he attempted only 10 free
throws in Games 3 and 4 combined. Remember, every time O'Neal shoots
a free throw is one less time Bryant has the ball in his hands.</TE>
<TE>   LAKERS' MOVE--Robert Horry, Rick Fox and Fisher continue to get
the job done in supporting roles to O'Neal and Bryant. They do not
score a bunch of points, but they do the little things that help the
Lakers win. They combined for six offensive rebounds in Game 4, the
same number grabbed by the Spurs' top three big men (Duncan, Robinson
and Rose).</TE>
<TE>   Now that Samaki Walker no longer starts, he has become a real
force off the bench. His eight points and six rebounds, including
four on the offensive end, in 19 minutes, were huge in Game 4.
Veteran reserve Brian Shaw's contributions are often overlooked
because he doesn't score much, but his ability to take care of the
ball (no turnovers in Games 2, 3 and 4) gives the Lakers stability
when he's on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   In the first half of Game 3, Parker ripped the Lakers for 20
points but since then, Fisher has been able to slow down the rookie.
Parker has missed 14 of his last 20 shots mainly because Fisher has
prevented him from going to his left, which is his better shooting
side.</TE>
<TE>   KEY POINT--The Spurs, looking to keep their season alive, can look
back to the first two games of the series for inspiration when they
left Los Angeles with a split.</TE>
<TE>   But Popovich can't afford to keep giving minutes to Smith and
Ferry, who have been doing little more than taking up space on the
floor. In the two games at the Alamodome, Smith made three of 13
shots, but that was better than Ferry, who missed all five of his
shots.</TE>
<TE>   One option for the Spurs may be former Clipper Charles Smith, who
saw his first minutes of the series in Game 4. Smith, who has been
sidelined because of a shoulder injury, is a good defender who played
well on offense during the regular season.</TE>

<LD>The New Jersey Nets are on the verge of playing for the Eastern
Conference championship, and by now, the whole world knows why. They
traded for Jason Kidd, the biggest acquisition in franchise history.</LD>
<LD>   But then Kobe Bryant soars above the Alamo in San Antonio for a
rebound, gently rolls in the winning basket, and he makes you cringe
about the one the Nets let get away.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant demonstrated Sunday how to take over a playoff game down
the stretch. He brushed off a lousy shooting day like dandruff and
carried the Lakers to victory in the final 90 seconds. His bravura
performance invoked the name "Michael Jordan" for many. Myself, I
thought about Kerry Kittles.</LD>
<TE>   As in, the guy the Nets drafted over Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   In hindsight, about a dozen teams blew it big-time six years ago,
so this wasn't exclusively a Nets' mistake. Still, they focused on a
shooting guard in 1996 and decided on Bryant, only to change their
mind at the 11th hour. They settled for Kittles, whose career is
defined by 42% shooting and a salary cap-choking contract, instead of
Bryant, whose career is defined by two rings going on three.</TE>
<TE>   Is there any doubt that Bryant could have resurrected a franchise
the way Kidd did this season? That's what John Nash, the Nets' former
general manager, thought as he and then-coach John Calipari weighed
their options with the eighth overall selection.</TE>
<TE>   "What's funny," Nash said Monday, "was we had dinner with Kobe's
family the night before the draft. His father, Joe, thought Kobe
would be a starter in his first year and an All-Star in his second.
We left dinner thinking Joe was a tad ambitious."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets had Bryant in for three workouts, each more impressive
than the other.</TE>
<TE>   The morning of the draft, Nash and Calipari met with owner Joe
Taub, who wasn't thrilled about the possibility of getting someone
fresh out of high school.</TE>
<TE>   Then the agents got involved. David Falk pressed Calipari to take
Kittles. Arn Tellem called and told Calipari that Bryant had no
interest in the Nets, even though, years later, Bryant said New
Jersey would have been fine. But the Lakers were working on a
draft-day deal with Charlotte, and playing in L.A. appealed more to
Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Calipari wavered, according to Nash.</TE>
<TE>   "I told John we should still draft him," Nash said. "But John
wasn't sure Kobe would turn out the way he did. You have to remember,
at that stage, no one from high school had really done it. Kevin
Garnett struggled at first. John was a little overwhelmed by the risk
involved."</TE>

swapping Vlade Divac for Bryant. Kittles gives the Nets 20 points on
a great night. Bryant gives the Lakers a shot to win it all.</TE>

me think, 'What if?'"</TE>

<HD>Zoning Curbs on Adult Video Parlors Upheld</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Local officials can bar two X-rated businesses from operating at a
single location, the Supreme Court said Monday in a case brought by
the city of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   On a 5-4 vote, the justices said that because a concentration of
adult businesses can bring crime and blight to a neighborhood, cities
can use their zoning power to allow only one such business in a
particular location.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling is a victory, but not a final one, for prosecutors in
Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Since 1995, they have sought to shut down adult businesses in
Hollywood and elsewhere that sell X-rated videotapes and also allow
customers to view these tapes for a fee.</TE>
<TE>   City inspectors said these dual services amount to two businesses,
not one, and therefore violate the zoning ordinance that requires a
1,000-foot separation between X-rated operations.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, the Supreme Court first gave city officials approval to
use zoning power to break up red-light districts in major cities.</TE>
<TE>   The case decided Monday did not appear to challenge the basic
principles set in 1976. Instead it called on the court to clarify its
meaning.</TE>
<TE>   But the closely divided opinion suggested that many of the
justices are still uneasy about the argument that this use of zoning
power is really about crime, not the sexual nature of the businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's ruling overturned a decision of the U.S. 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals, which said city officials had no evidence that the
two X-rated businesses in a single location brought more crime to the
area.</TE>
<TE>   Writing for the court in City of Los Angeles vs. Alameda Books and
Highland Books, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said common sense alone
was enough to justify the city's regulation. Many studies, including
one in Hollywood in 1977, showed that street crime is highest in
areas where adult businesses were concentrated, she said.</TE>
<TE>   City officials acted reasonably when they refused to "allow an
adult-oriented department store to replace a strip of adult
establishments," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But only four justices joined her opinion. Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy agreed only in part, so the issue will probably have to be
resolved in a trial in Los Angeles. The attorneys challenging the law
can try to show that there is no evidence that the video parlor
brings more crime to the area.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a narrow decision," said Deputy Los Angeles City Atty.
Michael L. Klekner, who defended the zoning ordinance. "The good news
is that we won in the Supreme Court. The bad news is that we have to
go to trial now."</TE>
<TE>   John Weston, the lawyer who represented the bookstores, said he is
confident of winning in a trial. "We believe we should prevail. The
evidence will not support the city's theory that this combination [of
adult businesses] in any way causes greater secondary effects."</TE>
<TE>   Siding with the city along with O'Connor were Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
Kennedy concurred in the result.</TE>
<TE>   The four dissenters said the ordinance amounts to discrimination
against a type of expression, not a true regulation of crime.</TE>

<HD>Santa Susanas Park Nears Reality</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Landfill firm fulfills decade-old promise by
deeding 1,080 acres to public.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 10 years of red tape, 1,080 forested acres in the Santa Susana
Mountains is set to become public parkland by late June, offering
visitors a shady refuge from heat and smog in summer and the
possibility of light snow sports in winter.</LD>
<LD>   The land, on the northern border of Los Angeles, has sweeping
native grasslands, oak groves and "views to everywhere on a clear
day," said Jim Park, an assistant director in the county Parks and
Recreation Department. "This is glorious property."</LD>
<LD>   Browning Ferris Industries, operator of Sunshine Canyon Landfill
near Granada Hills, is fulfilling a decade-old promise by deeding the
property to the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, a
regional parks agency.</LD>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, at the urging of county Supervisor Mike
Antonovich, the county required BFI to donate the land in East, Bee
and Rice canyons as a condition of granting a permit to expand the
adjacent Sunshine Canyon Landfill.</TE>
<TE>   BFI already owned about half the future park property but had to
buy the rest from numerous private owners. The final parcel was
purchased about six months ago, BFI spokesman Jim Aidukas said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, transfer of the parkland also was stalled by
litigation, environmental review and the sealing and cleanup of two
oil wells, officials said. Title documents are now being drawn up and
are expected to become final this month or early next month.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be one of the most beautiful parks we have in the Los
Angeles Basin," said Don P. Mullally of Granada Hills, who began
drumming up support for it 14 years ago. "It opens up brand-new
horizons for the hikers, mountain bicyclists, equestrians and
picnickers of Los Angeles County. The nice thing is that it's within
a short drive for many people."</TE>
<TE>   The unnamed new park has long been sought by open-space advocates
as part of an overall plan to create a "rim of the valley" open space
linking the Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys. The new parkland
fills in a missing link between Santa Clarita Woodlands Park on the
north and O'Melveny Park on the south. The result is a 6,000-acre
wilderness corridor.</TE>
<TE>   The corridor is vital for human recreation in a heavily urbanized
area and for the migration of wildlife, which includes deer, bears,
mountain lions, gray foxes and many smaller mammals, said Santa
Clarita City Councilwoman Laurene Weste.</TE>
<TE>   The neighboring Santa Monica and San Gabriel mountains are
overgrown with chaparral that is unpleasant for both animals and
humans to navigate, said Mullally, a former California state
naturalist who has done biological surveys of the Santa Susana
Mountains. The new park is a mix of savannas and woodlands, making it
attractive for family hikes, bird watching, mountain biking and other
activities.</TE>
<TE>   A marked trail system that hooks into a regional trail network is
already in place. Aidukas said BFI paid about $50,000 to hire
surveyors to create the system.</TE>
<TE>   The new parkland, reaching elevations higher than 3,500 feet, is 6
to 12 degrees cooler in summer than surrounding valleys, and
occasional winter snowfalls lend themselves to sledding and other
snow fun, Mullally said. Camping and trout fishing are also
possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   The unusually cool and moist microclimate, nurturing stands of
California black walnuts and other trees rarely found in the region,
makes the park special, Mullally said.</TE>
<TE>   Weste, a former Santa Clarita park commissioner, said the donated
property is also important because it helps preserve a vanishing
landscape. "This is some of the more important planning we will ever
do, because this is retaining natural California. There's nothing
joyous about constant concrete."</TE>

<HD>Man Gets Prison Term for Bilking Investors</HD>
<DH>Crime: Telemarketing firm salesman convicted in stock scam
is also ordered to pay $4.5 million in restitution. Two others
pleaded guilty to fraud.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The top-ranked salesman at a Canoga Park telemarketing firm that
defrauded investors across the county was sentenced Monday to 37
months in federal prison and ordered to pay $4.5 million in
restitution.</LD>
<LD>   Aldo Tarallo, 71, of Rancho Mirage and Lake Arrowhead, conned
victims into believing that they were investing in companies about to
go public, authorities charged.</LD>
<LD>   A federal jury convicted Tarallo in November on six counts of
securities fraud and four counts of mail fraud.</LD>
<TE>   In court Monday, U.S. District Judge Audrey B. Collins rejected a
defense plea that Tarallo be sentenced to home detention.</TE>
<TE>   Collins said Tarallo went to work for the firm Intellinet Holdings
"with his eyes wide open."</TE>
<TE>   The judge accused him of refusing to accept responsibility for his
misdeeds even after being convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Tarallo, who is free on $250,000 bond, was given until July 22 to
surrender to serve his sentence so that he can make arrangements for
the care of his seriously ill wife.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Richard Steingard said he would appeal the
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Steve Olson said investors across the country
lost a total of about $6.2 million in the scam.</TE>
<TE>   The firm's president, David Allan Colvin, 57, of Chatsworth,
pleaded guilty last year and was sentenced to 78 months in prison.</TE>
<TE>   John Larson, 51, of Beverly Hills, the sales manager, was
sentenced to 42 months in prison after pleading guilty.</TE>
<TE>   According to evidence presented during Tarallo's two-week trial,
the telemarketers touted investments in an assortment of companies
they claimed were on the verge of going public.</TE>
<TE>   The companies included one that supposedly could detoxify a drug
addict within 15 minutes and another that was developing a guide to
adult sex sites on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   To lend credibility to their claims, Colvin fabricated a company
named Wall Street Research Co., which generated bogus stock analyst
reports recommending the investments that he and his staff were
promoting.</TE>
<TE>   Olson said Monday that Tarallo took advantage of some victims
"again and again and again," knowing that they were surrendering
their life savings to a fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "The defendant's misrepresentations were blatant," he told the
judge.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor asked Collins to sentence Tarallo to 46 months
behind bars, the maximum under federal guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Collins decided, however, to follow the federal probation office's
recommendation of 37 months imprisonment, which is at the low end of
the guideline range.</TE>

<HD>Teen Suspect's Parents File Claim Over Her Death</HD>
<DH>Courts: Couple say detectives could have saved their
daughter, arrested in the slaying of another girl stabbed at a
Westside party.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The parents of a girl who authorities say fatally stabbed another
teenager at a Westside party last year have filed a wrongful death
claim against Los Angeles police, alleging that detectives doomed
their daughter by failing to seek medical help immediately after she
collapsed while in custody.</LD>
<LD>   The 17-year-old girl, Katrina Ava Sarkissian, was being questioned
by police on Nov. 18 when she passed out at the West Los Angeles
police station. She had been taken there on a murder warrant in
connection with the fatal stabbing the night before of Deanna Maran,
15, a Santa Monica High School sophomore.</LD>
<LD>   An autopsy revealed that Sarkissian had taken an overdose of
antidepressant capsules before she left her Brentwood home with
detectives. The claim alleges that she would have survived had the
two detectives who were questioning her immediately summoned
paramedics.</LD>
<TE>   The claim was filed Friday in the city clerk's office in downtown
Los Angeles on behalf of the girl's divorced parents, Angelique
Sarkissian Bernstein and Sarkis Sarkissian.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD had no comment. Officials with the city attorney's office
said it they had not yet seen the claim.</TE>
<TE>   The claim is the first public response from Sarkissian's parents
in a case that has attracted widespread media attention. A
state-imposed, six-month deadline for making a claim was looming.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a deadline that had to be observed, or their rights
would be lost," said Gary S. Casselman, their attorney. The claim
does not specify a damage amount.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Sarkissian's 15-year-old half sister was arraigned on
a battery charge in Juvenile Court. It was her scuffle with Maran
that triggered the stabbing.</TE>
<TE>   According to the claim, Sarkissian and her half sister were taken
into custody at about 1:55 p.m. at their home. By that time,
Sarkissian had already ingested what an autopsy revealed to be about
43 capsules, at 75 milligrams each, of nortriptyline, a prescription
antidepressant--twice the average fatal dose.</TE>
<TE>   The girls arrived at the police station no later than 2:15 p.m.
Sarkissian told Dets. Jim Hays and Kirby Carranza she felt sleepy. No
later than 2:30 p.m., the claim said, the girl collapsed. Hays and
Carranza, who are also named in the claim, tried to revive
her.Sarkissian's sibling, handcuffed nearby, begged the detectives to
summon help, the claim said. Instead, they asked, "How long do your
sister's seizures last?" The girl responded that her sister did not
have seizures.</TE>
<TE>   At an unknown time, paramedics arrived, but, the claim said, Hays
and Carranza told them to wait while they finished paperwork
connected with the case.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime before 3:05 p.m., the paramedics loaded Sarkissian into
an ambulance. They arrived at UCLA Medical Center about 3:15 p.m.,
where she was pronounced dead just past 5:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Other legal actions in the case are expected.</TE>
<TE>   "We anticipate filing a civil lawsuit not later than next week
against all of those whom we believe to be responsible for the death
of Deanna Maran," said Anthony Glassman, an attorney for Ilja and
Harriet Maran, Deanna's parents. Glassman said the Maran family is
considering suing Sarkissian's parents and the owners of the home
where the unchaperoned party was held.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To preserve more open space in the Santa Monica Mountains, a Los
Angeles City Council committee on Monday recommended allowing a
conservation agency to collect a special tax on homeowners from
Griffith Park to Topanga Canyon.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposed tax, which requires further approvals, the
Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority would collect money
from 40,000 to 50,000 mountain-area homeowners.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal calls for homeowners to pay up to $40 a year, while
business owners could pay more depending on the size of their
property. The money would go to a land-buying trust fund.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed assessment districts run roughly from the Golden
State Freeway in the east to Topanga Canyon Boulevard in the west,
and from Ventura Boulevard in the north to Sunset Boulevard in the
south.</TE>
<TE>   "We are rapidly running out of open space in the Los Angeles
area," said Councilman Jack Weiss, chairman of the Arts, Health and
Humanities Committee, which oversees park issues. "This is a means
that will allow us to preserve open space in the Santa Monica
Mountains to ensure it's not overdeveloped."</TE>
<TE>   Other California communities that have used assessment districts
as a way to preserve open space include Marin and Santa Clara
counties, according to the conservation authority.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, about 50 area residents attended the committee meeting
to support the tax.</TE>
<TE>   Many "are thrilled with this idea," said Jerry Daniel, the
authority's chairman. "Once we lose a piece of open space, it's lost
forever."</TE>

<HD>2 Council Members Push to Keep Sign</HD>
<DH>Secession: LaBonge and Miscikowski petition LAFCO to keep
the Hollywood landmark within L.A.'s boundaries in the event of a
city split.</DH>

<LD>Two City Council members pushed Monday to have the Hollywood sign and
the land around the Hollywood Reservoir remain in Los Angeles under
any Hollywood secession plan.</LD>
<LD>   Council members Tom LaBonge and Cindy Miscikowski introduced a
motion asking that the Local Agency Formation Commission exclude the
properties from the boundaries of a proposed Hollywood city. The full
council is expected to vote on the motion today.</LD>
<LD>   LAFCO's executive director, Larry Calemine, has tentatively
recommended that the Hollywood sign, about 500 acres around it and
another 500 acres surrounding the reservoir be shifted to the new
city if secession occurs.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power would retain
ownership of the reservoir itself.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine has yet to draft his final report on Hollywood secession,
however. LAFCO is set to vote in the next few weeks on whether to
place secession plans for Hollywood, the San Fernando Valley and the
harbor area on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge, who represents Hollywood, held a news conference Monday
at the foot of the sign to make his appeal to the council. The
acreage that he and Miscikowski want to keep in Los Angeles includes
a girls camp called Camp Hollywoodland, a wildlife corridor and a
water station and landing pad for Fire Department helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   The area is mostly west of Fern Dell Drive.</TE>
<TE>   "Splitting the land between two jurisdictions makes no sense,
practical, historical or otherwise," LaBonge said.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles will always keep this area as open space. There are
no guarantees if this land falls to another city."</TE>
<TE>   Gene La Pietra, a founder of the secession group Hollywood VOTE,
argued against LaBonge's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "The sign says Hollywood. It's in Hollywood, and it's not going
anywhere," La Pietra said.</TE>

<LD>Long Beach Airport Manager Chris Kunze has rejected an appeal by
American Airlines requesting four permanent "slots" at the facility.
The airline requested the slots earlier this year to fly to New York
and Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach Airport, which limits the number of slots available for
commercial flights to 41 because of a local noise ordinance, can't
allocate permanent slots to American because its remaining 27 slots
are promised to upstart JetBlue Airways. American will use temporary
slots to fly its new routes starting June 15.</LD>
<LD>   The carrier will appeal Kunze's decision to Long Beach City
Manager Henry Taboada.</LD>

<LD>A substantial earthquake shook the San Francisco area Monday night,
violently rattling the upper decks of the Compaq Center for about 10
seconds in the third period of a National Hockey League playoff game.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Geological Service reported that the quake struck at 9:29
p.m. and had a preliminary magnitude of 5.2, centered three miles
southwest of Gilroy, outside San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   The quake knocked out phone service in parts of San Jose and
caused a low rumbling in San Francisco, where it seemed to last for
several seconds and get stronger as it went along.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a pretty good swing," said a phone operator at the Hyatt
Regency in San Francisco who was flooded with calls from guests. "One
guy on the 15th floor said his room just started swaying."</TE>

<LD>Bay Area housing vacancies are back to 2000 levels and prices are
dropping after two years of sky-high rents spurred by the dot-com
boom.</LD>
<LD>   In San Francisco, the average price of a one-bedroom, one-bathroom
apartment is down almost 15% from last year's $2,172 to $1,848,
according to RealFacts, a housing research group.</LD>
<LD>   Bay Area rents skyrocketed from 1999 to 2001, with occupancy rates
up to 96.8%, RealFacts reported. But with the economic downturn,
occupancy rates have dropped to 93.2%.</LD>

<LD>   The state learned of the contamination more than three years ago,

the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board.</LD>
<LD>   The water board expects to release tests this week for about 40
wells. Most residents have been drinking bottled water.</LD>

<LD>A group of businesspeople is forming to look for ways to keep the San
Diego Chargers from being lured to Los Angeles by the prospect of a
new stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Ron Fowler, chairman of Mesa Distributing and head of the San
Diego Host Committee for next year's Super Bowl, said one possibility
for keeping the Chargers would be a public-private partnership to
improve Qualcomm Stadium or build a new one as part of a larger
redevelopment plan.</LD>

<LD>Investigations at East Bay reservoirs have resulted in citations for
asbestos-related safety violations.</LD>
<LD>   State regulators issued $3,350 in citations to the East Bay
Municipal Utility District for violations at Oakland's Central
Reservoir and Berkeley's Claremont Reservoir, including one deemed as
"serious."</LD>
<LD>   The investigation was the result of a complaint in March by Local

<HD>Odd Couple to Hit Road for Africa</HD>
<DH>Economy: Bono of U2, Treasury's O'Neill will tour the
continent on a fact-finding mission that could bolster economic
development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>One sings in sold-out stadiums and the other sings in the shower, but
when they take their show on the road they will become the "Odd
Couple" of international finance.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Hewson, better known as Bono, the black-clad troubadour who
fronts the Irish mega-band U2, and Paul H. O'Neill, the button-down
Republican who runs the U.S. Treasury, will leave next week on a
fact-finding expedition to four African countries.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Hope and Bing Crosby they're not. But in the long and storied
history of celebrity road shows, there's never been anything quite
like this.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a big piece of world theater," said Los Angeles record and
film producer Bobby Shriver, who arranged Bono's first meeting with
O'Neill. "Paul O'Neill is a tough guy who came up from nowhere, built
a business, worked his whole life. And now he's going to Africa for
10 days with a rock star? If someone came in with this as a movie
pitch, he'd get thrown out of the office."</TE>
<TE>   The trip will produce plenty of sound bites and photo
opportunities for an assortment of financial and entertainment
reporters, including an MTV camera crew. O'Neill has even promised to
don a pair of fly-eyed sunglasses to match Bono's trademark shades.</TE>
<TE>   It may not be high culture, but the intent is lofty. For 10 days,
the charismatic rock star and maverick Cabinet secretary will attempt
to focus the world's attention--and its money--on a continent where
poverty is endemic, disease rampant and economic growth elusive. If
their Felix Unger and Oscar Madison act succeeds, the final total
could make the $110 million brought in by last year's U2 tour look
like mere change.</TE>
<TE>   But they'll be working a tough crowd. Government leaders are
ambivalent, the aid community is apprehensive, and the American and
European publics seem largely indifferent. Much money already has
been spent, yet conditions in Africa continue to worsen.</TE>
<TE>   But backstage, 42-year-old Bono and 66-year-old O'Neill may not be
singing from the same page. Insiders said the two camps do not see
eye to eye on the best way to bring about change in Africa, and those
differences are likely to become more evident as the tour progresses.</TE>
<TE>   Although the overarching agenda is a noble one, the trip presents
an opportunity for each side to exploit its association with the
other.</TE>
<TE>   "We're Republicans, you know," said one administration official
who asked to go unnamed. "We're not known for reaching out this way.
In the popular world outside the Beltway, it's probably not a bad
image to have."</TE>
<TE>   For Bono and his allies, it's another opportunity to help shape
global development policy. "This is not radical chic," said one
associate, who also requested anonymity. "This is political power,
real political power."</TE>
<TE>   There is one thing both sides agree on: It's a marvel the trip is
happening at all.</TE>
<TE>   For several years, Bono has been making the rounds of important
people in Europe and America to promote the cause of Third World debt
relief. He has met with, among others, former President Clinton, Pope
John Paul II, British Prime Minister Tony Blair  and President Bush.
He brought Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to tears by relating biblical
passages to the plight of poor Africans.</TE>
<TE>   His notoriety may have opened doors, but it was his familiarity
with the complexities of global poverty, international finance and
domestic politics that made people pay serious attention.</TE>
<TE>   Bono's proselytizing contributed to passage of a $435-million debt
relief bill two years ago in the U.S. Congress. It was a factor in
Bush's recent decision to boost U.S. foreign aid by $5 billion over
three years to nations that embrace human rights, good governance and
open markets.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when Bono began knocking on the Treasury's door, O'Neill
regarded him as just another celebrity do-gooder promoting another
trendy cause. It took six months to arrange a 30-minute meeting, and
as Bono began his debt-relief spiel, O'Neill still had doubts.</TE>
<TE>   "The secretary cut right in, which people often don't have the
guts to do with a rock star," recalled Lucy Matthew, who accompanied
Bono to the May 2001 meeting. "The secretary just interrupted him,
and said, 'Have you ever been to Africa?'"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I have," Bono replied. Bono recounted the six weeks he and
wife Alison had spent working in an Ethiopian refugee camp following
1984's Band Aid and Live Aid fund-raisers. There was no publicity
involved; they went so they could see for themselves what conditions
were like.</TE>
<TE>   "The impression I got was that for O'Neill, that was quite a test
to pass," Matthew said. "After that, I think he kind of settled back
and thought, 'Well, good, at least he knows what he's talking about.
He's been there, he's seen it, he's worked there.'"</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill described a bauxite mine project in Guinea that he had
overseen as chief executive of aluminum producer Alcoa Inc. In the
blink of an anecdote, the two men bonded and joked about going to
Africa together someday.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, O'Neill's staff extended a formal invitation. A
trip was planned for last fall, but the Sept. 11 attacks intervened.
The discussions resumed this spring after Bono visited Africa with
Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs, participated with O'Neill on a World
Economic Forum panel, received four Grammys with his U2 bandmates,
performed at the Super Bowl, met with Bush in the Oval Office and
introduced the president at the unveiling of the $5-billion aid
initiative.</TE>
<TE>   But O'Neill's offer came with a challenge: Show me places where
aid has changed people's lives, not just lined their pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Bono hopes to do just that. In Uganda, one of the first African
nations to have some of its debt forgiven by wealthy nations, Bono's
camp plans to show how the money that would have gone for loan
payments was used instead to hire teachers, build classrooms and
expand primary school education.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no secret there are going to be some differences of
opinion," said Matthew, adding, "They'll be handled diplomatically."</TE>

<HD>Freed From Siege, Arafat Can't Escape the Pressures of
Politics</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Israeli tanks no longer surround the Palestinian
leader, but plenty of critics do.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NABLUS, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat toured the
battle-scarred West Bank on Monday, encouraging his people and
kissing babies' cheeks after the lifting of a ban on his movement
gave him his first opportunity to travel in six months.</LD>
<LD>   But even as he enjoyed freedom of movement, the Palestinian leader
found himself increasingly hemmed in politically. He's been slammed
by the U.S. and Israel for not ending suicide bombings, and by
hard-line Palestinians for agreeing to exile militia members and
otherwise "selling out" the cause.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush, Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon all
reaffirmed over the previous 24 hours their belief that a Palestinian
state should be established. As always, however, views vary widely on
how soon it should be established and how extensive it should be.</LD>
<TE>   In one sign of the growing pressure Arafat faces, he opted to stay
in his car Monday as it sped through the Jenin refugee camp, site of
a brutal battle between Israeli forces and Palestinian gunmen last
month.</TE>
<TE>   Jenin residents chanted the name of Mohammed Tawanbeh, a recently
killed member of the militant group Islamic Jihad, as Arafat's car
approached--a challenge to the Palestinian leader, given his recent
condemnation of violence. They also reportedly set fire to the
platform from which he was due to speak.</TE>
<TE>   Aides to Arafat attributed the fire to an electrical short. And
they said he didn't stop because the large crowds and danger of
unexploded bombs threatened his safety. Others said the real reason
was his reluctance to face his critics.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat is weakened and losing touch with the grass roots," said
Husam Khader, a leader from the Balata refugee camp and a member of
the Palestinian Legislative Council. "He's more afraid of real
democracy than he is of Israeli incursions."</TE>
<TE>   However, signs of dissent within Palestinian ranks were relatively
limited, at least in public, on a day when thousands turned out to
greet Arafat in cities hit hard by the Israeli military incursions.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat and his aides bypassed the many Israeli checkpoints that
have made travel difficult for average Palestinians by flying between
West Bank cities in a pair of Jordanian military helicopters before
transferring to motorcades.</TE>
<TE>   As he emerged from Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity,
theChristian site that was the scene of a 51/2-week standoff between
Palestinians and the Israeli military, Arafat said, "Being here after
the siege has been lifted brings pride to us all."</TE>
<TE>   The Bethlehem crisis was ended by a deal in which 13 Palestinians
considered extremely dangerous by Israel were exiled abroad. An
additional 26 seen as moderately dangerous were sent to the Gaza
Strip.</TE>
<TE>   In Nablus, Arafat was surrounded by crowds that cheered as soon as
his helicopter landed near a prison built by the British in the early
20th century and used successively by Jordan, Israel and the
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Yousef Hassouneh, a 42-year-old food shop owner standing along
Arafat's route, did not think that the Palestinian leader should be
back in his Ramallah headquarters working on his regime's many
organizational problems rather than glad-handing people.</TE>
<TE>   "On the contrary, his presence is good for morale," Hassouneh
said, holding a banner on the side of the dusty road that read
"Welcome Mister President, Symbol of Resolve."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat next headed into Nablus' casbah, the narrow network of
alleys, archways and tunnels where he viewed the ruins of a soap
factory destroyed by the Israelis, who suspected that it housed
Palestinian gunmen. He also viewed several houses farther up the hill
toppled by Israeli bulldozers in a bid to gain better access to a
densely packed area that dates back centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Ehsen Fahd, a 29-year-old graphic artist whose apartment lies
between the two sites, said the neighborhood's mood is one of despair
and frustration in the wake of the Israeli incursion.</TE>
<TE>   Fahd said a few of the Israeli actions seemed to have some rough
logic. Several armed men were seen in and around the soap factory,
for instance, including some outsiders seeking refuge in the dense
old city.</TE>
<TE>   But he claimed that far more cases involved the destruction of
homes, businesses and the lives of innocent people.</TE>
<TE>   As Arafat walked through the narrow alleys plastered with posters
of armed men killed in attacks on Israelis, the crowd jostled him and
chanted slogans. Nearby, 12-year-old Mais Nablusi clutched a speech
she hoped to read to Arafat. "He means everything to me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Others said he means less and less to them. "I'm not very happy to
see him," said Ghassan Thaman, a 30-year-old member of Arafat's Fatah
organization, , living in Nablus.</TE>
<TE>   Thaman said Arafat is surrounding himself with bad advisors and
has bowed too much to U.S. and Israeli pressure by agreeing to exile
for the militants involved in the Church of the Nativity standoff.
Those actions undermine the vigorous fight for a Palestinian state,
he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S., Russia to Cut Nuclear Arms</HD>
<DH>Treaty: Each nation's arsenal is to be reduced by
two-thirds in the next decade. The pact would put the Cold War firmly
in the past, Bush says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States and Russia agreed Monday to cut their nuclear
arsenals by two-thirds over the next decade, completing a treaty that
President Bush said "will liquidate the legacy of the Cold War."</LD>
<LD>   If confirmed by the Senate and Russia's State Duma, the treaty
will reduce the stockpiles of deployed nuclear warheads from the
current level of 5,000 to 6,000 on each side to a range of 1,700 to
2,200.</LD>
<LD>   Bush and Russian President Vladimir V. Putin are expected to sign
the pact next week in Moscow.</LD>
<TE>   "This is good news for the American people," Bush said. "It'll
make the world more peaceful and put behind us the Cold War once and
for all."</TE>
<TE>   Some experts, however, cautioned that the impact the treaty would
have on each country's ability to wage nuclear war might be less
significant than such a sizable reduction would suggest.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, although the agreement requires a sharp
reduction in the number of deployed warheads, none have to be
destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Experts anticipate that each country will dismantle many weapons.
But the weapons' plutonium can be reused, thousands of warheads are
expected to be in readily accessible storage, and each nation will be
allowed to withdraw from the treaty with three months' notice. Also,
the pact does not address the numbers of bombers, missiles and
submarines that can deliver warheads to targets on short notice.</TE>
<TE>   The treaty's most far-reaching significance may be to formalize
the dramatic change that has taken place over the last decade in the
U.S.-Russian relationship. Two countries with sufficient nuclear
weapons to destroy the world many times over are taking a large step
back from half a century of confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   "The new era will be a period of enhanced mutual security,
economic security and improved relations," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Putin said he was "satisfied with the joint work."</TE>
<TE>   He praised Bush for pressing for the pact's completion, saying
that "without the interested, active position of the American
administration and the attention of President Bush, it would have
been difficult to reach such agreements."</TE>
<TE>   Although diplomats began discussing the treaty in August, a White
House aide said, the push for the arms cut was given new impetus in
November, when Bush and Putin met in Washington and the president's
ranch near Crawford, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said then that the United States would undertake the cuts on
its own and that he saw no need for a treaty. Putin matched the
proposal with promised Russian cuts but said he wanted a formal
treaty to guard against a subsequent U.S. administration deciding to
ignore the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Putin got that document when U.S. and Russian negotiators finished
their work on it in Moscow early Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "A few months ago, the United States did not want to hear about
any legally binding agreement," said Andrei A. Piontkovsky, director
of the Independent Institute for Strategic Studies, a think tank in
Moscow. "The very fact that such an agreement is about to be signed
is a major victory of Russian diplomacy."</TE>
<TE>   The most recent arms control agreements were reached roughly a
decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   A strategic arms reduction agreement signed by then-President
George Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1991 set the
current limits of roughly 6,000 nuclear warheads per side. A second
agreement, reached less than two years later, would have cut the
weapons to no more than 3,500. But it never went into effect.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike those complex and lengthy treaties, the new agreement is
only about three pages long. It leaves to each side decisions about
how many warheads will be dismantled, how many will be placed in what
is called "deep storage" and how many will be kept on standby.</TE>
<TE>   Also, each country is free to determine its mix of weapons among
land-based missiles, submarine-based missiles and bombers. In the
White House view, this freedom demonstrated that the two countries do
not see each other as threats.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement leaves unresolved how compliance with the treaty,
which will require approval by two-thirds of the Senate, will be
monitored. However, it will draw from the 1991 pact, which requires
on-site inspections and military sites in each country.</TE>
<TE>   The signing of the treaty is likely to be the centerpiece of
Bush's visit to Moscow and St. Petersburg at the end of next week.</TE>
<TE>   While the agreement builds on the cooperative relationship Bush
and Putin have established, sore points remain between the two
countries. The Russians were angered by the recent U.S. withdrawal
from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty so that the administration
can work on a national missile defense system.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials remain concerned that Russia's aging nuclear
weapons are too loosely guarded to keep them from falling into the
hands of terrorists or other nations, and that Russia is turning its
nuclear technology into a cash-earning export.</TE>
<TE>   Initial reaction from Congress to the new treaty was positive.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, praised the agreement and said he hoped to begin
hearings on it this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the committee's senior
Republican, who in the past has been skeptical of arms control
agreements, was said by an aide to have no immediate objections.</TE>
<TE>   The pact could face a harder time winning approval in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Because Putin had hoped that the treaty would ensure that each
country would destroy some warheads, this failure could become a
political liability for him. Some retired military leaders already
consider him too accommodating to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Piontkovsky said, the treaty may encounter some
difficulty in the State Duma, where Putin can generally summon a
comfortable majority.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian president will face complaints "about the 'sellout' of
national interests," Piontkovsky said. He also said "the
military-industrial lobby will scream on every corner about the
unacceptable low level of ... warheads."</TE>
<TE>   Alexander A. Konovalov, president of the Institute for Strategic
Assessment, another think tank, agreed that confirmation may be a
problem in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   "Duma deputies are populists by nature, and they will do
everything possible to retain their posts and gain popularity,"
Konovalov said. "For them, any deal with the Americans is an object
worthy of criticism, since it's what the public likes to hear."</TE>
<TE>   Dimitri K. Simes, president of the Nixon Center, a Washington
think tank, said the pact "doesn't really commit either side to
things they weren't likely to do anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said that the Russians overcame Bush's initial
objections to negotiating a formal treaty.</TE>
<TE>   "You may be cynical and say, 'Who cares?' But clearly the Russians
were able to change the U.S. position literally 180 degrees," Simes
said.</TE>

<HD>Tape of Failed Defection Touches a Nerve in Asia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>Over and over, television news programs play footage of a pigtailed
2-year-old in pink overalls watching in terror as her mother and
grandmother, North Korean defectors seeking asylum at a diplomatic
mission in China, are wrestled to the ground and arrested by Chinese
police.</LD>
<LD>   If a picture is worth a thousand words, it is not surprising that
this image is setting off a diplomatic imbroglio and a larger debate
about the increasing number of desperate North Korean defectors who
are storming diplomatic compounds in China.</LD>
<LD>   The incident Wednesday took place at the Japanese Consulate in the
northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang. Japan's Foreign Ministry on
Monday demanded that China apologize for arresting people within a
diplomatic compound--a violation of international law--and turn over
the five defectors: the girl, her mother, father, grandmother and
uncle.</LD>
<TE>   South Korea offered to resettle the North Koreans if they are
willing to come here rather than go to the United States, their first
choice.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100,000 North Koreans are estimated to have fled north
into China to escape famine and political repression in their
reclusive Communist homeland. But China, in deference to its longtime
ally, hands them back to their own country.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts fear that if more North Koreans come to China, it
could turn into a mass exodus that would destabilize the entire
region.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, refugee advocates, Christian missionaries and
other activists have helped dozens of North Koreans seek refuge in
diplomatic compounds in China. In the past six days, 10 North Korean
defectors have made desperate bids for asylum in China. In addition
to the five at the Japanese Consulate, three defectors managed
Thursday to get inside the U.S. Consulate in Shenyang. Two others got
into the Canadian Embassy in Beijing on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The three at the U.S. Consulate left this morning for Singapore,
on their way to Seoul. The couple in the Canadian Embassy were
expected to follow shortly.</TE>
<TE>   Despite reports in the South Korean press that the family seized
at the Japanese Consulate would go to South Korea, their case had not
been resolved as of this morning.</TE>
<TE>   The pigtailed girl, Kim Han Mee, and her family have provided a
focus for concerns about the North Koreans. Their images have been
broadcast regularly on Japanese and South Korean television and their
photographs plastered on the front pages of newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   "They are just ordinary people, but their story is a microcosm of
all the troubles, all the hardships experienced by the North Koreans.
When you've met them, you have met them all," said Moon Kook Han, a
South Korean businessman who has been helping members of the same
extended family of North Koreans for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Those arrested last week are related to a defector now living in
South Korea, 17-year-old Jang Gil Su, who last year published a
harrowing book of crayoned drawings about the family's life in North
Korea. They are featured in his book and have been arrested several
times by North Korean authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "Given their background, if they are sent back to North Korea,
that will be the end of them. They will be killed," Moon said.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to rally international support for those arrested at
the Japanese Consulate, Moon on Monday released a short biography of
the family. In addition, a six-page statement handwritten by the
girl's mother, Lee Seong Hee, before the attempt to reach the
Japanese Consulate explained why they were seeking asylum.</TE>
<TE>   According to the account, Lee was five months pregnant in 1999
when she escaped North Korea with her husband and relatives by
swimming across a river into China. Like thousands of other North
Korean defectors, the family members thought they could find food and
relative freedom in China but instead ended up on the run.</TE>
<TE>   "Rumor was that there was plenty to eat in China, but we could not
stay in one place more than an hour because the Chinese authorities
were chasing us," Lee wrote.</TE>
<TE>   After her husband fell seriously ill from a rat bite, Lee was
faced a desperate decision: In order to raise money she had to agree
to sell the baby to a Chinese peasant family for $200 or go to work
in a tea house that was a front for a brothel. Although she had just
given birth, she chose the latter.</TE>
<TE>   "If the North Korean people could eat, dress, live like people in
other countries, we would not have to sell our baby or our body," Lee
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   She said in the statement that she and other family members would
like to go to the United States because they have a relative there,
but that she feared attacks by North Korean agents if they resettled
in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Nam Sim U, a South Korean-born architect who lives in Yardley,
Pa., said he has offered to sponsor the family along with the Defense
Forum Foundation, a Washington-based conservative group that has been
lobbying for the rights of North Korean refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Nam said they are not actually relatives, but "I consider
everybody in North Korea to be my family and my friend. We have to
help them."</TE>
<TE>   Chung In Moon, a political scientist at Yonsei University in
Seoul, said that the events of the last week are likely to force
China, Japan, the United States and South Korea to take a more
coordinated stance on dealing with North Korean refugees.</TE>
<TE>   "There needs to be some meetings about how to deal with the
possibility of a mass exodus from North Korea. That could be very
destabilizing for the region," political scientist Moon said. He also
suggested that refugee activists deliberately targeted the United
States for a recent asylum bid in order to involve the Bush
administration more deeply.</TE>
<TE>   The effort to penetrate the Japanese Consulate in Shenyang, like
others, appeared to be choreographed to gain maximum publicity. The
organizers rented a fifth-floor hotel room across the street to watch
the action and invited a Japanese television cameraman to film from
the window. But the plan quickly went awry.</TE>
<TE>   "The men were supposed to distract the guard while the women went
inside. But they were nervous. The men ran in first. The women were
slower getting through the gate and they were caught," said Moon, the
businessman-activist.</TE>
<TE>   As the camera rolled, Chinese police lunged for the women and the
2-year-old fell out of a baby carrier on her mother's back. The
mother and grandmother were dragged out of the compound and arrested.
Nearly an hour later, the Chinese police went into the compound and
brought out the men.</TE>
<TE>   China maintains that a Japanese vice consul in Shenyang authorized
the police to remove the North Koreans, which Japan denies. An
investigative report released Monday by the Japanese Foreign
Ministry, based on interviews with consulate staff, said: "There is
no truth that Japan gave permission to the armed Chinese police
officers to enter the consulate ground."</TE>
<TE>   But Japanese officials came in for domestic criticism for failing
to act quickly enough, and for the consulate's apparent bungling of
the matter. In the video, also played repeatedly on Japanese
television, a Japanese consular staff member was shown handing back
to the Chinese officers their caps, which had fallen off while they
struggled with the women.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese responded with their own criticism of Japan. "The real
reason behind the row is the swell of nationalism and increasing
rightist thinking within Japan," said a signed commentary on the Web
page of the English language China Daily. "Since the 1990s, Japan's
continued economic slump and China's rapid economic growth has caused
Japan's negative and hostile views of China to surface."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Valerie Reitman in Tokyo and special
correspondent Anthony Kuhn in Beijing contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Carter Doubts Claim of Cuba Bioterror</HD>
<DH>Policy: Ex-president suggests that the Bush administration
made misleading statements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HAVANA</DL>
<LD>Former President Carter challenged conservatives in the U.S.
government Monday to prove their charges that Cuba has developed
biological weapons technology and shared it with such renegade states
as Iran.</LD>
<LD>   On a five-day visit that marks the first time a current or former
U.S. president has set foot in Cuba since Fidel Castro's 1959
revolution, Carter threw himself into the ideological divide of
U.S.-Cuban relations. He met over breakfast with the Communist-run
island's two leading dissidents, then delivered a sharp broadside to
the Bush administration over the bioterrorism allegations.</LD>
<LD>   Carter even suggested at a forum that included Castro that Bush
administration officials misled either him or the American people
about those allegations.</LD>
<TE>   "In preparation for this unprecedented visit, I requested, and we
all received, intense briefings from the State Department, the
intelligence agencies of my country, and high officials in the White
House ... for them to share with us any concerns that my government
had about possible terrorist activities that were supported by Cuba,"
Carter said after more than two hours of briefings by Cuban
scientists at the country's premier biotechnology research center.</TE>
<TE>   "There were absolutely no such allegations made or questions
raised. I asked them specifically on more than one occasion: 'Is
there any evidence that Cuba has been involved in sharing any
information to any other country on Earth that could be used for
terrorist purposes? And the answer from our experts on intelligence
was, 'No.' "</TE>
<TE>   Just a few days before Carter and his delegation landed in Havana
on Sunday, Bush's undersecretary of State for arms control delivered
a well-publicized speech to the conservative Heritage Foundation in
Washington and asserted, "The United States believes that Cuba has at
least a limited offensive biological warfare research and development
effort.</TE>
<TE>   "Cuba has provided dual-use biotechnology to other rogue states,"
said the official, John R. Bolton.</TE>
<TE>   Carter said Bolton's speech, coming just before the former
president's visit, was made "maybe not coincidentally."</TE>
<TE>   En route to Iceland on Monday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
appeared to soften the allegation that Cuba is pursuing a germ
weapons program.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't say that [Cuba] actually had some weapons," Powell
said, "but it has the capacity and the capability to conduct such
research."</TE>
<TE>   Powell said that Bolton's words were "not a new statement" but one
that had been made before.</TE>
<TE>   National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice agreed that Bolton's
comments were nothing new.</TE>
<TE>   "There is plenty of reason to be very concerned about what the
Cubans are doing in this area," she told public television's "The
NewsHour with Jim Lehrer."</TE>
<TE>   Such weapons are "actually very easy to conceal, and you need
multiple measures to make certain that they aren't being developed
and transferred," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The bioterrorism charge--and Carter's entire visit--have become
the latest battlefields in the deeply polarized and emotional debate
about altering America's 42-year-old policy of isolating Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-Castro Cuban lobbies in South Florida and in Congress
have praised Bolton and condemned Carter for a visit they fear could
help legitimize the Cuban leader.</TE>
<TE>   The Heritage Foundation's Latin America specialist, Stephen
Johnson, accused Carter of being "the perfect foil" for a move in
Congress to ease America's economic embargo of the Caribbean island.</TE>
<TE>   "The former president has a gullible streak and, like the Sunday
school teacher he often resembles, looks for the best in some of the
world's worst leaders," Johnson said in an editorial on the
foundation's Web site entitled, "When Jimmy Meets Fidel."</TE>
<TE>   Castro spent hours on state-run Cuban television on the eve of
Carter's trip denouncing Bolton as a liar. He and other Cuban
officials assert that Bush appointed Bolton and Assistant Secretary
of State Otto J. Reich, the department's point man for Latin America
and a longtime Castro foe, to help his brother Gov. Jeb Bush win
Florida's Cuban American vote in his reelection bid this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press quoted Reich as saying that Carl W. Ford Jr.,
assistant secretary of State for intelligence and research, had given
some of the same information on the bioterrorism allegations to
Congress in March.</TE>
<TE>   In his welcoming statement at the Havana airport Sunday, Castro
invited Carter, "together with any specialists of your choosing" to
inspect any Cuban facility suspected of producing biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Carter, in his unplanned statement Monday at Cuba's sprawling,
ultramodern Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology,
interpreted the invitation as an offer to "any person who wanted to
come and investigate any allegations concerning this bioterrorism
issue."</TE>
<TE>   "My presumption and hope is that anyone who does have evidence of
this kind would take advantage of this offer," Carter said.</TE>
<TE>   Carter interrupted a briefing by the center's director, Dr. Luis
Herrera, to question him closely on a biotechnology-sharing agreement
Cuba has with Iran, where Cuban scientists are building a biotech
plant that will open in a year.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to the scientific briefings, which included information on
decades of Cuban research into meningitis vaccines, cloning cows and
finding a cure for AIDS, Carter took a step toward balancing the
image of his visit.</TE>
<TE>   He had breakfast in his hotel in a renovated section of Havana's
Old City with Cuba's most prominent democracy advocates, Elizardo
Sanchez and Oswaldo Paya.</TE>
<TE>   Paya has spent the last year gathering 11,020 signatures on a
petition calling for a referendum to establish the rights to free
speech and assembly, to institute election reform and to declare
amnesty for Cuba's estimated 250 political prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Paya's Varela Project, named after a Roman Catholic priest from
Cuba, culminated Friday, when he presented the signed petitions to
Cuba's National Assembly, which now must decide the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts here speculate that Carter, in a further effort
to garner credibility for his visit, will endorse the petition drive
and call for more freedoms when he delivers an unprecedented, live
televised address to the Cuban nation from Havana University tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Carter's visit will be good for the Cuban people," Paya
told reporters after their meeting. "He is a man of dialogue and a
man who builds bridges."</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez was more guarded.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope both governments make the most out of this situation at a
time when relations couldn't be worse," he said in the Spanish
colonial plaza outside Carter's hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "But I do not hide my skepticism. I'm not expecting a miracle. It
all depends on whether they [Cuban officials] listen."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Paul Richter in Reykjavik, Iceland, contributed
to this report.</TE>

<DL>MADRID</DL>
<LD>Spain's high court on Monday convicted and sentenced 17 members or
collaborators of the violent Basque separatist group ETA, in a
victory for authorities who have been cracking down on the outlawed
organization.</LD>
<LD>   Among those sentenced was Inaki Bilbao, who received a 101-year
term even though the maximum sentence one can serve in Spain is 30
years, court sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The other 16 sentences added up to 283 years.</LD>
<TE>   Bilbao and the others were arrested in 1998 when police broke up
an ETA cell in Vizcaya, one of three provinces that make up Basque
country in northern Spain.</TE>
<TE>   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, is listed as a
terrorist organization by the European Union and the U.S. It has
killed more than 800 people since 1968 in its drive for an
independent state in Basque areas of northern Spain and southwestern
France.</TE>

<HD>EU Hosts to Treat Militants as Refugees</HD>
<DH>Relocation: Palestinians involved in Bethlehem church
standoff will be sent to six countries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BRUSSELS</DL>
<LD>Thirteen Palestinian militants freed after a standoff at Bethlehem's
Church of the Nativity will receive refugee status in their host
European nations and will not be arrested or detained, European Union
officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Six EU nations--Belgium, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and
Spain--are ready to take the Palestinians to help defuse tensions in
the Middle East, said Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Pique, whose
country currently holds the EU presidency.</LD>
<LD>   "Six countries have explicitly said they are prepared to let these
people into their territory," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Officials will work out their residency details this week in hopes
of relocating the 13 men by the weekend, said Pique, who chaired a
meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Refugee status in many EU nations comes with a monthly stipend,
shelter and clothing provisions, and the possibility of family
reunions.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not going to be arrested or detained," Pique told
reporters. "These people are classified as terrorists by Israel, but
there are no outstanding cases against them in Europe."</TE>
<TE>   Pique said Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority has given
guarantees that the 13 militants "will comply with the laws of their
host countries." Pique did not elaborate about how such a guarantee
could be made or honored.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve of the men were staying at a seaside hotel near the Cypriot
city of Larnaca under police protection, while the 13th has been
hospitalized with a broken leg.</TE>
<TE>   Although Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres suggested over the
weekend that Israel might seek the extradition of the 13, whom it
calls senior terrorists, Pique insisted that the Israeli government
has, in fact, formally promised not to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Senior EU officials were to sort out an arrangement ensuring that
the 13 men will receive the same treatment no matter where they end
up, EU spokeswoman Anna Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   The men were among dozens of Palestinians who ran into the Church
of the Nativity on April 2 to flee advancing Israeli troops and
remained there for more than five weeks. The military operation
followed a wave of suicide bombings in Israel. The standoff was ended
by an EU-brokered deal.</TE>

<HD>PRI Mayoral Hopeful Wants a Recount in Ciudad Juarez</HD>
<DH>Mexico: With 2% of ballots left to tally, PAN candidate has
slight lead in second try for office.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>The rerun of last summer's Ciudad Juarez mayoral election is proving
as close and contentious as the first round, with one side declaring
victory, the other demanding a recount and a razor-thin margin
separating the candidates.</LD>
<LD>   By late Monday, Jesus Alfredo Delgado, the National Action Party
candidate whose victory last July was overturned because of campaign
irregularities, had 137,614 votes, or 46.5%, with all but 2% of the
ballots cast Sunday counted. He led Roberto Barraza of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, by a mere 2,365 votes.</LD>
<LD>   A final count is expected by Wednesday night, but PRI campaign
spokesman Jose Acosta said Monday that his party was already
demanding that the state election commission recount about 12,000
disallowed votes to make sure they should have been disqualified. "We
aren't talking about irregularities because at the moment we don't
know of any," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Luis Felipe Bravo Mena, president of the National Action Party, or
PAN, nevertheless declared victory Monday, sending a "strong, sincere
and profound congratulations to the people of Juarez" for choosing
Delgado, "who for a second time has won the election."</TE>
<TE>   Delgado's victory over Barraza in July was overturned by a state
electoral tribunal because of his party's improper use of campaign
advertising across the border in El Paso.</TE>
<TE>   Although both parties stressed that the Ciudad Juarez election was
strictly local in its implications and should not be construed as a
barometer of the electoral mood in the rest of Mexico, a loss would
be disappointing for the PRI.</TE>
<TE>   The former ruling party, which lost the presidency for the first
time in 71 years to the PAN's Vicente Fox in 2000, had hoped to
capitalize on the previous PAN mayor's inability to solve a string of
slayings totaling 250. The border city's acute economic slowdown was
also seen as giving the PRI an edge.</TE>
<TE>   But the relatively weak performance by the PAN in its electoral
stronghold showed that the party may be losing momentum after more
than a decade of gaining power in local elections such as the Juarez
race, said David Shirk, a political scientist at Soka University in
Aliso Viejo, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   "We are seeing gradually declining rates of turnout and narrowing
margins of victory for the PAN in the northern states in Mexico. The
PAN could be satisfying voters so greatly that, like U.S. voters,
they are not voting," Shirk said.</TE>
<TE>   "Or you could say that the PAN model for municipal governance is
becoming exhausted, that they don't know what to do now that they
have taken care of the obvious egregious stuff left behind by the
PRI, like cleaning up the padded municipal payrolls and building a
tax base that works," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The number of PAN mayors in Mexico went from 18 in 1982 to 250 in
the mid-1990s, Shirk said, but the gains are leveling off.</TE>
<TE>   The PRI had hoped that an electoral alliance formed with the
Workers and Green parties--the first such alliance in its
history--would give it victory in Mexico's biggest border city as
well as a boost going into next year's midterm elections, which will
include races for six governorships.</TE>

<HD>Treaty's Dark Side: Threat of Terrorism</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>To generations who came of age during the Cold War, the nuclear arms
agreement announced Monday by U.S. and Russian officials has the ring
of a once-impossible dream.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of nuclear weapons would be removed from arsenals that
defined decades of hostility between the United States and the former
Soviet Union.</LD>
<LD>   But the agreement encountered immediate criticism that it fails to
address the more realistic, post-Cold War threats that the United
States faces. In particular, arms control experts said the treaty
would raise the likelihood that warheads would find their way into
the hands of terrorists or rogue nations because the Bush
administration insisted that both countries be allowed to achieve
reductions by storing--rather than dismantling--their nuclear
weapons.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, thousands of Russian warheads that might have been
permanently disabled under a more aggressive treaty could instead be
moved into storage facilities whose security is rated uncertain at
best, even by the administration's own recent intelligence
assessments.</TE>
<TE>   "Reducing nuclear weapons on both sides is a good thing," said Ivo
H. Daalder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a
nonpartisan think tank in Washington. "But we may be no more secure
after this agreement has been implemented than we are today."</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the treaty, which must be approved by the U.S.
Senate and the Russian Duma, the two countries would over the next
decade reduce their stockpiles by two-thirds, to 1,700 to 2,200
warheads apiece.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement leaves it to the countries to determine how they
would make those reductions. A White House official who asked not to
be identified said the Pentagon is responsible for working out
details of U.S. compliance. Some of the U.S. weapons would be
dismantled, the official said, but others would be placed in "deep
storage" or set aside as "operational spares."</TE>
<TE>   Weapons placed in the latter category would not be available for
immediate use on submarines or bombers or in silos, but they could be
quickly redeployed.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has not spelled out specific scenarios in which it
envisions a redeployment of stored nuclear weapons, and arms control
advocates have said it's hard to envision circumstances in which
2,200 warheads would be inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bush administration insisted that the treaty allow
flexibility for "uncertain security environments" in the future. The
three-page accord also contains a clause allowing either side to exit
the agreement entirely with three months' notice.</TE>
<TE>   That aggressive posture scored points with conservatives, making
the proposed treaty palatable to some who have questioned the need
for any arms control negotiations in an era when the United States is
the world's sole superpower.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the least bad outcome," said Frank Gaffney Jr., president
of the conservative Center for Security Policy and a former Pentagon
official.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and Russia had been pursuing the treaty for much
of the last year and until recently disagreed sharply over how far to
go in taking weapons offline.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, whose economic troubles have strained its ability to
maintain its arsenal, had pressed for language that would have
required weapons to be dismantled. But Russia had little bargaining
power in negotiations that often highlighted the growing disparity
between the two countries' fortunes since the end of the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   Though Russia preferred dismantling weapons, President Vladimir V.
Putin is now likely to feel politically compelled to maintain parity
with the United States by storing an equal number of warheads,
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the United States is storing rather than dismantling its
weapons, it will be hard for the Russians to [do otherwise]," said
Robert Einhorn, a former U.S. assistant secretary of State for
nonproliferation.</TE>
<TE>   But Russia's ability to safeguard its nuclear arsenal has come
under increasing doubt.</TE>
<TE>   A report by the National Intelligence Council--a panel
representing U.S. spy agencies--concluded that Russia's security
system "was designed in the Soviet era to protect weapons primarily
against a threat from outside the country and may not be sufficient
to meet today's challenge of a knowledgeable insider collaborating
with a criminal or terrorist group."</TE>
<TE>   The report says that security at Russian facilities is already
being tested. Russian authorities, according to the document, have
"twice thwarted terrorist efforts to reconnoiter nuclear weapons
storage sites" in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Russia's nuclear weapons storage sites "remain off-limits
to U.S. officials," meaning their security conditions have never been
evaluated, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   And economic turmoil in Russia continues to erode its ability to
safeguard its arsenal. In some cases, guards at nuclear facilities
have gone months without pay, and others have launched hunger strikes
to demand better working conditions.</TE>
<TE>   All of which makes Russia's vast nuclear weapons infrastructure
vulnerable to organized crime and terrorist groups who could
theoretically sneak out a warhead in a small pickup truck, experts
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The longer those warheads sit around in Russia, the greater the
chance that they get lost or sold," said Tom Z. Collina, director of
the global security program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.</TE>
<TE>   Dismantled warheads also pose a security risk. Their component
parts could still be used to reconstruct a warhead or a "dirty" bomb
in which radioactive material is dispersed by a traditional explosive
device. But the threat would be greater if thousands of Russian
warheads went into storage intact, Collina and others said.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly it's good to take the arsenals down by two-thirds,"
Collina said. "But this treaty leaves unanswered the question of what
happens to the warheads once they're off the missiles."</TE>

<DL>MONROVIA, Liberia</DL>
<LD>Rebels advancing on Liberia's capital launched what the government
said was their closest attack yet Monday, sowing panic in the city
with the distant rumble of mortar and artillery.</LD>
<LD>   With salvoes echoing just 15 miles away, frightened merchants
shuttered shops and rushed home to hide, crossing paths with frantic
parents rushing out in search of their children.</LD>
<LD>   President Charles Taylor, a former warlord who fought his way to
power, went on the radio at midday, voicing reassurance--and
defiance.</LD>
<TE>   "We are not even close to being defeated," Taylor said on his
private radio station.</TE>
<TE>   Panic broke out early in the day as artillery and mortar blasts
could be heard in Arthington, the nearby town where Taylor was born.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said fighting was still going on there at midday, as well
as in Gbarnga, the central town that served as one of Taylor's bases
in the 1989-96 civil war. Gbarnga was the first site targeted last
week when the rebels launched their latest attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Military vehicles rolled through rapidly emptying streets in
Monrovia, loaded with blue-jean-clad young government fighters
bristling with rocket launchers.</TE>
<TE>   "What is this, again? Where can we go, again?" cried one woman,
abandoning her stall to scurry indoors.</TE>
<TE>   A father pounded on the door of an elementary school, locked by a
frightened principal to keep children from fleeing.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't you know Monrovia is on fire?" the distraught father
yelled.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels have revealed little about their means or their
identity--only their aim: toppling Taylor.</TE>

<HD>Palestinians Struggling With Course of Reform</HD>

<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's demand that the Palestinian
Authority reform itself from top to bottom poses this dilemma for
Palestinians: What to do when you love the message but hate the
messenger?</LD>
<LD>   As they pick through the wreckage of their state-in-the-making
after Israel recently ended its six-week sweep of the West Bank, many
Palestinians are blaming Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat for failing to defend them or save their cities from temporary
reoccupation. In an increasingly public way, they agree with Sharon
and President Bush that the time for change is overdue.</LD>
<LD>   Would-be reformers say they would like to see Arafat forced to
restructure his bureaucracy, institute financial accountability and
hold new elections. But even the Palestinian leader's harshest
critics want Palestinians deciding what needs to be changed and how
to do it. They don't want to be told by their most hated enemy.</LD>
<TE>   "Maybe this time, the demand for reform is different," said Ziad
abu Amr, a Palestinian legislator from the Gaza Strip. "If we don't
do it ourselves, it may be forced on us, and it won't be to our
liking.</TE>
<TE>   "We are worried because the kind of reform the Palestinian
nationalists want to see is not compatible with what Bush and Sharon
want," Abu Amr said in a recent interview in Gaza City. "They want to
solve security interests. We want to address Palestinian political
interests."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon and Bush apparently want a Palestinian Authority that will
jail gunmen and sign a peace accord with Israel. Many Palestinians
want an authority that will stand up to Israel, back armed struggle
and implement the will of the people.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were a democracy in Egypt, it is reasonable to assume
that we would not have a peace agreement with it," Israeli political
analyst Hemi Shalev wrote in the newspaper Maariv. "Israel's supreme
interest is not to confer rules of proper administration on the
Palestinians but to establish a regime that wants and is capable of
reaching an agreement with Israel."</TE>
<TE>   The United States and Israel, Abu Amr and other Palestinians
allege, helped set up the Palestinian Authority as an autocratic and
corrupt regime that has routinely violated the human rights of its
citizens. Why should Palestinians believe that Washington and the
Israelis are now truly interested in democratic reforms?</TE>
<TE>   "A democratic Palestinian Authority would make Palestinians more
insistent on human rights, on ending the occupation and on achieving
a fair political settlement," Abu Amr said. Such a government, he
said, would cause headaches for any Israeli government because
Israelis "have a vision they want to impose on Palestinians" of a
final agreement.</TE>
<TE>   'Mixed Feelings'</TE>
<TE>   Watching Arafat tour Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity on Monday
for the first time since a 39-day standoff there between the Israeli
army and Palestinian gunmen was resolved, Palestinian entrepreneur
and legislator Daoud Zeer said that, whatever the impetus, reform
must come quickly.</TE>
<TE>   More than 19 months of fighting have reduced the once-bustling
pilgrimage city to a garbage-strewn ghost town of empty hotels and
restaurants. Local businesses have died and foreign investment has
disappeared, Zeer said.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we have to fix our home from the inside," he said. "We
have to change and reconstruct, or we won't have stability."</TE>
<TE>   For decades, first as leader of the Palestine Liberation
Organization and later as president of the Palestinian Authority,
Arafat has resisted every call for reform.</TE>
<TE>   He has led his people from disaster to disaster--the PLO's 1970
expulsion from Jordan, its 1982 expulsion from Beirut and its
near-consignment to political oblivion after he chose to back Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. But Arafat has
beaten back every demand that he loosen his autocratic grip on power.</TE>
<TE>   "The mixed feelings toward Arafat among Palestinians have been
evident all along," said Said Zeedani, director general of the
Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens' Rights, a human
rights organization with offices in Gaza City and the West Bank town
of Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the unchallenged, recognized leader. But at the same time,
there has always been criticism, particularly when it comes to
institution-building--there, he's the antihero."</TE>
<TE>   A Broken Bureaucracy</TE>
<TE>   Now, Arafat's bureaucracy is a shambles. His security services are
in disarray, with the various chiefs openly sniping at one another
and vying for power. Reconstruction efforts have hardly begun, and
Israel is still threatening to duplicate its massive West Bank
operation in the Gaza Strip if Palestinian militants resume attacks
inside Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinian people are fed up," said Ali Jirbawi, a
Palestinian political scientist at Bir Zeit University in the West
Bank. "See how many people greeted him today in Bethlehem, in Jenin?
The crowds were not large and not loud. People feel that everything
has collapsed, and they blame internal corruption."</TE>
<TE>   Against that backdrop, what had mostly been griping around
Palestinian dining room tables and in coffeehouses about the widely
perceived corruption and incompetence of the Palestinian Authority is
now a lively debate in the Palestinian press and political circles.</TE>
<TE>   And some senior officials are joining the chorus of complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "The sooner reform is carried out, the better the Palestinian
society will be," said Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, known by his
nom de guerre, Abu Mazen. "Delaying the reform means consolidating
the present situation, which means that we will not be able to win
any political or security or economic battle," Abbas said in an
interview with the East Jerusalem Arabic newspaper Al Quds.</TE>
<TE>   Abbas said the PLO leadership is holding a series of what he
called "intensive" meetings with Arafat, discussing "the means of
repairing the malfunction that occurred during the 34 days of
occupation [around Arafat's headquarters in Ramallah]. We do not want
the chaos that occurred to reoccur."</TE>
<TE>   Abbas has joined reformers in calling for elections for a new
Palestinian Legislative Council and municipal leaders within a few
months as a first step toward building real political institutions.
But beyond holding elections, few of the supporters of reform can
offer concrete proposals for how to strengthen democracy and end
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "That is what is missing from the discourse: the mechanics of how
we will make reforms happen," Zeedani said.</TE>

<LD>   The group, B'Tselem, said the Jewish state had "stolen" tens of
thousands of acres of Palestinian land to establish the
settlements--considered illegal under international law--for hundreds
of thousands of Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the intentional plan of the development and location of the
settlements ... precisely to prevent any sort of viable Palestinian
state," said Jessica Montell, the group's director.</LD>
<TE>   B'Tselem released what it described as the most detailed maps yet
showing how Arab towns and villages were hemmed in by Jewish
settlements and a network of roads leading to them. The carved-up
territories present a major roadblock in the search for a lasting
Israeli-Palestinian peace, the group said.</TE>
<TE>   B'Tselem called on the Israeli government to vacate all
settlements and compensate settlers who move to communities within
Israel's borders.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who as housing minister in
former Israeli governments was  an architect of the country's
settlement policy, recently dismissed such suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   "No settlement will be evacuated," Sharon said. "Such an
evacuation would only encourage terrorism and increase the pressure
on us."</TE>
<TE>   Settlers, who live on less than 2% of built-up areas, now control
42% of West Bank land, according to B'Tselem. Palestinians, on the
other hand, are systematically denied building permits and prevented
from expanding their communities, the group said.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel has created in the occupied territories a regime of
separation ... basing the rights of individuals on their
nationality," B'Tselem stated. "This regime is the only one of its
kind in the world, and is reminiscent of distasteful [ones] from the
past, such as the apartheid regime in South Africa."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Yesha Council, the main settlers group, poured
scorn on B'Tselem's findings.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that settlers controlled "only" 42% of West Bank land, the
spokesman said: "It's regrettable that the settlement movement has
not managed to implement the Zionist vision to settle between the sea
and the Jordan at a much [faster] pace."</TE>
<TE>   According to B'Tselem, about 247,000 settlers lived in the West
Bank in 1993, the year Israeli and Palestinian leaders signed an
interim peace accord. Their numbers grew to 380,000 by the end of
2001.</TE>
<TE>   But their homes could be affected by future peace agreements.
Palestinians, who view settlements as the embodiment of illegal
occupation and obstacles to a future state, have in previous
proposals called for their dismantlement. Palestinian militants say
Jews who live in the settlements are fair targets.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Bush administration called on Sharon to stop
building settlements. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who is
trying to get regional leaders to attend a Middle East peace
conference this summer, said this month that "something will have to
be done about the settlements that are there now."</TE>
<TE>   Under Sharon, 34 new settlements have sprouted on hilltops in the
West Bank, according to a recent report by Peace Now, which tracks
settlements.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of Peace Now and B'Tselem have criticized the Israeli
government for giving settlers attractive financial
incentives--loans, tax breaks and government grants--to move to the
West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   But other settlers don't need any financial lure. They move to the
West Bank because they believe it's part of the land that, according
to their scriptures, God granted to the Jewish people. Israel
captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967, then turned over parts
of the territories to Palestinian control during the peace process of
the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Yitzhak Pindrus, the mayor of Beitar Ilit, a settlement of 25,000
mainly Orthodox Jews near Jerusalem, said B'Tselem's report was
flawed.</TE>
<TE>   "B'Tselem should focus on human rights abuses, not real estate
problems," Pindrus said. "There's no reason why Jews shouldn't live
in Arab communities and enjoy good relations."</TE>

<HD>U.S., British Troops Destroy Munitions, Combat Militants</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: American Special Forces kill five in a
firefight in the south, while Royal Marines eliminate resources in an
eastern valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>U.S. and British forces both declared successes Monday in the
two-steps-forward, one-step-back war to eradicate Taliban and Al
Qaeda forces in Afghanistan, even as they were targeted again from
the enemy's relocated mountain strongholds.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. troops on a mission in eastern Afghanistan to hunt down those
responsible for menacing their base near Khowst airport with sporadic
rocket fire found the launch sites but none of the perpetrators.
Meanwhile, two more rockets were fired in the vicinity of the troops.</LD>
<LD>   In southern Afghanistan, U.S. Special Forces killed five suspected
Al Qaeda or Taliban militants in a firefight in the hometown of
Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar.</LD>
<TE>   British-led Operation Snipe wrapped up after 16 days with an
impressive scorecard of dozens of collapsed caves, tons of destroyed
ammunition, and strategic transit routes now sealed by Afghan allies.
The 1,000-strong force, backed by U.S. air power, scoured nearly 80
square miles of the rugged Chumara Valley between Khowst and Gardez
to prevent its future use as a safe haven for terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The British troops did not encounter any Taliban or Al Qaeda
fighters in the more than two weeks they were combing the region.
None of them was killed or seriously injured. But in a telling
display of the persistent hit-and-run capability of the enemy, two
107-millimeter Chinese-made rockets were trained on the soldiers as
they prepared to depart.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time we've been aware of munitions being
targeted at us," Lt. Col. Ben Curry of the Royal Marines told
reporters here as the forces from Operation Snipe were pulling out of
the region.</TE>
<TE>   The rockets were reportedly discovered by a local warlord who
brought British forces to the site before they were fired. Curry said
the rockets were aimed at the British forces' base of operations in
Chumara and were attached to "a crude water-system timer" that would
fire them once the water dripped out.</TE>
<TE>   Brig. Roger Lane, who commands the 1,700 British troops in
Afghanistan, said Snipe "delivered a significant blow to the ability
of Al Qaeda to plan, mount and sustain terrorist operations in
Afghanistan and beyond."</TE>
<TE>   Engineering troops deployed with Snipe last week set off one of
the biggest munitions detonations since World War II when they
destroyed more than 20 truckloads of rockets, mortars, small-arms
ammunition and other ordnance in an earthshaking blast felt
throughout southeastern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Eliminating logistical support for the terrorists is more
important than eliminating a couple of stragglers, Lane said.</TE>
<TE>   "Killing or capturing two or three individuals is not the
strategic imperative," he said. "The strategic imperative is to deny
them access....The fact that Al Qaeda had been forced to abandon one
of the most strategically well-placed and easily defended locations
in Afghanistan speaks volumes for the military and psychological
impact of the coalition's operations."</TE>
<TE>   Fighters from Osama bin Laden's terrorist network and their
Taliban allies ousted from the Afghan capital in November had used
the Chumara Valley as a strategic transit and resupply base in their
battle with U.S. forces during Operation Anaconda in March, British
officers said.</TE>
<TE>   Lane also said British troops backed their cleanup campaign with
civil affairs and humanitarian work aimed at winning over local
residents.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. operation in an adjacent area deployed 129 soldiers of
the 101st Airborne Division to a region immediately surrounding the
U.S. camp. No fighters were encountered during the 60-hour foray, a
fact that mission commander Lt. Col. Patrick Fetterman described as a
sign that the U.S.-led coalition forces have the enemy on the run.</TE>
<TE>   "We found numerous examples of evidence that they had been there,"
Fetterman said, among them "aiming stakes" used to support the
rockets directed at the U.S. base.</TE>
<TE>   While the American troops were scouring the area, two more
projectiles landed in their vicinity.</TE>
<TE>   None of the half-dozen or so attacks on the U.S. training camp
near Khowst airport has inflicted injury or property damage, and
Fetterman said their method was "not particularly accurate."</TE>
<TE>   "But it only takes one lucky shot to inflict a tragedy," he said
after his forces returned to Bagram.</TE>
<TE>   Later Monday, military officials said U.S. Special Forces had
killed five militants in a raid on a compound in Dara Wat, the
village 30 miles north of Kandahar where Taliban leader Omar grew up.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Marine Capt. Steven O'Connor said the Special Forces team was
shot at Sunday evening as it raided the compound suspected of being a
sanctuary for senior Al Qaeda or Taliban figures.</TE>
<TE>   The troops returned fire, killing the five, O'Connor said at
Bagram air base, and took 32 detainees. There were no U.S.
casualties, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Khowst, near the border with Pakistan, is in what remains a
volatile region.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the surviving Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters from the
Anaconda campaign two months ago are believed to have fled across the
border to Pakistan's lawless tribal areas. U.S. Special Forces are
deployed on both sides of the border, and officers here say further
operations are planned.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Auditor Details Shredding of Enron Papers</HD>
<DH>Courts: Duncan testifies he told employees to follow
company policy and destroy documents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Former Arthur Andersen accountant David B. Duncan testified Monday
that he orchestrated a campaign to destroy Enron Corp. audit
documents and knew at the time that he was breaking the law.</LD>
<LD>   "I obstructed justice," said Duncan, testifying for the first time
in Andersen's criminal trial in federal court here. "I instructed
people on the [audit] team to follow the document-retention policy,
which I knew would result in the destruction of documents."</LD>
<LD>   The disgraced 43-year-old executive pleaded guilty to obstruction
of justice April 9. He is the Justice Department's key witness in its
attempt to convict the Andersen firm on the same charge for shredding
tons of Enron audit documents as the energy trader's accounting came
under government scrutiny.</LD>
<TE>   Duncan's testimony about the firm's document-retention policy is
crucial to the case. Prosecutors contend that an e-mail containing an
Internet link to the policy, sent to several partners in mid-October,
was intended as a "code" to shred records and delete e-mail related
to Andersen's Enron work.</TE>
<TE>   But several other Andersen executives who received such e-mails
have testified that they interpreted them as a reminder to preserve
records needed to reinforce the firm's accounting conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Duncan's testimony Monday focused on his rapid ascent at
the 89-year-old accounting firm famed for its "talk straight" mantra.</TE>
<TE>   At times sounding sullen, Duncan described how he joined
Andersen's Houston office in the early 1980s, quickly rose from staff
accountant to manager and landed a job as the lead partner overseeing
the coveted Enron account--all before turning 40.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he said, he earned about $700,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I did well," he told prosecutor Andrew Weissmann.</TE>
<TE>   The appearance of Duncan, the only person to admit committing a
crime in the Enron scandal, marked the most dramatic moment in the
week-old trial.</TE>
<TE>   He is expected to remain on the witness stand for much of the
week, explaining the communications he had with senior executives at
Chicago-based Andersen as Securities and Exchange Commission
investigators closed in on Enron last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan previously told congressional investigators that his
shredding initiative was prompted in part by an Oct. 12 e-mail he
received from an Andersen attorney that cited the firm's document
policy, which calls for the destruction of memos, correspondence and
other records not needed to back up an auditor's conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   Enron announced Oct. 16 that it intended to restate earnings and
reduce shareholder equity by $1.2 billion, touching off a financial
collapse that led to the company's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing and
costing billions of dollars in lost investments.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Duncan fails to establish that he was directed by his
superiors, his appearance as a government witness could prove potent.
Because case law generally holds that a firm can be held liable for
the actions of its employees, prosecutors can tell the jury that
Duncan's admission should be ascribed to Andersen as a whole, with no
further proof needed.</TE>
<TE>   But Justice Department officials indicated Monday that they did
not intend to rely on Duncan's guilty plea alone. After calling him
to the stand late Monday, prosecutors underscored Duncan's widespread
connections in the firm, citing direct correspondence with Joseph F.
Berardino, Andersen's chief executive until early this year, and his
membership on a firm-wide strategic advisory council.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning from Assistant U.S. Atty. Weissmann, Duncan also
detailed how his firm had become entwined with its client, discussing
how he tracked the number of Andersen executives who jumped to Enron
and how he assisted the energy trader in opposing an SEC plan to
restrict accounting companies' services. Prosecutors may use such
details to argue that Andersen felt compelled to protect Enron from
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Duncan, wearing a striped dark gray suit, rose from
the witness chair to point out key locations in Andersen's offices
inside Enron's Houston headquarters, using a diagram on an easel in
front of the jury box. Labels on the diagram indicated several areas
prosecutors plan to discuss in later testimony, including the offices
of other partners handling Enron's audit and the location of the
shredder.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of the case may be determined by Andersen's ability to
undermine Duncan's credibility. Lawyers for the firm lost a bid to
obtain notes Duncan's lawyers took during his interviews with federal
investigators, which Andersen said might prove that Duncan changed
his account of the document destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen lawyers also have suggested that Duncan agreed to plead
guilty and cooperate with investigators not because he committed a
crime but because of government pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors began heading off that argument Monday, leading Duncan
through questions about his cooperation agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been told there's no correlation" between the outcome of the
case against Andersen and the sentence he eventually receives, Duncan
said. He also said prosecutors insisted on including a provision in
the agreement prohibiting him from profiting from the events that
took place at Andersen, by writing a book about his role, for
example.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, who was fired by Andersen in January, faces a maximum
sentence of 10 years' imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   Still unclear Monday was how far Duncan may go to implicate senior
executives at the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just as curious as everyone else," said Rusty Hardin,
Andersen's lead attorney, outside court.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan's testimony followed a series of showdowns between
prosecutors and Andersen. Hardin protested outside the jury's
presence Monday that U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon has
threatened to turn the proceedings into a "worthless trial" by
sustaining prosecutors' objections to some of his questions about
Andersen executives' intent during certain meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, for their part, requested a hearing this morning,
possibly to seek sanctions against Hardin. Prosecutors objected
vigorously Monday when Hardin, a Texas lawyer with a folksy style,
phrased a question to point out that the prosecutors hailed from big
East Coast cities.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides also have clashed repeatedly over the handling of
potential witnesses. Hardin last week accused prosecutors of
intimidating three potential witnesses, including one who appeared in
court to assert her 5th Amendment rights.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors on Monday asked Harmon to block another witness' bid
to assert his rights under seal.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Monday, two other Andersen partners, Amy Ripepi and James
Green, testified that they had received e-mails containing a link to
the document policy and did not read it as a signal to shred records.</TE>
<TE>   Green said he deleted about 100 Enron-related e-mails after a
discussion with his boss but insisted that he did so before learning
of the possibility of an SEC probe of Andersen.</TE>

<HD>Uncertain Road for Baja Plan</HD>
<DH>The $1.9-billion project calls for marinas and a road to
haul boats between coasts. But Baja has a history of shattering
dreams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VALLEY OF THE BOOJUMS, Mexico</DL>
<LD>It's the best road in Baja, as far as it goes. It unfurls for two
miles and then quits in the middle of the peninsula, a long way from
either of the two coasts it is supposed to bridge.</LD>
<LD>   Is this, as Mexico's tourism promoters say, a road to the future
that will attract hoards of American visitors and launch sleepy,
rural Baja California into the 21st century?</LD>
<LD>   Or is the road destined to be a dead end here in the boojum
forest, one more Baja development scheme as fantastic as these giant
trees, which resemble upside-down carrots and got their name from
Lewis Carroll's whimsical poem, "The Hunting of the Snark"?</LD>
<TE>   The road is a centerpiece of the Mexican government's $1.9-billion
project to establish a necklace of marinas around Baja, 20 airports,
and dozens of hotels, condos and golf courses.</TE>
<TE>   Backed by Mexican President Vicente Fox, the project would be the
biggest tourist development since Mexico turned the isolated fishing
village of Cancun into a strip of high-rise hotels and swim-up bars.</TE>
<TE>   The concept behind Escalera Nautica, literally Nautical Ladder, is
that yacht owners, mostly from California, could put ashore at any of
the two dozen new or improved marinas to be spaced roughly 120 miles
apart.</TE>
<TE>   The promoters of the project figure the biggest obstacle is the
sheer length of the peninsula which, at 820 miles, is longer than
Italy.</TE>
<TE>   That's where the new road, or "land bridge," comes in.</TE>
<TE>   Boat owners would turn over their lovingly waxed and polished
yachts and cabin cruisers to a local hauling service, which would
load them onto flatbeds and trailer them across the desert through
the boojum forest.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is that the new belt of blacktop across Baja's midriff
would attract thousands of boaters from the Pacific delighted to find
a shortcut to the Sea of Cortes and its 900 islands.</TE>
<TE>   But Baja has a history of shattering the grand dreams it inspires.</TE>
<TE>   The Sea of Cortes already has one largely empty port near Loreto
built by the same government tourism agency now proposing to build or
upgrade 23 more.</TE>
<TE>   Baja's main highway is littered with abandoned recreational
vehicle parks, cafeterias and gas stations built a generation ago to
attract U.S. tourists. Weeds and rusting hulks of junked cars fill
the spots once slated for American RVs.</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists worry about history repeating itself with the new
string of ports: If Mexico builds it, they won't come. Yacht owners
seem less than eager for such an expansion of marinas, fueling
questions about whether pristine coastline is being defaced for
uncertain gain.</TE>
<TE>   Homero Aridjis, one of Mexico's leading environmentalists, fears
that even if it succeeds, the Nautical Ladder will despoil Baja's
stark beauty and displace its rare wildlife. At worse, he says, the
project will set off an orgy of land speculation, causing outbreaks
of "chaotic development" all along the peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   Baja owes much of its charm to its stubbornly primitive nature,
rooted in makeshift fishing villages, empty wind-swept beaches and
isolated desert ranchos.</TE>
<TE>   Backward Baja has its aficionados. American and European tourists
seem perfectly willing to endure kidney-jarring roads and basic
accommodations to fish, surf and kayak in clean, clear waters; to rub
the head of baby gray whales in deserted Pacific Coast bays; or just
to unfold a beach chair on an empty stretch of sand and do nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as crews wrestle giant boulders to build the first new harbor
and mow down rare boojum trees to make way for a road, the proposed
mega-development is pitting one vision of Baja against another.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a wonderful way to dramatically change the way of life in
an entire region of Mexico," said John McCarthy, director of FONATUR,
Mexico's tourist development agency.</TE>
<TE>   According to FONATUR's projections, the new amenities would entice
about 76,000 yachts from the United States to make the passage every
year, bringing with them 860,000 "nautical" tourists.</TE>
<TE>   This surge in tourism would, in turn, create 50,000 direct and
200,000 indirect jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Impressed by such figures, President Fox has embraced the project.
It's an appealing notion for a head of state who dreams of opening
the border with the United States, but knows he must generate enough
jobs at least to slow down the northward migration of Mexican
workers.</TE>
<TE>   Tourism now stands as Mexico's third most important economic
enterprise behind manufacturing and oil, and from Mexico City, Baja
looks ideal for a new jobs program.</TE>
<TE>   Despite urban sprawl in the Tijuana-Ensenada corridor and the
enclave of resorts spreading out from Cabo San Lucas at land's end,
Baja contains less than 3% of Mexico's population of nearly 100
million.</TE>
<TE>   Much of this arid peninsula with 2,000 miles of coastline remains
unspoiled--a testament to what bad roads and scant water can do for a
place.</TE>
<TE>   Now conservationists on both sides of the border are pushing to
preserve Baja much as it is.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the fledgling Mexican conservation movement--with
the help of U.S. environmentalists--halted the construction of an
industrial salt plant in southern Baja next to a gray whale nursery
in San Ignacio Lagoon.</TE>
<TE>   Now these groups are challenging the Nautical Ladder as another
ill-conceived mega-project. They fear it will ruin wetlands, beaches,
spawning and feeding grounds for birds, fish, whales and sea turtles.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned from San Ignacio we could be the huge rock in the
shoe," said Patricia Martinez, administrative director of Pro Estero,
a wetlands protection group in Ensenada.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican conservation movement scored a victory earlier this
year when it persuaded the government to conduct an environmental
study on the Nautical Ladder project and, in particular, the road.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico has rigorous environmental laws, which sometimes require
more stringent ecological assessments than U.S. law, said Mark J.
Spalding of UC San Diego's Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies.</TE>
<TE>   "When it works, it's great. It also is frequently shelved and
ignored," Spalding said.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened when the government began to build the new
road a year ago, clearing a wide swath through the Valley of the
Boojums, or Valle de los Cirios, a nature reserve for the bizarre
trees, which are found nowhere else on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   The roadwork stopped--leaving the first, two-mile stretch isolated
in the wilderness--after conservationists raised Cain.</TE>
<TE>   "If you do anything in a protected area, you have to do a study,"
said Adrian Aguirre, director of the protected valley. "They didn't
have the permit to do it."</TE>
<TE>   FONATUR'S McCarthy and his staff said every aspect of the
project--as well as the concept as a whole--will face rigorous
ecological analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, construction is underway on the first new marina in the
tiny Pacific Coast fishing village of Santa Rosalillita. FONATUR
estimates that 140 boats a day will someday use the yet-to-be-built
boat ramp to begin the road trip across the desert to Bahia de los
Angeles on the Sea of Cortes.</TE>
<TE>   New roads, marinas and golf courses also would be carved out of
other wildlife reserves: the Upper Gulf Biosphere Reserve, the Loreto
Bay National Park, the Sea of Cortes Islands Wildlife Refuge and the
Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve.</TE>
<TE>   The Natural Resources Defense Council, which was instrumental in
stopping the saltworks project in San Ignacio Lagoon, is now gearing
up to fight a breakwater for a new marina at Punta Abreojos just up
the coast from the gray whale nursery.</TE>
<TE>   The environmental group Surfrider also has joined the fight,
partly because five of the proposed marinas could destroy top surf
spots at Santa Rosalillita, Puerto Canoas, Punta Abreojos, Magdalena
Bay and Bahia San Juanico, a place surfers all over the globe know as
Scorpion Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be devastating," said Ruben Andrews, who co-owns a surf
camp at Scorpion Bay. Surfing tourism, he points out, is second only
to fishing as a source of income for these villages.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy recognizes environmental opposition rising on both sides
of the border. But he notes that Mexico is in desperate need of jobs
and that tourism treads far more lightly on sensitive land than does
agriculture or industrial development.</TE>
<TE>   "We agree with them that this is a highly sensitive area of
Mexico," McCarthy said. "If we don't do it right, we could destroy
what we set out to protect."</TE>
<TE>   Many residents are skeptical of environmental and economic
promises from Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen aren't eager to become servants of the tourist trade.
The owners of small businesses worry about being marginalized by a
new economy.</TE>
<TE>   In Bahia de los Angeles, for instance, businessman Guillermo
Galvan is concerned enough about the proposed 1,800-slip marina that
he wrote to President Fox. He urged that the marina be built small
and in town to benefit the locals, not displacing them by building a
large marina-hotel complex on the outskirts.</TE>
<TE>   If the government wants to help the town of 800 people, he wrote,
how about building a sewage treatment plant, rather than a golf
course or high-rise hotel?</TE>
<TE>   "Electricity is on from 7 to 11 p.m. We only have water once a
week," Galvan said in an interview. "How the hell can we manage that
fancy stuff?"</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, town leaders join conservationists in worrying that this
project will be built and then abandoned like the last time FONATUR
came to central Baja, when it built the RV parks.</TE>
<TE>   "The government should know better not to waste money in projects
that don't make sense," said Antonio Resendiz, who uses part of an
abandoned RV park in Bahia de los Angeles as a sea turtle research
station.</TE>
<TE>   The toughest sell may be to the people the project is supposed to
attract.</TE>
<TE>   Experienced Baja sailers already bemoan the tedium involved in
checking into a Mexican port--finding the port captain, dealing with
immigration, paying fees at a bank and then going back to the port
captain so he can check the paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the goal of many boat owners is to avoid anchoring in
any Mexican ports.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of putting their boats in the hands of local truck
drivers for a trip across the desert would be funny if it weren't
horrifying.</TE>
<TE>   "Would I put my boat on a Mexican truck to go up and down a
mountain to get to the other side? No way," said Nancy Dillman, who
just returned to San Diego from two years cruising Baja.</TE>
<TE>   Boating experts say FONATUR has completely misread the market in
its projections. For 76,000 recreational boats to sail to Baja would
mean cleaning out every slip in every harbor from San Diego to
Sausalito, said Richard Spindler, executive editor of Latitude 38, a
California-based sailing magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these boat owners couldn't, or shouldn't, tackle the cold,
windy seas that stretch two-thirds of the way down the Pacific side
of the peninsula, Spindler said.</TE>
<TE>   Boat captains have a nickname for these conditions: The Baja Bash.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, yacht owners worry the proposed development will ruin
what now attracts them to the peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many terrific natural anchorages, nobody needs these
marinas," said Spindler, who has made an annual voyage with about 100
other boats to Cabo for the past 21 years.</TE>
<TE>   "For selfish reasons, we want Baja pristine," he added. "We don't
want hotels. We don't want golf courses. We don't want marinas."</TE>

<HD>Locals More Hostile Than Grateful About Mexico's Plans for
Marina</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAHIA DE LOS ANGELES, Mexico</DL>
<LD>In 37 years of fishing, Guillermo "Memo" Smith has learned the ways
of these waters.</LD>
<LD>   For example, he said, if you want to be sure of a good halibut
catch in the future, you learn to avoid the shallows when the fish
come to spawn.</LD>
<LD>   It is just such knowledge that has led him to question the wisdom
of the Mexican government's plan to develop this aquamarine bay in
the Sea of Cortes.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't understand how the government can dredge a place like
this. It's so important for the ecology and the economy," said Smith,
his hand at the tiller of his 24-foot skiff. "The boats are going to
throw diesel and oil and all of the bathroom waste. This is not a
place they should do a marina."</TE>
<TE>   The fertile waters of this bay, and its town of 800, are in the
path of a $1.9-billion project to build or expand 24 ports in and
around the Baja peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   But many locals seem downright hostile--rather than grateful--that
the government is proposing this as a spot for an 1,800-slip marina.</TE>
<TE>   It is perhaps not surprising that someone like Antonio Resendiz, a
noted sea turtle researcher for the government, opposes a big marina
in a bay that has not a single boat dock. He has spent 22 years
studying juvenile sea turtles that grow up here, fattening themselves
on sea grasses and algae before paddling to the Pacific to mate and
lay their eggs.</TE>
<TE>   "If the water here gets polluted and crowded and noisy, the
turtles will leave," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet opponents also include Guillermo Galvan, a successful
businessman who might stand to profit from extra tourism at his hotel
and restaurant complex.</TE>
<TE>   "You know how Ensenada is?" he said. "You cannot enjoy the beach
anymore." In the 1990s, Ensenada turned its most popular beach for
local families into a new marina for U.S. yacht owners.</TE>
<TE>   Serge Dedina, co-director of the U.S. conservation group
WildCoast, said he understands local concerns. He has spent 15 months
here working to establish a 1.1-million-acre national marine park
that would protect these waters from dredging, gill nets and other
destructive practices. Local fishermen would be in charge of
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Dedina said dredging the bay and building a marina isn't
compatible with a national park designed to boost ecotourism and
sustainable fishing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's centralized state tourism planning, the way you would find
it in the old Soviet Union," he said. "Bad planning. No knowledge of
Baja and no understanding of the American tourist market."</TE>
<TE>   Smith knows American tourists. Dollars he earns as a guide to
anglers and tourists supplement the living he cobbles together as a
lighthouse tender and part-time fisherman.</TE>
<TE>   In making his rounds recently, Smith guided his skiff, or panga,
over an inlet protected by a long sandbar. Schools of mackerel and
sardine darted through the clear waters. Puffer fish and rays glided
across the bottom, offering a glimpse of why the late oceanographer
Jacques Cousteau called this sea "the aquarium of the world."</TE>
<TE>   This is where the halibut spawn, Smith said. It's where he helps
sports fishermen net baitfish before they head for deeper water. The
inlet is adjacent to sea turtle feeding grounds and not far from
where Smith takes some of his more adventurous clients to snorkel
alongside 30-foot gape-mouthed whale sharks gorging on plankton.</TE>
<TE>   It's also the place designated by federal permit for dredging a
harbor. "I work here in my small boat," Smith said. "They are going
to come in with boats and displace me."</TE>
<TE>   In two days of quizzing locals, only one unabashed supporter
turned up. Rene Soberanes is the appointed delegate to the town from
the local government in Ensenada. "I'm one of those who think you
should sacrifice a little bit of nature to bring economic benefit to
the town."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A second California condor chick has hatched in Ventura County's back
country, further encouraging wildlife officials about the endangered
bird's recovery.</LD>
<LD>   The egg hatched Saturday in the Sespe Condor Sanctuary, under
observation of biologists who have been monitoring the nest for about
two months. The sanctuary is in Los Padres National Forest, north of
Fillmore.</LD>
<LD>   "We could just make out a fuzzy white-gray patch next to the male
that didn't have the smooth roundness of an egg and we could tell the
behavior of the male had changed," said U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service
biologist Mike Barth. "It's an amazing process to witness this huge
step toward the condors' recovery."</LD>
<TE>   The chick's parents--a 5-year-old female and an 8-year-old
male--were raised at the Los Angeles Zoo and San Diego Wild Animal
Park, then released into the wild as 1-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   In a nest three miles away, another condor pair are successfully
brooding a 1-month-old chick, the first condor in 18 years to hatch
from an egg laid in the wild, biologists said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials expect a third chick to hatch in about three weeks.</TE>

<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>A suspicious package found inside a postal box exploded Monday as it
was being defused by a police bomb squad, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The blast sprayed shrapnel for 100 feet, but there were no
injuries, according to FBI spokeswoman Linda Vizi.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Chait, a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, said he wasn't sure what the explosive device was made
of but said its remnants would be analyzed.</LD>
<TE>   A mail carrier discovered the package inside the postal box in a
residential neighborhood and became alarmed by writing on its
exterior.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't like the looks of it, he didn't like the writing on
it," Vizi said. She declined to describe the writing.</TE>
<TE>   A police official who spoke to Associated Press on condition of
anonymity said a note on the package said "Free Palestine" and
mentioned the Al Qaedaterrorist network.</TE>

<DL>BURLINGTON, Ky.</DL>
<LD>A man whose claim that he had a knife shut down part of
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport over the weekend
blurted out in court Monday that it was not a weapon but a "pen with
a cigar cutter."</LD>
<LD>   Charles Cowsert, 40, of Council Grove, Kan., made the statement
before the judge cut him off.</LD>
<LD>   Police say Cowsert passed the main airport security checkpoint,
then was chosen for a random search at the Comair gate. He allegedly
told security screeners he had a small knife, but none was found.</LD>
<TE>   His statement caused the evacuation of all three concourses in the
main terminal, which handles 92% of airport traffic. Thousands of
passengers were re-screened.</TE>
<TE>   Cowsert was arrested because a small amount of marijuana was
found, police said.</TE>

<HD>Bush Signs Bill Setting Farming Subsidies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush on Monday signed a $190-billion farm
bill guaranteeing higher subsidies to growers in Midwestern and
Southern states where key political races will decide which party
controls Congress next year.</LD>
<LD>   At an early morning ceremony, Bush said the six-year bill "will
provide a safety net for farmers, and will do so without encouraging
overproduction and depressing prices"--a position contrary to what
administration officials argued when the bill was being written.</LD>
<LD>   The subsidies could help Bush in his quest to win back control of
the Senate for the GOP, while giving him a chance to rack up IOUs for
his own 2004 reelection effort.</LD>
<TE>   "If he had vetoed it, it would have been very disappointing," said
Minnesota farmer Nathan Johnson. "In the 2000 election, almost all of
the agricultural areas voted for President Bush. They expected his
support ... and we certainly have gotten it."</TE>
<TE>   Some senators already are making plans to provide farmers with
even more money in the form of a disaster-aid package for
weather-related damage to 2001 crops.</TE>
<TE>   The farm law will increase spending by nearly 80% over the cost of
existing programs at a time when the president has been calling on
lawmakers to show fiscal restraint. The bill is estimated to cost
$190 billion over the next 10 years, although the programs must be
renewed after six.</TE>
<TE>   The farm bill raises subsidy rates for grain and cotton growers
and revives a target-price system abolished by the 1996 Freedom to
Farm Law to provide supplemental income when commodity prices are
below certain levels.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also brings back subsidies for wool and honey producers
and provides new payments for milk, peanuts, lentils and dry peas.</TE>

<HD>Fla. to Vote on Work Site Smoke Ban</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A proposal to ban smoking at most indoor workplaces in Florida,
including restaurants, has won a spot on the state's November ballot.</LD>
<LD>   State law now limits smoking in public places to designated
smoking areas. Public places include government buildings, stores,
restaurants, theaters and workplaces.</LD>
<LD>   But the coalition sponsoring the proposed constitutional
amendment, Smoke-Free for Health, argues that restricting smoking to
one area doesn't work.</LD>
<TE>   Its proposal would outlaw smoking in restaurants, except for
outdoor seating areas, and in all enclosed workplaces, including
employee break rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Exceptions would be made for stand-alone bars, designated guest
rooms in hotels, and home businesses that don't provide child care.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition conducted a petition drive to get the measure on the
ballot, and the state Division of Elections said it had verified
492,150 signatures, a few thousand more than required.</TE>
<TE>   The measure is backed by the American Cancer Society, American
Heart Assn., American Lung Assn., AARP of Florida and the Center for
Florida's Children.</TE>
<TE>   The Environmental Protection Agency designated secondhand smoke as
a carcinogen in 1993 and estimates that 3,000 American nonsmokers die
each year from lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke.</TE>
<TE>   California has had a total smoking ban since 1998, even in bars.</TE>

<HD>A Wet Row to Hoe in Midwest</HD>
<DH>Storms: The Mississippi River is manageable, but smaller
creeks surge dangerously. A forecast of more rain is especially bad
news for farmers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Day by day, almost hour by hour, Deidre Johnson can look out her
office window and watch the mighty, muddy Mississippi River slosh
over its bank and slurp up first the curb, then the street, then the
first few broad steps leading to the Gateway Arch.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like the river is taking over," said Johnson, who sells
riverboat cruises. "That's what it looks like. Like the river is
swallowing everything up."</LD>
<LD>   Well, not quite everything.</LD>
<TE>   At least, not yet.</TE>
<TE>   The flooding here is minimal compared with the disaster of 1993,
when levees burst all along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers,
swamping town after town. This year's version of the spring flood has
the Mississippi due to crest in St. Louis on Thursday at 371/2
feet--enough to flood some roads, farms and basements, but still 12
feet below the record crest of '93.</TE>
<TE>   While the Mississippi is manageable, smaller creeks throughout the
Midwest have surged dangerously in recent days as storms have pounded
an already-soggy region.</TE>
<TE>   Tremendous thunder booms have shaken houses like mini-
earthquakes, tornado sirens have wailed through muggy midnights, and
lightning bolts have cleaved the sky with such force that it
sometimes feels as though no structure could possibly stand up to a
storm that ferocious.</TE>
<TE>   At least three people have died in the flooding.</TE>
<TE>   A man drowned Monday in Bollinger County in southeast Missouri
when floodwaters swept away his pickup truck. In rural Ironton, Mo.,
on Sunday, a man was swept from a tree he had climbed to escape a
local creek turned raging river. And in a suburb of Cleveland, a man
was killed when his raft plunged over a dam on the rushing,
log-choked Chagrin River.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy rains drenched the drought-stricken Northeast, helping
replenish depleted reservoirs from New York City to Boston,
forecasters at the Weather Channel said. Rain also soaked part of the
Rocky Mountain region this weekend but not enough to affect the
area's four-year drought.</TE>
<TE>   The forecast, meanwhile, calls for more rain in the Midwest
starting Thursday and continuing through the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   That's especially bad news for farmers, who have not been able to
get out into their fields. Illinois growers, for instance, have
planted just 30% of their corn crop and 1% of their soybeans.
Normally, by this time of year, they would have seeded at least 85%
of their corn and 30% of the beans.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing being grown," said Ron Marshel, who manages the
Fayette and Bond County Farm Bureaus in north-central Illinois. Some
fields, he said, are under 10 feet of standing water, because of the
overflowing Kaskaskia River and ruptures in seven levees. The farmers
who work that land will be lucky to get into their fields a month
from now, Marshel said.</TE>
<TE>   By then, it will be too late to plant corn. And soybeans planted
so close to summer may produce a skimpy harvest. Some farmers hold
insurance to cover lost income from acres too wet to plant. Others
can only pray for sun.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying to keep a stiff upper lip," Marshel said. "But the
mood is quite down."</TE>
<TE>   It's equally grim over in Ellettsville, Ind., a small town just
west of Bloomington where the Police Department flooded--again.</TE>
<TE>   The creek through town swelled. The storm sewers backed up. And
late Sunday night, mucky water started punching through the drains in
the department's concrete floors. Geysers three feet high shot up,
dousing computers and desks. By morning, the detectives' offices were
under 14 inches of water.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Ron McGlocklin has seen at least one flood a year
since he started work at the department in 1981. The deluges are
predictable. There's nothing at all to be done about them, except
move to higher ground, which is hard in a low-lying community such as
Ellettsville. "This whole town sits in a flood plain," McGlocklin
said. Other towns in flood plains have learned from the trauma of
1993. Federal buyouts of homes and businesses that were submerged in
the flood have helped to move people out of danger. Levees have been
strengthened and new floodgates have been built.</TE>
<TE>   In Grafton, Ill., along the Mississippi River, antique store owner
Pam Bick spent a mercifully dry Monday hauling stuff out of her
basement. While the river is not expected to crest at a devastating
level, it will likely be high enough to creep into some homes.</TE>
<TE>   So, Bick sorts and she carries and she scrambles to find room on
her porch for a basement's worth of stuff, in a routine she has honed
to an art, flood after flood.</TE>
<TE>   "I always think of it as a hurry-up spring cleaning," she said.
"You have to keep your sense of humor."</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Illinois, one of two states that has suspended the death penalty
pending review, would vastly scale back executions under legislation
proposed Monday by Gov. George Ryan.</LD>
<LD>   "It is imperative that we move forward ... to fix our broken
justice system," said Ryan, who put capital punishment on hold two
years ago after investigations revealed that innocent people were
being put on death row.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan's proposal follows recommendations issued by a panel in
April. It would ban the execution of people who are mentally
retarded, require that juries be told to consider life in prison as
an alternative, reduce the number of factors that make a crime
punishable with death from 20 to five, and ban the death penalty when
a conviction is based only on the word of a jailhouse "snitch."</LD>
<TE>   Maryland last week joined Illinois in placing a moratorium on
executions pending review of the system's fairness on racial and
geographic grounds.</TE>

<HD>Senate Confirms Judicial Pick Who Fought Miranda Rules</HD>
<DH>Politics: Twenty senators vote against the Utah professor,
who has fought Miranda rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate voted Monday to confirm Utah law professor Paul Cassell to
the federal judiciary, but his bid to weaken protections for
suspected criminals led several senators to question whether he
belongs on the bench.</LD>
<LD>   "Professor Cassell has shown himself to be intemperate and
one-sided," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). "This man does not
belong on the court."</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) came to the nominee's defense, citing
Cassell's work representing a 12-year-old sex abuse victim who had
not been allowed to oppose a plea deal struck with his attacker.
Hatch said Cassell is one of the most honorable men he knows. In the
end, 20 senators voted against Cassell, the largest number to oppose
any of President Bush's 57 judicial nominees confirmed so far.
Sixty-seven senators voted to confirm Cassell to the vacancy on the
U.S. District Court in Utah.</LD>
<TE>   Much of the controversy around Cassell stems from his crusade to
redefine the Miranda warning, the "right to remain silent" and other
protections that have been a staple of police protocol since 1966.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Cassell argued before the U.S. Supreme Court that
voluntary confessions to crimes should not be discarded simply
because officers had not read suspects their Miranda rights.</TE>
<TE>   In a 7-2 ruling, the justices disagreed.</TE>

<HD>Ala. Church Bombing Trial Opens</HD>
<DH>Courts: An ex-klansman is accused in the horrific 1963
explosion that killed four black girls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</DL>
<LD>For 39 years, Bobby Frank Cherry, a truck-driving former Ku Klux
Klansman, hovered just outside the reach of the law.</LD>
<LD>   Even though there were stacks of FBI files implicating him in the
1963 church bombing that killed four black girls, he was never
prosecuted.</LD>
<LD>   Until now.</LD>
<TE>   Today, in a heavily protected underground courtroom in downtown
Birmingham, the long-awaited trial opens with Cherry, a creaky 71,
facing four counts of first-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   After a week of sifting through potential jurors, lawyers Monday
selected 16 people to hear the case--including four black men but no
black women. Twelve will sit as jurors, with four alternates.</TE>
<TE>   "This case is so well-known, we didn't have a single potential
juror who hadn't heard about it," said Circuit Judge James Garrett,
presiding over the trial. "We're counting on jurors to rise to the
occasion and just listen to the evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Cherry, who had been living quietly in Texas before he was
indicted, is the third man to be tried in connection with the
dynamiting of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church on Sept. 15,
1963. In many ways this trial will be a repeat of May 2001, when
another aged former klansman, Thomas E. Blanton Jr., was tried on the
same charges, convicted and sentenced to life in prison in front of
the same judge, with the same prosecutors and some of the same
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   In that trial, the most damaging evidence was old reel-to-reel
audio tapes, made by FBI agents, in which Blanton bragged about his
fondness of bombing. There is no similar taped evidence against
Cherry, but prosecutors will put on witnesses to testify about
hearing Cherry discuss bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Cherry and Blanton were supposed to be tried together, but Garrett
delayed trial for Cherry because of questions about his mental
competency. Defense experts testified that dementia had eaten away
Cherry's memory to the point that he couldn't remember the names of
ex-wives and was unable to help his defense.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Garrett ruled Cherry was unfit for trial. Outraged civil
rights groups marched in the streets, protesting the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors appealed the ruling, putting on psychological experts
who said that from their interviews with Cherry, they believed he was
faking.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Garrett reversed himself and ordered Cherry tried.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday evening, as he visited with reporters in his chambers
and prepared for the first day of the trial, the usually affable
judge turned sour when asked about the pressure to try Cherry.</TE>
<TE>   "To imply the judge was pressured, that there were nonlegal
reasons to have a trial," he said, "is an affront to me and to the
court."</TE>

<HD>Judge Orders Access to Priest's File</HD>
<DH>Courts: The Boston Archdiocese must hand over health
records in a child abuse case. Testimony by Cardinal Law becomes
heated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Boston Archdiocese was ordered Monday to hand over the
psychiatric and medical records of Father Paul Shanley, the retired
priest accused of child rape.</LD>
<LD>   Middlesex Superior Court Justice Janet Sanders ruled that by
turning his records over to the archdiocese, Shanley had waived the
right to keep them private. A hearing today will determine whether
the documents will be made public.</LD>
<LD>   On the same day Boston's Cardinal Bernard Law heatedly denied that
he had been negligent in failing to keep Father John J.
Geoghan--another priest accused of sexual abuse--away from children.</LD>
<TE>   "You could see it in his eyes that he was getting a little bit
temperamental," said 27-year-old Patrick McSorley, one of 86
plaintiffs in a civil lawsuit against Law and the archdiocese for
allegedly covering up abuse by Geoghan, a convicted pedophile.
McSorley and Mark Keane, another plaintiff, were allowed to sit in on
the third day of Law's deposition.</TE>
<TE>   Law "seemed kind of frazzled," added Keane, 33, who has claimed
that Geoghan abused him as well. "I think Cardinal Law is accustomed
to being in complete control. Today he wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   Law's testimony was taken at the chancery of Boston's Roman
Catholic Archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Now-defrocked, Geoghan, 66, is serving a nine- to 10-year sentence
for fondling a boy at a community swimming pool. His trial and
conviction in January ignited a sweeping scandal over clerical sexual
abuse that has included shocking disclosures about Shanley. The
71-year-old retired priest, arrested this month in California, has
pleaded not guilty to three counts of child rape.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese spokeswoman Donna M. Morrissey had no comment on the
cardinal's testimony Monday, or on the court order in the Shanley
case. Shanley's attorney, Frank Mondano, did not return a call
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Shanley is a central figure in the sex abuse scandal that has led
to calls for Law's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 1,600 pages of church documents released last month showed
that archdiocese officials knew of sexual abuse allegations against
Shanley as early as 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials also were aware that Shanley attended an
organizational meeting of a group that later became the North
American Man-Boy Love Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Shanley was repeatedly assigned to parish work with
children. The Middlesex County district attorney's office has charged
that Shanley sexually abused at least one child, sometimes in the
church confessional.</TE>
<TE>   According to public documents, Boston church officials recommended
Shanley as a priest "in good standing" when he was transferred to
Southern California in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   His medical and psychiatric records were sought by the family of
Gregory Ford, 24, who says Shanley repeatedly raped him over six
years, beginning when he was 6 years old. Ford and his parents have
filed a civil lawsuit against Law, accusing the cardinal of
negligence in failing to protect Ford.</TE>
<TE>   An archdiocese review board assessed Shanley's "aberrant sexual
conduct" and his request to receive permanent medical disability
payments, Sanders said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Roderick MacLeish Jr., the Fords' lawyer, said late Monday that
the archdiocese had failed to produce the files. "I was really
stunned" by the order, he said.</TE>
<TE>   MacLeish said in an interview Monday that "we believe these
records are just the tip of the iceberg, and there is much, much more
to come. [But] the iceberg is melting."</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese officials in Boston have turned over the names of
close to 100 priests suspected of sexual misconduct. More than 100
priests around the country have been suspended or have resigned since
the crisis erupted in January.</TE>
<TE>   Law repeatedly has rebuffed suggestions that he step down. In
April, he secretly visited the Vatican to discuss his status with
Pope John Paul II.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell Garabedian, attorney for the 86 plaintiffs suing Law in
the Geoghan case, said he expects to depose at least two more bishops
who were once assigned to the Boston Archdiocese. He also said he
plans to continue Law's deposition.</TE>
<TE>   Garabedian has asked for a court date to bring a breach of
contract claim against the archdiocese, which reneged this month on a
$15-million to $30-million settlement with his clients.</TE>
<TE>   Keane said Law volunteered during the deposition that in 1997, the
archdiocese paid $36,000 in legal fees for Geoghan. "But if it had
been a molested child seeking restitution, I doubt they would have
given it to him."</TE>

<HD>Lindh Lawyers Assail Charges</HD>
<DH>Indictment: The defense team for the American Talib asks a
federal judge to dismiss half of the 10 counts against the Northern
Californian.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Lawyers for John Walker Lindh on Monday asked a federal judge to
dismiss half of the 10-count indictment against him, including one
count charging the American Talib with conspiracy to kill U.S.
citizens.</LD>
<LD>   In documents filed with the U.S. District Court in Alexandria,
Va., Lindh's lawyers said their client, a 21-year-old Californian
discovered fighting with the Taliban in Afghanistan and brought back
to the United States to stand trial, could not be prosecuted for
taking part in a conflict.</LD>
<LD>   The lawyers also said he should not face four charges relating to
supplying services to the Taliban and Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network, blamed by the United States for the Sept. 11 attacks on
America, which killed about 3,000 people.</LD>
<TE>   Lindh's defense team asked the court to dismiss the first count of
conspiracy to commit murder, saying the charge as written violates
international law.</TE>
<TE>   "Count One as charged directly violates the well-established
international law principle of combat immunity, which the United
States has affirmed by treaty and adopted as part of its military and
domestic law," the attorneys said in a memorandum.</TE>
<TE>   "According to that principle, soldiers cannot be criminally
prosecuted simply for taking part in an armed conflict. They can be
prosecuted only for defined war crimes," it said. "There are no
allegations or evidence that Mr. Lindh committed any war crimes or
otherwise violated the laws of war."</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's lawyers already have asked the court to dismiss the first
count if the government would not give them access to potential
witnesses being held at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay in
Cuba--people who they say may have information helpful to Lindh.</TE>
<TE>   Judge T.S. Ellis has yet to rule on that request.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate memorandum filed on Monday, the defense team said
four other counts--which charge Lindh with conspiracy to contribute
services or with contributing services to the Taliban and to Al
Qaeda--should also be dropped.</TE>
<TE>   They argued that the regulations used for the charges were
financial in nature and did not pertain to the accusations spelled
out in the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   "The indictment does not specify what alleged actions by Mr. Lindh
the government believes constituted providing services to al Qaeda
and/or the Taliban," they wrote. "The indictment alleges no actions
by Mr. Lindh that might be characterized as financial, professional,
or technical service to the Taliban or al Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   "The government does not allege that Mr. Lindh traded in Taliban
or al Qaeda goods, that he provided any financial services or
financial support to the Taliban or to al Qaeda, that he provided or
received any property to or from the Taliban or from al Qaeda or that
he engaged in any commercial transactions of any kind with the
Taliban or al Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   Jury selection for Lindh's trial is due to begin Aug. 26.</TE>

<HD>Fla. Zookeeper Loses Arm to Lion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Surgeons were unable to reattach a zookeeper's arm after it was torn
off by a 350-pound lion as the woman took her parents and boyfriend
on a behind-the-scenes tour of the animal's sleeping quarters at
Busch Gardens.</LD>
<LD>   State wildlife officials, meanwhile, began an investigation into
what led to Sunday's attack.</LD>
<LD>   The 21-year-old zookeeper, whose name was not released, was in
serious condition Monday, Busch Gardens officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The officials said the 12-year-old lion would not be destroyed.
But they announced a review of the amusement park's safety policies.</TE>
<TE>   The zookeeper, who had worked at the park for about a year, was
taking her parents, her boyfriend and his parents on a tour when the
lion severed her right arm near the elbow. No tourists saw the
attack. It was not known how the lion reached the woman's arm, Busch
Gardens officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The arm was rushed to Tampa General Hospital with the zookeeper,
but surgeons could not reattach it, hospital spokesman John Dunn
said.</TE>
<TE>   The lion, named Max, has been at Busch since 1997. The park also
has a lioness. The lions were not put on display Monday. They are
part of Busch Gardens' "Edge of Africa" exhibit and are rotated on
display with hyenas.</TE>
<TE>   "These are still wild animals, and they behave like that," said
Glenn Young, Busch vice president of zoological operations. "This
appears to be a freak accident at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Metal bars and a fence that would not allow someone to put an arm
into the lion's cage separated the visitors from Max, but it would be
possible to stick one's fingers in, Young said.</TE>
<TE>   While by no means considered a tame animal, Max has been touched
by his zookeepers before and responds to them when they call him by
name.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Hanna, director emeritus of the Columbus (Ohio) Zoo and whose
TV show, "Jack Hanna's Animal Adventures," often originates from
Busch Gardens, said the zoo has one of the best safety records in the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "For the numbers of visitors and the numbers of animals they have,
I would say their record is in the top two or three of all the
zoological parks in the U.S., probably the world," Hanna said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, an animal keeper was crushed to death by a 2-ton
elephant. In 1993, a rattlesnake bit a zookeeper, who survived. And
in 1999, a woman claimed a Clydesdale horse bit off the tip of her
finger.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing I tell people is a wild animal is like a loaded
gun. It can go off at any time," Hanna said.</TE>

<HD>Loved Ones Honor Fallen Officers</HD>
<DH>Memorial: Family and friends remember the 230 killed on
duty in 2001. Sept. 11 attacks give vigil in Washington added
poignancy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>They come to spend another moment in remembrance of their loved ones
who died in the line of duty, to see their fallen police officer
saluted one more time.</LD>
<LD>   And Monday night, more people were drawn to the annual service at
the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial than ever before; the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks made 2001 one of the deadliest ever for
police.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, 230 officers across the nation were killed on duty. Not
since 1974 have there been more fatalities.</LD>
<TE>   "Our citizens need to understand that there is no challenge too
difficult and no danger too great for our police officers," said
Craig Floyd, chairman of the memorial.</TE>
<TE>   "If you need help, they will come. Certainly, there is no better
example of this truism than the valor displayed last September at the
Pentagon, in Pennsylvania and at the World Trade Center. Seventy-two
officers died that day--the deadliest in law enforcement history."</TE>
<TE>   The evening was filled with the stories of those men and women who
rushed into the World Trade Center after the first passenger jet
slammed into one of the towers.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of families and friends of those who lost a loved one sat
outdoors in a courtyard under a hazy yellow sky as the slain police
were honored.</TE>
<TE>   They lighted candles as the sun set, holding flags and sometimes
each other. Government officials spoke of the future and how the
nation could help better protect police.</TE>
<TE>   Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge said the government must
invest in ways to help local police detect and respond to terrorist
attacks, including high-tech communication equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "If we secure the hometown, then the homeland is secure," Ridge
said. "And no one knows the hometown like that local police officer,
who walks the streets. We can protect our protectors."</TE>
<TE>   Ridge also told the story of New York Police Sgt. Rodney Gillis,
who led several officers on a rescue mission into the World Trade
Center on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Gillis had also jumped from a helicopter onto the top of a World
Trade Center tower when terrorists set off a bomb in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "He was off duty when the plane hit," Ridge said. "As a
professional, he didn't consider himself off duty when his presence
was needed at the time of crisis.... His mission, some would say his
passion, was to rescue people."</TE>
<TE>   The names of those who died last year have been etched in stone at

<HD>High Court Takes a Step Toward Net Porn Rules</HD>
<DH>Justices: The cautious and complex ruling says a strict
standard can be applied to online sites to shield children. However,
free-speech challenges to the 1998 law remain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court breathed new life Monday into a law designed to
shield children from pornography on the Internet, ruling that the
"most puritan" community may decide what is harmful to minors, even
if a Web site based elsewhere is prosecuted based on this strict
standard.</LD>
<LD>   On an 8-1 vote, the court reversed a lower court's ruling that had
struck down the Child Online Protection Act because it relied on
"community standards" for deciding what is "patently offensive" for
minors under age 17.</LD>
<LD>   But the cautious and complex ruling stops well short of upholding
the 1998 law, which has never been enforced and will not be, at least
for now. The court sent the case back to the lower court to address
other free-speech challenges, which could take years.</LD>
<TE>   The case illustrates the difficulty that the federal government
has encountered in trying to corral portions of the unruly Internet
without trampling the 1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   "The scope of our decision today is quite narrow," Justice
Clarence Thomas wrote. "We hold only that [the Child Online
Protection Act's] reliance on community standards to identify
'material that is harmful to minors' does not by itself render the
statute" unconstitutional under the 1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Magazine and book publishers must live with this "community
standards" rule, Thomas said, and the 1st Amendment does not create a
special exemption for commercial Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   "If a publisher chooses to send its material into a particular
community," he wrote, "it is the publisher's responsibility to abide
by that community's standards."</TE>
<TE>   But the justices, while concurring in a lopsided vote, were
unusually divided in their opinions. Paradoxically, several in the
majority did not appear to support the notion of allowing local
standards to govern the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the court neither upheld the law nor allowed it to be
enforced. Instead, they sent the matter back to the lower court in
Philadelphia to consider other free-speech challenges to the law.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Monday's decision takes a step, albeit a tentative
one, toward allowing the first federal restrictions on what can be
transmitted via the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   In its short history, the Internet has been championed as a truly
free flow of communication and information. But with that freedom has
come a large volume of hard-core pornography, much of which can be
accessed by children and teenagers. In 1998, there were about 28,000
adult sites promoting pornography on the Web.</TE>
<TE>   Shielding Children From Online Porn</TE>
<TE>   Congress has been determined to block children from clicking onto
sexually explicit Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the Communications Decency Act made it a federal crime to
send sexually explicit messages or communications to anyone under age
18.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, however, a unanimous Supreme Court struck down that
law, saying it was too broad and vague. It raised the specter that
someone could be prosecuted for sending an e-mail or posting a
provocative photo that was subsequently brought up on a minor's
computer screen thousands of miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Undaunted, Congress in 1998 adopted a narrower, more specific ban
on computer transmissions that are "harmful to minors."</TE>
<TE>   The Child Online Protection Act applied only to material posted on
the Web "for commercial purposes." This excluded e-mails as well as
Web sites that are entirely free. It is not clear, though, whether
the law meant to include sites that are free to users but make money
from advertisements.</TE>
<TE>   The new law lowered the age of protected minors to those under 17.</TE>
<TE>   It also adopted a new, three-part definition of what is banned. It
covered "sexual acts" and "lewd exhibitions" that the "average
person, applying contemporary community standards, would find, taking
the material as a whole and with respect to minors, is designed ...
to pander to the prurient interest and ... lacks serious literary,
artistic, political or scientific value for minors."</TE>
<TE>   The law also sought to shield Web sites that screened out minors
by, for example, requiring them to supply a credit card number.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, before it could go into effect, the American Civil
Liberties Union went back to court in Philadelphia to challenge it as
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU's clients included Salon magazine, which feared it could
be prosecuted because of its sexual advice column, and the owners of
a gay and lesbian bookstore, which posted material on its Web site.
While neither site sought to appeal to minors, their sponsors say
they could not easily prevent them from tapping into the sites.</TE>
<TE>   When freedom of speech is at issue, the Supreme Court has been
willing to block new laws based on how they might be used, even when
no one has been prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the justices struck down a portion of the Child
Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 that made it a crime to own or
sell "computer generated" children engaged in sexual acts, saying it
could apply to animated figures or purely imaginary scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the ACLU said the Child Online Protection Act should be
struck down before it goes into effect because it could chill
communication on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Its lawyers argued the 1998 law had the same flaw as the 1996
version. Since Web sites cannot know who will access their material,
they are held responsible if minors click on to it, they said.</TE>
<TE>   'Most Puritan' Community Is Cited</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge in Philadelphia agreed and blocked the law from
taking effect. The U.S. appeals court there ruled the law
unconstitutional because it would allow the "most puritan" community
in the nation to regulate the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   For example, prosecutors could bring charges in Provo, Utah,
against a San Francisco-based Web site, the appeals court judges
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department appealed in the case of Ashcroft vs. ACLU,
00-1293, and won a reversal.</TE>
<TE>   Those who fear prosecution for distributing pornography "need only
take the simple step of utilizing a [different] medium that enables
it to target the release of its material," Thomas wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the near-unanimous vote and Thomas' strong words, most of
the justices did not appear to agree on what was said. Only Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia joined
Thomas' opinion in full.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor signed it but said she believed there
must be a national standard for what is harmful to minors. Justice
Stephen G. Breyer wrote a separate opinion making the same point.</TE>
<TE>   Three others--Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and
Ruth Bader Ginsburg--voted with the majority but joined a separate
opinion casting doubt on the constitutionality of the law.</TE>
<TE>   Justice John Paul Stevens dissented and said the law should be
struck down.</TE>
<TE>   "It is quite wrong to allow the standards of a minority consisting
of the least tolerant communities to regulate access to relatively
harmless messages in this burgeoning market," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Both Sides in Debate Claim a Victory</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting the split outcome, both sides said they were pleased.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Comstock, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said officials
there were "pleased the Supreme Court has vacated the decision" of
the lower court. It takes a step toward "keeping our nation's
children safe from viewing the pornography for sale on the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the ACLU's lawyer, Ann Beeson, said she was pleased the
court did not allow the law to go into effect.</TE>
<TE>   "The court clearly had enough doubts about this broad censorship
law to leave in place the ban, which is an enormous relief to our
clients," she said.</TE>
<TE>   When the case goes back to Philadelphia, the ACLU lawyers will
renew the main argument that the effort to restrict content on the
Internet is hopelessly flawed.</TE>
<TE>   Since sponsors of Web sites do not know who is downloading their
material, they should not be punished if a minor accesses it, they
say.</TE>
<TE>   Further, if this restriction becomes law, it will force Web sites
to post only material that is suitable for minors, and the 1st
Amendment does not allow the government to impose such a restriction
on American adults, they argue.</TE>

<HD>Judge in Shoe-Bomb Trial Is Asked to Drop a Charge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Lawyers for Richard C. Reid, who is accused of trying to blow up a
plane with explosives hidden in his shoes, asked a federal judge
Monday to dismiss one of the nine charges against him.</LD>
<LD>   The lawyers argued that Reid shouldn't be prosecuted under an
anti-terrorism law created after Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Reid, 28, a British citizen, allegedly tried to light a fuse
protruding from his shoe while on a Dec. 22 flight from Paris to
Miami. Flight attendants and passengers restrained him.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorney Owen Walker asked U.S. District Judge William
Young to throw out the charge of attempted wrecking of a mass
transportation vehicle because airplanes are not commonly considered
mass transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Walker also argued that the charge, covered by the USA Patriot
Act, is redundant because Reid has been charged with attempted
destruction of an aircraft under an older law.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Michael Keegan said the USA Patriot Act was intended to
cover violence or terrorism on airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   "Indeed, Congress' intent was to cover--as far as possible--all
mass transportation systems," Keegan said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other charges Reid faces are attempting to murder the
197 passengers and crew members on the American Airlines flight.</TE>
<TE>   Young did not immediately rule on the motion.</TE>

<HD>Skakel Defense Points to Tutor</HD>
<DH>Courts: The Kennedy cousin's lawyers show interviews that
they say implicate the witness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Attorneys for Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel played videotaped
interviews Monday they said implicated his childhood tutor in the
1975 slaying of Skakel's 15-year-old neighbor.</LD>
<LD>   The jury in Skakel's murder trial saw a 1992 interview of the
tutor, Kenneth Littleton, that was conducted by a state-retained
psychologist for the murder inquiry.</LD>
<LD>   The psychologist asked Littleton about statements he may have made
to his ex-wife during an alcohol-induced blackout in 1984. Skakel's
defense lawyer, Michael Sherman, then asked Littleton what he told
the doctor.</LD>
<TE>   "I did it," Littleton replied.</TE>
<TE>   "And, when you say I did it, you are talking about that you
committed the murder of Martha Moxley?" Sherman asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Correct," Littleton replied.</TE>
<TE>   But under questioning by prosecutors, the tutor denied actually
committing the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you kill Martha Moxley?" prosecutor Jonathan Benedict asked
Littleton.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I did not," Littleton said.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel, now 41, and Moxley were 15-year-old neighbors in a
wealthy, gated Greenwich community when Moxley was beaten to death
with a golf club. Skakel, a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow,
Ethel, could face life in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman also asked about taped conversations between Littleton and
his ex-wife, Mary Baker.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you ever tell Mary that you stabbed Martha Moxley through the
neck?" Sherman asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Littleton said.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors called Baker, who testified that she was lying
when she told Littleton he had confessed during the blackout. At the
time, Littleton was a suspect and Baker was working with police.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman pressed Baker on why she had lied to Littleton if she
thought he was innocent. Baker said she thought cooperating with
police was the right thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   Littleton has immunity from prosecution because he was compelled
to testify to a grand jury that investigated the murder and
recommended Skakel be charged.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Littleton testified he was told to take Michael,
several other Skakel children and a cousin out of Greenwich the day
after Moxley was killed. On Monday, Sherman played a tape in which
Littleton suggested that it was his idea to make that trip.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Dismisses July 4 Threat to Nuclear Sites</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>White House and Justice Department officials Monday dismissed a
recent intelligence tip about possible attacks against U.S. nuclear
facilities on or around July 4, saying it is uncorroborated and came
from an unreliable source.</LD>
<LD>   "Our guys just aren't taking it seriously," said a Justice
Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "The
intelligence folks they talked to were not taking it seriously; [the]
story was uncorroborated, like the vast majority of the intelligence
tips that come in from foreign sources."</LD>
<LD>   The threat, first reported Monday by the Washington Times, was
received by U.S. officials sometime last week. It suggested that an
unidentified Islamic terrorist group was planning to attack a nuclear
facility--perhaps the Three Mile Island power plant near Harrisburg,
Pa., or another facility in the Northeast.</LD>
<TE>   The Justice official said the tip came from intelligence officials
in Europe and did not generate any escalated threat warnings or
communications among U.S. counter-terrorism officials.</TE>
<TE>   The official also specifically said the tip did not come from Abu
Zubeida, the high-ranking Al Qaeda official who has told authorities
about planned attacks at U.S. financial institutions and shopping
malls. Zubeida was captured March 28 during a morning commando raid
in Pakistan and has been talking to his U.S. interrogators, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have said they are skeptical of Zubeida's claims, but
given his stature as one of Osama bin Laden's top commanders, they
are investigating them--and in one instance issued warnings to
financial institutions about possible terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Johndroe, spokesman for the White House Office of Homeland
Security, said authorities are discounting the tip about a July 4
attack, even though they believe Al Qaeda operatives have an interest
in attacking such facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "We have known for some time that Al Qaeda is interested in
attacking our infrastructure, including our nuclear power
facilities," Johndroe said.</TE>
<TE>   "But we have received no new information that indicates that an
alert needs to be sent out."</TE>
<TE>   Johndroe also said U.S. officials have taken steps since Sept. 11
to improve the security at dozens of nuclear facilities nationwide.</TE>

<HD>Compton Teachers Union Criticizes State Trustee</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>The state trustee of the Compton Unified School District overruled
the elected school board and intervened in contract negotiations with
the district's teachers, a union leader alleged Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas Hollister, executive director of the Compton Education
Assn., said in an interview that the district's state trustee,
Randolph E. Ward, overruled a contract proposal by the school board
last week. District negotiators offered a 2% raise during
negotiations--and did not submit an additional 2% cost-of-living
adjustment that board members had approved, Hollister said.</LD>
<LD>   Isadore Hall, the school board president, confirmed that the offer
presented last week was lower than that approved by the board. He
said Ward had not formally overruled negotiators but had instead
offered them advice.</LD>
<TE>   "Instead of giving a directive, he's offering advice," said Hall,
who added that he had sided with the teachers in the matter.</TE>
<TE>   As a state-appointed trustee, Ward has the authority to prevent
any school board action that he believes would cause financial harm
to the district.</TE>
<TE>   His apparent intervention would represent the first time that the
state trustee has overruled the local school board since the state
formally ended its day-to-day management of the district in December.</TE>
<TE>   Although formal authority was restored to the school board, state
Supt. of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin appointed Ward, the state
administrator of the district from 1996 to 2001, to oversee finances.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Hill, the state's chief deputy superintendent, said he and
Ward spoke last week about the state education budget and what impact
that might have on Compton and its union negotiations. But he said he
believed Ward had only informed negotiators of potential changes in
the state budget process.</TE>
<TE>   "Randy wanted to make sure that the district was aware of
last-minute changes in the state budget," Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   Ward did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   The union's approximately 1,700 members have been working without
a contract since last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials, who have sought an annual salary increase of 5%
in addition to a cost-of-living increase, spent Monday planning a
protest of Ward's alleged involvement in the district's offer for
tonight's school board meeting.</TE>

<HD>When Baseball Fans Yell Out 'You Stink!' in Laguna, They're
Being Literal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some baseballers who really stink ... The Laguna News-Post's police
log reported that a skunk was trapped in a batting cage facility "and
was spraying everything in sight."</LD>
<LD>   Hang 10? Or fore? Robin Russell of Pasadena noticed that a traffic
warning across the street from a golf course depicted an athlete, but
not a golfer, unless it's one who has switched from titanium to
fiberglass (see photo).</LD>
<LD>   Sudden thought: Whenever I hear about a sign being manipulated in
Pasadena, I remember that the city is also the home of those
legendary pranksters at Caltech.</LD>
<TE>   Never a dull moment next-door, I guess: Moving on to Surf City,
the police log of the Huntington Beach Wave listed a call from a
resident who said "a naked man was in a neighbor's backyard, but that
no one should be at the house because all the occupants of the home
were in jail."</TE>
<TE>   Translation, please: "My grandchildren in high school do not
remember the old-fashioned typewriters--let alone upper-case and
lower-case keys," wrote Dr. Burton Sokoloff of Tarzana. He sent along
an old bill he received from Cedars-Sinai where the amount due had
accidentally been typed in upper case. Sokoloff suspected it was
supposed to say $12.30, but dutifully made the check out for the
amount listed (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   And ... "it actually went through and was cashed," he said. "An
officer for the bank wrote in the true sum."</TE>
<TE>   Sudden thought: You know that hospital bill was sent out a long
time ago--1976, to be exact--if it was for $12.30.</TE>
<TE>   Translation, please (Part 2): My colleague, columnist Will Rogers,
says that during a discussion about new security features for Burbank
Airport, one federal official suggested "beds."</TE>
<TE>   What kind of security would beds offer? Actually, the official's
suggestion was spelled BEDS, short for Biological Explosive Detection
Systems.</TE>
<TE>   Which is?</TE>
<TE>   Rogers explained: "You and I would say 'bomb-sniffing dogs.'"</TE>
<TE>   Clippers fans can skip this item: As is now obvious, the Lakers
are going to be world champions for the third straight year. But I've
noticed that some of the Laker flags suddenly appearing on cars are
tattered--obviously leftovers from last year or the year before.
Their shoddy state is insulting to the team--and possibly a traffic
hazard, should any break loose.</TE>
<TE>   As a public service, then, this column is calling on the state
Legislature to add a section to the Vehicle Code requiring drivers to
turn in their old Laker championship flags for new ones each year.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure it's a slam dunk to pass.</TE>
<TE>   Intersecting paths: KNX reporter Laura Ornest was interviewing a
manicurist who had just given a skid row woman a free Mother's Day
nail job at the Fred Jordan Mission. The manicurist talked about what
a blessing it was to help the less fortunate and mentioned that her
name was Saverne Smith.</TE>
<TE>   The recipient of the manicure exclaimed: "We went to high school
together!" The two women blurted out "Locke High!" almost
simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   Added Smith's client, clinching the deal: "1976!" Smith told
Ornest: "You never know who you're going to help."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: This rave from best-selling author Sidney Sheldon
appears on the back of the novel "Halfway Home": "Evocative, haunting
and powerful, with characters who touch the heart. This is a novel
you are not soon going to forget." And who is the author? Mary
Sheldon, Sidney's daughter.</TE>

<HD>New Room Caters to Plugged-In O.C. Jurors</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Struggling to attract more people to jury service, Orange County
thinks it has found the answer: making the courthouse feel a little
more like your own house.</LD>
<LD>   Court officials Monday unveiled a new jury assembly room that they
hope will become a statewide model for treating prospective jurors
with greater hospitality. Jurors will now wait on faux leather
couches and ergonomically designed chairs just steps away from the
courthouse cafeteria instead of standing or sitting on the floor for
hours in the old assembly room.</LD>
<LD>   Where the old waiting room was claustrophobic, with little
ventilation and no windows, the new, expanded lounge allows jurors to
gaze through large picture windows onto Santa Ana's Civic Center
Plaza. There are 24 study carrels with modem connections so jurors
can use their computers to send and receive e-mail or access their
office. A network of seven large-screen televisions and a video
projection system also has been installed to make the waiting game
less grueling.</LD>
<TE>   The assembly room, which can accommodate as many as 600 people, is
the state's largest and cost more than $1.5 million. The idea,
officials said, is to make jury service less of a cattle call.</TE>
<TE>   California counties have been finding it harder to get people to
come out for service, which in some cases has delayed trials. Courts
have tried everything from shortening the length of jury service to
increasing pay. But Orange County officials said the answer might lie
in improving creature comforts.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping that once word gets out about the new assembly room,
we'll see more people showing up," said Thu Nguyen, the court's jury
manager.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, courts in the state summon roughly 10 million people to
jury duty. Of that number, 25% actually appear, call the courthouse
to reschedule or are found ineligible to serve. Orange County courts
fare better. Of the 800,000 residents who are called to serve each
year, 69% actually respond to the notices or show up.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Orange County Superior Court hopes to reduce its rate
of hard-core jury-duty avoiders with the new room. Thirteen percent
of residents summoned for jury duty fail to show up or contact the
court. Others postpone their assignments.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's unveiling corresponds with the beginning of Juror
Appreciation Week. Said jury candidate Lillian French, 42, of Santa
Ana, "The best thing is that people can get work done when they're
waiting."</TE>

of those residents summoned for jury duty fail to show up or contact
the court. Others postpone their assignments. Said Nguyen about those
who ignore the summons, "We call them FTAs--failure to appear[s].
That's a dirty word here."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's unveiling coincides with the beginning of Juror
Appreciation Week.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors familiar with the old assembly room said the new digs were
a vast improvement.</TE>
<TE>   Munching on popcorn, jury candidate Lillian French said she does
not have fond memories of the old assembly room.</TE>
<TE>   "It was cramped and it was stuffy and a lot of people were forced
to stand outside," said the 42-year-old Santa Ana resident and school
administrator. "It was a total surprise when I got here. The best
thing is that people can get work done when they're waiting."</TE>
<TE>   Another prospective juror, Gary Stenberg, 51, of Irvine agreed.
"This is so luxurious compared to the old one it's not even funny,"
said the Orange County Fire Authority captain.</TE>
<TE>   However, Stenberg did have a few suggestions for improving the
area. "There's a fire extinguisher here, but nobody would ever know
about it," he said. "It's off in the corner and there's a bush in
front of it."</TE>
<TE>   Stenberg said he mentioned the problem to court officials, and
they said they would make the device more visible.</TE>
<TE>   In the jury assembly room, prospective jurors wait to be assigned
to a courtroom, where they are selected or excused from serving on a
jury. Experts on juries said the assembly room is important because
it is often the juror's first introduction to the legal system.</TE>
<TE>   G. Thomas Munsterman, director of the Center for Jury Studies,
said the greatest disincentives for jury service are loss of time
from work and difficulty arranging for child care. For this reason,
courts in Orange County and elsewhere in the state will often
reschedule jury service if a citizen requests it.</TE>
<TE>   Munsterman said the best inducement to jury service is past jury
service. "All the surveys show that once people have served, they
felt it was a very rewarding experience."</TE>
<TE>   He said many jurors also enjoy the opportunity to meet people,
both as friends and romantically.</TE>
<TE>   "I bet there are people trolling this room right now," he said.</TE>

<HD>Nails Found on Slide at Playground</HD>
<DH>Crime: The hazards are discovered by a cautious father at
an elementary school in Mission Viejo, the fifth recent incident in
south Orange County.</DH>

<LD>A father who inspected a Mission Viejo playground before allowing his
children to play there discovered nails strategically placed along
the slides, the latest location where sharp objects have been found.</LD>
<LD>   The father, who has a 5-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter,
searched the equipment at Carl H. Hankey Elementary School about 1:40
p.m. Sunday and found nine construction nails on a yellow slide and
in the sand around it. Police scoured the park before classes began
Monday and found four more nails.</LD>
<LD>   This week's findings marked the fifth time in about two weeks that
nails and single-edged razor blades have been found in playgrounds
and tot lots in south Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   The park, used mostly by kindergartners, was last inspected Friday
by school officials who have conducted daily searches since the rash
of findings began April 28, said Cheryl Spetrino, principal at
Hankey. Nothing was found Friday, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies also found a set of footprints, probably belonging to a
male adult, said Jim Amormino, spokesman for the Orange County
Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   He said the nails were heavier than those recently found at parks
in Laguna Niguel, Laguna Beach and Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to tell if they're connected or if we have somebody who
sees all the publicity and becomes a copycat," Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   "The investigation is a very difficult one," he said. "There's not
a lot of evidence, and we don't have a lot of witnesses. It's
virtually impossible to watch the parks 24 hours a day."</TE>
<TE>   So far, no one has been injured, but no one is taking chances.
Parents are checking the slides and sandboxes. The school custodian
at Hankey raked the ground four inches deep in search of sharp
objects. Beginning today, all playgrounds in the Capistrano Unified
School District will be checked daily with metal detectors.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Thielen, 9, said the discoveries won't prevent him from
playing in the sand.</TE>
<TE>   "You will be careful, won't you?" asked his mother, Sammi Thielen,
43, of Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Looking around, Joe said: "This is a weird day."</TE>

<DH>Crime: Bill would let residents tell judges how nearby
prostitution and drug sales affect lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing before a crime-ridden Silver Lake motel shut largely through
the persistence of neighbors, City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo called for
state legislation Monday that would allow judges to hear directly
from community members whose quality of life suffers from
prostitution, drug dealing and vandalism.</LD>
<LD>   Delgadillo said the case of Sunset Pacific Motel, which was closed
in March after a long campaign by neighbors and is now boarded up and
fenced off, shows why new legislation is needed.</LD>
<LD>   A bill advancing in Sacramento would allow those hurt by lesser
crimes to tell judges how they've been victimized--as victims of
homicide and other major crimes now can.</LD>
<TE>   "The community must have a voice in everything that impacts our
neighborhoods," Delgadillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Standing with him on Monday, Assemblyman Jerome Horton
(D-Inglewood), the bill's sponsor, said the proposed legislation
would allay fears of community members who are afraid to speak out
because of possible retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   Horton said that under the measure, judges would receive
statements in the form of a written report, videotape or audiotape
from individuals or organized community groups.</TE>
<TE>   "We would all prefer to have the judge go visit these communities
... spend a night in a prostitution hotel ... spend a day next door
to a drug dealer," Horton said. "But we can't do that. Very few of
them will ever have that experience on a day-to-day basis."</TE>
<TE>   The bill, passed by the Assembly's Public Safety Committee, is
expected to go before the full Assembly next week.</TE>
<TE>   For some 20 years, neighbors of Sunset Pacific Motel complained
that shootings were commonplace, nearby homes were burglarized by
motel employees, and condoms and syringes could be found strewn about
sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles police officers responded to the motel often and
considered it one of the most dangerous properties in the city.</TE>
<TE>   In January, hundreds of residents attended a meeting calling on
city leaders to shut the place down.</TE>
<TE>   Its owner, Edward Eng, maintained that nothing out of the ordinary
took place there. The City Council's Building and Safety Committee
voted to revoke Eng's operating permit, a decision upheld by the full
council in March.</TE>
<TE>   Several community activists, integral in the battle against the
motel, said they are skeptical that the bill would do much to rid
their neighborhoods of nefarious activity.</TE>
<TE>   "There's already a lot of things in place, but it seems like
nothing gets done anyway," said Mary Rodriguez, a mother of two
children who attend King Middle School a few blocks from the motel.
She said efforts should be aimed at shutting down nuisance properties
sooner.</TE>
<TE>   Felipe Merino, executive director of Moneta Gardens Improvement in
Hawthorne, said the bill would allow its residents to tell judges
how, in that housing development, they live in fear of errant bullets
and their children are being offered heroin and cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   But Merino also questioned how much power the bill would provide
to the community.</TE>
<TE>   "What concerns me," he said, "is whose input is it going to be:
only the wealthy folks who have time on their hands to give a
statement?"</TE>

<LD>A shooting in a Glendale apartment, which was apparently touched off
by an argument, left a woman dead and two men in critical condition
Monday, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Amid yelling, one of the men called police about 3:15 p.m. to say
he and two other people had been shot, Glendale police spokesman Kirk
Palmer said.</LD>
<LD>   The shootings occurred in a four-unit complex in the 500 block of
West Lexington Drive.</LD>
<TE>   Less than 90 minutes later, the woman was pronounced dead at
Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, according to a hospital
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The two men were taken to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center.
One suffered a gunshot wound to the face and the other was wounded in
the stomach.</TE>
<TE>   Both were reported in critical condition late Monday, Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not sure what the motivation for the shooting was," Palmer
said. "But at this point, it appears to be some type of family
dispute."</TE>
<TE>   Police did not identify the victims.</TE>

<LD>A budget squeeze and last month's train derailment in Florida have
left Amtrak with no room for error, the railroad's acting president
said. "I'm one derailment away from having to cut service," warned
Stan Bagley.</LD>
<LD>   He said he "pulled every rabbit out of the bag" to keep the
nation's passenger railroad at full service after the April 18 crash
of its Florida-to-Virginia Auto Train. Four people died and 150 were
injured in the accident, which is under investigation by the National
Transportation Safety Board. Most of the train's 40 cars derailed.</LD>

<LD>The Postal Service's desire to shut down little-used post offices

<LD>Pro wrestling's The Rock may be called to testify in the trial in
Fort Lauderdale of a teenager accused in the drowning of an autistic
5-year-old boy, the defendant's attorney said.</LD>
<LD>   Gorman Roberts, 17, is accused of pushing Jordan Payne into a
canal Feb. 10, then walking away laughing as the boy struggled.
Roberts could get up to 15 years in prison if convicted on the
manslaughter charges. No trial date has been set.</LD>
<LD>   A boy has said that he, Roberts and a third child had watched a
wrestling program featuring The Rock three days before the drowning,
attorney Ellis Rubin said. If the boy repeats that statement under
oath during a deposition, Rubin said, he will subpoena The Rock.</LD>
<TE>   "Little boys imitate what they see on TV. If they hadn't been
watching wrestling, none of this might have happened," Rubin said.</TE>

majority Democrats, who dismissed arguments that the law infringes on
riders' personal freedoms.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation by Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy (R-Monrovia)--the
seventh effort to relax or repeal the helmet law since it was passed
11 years ago--would have allowed motorcyclists 21 and older to ride
without headgear if they possessed a $1-million insurance policy.</LD>
<LD>   The measure fell 7 votes short of the 41 needed for passage.</LD>
<TE>   Supporters, including the national bikers group American
Brotherhood Aimed Toward Education and the California Motorcycle
Dealers Assn., argued that the helmet law represents an unwarranted
government intrusion into riders' right to ride free, with their
faces to the wind, if they want to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, who included an array of police, public health and
insurance groups, argued that no major freedoms are being curtailed,
and pointed to a growing body of evidence that helmets save lives and
reduce medical costs often footed by the public. Anti-helmet
advocates dispute those numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Most Republican legislators sided with the motorcycle groups
during an impassioned Assembly debate, casting the issue as one of
fundamental personal rights.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Jay La Suer (R-La Mesa) recalled how his late father,
then 90, told him a decade ago that he regretted that his
grandchildren and great-grandchildren would not experience the same
America he had.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a question of freedom of choice," La Suer said, referring
to the roar of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle as "the sound of freedom
in America."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, who hold 50 of the Assembly's 80 seats, were unmoved.
Most sided with the health advocates, and called the helmet bill a
matter of simple common sense, not overzealous government.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Helen Thomson (D-Davis), a former nurse, rallied her
colleagues to oppose the helmet measure, citing a Sacramento Bee
editorial that dubbed it the "Brains on the Pavement Act."</TE>
<TE>   "Why in the world would we give people the license to kill
themselves?" said Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento).
"Helmets save lives."</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Widen Scrutiny of Non-Bid Pacts</HD>
<DH>Oracle: They also ask Davis to turn over information about
the $95-million contract. A spokesman says there may be a limit to
the governor's cooperation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Lawmakers moved Monday to expand their probe of state computer
software contracts by asking the auditor to scrutinize other
contracts awarded without competitive bidding.</LD>
<LD>   The probe also shifted closer to Gov. Gray Davis, as legislative
staff, in a rare move, asked the governor to turn over e-mails,
memos, phone conversation notes, calendars and meeting minutes
related to a $95-million Oracle software licensing agreement signed a
year ago.</LD>
<LD>   The request, from Assemblyman Dean Florez (D-Shafter), chairman of
the Joint Legislative Audit Committee, to Davis legal affairs
secretary Barry Goode, seeks copies of communications between the
governor and his staff and the companies and government agencies
involved in the contract.</LD>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor's office has so
far cooperated with the Legislature's investigation and turned over
numerous e-mails and documents.</TE>
<TE>   "Our policy has been to let it all hang out," he said. "But there
may be a limit to that."</TE>
<TE>   The governor's staff had not seen the request Monday afternoon, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has taken political heat for accepting a $25,000 campaign
donation from Oracle just days after the contract was signed, and two
department heads resigned after the state auditor released a highly
critical report on the contract last month. Davis returned the Oracle
donation last week.</TE>
<TE>   After several days of hearings about how and why the state signed
the no-bid Oracle contract, lawmakers said a wider look is needed at
the way California spends billions of dollars for goods and services,
especially those related to computers.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature "needs to use this as a case study to learn how
can we prevent this from happening ever again in California," Florez
said.</TE>
<TE>   While his bipartisan committee is taking testimony about the
Oracle contract--a third hearing is scheduled for today--Florez has
asked the state auditor to scrutinize those state contracts signed
without competitive bidding and analyze the workings of a Department
of General Services purchasing program called the California Multiple
Award Schedules.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature created the program nine years ago to streamline
how the state made small-scale purchases of computer-related goods
and services. It allows departments to pick vendors from an approved
list without soliciting and sifting bids. The value of the contracts
signed through the purchasing program jumped from $84 million in 1994
to more than $500 million in 2000. A 1998 state audit concluded that
the program didn't always deliver the best value or price for the
state because it didn't force state departments to make comparisons
before they bought.</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers say the program, while speeding up purchases, also
limits scrutiny of contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "We're asking the auditor to pick up right where they left off and
finish the job and get to the heart of how the system works and
whether it's being abused,'' Florez said.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to state auditor Elaine M. Howle, Florez asked that
the review focus on the state's no-bid contracts with Oracle and its
business partner Logicon, a Virginia-based subsidiary of aerospace
giant Northrop Grumman. Florez also singled out for scrutiny those
contracts signed by D.R. Lema and Associates, an information
technology consulting company that played a major role in preparing
the state's computers for the calendar change from 1999 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   David R. Lema, the former head of a major state data center, said
last week that he is dumbfounded as to why Florez's committee has
focused on his company.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has worked for both Oracle and Logicon, Lema has said
he had nothing to do with the state's $95-million Oracle software
licensing contract.</TE>
<TE>   But Florez described Lema as "someone who really knows how to
manipulate the system."</TE>
<TE>   Florez noted that in 1999, D.R. Lema and Associates was hired by
the state Department of Information Technology for $489,000--just
under the $500,000 Multiple Award Schedules limit for information
technology purchases.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, his company had a $450,000 contract with the
Stephen P. Teale Data Center, which operates many of the large
computer systems that drive state government.</TE>
<TE>   "How do all these contracts come in just under the threshold?"
said Florez. "We're anxious to have him come in and explain his
role."</TE>
<TE>   Oracle and Logicon have volunteered to rescind the contract, and
talks are underway with the state to do so.</TE>

<HD>Neighbor Testifies in Child's Scalding</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Oxnard couple are accused of punishing their son,
3, by plunging him into hot bathwater.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A neighbor of an Oxnard couple accused of plunging their 3-year-old
son into a bathtub of scalding water testified Monday that she saw
the injured toddler shortly after he was scalded but his parents
refused to take him to a hospital.</LD>
<LD>   "They were afraid the children would be taken away," said Yujani
Peinado, 17, during a preliminary hearing in Ventura County Superior
Court for Maria and Alfredo Esquivel.</LD>
<LD>   The couple, both 26, are charged with seven felony counts,
including torture and child abuse, stemming from the Dec. 21
incident.</LD>
<TE>   The Esquivels, who were convicted in 1999 of beating their then
2-year-old daughter, have pleaded not guilty to the charges.</TE>
<TE>   The couple have four children.</TE>
<TE>   Peinado, who lives in the house in front of the Esquivels'
converted-garage apartment, said she went to their home about noon
that day after she realized she had not heard their children laughing
and playing.</TE>
<TE>   Peinado saw young Fabian quietly lying on a bed, with one of his
legs burned to a pinkish hue.</TE>
<TE>   Peinado said Maria Esquivel told her she had taken the boy out of
the tub and put him on a little rug "and when she went to get a
towel, he got back in the bathtub."</TE>
<TE>   But Oxnard Police Det. Kenneth Klapman, who investigated the case,
said Fabian's 6-year-old brother, Pedro, told him that the Esquivels
plunged their son into the hot water after he soiled his underpants.</TE>
<TE>   Klapman said Pedro told him Fabian "was screaming, and I heard him
say 'Stop it, Poppy!'"</TE>
<TE>   Although Peinado said the boy did not appear to be in pain, Dr.
Daniel Lozano, a burn surgeon at UC San Diego Medical Center who
treated Fabian seven days after he was injured, said the child could
have been in shock from the second- to third-degree burns.</TE>
<TE>   The boy was admitted to the medical center on Dec. 28 after being
transferred from a hospital in Tijuana, Mexico, where his parents
took him the day of the incident, said Randy Tucker, defense attorney
for Alfredo Esquivel.</TE>
<TE>   Fabian and his three siblings are in the care of foster families,
according to authorities.</TE>

<TE>   Klapman said Pedro told him Fabian "was screaming, and I heard him

<TE>   "He screamed 'Ow!' as he was plunged into the bathtub," Klapman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Veronica Ayala, who lives in a room in the converted garage with
her two children, said Fabian did not appear to be seriously injured,
and she left about half an hour later.</TE>
<TE>   Ayala said Alfredo Esquivel told Maria they should call 911, but
Maria rejected the idea, saying "They're going to take [the children]
away from us. I don't know what I'm going to do."</TE>
<TE>   Although Peinado said the boy did not appear to be in pain, Dr.
Daniel Lozano, a burn surgeon at UC San Diego Medical Center who
treated Fabian seven days after he was injured, said the child could
have been in shock from the second- to third-degree burns.</TE>
<TE>   The boy was admitted to the medical center on Dec. 28 after being
transferred from a hospital in Tijuana, Mexico, where his parents
took him the day of the incident, said Randy Tucker, defense attorney
for Alfredo Esquivel.</TE>
<TE>   When asked outside court, Tucker refused to explain why the
Esquivels sought medical attention for their son in the border city
instead of in a hospital closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   Lozano said that by the time he saw Fabian, the boy's feet and
legs were inflamed with bacterial and fungal infections, and that he
had to surgically remove the burned skin and apply skin grafts to his
toes.</TE>
<TE>   "I was initially concerned that we would have to amputate his toes
and possibly his feet," Lozano said. "His toes, especially, were cold
to the touch and black."</TE>
<TE>   The surgeon said that if Fabian had received proper medical
attention soon after he was burned, he might not have had to undergo
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a significant setback," Lozano told Deputy Dist. Atty.
David Lehr.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure if he can walk properly or whether he will be able
to run again."</TE>
<TE>   Fabian and his three siblings are in the care of foster families,
Lehr said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Alfredo Esquivel pleaded guilty to hitting his daughter
Luz, now 5, with an electrical cord and a sandal while the the family
was living in South Lake Tahoe, Calif. Maria admitted providing the
objects and watching the beating.</TE>

<HD>'Strong-Arming' by Davis Decried</HD>
<DH>Politics: Simon reacts to news that governor asked teachers
union for $1-million donation at a meeting where legislation was
discussed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. on Monday lashed out
at the fund-raising practices of the man he hopes to replace,
criticizing Gov. Gray Davis for soliciting $1 million in campaign
contributions from the state teachers union at a meeting in his
Capitol office.</LD>
<LD>   The president of the California Teachers Assn. told The Times that
the solicitation occurred during a February meeting in the governor's
office at which legislation was discussed.</LD>
<LD>   Davis reportedly repeated the request, which was turned down,
during an event at a Compton school one week later.</LD>
<TE>   "On two occasions in which the governor was supposed to be
addressing the crisis in our public schools, he instead asked
California's teachers for a million dollars," Simon said at a hastily
called news conference in Los Angeles on Monday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "This mixing of policy discussions and campaign contributions is a
clear and direct example of the strong-arm, pay-to-play policy
discussions that are more apparent in the Davis administration every
day," said Simon, a wealthy investor who largely self-financed his
campaign during the GOP primary.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's chief political strategist, Garry South, replied:
"It's easy for a rich kid who inherited millions of dollars from his
old man to criticize someone who works for a paycheck and has to
raise money to run for office."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, a multimillionaire investor who largely financed his
campaign during the GOP primary, tied the teachers union solicitation
to the unfolding Oracle scandal in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The software company, which contributed $25,000 to Davis, won a
no-bid, $95-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   State auditors have concluded that the deal favored Oracle and was
of dubious value to taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   "They paint a very troubling picture," Simon said of the two
fund-raising cases.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP candidate, who has never run for public office before,
also accused Davis of mishandling the state's finances.</TE>
<TE>   Davis today will release a revised budget to close an estimated
$22-billion deficit.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon would not say how he would close the state's shortfall.
He said he had proposed a balanced budget when the gap stood at about
$12 billion this winter.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also said he would not cut education funding below the level
mandated by Proposition 98, which secures support for schools.</TE>

<HD>Six Treated After Vodka Spill</HD>
<DH>Safety: Leaking bottle causes evacuation of Fluor Daniel

irritation.</DH>

<LD>A leaking bottle of Russian vodka caused the evacuation of a south
Orange County engineering firm Monday and sent six mailroom workers
to the hospital complaining of nausea and burning to the eyes, nose
and throat.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said the bottle of 80-proof vodka was being sent from
one employee to another at the Fluor Daniel office complex in Aliso
Viejo.</LD>
<LD>   "It must have been pretty strong," said Capt. Stephen Miller of
the Orange County Fire Authority.</LD>
<TE>   "It made a bunch of people sick from smelling it."</TE>
<TE>   One mailroom worker became ill and five others felt woozy after
being exposed to the fumes.</TE>
<TE>   A hazardous materials team was called to help at the office
complex.</TE>
<TE>   More than 400 employees were evacuated from the four-story
building and four workers were sprayed with decontaminants as a
precaution.</TE>
<TE>   "If you drop a bottle of liquor, you can get a really strong
smell," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   "And it's not unusual for people to have psychosomatic-type
symptoms when someone else becomes ill."</TE>
<TE>   Although the incident caused no serious injuries, company
spokeswoman Lisa Boyette said the firm is responding.</TE>
<TE>   "We are sending out an e-mail reminding our employees that we
should use company property or equipment for business purposes only,"
Boyette said.</TE>

<LD>The impeccably dressed representatives of Royal Developers tried not
to break a sweat as they were peppered with questions from a City
Council skeptical of their multimillion-dollar proposal.</LD>
<LD>   The problem wasn't the asbestos removal, the disturbance of
historic buildings or even the effects such a grand gentrification
plan would have on a homeless shelter that sat square in the middle
of the redevelopment zone.</LD>
<LD>   It was parking--the nemesis of so many builders. Not enough
spaces. So the fledgling firm was sent back to the drafting room.</LD>
<TE>   Make that the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   The fictitious company of four students from University High
School in Irvine left the Urban Land Institute competition at Irvine
City Hall last week with a newfound appreciation for the kind of
headaches that the designers of the manicured city they live in must
have endured.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea how hard it is to make something that is nice and
still affordable," said senior Kevin Toyer, a member of Royal
Developers.</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly the point.</TE>
<TE>   This new breed of urban planning class engages thousands of
students throughout Southern California; it is part of a nationwide
push by land-use professionals to move beyond encouraging teenagers
to dream and into equipping them with the practical skills to effect
change.</TE>
<TE>   Sim City-type exercises in which students draft pie-in-the-sky
proposals are out. They've been replaced by intense courses that
force students to do the things a real-life developer must do: Make
PowerPoint presentations and maps, study redevelopment laws and
density bonus ordinances, and field letters from angry
preservationists and low-income-housing advocates. And pull a
workable plan together within budget.</TE>
<TE>   "Students can do mapping and satellite positioning, then bring
their proposals before a city council and be patted on the head and
dismissed because there is no financial component," said Paula
Blasier, a project manger for UrbanPlan, the institute's educational
program. "We're trying to let them know exactly how the system
works," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The classes are another indication of how urban growth has moved
to the front of the public discourse. Not long ago, educators viewed
city planning and zoning as too obscure to spend precious class time
on. As the pressures of urbanization increase, they are finding that
these kinds of programs are valuable because they help students
understand how and why the physical structures of their communities
are changing.</TE>
<TE>   The institute's curriculum is being used in more than a dozen high
schools in the region, including nine in Orange County and four
inner-city schools in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Five other L.A.-area high schools have signed on with the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Transportation Academy, which
offers students a hands-on opportunity to tackle regional
transportation issues by teaching them engineering, architectural
design and geographic mapping.</TE>
<TE>   The success of these programs has prompted many schools to craft
their own urban planning curricula.</TE>
<TE>   At Orange Lutheran High School, students have been drafting plans
for the closed El Toro Marine base and the oil fields that energy
companies want to convert into housing on the border of Los Angeles
and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   "They are learning that if you own a piece of land, what you get
to do with it is not entirely up to you," said Susan Odle, chairwoman
of the school's social studies department.</TE>
<TE>   Odle was in the stands as University and Anaheim high school
students presented their plans to a panel of land-use professionals,
hoping to get some ideas for her own classes.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine students gave elaborate presentations using all the
props a developer would: meticulously drawn plans on easels,
computer-generated images projected onto a big screen, and
spreadsheets calculating revenue potential.</TE>
<TE>   Their goal was to develop a workable redevelopment plan for an
area called Summit Square in the fictional Midwest city of Amber
Plains.</TE>
<TE>   As a mock city council grilled the students on why they placed a
swimming pool next to the homeless shelter and why the library was
infringing on green space, it all seemed familiar to University High
parent Sam Sansone, who happens to be a developer.</TE>
<TE>   "This is exactly what I have to go through when I give
presentations," he said. "They are asking some really intimidating
questions."</TE>
<TE>   And that was exactly what Linda DeBoer, who taught the urban
planning class at University High, wanted. "What I love about this is
it is people actually in the business telling them what is and what
isn't," DeBoer said.</TE>

<TE>   The Irvine students gave elaborate presentations using all the
props a developer would: meticulously drawn plans on easels,
computer-generated images projected onto a big screen, and
spreadsheets calculating revenue potential.</TE>
<TE>   Their goal was to develop a workable redevelopment plan for an
area called Summit Square in the fictional Midwest city of Amber
Plains. The place is loosely based on a decaying historic
neighborhood in Kansas City, Mo., where a development firm in the
early 1980s restored the neighborhood while creating low-income
affordable housing. The firm had to balance a mix of public and
private funds with the political problems associated with gentrifying
an urban neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The students were given a thick packet of materials, including
detailed descriptions of every historic building in the neighborhood,
a breakdown of what construction costs would be for various types of
facilities, and an environmental analysis warning that there may be a
serious asbestos problem.</TE>
<TE>   There were also letters from activists. The Heritage Society
warned that it would file a lawsuit to stop the redevelopment, and
residents of the homeless shelter demanded they not be displaced.</TE>
<TE>   The students were given $40 million worth of bonds, grants, loans
and other money to work with and were told they needed to develop a
profitable plan that balanced preservation and political
considerations with a mix of housing, commercial space and parks.</TE>
<TE>   They had about a month to design their project. They then
presented their plans to a group of local builders, planners and city
officials who served as the Amber Plains City Council.</TE>
<TE>   As the mock council grilled the students on why they placed a
swimming pool next to the homeless shelter and why the library was
infringing on green space, it all seemed familiar to University High
parent Sam Sansone, who happens to be a developer.</TE>
<TE>   "This is exactly what I have to go through when I give
presentations," he said during a recess. "They are asking some really
intimidating questions."</TE>
<TE>   And that was exactly what Linda DeBoer, who taught the urban
planning class at University High, wanted. "What I love about this is
it is people actually in the business telling them what is and what
isn't," DeBoer said.</TE>
<TE>   The American Planning Assn. published an extensive report in 1999
that emphasized the importance of youth involvement in community
planning and spotlighted examples of where it has worked across the
country. Dozens of school districts have succeeded in getting
students involved in local debates as seemingly mundane as general
plan revisions, breaking down the process and showing them how it
will affect their lives.</TE>
<TE>   The association has given Rancho Cucamonga a national award for a
particularly effective Internet-based program that exposes students
to the planning process. The workshop first encourages students to
study their community from a planning perspective, teaching them
about how different land uses give character to the community. Then
students work in teams to address neighborhood needs, and they are
taught how the political process works and how they can get involved.</TE>
<TE>   "Communities are recognizing that you have to involve the entire
community at all age levels," said Dan Coleman, principal planner for
Rancho Cucamonga. "Especially here. We are young and we are growing."</TE>
<TE>   Blasier of the Urban Land Institute is leading a team creating the
next generation of the program, which deals with some of the most
vexing issues that face California communities today.</TE>
<TE>   They will have to decide whether to include a "big box"
warehouse-type store in their plan, knowing that it will bring jobs
and tax revenue but also alter the character of neighborhoods and
cause traffic headaches. They will have to worry about making enough
profit to attract investors. And the students will record all of
their moves on an extensive computer spreadsheet that calculates how
each move will affect the return to their mock firm and to the city.</TE>
<TE>   "They will have to balance the social challenges with economic
consequences," Blasier said. "They will see the tension."</TE>

<HD>Bill Peet, 87; Disney Artist, Storyteller Wrote '101
Dalmatians,' Children's Books</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Peet, a legendary Disney artist and writer who drew such
indelible characters as Dumbo, wrote the screenplay for "101
Dalmatians" and went on to create 35 children's books with
curiosity-tweaking titles ranging from "Capyboppy" to
"Whingdingdilly," has died. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Peet died Saturday at his home in Studio City, said Howard Green,
vice president of communications for Disney Studios.</LD>
<LD>   Peet recently had pneumonia, and suffered for many years from
cancer and heart problems, beginning with a heart attack in 1977. He
lost one vocal cord and part of his larynx to cancer in 1985.</LD>
<TE>   The multitalented Peet was a revered storyteller, forever admired
by fellow artists and children alike.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Peet was Walt Disney's greatest story man and considered to
be on a par with Walt himself in terms of telling strong stories with
vibrant characters," said animation historian John Canemaker, author
of the recently published "Walt Disney's Nine Old Men" and animation
director for the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University.</TE>
<TE>   "[He] profoundly influenced some of the studio's greatest features
and created some of its most memorable characters."</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues from the early Disney decades, in which shorts and
feature films began as scenarios, then were developed by artists into
a series of storyboards and handed to animators, agreed that Peet as
a story man was second only to Disney.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Peet did the most stimulating story sketches, especially on
'Song of the South,' when they take the Rabbit out to find his
Laughing Place.... It was just a magnificent piece of story work for
animation," Frank Thomas, one of the fabled "Nine Old Men," said
Monday after learning of Peet's death.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody could touch Bill Peet," said another of the nine, Ollie
Johnston. "His drawings were staged beautifully. They suggested
attitudes and acting--just a great springboard for the animators."</TE>
<TE>   Peet the "story man" was Disney's logical choice to write the
studio's first screenplay, "101 Dalmatians" in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   The artist not only became the screenwriter, but also drew
characters and directed actors' voice performances, and then repeated
the same multi-tasking effort for "The Sword in the Stone" two years
later.</TE>
<TE>   The features remained among Peet's favorite creations, along with
his drawings for "Dumbo," the 1941 film that first gained the artist
personal attention from Disney.</TE>
<TE>   But the two animated feature films were to be the finale of the
27-year love-hate association between Disney and the individualist
Peet.</TE>
<TE>   Theirs had always been a prickly relationship, and Peet conceded
in his "Bill Peet: An Autobiography," published in 1989, that he drew
the evil Captain Hook in "Peter Pan" to resemble Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Peet left the studio and its creator in 1964 during the creation
of "Jungle Book," and asked that his name be stripped from the
credits because he didn't like changes that were made after he left
the project, a problem he always attributed to group creation.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't have a collective idea about what is funny," he told
The Times in 1990. "Creative work is a very personal thing. You have
to have a single point of view."</TE>
<TE>   Working on a Disney film, he said, was an "assembly line" process
with all the credit floating to the top.</TE>
<TE>   "Walt was very sensitive about credit. He would say, 'Dammit, we
are all in this together,'" Peet said.</TE>
<TE>   "But what he meant was 'the credit is all mine.' I knew the we
stood for Walter Elias [Disney's first and middle names]. Everything
came out 'Walt Disney presents' and the rest of our names might as
well have been in the phone book."</TE>
<TE>   Among the Disney classics featuring Peet's talents are "Fantasia,"
released in 1940, "Song of the South" in 1946, "Cinderella" in 1950,
"Alice in Wonderland" in 1951, and "Sleeping Beauty" in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   Four decades after Peet's exit from filmmaking, copies of his
drawings still adorn the offices of artists at Disney and other
animation studios as models of how to tell a story visually.</TE>
<TE>   The man who so longed for personal control and credit turned to
books as the proper outlet for his storytelling abilities.</TE>
<TE>   He had already published a handful of children's books--"Goliath
II" in 1959, an outgrowth of the story he did for the Disney feature
of the same title released in 1960, and such rhyming tales as
"Hubert's Hair-Raising Adventure," "Huge Harold," "Smokey" and "The
Pinkish, Purplish, Bluish Egg."</TE>
<TE>   So on his birthday on Jan. 29, 1964, Peet declared himself a
full-time children's author, never to return to an animation studio.</TE>
<TE>   Soon came "Randy's Dandy Lions" and "Ella," both in 1964, and
"Chester the Worldly Pig" in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   "Chester," Peet always said, was his favorite book character
because they shared the same background--born in the Midwest and
determined to see the larger world.</TE>
<TE>   Chester came from the artist's pen and mind. William Bartlett Peet
(originally Peed but later changed) was born in Grandview, Ind., a
dot on the map on the Ohio River, and moved to Indianapolis when he
was 3.</TE>
<TE>   A year or so later, he started drawing the trains that chugged
through the city and the animals that traveled with circuses.</TE>
<TE>   Peet won a scholarship to the John Herron Art Institute, now a
part of Indiana University, where he said his life "really began."</TE>
<TE>   He left Herron after three years and worked briefly as an artist
for a greeting card company in Dayton, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Depressed when he was assigned to illustrate sympathy cards,
however, he joined legions of other young men in the Depression who
responded to the advertisement "Walt Disney is looking for artists."</TE>
<TE>   Peet began as an "in-betweener," helping to draw Disney's Donald
Duck cartoons, until he got so fed up he stormed out screaming, "No
more ducks!"</TE>
<TE>   Expecting to join an unemployment line, Peet instead was assigned
to work on "Pinocchio," beginning his ascension in the Disney
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing came as easily as breathing to Peet. Writing was hard
work, but he quickly learned at Disney that the "story men" had more
control, so he wrote and created the memorable storyboards.</TE>
<TE>   When he left Disney to concentrate on books, Peet found that ideas
came even harder than writing.</TE>
<TE>   But as a father, he had told bedtime stories and suffered through
a long succession of family pets.</TE>
<TE>   He also wanted to make reading fun for children and teach them
useful things like how to get along with others.</TE>
<TE>   Starting with those ingredients, Peet cooked up a few ideas and
began, as he described it, to "write and draw at the same time ...
kind of a hodgepodge."</TE>
<TE>   Remembering, for example, the exotic South American capybara his
son Bill once ordered from an animal importer, Peet created the 1966
book "Capyboppy." In the book, as in real life, the tailless rodent
grew so big and got so spoiled that it had to be given to the zoo.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1975 book "Cyrus the Unsinkable Sea Serpent," Peet taught
that kindness is heroic by drawing Cyrus as a serpent out to sink a
ship and eat the passengers so he wouldn't seem like a "sissy," only
to wind up defending the ship against pirates.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his career, Peet loved meeting with children--and
drawing animals for them.</TE>
<TE>   He would start to draw some recognizable animal, he explained in
his autobiography, only to switch to several others as fast as his
little fans could shout out identifications.</TE>
<TE>   Such a combination of camel, dog, elephant, giraffe, reindeer,
rhino and zebra turned into the creature and 1970 book
"Whingdingdilly."</TE>
<TE>   Even after cancer surgery in 1985 forced him to abandon classroom
visits, Peet continued to personally answer his fan mail, often
sketching animals in the margins of his notes to his little fans.</TE>
<TE>   "My favorite compliment from the kids is, 'We think your books are
funny and make us laugh,'" Peet told The Times in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are trying to get kids to read, a book should be
entertaining. If it isn't fun, it becomes a chore."</TE>
<TE>   For more than 25 years, Peet churned out books that his little
readers grew up to read to their own children--"Farewell to Shady
Glade," "Buford the Little Bighorn," "How Droofus the Dragon Lost His
Head," "The Ant and the Elephant," "Merle the High Flying Squirrel,"
"The Gnats of Knotty Pine," "Cowardly Clyde," "Encore for Eleanor,"
"Pamela Camel," "Jethro and Joel Were a Troll" and "Zella, Zack and
Zodiac."</TE>
<TE>   "Cock-a-Doodle Dudley," published in 1990, was his final book.</TE>
<TE>   To add to his Annie Award for contributions to animation, Peet
received more than a dozen book awards for children's literature,
including the California Reading Assn.'s Significant Author Award in
1983.</TE>
<TE>   His autobiography was a Caldecott honor book in 1989 and earned
the Southern California Children's Book Writer's Medal.</TE>
<TE>   Peet is survived by his wife of 64 years, Margaret; a son, William
B. Jr.; and three grandchildren. Another son, Stephen, died in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services will be private.</TE>
<TE>   A public memorial service is scheduled at 3 p.m. Saturday at the
Church of the Hills, Forest Lawn Memorial Park, 6300 Forest Lawn
Drive, Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that memorial donations be made to the
Wilderness Society, 1615 M St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20036.</TE>

<HD>Pacheco, Zine Plan Motion to Bar City Subsidies for
Proposed NFL Stadium</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Los Angeles council members plan to introduce a motion today that
would prohibit the city from providing public subsidies to a proposed
professional football stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Councilmen Nick Pacheco and Dennis Zine are asking their
colleagues to adopt the restriction as part of the proposed creation
of an 879-acre redevelopment project area in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "I have no problem with NFL football," Zine said. "I support it,
but not on the backs of the taxpayers."</LD>
<TE>   Pacheco, who heads the council's Budget and Finance Committee,
said he is concerned that a football stadium could require a
substantial commitment of funds from the Community Redevelopment
Agency that could deplete resources for housing and other development
activities.</TE>
<TE>   "This action would go against what should be the downtown
redevelopment plan's first priority, which is to bring sustained
public improvements to all areas of downtown," Pacheco said.</TE>
<TE>   The Anschutz Entertainment Group recently announced that it was
exploring construction of a football stadium in the downtown area.
Representatives of the group could not be reached late Monday for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   A draft copy of the motion would have the council determine that
in adopting an 879-acre redevelopment project downtown, the City
Council would commit that no public funds from the city general fund
or redevelopment agency would be used for any project aimed at luring
an NFL team to locate in the City Center Redevelopment Project.</TE>
<TE>   It would prohibit public funds for direct or indirect costs of
developing and constructing a football stadium within the project
area, including the assemblage of land for a stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The only use of public funds allowed by the motion would be to
review and audit any stadium proposal.</TE>

<HD>2 Orange County Boulevards Chosen for High-Tech, Express
Bus Service</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harbor Boulevard and Westminster Avenue were selected Monday by
county transportation leaders as cross-county routes for faster bus
service that could save passengers up to 18 minutes a trip.</LD>
<LD>   The Bus Rapid Transit system would allow drivers to toggle
switches to help trigger green lights as they approach intersections
and would have electronic countdown devices in bus shelters to let
riders know when the next bus would arrive.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Transportation Authority board members unanimously
approved the idea for the new service. Start-up cost would be $11
million. The faster bus service would cost about $4.8 million a year
to operate.</LD>
<TE>   If approved by board members next month, the system would be
operational by summer 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty freshly painted buses would be available. Stops would be
every mile, rather than each quarter-mile as is the norm. The buses
would have priority with traffic signals, OCTA officials said. Bus
interiors would be upgraded. Passengers might save 15 to 18 minutes
on their commutes, said Todd Spitzer, a county supervisor and OCTA's
board chairman.</TE>
<TE>   "In some cases, it's like having express bus service," Spitzer
said.</TE>
<TE>   The new system would add 10,000 to 16,000 riders each day,
according to estimates, a fraction of the millions who ride OCTA
buses each month.</TE>
<TE>   Each bus would have an electronic device to trigger a quicker
green on traffic lights, thus saving time at intersections.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from cities along the two routes have been hesitant
about the new system. Details haven't been worked out, Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   Similar systems are in operation Los Angeles, Honolulu and Miami.
In Los Angeles, the two corridors include Ventura and
Wilshire/Whittier boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   Authority directors will evaluate a demonstration project before
the system is approved.</TE>
<TE>   The system would use some existing bus stops, and some new bus
shelters would be erected.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the electronic countdown timer at the bus shelters,
ticketing would be done by vending machine. Typically, delays are
caused when passengers pay for service while boarding. The
streamlined ticketing should cut time for passengers with longer
commutes, said OCTA spokesman George Urch.</TE>
<TE>   The routes were picked because they have heavy ridership. About
15% of all passengers use both routes and follow a straight line.</TE>
<TE>   The Harbor route begins at Nutwood Place in Fullerton and ends at
Newport Beach. The Westminster route begins at the Long Beach Transit
Center and ends at the Santa Ana Transit Center.</TE>

<HD>Coad Extends Irvine Deadline for Park Plan</HD>
<DH>Land use: Supervisor gives city until June 4 to decide how
to use El Toro funds for North County improvements. Her annexation
vote hangs in the balance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A county supervisor threatening to reverse last month's pivotal vote
handing control of the El Toro Marine base to Irvine will give the
city three more weeks to comply with her demand that money generated
there go toward north Orange County parks.</LD>
<LD>   Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad said in a memo
Monday that Irvine has until June 4 to find a way to provide $800,000
a year for 100 years from the development of the closed 4,700-acre
base. The money would go toward buying and developing parks north of
the Costa Mesa Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Earmarking the money "will make a significant contribution toward
increasing the supply of parkland in north Orange County while
allowing development of the large proposed regional park at El Toro
in south Orange County," said Coad, who had placed a new annexation
vote on today's Board of Supervisors' agenda. That vote has now been
delayed.</LD>
<TE>   Her memo said the money cannot come from county general funds or
property taxes, and must be adjusted for inflation.</TE>
<TE>   Coad voted April 16 to allow Irvine to annex the base, contingent
on the creation of an annual stream of money for North County parks.
Since the vote, Irvine has wrestled with how to fulfill that pledge,
with Coad threatening to reverse her vote if the money isn't
guaranteed. She joined Supervisors Todd Spitzer and Tom Wilson in
voting for annexation; Supervisors Chuck Smith and Jim Silva voted
no.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Irvine proposed creating a joint-powers agency to
transfer El Toro funds between the city and the county. But the
source of money has proved elusive. An initial pledge to use property
taxes was hampered by restrictions in state law; future sales taxes
could be used but would require approval by voters countywide and in
Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine had suggested using a small slice of property taxes that
the county would get after El Toro is developed, though most of the
money would go into a planned redevelopment agency. Revenue also
could come from leases controlled by the city, but it is unclear what
leases would exist after the Navy sells the bulk of the property.</TE>
<TE>   Current leases at the base--including a riding stable, a golf
course and recreational vehicle storage--expire June 30. Agricultural
leases also won't be renewed as the Navy prepares to sell the
property. Navy officials said they hope to have a plan for selling
the land by May 31.</TE>
<TE>   Coad is raising the ante for her critical support of Irvine's base
annexation, said Fred Smoller, who heads the Henley Social Sciences
Research Laboratory at Chapman University. "She's kind of holding it
hostage, but these types of deals are made all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine officials involved in the negotiations couldn't be reached
Monday for comment. The city has declined to publicly release its
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Long a supporter of a new airport at the shuttered Marine base,
Coad provided the swing annexation vote after Orange County voters
scuttled plans for the new airport in March. She noted the disparity
between park-poor North County and park-rich South County, insisting
that the development of El Toro should benefit the entire county.</TE>
<TE>   The county's share of property taxes after annexation would barely
make a dent in the amount Coad wants. The county's share after
redevelopment would be $150,000 for every $1 billion in assessed
value, according to a formula that became law in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The quandary facing Irvine is proof of how difficult it is for
local officials to manipulate public funds, said Peter Detwiler,
consultant for the Senate Local Government Committee in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Voters have amended the state constitution several times to make
it more difficult for elected officials to get money for projects, he
said, particularly taking money from one area and using it for
another. Joint-powers agencies are one way to transfer money, but
they are easily dissolved and can vote to change previous agreements,
he said.</TE>

<LD>Voters in Seal Beach's Old Town area will go to the polls today to
elect a new council member.</LD>
<LD>   Candidates in the runoff election are businesswoman Beverly Pearce
and Charles Antos, a county planner. The winner will replace Shawn
Boyd, who lost in the March election.</LD>
<LD>   Election issues include the city's utility users tax, the
availability of low-income housing and the future of 10 acres owned
by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.</LD>
<TE>   The DWP property, vacant for more than 30 years, has been zoned
for seven acres of open space and a hotel on the remaining three
acres.</TE>
<TE>   A four-story hotel was originally proposed but was scaled down to
150 rooms in three stories. There are no current plans to build the
hotel. There is also concern that the site may be contaminated with
asbestos.</TE>
<TE>   The city has an 11% utility users tax. There has been discussion
about lowering the tax, eliminating it or or letting voters decide.</TE>
<TE>   Polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Placentia Seeks to Fund Rail Upgrades</HD>
<DH>Transit: The city where last month's train crash occurred
asks OCTA for $9.2 million for better crossing barriers and track
signals.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Placentia city officials are seeking more than $9 million from the
Orange County Transportation Authority to improve rail safety and
reduce the risk of accidents like last month's fatal head-on crash
between two trains.</LD>
<LD>   The money would be used to upgrade signaling and communication
systems between dispatchers and engineers, and improve 11 rail
crossings in the city.</LD>
<LD>   OCTA board members discussed the funding request informally at
their meeting Monday, but transportation officials said they will
study Placentia's plan and address the issue again May 30.</LD>
<TE>   "We've agreed to look at their proposal, to see if we can possibly
help assist with the facilitation of funding," OCTA spokesman George
Urch said.</TE>
<TE>   "Safety's important to us, especially in light of the accident,"
he said. "We want to help fix whatever problems are out there."</TE>
<TE>   In the April 23 crash, a Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway
engineer said he was blinded by the sun and went through a yellow
signal warning him to slow down. As a result, he slowed down when he
approached a red light but was unable to stop in time to avoid
plowing head-on into a Metrolink commuter train.</TE>
<TE>   Two people were killed and hundreds were injured.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been warning people about this for years," Placentia City
Councilman Norman Z. Eckenrode said.</TE>
<TE>   "If they had collided at the same rate of speed they normally go,
we would not have had two people killed; we would have had 100 people
killed."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Chris Lowe said the city is focused on improving rail safety
in Placentia, where about 70 trains pass through daily.</TE>
<TE>   The city will soon break ground on a five-mile project that will
place the tracks in a trench below passenger and business traffic,
thanks to $30 million in starter money approved by Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The project is estimated to take several years to complete. In the
meantime, the city hopes to make other rail safety improvements with
OCTA's help.</TE>
<TE>   If OCTA approves the $9.2 million, Placentia will add
four-quadrant rail guards that prevent motorists from sneaking across
the tracks.</TE>
<TE>   About $3 million will be used to improve signals.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, a lot of the signaling that engineers use is outdated
and needs to be upgraded," Lowe said. "There's some features that
could identify right away when engineers have missed those signals
and alert authorities that the engineer needs to stop."</TE>

<HD>SOAR Analysis Assails Ventura Hills Ballot Measure</HD>
<DH>Development: Report says the home-building initiative
shortchanges voters and the city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A ballot measure that would allow further development of Ventura's
hillsides skirts the environmental review process, leaves the city
little negotiating power and transfers numerous costs to taxpayers,
slow-growth advocates declared Monday in a detailed project analysis.</LD>
<LD>   Backers of the 1,390-home development on hillsides north of the
city are attempting to ''use a hurried and uninformed vote as a
mandate to ram the project through,'' wrote Save Open Space and
Agricultural Resources in the six-page report on the ballot
initiative. "The developer is placing this development decision in
front of the city's voters before any meaningful study ... is
completed," reads the analysis, co-written by county Supervisor Steve
Bennett, a director of SOAR.</LD>
<LD>   "We would never allow the City Council to approve a development
without all the information [in an environmental impact report], so
why should we let voters?" Bennett asked.</LD>
<TE>   But a representative for the landowners said that they are merely
following the process put in place by Measure P, which requires that
voters approve any hillside development.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called Open 80 initiative would allow landowners to build
1,390 homes in the hilly areas north of downtown Ventura in exchange
for dedicating 80% of their 3,800 acres to permanent open space.</TE>
<TE>   SOAR's analysis briefly addresses specific concerns about the
plan, including: lack of affordable housing, the placement of many of
the development's homes on the front of the hillsides rather than in
the back canyons and the resulting traffic. However, Bennett made
clear that he is most deeply troubled by the strategy developers are
taking, and that their actions should give voters pause.</TE>
<TE>   "They've written a plan that includes things that would normally
be negotiated on the citizens' behalf by the city," he said. "It does
not give the city the opportunity to protect its citizens."</TE>
<TE>   However, Ventura Mayor Ray DiGuilio said that even if Ventura
residents vote in favor of the Open 80 plan in November, the city
still will be part of the planning process.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, the city would consider how it would be developed
but not whether it gets developed," he said. "The city staff has
worked with the landowners during the crafting of the Open 80 plan,
so it's not totally unknown to the staff."</TE>
<TE>   He added that passage of the initiative would not give the
developers carte blanche, saying they'd still have to abide by state
environmental standards and other regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said he would like the developer and landowner to work
with the city and complete an environmental impact report before
taking the initiative to voters. He accuses Open 80 proponents of
"turning Measure P on its head."</TE>
<TE>   Quite the contrary, counters Jim Anderson, a Los Angeles architect
who represents the landowners.</TE>
<TE>   Voters, not the city, have to approve hillside development, so it
makes sense to go to the voters first, Anderson said, adding that it
wouldn't make sense to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on an
EIR only to later see the initiative shot down by voters.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said supporters of Measure P seem to be arguing against
their own initiative, which requires developers who want to build on
hillsides to first get voter approval.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing exactly what is required and now they have changed
their policy," he said. "We find that inconsistent and unfeasible."</TE>
<TE>   The City Council was expected Monday night to approve a proposal
to spend $26,000 on several studies of the plan--including a look at
traffic and economic benefits--before the election.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Detectives were looking for suspects Monday in the fatal stabbing of
an Oxnard woman during an argument that began outside a convenience
store.</LD>
<LD>   Lucille Jefferson, 22, drove herself to St. John's Regional
Medical Center with multiple stab wounds and collapsed in the
emergency room about 10:20 p.m. Sunday, said Oxnard Police Sgt. Jim
Seitz.</LD>
<LD>   She died at 4 a.m., after hours of surgery. Jefferson was the
seventh homicide victim this year in Ventura County and the third in
Oxnard.</LD>
<TE>   Jefferson moved from Los Angeles weeks ago with her young son to
stay in Oxnard with relatives, said a friend of the family. Others
who had gathered at the family home, about a mile from the stabbing,
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told police that Jefferson and two passengers in her car
were trying to leave the parking lot of a convenience store at Rose
Avenue and 1st Street, less than a mile from the hospital. But
another car was blocking the exit.</TE>
<TE>   "Apparently, she started yelling, 'Move the car; get out of the
way,'" Seitz said.</TE>
<TE>   The other car turned out of the parking lot, and Jefferson
followed it to a stoplight yards away at Santa Lucia Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson got out of her car and walked toward the other vehicle.
She continued yelling at the occupants of the car, but police were
unsure who stabbed her.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses described two occupants of the car as Latino women in
their late teens or early 20s.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think the girls in the car did the stabbing, but we know
they saw what happened," he said. "We're hoping that whoever these
girls were in the car will come forward and tell us what happened."</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Social activist Alice Greenfield McGrath will be honored at a benefit
luncheon Sunday sponsored by the Ventura County Community Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   The tribute is a fund-raiser for Destino 2000, which funds local
charities that serve the Latino community. The group has already
granted $238,000 to local nonprofits.</LD>
<LD>   McGrath, 85, is best known for her involvement in the Sleepy
Lagoon incident, which gained notoriety as one of the most racist
court decisions in California history. In the 1942 case, an all-white
jury convicted 17 Latino youths in the beating death of a Mexican
national.</LD>
<TE>   The convictions were later overturned by a judge, who cited a lack
of evidence and found that the defendants were denied access to
attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath, who was a secretary with the legal defense committee for
the Sleepy Lagoon defendants, continues to work to obtain legal
counsel for the poor and heads Nicaraguan relief efforts by American
physicians.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets are $85 for the tribute, which will be held at the
Sterling Hills Golf Club in Camarillo.</TE>

<HD>NoHo Commons Developers Offer Scaled-Back Plan</HD>
<DH>Revitalization: The new proposal would cut the number of
homes but increase the size of units. Some retail space also would be
reduced.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The building of fewer, larger housing units and other changes have
been proposed for NoHo Commons, the ambitious mixed-use project to be
built on 16.7 acres in North Hollywood, next to the subway station.</LD>
<LD>   The commissioners of the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment
Agency are expected to approve changes in the plan at their meeting
Thursday, said the agency's Lillian Burkenheim, director of the
project to revitalize the core of North Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   The revised plan calls for building 450 units in Phase I of the
three-phase, $192-million project, about 20% fewer than originally
proposed.</LD>
<TE>   Planners believe that fewer, larger units will be more attractive
to prospective residents and make the units more competitive in
today's housing market, Burkenheim said.</TE>
<TE>   In the new plan, the cluster of buildings will be designed so that
residents can park close to where they live, instead of having all
parking concentrated in one place, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Decentralized parking has proved popular in other mixed-use
projects such as those in Santa Monica, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In Phase II, retail development will be trimmed from 127,000
square feet to 71,600 square feet, while the number of loft and
live-work units will be increased to 278 from 247.</TE>
<TE>   Less retail footage makes room for more housing and requires less
space for parking, Burkenheim said. This is important if the complex
is going to be perceived as an active place to live, work and shop.</TE>
<TE>   No changes are planned in Phase III, which calls for 200,000
square feet of office space, as well as retail space, and 20,000
square feet for community service.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles City Council unanimously approved the NoHo Commons
project in December. The redevelopment agency has committed $31.7
million in loans and subsidies to it.</TE>
<TE>   The project, which will be privately developed, would create an
estimated 1,600 jobs, and housing for people of all income levels.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would include housing and studios for artists and nearly
$2 million in public art.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the commissioners also will be asked to recognize
that some current residents of the area will suffer extreme hardship
without relocation assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law limits relocation benefits to citizens or legal
residents, except when relocation would cause exceptional and extreme
hardship.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Burkenheim said, families could receive financial help,
administered by the redevelopment agency, to ease that hardship,
regardless of their immigration status.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't a decision they're making to move," she said of those
who would be displaced by the project.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a decision that the city's making, and I want to make
sure that everybody's being treated as fairly and equally [as
possible]," she said.</TE>

<HD>Bay Area Rocked by 5.2 Earthquake</HD>
<DH>Temblor: Hockey fans in San Jose feel the jolt but the game
goes on. No injuries are reported.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON and JOHN GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A 5.2 magnitude earthquake rattled the Bay Area at 10 p.m. Monday,
one of the strongest quakes in the region since the devastating 1989
Loma Prieta quake.</LD>
<LD>   There were no early reports of serious damage or injuries,
although the 10-second temblor knocked out phone service to areas of
San Jose and sent bottles plummeting off shelves in restaurants in
the town of Gilroy, three miles from the quake's epicenter.</LD>
<LD>   The earthquake also violently rattled the upper decks of the
Compaq Center in San Jose in the third period of a National Hockey
League playoff game against the Colorado Avalanche, but did not stop
the game.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a doozy," said Lesley Benson, owner of the Claddagh, an
Irish restaurant in Gilroy. "It started off to be a little roller,
and then there was a big shudder."</TE>
<TE>   Benson said that she ran for the door frame when the rolling
started, and "that's when the shudder came. It slammed me into the
doorjamb."</TE>
<TE>   Her customers, many of whom had gathered to watch the hockey game
on TV, stopped cheering as tables shook and bottles skittered. A
basket of strawberries flew down from the shelves. Several
aftershocks followed.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Jorgenson, spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological Survey in the
Bay Area, said the quake was centered on the San Andreas fault and
was only 7.5 miles deep. The quake was strongly felt for about 200
miles, from San Jose north to Vallejo.</TE>
<TE>   It was among the strongest quakes here since Oct. 17, 1989, when
the Loma Prieta quake killed 67 people and damaged 13,000 homes,
rupturing the Bay Bridge and turning downtown Santa Cruz, near the
temblor's epicenter, to rubble.</TE>
<TE>   For Bay Area residents at the hockey game Monday, the trembling
stadium in San Jose was eerily reminiscent of that earlier quake,
which was witnessed by thousands of TV viewers who tuned in for the
third game of the World Series and saw the upper bleachers of
Candlestick Park sway as though moved by a stiff wind.</TE>
<TE>   Quakes in the Gilroy area are common, Jorgenson said. The area is
located near what is known as the creeping segment of the San
Andreas, a seismically active region. She said there was no way to
know whether Monday's quake was a precursor to a larger temblor.</TE>
<TE>   Gilroy Mayor Tom Springer said his town fared well in the quake.
"We just had a little 5.2 earthquake here, that's all. No damage. No
medical calls. We Californians are used to this sort of thing."</TE>
<TE>   Springer, who was fielding calls at the town's police station,
said the quake caused glass breakage in several local stores and
caused the water sprinkler system to engage at the local Wal-Mart,
closing the store.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in a local restaurant doing a study session for the City
Council, and it felt like a truck hit the building," Springer said.
"But after the first shock, we got a hold of ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   The quake caused light fixtures to rattle throughout San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a lot of calls from guests--I guess for some of them this
was their first earthquake," said a woman who identified herself as
Addie, a night clerk at the Holiday Inn in Fisherman's Wharf. "Some
of the stuff that was supposed to be on the tables started flying
around. Pictures were shaking on the walls.</TE>
<TE>   "But it was over pretty quickly. I'll bet most of our guests are
fast asleep by now."</TE>
<TE>   But in Gilroy, "It was scary," said Rose Martinez, night clerk at
the Motel 6. "Guests started calling immediately and I told them,
'This is California. Everything is going to be OK.'"</TE>

<LD>A Simi Valley serial rapist accused of gunning down a female college
student last year declined to enter a plea Monday to murder,
kidnapping and attempted rape charges after defense lawyers objected
to language in a felony complaint.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for
31-year-old Vincent Sanchez, who is accused of killing 20-year-old
Megan Barroso of Moorpark during a rape attempt last July.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Lela Henke-Dobroth filed a
complaint charging Sanchez with first-degree murder, kidnapping,
attempted rape and related allegations. Henke-Dobroth told Superior
Court Judge Ken Riley the prosecution is ready to proceed to trial.</LD>
<TE>   But Chief Deputy Public Defender Neil Quinn filed a motion
objecting to wording in the complaint, and Sanchez's scheduled
arraignment was postponed. Quinn contends prosecutors improperly
specified the degree of murder in the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a very technical matter," Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   But he told reporters it was necessary for the defense to object
given the serious nature of the case and the potential penalty facing
his client. A hearing on the issue was set for May 24.</TE>

<HD>Mother to Face Trial in Alleged Attempt to Kill 2</HD>
<DH>Courts: District attorney rejects Narinder Virk's guilty
plea to a lesser offense. She is accused of trying to drown her son
and daughter in 2000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Port Hueneme woman accused of trying to drown her two children in
Channel Islands Harbor attempted to plead guilty Monday to charges of
child endangerment, but prosecutors refused to accept the plea.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Public Defender Cynthia Ellington accused prosecutors of
backing out of a plea agreement negotiated several weeks ago and
forcing a trial on attempted murder charges.</LD>
<LD>   Ellington called it a vindictive prosecution.</LD>
<TE>   She urged Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley to enforce
the settlement agreement and allow her client, 42-year-old Narinder
Virk, to plead guilty to two lesser counts of child endangerment.</TE>
<TE>   "We are extremely frustrated by this turn of events," Ellington
said. "We do not want to go forward with a jury trial, we want to go
forward with the settlement agreement."</TE>
<TE>   But Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Simon, who was assigned to
the case a week ago, told Riley there was never a formal plea
agreement. Simon said a prosecutor previously assigned to the case
had rejected a plea bargain proposed by the defense, and that since
then he had decided to proceed to trial on the attempted murder
charges.</TE>
<TE>   Riley told Ellington he could not force the district attorney to
accept the plea agreement. He denied the defense request to allow
Virk to plead guilty to the lesser charges, which would have made her
eligible for probation. The attempted murder charges carry a possible
life prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "They've withdrawn from their previously stated position, but they
have a right to do that," Riley said. He set the case for trial on
June 17.</TE>
<TE>   Virk, an Indian immigrant, listened to the proceedings with the
assistance of a Punjabi interpreter. She renewed her earlier plea of
not guilty by reason of insanity and denied charges that she
intentionally tried to kill her children.</TE>
<TE>   Virk was arrested in January 2000 after an Oxnard resident pulled
the fully clothed woman, her 6-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son
out of the water near a boat dock.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend Virk tried to kill the children by pushing
them into the harbor and holding them underwater.</TE>
<TE>   But Virk's lawyer has said her client suffered a breakdown after
her abusive husband boarded a plane for India with plans to divorce
her, and should not be facing such severe charges.</TE>
<TE>   The case has galvanized members of Southern California's Sikh
community, who contend Virk was a battered wife unable to seek help
because of language and cultural barriers.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say Virk felt helpless and suicidal after her husband
left.</TE>
<TE>   Virk's trial is expected to last about three weeks. Meanwhile, she
remains free in lieu of $500,000 bail.</TE>

<HD>Toll of Ill Marine Animals Rising</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Hundreds of dazed sea lions and dolphins, many
dying, wash ashore at area beaches, victims of an unusual algae
bloom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The toll of sick and dying marine animals keeps rising, the result of
a neurotoxin from an unusual plankton bloom off the Southern
California coast.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of dazed sea lions and dolphins have washed ashore.
People have reported seeing pelicans dropping out of the sky or
slamming into homes.</LD>
<LD>   "It's unrelenting," said Jackie Jaakola, director of Fort
MacArthur Marine Mammal Care Center in San Pedro, which is jammed
with sick sea lions. It is as bad, she said, as the 1997-98 El Nino
that drove thousands of starving seals and sea lions to seek refuge
onshore.</LD>
<TE>   As disturbing as it is to watch a puppy-eyed sea creature
floundering, rescue workers and public health officials warn that
people should not get too close to bewildered, terrified animals.</TE>
<TE>   "People should not try to pet sea lions," said Peter Wallerstein,
president of the Whale Rescue Team, which picks up sick marine
mammals. "These are wild animals with a vicious bite and can transmit
diseases."</TE>
<TE>   Like other rescue workers and animal control officers,
Wallerstein's volunteers have been scurrying across beaches and
harbors in recent weeks picking up dead animals and trying to care
for those too sick to return to the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all of the living animals are disoriented, often suffering
from seizures caused by the neurotoxin called domoic acid. The acid,
which attacks the brain and nervous system, is produced by rapid
reproduction of single-cell plankton, in the genus Pseudonitzschia.</TE>
<TE>   Such blooms of the algae are well-documented in cooler waters off
Monterey Bay and farther north. Only this spring have scientists
discovered uncontrolled blooms in Southern California waters, which
they can't explain.</TE>
<TE>   Sardines and anchovies eat the plankton, concentrating the toxin
in their organs. The toxin is then passed on to sea lions, dolphins
and sea birds that eat the small fish.</TE>
<TE>   State health officials also warn the public to avoid eating
sardines, anchovies, crabs, clams, mussels and other shellfish that
are caught by recreational fishermen along the coast from Los Angeles
to the Monterey Bay. Commercial catches should be OK because they are
tested frequently for contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   With all the stricken animals to deal with, rescue workers are
concerned about human interaction with the sea lions.</TE>
<TE>   "With domoic acid, they are waking up from their seizures like
they are on angel dust and attacking whatever they can see,"
Wallerstein said.</TE>
<TE>   "The hardest thing we have to deal with is people's stupidity and
ignorance," he said. "People shouldn't put their children next to
these animals. They shouldn't try to bounce a ball off their noses.
They should keep their distance."</TE>
