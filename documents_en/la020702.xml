<HD>Portrait of Kids as Center of Own Universe</HD>
<DH>In Kenneth Lonergan's insightful 'This Is Our Youth,'
self-indulgent, disturbing behavior can apply to more than just the
'me' generation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP BRANDES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ah, the foibles of youth. Excessive profanity. Flagrant drug use.
More excessive profanity. Promiscuous sex. And, for variety's sake,
profanity in excess.</LD>
<LD>   From these not exactly unfamiliar ingredients, red-hot playwright
Kenneth Lonergan crafted a surprisingly fresh dramatic vision in
"This Is Our Youth," his merciless dissection of spoiled Manhattan
kids floundering on the brink of adulthood in 1982. Based on the
author's post-adolescent milieu and set in the ascendancy of the "me"
generation, the play could, intervening decades might suggest, be
called "This Was Our Youth," but Lonergan's raw portraits of
self-centered indulgence ring recognizably true for previous and
subsequent generations.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Barbara-based Ensemble Theater Company's perceptive staging
successfully captures the nuances of Lonergan's unique voice, as well
as its limitations. Particularly well-rendered is the language
Lonergan wields with skill and precision. Even the abundant profanity
is strategic, reminiscent on the surface of David Mamet.</LD>
<TE>   One of the few printable words in the play's
opening--"Nothing"--is weighted as heavily as it is in "King Lear."
In the space of a few economic lines of dialogue, "nothing" defines
the activities, accomplishments and ambitions of affluent stoners
Dennis (Jamison Haase), the cocky son of a famous painter, and Warren
(Sean McHugh), his nerdy childhood friend.</TE>
<TE>   Director Robert Grande-Weiss carefully balances the amusing tone
of these budding "Seinfeld"-esque characters' pursuit of nothing with
appropriately unsettling dignity at their lack of moral sensibility.
The era's rampant negligent parenting has taken its toll: Warren, in
retaliation for being thrown out of his parents' home, has stolen
$15,000 in cash from his father, which Dennis quickly exploits for a
drug deal. Using drugs as bait, the pair also engineer an opportunity
for the romantically maladroit Warren to seduce Jessica (Caitlin
Ferrara), the girl he's always pined for.</TE>
<TE>   As Warren's genuine feelings for Jessica spark the first glimmer
of maturity in him, McHugh's consistently assured performance becomes
the centerpiece of the show.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrara smartly delivers some of the play's most insightful
comments about the perceived impermanence of self that is central to
these kids' aimlessness. Since what they're like now is nothing like
who they will be, she reasons, it makes who they are at any given
point in time completely dismissible (and, by extension, their
behavior unaccountable). With this rationalization for indulgence
without consequence, Lonergan eloquently depicts a developmental
stage in which identities are donned and abandoned like theatrical
costumes--sometimes with devastating emotional consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Least successful is the know-it-all Dennis' relentless harping on
Warren's inadequacies in virtually every exchange. Here playwright
Lonergan seriously overplays his hand. A few well-placed barbs would
sufficiently--and far more believably--establish the relationship.</TE>
<TE>   The narrow focus of the piece and its indeterminate conclusions
might limit its broader appeal, but as a disturbing portrait of young
people in desperate straits despite affluent upbringings, it hits its
targets with deadly accuracy.</TE>

<LD>   ABC Specials to Report on Reeve's Progress</LD>
<LD>   Christopher Reeve has agreed to appear in a trio of specials for
ABC that will document his efforts to walk again, with the first of
the programs to air in the fall and the subsequent two to monitor his
progress over the next two years.</LD>
<TE>   Reeve, 49, who starred in the "Superman" films, was paralyzed from
the neck down after suffering a spinal-cord injury in 1995. He has
since become an activist on the issue and has continued working,
directing a pay-TV movie and starring in a remake of "Rear Window,"
also for ABC.</TE>
<TE>   The specials will be directed by the actor's son, Matthew Reeve.
An airdate for the first has yet to be determined.</TE>

<TE>   Group Gets More Time to Buy Rare Instruments</TE>
<TE>   A philanthropist has given the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra more
time to raise money to purchase a rare collection of Italian string
instruments.</TE>
<TE>   The collection, which includes 17th century Stradivarius and
Guarneri del Gesu violins, is valued at $50 million. Herbert Axelrod
and his wife, Evelyn, have offered them to the orchestra for
half-price.</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra originally had a June 30 deadline, but Axelrod
agreed to lift it, orchestra spokesman Phil Leininger said. The
orchestra hopes to complete the purchase this fall but no longer has
a specific deadline.</TE>
<TE>   If the sale is completed, the orchestra expects to have the
largest inventory of Stradivarius and Guarneri instruments.</TE>

<TE>   'Like Mike' Warning on Shoes, Power Lines</TE>
<TE>   California's largest utility company is warning that watching 20th
Century Fox's family film "Like Mike" could be harmful to children.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Gas and Electric Co. says a scene in the PG-rated film,
which opens Wednesday, depicts an action that is extremely dangerous:
The lead character, played by Bow Wow, retrieves a pair of shoes from
a power line in the middle of a rainstorm.</TE>
<TE>   The utility also says that throwing shoes on a power line is
illegal and could cause a small explosion in the transformer, causing
power lines to fall.</TE>
<TE>   "These are high-voltage power lines ... and a little kid doesn't
stand a chance," PB&amp;E spokesman Jason Alderman said. "We emphasize to
them that this is a fantasy and we ask parents to please tell their
children not to throw their shoes up there and try to retrieve them.
It is very dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Fox spokeswoman Flo Grace read a prepared statement in response: "
'Like Mike' is a fantasy about magic shoes. The scene is clearly not
meant to be real or present behavior to be emulated by youngsters.
The film in no way advocates taking dangerous risks of any kind,
including touching power lines."</TE>

<TE>   LEGAL BRIEFS</TE>
<TE>   A 'Sopranos' Suit  Dropped in Illinois</TE>
<TE>   A lawsuit that accused the makers of the television series "The
Sopranos" of offending Italian Americans by depicting them as
mobsters has been dropped after a second adverse ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The Italian-American Defense Assn. had filed the action against
Time Warner Entertainment Co. under the "individual dignity" clause
of the Illinois state constitution. The group didn't seek a financial
settlement or the HBO show's cancellation, but rather a declaration
from a jury that the show offends the dignity of Italian Americans,
association attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   Cook County Circuit Court Judge Richard Siebel dismissed the
lawsuit with prejudice in September, ruling that the clause in the
state's constitution was merely advisory. The Illinois Appellate
Court upheld that ruling on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Elle Macpherson Robbed in London</TE>
<TE>   Elle Macpherson has become the latest star to fall victim to
robbers in the fashionable Notting Hill part of London.</TE>
<TE>   Burglars managed to get past an elaborate security system at the
expensive home the model shares with Swiss banker Arpad Busson and
their 4-year-old son, Flynn, in northwest London.</TE>
<TE>   In March, ex-Spice girl Geri Halliwell was robbed of jewelry and
other possessions. Tara Newley, daughter of actress Joan Collins, was
mugged for her Cartier watch in Notting Hill last year. Two years
ago, thieves broke into Madonna's Notting Hill home and stole her
then-fiance's car after finding its keys. But police say so far they
are not linking the robberies.</TE>
<TE>   Harrelson Will Not  Face Charges</TE>
<TE>   Woody Harrelson, accused of damaging a London taxi in a fit of
rage, will not face criminal charges, London police said. The driver
of the cab has withdrawn his allegation, Scotland Yard said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Harrelson, star of the upcoming film "Anger Management," was
arrested June 6 on suspicion of criminal damage after an incident
outside a London nightclub. Taxi driver Les Dartnell said Harrelson
kicked his cab, smashing a door lock and ashtray before running off.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Singer Jerry Jeff Walker has canceled July 20 and 23 engagements
at the House of Blues in West Hollywood and Anaheim after aggravating
a back injury he suffered earlier this year. He was hospitalized over
the weekend. Refunds are available at point of purchase.... Today
through July 15, producers and talent scouts for cable network WE:
Women's Entertainment will be visiting L.A. hotspots seeking
unmarried women to cast in their reality television show "Single in
Los Angeles." The series will film later this summer for showing next
year.</TE>

<HD>Oscar Show May Move to February</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Oscars, Hollywood's signature awards show that in recent years
has spawned a costly, long-running and sometimes nasty campaign
season, could move up a month under a plan being explored by the
Academy of Motion Picture and Sciences in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to complaints that Oscar campaigning by Hollywood
studios is getting out of hand and concern that the other televised
awards shows could dilute the impact of the Academy Awards, the
40-member academy board of governors voted last week to explore
changing the date of the Oscar telecast on ABC from March to February
2004.</LD>
<LD>   The move "is not in stone," said academy executive director Bruce
Davis, "but it is solidifying."</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, he confirmed, the board voted to keep the Oscar
telecast at 3 1/2 hours or less after three of the last four
telecasts drifted past the four-hour mark, causing the show to run
past midnight on the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always vaguely said we need to shorten this thing," Davis
said. "They have now put in the record that the show will come in at
3 1/2 hours or less."</TE>
<TE>   This year, TV viewers had many chances to ogle a parade of
dressed-up movie stars thanking their agents, directors and mothers
well before the March 25 Oscar telecast.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild Awards, the American Film
Institute's selection of the 10 best feature films of the year and
the Broadcast Film Critics Assn. Awards all precede the Oscars. And
that doesn't include gala awards dinners held by directors, writers
and producers guilds to honor their own.</TE>
<TE>   The vote to explore moving the Oscars, reported in Monday's
Hollywood Reporter, "is a reaction to a perceived clutter of
televised film award shows and, while it is very flattering that
everyone lets us be the last one, kind of the final word, there was
also a feeling that we were certainly making lots of room for them in
the first three months of the year," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "Both the idea of shortening the show and moving it up a month in
the calendar are kind of dual attempts to reenergize it," Davis
added.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Ortenberg, president of Lions Gate Films Releasing--which last
year released "Monster's Ball," earning Halle Berry an Academy Award
for best actress--said a truncated Oscar season could help
independents by cutting the cost of Oscar campaigns, but it could
harm them by shortening the time for word of mouth to build.</TE>
<TE>   "From Lions Gate's perspective, a shortened campaign season would
likely cut costs, thereby helping to level the playing field, which
for an independent company like us would be a plus," Ortenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "On the other hand ... you may have the same number of shows
packed into an even smaller window than there is now, and that may
create even more clutter of nonstop awards shows leading up to the
Oscars."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that smaller independent films often need more time for
word of mouth to build among academy voters and the public. "So we
wouldn't want too short a season to allow voting to come and go
without allowing the films to fully work their way through the
membership."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Friedman, vice president of Paramount Pictures Motion
Picture Group, said moving up the Oscars is a "double-edged sword."</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of money spent [marketing movies during this
period], and one would hope you could save some of it," Friedman
said. "Conversely, there is a lot of money to be made during that
period, so there is a potential loss due to that. That is one reason
I want to know more about the schedule."</TE>
<TE>   Sources say that the academy may be considering Feb. 29,
2004--leap year--for the earlier Oscar telecast. One reason the show
couldn't be moved up next year, Davis said, is that the Kodak Theatre
in Hollywood, from which the show is broadcast, has other bookings
next February.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said a final decision on moving the Oscars could come in
about a month. He noted that, should the move occur, nominations
would be announced in late January instead of around Valentine's Day.</TE>
<TE>   This year's Oscar show drew 41.8 million viewers in the U.S., the
lowest rating since 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Academy Awards have been telecast in March since 1989,
the Oscars have been held at various times over the last 75 years.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Closing his 22nd consecutive Baroque Music Festival Corona del Mar,
festival founder Burton Karson put together another intriguing choral
finale.</LD>
<LD>   This one, given Sunday afternoon in St. Michael and All Angels
Church in the beachside community, paired unhackneyed works of J.S.
Bach and Vivaldi, joined at the middle by a brief brace of excerpts
from a cantata once attributed to Bach but actually written by his
predecessor as cantor of the Thomasschule in Leipzig, Johann Kuhnau.</LD>
<LD>   It was a joyful conclusion to the week of music.</LD>
<TE>   Conductor Karson presided over an accomplished choral ensemble
numbering 24, with a virtuosic instrumental group of 20. His vocal
soloists--soprano Claire Fedoruk, countertenor Joseph Mathieu, tenor
Jonathan Mack and baritone Christopher Lindbloom--sang purely,
musically and effortlessly.</TE>
<TE>   Despite limited rehearsal and the momentary musical dysfunctions
that can mar performances, the playing and singing of Bach's "Die
Elenden sollen essen" (All the Starving Shall Be Nourished), BWV 75,
portions of Kuhnau's "Uns ist ein Kind geboren" (A Child Is Born to
Us), Vivaldi's joyous "Dixit Dominus" (The Lord Said), RV 595,
realized the contagious exuberance in all three pieces of musical
devotion.</TE>
<TE>   Fedoruk, joined in one duet in the Vivaldi work by soprano Linda
Williams Pearce, delivered all this expressive music with an
unfettered tone and an easy clarity.</TE>
<TE>   The male soloists followed her lead, in particular Mathieu, who
sang with clarion authority and irrepressible spirits. The three men
also joined in a powerful "Gloria Patri" at the high point of the
cantata. At the conclusion, conductor Karson shared the bows
generously.</TE>

<HD>An Improvisation on Musique Concrete</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Musique concrete--basically the electronic manipulation of natural or
found sounds--has become part of the international electronic music
vocabulary.</LD>
<LD>   Even the Beatles' "Revolution No. 9" and Frank Zappa's "Freak
Out!" made exuberant use of this technique.</LD>
<LD>   And though much has changed in sound and technology since the
French launched musique concrete just after World War II, French
explorers like Lionel Marchetti and Jerome Noetinger continue to
produce inventive, flowing offshoots.</LD>
<TE>   Their performance at Beyond Baroque Sunday night was quite
different from classic, composed musique concrete: This was a live,
completely improvised session.</TE>
<TE>   It was also a throwback to a simpler era, with the two composers
seated at a table crammed with cables, tiny speaker cones with paper
cups vibrating on top of them, ordinary telephone pickups and, for a
touch of modern technology, portable CD and MiniDisc players.</TE>
<TE>   By now completely attuned to each other's instincts, unleashing an
encyclopedia of virtuoso techniques, Marchetti and Noetinger produced
an intuitively integrated 36-minute improvisation.</TE>
<TE>   Marchetti was especially fun to watch, shaking a pickup over the
speaker cones to produce wild flute-like screaming, blowing through a
clarinet mouthpiece or a harmonica through another pickup, toying
with buzzing ground hum produced by unplugged cables.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the soundscape was reminiscent of the boiling
electronics of composer Iannis Xenakis; sometimes the extreme
high-frequency pitches were painful. Yet it never taxed the attention
span.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing with Marchetti and Noetinger were two Northern
California composers--John Bischoff, who produced an austere, droning
soundscape, and Dajuin Yao, whose powerful, careening, surging
half-hour piece was nearly symphonic in its sweep.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike their French colleagues, Bischoff and Yao used laptop
computers as launching pads.</TE>

<HD>Grand Finale Seems to Come First in 'Polynesian'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Hollywood Bowl's 2002 world music season opened Sunday with
"Polynesian Paradise!," a spectacular display of colorful music and
dancing--a vivid example of what the series can be at its very best.
The concert closed with a far more subdued, if musically pleasant,
set revealing what the season is more likely to provide.</LD>
<LD>   One can only hope that the balance of the schedule will offer
programs as captivating as the performance by Les Grands Ballets de
Tahiti. Dancing to the intensely rhythmic Polynesian sounds of a
14-piece instrumental ensemble and a chorus of singers, the company's
large corps of artists worked its way through an intricate array of
traditional dances tinged with contemporary touches. Appearing in a
constantly changing sequence of colorful costumes, tossing in an
electrifying fire baton number, they convincingly illustrated the
manner in which world music actually describes an almost inextricable
blending of melody, rhythm and physical movement.</LD>
<TE>   The Brothers Cazimero, Hawaii's Simon &amp; Garfunkel, took a
different, but no less engaging, tack. The sweet sounds of their
vocal blend, enhanced by carefully crafted rhythmic interaction
between their guitar and bass work, were applied to a collection of
tunes describing the beauties of the islands and the subtle
complexities of its culture. Their program included performances by
members of the Halau Keali'l O Nalani hula school, most impressively
during a spectacular "stick dance," in which 50 members rhythmically
tapped sticks and staffs with the precision of a line of Pacific
Island Rockettes.</TE>
<TE>   The show's headliner, singer-songwriter-guitarist Keali'l Reichel,
also used dancers to illustrate his songs in the elegant, descriptive
movements characteristic of Hawaiian dance, but his presentation
seemed a bit bland in contrast. But that had less to do with quality
than with positioning. Reichel's richly melodic songs, which drew
enthusiastic applause from an audience that clearly knew his music,
seamlessly blended Hawaiian tradition with pop sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Still, one couldn't help but feel that both his artistry and the
evening would have been better served had the program been reversed,
with Reichel's tunes setting the stage for a spectacular closing set
by Les Grands Ballet de Tahiti.</TE>

<LD>"On a lighter note," said David Baerwald during his show at the Mint
on Sunday, to introduce a noir-ish out-of-love song titled "The
Toughest Whore in Babylon."</LD>
<LD>   Well, that was a lighter note compared with the thematic thread of
several songs he'd just done from his album "Here Comes the New Folk
Underground." The album, due July 16, is drawn from songs he'd
written and originally recorded after the death of a friend's
7-year-old son four years ago, and they offer support for an argument
that no human emotion--not love, not anger, not fear--is greater than
grief.</LD>
<LD>   What the experience seems to have done for Baerwald is soften and
humanize the detachment that long marked his savage, cynical
observations. Even such older songs as the jaundiced L.A. tour
"Boomtown," from his days with the duo David + David, took on
warmth-by-association alongside the newer songs.</LD>
<TE>   Working with a four-piece band anchored by bassist Will Sexton on
Sunday--the first of two nights on a bill with singer-songwriters
Abra Moore and Sheila Nicholls--the former Angeleno (he's now based
in Austin) split the difference between Woody Guthrie and Tom Waits
musically and lyrically.</TE>
<TE>   Not that he's backed off from the blunt, Brechtian sociopolitical
brutality of his last solo album, "Triage" (1993). But in the new
"Hellbound Train," which charged along like "Highway 61
Revisited"-period Dylan, he places himself in the locomotive among
doomed abusers of power. And when, in a monologue added to the song,
the devil tells him he deserves to be there, he shrugs and says, "You
got a point there, buddy."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't even too jarring when he followed that with a solo
acoustic encore of "Come What May," the baldly sentimental love song
Baerwald co-wrote for the movie "Moulin Rouge."</TE>
<TE>   With no ironic winks, it further humanized Baerwald as an artist
of earnest emotions, dark and light.</TE>

<HD>Clooney's Troubles Honed Her Talent</HD>
<DH>When the singer came back from a series of personal
setbacks, her music had a new depth and control</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD REICH</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Rosemary Clooney first attained stardom in the early 1950s, she
looked and sounded no different from a generation of blond beauties
who had seduced the American listening public.</LD>
<LD>   Like Doris Day, Dinah Shore, June Christy and scores more, Clooney
was easy on the eyes and the ears.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't until Clooney's career and personal life took a nosedive
in the late 1960s--with a series of chemical addictions, romantic
disappointments and psychiatric crises--that she began to emerge as
an artist with something distinct and profound to say.</LD>
<TE>   When Clooney died Saturday night in her Beverly Hills home, at 74,
she not only had long since reclaimed her place in American culture
but, more important, had created a body of recorded work of the
highest artistic caliber.</TE>
<TE>   Had Clooney simply disappeared from the scene at the time of her
downfall in the late '60s, she would be remembered today merely as
another '50s has-been who chirped the forgettable lyrics to "Come
On-a My House" (her first million-seller, in 1950). But like her
friend and mentor Frank Sinatra, Clooney used the most turbulent
chapters of her life as grist for a new and deeper art form, which
kept her before the public throughout the 1980s and '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Though music lovers and moviegoers of the '50s may have assumed
that the pert, perennially smiling singer epitomized an all-American
wholesomeness, Clooney in fact already had seen a darker side to
life. Her father's heavy drinking prompted her parents to separate
frequently, with Clooney, brother Nick (father of actor George
Clooney) and sister Betty shuttled among various relatives' homes in
and around Maysville, Ky., where Rosemary was born on May 23, 1928.</TE>
<TE>   Drafted into a form of show business by their grandfather Andrew
Clooney, an Ohio politician who teamed Rosemary and Betty as a
singing duo for political rallies, the sisters in the mid-1940s won a
nightly gig crooning on Cincinnati radio station WLW. Like most
singers of the day, the Clooney sisters launched their careers in
earnest singing in front of a big band, with bandleader Tony Pastor
hiring them in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   The grueling road trips persuaded Betty to quit show business in
1949. But Rosemary persevered, heading to New York and in 1950
signing with one of the biggest labels in the country, Columbia. A
year later, she became a national phenomenon, singing the insipid
lyrics to "Come On-a My House," a tune she at first refused to
record. But when she told Columbia executive Mitch Miller she
wouldn't sing it, he said, "Well, let me put it this way. I will fire
you unless you show up tomorrow," she recalled in her 1977
autobiography, "This for Remembrance."</TE>
<TE>   Of the five musicals Clooney filmed for Paramount in the 1950s,
"White Christmas" (1954) helped establish her as an American icon
singing alongside no less than Bing Crosby, who became a close friend
and later would help her salvage her career.</TE>
<TE>   But even as Clooney enjoyed quick commercial success and
international fame, the fault lines of her future were beginning to
show. A marriage to actor Jose Ferrer in 1953 produced five children
but also considerable heartache, with Ferrer disinclined to stay
faithful to his wife, Clooney said. The two divorced in 1961,
remarried and divorced again in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   For Clooney, the turning point came in 1968, when her relationship
with a young musician ended abruptly and her friend, Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy, was assassinated at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.
Clooney was at the hotel at the time.</TE>
<TE>   These events, she said, heightened her depression and opened the
door to addictions to sleeping pills, tranquilizers and other
prescription drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody could approach me," she wrote in her memoirs. "I was like
a hand grenade with the pin pulled. Nobody could tell whether it was
a dud or the real thing, because one minute I could be completely
sweet and kind, the next, a raving monster."</TE>
<TE>   In July, she stormed off the stage in Reno, jumped into her car
and began driving on the wrong side of a mountain highway, dodging
cars as they veered toward her.</TE>
<TE>   Her son Miguel remembered that she had become "wild,
uncontrollable. Once she told a cab driver she had a gun and would
kill him. When I started to cry, she shoved a rosary in my hand and
told me to pray for him."</TE>
<TE>   Clooney was on the "brink of despair," she observed, and was
admitted to the psychiatric ward of St. John's Hospital in Santa
Monica.</TE>
<TE>   But this was the point at which Clooney reinvented herself. Rather
than succumb to her demons, she struggled through four years of
therapy before gingerly attempting a comeback, in 1972, at the Tivoli
Gardens in Copenhagen.</TE>
<TE>   "She was so ill that it was doubtful that she would ever sing
again," singer Michael Feinstein told the Tribune in 1992, on the eve
of a joint performance with Clooney at Chicago's Shubert Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   "So the fact that she came back is almost unbelievable. But she
has come back with, of course, a greater maturity and a lower vocal
range that has suited her nicely."</TE>
<TE>   More than that, Clooney in the late '70s started to sing with a
degree of control, understatement and interpretive depth that no one
would have expected from the artist who made her name with "Come On-a
My House." She documented this new art with two dozen exceptional
recordings for Concord, an independent California label that allowed
Clooney to explore jazz rhythms and phrasings.</TE>
<TE>   Clooney caressed every syllable of a lyric. There was a
fearlessness in her incomparably slow tempos, and she impressed with
the perfection of her pitch and the musicianship of her delivery.</TE>
<TE>   "I never really thought about how long it could all last," she
said in a 1992 interview, "but I do know that although I've been a
mother and a wife, I've been a singer longer than anything. It's the
thing that comes most naturally to me."</TE>

<LD>Walk into any children's hospital and you're bound to come upon a
gut-wrenching, heart-tugging, tragic or joyful story in a matter of
minutes. The problem for a filmmaker is how to tell this story
without drowning the viewer in an emotional swamp. Tonight's first
installment of the PBS series "Children's Hospital" throws off plenty
of emotion, along with some graphic footage. There are two lovable
children--a 10-month-old baby named Christian and an energetic, older
boy named Quantell--both in need of liver transplants.</LD>
<LD>   But the show--set at Chicago's Children's Memorial Hospital--leaps
into the lives of these children and their families too abruptly. We
don't have time to learn who exactly they are and why we are supposed
to care about them right off the bat.</LD>
<LD>   Those who stick with it past the first half of the hourlong
episode, "Decisions" (9 p.m. KCET and KVCR) eventually will come to
have strong feelings for adorable Christian, whose older brother
already had a liver transplant and is thriving, and Quantell, whose
good-natured candor makes him quite the charmer. The trick is to stay
with it that long.</LD>
<TE>   They say timing is everything, and "Children's Hospital" has the
misfortune of following in the footsteps of ABC's "Houston Medical,"
which began last week and is probably the best medical documentary in
some time.</TE>
<TE>   There are many differences between the two shows, but to name the
most obvious: character development and something journalists call a
nut graph--that is, a paragraph that lets the reader/viewer know why
they should care about what they are watching. In television or film,
these elements must be incorporated into the storytelling. "Houston
Medical" does this effectively. "Children's Hospital" doesn't.</TE>

<HD>Size Doesn't Matter in Carpool Lanes</HD>
<DH>A reader suggests that children should not qualify drivers
to use the restricted areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the last three decades, Southern California has developed the
largest carpool lane system in the nation. Over that same period,
solo commuters have devised some pretty outlandish schemes to try to
drive in the Southland's diamond lanes.</LD>
<LD>   We've all heard the stories of the pregnant woman who claimed her
unborn child as a passenger. And then there's the tale of the hearse
driver who suggested the body in the casket qualified him for the
carpool lane. Motorists have even propped up dummies in the passenger
seat and outfitted dogs with hats and sunglasses to sneak into the
smoother-flowing lanes.</LD>
<LD>   Gersten Schachne, a college professor who lives in the San
Fernando Valley, wrote to Behind the Wheel to gripe about what he
sees as yet another scam to use the carpool lanes.</LD>
<TE>   Question: Many times I am driving in the "fast lane" but am stuck
in traffic. I see many cars in the carpool lane with two or more
passengers, but they are children--who cannot drive a car. Now, since
the purpose of the carpool lane is to encourage two or more drivers
to share the ride so as to remove cars from the road, aren't these
parents and children carpoolers illegally using the carpool lane?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: For the record, carpool lanes are restricted to cars with
at least two living, breathing human beings.</TE>
<TE>   To meet the true purpose of the carpool lane, Gersten seems to
suggest that the state should restrict these lanes to vehicles
carrying at least two legal-age drivers. The problem with that idea
is that the California Highway Patrol would then be required to stop
and check the ages of all carpool passengers who look a bit under the
driving age.</TE>
<TE>   "It would just be too much of an enforcement problem," said Dawn
Helou, who oversees carpool projects for the state Department of
Transportation in Los Angeles and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, the CHP already has its hands full looking out for
carpool users carrying mannequins and hat-wearing dogs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of shocking sights on the freeway, Deane Bottorf of
Corona del Mar wrote to say that he occasionally sees drivers on the
road who are so short that they can barely peek over the dashboard to
see the road ahead. Those diminutive motorists must look through the
steering wheel to navigate through traffic, he said</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is there a legal requirement for "height of eyeballs above the
steering wheel?"</TE>
<TE>   A: The Department of Motor Vehicles has no height requirement for
driver's license applicants. DMV spokesman Steve Haskins said even
the tiniest of drivers can qualify for a license if they can prove
during a driving test that they can safely maneuver a car. The DMV
will even allow drivers to sit on pillows and cushions during the
test.</TE>
<TE>   If a CHP officer sees someone who appears physically unable to
steer or brake a car, the patrol can require the driver to reapply
for a license. But that decision is based on physical abilities, not
physical dimensions.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the alternative:</TE>
<TE>   CHP Officer: "Do you know why I pulled you over, sir?"</TE>
<TE>   Driver: "No. Was I speeding?"</TE>
<TE>   CHP Officer: "No, sir. You just look kinda short and chunky. Can
you please step out of the car so I can measure you?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In two previous columns, readers offered some pretty imaginative
ideas for putting a quick end to those annoying and dangerous police
pursuits that often clog our freeways.</TE>
<TE>   The suggestions ranged from deploying snipers to disable fleeing
vehicles with armor-piercing bullets to using helicopters with
super-powerful magnets to pluck the offending cars off the freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the suggestions bring to mind a quote from the movie "This
Is Spinal Tap": "There is a fine line between clever and stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Rudy Paige Pagliaccio of Los Angeles offered an idea that seems to
be on the clever side of that line.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why can't coppers in choppers drop a little magnetized tracking
device gently on the roof of the bad guy's car? Police can follow at
a safe speed while others are informed of the car's location by
computer tracking. When they get to a safe, convenient place to
collect ... then call Schwarzenegger!</TE>
<TE>   A: CHP Sgt. Dean James Gogios, who runs the department's
high-speed driver training center in Sacramento, said Rudy's idea has
some merit. Unfortunately, he said, police in a helicopter 250 feet
in the air probably can't drop a magnetized device on the roof of a
speeding car with much accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   Gogios points out that the CHP is testing all sorts of devices to
put an end to such pursuits. For example, he said, the patrol is
looking at a newfangled gun, designed for the Army, that can disable
a fleeing car by shooting an electronic beam that short-circuits a
car's electrical components.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Gogios said, the gun is not ready for freeway use.
It can disable a car, he said, but there is still some concern that
the electronic beam may have a harmful effect on people inside.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Like most Southern California motorists, Jay Baker of Los Angeles
spends a lot of time sitting in traffic--so much time, in fact, that
he has started to fixate on the junk he sees alongside the road.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote to say that he often sees dislodged bumpers on the side
of the freeway after an accident has been cleared away. He says the
bumpers can lie along the freeways for months, even years.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is this a planned phenomenon or merely a coincidence?</TE>
<TE>   A: Sorry, Jay, but Caltrans spokeswoman Pat Reid doesn't buy your
story. She said Caltrans sends sweepers to clean the pavement of
broken glass and other bits of debris after an accident. A trash
truck follows the sweeper to collect bigger junk, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Reid said she doubts that discarded bumpers go overlooked for
several months. "It just isn't something that happens," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Jay's bumper problem aside, no one can dispute that Southern
California freeways are often cluttered with some pretty strange
stuff.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a few years ago, volunteers who adopt certain stretches
of freeway in Los Angeles reported discovering the following
oddities: a size-40 bra, an uncashed check for $7,000, false teeth,
handcuffs, men's edible underwear (cherry flavor) and a dog's head in
a bag.</TE>
<TE>   If you come across such weirdness on the roadside, please send a
letter or e-mail to Behind the Wheel. We will try to compile a top 10
list of oddities for future publication.</TE>
<TE>   Please, don't send the roadway jetsam to us--unless, of course,
you come across some of those uncashed checks.</TE>

<HD>Ovitz: I'm 'a Victim'</HD>
<DH>In an upcoming interview with Vanity Fair, the former mogul
rocks Hollywood by blaming the industry's 'gay mafia' for many of his
troubles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a town where corporate brutality is suavely masked behind a smile,
onetime mogul Michael Ovitz has shattered protocol and stunned
hard-to-shock Hollywood by lashing out at what he calls the
industry's "gay mafia" in a forthcoming Vanity Fair article.</LD>
<LD>   Ovitz told the magazine he was convinced he was the victim of a
well-orchestrated strategy led, in part, by DreamWorks SKG founder
David Geffen and Ovitz's founding partner at Creative Artists Agency,
Ron Meyer, who now runs Universal Studios.</LD>
<LD>   "I know how hard it is for people to see me as a victim," Ovitz is
quoted as saying, "but in this case it's pretty close to the truth."</LD>
<TE>   Among others Ovitz blames for his downfall are Barry Diller,
chairman of Vivendi Universal Entertainment, as well as L.A.-based
New York Times correspondent Bernard Weinraub and Ovitz's former
boss, Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner. He also took swipes at
other former colleagues at CAA, who now run the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the people Ovitz blames for his demise happen not to be
gay.</TE>
<TE>   "If the only people who resented him were gay, it would be a small
percentage," said Sue Mengers, a retired talent agent whose clients
included Barbra Streisand, Burt Reynolds and Gene Hackman. "Mike
didn't make friends, but so what. What destroyed him was his ego."</TE>
<TE>   Mengers said Ovitz's downfall can be traced back to his
miscalculation that he could return to representing talent when the
Disney gig didn't work out. "Once you show the talent that you really
didn't love them that much, and that there was another gig, you can't
come back," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As the Vanity Fair piece made the rounds of Hollywood fax machines
and e-mail Monday morning, Ovitz could not be reached for comment.
Many of the people he cited in the article returned calls to The
Times but declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   One person who did comment is Bernie Brillstein, co-founder of
Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, one of the most influential management
companies in the business. Brillstein said Ovitz was responsible for
his own downfall and reveals his long-rumored self-destructive streak
in the Vanity Fair piece.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he was out to get himself. He's done it. It's over....
He's on a parade field. They've taken off his epaulets, and now they
have to stab him. He shouldn't work in this town again."</TE>
<TE>   Brillstein's remark brings to mind the late producer Julia
Phillips, who flamed out after spectacular early success on "The
Sting" (1973) then wrote a tell-all book, "You'll Never Eat Lunch in
This Town Again" (1990). For all intents and purposes, she didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Several people Ovitz identified who were contacted by The Times
said the magazine never gave them the opportunity to react in print.
Others, like Geffen, said they were shocked to read Ovitz's
perception of his own rise and fall.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not seriously asking me to comment on this insanity," said
Geffen.</TE>
<TE>   Almost as unusual as the substance of Ovitz's remarks was the fact
they were made at all. For all its behind-the-scenes machinations,
Hollywood prefers to do business beneath a smiling veneer, even if
it's phony, and discretion is almost as important as looks.</TE>
<TE>   Ovitz was always known as one of the most ruthless and brilliant
agents in Hollywood, but this spring and summer, he has tried to
recoup some of the financial and image losses he incurred over the
past six years, a spiral that began after he departed CAA in the
early 1990s for the No. 2 job at Disney. That job lasted 18 months
and sent him into retirement with a handsome severance. He reemerged
in 1999 with a management firm called Artists Management Group that
he sold this year after its television business failed and investors
backed out.</TE>
<TE>   Ovitz, 55, appeared on "The Charlie Rose Show" earlier this year,
protesting that few people know him as he "really" is, a caring man
who was railroaded. This interview in the August issue of Vanity Fair
is the first time he's made the "gay mafia" claim.</TE>
<TE>   Ovitz accused New York Times reporter Weinraub of "parroting" the
spin that Geffen created, and he says he lost all but one asset in
AMG because potential clients heard rumors about him.</TE>
<TE>   Mengers bluntly disputes that.</TE>
<TE>   "What moron puts his own money into something before the deals
were closed?" Mengers said. "He assumed the deals were closed before
they were legally closed. That was his hubris. There was a time when
the perception was that he was the smartest guy in town. But his
mistakes show that he wasn't the smartest guy in town."</TE>

<LD>If you walk into Best Buy, Wherehouse or any of the other chain
stores I've visited lately, the CD racks are deserted--the action is
across the aisle in the DVD and video game departments. While the
music business is in a tailspin, trying to battle Internet piracy and
fan alienation, DVDs have become a giant cash machine for Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers are on pace to spend $11 billion on DVD sales and
rentals this year, making it the fastest-growing home-electronic
product ever. DVDs routinely make more money in their opening weekend
than comparable theatrical releases. Video games aren't far behind,
with sales reaching $6.3 billion last year, nearly double what they
were five years ago. The record biz, whose sales were off 10% last
year, is in such bad shape that even Entertainment Weekly's summer
music issue was full of ads ... for DVDs!</LD>
<LD>   So why are movies and video games booming while the music
business, pop culture's trend-setter of the last several decades, is
in such a funk? The people who run record companies gloomily blame
the Internet. But if you ask music and movie lovers, you get a very
different answer. Consumers adore DVDs, which offer cool packaging
and lots of interactive extras; they loathe CDs, which they say are
grossly over-priced and padded with filler.</LD>
<TE>   Pocketbook issues have a lot to do with DVDs' ascension. Two years
ago, most new DVDs were priced between $25 and $30. Now new DVDs sell
for $19.95, with hundreds of older movies going for $9.95 and $14.95.
But even though music sales are down, the record companies aren't
cutting prices-- in fact some CD prices have, if anything, gone up.
New CDs by everyone from Britney Spears to System of a Down go for
$17.99, with older CDs selling for $14 or $15. The only CDs that
regularly sell for $9.99 or 11.99 are by little-known new artists.
When I walked through Best Buy the other day, I was amazed to
discover that the DVDs for "Austin Powers" and "Rush Hour" cost
exactly the same as the movies' CD soundtracks.</TE>
<TE>   New technology is supposed to create new revenue streams, as it
has with DVDs. But the music business views its new technology, the
Internet, as the enemy. With pop radio ruled by a handful of
conglomerates more interested in ad revenues than good music and MTV
abandoning music videos for lifestyle programming like "The
Osbournes," file sharing has become one of the few ways for fans to
hear new music.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the music business has spent more time trying to
stamp out file sharing than aggressively pursuing ways to make money
from it.</TE>
<TE>   For all of the impact the Internet has had, it seems impossible to
ignore the obvious: If consumers have a limited amount of money to
spend, and they buy their home entertainment in the same stores, they
are often going to make a beeline for the DVD section, repository for
the most enticing software and the best deals. The biggest-selling
DVDs have been movies like "X Men," "Gladiator" and "The Fast and the
Furious" that appeal to the same young male audience that dominates
the music business.</TE>
<TE>   "Our core audience is such a similar demographic that we've got to
be impacting the music business," says Craig Kornblau, president of
Universal Studios Home Video. "We're giving consumers lots of extras,
but we're also creating collectible packaging. When you're in a
store, if you go to the DVD section, you'll see all sorts of shapes
and sizes. It's a really involving consumer experience."</TE>
<TE>   But top music executives, such as Jim Urie, president of Universal
Music and Video Distribution, still contend that CDs are a great
product.</TE>
<TE>   "The dissing of CDs is just a ridiculous self-justification for
stealing the music," Urie says. "I hate to see what's going to happen
when DVD burning becomes as prevalent as burning CDs. How are people
going to justify stealing a movie by saying it isn't any good after
the movie's already a $100-million hit?"</TE>
<TE>   Urie says his company doesn't heavily research consumer attitude,
noting, "We tend to ask how can we make more money and sell more
product, not deal with consumer gripes."</TE>
<TE>   I almost wish I had taken Urie along when I visited a 15-year-old
boy's room the other day, hearing him and four of his friends gripe
about record companies while listening to Rancid at high volume. You
know your industry is in trouble when your core audience is as
scornfully dismissive of your business as their parents are about
scandal-ridden companies like Tyco and Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a person I know who doesn't download music," said one
of the boys (because rumors abound that the industry will soon take
legal action against active file-sharers, I've avoided names). "It's
free and easy and I can record it on a blank CD that costs nothing.
Even my dad asks me to download music for him." When asked if
musicians weren't being hurt by the loss of income, another boy
explained, "Come on, if you watch 'Behind the Music,' you always hear
how bands got [ripped off] by their record company. So how am I
hurting them?"</TE>
<TE>   The boys buy CDs, but only from artists they respect, like Rancid
and Eminem. They say if CDs were cheaper--say, $8 or $9--they'd buy
more. "Price is the only reason I don't buy CDs," says a third boy.
"Why would I ever pay $18 for a CD? I could see two movies for that."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, paying for movies is a bigger priority. Most of the boys
can download entire movies, but they prefer to watch them in a
theater with other people. They are contemptuous of possible legal
action from the record industry. "They're not that stupid," says the
first boy. "If they prosecute everyone who's downloading music,
they'd bring down the entire American economy."</TE>
<TE>   Hearing them talk, I couldn't make up my mind if these kids were
the offspring of "Clockwork Orange" or "Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid." Are they spoiled, self-satisfied droogs, the byproduct
of an advertising-drenched consumer culture that has promised them an
inalienable right to every Apple computer, Nike high-top, MP3 and
iPod they could possibly desire? Are they the offspring of every
American outlaw from Jesse James to Abbie Hoffman, full of a vague
anti-authoritarian contempt for corporate profiteering?</TE>
<TE>   Or are they just products of an Internet culture that has them
believing that whatever's on the Web is free for the taking?</TE>
<TE>   Even though Universal made hip-hop crooner Ashanti into a star
overnight in part by offering retailers a rebate, allowing them to
sell the CD for $11.99, Urie argues that lowered prices won't make a
dent in downloading, saying, "The fact that consumers can steal music
sort of trumps anything else we can do."</TE>
<TE>   DVD mavens like Kornblau aren't sitting on their hands. One day,
as he was driving his 12-year-old son to school, Kornblau heard him
complaining about record companies. "I asked him what he would do if
I shut off our DSL and gave him all the money he needed to buy all
the CDs he wanted," Kornblau recalled. "And he didn't want that. He
wants to download. It's clearly not just about the money, it's about
the subversive challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Believing he should get to know his enemy, Kornblau is bringing
his son into the office to meet his marketing team and show them the
sites he visits. "If he's grown up downloading music, imagine what
it'll be like with the kid who's grown up downloading movies," he
says. "It isn't that far away."</TE>
<TE>   It sounds awfully ominous until you recall that when Sony
introduced the VCR, it was sued by Universal, which claimed that
unlawful copying would destroy the movie business. The business not
only survived but, thanks to DVD, it's flourishing. In the
entertainment business, it's fashionable to talk doom and gloom, but
sometimes it's darkest just before dawn.</TE>

<HD>Her Concept: Freedom</HD>
<DH>Singer Albita rediscovers joy after professional and
personal pain subside</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Albita gave her fans an odd admonition when introducing a complex new
song during her powerful concert Sunday at the Mayan Theatre. Don't
read too much into the lyrics, the Cuban diva told her fans. Don't
try to make too much sense of them.</LD>
<LD>   But this song screams out for interpretation. What does she mean
by the sardonic title, "Son Sin Concepto"? How could this son
(referring to the traditional Afro-Cuban genre) not have a concept?
It has more than 60 lines of monologue, a provocative, spoken stream
of thought. And it's addressed directly to the listener ("you") in
such a commanding tone, the singer sounds alternately like a wise
observer, a parent, a guru.</LD>
<LD>   She must be trying to tell us something. Just watch how intensely
she performed it. The way she stepped to the very edge of the stage,
looking over the crowd as if speaking to some invisible figure in the
back. The passion in her, face framed by those disheveled curly red
locks. The moral conscience in that pointed finger, emphasizing a
line like a preacher.</LD>
<TE>   "I want you to be free," the song says in Spanish. "Free in your
heart, free in your soul. Your soul, the only thing absolutely free."</TE>
<TE>   Albita's ardent fans were too busy adoring her and dancing to
engage in verse analysis. If only they had known the real story
behind that song, they might have stopped to study it, despite her
warning.</TE>
<TE>   Albita wrote the "no-concept" song about three years ago, at the
start of a most trying and painful period in her life. The
once-celebrated superstar of Miami's trendy South Beach has endured
the collapse of her recording career, the loss of her only brother to
cancer and the death of her grandmother in her native Cuba, which she
left more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I am barely emerging from a time I wouldn't wish on my worst
enemy," said Albita, 40, during an interview in Spanish the day
before her Mayan show. "Maybe that's why I got this crazy urge to
record my own songs, to rescue so many things. I suddenly felt this
anxiety about dying and not leaving enough of my songs recorded."</TE>
<TE>   In her moving and personal new album, "Hecho a Mano" (Made by
Hand), Albita rescued 11 compositions from the stash of 200
unpublished works she has accumulated over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Though they span her adult life from 1984 to 2000, many selections
share a certain mournfulness, an emptiness and yearning.</TE>
<TE>   Albita has been composing since she was 7, but she's not organized
about cataloging her work. She keeps some on tape, some on paper,
some half written, none clearly labeled.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I try to look for one, it's like I'm moving," she
joked after lunch at a noisy Pasadena restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   She started writing "Son Sin Concepto" after a disappointing
meeting with executives from Sony, her former record company. She had
just finished her previous album, "Son," which would have been her
fourth produced by Emilio Estefan Jr. for Sony's Epic label.</TE>
<TE>   But Albita said the label refused to release it. Why? Because it
didn't have a concept.</TE>
<TE>   The concept, she tried to explain, is the son, that durable,
danceable style that started in rural Cuba at the turn of the century
and later gave rise to modern salsa. The label suggested she should
do some duets, Albita recalls.</TE>
<TE>   The creative disagreement led to a protracted standoff. Sony
wouldn't put the album out, she said, and wouldn't let her have it.
(Sony representatives could not be reached for comment.)</TE>
<TE>   She calls it cruel treatment, a "violation of human rights."
That's an ironic charge from a woman who fled communist Cuba, where,
she said, the government-controlled record industry wasn't interested
in releasing her music either. Her traditional tastes were considered
too old-fashioned at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm used to swimming against the current," she said. Exasperated
with the label, she went straight from the meeting in Miami, where
she lives, to a rehearsal with her former band. She told them what
had happened and came up with the chorus that would become the catchy
kernel of her cathartic tune: "Oye mi son, sin concepto"--hear my son
without a concept.</TE>
<TE>   The spoken parts came later, with arresting verses addressed to a
youth coming home to a drunk father and exploited mother or to a
woman who "must live and die in the kitchen."</TE>
<TE>   "Tu tienes que parir y maquillarte / Tu tienes que parir y ser
decente / Tu tienes que parir y aniquilarte / Tu tienes que parir y
ser bien fuerte." (You must give birth and put on your makeup ... and
be decent ... and vanish ... and be very strong.)</TE>
<TE>   By giving orders as if she's received them, Albita defines the
role and rebels against it simultaneously. Her anger is palpable.</TE>
<TE>   Anger at being trapped, constrained by expectations. In some ways,
she had also been trapped by the high-gloss glamour of her old image,
a stark contrast from her country roots.</TE>
<TE>   It all seems a marketing contrivance now: those androgynous suits
and trendy berets, that bright red lipstick masking her large mouth,
the short hair coifed like a mannequin's.</TE>
<TE>   Albita finally won the rights to her disputed album. She took it
to Times Square Records, a small specialty label in New York, which
released it in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   She then recorded her engrossing new work, an acoustic throwback
to her origins in trova, the New Song movement. The cover shows her
holding her guitar, her lipstick softer, hair now long, loose and
natural.</TE>
<TE>   With a brilliant and jazzy band at the Mayan, she performed four
tunes from the new album during her 90-minute set. A salsa sextet
hasn't played with this much swing since Joe Cuba's seminal group in
the '60s or Ruben Blades' in the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Far from heavy, Albita's show was vibrant, joyful and spontaneous.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed simply in white, she cleansed her spirit onstage with a
frenetic rumba, waving a red scarf over her head to expunge her
troubles. The Santeria ritual was working: Albita appeared to be
having the time of her life.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in that moment when I must carry on and go forward," she said
during the interview. "There's one thing that really helps, and that
is loving what you do."</TE>

<HD>Performing Arts Going Dark</HD>
<DH>Theater* The monthly publication handed out before show
time is folding on Sept. 1. The scramble to find a replacement is on.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California theatergoers accustomed to receiving their program
packaged inside a glossy copy of Performing Arts magazine will be in
for a surprise as of Sept. 1, when the 36-year-old publication goes
out of business.</LD>
<LD>   The closure of Performing Arts, a monthly publication that has
served California theaters since 1965 with Northern and Southern
California regional editions, is collateral damage from a recent East
Coast publishing coup. In early June, Playbill magazine, the
118-year-old program publisher for most Broadway theaters, acquired
its longtime archrival, 75-year-old Stagebill.</LD>
<LD>   Stagebill had purchased Performing Arts magazine last year, so the
California publication went to Playbill as part of a package deal.</LD>
<TE>   "They've been caught in the cross-fire of two New York
publications fighting it out," said a source close to Performing
Arts. Although Playbill may exercise its right to use the Stagebill
or Performing Arts names for new publications, observers of the
situation say that Playbill's primary goal is not to revive those
publications but to prevent another publisher from capitalizing on
its trademarks.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of Playbill and Stagebill did not return calls for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The demise of Performing Arts--offering articles about the
regional performing arts scene along with each theater's own program
pages--has left performing arts venues throughout the state in a
scramble to find another publisher for their 2002-'03 season
programs. Theater officials say a decision must be made within a few
weeks to get programs prepared for September openings.</TE>
<TE>   Performing Arts, supported by advertising, has been provided free
of charge to theaters, except for minimal charges for additional
program pages or other special requests by individual venues. The
magazine is handed out to patrons at between 40 and 50 venues
statewide, about 15 of those in Southern California--including the
L.A. Music Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Mark Taper Forum and
Ahmanson theaters, the Hollywood Bowl, Pasadena Playhouse, Orange
County Center for the Performing Arts and Cerritos Center for the
Performing Arts.</TE>
<TE>   Taking over the costs of self-publishing a program or contracting
with another publisher is "not something that's in a lot of theaters'
budgets," said Pasadena Playhouse General Manager Brian Colburn.</TE>
<TE>   "This is exactly the wrong time; it's as bad as it could be," said
Catherine Babcock, director of marketing and communications for the
Los Angeles Music Center. "We have been doing quite a lot of calling
to our counterparts in other Southern California arts organizations,
and all of them are about in the same place we are, trying to get
over the shock and move on to what we are going to do."</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition of Stagebill and Performing Arts by Playbill is
reverberating across the country, as theaters in New York, Chicago
and other cities that used Stagebill consider their alternatives. In
light of the changes, representatives of performing arts venues from
around the country are organizing a July 8 meeting in New York to
discuss their options, including self-publishing or negotiating new
contracts with other publishers. At least one alternative publisher,
Seattle-based Encore Media Group, has come to Los Angeles to talk
with leadership at area venues, including the Music Center.</TE>
<TE>   Theaters may also end up striking a deal with Playbill. Some Los
Angeles-area theaters already use Playbill, including the Pantages,
Wilshire and Canon theaters. But some administrators are concerned
about Playbill's size--approximately 5 inches by 8 inches, versus the
approximately 8-inch-by-10 1/2-inch Performing Arts magazine--and,
more important, whether Playbill will offer West Coast performing
arts stories, rather than a generic product.</TE>
<TE>   Although Playbill officials have met with leaders at some of the
larger Los Angeles venues--including the Music Center and Orange
County Center for the Performing Arts--officials of those centers as
well as others say Playbill has not offered any specific contract
proposals to date, nor a promise that the company would be prepared
to provide Playbill to them by September.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of theaters have been told that Playbill is 'going to get
back to them,' " said Pasadena Playhouse's Colburn. "Well, we're not
going to wait around for them to decide. We have some ideas."</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Withheld Data, Says Ex-Auditor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp. pressed former auditor Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu to certify an incomplete report to lenders and tried to
withhold information from the accounting firm and the government,
Deloitte said in a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The cable operator, which hasn't released a 2001 financial report,
fired Deloitte on June 9. Adelphia hasn't said when it will be able
to provide accurate results after appointing a board committee to
investigate improper accounting.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia is under investigation by the SEC and prosecutors in two
states after disclosing that it guaranteed $3.1 billion in loans to
partnerships controlled by founder John Rigas and his family. The
company also has said it overstated revenue and profit for the last
two years as well as the number of cable subscribers.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC is investigating Deloitte's audit work.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia asked the accounting firm to sign off on a financial
report to lenders without proof that the cable company had obtained
relaxed terms under a loan agreement, Deloitte said in a June 27
letter to the SEC included in an Adelphia regulatory filing Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia said it will respond to Deloitte's statements in a
subsequent filing. In a May 10 meeting with the SEC, Adelphia failed
to provide regulators with a letter from company attorneys explaining
Adelphia's accounting treatment of the loans to Rigas partnerships.
Adelphia later gave Deloitte and the SEC the letter after Deloitte
refused to issue a report unless Adelphia did so.</TE>
<TE>   Deloitte also said it became concerned about Adelphia's accounting
in April after the company transferred $102 million in set-top boxes
that it had bought in October to an entity controlled by the Rigas
family that didn't have any cable operations.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia recorded the debt for purchasing the cable boxes on the
books of a different family-controlled entity, which removed $102
million in debt from the company's balance sheet. After the
accounting firm questioned the transaction, Deloitte said Adelphia
agreed to record the cable boxes and debt on its books.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, L.A. city officials said Adelphia missed a quarterly
franchise fee payment.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia shares fell a half cent, or 3.1%, to 15.5 cents in
over-the-counter trading.</TE>

<HD>TRW Buyout Could Boost Job Prospects</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Analysts say employment in the sector should
stabilize because of Northrop's financial horsepower.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp.'s purchase of TRW Inc. could improve growth
prospects for Southern California's defense industry and result in
few if any layoffs, unlike past defense mergers that brought
devastating job cuts for the region, officials and analysts said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "I see no layoffs or strong consolidations [of plants] occurring
in Southern California," Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa said after
announcing the $7.8-billion deal.</LD>
<LD>   The potential job growth reflects increased U.S. spending for
defense and homeland security that could drive more contracts to
Northrop, they said. But any job creation would pale next to the tens
of thousands of layoffs that nearly gutted Southern California's
once-vaunted aerospace industry during the 1990s, when a plunge in
post-Cold War defense spending and a spree of industry consolidation
dramatically shrank the region's work force.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, aerospace employment still is slipping. In the Los
Angeles-Long Beach metropolitan area, for instance, jobs related to
the production of aircraft, missiles, spacecraft and parts totaled
45,700 in May, down from 47,300 in December, according to the
California Employment Development Department. A dozen years ago, such
aerospace jobs totaled nearly 132,000.</TE>
<TE>   But for the 10,000 people who work for TRW in Southern
California--especially the 8,700 at its satellite and electronics
base in Redondo Beach--the outlook is more promising. Northrop is
buying TRW precisely because it is not a significant player in TRW's
fields of satellites, laser weapons and missile defense systems, so
there won't be the overlap that leads to widespread job cuts.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, TRW would get Northrop's added financial
horsepower to boost its vaunted research-and-development skills, and
Northrop would benefit from having an even bigger stable of defense
capabilities when it bids for Pentagon contracts. All of that should
stabilize employment in the region's aerospace sector, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The merger would be "neutral to positive from the Southern
California standpoint," said Jon B. Kutler, president of Quarterdeck
Investment Partners Inc., an investment banking firm that focuses on
defense. "This should not result in headcount reductions." TRW also
has workers in Carson and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Beach hopes to "maintain as many of the [TRW] jobs in the
community as possible," Mayor Greg Hill said, because TRW is by far
the largest private employer in the city of 64,000. He expressed hope
that the merger would lead to more contracts going forward and even
an increase in jobs in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop, based in Century City, has 12,500 employees in Southern
California, with its largest plants in El Segundo (where it builds
parts of the F/A-18 fighter jet), San Diego, Woodland Hills, Palmdale
and Azusa.</TE>
<TE>   After it buys TRW, Northrop not only would be the second- largest
defense company behind Lockheed Martin Corp. but also would benefit
from the growth in spending on conventional defense and new homeland
security initiatives, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense spending on the procurement of aircraft, ships, weapons,
supplies and other equipment is projected by the White House to surge
from $62 billion this year to about $92 billion in 2007, and "you
would have to go back to the Reagan buildup in the early 1980s" to
find so large a peacetime increase in that period of time, said Steve
Kosiak, a director at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary
Assessments, a nonpartisan researcher of defense spending.</TE>
<TE>   There is no guarantee that that much money will be approved by
Congress, or whether a larger-than-expected portion will be spent on
maintaining the Pentagon's existing programs instead of new weaponry
or systems. Still, Northrop and TRW would benefit even from continued
spending on programs they already have underway, said Richard
Aboulafia, an analyst at Teal Group, an aerospace research firm in
Fairfax, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything involving missile defense and systems integration are
much faster growth areas" in the defense budget, he said, "and
Northrop and TRW are well-positioned to take advantage of both."</TE>

<HD>AIDS Patient Group Sues Drug Maker Over Pricing</HD>
<DH>Courts: Organization's lawsuit alleges that GlaxoSmithKline
abuses the patent system and overcharges for three of its
medications.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA KEATING</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the largest AIDS organization in the
United States, on Monday filed a lawsuit against Britain's
GlaxoSmithKline, accusing the drug maker of antitrust violations and
overcharging for its medicines.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed in a Los Angeles federal court, alleges antitrust
and patent violations regarding Glaxo's antiviral drugs AZT, 3TC and
Ziagen.</LD>
<LD>   The prices for those big-selling drugs "exorbitantly exceed its
costs of licensing, manufacturing and distributing," the lawsuit
said.</LD>
<TE>   The AIDS Healthcare Foundation is seeking $66 million in damages
and to invalidate six patents for the drugs and their applications,
contending they were developed with public funds.</TE>
<TE>   "GlaxoSmithKline has engaged in patent piracy for 17 years,"
foundation President Michael Weinstein said at a Los Angeles news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   "Glaxo has made tens of billions of dollars in ill-gotten gains
and has deprived millions of people around the globe of treatment,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, Glaxo expressed disappointment that the AIDS
Healthcare Foundation was pursuing its argument in court.</TE>
<TE>   "GlaxoSmithKline does not believe that litigation is the
appropriate pathway to resolve matters such as these," a spokesman
said.</TE>
<TE>   AZT was developed as a chemotherapy drug in 1964 with U.S.
government assistance, and Ziagen and 3TC were discovered at the
University of Minnesota and Emory University, the suit says.</TE>
<TE>   Burroughs Wellcome Co., which later merged with Glaxo, began
producing AZT in 1983 after the National Institutes of Health asked
the company to find an existing drug to treat HIV infections, the
suit said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, Burroughs filed patent applications for AZT and AZT
treatments in Britain and the United States, falsely claiming its
scientists had discovered the drug and its application to HIV,
according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Burroughs also obtained exclusive licenses to manufacture and
market 3TC and Ziagen in the early 1990s from the universities, which
still hold the patents.</TE>
<TE>   The three drugs make up the first-line "drug cocktail" used to
control HIV infections.</TE>
<TE>   Glaxo sells about $2 billion of each of the drugs each year,
Weinstein said.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit says Glaxo's monopoly has hiked drug prices for the
foundation's 12,000 patients in the U.S. and African clinics to
$10,600 a year, compared with the $400 paid annually by AIDS patients
in countries that sell generic versions.</TE>

<LD>WorldCom Inc. founder Bernard J. Ebbers, a key figure in the
$3.9-billion accounting scandal that has placed the
telecommunications giant near bankruptcy, told members of his church
that he is no crook.</LD>
<LD>   Ebbers spoke briefly Sunday to members of Easthaven Baptist Church
in Brookhaven where he attends services and teaches Sunday school.</LD>
<LD>   Congregation members say Ebbers told them he didn't know what
would happen or what mistakes were made, but "no one will find me to
have knowingly committed fraud."</LD>
<TE>   With his emotional talk to the several hundred people in
attendance, Ebbers seemed to be answering a question that's surfaced
repeatedly as state and federal investigators begin their probe: How
much did he know?</TE>
<TE>   Church members responded to his comments with a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt it was something he should have done for the church's
benefit," said Tommy Ready, who owns a rental company in Brookhaven
and attended the service. "I felt like what he did was positive, and
the response from the congregation was positive."</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers has been revered in Mississippi for giving the state its
only Fortune 500 company and creating the opportunity for some local
investors to make a fortune. He also has been a major benefactor to
his alma mater, Mississippi College, and helped bring minor league
professional hockey to Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   He lives in Brookhaven, about 60 miles south of Jackson, and many
of his early supporters and investors were hometown friends.</TE>
<TE>   As his telecommunications business grew, Ebbers shifted the base
of operations to Jackson before a squabble with city leaders led him
six years ago to Clinton, about 12 miles west of the capital.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Allergan Inc., maker of the wrinkle-reducing compound Botox,
completed its transition to a pure pharmaceutical firm as its
eye-care unit began trading as a separate company.</LD>
<LD>   The new firm, Advanced Medical Optics Inc., makes eye and contact
lens-care products, including Complete, Consept and Blink-n-Clean
brands. Its ophthalmic surgical products are widely used in cataract
surgery and Lasik procedures.</LD>
<LD>   Based in Santa Ana, AMO forecasts annual sales of about $540
million, nearly 31% of Allergan's estimated annual revenue before the
spinoff.</LD>
<TE>   Allergan distributed the new company to shareholders through a
tax-free dividend. Shares of AMO closed at $10.29 on the NYSE, where
shares of Allergan fell 6 cents to $64.25.</TE>

<LD>Negotiations between transpacific shipping companies and dockworkers
continued as the three-year contract covering all U.S. ports along
the West Coast expired at 5 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Despite fears of work disruptions by some importers and exporters,
both sides pledged to continue talking until they reach agreement,
with the thorniest issues continuing to be health benefits and the
introduction of technology.</LD>
<LD>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which is negotiating for major
shipping lines and stevedoring companies, said it would consider a
"defensive shutdown" of the ports if it detects a slowdown by the
union.</LD>
<TE>   However, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which
represents slightly more than 10,000 dockworkers, said it had not
considered a slowdown or a strike. The 1999 contract was reached two
weeks after the previous agreement expired.</TE>

<HD>Cardiac Science Bid to Block Zoll Sales Denied</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardiac Science Inc. lost a bid to block rival Zoll Medical Corp.
from selling heart defibrillators used in public places.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles denied Cardiac
Science's request after hearing arguments. The Irvine-based company
sued in March, days after Zoll received Food and Drug Administration
approval for an automated external defibrillator that can be used by
trained people such as lifeguards and flight attendants.</LD>
<LD>   Zoll had sold its products only to hospitals and emergency workers
before the FDA approval.</LD>
<TE>   Cardiac Science claims that Zoll merely tinkered with its patented
method of measuring force on a patient's chest during cardiopulmonary
resuscitation. Zoll counters that its defibrillator is significantly
different because it measures the distance the patient's chest is
compressed.</TE>
<TE>   Before news of the decision was released, Cardiac Science closed
off 21 cents at $3.50 on Nasdaq, and Zoll rose 61 cents to $33.14 on
the NYSE.</TE>

Federal Trade Commission charges that they violated federal fair

from the debt collection business, the FTC said. Cohen could not be
reached for comment.</LD>
<LD>   The agency accused D.C. Credit of providing inaccurate information
on consumers' credit histories to credit-reporting bureaus, which
could hurt their chances of getting loans. The agency also accused
D.C. Credit of harassing consumers while trying to collect debts.</LD>

<LD>Industrial developer Watson Land Co. said it has acquired a 32-acre
parcel near the giant Kaiser Commerce Center in the Inland Empire for
$7.3 million in what will be the company's first real estate
development outside its traditional base in the South Bay.</LD>
<LD>   The San Bernardino County site with frontage along the 10 Freeway
near Etiwanda Avenue can accommodate a combination of industrial,
office, retail and hotel development. Officials with Carson-based
Watson Land said the firm has already been approached by several
retailers.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which has developed more than 1,000 acres of
industrial properties, said its expansion into the Inland Empire is
based on long-term projections of demand for industrial space.</LD>
<TE>   "We are actively seeking acquisitions in top Southern California
industrial markets such as the Inland Empire," said Jefferson Hill
Jr., vice president of acquisitions for Watson Land.</TE>
<TE>   Watson Land owns and manages about 12 million square feet of
industrial space in Carson, the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach
and other locations.</TE>

<HD>Factory Output Increases in June</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Manufacturing--knocked down by last year's recession--in June turned
in its strongest performance in nearly two years, but construction
spending in May dipped to a five-month low.</LD>
<LD>   The latest snapshot of the economy Monday suggested the recovery
remains on track but improvements are spotty, economists said.</LD>
<LD>   The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index jumped
to 56.2 in June, the highest level since February 2000, and up from a
reading of 55.7 in May. An index above 50 signifies growth in
manufacturing, while a figure below 50 shows contraction. It marked
the fifth month in a row that manufacturing expanded.</LD>
<TE>   That's good news for the economy and for manufacturing, which cut
production during the slump and saw hundreds of thousands of jobs
evaporate.</TE>
<TE>   "Manufacturers are staging a valiant comeback ... but that
comeback has not developed to the point where factories are rehiring
in any great numbers," said economist Ken Mayland, president of
ClearView Economics. "We're close, but not quite there yet."</TE>
<TE>   ISM's manufacturing index in June was stronger than the 55.5
reading many analysts were forecasting.</TE>
<TE>   But construction spending turned out to be weaker than expected.
The value of all construction projects dropped 0.7% in May to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $852 billion, the lowest level
since December, the Commerce Department said. Many analysts were
predicting a 0.3% increase. The decline followed a 0.4% rise in April
in construction spending.</TE>
<TE>   May's performance reflected a 3.1% drop in private builders'
spending on commercial projects, such as office buildings and
industrial complexes, which fell to a rate of $173 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the slump, the residential side of the construction
market powered ahead as low mortgage rates motivated home buyers.</TE>
<TE>   However, the commercial side has been turning in lackluster
performances as businesses cut investment in new plants and
buildings. They probably won't step up such investment until they
feel more assured about the recovery, economists said.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Electronic Data Systems Corp. said Monday its 2002 operating earnings
could be hurt if WorldCom Inc. fails to pay its bills, sending shares
of the No. 2 computer services company tumbling to lows not seen
since October 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Plano, Texas-based EDS--which competes in the market for computer
services against IBM Corp.--said it expects WorldCom, one of its
biggest customers, to account for $160 million to $175 million of its
revenue in 2002. That equates to 3 cents to 4 cents a share in the
third and fourth quarters this year.</LD>
<LD>   EDS said it believed "WorldCom would continue to require
substantial information technology services," but added that if
WorldCom did not need the services and subsequently did not pay EDS,
"these developments could be material to results of operations in
2002."</LD>
<TE>   EDS also said it might have to write off about $90 million worth
of assets--computer hardware and software dedicated to WorldCom--if
the WorldCom contract falls through. EDS shares closed down more than
18%, or $6.70, at $30.45, less than half of their 52-week high of
$72.</TE>

to $60.80 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   An outside company employed by Idec that assembles the kits
required for administering Zevalin needs to change procedures to meet
guidelines from the EMEA, the European Union regulator, said Schering
spokesman Oliver Renner. Schering expects no effect on sales and
earnings this year, he added.</LD>
<TE>   The German company still expects Zevalin, a radiotherapy treatment
for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, to generate sales of $49.7 million three
years after introduction, Renner said.</TE>
<TE>   Idec has the rights to sell the treatment in the U.S. The drug may
have peak sales of $100 million by 2007, Lehman Bros. analysts
estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Schering had planned to bring Zevalin to market in the next six
months after the Food and Drug Administration approved Zevalin for
marketing in February.</TE>
<TE>   Zevalin wasn't expected to contribute to Idec's 2002 European
sales, and it will represent less than 1 cent a share of the
company's 2003 profit, said Eric Ende, a Merrill Lynch analyst who
has a "buy" rating on Idec shares and said he doesn't hold them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a psychological negative," Ende said.</TE>
<TE>   Idec, which last year posted net income of $102 million on sales
of $273 million, said that it might give more information in a
conference call July 17.</TE>
<TE>   "The clinical efficacy of Zevalin is not in question," said
Joachim-Friedrich Kapp, head of the German company's specialized
therapeutics area. "We are confident we'll be able to launch Zevalin
during the second half of 2003."</TE>

<HD>Nasdaq Closes at Five-Year Low</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Renewed selling drags tech sector below Sept. 21
levels. Blue chips slide despite upbeat data.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA and TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bear market in technology stocks hit new lows Monday, as a fresh
wave of selling drove the Nasdaq composite index to its weakest close
in five years.</LD>
<LD>   The broad market also was sharply lower on the first day of the
third quarter, dashing hopes that investors might be ready to look
past corporate scandals and focus on the improving economy.</LD>
<LD>   The Nasdaq index, dominated by tech giants, plunged 59.41 points,
or 4.1%, to 1,403.80. That eclipsed the closing low of 1,423.19 set
on Sept. 21, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Monday's close was the lowest for Nasdaq since June 10,
1997--which was long before talk of a "new economy" led by technology
companies had become all the rage on Wall Street and Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   Measured from its record high of 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000, the
Nasdaq index has plummeted 72.2%. That is nearing the 75.8% decline
in Japan's Nikkei 225 index, measured from that index's peak of
38,915 on the last trading day of 1989 to its low of 9,420 set in
February of this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq loss so far trails the near-total wipeout of key U.S.
stock indexes in 1929-32.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average lost 90% of its value in that
period.</TE>
<TE>   Tech shares were led lower Monday as trading in scandal-ridden
WorldCom resumed on Nasdaq. WorldCom shares dived 77 cents to close
at 6 cents on record volume of more than 1.5 billion shares.
WorldCom's volume accounted for more than half of Nasdaq's total
volume for the session.</TE>
<TE>   Blue-chip indexes also were hammered but their losses were modest
compared with Nasdaq's. The Dow industrials fell 133.47 points, or
1.4%, to 9,109.79.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index sank 21.17 points, or 2.1%, to
968.65, holding just a few points above its Sept. 21 low of 965.80.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst said investors returned from the weekend in a selling
mood, as doubts about the trustworthiness of corporate
accounting--and corporate management in general--continued to weigh
heavily on sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   "Our nerves are going to continue to be tested until some of these
scandals are resolved," said Alan Skrainka, chief investment
strategist with brokerage Edward Jones. "Our message to investors is
patience and courage."</TE>
<TE>   Worries about possible terrorist attacks on July 4 contributed to
the selling pressure, traders said.</TE>
<TE>   But "these corporate scandals do more harm to the market than
anything Al Qaeda is going to do," said Scott Wren, equity strategist
at brokerage A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a short seller's paradise," said Jack Francis, managing
director and head of Nasdaq trading at UBS Warburg, referring to the
bearish strategy of borrowing stock and selling, betting on lower
prices.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 index is down 15.6% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   Big-name stocks falling sharply Monday included IBM, down $4.40 to
$67.60; GM, down $2.63 to $50.82; and Johnson &amp; Johnson, off $1.76 to
$50.50.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq was dragged down by continuing losses in its major tech
names, including Intel, down 73 cents to $17.54; Cisco Systems, down
86 cents to $13.09; and Oracle, down 47 cents to $9.</TE>
<TE>   Losers swamped winners by 24 to 11 on Nasdaq and by 21 to 11 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Within the Nasdaq 100 index--the biggest nonfinancial names on
Nasdaq--96 of the stocks fell.</TE>
<TE>   Biotech shares were particularly weak. The Amex biotech index slid
7.3% to 323.42, lowest since 1999. Major drug stocks also slumped.
Eli Lilly lost $2.64 to $53.76 and Pharmacia dropped $1.25 to $36.20.</TE>
<TE>   One of Wall Street's more bearish investment strategists, Richard
Bernstein of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., on Monday cut his 12-month forecast
for the S&amp;P 500 to 1,050 from 1,200.</TE>
<TE>   A rise to 1,050 would be an 8% gain from the S&amp;P index's Monday
close.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein said he cut his forecast in part because of
"extraordinarily high" valuations on blue-chip stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The market once again ignored upbeat economic news Monday: An
index of manufacturing activity rose in June to its highest level
since February 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Also, industrial and consumer products giant 3M said its
second-quarter earnings before one-time charges will be at least
$1.33 a share. Analysts had expected $1.25. 3M cited higher sales in
Asia.</TE>
<TE>   3M shares jumped $4.40 to $127.40, returning the stock to where it
traded in mid-June.</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturing report helped bolster the dollar. The euro fell
to 98.8 cents from 99.2 cents Friday, while the yen weakened to
120.02 per dollar from 119.66.</TE>
<TE>   On Wall Street, some analysts say the majority of investors are
paralyzed: Many don't want to take losses on the depressed tech
stocks still in their portfolios, and they don't want to buy new
stocks because they don't trust Wall Street analysts or corporate
accounting, Wren said.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, he said, Americans are putting their money into
their homes rather than in stocks.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers are out there spending their money; they just aren't
buying stocks," Wren said. "They are choosing to buy a home and put
the money toward a new front porch or a new pool."</TE>
<TE>   That is helping at least one stock sector: Home builders rose
Monday even as the broader market fell. Lennar gained $2.10 to $63.30
and KB Home added 99 cents to $52.50.</TE>

<HD>Some Say Stewart's Response Not a Good Thing</HD>
<DH>Probe: Domestic maven's defiant tone could backfire on Wall
Street and with her fans, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Her detractors say there are better cooks, more creative party
planners, greater gardeners and warmer hostesses. But what Martha
Stewart has on all of them is a formidable combination of talents: a
brilliant understanding of modern consumers and an almost
unparalleled ability to sell herself to them.</LD>
<LD>   But in what is shaping up to be the biggest crisis of her
career--allegations of insider stock trading and obstruction of
justice regarding her sale of ImClone Systems Inc. stock--the
domestic grande dame is decidedly off her game.</LD>
<LD>   In the past, Stewart has been able to deflect criticism and
unflattering portraits with an aggressive response or with humor.
When all else failed, she let the sheer volume of Martha Stewart TV
shows, magazines, books and products do the talking for her.</LD>
<TE>   This time around, however, Stewart has been defiant, defensive and
mostly unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   That strategy could backfire on someone as public as Stewart,
especially if the inquiry is prolonged and Stewart is seen by Wall
Street as distracted or by the public as having something to hide.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the consequences of being a product of the media [is that]
the media can be negative as well as positive, and it can be
difficult to manage," said David Stewart, a consumer psychologist and
professor of marketing at USC's Marshall School of Business. (He is
not related to Martha Stewart.)</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't just a gossip column item, this is national news, and
it's much more difficult to manage the spin on that."</TE>
<TE>   It is a level of scrutiny unfamiliar to Stewart, who is
battle-tested but more accustomed to fighting tell-all books and
media reports suggesting that her real-life behavior is not as
gracious as her public persona.</TE>
<TE>   In those cases--including allegations of bad blood with her
Connecticut neighbors and shabby treatment of previous business
partners--Stewart has jabbed back, rallying her many female fans with
the contention that she is more scrutinized and held to a different
standard than male business leaders, who are given credit for making
aggressive business moves and demanding quality work from employees.</TE>
<TE>   In response to caricatures depicting outlandishly difficult and
trivial craft projects, Stewart responded with an appearance in an
American Express commercial, in which she retiled a swimming pool
with cut-up pieces of old credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   But in the current crisis, Stewart is more hampered, business
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Part of her reticence to speak about the issue probably comes from
her lawyers, because most legal experts advise clients to avoid
commenting on pending investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding the problem, the allegations center on exactly those
parts of her life that Stewart downplays with fans of her domestic
skills--her financial acumen as a former stockbroker, the leader of a
public company and a board member of the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Still, say experts in crisis communications, Stewart could be
doing more to reassure the public about her integrity, especially at
a time of unprecedented scrutiny of business leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like a classic case of not believing it's as bad as it
is," said Dan McGinn of the McGinn Group, which handles crisis public
relations.</TE>
<TE>   "She needs much more open communication, a much more understanding
tone of why people are asking right now [and] a full engagement of
the issue."</TE>
<TE>   Since news of Stewart's ImClone stock sale broke last month, she
has issued one formal statement describing how she came to sell her
ImClone holdings and, during a few public appearances, reiterated
that she did nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   One of Stewart's few public comments about the ImClone scandal
came last week during her regular spot on CBS' "Early Show," when she
brushed off questions while vigorously chopping a cabbage, calling
the issue "ridiculousness."</TE>
<TE>   Since news of the investigation broke last month, shares in Martha
Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. have fallen by as much as half, though
they have recovered a bit. Shares rose 3 cents to $11.50 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Although the public has had little reaction to the news, investors
have worried about backlash as the scandal continues to swirl in
high-profile venues. Stewart appeared on the cover of Newsweek last
week under the title "Martha's Mess."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Wall Street has long worried what would happen to
Stewart's company--which is so tied up with the public image and name
of one person--when the day came when she was no longer able to run
it.</TE>
<TE>   But that concern usually involved Stewart's health, not her
glistening image, and the thought was that eventually the company
would use Stewart's image to move beyond Stewart herself. Some are
questioning that notion more now.</TE>
<TE>   "If she dies or can't run the company, you still have the name,
but in this case you could have a tarnished name," said Michael
Kamins, an associate professor of marketing at USC's business school
and an expert in celebrity marketing.</TE>
<TE>   "People are buying an image when they buy Martha Stewart products
or publications, a beautiful, light and airy image of good taste. It
sure is in bad taste if this is true."</TE>

<HD>Pension Funds Demand Wall Street Reforms</HD>
<DH>Funds: California, New York and North Carolina will require
investment banking firms to clean up conflicts of interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials in California, New York and North Carolina--with collective
oversight of $220 billion of public pension assets and other
funds--said Monday that Wall Street needs to clean up conflicts of
interest between research and investment banking units, or lose state
business.</LD>
<LD>   In the wake of Enron Corp.'s downfall and the collapse of WorldCom
Inc., state officials want to protect the retirement funds of their
residents. State pension funds lost more than $2 billion on
investments in WorldCom's stocks and bonds alone, with the California
Public Employees' Retirement System accounting for $565 million.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposal, investment banking firms that do business with
the three states will be asked to adopt rules that clearly separate
their research and investment banking divisions. The rules are
similar to those agreed on by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and New York Atty.
Gen. Eliot Spitzer. Critics say Wall Street firms often use favorable
analyst coverage to attract investment banking clients, tainting the
objectivity of the research.</LD>
<TE>   "Our message today is simple and clear: If you wish to do business
with our state, we expect you to adhere to the highest standards of
integrity and disclosure," California State Treasurer Phil Angelides
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   But Margaret Draper, a spokeswoman for the Securities Industry
Assn., a trade group representing investment banks, broker-dealers
and mutual fund companies, said the rules may "pose a problem because
states could be essentially superceding federal laws involving the
regulation of securities analysts."</TE>
<TE>   State officials said the effects of the new measures will trickle
down to individual investors because their pension funds invest in
many of the same mutual funds as small investors.</TE>
<TE>   For California, which expects to have sold more than $25 billion
of debt by the end of 2002, the broker-dealer rules are especially
important as it chooses debt underwriters.</TE>
<TE>   The three states also want investment companies that oversee
pension assets to clean up their act.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina Treasurer Richard Moore said he expects the banking
and investment community to adopt the rules within two to four
months.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of our managers are eager to satisfy us," Moore said, and
have said they will put the proposal in place.</TE>

<LD>Pfizer Inc., Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and other drug makers sued the U.S.
government to stop states from steering Medicaid patients toward
cheaper medicines.</LD>
<LD>   The drug makers and some patient advocates asked the U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia to halt programs in Michigan,
Florida, Louisiana and as many as nine other states. A Department of
Health and Human Services spokesman said Secretary Tommy Thompson
"strongly supports" state Medicaid initiatives.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Small tobacco companies that didn't sign onto a massive legal
settlement four years ago have filed a lawsuit challenging a
requirement by California, New York and 29 other states that they
contribute to a reserve fund for states to tap if they successfully
sue the companies.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed in federal court in New York, claims that
identical laws in the states require the companies to comply with the
1998 settlement with major tobacco companies, or pay about $3 a
carton into the fund.</LD>
<LD>   The plaintiffs, including Nationwide Tobacco Inc. and Sun Tobacco
Inc., say that after agreeing to settle the 1998 suit for $206
billion, the major tobacco makers feared they'd lose sales to the
smaller competitors and pushed the states to pass the laws.</LD>
<TE>   Representatives for the New York and California attorneys general
said they hadn't seen the suit and couldn't comment on it.</TE>

completing two Massachusetts power plants it guaranteed will cost as

<LD>   Washington Group stopped work on the plants and then filed for
bankruptcy projection in May 2001, accusing Raytheon of hiding cost
overruns. Raytheon has raised its cost estimate three times since it

<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp., the world's largest auto maker, plans to resume
the no-interest loans that helped lift sales last year, dealers said.</LD>
<LD>   GM is expected to announce the move today as it releases U.S.
sales figures for June along with other auto makers. Ford Motor Co.
will offer zero-percent financing for three models and a choice of
interest as low as 0.9% or cash rebates of as much as $3,000 on other
cars and trucks, a spokeswoman said.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts expect GM to report a 3.7% jump in sales for the month
and a gain in market share from Big Three rivals Ford and
DaimlerChrysler.</LD>
<TE>   Industrywide, sales rebounded in June from May to an annualized
pace of 16.8 million, little-changed from the year-earlier month,
according to a survey of four analysts.</TE>
<TE>   A GM spokesman declined to comment other than to say that the auto
maker would change its incentives. GM gained U.S. market share last
year for the first time in 10 years.</TE>

<LD>* Network Associates Inc. said it would offer $164.9 million in stock
for the rest of McAfee.com Corp., reinstating a bid that was twice
halted amid a probe of the anti-virus software maker's accounting.
Network Associates, which owns 75% of McAfee.com, will exchange 0.78
share of its stock for each McAfee.com Class A common share, the same
terms as its April 10 offer. It values McAfee.com at $13.74 a share,
6.1% less than Friday's closing price. Network Associates fell $1.65
to $17.62 on the NYSE, and McAfee.com fell $1.04 to $13.60 on Nasdaq.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The two business parks developed on the site of the former Hughes
Aircraft Co. research plant in the west San Fernando Valley now are
unified under the ownership of Multi-Employer Property Trust.</LD>
<LD>   The trust bought West Hills Corporate Village in a $90-million
transaction. It already owned adjacent Corporate Pointe at West
Hills. The seller was Burbank-based Shamrock Holdings.</LD>
<LD>   West Hills Corporate Village has 565,000 square feet of offices
and is 98% leased to such tenants as Countrywide Home Loans Inc.,
Xerox Corp., Boeing Co., IBM Corp., Computer Associates and Pitney
Bowes Inc.</LD>
<TE>   The two 30-acre properties are tucked into the Santa Susana
Mountains just south of the Chatsworth Lake reservoir, where Hughes
engineers once developed military missiles. Private technical school
DeVry University also owns and operates a campus on a portion of the
former Hughes complex.</TE>
<TE>   A little more than half of the 300,000 square feet at Corporate
Pointe is vacant, but real estate sources said the landlord is
negotiating with Tarzana-based laboratory services specialist Unilab
Corp. to lease most of the empty space, much of which was the former
headquarters of Coast Federal Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Stirling, senior vice president with the trust's
investment advisor, Kennedy Associates Real Estate Counsel,
acknowledged that a lease covering "most of the remaining available
space" is nearly final. A spokesman for Unilab, which has agreed to
merge with New Jersey-based Quest Diagnostics Inc., declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle-based Kennedy Associates oversees real estate investment
activities for the $3-billion Multi-Employer Property Trust, whose
primary beneficiaries are union pension funds.</TE>
<TE>   The West Valley's overall office vacancy rate, including sublease
availabilities, was just under 15% at the end of March, according to
brokerage Colliers Seeley. Rents have fallen slightly from the peaks
reached a year or two ago.</TE>

<HD>Sony Sees Profit in 1st Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sony Corp., in a reversal, said it probably earned a profit in its
fiscal first quarter, bolstered by its record-setting "Spider-Man"
movie.</LD>
<LD>   Earnings at Sony's entertainment units are helping counter losses
elsewhere at the world's second-largest maker of consumer
electronics, investors said. Sony, which said in April that it
expected an operating loss in the period, didn't elaborate on a
statement on expectations for a fiscal first-quarter group operating
profit.</LD>
<LD>   "We didn't think Sony's movie business would turn out such
profits," said Kiyohide Nagata of Prudential Asset Management Japan
Inc. "Its movies are helping the company hedge business risk."</LD>
<TE>   Sony, whose shares lost a quarter of their value in the last year,
faces slowing demand for hard disk drives, chips and tube monitors.
Its shares fell 2.8% in Japan and dropped about 2% in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The company made its announcement after a report in the Nihon
Kezai newspaper Saturday that the firm probably had a group operating
loss of $41.7 million in the quarter because of slowing sales of its
Vaio personal computers and other consumer electronics, which account
for 70% of sales.</TE>
<TE>   Sony had an operating profit--the amount left over after sales and
administrative costs are subtracted from revenue--of $25 million in
the year-ago period.</TE>
<TE>   First-quarter earnings were led by Sony's movie business, which
released films such as "Spider-Man" and "Panic Room," the company
said. Since May, "Spider-Man" grossed almost $400 million in North
America. Sony's Columbia Pictures also is behind "Mr. Deeds," the
highest-grossing film at the box office this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   In the year ended March, Sony's movie business generated about a
quarter of its operating profit of $1.2 billion.</TE>

<HD>Sunset Rising in Hollywood</HD>
<DH>Latest real estate project includes retail, loft space amid
bright lights</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER VINCENT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Construction begins today on another high-profile real estate project
in Hollywood, a $125-million shopping center and luxury apartment
complex at one of Los Angeles' best-known intersections.</LD>
<LD>   The long-anticipated project on the northwest block of Sunset
Boulevard and Vine Street will boast a massive electronic billboard,
a surrounding frieze of advertising signs and a projector that will
flash images of faces. A brace of Klieg lights, which should be
visible for miles, will sit atop the 120-foot centerpiece.</LD>
<LD>   Named Sunset &amp; Vine, the project probably will be the largest
multifamily residential development in Hollywood in the last 50
years, said one of the builders, Larry Bond of Bond Capital Ltd.</LD>
<TE>   It will include 300 units of loft-style apartments designed to
appeal to entertainment industry "echo boomers" ages 25 to 40. The
entrance to the apartments will be through the Art Deco facade of the
former TAV Studios, which housed the Merv Griffin Theater and ABC
Radio when it was built in 1938.</TE>
<TE>   The site at the eastern edge of Hollywood's Walk of Fame also was
once home to Capitol Records, the Spanish Ballroom and the Copacabana
Club. Businesses that have agreed to move to the new development are
Borders Books &amp; Music and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. The 90,000 square feet
of retail space will include restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Bond Capital's financial partners are the California State
Teachers' Retirement System pension fund and Canyon-Johnson Urban
Fund, a partnership of Beverly Hills-based Canyon Capital Realty
Advisors and former Los Angeles Laker star Earvin "Magic" Johnson's
Johnson Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Hollywood office market has been soft for several
months and the massive Hollywood &amp; Highland shopping and
entertainment center that opened in November has not performed to
expectation, several smaller retail projects are in various stages of
development, and apartments are in short supply. Market observers
predict the fledgling economic renaissance in Hollywood will
continue, though at a slower pace than expected before the economy
slowed last year.</TE>
<TE>   "In Hollywood, they want to be a little cooler now," Johnson said.
"For us to be a part of that is wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood project is part of an effort at Canyon-Johnson to
move its investments beyond the inner city into other promising urban
locations, said co-managing partner Ken Lombard. The company has
amassed a $200-million fund to develop urban "infill" projects, which
involve reclaiming underused space in long-established neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Many institutional investors still consider ethnically diverse,
densely populated urban areas such as Hollywood an investment risk,
even though the demand for services is often greater than the supply,
said Bobby Turner, the other co-managing partner of Canyon-Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thesis of our funds is that the [real estate]
fundamentals are hugely favorable. Sunset &amp; Vine is the poster
child," Turner said.</TE>
<TE>   It's also the first major mixed-use project in Hollywood's
commercial core to have a significant residential component, said
Jeffrey Skorneck, project manager for the Community Redevelopment
Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe it will be a catalyst for more of its sort," he said.
The project is in a CRA zone, and portions of its property tax
payments will be used for improvements in the area.</TE>
<TE>   The substantial presence of advertising at one of the most heavily
traveled intersections in Los Angeles will contribute to the
developers' bottom line, Skorneck said, but it has been designed to
enhance the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Other recent or planned projects in the neighborhood include the
ArcLight Hollywood theaters at the Cinerama Dome and Capitol Records'
expansion of its campus on Vine Street. A hotel and residential
project at the Hollywood and Vine subway station has been approved by
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</TE>
<TE>   The retail portion of Sunset &amp; Vine should be completed by the end
of 2003, and the apartments are expected to be ready the following
spring.</TE>
<TE>   The executive architect is Gruen Associates. Charles Pankow is the
general contractor.</TE>

<HD>Blunder Raises France Telecom Shares</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A gaffe by France's new government yanked France Telecom shares up
25%, as the Finance Ministry said it could buy out the firm to rescue
it from a relentless market beating--and then backtracked.</LD>
<LD>   In what appeared to be a clumsy communications blunder, a Finance
Ministry spokeswoman initially said France would consider
renationalizing the 55.5% state-owned group if there was no end to
the confidence crisis that has wiped 96% off its value in two years.</LD>
<LD>   Shortly afterward, a spokesman at the same ministry said the
comments were wrong and based on a misunderstanding, and said the
month-old government had no plans, for the time being, to buy out
minority shareholders in France Telecom.</LD>
<TE>   It was unclear whether the gaffe was a mistake by a new press team
or a leak to test market reaction, lift the flailing shares and hurt
some of the short-selling hedge funds that have driven the stock down
recently. But analysts welcomed signs that France Telecom's main
shareholder might at last take action.</TE>
<TE>   France Telecom shares, crushed by worries over the group's
61-billion euro debt, were repeatedly halted while attempting to leap
as much as 27% as investors puzzled over the mix-up. The stock was
frozen for two hours at midday but surged in late trading to close up
25.3%.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for France Telecom declined to comment on the issue
and reiterated that the firm was in no need of a cash injection or
rescue plan.</TE>

<HD>IBM Competition May Hurt Compuware</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Compuware Corp. shares plunged 26% after a Morgan Stanley analyst
said growth at the mainframe software maker may be stymied by
competition from IBM Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Analyst Joseph Farley wrote that Compuware's revenue may be less
than expected as the maker of mainframe computer software cuts prices
to fend off competition from IBM, the world's largest seller of
computer services and the second-largest maker of software. IBM
offers low-priced or free alternatives to many Compuware products and
has improved quality so there's little difference, Farley said.</LD>
<LD>   Compuware, based in Farmington Hills, Mich., makes software that
works with the mainframe computers that IBM sells. In the year ended
March 31, Compuware got 81% of its $851.4 million in software and
maintenance sales, or $687.3 million, from mainframe products.</LD>
<TE>   Its shares fell $1.57 to $4.50 on Nasdaq after dropping to a
52-week low of $4.18.</TE>

<HD>THQ Shutting Joint Venture That Sold Online Soccer Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Video game maker THQ Inc. said it was shutting down a venture that
sold an online soccer game in Britain, a step that will crimp
second-quarter profit.</LD>
<LD>   The game, which put players in the role of managers rather than
athletes, didn't attract enough consumers who were willing to pay the
monthly fee, THQ said. The experience mirrors that of Electronic Arts
Inc., the biggest video game maker, which has yet to make a profit
from its online games unit.</LD>
<LD>   THQ's net income will be reduced by $2.8 million, or 7 cents a
share, to about 10 to 12 cents, in the quarter because of costs to
close Network Interactive Sports Ltd., a venture started with HotGen
Studios a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   "The reality is that people just weren't willing to take out their
credit cards and pay for this over the Internet," said Tim Walsh,
vice president of THQ's international operations. "The subscription
model just didn't pan out."</TE>
<TE>   Other companies are betting it will. Microsoft Corp. is starting a
fee-based service called Xbox Live that will allow customers to play
online. Sony Corp. has a similar service for its PlayStation 2.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Calabasas-based THQ fell as much as 16% to $23.07 in
after-hours trading after the announcement, later rebounding to
$26.01. The shares had closed off $2.50 at $27.32 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Tyco Raises $4.6 Billion in IPO</HD>
<DH>Conglomerates: Firm settles for half of what it paid for
its CIT Group, but it will be able to make debt payments. Shares rise
on the news.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd., in a bid to ease its heavy debt load, raised
$4.6 billion on Monday in an initial public stock offering of its CIT
Group, settling for half of what it paid for the finance company a
year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco sold 200 million shares for $23 each, below the expected
range of $25 to $29, according to a banker involved with the sale.
The sale was a reality check on the company's valuations, raising
$400 million less than the low end of the range recently expected by
CIT.</LD>
<LD>   "It's really disappointing," said Brian Bruce, a money manager at
Boston's PanAgora Asset Management Inc. "How can it be worth what it
was and then be turned around for a fraction?"</LD>
<TE>   Considering Tyco's need for cash, the sale is better than no sale
at all, investors said. Tyco's stock moved up 2% to $14 in
after-hours trading on news the company will be able to meet upcoming
debt payments. The shares closed at $13.75, up 24 cents, on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   CIT shares will begin trading today on the NYSE under the ticker
symbol CIT.</TE>
<TE>   Even at the lower price, the CIT offering was the fourth-largest
IPO in the U.S., according to Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Initial stock offerings have been hampered by the weak stock
market, especially in recent months as corporate accounting scandals
have disillusioned investors.</TE>
<TE>   CIT, which provides corporate and consumer financing services,
also had to deal with the shadow cast by management scandals at its
parent.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other IPO candidates that have been able to delay their
sales, Tyco needed to sell CIT to help pay $7.7 billion of debt
coming due within the next year and a half.</TE>
<TE>   The offer price has been reduced on another high-profile
IPO--Merck &amp; Co.'s $1-billion sale of its pharmacy benefits manager,
Medco Health Solutions--and on Monday that sale was postponed for a
second time. Merck, a member of the Dow industrials, fell $1.89 to
$48.75 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco had promised investors it would sell CIT promptly to reduce
its $27-billion debt burden. Until last month, Tyco valued CIT at
more than $11 billion on its books, more than double what the market
was willing to pay.</TE>
<TE>   The concern now is that Tyco's other businesses could be subject
to big-ticket write-downs, which could bring the company closer to
exceeding a maximum 52.5% debt-to-capital ratio it had stipulated
with lenders.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the SEC forced Tyco to cut its $11.3-billion carrying
value of CIT to $6.5 billion to reflect "goodwill" impairment. Tyco
will have to reduce CIT's valuation by about $1.9 billion more to
reflect Monday's IPO pricing.</TE>
<TE>   The CIT sale attracted some holders of Tyco stock, who have a
vested interest in seeing CIT sold successfully, said people familiar
with the sale.</TE>

<HD>Fate of Universal Suddenly Uncertain</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: With ouster of parent firm's chief, some
wonder if it's in for more turmoil.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the imminent departure of Vivendi Universal's chairman,
Jean-Marie Messier, the big question in Hollywood is what becomes of
the U.S. entertainment holdings bought by the French water giant
during the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   The answer: They could be put up for sale or spun off, creating
even more anxiety for entertainment divisions that have been riven by
turmoil for nearly a decade because of management upheaval under
three separate owners.</LD>
<LD>   Messier's resignation after a rocky two years was cheered by some
within Universal's ranks. "We're thrilled," said a top executive.
"Nothing could be worse than having someone who Wall Street and the
markets have no faith in."</LD>
<TE>   But the uncertainty could in fact get worse.</TE>
<TE>   For months, speculation has circulated on Wall Street that Vivendi
would be forced to spin off entertainment assets to reduce its
$30-billion debt and reverse its stock free fall. Those assets
include Universal Music, the world's largest recording company, and
Vivendi Universal Entertainment, the movie, television and theme-park
group run by media mogul Barry Diller.</TE>
<TE>   Under one scenario, Diller would buy these entertainment assets,
despite his well-known contempt for the poor economics of the movie
business. The rest of the company's vast holdings would remain under
French control.</TE>
<TE>   As money manager Mario Gabelli of Gabelli Group put it: "Render
unto Hollywood the things that are Hollywood's and unto France the
things that are French."</TE>
<TE>   Under Gabelli's solution, embraced by many on Wall Street, Vivendi
would keep the French water company, called Vivendi Environnement, as
well as its wireless holdings and Canal Plus, Europe's largest
pay-television provider.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. entertainment assets would be turned into a new company
headed by Diller and controlled by Vivendi's current shareholders. Or
the assets would be sold to the highest bidder for a price analysts
estimate at more than $20 billion. One obstacle to any sale or
spinoff, Gabelli said, is how Vivendi would divide its huge debt
among its subsidiaries.</TE>
<TE>   Although Diller declined to comment on his plans Monday, Gabelli
speculated that the entertainment executive has positioned himself to
assume control of the entertainment assets. Just months ago, Vivendi
paid $10 billion for the television properties of Diller's USA
Networks Inc., including its cable channels--USA Network and the
Sci-Fi Channel. Diller retained control of the now renamed USA
Interactive Inc., primarily an Internet company.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the deal, Diller agreed to help Messier by heading up
the newly created Vivendi Universal Entertainment company. Despite
speculation that Diller was interested only in broadening his
Internet empire, sources within the company say he has taken his new
job seriously. Sources say Diller's top executives have been visiting
bond-rating agencies to discuss the possibility of Vivendi Universal
Entertainment's becoming a stand-alone public company.</TE>
<TE>   Still, executives close to Diller say his company, USA
Interactive, will not participate in any potential purchase of
Vivendi's entertainment group. Sources also say that Diller has no
interest in Vivendi's music business, which is plagued by surging
piracy, rising costs, shrinking profit and rebellion in its artist
ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond Diller, analysts are hard pressed to name other potential
suitors.</TE>
<TE>   Most media stocks have taken a beating in the current market and
therefore are not well-positioned for a $20-billion acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, few have major holes in their corporate portfolios
after a decade-long wave of consolidations. Viacom Inc. is the
fittest of the top five media conglomerates, the others being AOL
Time Warner Inc., Vivendi, Walt Disney Co. and News Corp. But the
company has little interest in assets other than cable channels or TV
stations.</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks SKG, the upstart studio owned by Steven Spielberg,
David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg, could use Universal's size to
compete against the entertainment company giants. But the deal is too
big for the privately held company to pull off.</TE>
<TE>   Universal would give NBC the movie and TV production assets it
lacks. But NBC, the only television network not paired up with a
Hollywood studio, has insisted that movie making is an unnecessary
risk and has managed to maintain its lead in the ratings without
being part of the "vertical integration" trend followed by others.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann, the privately held German media giant, has the size
to pull off such an acquisition. A major force in television in
Europe, the company has been eager to expand in music and enter the
U.S. television business. But with Universal, Bertelsmann could run
into the same antitrust hurdles that prevented its acquisition of
music giant EMI Group.</TE>

<TE>Revolving Door</TE>
<TE>Universal Studios has had four owners in the last 12 years. The
entertainment conglomerate may see another change in the executive
suite with the apparent resignation of Vivendi Universal Chief
Executive Jean-Marie Messier.</TE>
<TE>A chronology of key management changes at Universal Studios:</TE>
<TE>1959: Entertainment mogul Lew Wasserman's MCA buys Universal
Pictures' studio lot in North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>1962: MCA buys Universal Studios and its parent company, Decca
Records. MCA says it will liquidate its talent agency and concentrate
on film production.</TE>
<TE>1990: MCA agrees to be purchased by Japanese electronics conglomerate
Matsushita Electric Industrial for    $6.6 billion--the largest
purchase of an American firm by a Japanese company. Matsushita
President Akio Tanii envisions meshing his firm's consumer
electronics business with the "software'' of Hollywood entertainment.
There are complaints about the deal, however, because some see it as
a sellout of American culture. In the coming years, Wasserman is
frustrated by his Japanese bosses, who spurn his efforts to expand
MCA through deals such as acquiring CBS.</TE>
<TE>1995: Canadian liquor giant Seagram buys 80% of MCA for $5.7 billion.
Seagram's foray into entertainment is led by beverage heir Edgar
Bronfman Jr. The company later is renamed Universal Studios.</TE>
<TE>2000: French water utility company Vivendi agrees to buy Seagram,
which includes Universal Studios and Universal Music Group, in a
$34-billion stock swap. Vivendi Chairman Jean-Marie Messier envisions
an international entertainment conglomerate to compete with AOL Time
Warner, News Corp., Viacom and others.</TE>
<TE>2001: Vivendi agrees to purchase the film and television businesses
of Barry Diller's USA Networks for $11 billion.</TE>
<TE>2002: Five Vivendi Universal board members resign over Messier's
strategy. The company is sagging under $30 billion in debt and a
slumping stock price. Some reports name French pharmaceutical
executive Jean-Rene Fourtou as interim Vivendi CEO.</TE>

<HD>Warner Music to Move to Burbank's Pinnacle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON and CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warner Music Group has agreed to become the lead tenant at Burbank's
newest office complex in one of the biggest leases of the year in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   The multi-label recording group, whose artists include Madonna and
the Hives, will consolidate several offices at the Pinnacle, a
six-story development along the Ventura Freeway at West Olive Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   The deal valued at an estimated $120 million is thought to be the
biggest office lease in the Southland in 2002 and may hold that
distinction through what has so far been a fairly slow year for
landlords.</LD>
<TE>   Warner Music is the first large office tenant to agree to move
into the first phase of the Pinnacle, just completed by Santa
Monica-based M. David Paul Development.</TE>
<TE>   The 17-year lease will fill 195,000 square feet of customized
offices--about half of the $80-million complex's leasable space, said
Jeff Worthe, a principal of M. David Paul.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Music Group is media giant AOL Time Warner Inc.'s
reorganized record division, consisting of Warner Bros. Records,
Elektra Entertainment and Atlantic Records.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Music Group Chairman Roger Ames will remain based in AOL
Time Warner's New York headquarters. Elektra Entertainment and
Atlantic Records also will stay based in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The company's flagship label, Warner Bros. Records, run by
industry veteran Tom Whalley, will remain in its well-known
headquarters adjacent to the Warner film studio--where it opened its
doors nearly 30 years ago. Warner/Chappell, the company's music
publishing arm, also will remain in its headquarters on Santa Monica
Boulevard in West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The following Warner companies will relocate to the Pinnacle:</TE>
<TE>   * WEA Corp., the company's manufacturing and distribution arm.</TE>
<TE>   * Warner Strategic Marketing, the company's catalog sector, which
includes Rhino.</TE>
<TE>   * Warner Music Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   * West Coast offices of Atlantic Records, home to Kid Rock and
Jewel, and Elektra Entertainment, home to Missy Elliot and Metallica.</TE>
<TE>   "The relocation efforts in Burbank will result in substantial cost
savings, money that will we will use for what we to best:
discovering, nurturing and marketing artists," a Warner Music Group
representative said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   NBC Enterprises also agreed to a 12-year lease of 18,000 square
feet at the Pinnacle. Restaurants Arnie Morton's Steak House and
Prego are committed.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Music is scheduled to begin moving in November, when the
restaurants are slated to open. NBC may begin its move a few months
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Brokers Jim Travers and George Katunich of Travers Realty
represented Warner in the deal along with Warner Music Vice President
Blake Messinger.</TE>
<TE>   Potential tenants for the balance of the space in the first phase
are in discussions with the landlord, said Carl Muhlstein of Cushman
&amp; Wakefield, Pinnacle's primary leasing agent. Discussions also are
underway with tenants for the project's planned 235,000-square-foot
second phase.</TE>
<TE>   Muhlstein wouldn't identify prospective tenants, but said that
financial services businesses now supplement the Burbank Media
District's entertainment roster.</TE>
<TE>   The Pinnacle's developer faces an unusually high level of
competition for tenants in and around Burbank. The office vacancy
rate there fell to negligible levels during the late 1990s, pushing
many potential tenants to North Hollywood and Glendale. Burbank
vacancy subsequently rose as demand slowed and office construction
surged.</TE>
<TE>   More than 25% of Burbank's 6.54 million square feet of offices are
vacant, according to mid-year data from brokerage Insignia/ESG.</TE>
<TE>   Although Pinnacle and other new buildings have continued to
supplement the city's inventory, the amount of space occupied by
tenants has shrunk by more than 150,000 square feet over the last
year, Insignia/ESG said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Burbank landlords are seeing more leasing activity than
neighboring sub-markets are, said office broker Bill Boyd of Grubb &amp;
Ellis.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros. Records opened on March 19, 1958, above the film
studio's machine shop on Warner Boulevard in Burbank. Warner Bros.
Records moved into its current headquarters at 3300 Warner Blvd. in
1975.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AOL Time Warner fell $1.20 Monday to $13.51 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Trading Resumes; Shares Sink 93%</HD>
<DH>Markets: Volume in the company's shares set a record at 1.5
billion. But buyers' motives baffled some analysts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trading in WorldCom Inc.'s shares resumed Monday and set a volume
record--as they lost nearly all of their value.</LD>
<LD>   It was obvious why investors would be selling WorldCom stock,
analysts said, but the motivation of many of the buyers baffled some
veteran traders: WorldCom is widely expected to file for bankruptcy
protection, and many Wall Street pros believe the stock will wind up
worthless.</LD>
<LD>   Volume in WorldCom reached 1.5 billion shares on Nasdaq on Monday,
as trading reopened after a three-session halt. That far surpassed
the previous record for a U.S. stock, which also was held by
WorldCom, when more than 670 million of its shares traded May 14.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom's stock plummeted from its closing price of 83 cents on
June 25 to end Monday at 6 cents, a drop of nearly 93%.</TE>
<TE>   The company's MCI tracking shares also resumed trading, and also
collapsed: MCI fell $1.44 to 24 cents on Nasdaq, as 27.5 million
shares changed hands.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said WorldCom's massive trading volume reflected the huge
number of shares outstanding, which was nearly 3 billion shares as of
April 30, according to Bloomberg News data.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the buying Monday was done by "short sellers" who
previously had borrowed WorldCom stock and sold it, betting the price
would drop. Short traders must close out their bets by repurchasing

<TE>   But the huge volume suggested that many speculators were stepping
in to buy the shares, perhaps hoping to sell them for even a penny
more per share in the next few days or weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Even in cases of stocks that are expected to ultimately be
worthless, it isn't unusual for the shares to continue to trade at
some value indefinitely.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Pins Fault for Errors on Ex-CFO</HD>
<DH>Telecom: SEC calls the firm's report 'wholly inadequate and
incomplete.' White House may suspend the company's government
contracts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM and JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As WorldCom Inc. acknowledged that its financial woes could go deeper
than previously disclosed, the company in a report made public Monday
attempted to blame its bookkeeping lapses squarely on former Chief
Financial Officer Scott D. Sullivan.</LD>
<LD>   In the report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
last week accused WorldCom of civil fraud for allegedly hiding $3.9
billion in expenses, WorldCom said its own auditors discovered the
irregularities in May and fired Sullivan on June 25 after conducting
an internal audit.</LD>
<LD>   Sullivan declined through his attorney to comment.</LD>
<TE>   The report failed to satisfy the SEC, which blasted the report as
a chronology rather than the explanation the agency had ordered.</TE>
<TE>   "WorldCom's statement is wholly inadequate and incomplete," SEC
Chairman Harvey L. Pitt said. "It demonstrates a lack of commitment
to full disclosure to investors and less than full cooperation with
the SEC."</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom executives said they were "very surprised" by Pitt's
comments.</TE>
<TE>   "Our response was entirely in line with the SEC's request and is
in fact a summary of what we know at this point," WorldCom spokesman
Brad Burns said.</TE>
<TE>   The company has hired Bill McLucas, former director of enforcement
at the SEC, to "get a full account of who knew what when, and what
led us to this point," Burns said. McLucas is due to report his
findings within three months, and the results of his investigation
are expected to be turned over to the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's SEC statement focused blame on former CFO Sullivan and
its former controller, David F. Myers, who resigned the same day
Sullivan was fired.</TE>
<TE>   "The clear import of the statement is to point at people who have
been terminated or left the company," said Jacob S. Frenkel, a
Washington lawyer and former SEC enforcement officer.</TE>
<TE>   Although the SEC complaint filed last week does not name specific
individuals, it does include "senior management" of the company
during 2001 and the first quarter of 2002. If so, the case also could
enmesh Bernard J. Ebbers, the former WorldCom chief executive who was
ousted in April.</TE>
<TE>   According to the company's statement, current CEO John W. Sidgmore
was not told of the irregularities until June 20, weeks after they
were discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Monday, the Bush administration said it may suspend
hundreds of millions of dollars in government contracts awarded to
WorldCom if it determines that the phone giant no longer meets
federal ethics standards.</TE>
<TE>   The review, similar to one the federal government conducted in the
wake of the Enron Corp. financial scandal, would affect the Internet
and long-distance phone service WorldCom provides to more than 60
federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, politicians and groups that received campaign
donations from WorldCom rushed to distance themselves from the
company. The National Republican Senatorial Committee said it was
returning a $100,000 contribution from the company. The Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee plans to donate to an unspecified
charity $50,750 it received from WorldCom during the last five
quarters, when the accounting irregularities occurred. And Rep.
Ronnie Shows (D-Miss.), in whose district the company is based, plans
to give $6,000 in company donations to a relief fund for laid-off
WorldCom workers.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush pledged to hold corporate wrongdoers accountable
and "bring some of these folks to justice."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, bad financial news for the once-highflying
telecommunications company continued to roll in. The company, which
earlier confined the accounting irregularities to 2001 and the first
quarter of 2002, said it would expand its internal audit of financial
statements to as far back as 1999, raising the possibility that the
company's accounting problems are deeper than initially revealed.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, the first revelation is not the last," said Richard
Breeden, former SEC chairman and a corporate turnaround specialist
based in Greenwich, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's stock also is likely to be delisted from the Nasdaq
Stock Market on Friday, the company said. Its shares plummeted
Monday, the first day the stock traded on the market after its
$3.9-billion restatement last week, losing 77 cents to close at 6
cents.</TE>
<TE>   As the possibility of bankruptcy loomed, WorldCom lenders declared
the company in default for loans totaling $2.65 billion. The move is
typical among lenders that expect a client to seek Bankruptcy Court
protection and who wish to preserve the option of immediately
collecting the entire loan, said bankruptcy attorney Richard Levin at
Skadden, Arps, Slate Meagher &amp; Flom in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom has $29 billion in long-term debt and $2.65 billion in
short-term debt. WorldCom doesn't have any payments due on its debt
until January, company executives said.</TE>
<TE>   The situation, however, would change dramatically if the lenders
demand early repayment of the $2.65 billion now in default.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's prospect for finding new lenders faded to nil when
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., a leading credit-rating company, downgraded
WorldCom's long-term debt rating Monday for the second time in two
business days. The new ranking is CC, the second-lowest mark for debt
not yet in default.</TE>

<HD>Board Drafts New Guidelines for SPEs</HD>
<DH>Reforms: Proposed rule changes regarding special-purpose
entities are aimed at improving financial reporting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Dow Jones/Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting
standards for U.S. companies, on Monday released a draft of new rules
for so-called special-purpose entities, or SPEs.</LD>
<LD>   How companies account for SPEs has come under scrutiny since the
collapse of energy trader Enron Corp., which hid billions of dollars
of debt in off-balance-sheet partnerships.</LD>
<LD>   The accounting board said the objective of the proposed rules is
to improve financial reporting by companies that use SPEs, not to
restrict the use of SPEs. It is expected that if the proposal is
implemented, more SPEs will be listed on corporate balance sheets
than in the past.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed new rules require that outside investors own at least
10% of an SPE before a company can keep the entity off its balance
sheet. Current rules require outside investors to own 3%.</TE>
<TE>   The hardest hit by the new guidelines would be SPEs set up for
equipment and real estate leasing--which could put billions of
dollars of assets and liabilities on the books of capital- and
land-intensive industries such as auto and energy companies, said
Robert Willens, an analyst at Lehman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Special-purpose entities came into the spotlight late last year as
investors grappled with the billions in debt Enron managed to keep
off its balance sheet through sophisticated partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting board is seeking public comment on its proposal
through Aug. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Any changes finally adopted would be effective immediately for new
SPEs. Companies that already have SPEs would be required to apply the
rules at the beginning of the first fiscal period after March 15.
Calendar year-end companies would need to apply the guidance on April
1.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares in the Nasdaq Stock Market didn't get much of a reception
Monday on their first day of unofficial trading in public markets.</LD>
<LD>   Nasdaq opened and closed at $15 on the over-the-counter Bulletin
Board. Volume reached 1,300 shares, a sliver of the 34 million shares
eligible for trading.</LD>
<LD>   Monday marked the first day that investors who acquired shares of
Nasdaq in two private placements, in 2000 and 2001, were allowed to
sell a portion of those shares.</LD>
<TE>   Nasdaq, which has been considering an initial public offering, has
postponed those plans because of market conditions. In the meantime
it has discouraged its private-placement investors from selling.</TE>
<TE>   But some opted to do so anyway Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "Nasdaq does not intend to participate in, or encourage, these
Bulletin Board activities," Chairman Hardwick Simmons said in a
letter to shareholders in June. "It is not clear that a market will
develop for our common stock."</TE>
<TE>   The shares are trading under the symbol NDAQ.</TE>

<HD>Subsidiary Paid Indian Officials, Xerox Reports</HD>
<DH>Disclosure: $600,000 to $700,000 was given to win
government orders in 2000. Two other overseas units face unrelated
legal or tax problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Xerox Corp., whose accounting is under U.S. regulatory investigation,
said that its Indian subsidiary made "improper payments" to
government officials and that two other overseas operations face
legal or tax problems.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest copier manufacturer said a majority-owned
subsidiary in India, Xerox Modicorp Ltd., paid $600,000 to $700,000
during 2000 to win government orders. Xerox also said some
transactions by a South African affiliate may have been improperly
recorded, and Brazil has assessed Xerox about $380 million in taxes
mostly for internal transfers of inventory.</LD>
<LD>   The Stamford, Conn.-based company made the disclosures in a
delayed annual report, filed Friday, which also restated equipment
sales from 1997 to 2001 by $6.4 billion, more than twice as much as
the company acknowledged in April.</LD>
<TE>   Xerox's report of the Indian payments and the two other
international concerns represent separate issues.</TE>
<TE>   "When our new management team was installed in India, we
discovered there had been payments to certain government officials to
facilitate equipment sales," said Xerox spokesman Dan Minchen. "Our
management team immediately ordered a halt to any such payment to
government [officials] or anyone else in exchange for favorability of
sales."</TE>
<TE>   Under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. companies and
executives are prohibited from bribing foreign officials. At the same
time, the law allows small payments that are necessary to do business
in other countries. Xerox officials said the payments in India on an
individual basis totaled $100 to $200.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox said it has discussed the payments with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which has sued companies if they failed to
disclose bribes in their financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt said Sunday that Xerox, its officers,
directors and accountants are still under investigation for inflating
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   India has set up a Central Vigilance Commission to combat
corruption. Referring to the reported payments by the Xerox
subsidiary, S.N.P.N. Sinha, secretary of the vigilance commission,
said the panel will "look into this."</TE>
<TE>   The Indian subsidiary, based in New Delhi, had been making the
payments for a number of years, said Paul Arrowsmith, Xerox's
spokesman for developing markets, including India, the Middle East,
Africa and Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox discovered the payments in October 2000 and ordered a
special audit that was completed last year, along with a legal review
that the company received this year.</TE>
<TE>   Arrowsmith said the payments "also involved errors in Xerox
[Modicorp]'s books," which are now being audited by Deloitte, Haskins
&amp; Sells, an associate of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.</TE>
<TE>   He said Xerox also plans to notify the Justice Department and the
Indian government about the payments.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox shares, which have fallen 34% this year, dropped 12 cents to
$6.85 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Prison Bans Inmate Smoking</HD>
<DH>Tobacco: Prohibition at facility in San Luis Obispo
disrupts a system of barter behind bars. Some predict a black market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>In the convict lexicon, cigarettes have always been "coin"--the
behind-bars currency that can buy inmates everything from toothpaste
to toilet paper. Now a pack of prison smokes seems destined to become
something else: contraband.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo became
the second state prison since May to order all inmates to kick their
cigarette habits cold turkey. That means no smoking in cells, public
buildings or even the exercise yard.</LD>
<LD>   Citing rising health-care costs, a national vilification of
smokers and inmates' complaints about secondhand fumes, prison
officials have joined a nationwide trend toward cigarette
prohibitions.</LD>
<TE>   Seventeen states have snuffed out tobacco use in prisons. Another
31 states, including California, and the federal government have
partial bans that include most public buildings on prison grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Similar bans have resulted in unrest and unforeseen complications
at several prisons--including one in California where protesting
prisoners refused to leave their cells.</TE>
<TE>   In a prison culture where about 75% of inmates smoke--where
cigarettes calm tightly strung nerves--the ban will force Men's
Colony officials onto untested ground.</TE>
<TE>   "Many inmates have smoked since they were teens," said Lt. Larry
Vizard. "Now that release won't be there. We don't know how they'll
adjust."</TE>
<TE>   But states with total smoking bans know: Cagey convicts will go
into business as tobacco quickly becomes a hot commodity on the
prison black market--sometimes selling for $60 a smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Inmates have run lucrative schemes--sometimes involving prison
personnel--to smuggle tobacco, officials say. In some states, the
bans have brought new assaults involving cranky convicts going
through withdrawal and others attacked for their inability to repay
black market cigarette debts.</TE>
<TE>   Where cigarettes aren't available, inmates smoke whatever they can
find, including orange rinds and apple peels, rolling them in toilet
paper and pages torn from books.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Herring, a commander at the Maine Correctional Center, said
a cigarette ban imposed two years ago on the prison's 600 inmates had
brought instant--though unintended--results. "We immediately created
600 entrepreneurs," he said. "It was like the alcohol prohibition of
the 1930s. Bang. There was a new illegal market."</TE>
<TE>   He said prison assaults also quadrupled.</TE>
<TE>   Even as word of the impending ban circulated through the San Luis
Obispo prison in May, Men's Colony inmates began gearing up for a
brisk trade in everything from canned tobacco to spent cigarette
butts, which are recycled and sold as bottom-shelf smokes. When the
prison canteen also stopped selling cigarettes, tobacco tins that
once sold for $11 began bringing as much as $75 on the inmate black
market, convicts say.</TE>
<TE>   Where inmates once plied even strangers with cigarettes, many now
hoard tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   So far, state corrections officials have left the decision to
totally ban inmate smoking up to each prison and only the Men's
Colony and Wasco State Prison have made the move. But as California's
30 other prisons watch to see how the ban works, inmates are already
searching for other diversions to break the monotony behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   "Bless their hearts, the people who came up with this," said one
Men's Colony inmate, Richard Brainard. "I'd like to strangle them."</TE>
<TE>   Corrections officials want to reduce prison health-care costs,
which run more than $1 billion a year in California.</TE>
<TE>   The prison already bans smoking in its reception center--where
inmates are housed temporarily until transferred to other
facilities--and most incoming inmates arrive from smoke-free county
jails.</TE>
<TE>   "Many inmates go months without smoking in jail," said Vizard.
"And here we were letting them go right back to their old ways."</TE>
<TE>   Sneaking cigarettes after smoking was banned in cells years ago,
inmates started costly fires when they stuck paper clips into
electrical outlets for sparks to light up.</TE>
<TE>   But the smoking ban includes what inmates say is a double
standard: Prison staff members can still smoke.</TE>
<TE>   If the goal was to cut health-care costs, said inmate Randy
Bishop, officials should also ban the practice among guards, who also
fall under a taxpayer-funded health plan. "Do it for everybody," he
said, "not just inmates."</TE>
<TE>   Russ Heimerich, a spokesman for the California Department of
Corrections, said double standards are part of prison life. "Our
officers aren't doing time," he said. "And we've got a lot worse drug
problems [among the prison population] than inmates who can't get a
cigarette. While nicotine withdrawal is bad, it's not the end of the
world."</TE>
<TE>   Officials will offer smoking cessation counseling and nicotine
patches to those with severe withdrawal. "And we're going to give
sensitivity training to staff so they won't flaunt smoking in front
of inmates," said Vizard, the Men's Colony spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Critics contend the ban is more about control than about public
health.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about dehumanizing inmates," said Drew Leder, a philosophy
professor at Loyola College in Baltimore and author of the book "The
Soul Knows No Bars: Inmates Reflect on Life, Death and Hope."</TE>
<TE>   "We can take away their right to vote, their TV rights, so why not
their right to smoke? Because in the eyes of society, these really
aren't people anymore. There's this notion that they're animals in
cages and that we can subject them to whatever treatment we wish."</TE>
<TE>   Countered Heimerich: "It's a whiny argument. Cigarettes aren't a
basic human right."</TE>
<TE>   Prisoner advocates say there are alternatives to a total smoking
ban.</TE>
<TE>   "States have to be careful with these policies or they can shoot
themselves in the foot," said Kara Gotsch, with the American Civil
Liberty Union's national prison project in Washington. "Smoking is a
health risk, but prisons can provide smoking areas where nonsmokers
don't have to be. What these total bans do is fan the flames of a
troublesome black market."</TE>
<TE>   Vizard says that the Men's Colony lacks money to enforce the ban,
but that anti-smoking announcements have appeared in prison fliers
and on the convict TV channel.</TE>
<TE>   Maine Correctional Center's Herring said it takes substantial
funding to alter such an inmate habit.</TE>
<TE>   Herring confiscates 100 pounds of black market tobacco a month. In
Maine prisons, underground cigarettes now sell for more than
marijuana joints, and smuggling rings are so common that the state
legislature recently created a new felony count for trafficking in
tobacco that enters an adult prison.</TE>
<TE>   "It's burning up all my resources," Herring said. "If you want to
stamp out prison smoking, you look past the short-term fix to the
long term. You can add all the rules in the world, but if you don't
have resources to enforce accountability, you're going nowhere."</TE>
<TE>   Utah officials fired several staff members involved in smuggling
schemes. Inmates there also bribed construction workers and medical
staff members to sneak tobacco behind bars. One nurse was caught with
tobacco in a hollowed-out heel of her shoe.</TE>
<TE>   "For some officers, there's too much money to resist," said Jack
Ford, a spokesman for the Utah Department of Corrections. "Others who
smoke say, "What's the big deal? It's only tobacco.' "</TE>
<TE>   The day after a total smoking ban was enforced in May, inmates at
the Wasco State Prison in Kern County staged a strike and refused to
go to work. A prison spokesman, John Katavich, said the ban has
worked nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   For the Men's Colony, the new smoking ban signals an about-face on
an old policy. Until 1971, it ran a factory for blending tobacco,
which was distributed to inmates statewide. "Times change," Vizard
said.</TE>
<TE>   Men's Colony inmates know their puffing days are numbered.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's time for me to quit," said one of them, Larry Decker.
"I'm scared. It's gonna hurt. But it's gonna be a good hurt."</TE>
<TE>   But Randy Bishop predicted that, even without smoke, there would
still be fire: "This will increase the violence. We're already
addicted."</TE>

<HD>Tenants Evacuate High-Rise After Terror Warning</HD>
<DH>Safety: Hundreds leave city's 2nd-tallest building after
tip that a plane would strike it. FBI determines threat is not
credible.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A telephone tip warning that a plane would strike the "First
Interstate building" on Monday prompted hundreds of downtown workers
to evacuate the second-tallest building in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   After learning of the unsubstantiated threat from the FBI and Los
Angeles police, managers at the Aon Center, previously known as the
First Interstate Tower, notified the 70 companies that employ about
3,200 people in the building.</LD>
<LD>   But no one left the nearby 73-story Library Tower, formerly called
the First Interstate World Center, which also received an early
notice Monday from the FBI.</LD>
<TE>   "We are the tallest building west of Mississippi; we're on a
first-name basis with law enforcement," said Peggy Moretti of Maguire
Partners, the owners of the Library Tower.</TE>
<TE>   "We get threats all the time. This was a bogus threat, and an
evacuation wasn't necessary."</TE>
<TE>   Laura Bosley, an FBI spokeswoman, said the bureau had notified
managers of both buildings of the telephone call received by KABC-TV
Channel 7 because it was not clear which of the former First
Interstate buildings had been referred to.</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Fair, the station's news director, said the call had
referred to the Library Tower.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Anastassiou, general manager of Aon Center, said he notified
tenants about 10 a.m. and issued a "purely voluntary" evacuation.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities told him that the caller had alerted Channel 7 to
train a camera on the "First Interstate building" because an airplane
would fly into it.</TE>
<TE>   Aon Corp., the building's largest tenant, with 833 workers, closed
its offices for the day, Anastassiou said.</TE>
<TE>   The company lost 175 employees in the World Trade Center attack
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The building's second-largest tenant, Wells Fargo bank, informed
its staff of 400 and allowed employees to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "A handful left, but most of [the] employees continued to work,"
said Mary Trigg, a company spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities found the person responsible for the tip, and after an
interview determined that the threat was not credible, Bosley said.</TE>
<TE>   She would not disclose who made the telephone call. "These threats
are common," Bosley said.</TE>
<TE>   For workers like Erin Furey, 27, the day was nerve-wracking. A
supervisor told her to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "The elevators were really clogged," the research analyst said.
"Some people even took the stairs."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the Library Tower should also have been evacuated,
Bosley said, "We don't recommend evacuations until we establish
something credible."</TE>

<HD>Planes Found Deathtrap in Canyon</HD>
<DH>Crash: The lead pilot saw the danger too late, a witness
says. Six died as two planes struck wall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH and ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The three small planes were flying in tight formation Sunday, with
veteran lead pilot Arpad Bottlo heading up a narrow canyon, when a
pilot behind them realized they were in trouble.</LD>
<LD>   "Can you make it out?" the trailing pilot radioed Bottlo.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think so," Bottlo replied.</LD>
<TE>   Seconds later, Bottlo's plane crashed into the steep wall at the
end of the canyon, killing him and his two passengers, Jesus
Lizarraga and Robert Maddux. A moment later, a second plane a few
feet behind Bottlo's crashed into the same canyon wall, killing the
pilot, Steve Herman, and his two passengers, Les and Gloria Stobbe.</TE>
<TE>   The third plane in the formation, a high-performance, kit-built
aircraft, was able to climb steeply and clear the ridge at the end of
the canyon. Five planes in two trailing formations also reacted in
time to avoid disaster.</TE>
<TE>   This account of the crashes in the rugged mountains of
southeastern Santa Barbara County came Monday from David Gibbs, pilot
of the last plane in line, as National Transportation Safety Board
investigators tried to determine what went wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The victims were identified by Gibbs; Craig Schulze, a passenger
in one of the other planes; and several friends and relatives.
Official identifications have not been released.</TE>
<TE>   NTSB investigators said it was too early to determine the cause of
the crashes. But Barry Schiff, a retired Trans World Airlines pilot
and air safety consultant, said the lead pilot may have made a
fundamental error.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the first things you're taught is that you never fly up a
canyon if you can't see your way out," Schiff said. "If the walls
narrow down or it turns out to be a box canyon, there's no way out of
there."</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs said the first three planes were only a few yards apart, the
second and third each slightly behind, slightly to the right and
slightly above the one ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "In formation flying, you put all your trust in the leader,"
Schiff said. "He's the one who determines where you're going and you
keep your eye on him, you don't look around."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't as though Bottlo lacked experience.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Hungary in 1943, he had been flying since the age of 16
and served as a pilot in the Hungarian Air Force, said his widow,
Valerie Bottlo. After immigrating to the United States in the
mid-1960s, he qualified as a pilot, earning both his commercial
pilot's rating and an instrument rating. He eventually purchased a
Beechcraft Bonanza, a peppy, single-engine plane he kept at the
Million Air facility at Van Nuys Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved flying and he loved that airplane," said Doug Butler,
Million Air's vice president of operations.</TE>
<TE>   "Flying was his life," Valerie Bottlo said. "He was doing what he
wanted, and I take solace from that."</TE>
<TE>   Lizarraga, one of Bottlo's passengers, was described by Schulze as
a "very sharp" pilot in his 20s who spent a lot of time at Whiteman
Airpark in Pacoima, working on his plane.</TE>
<TE>   Robert "Mad Dog" Maddux, 48, a resident of North Hills, a pilot
and a bachelor, owned PFM designs, an embroidery design business in
Van Nuys. His brother, John Maddux, said Mad Dog got the nickname
years ago while working at a restaurant "and it just stuck."</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't an angry man, the brother said. "He was a very
gregarious, outgoing person."</TE>
<TE>   "Life won't be the same without Mad Dog," said a friend, Eric
Alton.</TE>
<TE>   Herman, the pilot of the second plane, another Beechcraft Bonanza,
was 39, with a wife and three teenage daughters. He was a project
manager for Owens Evans and Son, a construction company in Newhall.</TE>
<TE>   Evans said Herman was a quiet man who took his work and flying
very seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to kid him, try to loosen him up," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Stobbe, 67, and his 70-year-old wife, Gloria, the
passengers in Herman's plane, lived in Granada Hills. She was a
homemaker; he was a retired woodshop teacher at a San Fernando Valley
high school.</TE>
<TE>   Their son, Forrest Stobbe, said his father had learned to fly as a
boy and flew crop dusters in Minnesota before moving to California.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved to fly," Forrest Stobbe said. "He was a good pilot, a
good mentor and a great father."</TE>
<TE>   The eight planes took off Sunday from Van Nuys Airport and were
headed for the small airport at Oceano, near Pismo Beach. The group
had reserved tables for lunch at Old Juan's Cantina in Oceano.</TE>
<TE>   Eva Verdin, whose father owns the restaurant, said she thought it
was strange that they failed to show up. "We always looked forward to
them coming," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The crashes occurred about 500 feet below the top of a 6,000-foot
ridge near Mt. Ardo, in the Los Padres National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, a team from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's
Department set out on foot for the remote crash site to recover the
bodies and gather evidence for investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Schulze, a pilot, said most of the eight pilots who flew together
Sunday were members of a loose-knit group of experienced airmen who
liked to hang out together on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   The group was known as "The Bonanche Boys" because of the planes
they flew--Bonanzas based at Whiteman Airpark and Piper Comanches
based at Van Nuys Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "We really scrutinize each other's performance to make sure that
the next time we go out, we'll be better pilots," Schulze said. "We
take it very seriously."</TE>

<HD>Simon and Davis Stall for Budget Advantage</HD>
<DH>Politics: Governor seeks to avoid painful choices while
rival declines to say where he would cut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>On the spring day Gov. Gray Davis issued his state budget, Republican
rival Bill Simon called a news conference to denounce the
proposal--hours before it was even released.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, Simon has refined his criticism. Stumping across the
state in the governor's race, the GOP hopeful has relentlessly picked
apart Davis' spending blueprint, assailing him for cuts in everything
from farm worker assistance to local police aid.</LD>
<LD>   But in the seven weeks since the Democratic incumbent produced a
plan to close California's $23.6-billion budget gap--something the
state Constitution requires him to do--Simon has yet to say how he
would solve the problem. It's not his responsibility, he says.</LD>
<TE>   As Monday's constitutional deadline for a budget came and went,
with lawmakers haggling, Davis and his main rival continued to pursue
similar strategies: stall, and hope to get by with as little pain as
possible between now and Election Day.</TE>
<TE>   The history of California budget politics suggests that will
probably work for both of them.</TE>
<TE>   Voters are notoriously inattentive to events in Sacramento, unless
those events start to impinge on their personal lives--say, if
Grandmother gets evicted from her nursing home, or if dialing 911
gets no response. Most analysts in both parties doubt the impasse
will reach that critical stage.</TE>
<TE>   "I just never have heard of a politician in California losing an
election based on the budget," said Tony Quinn, a Republican
strategist and 30-year student of state politics, who predicted "the
whole thing is going to be magically resolved by smoke and
mirrors"--accounting tricks, spending delays, bond sales, pension
adjustments and the like.</TE>
<TE>   The massive deficit obviously poses much greater political peril
to Davis than to Simon. The governor is dealing in real numbers that
will have tangible effects on Californians, who will end up paying
more taxes and getting less for their money.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Republicans are eager to portray the deficit and the
budget standoff as symptomatic of a larger failing, a lack of
leadership on Davis' part that recalls his widely faulted handling of
the state's energy crisis. Then as now, critics say, the governor
failed to act early enough, turning a foreseeable problem into a
multibillion-dollar mess.</TE>
<TE>   "He got himself into this fix," Simon said in a recent discussion
with reporters, in which he accused Davis of overspending when times
were good. "This is not rocket science. Everybody knows that
economies go up and down."</TE>
<TE>   But Simon's lack of specificity is not without some risk,
particularly for a first-time candidate with no experience in elected
office. "That's very dangerous for Simon," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe,
a political and policy analyst at USC. "It doesn't give voters any
insight into a man who is very little known." Jeffe said the tactic
gives "very little insight into his priorities, his ability to
understand state government."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has seized on Simon's own words, delivered during the
hard-fought Republican primary, to accuse Simon of irresponsibly
ducking the budget debate. "He correctly criticized his two
Republican opponents, saying you can't just criticize the governor,
you have to come up with an alternative plan," Davis told a radio
interviewer soon after he released his 1,000-page budget. "I think he
should take his own advice and have the courage to produce a plan."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Simon issued a rough budget-balancing proposal during the
primary, calling it proof that he was the "candidate of ideas" in the
GOP field. But even that sketchy proposal, after several revisions,
showed nearly $14 billion in red ink.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the shortfall would have been closer to $24
billion. But Simon now says he has no intention of explaining how he
would make up the difference. Once the budget passes, aides said, he
may have more to offer about the state's longer-term financial
outlook. "If people come back and say, 'You owe me more and more
specifics,' at some point I'm going to plead, 'I need a Department of
Finance to come up with specifics,' " Simon told reporters. "But I
think I've come up with an awful lot already."</TE>
<TE>   Among his proposals, Simon has called for slashing the state
payroll and a 15% cut in operational spending--the portion of the
budget that funds the bureaucracy--along with a freeze on any new
spending. As part of those operational cuts, he would reduce
health-care and education funding but has not specified which
programs he would target.</TE>
<TE>   On the revenue side, Simon flatly rules out tax or fee increases
to bring the budget into balance. Rather, he has called for a
reduction in the state capital gains tax and a $1.4-billion cut in
homeowners' property taxes. At the same time, Simon has proposed a
substantial increase in spending on child care, freeways and other
infrastructure projects.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, an adherent of Reagan-era supply-side economics, says
cutting the capital gains tax would actually yield more revenue, by
inducing people to sell their assets under more favorable terms.</TE>
<TE>   As for the cost of stepped-up road and bridge building, "the
public sector on its own would never be able to afford all the
state's needs," said Jeff Flint, a spokesman for the campaign.
"That's why Bill supports public-private partnerships and other
innovative financial means to get all of the roads and power plants
and reservoirs and parks and schools this state needs."</TE>
<TE>   If it all sounds rather imprecise, that is no accident. Vagueness
has its virtues, which explains why most politicians avoid specifics
to the extent possible.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost always the case that it's safer to be less specific,"
said Roy Behr, a Democratic campaign consultant who is not involved
in the Davis campaign. "In this situation, any proposal is going to
make you enemies."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, of course, has no choice but to present a balanced budget
in the greatest detail. The state Constitution sees to that. (There
is no penalty, however, for missing the July 1 deadline, which has
happened more often than not in the last 20 years.)</TE>
<TE>   What Davis can do is try to minimize the political pain, which he
has done with his mix of roughly $14 billion in program cuts and tax
increases.</TE>
<TE>   Education, which consistently tops the list of voter concerns,
goes largely untouched. Some of the largest spending reductions are
aimed at Medi-Cal--the main health-care program for poor people--and
the state's welfare recipients. Poor people are typically the least
likely to vote.</TE>
<TE>   As for revenue, instead of increasing income taxes--the most
conspicuous move and one favored by many fellow Democrats--Davis has
chosen to raise taxes on smokers and to increase the state's annual
vehicle registration fee. The latter would not take effect until next
year--well after the Nov. 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   To help close the budget gap, Davis also relies heavily on various
accounting shifts, budget transfers and loans, such as borrowing
against the state's future share of the national tobacco settlement
and postponing some school payments. Certain of those moves could
leave the state covering the costs well after Davis has left office.</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, the governor's top political strategist, maintained
that the budget cuts and tax increases, while not insignificant, are
not "going to drastically impact most people's daily lives."</TE>
<TE>   If that proves to be the case, and a budget is signed without
prolonged delay, the current impasse may be little more than a summer
sideshow for most Californians.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as kids can go to school and the health clinics stay
open," few voters will much care about the legislative
sausage-making, said Fred Silva, a budget analyst with the
nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. "There's an
expectation the world's going to continue on."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, he said, the details are lost on most people.</TE>

<HD>Health Alert Too Late, County Says</HD>
<DH>Disease: Chief of department says public should have been
informed of the Legionnaires' outbreak at Good Samaritan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County health officials acknowledged Monday that they
should have informed the public weeks ago about a Legionnaires'
disease outbreak at Good Samaritan Hospital, where nine patients
became ill, including two who died.</LD>
<LD>   Those health officials struggled to explain why they did not
release information about the risk even though they knew that one of
the patients infected with the respiratory ailment died in May. The
second person died in June.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors say it is unclear what role Legionnaires' played in the
deaths at the downtown hospital.</LD>
<TE>   Some disease control officials said they withheld information to
avoid public panic. But Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, director of the Los
Angeles County Department of Health Services, said his agency should
have released the information much sooner.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always felt that you ought to be forthcoming, no matter
what," Garthwaite said. "It's not a simple thing for a hospital
that's trying to stay in business. But it's not fair to the public
not to be aware what the challenges are."</TE>
<TE>   The county and hospital confirmed the outbreak Sunday night after
a Times reporter received an anonymous tip and contacted them.</TE>
<TE>   Good Samaritan officials stressed Monday that the problem is under
control and that the hospital is safe for patients.</TE>
<TE>   According to a timeline released by the county, health officials
first learned of two cases of hospital-acquired Legionnaires' at Good
Samaritan in March. At that point, disease-control experts encouraged
the hospital to test its water supply as the possible carrier. Those
tests came back negative.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the county became aware of two more cases, including the
death of a 67-year-old man on May 12, and began its own
investigation. Tests then showed the water system carried the
bacterium for the disease, and the hospital took steps to
decontaminate the plumbing system.</TE>
<TE>   On May 25, a 55-year-old man entered the hospital with heart
problems. He became ill with Legionnaires' and died June 15, the
county said. Officials have not released the identities of the
deceased.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Thomas Shook, Good Samaritan's chief of staff, said he doesn't
know how much Legionnaires' contributed to the two deaths because
both patients had other serious medical problems.</TE>
<TE>   "They had kidney failure. They had diabetes. They had high blood
pressure. They had severe cardiac disease," Shook said. "I can't tell
you scientifically that the Legionella [bacterium] did not play a
role, but there were many, many more serious problems on these
patients' problem list."</TE>
<TE>   All nine of the Good Samaritan patients were over 50 and had heart
problems. Eight had cardiac procedures in the hospital that ranged
from the insertion of a temporary pacemaker to coronary artery bypass
surgery. And eight also spent time on the same floor of the hospital
before becoming ill.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Leaf, the health department's chief operating officer, said
his agency did not act quickly enough to alert the public. He said he
did not know if a warning could have prevented other illnesses or
deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "Early on, we had enough that we could have done a simple press
release that would have provided this information to the public,"
Leaf said. "I do think Legionnaires' is something of interest
generally because it's rather notorious from its initial
identification" at a 1976 American Legion convention in Philadelphia.
Twenty-nine people died in that outbreak.</TE>
<TE>   Even while calling for more openness, Los Angeles County health
authorities said Monday that ongoing investigations prevented them
from disclosing the location of other infectious disease clusters.
They said they would release more information only if they identified
a compelling public reason.</TE>
<TE>   Good Samaritan officials said they began holding forums for
employees, volunteers and medical staff in April to educate them
about Legionnaires'.</TE>
<TE>   As far as the public goes, Shook said, "this is not something that
merits broadcast information. In the big picture of hospital
associated risks and so on, this is pretty small potatoes."</TE>
<TE>   A person becomes infected with Legionnaires' by inhaling water
droplets or mist containing the Legionella pneumophila bacterium.
Those most at risk include cigarette smokers, people with chronic
lung problems and patients who undergo major surgeries including
transplants.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, Legionnaires' disease affects 8,000 to 18,000 people
annually. Most cases are acquired in the home or community, not
health-care facilities. The disease is fatal in 5% to 30% of cases,
according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Symptoms include fever, chills and a cough. Some patients also
have muscle aches, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite and diarrhea.</TE>
<TE>   The Legionella bacterium is present naturally in the environment
and can be found in hot tubs, water tanks, humidifiers, cooling
towers and air-conditioning systems.</TE>
<TE>   In other parts of the country that have dealt with recent
Legionnaires' outbreaks, health officials say keeping secrets
undermines credibility. Pennsylvania health officials sent out news
releases several times a day and held press conferences to keep the
public informed during an outbreak last month.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get into any trouble when you involve everybody and let
everybody know," said Dr. Joseph DiMino, director of the Montgomery
County Health Department in Pennsylvania, where 12 people became ill,
including two who later died. "When you try to hold something like
that secret, when people find out, they think you're lying."</TE>
<TE>   DiMino shut down the wing of the nursing home in which patients
contracted Legionnaires'. He called the CDC and insisted that the
agency send a team up to study the outbreak. After the nursing home
was decontaminated, DiMino said, he even slept there to reassure wary
residents and family members.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said public health agencies are still learning about how
and when to share information. Last fall, when anthrax anxiety
gripped the country, health authorities were criticized for a slow
initial response to calm public fears.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson learned was that public health officials shouldn't hold
information back, said Stephen Morse, director of the Center for
Public Health Preparedness at Columbia University's Mailman School of
Public Health.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, Morse said, public officials are reticent because
they don't want to bring bad publicity to a facility that may be
working to solve the problem. "But I think there are many ways you
can reassure people and provide reliable information without damaging
the places where this is happening," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Legionnaires' experts, though, said public disclosure of
outbreaks may do more harm than good. Drawing attention to hospitals
trying to solve the problem may discourage other facilities from
finding out whether they have the bacterium in their water systems.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles health officials acted appropriately to protect the
public, said Dr. Jon Rosenberg, a medical epidemiologist with the
California Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think that a hospital is unsafe for patients and it can't
be made safe, then you close it down," he said. "By not closing it
down, you're saying that, to the best of your knowledge, it's safe
for patient care to go on."</TE>

<HD>District Meets Deadline for School Money</HD>
<DH>Education: For years, bond funds have gone elsewhere. The
change surprises skeptics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a major turnaround from its past failings, the Los Angeles Unified
School District met a crucial deadline by staking a claim for up to
$450 million in state bond money for building more than two dozen new
schools.</LD>
<LD>   For years, the district had lost funds to other school systems
because it was slow in sending in applications for construction
projects to the state. Critics said the nation's second-largest
school system remained too lumbering and inefficient to complete the
groundwork for new projects on time.</LD>
<LD>   Some skeptics were betting that the district would never complete
the paperwork, land acquisition, architectural designs and
environmental reviews by the deadline last week, even with the extra
time allowed for big, urban districts under a court order. "They
thought it was hilarious," said Constance L. Rice, a Los Angeles
civil rights lawyer who filed the lawsuit that resulted in that order
two years ago.</LD>
<TE>   The state set aside $750 million after a Superior Court judge
ruled that it was distributing too much of the 1998 bond money to
districts that are not severely crowded. A priority system was
created to help L.A. Unified claim as much as $450 million for
applications submitted by a June 26 deadline. Over the last year and
a half, the state distributed the other $300 million in installments,
and Los Angeles schools qualified for $250 million of that.</TE>
<TE>   After the court ruling, even the district's own officials
hesitated to predict how much they might get.</TE>
<TE>   But a revamped facilities team not only beat the deadline, it
pumped out applications for $916 million, far more than is currently
available. Even if state officials kick back some applications for
more work, Los Angeles school leaders say they are confident that
they will qualify for all $450 million. Other needy districts,
however, could take some of that money away under the state formula
for funding. Any projects not funded in this round will get in line
for funding by a $13-billion bond on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   In the last three months alone, the district produced plans for 29
new schools or school expansions, including several that were not
scheduled to be ready until as late as November.</TE>
<TE>   They include four high schools and two middle schools in the east
San Fernando Valley, one high school each in South-Central Los
Angeles and the Southeast area and three high schools, two middle
schools and four elementary schools in the central area.</TE>
<TE>   The strong finish surprised the district's critics.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought they would be able to come in with $200 million to $250
million in applications," said Jim Murdoch, executive director of the
Coalition for Adequate School Housing, which represents hundreds of
other school districts in California. The organization opposed the
use of a priority system, saying it would unfairly penalize other
districts that had been more efficient in applying for state money.</TE>
<TE>   But he applauded the district's success.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's great if the district has been able to move
forward," Murdoch said. "Clearly there is a great need for schools in
L.A.. The kids have been going without for too long."</TE>
<TE>   Those who had fought to secure the money for Los Angeles were
ecstatic, but still guarded last week about the potential pitfalls
ahead in building so many campuses at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Roy Romer feted his facilities team Wednesday with a lunch
in the courtyard of district headquarters. He hailed them as a
"remarkable team" that is only at the beginning of a long race.</TE>
<TE>   "In the first leg of it, you are way ahead of the clock," Romer
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rice said it is no time to be giddy. "There are still serious
problems."</TE>
<TE>   The hurdles ahead include completing environmental clearances,
hiring contractors and keeping dozens of projects on schedule and on
budget during construction. The projects submitted so far represent
less than a third of the program to build 80 new schools and expand
dozens of others. The majority of those projects will depend on the
approval of two bond measures in November, the statewide bond and a
$3.3-billion Los Angeles bond.</TE>
<TE>   Rice's law firm, English, Munger &amp; Rice, filed the March 2000
lawsuit that challenged the state's past practice of distributing
school construction and modernization money on the basis of the order
in which districts turned in applications, with no consideration of
need.</TE>
<TE>   It argued that students in large urban districts suffer
academically because of crowding and multitrack schedules and that
the state rules put those districts at a disadvantage in the
competition for funds. Suburban and rural districts can get their
applications in more quickly, the lawsuit contended, because of the
availability of vacant land in those areas. Large urban districts,
with few open properties, face unusual delays in condemning occupied
land or cleaning up vacant industrial sites.</TE>
<TE>   Even while advocating for the district in court, Rice had been
highly critical of district facilities staff for compounding the
delays and mismanaging the 1997 local bond and not applying for state
money fast enough.</TE>
<TE>   "They were running a circus here five years ago," Rice said. "They
started rolling out and spending money with no system in place."</TE>
<TE>   Rice, who was appointed in February 2001 to the citizen committee
that oversees spending of the local bond, said she has seen a "sea
change" in the district's facilities staff.</TE>
<TE>   The district has established credible plans and budgets for
modernization and new schools and has built the computer systems
needed to keep projects on track, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "They have the professional capacity to carry this to the next
step," Rice said. "Eighteen months ago I wouldn't have said they
did."</TE>
<TE>   Kathi Littmann, head of new school construction for the district,
said the success in qualifying for the funds also depended on smooth
handling of paperwork by the state Department of Toxic Substances
Control and Division of the State Architect. Both agencies added the
staff necessary to handle the high volume of work coming from Los
Angeles, Littmann said.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Education did its part, too, by approving all 43
authorizations for eminent domain that the staff has so far
requested, Littmann said.</TE>
<TE>   Outward signs of the school building program are still scanty, but
that will soon change, Littmann said. The district has completed
three new primary centers and one campus expansion in the last two
years and has seven other projects under construction. More than 60
projects, including 16 new schools, are on schedule to begin
construction this year.</TE>
<TE>   "By the end of September, things are going to be pretty harried,"
Littmann said.</TE>

<LD>A strip club has been bounced from a Reseda neighborhood and the
property owners permanently barred from leasing to any adult
business, under an agreement reached with the city.</LD>
<LD>   Showgirls Cabaret, the latest incarnation of the strip club in the
7200 block of Reseda Boulevard, was shut down in May under a
preliminary injunction, said Frank Mateljan, spokesman for City Atty.
Rocky Delgadillo.</LD>
<LD>   "This is one of those quality-of-life issues we're targeting,"
Mateljan said. "Eliminating the smaller problems and crimes will help
keep away the larger crimes."he club, which had generated complaints
of lewd conduct and prostitution since at least 1997, should never
have been granted a permit because it was located within 500 feet of
homes, a violation of zoning laws, Mateljan said.</LD>

<HD>Happy Birthday ... Now Grow Up</HD>
<DH>An adolescent America remains a paradox in the family of
nations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA BARNOW</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Birth order invariably influences our standing in the family, and,
along with our personalities as children, can cause us to be forever
defined as, say, "the middle child" or "the smart one." So it is with
nations.</LD>
<LD>   In the context of the family of nations, it is likely that the
United States will always be viewed as a young country. Our buildings
and landmarks, few more than two centuries old, include no royal
palaces, and our institutions lack the weathered character created by
repeated political and social change. Our contributions to art,
literature and music, though distinct and honored, have not been
tested over time.</LD>
<LD>   Compared with elder nations, we are inexperienced in traditions
and history. Most probably the popular view is that our immaturity
holds us back from appreciating the wisdom that emerges from
long-standing religious and political struggles, many wars in the
homeland and centuries of cultural bursts and upheavals.</LD>
<TE>   The paradox is that while we maintain the position of superpower,
we do so as an adolescent--and more significantly, an adolescent with
money. We display the confidence and arrogance of a 15-year-old boy.
We know everything, we can do everything, we are entitled to
everything and, naturally, we should be exempt from any and all
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   History shows that this headstrong, self-serving posturing
sometimes jeopardizes our ability to maintain constant allegiances,
especially when it is accompanied by aggressive actions (bombing Iraq
and Afghanistan), dismissive actions (ignoring land mines and
environmental issues raised by the United Nations) and irresponsible
actions (selling arms to hostile countries for short-term political
gains).</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, since Sept. 11 our posturing and rhetoric,
particularly related to "the axis of evil," have energized a broader
and more visible disdain from foreign leaders as well as their
citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, for all the negative reviews, our nation continues to garner
respect for those characteristically adolescent qualities that have
helped us prevail as a superpower. We aim high, dismissing obstacles,
and we are ready to take on the world and change it. We are willing
to take risks and often succeed. We are full of passion and dream
big. Just like a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   And in the same way that adults regard an arrogant and slightly
rebellious teenager, the world views us with a mix of disdain and
admiration. Other countries eye our materialism and freedom while
they comment on our shallowness.</TE>
<TE>   Often we are envied because we accumulate and are completely at
ease with state-of-the-art technology; yet, we are also criticized
for those attributes.</TE>
<TE>   As we approach our nation's 226th birthday, we are reminded of the
origin and course of our history. Doubtless, we will be reminded of
our patriotism, newly charged since Sept. 11. Our leaders will rally
us to celebrate not only our own passage to independence and
democracy but also our commitment and support for these principles in
other countries. Once again, we will honor ourselves as "the greatest
country in the world."</TE>
<TE>   So, happy birthday to the United States of America. We face a very
different future than we did on our last birthday, and, according to
tradition, it is time to reflect. Is it to our advantage to remain
eternally adolescent, to face the challenges of terrorism and global
relations with single-minded determination and resilience? Or is it
time to inch into adulthood, cultivating wisdom and restraint?</TE>

<HD>Will a Skidding Dollar Be Our Achilles' Heel?</HD>
<DH>A sharp decline in the greenback could trigger mayhem in
the stock market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans are justifiably focused on the rotten state of American
corporate financing, and President Bush is going to New York City
next week to give the fat cats a spanking. But maybe it's too late to
avoid substantial damage because foreigners have reached a negative
judgment about the U.S. economy--a judgment that has already eroded
the value of our money and could even cause a crash in our stock
market.</LD>
<LD>   As the London-based Financial Times noted last week, in 2000 the
inflow of foreign investment into the United States was $228 billion.
In the second half of 2001, the inflow had reversed; the U.S.
suffered an outflow of $16 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Should ordinary Americans be worried? After all, growth in our
gross domestic product in the first quarter of 2002 was recently
revised upward to a sizzling 6.1%.</LD>
<TE>   The best single measure of any economy in a worldwide context,
however, is the worth of its currency. Put simply, strong economies
have strong currencies. In the 1970s, as the U.S. slumped, the dollar
fell by a quarter against the world's currencies. Yet for most of the
last two decades, strong growth brought the dollar up again.</TE>
<TE>   And so smug Americans dismissed the euro, the new trans-European
currency that debuted in its preliminary electronic form in January
1999. The euro started trading at 117% of the dollar, but it skidded
to just 83% in October 2000. Why? Because the globalized money
markets concluded that Europe's economy was stagnating, while the
United States' was booming. In the last few months, however, the euro
has shot back up to parity with the dollar as speculators figure that
maybe Uncle Sam isn't so great after all. The dollar is even
weakening against the long-sick Japanese yen.</TE>
<TE>   Some say that a falling dollar is good because it makes American
exports cheaper. At the same time, of course, imports--from
electronics to oil--get more expensive. And, over the long run, a
cheaper dollar stokes inflation because, as each dollar can purchase
less, sellers raise their prices to stay even.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the weaker dollar has already started a vicious cycle of
disinvestments in the United States. Foreigners believe that the
dollar is going to be worth less, so they hold fewer
dollar-denominated assets, such as U.S. stocks or bonds. And yet, as
they scale back investment, the weakening demand depresses the
greenback further.</TE>
<TE>   So where will this dollar depreciation lead? A June 19 study
published by four Goldman Sachs economists asserted, "We have long
regarded the strength of the U.S. dollar as unjustifiable." The
report goes on to forecast that the dollar will decline by an
additional 8% against world currencies over the next 12 months. Even
then, the study continues, the dollar still will have further to
fall.</TE>
<TE>   Given the rotten state of corporate America, such a further dollar
decline might be inevitable, and yet the Goldmanites note a greater
danger if our money loses too much too soon. Their report recalls a
brief interlude of dollar deterioration, from 1985 to 1988, when the
dollar fell by about a third. During those years, the decline in the
dollar destabilized financial markets in the U.S., and this
destabilization was "the trigger mechanism that helped to generate
the 1987 stock market crash."</TE>
<TE>   Yikes. Remember Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones
industrial average fell 508 points--22.6%?</TE>
<TE>   Could that happen again? The Goldman folks don't think so because
they don't see a sharp decline in the dollar. But others do. Famed
currency trading tycoon George Soros told the Wall Street Journal on
Friday that he wouldn't be surprised to see the dollar lose a third
of its value over the next few years. And since a one-third drop in
the dollar helped trigger the '87 crash, a dollar-watching doomsayer
could predict another black day for the market sometime soon.</TE>
<TE>   In today's numbers, such a fall would clip off about 2,000 points
from the Dow. That would be ruinous to many investors, but it's not
so hard to imagine because it's happened before. So of course Bush
should lecture Wall Street, but he should also keep in mind that the
world market is watching too, looking for signs that he is focused on
the economy, stupid. And that means keeping the dollar strong,
dammit.</TE>

<HD>New Genes, a New Human Nature-- and New Dangers</HD>
<DH>Technology is rapidly outpacing ethical concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS PRUGH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As teenagers about to graduate from high school many years ago, a
friend and I were allowed to stand righteously at the pulpit before
our church congregation and rave on about our elders' mishandling of
current events. Their failures--racism, the Vietnam War, the
flammability of the Cuyahoga River--were egregious and reflected
basic human defects, we opined. Our solution? Change human nature.</LD>
<LD>   It seemed like a good idea at the time. But now that the actual
possibility of changing human nature looms before us, I'm not so
sure.</LD>
<LD>   The decoding of the human genome and the rapidly evolving
technologies of genetic manipulation open doors to scientists that,
until now, were largely closed to all but God or natural selection.
Almost daily we read of breakthroughs in genetic technologies, many
of which tantalize with the promise of disease prevention and cure.
But others raise profound social and political concerns. Two
technologies, reproductive cloning and inheritable genetic
modification, are so unsettling that they demand immediate,
societywide scrutiny and debate.</LD>
<TE>   Reproductive cloning--or making a genetic duplicate--is already
familiar enough, thanks to the story of Dolly the sheep, to have bred
contempt. Apart from the moral issues--the degradation of human
autonomy and individuality--the statistics are not comforting. Data
gathered by Scottish scientist Ian Wilmut, Dolly's "father," suggest
that it takes about 116 cloned eggs to produce one live-born
offspring. Most of the offspring suffer from serious defects. There
is no reason to expect human clones to fare any better.</TE>
<TE>   Reproductive cloning of humans is banned in more than 30
countries, though not yet in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Even more Faustian dangers are posed by inheritable genetic
modification, or IGM. This process changes the genes in eggs, sperm
or embryos to produce certain traits in an organism that are then
passed on to its descendants.</TE>
<TE>   IGM has not yet been tried on humans. People sometimes assume that
it might offer the hope of "fixing" inherited afflictions such as
Tay-Sachs disease and cystic fibrosis. But other methods that don't
require gene manipulation can more easily address these problems.</TE>
<TE>   The real attraction of IGM for the scientists promoting it is the
possibility of engineering humans to specification--"designer
babies." Some envision, and even appear to welcome, a world in which
the human species has split into the "GenRich" and the "Naturals,"
genetic castes so divergent as to preclude interbreeding. It's not
hard to imagine the perniciousness of the resulting social order.</TE>
<TE>   The dreams of human perfectibility were disturbing enough when the
tools available were crude. Now new tools are emerging that promise
far greater precision, but human motives and impulses have not
evolved apace. Those most eager to pursue IGM seem no more
enlightened than Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. when he wrote, in a
Supreme Court decision upholding Virginia's forced-sterilization law,
that "it is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to
execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for
their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit
from continuing their kind."</TE>
<TE>   All this argues not for the panicked suppression of all genetic
technologies but for firm restraint while we educate ourselves about
them.</TE>
<TE>   Yet events are rushing far ahead of the debate and threaten to
race out of control. The U.S. Patent Office began accepting patent
applications for sections of human DNA years ago; several million are
pending. The time when clinics begin running newspaper ads offering
customized offspring may not be that far off.</TE>
<TE>   Congress and many states are grappling with cloning-ban proposals,
though no politicians are talking about IGM yet. Indeed, only a few
narrow constituencies have weighed in on these matters. What about
the rest of us?</TE>
<TE>   Genetic technologies could transform human nature, and nothing
affects us all more than that. We must engage this issue now, or soon
we will open the door to the harsh glare of a brave new world to
which we did not consent.</TE>

<HD>God's Got Nothing to Do With the Pledge of Allegiance Furor</HD>
<DH>Gutless politicians are stoking mob passions against a
brave ruling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Belief in God is not the issue in the continuing brouhaha over the
constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance. Rather, it's the
government's endorsement of a monotheistic God. That and the
gutlessness of politicians in failing to support the right of two
brave justices to dare invoke the spirit of the 1st Amendment in a
thoughtful, if controversial, ruling. Instead of appealing for calm
debate, our political leaders have demagogically stoked the passions
of a mob. Is it any wonder that nuts are now sending death threats to
both the jurists and the parent who brought this case to court?</LD>
<LD>   True political leaders would have cautioned against intemperate
attacks on the court and urged respect for the judicial evaluation of
a profound and complex constitutional issue. They also would have
pointed out that the Constitution requires the courts to be on
continual guard against official actions that undermine the
separation of church and state.</LD>
<LD>   Why the hysteria now, when the decision is on hold pending appeal?
The conservative U.S. Supreme Court is likely to reverse the circuit
court. But whatever one's position on the pledge, the shrill
overreaction by a bipartisan chorus of politicians and pundits is
alarming.</LD>
<TE>   "Just nuts" was the contemptuous reaction of Senate Democratic
leader Tom Daschle, who added that the Pledge of Allegiance affirmed
"our belief in a supreme being.'' Does Daschle intend by "our belief"
to deny the patriotism of those Americans who do not endorse the
senator's monotheism? Or does he believe that the second-grader who
is Buddhist or Hindu or, God forbid, simply more absorbed in learning
to read than contemplating the unknowable should have to mumble the
proscribed words for the sake of national unity? Should a teacher who
is a freethinker or a deist, as were many of the country's earliest
patriots, be forced to lie to her students by being required to lead
them in the oath?</TE>
<TE>   It was in consideration for such rights and protections of the
individual that 9th Circuit justices Alfred T. Goodwin and Stephen R.
Reinhardt held that the "under God" clause, which Congress added to
the pledge in 1954 under the pressure of McCarthyism, violated the
U.S. Constitution's prohibition on establishing a state religion.</TE>
<TE>   In no way is this an anti-religious position; it is a defense of
religious freedom from state control. A school district is "conveying
a message of state endorsement of a religious belief when it requires
public school teachers to recite, and lead the recitation, of the
current form of the pledge," Goodwin, a Nixon appointee to the bench,
wrote in his decision.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, when students invoke by rote the image of an almighty
that we as a nation are said to live under, it trivializes
consideration of religious and spiritual issues, as well as what it
means to be a true patriot. Who knows what's going on in some child's
mind as he chants the magical "God" word that none dare question--it
could be God as a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of a blind loyalty oath to God and country--as defined by
Congress and the president--the schools should be encouraging study
of the complex relationship between religion, in all its forms, and
civic society. They can begin with the example of the
Afghanistan-based terrorists who also claimed to be living in a
nation "under God."</TE>
<TE>   The brilliance of our Constitution is that it protects the
personal rights of the individual, including students and teachers,
against the conformist pressures of the majority. The founders had
ample experience with the particularly coercive effect of a dominant
religion and for that reason inserted the ban on official religion in
the 1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   The framers of the Constitution were veterans of a revolution
against a king whose divine right to rule the colonies was sanctioned
by the official church of England. The Fourth of July, now upon us,
should therefore be an occasion to celebrate the inalienable right of
the individual to rebel against the dictates of state-sponsored
religion.</TE>
<TE>   What the Constitution requires, and what two highly experienced
justices attempted to affirm, is the principle that the government
ought never be allowed to arbitrarily compel an individual American's
allegiance to anyone else's notion of God.</TE>

<HD>Bring Back Superfund Tax</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On Monday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie
Whitman stood on a smog-shrouded peak in Tennessee's Great Smoky
Mountains National Park and pledged to create "a healthier future for
our children and a cleaner environment for our future in all the
different parts of our great country."</LD>
<LD>   Actions say more than words, however, and the administration's
recent decision to reduce spending on the Superfund--the national
trust established in 1980 to clean up toxic waste sites where the
original polluter is out of business or unable to pay--belies
Whitman's sweet rhetoric.</LD>
<LD>   In the beginning, the government paid for the Superfund largely by
forcing economically viable corporations that pollute to pick up the
tab for the cleanup of sites left by deadbeat companies. Congress
eliminated that corporate tax in 1995.</LD>
<TE>   The fund has been evaporating ever since, even though the
government has supplied it with small infusions of cash. The fund
contained $3.8 billion in 1996, but unless something is done it will
shrivel to $28 million by next year.</TE>
<TE>   The administration plans to eliminate money for 33 Superfund sites
in 19 states, according to a report released Monday by the EPA's
inspector general.</TE>
<TE>   For example, federal officials this year told the citizens of
Edison, N.J., that the agency would start carting away contaminated
soil this fall at the former site of Chemical Insecticide Corp.,
which manufactured the carcinogen Agent Orange for use in the Vietnam
War. According to Monday's report, however, no money will be
available for the cleanup.</TE>
<TE>   What's needed is a 180-degree policy shift. Bush should support a
bill introduced last month by Sens. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.),
Lincoln Chafee (R-R.I.) and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) that would
reinstate the special Superfund tax that chemical and oil companies
paid.</TE>
<TE>   The American Petroleum Institute contends that the Superfund
unfairly required the oil industry to shoulder 57% of Superfund
taxes, even though the petroleum industry was responsible for "less
than 10% of the share of liability at Superfund sites."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Superfund's tax formulas could be improved. But simply
eliminating the tax altogether is a breach of social and corporate
responsibility. That's why President Reagan and the first President
Bush both reauthorized the corporate Superfund tax.</TE>
<TE>   One in four Americans live within four miles of a Superfund site.
The corporations that created these problems sites have brushed off
any responsibility to protect the public from toxins that increase
the risk of getting cancer and other diseases. People count on their
government to be less reckless.</TE>

<LD>In the last 10 months, we've become more accustomed to seeing
firefighters as heroes. Now, how "gut-wrenching," as one official put
it, to see two of them--a Forest Service worker and an Arizona
contract firefighter--accused of igniting two of the summer's
largest, most damaging Western wildfires, destroying hundreds of
homes and millions of dollars in property, including timber.</LD>
<LD>   The damage is much greater these days than in generations past
because more buildings are near forests, and after decades of fire
suppression, poor maintenance and drought there's much more to burn.
Tons of volatile kindling per acre await a heat source. In frontier
times, wildfires were regular occurrences, sometimes set purposely to
ease travel, clear land or aid wildlife foraging (and thus hunting).
Today's conflagrations are extraordinary events.</LD>
<LD>   It's not unprecedented in low-income areas, as idled woodlands
often are these days, for wildfires to be set by those seeking
seasonal work fighting them. Nor is it unknown for fires to be
started by regular firefighters with arson in their hearts.</LD>
<TE>   In recent times, Americans also have seen the occasional nurse who
murdered patients; too many priests who violated their calling;
greedy corporate chieftains who lied, bilked companies and hid their
doings; accountant watchdogs who became lap dogs; inattentive
government regulators; stock advisors with financial conflicts. Their
motives--including derangement, revenge, laziness and pure
profit--matter less than the accumulating wounds to collective trust.</TE>
<TE>   Think of the myriad ways we each trust daily--children and
parents, husbands and wives, employee and employer, driver and
driver, friend and friend. Now imagine distrust there. Frightening,
isolating, weakening.</TE>
<TE>   By next spring, the fires' nitrogen-rich ashes will nourish a
bounty of grasses, wildflowers and seedlings. But nature works on
more enduring cycles than humans. It will take 80 or 90 years for
this summer's fire damage to heal. That's far longer, we hope, than
our own recovery from so many seemingly coincidental wounds to our
collective human trust.</TE>

<HD>Pass Budget, Then Move On</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here we are again, the second day into fiscal 2002-03 with no state
budget. Budget struggles in recent years were worked out with
relative amity and a lot of horse-trading between the parties. But
this election-year deadlock has a feeling of real bitterness to it.</LD>
<LD>   Assembly Republicans oppose any tax increase. Gov. Gray Davis and
Democrats say there is no way to close a $23.6-billion shortfall
without some tax hikes.</LD>
<LD>   The budget passed Saturday by the Senate contains $3.6 billion in
tax and fee increases. In the Assembly, the GOP was adamant about not
raising taxes but vague about where to get the needed cuts. In that
case, Democrats said, there was nothing to negotiate. Stalemate.</LD>
<TE>   Both sides argue with fervent political rhetoric. But the most
telling statement came from Davis aide Susan Kennedy, who said,
"Believe me, if we could have cut our way out of this and not raise
taxes, Gray Davis would have done that in a moment."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the governor had to be dragged into a tax increase, since
he knew he would be hammered with it by his Republican reelection
foe.</TE>
<TE>   The revised budget that Davis submitted in May proposed doubling
the annual license fee on autos, bringing in $1.3 billion by taking
back much but not all of the fee reduction of the last three years.
The Senate initially substituted a temporary income tax increase on
the wealthiest Californians but went back to the auto fee last
weekend to win the necessary votes.</TE>
<TE>   This patchwork budget proposal contains about $7 billion in
program cuts, but much of the remaining deficit is offset with
deferred spending, loans and other fiscal gimmicks. No doubt more
cuts are possible, but the GOP demands would seriously curb services
to the most needy, in particular those who rely on Medi-Cal health
care. Schools and local governments also would suffer deep cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans say Davis caused the deficit by spending too much, but
they fail to document their charge that the cost of government has
risen more than under his GOP predecessors. The cause was in large
part the sudden plunge in income tax revenues.</TE>
<TE>   California taxpayers, who have received billions of dollars in
state and federal tax relief, should be willing to temporarily yield
a small percentage of that to keep the state from cutting back
further on trauma centers or college scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   The state will continue to function for now. But at some point,
true difficulty will set in as the state is unable to pay for
equipment and supplies. The budget now before the Assembly is
tolerable for one budget cycle in a very bad period in the state's
fiscal history. There are no good alternatives. The Assembly should
hold its nose, pass the budget and concentrate on improving the
state's fiscal outlook before the next budget comes due.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Court's Message to Students: Just Say No to the Chess Club,"
Commentary, June 28: Over two years, 243 students were tested; only
three students tested positive [in the Pottawatomie school district
in Tecumseh, Okla.]. The Office of National Drug Control Policy found
that in a study carried out by the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance
System it was reported that among high school students throughout the
U.S. in 1999, 26.7% reported being current users of marijuana. Almost
half (47.2%) of the high school students surveyed reported using
marijuana at least once.</LD>
<LD>   The notion of testing students involved in extracurricular
activities obviously does not bring the suspected results.
Drug-testing good students does not accomplish the goals because
these students are obviously not users or, even worse, abusers. It
would be much more logical to test students who are failing classes,
exhibiting bad citizenship and not getting involved in
extracurricular activities.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Student Drug Test Law Valid," June 28: Since drugs are "a
serious national problem" and the populace has "legitimate concerns
in preventing, deterring and detecting drug use," I propose that we
implement regular (perhaps weekly) drug testing of Supreme Court
justices.</TE>
<TE>   They have nothing to hide, right? American citizens have the right
to know that the court's decisions are not clouded by drug use.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The expectation of privacy for an adult is already gone. The
Supreme Court has been eroding this right since the late 1980s. It
began with random drug-testing of transportation workers and moved to
industry as a whole in the 1990s and now teens must give up their
rights to privacy too. Involuntarily relinquishing your bodily fluids
the first time will be embarrassing and humiliating. It will become
easier with subsequent tests. After all, we still need to get into
good schools and we still need those paychecks.</TE>
<TE>   It is much easier to manage and govern those who do not question
authority. Perhaps if our esteemed justices had to urinate into a
bottle, the ruling would have been different?</TE>

<LD>I see in "Senate GOP Wins Funding Battle for Missile Defense" (June

federally sponsored commission reports that millions of Americans
will be unable to attend college because they can't afford it
("Rising Costs Pricing Millions Out of College, Committee Says").</LD>
<LD>   In our attempts to build one of the most sophisticated military
systems ever constructed we will have to import scientists from other
countries because not enough of our own citizens will have been
trained sufficiently to be involved in the project. This, of course,
will have a far more serious effect on our national security than the
vaporous nuclear threats that even the most advanced missile defense
system would be unlikely to be effective against.</LD>

<LD>Re "Arguing, Through Repetition, That Liberals Caused Priest
Scandal," June 29: Fifty years ago, a huge scandal rocked my small
hometown in western France (40,000 souls). The police, acting on a
tip, had uncovered a ring of pedophiles whose members represented the
cream of the town's bourgeois society. Only one priest was involved
(the provost of the boys' Catholic school, in charge of enforcing
discipline); all the others were married, with children, models of
conservative ethics, pillars of their parishes. Not one homosexual
among them. And certainly no liberals.</LD>
<LD>   This was not to be an isolated incident; several other towns were
found to have similar rings of pedophiles. Perhaps Michael Rose, the
author of "Goodbye, Good Men," should reconsider his theories and
refine his research.</LD>

<LD>While the forest fire season has started early and resulted in major
losses, any suggestion that this is perhaps the worst fire season on
record is absurd (letter, June 26). A quick look at the historical
record shows that at least a dozen more major fires like the ones in
Arizona or Colorado must occur to even reach the annual average of
acres burned as recently as the 1950s--and many more than that to
reach the level of the 1930s when, on average, an area almost 100
times the size of the Rodeo-Chediski fire burned each year.</LD>

<LD>Re "Pledge of Allegiance Violates Constitution, Court Declares," June
27: President Bush stated that God gave us our freedoms. Whatever
happened to the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights?
We thought these documents were written by our forefathers and gave
us our freedoms, including the freedom of religion to worship or not
worship as we choose. Are we to assume that true Americans are true
believers and all others are somewhat less?</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With regard to WorldCom's fraudulent business transactions, President
Bush stated in his radio address on Saturday that "no violation of
the public's trust will be tolerated." That is a fine and honorable
statement to make, but why didn't he make it sooner? A more astute
president would have said this before Enron bilked California out of
billions of dollars, or before employees' and investors' pension
money went flying into the executive pockets of Halliburton, Arthur
Andersen, Global Crossing, Tyco, ImClone, WorldCom and Xerox.</LD>
<LD>   The signs were there, but Bush chose to ignore them. His current
indignant demeanor is meaningless. The people who lost their life
savings wanted him to say this months ago, not just when it was
politically prudent.</LD>

<TE>   So, Bush comes out with both guns a'blazing concerning WorldCom's
financial shenanigans. It seems to me that the only mistake [former
WorldCom Chief Executive] Bernie Ebbers ever made was not taking his
10-gallon hat, his cowboy boots and his corporate headquarters down
to Texas to join the good ol' boys club.</TE>
<TE>   Better to be an insider with the administration than end up the
whipping boy for all of that unrealized national frustration over the
failure of Congress to rip open the scandal of the earlier fiasco.</TE>

<TE>   It seems investors are finally beginning to walk away from
corporate America's little game of three-card monte. With any luck
they'll be returning with pitchforks, torches and real penalties for
white-collar crime. I propose one year in federal prison for each
count of "economic murder." One year for each job lost, for each nest
egg destroyed. A few 147,000-year sentences should get their
attention.</TE>

<TE>   The greed-motivated executives from Enron, Tyco, Adelphia, Arthur
Andersen and now WorldCom have caused great financial ruin, not only
to their employees and direct shareholders but to the rest of us. The
collapse of their businesses has exacerbated the decline of the stock
market--the same stock market that has the majority of our retirement
funds in the form of 401(k) accounts.</TE>
<TE>   I am 57 years old and hoped to retire by age 60. Not now, as the
value of my 401(k) has declined so dramatically because of the market
free fall--caused by these greedy robber barons. I want all their
ill-gotten wealth to be taken from them and invested back into the
market to prop it up. Then I want them all in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Gosewisch</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The public has been urged, by the likes of Bush and House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, to accept the plan to "privatize" Social Security
funds by investing retirement money in the stock market. With all the
current revelations of skulduggery and market manipulation, we now
see that those most injured are the small investors and retirees. If
that is their best thinking, how can we rely on any of their
policies?</TE>

<TE>   While the 9th Circuit Court is at it, it should remove "In God We
Trust" from our currency and place it where it belongs--on stock
certificates. That is, until Congress and the president make
corporate executives accountable for their "ungodly" activities.</TE>

<LD>Re "Hahn Assails Breakup Effort at Fund-Raiser," June 26: Why is
Mayor James Hahn fighting so hard to keep the citizens of Hollywood,
the Valley and L.A. from having our voices heard by way of a
democratic vote on secession? Why is he trying to deny his
constituents' rights to have a say about our destiny?</LD>
<LD>   What he and City Council members Tom LaBonge and Eric Garcetti
have had to say about Hollywood and the Valley functioning as
independent cities has been overwhelmingly negative and dire. They
are telling the citizens and businesses of Hollywood and the Valley
that we are less capable of coming together to make successful cities
than those in Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Burbank, Glendale, Culver
City or Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Do they seriously believe that those cities would have been better
off had they been part of Los Angeles all this time?</LD>
<TE>   Clearly they have benefited from their more manageable size and
independence. It's time to vote for secession.</TE>

<TE>   Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. and
a leader in the Valley secession movement, reported that the
association backs the split. He even quotes the number of families in
the organization who back dismemberment of the city. As members of
the SOHA, I and my family were not polled for our opinion. We do not
support secession. I hope that others will voice their opposition to
what appears to be a very arbitrary decision.</TE>

<TE>   What is Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge) thinking (June
27)? He is on the record as supporting Washington Mutual's Ahmanson
Ranch project. How can he run for mayor of the Valley and take a
position opposite that of the majority of Valley residents, who know
that this disastrous development will cripple our road system, worsen
our air and water quality and destroy our quality of life? If we are
hoping for better representation in a Valley city, we wouldn't get it
with Richman.</TE>

<LD>Officials of a national Latino medical organization said Monday that
the lack of health insurance and the inferior quality of care
continue to plague Latinos in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   The National Hispanic Medical Assn. held a briefing in Los Angeles
to call attention to new research by a health advocacy foundation.
The group's briefing summarized the findings of New York-based
Commonwealth Fund, which conducts research to support increased
access to medical insurance and collected its findings through phone
interviews with Latinos throughout the country.</LD>
<LD>   The report said language barriers are often responsible for poor
health care for Latinos. Monday's briefing also showcased culturally
sensitive programs operating at L.A. clinics and hospitals that,
among other things, provide treatment for Latinos by people who speak
their own language.</LD>

<HD>Officer Who Aided Driver Still Critical</HD>
<DH>Accidents: Officials say Bruce Hunt of the LAPD was pinned
between two vehicles after he stopped to help a motorist, who was
later arrested.</DH>

<LD>A Los Angeles police officer remained hospitalized in critical
condition late Monday from injuries suffered in a multiple-car crash
over the weekend in Santa Clarita, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Bruce Hunt, 40, was off duty Saturday night when he
stopped on the Antelope Valley Freeway to help crash victims and was
pinned between two vehicles in a subsequent accident.</LD>
<LD>   Hunt suffered a broken pelvis, fractured clavicle, collapsed
lungs, two fractured femurs and internal bleeding, police said.</LD>
<TE>   The 14-year LAPD veteran is married and has a 7-month-old son,
friends said.</TE>
<TE>   Hunt was taken to Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission
Hills after the accident.</TE>
<TE>   He was described Monday as an extraordinary officer and
humanitarian by friends and fellow officers.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Jack Richter, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman,
said it came as no surprise that Hunt stopped to help someone.</TE>
<TE>   "He saw that somebody needed help. It didn't matter that he was
off duty," Richter said. "That's something that he would do."</TE>
<TE>   Hunt was among several officers who received the Medal of Valor,
the department's highest award for bravery, for actions during a
confrontation with a violent suspect holed up in a warehouse in
Canoga Park in May 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Michael Albanese said Hunt has been involved in several
high-risk operations as a member of the SWAT team.</TE>
<TE>   Hunt also has volunteered for children's charities by running
marathons--even helping push a child in a wheelchair in one of them,
Albanese said.</TE>
<TE>   The freeway accident occurred about 11:30 p.m. Saturday near San
Fernando Road, according to the California Highway Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Losee, 43, of Santa Clarita lost control of his 1993
Lincoln Continental and swerved into the concrete center divider on
the northbound side of the Antelope Valley Freeway, CHP Officer Jeff
Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   Hunt and his partner, Eduardo Perez, 32, stopped their patrol car
on the right shoulder to try to help Losee and a passenger, Ellen
Ishima, 46, of Redondo Beach.</TE>
<TE>   As Hunt and Perez were administering first aid, the drivers of a
1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse and a 1997 Chrysler Concorde slowed down as
they came upon the accident, police said.</TE>
<TE>   But, police said, another motorist, Jackie West, 34, of Tehachapi,
failed to notice the slowing traffic. His 1992 Isuzu Trooper
sideswiped the Concorde and then hit the Eclipse, sending that
vehicle out of control. The Eclipse struck the patrol car, and the
Isuzu pinned Hunt against Losee's car.</TE>
<TE>   Losee, 43, was treated at Providence Holy Cross Medical Center for
neck and back pain and released, police said. His passenger, Ishima,
was treated for a broken clavicle at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial
Hospital and released.</TE>
<TE>   Losee was arrested on suspicion of felony drunk driving.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said an investigation into the chain-reaction accident
was continuing.</TE>
<TE>   No one besides Hunt suffered a life-threatening injury, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Janine McMillion, a friend of the Hunt family, said relatives and
friends were comforting his wife, Kathy, and helping to care for his
son, Steven.</TE>

<HD>East Hollywood Charter School Opens</HD>
<DH>Education: With 1,500 students, Santa Monica Boulevard
Community is believed to be the nation's largest such elementary
campus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His voice booming and his eyes bright despite months of nonstop work,
Principal Andy Johnson stepped up Monday to a microphone set up on
the playground at Santa Monica Boulevard Community Charter School and
shouted a question: "Can you guys say ownership?"</LD>
<LD>   "Ownership!" the 900 students seated in neat rows before him
roared back.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson beamed. "This school belongs to your moms and dads and
teachers," he said. "It belongs to you."</LD>
<TE>   Though the east Hollywood campus has been at Santa Monica
Boulevard and Van Ness Avenue since 1910, Monday marked its first day
as a charter school, independent of most restrictions by the Los
Angeles Unified School District or state of California. With 1,500
students attending year-round, the school is the nation's largest
independent elementary charter school, according to district
officials and state consultants.</TE>
<TE>   From now on, the school will still get about $4,500 per pupil from
the state as do other public schools, but it will be able to spend
the money as its leaders see fit. The campus also will receive
federal money, adding to an annual budget of about $11 million.</TE>
<TE>   All across the cramped blacktop, which has slowly been eclipsed by
portable classrooms to accommodate ever more children from the
surrounding immigrant neighborhoods, that freedom fueled different
dreams.</TE>
<TE>   For Rolando Garcia, long frustrated with the education his second-
and fourth-grader have received, it means he is going to hold off
putting his children in private school and give the charter campus a
chance.</TE>
<TE>   Fifth-grader Yaneli Luna had some ideas of her own.</TE>
<TE>   "At a charter school, you can make your own rules," the
10-year-old said. "Maybe now we can eat on the playground."</TE>
<TE>   Her principal smiled, but indicated this was not the kind of
reform he spent the last two years yearning for as he struggled to
design the school's charter, even as he was working there as an
assistant principal. Johnson will be in charge of instruction, and
co-director Vahe Markarian will head up operations.</TE>
<TE>   For Johnson, 32, becoming a charter school means his teachers
won't be forced to use Los Angeles Unified's reading program, Open
Court. The campus can instead adopt alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   It means keeping the unusual configuration of some classes, which
group three grades in one room with one teacher for three years. It
means paying instructors 5% more than Los Angeles Unified teachers
earn. It means "no more fried chalupas from the LAUSD cafeteria,"
Johnson said, because now a private company will be contracted to
provide school lunches.</TE>
<TE>   Broken doorknobs, nonfunctioning computers and punctured soccer
balls all can be fixed immediately instead of waiting weeks or months
for the district to respond, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Charter schools, which receive state funds but are exempt from
most state and local regulations, have been permitted in California
for the last decade. The reform was designed to reinvigorate public
education by forcing local school districts to compete for students,
give local educators more freedom and provide innovative models for
districts to emulate.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, as in this case, charters are granted by the local
school district, but county and state boards of education also can
create them. As a sign of support from the Los Angeles school board,
its president, Caprice Young, attended Monday's opening.</TE>
<TE>   About 5% of the state's approximately 400 charter schools have
been shut down for everything from not attracting enough students or
failing to live up to standards to misusing public funds and teaching
religion, said Gary Larson, a spokesman for the California Network of
Educational Charters.</TE>
<TE>   Believers insist that schools such as Santa Monica Boulevard can
provide beacons to guide the public education system toward
improving.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very gung-ho," teacher Debbie Stern said. "As a teacher, I
should have the right to do something more than just walk in and walk
out. I should have a say in how a school operates. I want that
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Except for a handful of teachers who chose to leave because they
were uncomfortable with the charter concept, most of the staff
agreed, Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   Parents are enthusiastic as well, officials said. Neighborhood
children have the right to attend the campus just as they did before
it converted to a charter, and officials say that to their knowledge,
no one has transferred.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said he is nervous but not very worried. "It's
put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is time. If things don't go well,
there's no one to really point the finger at," he said. "We don't
know what's in store. But it's going to be good."</TE>

<HD>Dolores Gray, 78; Stage and Screen Singing Star</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dolores Gray, the sultry, Junoesque singing star of such MGM musicals
as "It's Always Fair Weather" and "Kismet," as well as Broadway and
the West End stage, has died. She was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Gray, who began singing professionally in Hollywood supper clubs
at age 14, died Wednesday in her Manhattan apartment of a heart
attack.</LD>
<LD>   The young songstress had dabbled in clubs, radio, film and
Broadway before she dazzled her way to the big time overseas in
London's West End in 1947. When legendary Ethel Merman, to whom Gray
was often compared, decided not to portray "Two Gun Annie" when the
show moved from Broadway to London, Gray became the historic
sharpshooter, breaking all Coliseum theater records in "Annie Get
Your Gun."</LD>
<TE>   The show ran two years and 11 months and was seen by more than 2.5
million people, including the king and queen and Princesses Elizabeth
and Margaret. Previously unknown in Britain, Gray charmed the
populace as well as her audiences and critics, one of whom described
her voice as "warm brandy."</TE>
<TE>   "Dolores Gray brought a welcome touch of Hollywood glamour to drab
postwar London," noted the London Daily Telegraph in its obituary
Friday, "and the newspapers chronicled with relish her colorful
outfits, her hats, her crocodile skin handbags and her
extravagance--how, for example, she had had her gray Persian cat,
Scheherazade, brought over in its own cabin on the liner Queen
Elizabeth."</TE>
<TE>   Success abroad guaranteed success at home. In 1954, Gray earned a
Tony for her part in the short-lived musical "Carnival in Flanders,"
memorably singing the Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke song that
became a classic, "Here's That Rainy Day."</TE>
<TE>   After a brief brush with Hollywood in her 1944 debut film, "Mr.
Skeffington," Gray was signed to a contract for MGM musical
extravaganzas. She made four of them from 1955 to 1957--earning fifth
billing in "It's Always Fair Weather" after Gene Kelly, Dan Dailey,
Michael Kidd and Cyd Charisse, and third billing in the 1955 version
of "Kismet" after Howard Keel and Ann Blyth.</TE>
<TE>   Gray ranked in the middle of a bevy of famous actresses in "The
Opposite Sex," a musical remake of "The Women," after June Allyson
and Joan Collins and before Ann Sheridan and Ann Miller. And she was
third to the star couple, Gregory Peck and Lauren Bacall, in
"Designing Woman."</TE>
<TE>   The singer appeared on several television variety shows in the
1950s, among them "The Milton Berle Show" and "The Ed Sullivan Show"
and in tributes to such music men as Cole Porter.</TE>
<TE>   She also recorded extensively for Capitol Records and was a
popular cabaret singer, appearing in such nightspots as New York's
Copacabana and the Empire Room of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Her rich contralto voice occasionally graced the vast Hollywood
Bowl, usually in salutes to the music of Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   But Gray's most prolific work was done on the stage. After her
1944 Broadway debut in "Seven Lively Arts" with Bea Lillie, Gray
graduated to leading roles in such Broadway, West End and touring
musicals as "Are You With It?", "Two on the Aisle," "Pygmalion,"
"Can-Can," "Silk Stockings," "Lady in the Dark," "The Pajama Game,"
"The Unsinkable Molly Brown," "Destry Rides Again," "Gypsy" and "42nd
Street." She later led revivals of "Gypsy" and "Follies."</TE>
<TE>   Although she considered her voice "fragile" and said she had
merely learned to amplify it, Gray was known for belting with the
best. In addition to her Tony-winning "Here's That Rainy Day," she
stopped shows with such songs as the title number of "Sherry" and in
1959 overrode the noise of firefighters battling a curtain ablaze as
she sang "Anyone Would Love You" to Andy Griffith in "Destry Rides
Again." She was credited with keeping the 1,500-member audience calm
until the fire could be extinguished.</TE>
<TE>   Once Britons came to know Gray in "Annie," she remained popular
there. In 1963, she continued to delight them with her
extravagances--such as bringing along 12 full-length mink coats to
keep her warm and two bodyguards to protect them. "My mother said to
me," she explained, " 'It's not a very happy life unless you make it
very big.' "</TE>
<TE>   Gray's life began quite humbly. She was born in Chicago to
squabbling parents who divorced when she was 2, and her father died
when she was 7. Throughout her life she carried a bullet in her left
lung, an inoperable wound suffered in the crossfire of a gang fight
during her youth.</TE>
<TE>   Brought to Hollywood by her mother, Gray initially trained to
become a dancer, but soon switched to singing and found jobs in
nightclubs until her tender age was discovered. Rudy Vallee had heard
her, however, and featured her on his national radio broadcast when
she was 15, opening doors to a brighter future.</TE>
<TE>   Single most of her life, Gray had a loud and litigious engagement
to an American oil tycoon in the early 1960s and then was married for
nine years to California businessman and race horse owner Andrew
Crevolin. That marriage ended in divorce.</TE>
<TE>   Gray is survived by a stepdaughter, Joanne Kildare of Alamo,
Calif.</TE>

<HD>Jack Montgomery, 84; WWII Hero Won Medal of Honor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack C. Montgomery, a World War II Medal of Honor recipient whose
single-handed attack on three strongly defended enemy positions
accounted for 11 dead and 32 prisoners during the Battle of Anzio,
has died. He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Montgomery, who had been on dialysis, died June 11 in Muskogee,
Okla.</LD>
<LD>   A veteran of Oklahoma's 45th Infantry Division, Montgomery first
experienced combat as a platoon sergeant in Sicily in the summer of
1943. He received a battlefield commission as a 2nd lieutenant
shortly before participating in the invasion of the Italian mainland
at Salerno, after which he earned a Silver Star.</LD>
<TE>   On the morning of Feb. 22, 1944, Montgomery had been fighting
nearly seven straight months and was a 1st lieutenant commanding a
rifle platoon near Padiglione, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours before daybreak, according to his Medal of Honor
citation, a strong force of German infantry established itself in
three echelons in front of Montgomery's platoon. The nearest enemy
position--four machine guns and one mortar only 50 yards away--posed
the most immediate threat to Montgomery and his men.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with his M1 rifle and several hand grenades, Montgomery left
his platoon behind a stone wall and crawled up a shallow ditch to
within hand grenade-throwing range of the enemy. He then climbed atop
a small mound and, after firing his rifle, threw his grenades. He
killed eight of the enemy soldiers and captured the remaining four.</TE>
<TE>   After returning to his platoon, Montgomery called for artillery on
a house about 300 yards away, in and around which he suspected most
of the enemy were entrenched. Armed with a carbine, he then crawled
up the ditch to the second enemy position 100 yards away.</TE>
<TE>   Despite facing heavy fire, the citation reads, "he attacked this
position with such fury that seven of the enemy surrendered to him,
and both machine guns were silenced." Later that morning, three enemy
dead were found in the area.</TE>
<TE>   It was daylight when Montgomery continued moving toward the
German-held house. After the artillery barrage ended, the citation
reads, he "ran fearlessly toward the strongly defended position. As
the enemy started streaming out of the house, 1st Lt. Montgomery,
unafraid of treacherous snipers, exposed himself daringly to assemble
the surrendering enemy and send them to the rear."</TE>
<TE>   As a result of Montgomery's "fearless, aggressive and intrepid
actions that morning," 11 enemy soldiers were killed, 32 were taken
prisoner and an unknown number were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   That night, while helping an adjacent unit repulse a
counterattack, Montgomery was hit by mortar fragments and badly
wounded. In January 1945, after spending months in the hospital, he
was ordered to Washington, where President Franklin D. Roosevelt
presented him with the nation's highest military honor.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just doing the job I was supposed to be doing," Montgomery
said years later. "It just happened that I got lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Cleveland Montgomery was born near Long, Okla., on July 23,
1917, and grew up on a farm. Montgomery, whose mother was Cherokee,
attended Bacone Junior College in Muskogee, which had been founded to
educate Indians when Oklahoma was still Indian territory.</TE>
<TE>   While in college, where he became a star running back, Montgomery
enlisted in Company I, 180th Infantry of the 45th Division of the
Oklahoma National Guard. The integrated division, whose symbol was a
Thunderbird, consisted of Indians from more than 50 tribes.</TE>
<TE>   He left the division after receiving a scholarship to the
University of Redlands in California, where he earned a physical
education degree.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Oklahoma just as the 45th Division was being
mobilized and reenlisted. After serving the required year, Montgomery
was discharged as a sergeant in September 1941.</TE>
<TE>   But after the attack on Pearl Harbor three months later, he again
reenlisted. (Eight members of the 45th Division received Medals of
Honor during World War II.)</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Montgomery worked for the Veterans Administration
in Muskogee and in surrounding towns.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Joyce, and three sisters: Syble
Claymore of Marksville, S.D., Hazel Johnson of Chickasha, Okla., and
Okemah Arey of Tulsa.</TE>

<HD>Albert Solnit, 82; Yale Child Psychiatrist, Advocate</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Albert J. Solnit, a Yale child psychiatrist whose classic
writings with the late Anna Freud focused custody disputes on the
primary needs of the child, died June 21 in a car accident in
Bethlehem, Conn. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Solnit, along with Freud and Joseph Goldstein, a Yale law
professor, wrote an influential series of books on family psychology
and law.</LD>
<LD>   The first was "Beyond the Best Interests of the Child," published
in 1973. It was followed by "Before the Best Interests of the Child,"
in 1979, and "In the Best Interests of the Child," in 1986.</LD>
<TE>   The books have shaped family law in many states and have been
cited in more than 1,000 appeals cases involving custody issues.</TE>
<TE>   Solnit's work with Freud and Goldstein put forth the idea that the
state should not interfere in families except when evidence of
neglect or abuse is presented, or if divorcing parents are unable to
make their own decisions about who should care for a child.</TE>
<TE>   Once a child protection agency or court has intervened, however,
Solnit and his co-authors stressed that it should consider the "least
detrimental" placement that would promote the child's development.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of giving priority to the child's interests was
controversial when Solnit and his colleagues first began to discuss
it. Family courts tended to give greater weight to the needs of the
parents or adults involved in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "Those books set the standard and provided guiding principles for
decision-making in child-placement issues," said Barbara Nordhaus, a
social worker and psychoanalyst at the Yale Child Study Center, who
called Solnit "a quintessential child advocate."</TE>
<TE>   Nordhaus said that in many hotly contested custody cases the
child's needs still are not treated as paramount, but that Solnit's
ideas remain "a frame of reference. You can agree or disagree, but
everyone says these are the things we think about."</TE>
<TE>   During the controversy two years ago over Elian Gonzalez, the
young Cuban shipwreck survivor, Solnit was unwavering in his focus on
determining what was best for the child.</TE>
<TE>   He compared the protracted tug of war between Elian's father in
Cuba and his anti-Castro Miami relatives with a contentious divorce.</TE>
<TE>   "We see this all the time in divorcing parents who use the child
as a way to keep fighting," Solnit told the online magazine Salon in
2000. "The parents stay tied to one another through aggression--and
the child is just a medium to do this, gets treated like chattel."</TE>
<TE>   He favored reuniting Elian with his father, noting:</TE>
<TE>   "Look, I wouldn't like to live in Cuba. But for a young child, the
parent is the country."</TE>
<TE>   Solnit was one of three children of Eastern European immigrants
who met in St. Louis. The family moved to Sierra Madre shortly after
Solnit was born.</TE>
<TE>   He attended Pasadena schools, then spent a year at UCLA before
transferring to UC Berkeley. He earned his bachelor's degree in 1940,
his master's in 1942 and his medical degree in 1943--all from
Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   He initially wanted to be a pediatrician, but developed an
interest in psychiatry after World War II, when he served in the Air
Force.</TE>
<TE>   "There were many people in the Air Force suffering from battle
fatigue and having psychological and psychiatric problems," said his
sister, June Solnit Sale, a child advocate in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He attended a military school of neuropsychiatry, then was posted
to Germany, where he was assigned to treat the families of
servicemen.</TE>
<TE>   Solnit joined the Yale Child Study Center in 1952, and was its
director from 1966 to 1983. He became a full professor in 1964 and
retired in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   He also served as commissioner of the Connecticut Department of
Mental Health and Addiction Services for nine years, ending in 2000.
During his tenure, he oversaw the deinstitutionalization of thousands
of psychiatric patients and fostered a mental-health system that was
oriented more toward the family and the community.</TE>
<TE>   For 20 years, he was managing editor of "The Psychoanalytic Study
of the Child," an annual compilation of leading papers in the field
of child psychoanalysis.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his sister, Solnit is survived by his wife, Martha;
a daughter, Ruth of Seattle; sons David of Berkeley, Ben of New
Haven, and Aaron of Bath, N.H.; and seven grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Chase Ends With Arrest of Suspect in Killing of Ex-INS
Agent Near Santa Ana</HD>
<DH>Crime: Gregory Pisarcik, who led police in a pursuit Sunday
through Ventura County, is expected to be booked in the slaying.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An unemployed sales clerk arrested after leading police on a chase on
Ventura County freeways was expected to be booked late Monday in
connection with the beating death of a retired immigration agent near
Santa Ana, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Gregory Michael Pisarcik, 25, is a suspect in the murder and
robbery of Narciso Leggs Jr., 53, said Jim Amormino, spokesman for
the Orange County Sheriff's Department. Leggs' body was found by
sheriff's deputies Saturday inside his garage apartment on Irvine
Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   The victim was bound and gagged and had been tortured,
investigators said. Leggs' landlord had called police after not
seeing his tenant for two days.</LD>
<TE>   An autopsy indicated that Leggs died at least two days earlier
from blunt-force trauma to the head, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   Robbery was the likely motive for the attack, Amormino said. The
victim's apartment had been ransacked and several personal items
stolen.</TE>
<TE>   Pisarcik was arrested late Sunday after a two-hour chase that
began in Ojai when he refused a deputy's order to pull over for
questioning. Pisarcik was driving the victim's late-model Lincoln
Continental. Authorities were alerted by a man whose daughter saw a
man changing the license plates on the car at a Ventura shopping
center.</TE>
<TE>   Amormino said Orange County sheriff's detectives believe Pisarcik
is linked to robberies in recent months in several south Orange
County beach communities.</TE>
<TE>   "We are asking for help on this," Amormino said. "We suspect that
he may have been involved in robberies of gay men."</TE>
<TE>   Leggs, who retired in 1997 after 22 years with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, lived in a converted garage apartment in an
unincorporated area between Tustin and Santa Ana. Neighbor Jody
Preston-White, 41, said she often saw Leggs polishing his two prized
automobiles--the Lincoln and a mauve Rolls-Royce.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told investigators that in recent weeks Pisarcik had
been a frequent visitor to Leggs' apartment, he said.</TE>

<LD>An unemployed sales clerk who was arrested after leading police on a
wild chase through Ventura County over the weekend was expected to be
booked late Monday in connection with the beating death of a retired
immigration agent, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Gregory Michael Pisarcik, 25, is a suspect in the slaying and
robbery of Narciso Leggs Jr., 53, said Jim Amormino, spokesman for
the Orange County Sheriff's Department. Leggs' battered body was
found by sheriff's deputies Saturday inside his garage apartment in
the 2100 block of Irvine Boulevard in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   The victim was bound and gagged and had been tortured,
investigators said. Leggs' landlord became suspicious after not
seeing his tenant for two days and called police.</LD>
<TE>   An autopsy performed Sunday revealed that Leggs died from a blow
to the head, Amormino said. The victim had been killed at least two
days earlier, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Robbery was the likely motive for the attack. The victim's
apartment had been ransacked and several personal items had been
stolen, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's definitely our suspect," Amormino said of Pisarcik. "The
murder investigation is ongoing, but we're only interested in him.
[The body] was badly assaulted. It was a violent confrontation."</TE>
<TE>   Pisarcik was arrested late Sunday night after leading Ventura
County authorities on a two-hour chase that began in Ojai when he
refused a deputy's order to pull over for questioning. Pisarcik was
driving the victim's late-model Lincoln Continental.</TE>
<TE>   Although he declined to give details, Amormino said Orange County
sheriff's detectives believe Pisarcik is linked to several robberies
in recent months against gay men in south Orange County beach
communities.</TE>
<TE>   "We are asking for help on this," Amormino said. "Hopefully, if
the public has information they will come forward with it."</TE>
<TE>   Two of Leggs' handguns--a .45-caliber and a .357 magnum--were
among the items allegedly taken by Pisarcik, officials said. The .357
magnum, loaded and cocked, was recovered from Leggs' car along with a
box containing 50 rounds and several loaded gun clips.</TE>
<TE>   Leggs' converted garage apartment is connected to a house in an
upper-middle-class neighborhood between Tustin and Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Leggs "had a gentle spirit about him. He was kind of laid back,"
said neighbor Jody Preston-White, 41.</TE>
<TE>   She said Leggs often polished his two prize automobiles--the white
Lincoln Continental and a mauve Rolls-Royce.</TE>
<TE>   Preston-White said that Pisarcik, whom she recognized from a
television news broadcast Monday, drank from her garden hose last
Thursday. A few hours later, she heard the two men arguing in the
apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "It was weird," she said. "He just didn't belong. It just didn't
sit. It gave me the heebie-jeebies. The whole thing has really
freaked me out."</TE>
<TE>   Pisarcik, a transient, had previously stayed with friends and
relatives in Ojai and Orange, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told investigators that in recent weeks Pisarcik had
been a frequent visitor to Leggs' apartment, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   A key break in the case came Sunday afternoon when a young girl at
a Ventura shopping center noticed a man changing the license plates
on a parked white Lincoln Continental similar to the one stolen from
Leggs.</TE>
<TE>   The girl told her father, who informed the car's owner of the
switch. Sheriff's deputies were given the new plate number and
spotted Pisarcik a few hours later in Ojai, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   Pisarcik then led Ventura County sheriff's deputies and California
Highway Patrol officers on a chase throughout the western end of the
county. He was taken into custody after surrendering at an equipment
yard on Ventura's west side.</TE>
<TE>   During the pursuit, Pisarcik drove between 25 and 100 mph,
swerving across lanes and driving into oncoming traffic.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Pisarcik allegedly fired Leggs' .357 magnum at
Deputy Robert Davidson's vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "He fired a shot at the passenger window, and it was an attempt to
scare Deputy Davidson off," said Capt. Gary Pentis of the Ojai
sheriff's station.</TE>
<TE>   Leggs retired from the Immigration and Naturalization Service in
1997 after a 22-year career as an agent, said Francisco Arcaute, a
spokesman for the INS office in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of his retirement, Leggs was a supervisor in the
detention and deportation office at the INS, which handles immigrants
suspected of violating deportation laws, Arcaute said.</TE>
<TE>   Pisarcik was sentenced to 60 days in Ventura County Jail in July
2000 in connection with a grand theft and embezzlement conviction.</TE>
<TE>   He also had served time for narcotics possession in Orange County,
Amormino said.</TE>

<HD>Baby Abandoned Outside Building</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police are searching for the mother of a newborn
found in a cardboard box Sunday. The boy is hospitalized in good
condition.</DH>

<LD>Police were looking Monday for the mother of a newborn boy who was
found in a cardboard box outside a downtown Los Angeles apartment.</LD>
<LD>   A resident returning home about 8:45 p.m. Sunday found the infant
on the doorstep and called police.</LD>
<LD>   "She was only gone for half an hour," Los Angeles Police Officer
Alex Baez said.</LD>
<TE>   "And in that time span, the baby was left there."</TE>
<TE>   The 5-pound, 4-ounce newborn was in good condition Monday at
County-USC Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. The baby, who
had part of his umbilical cord attached, is believed to have been
about 2 hours old when he was found in the 2300 block of Griffith
Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever delivered this baby cut the umbilical cord and tied it,
cleaned the baby, put the baby in clean clothes and supposedly left
him on the doorstep of an apartment," said hospital spokeswoman
Adelaida De La Cerda.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery came about three weeks after a baby girl was found
outside an apartment in Panorama City, naked and covered in blood.
She was treated at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles for hypothermia
and released to the county's custody.</TE>
<TE>   Three days earlier, the body of another newborn girl was found on
a conveyor belt at a waste processing plant in the City of Industry.
An autopsy found that the infant had died of blunt-force trauma.</TE>
<TE>   A California law, dubbed the "safe haven" law, allows a woman to
leave her baby at a hospital, health clinic or fire station within 72
hours of delivery without being questioned or prosecuted for child
abandonment. In the last couple of months, two babies have been
safely surrendered that way, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Force of Hawaii Blowhole Kills Sylmar Teen</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: He straddled the opening, was tossed into the air
by a geyser and fell into the hole.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The body of a Sylmar teenager on vacation with his family in Hawaii
was pulled from the ocean Monday, about 18 hours after he was washed
head first into a blowhole that is a popular Honolulu tourist
attraction.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said that Daniel Dick, 18, a recent graduate of First
Lutheran High School, was straddling the Halona Point Blowhole, which
is closed off and marked with signs warning tourists to stay back.
About 100 people watched Sunday as a wave tossed him into the air and
then washed him head first into the ocean, said Honolulu Fire Capt.
Richard Soo.</LD>
<LD>   Rescuers in boats and helicopters, scuba divers and snorkelers
combed the area, but called off the search at 8 p.m. when the sun
set. They resumed searching at 5:30 Monday morning, with Dick's
mother and two younger brothers waiting at the shore, Soo said.</LD>
<TE>   At about 10:30, two scuba divers found the body 20 feet offshore
in about 15 feet of water.</TE>
<TE>   Family and friends said Dick had been student body president at
First Lutheran High School, worked two jobs and was the fastest
checker at the supermarket where he worked. The trip to Hawaii was a
graduation present.</TE>
<TE>   "They took him there because he had worked so hard to graduate and
they [his family] were so happy," said Suzi Underwood, his math
teacher. "He was really looking forward to it."</TE>
<TE>   Dick had taken a public bus to Sandy Beach on Sunday with three
girls he had met in Waikiki, Soo said.</TE>
<TE>   Though tourists are supposed to observe the blowhole from a
distance, Soo said that witnesses saw Dick, who was 6-feet-3 and 180
pounds, approach it and let the water splash on his chest.</TE>
<TE>   The blowhole, which is like a geyser, is a result of a cliff
jutting over an underwater cave, Soo said. Water rushes into the cave
and then gushes through the hole. The bigger the waves, the stronger
the force of the geyser.</TE>
<TE>   Dick got closer and closer to the hole, and finally straddled it,
Soo said. At that moment, a large swell washed in and sent a geyser
into the air.</TE>
<TE>   "He went head first into the air, and that was the last anyone saw
of him," Soo said.</TE>
<TE>   In Sylmar, news of Dick's death traveled swiftly through the First
Lutheran Church and school, where many had known the family for
decades.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a big heart in a little skinny body," said Isabel Ritz,
the student council advisor. "He was friendly and kind and he was
wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Students at the high school consoled each other Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "The student body is just devastated," Underwood said. "He was the
class clown. He pretty much lit up the class wherever he went."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers said Dick planned to study business administration at Cal
State Northridge in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Through officials in Honolulu, his mother said he was the top
checker at a supermarket in Sylmar, and was so fast at moving people
through the line that the store had planned to enter him in a
regional contest.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers remembered him as a responsible student, always looking
out for his younger brothers, but one who did not hesitate to stick
swizzle sticks up his nose to make others laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Underwood said that Dick used to take attendance in one of her
classes, and every day he would "totally disrupt the class when he
came in," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "He would always come strolling in, all goofy, and say something
to crack the class up," she said. "But I couldn't get mad at him,
because I loved him and the kids loved him ... He just did it to
brighten their day."</TE>
<TE>   Underwood also said he was a fiercely protective older brother, a
protection he extended not just to his own two brothers and sister,
but to anyone being picked on.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was some injustice going on, he would step in if he
thought it wasn't right," Underwood said.</TE>
<TE>   At least two other people have died after falling into the Halona
Blowhole.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Rodrigues, 18, of Honolulu was killed April 13, 1986, when
he fell into the hole. Reports said Rodrigues was squatting next to
the hole, trying to look inside, when a wave struck.</TE>
<TE>   On July 24, 1969, Robert Barry Lee, 26, was swept into the hole by
the force of a wave as he was trying to warn a young woman about
getting too close to the opening. Lee called for help while inside
the hole, but was swept to sea and died.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 10, 1967, Schofield Barracks soldier Jeffrey Terte fell
into the blowhole but lived and was rescued.</TE>

<HD>Bustamante Supports Hollywood Secession</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante said Monday that he supports Hollywood
secession, but opposes a breakaway bid by the San Fernando Valley
because it would harm the rest of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Bustamante, who is from the Fresno area, is the highest-ranking
elected official to weigh in on the secession campaign so far.</LD>
<LD>   The lieutenant governor said he had decided to back Hollywood
independence at the request of Gene La Pietra, the leader of the
secession drive. La Pietra has been Bustamante's friend and political
supporter for five years.</LD>
<TE>   "I support Hollywood secession and not Valley secession,"
Bustamante said. "I just think there is a dramatic difference.
Hollywood is a small community. It has its own identity."</TE>
<TE>   The loss of Hollywood and its roughly 160,000 residents would not
hurt the finances of the remainder of Los Angeles nearly as much as
Valley secession would, Bustamante said. The Valley is home to 1.35
million people.</TE>
<TE>   "Having the Valley secede would almost destroy Los Angeles,"
Bustamante said.</TE>
<TE>   Both cityhood proposals are on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra said Bustamante's backing would give the Hollywood
campaign a big boost, especially among Latino voters.</TE>
<TE>   About 35% of Hollywood residents are Latino, and secessionists
have stepped up efforts to win over Latino voters.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra, a nightclub owner, said he has given a total of $5,000
in political contributions to Bustamante over the years, most
recently in 2000. Bustamante said the contributions did not influence
his decision on Hollywood secession.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Los Angeles City Council is scheduled today to
formally ask the Local Agency Formation Commission to reconsider its
decision putting Hollywood secession on the ballot.</TE>

them, are going to oppose secession," Kuwata said.</TE>
<TE>   "Cruz usually does not want to be associated with losing ventures,
but I guess he's changing."</TE>
<TE>   Kuwata noted that former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa and
City Council President Alex Padilla are campaigning against
secession.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis has not taken a position.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Los Angeles City Council is scheduled today to

<TE>   A resolution before the council says the LAFCO decision was
"neither lawful nor based on adequate fiscal analyses."</TE>

<HD>7 Identify Suspect in Gang Shootings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven witnesses came to court to identify Samuel Shabazz in five gang
shootings, a volume of evidence a prosecutor called "staggering"
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "It's possible for one eyewitness to be mistaken; the odds against
seven witnesses being mistaken are astronomical," Deputy Dist. Atty.
Anthony Manzella told jurors in closing arguments. "When you convict
the defendant, you can say ... you participated in seeing that
justice was done."</LD>
<LD>   Jurors began deliberations Monday in the case against Shabazz for
nine attempted murders and the killing of former Los Angeles Police
Chief Bernard Parks' granddaughter, Lori Gonzalez, two years ago.</LD>
<TE>   The defense attacked state witnesses, many of whom were gang
members, and suggested that prosecutors made bad deals and that
police planted evidence. Defense attorney Robin Yanes focused on
Darrell Miller, who made a deal with prosecutors and had a lot to
gain by identifying Shabazz.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors "gave him his life," Yanes said. "He is absolutely
worthless."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, a member of a gang with ties to Shabazz's West Boulevard
Crips gang, identified Shabazz in court as the man who shot Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez was driving out of a parking lot after buying fast food
in Southwest Los Angeles when she was shot in the head and chest a
week before her 21st birthday. Police believe her passenger, Ernest
Gray, a member of the Black P Stones Bloods gang, was the intended
target.</TE>
<TE>   Miller testified that Shabazz and his gang believed the car Gray
and Gonzalez were driving had been used in a previous shooting.
Miller spotted the car at a fast food restaurant and informed the
gang members.</TE>
<TE>   Manzella said jurors shouldn't discredit testimony from Miller, a
convicted drug dealer and robber.</TE>
<TE>   Shabazz "commits crimes in front of people like himself," Manzella
said. "Whatever condemnation you make about Darrell Miller's life,
you can make about the defendant's life."</TE>
<TE>   The cases, including nine attempted murder charges, were
consolidated over defense objections. If convicted, Shabazz, 20,
faces life in prison without the possibility of parole.</TE>
<TE>   Yanes said photographic lineups were misleading because Shabazz
was the only dark-skinned male pictured.</TE>
<TE>   "He's jumping right out at you. Look at how much darker he is than
anyone else in there," he said, holding up the photos. Witnesses were
told the pictures may or may not contain the suspect, and that they
don't always reflect accurate complexion, Manzella said.</TE>
<TE>   Police planted a bullet casing in his client's car, Yanes argued.
He said officers changed their testimony about how long it took to
search his car. Officers originally said the search took 45 minutes,
and then later said two minutes, Yanes said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's got to bother you," Yanes told jurors. "You've got to open
your eyes--police like anybody else do things they shouldn't do."</TE>

<HD>Man Gets 87 Months for Quake-Related Fraud</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Jose businessman whose company provided engineering services to
Allstate Insurance Co. after the Northridge earthquake was sentenced
Monday to 87 months in prison and ordered to pay $1.17 million
restitution for four fraud schemes stemming from the 1994 disaster.</LD>
<LD>   LeAndre Drake Davis, 38, has been in custody since a Los Angeles
federal jury convicted him on 26 criminal counts in September 2000.
He will receive credit for time already served.</LD>
<LD>   Davis was found guilty of preparing false and misleading
engineering reports that Allstate used to settle claims with scores
of homeowners.</LD>
<TE>   In some cases, damaged houses were never inspected by a licensed
engineer. Davis also was found to have falsely represented himself as
a licensed architect.</TE>
<TE>   The jury also heard testimony from a South Los Angeles woman who
hired Davis' Shadowbrook Design Group to repair her home. After
taking $10,000 from her, Davis demolished the house and then
abandoned the project when the woman refused to pay more.</TE>
<TE>   He also was found guilty of padding and falsifying his bills to
Allstate and of defaulting on payments to subcontractors.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth scheme, Davis was convicted of defrauding Pine
Cobble Funding Corp., a Los Angeles company that specialized in
factoring accounts receivables. Davis sold Pine Cobble more than
$100,000 worth of receivables for work he claimed that he was doing
for Farmers Insurance Group and State Farm Insurance. Most of those
receivables were imaginary. The fraud contributed to Pine Cobble's
demise in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Davis apologized to U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder, but
said he was working under extreme stress after the quake.</TE>
<TE>   He said he has tried to redeem himself by voluntarily testifying
on behalf of homeowners who sued Allstate over their earthquake
settlements.</TE>

<HD>How UC Irvine Makes Offers They Don't Refuse</HD>
<DH>Employment: University Hills housing is the benefit that
lures top- notch faculty to the school and keeps them happily there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine's immaculately landscaped French Country and Spanish Colonial
homes could tempt almost any college professor to trade in the
textbooks for a briefcase and the lucrative corporate life.</LD>
<LD>   But what serious academic could afford to live in such Orange
County neighborhoods, where even a modest single-family home can run
half a million dollars?</LD>
<LD>   Actually, most any UC Irvine professor.</LD>
<TE>   UC Irvine's answer to runaway housing prices is University Hills,
the handsome, faculty-only master-planned community of homes that
rivals even the swankiest developments in town--and at half the
price.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since famed Yale deconstructionist J. Hillis Miller surprised
the academic world by bolting to UC Irvine 15 years ago--lured in
part by an affordable custom-built house in University Hills--the
college's faculty housing program has provided a huge edge in
recruiting. Few, if any, other universities can offer the majority of
their professors luxury homeownership at a deep discount.</TE>
<TE>   The latest batch of talent the upscale residential neighborhood
helped bring to UC Irvine includes an endowed department chairman
from New York University and a distinguished professor in the
sciences from UCLA. UC Irvine's dean of humanities also reports
negotiations with at least one Harvard professor and said a number of
junior faculty members have passed up offers from the University of
Chicago, the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and other top
schools largely so they can keep living in University Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "We have it all here," said Michael Szalay, an associate professor
of English who has turned down several higher-ranking schools.</TE>
<TE>   Szalay's fiancee just left a tenured teaching post in Ann Arbor
for a faculty job at UC Irvine, and last week the two bought a
four-bedroom Craftsman-style home in University Hills for $334,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We get to be academics at a great institution, but we also get to
live the lifestyle most of America dreams about," he said. "We've
escaped the garrets that academics in major urban areas are so often
forced to live in, and we get to have it all."</TE>
<TE>   "Garret" life has become reality for more academics as housing
prices in metropolitan areas soar. Big-city colleges and universities
report that recruits are turning down even the most lucrative job
offers because housing is so expensive.</TE>
<TE>   At Stanford University in upscale Palo Alto, a report from the
Provost's Committee on Faculty Housing in 2000 concludes that the
housing crunch was so dire that "Stanford's future is in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   "Chairs and deans have a very difficult time recruiting the best
faculty, given the local price of housing," the report states.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford has about 850 homes on campus that faculty are welcome to
buy, but they lack the price caps of UC Irvine's University Hills
homes. The homes typically cost more than $700,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people who are coming here can't afford to live here because
of the housing crisis," said Betty Oen, associate director for
faculty and staff housing at Stanford. "If they have offers from
outside universities, they are usually in places with much lower
housing costs."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford and other universities have helped faculty members fill
the gap by dipping into their endowments to fund cut-rate loans,
grants and other housing assistance for faculty members. Still, many
professors, especially junior faculty, can't afford to buy a house
anywhere near campus.</TE>
<TE>   "As housing prices go up, as they have been outrageously, it is
only going to get worse," said Courtney Caldwell, a Newport
Beach-based university housing consultant who helped UC Irvine set up
its program and now helps schools nationwide. "It has just gone
crazy," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Caldwell has been besieged by calls from desperate administrators
watching recruits slip from their grasp. Now many colleges want to
set up a program similar to the one UC Irvine established nearly 20
years ago, which will soon be complete with 1,100 homes, enough for
half the professors on campus. Schools are having varying degrees of
success.</TE>
<TE>   Big private schools such as NYU, Columbia, Harvard and Princeton
offer some faculty members affordable apartments in high-rent
neighborhoods. The perk has helped recruiting and also kept some of
the faculty stars from leaving, especially in areas where the rental
market has soared, Caldwell said.</TE>
<TE>   The most activity appears to be in California, where skyrocketing
land prices are particularly pressing.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine has built faculty housing over the years to keep
faculty and recruits from bolting as a result of sticker shock in
Malibu--and it is working on several dozen more units. UC Berkeley
and UC Santa Barbara have started buying apartment and condominium
buildings to help solve their housing problems. But there are far too
few units available to meet demand.</TE>
<TE>   Universities are being careful not to repeat mistakes made by
UCLA. The school built 86 homes--costing $550,000 apiece--about 10
miles south of campus in the early 1990s. Unlike UC Irvine, the
university didn't own the land and was unable to control the prices.
The homes ended up costing more than faculty members could afford,
and all but eight were sold to buyers not affiliated with the
university. The university lost about $7 million in the debacle.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Cal State campuses in Fullerton, Channel Islands and
Monterey Bay are taking care to avoid such missteps as they set out
to create a combined total of more than 1,000 units--most of them on
school-owned land.</TE>
<TE>   "We are losing highly prized faculty appointments," said Bill
Dickerson, executive director of the Cal State Fullerton Housing
Authority. "One top faculty recruit was offered an $80,000 salary and
turned it down to accept a position for $10,000 less in the Midwest
because the price of housing here was so high."</TE>
<TE>   Junior faculty members make far less. At UC Irvine, salaries for
professors in the humanities start in the high $40,000s.</TE>
<TE>   For Linda Vo, the ability to buy a four-bedroom, 2,200-square-foot
Spanish Colonial that is walking distance to campus and costs in the
low $300,000s played a big part in her decision to stay at UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   "I have friends in the Bay Area who know that for the rest of
their careers there they will have to rent," said Vo, an assistant
professor of Asian American studies. "Here I am--not only owning a
big house in Irvine, but I'm able to walk to work."</TE>
<TE>   Buying in University Hills is made easier through special
low-interest loans backed by UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   The catch in all this is that professors are limited to how much
profit they can make on their investment when they leave the
community and sell their house to another faculty member. The
university restricts the appreciation of homes on its land to match
the average percentage increase in faculty salaries. So, if the
average UC Irvine faculty pay raise is 3%, that's the maximum amount
a University Hills home can appreciate that year. That keeps faculty
members from cashing in on housing market booms.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of University Hills also admit there is a certain irony
in so many academics rushing to the suburban good life in a
master-planned community, the kind of place some intellectuals might
criticize as soulless and antiseptic.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes the beigeness of it all can be overwhelming," said Hugh
Roberts, an associate professor of English. "It's typical Irvine
suburbia, except your neighbors are all academics."</TE>
<TE>   That gives some professors pause before moving in. They might try
a stint at living in Hollywood or Silver Lake at first, but many who
swore they would never live in the place end up at University Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't help it," said Roberts, who bought a two-bedroom condo
for $156,000. "You think, 'I can actually buy this huge place for
this cheap?' "</TE>
<TE>   His colleague, Richard Kroll, said the place being filled with
academics does enhance the suburban experience. Kroll initially went
house shopping in Aliso Viejo but discovered few of his would-be
neighbors shared his interests in 18th century British literature.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like if I lived there I would be surrounded by people who
drive Camaros," he said. "Here, I've got a neighbor who is an art
historian and does classical archeology. We share a joint amateur
interest in Napoleon."</TE>

<HD>DMV to Expand Saturday Services</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To serve customers who cannot stop by a local Department of Motor
Vehicles office on weekdays, the DMV announced plans Monday to offer
Saturday services once a month at 158 of the agency's largest field
offices.</LD>
<LD>   But to keep DMV staffing costs down, the department will close
those same offices on Mondays preceding the Saturday openings.</LD>
<LD>   "We're pleased to make it easier for hard-working people to take
care of their business with us one Saturday per month," said DMV
Director Steven Gourley.</LD>
<TE>   The new schedule starts July 15, when most DMV offices will be
closed.</TE>
<TE>   On the following Tuesday through Friday, those DMV offices will be
open from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., adding an hour to each day.</TE>
<TE>   On July 20, the offices will be open from 8 a.m. to noon.</TE>
<TE>   The extra hour during those weekdays was added to give workers a
full 40-hour work week.</TE>
<TE>   That schedule will be repeated each month, usually on the third
Saturday of each month.</TE>
<TE>   "Our employees like it because they get a three-day weekend once a
month," said a DMV spokesman, Steve Haskins.</TE>
<TE>   Those few offices that already offer weekly Saturday hours will
adopt the new schedule, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons for the schedule change is that offices that
already offer Saturday hours have routinely been inundated with
customers from areas without Saturday services.</TE>
<TE>   There are 12 DMV offices statewide--mostly in small, outlying
communities such as Blythe and Needles--that will not be affected by
the new schedule.</TE>

<LD>Joshua Mendez, the boy who shot and killed his 13-year-old neighbor
four years ago, was released Monday from a boys' detention center in
Chino.</LD>
<LD>   Mendez, who was 11 at the time of the shooting, served four years
of a 14-year sentence for involuntary manslaughter.</LD>
<LD>   Mendez insisted he shot Larry Kiepert by accident. But prosecutors
said he aimed and pulled the trigger deliberately, killing Kiepert as
he played basketball in his backyard.</LD>
<TE>   Kiepert's mother, Liz, said she would have liked to see Mendez
serve his full sentence, including a 10-year enhancement for using a

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Dist. Atty. Paul Pfingst cleared San Diego police officers on Monday
of wrongdoing in two separate fatal shootings involving mental
patients.</LD>
<LD>   In one case, an officer shot a nude man three times after he held
a rock over his head in a threatening manner to avoid being arrested.
James Olson, 44, homeless and schizophrenic, had been spotted
masturbating in public.</LD>
<LD>   In the second case, seven officers shot a man 31 times after a
prolonged scuffle. Alejandro Jimenez, 24, was a block from a county
mental health facility when he broke the window at a Burger King and
then fought with officers.</LD>
<TE>   Pfingst's decision was immediately denounced by the American
Friends Service Committee, which monitors police conduct in San Diego
and has decried recent officer-involving shootings.</TE>
<TE>   "These were gross violations of human rights," said committee
director Christian Ramirez. "The San Diego Police Department needs to
do a whole lot more in teaching officers how to deal with the
mentally ill. As it is now, any mentally ill man or woman stands a
good chance of being shot."</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst, in his letter clearing the officers, noted that in both
cases, officers attempted to subdue the suspect with nonlethal means
such as pepper spray, martial arts weapons and batons and only fired
their guns when the suspect began wielding a potentially lethal
weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Alvin Gomez, attorney for Jimenez's widow, Maria, said the
officers "basically did not care about human life" and should have
realized they were dealing with a mentally ill person.</TE>
<TE>   "That area is notorious for the mentally ill," the attorney said.
"They leave [the] mental health [clinic] and hang around."</TE>
<TE>   Gomez has filed claims with the city government and the county
Department of Mental Health--a precursor to suing.</TE>
<TE>   In the first incident, Officer Bruce Debord responded to a call
March 12 about a naked man committing a lewd act in public. When
Olson attempted to walk away, the 10-year police veteran used pepper
spray and a carotid restraint hold on the suspect, according to
police.</TE>
<TE>   During the struggle, Olson grabbed a six-pound rock and advanced
toward two witnesses. After Olson refused orders to "drop the rock"
and "stop," Debord fired three times, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Ten days later, Jimenez was shot about 11 p.m. while allegedly
resisting arrest. Jimenez had been taken to the county mental health
facility by police after becoming violent and abusive with his
family; he had been suffering from mental problems for several years,
Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 39 shots were fired by seven officers. Jimenez was
struck 31 times in the chest, legs and left arm.</TE>
<TE>   Police alleged that Jimenez was swinging a shopping cart and was
"unfazed by continued use of pepper spray and a baton, and an attempt
by officers to use another shopping cart to knock him down."</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, the district attorney ruled that officers were
justified in using lethal force because they had reason to fear for
their lives and those of witnesses.</TE>

<LD>You have to applaud a panhandler whose performance consists of two
acts. My colleague Roy Rivenburg saw a gent with a hand-lettered sign
at an off-ramp of the 22 Freeway that read "Baby Needs New Shoes."
Then the guy flipped the sign to display the message: "Why Lie? I
Want a Beer!"</LD>
<LD>   More on the subject of clawing out a living: On a visit to Greece,
Tom and Barbara Blackman of Seal Beach came upon a town that appeared
to be hosting a convention of crustaceans (see photo).</LD>
<LD>   L.A. Insult of the Day: LeRoy Sweet of Tujunga noticed that a desk
calendar attributed a dumb statement about a basketball player to an
L.A. mayor, when the speaker was, in fact, the mayor of San Francisco
(see accompanying). Still is, as a matter of fact. Oh, yes: The name
of the desk calendar is: "The 365 Stupidest Things Ever Said."</LD>
<TE>   L.A. Insult (cont.): No real L.A. mayor merited a place in the
collection, a real injustice when you consider the possibilities. How
could anyone overlook Frank Shaw's dedication of the Beethoven statue
in Pershing Square 70 years ago when he praised L.A.'s "sympathy
orchestra"?</TE>
<TE>   Carrying on: Gordon and Patricia Bennett of Long Beach spotted a
sale of "lumbar," which they figured would come in handy, especially
to carry the items listed above it (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Vanity on wheels: In the latest issue of Westways magazine, actor
Don Snell recalls that when he moved out here and decided to get a
personalized plate, a friend suggested CO STAR because every other
actor in town wanted to be a superstar. Sure enough, the plate was
available and he grabbed it.</TE>
<TE>   A few other vanity plates mentioned in the magazine:</TE>
<TE>   * ONOIML8: owned by Linda Kendrick of Fullerton, who said: "I
travel L.A.'s freeways! Need I say more?"</TE>
<TE>   * 2XCONS: Gary Mineo and Linda Carroll of Murrieta, who wrote:
"The sun brought us from Connecticut."</TE>
<TE>   * ILIKELA: Michael Warrington of Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Just not enough to live in L.A., I guess.</TE>
<TE>   This game may go on four-ever: Lakers fans are still shooting me
suggested phrases to replace "threepeat" when the Lakers capture
another NBA title next year.</TE>
<TE>   They include: "Quadruple bypass" (Maureen McConaghy); "U-4-ia"
(Annie Eitman); and a phrase you may have uttered when you realized I
was doing another item on this subject: "Four Peat's Sake" (Pam

<HD>Quake Scientists Hopeful About Drilling Project on San
Andreas</HD>
<DH>Seismology: Even without a big temblor, 'we are assured of
having something to study,' expert says of 1.4-mile research hole.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARKFIELD, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Scientists from Stanford University and the U.S. Geological Survey
say they have calculated the ideal place to drill a 1.4-mile-deep
research hole along California's San Andreas fault.</LD>
<LD>   "We are in a transitional zone of the fault," Stanford
geophysicist Mark Zoback told reporters gathered Monday from
throughout the state. "The magnitude-6 earthquake of 1857 ruptured
south from here. It probably was a foreshock of the great magnitude-8
Fort Tejon earthquake of that same year."</LD>
<LD>   To the north of this site, "the fault is creeping in a fairly
constant movement," he said, "And right here is the transitional zone
with a spate of tiny quakes, magnitude-2s, occurring every year and a
half or so. So we are assured of having something to study, even if
the magnitude-6 earthquake we expect doesn't come soon."</LD>
<TE>   The $1.5-million drilling project is being financed by a
nine-nation consortium headquartered in Germany. The scientists hope
Congress will appropriate $30 million to make it the forerunner of a
hole 2.4 miles deep that actually will cross the fault at that depth.
The Bush administration has asked for that money.</TE>
<TE>   The drilling of the first hole, 8.5 inches wide at its farthest
depth, has been going on for three weeks at an average of seven feet
an hour.</TE>
<TE>   There are a few delays in the round-the-clock drilling so methane
and other gases can be measured. By noon Monday, the drill had
reached 3,985 feet.</TE>
<TE>   The hole should be completed by the end of the month. Then
instruments will be lowered into the pipe-encased hole, and years of
research into earthquake processes will begin.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists say they are certain their experiment will not trigger
an earthquake, but say it will record them with unprecedented
precision.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists gathered here were at pains to emphasize the limits
of their experiment. It will not, said the U.S. Geological Survey's
Stephen Hickman, allow anyone to precisely predict the next
magnitude-6 earthquake. But they hope to learn much more about what
causes a quake to begin, and perhaps more about what dictates its
magnitude.</TE>
<TE>   The drill holes will not be deep enough to allow a direct look at
a big quake, because these usually begin five to seven miles deep. It
would cost $150 million to drill a hole that deep, and scientists
don't think that kind of funding will be available any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   But the instruments in this hole will allow a direct look at
clusters of small quakes nearer the surface and, it is hoped, reveal
the "influences" of the deeper, bigger quakes on the fault close to
the surface.</TE>
<TE>   One theory the scientists hope to test is that fluids are rising
from the lower part of Earth's crust and the upper reaches of its
mantle, perhaps 20 miles down, somehow triggering quakes. Scientists
will measure fluid pressure and compare it with the timing of small
quakes.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike our surface explorations, we're going to be right in the
fault zone with our instruments, much better linked to the quake
process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Quake scientists have been in the Parkfield area, 190 miles north
of Los Angeles, for nearly 20 years, mainly because records show that
beginning in 1857, six earthquakes of magnitude 6 were centered near
here, occurring on average every 22 years.</TE>
<TE>   Based on this, in 1985 they predicted a 95% likelihood of another
occurring by the end of 1993. That hasn't happened.</TE>
<TE>   John Langbein, the USGS scientist in charge of Parkfield research
on the surface, said Monday that he has $2 million worth of
instruments waiting to record the big quake. One of them, a $200,000
Electronic Distance Meter, can measure the movement of the earth at
that moment within one millimeter.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists hope the instruments implanted in the drill hole will
be help them explain why it moved and how.</TE>

<HD>Angry Town Rejects Taint of Uranium</HD>
<DH>Health: Idyllwild residents worry that their drinking water
has been contaminated by naturally occurring radiation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SULLIVAN BRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>IDYLLWILD</DL>
<LD>When local officials announced plans to boost this mountain town's
drought-depleted water supply by tapping a well containing high
concentrations of naturally occurring uranium, residents flew into a
rage, circulating petitions in protest and packing water district
board meetings.</LD>
<LD>   Tempers got even hotter when residents discovered that millions of
gallons from the well had already been flowing into the system--for
more than a decade. Now, folks once fearful that radioactive water
might someday trickle from their faucets wonder if they have been
drinking it all along.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, General Manager Tom Lovejoy of the Idyllwild Water
District said in an interview that Idyllwild's 1,600 customers had
not consumed any dangerous water. He acknowledged that water from the
well--with uranium levels double the state limit--had routinely gone
into a ground-water recharge basin, but said it had never been piped
into the drinking system. He said surrounding wells remain within
health limits, and state officials confirm that Idyllwild's drinking
water remains safe.</LD>
<TE>   But the town's 3,000 residents, who treasure their pristine
scenery and the pure environment in the San Jacinto Mountains above
Palm Springs, are still suspicious about the district's actions, and
are angry to learn belatedly of the well's use.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel betrayed," said Marsha Bronson, one of two sisters who
have led the protest against use of the well. "It's a loss of
confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Idyllwild faces a serious and growing water crisis. Four
consecutive years of drought have reduced the town's ground-water
supply, forcing officials to impose increasingly stringent
restrictions on use. This year was the driest since 1929, yielding
just about a third of the average rainfall to date. As most of the
district's wells dwindled to a trickle, the uranium-laden well
remained strong, gushing more than twice as much water of most of the
others. So in May, Lovejoy proposed using the well, arguing that it
could augment the district's supply by 20%. By blending the water
with that from cleaner wells, he said, the district could dilute the
radioactivity to acceptable levels.</TE>
<TE>   Minute amounts of uranium are found naturally in most water
supplies, said Ron Churchill, a senior geologist with the California
Geological Survey's mineral hazards program. In granitic rock like
that in the mountains of Idyllwild, levels may be somewhat higher
than normal. Unlike enriched uranium used in nuclear weapons or
reactors, natural uranium is composed mainly of an isotope with low
radioactivity. Nonetheless, many scientists believe there is no
threshold below which radioactive material poses no risk.</TE>
<TE>   Most water supplies in the county contain one to two picocuries of
uranium per liter of water, experts say. The state Health
Department's acceptable maximum is 20 picocuries. At times over the
years, uranium levels in the Idyllwild well have reached 42
picocuries. But if the water is blended, officials say, the rate
could fall below the state maximum.</TE>
<TE>   The uranium levels in the Idyllwild well "are higher than we'd
like to see, but wouldn't constitute a public health emergency," said
Allan Hirsch, a spokesman for the state Office of Environmental
Health Hazard Assessment.</TE>
<TE>   In Idyllwild, however, the dam of public opinion had broken.
Residents said any more radiation in their drinking water would be
too much. "We talk about this in terms of small, minute amounts of
radiation, but its cumulative effect can be very destructive," said a
local activist, Jeff Smith, a former nuclear engineer.</TE>
<TE>   When Bronson and Bonnie Wolf, sisters who own the local Rustic
Theatre, gathered more than 300 signatures on a petition against the
blending plan, Lovejoy announced that he would abandon it and explore
ways to filter out the uranium instead. That's when local activists,
including Smith, took a closer look at water district pumping records
and found that millions of gallons from the well were already flowing
into the recharge basin. A water board meeting June 18 erupted into a
bitter exchange of shouts and recriminations.</TE>
<TE>   Lovejoy said the water had been diverted into Foster Lake and had
never entered the drinking water supply. But residents now worry that
water in Foster Lake will eventually make its way into surrounding
wells and leach into the aquifer. "They're using it to recharge
ground-water basins, and that means that water could potentially
enter the water table at some time in the future," said Jonathan
Parfrey, executive director of Physicians for Social Responsibility.
"Uranium has a half-life of 4.5 million years, so it's not like
you're getting rid of the problem."</TE>
<TE>   As residents worry about a loss of water quality, district
officials worry about the loss of their most productive water source.
On Monday, the district imposed its most stringent level of water
restriction, banning all outdoor irrigation and sharply raising
rates.</TE>
<TE>   But using water from the well is no longer an option, officials
concede. "It would fly in the face of public opinion," said Mel
Goldfarb, a member of the Idyllwild Water District board. "So we're
really between a rock and a hard place. We can't use the well that
would help us tremendously."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in this town where visitors stop by the roadside to
fill jugs with fresh spring water, residents say the controversy has
left a bitter taste. "People come to Idyllwild to live and visit
because of our clean air," Bronson said, "and they expect clean
water."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Unified Opens 1st Valley School in 31 Years</HD>
<DH>Education: Van Nuys campus will draw pupils from six
elementaries, but crowding remains a problem in the district.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Like many of the 400 other children on the playground of the Columbus
Avenue Elementary School in Van Nuys on Monday, 7-year-old Erick
Monterrozo had a look of uncertainty.</LD>
<LD>   Would he make new friends? Was he going to like his new teacher?</LD>
<LD>   This was not just the first day of school for the children. It was
the first day for the new school--the first built by the Los Angeles
Unified School District in the San Fernando Valley in 31 years.</LD>
<TE>   The opening comes not a moment too soon as the district grapples
with overcrowding in working-class neighborhoods like those in the
East Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The year-round kindergarten-through-fifth-grade campus at Columbus
Avenue and Vanowen Street will draw 686 students from six area
schools, with 400 on campus at any one time.</TE>
<TE>   The school also will keep 120 children in their own neighborhood,
instead of busing them as far away as Canoga Park.</TE>
<TE>   However, the opening of Columbus won't end year-round calendars in
surrounding schools, because of the enrollment crush throughout the
district.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still a lot to do for this area," said school board
member Julie Korenstein, whose district includes Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   Starting with bond money from 1997, the school district plans to
build or upgrade 80 schools over the next four years. Twelve new
schools and various expansions are planned for the East Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Another bond measure to build schools will be placed on a November
ballot, but the two measures combined won't eliminate year-round
schedules, district officials say.</TE>
<TE>   If voters approve the new bond measure, "it will get kids off the
buses," said Gordon Wholers, chief of staff for Supt. Roy Romer.</TE>
<TE>   The district has 17,000 students who are bused from overcrowded
neighborhood schools.</TE>
<TE>   Wholers said the East Valley has overcrowding problems that rival
those found in Hollywood, East Los Angeles, southeast Los Angeles
County and the central Los Angeles area, where Belmont/Hollywood
Primary Center No. 3, across from MacArthur Park, also opened Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The new primary center will serve 352 students in kindergarten
through first grade on a year-round schedule. Altogether, the
district has opened 13 primary centers, which are usually built on 1
1/2-acre sites for children in kindergarten up to third grade.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the last new campus to open in the Los Angeles
district was Gratts Elementary School near downtown Los Angeles in
1996. A year later, Van Gogh Street Elementary in Granada Hills was
rebuilt on the same site because of damage from the 1994 Northridge
earthquake. The last school built in the Valley was Kennedy High
School in Granada Hills, which opened in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Columbus is the 19th L.A. Unified school opened in the last 19
years, according to a district report that tracked school openings
since 1983. Nine primary centers have been built in that time.</TE>
<TE>   Construction of Columbus was completed on time and $800,000 under
the projected $12.4-million cost. Located across from Valley
Presbyterian Hospital, the school took two years to build on land
already owned by the district.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, second-grader Erick Monterrozo was the first to arrive,
clutching his father's hand as they walked one block from their home.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I don't have to be late for work," said his father, Johnny
Monterrozo, adding that it used to take 20 minutes to walk Erick to
Valerio Street Elementary.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to 26 classrooms, Columbus has a library, a lunch
shelter, and a playground with basketball hoops, a stickball wall,
volleyball nets and a grassy corner so green and lush that mushrooms
were sprouting from it.</TE>
<TE>   Tanya Casillas, 10, finished fourth grade less than two weeks ago
at Stonehurst Avenue Elementary in Sun Valley, but began fifth grade
Monday morning at Columbus. Because the schools are on different
schedules, Tanya's summer vacation was cut short, but she didn't seem
to mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I woke up at 7 a.m. instead of 6," she said, smiling because she
no longer has to take a bus to Sun Valley every morning.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing together children from a slew of schools may prove a
challenge for the school's administrators and teachers, who were
recruited from L.A. Unified as well as other local school districts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be difficult," said Principal Barbara Thibodeau,
who was principal at nearby Chandler Elementary for the last 10
years. "But everyone's starting with a clean slate."</TE>

<HD>The Next Straw</HD>
<DH>Darryl Strawberry Jr. is taking a different path than his
father</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He prefers basketball, not baseball. That's the first good sign. In
this comparison, the more differences the better.</LD>
<LD>   He is at the age when it's all about the future, yet his name
can't help but bring up memories of past failures.</LD>
<LD>   He is Darryl Strawberry. Junior.</LD>
<TE>   As if the name doesn't carry enough of a burden on its own, the
suffix seems to bring in the unwanted weight of others.</TE>
<TE>   Type Darryl Strawberry Jr. into Google's Internet search engine
and up pops a string of links to stories about the drug-related woes
of his father and Robert Downey Jr. Like that's fair.</TE>
<TE>   So we'll honor another difference and call Darryl Jr. by the name
most people use: "D.J." That's the name that brings up stories about
success (such as his Santa Ana Mater Dei High team's CIF Southern
Section divisional championship) or potential (he is rated among the
top 10 prep shooting guards in the West).</TE>
<TE>   He is 17 and inherited more than just the fruit-flavored last
name. He has a body tailor-made for athletics. It's 6 feet 4 now,
with plenty of muscle to come and, he is told, three more inches.</TE>
<TE>   "He's thin and strong," says his mother, a description we used to
always hear about his father.</TE>
<TE>   And if the posture looks the same--hands on his waists, shoulders
forward--the circumstances couldn't be any more different.</TE>
<TE>   A recent day found D.J. playing ball at the Veterans Sports
Complex in Carson. One of his teammates was Cuttino Mobley of the
Houston Rockets. Utah Jazz guard Bryon Russell and former Arizona
Wildcat Miles Simon also shared the court at different times.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the country, Darryl Strawberry Sr. was in the
Gainesville (Fla.) Correctional Institution, serving an 18-month
sentence for violating terms of his probation for 1999 cocaine
possession charges. A jail cell almost seemed like an inevitable
destination for Strawberry after drugs and alcohol took the former
No. 1 draft pick of the New York Mets off the path to greatness and
sent his life plunging. Some have suggested he might even be better
off in prison; it might be the only place to keep him from his
self-destructive ways.</TE>
<TE>   Strawberry, 40, is past the point where he can expect to sign
another lucrative contract to hit baseballs a long distance.</TE>
<TE>   For D.J., that basketball he handles so easily can still take him
places. Maryland, the defending NCAA champion, is interested in him
as he prepares for his senior year. He's also looking at Kansas and
California.</TE>
<TE>   As you might imagine, baseball had been a part of his life. "Since
I was born," he said. He remembers spending time on the field for
family days, wearing the miniature uniforms, the works.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I grew up with, was baseball," he says. "Then I got
into basketball when I was around 7."</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Lisa Strawberry, signed him up at a park league one
off-season and he was hooked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an up-and-down, fast-paced game," D.J. says. "I love it.
Baseball's kind of boring."</TE>
<TE>   He's gifted at baseball, but "he won't do it," Lisa Strawberry
says.</TE>
<TE>   "If he put as much time and effort into baseball as basketball,
he'd be--not like his dad--but he'd be a good player."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he could have hit more than the 335 home runs his father hit
in the major leagues. Maybe he never could have lived up to the
expectations created by the name.</TE>
<TE>   The comparisons are hard enough as it is. Opposing fans serenade
him with the "Daaa-rryl, Daaa-rryl" chant. He can't avoid the news
reports.</TE>
<TE>   For Lisa Strawberry, who also had a daughter during her nine-year
marriage to Darryl that ended in 1993, the legacy of that last name
also means counseling the children through their father's failures.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard for them," she says. "But it's something that
they're used to. They have a tough skin. They can deal with life.
It's unfortunate, but it's something that [D.J.] has to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   She tells him that "He's not responsible for his dad. He's his own
individual."</TE>
<TE>   D.J. still talks to his father, but he hasn't seen him for a
couple of years and doesn't sound ready to head down to Florida for
visiting hours any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts me sometimes, but I have to realize that what I have to
do is stay up on school and basketball and whatever I'm going to do
to succeed in life," he says about his father's problems.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me not want to be like him. It makes me want to be a
better person than he was, to go farther. If he would have just
stayed clean, he would have been a Hall of Famer, maybe. It gives me
the drive to not do drugs, keep clean and keep going for all my
goals."</TE>
<TE>   D.J. is a good kid; his mother's only complaint is that he doesn't
take out the trash as frequently as she'd like. All she wants for him
is to get an education and lead a productive life.</TE>
<TE>   The word that keeps coming up to describe D.J. is "quiet."</TE>
<TE>   Even his game can be quiet. Amid the noise in the Veterans gym
(much of it coming from Mobley), Strawberry fades into the background
like the stored bleacher seats.</TE>
<TE>   "He's down to earth, but man, he's going to be phenomenal," says
DeAnthony Langston, his AAU coach.</TE>
<TE>   As the youngest player on the court during these summer pickup
games, "You don't have to try to dominate the game," Strawberry says.
"You can sit back and enjoy the game. It's just fun. They teach you
things that you wouldn't learn as just a high school player. It's fun
to come out here with NBA players and learn, have a good time."</TE>
<TE>   Strawberry wishes he could play in the Nike Real Run, a five-week
summer pro league Langston runs featuring the likes of Paul Pierce
and Baron Davis that starts at Veterans Sports Complex this Friday,
but it would cost him his eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   So he settles for playing against the pros in the mornings.</TE>
<TE>   When he does get the ball, he knows what to do with it. He handles
the ball smoothly. He knocks down a turnaround jumper, which seems to
inspire him to come up with a steal on defense and convert it into a
layup.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, as Mobley keeps D.J. on the court to give him some tips
about keeping defenders off-balance, one of the players comes up to
Langston and says, "Strawberry is going to be the Bobby Jones of this
year. Your boy is putting in work."</TE>
<TE>   Jones was a Southern Section player of the year at Long Beach Poly
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Langston first saw Strawberry play at Michael Jordan's summer
camp.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like, 'That's Darryl Strawberry's kid? You've got to be
kidding me. Darryl Strawberry's kid can play basketball,' " Langston
said.</TE>
<TE>   Langston's California select team played in the Memorial Day
Classic in Indianapolis last year, and Strawberry played well in a
field that included Bracey Wright of Texas, and Syracuse-bound
Carmelo Anthony of Oak Hill Academy, who has held his own against
prep superstar LeBron James in head-to-head competition.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of good players out there," Strawberry says.
"That's when I knew all these players are ranked ahead of me, but I
still can compete with them."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Bossi, who filed a report for an Internet scouting service,
described Strawberry as "a very well mannered and quiet kid with a
game that is going to merit some serious recognition in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Once again, the future is in Darryl Strawberry's hands. It's back
to talent and potential as good things, not talent preceded by "what
a waste of..." and potential unfulfilled.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing hanging in D.J.'s room is a framed, autographed red
Chicago Bulls Michael Jordan jersey. Can Strawberry picture that
name, with all of those letters and all that history, on an NBA
jersey?</TE>
<TE>   "Every day," he says, smiling. "I hope I can make it."</TE>
<TE>   Life kept giving his father chances, and he squandered them. Maybe
this time, all this Darryl Strawberry needs is one.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just when Pedro Martinez is pitching consistently like an All-Star,
he's decided not to be one.</LD>
<LD>   He struck out 14 in eight innings as the Boston Red Sox beat the
Toronto Blue Jays, 4-0, Monday night at Boston. Then he said being
ready to help his team in the second half of the season is more
important than pitching for the American League All-Stars, so he
declined the invitation.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a perfect time for me to take a little break and make sure I
continue to be the way I have," he said, "because I wouldn't trade a
World Series for an All-Star."</LD>
<TE>   Boston's second win in nine games moved it within 1 1/2 games of
the first-place New York Yankees in the AL East.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox finally got production from Tony Clark, who has been
in a season-long slump. He had a double and single and drove in two
runs off Steve Parris (0-2).</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not naive enough to think the light gets turned off and
turned on that easily," said Clark, signed as a free agent after
seven seasons with Detroit. "It was one night where I had some at
bats where the balls found some holes."</TE>
<TE>   He provided more than enough offense for Martinez (10-2), who
threw 117 pitches. Alan Embree pitched a perfect ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez got five consecutive outs on strikeouts when he struck
out the side in the fifth and fanned the first two batters in the
sixth.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up seven hits and used strikeouts to get out of three of
the four innings in which Toronto put men in scoring position.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the best I've ever seen him," Shannon Stewart said. "I've
always been able to pick up his ball. Tonight, he was lights out."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 7, Kansas City 0--Jamie Moyer ran his string of shutout
innings to 23 by pitching a five-hitter as the Mariners won at
Seattle. Moyer (8-3) gave up three doubles, didn't walk a batter and
struck out three in lowering his earned-run average to 3.02.</TE>
<TE>   Bret Boone and Edgar Martinez homered for the Mariners and Ichiro
Suzuki, who went three for four, took over the major league batting
lead from Kansas City's Mike Sweeney, who was one for four. Suzuki is
hitting .364 and Sweeney .360.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 5, Oakland 4--Doug Mientkiewicz hit a two-run double in
the seventh inning to help the Twins win at Oakland. John Mabry hit a
three-run homer for the Athletics and he almost hit a grand slam in
the third, but center fielder Torii Hunter robbed him with a
spectacular leaping catch.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Guardado pitched the ninth for his 25th save.</TE>

<HD>Deals Don't Frighten Him</HD>

<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In his first trade as the Angels' general manager, Bill Stoneman sent
outfielder Jim Edmonds to St. Louis for pitcher Kent Bottenfield and
second baseman Adam Kennedy.</LD>
<LD>   The Cardinals give thanks daily.</LD>
<LD>   In the three years since then, Stoneman has not made another
high-risk trade. He has worked the waiver wire shrewdly, and invested
money and patience in beefing up the Angels' scouting and minor
league operations, with the impressive debut of pitcher John Lackey
as the latest reward.</LD>
<TE>   But, since the Edmonds trade backfired, has Stoneman become too
cautious to pull the trigger on another trade, one that might require
giving up top prospects?</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels battle the Seattle Mariners and Oakland Athletics in
the American League West, the track records of Seattle's Pat Gillick
and Oakland's Billy Beane suggest the rival general managers won't
hesitate to deal. Stoneman's record suggests he might.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman denied that the Edmonds trade has made him too cautious,
offering a startling assessment of the trade talks surrounding
Edmonds.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is, there wasn't a market for him," Stoneman said.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonds' talent was undisputed, but his trade value apparently had
been deflated by repeated criticism by Angel teammates and
management, and by a string of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been relatively healthy in St. Louis, and I'm happy for
him," Stoneman said. "He wasn't healthy here.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed a second baseman, and we thought we had a pitcher who
could help us--not in the long term but in the short term--but he
didn't."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels would like to trade for pitching help, probably a
hard-throwing reliever. If he cannot make that trade, Stoneman does
not believe the Angels are doomed.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have any glaring weaknesses where you say, if they don't
plug this hole, they've got no chance," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And, although fans might salivate over the thought of Cleveland's
Jim Thome playing first base in Anaheim, the Angels are not focused
on trading to improve an offense that has scored more runs than every
other major league team, save the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to find fault with what our offense has done," Manager
Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there something that's going to make us that much better?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Garret Anderson's selection as an All-Star gives the
Angels two All-Stars from the 1990 draft, impressive in itself and
extraordinary from a draft in which the Angels did not have a
first-round pick. Bob Fontaine, then the Angels' scouting director,
selected Anderson from Granada Hills Kennedy High in the fourth round
and catcher-turned-closer Troy Percival from UC Riverside in the
sixth round. The second-round pick that year, pitcher Phil Leftwich,
beat Anderson and Percival to Anaheim but won just nine games in 34
starts.</TE>

<HD>Sutton Makes Return After Major Surgery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hall of Fame pitcher Don Sutton returned to work as an Atlanta Brave
broadcaster Monday, less than a month after he had surgery to remove
a cancerous kidney.</LD>
<LD>   A growth was discovered during routine tests in May, and doctors
later discovered it was malignant. Sutton was supposed to miss four
to six weeks but returned earlier than expected because his recovery
was going so well.</LD>
<LD>   "Having an organ removed is a major surgery," he said before
Atlanta played the Montreal Expos. "I was prepared to hurt for a long
time, but I haven't. In my mind, that in and of itself is a miracle."</LD>
<TE>   Sutton won 324 games in his 23-year career, mostly with the
Dodgers, and he was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1998. The
four-time All-Star retired in 1988 and joined Atlanta's broadcast
team a year later.</TE>
<TE>   He arrived in the booth about three hours before Monday's game,
exchanging handshakes and hugs with the TBS production crew. He
rejoined regular partner Pete Van Wieren.</TE>
<TE>   Former Atlanta second baseman Mark Lemke filled in for Sutton on
the radio broadcasts, and Joe Simpson was the regular TV analyst.
Simpson rejoined regular partner Skip Caray in the radio booth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mitch Williams, who struggled with his control as a reliever for
the Philadelphia Phillies almost a decade ago, became manager of the
minor league Atlantic City Surf. He replaced former Cincinnati
infielder Tommy Helms, who resigned after two seasons under what
General Manager Mario Perrucci called a mutual agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Williams joined the Surf, of the independent Atlantic League, last
spring as pitching coach and has pitched occasionally for the team.</TE>
<TE>   In 11 appearances last year, he was 4-3 with a 3.85 earned-run
average. On June 19, he picked up a victory, giving up five hits in a
five-inning appearance against the Newark Bears. He probably won't
pitch anymore now that he is the manager, team spokesman Chuck Betson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Helms, 61, a former National League rookie of the year with the
Reds, will take a front-office job, advising the team on baseball
operations and evaluating talent, Perrucci said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Attendance for interleague games was up almost 20% from levels for
in-league contests.</TE>
<TE>   Figures released by the commissioner's office showed total
attendance of 8,022,524 for 251 games between the two leagues, an
average of 31,962 per game and 19.7% higher than the season average
of 26,705 for non-interleague games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Frank Castillo dropped his appeal of a five-game suspension and
isn't expected to miss a start for the Boston Red Sox. Castillo
pitched Sunday before the Red Sox began a four-day, five-game series
Monday night against Toronto.... Infielder Ricky Gutierrez was
activated off the disabled list after going three for six for the
Cleveland Indians in an exhibition win over their triple-A affiliate
at Buffalo, N.Y. Monday's game was Gutierrez's first appearance since
being put on the disabled list on June 16 because of a strained
groin.</TE>

<LD>Woody Paige of the Denver Post commenting on the exits of the 14
American men in singles at Wimbledon: "U-S-A became U-S Adieu, U-S
Arrivederci, U-S Aloha, U-S Cheerio, U-S-Outtahere ...</LD>
<LD>   "I think I can speak for all American men. We are appalled,
ashamed and feeling angst for our own kind. We didn't get anybody in
the round of 16 at the most important tennis tournament in the world
...</LD>
<LD>   "We're a bunch of ground-stroking, second-serving,
throat-grabbing, thumb-sucking tennis wimps."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who had the higher scoring average, Elgin Baylor or
Jerry West?</TE>
<TE>   Listen up: In an interview with Jeff D'Alessio of Florida Today,
billionaire owner Mark Cuban of the Dallas Mavericks was asked to
give his best business tip: "If you own a stock that doesn't pay
dividends, sell it immediately. If you want to start a business,
don't raise money. Use your blood, sweat and brains instead."</TE>
<TE>   Easier task: Steve Rosenbloom in the Chicago Tribune: "The NBA
will bring in instant replay next season. Commissioner David Stern
wants to take 'referees off the hook' and let them get back to
concentrating on not calling fouls on superstars."</TE>
<TE>   Offended: Lennox Lewis is no fan of "Rocky" films, saying: "They
project an image that all boxers are like duh and dose, like we are
all stupid. Most of us are very intelligent."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever you say, big fella.</TE>
<TE>   Gentle reminder: During the NBA draft show on TNT, analysts Kenny
Smith and Charles Barkley suggested Chinese center Yao Ming's
inability to understand English will be a problem for the Houston
Rockets, especially at the end of games.</TE>
<TE>   Said Stern: "You know, when Kenny and Charles first came into the
league, they didn't speak English, either."</TE>
<TE>   Motivation: "Jeff Gordon hasn't won a race since Sept. 30 but
insists his impending divorce has nothing too with his slump," says
Michael Ventre of MSNBC.com.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet in an effort to recapture his old form, Gordon is considering
a technique whereby he imagines his wife sitting in the passenger
seat, insisting he stop for directions."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1933, New York Giant pitchers Carl
Hubbell (18) and Roy Parmelee (nine) combined for 27 scoreless
innings in a doubleheader shutout of the St. Louis Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   Dollar-wise: Lesley Visser was billed as the Occidental Tourist a
year and a half ago, when she visited Shanghai and interviewed Yao
Ming for HBO's "Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel."</TE>
<TE>   "He only spoke to me once in English. The rest was through a
translator," Visser said. "I said to him, 'You stand to earn great
wealth. How do you think you'll handle it?' He said--and this was the
only time he spoke English to me--I'll get used to it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Baylor, barely, at 27.4 points to West's 27.0.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Yankee owner George Steinbrenner said he was wrong to
fire Yogi Berra, always a fan favorite, as manager early in the 1985
season.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a mistake....It was poor judgment," he said. "I don't
pretend to be perfect and I'm not. You could sit and write a huge
volume about the mistakes I made."</TE>

<LD>   What: "The Season: Iowa Wrestling"</LD>
<TE>   Where: ESPN, tonight, 6</TE>
<TE>   This episode of the "The Season," ESPN's popular series that takes
viewers behind the scenes as it follows a team through a season, is
the first of two one-hour shows focusing on wrestling at the
University of Iowa. The second part will be shown a week from
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary, narrated by actor Dylan McDermott, provides an
up-close look at a college sport that demands so much, yet returns so
little. Viewers will get a first-hand look at the raw emotion
wrestlers go through after a devastating loss. However, after a win,
these wrestlers show little emotion. That's because winning is
expected at Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   The school enjoyed one of the sport's all-time dynasties when Dan
Gable was coaching there. But Gable retired after the 1997 season,
and now, five years later, the Hawkeyes are not as dominating as they
used to be, when they won 20 national titles in 27 seasons. Now,
under Coach Jim Zalesky, wins are not routine.</TE>
<TE>   A particularly tough loss featured in tonight's show comes at the
hands of rival Iowa State. The Cyclones are led by the phenomenal
Cael Sanderson, who goes into the meeting with Iowa with a win streak
of 133.</TE>
<TE>   The show takes a close look at a number of the Hawkeyes. Some,
such as senior Mike Zadick of Great Falls, Mont., are living up to
expectations. Others, such as fifth-year senior Josh Budke of Cedar
Falls, Iowa, are not.</TE>
<TE>   Zadick was groomed by his father Bob to be a wrestler at Iowa, as
was an older brother.</TE>
<TE>   Of Mike, Bob Zadick says, "I was very tough on [him]. People
complained about it.... I've had people accuse me of child abuse and
threaten to turn me in. [Wrestling] was really important--next to
family and church and God, it was important. It was more important to
me than to see him be an A student."</TE>
<TE>   Budke, of his decision to endure another year in a final attempt
to crack the starting lineup, says, "When I was a little kid my dad
and I would come to watch Iowa wrestling....</TE>
<TE>   "Wrestling for Iowa was a dream of mine.... There's a lot of
nights I don't sleep well, just because of the pain and frustration
and the pain that comes along with being on the sidelines watching.</TE>
<TE>   "When I have my own son, I'd probably push him in another
direction."</TE>

<HD>Nomo a Two-Way Player in Victory</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: He pitches eight scoreless innings and has
run-scoring double off Johnson in 4-0 win over Diamondbacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>PHOENIX -- Dodger pitcher Hideo Nomo's fifth-inning swing against
Arizona left-hander Randy Johnson Monday night was so ugly it had a
better chance of cracking a mirror than a bat.</LD>
<LD>   Nomo bailed out so much he needed a life preserver--his left foot,
as Manager Jim Tracy joked, landed closer to third-base coach Glenn
Hoffman than the catcher. He seemed to start his swing as the ball
left Johnson's hand. Everything a hitter could do wrong, Nomo did.
Yet, everything turned out right.</LD>
<LD>   A .142 lifetime hitter with one hit in 25 previous at-bats this
season, Nomo laced an RBI double over left fielder Luis Gonzalez's
head to break a scoreless tie and push the Dodgers on their way to a
4-0 victory over the Diamondbacks before 36,632 in Bank One Ballpark.</LD>
<TE>   Nomo also tossed one of his best games of the season, blanking
Arizona on five hits in eight innings and striking out seven to move
the first-place Dodgers 2 1/2 games ahead of the Diamondbacks in the
National League West.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think [Dodger batting instructor] Jack Clark will be
incorporating that swing with our hitters, and I would strongly
suggest that he didn't," Tracy said of Nomo's rare hit. "But you know
what? Strange things happen sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   Another oddity Monday night: For the first time in 17 starts this
season, Nomo, who ranks third in the NL with 57 walks, did not walk a
batter. Nomo improved to 9-5 and hasn't lost since an 11-3 defeat at
Florida on May 12. He is 7-0 with a 2.76 earned-run average in his
last nine starts.</TE>
<TE>   "When you face a guy like Randy Johnson, you need a step-up
performance, and what a step up that was for Nomo to throw eight
innings of shutout ball," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   "When he's throwing strikes early in the count, the at-bat
changes. They're immediately defending the split-fingered fastball."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona put a scare into the Dodgers in the ninth when Junior
Spivey singled off reliever Paul Quantrill and Gonzalez walked.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy, taking no chances, summoned closer Eric Gagne, who struck
out Greg Colbrunn with a 97-mph fastball and got Steve Finley to tap
to the mound.</TE>
<TE>   Damian Miller followed with a long fly ball to right-center field,
but Brian Jordan leaped at the wall for the game-ending catch, making
Gagne the fastest pitcher in major league history to reach 30 saves.
Gagne accomplished the feat in 82 games, beating the 83-game mark
shared by Bobby Thigpen (1990) of the White Sox and Lee Smith (1993)
of the Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   "He's obviously the best closer in baseball," Tracy said. "Case
closed."</TE>
<TE>   The victory snapped Johnson's five-game win streak against the
Dodgers, dating to July 24, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (12-3) was dominant through four innings, giving up two
infield singles, before Adrian Beltre singled with one out in the
fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Reboulet popped to third for the second out, and Nomo, who
struck out on a feeble swing in the third inning, worked the count
full. If Nomo's RBI double against Colorado last Wednesday was, as he
put it, "an accident," what happened next was a six-car freeway
pileup.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo tore into a Johnson fastball, lining it over Gonzalez's head
to score Beltre from first and leave Johnson stunned and cursing on
the mound.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo had a similar reaction, except for the cursing.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unbelievable," Nomo said through an interpreter. "I was
shocked."</TE>
<TE>   Cesar Izturis grounded a single up the middle, but Nomo looked so
disoriented he held at second until the ball skipped by him. But on a
night Nomo could do no wrong, Finley failed to field the ball cleanly
in center, giving Nomo enough time to score for a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Lo Duca doubled and scored on Marquis Grissom's two-out RBI
single in the sixth, and after two errors put Hiram Bocachica on
third in the seventh, Lo Duca hit a two-out RBI single to center for
a 4-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo's only real trouble came in the fourth, when the Diamondbacks
put runners on first and third with one out. Finley hit a high
chopper up the middle, but second baseman Reboulet, making only his
fourth start of the season, fielded the ball and quickly flipped to
Izturis, whose strong relay to first completed the inning-ending
double play.</TE>
<TE>   "You need every guy on the club to win games, and Reboulet
starting that double play was huge," Tracy said. "If that ball goes
through, it could have changed the complexion of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Like Nomo's hit did in the fifth.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Lo Duca Stays Silent on Snub</HD>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Though he wouldn't come out and say it, one could surmise that Paul
Lo Duca felt snubbed by Arizona Manager Bob Brenly, who did not pick
the Dodger catcher as an All-Star.</LD>
<LD>   Asked before Monday's game if he could answer a few questions, Lo
Duca said, "Not if they're about the All-Star game."</LD>
<LD>   Brenly, the National League manager, chose his own catcher, Damian
Miller, and San Francisco's Benito Santiago to back up starter Mike
Piazza of the New York Mets.</LD>
<TE>   Lo Duca began Monday night's game with a .318 average, four
homers, 21 doubles, 36 runs batted in, 35 runs and a .372 on-base
percentage.</TE>
<TE>   He was batting .392 with runners in scoring position and had only
12 strikeouts in 277 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   Miller was batting .275 with nine homers, 36 RBIs, 31 runs and a
.352 on-base percentage. He was hitting .238 with runners in scoring
position and had 62 strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   Santiago was hitting .273 with seven homers, 38 RBIs, 28 runs, a
.315 on-base percentage and a .260 mark with runners in scoring
position.</TE>
<TE>   "He's taken for granted sometimes," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said
of Lo Duca.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not seen enough to be totally appreciated for the kind of
player he is."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are in town to play the Diamondbacks, but Brenly did
not feel compelled to issue an explanation or apology to Lo Duca.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel it's necessary [to talk to Lo Duca]," Brenly said.
"If our paths should cross, I'm not going to try to avoid him. Paul
Lo Duca is having a great year, no question about it. So is Larry
Walker. So is Brian Giles. I can go on and on."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca was able to take out some of his frustration with a double
and a run-scoring single Monday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All it took for Shawn Green to realize he couldn't play Monday
night was a few light batting-practice swings. While his jammed left
thumb, an injury suffered during an outfield collision with Dave
Roberts on Saturday, felt better, it was not sound enough to face
Arizona left-hander Randy Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "I can grip the bat, I just can't take an aggressive swing," Green
said. "I noticed I didn't want to swing at certain pitches because
the angle put pressure on it."</TE>
<TE>   Green, who sat out consecutive games Sunday and Monday for the
first time as a Dodger, is not scheduled to undergo an X-ray or MRI
test, and he's confident he'll return tonight or Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I've broken my left thumb twice and my right thumb once, so I
know the difference," Green said. "If it improves as much [today] as
it did [Monday], I'm hoping to play [tonight]. I hate missing any
games, especially in a big series like this."</TE>

<HD>Ducks Sow Their Oates</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Anaheim signs veteran center, who will be 40 next
month, in bid to improve power play.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks got a little bit older Monday ... and added
experience ... and gained some playoff savvy ... and, they hope,
became better too.</LD>
<LD>   All of which depends on whether center Adam Oates can hold off the
aging process a little bit longer. Oates, a five-time NHL all-star,
signed a one-year deal with the Ducks, plus a club option, that could
pay him $7 million.</LD>
<LD>   The club option becomes Oates' option if he and the team reach
certain incentive levels, among them Oates scoring 60 or more points
and the Ducks making the playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   The upside for the Ducks is, they acquired one of the top
playmakers in NHL history. Oates can take command of their woeful
power play, make crisp passes to Paul Kariya, and he has a bagful of
playoff experience.</TE>
<TE>   "To get a chance to play with Paul Kariya is a big reason I went
with the Ducks," Oates said. "He's like Brett Hull with speed. I
played the best hockey of my career with Hull."</TE>
<TE>   That was then, however--Oates was in his 20s--and this is now.</TE>
<TE>   Oates will turn 40 in August and the Ducks have been down this
road before, with Jari Kurri, Tomas Sandstrom and German Titov. But
Oates is coming off an 11-goal, 75-point season, a season the Ducks
would be happy to see him duplicate.</TE>
<TE>   "He may be on the downside [of his career] but he will be one of
the big point-getters on the team," General Manager Bryan Murray
said. "He is still a capable player and a smart player. I think
everyone saw with guys like [Carolina's] Ron Francis and [Montreal's]
Doug Gilmore that experience can make a huge difference on a hockey
team. I have no problems with his age."</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia Flyers apparently did. They acquired him from
Washington in March, giving up first-,second-, and third-round draft
picks, as well as their top goalie prospect. Yet, the Flyers walked
away from Oates after his poor playoff performance--no goals and only
two assists in five playoff games--as Ottawa eliminated the Flyers in
the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Oates' final days in Washington were not pleasant. He asked to be
traded, then backed off that demand. He was stripped of his role as
team captain last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Oates' numbers last season, which included a league-high 64
assists, could help the Ducks solve a couple of festering problems.
They ranked last in the NHL on the power play at 11.5% and only
Columbus scored fewer goals.</TE>
<TE>   Oates, although he has slowed, is still adept at running the power
play. He ranked third in the NHL with 26 power-play assists.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the areas where he can help us most," Murray said.
"He passes the puck well, sees the ice and, most importantly, he is a
patient player. He will hold the puck and allow guys to get into
position."</TE>
<TE>   He is also capable of getting the puck to Kariya, who is coming
off the worst full season of his career--32 goals, 57 points. Oates
ranks eighth on the NHL's all-time list in assists with 1,027 while
playing for Detroit, St. Louis, Washington and Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, though, have brought in graying NHL greats before. In
1996, they signed Kurri, who was 36, to play between Kariya and Teemu
Selanne. He finished the season with only 22 assists. The signings of
Titov in 2000, and Sandstrom in 1997 also brought less-than-hoped-for
returns.</TE>
<TE>   Oates does bring experience, including 142 playoff games, and
Murray hopes that he will mentor the young Duck players.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the young players will learn from him," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a character guy and I'm trying to bring a few younger
players into the lineup, that's important."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks plan to renovate their practice facility at Disney Ice,
upgrading their training equipment and enlarging the area.... Murray
said that the team was closer to signing Russian forward Stanislav
Chistov, their first-round pick in the 2001 draft.</TE>

<HD>Lakers' George Is Reviewing Offers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Monday, the first day that NBA teams can negotiate with free
agents, Laker General Manager Mitch Kupchak spoke with the agent for
Devean George.</LD>
<LD>   "I had a really good talk with Mitch," Mark Bartlestein, George's
agent, said. "Devean's got nothing but great feelings toward the
Lakers. Still, he owes it to himself to hear what everybody else has
to say. We have to play this out and see what happens."</LD>
<LD>   Bartlestein, who is based in Chicago, said he was contacted by 12
to 15 teams concerning George, regarded by some as a huge talent
stifled by the Lakers' triangle offense and veteran-heavy roster.</LD>
<TE>   Armed presumably with a portion of the mid-level exception as the
starting point to a multiyear deal, Kupchak has said he hoped to
re-sign the athletic George. After playing very well early in the
season after the club declined to exercise the fourth-year option on
his rookie contract, George flattened out in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   The club has other needs, particularly at power forward, although
it has won the last three NBA championships with three different
starters there, four if one counts both Robert Horry and Samaki
Walker last season.</TE>
<TE>   Undersized Malik Rose is an unrestricted free agent whom the
Lakers expect will re-sign with San Antonio, but the Spurs figure the
Lakers will make a play for him. Veteran Charles Oakley would fill a
one-year gap in the Laker front line for the veteran's minimum $1
million, but the club did not make a call to the forward's
representatives Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have had internal discussions about most available
forwards and backup centers, from Boston free agent Rodney Rogers to
retired center Arvydas Sabonis and a handful of others, but there is
a general lack of satisfaction about the quality and/or cost of such
potential additions.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Kupchak will focus on retaining his own free agents.
Along with George, he has said he would like to re-sign Slava
Medvedenko and Brian Shaw. The Lakers could also offer Jelani McCoy a
contract, probably not guaranteed, and mull an offer to veteran Mitch
Richmond, who has said he would like to return to the team despite
limited minutes last season. Medvedenko is a restricted free agent,
allowing the Lakers to match any offers.</TE>
<TE>   The heavy competition for George could come from the Washington
Wizards, Miami Heat, Memphis Grizzlies, Minnesota Timberwolves,
Philadelphia 76ers and Denver Nuggets. In a fairly weak off-season
for free agents, the Wizards apparently are prepared to spend their
entire mid-level exception--expected to be about $4.6 million--on
George.</TE>
<TE>   Teams cannot sign free agents until July 17.</TE>

<HD>Germany Will Take Its Turn</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Beckenbauer has plenty of ideas and is eager to put
his stamp on next World Cup in 2006.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>And so, on to Germany.</LD>
<LD>   Just when World Cup fans had learned to wrap their tongues around
such exotic and strange-sounding places as Seogwipo and Gwangju,
South Korea, and Shizuoka and Niigata, Japan, the circus has packed
its tents and moved on down the road.</LD>
<LD>   Fans now have four years, more or less, to learn to tell their
Gelsenkirchens from their Kaiserslauterns. A quick clue: They're both
in Germany and are two of the 12 towns that will play host to the
2006 World Cup.</LD>
<TE>   The other cities might be more familiar: Berlin and Dortmund,
Frankfurt and Hamburg, Hanover and Cologne, Leipzig and Munich,
Nuremberg and Stuttgart.</TE>
<TE>   The name of the chap in charge of it all might also ring a bell,
or a glockenspiel, perhaps. He's Franz Beckenbauer, one-time New York
Cosmos' defender but no doubt better known as the man who won a World
Cup as a player for Germany in 1974 and another as Germany's coach in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   Now he wants to win a third, as "president of the Organizing
Committee for the 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany," to quote the snappy
52-page media guide that he and his folks already had distributed
here long before Ronaldo and Brazil waltzed away with the 2002 World
Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "Der Kaiser" is what Beckenbauer is called back home in Bavaria, a
nickname that reflects both his stature and his demanding nature.</TE>
<TE>   And "Der Kaiser" already has started demanding.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't like the idea that the 2002 World Cup calendar was
arranged without taking into consideration that the world's top
players were all coming off a grueling European season and needed
more rest.</TE>
<TE>   "The World Cup is the best we have and the whole world is
watching, but what do they see?" Beckenbauer asked early in the
tournament. "Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo [and] David Beckham are all
injured or out of shape."</TE>
<TE>   The problem, Beckenbauer said, lies in an overcrowded schedule.
Leading players are involved in domestic leagues that are too large,
there are various cup competitions that are too cumbersomely
organized, and unnecessary international friendlies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too much," he said. "Football suffers from that. Who needs a
World Cup with tired teams? This is negative publicity. It's not the
future. It's impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "The message from this World Cup--that this situation cannot
continue--has to be answered immediately. The number of clubs in some
of the major leagues has to be reduced. There are also too many
matches in the Champions League and too many internationals.</TE>
<TE>   "And it's not only Europe. [Each of the] South American teams had
to go through 18 qualifying matches before making the finals."</TE>
<TE>   Besides reducing the number of games, Beckenbauer also wants more
time between the European Champions Cup final, the traditional season
finale, and the start of the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Korea/Japan '02 started May 31. Beckenbauer said the 2006 Cup will
begin at least 10 days later.</TE>
<TE>   Supporting Beckenbauer's view is Jean-Marcel Ferret, France's team
doctor, who last month told the French daily Le Parisien that he
realized even before the tournament began that the defending
champions would not be competitive.</TE>
<TE>   "I found them exhausted mentally and physically," Ferret said.
"The tests we made in April were already worrying. Much of the data
about their condition was bad then. They were really tired.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of them were fed up, and many things they bore two years ago
[when France won the 2000 European Championship] were unbearable this
time. They had only two weeks to prepare when they needed at least a
month."</TE>
<TE>   France was ousted in the first round without scoring a goal. It
was the worst performance by a defending champion.</TE>
<TE>   Germany '06 will at least be easier from a logistics standpoint.
There will be only one host country and only a dozen venues, compared
to the unwieldy two-country, 20-venue competition of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Michel Zen-Ruffinen, the soon-to-be former general secretary of
FIFA--he was fired in the wake of Joseph "Sepp" Blatter's
controversial reelection as president--said Monday that co-hosting
had not proven as big a problem as originally feared and that it
probably would be repeated.</TE>
<TE>   "With rotation of the World Cup due to start between the
continents in 2010, without co-hosting, the World Cup would go back
to the same countries time after time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have seen here--between, let's say, two countries that
have not exactly been good friends--that the concept can work if
there is the will to make it work. I am sure more World Cups will be
shared in the future."</TE>
<TE>   The next time could be in 2010, when Africa supposedly will get
the Cup. That could be bad news for one-time favorite South Africa,
because co-hosting would certainly be easier between, say, Morocco
and Tunisia, than between countries at opposite ends of the
continent.</TE>
<TE>   European teams, too, would prefer the short hop across the
Mediterranean to the long haul to South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Germany, meanwhile, does not have to trouble itself with such
trifles. It has all the infrastructure in place to stage a World Cup
right now, but is spending $1.4 billion to replace or upgrade its 12
designated World Cup stadiums, which range in capacity from the
44,000 of Leipzig's Zentralstadion to the 76,000 of Berlin's
Olympiastadion.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the money, about $280 million, is being used to build a
new stadium in Munich, which is expected to stage the opening
ceremony and game. Completion is set for the summer of 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Berlin will play host to the final game and closing ceremony, and
the Olympiastadion, built for the 1936 Olympic Games, is being
refurbished at a cost of $242 million.</TE>
<TE>   The next World Cup is not nearly as distant as it might seem. The
tournament's emblem will be unveiled next month and the preliminary
draw for qualifying competition will be held in December 2003.</TE>
<TE>   There is one other wrinkle. For the first time, the defending
champion will not qualify automatically. The host team, however,
will.</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, Germany already has defeated Brazil.</TE>

<HD>Yankees Will Give Mondesi a Chance</HD>
<DH>Baseball: New York acquires temperamental former Dodger
from Toronto in exchange for minor league pitcher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Yankees moved to address their outfield problem Monday
by ridding the Toronto Blue Jays of their biggest problem, acquiring
talented but temperamental right fielder Raul Mondesi for a minor
league pitcher.</LD>
<LD>   The Yankees sent double-A left-hander Scott Wiggins, 26, to
Toronto for the two-time Gold Glove award winner and 1994 National
League rookie of the year with the Dodgers, hoping that Mondesi, 31,
leaves his questionable attitude at the border and improves their
subpar production in right field.</LD>
<LD>   The Blue Jays were so eager to end their relationship with
Mondesi, who has a history of profanity-laced outbursts against
management and recently blasted Manager Carlos Tosca for benching
him, that they accepted only a borderline prospect in the deal.
Toronto also agreed to pay $6 million of the $13 million Mondesi will
receive in the last year of his six-year, $60-million contract next
season, though the Yankees will pay the remainder of his $11-million
salary this season.</LD>
<TE>   Yankee General Manager Brian Cashman is gambling that Mondesi will
conform to the Yankee Way and shut the revolving door in right,
keeping his fingers crossed that Mondesi doesn't repeat the bad
performances that closed his previous shows in Los Angeles and
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   "We're obviously excited to acquire Raul Mondesi," Cashman said.
"He's a player who has the ability on the defensive side to beat the
opponent by preventing the running game, and on the offensive side,
he has the ability to hit the long ball. He gives us a presence in
right field that currently we do not have."</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees (50-31), who were off Monday, lead the American League
East by 1 1/2 games despite shuffling the deck in right. Shane
Spencer opened the season as the everyday right fielder but was
quickly dropped into a platoon with John Vander Wal. The Yankees have
also tried rookie Juan Rivera, who has a broken kneecap and is on the
disabled list, Marcus Thames and Enrique Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Mondesi is expected to join the club today and start in right
against the Cleveland Indians. With Mondesi owed $5.5 million this
season, the trade increases the Yankees' industry-high payroll to
about $131 million.</TE>
<TE>   Mondesi has struggled this season, batting only .224 in 75 games
with Toronto, but has also hit 15 home runs, driven in 45 runs and
scored 51. Wiggins, the Yankees' seventh-round selection in the June
'97 first-year player draft, was 2-1 with a 2.45 earned-run average
in 23 relief appearances for the club's double-A affiliate.</TE>
<TE>   Mondesi, in his ninth full season, hit at least 30 homers with the
Dodgers from 1997-99, and has hit at least 24 homers seven times. In
'97, Mondesi became the only player in Dodger franchise history to
hit at least 30 homers with at least 30 stolen bases during a season.</TE>
<TE>   Teammates admired Mondesi for the passion he exhibited on the
field, but Dodger officials grew frustrated with him because of his
poor work habits.</TE>
<TE>   In a tirade in August of '99, Mondesi blasted Kevin Malone and
Davey Johnson, then the team's general manager and manager,
respectively, spurring the Dodgers to trade him to Toronto that
off-season in a four-player deal for All-Star right fielder Shawn
Green.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Mondesi was upset with Tosca after he was benched for
two games for reporting 10 minutes late to a team meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees believe Mondesi, expected to hit seventh or eighth in
their batting order, will provide stability in right.</TE>
<TE>   "He has big tools, there's no question about that," Manager Joe
Torre said.</TE>
<TE>   "He can throw, he can run, he can hit for power and
average--better than he's hitting now. We hope he's a big player for
us in New York, and he'll certainly have the opportunity."</TE>

<HD>Gunmen Attack Three Outside Hudson's Home</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Masked gunmen attacked three people outside the home of Orlando Magic
point guard Troy Hudson, fatally shooting a 20-year-old man and
pistol-whipping a 15-year-old boy, police said Monday at Maitland,
Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Hudson, a former Clipper, wasn't home late Sunday when a car
pulled into his driveway. Two men got out and opened fire, according
to police in the Orlando suburb.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second time in three days the home was targeted, said
Bill Neff, Hudson's agent. He said robbers broke into the home
Friday, taking several hundred dollars and attacking some guests
after being unable to find Hudson's car keys. Hudson wasn't home
then, either. He had refused to return to the house after the first
robbery and was staying elsewhere in the Orlando area when Sunday's
shooting occurred.</LD>
<TE>   The dead man was identified as Carrick Reid, 20, of Orlando. The
15-year-old wasn't identified by authorities. A third person,
Cleveland Fields, 27, of Maitland, escaped through a rear window,
police said. Neff said Reid, Fields and the teen are friends of
Hudson. Police said there were no suspects.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released by the Magic, Hudson expressed grief for
Reid's family and said he was cooperating with the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baron Davis, who said in recent weeks that he'd rather be traded
than move with the Charlotte Hornets to New Orleans, was offered a
six-year contract extension. Bob Bass, Hornet vice president for
basketball operations, has said several teams have contacted the
Hornets about trading for Davis, who said he would rather play in Los
Angeles, Chicago or New York than in New Orleans next season.</TE>
<TE>   Bass said he has rejected all offers and did not intend to deal
Davis under any circumstances.</TE>

<TE>   Larry Bird, making his first public appearance in Charlotte, N.C.,
since announcing his interest in bringing the area an expansion team,
said he intends to be as successful as a general manager as he was as
a player and coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how long it would take to make the playoffs,"
Bird said. "But I'll be here a long time--so close the windows and
lock the doors."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After interviewing for the coaching vacancy in Denver, Donnie
Nelson dropped out of consideration and accepted an offer to become
the president of basketball operations for the Dallas Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson already was an assistant coach and director of player
personnel in Dallas, and the new title has no new duties but gives
him the authority to take ideas directly to owner Mark Cuban instead
of having to go through his father, Coach and General Manager Don
Nelson.</TE>

<HD>Holik Signed by Rangers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Rangers signed center Bobby Holik on Monday night,
acquiring a tough, two-way forward who won two Stanley Cups with the
New Jersey Devils.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Glen Sather called Holik's signing "an absolute
priority" for the Rangers, who have missed the playoffs the last five
seasons. Teams were able to start negotiating with unrestricted free
agents Monday, though Sather targeted Holik before that.</LD>
<LD>   "I always knew it was a possibility this could happen, so I always
knew what I wanted," Holik said. "The only ones I gave any serious
thought to were from the Rangers. My mind was somewhat made up about
what I want to get out of being an unrestricted free agent."</LD>
<TE>   Last season, the 6-foot-4, 230-pound Holik had 25 goals and 29
assists with the Devils. New Jersey also made a pitch to Holik on
Monday, but it wasn't enough to keep him.</TE>
<TE>   He will reportedly earn $45 million over five years with the
Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   "We did, in my mind, put in a very substantial offer this morning
and we felt comfortable with the offer," Devil General Manager Lou
Lamoriello said. "There are certain things we can't control. It was a
decision he had to make. It's his future, I respect that. I wish him
the best."</TE>
<TE>   Holik said "there was a major philosophical difference" between
New Jersey's offer and New York's, and that he "didn't spend much
time looking at it."</TE>
<TE>   "I gave the Devils more than one chance, not just today, but over
the last 13 months to sign me to a long-term deal," Holik said. "I
didn't make this decision just today. A lot of things have gone
through my head this year."</TE>
<TE>   Holik went to arbitration with the Devils last summer and was
awarded a one-year, $3.5 million contract.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard things that no player wants to hear," Holik said. "I
wouldn't mind if it was honest criticism, that you could take to
heart.... But it's a strange process."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Capitals signed free-agent forward Robert Lang to a
five-year contract worth a reported $25 million.... The San Jose
Sharks re-signed center Patrick Marleau, forward Marco Sturm and
defenseman Shawn Heins. The club also declined to exercise its option
on forward Alex Korolyuk, making him a restricted free agent.</TE>

<HD>Franco's Slam Fuels Braves' Rally</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's hard to say who was more responsible for the latest Atlanta
victory--Matt Franco or the Braves' bullpen.</LD>
<LD>   Either way, the Braves are turning the National League East into a
race for second place.</LD>
<LD>   Franco hit his first career grand slam, and five relief pitchers
held the Montreal Expos to one run over six innings to lead Atlanta
past Montreal, 7-5, Monday night at Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   The Braves trailed, 4-1, after three innings but won for the 11th
time in 12 games to push their lead in the NL East to nine games over
the Expos, who lost their third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Ligtenberg (2-3) pitched two scoreless innings for the
victory. He replaced Tom Glavine, who left the game in the third
inning with a blister on his index finger. Glavine wasn't sure if he
would make his next start.</TE>
<TE>   Glavine gave up four runs and seven hits, including homers by
Vladimir Guerrero and Fernando Tatis. In his 16th season, he said he
has never had blisters before this year.</TE>
<TE>   Relievers Darren Holmes, Tim Spooneybarger and Chris Hammond held
Montreal in check until the ninth, when John Smoltz came in to get
his 28th save in 31 chances.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Vidro homered against Smoltz to start the ninth. Orlando
Cabrera, who had four hits, lined out to center field with two
runners on to end it.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves' bullpen has a major league-leading 2.32 earned-run
average.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 7, Houston 5--Winning pitcher Jimmy Haynes went 3 for 3
with two runs batted in and pitched six strong innings to spark the
Reds at Cincinnati. The Reds won for the fifth time in six games.</TE>
<TE>   Both teams wore old-style jerseys to commemorate Riverfront
Stadium's opening June 30, 1970. But there was one glitch: The Reds'
uniforms were off by two years.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros wore gray uniforms that matched their 1970 road outfit,
but the Reds suited up in the predominantly white uniforms worn by
the Big Red Machine. Those weren't introduced until 1972.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 8, Colorado 6--Jeff Kent hit a three-run homer in
the ninth inning, and the Giants rallied at Denver. Colorado led,
6-5, after eight innings, but closer Jose Jimenez (2-5) hit leadoff
hitter David Bell and Ramon Martinez followed with a single. Kent
then hit Jimenez's first pitch to left field for his 14th homer.</TE>
<TE>   Kent had three hits and is 13-for-24 with 15 RBIs since moving
five days ago from cleanup to the third spot in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 7, San Diego 3--Woody Williams hit his second career
home run and won for the fourth time in five starts to lead the host
Cardinals. Jim Edmonds, Miguel Cairo and Albert Pujols also homered
against rookie Oliver Perez, 20, the youngest player in the major
leagues. The Cardinals remained tied for the NL Central lead with
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 11, Chicago 1--Michael Tejera gave up one run over seven
innings and drove in two runs for the Marlins at Miami. Tejera (4-1)
won his third consecutive start, striking out a career-high nine.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 6, New York 3--Brandon Duckworth pitched 7 1/3 strong
innings and Travis Lee homered and drove in four runs at
Philadelphia. Jose Mesa closed out the game for his 21st save in 25
chances.</TE>

<HD>Wells Loses No-Hitter, Game</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Kip Wells came within five outs of a no-hitter Monday night, but
Jamey Wright pitched even better.</LD>
<LD>   Alex Sanchez broke up Wells' no-hit bid with one out in the eighth
inning, and Wright pitched a three-hitter as the Milwaukee Brewers
defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates, 2-0, Monday night at PNC Park.</LD>
<LD>   "That's probably the most frustrating loss I've had in the big
leagues," Wells said.</LD>
<TE>   Wright (2-6) held the Pirates to three singles as he won for the
first time since defeating San Diego on May 24. It was his second
shutout, first this season.</TE>
<TE>   Wright had lost his last three decisions to the Pirates and four
in a row in Pittsburgh. He struck out four and walked four.</TE>
<TE>   Wells (9-5) struck out Wright for the first out of the eighth
before Sanchez lined an 0-1 pitch over third baseman Aramis Ramirez
for a single.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez, who has been focusing on hitting to the opposite field,
was looking for an outside pitch.</TE>
<TE>   He stole second, went to third on a fly ball and scored when a
slumping Jeffrey Hammonds doubled to right-center. The Brewers added
a run in the ninth when Alex Ochoa scored on Paul Bako's single.</TE>

<DL>YOKOHAMA, Japan</DL>
<LD>It is the day after the World Cup final in Yokohama and it is so
quiet, you can hear a security guard nod off at the entrance to the
international media center.</LD>
<LD>   He is standing up and sleeping at the same time, kind of like a
German soccer fan, wobbling a bit as I pass through the door but
maintaining his balance all the time. An impressive feat, if a little
unorthodox, but after five weeks of this, plus injury time, you've
got to do what you've got to do.</LD>
<LD>   Inside, I see sportswriters keeled over their keyboards. I see
sportswriters staring at the coffee machine, too mentally glazed to
figure out which button means cream and which is the coin return. I
see sportswriters flipping through their hotel room keys, ATM cards
and subway passes, muttering to themselves because none of them seem
to work in the pay phones at their desks.</LD>
<TE>   Travel fatigue is common at the end of a World Cup or an Olympics,
but this is the worst case I have ever seen. That is, when I've been
able to keep my eyes open.</TE>
<TE>   It's really no secret why. We were sold a bill of goods when we
were handed our press credentials and told we would be covering the
one and only World Cup, the single biggest soccer tournament in
existence.</TE>
<TE>   Truth is, we were actually covering three World Cups.</TE>
<TE>   The first involved 32 teams from 32 nations, playing 64 games to
determine one champion.</TE>
<TE>   The second involved Japan and South Korea, engaged in a very
serious game of one-upmanship, each bidding to become the co-host
with the most.</TE>
<TE>   The third involved FIFA czar Joseph "Sepp" Blatter and his
glad-handing, back-slapping band of cronies, comfortably sequestered
in their own little world while fans waged a daily struggle to get
hotel rooms, train schedules and game tickets that weren't available,
even though large blocks of seats went unused, game after game.</TE>
<TE>   Final results:</TE>
<TE>   * Brazil won the first World Cup, over Germany, 2-0, in the final.</TE>
<TE>   * South Korea won the second World Cup, over Japan in a close one.</TE>
<TE>   * FIFA thinks it won the third World Cup, in a shootout, but the
real world is protesting.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter (sounds like blather) kept saying that the tournament was
progressing swimmingly--which, considering the dearth of available
plane flights, was the only travel option left for some fans trying
to get from Japan to Korea and back again so they could follow their
teams.</TE>
<TE>   He said, "Co-hosting has had only a positive influence on the
game. We have had wonderful stadia, good hospitality and perfect
logistics."</TE>
<TE>   This is clearly the view of a man who watches the World Cup from
the back seat of his air-conditioned limousine and the penthouse
suite of his five-star hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the stadiums were impressive, if gray concrete is your
idea of an innovative color scheme. Japan and South Korea spent
billions in a stadium-building frenzy, not because each country
needed 10 new soccer stadiums, but because the other guy was building
10 new stadiums. It sounded like a Far Eastern riff on the "I will
have two fillings" commercials that ran during the 1999 Women's World
Cup:</TE>
<TE>   I will have 10 stadiums!</TE>
<TE>   And I will have 10 stadiums!</TE>
<TE>   Did the small city of Oita, nestled between two national parks on
the southern Japanese island of Kyushu, really need a new 42,000-seat
soccer stadium with a retractable roof? With fans traveling to and
from games via hovercraft?</TE>
<TE>   "It's like putting Texas Stadium in the middle of Lake Elsinore,"
one U.S. writer quipped.</TE>
<TE>   Because these facilities needed to be useful after their allotted
three World Cup games were played, many used the same multi-purpose
design--meaning a running track encircling the playing field, meaning
fans pushed up and away from the action.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Coach Bruce Arena said that worked to his team's benefit when
the Americans played South Korea in Daegu, with the fan noise
slightly muted by the distance between the stands and the field.</TE>
<TE>   Good hospitality? There was plenty of that. Volunteers in both
countries were friendly, courteous and helpful--although the Japanese
penchant for punctuality, cleanliness and order caused media centers
to be shut down too often before writers could finish their work.
(Memo to JAWOC: Sportswriters, at least uncouth Western types, cannot
comprehend "no eating" and "no drinking" signs when they are on
deadline.)</TE>
<TE>   I spent time in both countries and found South Korea to be more
laid-back and go-with-the-flow flexible. Yes, I know, it was a
tournament of upsets. Getting things done, such as changing money or
buying plane tickets, was easier there, as opposed to Japan, where
every small transaction seemed to require forms filled out in
triplicate and committee consultation.</TE>
<TE>   Japan gets the nod for food, however. The bento box lunches that
sustained me on train trips were unfailingly delicious, even if I did
not recognize half of what I was eating, and certainly were an
upgrade over the dried squid, cold sausages and banana-flavored milk
served in Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Perfect logistics? This is FIFA ivory-tower syndrome at its worst.
Playing games in two countries, separated by sea, made covering all
the important games in person impossible. Fans of teams that advanced
to the latter stages and crossed over from one country to the other
were left to scramble for lodging, tickets and
transportation--provided their already depleted savings could
withstand the strain.</TE>
<TE>   This was especially true when crossing over from economical Korea
to expensive Japan. Fans and media alike watched in amazement as cab
fare for a $5 ride in Seoul ballooned to $20 in Yokohama.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, however, a World Cup is remembered for the quality of
its soccer, and Korea/Japan 2002 got off to a rousing start. Senegal
over France, the United States over Portugal, England over
Argentina--there seemed to be a can-you-believe? moment every day
during the first round.</TE>
<TE>   There is one downside of upset fever, however: Too many of them
too soon and the big boys start heading home in a hurry. With France,
Argentina, Portugal, Italy and Cameroon all gone so quickly, the only
knockout-phase matchup that bristled with pre-kickoff buzz was the
Brazil-England quarterfinal--which lived up to its promise until
England's goalkeeper, David Seaman, fell asleep on Ronaldinho's
30-yard free kick in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Seaman, like the rest of us, was suffering from travel
fatigue.</TE>
<TE>   The refereeing controversies that escorted South Korea past
Portugal, Italy and Spain are impossible to ignore, even if Blatter
tried his best.</TE>
<TE>   After the semifinals and final had gone off without a major
glitch, Blatter crowed, "These last few matches have helped
enormously to restore full confidence in the ability of the world's
referees and assistants to rise to the occasion and to set the
standard for match officials at all levels of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Which, of course, is nonsense. Are Spaniards and Italians feeling
any better about their disallowed goals just because Pierluigi
Collina refereed a nice game between Brazil and Germany on Sunday?</TE>
<TE>   Even the improved officiating at the tournament's end smacked of
condescension on FIFA's part. Turn the lesser-regarded referees loose
in the early rounds, give the co-hosts and the longshots a few quick
headlines and string their fans along for two or three weeks. Then,
when the stakes rise high enough, let's bring in the European
referees and start to get serious, shall we?</TE>
<TE>   Four days before the final, Blatter told reporters in Yokohama,
"You will remember that I have said at the very beginning that this
will be the World Cup in a new environment, it is a World Cup played
in a new culture and there will be surprises--but I would be
surprised if, at the end, we will have a miracle."</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, we had South Korea, Senegal, Turkey and the United
States knocking it around, making things unpredictable for a while,
taking their moments in the sunshine.</TE>
<TE>   And we wound up with Brazil and Germany in the rain in the final.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter and FIFA prefer to keep things tidy. Holding the final in
Japan, where cab drivers wear white gloves and water bottles are
forbidden in the press box, they certainly came to the right place.</TE>
<TE>   It was exhilarating, it was exhausting, it was wild and woolly and
comfortably traditional and very, very, very clean.</TE>
<TE>   It is now time to get some sleep.</TE>

<HD>Showing Renewed Resolve</HD>
<DH>In remembrance of his stepbrother, Klatt rededicates
himself to water polo</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inspiration often comes from unexpected sources. In the case of Dan
Klatt, a member of the U.S. national men's water polo team, the
desire to succeed was refueled last summer by the death of his
10-year-old stepbrother.</LD>
<LD>   Skyler Hafen was killed in an off-road motorcycle accident while
visiting his father in Utah, leaving Klatt devastated and vulnerable.
Suddenly, he had to reconsider his future. Should he continue feeding
his dreams of playing for world titles? Or go back home to Clovis,
where he would be close to his family?</LD>
<LD>   In the days after the accident, Klatt received strong support from
teammates and coaches, prompting him to rededicate his life to a role
Skyler had so cherished, he wore Klatt's No. 9 on his own athletic
uniforms.</LD>
<TE>   "Skyler wanted to see me play on the national team," said Klatt,
23. "Obviously, that will never happen, but he's motivating me to
stay with it, to get better all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Klatt, who joined the national team in April 2001, will be back in
the pool Thursday against Russia in a FINA World Water Polo League
game at the Los Alamitos Armed Forces Center. The U.S. is using its
league games to prepare for the World Championships Aug. 20-25 in
Yugoslavia. The U.S. will be host to the Russians again Saturday,
then travel overseas to play six games between July 12-21. After the
U.S. plays 2000 Olympic champion Hungary July 26-27 in Moraga, the
two teams with the best records from the four-team U.S. bracket will
advance to the league Super Final in Patras, Greece, in early August
when they will compete with two teams from another bracket for
$100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Against Russia, Klatt, a former UC Irvine star, will be counted on
to use his 6-foot-5, 200-pound body to interrupt the Russians'
powerful two-meter game. His play has become a key link in the
retooling project of U.S. Coach Ratko Rudic, who assumed duties
shortly after the team's sixth-place finish at the 2000 Games. Only
three players remain from that squad, leaving an untested but
talented group.</TE>
<TE>   Klatt is one of the newcomers, but he has played like a national
team veteran. His main responsibility is defending in the two-meter
area, a position closest to the cage, where the offensive team's most
dangerous scorer can usually be found. His contributions on offense
usually are made when the U.S. enjoys the man-advantage, as was
evident when he scored two six-on-five goals in the third quarter
Friday against Croatia, helping the U.S. to a 15-13 victory in the
league opener.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a role player," said goalkeeper Genai Kerr said. "He's able
to pick up and do the jobs that other people aren't necessarily the
best at. Whether it's swimming [from one end of the pool to the
other], defending two meters or drawing ejections, he does all the
dirty work."</TE>
<TE>   Those contributions have been invaluable to the team, but they've
paled in comparison to what he has received from Rudic and his
teammates in the days since Skyler's death.</TE>
<TE>   Klatt was in Croatia with the U.S. team when he received an early
morning call informing him of the accident. He immediately sought out
Rudic, a man he uses as a model for his own coaching career.
Together, they sat for the next four hours, trying to make sense of
the tragedy. Klatt had to wait three days before he could get a
flight home to Clovis, but his teammates stayed close by.</TE>
<TE>   "We were his family," Kerr said. "We were his brothers."</TE>
<TE>   After the funeral, Klatt got into his car and headed back to his
job as girls' water polo co-coach at Santa Ana Foothill High. The day
was Sept. 11. An already somber trip became almost unbearable with
the news of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington D.C. His
mood lifted somewhat when he arrived on campus and was greeted with
more support from players and staff.</TE>
<TE>   "They all rallied around me," he said. "They kept me from
dwelling."</TE>
<TE>   Klatt said his coaching responsibilities kept his mind occupied,
gave him a reason to leave home in the morning and to get to sleep
early at night. He was rewarded when the Knights won their third
consecutive Southern Section Division I championship, cementing the
title with an 8-0 victory over rival Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never watched a video more than that one," said Klatt, who
shares water polo coaching duties with Dave Mikesell.</TE>
<TE>   But even that successful season was accompanied by a painful
lesson. Foothill had to forfeit a game to Newport Harbor because
Klatt had ventured onto school grounds while under suspension for the
game after receiving a red card in a previous junior varsity contest.</TE>
<TE>   The forfeit ended a 38-game winning streak for the Knights,
prompting Klatt to offer the team his resignation. The girls quickly
refused, but the heartfelt gesture showed Klatt's belief in a
team-first, individual-second attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "An individual act cost the team," said Klatt, a third-team
All-American as a junior at UC Irvine in 1998 and second team in
2000. "An individual does not have that right or power."</TE>
<TE>   Those are words that Rudic has lived by while coaching Italy and
Yugoslavia to Olympic gold medals during his career. Klatt studies
Rudic's every maneuver, making mental notes for the days he walks the
pool deck, calling out instructions for his players.</TE>
<TE>   A big reason Klatt tried out for the team was the chance to play
for a coach of Rudic's caliber.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting coached directly by the best coach in the world,"
Klatt said.</TE>
<TE>   He also recently completed his first season as girls' swimming
coach at Foothill, where he led a group composed primarily of water
polo players to the Century League title and a seventh-place finish
at the Southern Section Division I finals. His swimming experience is
even more extensive than his water polo expertise, beginning with his
first competition, when he was 6. While at UCI, Klatt was among the
best sprinters and backstroke specialists in the Big West Conference.</TE>
<TE>   That runs in the family. His father, Rick Klatt, also a water polo
player at New Mexico, was among the best swimmers in the world. He
was part of an 800-meter freestyle relay team that set a world record
at the 1973 World Championships in Belgrade.</TE>
<TE>   Klatt is hoping to make his international mark in Belgrade next
month, a year after he was on the verge of walking away from water
polo.</TE>
<TE>   "You can give up, or you can keep going," Klatt said. "My
brother's death was obviously a painful situation, but it's what's
motivating me now."</TE>

<HD>Serena Steps Lightly</HD>
<DH>Wimbledon: Williams avoids pitfalls to easily advance.
Henman gets through in five sets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>WIMBLEDON, England --Whether it was the windy weather, a long rain
delay or a rejuvenated Chanda Rubin, the start of the second week
presented all sorts of trap doors for one of the Wimbledon favorites,
second-seeded Serena Williams.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, the reigning French Open champion, successfully avoided
the traps on a potentially manic Monday. The trap almost turned out
to be the fast-moving tarp, carried by the Centre Court grounds crew,
which came close to enveloping the 20-year-old.</LD>
<LD>   "I almost got ran over," said Williams, who beat Rubin, 6-3, 6-3,
in the fourth round. "But I survived. I'm a survivor. I made it to
another day."</LD>
<TE>   Williams has been all business. But she watched the World Cup
final on Sunday with Boris Becker and some of his friends, and boxer
Lennox Lewis caused a measure of commotion when he showed up for one
of Venus' matches last week, and hung out with Serena at Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time he walks out there ... I can tell he's going to win
because he's really focused and he has the look in his eyes," Serena
said of Lewis. "Like I saw on TV before he fought Mike [Tyson], he
looked much more focused than Tyson did."</TE>
<TE>   Williams took it another step and incorporated a tennis lesson.</TE>
<TE>   "If you lose your focus in boxing, you could be knocked out," she
said. "I think maybe also in tennis before you know it, you could be
down 5-0."</TE>
<TE>   Boxing metaphors were easy to come by all around the grounds,
especially where British fans were concerned. An ailing Tim Henman,
seeded fourth, needed smelling salts and attention from the trainer
primarily because of an unsettled stomach. But, Henman fought on and
overcame being down a service break in the fourth and fifth sets,
defeating Michel Kratochvil of Switzerland, 7-6 (5), 6-7 (2), 4-6,
6-3, 6-2, in 4 hours 13 minutes in the fourth round.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't looking pretty," acknowledged Henman, who said he felt
worse and grew more tired during the long rain delay, which lasted
nearly two hours.</TE>
<TE>   The fans again played a pivotal role, not unlike the one they
assumed in Henman's 3-hour 28-minute victory Saturday over Wayne
Ferreira. "I don't know. I was just saying to [coach] Larry
[Stefanki] I can't quite understand how I won the match," Henman
said. "At two sets to one and 2-1 down in the fourth, I was out of
there. Somehow the good old crowd got me going again."</TE>
<TE>   Said Kratochvil, who had never won a match at Wimbledon before
this year: "The more they screamed, I had to smile for myself. They
were all going for Tim. It's great. But the whole screaming comes to
you as well, and builds you up. Even if they scream for Tim, that was
lifting me on my toes as well."</TE>
<TE>   The arrival of a second British player in the final eight was
delayed by darkness and Xavier Malisse of Belgium. Malisse and Greg
Rusedski, who split the first four sets, will resume their match
today. Because of the weather delays and long matches, the
fourth-round match between Mark Philippoussis of Australia and former
champion Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands did not start and also
is scheduled today.</TE>
<TE>   Monday was a proud day for South America as three of its
players--Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador, David Nalbandian of Argentina
and Brazil's Andre Sa--reached the quarterfinals. It assured that
South America will have a Wimbledon men's singles semifinalist for
only the second time. The first was Peru's Alex Olmedo, who beat Rod
Laver in the 1959 final.</TE>
<TE>   Unusually, men's doubles took center stage when the Czech team of
Martin Damm and Cyril Suk beat Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi of Pakistan and
Amir Hadad of Israel, 6-1, 7-6 (5), 6-4, in the third round. Qureshi
and Hadad drew even more than the expected attention when Pakistani
sports officials condemned Qureshi for partnering with an Israeli, in
an interview with the news agency Agence France-Presse.</TE>
<TE>   The players said Monday they have mostly received support and were
excited to have done so well.</TE>
<TE>   "I never even thought it was going to become such a big thing,"
Qureshi said. "Actually, we're not here to change anything;
politicians and governments do that. We're just here to play and game
and enjoy it. But if everybody takes it a positive way, yeah, I'll
take it. Why not?"</TE>
<TE>   Said Hadad: "When he asked me to play, we didn't think it was
going to get so big. There are some people that might want to make
some headlines, say bad things about this. But I see it only positive
that two guys from different nationalities can play together."</TE>

<HD>It Happens on Quiet Day</HD>
<DH>Wimbledon: Mauresmo gets caught in line of fire when
women's matches offer little suspense.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>A time-honored tradition--the fishing expedition--is played out
almost every year at Wimbledon. A player is asked a leading question,
makes an innocuous observation, and suddenly, headlines are created.</LD>
<LD>   This usually happens on a quiet day with no upsets. Monday was
like that on the women's side for the most part. There was one small
break in form in the fourth round when No. 11-seeded Daniela
Hantuchova of Slovakia defeated No. 7 Jelena Dokic of Yugoslavia,
6-4, 7-5. But that wasn't much of a surprise because Dokic had lost
to Hantuchova in their two previous matches.</LD>
<LD>   Because a rain delay lasting almost two hours pushed back the
schedule, No. 3 Jennifer Capriati could not finish her match against
Eleni Daniilidou of Greece. Capriati won the first set, 6-1, and lost
the second, 3-6, when play was suspended. The third set was
rescheduled for today.</LD>
<TE>   Two-time defending champion and No. 1 Venus Williams beat No. 16
Lisa Raymond, 6-1, 6-2; No. 2 Serena Williams defeated Chanda Rubin,
6-3, 6-3, and No. 4 Monica Seles dispatched Tamarine Tanasurgarn of
Thailand, 6-2, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Also advancing in straight sets were No. 6 Justine Henin of
Belgium, Elena Likhovtseva of Russia and No. 9 Amelie Mauresmo of
France. All in all, it was a day with little suspense and drama.</TE>
<TE>   And so, after Mauresmo beat qualifier Laura Granville, 6-2, 6-2,
one reporter asked the 21-year-old American whether she had heard
that Mauresmo used steroids.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard those rumors too, but she works really hard," said
Granville, who has played almost exclusively on a smaller circuit,
below the WTA tour. "I'm not sure how she can get that strong. But
it's a sign of where women's tennis is going."</TE>
<TE>   Granville wasn't even yet at Stanford when Mauresmo made her
breakthrough by reaching the 1999 Australian Open final. The unfair
attacks on Mauresmo in regard to her physique and sexuality,
primarily by other players, started there. Mauresmo is hardly the
biggest or strongest woman on the tour. She has never tested positive
for a banned substance, and starting this year, the leading French
players are having their blood screened three times a year, in order
to monitor any variances.</TE>
<TE>   At the Grand Slams, players are tested from the quarterfinals on,
and randomly beforehand. The WTA tour has in-competition testing at
its tournaments, and the tour's general counsel and vice president of
legal and business affairs, Tandy O'Donoghue said that almost every
top player--those in the top 25--has been tested numerous times last
year.</TE>
<TE>   "One-hundred-twenty different players have been tested, and I'm
being conservative," added O'Donoghue.</TE>
<TE>   One of the big issues and a point of contention is the absence of
random, out-of-competition testing on the WTA tour. For the men, the
ATP is attempting to increase its out-of-competition testing, which
had been relatively light in numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult. But there are no excuses," said O'Donoghue. "We
want to do it. We plan to do it. We hope to do some in 2002, We plan
to do some in 2003."</TE>

<HD>Cloud Hangs Over Cooper's Departure</HD>

<LD>Cynthia Cooper was standing near the visitors' locker room at Staples
Center a week ago when she was asked about her newborn twins.</LD>
<LD>   The twins--a boy and a girl--were delivered by a surrogate mother,
but Cooper, who has three other sons, was excited about the new
additions to her family and the challenge of raising her larger
family while handling the demands of coaching the Phoenix Mercury.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm like the typical new mom; my babies are the best, they are
perfect," said Cooper, chatting before the Mercury's game against the
Sparks. "My wonderful husband [Brian Dyke] has agreed to travel with
me this season and help keep them, so I can continue to bond with
them. I'm very lucky that he pacifies me. When the season is over,
I'll stay at home and let him run the streets a little."</LD>
<TE>   But somewhere between L.A. and Phoenix, something changed.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, Cooper had resigned as coach, after a year and a
half on the job. Her overall record was 19-23, but she had the
Mercury off to a 6-4 start and in the hunt for a playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   So what happened? And why won't anyone talk about it?</TE>
<TE>   Before she left, Cooper, who played at Locke High, USC and
overseas before leading the Houston Comets to the first four WNBA
championships, issued a statement to the effect that her resignation
had been by mutual agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "After talking with [team President Bryan Colangelo and Vice
President Seth Sulka], I decided that the best thing for me, my
family and the organization as a whole was for me to step down,"
Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   Only they know the reason why.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper was a demanding coach, and that might have grated on the
players. But none have expressed any joy publicly in her resignation,
not even forward Lisa Harrison, who had a loud argument with Cooper
on June 23.</TE>
<TE>   "No one saw this coming, not at all," said veteran center Jennifer
Gillom. "Yeah she could be tough, but she was passionate about her
work. We didn't want to see her go. It definitely was a shock."</TE>
<TE>   No one has said anything about how many times Cooper was to have
taken her babies with her on the road. Maybe the Mercury management
thought it was a one-shot deal. Or told Cooper she could do it for
the season, then changed its mind. It's not as if the arrival of the
twins June 15 came out of the blue.</TE>
<TE>   Or perhaps Cooper somehow wore out her welcome and no one admits
to it. Phoenix officials say there were no plans to fire her.</TE>
<TE>   The players have already had more than their share of issues this
season. Russian center Maria Stepanova came to training camp long
enough to tell the team she would not play in the league this year
because her boyfriend could not get a visa. She did stay long enough
to qualify for the WNBA medical plan, though, which will cover
expenses for the birth of her child in January.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was another Brandy Reed saga. The talented but troubled
forward was suspended again, for the second time in 13 months, and is
facing legal problems after having been charged with possession of
marijuana and driving on the wrong side of the road.</TE>
<TE>   Now this.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper, one of the greatest players in WNBA history, was coming
along as a coach. She doesn't deserve an exit as murky as this--even
if it was her own doing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Add Reed: She has talent--she was a WNBA All-Star in 2000, the
season she averaged 19 points--but has she thrown away her WNBA
career with this latest escapade?</TE>
<TE>   Reed cost herself the 2001 season in Phoenix after getting
suspended in a contract dispute. She told management she would stay
out of trouble this year--then couldn't make it through 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Mercury hasn't cut her--yet. But if Phoenix does let her go,
will any other general manager risk taking her on?</TE>
<TE>   According to one, Reed's skills probably will keep her in demand
awhile longer.</TE>
<TE>   "With her talent it could go either way," the general manager
said, asking not to be identified. "It depends on how desperate a
team is. If you have a hole to fill on your team, you will take a
chance. But this is, what, her second or third chance? Whoever would
take her would probably put her on that zero-tolerance policy, like
Bobby Knight [had at Indiana]."</TE>

<LD>An Orange County judge Monday ordered a former elementary school
principal and her husband, a Los Angeles County sheriff's sergeant,
to stand trial on a felony charge related to emotional abuse of the
couple's teenage son.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Derek G. Johnson ruled that prosecutors have
enough evidence to try Deborah Machnick, 46, and Grady Machnick, 45,
on a felony conspiracy charge and a misdemeanor count of child
endangerment.</LD>
<LD>   The Yorba Linda couple are accused of forcing Grady Machnick's son
from a prior marriage to sleep outside on a dog blanket as punishment
for disobeying them. They deny breaking any laws.</LD>
<TE>   Deborah Machnick, reassigned to an administrative job with the
Walnut Valley Unified School District, also told police she sent her
stepson to middle school with dog feces in his backpack--punishment
for not cleaning up after the family dog.</TE>
<TE>   The boy is now living with a foster family in Yorba Linda.</TE>

<HD>Aliso Viejo Celebrates Its First Year</HD>
<DH>Cities: The county's newest municipality weathers budget
woes, El Toro airport concerns. It now seeks new sources of income.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No longer facing financial disaster or an international airport in
its backyard, Aliso Viejo on Monday celebrated its first year of
cityhood. In an evening ceremony, city officials put up a flagpole,
unveiled the city logo--bright yellow with images of city landmarks
and "AV" in script--and breathed a sigh of relief.</LD>
<LD>   Only months after the South County community of more than 40,000
residents was incorporated, Aliso Viejo had to deal with fallout from
the state budget crisis. Last fall, as lawmakers in Sacramento
grappled with an expanding deficit, they discussed reducing the share
of vehicle tax revenue that cities receive.</LD>
<LD>   For new municipalities, that category represents nearly 50% of the
budget. Aliso Viejo would have lost nearly half of its $6.9-million
operating fund. City officials said that kind of drastic cut would
have required tough choices, such as whether to continue financing
sheriff's services and the fight against an airport at the closed El
Toro Marine base.</LD>
<TE>   As it turned out, the city took in $10 million, leaving a
$2.8-million budget surplus.</TE>
<TE>   "We were concerned," Mayor Pro Tem Cynthia Pickett said. "But we
were smart about it. We formed a coalition with other newly
incorporated cities, and we lobbied the state Legislature, impressing
upon them we've got to protect those local services."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, state lawmakers decided to raise Department of
Motor Vehicle fees instead of leaning on cities.</TE>
<TE>   As for the airport, Orange County voters in March rejected the
idea of an airport at El Toro, preferring a park for the property.</TE>
<TE>   Pickett said the airport issue resonated with residents much more
than the budget crisis.</TE>
<TE>   City Manager William Woollett said that fight helped to unite
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes what you really need is a good war," Woollett said. "We
feel we have more impact as a separate city than 40,000 people who
live in an unincorporated area."</TE>
<TE>   When voters approved incorporation on March 6, 2001, Aliso Viejo
became Orange County's 34th city and Southern California's newest.
With relatively low housing costs and a median age of 29, the
ethnically diverse community has been a magnet for first-time home
buyers since the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The incorporation--approved by 93% of the community's voters--took
effect July 1, 2001, after a two-year campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The cityhood drive had cleared a major hurdle in mid-2000 when a
state annexation agency approved the master-planned community's
cityhood bid.</TE>
<TE>   It also capped an era of rapid incorporation that saw eight Orange
County cities form in 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   While the city celebrated its birthday on Monday, officials
weren't quite ready to celebrate an El Toro victory.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still lawsuits looming," Pickett said. "Until Irvine
annexes that land, you still have to be wary."</TE>
<TE>   But with that issue having moved to the back burner, officials are
focusing on attracting revenue sources such as hotels and retail
centers.</TE>
<TE>   Officials had hoped that a hotel would be built alongside the
Aliso Viejo Golf Course, but those plans did not materialize.</TE>
<TE>   "The golf course has not given us the revenue that was projected,"
Mayor Carmen L. Vali said.</TE>
<TE>   "With no clubhouse, we're not able to do as many events. And
without a hotel and conference center, you're not getting the
corporate golf crowd."</TE>
<TE>   Having met the early challenges, city officials are upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   "We were proactive in addressing both of those issues," Pickett
said of the budget shortfall and the airport. "I think maybe we
averted the crisis by thinking ahead."</TE>

<HD>Jury Awards Victim of Bar Shooting $521,000</HD>
<DH>Courts: A Ventura tavern owner and her son, the gunman, are
found liable.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura man who was hospitalized for a month after a bar shooting
has won $521,224 from the bar's owner and her son.</LD>
<LD>   Adam Stroud had filed suit in Ventura County Superior Court,
contending that Dorothy Walbridge, owner of the Red Cove in the 1800
block of East Main Street in Ventura, failed to provide adequate
security at the bar the night of June 23, 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Stroud was shot by Walbridge's son, Christopher Marquez, 32, who
is serving a 24-year sentence in the incident.</LD>
<TE>   According to police reports, Marquez left the bar after getting
into a brawl with several other patrons before Stroud had arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez returned with a gun and shot Stroud twice, once in his
right arm and once in the abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   Stroud, 26 at the time, was hospitalized for a month and
accumulated $71,224 in medical bills, according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   Stroud said he was hit in his pancreas and colon and still has a
bullet in his abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon and
sentenced last August.</TE>
<TE>   The jury in the civil case deliberated for nearly two hours last
week before voting 10 to 2 to award Stroud the cost of his medical
bills, plus $450,000 in noneconomic damages.</TE>
<TE>   The jury decided Walbridge was responsible for 35% of the award
and her son for 65%.</TE>
<TE>   Walbridge did not return phone calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Her attorney, William S. Loomis, called the judgment excessive but
said it will not cause the closure of the Red Cove.</TE>
<TE>   He said Walbridge bore no responsibility for the actions of any of
the bar's patrons, including her son.</TE>
<TE>   She has not decided whether to appeal, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Court records show that the bar had been cited once by the
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control for serving a visibly
intoxicated person.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the city of Ventura cited the Red Cove for a noise
violation.</TE>

<HD>Millionaire's Date-Rape Trial Delayed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A trial date for date-rape suspect Andrew Luster has been postponed
for three months as lawyers continue to fight over the existence and
availability of evidence.</LD>
<LD>   Defense lawyers contend that Ventura County prosecutors are
withholding evidence that could exonerate their 38-year-old
millionaire client and prove allegations of police and prosecutor
misconduct.</LD>
<LD>   "We think Mr. Luster--an innocent man--was framed by the sheriff
and the district attorney," lawyer Richard G. Sherman said.</LD>
<TE>   "God forbid this is the way every case is handled in Ventura
County," the Los Angeles-based attorney said. "This is a travesty."</TE>
<TE>   The trial had been scheduled for July 17. Sherman and co-counsel
Roger Jon Diamond told Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley
that delays in the case can be attributed to prosecutors refusing to
give them tapes, photographs and other materials.</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony Wold told the judge that the items
sought by the defense either have been provided or do not exist.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute, which has been going on since the start of the year,
prompted Riley to postpone Luster's trial until Oct. 28. The judge
told the defense lawyers to provide him with a detailed list of the
items they are seeking.</TE>
<TE>   Luster, the great-grandson of cosmetics magnate Max Factor, is
accused of raping three women after rendering them unconscious with a
date-rape drug known as gamma hydroxybutrate, or GHB.</TE>
<TE>   Luster was arrested in July 2000 after one of the women reported
being drugged at a Santa Barbara bar and raped at his Mussel Shoals
beach house. During a search of the home, detectives found videotapes
that allegedly depict Luster engaging in sex acts with two
unconscious women.</TE>

<LD>The driver of a minivan that crashed into an Orange County sheriff's
patrol car, leaving a deputy in a coma, was arrested on suspicion of
felony drunk driving, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The crash caused the patrol car to overturn several times and skid
20 feet before bursting into flames on an embankment.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect, Karl Jiron, 41, of San Clemente was also hurt and
remains hospitalized at Western Medical Center, California Highway
Patrol officers said. He was arrested several hours after the
accident but was not booked into jail because of his injuries.</LD>
<TE>   Jiron's alcohol level was not immediately known.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mike Gaard's left arm was crushed, and he suffered swelling
of the brain as well as multiple fractures and other injuries in the
crash, which occurred while he was responding to a drive-by shooting
in San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors said they would try to bring Gaard out of his medically
induced coma by today to determine whether he has additional
injuries, said sheriff's spokesman Jon Fleischman. The coma was
induced to relieve the brain swelling.</TE>
<TE>   "The big milestone is when he awakens from the coma," Fleischman
said. "We're still waiting for the swelling in the brain to go down."</TE>
<TE>   Gaard, 33, a 12-year veteran of the department and former Deputy
of the Year, remained in guarded condition. His partner and
passenger, reserve deputy Henry Gould, 41, suffered a dislocated
shoulder and a shattered knee. He was listed in stable condition.</TE>
<TE>   Both officers underwent reconstructive and orthoscopic surgery at
Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   The crash occurred about 10 p.m. on Pacific Coast Highway near
Camino Capistrano, Fleischman said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators determined that the patrol car did not have its red
lights and siren on at the time. The CHP is expected to file a
complaint against Jiron with the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Donations for blood on behalf of Gaard can be made Wednesday from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center, 27700
Medical Center Road, Mission Viejo.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Reveals Plan for Park</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Proposal includes a farm museum, but an
existing recovery center for alcoholic women would be evicted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oxnard officials on Monday unveiled a proposed $12-million makeover
for College Park, an ambitious plan that includes new soccer and
baseball fields and a farm heritage museum.</LD>
<LD>   "It's everything we've talked about," said Gloria Postel,
chairwoman of the now-disbanded College Park Advisory Committee. "I
get tickled pink thinking about the [athletic fields], meandering
paths, the kids' area and the museum."</LD>
<LD>   The preliminary plan for the 75-acre park will be presented to the
City Council tonight. The proposal comes after years of battles among
groups over what types of facilities should be included.</LD>
<TE>   Some highlights of the city's proposal include:</TE>
<TE>   * A 12-acre dog park;</TE>
<TE>   * A fenced skate park;</TE>
<TE>   * A 26,000-square-foot community center with a gym;</TE>
<TE>   * Fields for baseball, softball and soccer; and</TE>
<TE>   * A lighted basketball area.</TE>
<TE>   Still undecided is the fate of the Rainbow Recovery Center for
alcoholic women that has been at the park for 17 years.</TE>
<TE>   The city's draft plan calls for the Ventura County Museum of
History and Art to occupy the two old farmhouses that the recovery
center now uses. One of the farmhouses would be dedicated to the
county's agricultural history.</TE>
<TE>   The city plan also calls for a farm heritage area, which would
include a caretaker's house, a blacksmith shop and a barn. The area
would also include flower gardens, crop displays, a vendors' section
and parking.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of recovery center supporters and Oxnard residents have
voiced their support for keeping the center where it is, while many
more residents and museum advocates have written letters asking city
officials to support the farm heritage area, said Michael Henderson,
the city's superintendent of parks and facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Henderson said that when the county transferred ownership of the
park to the city in 2000, language in the deed specifically stated
that all land must be used for "parks and recreation purposes," which
would exclude operation of the recovery center.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I'm concerned nothing is final," said Mayor Manuel
Lopez. "We need to explore [the deed restrictions]. What would be the
consequences? Is someone going to sue us? The county? Maybe they
could be persuaded to keep the Rainbow Center. This is not a
black-and-white issue."</TE>
<TE>   The park plan is still in the preliminary stages, officials
stressed. The city has just begun investigating ways to pay for the
improvements, including tapping into a $2.6-billion state bond
measure approved in March.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been waiting for this park for 24 years," Lopez said.
"We'd better do it right."</TE>

<HD>Midair Jet Collision Kills 71</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>A chartered Tupolev-154 airliner ferrying Russian teenagers to Spain
for summer vacation collided late Monday with a DHL Boeing 757 cargo
plane high above southern Germany, killing at least 71 people and
spreading burning debris over a wide area near the shores of Lake
Constance.</LD>
<LD>   About 50 schoolchildren were among the victims, Gennady Pirogov,
deputy director of Bashkirian Airlines, told The Times today. A
passenger list showed that most were between 13 and 16.</LD>
<LD>   "They were a wonderful lot--all young and pretty and happy to be
going abroad," said an anguished Tatiana Ostapenko, director of the
Soglasiye travel agency, which sent the youths on the plane.</LD>
<TE>   She said the teens were on the flight only because they had missed
their original flight Saturday because they had shown up at the wrong
Moscow airport. They were bound for a coastal resort in the Spanish
town of La Pineda, she said, with four adult supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw them off last night, and they were on Cloud Nine.... And
this morning, 50 young lives ruined because of some stupid mistake!"</TE>
<TE>   It was an extremely rare calamity: two large aircraft crashing
into each other at an altitude of about 35,000 feet. The collision
took place near the area where Germany, Austria and Switzerland meet,
raising questions about whether poor coordination among air traffic
controllers might have played a role.</TE>
<TE>   A German official quoted by news agencies today said the Russian
aircraft had failed to heed warnings to lower its altitude to avoid a
collision.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to assume right now that this was a misunderstanding,"
said Baden-Wuerttemberg state Transport Minister Ulrich Mueller.
Although the DHL pilot tried to change course, it was too late, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   German authorities said the two aircraft had just been handed off
to Swiss air traffic controllers when the accident occurred, but
there was no immediate comment from Swiss officials.</TE>
<TE>   With any collision at such a height, chances of survivors are nil.
Rescue workers began recovering bodies of some of the victims shortly
after the 11:43 p.m. crash, said Wolfgang Wenzel, a spokesman for
police in the German city of Tuebingen.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the victims were from the Bashkirian airliner. A statement
today from the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry said that the
Tupolev-154 had carried 57 passengers and 12 crew. The DHL plane, en
route from Bahrain to Brussels, carried only a two-man crew. Axel
Gietz, head of corporate affairs at the DHL delivery service in
Brussels, identified them as British pilot Paul Phillips and Canadian
co-pilot Brant Campioni.</TE>
<TE>   Bashkirian Airlines Flight BTS 2937 originated at Moscow's
Domodedovo airport and was bound for Barcelona. It departed Moscow at
10:50 p.m. Monday. If it had not crashed, it would have been due to
return to Moscow as BTS 2938 at 8:50 a.m. today Moscow time.</TE>
<TE>   Bashkirian Airlines is one of the carriers that emerged from the
breakup of Aeroflot after the collapse of the Soviet Union and is
regarded as reasonably safe. The airline is based in Ufa, the capital
of the Russian Federation republic of Bashkir in the southern Ural
Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The explosion that followed the collision was easily visible from
the ground, according to witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard a giant crash, and then it was as if the sky was
burning," Klaus Barinka, the captain of a ferry, told the German news
agency DPA.</TE>
<TE>   Recovery teams rapidly fanned out as burning parts rained down
along the northwestern shore of Lake Constance, known in German as
the Bodensee, about 160 miles south of Frankfurt. The pieces set
houses, trees, a farm and a school on fire in the towns of Owingen
and Ueberlingen.</TE>
<TE>   Parts of bodies and pieces of aircraft were strewn for miles close
to the shore, and a "black box"--either a flight data or cockpit
voice recorder--was reported recovered, German television said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. May Have Hit Villagers</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Warplanes struck a wedding party, officials
say. Dozens of casualties are reported.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN and GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Dozens of Afghan civilians were believed killed Monday when coalition
forces conducting a reconnaissance mission called in airstrikes that
may have hit a wedding party, according to early reports from U.S.
and Afghan authorities.</LD>
<LD>   American and Afghan officials dispatched a team of investigators
to the scene of the bombing amid sketchy and often conflicting
accounts of what prompted the airstrikes, what they targeted and how
many casualties they caused.</LD>
<LD>   News of the incident became public late Monday in Kabul, the
Afghan capital, and there was no official statement of the number of
dead and wounded.</LD>
<TE>   However, an Afghan government official was quoted by local media
as saying that 30 to 40 people had been killed and perhaps 60 to 70
wounded. Similar estimates came from local government sources in
Oruzgan province. Associated Press identified the village as Kakarak.</TE>
<TE>   Eyewitnesses, reached in the nearest hospital in Kandahar, said
the dead and wounded totaled as many as 150.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said they had not determined the number of
casualties, but an American military spokesman at Bagram air base
north of Kabul offered an apology to villagers who were injured or
lost family members in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States government extends its deepest sympathy to
those who may have lost loved ones and those who may have suffered
any injuries," said Army Col. Roger King at Bagram.</TE>
<TE>   American forces evacuated four children from the scene of the
bombing for medical treatment. Their ages ranged from 8 months to 5
years, said Air Force Lt. Col. Martin Compton, a spokesman for U.S.
Central Command in Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The team of investigators will include officials from the U.S.
military, the Afghan government and the American Embassy in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   The attack occurred about 2 a.m. Monday in Oruzgan, a mountainous
region in the center of the country where coalition forces are
hunting remnants of Taliban and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Coalition forces, including U.S. and Afghan soldiers, were
conducting a reconnaissance operation near a remote village, Compton
said. The forces came under fire and requested air cover, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At least two American planes responded, including an AC-130
gunship that encountered antiaircraft fire within moments of its
arrival and a B-52 bomber that was completing an earlier mission in
which it had dropped 2,000-pound bombs on suspected Al Qaeda caves
and bunkers, Compton said.</TE>
<TE>   The B-52 went on to drop seven bombs on the village, according to
another Central Command spokesman, Navy Cmdr. Frank Merriman. It was
not clear whether the civilians killed and injured in the strikes
were hit by mistake or were gathered at a site considered a
legitimate military target. "We don't even know if they were hit by
U.S. weapons," Merriman said. "They could have been hit by fire we
were taking from antiaircraft" guns.</TE>
<TE>   Victims and local Afghan officials said coalition forces may have
mistaken celebratory gunshots from a wedding for hostile fire. Most
Afghan men own guns, and firing rounds at the conclusion of almost
any festive gathering is local tradition.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. military officials greeted that explanation with
skepticism, saying it's unlikely that small-arms fire would be
confused with the antiaircraft rounds reported by the AC-130's pilot.</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, U.S. Central Command said bombers had
"struck several ground targets including antiaircraft artillery sites
that were engaging the aircraft."</TE>
<TE>   Further, some military officials said that Al Qaeda has encouraged
civilians near the scene of any bombing to insist that they were
taking part in a peaceful gathering such as a wedding.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been used before," Compton said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the incident was the latest in a war in which conservative
estimates of civilian casualties already exceeded 1,000. And U.S.
warplanes recently killed a number of Canadian soldiers after
mistaking rounds from a training exercise for hostile fire.</TE>
<TE>   It is at least the fourth time since last fall that American
military operations have led to significant civilian casualties in
Oruzgan. In one attack, Hamid Karzai, now Afghanistan's president,
was injured, and in another a number of his supporters were killed.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement broadcast on the BBC Dari service, Karzai kept his
comments to a minimum, apparently waiting for the official report
from the investigatory team. He said that he did not yet know the
number of casualties.</TE>
<TE>   The Oruzgan area has long had a double identity. The population,
largely from the Pushtun ethnic group, includes many former Taliban
as well as supporters of Karzai and the American effort to oust the
Taliban. The United States believes that Taliban leader Mullah
Mohammed Omar might have found refuge there.</TE>
<TE>   The incident could present an uncomfortable early test for
Karzai's fledgling government. While Afghans generally are supportive
of the American effort to oust the Taliban and hunt down Al Qaeda
operatives, there is also a certain unease that the Americans appear
to be running their own war with little consultation with the Afghan
government.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai, who has relied on the Americans for political, diplomatic
and financial support, now finds himself in the difficult position of
either defending his foreign friends or criticizing the country that
has helped put him in power.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin reported from Kabul and Miller from Washington.</TE>

<HD>NATO Pledges to Stay in Bosnia</HD>
<DH>Europe: Even if U.N. mission ends because of Washington's
veto, alliance says, it will keep its peacekeepers in the Balkan
nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY and SENAD SLATINA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina</DL>
<LD>NATO said Monday that it is committed to continued peacekeeping
operations here even if a dispute over the new International Criminal
Court forces an end to the U.N. mission in the Balkan nation.</LD>
<LD>   But government and international officials said a U.S. veto Sunday
of a renewed mandate for the U.N. operation threatens to undo some of
the accomplishments of seven years of international efforts at
nation-building.</LD>
<LD>   In a confrontation over demands by the United States that its
citizens be exempt from the jurisdiction of the world's first
permanent war crimes tribunal, which formally came into existence
Monday, America on Sunday at the U.N. Security Council vetoed a
routine extension of the U.N. mission here. The mission's main focus
is to create a professional police department of 20,000 that would
serve as Bosnia-Herzegovina's primary security force, eventually
replacing the foreign peacekeeping troops now stationed here.</LD>
<TE>   The veto also raised widespread questions about the future of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization-led peacekeeping force. The
alliance sought to dispel those doubts Monday after a hastily called
meeting in Brussels.</TE>
<TE>   "The alliance remains fully committed to Bosnia-Herzegovina, based
on the Dayton [peace] accords," NATO spokesman Robert Pszczel said.
"The allies are fully confident that there is a strong and very valid
mandate" for the 18,000-strong peacekeeping operation, known as SFOR,
he added.</TE>
<TE>   The main international administrative structure in Bosnia, the
Office of the High Representative, headed by Paddy Ashdown, also
derives its authority over Bosnian political and government matters
from the 1995 Dayton peace deal. Its mandate is not threatened by the
U.S. veto of a six-month extension of the U.N. mission, but its work
could be made more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute raised fears among ordinary people in Bosnia that
warfare could erupt if international administrators, police and
soldiers are withdrawn too soon.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still thousands of war criminals at large in this
country, and they are just waiting for them to leave," said Amir
Muratovic, 64, a retired locksmith. "I feel there would be war again
without them. Without them, this country is very fragile."</TE>
<TE>   Bosnia is still torn by ethnic hatreds among Muslims, Croats and
Serbs after the 1992-95 war. The United Nations' 1,500-strong police
training mission, which includes 46 U.S. members, has tried to
promote multiethnic cooperation and weed out police officers tainted
by war crimes, corruption or incompetence. But U.N. officials say
local police remain undisciplined, disorganized and probably
incapable of maintaining law and order during critical national
elections scheduled for October.</TE>
<TE>   After the U.S. veto, the Security Council agreed Sunday night to
extend the U.N. mission by 72 hours. Diplomats said this was to give
leaders of the international effort time to reorganize its
operations.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Firm on Court</TE>
<TE>   U.S. diplomats at the United Nations said Monday that the American
position on the international court and the Bosnia mission would not
change, though the Security Council has scheduled formal
consultations today.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be very disruptive, it's clear, no matter what is done,"
said Fred Eckhard, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</TE>
<TE>   If the mission was dismantled, the General Assembly would need to
appropriate special funds "for the orderly phasing out of the
mission," including compensation for canceled job and supply
contracts. The costs could run "into the millions of dollars,"
Eckhard said.</TE>
<TE>   Ashdown, the highest-ranking international official in Bosnia,
spoke with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell for 10 minutes Monday
to express concern about the veto, Ashdown's office said.</TE>
<TE>   Ashdown "said he hoped the U.S. administration would not do
anything that placed at risk the huge progress toward peace and
stability that Bosnia and Herzegovina has achieved since the war,"
the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Jacques Klein, head of the U.N. police training mission, said
Monday that he hoped members of the Security Council will realize
that "we're basically shooting ourselves in the foot" if the mission
is ended.</TE>
<TE>   He warned that the rule of law in Bosnia could be weakened, that
SFOR soldiers could be drawn into police work and that refugees might
be deterred from returning to their homes.</TE>
<TE>   As for the October election, he asked: "What message are you
sending to the nationalist parties three months before the elections?
Does this undermine the moderates? What does it say about the
commitment of the international community to consolidate peace in
Bosnia-Herzegovina or throughout the Balkans?"</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. effort to monitor and mentor local police was scheduled
to be taken over by the European Union on Jan. 1, and some officials
said Monday that it is possible the takeover could be
accelerated--but that it seemed unlikely it could be moved up to
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "To decide in a matter of days to advance this by half a year
looks to me logistically tight and quite difficult," said EU
spokesman Gunnar Wiegand.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. also has endorsed the military peacekeeping operation set
up by the Dayton accords. There are varying interpretations of
whether that approval, also ended by the U.S. veto, is necessary for
SFOR to have a valid mandate.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released by the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo, the
Bosnian capital, Washington stressed that the veto in no way
undermined the peacekeeping force. There are 2,500 U.S. troops in
SFOR.</TE>
<TE>   But some NATO members also face questions about whether their
forces can legally participate in SFOR without U.N. approval. Jochen
Cholin, a spokesman for the German Defense Ministry, said German

<TE>   In Washington, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said
Monday that the Bush administration "strongly supports Bosnian
peacekeeping" but that the international court could threaten U.S.
diplomats and military personnel.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very important matter of principle about protecting
Americans who uniquely serve around the globe in peacekeeping
efforts," Fleischer said. "The world should make no mistake the
United States will stand strong and stand on principle to do what's
right to protect our citizens."</TE>
<TE>   The new court will try suspects charged with genocide, crimes
against humanity and war crimes committed on or after July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Bosnian Foreign Ministry spokesman Amer Kapetanovic expressed
concern that if the U.N. mission is ended, his government will not be
able to make up for the loss of support for improved police work.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not have human resources and financial resources to fill
that gap," Kapetanovic said. A particular problem would be a
weakening of the effort to build up a border service, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "That is very important because without a strong, well-equipped
border service, we cannot cope with human trafficking and illegal
immigrants," he said.</TE>

<LD>   Chile's Supreme Court ruled that Augusto Pinochet can't be put on
trial because of his mental problems, a decision that will probably
end the 86-year-old former dictator's legal troubles.</LD>
<TE>   The court cited the mental health problems of Pinochet, who
suffers from dementia, as the reason for its decision. He also
suffers from diabetes and arthritis, has a pacemaker and has had at
least three mild strokes since 1998.</TE>

a military death squad after seizing power in a bloody coup in 1973.</TE>

engagement to enable swifter response to any North Korean
hostilities. Under current rules, South Korean navy boats must give
loudspeaker warnings, try to ram invading vessels out and fire
warning shots before firing on infiltrators.</TE>

white flesh, was produced by a rare tree named Xiyuangualu.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Oil Official Wanted in Mexico Tries to Surrender</HD>
<DH>Corruption: Houston authorities refuse to arrest a man
charged in election scandal case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>The former director of Mexico's state oil monopoly, a fugitive in the
country's most politically charged corruption scandal, walked into a
Texas courtroom and offered to surrender Monday, saying he could get
a fairer hearing in the United States than at home.</LD>
<LD>   Five hours later he walked away free, thanks to confusion over
whether Mexico had ever asked for his arrest.</LD>
<LD>   Rogelio Montemayor has been wanted since May 3, when the Mexican
government charged him and three former associates with embezzlement
and misuse of public funds. They were accused of diverting about $170
million from the company, Pemex, to the failed 2000 presidential
campaign of the then-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI.</LD>
<TE>   The case, known as "Pemexgate," is President Vicente Fox's biggest
corruption probe since his election two years ago ended the PRI's
71-year rule. It is the first major test of Fox's campaign pledge to
root out government corruption and punish those responsible for past
misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   But Monday's surprise maneuver by the high-profile suspect
embarrassed the Fox government and caught U.S. officials off guard.</TE>
<TE>   The 54-year-old PRI operative showed up at federal district court
in Houston, trying to force an extradition battle against Mexican
prosecutors. His lawyer filed a motion claiming the charges "are not
only political, they are also false."</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents and federal marshals refused to arrest Montemayor,
however, saying they had no such request from Mexico. Mexican
officials insisted that they had issued one May 21..</TE>
<TE>   "We told [U.S. authorities] that if anything should come up, if
they have a warrant, please give us a call and we'd come back down,"
said Mike DeGeurin, Montemayor's Houston lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Once that happens, Mexican prosecutors will have to go before a
U.S. federal judge to show cause why Montemayor should be sent home
for trial. The defense motion argues that he "cannot be extradited
for a politically motivated prosecution."</TE>
<TE>   "If there is no probable cause shown here, we believe the charges
in Mexico will fall," DeGeurin said.</TE>
<TE>   The former Pemex executives are accused of funneling company money
to the Pemex oil workers union and then to PRI candidate Francisco
Labastida's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Pemex is Mexico's biggest moneymaker, one of the world's largest
oil companies and the leading source of Mexican government revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The Pemex union was among the PRI's most important sources of
votes and financing for decades. The PRI, founded in 1929, was akin
to a branch of government. Public officials were forced to join, and
the dividing line between its budget and that of the government was
vague.</TE>
<TE>   Montemayor, a former governor of Coahuila state with no background
in the oil business, was appointed to lead the company in 1999. In a
written statement, the former executive insisted that his decisions
at Pemex "were at all times made following the law."</TE>
<TE>   "My resolve is to prove my innocence and the innocence of those
who worked with me," Montemayor declared. He said he feared for his
safety in Mexico because officials there had created "a lynch mob
environment" that endangered his relatives, who he says have been
harassed.</TE>
<TE>   The former executive was in the United States at the time the
charges were filed. Mexican police have since searched his home.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to get to the bottom of this no matter what the
consequences," Fox said last week.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's anti-corruption campaign has shown few results. Early in his
term, officials twice announced that they had unearthed tens of
millions of dollars in PRI government salary payments to people who
performed no work--only to be disproved. Some political analysts
suspect that the Pemex case, based on the word of two unidentified
witnesses, is shaky.</TE>
<TE>   "If this case doesn't stand up, it's going to cost Fox dearly in
terms of credibility," said Mexican political scientist Alfonso
Zarate.</TE>
<TE>   It has already cost him in Congress, where the PRI holds a
plurality in both houses and has blocked much of the president's
reform agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "A conviction will enhance Fox's standing with the public but
won't solve his problem in Congress," said George W. Grayson, a
Mexico specialist at the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg,
Va.</TE>

<HD>Moscow Catholics Locked Out of Their House of Worship</HD>
<DH>Russia: Building has been under state control since the
Soviet era. Now the religious minority wants it back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MOSCOW--The imposing pale yellow building with the Soviet stars on
its cornices is officially known as the Coal Industry Machine
Building Design and Research Institute Joint Stock Co.</LD>
<LD>   But to the robed papal nuncio who raised his chalice this week
before a congregation of 400 faithful kneeling on the wet pavement
outside its doors, the structure was, is and forever shall be the
Roman Catholic Church of Sts. Peter and Paul.</LD>
<LD>   More than a decade after the Soviet Union collapsed, a quiet
battle of wills continues over control of the church. The
150-year-old structure located in the center of Moscow once served
the capital's large ethnic German and Polish Catholic populations.
During the Communist era, the church was stripped of its crosses and
ornaments, nationalized and turned into a movie house and then into
offices for the Soviet Union's thoroughly atheistic national coal
monopoly. Now the Catholics want it back.</LD>
<TE>   Despite promises that churches would be returned to their rightful
owners after the Soviet collapse, a string of court decisions,
apparent bureaucratic indifference and opposition from powerful
Russian institutions have stymied the Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   A Mass was celebrated on the structure's porch Sunday for the
feast day of Peter and Paul, to symbolically restate the Catholic
claim to the building.</TE>
<TE>   "We beseech you, God, for the return of our temple," one of the
congregants intoned as the pope's representative in Russia and eight
gold-garbed priests prayed with the faithful in a service that lasted
more than an hour. The service ended with a symbolic procession
around the building.</TE>
<TE>   Among those making the procession was Jadwiga Sinitsyna, 67, a
pensioner who was baptized in the church in October 1934 and hopes to
worship inside it again before she dies.</TE>
<TE>   The struggle for the property is part of a larger question for the
Catholic Church in Russia: how it can eke out a place for itself in a
country where many Orthodox Christians regard it as a dangerous
interloper, trying to impose the values of Western Christianity on
the Slavic heartland.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest sign of tension Monday, the Orthodox Patriarchate
issued a statement saying a recent decision to set up Roman Catholic
dioceses in Russia amounted to a violation of understandings between
the two churches. It accused the Catholic Church of poaching
believers and of activities "aimed at expanding the Catholic presence
in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Tension between Catholics and Orthodox burst into the open in
February when the Vatican decided to change what had been called
"apostolic administrations'' in Russia into four full-fledged
dioceses.</TE>
<TE>   The Orthodox Church was livid, declaring the move an invasion of
its "canonical territory" even though there are far fewer than 1
million Catholics among Russia's 144 million people. The Orthodox
patriarch, Alexi II, labeled the Vatican a "foreign government" bent
on setting up "illegal government structures" on Russian soil.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath, Catholic parishes became targets for
demonstrations. Some foreign clerics, including Polish-born Bishop
Jerzy Mazur, found themselves cut off from their flocks when they
were stripped of visas and denied entry to Russia. The Vatican says
it never received an explanation for Mazur's expulsion, or even a
reply to its appeal for his reinstatement.</TE>
<TE>   Although Russian law gives no preference to the Orthodox faith,
other Christian groups have long complained of discrimination and say
that state officials are inclined to carry out the wishes of the
Orthodox hierarchy. During his visit to Russia in May, President Bush
made a point of meeting with Catholic Archbishop Tadeusz
Kondrusiewicz at the U.S. ambassador's residence.</TE>
<TE>   Geraldine Fagan, Moscow correspondent for the Keston News Service,
which monitors religious issues in the former Soviet bloc, said that
Catholic efforts to regain property such as the Peter and Paul church
will be affected by the Orthodox clergy's anti-Catholic campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "It could go either way," she said, adding that authorities may be
influenced to act against the Catholic Church's requests. Or, if
there is a feeling that "the whole anti-Catholic thing has gone too
far," Catholics might actually benefit from the attention and receive
the former church building.</TE>
<TE>   The structure continued serving as a church for 20 years after the
1917 Bolshevik Revolution. It was transformed into a movie house
before being given to the coal industry. In 1991, Moscow authorities
indicated that the Catholics could get the building back. But that
decision was effectively overruled on the federal level. Instead, in
1994, the structure became an asset of the newly privatized coal
institute, known by the cumbersome Russian acronym Giprouglemash.</TE>
<TE>   Roman Catholics' hopes of getting the building back hinge on a
court review of whether that privatization was conducted legally,
since it involved a structure of cultural importance.</TE>
<TE>   Father Bogdan Sewerynik, a priest from Poland who has been titular
pastor of the parish for three years, said that land for the church
was donated by a Catholic parishioner in the 1830s and that the
property was built "to be a church for centuries to come."</TE>
<TE>   He himself has never been allowed inside the building, which long
ago was divided into a warren of dark little offices for the
institute. The only concession to the Catholics, said Sewerynik, is
to permit services on its doorstep each June in recent years to mark
the Peter and Paul feast day.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess they do not mind it once a year," the priest said.</TE>
<TE>   Boris K. Myshlyayev, the recently retired director of
Giprouglemash, said the Catholics might as well give up.</TE>
<TE>   "The Giprouglemash Joint Stock Co. is the only legal owner of the
premises and is not planning to hand it over to the Catholic Church
or to anyone else,'' Myshlyayev said. "We own the building, and there
are no two ways about it."</TE>
<TE>   He hinted that the real reason that Catholics were never able to
reacquire the property is because it is situated close to the
Lubyanka, the headquarters of the Federal Security Service, or FSB,
the successor to the Soviet KGB.</TE>
<TE>   "The Catholics can write petitions to anyone they want--to the
Moscow authorities, to the pope or even to God himself if they know
the right address--but they will never get the building back because
they will never beat the FSB, which would not like Roman Catholics
right next to its headquarters," he said. "What is so special about
this building for them? It does not even look like a church anymore."</TE>
<TE>   According to Sewerynik, Catholics need more places of worship in
Moscow, and so far the city authorities have not come up with any
workable alternatives. In all of Moscow, there are only two churches
to serve an estimated 40,000 Roman Catholic believers. The diocese
would like to have at least three more churches.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't lose hope," said Sewerynik about the struggle over the
church of Saints Peter and Paul.</TE>
<TE>   "God sees what is going on and eventually he will help us.
However, I cannot say for sure how long God will choose to first
teach us patience."</TE>

<HD>Bronfman Family Had Fill of Messier</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As their legendary family fortune dwindled along with the price of
Vivendi Universal shares, Edgar Bronfman Jr. and the Bronfman family
emerged as key players in the undoing of the company's
once-unchallenged leader.</LD>
<LD>   The Bronfmans, who control 5% of the French company, orchestrated
a board rebellion that led to the forced resignation of Vivendi
Chairman Jean-Marie Messier. The family blames Messier for the
evaporation of more than $1 billion in its holding since Vivendi
purchased the Bronfmans' Seagram Co. two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The Bronfman clan hopes to not only undo the financial damage but
also restore a bit of its lost pride as descendants of a Canadian
liquor dynasty started by Edgar Bronfman Jr.'s grandfather, Sam
Bronfman.</LD>
<TE>   A fierce Montreal patriarch, Sam Bronfman took advantage of the
Prohibition years in the United States, launching what would become
the dominant liquor distribution business in North America. Edgar
Bronfman Sr. refers to his father in his autobiography as a "driven,
insecure person" who dominated a loveless home.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Bronfman didn't ask but ordered his elder son, Edgar, to take
his place at the helm of Seagram. His other son, Charles, would
become the company co-chairman. Sam's only daughter, Phyllis, was the
family artist and the force behind building the Mies van der
Rohe-designed Seagram Building in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, when Edgar Bronfman Sr. wanted to step down to
devote himself to humanitarian causes centered on a newfound devotion
to his Jewish faith, he too turned to his son, Edgar Jr., to take
over Seagram.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, Edgar Bronfman Jr. was drawn to Hollywood,
where he had brief experiences as a movie producer and songwriter. In
the spring of 1995, the younger Bronfman persuaded the family to buy
control of MCA, the parent company of Universal Studios, from
Japanese electronics giant Matsushita Electric Industrial.</TE>
<TE>   From his first move in Hollywood, Bronfman drew fire. MCA's
venerated chairman, Lew Wasserman, who had remained in charge of the
studio, learned of the deal after it was done. Bronfman continued to
slight Wasserman, failing to invite the Hollywood luminary to
meetings or consult with him about the company.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood dismissed Bronfman as a dilettante. His efforts to
revamp a studio management system created by Wasserman were
ridiculed. He was derided for his complicated deal to transfer
control of Universal's television operations to Barry Diller.</TE>
<TE>   Under Bronfman's watch, Universal Studios foundered, releasing
such box-office bombs as "Babe: Pig in the City" and "Meet Joe
Black."</TE>
<TE>   By the time Messier arrived in mid-2000, Bronfman seemed to have
given up on his Hollywood dreams, avoiding the press and shunning any
serious public role.</TE>
<TE>   Bronfman remained an executive with Vivendi Universal until early
this spring. A week before he was to vacate his office, he signaled a
growing dissatisfaction with Messier, saying the French executive
"has no choice but to create credibility on Wall Street ... or there
will be other leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Less than three months later, Bronfman was called upon by his
fellow board members to monitor the performance of a man he would
help to unseat.</TE>

<HD>TRW Board Agrees to Takeover by Northrop</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: $7.8-billion deal would create the world's
second-largest defense contractor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp. agreed Monday to acquire TRW Inc. for $7.8
billion in a deal that would create the world's second-largest arms
contractor and heighten competition amid a new era of growth for the
defense industry.</LD>
<LD>   The merger would provide Century City-based Northrop with the
broadest portfolio of products in the defense industry, including
nuclear aircraft carriers, secret eavesdropping satellites,
space-based lasers, unmanned spy planes, Navy destroyers, airborne
radars, battle management software and thousands of electronic
systems.</LD>
<LD>   TRW's directors voted unanimously to accept a friendly pact after
Northrop offered to raise its initial hostile bid by nearly $2
billion. The deal caps a takeover battle that began in February.</LD>
<TE>   The acquisition, Northrop's largest and most ambitious among more
than a dozen in the last decade, would culminate its remarkable
transformation from a struggling bit player in the defense industry
to a powerhouse. In the process, it would surpass behemoth Boeing Co.
and become second in size only to rival Lockheed Martin Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "With every acquisition, the transformation has become more
complete and more compelling," said Kent Kresa, Northrop's longtime
chairman, who has presided over 15 acquisitions in the last decade.
"The future is much brighter for us now."</TE>
<TE>   With TRW's space and defense electronic operations, Northrop would
become better positioned to compete for growing defense spending. The
Pentagon's budget is expected to rise by $48 billion in fiscal 2003
to $383 billion, a growth rate not seen since the Reagan
administration's military buildup.</TE>
<TE>   Economists said the acquisition mirrored the changing fortunes of
Southern California's defense industry, which also has undergone
significant transformation. Once largely reliant on manufacturing,
the sector has refocused on technology and research.</TE>
<TE>   After years of losing manufacturing jobs, the area is experiencing
a surge in hiring for aerospace engineers.</TE>
<TE>   Given that, the deal, which would nearly double the number of
Northrop employees in the region, would solidify and could even boost
the area's position in defense-related research and development, as
Northrop funnels its considerable financial resources to TRW's
leading-edge technologies, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "I would imagine they could step in and focus the programs,
reducing risk and making the programs more profitable," said James
McAleese, a defense industry lawyer who has been advising Northrop on
the TRW transaction.</TE>
<TE>   With the addition of about 10,000 TRW employees, most of whom work
at a sprawling space and satellite technology complex in Redondo
Beach, Northrop would become the region's second-largest private
employer with its headquarters in Southern California, second only to
Burbank-based Walt Disney Co.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether people recognize it or not, we have come charging back,"
Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp., said of the aerospace industry. The deal "is kind
of exciting because just several years ago everybody thought Northrop
was takeover bait."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Lockheed Martin sought five years ago to acquire Northrop,
the last major defense contractor to be based in Los Angeles. But the
deal was scuttled because of antitrust concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most acquisitions, in which companies seek cost savings by
cutting redundant operations, Northrop said it had no plans to lay
off TRW workers in Southern California, because there is very little
overlap. Kresa said that with the country focused on beefing up
homeland security and the military, employment at TRW facilities in
the area could grow.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, TRW's Southern California operations--which also include
facilities in Carson and Orange and San Diego counties--are getting a
psychological boost from the deal because its former boss, Ronald
Sugar, is now the heir apparent at Northrop.</TE>
<TE>   Kresa is scheduled to retire next year when he turns 65, the
company's mandatory retirement age. Sugar spent most of his 20-year
career with TRW at Redondo Beach but was passed over for the top job
at TRW and bolted to Litton Industries Inc. Last year, Northrop
acquired Litton.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the acquisition could not have been better, analysts
said. The deal would bolster Northrop's position in space-based
communications, missile defense and reconnaissance at a time when
President Bush wants better technology for detecting, tracking and
capturing potential terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some Wall Street investors were nervous Monday that
Northrop may have spent too much on TRW. After making an initial
hostile bid at $47 a share, Northrop was forced to sweeten the deal
three times: to $53 and then $58 before successfully persuading TRW
directors late Sunday to consider a friendly deal at $60 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the deal, TRW shareholders would receive a higher
price if Northrop's shares were to go higher than $138 a share.
Conversely, the merger price would decline if Northrop's were to fall
below $112.</TE>
<TE>   In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Northrop fell
$6.81 to $118.19. TRW shares declined 40 cents to $56.58.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, some TRW investors seemed dissatisfied, as they
complained that the company should have held out for a better deal,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, three defense contractors--General Dynamics Corp.,
Raytheon Corp. and BAE North America--also submitted offers for TRW's
defense business, raising prospects for a bidding war.</TE>
<TE>   But sources familiar with the bidding process said TRW directors
were more interested in selling the entire company and not a portion
of it. Under the latest pact, which Northrop wants to complete by end
of the year, Northrop plans to spin off or sell TRW's debt-laden auto
parts business.</TE>
<TE>   Although few analysts believe shareholders would reject the deal,
scuttling the pact could be costly to Northrop. Should Northrop walk
away from the transaction, Kresa said it would be required to pay
$275 million to TRW.</TE>
<TE>   Some obstacles still remain. Lockheed Martin has raised antitrust
concerns with the Pentagon and Justice Department officials over the
deal, saying that the combination would hurt its competitive position
in making military satellites. But Kresa said Monday that he did not
foresee regulators requiring Northrop to shed any businesses out of
competitive concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop executives have been meeting with high-ranking Justice
and Defense officials, asserting that the deal would actually
increase competition among the large defense contractors.</TE>
<TE>   "This finally creates a third powerhouse," McAleese said.
"Historically all we've had was Lockheed and Boeing." If one firm
didn't want to bid a project, the Pentagon had to persuade the other
to do it, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition would cause two immediate casualties: employees
who work at TRW's headquarters in Cleveland and the name that has
been synonymous with some of the nation's leading aerospace research.</TE>
<TE>   Upon completing the deal, contingent on shareholder approvals,
Northrop plans to close TRW headquarters, affecting a few hundred
employees who could be offered Northrop jobs elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of the auto parts business, which Northrop
plans to sell or spin off, Northrop does not plan to keep the TRW
moniker for the remaining businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no emotional attachment to the name," said Simon Ramo, a
founder of TRW and the R in the company name. "I'm kind of happy with
the deal because the two together is more capable and worth more than
if they were separate. Names come and go."</TE>

<HD>Under Intense Pressure, Vivendi's Messier Is Forced Out as
Chairman</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: A coup led by the board and investors
convinced the Frenchman to resign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER and ANITA M. BUSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier, who stormed
Hollywood two years ago with grand plans to turn a sleepy French
water utility into a global media powerhouse only to watch his empire
suffer record losses, has succumbed to a coup engineered by investors
and board members.</LD>
<LD>   Messier's departure played out like a boardroom melodrama whose
resolution is expected to come Wednesday, when the company's board of
directors will formally approve his ouster at an emergency meeting,
said a source close to the board. The top candidate to replace him is
Jean-Rene Fourtou, deputy head of the Franco-German pharmaceutical
company Aventis.</LD>
<LD>   As a final act of defiance, Messier was said to be haggling over
the terms of his ouster, ending a tumultuous two-year run as head of
Vivendi Universal.</LD>
<TE>   "I forged this group with my team. I love it passionately. But one
truth is unavoidable. You can't manage with a divided board," Messier
told France's Le Figaro newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   That division was especially pointed for Messier, who himself
tried to bridge two distinct cultures. He set up a posh office in New
York City and relished playing the role of Manhattan philanthropist
while struggling to maintain the French identity of his company.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, he satisfied few.</TE>
<TE>   The change in leadership could have dramatic implications for
Universal Studios. Vivendi board members also have had discussions
about whether to spin it off into a separately traded company, in
part to distance it from a company whose growth strategy--combining
wireless technology with entertainment--puzzled investors and
analysts alike.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi is the third foreign-owned company that has struggled to
fit Universal Studios into its fold, after Japan's Matsushita
Electric Industrial and Canada's Seagram Co.</TE>
<TE>   The boardroom coup was led by the company's single largest
shareholder, the Bronfmans, who personally asked Messier to resign as
chairman and CEO, according to a source close to the board. But they
and others asked Messier over the weekend to either resign or face an
emergency meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The Bronfmans and a family representative, who together hold three
seats on the 14-member board, have seen their holdings lose more than
$1 billion since they sold Seagram and its Universal Studios movies,
music and theme park properties to Vivendi two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   They were infuriated last week when Messier managed to survive a
vote of confidence thanks to the support of nine French and European
backers who, despite being disenchanted with Messier in recent
months, were reluctant to side with the Bronfmans out of concern that
Messier would not be replaced with a fellow Frenchman.</TE>
<TE>   But one by one, those same French board members turned on Messier
at the urging of Claude Bebear, the influential chairman of insurer
Axa and a fierce critic of Messier's.</TE>
<TE>   The 45-year-old executive was once the toast of France and a
symbol of French pride as he pulled off the high-profile acquisition
of one of America's most famous film studios, Universal Studios, as
part of a $34-billion acquisition of Seagram and Canal Plus in
December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But Messier's attempt to build a European rival to AOL Time Warner
Inc. failed on both sides of the Atlantic. Amid poor communications
with investors, concerns about the viability of his strategy and in
the face of massive debt, the stock plummeted to a 13-year low last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Investors initially embraced the news, although their optimism was
tempered by news that the company's debt rating was downgraded to
junk status by Moody's Investor Service out of concern the company
won't be able to reduce its debt as planned.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi shares rose $2 at one point Monday before closing at
$22.45, up 95 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors are welcoming this with open arms," said George
Nichols, an analyst with Morningstar Inc. in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Although the suddenness of Messier's departure startled some
company watchers, the momentum to remove him clearly had been
building for months.</TE>
<TE>   It began with basic doubts about Messier's frenzied deal making. A
former investment banker, Messier has been on a buying spree during
the last two years, spending more than $50 billion to transform a
149-year-old French water utility into one of the world's largest
entertainment companies.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to buying Seagram's Universal music, movie and theme
park properties, Vivendi acquired European pay television and movie
production company Canal Plus, U.S. education publisher Houghton
Mifflin, online music service MP3.com and the film and television
businesses of USA Networks.</TE>
<TE>   An apostle of the convergence between new and old media, Messier
also believed that cell phones and the Internet would be key
pipelines for movies, music and games.</TE>
<TE>   But that strategy flopped on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   "The message hasn't been clear or justified," said Mark
Harrington, an analyst with J.P. Morgan Chase. "There was a high
degree of confusion over what the strategy is."</TE>
<TE>   Messier made too many bets on the digital future rather than
developing a single, coherent strategy, said George T. Geis, an
adjunct professor at UCLA's Anderson School and co-author of "Digital
Deals."</TE>
<TE>   Messier was particularly interested in delivering media wirelessly
to mobile devices, a capability that's just starting to emerge as
wireless networks expand in capacity.</TE>
<TE>   "Messier thought it was going to be big soon, and it's not going
to be big soon," Geis said.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond doubts about his strategy, investors also began to distrust
Messier when they had trouble figuring out Vivendi's net debt as the
company moved from French to American accounting standards. Investors
were further spooked by disclosures of unexpected liabilities that
could cost the company more than $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   While Messier was struggling to build his profile in the U.S., he
managed to alienate the French establishment that once saw him as a
corporate leader.</TE>
<TE>   The ill feeling began when Messier openly criticized the death of
France's system of film subsidies for French cinema, a touchy subject
because Vivendi's Canal Plus TV is a major financier of French
movies.</TE>
<TE>   Messier only added fuel to the fire when he dismissed popular
executive Pierre Lescure for failing to stem losses at Canal Plus.
Though welcomed by U.S. analysts, the move enraged the French
cultural elite and Canal Plus employees, who staged protests at the
company's shareholders meeting and lampooned Messier in a nationally
televised satirical puppet show.</TE>
<TE>   Although he survived the protests, Messier's handling of the
L'affaire Lescure, as it came to be known, was among the factors that
cost him key political support from some of his French allies,
including luxury goods mogul Bernard Arnault, who resigned last week
and had been a buffer against Messier's American critics on the
board.</TE>
<TE>   The CEO appeared to win a reprieve in May, when the board gave him
a mandate to slash the company's debt and created a committee,
co-chaired by Edgar Bronfman Jr., to monitor his stewardship.</TE>
<TE>   The final straw came in the last month, when French and American
board members were incensed over Messier's handling of a key
transaction to reduce a stake in its water utility, Vivendi
Environnement, and a complex stock repurchasing deal with Deutsche
Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Both transactions fueled concerns that the company was facing a
cash crunch and sent Vivendi's stock price crashing.</TE>
<TE>   The company denied facing a liquidity crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The new management team could ultimately force the breakup of the
company into French and American divisions, analysts said. One
scenario considered by the board would split Vivendi's European
businesses--Canal Plus and a 44% stake in the French telecom firm
Cegetel--from the company's American assets, primarily Universal
Studios and Universal Music Group, the world's largest music company.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is tough to find buyers for a big studio and a music business
today, with both industries suffering, said Paul J. Kim,
entertainment analyst at Kaufman Bros. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "The balance sheet will determine everything they do for the next
year, probably longer," Kim said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Thomas S. Mulligan, Corie Brown and Jon Healey
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Auto-Emission Bill OKd, Sent to Davis</HD>
<DH>Pollution: State measure seeks to reduce gases that fuel
global warming. The governor, who has taken no position, must sign or
veto within 30 days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO and CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A measure that would make California the first state to regulate
tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases narrowly cleared the
Legislature on Monday, setting up a political quandary for Gov. Gray
Davis, who must choose between the environmental groups and business
interests on opposing sides of the issue.</LD>
<LD>   The bill by Assemblywoman Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills) has major
national repercussions.</LD>
<LD>   Its goal is to reduce the release of carbon dioxide and other
gases suspected of causing global warming. But its net effect would
be tougher fuel efficiency requirements for automobiles and trucks
sold in California, because the easiest known way to reduce the
emissions is to build cars that burn less fossil fuels.</LD>
<TE>   "We all know that the impacts of global warming are real," Pavley
told the Assembly, citing studies that show that the Sierra snowpack,
the concentration of snowfall that melts during the summer and feeds
the state's streams, is shrinking because of the phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   Pavley's bill, AB 1493, does not state how emissions should be
reduced in automobiles and trucks. Rather, it directs the California
Air Resources Board to come up with regulations that "achieve the
maximum feasible reduction of greenhouse gases" by 2005. The new
standards would apply to vehicles from model year 2009 onward.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation states that the air board must balance the call
for maximum reduction with concerns over costs, and cannot ban SUVs
or any type of vehicle. Nonetheless, its lack of specificity concerns
the auto industry, which asserts that the bill could lead to the
outlawing of trucks and minivans and raise costs on all vehicles sold
in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists suffered a major defeat in Washington earlier
this year when Congress rejected tougher federal fuel efficiency
standards amid strong opposition from a coalition that included
automakers, oil companies and organized labor. But with passage of
the California law, environmentalists might win an equally important
victory in what amounts to a rematch against those same groups.</TE>
<TE>   California is the only state empowered under federal law to pass
stronger air pollution standards than those set by the federal
government. Other states can then choose California's standards, but
cannot be the first to surpass those set by the federal government.
Thus, passage of a California law eventually could spark changes in
the design of automobiles sold across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Despite strong Republican opposition, the bill cleared the
Assembly on a 41-30 vote Monday, three days after narrowly passing
the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists hailed the bill's passage, saying that it will
send a message to lawmakers in Washington. Once again, they said,
California is leading the way on automobile regulation, the way it
did with catalytic converters and unleaded gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   "Californians refuse to sacrifice their children on the altar to
oil industry profits," said Russell Long of the Bluewater Network,
one of the bill's sponsors. "There is nothing sacred about fossil
fuel."</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said the governor has not taken a
position on the measure, which he must sign or veto within 30 days.
His Republican opponent in this November's gubernatorial election,
businessman Bill Simon, has criticized the legislation, calling it an
assault on consumers' right to drive sport-utility vehicles or other
cars of their choice.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the coalition opposing the measure said the group
will lobby Davis for a veto.</TE>
<TE>   Sensing the importance of the California emissions bill, both
sides involved in the Washington fuel standards debate moved their
campaigns to California this spring--and once again, business
interests initially appeared to be winning.</TE>
<TE>   An earlier Pavley bill on the same subject, AB 1058, foundered in
the Assembly for months after opponents began waging a sophisticated
advertising campaign that warned California consumers of tax
increases and asserted that they could soon be bounced from their
beloved SUVs into flimsy, unsafe vehicles. The pitchman for many of
the ads was Cal Worthington, a folksy car dealer whose own corny
commercials made him a bit of a California cult hero.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters called the campaign wildly misleading, noting that the
tax increases it hinted at had no basis in fact. But several
lawmakers who had voted for the bill earlier changed their positions
amid the opposition assault, which resulted in thousands of calls and
e-mails to legislators' offices.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that's been sneaky has been the hot air and
noxious gases emitted by opponents of this legislation," said
Assemblyman Dario Frommer (D-Glendale).</TE>
<TE>   Recently, environmentalists struck back. Lawmakers and others
began receiving recorded messages from actor Paul Newman urging
passage of the emissions measure. Supporters enlisted Richie Ross,
one of the state's most powerful political consultants, to help
orchestrate a counter-campaign in the state Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Pavley and fellow Democrats amended another bill to
address the charges raised in the opposition campaign and to deal
with concerns of lawmakers by giving the Legislature the ability to
review the air board's recommendations before they take effect.</TE>
<TE>   A day later, as lawmakers were meeting over the weekend to pass
the state budget, Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) quickly
shepherded the new bill through the upper house.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, it was hastily approved by an Assembly committee and
then by the lower house--part of what some supporters said was a
calculated move to get the bill on Davis' desk before opponents could
launch new commercials against it. Republicans, who hold just 30 of
the Assembly's 80 seats, objected to the content of the legislation
and the tactics used to pass it. Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy
(R-Arcadia) railed against what he called the "hypocrisy" of
Democrats who supported the measure and proceeded to detail the cars
they drive, Chevy Suburbans and Jeep Cherokees among them.</TE>
<TE>   "The public was just not aware. I guess we see this once again as
an example of the way we do business in this Legislature," said
Assemblyman George Runner (R-Lancaster).</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the way we should be doing business, in the dead of
night--on the weekend."</TE>

<KH>THE SECESSION QUESTION</KH>
<HD>Hollywood Not Ready to Split</HD>
<DH>Times poll: About 60% of voters in the area don't want to
break from L.A., saying they are generally pleased with city
services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood voters want their area to stay in Los Angeles at least as
much as the rest of the city does, with fewer than a quarter of them
favoring Hollywood secession, a Times poll shows.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, nowhere in the city, and within no category of voters,
does Hollywood independence win a majority. In Los Angeles as a
whole, 59% oppose Hollywood secession. In Hollywood, 61% are against
it.</LD>
<LD>   The deepest backing for Hollywood cityhood is in the west San
Fernando Valley, a secession stronghold, but even there it is
trailing, with just 38% support.</LD>
<TE>   Hollywood voters are generally content with life in their
neighborhoods and the quality of city services, the poll found. Where
they see problems, most don't see secession as a solution.</TE>
<TE>   They also are unhappy with the quickness with which Hollywood
secession made the Nov. 5 ballot. While Valley secession has been
discussed for decades, the Hollywood campaign, led by millionaire
nightclub owner Gene La Pietra, began quietly about 2 1/2 years ago
and received little attention until recently.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly one-third of Hollywood voters polled said they weren't
aware that their neighborhood was within the borders of the proposed
city of roughly 160,000. About four in 10 said they are upset about
being part of the secession area.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not pleased about it," Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus
said. "They feel that Hollywood is L.A. and L.A. is Hollywood.
Hollywood is right in the middle of the city and they don't feel that
it should be separated."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secession is opposed by Democrats, Republicans and
independent voters. Liberals oppose it by a 3-1 margin, and only a
third of conservatives favor it. The proposal also fails among voters
of every age group and income level, especially the poor. It loses as
well across gender lines, and among whites, Latinos and African
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   To create a city, Hollywood secessionists need to win a majority
of votes within their proposed boundaries and a majority in the city
as a whole. Leaders of the secession drive have said the Valley
cityhood campaign will help the Hollywood effort, but the poll
results show little evidence of that.</TE>
<TE>   The poll was conducted June 20-28. It surveyed 1,291 registered
voters citywide, with a margin of sampling error of 3 percentage
points in either direction. The survey included 120 registered voters
in Hollywood, with a margin of sampling error of 9 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Across Los Angeles, voters view Hollywood secession more
negatively than they do Valley secession. Outside the Valley and
Hollywood, two-thirds of city voters come out against Hollywood's
independence bid, while just over half oppose a Valley breakaway.</TE>
<TE>   "With the Valley, there's a definite divider. You've got the
mountains. You've got Mulholland Drive. There's a physical,
geographical division," said John Murphy, 27, a Los Feliz wardrobe
stylist and poll respondent who supports secession by the Valley, but
not Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood is just so much more in the heart of Los Angeles. I
just believe Hollywood is historically part of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, as in the Valley, secessionists have complained that
the city does not give their area its "fair share" of services.</TE>
<TE>   Asked which area the city treats unfairly, 42% of Valley voters
named the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, only 10% of Hollywood voters said the city treats
Hollywood unfairly. Meanwhile, a quarter of Hollywood voters said the
city is unfair to South-Central Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to name the worst problem facing their area, Hollywood
voters chose traffic first (12%), followed closely by crime and poor
schools (each 11%). Asked whether secession would solve what they
consider to be the biggest problem, 57% said it would not.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Hollywood voters said they see major downsides
to seceding--with 46% saying Hollywood's secession would hurt the
rest of the city, and 61% saying that they would end up paying more
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "As things stand, I'm perfectly happy with the way things are. I
don't see any problems. We all get the [garbage] pickup and all the
service we need," said Roslyn Shapiro, 83, who could watch sheep
grazing in a meadow across from her home when she first moved to the
Hollywood Hills 51 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Our only problem is traffic, and it would be hard to see how that
would be better if we secede. I don't think breaking up the city is
the way to get better services. I think taxes will have to go up."</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Michelson, 24, who rents an apartment in Hollywood, said he
had heard of Valley secession on the radio but didn't know his area
could wind up outside of Los Angeles until he got a call from the
Times pollster. Michelson said he had no problem with city services.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really conscious of it, and that's probably a good thing.
I mean the garbage gets picked up. I've never been mugged and needed
the police," he said. If anything, he said, laughing, the city's
parking enforcement officers work too efficiently.</TE>
<TE>   As for the idea of secession in general, he said: "My initial
reaction was, 'Oh, that's selfish of Hollywood, wanting to separate.'
I always thought that Los Angeles was the sum of its parts."</TE>

<HD>$9.6-Billion Make-Over for LAX?</HD>
<DH>Travel: Mayor's plan seeks to ease congestion and boost
security--but not increase capacity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aging Los Angeles International Airport would be transformed by a
$9.6-billion modernization effort that would dramatically alter the
airfield, ban traffic in the central terminal area and rely on an
elevated train to link LAX with new facilities to the east, according
to a plan to be unveiled today.</LD>
<LD>   Although it would add little capacity, the sweeping plan seeks to
curb long lines and traffic congestion at LAX by building more
terminal space and encouraging passengers to use mass transit. It
also calls for runway modifications to guard against accidents or
near misses and to prepare for the 555-seat Airbus A380.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor James K. Hahn will outline the much-anticipated proposal
this morning in a ceremony at LAX.</LD>
<TE>   "The airport doesn't work," Hahn said Monday. "We need to do this
now so the airport can function in an efficient way without coming to
a standstill."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's proposal calls for a massive demolition effort that
would eliminate four terminals and parking garages in the central
terminal area. Futuristic, multilevel terminals, complete with
concrete basements for bomb technicians to check suspicious bags,
would be built in the middle of the airport's horseshoe-shaped
roadway.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would seek to cap airport traffic at 78 million
passengers a year, in part by eliminating 11 gates. Limiting capacity
would put additional pressure on the region's other
airports--including John Wayne International Airport, Long Beach
Airport and Ontario International Airport--to accommodate more
passengers.</TE>
<TE>   City officials outlined the proposal, which they hope to complete
in phases over 10 years, in an exclusive briefing with The Times. It
will take two years for the city to finish environmental studies,
hold public hearings and present the plan to various agencies,
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's proposal, known among his staff as the fifth alternative,
will be added to former Mayor Richard Riordan's existing master
plan--which identifies four alternatives--in an effort to piggyback
on existing environmental studies.</TE>
<TE>   The Airport Commission, the City Council and the Federal Aviation
Administration would all need to approve the plan before construction
could begin.</TE>
<TE>   The airlines would pay for about half of the renovation through
higher rents and landing fees, with the remainder coming from a $1.50
fee added to passenger tickets, from federal transportation funds and
from bonds financed by income from airport concessionaires.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, the plan would be among the most expensive public
works projects in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a divergence from just about every airport in the world,"
said C. Nicholas Johnson, a director at Landrum &amp; Brown, a consulting
firm hired to design the plan. "The only way you're going to be able
to deal with the new paradigm we face in security is with space."</TE>
<TE>   Space is Tight</TE>
<TE>   At LAX, space is a luxury. City officials have spent $103 million
and eight years trying to come up with a politically palatable way to
modernize the 3,500-acre airport. Hahn's plan, which emphasizes
safety and security over expansion, is the 33rd blueprint developed
by the city agency that operates LAX. The mayor first announced his
vision for LAX a few weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would make LAX more secure by banning most
traffic--and thus the potential for a bomb in a car or truck--from
the central terminal area, city officials say.</TE>
<TE>   It would also provide more room for explosive-detection equipment
mandated by new federal aviation security laws.</TE>
<TE>   For the last several months, rumors have swirled around Hahn's
plan as city officials attempted to build a consensus for it by
briefing residents and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   After the briefings, one thing was clear: Residents who opposed
Riordan's $12-billion plan to expand LAX applaud Hahn's early
efforts, while airlines and businesses that endorsed Riordan's vision
are leery of the new blueprint.</TE>
<TE>   Local residents approve because officials eliminated a new
terminal at the airport's west end and a road circling LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines worry that the plan costs too much and adds too little
capacity, and that new facilities near the San Diego Freeway will
inconvenience passengers.</TE>
<TE>   A Tough Sell</TE>
<TE>   City officials admit that the plan is going to be a hard sell with
the airlines.</TE>
<TE>   "The ... road show went to the airlines and there were certain
things we had to tell them to get a grip on," said Airport Commission
President Ted Stein.</TE>
<TE>   "No. 1, this mayor is not going to allow this plan to be designed
for more than 78 million annual passengers. No. 2, there will not be
a fifth runway. And No. 3, instead of having more gates, you're going
to have less. But, by the way, we're going to ask you to help pay for
this."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor will release color-coded maps today that fill in some
details of the plan. But many questions linger. Chief among them is
how Hahn will follow through on a promise to limit LAX to 78 million
passengers a year.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents say they can cap operations by providing fewer parking
spaces for aircraft and by encouraging airlines to bring
international flights to LAX and take commuter flights to other
regional facilities. But the carriers control flight schedules and
have made it clear that they don't want to shift flights away from
LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Industry experts say taking away gates for aircraft would add to
the overcrowding at LAX and would not provide an incentive for
airlines to take flights elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Decreasing gates will only make matters worse," said George
Donohue, a professor at George Mason University who studies capacity
at the nation's airports. "Re-regulation will be required at the
federal level to provide the airlines incentives to use larger
aircraft and to make better utilization of regional airports like
Ontario, Long Beach and John Wayne."</TE>
<TE>   City officials say that even though the plan would remove gates,
it would provide efficiencies for the airlines that save time and
money. Officials say they also added several features to the plan at
the airlines' request, including a $900-million taxiway near
Sepulveda Boulevard and a $1-billion underground baggage system.</TE>
<TE>   Some key elements of the proposal:</TE>
<TE>   * A transit center at Aviation Boulevard and Imperial Highway
would connect airport facilities to the Green Line.</TE>
<TE>   * Parking Lot B would be expanded and several new streets built on
airport property to siphon traffic away from Century and Sepulveda
boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   * A check-in facility--called a "ground transportation center" in
Hahn's plan--would be constructed on 129 acres at Manchester Square.
The center would feature three multilevel parking structures and two
buildings where passengers could obtain boarding passes and check
bags with skycaps. An underground system would ferry bags to the
airport for screening.</TE>
<TE>   * Parking Lot C would be converted to a facility that would
consolidate area rental car businesses.</TE>
<TE>   * An elevated train would connect the transit center, Lot B, the
check-in facility and the consolidated rental car facility. It would
run from Imperial Highway across airport property to Manchester
Square, and then split into two lines that run down 98th Street and
Century Boulevard into the central terminal area.</TE>
<TE>   * Several new terminals would be constructed in the central
terminal area to replace Terminals 1, 2, 3 and 8. These
facilities--preliminary drawings show them tied together with an
enormous roof over the entire central terminal area--would feature an
array of shops, restaurants and possibly a movie theater or hotel, in
a space twice as large as Universal CityWalk, said Johnson, the
consultant. Passengers would go through screening here.</TE>
<TE>   * FlyAway buses only would be allowed in the central terminal
area. Rental car shuttles would be eliminated. Taxis, limos and other
shuttles would drop off passengers at Manchester Square.</TE>
<TE>   * A new concourse behind the Tom Bradley International Terminal
would be connected to the central terminal area by an underground
people-mover. Gates at the new concourse would replace those at the
four demolished terminals. A new 12,000-space employee parking lot
would be built on the airport's western edge.</TE>
<TE>   * Both sets of parallel runways would be moved farther apart to
deal with near misses at LAX. The runway nearest the terminals on the
north side would move 340 feet closer to the airport and be extended
by 1,000 feet. The runway nearest El Segundo on the south side would
move 50 feet closer to homes and businesses. Parallel taxiways would
be built down the center of each set of runways.</TE>
<TE>   * Several new sets of taxiways would be constructed to link the
north and south sides of the airfield. These taxiways would benefit
the airlines by shortening taxi and idle times, thus decreasing
aircraft emissions, Stein said.</TE>
<TE>   Unanswered Questions</TE>
<TE>   Even with these new details, many questions remain. City officials
are unsure how much passenger screening would be done at the ground
transportation facility. In addition, the new federal Transportation
Security Administration, which sets security protocols, has yet to
review the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Also open to question is whether Hahn can legally use parts of
existing environmental studies, and how the new plan would affect the
surrounding communities by transferring thousands of vehicles a day
from the central terminal area to Manchester Square.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, because the mayor's proposal will be added to
Riordan's existing master plan, the City Council would still have the
option of approving any one of the larger document's five
alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   "The new plan looks better than the old plan," said Los Angeles
County Supervisor Don Knabe, who also heads the Southern California
Regional Airport Authority. "But the problem is that the old plan is
still on the table."</TE>

<KH>THE SECESSION QUESTION</KH>
<HD>Voters Oppose Breaking Up Los Angeles</HD>
<DH>Times poll: The margin is wide on Hollywood secession.
Independence is popular in the Valley, but not enough to carry the
citywide vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A month into the campaign over secession, voters citywide are leaning
against breaking the San Fernando Valley away from Los Angeles and
overwhelmingly oppose independence for Hollywood, according to a Los
Angeles Times poll.</LD>
<LD>   Secession remains popular in the Valley. After hearing a
summary of arguments for and against secession, voters there said they
favor a split from Los Angeles, 52% to 37%. But strong resistance in the
rest of Los Angeles would lead Valley independence to defeat in the
citywide vote, the poll found.</LD>
<LD>   If the election were held today, Valley secession would lose
citywide, with 38% in favor and 47% opposed. Hollywood secession
would lose 25% to 59% citywide and by at least that much in the
proposed Hollywood city, according to the poll. Under the rules
governing the proposed breakup, secession requires a majority vote
both in the area that would leave the city and in Los Angeles as a
whole.</LD>
<TE>   The survey indicates that a central battleground for the next four
months of campaigning will be the portion of the Valley east of the
San Diego Freeway. It also suggests that overall attitudes toward
government and local control, rather than specific issues such as
taxes, are likely to drive the result. Virtually no one surveyed, for
example, believes that secession will lead to lower taxes, as some
advocates have claimed. Many Valley residents say they will vote for
secession anyway because they believe their portion of the city has
been treated unfairly over the years.</TE>
<TE>   As an alternative to secession, the City Council is weighing a
ballot measure that would split Los Angeles into boroughs to provide
local management of trash pickup, some zoning issues and other
services. The poll found a majority of voters favor putting a borough
plan on the ballot. But at this point, only 36% would vote for it,
and 42% would oppose it.</TE>
<TE>   The poll, supervised by Times poll director Susan Pinkus, was
conducted by telephone from June 20 to 28. It surveyed 1,291
registered voters citywide with a sampling error of 3 percentage
points in either direction. The survey included 576 Valley voters
with a 4 percentage-point margin of sampling error.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, as voters decide whether to make Los Angeles the first
big city in America to break itself into smaller pieces, they feel
upbeat about life in the city as it is, the poll found. By 62% to
33%, those surveyed say things are going well in Los Angeles, a view
shared by a majority of voters in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Valley Feels Overlooked and Underserved</TE>
<TE>   What drives many secession backers is a feeling that the
Valley gets less than its fair share of city services and attention, a
belief held by 42% of voters in the Valley. Few voters elsewhere in
the city say the Valley is short-changed; many pick South-Central as
the one section of the city that is discriminated against.</TE>
<TE>   Many secession backers also argue that smaller government and
tighter local control would help solve pressing problems.</TE>
<TE>   To Irene Langton, a poll respondent and Studio City resident since
1941, it boils down to the city's failure to clear clogged storm
drains on her block.</TE>
<TE>   "We have complained and complained, and nothing happens," said
Langton, a retired high school teacher. "A Valley city would be the
sixth-largest city in the country, and if L.A. treats it so
shabbily--which they do--we might as well try it on our own.</TE>
<TE>   "My political experience has been, the closer the voter gets
to the people who make the laws and enforce them, the more likely you
are to get service, to get something to happen," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Valley residents like Langton are the group most prone to
favor secession.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Valley, voters in every section of Los Angeles favor
keeping the city intact.</TE>
<TE>   "This is getting to be like the Civil War, where you've just got
to stand up and say what's right," said Diane Lamont, a library
assistant who lives on the Westside. A breakup, she said, "would hurt
everyone in the long run."</TE>
<TE>   So far, more than 3 out of 5 city voters say they have made up
their minds on Valley secession. Over the 18-week campaign ahead,
supporters and opponents of a breakup intend to spend millions of
dollars on television ads to sway the roughly one-third who remain
ambivalent--voters like Theresa Albanese, a Chatsworth resident since
1964.</TE>
<TE>   Albanese said she leans toward secession because public schools
are bad, taxes are too high, and City Hall neglects the Valley. But
she found out last month that secession would not break up the Los
Angeles Unified School District, and she has begun to worry that the
biggest city on the West Coast might "lose its identity."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting a little leery," she said. "I think it would be kind
of hard to get used to saying you're not from Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   The impact of secession on the school district is a point of
widespread confusion. The poll found only 1 in 4 voters citywide is
aware that secession would leave the school system untouched, an
indication that some could be open to persuasion as they absorb more
information over the summer and fall.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, after they said how they would vote, poll respondents were
asked a series of questions about major issues in the campaign. They
were then asked again which side they favored. Citywide, after the
respondents heard arguments on both sides of the issues, the margin
against secession grew.</TE>
<TE>   Voters who have already made up their minds are divided most
sharply along geographic lines.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the Valley secession drive have said they need support
from 65% of Valley voters to offset opposition elsewhere. At this
point, they are falling short of that mark. The biggest stronghold
for secession is in the west Valley, where voters favor a city
breakup, 59% to 32%. East of the San Diego Freeway, the vote is
essentially tied, 45% in favor and 42% opposed, a difference within
the poll's margin of error.</TE>
<TE>   Voters outside the Valley oppose secession, 53% to 29%, the poll
found.</TE>
<TE>   Those results suggest that to win, secessionists must hold--and
perhaps expand--their vote among whites and conservatives in the west
Valley, but also build support on the Valley's east side.</TE>
<TE>   That area includes some heavily Latino communities such as Sylmar
and Pacoima, and heavily Jewish neighborhoods in places such as
Studio City, Sherman Oaks and North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Secession backers are hoping for a boost from state Sen. Richard
Alarcon of Sylmar. He is considering a run for mayor of the Valley
city, and his candidacy on the same ballot as the referendum could
draw more support for secession among Latinos, political analysts
say.</TE>
<TE>   Poll Finds Latino Voters Reflect City</TE>
<TE>   So far, though, Latino voters reflect the same opinions on
secession as the city at large, the poll found. Citywide, Latino
voters oppose secession, 45% to 36%, while in the Valley a majority
supports independence.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's give it a try," said Jesus Zambrano, a Sylmar aerospace
technician. "I'm not necessarily saying this is a magic wand, but
it's a start."</TE>
<TE>   Among Jewish voters, secession is unpopular regardless of where
they live. Jewish voters citywide oppose secession, 57% to 34%. A
majority of Jewish voters in the Valley are also against secession,
the poll indicates.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in the households of union members are divided along
geographic lines. Citywide, they oppose secession 49% to 34%, but in
the Valley, they lean slightly toward independence from L.A. Union
leaders have pledged an aggressive anti-secession campaign that they
hope will sway members who support the breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the secessionists can solidify support in the Valley, the
depth of opposition in the rest of the city could sink the measure.
If voter turnout follows the pattern of recent elections, the
pro-secession side probably needs to win at least 40% of the vote
outside of the Valley to prevail citywide.</TE>
<TE>   Although public opinion on secession is divided mainly by
geography, the poll also found splits along other demographic lines.</TE>
<TE>   Secession's strongest supporters live in the Valley and are white,
affluent, Republican, self-described conservatives or moderates. Most
secession backers have lived in the Valley for at least 10 years, the
poll found.</TE>
<TE>   The staunchest opponents live outside the Valley and are liberals,
Democrats, Jews and African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that the decision will be built around some of the
dividing lines we're already pretty familiar with in L.A., which is
race, place and ideology," said political scientist Raphael
Sonenshein of Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the politics of secession appear to be realigning large
blocs of the city electorate, he said. Specifically, the poll
reflects a breakdown in the coalition that swept Mayor James K. Hahn
into office: blacks in southern Los Angeles allied with white San
Fernando Valley conservatives and moderates.</TE>
<TE>   In its place, the survey suggests a coalition more similar to the
one forged by former Mayor Tom Bradley in the 1970s and '80s: blacks
and white liberals, Jews and Westside voters.</TE>
<TE>   Black voters oppose secession by a 53% to 29% margin. That finding
came even before the Rev. Cecil "Chip" Murray of First AME Church and
more than 30 other black community leaders announced Friday that they
will campaign against it.</TE>
<TE>   Black voters in Los Angeles, most of whom live outside the Valley,
have tended to vote in a unified bloc. Secession advocates have been
trying to blunt opposition among black voters by arguing that a
smaller city government would work to their advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Fisher, 44, a lifelong resident of South-Central, said Valley
secession would hurt his neighborhood "tremendously" by taking away
tax money needed for youth recreation programs.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these kids, their parents don't have food on the table
for them, and they would go out and commit crimes to survive," he
said. "We're already struggling as it is. We're struggling bad out
here."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Sebel, a financial consultant who lives near the
intersection of Olympic and Robertson boulevards, said he fears a
breakup would lead to less aid from Washington and Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Valley,a main reason for opposing secession is a
concern about the loss of tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody's taxes are going to go up, and I don't think
anybody's services are going to improve," said retired teacher Sharon
Bradford of Bel-Air.</TE>
<TE>   The poll found just 4% of voters citywide believe taxes would drop
if Los Angeles breaks apart, 47% expect taxes to rise, and 37% think
they would stay the same.</TE>
<TE>   Despite predictions by secession promoters that a Valley city
could offer lower taxes, voters there are skeptical. Among Valley
voters, 5% predict lower taxes, 40% foresee higher taxes and 43% say
taxes would remain stable.</TE>
<TE>   Most secession backers also say that they think their power and
water rates would go up if the Valley were to break away.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly half of Valley voters say secession would improve services.
More than half say secession would solve the city's worst problems.
Valley voters list crime and bad schools--problems that are most
severe in other parts of Los Angeles--as the city's worst troubles.</TE>
<TE>   Half of Valley voters concede that secession would have a negative
impact on the rest of Los Angeles. But Paul Sundling, a computer
programmer from Toluca Lake, says he will vote for secession anyway.
Sundling says the rest of the city might face a drop in tax money to
spend on services, but, he said, "I think everybody should pull their
own weight."</TE>
<TE>   If secession does pass, the poll also found an emerging consensus
among Valley voters on a name for the proposed city: San Fernando
Valley. They roundly reject the other four names on the ballot:
Camelot, Rancho San Fernando, Valley City and Mission Valley.</TE>
<TE>   For now, said Pinkus, the campaign against secession seems to have
more strength than the effort to split up Los Angeles, but the
landscape could change once the television advertising begins.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's a slam dunk for either side," she said.</TE>

<TE>How the Poll Was Conducted</TE>
<TE>The Times Poll contacted 1,291 registered voters in the city of Los
Angeles by telephone June 20-28. The margin of sampling error for the
overall city sample is plus or minus 3 percentage points. In order to
increase the sample size of the San Fernando Valley voters, Hollywood
voters, Latino voters living in the San Fernando Valley and African
American voters living in the city, the main sample was supplemented
to the following totals: 576 SFV voters (margin of sampling error of
+/- 3 percentage points); 120 Hollywood voters (+/- 9 points); 242
Latinos voters in the city, including 119 living in the SFV (city
Latinos have a margin of error of +/- 6 points, SFV Latinos, +/- 9
points); 169 African American voters (+/- 8 points). The samples were
then weighted to their proportionate share in the city. Telephone
numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in the city of Los
Angeles. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed and
unlisted numbers could be contacted. The entire sample was weighted
slightly to conform with census figures for sex, race, age,
education, registration and area of city. Poll results can also be
affected by other factors such as question wording and the order in
which questions are presented. Interviews were conducted in English
and Spanish. Asian Americans were interviewed as part of the entire
sample but there were not enough Asian voters to break out as a
separate subgroup.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 150 black farmers claiming discrimination in federal crop
loans staged a peaceful sit-in that shut down an Agriculture
Department office.</LD>
<LD>   The angry farmers first held a rally outside the small USDA office
in this town 55 miles northeast of Memphis, and then they poured
inside, sitting in the lobby and at desks, and taking over a
conference room.</LD>
<LD>   Protest organizer Thomas Burrell accused the government of
conspiring "to force black farmers off the land."</LD>
<TE>   Carey Johnson, who directs farm subsidy programs for 12 Tennessee
counties, greeted the protesters, then withdrew to an office to talk
by phone with his superiors in Washington. He declined comment on
those conversations.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said all crop loans in the district are handled the same
way, regardless of an applicant's race.</TE>

<HD>Smokers Cope With New Cigarette Tax Hike</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New Yorkers already pay $5 for a cappuccino and have been known to
fork over $12 for a martini. But there was plenty of grumbling from
smokers as they began paying more than $7 for a pack of cigarettes.</LD>
<LD>   "Ten years ago I said I would never pay $5 for a pack of
cigarettes, but if it's something that you want to do, you'll find a
way to do it," said Rochelle Frederick, 43. The pack cost her $7.50.</LD>
<LD>   It costs so much because New York City has bumped its per-pack tax
from 8 cents to $1.50. It was a nasty blow to smokers, who were just
getting used to a state tax increase of $1.50 per pack that took
effect in May.</LD>

<HD>Bush Revives a Campaign for School Vouchers</HD>
<DH>Politics: The president's fervent backing signals a revival
of the issue after high court ruling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>CLEVELAND -- A spirited President Bush renewed his campaign for
school vouchers Monday, hailing as "a great victory" last week's
Supreme Court ruling that removed the constitutional cloud over the
movement to allow parents to use public funds to send children to
private schools.</LD>
<LD>   Traveling to Cleveland, where the voucher case originated, Bush
said the high court's decision was "just as historic" as its 1954
ruling that held there cannot be two separate school systems, one for
whites and another for blacks.</LD>
<LD>   "And that was the right decision," the president said, referring
to Brown vs. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kan., the case that
forced the nation's public schools to desegregate.</LD>
<TE>   "Last week, what's notable and important is that the court
declared that our nation will not accept one education system for
those who can afford to send their children to a school of their
choice and [another] for those who can't," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The speech marked the first time in recent memory Bush has used
the word "voucher," signaling that the Supreme Court decision has
revived the issue's political appeal for his administration.</TE>
<TE>   Although as a White House candidate Bush stressed his support for
vouchers, as president he readily jettisoned the proposal to focus on
building bipartisan congressional support for an educational reform
bill that became law in January.</TE>
<TE>   That measure seeks to improve schools by imposing annual reading
and math tests on students in the third through eighth grades while
substantially increasing federal aid to public education.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats made clear they could not support any bill that would
allow public funds to be used for private schools, but the
legislation Bush signed will allow--starting in September--about 3.5
million schoolchildren to transfer from persistently under-performing
public schools to better ones.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's speech in Cleveland touched on a range of topics. White
House aides said it was intended to reinvigorate his "compassionate
conservatism" agenda as it relates to welfare reform, an initiative
to channel more federal dollars into religious charities and a drive
to promote homeownership among minorities.</TE>
<TE>   He is scheduled to deliver much the same message today in
Milwaukee. In his Monday remarks, Bush renewed his tough rhetorical
attack against corporate wrongdoers, saying his administration would
"go after" business executives who mislead the public and
stockholders.</TE>
<TE>   As he has done in many speeches since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, Bush urged Americans to "fight evil by doing good," such as
by volunteering or helping a neighbor or shut-in.</TE>
<TE>   "A patriot is somebody who understands ... that life is complete
when you make a sacrifice for somebody else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also provided an update on the war on terrorism, saying that
good progress is being made and that "the surest way to protect the
homeland is to hunt the killers down one by one and bring them to
justice."</TE>
<TE>   The president pleaded "guilty" to engaging in "a lot of warlike
talk." But he added: "I long for a peaceful world for every citizen
on the face of the globe."</TE>
<TE>   Education Secretary Rod Paige, in introducing Bush, called
Cleveland "the ground zero for freedom of choice in public
education."</TE>
<TE>   And Bush, in his address to several thousand city leaders and
community activists, became most fervent when he discussed the
voucher issue.</TE>
<TE>   In a 5-4 ruling Thursday, the Supreme Court opened the door for
the use of taxpayer money to send students to church schools, ruling
that Ohio's voucher plan does not violate the Constitution's ban on
an "establishment of religion."</TE>
<TE>   The decision--probably the most important high court ruling on aid
to parochial schools in nearly 30 years--upheld Ohio's tuition grant
of $2,250 that families in Cleveland can spend at private schools.
More than 96% of parents who took the money enrolled their children
in religious schools.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, state officials around the country have shied away from
similar programs for fear of violating the separation of church and
state doctrine.</TE>
<TE>   Bush urged Congress to adopt a proposal in his budget for the 2003
fiscal year to provide tax credits to parents who send their children
to private schools. The plan, he said, will give parents "more
flexibility and more choices when it comes to the education of their
children."</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, (D-Mass.), a key Bush
ally in the enactment of the education reform bill, took strong issue
with the president on vouchers.</TE>
<TE>   "Private school vouchers may pass constitutional muster, but they
fail the test when it comes to improving our nation's public
schools," Kennedy said.</TE>

<HD>Women File Suit Against Diocese</HD>
<DH>Courts: They say it didn't protect them from abuse by a
Massachusetts priest in the 1980s. He later went to jail for raping a
girl in an unrelated case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Five women have sued a Massachusetts diocese, alleging that it failed
to protect them when they were young children in the 1980s from
sexual abuse by a Roman Catholic priest--one who later served prison
time for raping a girl.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffrey Newman, the plaintiffs' attorney, said Monday that he
expects seven other women to join soon in the suit filed Friday
against the Diocese of Worcester. Experts said the case is unusual in
the ongoing scandal of sexual abuse by priests because all of the
alleged victims are female.</LD>
<LD>   The priest named in the lawsuit is Robert Kelley, 60, who owns a
flower shop in Cambridge, Mass., with his brother. Kelley, who served
seven years in prison after pleading guilty to raping a girl in an
unrelated case, ceased active work in the priesthood in 1985.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleges negligence by the diocese but does not detail
acts by Kelley. In an interview, plaintiff Heather Mackey, 26, said
Kelley took a special interest in her when she was as young as 5,
attending St. Cecilia's in Leominster with her grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   "He would say, 'Oh, this is boring for a little girl, she doesn't
want to sit here for a couple of hours--let me take care of her. Let
me take her out for ice cream,' " she said. "My grandmother was one
of the most religious people you have ever known. She did not think a
priest could do anything wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Kelley was charged last month with five counts of rape in which
Mackey was the alleged victim. He has pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Msgr. Thomas Sullivan of the Worcester diocese called the charges
against Kelley "a very different matter" than the bulk of cases that
have unfolded since the scandal erupted in January.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the allegations that have been made here and also other
places have involved young boys," he said. "But the girls are
starting to get more attention, particularly involving allegations
against [Kelley]. The fact that these [female] victims are coming
forward, we welcome that."</TE>
<TE>   But Dr. Richard Sipe, a psychiatrist in La Jolla, Calif., who is
also a former priest, said Monday that women face obstacles in coming
forward with sexual abuse complaints against clergy members. "The
abuse of young women and young girls [by priests] is vastly
underreported," he said.</TE>

<HD>Death Penalty Faulted</HD>
<DH>Law: New York judge's ruling covers only his courtroom but
adds to debate over executions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A U.S. trial judge in New York said Monday that the
federal death penalty is unconstitutional because there is an
''unacceptably high'' risk that an innocent person will be executed.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff has no significance
beyond halting the government's effort to bring death penalty charges
against two Bronx drug dealers who allegedly tortured and killed an
informant.</LD>
<LD>   A federal trial judge has no authority beyond his courtroom to
strike down the law, and other federal death penalty cases can
proceed.</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the opinion by Rakoff, a 1995 Clinton appointee to
the Southern District of New York, adds to the growing debate over
whether capital punishment can be fairly administered.</TE>
<TE>   The Death Penalty Information Center says 101 inmates sentenced to
death since 1976 have been released. Many were shown to be innocent
because DNA tests excluded them as suspects or witnesses recanted
testimony that led to their convictions.</TE>
<TE>   There is no firm evidence that an innocent person has been
executed in the last two decades, however, and none of the
exonerations have come in federal death penalty cases.</TE>
<TE>   But in late April, Rakoff said recent revelations of innocent
people on death row have shaken confidence in the entire system. He
said society has been "queasy about the possibility that an innocent
person, mistakenly convicted and sentenced to death, might be
executed."</TE>
<TE>   That possibility is too great for capital punishment to continue,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason to believe the federal system will be any more
successful at avoiding mistaken impositions of the death penalty than
error-prone state systems already exposed," he said. "The
unacceptably high rate at which innocent persons are convicted of
capital crimes" means that continued use of the death penalty "is
tantamount to foreseeable state-sponsored murder of innocent human
beings."</TE>
<TE>   Congress revived the federal death penalty in 1988, targeting drug
kingpins. A 1994 crime bill greatly expanded the number of crimes
eligible for a federal death sentence, including terrorism and
airplane hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-one people have been sentenced to death under these laws,
but only two have been executed: Timothy J. McVeigh, who bombed the
federal building in Oklahoma City, and Juan R. Garza, a Texas drug
kingpin responsible for several murders.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, Bush administration lawyers are pursuing death penalty
charges in Virginia against Zacarias Moussaoui, the alleged 20th
hijacker in the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department is likely to appeal Rakoff's decision to
the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Comstock, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the
judge's opinion ignores Congress and the Supreme Court. ''Congress
passed the federal Death Penalty Act to save lives, and the Supreme
Court has repeatedly said the death penalty is constitutional," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers who oppose the death penalty said Rakoff's ruling reflects
a growing skepticism about capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the system people believed it was 10 years ago. There
are few people who are still willing to indulge the assumption that
there are enough safeguards to prevent an innocent person from being
executed," said George Kendall of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in New
York. "He is the first judge to say it is unconstitutional, but he
won't be the last."</TE>
<TE>   Kent Scheidegger of the pro-death penalty Criminal Justice Legal
Foundation in Sacramento said Rakoff's ruling is not likely to stand
for long.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not a binding precedent, and it's not going to block
enforcement of the law anywhere else," he said. "I also think the
notion that a district judge would ignore the Supreme Court on an
issue like this is very strange."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1976, the high court has said that the Constitution, by its
very words, permits capital punishment. The 5th Amendment says, "No
person shall be held to answer for a capital ... crime" unless
indicted by a grand jury, nor shall anyone "be deprived of life,
liberty or property without due process of law."</TE>

<HD>Pilots Drunk at Jetliner's Helm, Police Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Two America West pilots at the helm of a Phoenix-bound jetliner were
ordered to return to the airport terminal moments before takeoff
Monday and were arrested for being legally drunk, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The pilots were each charged with a felony count of operating an
aircraft under the influence and operating a motor vehicle under the
influence, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Both have been suspended with pay pending an investigation by the
airline, said Patty Nowack, an America West spokeswoman.</LD>
<TE>   Miami-Dade police Det. Juan DelCastillo said screeners at Miami
International Airport first noticed an odor of alcohol on the men
when they tried to bring cups of coffee through the security
checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   The screeners alerted airport officials, who called police. By the
time officers arrived, the plane had already left the gate. The
airport tower ordered the plane back to the terminal and the pilots
were given a cursory sobriety test, DelCastillo said.</TE>
<TE>   The men then agreed to take a breath test. Both registered
blood-alcohol levels above 0.08, Florida's legal limit for operating
machinery, DelCastillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Pilot Thomas Cloyd, 44, had a 0.091 blood-alcohol level, while
Christopher Hughes registered 0.084, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The pilots couldn't be reached for comment Monday; they were being
held by police pending processing. It wasn't immediately clear if
they had obtained attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Cloyd has worked for America West since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes joined the airline in January 1999, Nowack said. Both
pilots have good working records, she said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the pilots' first flight of the day, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating to determine
whether to take action against the pilots, which could include
revoking their licenses or suspending them, spokeswoman Laura Brown
said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal aviation rules prohibit pilots from flying within eight
hours of consuming alcohol or with a blood-alcohol level of 0.04.</TE>

<HD>A Hard Life but Good Job, Then Arrest</HD>
<DH>Crime: Man accused of setting Arizona blaze got chance to
succeed, gain respect as a firefighter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER and JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>CIBECUE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>CIBECUE, Ariz. -- Leonard Gregg, the man accused of setting the
devastating Rodeo fire, was hardly living an easy life here. This
being the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, however, he was making out
about as well as most.</LD>
<LD>   Gregg is poor and, much of the time, was jobless, like the
majority of men here. He doesn't drink much, but members of his
family have alcohol problems, he told investigators, as do most
adults on the reservation.</LD>
<LD>   His education stopped at the ninth grade. He lived with his
girlfriend and her six children and struggled with little success to
support them.</LD>
<TE>   But each summer, Gregg, like about 7,000 Native American men
across the country, had the chance to earn not just a half-decent
wage but the respect of the community. He became a firefighter, a
perennial hero in yellow and green flame-resistant Nomex.</TE>
<TE>   A contract firefighter with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Gregg
would don his helmet and goggles and, for $8 an hour, become a
revered protector of his reservation, home to 13,000 tribe members.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a long tradition here of firefighters, and everyone is
very proud of them," said Ben Nuvamsa, the BIA supervisor at the Fort
Apache agency. "Our teams are recognized nationally for their
efforts. They are local heroes. They march in the tribal parades and
everyone cheers."</TE>
<TE>   On June 18, with fires raging in Colorado--and firefighters there
making the hourly wage plus considerable overtime--the part-time hero
Gregg allegedly sparked two fires north of here.</TE>
<TE>   The first burned only an acre before crews put it out. The second
ran up the canyons, spread through the pine forests and merged with
another fire farther west, growing into the largest conflagration in
state history.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday, the now-dying Rodeo-Chediski fire had scorched 463,000
acres, consumed 437 homes and cost the reservation at least $250
million in timber sales alone.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg, a soft-spoken 29-year-old with a fondness for cowboy hats
and horses, allegedly left boot prints at the scene and told a
neighbor that he was expecting a fire call even before the blaze had
been reported. When authorities took him into custody Saturday night,
he told investigators that he set the fire in the hope of being
called to duty, according to court papers. He also told them he did
it in a rage, furious over the drunken behavior of some close
relatives.</TE>
<TE>   His hometown of Cibecue, where he started the fires, sits at the
tip of a dead-end roadway in the southwest corner of the reservation.
Many of the community's 2,000 residents speak only broken English,
preferring Apache.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg, who is now in jail in Flagstaff awaiting trial, lived in a
small brown stucco house here, a partially prefabricated home that
looks like countless others on the 1.6-million-acre reservation.</TE>
<TE>   He was adopted when he was 4, said an aunt, Ruthena Henry, and was
close to his adoptive parents but had little to do with his birth
parents. He grew up camping with his adoptive father and later hiked
and rode horses in the forest.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg and his girlfriend and her children lived, like most here,
primarily on government aid, neighbors said. He worked as a hired
hand at a nearby ranch a few times, but summertime firefighting was
the best job he ever had.</TE>
<TE>   With an unemployment rate of 62% and the median household income
$18,903, compared with $40,558 for the rest of Arizona, Fort Apache
is nevertheless among the more prosperous and economically stable
reservations in the country. Compared with most of the United States,
however, Fort Apache is neither.</TE>
<TE>   And with little good news and few role models, the White Mountain
Apaches and many other tribes have embraced their firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   "These fire crews are a respected part of a tribal community,"
said Craig Wilcox, forest manager on the San Carlos reservation in
central Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   The jobs are highly sought after. There are 600 firefighters at
San Carlos and 1,000 on the Fort Apache reservation, each of whom
could earn $15,000 to $20,000 this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good job," Wilcox said, "and a respected one."</TE>
<TE>   The modern tradition of wild-land firefighting among Native
Americans began after World War II, when a shortage of federal fire
crews led to recruitment on reservations.</TE>
<TE>   In 1948, the Mescalero Apaches of New Mexico began the Southwest
Forest Firefighter program.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next few years, the "Red Hats" became known as one of the
best fire crews in the country and were often singled out for praise,
according to the Journal of Arizona History.</TE>
<TE>   After one fire, Trinity National Forest ranger Ralph W. White
wrote a report to the Mescalero crew chief. "Your crews were far and
above any other crews on the fire," he said more than half a century
ago. "Their discipline, fire camp manners, and general behavior made
them an outstanding group not even considering their firefighting
efforts."</TE>
<TE>   At Fort Apache, signs proclaim the reservation "Home of the Apache
Hotshots."</TE>
<TE>   Hotshots--highly trained crews sent into some of the most
dangerous fire areas--are, along with smoke jumpers, the most
celebrated firefighters. There are just 68 teams in the country and
only three from reservations. The Apache Hotshots became the first
Indian crew, in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg is not a hotshot, but he is a trained firefighter, a man
with a "red card" that means he has the skills to head to the front
lines with a pickax or a shovel and perform a dangerous job.</TE>
<TE>   He is not likely to get such admirable work anytime soon, however.
At his first court appearance, on Sunday, Gregg tried to apologize,
but the magistrate cut him off.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg is expected to appear in court again Wednesday on charges
that could bring him 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   As evacuees return, some to homes, some to ashes, tempers have
flared. Gregg's family reported receiving death threats. Tribal
officials also said they've been threatened. Some people wondered
aloud whether jail wasn't the safest place for Gregg.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if he did it, but people are very mad," said Alex
Gonzales of Globe, whose family property near the town of Show Low
survived the blaze. "I'd just stay there awhile if I were him."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEADOW GROVE, Neb.</DL>
<LD>Memories dance through the decay of this small town, through the wide
leafy blankness of Main Street.</LD>
<LD>   The old-timers gabbing over coffee in the lone cafe snatch at the
memories and lay them out in lists. They catalog the businesses that
once thrived here but are now dead: Three groceries. Two hardware
stores. Two farm equipment dealers. Produce stands. Barber shops. A
car lot.</LD>
<LD>   Remember the theater? Lawrence Welk played there. And the movies,
projected on a brick wall come summer. A dime per picture. Drew quite
a crowd. Especially the talkies. "They put that voice in and boy,
that was really uptown," recalled Dale Inness, 76.</LD>
<TE>   The memories are bright as ever. But the town they haunt is fading
out, fast. About all that's left on Main Street now is a bar, a
credit union, a post office, a newspaper office with one employee and
a might-be-open-might-not lumber store.</TE>
<TE>   It's the same all across the heartland. From the Rocky Mountains
to the Missouri River, from North Dakota to north Texas, rural
America is emptying. The decline has been apparent for decades as a
slow, sad wasting. But the latest census figures suggest the
hollowing of the heartland has reached a crisis point. Seventy
percent of rural Midwest counties have suffered drastic population
loss in the last two decades. The average drop: at least 30%.</TE>
<TE>   Now, there's a new proposal to reverse this slide--by paying
people to give rural life a chance.</TE>
<TE>   The senators touting it speak with fervor of rekindling the spirit
of the American frontier, of drawing a new generation of pioneers to
spark life in boarded-up farm towns.</TE>
<TE>   But out here in Meadow Grove--population 311 and falling--folks
are not sure the spirit of the past can be rekindled. And some are
deeply suspicious of any federal effort to try.</TE>
<TE>   "All this pretending we're going to keep yesterday alive, it's
stupid," said Lawrence Sinclair, 48, a dairy farm consultant. "These
small towns, they're history."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles Hagel, a Nebraska Republican, and Sen. Byron L.
Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, refuse to write off rural America as
a relic.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing inspiration from the Homestead Act of 1862--which gave
free land to pioneers settling the frontier--they have proposed
offering financial incentives to anyone who will commit to saving
communities like Meadow Grove.</TE>
<TE>   The Homestead Economic Opportunity Act would give tax breaks to
people buying homes or setting up businesses in shrinking rural
counties. Recent college graduates who move to these areas could
write off up to half their student loans. A venture capital fund
would funnel start-up money to rural entrepreneurs.</TE>
<TE>   And the federal government would set up special tax-free
retirement accounts for small-town residents, matching some of their
savings dollar for dollar. To be eligible for the incentives,
residents would have to live in a struggling rural community for at
least five years.</TE>
<TE>   Hagel acknowledges that it will be tough to get the bill through
Congress. He points out, though, that America pulled
together--spending billions--to fix up inner cities during the "urban
renewal" movement of the 1960s and '70s. He maintains a similar
coalition could be mobilized around rural renewal.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't do something," Dorgan said, "we won't have much of a
heartland at all."</TE>
<TE>   Trouble is, at least here in Meadow Grove, it's hard to find folks
who think doing something will help.</TE>
<TE>   At the cafe, at a table with an American flag stuck in a vase,
Inness shrugged. "There isn't any future here. It's over," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we pretty much all agree on that," 62-year-old Roger
Suckstorf added.</TE>
<TE>   The seven retired farmers cradling coffee cups nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "It's useless," muttered Jack Halsey, 69. "Nothing's ever going to
bring [rural communities] back."</TE>
<TE>   Keith Turner, an economist retired from the University of
Nebraska, agrees. Already, he said, the government has wasted money
preserving the infrastructure of towns clearly on the wane--fixing
roads and water towers, putting in sewers that serve fewer and fewer
people. The federal government also funds programs to bring doctors,
nurses and teachers to rural towns and some struggling urban areas.
This year, it has placed 2,360 health professionals, at a cost of
$147 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We keep putting dollars into so-called saving these towns. All
you're doing is prolonging their demise," said Turner, who lives in
Union, Neb. (pop. 200). "When a town loses its reason for being, why
be there?"</TE>
<TE>   Large Operations</TE>
<TE>   Replace Family Farms</TE>
<TE>   The prairie used to be laid out in neat squares of 640 acres.
Every square was anchored by four farmsteads--each with a barn, a
silo, a family home. Every 15 or 20 squares, there was a town with
groceries and machine shops, schools and churches, feed stores and
grain elevators.</TE>
<TE>   You can still see the squares when you fly over the Plains. Only,
there's no longer a home in every corner. Agricultural operations now
are so big that one farm may sprawl across thousands of acres,
pushing farmsteads farther and farther apart.</TE>
<TE>   There are not enough children to sustain local schools, not enough
shoppers to sustain local stores. There's no longer a sense of a
community knit together, square by square.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like we're just a ... " Devon Kuether pauses, searching
for the word. She has lived in Meadow Grove all her 66 years. She is
planting flowers in the sweet summer dusk.</TE>
<TE>   "What do they call those areas around cities? Suburbs. That's it."
Back to her garden. "I feel like we're just a suburb."</TE>
<TE>   The new Homestead Act is designed to give communities a fighting
chance to retain their souls. But federal programs are not looked
upon kindly here. Folks tend to hold that government meddling does
more harm than good.</TE>
<TE>   To prove their case, they point to another subsidy once touted as
a fix for the heartland.</TE>
<TE>   Introduced in 1933, as the Great Depression gripped the Plains,
farm subsidies were supposed to be a safety net for calamitous times.
They have become instead a crucial source of farm income, year in and
year out; today, 25 cents of every dollar in farm revenue comes from
a government check. In 2000, government support averaged $20,800 per
farmer--with the bigger producers getting many times more.</TE>
<TE>   Some economists argue that the subsidies are the only thing
keeping many families on the land.</TE>
<TE>   No one here would quibble with that assessment. But some farmers
take the money grudgingly--convinced that if the government hadn't
started handing it out, rural America would be much better off.</TE>
<TE>   They trace a bitter chain of woe, starting with the fact that
subsidies are paid out based on the number of bushels of grain a
farmer harvests. That encourages overproduction. Grain prices fall.
Farmers plant more and more acres to make a living. Farms get bigger.
Corporations move into agriculture. Families are squeezed out. Towns
built for those families collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the momentum gets going in this direction, it's very hard to
reverse," said Roy Frederick, an agricultural economist with the
University of Nebraska at Lincoln.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the vast fields of the Midwest echo with farmers' anger
at the very subsidies that sustain them. And it's why many folks here
disdain the offer of subsidies in the Homestead Act.</TE>
<TE>   "Might as well throw the money in the river to begin with,"
snapped 64-year-old Larry Wright, a retired farmer.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll turn out like the farm program. They'd be throwing bad
money after more bad money," agreed Bob Mather, 67, who owns a gas
station and convenience store in Meadow Grove, but plans to shut it
down this fall for lack of business.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional analysts have not figured out how much the Homestead
Act would cost taxpayers. The only number Hagel and Dorgan have come
up with is the $2 billion they are requesting over a decade for the
venture capital fund. (By comparison, farm subsidies will cost $180
billion over a decade.)</TE>
<TE>   Bob Warrick, a 70-year-old retired farmer who stands out in Meadow
Grove for his liberal-leaning views, dares to suggest that the
expense might be worthwhile. Yet even he worries that the proposal
relies on an idealistic view of middle America.</TE>
<TE>   "Rekindling the spirit of the frontier.... It's a little romantic,
isn't it?" Warrick said. "The trouble with the Great Plains is that
it's a very unforgiving place. A lot of people have failed out here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   '</TE>
<TE>   'I Like It Just Fine the Way It Is'</TE>
<TE>   Painstakingly edging his garden with bricks, Josh Eckert doesn't
think about failure. He does not see his community as lost.</TE>
<TE>   He is 22 and he just bought a house here. Eckert is too young to
recall Meadow Grove as it once was; he does not miss what he never
knew.</TE>
<TE>   He has no problem buying groceries 20 miles away at Wal-Mart,
where he works assembling furniture. It doesn't bother him that
there's no barber shop in town.</TE>
<TE>   "I like it just fine the way it is," Eckert said.</TE>
<TE>   His neighbors are more cynical. Yet even as they grumble that
their town is inevitably on the decline, they can't help but give
reasons it should not be allowed to die.</TE>
<TE>   They like having public schools so small that no kid who wants to
play a sport is ever benched. They find comfort in a town where
families spend time together, talking, because there are no movie
theaters or skateboard parks or bowling alleys to run off to. And
even families with minimum-wage incomes can buy homes--which have
been auctioned off for as little as a few thousand dollars after the
owner dies. In many rural communities, a four-bedroom house is deemed
pricey if it sells for more than $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, even when stores are shuttered, community spirit remains
strong in a place like Meadow Grove, where farmers leave their
equipment sheds open in case a neighbor needs to borrow a tool.</TE>
<TE>   "We have something here that you don't have in Orange County,
Calif.," said Todd Stewart, at 41 one of the few young farmers in
town. "When there's trouble, people help."</TE>
<TE>   He may be exaggerating the coldness of suburban life. On the other
hand, in an isolated town of 300--or even 3,000--there are very few
strangers. When Stewart's wife, Julie, had to go on bed rest during
her pregnancy, neighbors came to cook and clean.</TE>
<TE>   When a nearby farmer was sunk in mourning for his dad, his friends
harvested every last acre of his soybeans. When a family lost their
home to fire, a pork-and-potato benefit raised funds to help.</TE>
<TE>   The pull of community is so strong that the Meadow Grove News,
delivered to 150 homes in town, is also mailed to 500 long-distance
subscribers--people who left but still want to keep up with hometown
news.</TE>
<TE>   Not that rural America is paradise. Crime, especially vandalism by
bored kids, is on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   Drugs, especially methamphetamine, are a growing problem. So is
pollution from huge livestock lots. And there is much poverty.</TE>
<TE>   But Dorgan finds it ironic that the basic values Americans clamor
for in their cities and suburbs--safe streets, solid schools,
affordable homes--are the very hallmarks of a rural life ebbing from
neglect.</TE>
<TE>   The Homestead Act would not attempt to turn the tide by reviving
the old-fashioned family farm. Everyone senses that's impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the goal is to foster a diverse economy made up of
thousands of small enterprises, from telemarketing services to
microbreweries, from the credit-card processing center in Ainsworth,
Neb. (pop. 1,800), to the mozzarella cheese manufacturer in
middle-of-nowhere Ravenna, Neb. (pop. 1,300).</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of towns of 500, 600 or 1,000 people are not going to make
it," Hagel said.</TE>
<TE>   But with incentives, he hopes enough small businesses will
materialize to anchor counties now on the verge of blowing away like
topsoil.</TE>
<TE>   The incentives would apply to any county that has lost at least
10% of its population in the last two decades. Two-thirds of
Nebraska's counties would qualify. So would three-quarters of South
Dakota's. And 91% of North Dakota's.</TE>
<TE>   "No one county or state can turn this around on its own," Dorgan
said. "But the country as a whole can do it, if it decides the
heartland is important to save."</TE>
<TE>   To which Bob Mather, at the counter of his gas station, could only
shake his head. He'd like to believe in rural renewal. He can't.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have to pay people to live here ... " he said. His voice
trailed off. He sounded bitter--and sad.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, the streets of Meadow Grove were silent.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to have small towns like this down the road,"
Mather said. "We're done. This place won't be here in 20 years."</TE>

<HD>Concerns Raised on Irradiated Mail</HD>
<DH>Health: A report says symptoms such as headaches and
itching skin may be linked to the handling of items sent to federal
agencies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A substantial number of congressional employees may have experienced
long-term health problems linked to the handling of irradiated mail,
including headaches, burning eyes and nausea, says a report to be
released today.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe these symptoms are not insignificant, both in terms of
the number of complaints and in the effect on employee health and
work performance," the general counsel of the Office of Compliance
said in the report.</LD>
<LD>   The congressional office cautioned that the study had not
established a definitive cause of the broad range of symptoms
reported, and it did not have enough information to judge whether
there is a serious health risk. It recommended further studies and
precautionary steps such as limiting the time employees spend
handling mail.</LD>
<TE>   In January, after a three-month suspension of deliveries following
the detection of anthrax spores in 16 congressional offices, the U.S.
Postal Service began treating all mail addressed to Congress and
federal agencies with large doses of irradiation.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the resumption of deliveries, congressional offices
and postal offices began reporting health problems among workers
exposed to the irradiated mail.</TE>
<TE>   The report said 215 congressional employees responded to a written
survey in February and March that they or others in their office had
health problems. Of 148 contacted by phone in March and April, 72%
said they were still experiencing ill health.</TE>
<TE>   Among all those responding, half said they got headaches when
handling mail, 32% said they had itching skin, 23% burning and red
eyes and 21% nausea.</TE>
<TE>   Of 168 people who participated in a follow-up survey in May, 55%
said they were still experiencing symptoms. However, 61% of those
still experiencing symptoms said they were getting better.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who requested the
investigation, said irradiating mail "was and is a big experiment."
In light of the report, he said, the office of "the Senate
sergeant-at-arms and its Legislative Mail Task Force may have been
too quick to conclude irradiated mail was harmless, and they may not
have taken employees' health concerns seriously enough."</TE>
<TE>   The report stressed it surveyed only those who elected to respond,
and thus the results were not a scientifically valid sampling. But it
said scientists who analyzed air samples from House and Senate
mailrooms found low levels of irritant chemical byproducts caused by
irradiation of the mail.</TE>
<TE>   The report speculated that the byproducts probably emanated from
the cellulose contents of the paper mail, which are broken down in
the irradiation process.</TE>
<TE>   It noted that the Postal Service believed there was a problem with
some "overdoses" of irradiation.</TE>

<HD>GOP Rep. Watts Won't Run Again</HD>
<DH>Politics: The House leader from Oklahoma deals a blow to
Bush's efforts to give a bigger party role to minorities. He denies
discontent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., the only black Republican in
Congress and a member of the House GOP leadership, announced Monday
that he will not seek reelection--a setback to President Bush's
determined efforts to give minorities a more visible role in the
party.</LD>
<LD>   Watts' departure is likely to leave Republicans without any blacks
in Congress after the 2002 election. A handful of black GOP
candidates are seeking House seats in November, but none is given
much chance of winning.</LD>
<LD>   "The Republican Party, if it wants to be a majority party, is
going to have to do a much better job reaching out to minorities,"
said William F. Connelly Jr., a political scientist at Washington and
Lee University.</LD>
<TE>   An Impending Shakeup</TE>
<TE>   Watts is the second House GOP leader to decide not to run for
reelection, widening the scope of a shakeup that will scramble the
lineup of Bush's lieutenants in Congress. Earlier this year, House
Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) announced his retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Watts, 44, cited personal reasons for his announcement, saying he
wants to spend more time with his wife and children. He added: "It is
time for me to move on."</TE>
<TE>   Both Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney called Watts within the
last week to try to dissuade him from retiring.</TE>
<TE>   But his decision comes after recent blows to his ambition and
home-state interests. Despite the opening created by Armey's
retirement, Watts had little prospect of moving up the GOP leadership
ladder. And President Bush's proposal to eliminate the Crusader
artillery system is a blow to Watts' district, where the system was
to be assembled.</TE>
<TE>   But Watts, who made his announcement at a news conference in his
home district in Norman, Okla., said his decision was not driven by
frustration over either of those factors.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a wonderful journey," Watts said of his career in the
House. "Of course, the work of America is never done, but I believe
my work in the House of Representatives at this time of life is
completed."</TE>
<TE>   Watts' departure is expected to make it somewhat harder for
Republicans to hold onto his House seat, but analysts say it will
still be a difficult seat for Democrats to win.</TE>
<TE>   A former star quarterback at the University of Oklahoma who also
played in the Canadian Football League, Watts was first elected to
Congress in 1994 as part of the influx of conservatives that gave the
GOP control of the House for the first time in 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   He stood out among his fellow Republican freshmen because of his
football background and his race. In late 1998, he was elected
chairman of the House Republican Conference, the No. 4 leadership
post in the chamber.</TE>
<TE>   His quick rise in GOP circles heightened his national profile and
sparked speculation about his potential for higher office. He played
a prominent role at the GOP's 2000 presidential convention in
Philadelphia, at which Bush showcased minority-group Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Watts' career was not without controversy,
raising doubts about his future prospects. During his 1996 House
campaign, it was revealed that he had fathered a child out of wedlock
as a teenager. Watts said he was proud the child was adopted by an
uncle; he and his wife have five children together.</TE>
<TE>   Other controversies arose from past business activities. He
admitted having small business debts in the 1980s, when oil prices
had plummeted, but said he paid them off. It was also disclosed by
local newspapers in 1996 that Watts' real estate and management
companies paid more than $67,000 in delinquent taxes.</TE>
<TE>   In Congress, Watts has taken the lead on several policy
initiatives of interest to African Americans, such as Bush's
initiative to expand the role of churches in federally financed
social work.</TE>
<TE>   Bush hailed him as "a leader in highlighting the success of
faith-based and community-based organizations."</TE>
<TE>   'Bush Gets It,' He Says</TE>
<TE>   Watts said his decision to retire had been made easier by Bush's
efforts to broaden the party's appeal to minorities. He cited Bush's
record in appointing African Americans to top administration
positions, most prominently Colin L. Powell as secretary of State,
Condoleezza Rice as national security advisor and Rod Paige as
secretary of Education.</TE>
<TE>   "The important part about a message and a party is its leader,"
Watts said. "President Bush gets it."</TE>
<TE>   But there are no black Republicans running for the Senate in the
fall elections. In the House campaigns, Carl Forti of the National
Republican Congressional Committee said there are six black
Republican candidates.</TE>
<TE>   But Charles Cook, editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report,
said none of the six is well positioned to win in November.</TE>
<TE>   Among House Democrats, 38 are black; none hold leadership
positions. There are no black Senate Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Watts' leadership post gave him visibility, but the job lacked
clear responsibilities. Although the party's legislative strategy is
mapped largely by House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and
legislation is written mostly by committee chairs, Watts tried to
carve out a role in crafting the GOP's message. But that role was
eclipsed with Bush's election.</TE>
<TE>   "With a Republican president, most of the party message comes from
the White House," said Jack Pitney, a political scientist at
Claremont-McKenna College.</TE>
<TE>   After Armey announced his plans to retire, Watts considered
running to succeed him in the No. 2 party post in the next Congress.
But he backed down after it became clear that House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay (R-Texas)--with whom Watts has feuded over party strategy--was
a shoo-in for the job. And a DeLay ally, Rep. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.),
quickly emerged as the favorite for the whip's job.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's decision to cancel the Crusader infuriated Watts not just
because it hurt his district but because the administration had not
consulted with him or given him advance warning of the decision. "I
don't think they handled the Crusader properly," Watts said. "I
thought it was unprofessional."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Denies Lindh Was Mistreated</HD>
<DH>Courts: Prosecutors ridicule defense's claims that American
Talib merely sought adventure and was no traitor. His lawyers argue
coercion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors categorically denied Monday that John Walker
Lindh was tortured or deprived of medical care, food and sleep in the
days after his capture in Afghanistan last November, and they
contended that statements he made to U.S. military officials and the
FBI should be allowed at his trial.</LD>
<LD>   In extensive federal court filings in nearby Alexandria, Va., the
government further ridiculed the notion by defense attorneys, in
their court filings, that Lindh, a young man from Northern California
who journeyed to South Asia in search of adventure and religious
teaching, was merely a modern-day Ernest Hemingway and not a traitor
to America.</LD>
<LD>   "Hemingway never conspired with a group of thugs out to kill
Americans," prosecutors said. "Hemingway never threw his lot in with
an entity like the Taliban that protected and gave sanctuary to the
heartless and depraved zealots that murdered more than 3,000 of his
fellow citizens" on Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   The Lindh statements are extremely critical to his trial, which is
scheduled to begin at the end of next month.</TE>
<TE>   His defense lawyers argue that he was coerced into cooperating
with his captors after they blindfolded and bound him, at times
naked, in a metal container, and deprived him of quality medical care
and a proper diet.</TE>
<TE>   They contend that he agreed to speak only after U.S. authorities
promised to improve his conditions.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors dismissed those assertions as "absurd."</TE>
<TE>   They said Lindh spoke freely to his captors in six sessions during
the first two weeks of December--before he was returned to the United
States, where he faces trial and a maximum punishment, if convicted,
of life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   He is charged with conspiracy to commit murder and other offenses
while fighting against the United States in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "John Walker Lindh ... was treated with exceptional regard for his
health, his safety and his security," the prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   It now falls to U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III to decide
whether the statements should be allowed in Lindh's trial.</TE>
<TE>   If he decides at a pretrial hearing scheduled this month that the
statements were coerced and therefore not admissible, it could lead
to a plea bargain.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have not released the context of Lindh's statements.</TE>
<TE>   But on Monday they described bits of conversations, including one
Lindh had with a U.S. Special Forces medic and a freelance journalist
in which Lindh claimed his name was "Abdul Hamid."</TE>
<TE>   He purportedly said he "definitely" had enjoyed fighting in a
jihad, or holy war, and that "it is the goal of every Muslim" to be
martyred in battle.</TE>
<TE>   In two interviews with an FBI agent, Lindh gave a "highly
detailed" account of his enlistment with the Taliban, his stint at Al
Farooq terrorist training camp and "his knowledge that [Osama] bin
Laden had sent operatives to attack the U.S. or Israel," prosecutors
said.</TE>
<TE>   They also said that, contrary to the images from Afghanistan of
Lindh with wild, unruly hair and an unkempt beard, the young man knew
what he was doing and was quite savvy when he agreed to talk.</TE>
<TE>   "Having studied in Yemen and in Pakistan and joined a terrorist
organization with other young Muslims from many nations, Lindh was
far more worldly than most men his age," prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   "And, as the son of an attorney, he had at least some notion of
American legal concepts."</TE>
<TE>   The government also sought to debunk the defense argument that
Lindh was improperly cared for in the days before he agreed to talk.
His medical records, parts of which were detailed by prosecutors
Monday, show that on Dec. 2, "patient says he is feeling much better
than yesterday" and "denies substantial pain."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 5, Lindh "has been eating three MREs [military meals] per
day with plenty of water. Strength continues to improve."</TE>
<TE>   And on Dec. 8, Lindh had "no complaints, states he feels well...."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Lindh was usually rested and alert when he spoke
to interrogators and that the interview sessions were often broken up
by periods of rest so as not "to tax Lindh's will."</TE>
<TE>   "Lindh was articulate, thoughtful, quite careful in what he said,"
prosecutors said. He was "possessed of detailed recollections--all
characteristics inconsistent with sleep deprivation."</TE>
<TE>   If he was tired and confused or had trouble sleeping, the
government said, it was "because it was cold, it was noisy, he was
periodically roused for security checks, and he was shackled and/or
secured."</TE>
<TE>   In another case in the Alexandria courthouse, prosecutors said
Monday that none of the 19 airplane hijackers was under surveillance
before Sept. 11, and they denied claims by Zacarias Moussaoui that he
had been watched by federal agents.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutors rejected assertions by Moussaoui, who is acting as
his own lawyer, that the government knew of the 19 hijackers, had
them under surveillance and facilitated their movement in and out of
the United States, and that he too was being shadowed before Sept.
11.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. government did not have any of the 19 under surveillance
while they were in the U.S.," prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, who is to be tried after Lindh, faces the death penalty
if convicted of charges involving conspiracy to commit terrorism in
concert with the Sept. 11 hijackers.</TE>

<HD>N.Y.'s Recycling Rollback Decried</HD>
<DH>Budget: Advocates for the homeless protest as the city
stops collecting glass and plastic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration significantly rolled back
recycling Monday--prompting criticism from advocates for the homeless
who said the effort to save $40 million will diminish a vital revenue
stream for the poor.</LD>
<LD>   With the city facing a $4.9-billion budget shortfall, residents
were ordered to stop separating plastic and glass from trash.
Sanitation workers will continue to pick up metal and paper for
recycling.</LD>
<LD>   For many, the new rules meant one less chore. But advocates
worried that the consequences could be dire for a subculture of the
homeless--the redeemers--who collect empty cans, plastic and glass
bottles and return them for a nickel deposit. They are a common sight
on some streets, wheeling carts full of the containers they have
gathered.</LD>
<TE>   "A redeemer can make between $15 and $35 a day," said Guy
Polhemus, founder and executive director of We Can, a nonprofit
recycling center where the homeless exchange containers for cash. "It
is not enough to move into Trump Tower, but it can be enough to
survive."</TE>
<TE>   Since its founding in 1986, We Can has paid out more than $30
million to the poor and homeless who redeemed more than 80,000 tons
of recyclables. Bottlers and distributors pay the organization a
2-cent handling fee per container.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups also attacked the move, saying it would curb
the public's enthusiasm for recycling in general.</TE>
<TE>   "It is going to be hard to restore the public's confidence in the
recycling program," said Laura Haight, a senior environmental
associate with the New York Public Interest Research Group. "You
can't turn on and off a public participation program like a light
switch."</TE>
<TE>   In a budget compromise with the City Council, which initially
protested the cutbacks, Bloomberg retained recycling for cans and
other metal products but halted separate collection of plastics for a
year and glass for two years.</TE>
<TE>   Sanitation officials said a market no longer exists for selling
glass and plastics for recycling--that even though New Yorkers
dutifully separated them from ordinary trash, these products ended up
in landfills. In the end, officials said, the program cost too much
for too little benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg said the cutback was temporary until a more
cost-efficient system could be established. "We all want recycling to
work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The economics of the marketplace were little comfort to advocates
who expressed concern that large numbers of homeless people might
turn to ripping open garbage bags piled on the streets, searching for
redeemable bottles.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, people can collect 5 cents for returning certain
empty bottles and cans.</TE>
<TE>   Polhemus said that in many cases, building owners had established
relationships with redeemers who collected plastics, cans and glass
from specially marked trash bags.</TE>
<TE>   "This essentially created a day job for a lot of people," he said.
"Ninety-eight percent of people don't redeem their containers, don't
take the time to go to a store and wait on line to get a nickel."</TE>
<TE>   Polhemus, a former media consultant, started We Can, which serves
as a redemption center for as many as 250 homeless people a day.
While volunteering in a soup kitchen, he observed that many of the
homeless were having a hard time collecting money for bottles and
cans.</TE>
<TE>   In a memory that still haunts him, a man who came into the soup
kitchen trying to redeem the containers he collected was thrown out.
The man later was discovered frozen to death with $30 worth of cans
and bottles at his side.</TE>
<TE>   "If he had been able to redeem it, he would have made it,"
Polhemus said. "Redemption money is the currency of the street."</TE>

<HD>Airport Security Flaws Bring Criticism</HD>
<DH>Screening: Employees missed a quarter of the fake weapons
smuggled by undercover agents. Some argue searches should be more
selective.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The fact that undercover agents continue to sneak dummy weapons
through airport security points to a need for better training of
screeners and highlights the problems of a system in a difficult
transition, Transportation Department officials acknowledged Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "We are making sure that what we learn from these tests becomes
incorporated into our training," said Mari K. Eder, a spokeswoman for
the new Transportation Security Administration. "That is why we were
conducting them in the first place."</LD>
<LD>   Critics said the TSA's tests--in which screeners missed about a
quarter of the fake guns and bombs in 387 smuggling attempts at 32
airports last month--demonstrate that airline security is still full
of holes.</LD>
<TE>   "It's old wine in a new bottle," said Brian Sullivan, a retired
Federal Aviation Administration security agent who was calling
attention to shortcomings long before the Sept. 11 attacks. He urged
better use of profiling to focus intensive searches on a relatively
small number of passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles International Airport ranked among the worst airports
in the test, with a failure rate of 41%. But Eder cautioned against
drawing broad conclusions about any one airport, since relatively few
tests were performed at each location. Agents conducted an average of
12 tests per airport, although some had as few as five.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles World Airports, the agency that operates LAX, declined
to comment. "We don't know how the tests were conducted [and] we
really don't have a sense of what the data means, if anything," said
an LAX official who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Most airport screeners are still employed by private security
companies, which are now under contract to the government instead of
to the airlines. A better-qualified federal screening force is
supposed to be in place by Nov. 19, but it is doubtful that all 429
commercial airports will meet that goal. About half of the current
screeners applying for federal positions did not pass the initial
selection process, TSA officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "TSA is transitioning to a new federal work force and it may not
be able to devote enough attention to the security companies that are
doing the screening," said Cathal Flynn, a retired FAA security
chief. "It may be difficult for the screening company personnel to
maintain motivation, since many of them run the risk of losing their
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "These are not good numbers," added Flynn, referring to the
results of the tests. "But there is a lot more to it." He called for
more sensitive metal detectors and X-ray machines at security
checkpoints, noting that much of the current equipment was inherited
from the airlines and is obsolete.</TE>
<TE>   The TSA refused to release details of the test results, which were
first reported Monday by USA Today. The TSA's Eder said the numbers
cited by the newspaper were "accurate" but "incomplete," since they
did not reflect additional tests conducted later in the month. "Those
numbers are giving you a snapshot, but it is not a complete
snapshot," she said. "They don't talk about other things that we are
doing. They don't talk about the fact that we continue to do security
screenings at the gate. As long as we continue to see that things are
going through the initial screening, we will continue to do security
screenings at the gate."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan, the retired FAA security agent, said the test results
should be jarring because the undercover officers probing the system
were instructed not to make dummy weapons difficult for screeners to
find.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can't notice easily identifiable test items, how are you
going to recognize Semtex (a plastic explosive)?" asked Sullivan. "If
there had been an attempt to use realistic terrorist tactics in these
tests, they wouldn't have caught many of them."</TE>
<TE>   A TSA official who asked not to be identified said that agency
personnel were disappointed with the results. "The testing was so
simple, it is not really accurate if you want to establish a baseline
for [terrorists using] trickery," said the official. "It's still the
same [flawed security]--it's just costing a lot more money."</TE>
<TE>   Persistent problems with porous checkpoints are generating
pressure on the agency to be more selective in deciding whom to
search more closely among millions of daily passengers.</TE>
<TE>   The airlines, pilot groups and many security experts are urging
the agency to rely on computerized passenger profiling, which would
lead to more intensive searches of a smaller number of travelers.
Such a system is in use; a more extensive version is being developed.</TE>
<TE>   The profiling system attempts to detect unusual behavior by
prospective passengers, focusing primarily on travel patterns and
financial transactions, not racial or ethnic criteria. Known as
CAPPS--computer-assisted passenger pre-screening--it selected six of
the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers for additional screening. At the time, the
only follow-up required was closer inspection of their checked
baggage, which revealed nothing. Procedures have since been
tightened.</TE>
<TE>   "The screeners can't be asked to find every sharp item that
exists," said Anya Piazza, a spokeswoman for the Air Line Pilots
Assn. "TSA has to change a threat-driven enforcement model. We
shouldn't be checking nonthreatening people."</TE>
<TE>   Pilots and flight attendants are campaigning for a high-tech
identification card that would exempt crew members from extensive
searches at checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   The program could later be expanded to include frequent travelers
who agree to a background check. However, such improvements could be
a year or more away.</TE>

season.</DH>

<DL>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Residents hoping to get driver's licenses and summer tourists looking
for information ran into "closed" signs Monday, the first day of a
partial government shutdown while the Tennessee Legislature tries to
resolve the state's budget.</LD>
<LD>   For weeks, lawmakers have haggled over proposed taxes to help
resolve an $800-million deficit in the budget that was to take effect
Monday. Their negotiations were continuing.</LD>
<LD>   But because lawmakers missed a deadline, Gov. Don Sundquist was
allowed to fund only essential services through Friday. About 22,000
of the state's 42,000 employees were placed on unpaid leave--and
Sundquist, a lame-duck Republican, claimed they were paying the price
for the lawmakers' indecision.</LD>
<TE>   Those on leave included most employees of the Department of
Tourism, which shuttered the state's 13 welcome centers for the July
4 holiday week.</TE>
<TE>   "Annually, we have 14 million people coming through those centers,
and this is our most busy week," tourism commissioner John Wade said.</TE>
<TE>   With the restrooms locked at the Tennessee Welcome Center at the
Georgia border, dozens of travelers in need ran to the trees in back
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It will hurt their state budget more to have these places
closed," said Ruthann Jaquette, traveling from Michigan to an Atlanta
baseball tournament with a group of boys who joined the sprint to the
woods.</TE>
<TE>   The closures could cost the Tennessee Aquarium about 3,000 weekly
visitors who are normally steered there by welcome centers, said
Cindy Todd, a spokeswoman for the Chattanooga attraction.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the biggest week of the entire year for us. The timing
couldn't be worse," she said. "This is just more lost revenue for the
state."</TE>
<TE>   It's also peak time for state parks, which remained open with
small crews. Road projects were stopped as the Department of
Transportation operated with 100 of its 4,500 employees.</TE>
<TE>   State historians said the last time government services were
scaled back this far was when Tennessee fell to Union forces in the
Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   Joey Frank Jr., 21, had his brother drive him to renew his license
in Nashville but they found only a "closed" sign. Told that
legislators had failed to pass a budget, Frank said, "They can't
manage their money so they shut down everything and it affects us."</TE>
<TE>   Linda McCarty, executive director of the Tennessee State Employees
Assn., said about 20% of the state work force is eligible for
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "They may decide that it's not worth putting up with the
instability of their employer," McCarty said.</TE>
<TE>   At the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, few classes were held
Monday after the first summer session was cut short Friday due to the
budget impasse.</TE>
<TE>   At the McClung Museum, a "closed" sign hung on the front door.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are from Tennessee, we hope you will remember this
situation at the polls in November," the sign read.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are a visitor from out of state, we apologize."</TE>

<HD>Cleanup of Toxic Wastes Will Be Halted at 33 Superfund
Sites</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration plans to stop the cleanup of toxic wastes at
33 federally designated Superfund sites in 19 states, according to an
Environmental Protection Agency report released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Among the sites that have received no federal cleanup funds this
fiscal year are a chemical plant in New Jersey that produced Agent
Orange, two abandoned mines in Montana and the northeast Denver site
of a former smelting operation, according to the report, which was
released by two Democratic members of Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Regional EPA authorities requested and received some federal
cleanup funds for four of California's 36 priority Superfund sites.
They requested no funds for continued work at the other sites,
including four designated areas in North Hollywood, Burbank and
Glendale, where the San Fernando Valley groundwater basin is
contaminated with chemical solvents used in aerospace and defense
manufacturing.</LD>
<TE>   The report by the inspector general's office of the EPA
highlighted that financial responsibility for the shrinking number of
cleanups will soon shift completely from oil and chemical companies
to all taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   But the EPA's chief spokesman strongly rebutted that reading of
the report, calling it "a snapshot in time" that does not accurately
reflect how the agency's decisions "evolve through the fiscal year."</TE>
<TE>   The situation at about 15 of the 33 non-funded sites has changed,
the spokesman, Joe Martyak, said. Three of the sites may not need
additional funds, for example, two sites will get requested funding,
and officials at some sites have decided they can't use the money
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still spending as much money as we were before, $1.2
billion per year," Martyak said. "We still very much believe in the
'polluter pays' system," he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the source of cleanup funds for the remaining sites has
shifted dramatically, he acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   When Congress created the Superfund in 1980 to pay to clean sites
where the polluter cannot be identified or refused to pay, it levied
a tax on oil and chemical companies. But Congress allowed the
Superfund tax to expire in 1995, and the fund balance has shrunk from
its high of $3.8 billion in 1996 to a projected total of just $28
million next year.</TE>
<TE>   The tax is "on everyone in an industry, so that even those who
have the best of environmental records are also paying," EPA
Administrator Christie Whitman told a congressional hearing this
year.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, funds for future cleanup efforts at orphan sites must
come from general tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   During President Clinton's second term, Superfund cleanups were
completed at an average of 87 sites each year, according to the
office of Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.). Under the Bush
administration, 47 sites were cleaned up in 2001, and 40 are expected
to be finished this year, according to communications among Whitman,
Dingell and Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.).</TE>
<TE>   But EPA's Martyak said those numbers were misleading. "We're
dealing now with larger, more complex sites," he said.</TE>

<DH>State high court ruling that some see as discriminatory to
older workers defies logic and history, foes say</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE and MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Does the name Col. Sanders mean anything to you? How about Famous
Amos? Ever hear of him? And what do you  remember first about Betty
Friedan? These midlife-career switch-hitters exerted a powerful
influence on American culture, and all of them were over age 40 when
they did it.</LD>
<LD>   Plenty of other people might have slipped into obscurity too, if
they had not started over at midlife or beyond. To them, in
particular, a California Supreme Court ruling last week must feel
like a slap in the face.</LD>
<LD>   The court ruled that employers can decide who will or will not
receive certain employee benefits, based on age, without violating
state law.</LD>
<TE>   Workers over 40 are protected by law from age discrimination only
when it comes to hiring, firing, promoting or suspension, the court
said.</TE>
<TE>   The case involved Dan Esberg of Corona who sued his employer,
Union Oil Co. of California, after he was turned down at age 56 for
company benefits to help finance a master's degree in business
administration. He said his supervisor told him, "You're too old to
invest in." Three months later, the company granted tuition
reimbursement to three younger employees.</TE>
<TE>   What if Col. Harland Sanders, at 65, hadn't walked away from his
gas station and cafe in Corbin, Ky., to franchise his fast-food
chain, Kentucky Fried Chicken? Where would chocolate-chip cookie
lovers be if Wally Amos had stuck to his career as a talent agent
instead of opening his first Famous Amos store in Los Angeles when he
was pushing 40? And if Betty Friedan had stuck to newspaper reporting
at the age of 42 instead of writing her book "The Feminine Mystique"
in 1963, just imagine. There might never have been a modern feminist
movement.</TE>
<TE>   The court's ruling on age discrimination is "tantamount to saying,
'Let's send whites to graduate school but not blacks,' " bristles Dr.
Ed Schneider, dean of the Andrus Gerontology Center at USC. "Racism
and sexism are covered under the law. What about ageism?"</TE>
<TE>   George Shannon gave up a 30-year acting career to pursue a
doctorate in the USC gerontology program. "I found the ruling
appalling," says Shannon, 62.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a trend for older workers to return to school and
find new opportunities in the workplace," he says. "This ruling is
contrary and counter to that." He is financing his own schooling, but
it's the principle of the ruling that irks him.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Sawyer, 50, who received his master's degree two months
ago from USC, says the ruling opens the door for corporate America
"to take a calculator to an employee's age and say, 'Well, he's 55
right now, and he won't be with us at 62, so why should we invest in
this person's education?' They're just shooting themselves in the
foot. It's the brain trust that employers should value.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies should see the benefit of higher education at any age,"
says Sawyer, whose employer, Southern California Presbyterian Homes,
based in Glendale, paid for his $25,000 graduate education.</TE>
<TE>   Grace O'Brien, 75, put herself through college later in life after
a career with Delta Airlines. Workers who can't afford continuing
education without help from their employers are the hardest hit by
the new ruling, she says. For older workers to be refused tuition
reimbursement "implies that you can't be a productive person after a
certain age," says O'Brien, who now does public speaking about the
aging experience and writes poetry. A lot of older adults have more
to give in the way of creativity, productivity and not the least
important, loyalty, she says.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics bear her out. Business analyst Roger Selbert of Santa
Monica, who edits and publishes a newsletter called Growth
Strategies, compiled a trend report featuring older workers for his
June issue. He reports that workers over age 50 tend to remain with
their companies until retirement while younger employees are likely
to move around. For employers, that amounts to a better return on
their training investment.</TE>
<TE>   Selbert also reports that workers in their 50s and older take
fewer days off for illness and personal or family problems. They have
more training and experience than their younger counterparts. Despite
these findings, ageism has spread, he says. "It used to be that
discrimination was against workers in their 50s. Now it's workers in
their 40s."</TE>
<TE>   "Why put an age cap on learning?" asks UC Irvine professor Judy B.
Rosener, 72, who joined the graduate school of management there 20
years ago. She earned her PhD at age 50. "There is all kinds of data
to indicate that older people are returning to higher education and
working a lot longer," she argues.</TE>
<TE>   Shocked as she was by last week's ruling, Rosener doesn't dispute
the logic.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was sitting on the California Supreme Court I'd have to rule
the same way," she says. The existing rule concerning employment
practice fails to include a reference to "age" in its list of
protected categories. A person can't be discriminated against based
on race, religion, creed, national origin, ancestry, physical or
mental disabilities, medical condition, marital status, sex or sexual
orientation. But age is apparently acceptable. "The first remedy is
to change the law," says Rosener. "Get the Legislature to amend it."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Gloria Negrete McLeod (D-Chino), 61, has introduced
a bill to protect older workers from age discrimination in relation
to employee benefits such as tuition reimbursement, compensation,
vacations and stock options.</TE>
<TE>   "This is new territory," says Fernando Torres-Gil, director of the
UCLA Center for Policy Research on Aging. "The courts are engaged in
very murky human concerns where there are no easy answers, and we
have to make it up as we go along."</TE>

<HD>Getting Confidential With James Ellroy</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a perfectly brilliant Sunday afternoon, custom-made for the
roller-blader and mountain bike set. Consequently, the discussion
inside the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills seemed a bit
incongruous. Noir novelist James Ellroy, 54, was detailing the long
afternoons in the late 1960s he spent injecting liquid
methamphetamine and hallucinating. "I would look at women in Playboy
magazine and they would talk to me," he told a crowd of writers and
fans. At the time, he explained, "I was an acquired taste that no one
acquired."</LD>
<LD>   Ellroy, who was interviewed by noir writer Bruce Wagner as part of
the Writers Bloc literary series, wore a beige jacket, tangerine
pullover and his trademark round-framed glasses. He leaned back in
his chair and spoke deeply into his microphone, filling the
auditorium with prose rich in obscenities. Ellroy spun colorful tales
of sex, drugs, murder and his awkward adolescence. The crowd hung on
every word. As a teenager, he recalled, he shoplifted steaks from the
Hollywood Ranch market and stuffed them into his pants. "Sometimes,
the plastic wrapping would break and blood would run down my legs,"
he said, savoring the macabre nature of his tale.</LD>
<TE>   Ellroy's writing career coincided with sobriety after years of
drinking and drug use ("I was on marijuana maintenance until 1977,"
he said. "As you know, it's not habit-forming, so you can do it every
day."). Since then, he has written more than 15 novels, including a
series of four that offer a brutal portrait of 1950s Los Angeles.
He's best known for "The Black Dahlia" and "L.A. Confidential," which
later became a film starring Russell Crowe.</TE>
<TE>   When the conversation turned to politics, he shared his disdain
for former President Bill Clinton with a phrase that cannot be
printed here. He cited "The No-Spin Zone" by Fox News Channel talk
show host Bill O'Reilly as his favorite nonfiction work.</TE>
<TE>   Ellroy left L.A. in the early '80s. He and his wife, writer Helen
Knode, live in Kansas City. "It's the white trash comfort zone to
which I've long aspired."</TE>
<TE>   A Different Kind of Drama in Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   It was crisis time at the closing gala of the Los Angeles Film
Festival. The Saturday night screening of "The Good Girl" was already
30 minutes late, its star, Jennifer Aniston, was nowhere in sight,
and there were no empty seats in the Pacific Theater in Hollywood.
David Duchovny and Ben Stiller wandered the aisles. A few women in
headsets searched frantically for open seats. "How was the press line
tonight?" one man asked another. "Actually, it was kind of nice."
Just ahead of them, Heather Graham had slipped in with a few friends,
after rushing down the red carpet, ignoring the crowd of
photographers, who roundly "booed" her into the theater. Inside, a
man working the event was shouting across the theater: "David
Duchovny!" The actor looked up. He was led with Stiller to a seat. As
Duchovny passed Graham, she joked about her poor reception on the
carpet. "It was trauma!" Everyone had grown a little anxious waiting
for Aniston. Finally, the film's director, Miguel Arteta, took the
podium. Seconds later, Aniston arrived sans husband Brad Pitt and
discreetly took an aisle seat. Arteta summed up the scene with his
opening line: "We are a tough town here in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote:</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time I've really had the guts to go for
something knowing I might get critically savaged for it," pop star
George Michael told the London Daily Mirror this week, in reference
to his new single, "Shoot the Dog." In the animated video, Prime
Minister Tony Blair is portrayed as a poodle being tickled by George
W. Bush. "There's always been this nagging worry of people saying,
'Look, mate, you're a rich pampered pop star, what ... do you know
about it?' But now I feel confident enough to just go for it. And I
should have a right to say these things without being ripped to
pieces."</TE>

<LD>   The Craft of Biography and Autobiography</LD>
<LD>   By Michael Holroyd</LD>
<TE>   Counterpoint</TE>
<TE>   320 pages, $27</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The moon is a dead body, having nothing but reflected light: but
it can blot out the sun," writes Michael Holroyd, explaining why
people often fear becoming the subject of biographies. "Whenever a
writer, artist, musician, any man or woman of imagination, is made
the subject of a biography, his or her light may be extinguished."</TE>
<TE>   This is an interesting position for one of England's most
preeminent biographers to take: Holroyd has written the lives of
Augustus John, Lytton Strachey and George Bernard Shaw. Holroyd uses
his devil's advocate position to combat objections to biography
("those who fear biography so much are the very people who have made
it additionally fearful by putting in the way obstacles which
impoverish the quality of the Life without preventing its
publication") and to bring respect to the often maligned job of the
biographer. "By recreating the past we are calling on the same magic
as our forebears did with stories of their ancestors round the fires
under the night skies. The need to do this, to keep death in its
place, lies deep in human nature, and the art of biography arises
from that need. This is its justification."</TE>
<TE>   "Works on Paper: The Craft of Biography and Autobiography" is
Holroyd's celebration of biographical writing, an oddly arranged, at
times esoteric but engaging compilation that looks into the craft of
writing lives from an erudite (rather than "how to") point of view.
In 39 disparate essays dating from the 1970s, Holroyd discusses the
strengths and weaknesses, purpose and ethics of writing biography and
autobiography and introduces readers to many British artists and
writers.</TE>
<TE>   His discussion of biographical subjects focuses primarily on 20th
century British writers and painters, many of whom may be familiar to
readers--Evelyn Waugh, J.R. Ackerley, Osbert and Edith Sitwell,
Katherine Mansfield, Rudyard Kipling, E.M. Forster, Quentin
Crisp--while others may seem more obscure--J.L. Carr, John Stewart
Collis, Harley Granville Barker.</TE>
<TE>   The highlight of the book is "The Making of Bernard Shaw,"
Holroyd's fascinating account of taking the commission to write the
official biography of Shaw in the late 1960s and the battles that
delayed the work until it was finally published in 1988. A bitter and
at times ridiculous war raged between Holroyd and a lifelong expert
in Shavian scholarship who was miffed at not having been chosen for
the commission himself. The rival tried to stop Holroyd's efforts,
determined not to allow him to succeed with his work; he considered
Holroyd "an incorrigible fool," who, despite years of research, knew
"bloody nothing about Shaw." In one eerie scene, Holroyd visits the
scholar's apartment and finds a setup whereby he could, at the switch
of a button, flash Shaw's words onto a screen. The rival "was pleased
with this device, which, if he chose, he could operate while lying
down. But to me it presented a frightful warning. I began to see the
lengths to which a lonely obsession could, in the pursuit of
excellence, lead any of us."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways "Works on Paper" reads as the literary equivalent of
a "Best Of" album--a collection culled from works previously
published in which the essays, prefaces and introductions lack
cohesiveness. And though the book includes a section about the
writing of autobiography, there's nothing from Holroyd's point of
view about his own experience as an autobiographer. This is
surprising, since, as the author of the well-received "Basil Street
Blues," he would certainly have something to offer on this subject.
Even the book's ostensible subject matter is not large enough to hold
Holroyd's manifold subjects. The last grouping, "Enthusiasms and
Alibis" is a catch-all for essays that don't fully fit. "Among the
Americans," for instance, is a quite dated 1978 piece about living in
New York and "A Dark Adapted Eye" tells of Holroyd's love-hate
relationship with television. In "The Battle for the Public Lending
Right," Holroyd writes captivatingly of his efforts to bring about
the British practice of paying authors for the use of their books in
libraries--an essay that makes one wish we had a similar situation in
the U.S. but which has little to do with the crafting of biography.</TE>
<TE>   As a whole, the book provides a profile of many great 20th century
British authors and artists, and a glimpse into the slippery terrain
of crafting another's life. Well written, at times wryly funny,
"Works on Paper" is not light reading but offers entry into Holroyd's
biographical obsessions.</TE>

<LD>Now that it's summer, people will go to the beach to relax and play.
Here in Southern California we enjoy access to many wonderful
beaches. What do you wear and what do you take with you to the beach?</LD>
<LD>   Look closely at this scene, "The Beach at Trouville," painted by
the French artist Louis-Eugene Boudin in 1873. Why are the beachgoers
wearing formal clothing and carrying umbrellas? Believe it or not, in
the 19th century it was considered improper to wear a bathing suit or
get a tan.</LD>
<LD>   This particular beach is in the north of France, quite a distance
from Paris--the big city where most of the vacationers lived. To get
to the beach they took the train. Tourism and train travel were new
ideas in the 19th century.</LD>
<TE>   Another new idea was painting directly from nature. Before the
mid-19th century, even landscape painters stayed inside their
studios. Then, artists became fascinated with light, color and
changes in the weather. Boudin was among the first artists to take
his paints and canvases outdoors. He went to the beach to paint.
Vacationers from Paris bought his beach pictures, much the same way
that we buy souvenirs or postcards on our trips.</TE>
<TE>   A summer visit to the Norton Simon Museum is like a trip to the
beach for your eyes and imagination. Summer Fun Days take place every
Thursday through July and August. On July 11 and Aug. 8 you can spend
"An Afternoon at the Beach" from 1 to 2 p.m., when you'll be able to
explore great art works about the beach, write poetry and draw by the
garden pond. And you won't have to wear fancy clothes or carry an
umbrella!</TE>
<TE>   For more information about the museum and its Summer Fun Days call
(626) 844-6980 or visit www.nortonsimon.org.</TE>

<DH>A friendly rivalry to grow the biggest orange globe yields
a few white lies</DH>
<SE>The Pumpkin Files / One in an occasional series</SE>
<AU>DUANE NORIYUKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A good pumpkin, like a good lie, creates wonder and, sometimes,
suspicion. This time of year, in the Lake Arrowhead area in the San
Bernardino Mountains, plants and lies grow bigger by the day, and
growers anticipate a bumper crop of both.</LD>
<LD>   Cheri Altmeyer, 37, and her 3-year-old son, Brian, kissed their
seeds in early June before gently placing them into the ground like
soft petals. The Altmeyers are the reigning pumpkin champs, and as
they embark on this new season, they aim to keep it that way.</LD>
<LD>   Between now and October, however, they and their fellow
contestants must avoid or overcome a litany of potential downfalls,
including gophers and thieves and bugs and bears. They will utilize
secret techniques and spy on their competitors, who are doing the
same. The winner, with little fanfare, will be crowned around
Halloween.</LD>
<TE>   The contest, sponsored by a local grocery store, is in its 13th
year. To win, pumpkins need not be particularly handsome, fine
skinned or well proportioned, as this is no beauty contest. There are
no subjective contingencies, and merit is based on one clearly
defined objective. The heaviest pumpkin wins.</TE>
<TE>   The aesthetics are in the deceit. When contestants see one another
at the post office or the store, lies come buzzing out of their
mouths like crazed bees from a ransacked hive.</TE>
<TE>   "Golf-ball size," one might say in a perfectly steady voice.</TE>
<TE>   "Tennis balls," the other will say with a sly grin.</TE>
<TE>   When entrants see one another at the nursery, they peer out of the
corners of their eyes to see what fertilizers their competitors might
reach for on the shelves.</TE>
<TE>   "Should work just fine on my roses," one might say at the cash
register, just loud enough for the other to hear.</TE>
<TE>   And that is how the game is played. Every once in a while, just to
complicate matters, someone will tell the truth. It's a dirty,
lowdown trick, but no one ever said growing pumpkins was for the
squeaky clean.</TE>
<TE>   And since they can't trust their competitors' words, they resort
to espionage. Jerry Fulton's size-9 1/2 footprints are all over the
mountain, most frequently somewhere near a pumpkin patch.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all part of the fun," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The Altmeyers used to have a burro named Jacques that would bray
whenever Fulton, founder of the contest, approached. Cheri Altmeyer
would hear the commotion, step out on the deck and shout, "What's
going on down there?"</TE>
<TE>   And there, gazing at her pumpkins, would be Fulton and,
oftentimes, Altmeyer's neighbor Ron Bench, another contestant, taking
inventory.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, just poisoning your plants," Fulton would say.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't you guys have anything better to do?"</TE>
<TE>   Turns out they didn't. Bench, a retired firefighter, now runs his
own painting business but focuses on that which brings him closer to
life's truer meaning: family, friends, pumpkins.</TE>
<TE>   Fulton, after graduating from the local high school in 1957 and
quitting college after six years, embarked on a search for his place
in life. He managed a couple of businesses in the area and, finally,
a few years ago, discovered his true calling.</TE>
<TE>   "Retirement," he says.</TE>
<TE>   So at age 63, Fulton focuses on pumpkins, his first grandchild and
"shooting the breeze" with friends. Every morning he goes to the post
office to pick up the mail, and, perhaps, stop at the store to pick
up a few things. It's a process that could be completed in, say, 20
minutes, but it takes him up to three hours.</TE>
<TE>   All the entrants, it seems, get into the spirit of the contest.
Indeed, when Fulton returns home after a pleasant afternoon of
spying, he is likely to notice a few unfamiliar footprints around his
own carefully raked garden.</TE>
<TE>   In other parts of the country, primarily in New England, pumpkin
growing is serious business, like hogs in Iowa, football in Texas or
pedicures in Beverly Hills. Pumpkins the size of SUVs earn thousands
of dollars in prize money. Contestants install expensive surveillance
and irrigation systems. As harvest approaches, they sleep next to
their pumpkins to protect them from ne'er-do-wells.</TE>
<TE>   But here the competition is friendly, and no one sleeps with
pumpkins. They are liars but not cheaters. They're not vying for
thousands of dollars in prize money. Altmeyer last year took home a
winner's check for $200, the most ever, and the honor of hosting this
year's end-of-the-season barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   Here they do it not for fame or fortune but for the fun and
challenge, they say. If nothing else, it keeps them off the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "Bragging rights is the main thing," Fulton says.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year there are nine entrants, although there still may
be a few latecomers. Each June they start ponying up their $15, which
goes toward prize money, and setting forth on secret strategies,
ranging from well-timed applications of burro manure or seaweed or
fish extract to the use of gizmos and gadgets and experimental
techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Bench, Altmeyer's neighbor, seemed a shoo-in. When his
pumpkin was placed on the butcher's scale, it weighed in at 187
pounds, breaking his old record.</TE>
<TE>   One of the rules--there aren't many--is that when it comes time to
remove the pumpkin from the vine, someone else from the contest must
serve as witness. This is to discourage anyone from driving to
Canada, buying a 1,000-pounder and then entering it here.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Altmeyer called Fulton. They removed her pumpkin from
the garden, loaded it up and took it down to Jensen's, the store in
nearby Blue Jay that sponsors the contest and where each pumpkin is
weighed. When they placed it on the scale, they couldn't believe
their eyes. Altmeyer and Fulton hugged in disbelief. It was a
glorious moment in local pumpkin history. For the first time ever,
the 200-pound mark had been surpassed. Altmeyer's prized fruit
weighed in at 208 pounds. There were tears in Fulton's eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Bench was left scratching his head. His karma, however, is good,
and he will certainly be a force to be reckoned with this time
around. Each year he gives away some of his plants, hoping others
will join in the fun. To him, the competition is about more than
winning and lying and espionage. It's about being a good neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a time when you baked two pies," he says, "one for
yourself and one for the neighbors. We've gotten away from that."</TE>
<TE>   He and Fulton have formed an alliance this year. Fulton shared
with him some seeds he bought from an undisclosed source. Their hopes
have been raised.</TE>
<TE>   This is a pivotal year for Fulton. Shortly after planting this
year's crop, he and his wife, Kay, put their home of 33 years on the
market. Their two children grew up in the house. Jerry did all the
stonework, building a waterfall and pond and a network of bridges in
the yard.</TE>
<TE>   He says that even if the house sold tomorrow, he would make sure
he was able to finish one last season in his beloved garden, where he
has diligently worked to improve the soil and where he drew Kay's
wrath last year when he cut down two trees that were blocking the
light.</TE>
<TE>   "She almost killed me over that one," he says.</TE>
<TE>   They will probably buy another home, a smaller place, in the area,
one with a nice sunny spot for pumpkins. But that he must say goodbye
to his beloved patch makes him the sentimental favorite this year.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, he could be lying through his teeth about the
whole thing.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, spring. Cheri Altmeyer lives for it. She sometimes thinks she
was meant for an earlier time, when people lived off the land. When
the weather turns warm, she starts spending more and more time
outdoors. The housework doesn't always get done as promptly and fully
as it does in winter, but dinner still gets put on the table, and no
one is wearing dirty underwear, she says.</TE>
<TE>   So give her a break.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, Jeff, owns a construction business. In the winter he
plows snow, and when he has time in the summer, he helps in the
garden. They have three children, all of whom have taken their turns
as babies seated at garden's edge as Cheri dug in the dirt. The girls
are school-age now, so many days it is just Cheri and Brian tending
to the pumpkins.</TE>
<TE>   She has been in the contest since its inception and won it the
first two years. Her first winning pumpkin weighed a mere 40
pounds--each year the winner has tipped the scales further. There was
a long dry spell before last year's return to pumpkin glory. In
between victories, there was heartbreak.</TE>
<TE>   One year, her best pumpkin was stolen right before the
competition. She thinks she knows who did it, and it was no one
associated with the contest, just a person with an uncontrolled
liking for big pumpkins.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the year a gopher dug a tunnel right underneath her
biggest pumpkin, chewed its way inside and ate out the innards. When
they went to lift it, it was hollowed out. There are various means of
discouraging gophers from ravaging pumpkins. Most of them end in
death. If there is a dark side to pumpkin growers, it has to do with
their relationship with gophers.</TE>
<TE>   Altmeyer has slain them with garden tools and now utilizes a death
trap known as "the black hole." She may not like them, but she
respects them. "They're smarter than you think," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Brad and Cathy Burns, like Altmeyer, seem to be somewhat normal.
Well, maybe not normal. One year Brad drove to Yucaipa on Valentine's
Day and returned with a unique expression of his love for Cathy: a
load of chicken poop.</TE>
<TE>   "Who else would do that?" Cathy swoons.</TE>
<TE>   They have twice won the contest and are, above all, ethical
people. Brad, 47, works in law enforcement for the U.S. Forest
Service; Cathy, 40, is a substitute teacher. While some pumpkin
growers, Fulton among them, do not entrust pollination to natural
elements and take matters into their own hands, Cathy would never
dream of interfering with such an intimate process.</TE>
<TE>   "We're Catholic," she says.</TE>
<TE>   But when it comes to gophers, no reference is made to the Vatican.
The Burnses are not opposed to traps or electrical current or the old
hose-down-the-hole routine, whatever means might rid their patch of
the intruders, which last year gutted their best pumpkin. Pity the
gopher that tries it again this year.</TE>
<TE>   Bears, however, are a different story. One of the competitors, Ron
Dolman, reported that his pumpkins were dug up this year by a bear,
forcing him to replant and start anew. If he's telling the truth, he
may not be able to catch up with the others. One year Dolman showed
up at the weigh-ins with a pumpkin torn up into numerous pieces.
Bears, he said. Still, he put on his best showing. One by one the
pieces were placed on the scale. It was a sad sight.</TE>
<TE>   There also has been scandal, or at least near-scandal, in the
contest. One entrant used to have his employees grow his pumpkins. It
just didn't seem right, the others decided, so they made a rule that
contestants had to grow their own pumpkins on their own property.</TE>
<TE>   This year's favorites, Fulton says, are Bench, the retired
firefighter, and the defending champions, the Altmeyers. The
Altmeyers already have suffered a setback, though. Seeds they paid $5
each for proved to be rotten, forcing a second planting. Fortunately,
they kept seeds from last year's winner.</TE>
<TE>   There also are dark horses. One of them is Ron McAllister, a
relative newcomer who has never won but who has people talking this
year. It seems, says Fulton, that rather than mixing fertilizer into
the soil, McAllister has planted his seeds directly into piles of
chicken manure.</TE>
<TE>   "He hedged on that the other night, so I'm not sure," says Fulton.</TE>
<TE>   "Might work," says Bench, raising a brow.</TE>
<TE>   McAllister's pumpkins are planted on the side of a hill, where
they get plenty of sunlight. His plants are off to a strong
start--already the size of redwoods--and surrounded by size-9 1/2
footprints.</TE>

<HD>The Two Sides of Coined Phrases</HD>
<DH>It's survival of the catchiest in the evolution of Sept.
11-speak: Some stick, others don't.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENEE TAWA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The phrase sinks in with sound-bite precision: "threat fatigue," a
condition in which Americans--weary of false alarms--no longer take
terrorism warnings seriously.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, the New York Times quoted unnamed senior government
officials who first used the phrase to partly explain why they did
not issue a public warning on the possibility of a terrorist attack
around the Fourth of July. Since then, other media have picked up the
reference, the latest addition to the evolving Sept. 11-related
lexicon.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the new words and phrases don't stick, but "threat
fatigue" appears to have staying power, said Paul J.J. Payack,
president and chief executive of the Web portal YourDictionary.com.
"It's excellent," Payack said. "It gets right to the point. Everyone
knows what you mean as soon as you say it."</LD>
<TE>   "Threat fatigue" reflects a growing public inclination to tune out
the slew of news reports--corroborated by authorities or not--about
possible attacks on such targets as apartment buildings, California
bridges and Catalina Island.</TE>
<TE>   The phrase is part of an expanding list of references that make
sense only in the context of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In April, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer tried to rework the
phrase "suicide bomber" to more strongly focus on the killings
involved in the Palestinian attacks in crowded Israeli locations. He
coined "homicide bomber" in its place, but it never caught on.</TE>
<TE>   The original phrase already was well known, Payack pointed out.
"You can spin it in other ways, but it's still suicide bombing," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, words or phrases that are coined to describe
new situations have a better chance of sticking.</TE>
<TE>   Catch phrases, in fact, tend to come about when two familiar words
such as "threat" and "fatigue" are put together in a new context that
makes immediate sense. The concept spins off the already familiar
phrase "donor fatigue." Other word combinations would not have
resonated before the terrorist attacks--"weaponized anthrax," "shoe
bomber" or "dirty bomb."</TE>
<TE>   Since the attacks in New York and on the Pentagon, linguistic
experts have tracked developments in the language as a kind of
metaphor to reflect the changing times. The new words and phrases
typically start in the media or in government. But, like "homicide
bombers," not all Sept. 11-related phrases catch on, including "the
color wheel of terror," which columnist Arianna Huffington used to
describe the government's color-coded alert system reflecting five
levels of terror warnings.</TE>
<TE>   Also, several nominations for the American Dialect Society's Words
of the Year list for 2001 no longer pop up in common usage. Among
them: "facial profiling," the scanning of faces on video as a tool to
help identify possible terrorists, and "burka blue," describing the
color of the head-to-toe covering worn by some Afghan women.</TE>

<LD>The door to Mayor Bassett's general store was open when Glory and

<LD>   Quentin's eyes went immediately to the candy counter. "Can I get
some spearmint gum?" he asked.</LD>
<LD>   "No," Glory said. "We're here to look for the flag."</LD>
<TE>   Where could it be? In the rack with the mops and brooms? On the

<TE>   Mayor Bassett came from his back room. "Oh, there you are, Glory
Halliburton," he said. "I found the flag."</TE>
<TE>   "Good," said Glory.</TE>
<TE>   "No, bad," the mayor said. "I left it in my back room last year
with the cow fodder and the chicken feed. The mice ate it." He held
out his hands.</TE>
<TE>   There was a shred of red, a bite of white, and a clue or two of
blue. "I'm sorry, Glory."</TE>
<TE>   Glory was sorry, too. She felt tears gather in her eyes like a
July rain cloud.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe someone else has a big flag," Mayor Bassett suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll help you look for one, Glory," Quentin said. But what he was
looking at was the candy counter.</TE>
<TE>   "Good boy," Mayor Bassett said. "Here, I'll give you some
spearmint gum for being such a good helper." He fished a package from
the counter and gave it to Quentin.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you." Quentin put all five sticks in his mouth and chewed
happily.</TE>
<TE>   How could he be so happy when Glory was so miserable? "Come on,
Quentin," she said. "Let's go find a flag."</TE>
<TE>   At every house they passed, people were getting ready to go to the
park. Nobody had a flag big enough to lead a parade.</TE>
<TE>   But Mrs. Arbuckle asked if they would like a ride to the park.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, please," Glory said sadly.</TE>
<TE>   It was too late now to find a big flag.</TE>

<HD>If Anger Still Burns, Has Passion Died?</HD>
<DH>The public spat between Tatum O'Neal and John McEnroe may
betray unresolved emotions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA PICCALO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been nearly a decade since their six-year marriage ended, but
like so many divorced couples, John McEnroe and Tatum O'Neal continue
to be emotionally entangled. The pair have been exchanging venomous
barbs with the ferocity of the recently separated. McEnroe fired
first last month. His new memoir, "You Cannot Be Serious" takes
swipes at O'Neal's failures as a mother to their three children, her
emotional volatility, her battles with drugs and her unsuccessful
attempts to rekindle her acting career.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal fired back mightily last week. She called McEnroe "a
sociopath" in a British tabloid. In an interview with Barbara
Walters, she claimed he used steroids and that they made the tennis
champ emotionally and physically abusive. O'Neal, on the cover of
this week's People, tells the magazine that just before the marriage
ended, McEnroe pushed her down the stairs while screaming
obscenities. McEnroe continued the volley from Wimbledon, where he
was working as TV sports commentator, calling O'Neal's accusations
"ridiculous."</LD>
<TE>   When celebrities go public with their personal dramas, they offer
the rest of us an exaggerated glimpse of ourselves. And, undoubtedly,
their failures remind us that money and fame aren't synonymous with
happiness. Perhaps that's why the O'Neal-McEnroe exchange has
attracted so much coverage during the last two weeks. Even the games
at Wimbledon were overshadowed by the public spat as reporters
covering the game sought sound bites from McEnroe.</TE>
<TE>   "The celebrity culture is very addictive and very attractive,"
said Nancy Snow, a UCLA sociologist. "Part of it is that they live
differently than us, but part of the appeal is that we do like to see
them fall off those pedestals."</TE>
<TE>   This week, McEnroe and O'Neal took their place in the endless line
of celebrities who have aired their dirty laundry in a global forum.
But their problems aren't much different than those that plague any
divorced couple with children, psychologists say.</TE>
<TE>   Intense hostility that survives the end of a relationship may
never be extinguished, especially if the relationship was tumultuous
and involves the co-parenting of children, say psychologists. After
divorce, there may be a lot of unresolved emotions that can reignite
at the slightest provocation or life change--a child's offhand remark
about an ex-spouse, for instance, a remarriage or a career change.</TE>
<TE>   Constance Ahrons, author of "The Good Divorce: Keeping Your Family
Together When Your Marriage Comes Apart," has spent 20 years studying
89 divorced couples with children. She said 20% of the couples were
"still fuming" two decades after their split.</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe and O'Neal met at a party in the Hollywood Hills in 1984
and immediately began an intense love affair. "Maybe my fiery spirit
reminded her of her father's own famous temper," McEnroe writes. "For
my part, I liked her confidence, her total ease in the midst of this
star-studded evening. She wasn't even 21 yet, but she had the poise
of an experienced woman."</TE>
<TE>   They had a child, then married in 1986 when O'Neal was 22 and
McEnroe was 27. From the beginning, according to both, their
relationship involved a lot of drinking and drug use that progressed
through their marriage. "It seemed that there was never enough calm
in the house," McEnroe writes. They divorced in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, O'Neal's heroin addiction in 1995 caused her to lose
custody of her three children. Two years later, McEnroe remarried
rocker Patty Smyth and had two children with her. He dedicated his
book to Smyth, "my soul mate."</TE>
<TE>   "Oftentimes, these divorces were not mutually decided upon,"
Ahrons said. "Oftentimes, there was infidelity ... economic issues
[and] these people keep having some relationship with each other
because of children.... They just never let go. They're 'angry
habituated.' "</TE>
<TE>   Susan Forward, author of "Obsessive Love" and "Men Who Hate Women
and the Women Who Love Them," said most people at some point in their
lives meet "that one magic person who sort of nests inside you and
you can't ever get rid of them emotionally."</TE>
<TE>   The opposite of love is not hate, said Forward, it's indifference.
"Attacking and blaming is still a passion and still indicates that
they haven't totally let go."</TE>
<TE>   For O'Neal, that "magic person" may be McEnroe. She told People
that she broke off her 2000 engagement to Miramax executive Steve
Hutensky to be closer to her father, Ryan O'Neal, after he was
diagnosed with cancer. "Steve's a great guy," she said. "... But I'm
still fighting this first marriage."</TE>

<HD>A Thai-Style Piece of the American Pie</HD>
<DH>Community Shop lets immigrants accomplish together what
they can't individually: own their own business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARIA ELENA FERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk of the future comes up a lot in this small, new Hollywood
Boulevard storefront that is not part of the Hollywood business boom
but offers a boost of a different kind. Here in Thai Town, where
elderly and young people work and live, and where recent immigrants
meditate on Friday nights and exercise together at the Western Avenue
Metro Rail Station on Saturday mornings, this new business heralds a
young community's triumphs.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-four women and one man collaborated on the creation of the
Thai Town Community Shop, a specialty gift cooperative that sells
original handcrafts, clothes, jewelry and silk fabrics crafted by the
owners themselves or imported from Thailand. An unlikely cast of
restaurant cooks, garment workers, single mothers and elderly retired
women created this enterprise, pooling their resources--$1,000
each--for a chance at jointly owning a business they could never
manage individually. They all take turns sitting in the colorful shop
waiting for customers while painting clay vases for handmade orchids
or sewing ornate clothing.</LD>
<TE>   So far, their products, which also include specialty foods, have
attracted locals as well as tourists from around the world. But the
2-month-old shop has also become a community center of sorts for
recent immigrants seeking advice in dealing with their new life. The
owners' longtime experience living in Los Angeles has made them want
to be helpful to newcomers. Upstairs, where rugs, lamps, candles and
shawls are displayed for sale, there is also a Buddhist altar for
group meditations or individual prayer that is always available.
Sometimes visitors come in just seeking emotional support, and they
find plenty of it here.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1960s, east Hollywood has been home to an estimated
80,000 Thai immigrants. Two years ago the city named six blocks of
Hollywood Boulevard, between Normandie and Western, the nation's
first Thai Town as a tribute to the area's cultural identity. To
these people, the Community Shop is a catalyst for economic
independence, but more important, it advances their dream to make the
area a mecca for those seeking traditional Thai culture.</TE>
<TE>   Penny Bhusiririt is a Thai interpreter who has lived in Los
Angeles since 1979; the shop, at 5228 Hollywood Blvd., has already
become more than her daily stop for rice. "It's important for
Americans to see our special crafts and that we are proud of our
products," she said. "I normally go to the Bangkok Market for my
food, but this helps the community, so I come in here. This place
brings the community together like no other business around here. We
have a Thai Town, so it makes sense to me that we have a shop like
this that sells products direct from Thailand and allows us to show
our culture to other people."</TE>
<TE>   Chutima Vucharatavintara, 49, came up with the idea for this
creative cooperative, and she sees the opening of the Thai Community
Shop as a step toward self-sufficiency of her people. For 14 years,
Vucharatavintara has been the glue of L.A.'s Thai community, taking
the sick and poor into her own home as if she were running a shelter.
Working at the Thai Community Development Center, Vucharatavintara
has helped thousands of Thai immigrants settle in Los Angeles. The
idea of bringing these strangers together for the co-op struck her
when she wondered who would help those who depend on her when she
retires and leaves Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to find a way to help them help themselves,"
Vucharatavintara said. "I won't retire for another six or seven
years, but I had to start now to find ways to help them do things
themselves. We want more people to join the cooperative so it can be
like a big family. That way, when people have problems, they know
they can always come here. These people didn't know each other, and
now they love each other like family."</TE>
<TE>   Prakorb Amornkul, who owned a pharmacy in Thailand before
immigrating to the U.S. 25 years ago, believes the cooperative offers
the only chance she would ever have of becoming an entrepreneur in
her adopted country.</TE>
<TE>   "I like that it's a group of us trying to do the same thing
because we all help each other," said the mother of four, who has
held a variety of service jobs in Los Angeles. "It's very tough
coming to this country and working so hard at all these jobs when you
were used to running your own business."</TE>
<TE>   Although she hasn't yet given up her full-time factory job making
purses, Saovaluk Thakhammi, 40, also welcomes the notion of being her
own boss. But truth be told, she derives more satisfaction from her
contribution to the store: bright pink, orange and yellow orchids,
crafted from Japanese and Thai clay, that resemble those grown in
northern Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud to make my flowers and that people have an opportunity
to see my skills," said Thakhammi, who has lived in Hollywood with
her son for seven years. "It's a great feeling owning your own
business, even if it's shared with a lot of people. But the best
feeling is seeing how people respond to my flowers and vases."
Vucharatavintara cannot help but smile as she listens to Thakhammi:
"Most of our merchandise you can't get anywhere else in this country
because it's custom-made in Thai style," she says, sounding like a
proud mother. "They're all originals. If you have it, you should feel
proud that you have it."</TE>
<TE>   Repeat customer Sriwan Sangwitayapan illustrates the point when
she sneaks in during a coffee break from her job as a cook to buy a
silver bracelet for her daughter. It is the fourth time she has come
into the shop for her silver fix. In northern Thailand, where she was
raised, women always wore a lot of silver jewelry, she says. "This is
typical Thai-style jewelry," she said. "I like buying it here because
I know it helps the community. But mostly, I just love silver."</TE>

<LD>Conjure a picture of a famous writer of years past, and chances are
that image would include a glass of inebriant--scotch, usually--close
at the writer's hand. So what could be more natural than a book
reading at a bar?</LD>
<LD>   At the Parlour Club in West Hollywood on Sunday night, listeners
perched on bar stools and sipped candy-colored martinis as local
author Lisa Teasley read from her new collection of short stories,
"Glow in the Dark."</LD>
<LD>   With the help of three actors, Teasley evoked a hangover-tinged
breakfast rife with cigarettes, cold eggs, profanity and gastric
upheaval, along with the violent episode that ensued. All accompanied
by the occasional clink of ice as the club's bartender mixed drinks.</LD>
<TE>   Bottles of Stolichnaya and Absolut glowed white against a mirror,
in dramatic contrast to the Parlour's relentlessly red color scheme.
The 20 or so in the mixed crowd--some painfully hip in thrift store
digs, some sporting prominent tattoos, others looking like they came
straight from the beach--listened and responded as intently as any
crowd at a Barnes &amp; Noble reading. "It's nice to combine literary
thought with alcohol and friends," said Deirdre Sexton, a junior high
English teacher who sat surrounded by friends and empty beer glasses
after the reading. The juxtaposition of alcohol, literature and good
company is standard fare for the Unhappy Hour, as Sunday nights at
the Parlour Club are billed.</TE>
<TE>   "These aren't exactly happy, light writers. The material is heavy,
intense.... Bars have happy hours. So it's a contradiction, being the
contrarians we are," explained Lydia Lunch, a spoken-word performer
and hostess of the Unhappy Hour.</TE>
<TE>   Martinis in hand, the crowd may actually have been a tad happier
than the average bookstore gathering. "It's a comfortable, salon-type
atmosphere. Bookstores are too sterile, the lighting is too bright.
This is free, and early in the evening. It's something comfortable to
slink into," Lunch said.</TE>
<TE>   For Teasley, having her written words acted out took her work to a
different level. "It's thrilling to hear the words ... to hear
someone else's interpretation is like another life for the story,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Performers at the Parlour since the Unhappy Hour began in January
have included Mary Woronov, cult actress, writer and member of Andy
Warhol's Factory set; goth writer Clint Catalyst, performance artist
Vaginal Davis and L.A. writer and punk musician Pleasant Gehman.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a nice refuge from the typical Hollywood posturing.
At other spoken-word events, people are more about getting noticed.
Here, it's not about flash but substance. It's edgy--authentically
edgy," said Thom Fowler, a writer and Unhappy Hour regular.</TE>
<TE>   Lunch and Andrew Gould, manager of Parlour Club, are putting the
shows on hold for the summer, when the late-evening sunshine beckons
people outdoors, but will resume the Unhappy Hour in September.</TE>
<TE>   "It's addictive. I look forward to Sunday nights. The hiatus is
going to put me in withdrawal," said Fowler's friend, Rachel Walker,
a costume designer who just moved to L.A. from Seattle.</TE>
