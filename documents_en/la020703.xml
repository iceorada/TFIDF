<DH>Nissan's new Z pays homage to its predecessors without
being a carbon copy</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Nissan killed the Z in 1996, there was relatively little
grieving. What had started life in 1969 as an affordable basic sports
car--the 240Z--had been morphed into a bloated and expensive
luxo-boat of a sports coupe, the 300ZX.</LD>
<LD>   With the average selling price of the 300ZX hovering around
$40,000, the traditional Z consumer--younger drivers in the middle of
their career climbs and saddled with new houses, new families and
other obligations that kept a lid on disposable incomes--could no
longer afford to buy one.</LD>
<LD>   But though the Z went away, Z fever never did. There are Z clubs
galore, and it seems that every other aging boomer you meet these
days either owned one or had a best friend who owned one and let him
or her drive it.</LD>
<TE>   That nostalgia, and the pent-up demand, bodes well for Nissan as
it prepares to unleash a new sports car, the 350Z.</TE>
<TE>   It is a Z that pays homage to but doesn't copy its predecessors, a
sports car that comes with plenty of power, striking looks and lots
of people space (luggage space is another matter) at a price that, by
today's standards, is downright affordable.</TE>
<TE>   It starts at $26,809 (including Nissan's $540 delivery charge) for
the five-speed manual base model and tops out at $34,619 for the
six-speed manual Track model with oversize Brembo disc brakes. The
only options are a navigation system for $1,999 and a side air bag
and side-curtain air-bag system for $569.</TE>
<TE>   All trim levels use the same 287-horsepower engine, and for those
who don't think 287 ponies is sufficient, Z product line planner John
Stramotas smiles and says that "there is a great life-cycle plan for
[constantly upgrading] this car."</TE>
<TE>   Nissan held the press introduction last month in the Santa Monica
Mountains. The fleet was limited to a few pre-production models that
had their share of pre-production faults--most noteworthy were a set
of auxiliary gauges that were difficult to read when hit by direct
sunlight and some flimsy plastic bits, including a hard-to-close
flip-up storage compartment cover on the dash. But the suspensions
and power trains were just fine, thank you.</TE>
<TE>   The 350Z, so named for the 3.5-liter V-6 it shares with other new
Nissans, including the Altima, the Maxima and the Infiniti G35, is
all a sports car should be.</TE>
<TE>   Maximum horsepower is reached at 6,200 rpm (redline is 6,600 rpm)
with 274 pounds-feet of torque at 4,800 rpm.</TE>
<TE>   Power is transmitted to the rear wheels through a lightweight
plastic drive shaft reinforced with carbon fiber.</TE>
<TE>   The six-speed manual transmission is a close-ratio model with a
shift pattern so short you can work from first through sixth almost
on wrist action alone; the automatic has a shift-it-yourself mode
programmed to stay in the gear you choose until you shift or hit the
rev limiter--no automatic upshifting.</TE>
<TE>   I drove base, track and touring models with manual and automatic
transmissions--and can say that in all versions, the new Z is a blast
to drive, a huge improvement over Zs that came before it and a worthy
competitor in the sports car segment. A Z roadster is coming in
February.</TE>
<TE>   Steering is tight, linear and almost too responsive, the
suspension--even in touring models--keeps you glued to the road and
lets you navigate curves at speeds you might not otherwise dare.
Suspension tuning lets you feel the road but isn't so bumpy you want
to pull over every few miles for relief.</TE>
<TE>   Torque kicks in early enough to make mountain driving, at speed or
simply cruising, a pleasure rather than a chore no matter which
transmission is in play.</TE>
<TE>   Seats, in textured black cloth, or charcoal, light gray or
burnt-orange leather are well-bolstered and comfortable while still
grippy enough to keep you in place on the twistiest hairpins.</TE>
<TE>   There's no glovebox in the dash--air bags take up that space--and
only one, awkwardly placed cup holder that slides out of the
passenger-side dash fascia about where a tall rider's knee is
guaranteed to snap it off.</TE>
<TE>   But there are two cup holders in a small center console tray, and
a pair of small covered cubbies in the panel that separates the
passenger compartment from the cargo area and holds most of the
stereo speakers. That same divider hides a locking compartment large
enough for most briefcases and purses.</TE>
<TE>   The cargo area is bisected by a rear strut stiffener that displays
the "Z" emblem through the rear hatch window. The stiffener is not
removable and limits the height of packages that can be loaded on
board. But there's enough room back there for luggage for two for a
weekend outing, or for a dozen standard paper bags filled with
groceries.</TE>
<TE>   As to the market: Nissan says it is relying not on demographics
but on "psychographics," as it believes this car will appeal to a
certain kind of driver across all age, ethnic and income groups.</TE>
<TE>   We tested the theory Friday by taking a pre-production model a few
places we figured might show how much interest exists.</TE>
<TE>   The Silverstone-colored Touring model emptied the place when we
pulled up in front of Motorsport Auto in Orange, a parts and
restoration palace for vintage Nissan Zs and ZXs and their owners. If
the new Z didn't measure up, we figured, who better to tell us than
experts in the old ones. Marketing director L.J. Mangune took a ride
and said that though he'd devoured all the specifications and
technical data, "nothing prepared me for the car in person. It is
awesome."</TE>
<TE>   We also took our Z to a nearby popular youth-oriented shopping and
entertainment mall, where the parking lot is jammed with hot Hondas,
muscular Mustangs and other fancies of freeway flight.</TE>
<TE>   We parked on the sidewalk at one of the main entrances and waited
for things to happen.</TE>
<TE>   Lunchtime crowds assembled, people looked and sat inside, and the
almost unanimous consensus was that the 2003 model 350Z is a
good-looking sports car that will sell well.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana-based tourism magazine publisher and former 280Z owner
Connie Hamilton said the new Z "is priced well" and will attract
those, like herself, who ever owned one in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the young woman who was barely out of her teens
when the last Z was made.</TE>
<TE>   "$27,000! That's ... cheap!" she exclaimed when her companion was
told where pricing started for the new Z.</TE>
<TE>   Her outburst drew laughs from the assembled crowd, but also a lot
of approving nods.</TE>

<LD>Hollywood cars--An article in last week's Highway 1 said the Aston
Martin DB5 was the car driven by Sean Connery "at the outset" of the

<LD>Nissan's 2003 model 350Z comes in seven trim levels, starting at
$26,809. Although there's quite a spread from there to the top of the
line, all versions use the same 287-horsepower engine and the same
lightweight suspension systems. So buyers with limited budgets don't
have to settle for less oomph. Here's a rundown of what you'd get for
your bucks:</LD>
<LD>   * The base model comes with five-speed, 17-inch wheels and tires,
cloth seats, air conditioning, power windows and an in-dash CD
player.</LD>
<LD>   * The next step up is the Enthusiast model ($28,789), a base model
with upgrades that include a six-speed manual, cruise control,
limited-slip differential, traction control and Xenon headlamps.
There also is an Enthusiast model with five-speed automatic
($29,759).</LD>
<TE>   * The Performance model is the mid-level Z ($30,969). It comes
with six-speed manual, 18-inch tires and alloy wheels, skid control
and tire pressure monitor in addition to the Enthusiast upgrades.</TE>
<TE>   * The Touring models--one with six speed ($33,719) and one with
five-speed automatic ($32,129)--add leather seating, power seat
adjusters, heated seats and mirrors and an upgraded seven-speaker
Bose stereo with six-disc in-dash CD changer. The Touring with
automatic omits the anti-skid system.</TE>
<TE>   * The top-of-the-line Track model ($34,619) is a street-legal Z
that loses the leather seats and Bose stereo but adds larger,
high-performance Brembo disc brakes; front and rear spoilers for
improved aerodynamics, and 18-inch aluminum racing wheels that are
8.8 pounds lighter than the 18-inch alloys (that's a total savings of
35.2 pounds of unsprung weight, which makes a lot of difference in
competitive situations).</TE>

<HD>Fuel-Cell Vehicles Are Advancing Toward First Real-World
Tests</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After almost a decade of hailing fuel-cell technology as the ultimate
replacement for the internal combustion engine, auto makers are
slowly starting to put some fuel-cell-powered vehicles on the
streets.</LD>
<LD>   Toyota Motor Corp. said Monday that it would produce 20 fuel-cell
powered versions of its Highlander sport utility this year to lease
to researchers, businesses and agencies that have an adequate supply
of the hydrogen needed to fuel the vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   Toyota wants to use the limited fleet to gather real-world driving
and performance data before it increases production of fuel-cell
Highlanders.</LD>
<TE>   For the same reason, Honda Motor Corp. plans to make a small but
undetermined number of fuel-cell vehicles available for testing next
year, said Ben Knight, vice president for automotive engineering.
"It's a great way to get feedback," he said.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler will place 30 fuel-cell buses in 10 European
cities, said Dirk Walliser, a co-director of the German-American auto
maker's fuel-cell project. "We find it is the furthest we can go into
commercialization right now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And Ford Motor Co. is sending five fuel-cell vehicles to
California this year for testing. Ford hasn't "achieved a
commercially viable design," but will have a limited number of
vehicles for fleets available in 2004, said Bruce Kopf, director of
Think Technologies at Ford.</TE>
<TE>   The auto industry is sticking to estimates that mass-produced
fuel-cell vehicles will not be possible until 2010 at the earliest,
mainly due to cost, infrastructure and safety issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly there are technical challenges, but there's been so
much public and private investment the public ought to expect these
vehicles within the decade," said Jason Mark, a transportation
analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists.</TE>
<TE>   Fuel cells use a chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen to
produce electric power. When pure hydrogen is used, the only tailpipe
emission is harmless water vapor.</TE>
<TE>   When hydrogen is extracted from gasoline or other fuel, harmful
emissions are reduced but not eliminated. However, to use fuels other
than pure hydrogen, vehicles must be equipped with a heavy and
expensive reformer that extracts hydrogen from those fuels.</TE>
<TE>   Hydrogen is a flammable gas that poses safety concerns, especially
in a crash. Several suppliers are working on strong but light
on-board storage systems. The lack of a network of hydrogen filling
stations presents another obstacle.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler expects to make more fuel-cell vehicles available
in the United States in 2004, mainly for fleet operations, Walliser
said. General Motors Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. said they planned to
make the vehicles available for fleet sales in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota already has made two hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles based on
its Highlander SUV available to the California Fuel Cell Partnership
for evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the federal government announced a partnership with
U.S. auto makers called Freedom CAR, with the goal of accelerating
the development of fuel-cell vehicles and a hydrogen fueling
infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Though the cost of fuel-cell vehicles has fallen since they were
first built in the late 1990s, they still are too expensive to sell
at a profit.</TE>
<TE>   With gasoline relatively cheap in the U.S., people are not
motivated to pay more for vehicles that run on something else. "Who
is going to invest in mass production without a market?" Ford's Kopf
asked.</TE>
<TE>   But Daniel Becker, the Sierra Club's director of global warming
and energy programs, said U.S. auto makers were dragging their feet
in bringing fuel-cell vehicles to market.</TE>
<TE>   History has shown the industry capable of doing many things it
first said it could not do, Becker said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the industry that said, 'We can't make vehicles with seat
belts, we can't make vehicles with air bags, we can't make vehicles
that get 35 miles a gallon.' "</TE>
<TE>   FutureTruck Winners</TE>
<TE>   A team from UC Davis captured third place overall and a spate of
specialty awards in the 2002 FutureTruck competition that ended late
last month. The contest is the second in a four-year program designed
to foster methods of making trucks, which account for slightly more
than half of all new passenger vehicles sold these days, more
fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly.</TE>
<TE>   The UC Davis team took first place in the competition last year,
when the goal was to modify a Chevrolet Suburban for improved fuel
economy and emissions while maintaining performance at or near stock
levels.</TE>
<TE>   This year's challenge was to do the same with a Ford Explorer. The
UC Davis entry was a "plug-in" hybrid electric version in which an
on-board battery and electric motors provided power during low-speed
city driving and on trips of up to 50 miles. A small, fuel-efficient
gasoline engine took over for extended highway driving. The batteries
were recharged at night using off-peak electricity, but in the
absence of a charging station the vehicle also could be driven using
only the gasoline engine.</TE>
<TE>   First place overall was captured by the University of Wisconsin at
Madison, and Michigan Technological University placed second.</TE>
<TE>   The Wisconsin team used a bio-diesel hybrid electric power system
and specially engineered weight-saving components such as an
aluminum-and-steel frame and a titanium exhaust system to improve the
stock Explorer's gas mileage by 45% while cutting greenhouse gas
emissions by 50%.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its third-place overall finish, the UC Davis team
won for best use of renewable fuels and for best use of advanced
technologies. The team's entry also was judged the most
consumer-acceptable of the 15 vehicles in the competition.</TE>

<HD>GTO Is Pontiac's Muscle Car Redux</HD>

<LD>The sinewy lines and "rocket-sled" performance General Motors Corp.
is claiming for its upcoming GTO muscle car are meant to put some
life back into a Pontiac division whose sales have stumbled 3.7% this
year.</LD>
<LD>   The GTO, scheduled to return to the U.S. market late next year
after a 29-year hiatus, will have a 5.7-liter V8 version of the
Chevrolet Corvette engine that is expected to pump out in the
neighborhood of 350 horsepower.</LD>
<LD>   Here's a first look at a sketch released recently by GM. The car,
to be priced at $30,000 to $35,000, will be a modified version of the
Monaro, built by GM's Australian subsidiary, Holden.</LD>
<TE>   In the spirit of muscle over practicality, GM will allow the GTO
to be subject to the gas-guzzler tax. It will be the first GM car
since the Cadillac Allante in 1994 to be slapped with the tariff,
levied on passenger cars with a combined city and highway fuel rating
of less than 22.5 miles per gallon.</TE>
<TE>   "For a car to be credible, accepted as a rebirth of the rear-drive
American muscle car, it has got to have that rocket-sled
acceleration," GM product development guru Robert A. Lutz was quoted
by the industry publication Automotive News as saying last month in
Germany.</TE>

<HD>Salvage Industry Due for Overhaul by State</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH VARTABEDIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Missing air bags. Crooked frames. The front half of one car welded to
the back of another. Fire-gutted vehicles superficially patched.</LD>
<LD>   These are some of the documented practices of the salvage auto
industry, which takes 145,000 "totaled" vehicles in California every
year and puts them back on the highway. One out of every seven
vehicles in the state was salvaged from a wrecking lot, according to
the Department of Motor Vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   It is a business with a terrible reputation, accused in testimony
at a recent state Senate Insurance Committee hearing of selling
unsafe and unreliable cars and trucks to motorists who have no idea
they are getting former wrecks. Under two bills pending in the
Legislature, the industry would face new regulation, though not as
strict as many consumer advocates would prefer.</LD>
<TE>   California currently mandates that salvaged vehicles be branded as
such on their titles. But repair shops sometimes violate the law.</TE>
<TE>   That's not the business Arlie Teasley has been in for the last 20
years. Teasley is a repair specialist in San Diego who buys and
restores totaled vehicles and sells them directly to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a few salvage shops that give an honest deal," said
Teasley, who specializes in a single model, the Buick LeSabre. "In
the old days, there were 25 restorers in San Diego, but now there are
hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   "You get a lot of shops that are fronts for operations in Mexico.
A lot of these guys don't tell anybody what they do. They register
cars to private parties. The business gets a bad name on things like
that."</TE>
<TE>   It may seem astonishing that anybody would knowingly buy a
fixed-up wreck that comes with a title branding it a salvaged
vehicle. It means the vehicle will have a permanently diminished
value and repairs that might always be called into question.</TE>
<TE>   But salvaged cars and trucks sell at hefty discounts, meaning they
appeal to many drivers with low or fixed incomes. With luck, the
vehicles provide reliable and inexpensive transportation. (Teasley's
cars come with full disclosure, and he provides a one-year
unconditional warranty on the entire vehicle.)</TE>
<TE>   An economic and regulatory squeeze in the industry is hurting
honest restorers, Teasley said.</TE>
<TE>   Repair shops once could pick up low-cost salvaged vehicles
directly from insurers and restore them properly. But the business
has been taken over by large interstate auction houses, which sell
wrecks to the highest bidder and add fees that boost the cost.</TE>
<TE>   The system plays to the low-end restoration shops that cut corners
and sell vehicles through networks that make it difficult to trace
who fixed them.</TE>
<TE>   In January, a state Senate Insurance Committee hearing, chaired by
Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough), uncovered an array of tawdry and
illegal practices.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles resident Stephen Cody told of buying a BMW for $29,500
and later learning it had been resurrected from a Nevada junkyard,
where it had ended up after it was gutted by fire.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Wray of San Francisco testified that she bought a $43,000
Mercedes-Benz but wasn't told that it consisted of two cars welded
together.</TE>
<TE>   California Highway Patrol Cmdr. Adam Cuevas documented missing air
bags from salvaged vehicles. In one case, he reported, a passenger in
a vehicle with a missing air bag died in a front-end collision.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the state Bureau of Automotive Repair reported that 43%
of collision-damaged vehicles the agency inspected under a special
program had fraudulent billing from shops that repaired them.</TE>
<TE>   Teasley understands the legislative push to get cars and trucks
properly branded as salvaged when an insurance company deems them
totaled, but he believes such consumer protection can be superficial.</TE>
<TE>   "A salvage title means absolutely nothing," he said. "I can get a
car with a clean title that is damaged just as bad as one with a
salvage title. You can get a car with no damage that has a salvage
title."</TE>
<TE>   That's because insurance adjusters deem vehicles totaled based not
on whether they can be safely fixed but on what is economically
expedient. An older vehicle with minor damage is quickly labeled
totaled, whereas a new one with extensive damage might not be.</TE>
<TE>   Teasley says limiting himself to the LeSabre allows him to gain
expertise. He also is a big fan of the model.</TE>
<TE>   "The LeSabre gets fantastic mileage," he said, pointing to its
federal fuel-economy rating of 20 miles per gallon in the city and 30
on the highway. "If you look at crash ratings, they are top-rated.
They have heavier reinforcement in the doors. They are built better
in the front end. You can get six people in a LeSabre."</TE>
<TE>   Teasley looks for late-model wrecks with low mileage to restore. A
1998 LeSabre he recently restored had only 11,000 miles on the
odometer, for example.</TE>
<TE>   But after 20 years, he is thinking of getting out of the business.
He used to fix and sell as many as 120 cars a year, but these days he
is down to about 25. Competition from low-end shops, he said,
combined with the higher prices on wrecks from salvage auction pools,
is making it tough to do business.</TE>
<TE>   Business probably will get tougher. Legislation sponsored by
Speier would require salvage auction pools to obtain state licenses
and salvage vehicle restorers such as Teasley to obtain inspections
to verify that air bags are operable and that vehicle ID numbers are
legitimate. But the bills would not license rebuilders and would not
require broad safety inspections of vehicles, as many consumer
advocates had hoped.</TE>

<HD>College as Kids' Stuff</HD>
<DH>A bill would let state's young and gifted skip high school
for 4-year institutions</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine life for Levi Clancy. He's 11 and still can't get into a
four-year college. Not because he lacks the brains. Levi has an IQ of
150--a genius scores at 140--and takes courses at Santa Monica
College, a two-year community college. He has more than enough
credits to graduate to attend a four-year college but is not old
enough (one must be 16) to take the high school proficiency test.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is that higher education is not set up for preteen
students. An 11-year-old student at a four-year college or university
stretches the state's official imagination.</LD>
<LD>   At least, it has until now. A new bill making its way through the
Legislature would allow California's brightest kids to skip high
school and go straight to college if they pass a high school
proficiency test and show an IQ of at least 150. Even qualifying
kindergarteners could make the leap.</LD>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Lynne Leach (R-Walnut Creek), author of the bill,
estimates that several thousand preteens in California would qualify
to do college-level work. She decided to sponsor their cause after
Levi's mother, Leila Levi, trekked from her Venice home to Sacramento
and made a personal plea to Leach on behalf of her bright young son.
Leila Levi, a former high school teacher and a single mother, has
watched her child suffer for being trapped at lower academic levels
when he's ready for lofty pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   "Children are discriminated against because of their age," says
Leila Levi, who receives daily e-mails and letters from the
commiserating parents of exceptionally bright children. "I've helped
around 300 kids age 8 to 16 get into college courses," she says.</TE>
<TE>   She quit her teaching job several years ago to tutor her son and
knock down obstacles in his academic path. Levi Clancy had reached
the top of Eagle Rock Highly Gifted Magnet school, whose principal
wrote a letter to Santa Monica College administrators encouraging
them to accept the brainy student. "They resisted, but I was
persistent," says his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Levi has taken a full course load for the last few semesters and
is in a chemistry class this summer. He is waiting to grow up so he
can get on with his education. "Nobody will take him in a four-year
college," says his mother. "He is too young.</TE>
<TE>   Leach estimates that there are 40,000 "gifted and talented"
students like Levi in California's elementary schools and that about
4,000 of them would skip high school and go straight to college if
they had the choice.</TE>
<TE>   Her bill, which cleared the Assembly, would not force colleges to
accept younger students. It would only require them to judge young
applicants on an equal basis with more typical high school graduates,
not simply dismiss them as too young as they can do now. "At least
the schools could no longer say, 'Absolutely not, ' just because of a
student's age," Leach explains.</TE>
<TE>   Educators agree that overachievers need special treatment. But
college-bound preteens are another matter. "If the bill passes, we'll
have a problem," says Linda Michalowski, vice chancellor of
governmental relations and external affairs for California's 108
community colleges. There are safety and liability issues. "We don't
have anything in place to protect minors," she says.</TE>
<TE>   There are other problems too, she says. Priorities at community
colleges revolve around the bulk of students, who are ready to enter
the job market the minute they graduate from college. Community
colleges would be the first to be affected if Leach's bill becomes
law. They are required to admit any California resident who holds a
high school diploma or equivalency certificate.</TE>
<TE>   Levi Clancy is the youngest student at Santa Monica College but
not the only preteen. There are three 12-year-olds and more than
1,200 of the school's 30,000 students are between the ages of 13 and
16. A bulk of them are high school students who are part of a
dual-enrollment program, which allows them to take some college-level
classes.</TE>
<TE>   Some educators say the Leach bill puts too much emphasis on
academic achievements. "It's almost science fiction," says John
Braman, president of the Independent School Assn. of the Central
States, an accreditation agency. He has developed leadership programs
for elementary and high school students that emphasize the whole
person.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as if you can bypass social and emotional development and
treat a child as if he is only a brain," says Braman, who was on the
faculty of Polytechnic School in Pasadena before he moved to Chicago
last year. "You're a fourth-grader and you've finished college. Now
what do you do?"</TE>
<TE>   Leach has heard that argument. "Some people say young students on
college campuses would be socially challenged," she says. "I say
they'll be with their intellectual equals who are more emotionally
mature and understanding." One of the bill's supporters is Donald
Gerth, president of Cal State Sacramento, who started college at age
16.</TE>
<TE>   Levi Clancy says he used to get beaten up in elementary school for
being different. "I feel more normal than I have anywhere else," he
says of life at Santa Monica College. "I'm with my academic peers.
They're so nice to me."</TE>
<TE>   His next goal is to get accepted at UCLA, but that will take some
time. A faculty advisor there told him to finish every math class
offered at Santa Monica College and call back when he turns 13.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his uncertain academic future, Levi has already settled on
a career goal. "I want to major in medical research and be a
biological medical engineer," he says. That would prepare him to find
a cure for cancer on a molecular level, he says.</TE>
<TE>   The state Senate Education Committee will take up the bill after
it returns from summer break. Before the recess, Sen. John
Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), chairman of the committee, said, "We
have to be clear about what is appropriate for a young kid, and we
have to attend to the security questions. There is sympathy for the
bill, but you can't just let a 12-year-old loose on a college
campus."</TE>

<HD>Rocio, 8, Just Wants to Be Part of Crowd</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KWALA MANDEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No matter how hot it is outside, 8-year-old Rocio Lara always wears
long-sleeved sweaters. "She has these sweaters that zip up the front
and cover her all the way up," said Beatriz Garcia, site coordinator
at the Maravilla 4-H Program in East L.A., where Rocio stays every
day. "She is very self-conscious about the scar on her chest."</LD>
<LD>   "It is kind of ugly, it is kind of big--if I wear spaghetti strap
shirts, you can see it," Rocio said in a soft voice. "Sometimes, to
make a friend is kind of hard. When I wear shirts, they see my scar
and say, 'What happened?' "</LD>
<LD>   The fourth-grader had double-bypass surgery last year because of
holes in two arteries. When she was diagnosed in Mexico, her parents
packed up their four children and moved to the United States to get
better medical care for Rocio. Because money was tight, they stayed
in the Maravilla public housing with their extended family--12 people
(four adults, eight children) share a three-bedroom apartment. Her
mother took a job packaging goods in Chinatown; her father is a
long-distance trucker who can't always be with the family.</LD>
<TE>   Although Rocio is recovering well from the surgery, the entire
family is called on to protect the child from overexertion. "If she
is jumping rope, her cousins will stop her and say, 'You've already
jumped too much," said Garcia. Her 10-year-old cousin, Darlene
Rodriguez, said she tries to protect Rocio by "telling her not to run
that much because probably she might have a heart attack or
something."</TE>
<TE>   "Her parents have said, 'Please don't push her physically' because
they are afraid her heart will work too hard. But she gets really
frustrated because she wants to participate," said Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Nathaniel, the 4-H program director, is hoping that a
six-day stay at Camp Seeley, in the San Bernardino mountains, will
give Rocio a chance to "regain a sense of how to adjust to her life."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the Los Angeles Times summer camp campaign, she will
have a chance to participate in everything from fishing to hiking,
but what she is most excited about is swimming--so much so that, even
though she is self-conscious about her scar, she wants her mom to buy
her a blue-and-pink two-piece bathing suit that she picked out.</TE>
<TE>   This would be a big step, Garcia said. "It will give her the
chance to be outside of the boundaries they are setting for her."</TE>
<TE>   Participating with the other campers may also soften Rocio's
vision of herself as an outsider. "She doesn't perceive herself to be
like other children, even though she is. She won't raise her hand,
and if I call on her, she knows the right answer but is afraid to
speak out," said Garcia. "Going to camp could really empower her."</TE>
<TE>   Every year since 1954, readers and employees of The Times have
sent thousands of needy children to summer camp. This year more than
11,000 children will experience a special summer thanks to the $1.6
million raised last year.</TE>
<TE>   The average cost of sending a child to camp for a week is $150.
This year, the McCormick Tribune Foundation will match the first $1.2
million in contributions at 50 cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Checks should be sent to: L.A. Times Summer Camp Campaign, File
No. 56984, Los Angeles, CA 90074-6984. For more information, call

<TE>   "How'd you hurt your toe?" someone asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Basketball," I say. "Kid pushed me into the flower bed."</TE>
<TE>   "Sounds like a foul," the guy says.</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely," I say.</TE>
<TE>   We trudge down the path, hearing whitewater in the distance. We
round a bend only to find another bend. Six dads more accustomed to
leather office chairs and golf carts.</TE>
<TE>   Our sons, meanwhile, glide easily down the trail. Like mimes, they
walk funny on purpose. The last hundred yards, one of them actually
runs.</TE>
<TE>   "That's so disgusting," one of the dads says.</TE>
<TE>   It's a three-day raft trip, and we've started it well, the fathers
sweating off 5 pounds each while hiking to our launch point. At the
river's edge, we mill around as if looking for a sofa.</TE>
<TE>   "Can't wait for the rapids," one of them says, then plops down on
a log.</TE>
<TE>   And what rapids these are. The Forks of the Kern is considered one
of the finer river runs anywhere, because the rapids line up one
after another, white as your mother's wedding dress.</TE>
<TE>   Beneath the whitewater? Granite boulders, large and larger. Wedge
your foot beneath one of these monsters and the Kern River will slam
you to its floor. You'll come up for air maybe never.</TE>
<TE>   Conk your head. Fracture a collarbone. Burst an aorta. No 911
here. It's just you and God and a $4 plastic paddle.</TE>
<TE>   "You're in the wilderness, a long way from help," a guide warns.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they tell me," I mutter, looking at my Scooby-Doo Band-Aid.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, let's get into the rafts," the guide says.</TE>
<TE>   In our raft, there's the boy and me, plus a lawyer named Rocky and
his son, Nick.</TE>
<TE>   I am hoping for the minister, but instead I get a guy named Rocky,
down a lethal stretch of whitewater. Irony: I wear it like a shroud.</TE>
<TE>   "Did I mention I'm going to law school?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "If you survive," Rocky says.</TE>
<TE>   And off we go on our trip. Six boats, six guides and our tender
platoon of fathers and sons.</TE>
<TE>   The guides are the sort of men we thought we'd all grow up to be.
Tough as two-by-fours. Good with knots and snake bites. Bar maids,
too, probably.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer, they guide raft trips. In the winter, they work the
ski runs of Tahoe or Mammoth.</TE>
<TE>   "I live like a millionaire," one of them says. "I just have no
money."</TE>
<TE>   For three days we all live like millionaires. The best whitewater
rafting is as exhilarating as deep-sea fishing but far more
dangerous--exhausting and refreshing all at once.</TE>
<TE>   "Next up, Needlerock Falls," our guide says. "OK, boys, put your
game faces on."</TE>
<TE>   Class IV and V rapids, almost all. Basically, the rating system
works like this: If it thrashes like a Maytag, it's a Class IV. If it
thrashes like a Maytag that could kill you, it's a Class V. Simple,
really.</TE>
<TE>   "Once, an oar boat went off this one and folded in two," one of
the guides explains about Vortex, a Class V rapid with a 10-foot
plunge. "It never came up."</TE>
<TE>   We paddle hard through even the most dangerous stretches, the
torque of the oars holding us tight to the river.</TE>
<TE>   It seems the most counterintuitive thing, reaching out of the raft
with a paddle as the boat ricochets between rocks and hissing rapids.
Takes a half-day just to get used to it.</TE>
<TE>   "Keep paddling!" our guide orders over and over. "Dig!"</TE>
<TE>   At night, we camp along the river. The dads slurp foamy beer and
rub their tired arms while the boys fish for rainbow trout. The
guides cook. A full moon peeks up over the granite canyon wall,
watching.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what the dads talk about: EBay. Interest rates. Bush's
chances for a second term. America's corporate creeps.</TE>
<TE>   As the river roars past, we talk about California's water wars.
"Chinatown" and the great book "Cadillac Desert."</TE>
<TE>   We talk about ski boats and Little League controversies and how
parents ruin youth sports.</TE>
<TE>   We talk about "Caddyshack" and "Animal House" and the demise of
drive-in theaters. Classic television, too.</TE>
<TE>   "The Golden Age of TV?" says Bill. "The Beverly Hillbillies?"</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a theory on that," Rocky says.</TE>
<TE>   "Huh?"</TE>
<TE>   "The Beverly Hillbillies represented America's transformation from
an agrarian economy to an urban one," explains Rocky</TE>
<TE>   "It did?"</TE>
<TE>   "Jed Clampett was the Jeffersonian ideal of the yeoman farmer," he
says. "Elly May was Diana the Huntress."</TE>
<TE>   "I caught a fish!" yells the boy.</TE>
<TE>   "You did?"</TE>
<TE>   The sounds of a bunch of guys out in the wilderness, 50 miles from
the nearest freeway. The campfire sizzles. One dad belches. Another
does something even less eloquent.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Blazing Saddles,' now that was a great movie," someone notes.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty guys, finally away from the false comforts of modern life.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty guys out in the woods, living like millionaires.</TE>
<TE>   Next week: How to run a waterfall.</TE>

<HD>A Fight Is Brewing</HD>
<DH>Effort to make 'politically correct' coffee Berkeley's only
choice has caused quite a stir</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAWN HUBLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>This is a city of strong convictions and stronger latte. Here in the
cradle of the gourmet coffee movement, few things are dearer than the
People's caffeine. Berkeley is said to have one of the nation's
largest concentrations of coffeehouses. The underground comic hero
"Too Much Coffee Man" was created by a graduate of UC Berkeley. The
founders of Starbucks learned their trade at the locally based Peet's
Coffee &amp; Tea.</LD>
<LD>   So Rick Young expected some buzz when he strolled into the city
clerk's office with a citizen's initiative restricting the sale of
coffee to brew that is organic, fair-trade and/or shade-grown. He
just didn't think the jolt would be felt nationally.</LD>
<LD>   "Man, people are e-mailing me from all over the country," said
Young, 36, a rookie lawyer, environmentalist and sometime gadfly who
graduated a year ago from UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law.</LD>
<TE>   "I've been on CNN and MSNBC and Fox. Somebody ran the address of
my Web site (www.geo cities.com/coffeelawinfo/), and now I'm getting
this outrageous hate mail--'You're a fascist, get a job, thank God we
don't live in your freaky city with its politically correct coffee.'
I'm like, 'You live in Kansas! What do you care?' "</TE>
<TE>   The initiative, which has qualified for the November ballot, would
make Berkeley the first municipality in the nation to outlaw coffee
that isn't grown with guaranteed protections for workers and the
environment. Coffeehouse owners caught selling "the bad coffee," as
Young calls it, could face a fine and up to six months in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have denounced the idea as unenforceable, overbearing and
silly. ("Rick Young has got to be kidding," one Berkeleyite wrote in
a letter to the local paper. "Why, on this Earth should I rely upon a
law to tell me how and where to purchase my coffee?") Supporters
compare it to bans--now taken for granted--on unleaded gas and
Styrofoam coffee cups.</TE>
<TE>   The fair-trade coffee movement, which started in Europe as a
response to falling prices in the world coffee market, has only
recently developed traction in the United States. Its proponents
guarantee a minimum coffee price--and thus a living wage--to small
Third World farmers who operate out of democratically organized
cooperatives and submit to annual monitoring. Shade-grown coffee,
meanwhile, is grown in a manner that protects rain-forest canopies
that are habitat for migratory songbirds. Organic coffee is grown
without pesticides.</TE>
<TE>   These so-called sustainable beans and brews make up only a very
small slice of the $18-billion U.S. coffee market but have been
vigorously promoted by activists. They are now stocked at such
outlets as Trader Joe's, Borders Books, most gourmet coffee
retailers, and some more mainstream vendors, such as Safeway markets
and Hyatt hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Fair-trade, shade-grown and organic labels are "like a Good
Housekeeping seal of approval," said Jason Marks, spokesman for
Global Exchange, a San Francisco-based human rights organization that
waged a successful campaign two years ago to persuade Starbucks to
stock and sell fair-trade coffee beans.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a quantifiable standard, and for these farmers, it's the
difference between utter destitution and keeping their kids in
school, say, or having a cement floor in their houses." For months,
he said, the market price for coffee has been depressed, hovering at
around 50 cents per pound. Fair-trade certification more than doubles
that price--but only if the farmer can be matched with a buyer. (The
retail price for fair-trade coffee is comparable to the price for
other high-end coffee--around $11 a pound.)</TE>
<TE>   "The really sad thing right now is that there are far more farmers
who are fair-trade certified than are benefiting from the system
because we've only been pushing it for around three years," Marks
said. "Fair-trade coffee is available now in about 7,000 retail
outlets around the country, and 2,000 of them are Starbucks. So the
great thing about this initiative is that it's a step toward filling
the demand."</TE>
<TE>   Choking on</TE>
<TE>   Social Responsibility</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the initiative, however, complain that it forces social
responsibility down the throats of consumers and merchants. ("A Great
City's People Forced to Stop Drinking Swill?" read a recent headline
in the San Francisco Chronicle, a witty but pointed homage to its
famous headline on an investigative probe that found the coffee in
that "great city" to be subpar.)</TE>
<TE>   The city of Berkeley already has an ordinance, passed three years
ago, limiting city departmental purchasing to fair-trade,
shade-grown, organic coffee. But Mayor Shirley Dean, who authored
that law, says Young's broader initiative would require battalions of
inspectors to patrol the cafes. Moreover, she says, Berkeley's
customer base is so sensitive to social and environmental issues that
most of the city's coffeehouses already have to offer at least one
kind of fair-trade coffee as an option, just to satisfy consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm hearing from constituents is, 'Hey, this is wonderful
and environmentally and socially responsible, but don't take our
choice from us,' " said the mayor. "It's one thing to put fair trade
into the vendor bids for our city-operated camps and senior centers,
but this is a huge, different step."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, coffeehouse owners say, the initiative could enrich one
set of poor coffee farmers at the expense of another, limit choice
and lower quality.</TE>
<TE>   "The espresso I sell isn't fair trade--it's expensive, high-end
coffee that doesn't need to be fair trade because its farmers already
get a lot of money for it," said Daryl Ross, who owns four Berkeley
coffeehouses, including the highly regarded Caffe Strada and the
Boalt Hall coffee shop. "So why should I have to discontinue this
great coffee on which I built my business and stock a lower-end
coffee that's the same price but not as good quality? Especially when
I already offer a fair-trade option for all my non-espresso drinks?"</TE>
<TE>   Young--a bachelor who, before he entered law school, traveled the
world as an English teacher, bike tour leader and ski
instructor--says the ordinance is necessary because, until fair-trade
coffee becomes a mandate, too many consumers will forget to ask for
it. For exploitation to end, he says, social responsibility has to
happen en masse, something which he believes cannot happen solely
through good intentions.</TE>
<TE>   If They Can't Buy It,</TE>
<TE>   They Won't Drink It</TE>
<TE>   "People want to do the right thing, but to do it every single time
is like being on a diet or something. If you can't buy the bad
coffee, it's like padlocking your refrigerator," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This conclusion was cemented, he says, in his second year at Boalt
Hall, when, as a co-chairman of the school's environmental law club,
he noticed a lack of fair-trade offerings at the law school coffee
shop. Young says he went to Ross, the owner, and demanded that he
offer more fair-trade coffee; Ross says that Young wanted him to
exclusively offer fair-trade coffee.</TE>
<TE>   The conversation ended with Young threatening to boycott the shop
and pass out free coffee to his fellow, and famously
caffeine-dependent, law students. Ross says the boycott failed to
gain backers; Young says it was cut short because, on the morning the
free coffee was to be distributed, Ross put out a pot of fair-trade
brew.</TE>
<TE>   Young ended up using the experience in a class paper exploring the
legality of a ban on non-fair-trade coffee, which he has given to the
city in support of his initiative. He wrote it, he added, in the
midst of yet another political battle--a one-man, three-week sit-in
to halt construction of a university parking structure. (That
protest, which ended with Young and some demonstrators taking
sledgehammers to a 1979 Datsun, had no impact, except for Young
getting arrested.)</TE>
<TE>   "Compared with that," he said, lounging in the $325-a-month room
he has lived in since law school, "this coffee thing is way more
mainstream. I went from breaking law to making law."</TE>
<TE>   Ross, the coffeehouse owner, says Young's coffee initiative is
merely an effort to "to fill out his activist resume" and burnish his
Berkeley credentials. Young says he began gathering signatures only
after failing to enlist several members of the Berkeley City Council
in his cause. When they told him they didn't think it had sufficient
votes on the council, he says, he began passing petitions. The
initiative, which qualified for the November ballot with about 300
signatures more than the 2,044 needed, will be forwarded to the City
Council on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Under Berkeley's charter, the council can enact it directly or
refer it for a public vote in November. A study of its fiscal impact
and legality is underway by city analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not doing this for attention," Young said. "I'm doing this
because I drink a lot of coffee and I don't want to exploit anyone
while I'm drinking. Also, it's a good thing."</TE>

<DH>Relationships* A psychologist looks for a woman with whom
to create love as part of an experiment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUISE ROUG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a recent Monday night, 48-year-old Robert Epstein waited outside
the cliff-side restaurant Las Brisas in Laguna Beach, clutching a
single peach-colored rose.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm about to embark on a very bold, very personal experiment, one
that some might call--and in fact have already called--crazy,"
Epstein, the editor in chief of Psychology Today, wrote in a June
editorial-cum-personal ad. He was looking for a woman to fall in love
with him in a given amount of time, say within six months. He and the
woman would "create" love through weekly counseling sessions and a
series of trust-building exercises.</LD>
<LD>   During this period of self-experimentation, he would take copious
notes and chronicle everything for a book. He already had the title:
"The Love You Make: How We Learned to Love Each Other, and How You
Can Too."</LD>
<TE>   All he needed was a woman.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds had offered to be part of the experiment, pitching
themselves in long, heartfelt letters. And the phones had been
ringing off the hook. USA Today, the Boston Globe, the Washington
Post, the British newspaper the Guardian and the BBC were interested
in his project, he said. Producers from CBS and NBC were even
throwing around the idea of a so-called reality series, starring
Epstein. Camera crews would record "the milestones," he said. "The
first meeting, the first kiss, meeting the parents, the first
declaration of love, the counseling sessions."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's candidate was Alma Avery Rubenstein, the 33-year-old
owner of Kooky Catering. She was not drawn from the Psychology Today
responses. Rather, Epstein had found her on Matchmaker.com.</TE>
<TE>   "She sounds like an ambitious woman. I liked that," he said. "I
saw a couple of photos, and she looks kind of cute. She's Jewish ...
that's a good bonus."</TE>
<TE>   Though Rubenstein had inadvertently wandered into the middle of
the Epstein juggernaut, she agreed to a date at Las Brisas, halfway
between her Hollywood condo and his home in San Diego. And she didn't
flinch when he mentioned he'd be inviting a reporter along.</TE>
<TE>   He was being interviewed when a call came through on the other
line. "Guess who that was? Tonight's woman," he said as he came back
on the line. She had wanted directions to the restaurant, he said.
"She sounded a little irritated that I couldn't give her directions
straightaway. That's a bad sign."</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't distract him too much as he continued to chat about
his project and his new agent from N.S. Bienstock. "They represent
Diane Sawyer and Dan Rather," he said before taking another call.
Every national talk show has called, he said when he returned. "But
I've been forbidden by my agent to do them. It would ruin the
negotiations for the reality show. Which is a shame. I really wanted
to do CNN. They wanted to pick me up in a limo. Paula Zahn. I really
wanted to do that."</TE>
<TE>   He got another call. "I hope it's not her again."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't, he said. It has just been so frantic. Even John Gray
had contacted him. "The Mars/Venus guy. The John Gray."</TE>
<TE>   Epstein, a Harvard-trained psychologist, got back to the business
of relationships, explaining their typical trajectory. "What we
normally do is we fall passionately in love or in lust in the
beginning. But it fades and we're left with nothing."</TE>
<TE>   By dispensing with the idea of finding "the one" or a soul mate,
Epstein argued, partners-to-be could use tools culled from couples'
therapy to ignite, rather than simply rekindle, romances. They'd use,
for example, the exercise in which a person falls back into the arms
of his or her partner. Epstein has named it "falling for you."</TE>
<TE>   He was confident that his method, which he likened to an arranged
marriage in which partners consciously decide to fall in love, would
work "not for everybody--who cares?--but for many." He envisions
teaching his techniques to other therapists. It could be a franchise,
healing people on a national scale.</TE>
<TE>   "This is good for the consumer, the general public, it's even good
for the mental health profession," he said. "This project is going to
give rise to a lot of therapists and counselors. I guess you could
say it could bring in a lot of new customers."</TE>
<TE>   Idea Proves Familiar</TE>
<TE>   At the restaurant, a waiter seated the couple at a window table
with a view of the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Epstein, a slight man with thinning brown hair, was wearing
khakis, Topsiders and a blue blazer. A heavy silver chain hung around
his wrist. Rubenstein, a woman with a husky voice and caramel-golden
hair, wore a black top and skirt.</TE>
<TE>   He was a little tired after a hard day's work. She had arrived in
Laguna Beach two hours early. As Epstein unspooled his spiel,
Rubenstein looked puzzled. No, she hadn't read his editorial. As he
explained his quest, though, she quickly recovered.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I wrote a screenplay about the same thing," she said,
"trying to get someone to fall in love with you ... in one week, kind
of a crash course in love." She had never sold it because life
interfered. "I actually fell in love and got distracted," she said,
with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't steal your idea," he said. She ordered a dirty vodka
martini. He, Frangelico and Baileys on ice. She chided him for
"drinking his dessert." "I'm going to have to change that," she said.
They ordered entrees to share, and Epstein continued talking. In a
rare digression from the vertical pronoun, he told his date: "You're
my favorite body type."</TE>
<TE>   Outside, couples held hands as they walked along the bluff. The
lights dimmed.</TE>
<TE>   Epstein was looking for "a good, healthy, wonderful relationship."
And to that end, had crafted the love contract, "a beautiful
document. I'm going to be signing one, hopefully, this week."</TE>
<TE>   At the table, he presented it to Rubenstein. It had little
heart-shaped bullet points, and a dotted line to be signed by the
"partners in love." The goals, he had explained earlier, were "learn
to communicate, learn to have fun, learn to trust each other, learn
to forgive each other. Most important, learn to love each other with
a love that's genuine."</TE>
<TE>   Rubenstein looked at the document, spattered now with drops of
water from her glass.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking for a life partner, not a business contract," she
said. But soon they were talking business. She asked him about his
book deal, the money he would be making off the project. What would
be her cut, if she signed on to become his partner?</TE>
<TE>   "All that has to be worked out," he said. "Whether the person
would officially be a co-au- thor...."</TE>
<TE>   She mulled it over. She would really like to write something for
the book, she said.</TE>
<TE>   His pager beeped. "I'm a little intimidated by you," he told her.
"It may be your tan."</TE>
<TE>   They talked about his previous relationships; an ex-wife and
another woman. He showed her a picture of one of his four children.</TE>
<TE>   "I never really had a partner," he told her. But using the tools
he's developed--concentrating on conversational skills, identifying
mutual goals and overcoming barriers--that would change.</TE>
<TE>   She told him about a stint in the Israeli army. He didn't ask a
single question, segueing, instead, into an anecdote about his
dentist.</TE>
<TE>   After about an hour of Epstein on Epstein, the subject shifted to
Rubenstein.</TE>
<TE>   "So, are you working on anything right now?" he asked. "Yeah," she
replied, "the Robert Epstein story. The MTV reality series."</TE>
<TE>   That was his cue to talk more about the publicity frenzy. "My
mother's worst fear is that they are going to dig up my exes."</TE>
<TE>   " After dinner, they walked along the beach--no, a reporter
wouldn't be welcome. He walked her to her car and, they both said
later, they kissed.</TE>
<TE>   Nice but Awkward</TE>
<TE>   "I think he wanted to kiss more, and I got into my car,"
Rubenstein said by phone the next day. "It was nice but a little bit
awkward."</TE>
<TE>   She wasn't too daunted by the glass-house romance. "I honestly
felt we enjoyed each other's company," she said. "I think he's a
little overwhelmed by this project, and that's why I was giving him
space ... trying to be respectful."</TE>
<TE>   And this had the promise of something genuine, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I stopped picking the actors and the models, there were just so
many blank beautiful people," she said. "I want someone who's real."</TE>
<TE>   A week later, she hadn't heard from Epstein. He'd been busy.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it went pretty well," he said by phone. "I do want to
chat with her again." But what about his obligations to all the other
candidates? "What to do with these large numbers of women?" he asked,
outlining two possible methodologies for choosing among them: "Take
the first person who turns up or ... try to find the most suited?"</TE>
<TE>   What's love got to do with this? Some of Epstein's colleagues
weren't sure. "First of all, the motive behind it: He's not looking
for love," said Herb Goldberg, a Los Angeles clinical psychologist
and expert on male psychology. "It's about publicity, adventure,
getting attention. None of it has to do with finding love."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg continued: "It's some kind of macho thing: 'I can make
things happen. I'm going to show you how it's done.' " Besides the
project's latent narcissism, exhibitionism on the part of the
participants would get in the way of sincere emotional exchange,
Goldberg said. "You can't develop a relationship with all kinds of
cameras watching. It colors the whole experience.... It's not much
different than 'Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire' or some of those
dating shows. But it's cute. And it creates publicity for his
magazine."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of that week, Epstein had gone on three dates,
including the one with Rubenstein. Miles and miles to go. He was
meeting with his team of assistants, publicity people, interns and a
couple of friends later in the week to discuss how to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and he had just spoken to one of his previous dates by phone.</TE>
<TE>   "She called to say hello and remind me that I missed her
birthday," he said, before asking: "Did I tell you People magazine
called?"</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My husband and I got lost in Cheviot Hills the other day, which is
not as difficult to do as it sounds. All it requires is a
misunderstanding of where the golf course stands, and there you are,
driving round and round in a lavender blur of agapanthus. One
elm-shaded, black-shuttered house followed another, and for a few
moments we thought the simplest solution would be to just buy one of
these houses and begin anew in Cheviot Hills. But having neglected to
hire Arthur Andersen to do our books, this was not a possibility, and
so we drove on.</LD>
<LD>   Eventually, we wound up on Pico Boulevard, where we had a brief
argument over which way was west. I pointed firmly in one direction
while my husband peered in another trying to figure out our
relationship to the Westside Pavilion. Then he realized that I was
pointing toward the setting sun and so was probably right. Probably.
We breathed a sigh of relief as we headed on our way, and I'm not at
all sure why. Cheviot Hills is a lovely neighborhood, and I doubt
we'll tour it again in the near future. For a few minutes there we
forgot about the fine art of getting lost in L.A.</LD>
<TE>   There is a Brigadoon-like quality to this city--if you substitute
smog for mist and imagine Gene Kelly in cargo shorts and a baseball
cap, which is not an unpleasant thing to do. One minute you're
heading toward an appointment with your new chiropractor and two
wrong turns later you're in a neighborhood just 10 miles from your
home that until now you did not even know existed. Chances are no
chorus line of kilted lads will appear (although in parts of Silver
Lake and West Hollywood this is not an impossibility), but there is
something magical about it all the same. A place where there was no
place before, houses and schools and magnolias where once there was
just an unshaded portion of the Thomas Guide in your mind.</TE>
<TE>   The trick is not to panic. Many people panic when they get lost in
L.A., as if any misstep will result in them getting carjacked or
arrested, as if the great Gym Teacher in the sky were grading them on
their commitment to some prearranged course. You see these drivers
blocking traffic, veering toward the curb, hovering beneath the signs
at intersections, then accelerating wildly, lost, panicking. They
don't seem to realize that when driving in L.A., digression is the
greater part of valor. That, as with so many things in life, the best
thing to do is surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Surrender to being lost. This is still your city, these are still
your people, no one is going to pull you over and demand to see
identification papers (well, probably no one is going to pull you
over and demand to see identification papers). The best way to learn
about any city, or anything much, for that matter, is to get lost in
it. I once traveled through Portland, Ore., with a man who had
written a well-known book about driving through America and he could
not go two miles without getting lost. After about the 15th "long-way
round," I asked him how on earth he ever managed to write such a
book. "Just like this," he said, placidly, taking yet another wrong
turn. "Just like this."</TE>
<TE>   In the last month, I have been lost in West Adams, South-Central,
Agoura Hills, La Canada and Malibu. I have seen unexpected hilltops,
old boxcars, roadside crosses, houses that looked like Russian hotels
and neon-lit churches, chain-saw art and a boulder perched like an
ancient cairn on a shoulder of the Santa Monica Mountains. I have
made U-turns that were probably illegal but should have won me
awards, followed a road until it turned into a barnyard, and was once
forced to drive in reverse along a canyon road so narrow I kept
looking for Wile E. Coyote and his Acme anvil. But everything that
needed to be done got done, and now I know never to get caught on
Kanan Dune Road at rush hour.</TE>
<TE>   It's a question of attitude, of being hopefully, rather than
hopelessly, lost. If you keep moving, eventually you'll get there.
You'll hit a street whose name you know or a landmark you recognize.
Like the Westside Pavilion. Or Saddle Peak rock. Or the sun.</TE>

<LD>Farms are places where crops are grown and animals are raised. Did
you know that there's a 4-acre working farm in the middle of Costa
Mesa? It's called Centennial Farm, and it's there to help you learn
more about how a farm operates. Here are a few fun facts provided by
the farm.</LD>
<LD>   Sheep</LD>
<LD>   * Sheep are sheared once a year in spring or early summer.</LD>
<TE>   * An expert shearer can clip more than 100 sheep in one day.</TE>
<TE>   * Fleece (the wool covering a sheep) is removed in one piece and
weighs 8 to 9 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   * One sheep provides enough wool to make a man's suit.</TE>
<TE>   Pigs</TE>
<TE>   * Pigs' skin is pink, but their hair can be different colors.</TE>
<TE>   * Sows (mother pigs) usually have eight to 12 piglets (baby pigs).</TE>
<TE>   * Unlike those of puppies and kittens, piglets' eyes are open and
they are able to walk as soon as they are born.</TE>
<TE>   * Pigs don't have much hair to protect their skin from the sun, so
they lie in mud to keep cool.</TE>
<TE>   Cows and Goats</TE>
<TE>   * Cows and goats make milk, cheese and butter.</TE>
<TE>   * A cow can produce about 1,977 gallons of milk and 600 pounds of
butterfat in a year.</TE>
<TE>   * Goats produce three to four quarts of milk per day.</TE>
<TE>   * Because the "fat globules" are smaller, goat milk is easier to
digest than cow milk.</TE>
<TE>   * A baby cow is a calf, and a baby goat is a kid.</TE>
<TE>   You can visit the Centennial Farm during the Orange County Fair,
July 12-28. It is also open to the public during the rest of the
year. Free tours for schoolchildren are offered September through
June. For more information, visit www.ocfair.com or call (714)
708-1618.</TE>

<HD>French 9/11 Theory Finds Voice in the U.S.</HD>
<DH>Despite alleged internal clashes, firm will publish a claim
that tragedy resulted from failed oil talks. It was a big hit in
France.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the minor mysteries of Western culture is how a country that
makes a fetish of reason, as France does, can produce quite so much
pernicious nonsense masquerading as literary or journalistic
analysis.</LD>
<LD>   Jacques Derrida and the deconstructionists are Exhibit A.</LD>
<LD>   There is, however, nothing mysterious about American publishers'
recognition that commerce and controversy often are entwined, which
is why so many of these Francophonic fantasies ultimately find an
English voice. The latest such translation involves the events of
Sept. 11 and has sparked an unusual internal argument over Nation
Books' decision to publish "Forbidden Truth" by two Parisians,
Jean-Charles Brisard, a "financial investigator," and Guillaume
Dasquie, a journalist who specializes in intelligence issues.</LD>
<TE>   Their book is one of two post- 9/11 fables that have become
bestsellers in France. The other is Thierry Meyssan's "L'Effroyable
Imposture" (The Horrifying Fraud), which alleges that the Pentagon
was struck by a missile and the twin towers by remote-controlled
airliners, all at the behest of right-wing conspirators inside the
U.S. government. Brisard and Dasquie's book was just three weeks in
the writing and was published in France under the title "Bin Laden:
La Verite Interdite" (Bin Laden: The Forbidden Truth).</TE>
<TE>   Brisard, 32, and Dasquie, 35, allege not only an intricate Saudi
conspiracy to support Osama Bin Laden's terror network, but also that
"the Bush Administration stalled the search for Bin Laden as a
bargaining chip to cut a deal with the Taliban to run an [oil]
pipeline through Afghanistan to the Indian Ocean." The breakdown of
those purported talks, the authors suggest, precipitated the attacks
of 9/11. "Oil, not terrorism, is why we are in Afghanistan,"
according to a synopsis accompanying an uncorrected galley made
available to the press.</TE>
<TE>   Nation Books, which intends to publish "Forbidden Truth" in
September, is a sister organization of Nation magazine, whose
Washington editor, David Corn--also a regular commentator on National
Public Radio--has critiqued and dismissed Brisard and Dasquie's book
in two different articles. Though he declined to discuss Nation
Books' "internal discussions," sources familiar with them said Corn
was "dismayed and agitated" when he learned the publisher had
purchased the manuscript. According to those sources, Corn wrote a
memorandum "dissecting the book and vigorously objecting to its
publication" as contravening the liberal magazine's principles.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with these contrived conspiracy theories," said Corn,
"is that they obscure the facts about genuine governmental
malfeasance. How do you deal, for example, with the CIA's actual
misdeeds when a significant part of the population has been led to
think the agency killed John Kennedy? Promoting that sort of thing is
just plain exploitative."</TE>
<TE>   Nation Books recently has enjoyed unexpected financial success
with a volume of essays by Gore Vidal and former prosecutor Vincent
Bugliosi's explication of the Al Gore-George Bush electoral standoff
in Florida. Carl Bromley, who recently took over the press, argues
that--Corn's criticism notwithstanding--"Forbidden Truth" is not
exploitation. "I look to publish what is interesting and
stimulating," he said. "The Nation magazine is a big tent; the press
is an even bigger tent which I hope reflects the lively state of
culture and discussion on the left and center left. I am looking
forward to any controversy that results from publishing this book
because my role as an editor is to make a dent in the public
discourse."</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Alicia Robles who is handling publicity for "Forbidden
Truth," put it: "We are expecting big things from this book."</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   John Rhodehamel is the Norris Foundation curator of American
history at the Huntington Library. His most recent book is "The
American Revolution: Writings From the War of Independence," which he
edited for the Library of America.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been working for the past six years on editing the diaries
of Gideon Wells, who was secretary of the Navy under Abraham Lincoln.
I hope it will be out in the fall of 2003. It is without question the
most important diary kept by a member of the Lincoln Administration
because it provides us the best--and, in some cases, the only--inside
information on many of the most important events of that period. It
also is the only diary by a Cabinet member that covers the whole
Civil War. There is unequaled material, for example, on the genesis
of the Emancipation Proclamation and on some of the near-rebellions
that took place inside Lincoln's Cabinet early in the war. There is
also some very good firsthand information on Lincoln's assassination.
Wells was in the room when Lincoln died seven hours after he was shot
and provides a description of that period.</TE>
<TE>   "What's particularly valuable about Wells is that he wrote his
diary entries at the end of every day. He was a former newspaper man
and I think newspaper people have an enviable talent for composing
quickly and freshly. After Wells retired he went back and changed his
diary. Some of the alterations were stylistic, others were undertaken
to make himself look better. Many were deceptions intended to
denigrate Wells' great enemy, William Seward, Lincoln's secretary of
state. Another of his enemies was Ulysses S. Grant, whom Wells liked
when he was a general but opposed when he became president. So, Wells
went back and rewrote the favorable passages he had composed about
Grant during the war.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm doing is a kind of reverse literary engineering,
restoring Gideon Wells' actual contemporaneous diary based on the
original manuscript, which is in the Library of Congress."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last year, Tony Valentine, a retired Atlantic City police
detective-turned-casino troubleshooter, made his debut to
well-deserved praise in James Swain's "Grift Sense." His second
stroll among the high rollers, "Funny Money" (Pocket, $24, 290 pages)
is even more entertaining. In it, the aging but razor-sharp
sneak-spotter travels from his home in Florida to his old police
stamping grounds to investigate and avenge the murder of his former
partner and, not coincidentally, to discover how a man nicknamed the
European continues to beat the blackjack tables at the town's biggest
casino.</LD>
<LD>   Part of the book's fascination comes from the author's apparently
endless supply of grifter, or--to use a synonym he
prefers--crossroader lore. A gambling expert and magician, Swain
sprinkles the plot with descriptions of luck-enhancers that range
from the logical--if a casino uses cards with a one-way back design,
players can track any card that gets turned around--to the exotic--a
"monkey's paw" is "a mechanical device that cheaters stick up the
coin tray of a slot machine. It has a light on the end that activates
the slot machine into paying out even when the reels aren't lined up
correctly."</LD>
<TE>   In less professional hands, these authentic-seeming bits of
esoterica, however fascinating, might detract from the book's forward
progress. Swain shuffles them smoothly into the story before dazzling
us with an array of tricks and diversions leading to his big payoff.
The mood is hard-boiled to be sure but leavened by humor, including
the occasional Chandler-esque thumbnail description (a young man has
"enough rings in his nose to hang a shower curtain"). I can't think
of a novel I've enjoyed more this year.</TE>

<TE>   It's commonly held that one should wait until something is broken
before attempting to fix it. But deputy sheriff-turned-author Michael
McGarrity seems to be ignoring that bromidic advice with some measure
of success. His new "The Big Gamble" (Dutton, $23.95, 273 pages), the
seventh police procedural novel featuring New Mexico lawman Kevin
Kerney, suggests that the splendid series may be in the midst of a
significant shift in focus.</TE>
<TE>   In book five, "The Judas Judge," Kerney discovered that a youthful
romance with a Native American had resulted in a son, Clayton Istee,
an Indian Reservation lawman who was himself a father. Their edgy
relationship is explored further in "Gamble," but more than that, as
both men pursue a growing list of related murders leading to a vice
operation of international scope, McGarrity devotes at least half of
the novel to Istee's end of the investigation. The obvious comparison
would be to Tony Hillerman's books set in the Southwest featuring
Navajo Tribal Policemen Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee who, though not
related by blood, share a similar relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Though it lacks some of the high powered suspense of last year's
"Under the Color of Law," a series standout, "Gamble's" smartly
detailed police work and, on the personal front, the gradual
lessening of the Kerney-Istee estrangement, keep the pages turning.
It will be interesting to see if McGarrity continues to use the
dual-protagonist format or if, like Hillerman, he'll give his younger
hero a case and a novel all his own.</TE>
<TE>   A Foodie Sleuth With</TE>
<TE>   a Taste for Mystery</TE>
<TE>   "Sharpshooter" by Nadia Gordon (Chronicle Books, $11.95, 272
pages) is a July novel marking its publisher's entry into the mystery
field. The San Francisco-based house is known for its somewhat quirky
yet visually appealing hard- and soft-covers. This new trade-sized
paperback fits right in.</TE>
<TE>   Its cover is attractive, and there's a reassuringly substantial
heft to it that suggests quality paper and binding that won't fall
apart at the beach. The real question, of course, is if it's worth
taking to the beach. That would be a yes, assuming that the reader
has access to enough food and drink at hand not to be driven to
distraction by the book's rapturous descriptions of gourmet meals and
world-class wines.</TE>
<TE>   The current mystery field is overladen with
foodie-sleuths--caterers, chefs, bakers, quaint little
bed-and-breakfast owners. But while arriving a bit late for dinner
mysteries, Gordon introduces Napa Valley restaurateur Sunny McCoskey
and her idiosyncratic neighboring vintners in such a casual,
easygoing manner it feels as if the series has been around for a
while.</TE>
<TE>   With its title reference to both an insidious grapevine-destroying
insect (the glassy-winged sharpshooter) and the unknown marksman who
murdered an unpopular son of Napa's reigning wine family, the novel
is a little too edgy to qualify as a cozy mystery. But, like the best
cozies, it abounds in charm and reader comfort. Sunny is a welcome,
energetic heroine whose expertise in the kitchen and lack of it on
the trail of a murderer are explored to full advantage.</TE>
<TE>   She and her pals are fun to be around, particularly when they're
just hanging out, sampling the local grape, talking shop and subtlety
or openly expressing their feelings toward one another. There's a
little letdown when the book gets around to removing the mask from
the murderer. That might seriously damage a Miss Marple novel, where
the puzzle is all. Here, after enjoying such good company, remarkable
meals and excellent wines, it seems like something a guest should
politely overlook.</TE>

Dog" and its sequel, "Laughing Dog" (Poisoned Pen Press).</TE>

<LD>Glory and Quentin helped Mrs. Arbuckle unload her fancy picnic
basket. Mrs. Arbuckle always set her picnic table with a white linen
tablecloth and fine china.</LD>
<LD>   "I love the Fourth of July," Mrs. Arbuckle said as they spread the
tablecloth. "My forefathers fought in the Revolutionary War, you
know."</LD>
<LD>   Quentin looked impressed. "Four fathers?" he whispered to Glory.
"How come she has four fathers?"</LD>
<TE>   But Glory was too sad to pay attention to him.</TE>
<TE>   Everything was in a hubbub. The Turkey Creek School Band was
tuning instruments. Junior Forbes puffed oompahs on his tuba. Elsie
Ivy West tootled her flute. Ronald Atwood blew sour blats on his
trombone.</TE>
<TE>   Over by the creek the Singing Mothers practiced. "Mine eyes have
seen the glory," they trilled.</TE>
<TE>   Little Betsy Rosses and Uncle Sams were everywhere. George
Washington strolled by drinking a bottle of root beer.</TE>
<TE>   Sugar McCrary was there, draped in a white sheet and carrying a
torch, like the Statue of Liberty.</TE>
<TE>   She listened while Glory told Mrs. Crilly, the school principal,
that mice ate the flag.</TE>
<TE>   "Mice?" Mrs. Crilly echoed.</TE>
<TE>   "Ate the flag," Glory repeated.</TE>
<TE>   Sugar McCrary smiled. "Isn't that too bad?"</TE>
<TE>   She didn't look as if she thought it was too bad.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin looked up at Mrs. Crilly. "Can't Glory lead the parade
with a little flag? There are lots of little flags."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, mercy no," Mrs. Crilly said. "To lead a parade, you must have
a big flag. One that snaps in the breeze."</TE>
<TE>   She gazed at Glory. "I'm sorry, dear. If there is no big flag,
we'll have the Statue of Liberty lead the parade this year."</TE>
<TE>   She put an arm around Sugar McCrary's shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   Sugar showed all her teeth in a piano-keys smile.</TE>
<TE>   Glory turned and sadly walked away. It was definitely not her day.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: Will Glory have to watch from the sidelines while Sugar
leads the parade?</TE>
<TE>   Lael Littke once got to ride her horse and carry a flag in the

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bruschetta, the traditional Italian garlic bread grilled over coals
or wood, is a good appetizer for summer entertaining. The grilled
surfaces of the bread are rubbed with cut garlic, then drizzled with
olive oil and typically served with toppings.</LD>
<LD>   I sometimes like to make a meal of bruschetta. Two of my favorite
toppings are herbed goat cheese with roasted red peppers and shrimp
salad. The toppings can be prepared a day ahead; it's easy to spread
them on the warm bread slices just before you eat.</LD>
<LD>   Choose the highest quality crusty baguette and cut it at an
exaggerated angle to produce the largest 1/2-inch thick slice, about
3x5 inches. Grill until light grill marks appear, leaving the inside
of the bread soft.</LD>
<TE>   Basic Bruschetta</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 10 minutes * Vegetarian</TE>

<TE>   Grill one side of the bread until light grill marks appear, 2 to 4
minutes. Lightly rub the grilled surface with the garlic. Place the

<HD>A Little Fizz for Your Fourth</HD>
<DH>Some rowdy drink ideas for the backyard party</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tomorrow is the Fourth of July, and when it comes to drinks no one's
looking for sophistication. What you want is a cocktail that's almost
rowdy, a drink that's in the spirit of the day.</LD>
<LD>   It has to be ice-cold, of course, and highly flavored so it's not
upstaged by the season's spicy grilled food. It should look good in a
frosty glass, and not be so loaded with alcohol that you can't take
more than a sip or two. A little fizz doesn't hurt either. Remember,
it's summer, and you're going to be thirsty.</LD>
<LD>   Exactly what drink fills the bill is personal, subject to the
influences of climate and culture, as much as taste. We asked a
number of California cooks to name their favorite--some are native to
the state, others are transplants from other warm regions of the
world such as Mexico, Indian and steamy New Orleans. In fact, we got
a list of drinks so varied, they were almost as individual as a
signature.</LD>
<TE>   Legend has it that one is even named for a beach--Daiquiri Beach
in Cuba. Like the margarita, the daiquiri has undergone so many
variations that the original version--Bacardi rum, sugar and fresh
lime juice shaken with cracked ice--is almost forgotten. Peach,
strawberry and mango daiquiris are common, but you'll have to go to
Xiomara restaurant in Pasadena to get a mint-tinged guanabana
daiquiri.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh spearmint, which is more intense than other mints, accents
the rich flavor of guanabana, a large, white-fleshed fruit that
tastes somewhat like a cross between apples and pears. Restaurant
owner Xiomara Ardolina, who was born in Cuba, compares the drink to
the coco loco.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks creamy, but it is actually fruit, no milk or cream," she
says. "I served it at a party not long ago, and people were crazy
about it."</TE>
<TE>   Ardolina blends light rum with ice, lime juice, triple sec, a
spearmint leaf and frozen guanabana pulp. (Also known as soursop,
guanabana is available in the freezer section of most Latino and some
Asian markets.) She serves her daiquiri in an 8-ounce martini glass
decorated with fresh spearmint and a lime slice.</TE>
<TE>   "A margarita glass will be just as pretty," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine a garden party, with women in flowered dresses--frocks
would be a better word--and lacy picture hats, escorted by dapper men
in white suits, and you have the ideal setting for Rideau's Southern
Breeze.</TE>
<TE>   "I would definitely serve it outdoors, in the garden, under big
oak trees dripping with moss," says the drink's creator, Iris Rideau,
thinking of her New Orleans origins.</TE>
<TE>   Owner of Rideau Vineyard in Solvang, Rideau will serve the drink
at a barbecue there Saturday, probably from a punch bowl, decorated
with peach slices and mint sprigs. The base is Rideau 2001 Riesling,
which is fermented until it is almost dry. Rideau combines the wine
with club soda, triple sec, grenadine and a touch of peach brandy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really refreshing," she says. "It has a little red tone to
it because of the grenadine."</TE>
<TE>   Father's Office in Santa Monica serves baby back ribs cooked with
Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout just one day a year, and
Thursday's the day. The companion drink will be Lethal Espresso, made
with the same stout. Old Rasputin tastes of "chocolate and coffee.
It's a pretty intense beer," says Sang Yoon, the chef and owner, who
combines it with harissa, honey, garlic and seasonings to make a
barbecue sauce for the ribs.</TE>
<TE>   Lethal Espresso is chilled stout combined with a jigger of tawny
port and served in a wine glass. "It tastes like a good, cold
espresso," Yoon says. "It goes well with barbecue because of the
bitterness from the hops."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has spent time in India has probably tried fresh lime
soda. It's one of India's nicest drinks, and a lifesaver when the
heat becomes unbearable. Restaurants usually serve a tall tumbler
containing a little fresh-squeezed lime juice, accompanied by a
pitcher of syrup and a chilled bottle of sparkling water. You then
mix the drink to taste.</TE>
<TE>   An unusual variation from a bartender in the town of Puri on the
east coast adds a pinch of India's black salt. This has to be done
carefully, because black salt (which is gray, not black) is
powerfully sulfurous. Odd as it may sound, a hint of this strong
substance makes the drink even more alluring. Try it if you dare. If
you don't, serve plain lime sodas.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's jamaica is a beautiful jewel-red drink, named for dried
jamaica flowers that provide the color (although it's the husks
covering the flowers that are used). Jamaica is a member of the
hibiscus family, also known as Roselle or sorrel. The flowers shed
their brilliant hue when soaked in hot water--the more flowers, the
deeper the shade.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally acidic, and reminiscent of cranberry juice, jamaica is
pretty and refreshing. That's why you'll find it in most Mexican
restaurants. We've intensified the flavor by adding lime juice. Stir
in some sugar and show off the color by serving the drink over ice in
a clear glass pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Casa Antigua cantina, which opened on the Westside in May, has a
neat idea for last-minute parties. It's an Emergency Sangria, which
can be put together in seconds. The method eliminates the traditional
soaking of wine with cut-up fruits, and reduces the usual large batch
of sangria to a single serving.</TE>
<TE>   The components are red wine, triple sec, orange juice and brandy.
General manager Fernando Briones, who was born and raised in Mexico
City, suggests using a Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon. "They're always
really nice and earthy," he says. "I like to call them honest wines.
You just taste real, fermented grape juice." Briones serves the
sangria in a large red wine goblet rather than in the usual tall
glass.</TE>
<TE>   No thirsty guest could resist.</TE>

<LD>With its fine selection of growers, devoted customers and veteran
manager, the Pasadena Saturday farmers market ranks in the top tier
of markets.</LD>
<LD>   One of its special pleasures is the just-picked produce grown by
Mike Taylor in his West Covina backyard, such as luscious Brown
Turkey figs, aromatic Santa Rosa plums, purple Japanese eggplants and
a bevy of heirloom tomatoes, including flavorful Brandywines, fuzzy
yellow Peaches and Enchantment plum tomatoes.</LD>
<LD>   Joan Kaplan from Altadena offers fresh sprouts. Some, such as
garbanzos and lentils, are grown in jars indoors and have sprouts
just emerging from the moistened seeds; in others, like the sharp
radish and mild alfalfa, the sprouts have pushed out an inch or so,
while her sunflower and pea sprouts are actually infant plants, grown
in flats outdoors.</LD>
<TE>   Many shoppers are drawn to the spectacular display arranged by
Jose Hernandez, the vendor for Suncoast Farms of Lompoc: huge mounds
of broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus and artichokes, ornamented by
zucchini with their yellow blossoms.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Ondray sells pristine shiitake mushrooms from Squaw Valley.
Tanaka Farms of Irvine has giant, mild-flavored Maui onions weighing
up to 4 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "That's more than I can use at one meal, so when I buy one I chop
it up and freeze the leftover portion for use later," says Gretchen
Stirling, the market's manager. Stirling has managed the market since
it began in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Valencia oranges, one of the Southland's classic crops, are at
peak quality, and Manuel Alvarez sells superbly sweet and juicy
examples from Fillmore. They come in 20-pound bags for $4.</TE>
<TE>   At the Regier stand, customers gobble samples of superbly
flavorful June Pride yellow peaches as fast as Tami Taylor of Dinuba
can slice them; this Saturday she'll also have Redtop, a classic
50-year-old variety.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena (Victory Park) farmers market, 2800 block of North Sierra
Madre Boulevard, between Paloma Street and Washington Boulevard,
Saturdays 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Hot tip: Look for intensely flavored sweet-tart Persian mulberries
from Kim and Clarence Blain at today's Santa Monica market, and at
Hollywood on Sunday.</TE>

<TE>   Hoisin-Marinated Steak in Spring Onion Pancakes</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   For a spicier sauce for dipping, add a teaspoon of hot Chinese
mustard to the reserved marinade.</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon soy sauce</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup hoisin sauce</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic, finely minced</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon grated ginger root</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon brown sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds top sirloin steak, about 1 inch thick</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon oil</TE>
<TE>   2 large red bell peppers, cut into long, thin slices</TE>
<TE>   4 green onions, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</TE>
<TE>   1 (10 1/2-ounce) package spring onion pancakes, thawed</TE>
<TE>   3 cups fresh pea sprouts, rinsed and dried, for serving</TE>
<TE>   Heat the grill or a stovetop grill pan over high heat.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the soy sauce, hoisin sauce, lemon juice, garlic, ginger
and brown sugar in a bowl. Coat both sides of the steak with 1/4 cup
of the marinade and place the rest in a serving bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Grill the steak until medium-rare or until it reaches an internal
temperature of 140 degrees, about 5 minutes each side. Let rest for a
few minutes, then slice the steak into very thin pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the
bell peppers and onions until soft and the green onions start to turn
golden, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and place on a serving
plate.</TE>
<TE>   Place the pancakes on the grill. Turn after they've puffed, about
1 minute, and cook until the pancakes soften and show golden grill
marks. (If you over-grill them, they will dry out and crack when
rolling.) Stack the pancakes on a serving plate.</TE>
<TE>   At the table, have each person brush the surface of a pancake with
the reserved marinade, then place several strips of steak so that
they overlap down the center of the pancake. Spread the bell peppers
and green onions on top, followed by a handful of pea sprouts so that
they hang out the ends. Tightly roll up the pancake and cut in half
on the diagonal. Any remaining marinade can be used as a dipping
sauce.</TE>

<LD>Barbecue sauce may be the most abused foodstuff in the American
pantry. In its natural state--whether made at home or a good
commercial brand--a good sauce is glorious, fiery and tart and just
the thing to balance the rich smokiness of a well-grilled piece of
meat.</LD>
<LD>   But come the Fourth of July, it seems like every Tom, Dick and
Harry decides he's Emeril Lagasse and takes that perfectly good sauce
and Kicks It Up a Notch! Bam! (And I am being gender-specific here;
manhandling barbecue sauce is very much a guy thing.)</LD>
<LD>   They say they're "doctoring it up" (which begs the question of
whether the cure is worse than any possible disease). They make it
cloyingly sweet by adding everything from molasses and corn syrup to
Coca-Cola and grape jelly. They make it unbearably hot by pumping it
full of cayenne or minced habaneros. They empty the spice drawer,
tossing in handfuls of cumin, fennel seed and dry mustard.</LD>
<TE>   In short, they cook with all the discretion of sailors on shore
leave. Too much is not enough when the smell of charcoal is in the
air. For God's sake, try a little restraint this summer. Give your
old sauce (and the people you're feeding) a break and try something
different.</TE>
<TE>   Put away the ketchup and liquid smoke. Forget the long marinating.
Season your meat simply with salt and pepper. Grill it carefully.
Then add something that will accent its natural flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Abandon the conventional. There are greener pastures out there,
richer fields to explore.</TE>
<TE>   Let's start with the rich. One of the best and most overlooked
sauces for grilled meat is butter. Let's face it, the list of things
that a little bit of butter won't improve is short. But what we're
talking about here is something a little more complex than just a
simple pat of fat.</TE>
<TE>   Compound butters are a venerable French institution that have
fallen sadly into disuse. They may sound complicated, but they are
nothing more than butter whipped with some flavorings, shaped into a
log and chilled, then dispensed in coins to melt atop the grilled
meat.</TE>
<TE>   One that behaves very much the way you'd like a barbecue sauce to
is chipotle butter, made by adding a bit of the peppers pureed in
their vinegary adobo sauce and served on a grilled pork chop. You
could even make a barbecue butter, flavored with plenty of cayenne, a
bit of cumin and a couple stiff shots of Tabasco. The one necessary
element in these compound butters is a bit of acidity to balance the
richness. It doesn't take much, even a couple of drops of lemon juice
will help balance the flavors. Other citrus will work as well, as
will wine or vinegar.</TE>
<TE>   If you want something a little saucier, try a salsa verde ... or
two of them.</TE>
<TE>   Both Italians and Mexicans make a green sauce. They are completely
different, yet both pair remarkably well with grilled foods. Salsa
verde is one of the most basic elements in Mexican cuisine. Yet
recipes for it are wondrously diverse, affording all kinds of
opportunities for improvisation. The one constant element is the
verde--tomatillos.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, each cook is on his own. There isn't even agreement
on whether the sauce is raw or cooked--or how.</TE>
<TE>   The simplest version is made by crushing raw tomatillos with
jalapeno or serrano chiles and some garlic. Add a little diced white
onion and some chopped cilantro and there you are. Some cooks cook
the tomatillos, which softens their texture as well as their tart
edge. You can do that by boiling them briefly or by charring them
under the broiler or on a griddle. I prefer charring, which adds
another level of complexity to the flavor.</TE>
<TE>   The most traditional way of making the puree is the
molcajete--those volcanic stone mortars and pestles. You can try it
if you like, but you'll probably find yourself amazed at just how
tough those little tomatillo skins really are.</TE>
<TE>   Most cooks today use either a blender or a food processor. The
blender results in a smoother, more liquid puree; the processor
pulses it into chunks. It's up to you which texture you prefer.</TE>
<TE>   Once this basic puree is made, you can thin it by adding water
(for an even more elegant sauce, you can use stock). Frequently the
salsa made from cooked tomatillos will be cooked again: briefly fried
in a bit of oil to further soften the hard edges.</TE>
<TE>   How much the sauce is cooked and in what way are only the first
variables. Try adding a little juice from those tiny, sweet yellow
limes you find at Mexican groceries. A pinch of pungent dried oregano
would be nice too.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to being spooned over grilled fish or meat, salsa
verde can be used as a sauce for enchiladas or chilaquiles. It even
makes a tangy marinade for pork or chicken.</TE>
<TE>   The Italians also have a salsa verde and--typically--it is a
joyous anarchy of a recipe. At its most basic, it is a paste of green
herbs, garlic and olive oil. But from there, the variations spin out
infinitely.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, which green herbs? Parsley usually predominates, but
adding basil, sorrel, tarragon, arugula or mint--or any combination
of those--will result in subtly different flavors. Use more sorrel
when you're serving it with shellfish, mint with lamb, tarragon with
chicken.</TE>
<TE>   Commonly, anchovies are added. Capers are good too. Some cooks add
chopped hard-boiled egg, which seems like it would be very nice when
served with cold beef. You can increase the heft of the sauce by
adding some toasted bread before you make the puree. This results in
a thicker, more satisfying texture.</TE>
<TE>   While only masochists or the truly burly will use a mortar and
pestle for the Mexican salsa verde, do try it for the Italian
version--it makes for a better sauce. A mortar and pestle crushes and
smears the herbs rather than chopping them, which marries the flavors
better and makes the sauce creamier and better amalgamated.</TE>
<TE>   Another thing salsa verde has going for it is a clear and
well-documented history of being used as a base of improvisation.</TE>
<TE>   According to Anna Del Conte's "Gastronomy of Italy" (recently
reissued by Friedman/Fairfax Publishing, $40), the first written
record of the sauce is found in the anonymous 14th century Venetian
book "Libro per Cuoco" and includes parsley, ginger, clove and
cinnamon.</TE>
<TE>   By the 16th century, a recipe from the writer Bartolomeo Scappi
had reduced the spices in favor of greens--sorrel, spinach tops, mint
and arugula (he also added bread as a thickener). Pellegrino Artusi,
the 19th century author of "The Science of Cookery and the Art of
Eating Well"--the Italian "Fannie Farmer"--came up with the modern
salsa verde by adding capers, onion, anchovy and olive oil.</TE>
<TE>   So, this holiday, when you're doing your backyard-chef bit,
throwing in a handful of this or a big slurp of that into a rich
compound butter or some vibrant salsa verde, just tell anyone who
asks that you're following in a grand historical tradition.</TE>
<TE>   If they don't buy that, point out that at least you're laying off
the barbecue sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Roquefort Butter</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 5 minutes plus 1 hour
chilling</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, at room temperature</TE>
<TE>   2 ounces crumbled blue cheese (about 1/4 cup)</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons Cognac</TE>
<TE>   Pepper, salt</TE>
<TE>   Beat the butter with a wooden spoon or in a mixer until it is
smooth and light, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cheese and continue beating
until smooth. Add the Cognac and beat until completely incorporated.
Season generously with pepper and mix again. Taste for salt and add
more if necessary (blue cheeses tend to be salty).</TE>
<TE>   Spread the butter on a sheet of wax paper or plastic wrap in a
line 6 inches long. Roll it up as for a sausage, forcing the butter
into a cylindrical shape. Twist the ends of the wax paper in opposite
directions to tighten the butter and remove air. Chill until firm.
Slice into coins before serving.</TE>
<TE>   About 1/2 cup. Each teaspoon: 44 calories; 72 mg sodium; 12 mg
cholesterol; 5 grams fat; 3 grams saturated fat; 0 carbohydrate; 1
gram protein; 0 fiber.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Italian Salsa Verde</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Salsa verde is based on parsley, but it's the additional herbs
that provide the subtle shifts in character. Use the suggested herbs
according to your taste and the type of meat with which it will be
served.</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   2 fileted anchovies (preferably salt-packed)</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon minced green onion</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup chopped parsley leaves</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons chopped herbs (basil, tarragon, arugula, mint)</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons capers in brine</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup olive oil</TE>
<TE>   Place the garlic in a mortar with a pinch of salt and pound it to
a paste. Add the anchovies and repeat. Add the onion, parsley, herbs,
vinegar, capers and 1 tablespoon of oil and pound and grind until the
paste is smooth. Stirring and grinding with the pestle, add the olive
oil in 2 or 3 pours, making sure the sauce is well blended before
adding more. Taste for salt and serve.</TE>
<TE>   About 1/2 cup. Each tablespoon: 125 calories; 94 mg sodium; 1 mg
cholesterol; 14 grams fat; 2 grams saturated fat; 1 gram
carbohydrates; 1 gram protein; 0.24 gram fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Food processor or blender variation: With the machine running,
drop the garlic into the feed tube and run until it is finely
chopped. Add the anchovies, onion, parsley, herbs, vinegar, capers
and half the oil and pulse until pureed. With the machine running,
add the remainder of the oil in a steady stream through the feed
tube. Scrape down the sides of the work bowl as needed. Taste for
salt and serve.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Salsa Verde Mexicana</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 10 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, a cooked salsa verde, which this is, would be fried
in oil after the puree was made. This mellows the flavor and binds
the ingredients. When I'm serving it with grilled foods, though, I
like the taste to be a little brighter and less finished.</TE>
<TE>   1 pound tomatillos, husked and rinsed</TE>
<TE>   1 large jalapeno</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup diced white onion</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup chopped cilantro</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Heat the broiler. Arrange the tomatillos and jalapeno on a baking
sheet and roast them under the broiler until their skins have begun
to blacken and blister, 3 minutes. Turn them over and roast 2 more
minutes. Remove from the oven. When cool, about 5 minutes, split the
jalapeno and scrape away the seeds and skins.</TE>
<TE>   With the machine running, drop the garlic into the food processor
feed tube and mince thoroughly. Stop the machine and scrape the
tomatillos and any collected juices into the work bowl. Add the
jalapeno and the onion. Pulse 3 or 4 times to make a coarse puree.
Scrape down the sides of the work bowl as needed. The mixture should
have a distinct body to it rather than being completely smooth. Stir
in the chopped cilantro, add salt to taste and serve.</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups. Each tablespoon: 7 calories; 52 mg sodium; 0
cholesterol; 0 fat; 0 saturated fat; 1 gram carbohydrate; 0 protein;
0.41 gram fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Mortar variation: Heat the broiler. Arrange the tomatillos and
jalapeno on a baking sheet and roast them under the broiler until
their skins have begun to blacken and blister, about 3 minutes. Turn
them over and continue roasting 2 more minutes. Remove from the oven
and set aside. When cool enough to touch, about 5 minutes, split the
jalapeno and scrape away the seeds and skins.</TE>
<TE>   Place the garlic in the mortar with a pinch of salt and pound to a
paste. Add the tomatillos and the jalapeno and work steadily until it
is reduced to a coarse, chunky mixture. Add the onion and work in
thoroughly. Stir in the chopped cilantro and serve.</TE>

<HD>The Man Who Smoked Everything</HD>
<DH>From brisket and ribs to olives, eggplant and pineapple, a
story of obsession</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I wander around these days enveloped in the distinct odor of burning
wood. People have been remarking on it, and I apologize to any who
are offended. Smoke just stays with you, and I've been obsessed with
smoking food lately.</LD>
<LD>   I wasn't always this way. When I was a kid, I used to make my own
custom hamburger sauce out of every condiment in the cupboard, and
one day I ill-advisedly put a whole tablespoon of liquid smoke into
the mix. When I tasted it, I gagged violently. It was years before I
could stand the taste of smoke again.</LD>
<LD>   My recovery was gradual. After college, I cooked on cheap little
hibachis and supermarket barbecues. Then I moved up to a Weber
kettle, and once in a while I'd throw in some moistened wood chips or
trimmings from my apricot tree for variety.</LD>
<TE>   Those were the days when I still thought barbecuing was just a
pleasant way to cook out of doors. But I'd had a faint glimpse of the
possibilities of smoking instead of merely grilling--like commanding
a mighty Wurlitzer of flavor creation, as compared to plunking on a
piano.</TE>
<TE>   I bought a 50-gallon oil drum barbecue and installed a thermometer
on it for more accurate cooking. The maker told me how I could smoke
in it by keeping the temperature around 250 degrees and putting the
meat at the other end of the drum from the coals, so I got a metal
wood chip holder and smoked a few chickens, even the occasional
brisket.</TE>
<TE>   Then I got a gas grill for the convenience, thinking it was the
next step up, but I've never used it very much. Looking back, I can
see the reason; like most gas grills, mine is almost impossible to
keep cool enough for smoking. Without realizing it, I had come to see
smokiness as an essential feature of barbecue, a rich spectrum of
added flavor with a primeval appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, I came upon an electric smoker: the Smokette II,
made by Cookshack of Ponca City, Okla. Before I knew what I was
doing, I'd written out a check for $425 plus shipping. A couple of
weeks later it arrived on my doorstep: a solid, chunky, 88-pound
metal box that looks sort of like a bar refrigerator with an
oven-type dial on top. At last, I could smoke a whole brisket without
having to mother the coals all day.</TE>
<TE>   I realize many barbecuers actually treasure the hours they spend
tending their smokers. It's a meditative thing, like fishing. For
others, it's guy time--a convenient excuse to socialize all afternoon
with their buds, but without having to think they're just killing
time like the gang at "Cheers."</TE>
<TE>   Fine for them, but I'm neither that meditative nor that sociable.
I have accepted these flaws, and I just want a smoker that can run
itself. One I can stoke with hardwood, switch on and leave.</TE>
<TE>   Now that I have one, I've gone kind of smoke-crazy. I've smoked
wonderfully moist chicken and brisket. I've smoked steak, which
seemed an extravagant idea, somehow, but it was sure good. Ribs and
pork shoulder? You bet. I've even smoked a prime rib.</TE>
<TE>   I've smoked leg of lamb. I've smoked rack of goat (five hours at
225 degrees, and I strongly recommend trimming the exterior fat).
I've smoked salmon. I've smoked bologna--you have to find chub
bologna, rather than the sliced kind, but it comes out like a giant
smoky hot dog.</TE>
<TE>   I've smoked hard-boiled eggs, which had a good, surprisingly
subtle smoke flavor, when you consider that they'd spent an hour in
hickory smoke. It turns out there's a tradition of smoking eggs. I've
also smoked olives, another traditional thing. They dried out a
little, but the flavor was attractive.</TE>
<TE>   I've smoked jalapenos, making my own chipotle peppers; they took a
long time and I decided they were more trouble than they were worth.
I've smoked sliced mushrooms, which came out smoky enough but also
rather chewy. Fortunately, they softened up after a night in balsamic
vinegar.</TE>
<TE>   I've smoked eggplant, on the theory that since everybody likes the
smoky note in the Middle Eastern eggplant dip baba ghannouj, smokier
would be better. It was. Experience quickly taught me the long Asian
eggplant is better for smoking than slices of the usual American
globe eggplant, which tend to fall through the grill.</TE>
<TE>   I've smoked mild olive oil with mildly interesting results.
Mustard, on the other hand, is an undeniable success, and I'm going
to smoke mustard on a regular basis from here on out.</TE>
<TE>   I've even smoked fruits. Smoked apples are traditional in England,
but I wasn't very impressed with my result (like eating a baked apple
downwind of a brush fire). Pears came out a little better, because
they were juicier. Pineapple was better still, so I tried bananas,
which turned out to be really terrible. To the hippies of 1967 I can
authoritatively say: Smoking bananas just doesn't work.</TE>
<TE>   I've read that the Chinese were fond of black smoked apricots
during the Tang dynasty. After my banana experience, though, I'm not
going there. (What did they smoke them on, anyway? Cypress, camphor
wood, tea leaves?) And until I become an obsessive home brewer, I'll
forget about making smoked malt, which is what the Germans use for
rauchbier.</TE>
<TE>   Through all this, I have been picking up things experienced
smokers have long known. For instance, that meat stops accepting any
more smoke flavor when its internal temperature reaches 140 degrees
or so. That's why you don't need to add more hardwood chips toward
the end of cooking, and it also means that for maximum smoke flavor
you should put meat in the smoker cold, straight from the
refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   As a lot of barbecuers report, there seems to be a plateau in
cooking larger cuts. When the meat reaches around 170 or 180 degrees,
its internal temperature often sticks there for anything from 45
minutes to two hours. Food science writer Harold McGee suggests this
might be because one of the major muscle proteins, actin, doesn't
denature (soften) until that temperature, and it may be sucking up
the thermal energy.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, nobody had ever told me that you should always remove the
translucent membrane from the inner side of a rack of ribs before
cooking it. That way the meat picks up more flavor from the spice rub
and comes out smokier, and you also don't have to chew away at the
membrane when it's done. Fortunately, it's pretty easy to remove--you
insert a butter knife between the membrane and the meat and work your
way up and down the rack, lifting and pulling until it comes off.</TE>
<TE>   On my electric smoker, I can set the temperature for 225 degrees,
which makes for very moist and tender meat. But this doesn't always
brown the surface as much as I like, and I often throw the meat
(particularly chicken) onto one of my other barbecues for a few
minutes afterward. So I'm not giving up on them, even in my current
smoke mania.</TE>
<TE>   Larousse Gastronomique says meat should be cured in brine before
it's smoked. Of course, Larousse is thinking of smoking as a
preservative method, and actually, it's kind of the other way around.
It's smoking that's necessary for brine-cured meats, because it keeps
their fat from turning rancid.</TE>
<TE>   But none of that concerns me. For this cowpoke, smoking is the
complete reverse of a preservative. Nothing that tastes so good lasts
very long around me.</TE>

<TE>   Smoked Eggplant Salad</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1  1/2
hours * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   Fans of the Middle Eastern dip baba ghannouj like the smoky flavor
of its star ingredient: roasted eggplant. This is a really smoky
eggplant salad. Globe eggplant is awkward here--the slices take up a
lot of space in a smoker and tend to fall through the grill as they
soften.</TE>
<TE>   4 long Chinese eggplants or 6 Japanese eggplants</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic, crushed</TE>
<TE>   1 cup plain yogurt</TE>
<TE>   Peel the eggplants and slice in half. Sprinkle with salt and let
drain in a colander for 20 to 30 minutes. Wipe them off and arrange
them on the smoker grill. Smoke at 225 degrees for 1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the eggplant from the smoker, chop coarsely and pulse in a
food processor with the garlic and yogurt until the mixture moves
smoothly but is not yet pureed.</TE>

<TE>   A lot of rubs contain sugar to counteract the bitter note in the
smoke flavor. It's not necessary, though, and sugar can give meat a

<TE>   1 tablespoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Crush the garlic and rub it all over the meat but don't leave
chunks of garlic on the flesh. Crush the rosemary and thyme and mix
with the cayenne and salt. Powder the meat with it and let it rest
for a couple of hours before barbecuing.</TE>
<TE>   About 1/4 cup.</TE>

<HD>The Hardwood Stuff: How You Can Take Up Smoking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having a dedicated smoker certainly makes the job easier, but you can
smoke in any barbecue that has a lid. Your manufacturer probably
included instructions.</LD>
<LD>   The basic principle is to put pieces of hardwood over the heat
source, close the lid and keep the temperature low (by fiddling with
the top and bottom vents, in a charcoal grill) so there'll be plenty
of smoke and the meat will come out moist and tender. The ideal
temperature is around 225 degrees. Many grills include a thermometer
(usually indicating the "desirable range" but not degrees). Others
can be fitted with a thermometer sold at a barbecue supply store.
Some people just stick a candy thermometer in the smoke vent.</LD>
<LD>   An oven thermometer is not practical--you have to open the
barbecue to read it, losing heat and smoke every time, and in any
case the dial soon blackens and becomes unreadable--but it's worth
using once to get an idea what your grill maker means by "desirable
range." It's probably desirable for grilling but too hot for smoking.</LD>
<TE>   If you're using a charcoal barbecue, you'll have to fire up more
fuel and add it to the fire box every hour or so to keep the
temperature even. This gets tiresome when you're cooking brisket,
which can take up to 12 hours. You don't need to monitor the fuel or
temperature with an electric smoker (you just dial the temperature
setting and forget about it), but most electric models (like many
charcoal smokers) have a water pan that shouldn't be allowed to run
dry or the meat will dry out.</TE>
<TE>   Gas barbecues designed for smoking will probably be common
someday. For now, though, gas barbecues tend to burn too hot. Smoking
on gas is easiest if your grill has two burners with independent
controls. Light one, turn it down as far as possible and stick the
container of wood over it; put the food over the unlit burner. Keep a
close watch on the temperature.</TE>
<TE>   The Time</TE>
<TE>   Cooking times depend on what you're cooking and how thick it is.
At 225 degrees, baby-back ribs should be done in about two hours,
chickens in three, a 5-pound pork butt in six hours, a 12-pound
turkey in 10 and a beef brisket in 12 hours.</TE>
<TE>   If your smoker is heated with charcoal, you don't have positive
control over its temperature and you should check the meat for
doneness every once in a while. Ribs are done when the meat is tender
and starts pulling away from the bone. Chicken or turkey is done when
the leg bone moves easily in its socket. For thick cuts such as
shoulder or brisket, you may want to cut off a piece to assess its
doneness.</TE>
<TE>   Most fish will smoke in an hour or less. It's a good idea to smoke
thin filets at a lower temperature; say, 200 degrees. Fruits and
vegetables, such as pineapple or eggplant, should be done in an hour
at 225 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   The Seasonings</TE>
<TE>   Some barbecuers feel no need for adding seasonings, but
well-smoked meat with a good spice rub is flavorful enough to eat
without any sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Most rubs are basically salt, red pepper and black pepper. You can
vary this with all sorts of other flavorings: mustard, celery seed,
garlic salt, curry powder, dried herbs such as rosemary--the list is
endless. Rub the spices generously into the meat the night before
barbecuing or at least a couple of hours ahead. In the case of
chicken, oiling the skin before rubbing it will make it cook a little
crisper.</TE>
<TE>   The Wood</TE>
<TE>   The kind of wood to use is a matter of taste, though it's widely
agreed that alder is the best for smoking fish.</TE>
<TE>   Hickory or pecan gives a classic Southern flavor, and the brusque,
tarry aroma of mesquite (which is easy to overdo) goes with
Southwestern food. Fruit hardwoods, such as apple or cherry, give a
sweet aroma. (Peach, apricot and plum wood are fine, but they lose
their flavor if the wood is stored too long.) Avocado wood has a
mellow aroma of its own. Many grill masters like to make "cocktails"
of a neutral wood, such as oak, with more flavorful hardwoods.</TE>
<TE>   If you're using backyard trimmings, make sure the wood has dried
out thoroughly or it will blacken the meat. Thin branches need only a
month or two, logs will take a year. Never use a softwood such as
pine, fir or eucalyptus; they impart a penetrating pine-sap taste.</TE>
<TE>   Barbecue supply shops stock hardwood for smoking, but the usual
thin chips are really for adding smoke flavor to ordinary grilled
food. Since smoking is a much slower and longer process, buy wood
chunks an inch thick or be ready to add chips from time to time.</TE>

<TE>   Summertime Peach Pie With Crumb Top</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 30 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 1/2 hours</TE>
<TE>   CRUST</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) butter, ice cold, cut in 1/2-inch pieces</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup shortening, chilled</TE>
<TE>   1 3/4 cups flour, plus more for rolling</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons ice water</TE>
<TE>   Combine the butter, shortening, flour and salt in a food processor
and pulse until the mixture forms pea-sized crumbs.</TE>
<TE>   With the processor running, add 1 tablespoon of ice water.
Continue adding water, 1 drop at a time, with the processor running,
until the dough begins to form a mass. You might not use all the
water. Wrap the dough in plastic and chill about 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Roll out the dough 1/4-inch thick on a lightly floured surface.
Line a 9-inch pie plate with the dough and flute the edge. Chill 15
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line the bottom of the pie shell
with foil, then fill with pie weights, beans or rice. Bake until the
crust is light golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool on a
rack. Remove the weights and foil.</TE>
<TE>   FILLING</TE>
<TE>   10 large peaches</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon almond extract</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup cornstarch</TE>
<TE>   Blanch the peaches in a large pot of boiling water about 30
seconds, then plunge into a bowl of cold water. Peel and slice the
peaches into a bowl. Add the sugar, almond extract and cornstarch.</TE>
<TE>   CRUMB TOP</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) butter</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the sugar,
flour, salt and cinnamon and stir until crumbs form.</TE>
<TE>   Fill the crust with the filling. Pile the crumb topping over the
peaches. Place the pie on a baking sheet. Bake the pie until the top
is golden, the center is set and the filling bubbles around the
edges, 60 to 70 minutes. (If the crumb top begins to get too brown,
cover with a tent of foil.)</TE>

<LD>It's summer, and that means a new crop of barbecue books. One that
stands out is "Legends of Texas Barbecue Cook Book: Recipes and
Recollections from the Pit Bosses" by Robb Walsh (Chronicle Books,
$18.95).</LD>
<LD>   It includes plenty of recipes, but the best part is the
fascinating lore about the history and folkways of Texas barbecue.
The cliche about Texas barbecue is that it's about beef--open-pit
mesquite barbecue. Actually, Texas barbecue is a mixture of Southern,
Midwestern and Southwestern elements.</LD>
<LD>   So in east Texas, people make classic Southern pork barbecue. In
the west, there's a lot of Mexican goat or cow head barbacoa, and
this tradition has spread beyond the Latino population. As Walsh
says, no matter how much cowboys liked beef, it wasn't worth
slaughtering a cow for a meal, but a single goat was about enough to
feed four or five cowboys.</LD>
<TE>   In the center of the state, there's a sizable colony of Germans
and Czechs, who follow their own European tradition of smoking pork,
though sometimes in Texan-ized form. The famous Elgin sausage (the
"gin" pronounced as in "begin," not as in the liquor) is basically a
smoked German garlic sausage with extra red pepper.</TE>
<TE>   This has given a unique spin to Texas barbecue. The German and
Czech places were originally markets that only sold their barbecue
out their back doors. The reason was that their barbecue customers
were migrant cotton pickers who went to the shops for something to
eat because regular restaurants wouldn't serve them (or, to put it
another way, because the cotton pickers wouldn't have to take off
their dirty coveralls and dress up if they were just eating a handful
of barbecue behind a butcher shop).</TE>
<TE>   To go with their hot smoked meat, they'd buy a few things like
crackers, pickles or canned peaches. In a few old barbecues, that's
still all you get. Kreuz Market in Lockhart, one of the most revered
barbecues in Texas, serves your order on a piece of butcher paper
with nothing but bread and crackers--and not a drop of barbecue
sauce, which barbecues in this tradition have only recently, and
grudgingly, started serving.</TE>
<TE>   This means that the recipe for Lockhart-style pork loin calls only
for pork, salt and pepper. Most of the book's sauce, spice rub and
side dish recipes are more elaborate, but there's still a classicism
about the whole approach here.</TE>
<TE>   Two ongoing themes of the book are the growing interaction of
those various barbecue traditions and the power of the state's love
of 'cue. In San Antonio, for instance, Miller's Barbecue operated in
violation of the city's zoning and health department regulations for
decades, but it was such a beloved institution that inspectors never
dared cite it. The clear moral is: Don't mess with Texas barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   Mashed Potato Salad</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 5 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes *
Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   In east Texas, potato salad is roughly mashed and served warm.
Adapted from "Legends of Texas Barbecue Cook Book" by Robb Walsh
(Chronicle, $18.95).</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds baking potatoes (about 3 medium)</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup mayonnaise</TE>
<TE>   2 green onions, sliced</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon sweet pickle relish</TE>
<TE>   4 teaspoons sweet pickle juice</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch chunks. Place them in a
4-quart saucepan with water to cover and bring to a boil over high
heat. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer until the potatoes are
tender, about 15 minutes. Drain.</TE>
<TE>   In a large bowl, mash the potatoes coarsely, leaving some small
chunks, and mix with the mayonnaise, onions, relish, pickle juice,
pepper sauce and salt to taste.</TE>

<TE>   Chipotle Ketchup</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   This recipe comes from Art Blondin, barbecue cook-off competitor
and owner of Artz Rib House in Austin, Texas, from "Legends of Texas
Barbecue Cook Book." If using canned chipotle chiles packed in adobo
sauce, remove the seeds and stems and add them to the food processor
with the other chiles.</TE>
<TE>   3 dried chipotle chiles</TE>
<TE>   3 ancho chiles</TE>
<TE>   3 guajillo or pasilla chiles</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, diced</TE>
<TE>   5 cloves garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons brown sugar, packed</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons ground cumin</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon Mexican oregano</TE>
<TE>   2 cups tomato paste</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   Remove the seeds and stems from the chipotle, ancho and guajillo
chiles. Place the chiles, onion and garlic in a large saucepan and
cover with plenty of water. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and
simmer 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   With a slotted spoon, transfer the chiles, onion and garlic to a
food processor, reserving the liquid. Add the brown sugar, cumin,
oregano, tomato paste and 1 cup of the reserved chile liquid. Puree,
adding more of the chile liquid until the ketchup reaches the desired
thickness. Add salt and pepper to taste. Tightly sealed in a glass
jar, the ketchup will keep refrigerated for several months.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a crowd gathers around the backyard barbecue, you can be fairly
certain that they're less interested in admiring your fabulous cellar
than in letting the good times roll.</LD>
<LD>   This seems to present a dilemma for the wine-loving host: You want
to pour something good, yet there is an undeniable pang in watching
the last drops of a '97 Brunello di Montalcino lubricate the howls of
laughter at the latest lawyer joke.</LD>
<LD>   I've been there. So have you. Let's not go back.</LD>
<TE>   There's plenty of good stuff around at reasonable prices,
especially now. The general quality of wine has never been
higher--that's never, as in the entire history of civilization. And
fierce competition currently favors the buyer, especially for wines
costing $10 a bottle or less. Serving good wine doesn't have to cost
a lot of money, nor deplete the household cellar of its best bottles.</TE>
<TE>   There's something so summertime, so very good life, about sipping
a dry rose around the grill. Its color complements both the sunset
and the glowing coals. The smoke-tinged air sets off a rose's
red-fruit aromas, and its tart, dry flavor is refreshing as the day's
heat fades--all the more if the bottles come from a tub full of
crushed ice.</TE>
<TE>   The 2001 Lawson's Dry Hills Pinot (Marlborough, New Zealand, about
$8.50), with its bracing watermelony flavor, is a good example. The
2001 Chateau Routas "Rouviere" (Coteaux Varois, France, $8) is a
fuller bodied yet perfectly dry rose with real red-berry flavor. The
2001 Toad Hollow "Eye of the Toad" Dry Pinot Noir Rose (Sonoma
County, $8) is also delicious: essence of Pinot grapes and less than
12% alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   The trusty ice tub might also yield a crisp white or two as the
first platter of grilled prawns and aioli starts making the rounds.
The 2000 Fox Run Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes, New York, $9) balances
luscious peach and honeysuckle fruit and knife-edge acidity. The 2001
Veramonte Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley, Chile, $9) has a clean
perfume of ripe Sauvignon grapes with zesty flavor. The 2001 Echelon
Pinot Grigio (Central Coast, $10) offers a summery whiff of orange
blossoms and lush yet snappy grape flavor. It is deeper and richer
than an Italian Pinot Grigio, thanks to California sun and a Viognier
in the blend.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, for most of us grilling is all about delicious reds,
especially Zinfandel, Shiraz and Sangiovese: full-bodied wines that
gleam with the deep red echo of mesquite coals. Inexpensive versions
tend not to reflect particular vineyards or winemakers. They're more
often blended from grapes or bulk wine purchased on the open market.
But guess what? The open market these days is flooded with terrific
juice, and a lot of these wines are excellent.</TE>
<TE>   An outstanding example is the 2000 Mont Pellier Syrah (California,
$5). Grapes, folks--ripe, delicious red grapes with just enough
smoky-leathery tone to signal their variety. What's not to like? A
better-defined, mostly Shiraz wine is Penfolds "Rawson's Retreat"
Shiraz-Cabernet (Australia, $7.50).</TE>
<TE>   Bonny Doon offers two grill-worthy reds at good prices. The 2000
Domaine des Blageurs Syrah (Pays d'Oc, France, $8) is a mouthful of
bold, peppery flavor and palate-cleansing tannin. And the 2000 Ca'
del Solo "Big House Red" (California, $8) is a fortuitous melange of
more than half a dozen red grape varieties blended for easy
grill-side quaffing. The 2000 Francis Coppola Rosso (California, $8)
is another outstanding blend. This is a true California vino tavolo
rosso, an honest table wine intended to make food taste better and
conversation flow. Its fruity Sangiovese and Zinfandel give it
special affinity with fire-cooked meats.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, Zinfandel--the essential California grill wine. These days you
can spend $50 or more for a bottle of single-vineyard Zin. Ravenswood
made its reputation with such bottlings, yet also has the grace to
offer the scrumptious Vintner's Blend (California, $8). It's
full-bodied and smooth with lively berry flavors. If your guests
don't gulp this down, they don't like vino. The 1999 Montevina
Zinfandel (Sierra Foothills, $8) offers a similar value: tasty,
old-style Zin with notes of black pepper and chocolate and pleasantly
raspy tannin.</TE>
<TE>   And when the crowd thins, go ahead and pull a special bottle. Last
week six of us finished a party with my next-to-last bottle of 1996
d'Arenberg Shiraz "The Dead Arm" (McLaren Vale, South Australia). It
was amazingly concentrated, with layer upon layer of rich, spicy
fruit, a beautiful wine that helped make the first full moon of
summer '02 a memorable occasion.</TE>

Entwistle, the band opens its tour with power, emotion and grace.</DH>

<LD>If ever catharsis were in the cards, it was Monday at the Hollywood
Bowl, where one of rock's most emotion-driven bands was due to
perform the most emotional show of its four-decade career.</LD>
<LD>   And indeed, there was the extra charge in the show-opening
power-chord riff of "I Can't Explain," as if guitarist Pete Townshend
were trying to blast a path through the decades to the days when he
and John Entwistle met as London teenagers and began playing
together. That early Who classic also adapted easily from expression
of teenage confusion about love to one of middle-aged confusion over
loss and mortality.</LD>
<LD>   Less than a week ago, the Who was set to embark on another in its
series of periodic reunion tours. Despite some hints from the band's
camp that it might soon record new music for the first time in 20
years, this was really just a classic-rock blip on the summer concert
radar.</LD>
<TE>   But when bassist and founding member Entwistle was found dead,
apparently of a heart attack, on Thursday, the day before the tour
was to open in Las Vegas, purpose and meaning were dropped into the
band's lap, at the greatest price imaginable.</TE>
<TE>   True to the Who's unpredictable, defiant form, Townshend and
singer Roger Daltrey quickly reversed the initial, obvious decision
to cancel the tour, saying they would best honor their bandmate by
soldiering on.</TE>
<TE>   They rushed in a new bassist, Pino Palladino, and postponed two
weekend dates. That made Monday's tour opener the most intently
watched Who date since drummer Kenney Jones debuted as Keith Moon's
replacement in 1979 and probably one of the most oddly anticipated
shows in rock history.</TE>
<TE>   Either meltdown or transcendence wouldn't have been out of the
question under the circumstances. Who's to say that the playing at
the Bowl would have been notably different under normal conditions?
You can only speculate what role the unprecedented mix of grief,
uncertainty and adrenaline played in shaping the performance, but
only hardened cynics would resist the temptation to read its
influence into some of the night's key moments.</TE>
<TE>   The snap and energy of the opening 20-minute salvo of "I Can't
Explain," "Substitute" and "Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere" suggested a
determination to rediscover the sources of the Who's power. Much
later, "Baba O'Riley" and "Won't Get Fooled Again" regained the epic
scale they had in the '70s, and Daltrey's vocal on the "See me, feel
me, touch me, heal me" refrain from "Tommy" bristled with the kind of
life and feeling you just don't expect from a veteran singer at this
stage of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of more than two hours, though, it appeared that
the Who's idea of paying tribute was to hunker down and plunge in and
see what happened. There were no shrines at stage left, no
performances of any of Entwistle's compositions, but the capacity
crowd got its share of mood swings and openhearted acknowledgments,
beginning with an embrace between longtime sparring partners Daltrey
and Townshend before a note was played. The night ended with a
montage of Entwistle photos on the video screens.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight we play for John Entwistle," Daltrey said early in the
show. "He was the true spirit of rock 'n' roll, and he lives on in
all the music we play."</TE>
<TE>   A little later, Townshend, perhaps sensing that the show had taken
on a business-as-usual tone, stepped forward and addressed the
audience. "This is gonna be very difficult," he said. "We understand.
We're not pretending that nothing's happened."</TE>
<TE>   That probably made it easier for the band and audience to relax
into moments of humor, including Townshend's jokes about the
fragrance wafting from the crowd and his sudden discovery of the
acoustical globes hanging inside the Bowl's band shell.</TE>
<TE>   Daltrey also thanked Palladino, saying that the musician "rescued
us in the nick of time."</TE>
<TE>   True enough, the music stayed impressively on track considering
that there had been only two days of rehearsal. Drummer Zak Starkey,
Pete's brother Simon Townshend on rhythm guitar and backing vocals
and longtime keyboard accompanist John "Rabbit" Bundrick complete the
lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Palladino, a veteran session and touring musician who has played
with such artists as Eric Clapton as well as on Townshend albums and
solo tours, negotiated the Who's often complex structures with a
determined steadiness. He avoided Entwistle's ornate designs for the
most part, and he seemed to have the audience on his side from the
start, earning a cheer for his stab at the famous bass solo in "My
Generation."</TE>
<TE>   At the end, it all amounted to an intersection of real life, art,
entertainment and big business that's rare these days. Those were the
elements that swirled around the Who in its turbulent origins, and
it's strangely appropriate that Entwistle's loss brought them back
again, even if only for a night.</TE>

<HD>In Alaska, the Play's the Thing</HD>
<DH>For 10 years, the Last Frontier Theatre Conference has
lured stars from the Great White Way to the Great White North.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DONNA FREEDMAN</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>VALDEZ, Alaska</DL>
<LD>Most tourists come to Valdez for the outdoors. But each June the town
is overrun by hundreds of people who spend their time inside. They
don't bring fishing rods or flotation vests, and they all but ignore
the beauty of the snow-flecked Chugach Mountains, the grandeur of
Prince William Sound and the chance to walk up to a glacier.</LD>
<LD>   They're theater people, and they come north to hobnob with some of
the country's greatest living playwrights at the Last Frontier
Theatre Conference. More than 500 people attended the 10th annual
event, which took place June 13 through 22.</LD>
<LD>   Valdez is more commonly associated with an ecological disaster
than with the performing arts. The rest of the year, the town doesn't
even have a community theater. Once a year, though, it's Broadway
North.</LD>
<TE>   "You've got the top playwrights in the world here. In New York,
you'd never see all these people together in the same room," said
Woodie King Jr., who founded the New Federal Theatre in New York and
has directed both on and off-Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1993, conference founder JoAnn McDowell has coaxed north
renowned actors and playwrights such as Arthur Miller, Horton Foote,
Patricia Neal, Robert Anderson, Jean Stapleton and Terrance McNally.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the playbill included John Guare ("House of Blue
Leaves," "Six Degrees of Separation") and two-time Pulitzer-winner
August Wilson ("Fences," "The Piano Lesson").</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd Richards, who directed the first production of "A Raisin in
the Sun" on Broadway and who ran the Yale Repertory Theatre and the
Eugene O'Neill Theater Festival for years, was back for a second year
in a row. He shared billing with writer-director Jack Gelber ("The
Connection," "Dylan's Line") and Obie-winning actor-director Joseph
Chaikin, founder of the Open Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   But the grand marshal of this theater parade was Edward Albee,
winner of three Pulitzers and numerous other awards, including a Tony
for his current (and controversial) Broadway hit, "The Goat, or Who
Is Sylvia?"</TE>
<TE>   Albee is the reason the conference exists in the first place. In
1992, at a meeting of theater enthusiasts in Anchorage, McDowell
mentioned that she knew the playwright and offered to invite him to
Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   "I could see their eyes rolling," McDowell said. "So I called
Edward and said, 'You have to come--they think I'm name-dropping!"
Albee showed up in summer 1993 and has been to Valdez four times
since. The emphasis on new playwrights makes it different than other
theater festivals, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is much more ambitious," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Opening the Door</TE>
<TE>   McDowell said Albee is the reason the conference succeeded.
Because of his involvement, other artists were willing to take a
chance, and theater fans were willing to travel so far north. After
all, Valdez isn't the easiest place to reach. You fly into Anchorage
and then either drive for six hours or take a 35-minute white-knuckle
flight on a prop jet into the tiny Valdez airport.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to get an Internet connection. My cell phone doesn't
work. But the isolation is part of the reason this thing [succeeds],"
said San Francisco resident Victoria Morse. With no distractions, she
was free to immerse herself in theater, and "my sense of myself as a
writer increased a hundredfold," Morse said.</TE>
<TE>   Days began early, with staged readings of 14 full-length and 94
10-minute play scripts, along with master classes and lectures.
Evening retrospectives of the visiting artists' work were followed by
receptions that invariably ran late. Some nights, non-sanctioned
"fringe" readings of plays and poetry continued into the wee hours.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy eyes were the norm, and conference coffee was as vital as
oxygen. People talked proudly of how few hours they'd slept,
marveling that the body clock-skewing Alaskan summer kept them going
past exhaustion. Although the sun did set, close to midnight, a kind
of twilight lingered until it was time for the day to begin again.</TE>
<TE>   Playwrights came from two dozen states and Canada, most of them to
hear just 10 minutes' worth of their work read. For some, that will
be as close as they ever get to production. Others have found success
here. Aoise Stratford of Berkeley has had two one-act plays in New
York festivals since her first trip to Valdez three years ago.
Another one-act is about to open off-off-Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing what happens [because of Valdez]. Doors open,"
Stratford said.</TE>
<TE>   The town, in turn, is pleased to open its doors. Mayor Bert Cottle
said the event is "an economic boon" that packs the town's five small
hotels and 50 B&amp;Bs but noted that it's also a "cultural opportunity
most people will never have in a lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   That's Shoe Business</TE>
<TE>   Visiting artists get treated to Alaska hospitality: hikes, boat
rides, dinners in private homes. But even famous visitors have to
take their shoes off at the door, an Alaska custom that is a great
social leveler. Valdez loosens up everyone, except possibly Edward
Albee, whose reserved manner is legendary.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, "Edward stories" float around the conference. One
attendee joked that in the two-bathroom Valdez Convention and Civic
Center, sooner or later every man has the chance to urinate next to
Albee.</TE>
<TE>   Concessions employee Ashley Shiell, 15, chided a man who appeared
to be walking off with a muffin: "That will be a dollar, sir."
Co-workers hissed that she was busting Edward Albee!</TE>
<TE>   Illinois playwright Mathew Green had an Edward story too: Albee
was on the panel that critiqued his play, "Honesty." The playwright
urged Green to rethink the use of thunder as a dramatic device--it
reminded him of "movie music"--but he also said, "This is a good play
on [its] way to a very good play."</TE>
<TE>   That meant a lot to Green. So did the fact that judges voted
"Honesty" as one of the top three entries of the conference. "I liked
the play as soon as I wrote it, but I had no idea it would win," said
Green, 27, who teaches high school English and drama in Tuscola,
Ill., near Urbana-Champaign.</TE>
<TE>   He hoped the play would be produced in Urbana, and he dreamed it
might one day play in the Windy City. "Chicago is mecca for me,"
Green said. "I never had any pretensions of Broadway."</TE>
<TE>   Valdez was mecca for Juneau actor Ibn Bailey, who not only met his
favorite writer, August Wilson, but performed with him in scenes from
Wilson's "Fences."</TE>
<TE>   The readings "brought his characters alive for me," said Bailey,
29. The two sat together on a cruise to nearby Shoup Glacier.
Director Lloyd Richards took a snapshot of the master playwright and
the young actor, talking animatedly.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the kind of thing that can happen here," Richards said.
"That's why people come."</TE>

<HD>Patriotic Songs Rousing Extra Emotion This Fourth of July</HD>
<DH>Music* Popular tunes, many not written during wartime,
evoke special significance post-Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAY HOGAN</AU>
<BD>STAMFORD ADVOCATE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"A patriotic song is an emotion," the great songwriter Irving Berlin
once said. "And you must not embarrass an audience with it or they
will hate your guts."</LD>
<LD>   The history of patriotic music in the United States predates the
birth of the nation, so it's no surprise that the thread that ties
together the most enduring of American songs is sentiment, rather
than a particular musical characteristic.</LD>
<LD>   "Emotion is the one classic trait of all music," says Al McCree,
owner and CEO of Altissimo! Recordings, a label that produces and
distributes music from United States military bands. "A classic
patriotic song somehow brings about a strong love of country."</LD>
<TE>   Traditionally, songs such as "Stars and Stripes Forever," "Yankee
Doodle," "God Bless America," and "America the Beautiful" primarily
are heard around the Fourth of July. But the attacks of Sept. 11 have
brought concepts of patriotism and heroism to the fore and placed new
focus on music that can rouse such feelings.</TE>
<TE>   Although these songs come out in times of crisis, they aren't
always written that way. John Philip Sousa, for instance, composed
"Stars and Stripes Forever" aboard a ship on his way back from
Europe. Others were written with the intent of stoking the national
spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "They tend to take on, through association, the mood of the people
or a patriotic spirit in times of crisis," says Deane Root, director
of the Center of American Music and professor at the University of
Pittsburgh. "Take Irving Berlin's 'God Bless America,' which he wrote
about 20 years before World War II. He had to touch it up for the
needs of the moment once the United States was entering the war. That
song, more than any other, symbolizes the wartime spirit in the 20th
century."</TE>
<TE>   Lyrically, the songs usually look beyond flesh and blood for
strength.</TE>
<TE>   "They're calling up a higher power, a higher right than can be
imposed by human government," says Root.</TE>
<TE>   The first U.S. patriotic song might have been "The Liberty Song,"
written by John Dickinson in 1768 (the same year it was published in
Boston newspapers). Sung throughout the colonies at political
meetings, dinners and celebrations, the song was the first to use the
phrase "by uniting we stand, by dividing we fall." Dickinson wrote
the lyrics to fit the music of the anthem of the British Royal Navy,
"Hearts of Oak."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. national anthem, "The Star Spangled Banner," was
designated as such by Congress in 1931, but was written by Francis
Scott Key during the War of 1812.</TE>
<TE>   In September 1814, Key and a friend were trapped on a boat and
watched the British bombardment of Fort McHenry, which guarded
Baltimore. For the melody, Key used the English song, "To Anacreon in
Heaven." The song was popular in Baltimore but didn't become a
national song until the Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   The Civil War produced some of the country's most enduring songs,
and demonstrates how great American music is written with or without
crisis in mind. "Dixie," written by Daniel D. Emmett in 1859 for a
minstrel show, became the rallying cry of the Confederates. The Union
troops' call to arms, "Battle Hymn of the Republic," was written by
Julia Ward Howe on a trip to a Union camp. She scribbled the words
down to the music of "John Brown's Body."</TE>
<TE>   Like Irving Berlin's "God Bless America," "America the Beautiful"
was written during peace time. Katherine Lee Bates, a professor of
English literature, wrote it on an 1893 trip to Pike's Peak. George
M. Cohan, like Berlin, was a popular songwriter whose efforts hit a
nerve with the public during wartime. He wrote "You're a Grand Old
Flag," "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy" and "Over There," a theme of World
War I.</TE>
<TE>   "Music can be arousing for sure," says Jerome Sehulster, professor
of psychology at the University of Connecticut. "The rhythms of a
march tend to be bright sounds, they tend to use brass, they tend to
be inspiring and if you're marching, you can keep step to it."</TE>
<TE>   The Vietnam War was the first American war that produced more
protest songs than patriotic ones, for a variety of reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "What coincides with Vietnam is the civil rights movement and the
folk movement," says Purchase College's Allyson Bellink.</TE>
<TE>   "You have folk music burgeoning in one of many of its rebirths, so
that same recycling is going on," she continues. "During Vietnam we
had an interesting period where people were composing folk music,
which is an oxymoron. It was using the same instruments but the
lyrics were frequently original, drawing from the blues, Woody
Guthrie and Negro spirituals. Rock music of the late 1960s was
continuing along the lines of the modern folk music."</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11 brought on a wave of patriotism perhaps not
seen since World War II. In the wake came music to accompany
confusing times. Tribute concerts came with lots of veteran rockers
no longer serving the counterculture but the establishment.</TE>
<TE>   Whether any of the songs associated with Sept. 11 come to be
historically attached to that day's events isn't clear, though many
music experts believe they won't.</TE>
<TE>   It was clear, however, that country music provided the most
poignant statements after the terrorist attacks. Lee Greenwood's 1984
hit, "God Bless the U.S.A.," nearly replaced the national anthem in
the weeks following the collapse of the World Trade Center. And Alan
Jackson saw massive success with "Where Were You (When the World
Stopped Turning)."</TE>

<HD>They Know Which Way the Wind Is Blowing</HD>
<DH>Television* Miss. State meteorology grads make up a
surprising percentage of on-air weather experts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON STRAZIUSO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>STARKVILLE, Miss.</DL>
<LD>Across the country, a barely detectable Southern flavor spices local
TV weather forecasts, up to a third of which are delivered by former
students of Mississippi State University.</LD>
<LD>   Meteorologists are one part TV star and one part scientist;
Mississippi State takes pride in producing forecasters who can do
both parts equally well.</LD>
<LD>   "That is our claim to fame: producing people who do TV weather and
who are hopefully a little more prepared than Willard Scott," says
Mark Binkley, the program's director, who says NBC's semiretired
weatherman is more a personality than a meteorologist.</LD>
<TE>   The American Meteorology Society, which presents a seal of
approval that's often advertised on local news programs, says about
25% of forecasters it approves are MSU-educated. Keith Westerlage,
director of on-camera meteorology at the Weather Channel, said that,
counting those who study through its distance-learning program, up to
a third of the nation's forecasters have ties to Mississippi State.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the university's formula are two professors: one for the
science, one for everything else.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Verno is the everything-else guy: image consultant, voice
coach, psychologist. He may urge students to have more inflection in
their voice, less movement in their eyebrows. And if asked, he might
quietly advise weight loss to improve job chances.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, Verno says: "I have to let students develop their
style. It's not my place to say, 'You're going to be the serious
weathercaster and you're going to be the more comical weathercaster.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Verno's partner, Mike Brown, handles the science.</TE>
<TE>   The two pride themselves on producing students who are technically
sound.</TE>
<TE>   TV weather has evolved over the years from a strait-laced
presentation in the 1950s and 1960s to a personality-driven approach
in the 1970s. Since the 1980s, stations have pushed for forecasters
with a solid meteorological background.</TE>
<TE>   The American Meteorology Society sets the national standards for
broadcast meteorology, judging both education and communication
skills.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really not supposed to be experts in on-air talent," says
the society's Kelly Garvey. "We pretty much like to judge the
scientific ability of the person, but because it's so important for
the broadcaster to relay the message to the public, we have the tape
grading."</TE>
<TE>   Garvey said the society awards about 80 seals a year. Mississippi
State's 25% take is not matched by any other school, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The university's influence is so wide because of its video and
Internet distance-learning program, which takes three years of study
at 15 hours a week. About 1,400 students have graduated since 1987.</TE>
<TE>   It has helped some of the highest-profile forecasters in the
country. About a quarter of the Weather Channel's 30 on-air
forecasters have Mississippi State pedigrees. The program is popular
because it gives mid-career people a way to advance while continuing
to work, Westerlage said.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Stokes, seen on the Weather Channel on Saturday through
Tuesday mornings, said the program was "wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   "You had to study for this stuff. It's not something you just walk
in without cracking a book," Stokes said. "Some of the more
successful and outstanding broadcast meteorologists have gotten their
education at MSU."</TE>
<TE>   Many weather schools teach more hard-core science than Mississippi
State and are more likely to fill private and government jobs,
including those with the National Weather Service.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Carr, director of the University of Oklahoma's school of
meteorology, says many schools offer a weather broadcasting emphasis
but not the intensive course Binkley and Mississippi State have.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll have to give him credit," Carr says of Binkley. "He's put
Mississippi State on the map with that program," Carr said.</TE>
<TE>   Binkley says research shows TV audiences pick a news channel based
on weather coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "When it's a high of 92 and a 30% chance of showers, they're all
going to say the same thing," he said. "The days that there is severe
weather is when you find out who your best person is. And the only
way to be good in severe weather is to know your meteorology."</TE>

<HD>With 9/11 in Mind, Holiday's TV Events to Emphasize
Security</HD>
<DH>Programming* Metal detectors, added police will be part of
networks' plans for July 4 shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first Independence Day since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks will
certainly be one of the most security-conscious in recent memory,
with those repercussions to be felt by a few of the more than a dozen
televised events planned to commemorate the holiday, running from
early morning till well into the evening.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time in its history, those attending PBS' "Capitol
Fourth 2002" celebration, which will be telecast Thursday from the
west lawn of the U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C., will have to pass
through metal detectors.</LD>
<LD>   "We are probably at the No. 1 most vulnerable site," said
executive producer Jerry Colbert. "The whole Capitol police
force--1,400 men--will be out for security. It's going to be
extremely tight. You need security, and in a way it makes me feel
better. We have two perimeters audiences will have to go through, and
the metal detectors."</LD>
<TE>   Both ABC and NBC will offer their own prime-time specials. Tom
Yellin, executive producer of ABC's three-hour "In Search of America:
A July 4th Musical Celebration," said the producers are in stand-by
mode "for whatever happens" during the program, which visits
Independence Day celebrations around the country, including New York,
Boston, Dallas, and Livingston, Mont.</TE>
<TE>   "We have all kind of contingency plans, but I hope and believe
that won't be something we will have to use," said Yellin.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Independence Day programming kicks off tonight with
"Ultimate Guide: Fireworks," a Discovery Channel documentary on
mankind's centuries-old love affair with fireworks, from the first
Chinese firecrackers of 1,000 years ago to the modern multicolored
displays.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a look at some of the special programming scheduled for
Thursday to capitalize on the holiday:</TE>
<TE>   * "Fawlty Towers": For those still mourning England's loss of the
American colonies, BBC America is featuring a marathon of all 12
episodes of the classic John Cleese British comedy series in which he
plays a most disagreeable hotel manager, beginning at 8 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   * "Military Diaries": VH1 celebrates the holiday with four
back-to-back episodes of its new weekly series that features daily
video dairies recorded by sailors, soldiers and pilots in the Army,
Navy and Marines, starting at 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   * "All American Festivals": Chef Tyler Florence hosts a marathon
of behind-the-scenes looks at regional specialties and related
celebrations, 10 a.m. on the Food Network.</TE>
<TE>   * "Discovery Channel Marathon": The cable outlet presents a
marathon of Americana programming, beginning at 10 a.m. with "Niagara
Falls: Raging Rapids" and concluding at 7 p.m. with "Pentagon."</TE>
<TE>   * "Thanks for Giving": Premiere of a musical "thank you" to the
world---a collaboration between Carly Simon, her sister, Lucy, Lucy's
daughter, Julie, and the children of fireman, policemen and rescue
workers. Nickelodeon and N will simulcast the video at 3:15 p.m.,
repeating it every hour until 8:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   * "Inside the Pentagon": The filmmakers were allowed into some of
the Pentagon's most sensitive areas for this portrait of the American
institution, airing at 5 and 8 p.m. on National Geographic Channel,
which will also run "The Best of America," a special edition of
"National Geographic Today" examining the things America loves best
about itself.</TE>
<TE>   * "Pops Goes the Fourth!": Conductor Keith Lockhart and the Boston
Pops Esplanade Orchestra perform from the banks of Beantown's Charles
River in this annual holiday celebration, playing at 7:30 p.m. on
A&amp;E. Barry Manilow, Maureen McGovern, Miss America Katie Marie
Hartman, and the West Point Hellcats drum and bugle corps are the
special guests.</TE>
<TE>   * "In Search of America: A July 4th Musical Celebration": A
three-hour prime-time special anchored by ABC News' Peter Jennings
pays tribute to Independence Day through its rich musical history.
Performers include Sheryl Crow, Alicia Keys, India.Arie, Hank
Williams Jr and the Boston Pops.</TE>
<TE>   * "A Capitol Fourth 2002": Barry Bostwick is the host of the
nation's birthday party from the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol.
Aretha Franklin, Chuck Berry, Richard Chamberlain, Erich Kunzel, and
the National Symphony Orchestra are among the performers, at 8 p.m.
on KCET and KVCR, also followed on the latter by "Rediscovering
George Washington," a 90-minute documentary promising a "fresh look"
at the U.S.'s first president.</TE>
<TE>   * "Macy's 4th of July Fireworks": New York City's Independence Day
celebrations, with fireworks and patriotic music, at 9 p.m. on NBC.</TE>

<HD>The King Is Dead; Long Live the King</HD>
<DH>Elvis may have died nearly 25 years ago, but he's being
sighted in every medium</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Back in 1960, RCA Records trumpeted Elvis Presley's discharge from
the U.S. Army with an album called "Elvis Is Back!"</LD>
<LD>   Guess what?</LD>
<LD>   With the 25th anniversary of his death approaching, Elvis is back
again. In fact, the King will be visible on so many fronts in coming
months that the title of a whimsical 1987 tribute to Presley's
cultural omnipresence could provide the slogan for the last half of
this year: "Elvis Is Everywhere."</LD>
<TE>   RCA Records is readying two new Elvis compilations. "Elvis--Today,
Tomorrow &amp; Forever," a four-CD set aimed at collectors, has 100
previously unreleased alternate takes, live performances and rarities
and is due Tuesday. It will be followed in September by "Elv1s 30 #1
Hits," RCA's answer to the Beatles' monstrously successful "1" hits
collection, culling Presley singles that topped the charts in the
U.S. or the U.K. on a single CD.</TE>
<TE>   Presley also has, or soon will have, a presence in:</TE>
<TE>   * movies (he figures prominently in the Disney animated hit "Lilo
&amp; Stitch");</TE>
<TE>   * TV (a special targeted for the holidays aims to be the
"definitive" look at his life, although it doesn't have an outlet
yet);</TE>
<TE>   * radio (a "new" Elvis single, "A Little Less Conversation," has
become a No. 1 hit in England and is starting to get airplay in the
U.S.);</TE>
<TE>   * home video (Elvis Presley Enterprises is preparing deluxe DVD
releases of his "Aloha From Hawaii Via Satellite" and 1968 comeback
TV specials);</TE>
<TE>   * publishing (Random House, for one, has three new Elvis-related
books on tap);</TE>
<TE>   * theater (Stages theater in Fullerton just opened the world
premiere production of "The King," a play by Brian Newell about what
might happen if Elvis really did turn up alive today);</TE>
<TE>   * the California Lottery (an Elvis Presley "scratcher" promotion
just ended).</TE>
<TE>   The Elvis blitz is partly the natural outgrowth of public interest
because of the Aug. 16 anniversary of his death in 1977 at age 42 and
partly a major marketing effort by anyone with something
Elvis-related to sell.</TE>
<TE>   That will translate into new Elvis merchandise and, presumably, a
new round of Elvis jokes from Jay Leno and David Letterman and a new
wave of imitators.</TE>
<TE>   To balance decades of Elvis caricatures, officials at RCA Records
and Elvis Presley Enterprises will be stressing how truly
revolutionary a musical and cultural force Presley was.</TE>
<TE>   They'll be reminding older fans, and educating the millions born
after his death, about a shy boy from Tupelo, Miss., who fused
country, blues and gospel music to become the flashpoint in the birth
of rock 'n' roll half a century ago, and about how he quickly evolved
into a cultural force whose influence touched society at large in
myriad ways.</TE>
<TE>   "For a couple of generations, the image that has unfortunately
stuck in most people's minds is a caricature of the '70s--the
bloated, sweaty Elvis," says RCA General Manager Richard Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's not culturally what has changed the world. We're
working on this television special that's going to highlight that.
It's sort of the six degrees of Elvis: how he affected everything
from gospel and R&amp;B music to fashion and the sexual revolution."</TE>
<TE>   That rejuvenated respect for Presley has involved some
soul-searching at a label that never met an Elvis compilation it
didn't release.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is," Sanders says, "Elvis has been exploited [by the
label] to such a large extent. The Beatles' catalog was cherished and
never thrown out haphazardly. Here, every year there's been some new
type of release....</TE>
<TE>   "What we are trying to do now, since we have trimmed back our
catalog [of Elvis product in print], is to create the definitive
Elvis releases. With the '30 #1 Hits' album, we wanted to make the
one CD to own if you want to know about Elvis."</TE>
<TE>   The Beatles "1" introduced the Fab Four's music to a new
generation, and officials at RCA and the Presley estate are hoping to
do the same for Elvis, not only with the "30" compilation but also
with the exposure his name and memory are getting in "Lilo &amp; Stitch,"
which revolves around a Hawaiian girl who is a huge Elvis fan, and
the single "A Little Less Conversation," a relatively obscure
late-'60s number that was the centerpiece of Nike's $100-million
World Cup ad campaign.</TE>
<TE>   RCA decided this week to add "A Little Less Conversation" to the
"30 #1 Hits" CD as a bonus track; the album's title will not be
changed.</TE>
<TE>   The record marks the first time officials at RCA and Elvis Presley
Enterprises, the Memphis company that manages his estate on behalf of
his daughter and heir, Lisa Marie, agreed to a remix of one of
Presley's recordings. Because of the massive exposure it got during
the World Cup competition, the record has topped the charts in
several European countries, an achievement RCA officials hope to
duplicate stateside.</TE>
<TE>   "Those two events, and the strategies behind them, are part of a
very concerted effort that's part of the setup for the '30 #1 Hits'
collection," says Joe DiMuro, senior vice president of strategic
marketing and business development for BMG Music, RCA's parent.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Walt Disney Co. wanted to license six original Elvis
master recordings" used in "Lilo &amp; Stitch," he says, "that was one
instance of getting to a younger demographic--6- to 12-year-olds--who
would be exposed to Elvis' music with their moms and dads."</TE>
<TE>   DiMuro says everything grows out of BMG's mission statement
regarding Elvis: "to create awareness of why Elvis is relevant today,
not just from a musical standpoint but as an icon.... What he meant
to musicians, and artists outside the music industry.</TE>
<TE>   "The Beatles would not have been the Beatles without Elvis,"
DiMuro says. "He had a huge influence on gospel, country, rock 'n'
roll. Sometimes today's generation forgets that, or maybe they've
never been introduced to it."</TE>
<TE>   Elvis historian and biographer Ernst Jorgensen, who has overseen
Elvis reissues for BMG for a decade, sees something at work on an
even deeper level than societal short-term memory.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of Americans still can't forgive him for the way he
died--or even that he did die," Jorgensen says, alluding to the
prescription drug abuse that contributed to his death from heart
failure.</TE>
<TE>   "So it is hard to get beyond the ridicule, beyond the stories in
the National Enquirer, and get people's attention back to the music
again," Jorgensen says. "That's where boxed sets like these come in.
Even the worst cuts--and not everything on 'Today, Tomorrow &amp;
Forever' is the most fabulous in music history--will make people who
care enough look deeper into it."</TE>

<HD>It's Not Much of a Day for the Independents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The glow from barbecues and sparklers doubles as a signal to TV's
production community that the frantic rush toward the new fall season
is about to begin. Yet the Fourth of July is also time for a less
festive event--namely, my annual rant regarding the fading light
emitted by television's independents.</LD>
<LD>   For while the U.S. celebrates its independence, TV's
independents--from stand-alone producers to local stations--continue
to disappear, swallowed up by the entertainment industry's appetite
for consolidation.</LD>
<LD>   Several producers spent the early 1990s vainly sounding alarms
about this scenario, but the government has nevertheless spent the
last decade stripping away rules that prevented the big from getting
bigger, turning the producer-network game--never an entirely fair
fight to begin with--into the equivalent of Florida State versus
Sister Cecilia's School for Wayward Girls.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, truly entrepreneurial program suppliers have mostly
been transformed into employees, as broadcasters increasingly own and
control the programs they air. Nothing demonstrates this better than
the fact that 27 of 35 new prime-time series scheduled to debut this
fall being produced by an entity with corporate ties to the host
network.</TE>
<TE>   TV stations, meanwhile, are no longer "very independent," as
Southern California's KCOP used to boast in its marketing slogan.
Instead, the prevailing trend is to run two stations with a single
management team, a cash-saving structure that has swept the country,
including the pairings of KCBS-KCAL and KTTV-KCOP.</TE>
<TE>   As nebulous and subjective as creative decision-making and news
judgment are, this erosion of independence does have consequences.
Put simply, it's the difference between mom-and-pop stores and the
local supermarket, between debating what's best for a program with a
potential client and your boss. Granted, people still give their
opinions, but unlike producers of yore who could fight for their
creative vision, right or wrong, the way a lioness protects its cub,
in this jungle you ultimately do the company's bidding.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this dynamic, the handful of conglomerates dominating
media has cleverly helped foster the perception that only cranks,
has-beens and conspiracy theorists care about any of this--abetted by
the understandable reluctance of most show-business folk who still
need regular paychecks to publicly bite the hand that feeds them.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't hurt, either, that the public has never embraced these
issues, exhibiting little interest in who owns what so long as the
channels and choices keep coming--even though the aforementioned
cartel owns most of them, too. An executive once told me that writing
about such matters was itself quixotic, apparently failing to
recognize that anyone who watches this much TV learns to draw
sustenance from hopeless causes.</TE>
<TE>   That said, the Writers Guild of America, Caucus for Television
Producers, Writers &amp; Directors and several prominent former TV
executives have all expressed concern about whether today's media
environment stifles diversity of voices and opinions. And while these
folks may be pining for an era that no longer exists, efforts to
dismiss them obscure the more pertinent debate as to whether the
current system is inequitable.</TE>
<TE>   Some legislators have also started asking that question, with a
trio of U.S. senators recently urging the Federal Communications
Commission to assess the degree to which bulked-up media companies
"discriminate against independent programming" and favor their own.
Another senator proposed a like-minded bill last week designed to
curb excesses in radio.</TE>
<TE>   Barring a staggering shift in federal policy, however, such
pleadings appear unlikely to disrupt the march toward less regulation
by the FCC, which has announced plans to jointly review its TV, cable
and newspaper guidelines and introduce a new scheme next summer.</TE>
<TE>   While some media operators griped about that leisurely timetable
(among them Tribune Co., owner of this newspaper and KTLA, which is
waiting for the commission to formally lift a cross-ownership ban on
newspapers and TV stations in the same city), most assume all that
really does is delay an inevitable further loosening of the
regulatory leash.</TE>
<TE>   What that augurs is hardly in doubt, because media giants haven't
hidden their desire to grow bigger. Radio companies, for example, say
they must acquire more outlets to keep pace with massive Clear
Channel Communications, which owns more than 1,200 U.S. stations and
franchises formats across cities as if they were hamburgers. As Lewis
Dickey--chairman of Cumulus Media, which owns a mere 250 radio
stations--told the New York Times recently, "The one thing we've
learned from Clear Channel is the advantages of size and scale."</TE>
<TE>   In that respect, some growth becomes defensive, a celluloid twist
on the Cold War. AOL Time Warner and Viacom must add to their
holdings, they suggest, to ensure that the Walt Disney Co. and News
Corp. don't launch a first strike.</TE>
<TE>   As for producers hired by these companies, let's just say when
icebergs bump into each other, a little collateral damage to those
clinging to the surface is to be expected.</TE>
<TE>   So consumers' news and entertainment menu will keep expanding, but
more of the items will come from the same kitchen--undermining the
zesty give-and-take between producer and buyer that, at least
theoretically, helps push the cream to the top.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard for the public to grasp how the best things they've
seen, from 'All in the Family' in the 1970s to 'The Cosby Show' in
the 1980s, came about because the producer stood up to network
interference," said independent producer Len Hill, who has been
outspoken on this issue for more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the TV industry's Gullivers appear to be paying much
attention to its Lilliputians. Sure, Hollywood loves waving the flag
to commemorate Independence Day along with everyone else, but when it
comes to honoring independents, that's something else again.</TE>

<LD>   Morissette Sues Owner of Alanis.com Web Site</LD>
<LD>   Following similar action by Madonna, Sting and Julia Roberts,
singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette has taken out a cybersquatting
lawsuit against the operator of Alanis.net, claiming that it sells
various goods without her authorization.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles federal court Monday, claims
that the operator of Alanis.net, Russell Smith, is a "notorious,
repeat-offender cybersquatter" who responded to a lawyer's letter
asking him to shut down his site by demanding $10,000. Smith, the
owner of Consumer.net, could not be reached for comment, but in a
June 11 letter on his Web site, he says he has operated the domain
name for three years "and have never used the name, likeness or
anything else associated with [Morissette]."</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, the Alanis.net site sells goods and
services ranging from candy to tours of Alcatraz Island. Morissette
wants a court order to shut down the site and is asking for
unspecified monetary damages.</TE>
<TE>   Entwistle's Hotel Room Now in Demand</TE>
<TE>   A Las Vegas hotel is rebuffing requests from guests who want to
book the room where the Who bass guitarist John Entwistle died last
week.</TE>
<TE>   "We would prefer that the room number never get publicly
identified, out of respect for John Entwistle and the band," Don
Marrandino, Hard Rock president and chief operating officer, said in
a statement released Tuesday through a spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Entwistle was found dead Thursday of an apparent heart attack. The
Hard Rock left the room vacant over the weekend before making it
available for occupancy Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to treat it with dignity and respect," Marrandino told
the Las Vegas Review-Journal. "We're not going to put a plaque up
there or anything else. I think a room a guy dies in is not a
positive marketing opportunity."</TE>

<TE>   Smoking Diva Keeps Singing Despite Flames</TE>
<TE>   Soprano Susan Chilcott escaped unharmed Saturday after her dress
caught fire onstage at London's Royal Opera House.</TE>
<TE>   The singer was performing in Tchaikovsky's "The Queen of Spades"
when a candle set her train on fire. Members of the audience shouted
at her but Chilcott carried on with her aria, unaware of the danger.
A staff member and fire officer then ran on stage and put out the
blaze with a fire extinguisher.</TE>
<TE>   The source of the blaze was a candle used by the character Hermann
to burn a love letter. The cast reportedly carried on with Saturday's
show with barely a pause, although laughter erupted from the audience
when the performance resumed with the supertitle "We are safe now."</TE>
<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   Academy Votes to Change Awards</TE>
<TE>   The board of governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences voted to revamp the procedure for giving out the Irving G.
Thalberg Award, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and the Honorary
Award, academy representative John Pavlik disclosed Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The move was made in an attempt to limit the number of honorees
each year to one or two.</TE>
<TE>   The academy also simplified category titles for writing awards.
The "screenplay based on material previously produced or published"
award will be known as the "adapted screenplay" category. And
"original screenplay" replaces the "screenplay written directly for
the screen" category.</TE>
<TE>   Three other rules changes were announced: Scientific and technical
awards can now be given for devices or inventions used in the
industry before as well as during the awards year; short
documentaries that are reedited from earlier feature-length
documentaries will not be eligible for Oscars, and no more than three
producers will be allowed credit as nominees for best picture awards.</TE>

<TE>   MTV Preps New Series Following Osbourne Hit</TE>
<TE>   Looking to cash in on the success of "The Osbournes," MTV is
preparing a half-dozen new series and specials for next season,
several of which focus on providing behind-the-scenes access to bands
or offering a chance at instant fame.</TE>
<TE>   The projects include "Crashing With ... ," in which a touring band
or artist forgoes a hotel and spends the night with local residents;
"mtvTreatment," which, after a screening process, will follow a
first-time director through the making of a Korn video;
"artistLaunch," a series of specials documenting the production of an
album by various top acts; and "FM Nation," which will record various
groups of young adults as they drive around on a Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "The Osbournes," which will also return next season, helped propel
the cable network to record ratings during the spring.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Robert Cutietta has been named dean of the USC Thornton School of
Music.... A settlement was reached Tuesday in a lawsuit brought by
Jennifer Aniston against Man's World Publications Inc. and Crescent

settlement were not released.... "Hot Tamales Live,'' the variety
show hosted by Christian "Kiki" Melendez at the Hollywood Improv on
Wednesdays, is going to home video and DVD and will be released this
summer.... Angela Bettis will star as an alienated teenager with
telekinetic powers in NBC's new three-hour version of the Stephen
King classic "Carrie." The remake of the 1976 film, set to air in the
fall, will feature scenes from the novel that didn't appear in the
original movie.</TE>

<HD>MOCA Feels a Squeeze</HD>
<DH>Art* Despite the success of the Warhol exhibition, the
museum is dealing with financial setbacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Museum of Contemporary Art is staging what is expected to be its
best-attended exhibition ever--"Andy Warhol Retrospective," a
$3-million extravaganza that has drawn 72,000 visitors during the
first five weeks of a 12-week run and, due to sponsorship fees and a
donation from the city, is already in the black. But at the same
time, leaders of the museum are dealing with financial setbacks.</LD>
<LD>   The particular challenge at MOCA is that $6.9 million of a
$10-million promised donation has been delayed and may never be paid.
The museum has not identified the patron, and its 2001 annual report
merely states that "the collectibility of [the remaining $6.9 million
of] a donor's pledge was uncertain." But a recent article in the Los
Angeles Business Journal identifies the donor as MOCA trustee Dallas
Price.</LD>
<LD>   Price, who is co-owner with her ex-husband, golf course magnate
David Price, of American Golf Corp. in Santa Monica, pledged $10
million to the museum in early 2000. The gift, to be made in annual
installments and used for operations and endowment, was the single
largest donation in the museum's history.</LD>
<TE>   Price made initial payments, but in 2001 she reportedly notified
the museum that she could not make additional payments until the golf
company recovered from its severe financial slump. Like other
companies in the industry, American Golf Corp. has suffered a
substantial loss of business amid a weakening economy and a glut of
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Price, who continues to serve as a trustee, could not be reached
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Wiant, the museum's chief financial officer, confirmed that
the donor's total pledge had not been received on schedule. Because
of that shortfall, in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2001, the
museum's total income dropped $6 million from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   The museum has not yet finalized its books for the 2001-'02 fiscal
year. But Wiant says that the financial picture isn't as bleak as it
might appear.</TE>
<TE>   "In most categories, our income has been going up," he said.
"Membership [fees] in the lower levels went from a total of $830,000
to $1.2 million, mostly because of the Warhol exhibition but also
because of the David Hockney show, which started off this past fiscal
year and did extremely well. We were already doing pretty well, and
Warhol has just helped us."</TE>
<TE>   In response to the loss of expected installments of the pledge,
the museum cut $2 million out of its $15-million operating budget for
the 2001-2002 fiscal year, which just ended, by not filling several
positions and cutting costs across the board, Wiant said. "After
Sept. 11, everybody had to reevaluate. Many corporate sponsors backed
away from supporting cultural institutions. But when the opportunity
for the Warhol exhibition arose, we added about $3 million to the
[operating] budget, which will be about $16 million--including
Warhol--for the [fiscal] year just ending."</TE>
<TE>   The staff and trustees "are very carefully looking at the next few
years to see where we are going to go." Wiant said. "In the meantime,
the stock market has continued to have difficulties. That affects
everyone."</TE>
<TE>   MOCA director Jeremy Strick agreed that the museum is "dealing
with a very difficult climate," but said the institution is making
substantial progress. "In a difficult period for all institutions, we
have consistently been raising our level of contributed and earned
income and brought our budget down from 2001. When you combine the
reduced costs with higher income, you are definitely on the right
track."</TE>

<HD>No Hands and No Feet, but 'Powerpuff Girls' Have Plenty of
Wit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GENE SEYMOUR</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a time, just as American skies were being cluttered with TV
signals, there was a cartoon factory called United Productions of
America. UPA, as it was known, made hip little films such as "Gerald
McBoing Boing" that taught generations of animators they needn't get
fancy to make cartoons that were smart enough for adults without
going over children's heads.</LD>
<LD>   Now what, you may ask, does this have to do with "The Powerpuff
Girls Movie," a big-screen treatment of a popular TV animated series
for kids? A couple of things: The first is that "Powerpuff Girls" and
other animated series hatched on cable TV's Cartoon Network wouldn't
have existed without the example set by UPA way back in the 1940s and
1950s.</LD>
<LD>   And it seems like too long a time since there's been a big-screen
animated feature for kids that had the jazzy design and cheeky wit of
those long-ago UPA shorts. "The Powerpuff Girls Movie" has the fizzy
tang of a vintage pop beverage whose taste we'd forgotten.</LD>
<TE>   If this movie were a comic book, it would be called "Powerpuff
Girls: The Origin Issue." For faithful viewers of the series, this
means a fleshed-out--no, check that--more detailed version of how
Professor Utonium (voice by Tom Kane), depressed by the crime and
malaise shrouding the city of Townsville, decided to create the
Perfect Little Girl from--what else?--sugar, spice and everything
nice. A rambunctious lab monkey causes Chemical X to spill into the
blend, causing a huge explosion.</TE>
<TE>   In its wake, three saucer-eyed little angels with no hands and no
feet stare at the professor like baby chicks gazing at their mother.
Blossom (Cathy Cavadini) is the pretty-in-pink forthright one.
Bubbles (Tara Strong) is the baby-blue cuddlebug. Blossom (Elizabeth
Daily) wears green and, judging from her pugnacity, accounts for most
of the spice. All three have superpowers that, at first, get them and
their creator-guardian in deep trouble within Townsville.</TE>
<TE>   Their troubles are just starting. The aforementioned explosion
also affected that aforementioned lab monkey, his brains bloated to
diabolically intelligent proportions. Forgotten by the professor, the
monkey, now known as Mojo Jojo (Roger L. Jackson), cons the girls
into helping him with a plan to empower his fellow apes with big
brains and malevolent intentions. Even those who can guess how it all
turns out get caught up in writer-director Craig McCracken's story of
redemption.</TE>
<TE>   Advance Powerpuffs knowledge may help get in the groove, but
either way, "The Powerpuff Girls Movie" has the right mix of sugar
and spice for a satisfying rush.</TE>

<HD>The Flatlanders Have a Charitable Fan</HD>
<DH>Radio* Don Imus says he'll donate $10,000 if any station in
a big market plays any of their new singles regularly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Syndicated radio talk show host Don Imus has issued a provocative
challenge to country radio stations: Put any song from the new album
by Texas alternative-country band the Flatlanders into their top 10
rotation and he'll donate $10,000 to charity.</LD>
<LD>   The flamboyant commentator became a fan of the group, consisting
of veteran singer-songwriters Joe Ely, Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Butch
Hancock, when he interviewed them on his show last month, then put
out the challenge Friday when he was a guest on CNN's "Larry King
Live."</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very serious about this," Imus told King. "The first country
station in any top 10 market--you know, L.A., Cleveland, Chicago, New
York--that reports to Radio &amp; Records or Billboard that they have any
single from the Flatlanders' ["Now Again"] album on their top 10,
I'll donate $10,000 to that radio station's favorite charity or the
music director's charity or whatever they want to do."</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the band, which has gathered critical accolades
but little airplay on mainstream country radio for "Now Again," said
Tuesday: "They're absolutely ecstatic. They were thrilled to be on
his show, but Don has gone above and beyond the call of duty.
Everybody in this camp is stunned."</TE>
<TE>   It has surprised some radio industry veterans too.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't recall ever hearing of anything like this happening
before," says Lon Helton, country music editor for Radio &amp; Records, a
trade publication.</TE>
<TE>   Helton said he was unaware of any top 10 market stations
immediately picking up on Imus' offer. But R.J. Curtis, operations
manager at Los Angeles country station KZLA-FM (93.9), said,
"Obviously, something like this gets your attention."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a pretty bold thing to do," Curtis said. "I'll certainly go
find the album. Ultimately, I don't know if it will kill us to play a
track or two. It's the listeners' station--why not let them decide?
I'm sure any local charity could use $10,000."</TE>
<TE>   As of Tuesday, R&amp;R's data showed five tracks from the Flatlanders'
album being played on different stations, but none in top 10 markets.
Because New York currently has no station with a country format,
there are only nine stations that would meet Imus' requirement that
it be in a top 10 radio market, Helton said, adding that a station
would need to play a song between 30 and 40 times per week to place
it in top 10 rotation.</TE>
<TE>   Imus, whose show also is carried on cable TV channel MSNBC, is on
vacation this week and could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Flatlanders spokesman Mark Pucci said that at one point over the
weekend, after the exposure on King, the Flatlanders album got as
high as No. 2 on Amazon.com's ranking of all albums it sells. On
Tuesday, it was at No. 25 on that list. It has sold 19,000 copies
since its May 21 release, according to Nielsen SoundScan.</TE>
<TE>   "Now Again" is only the group's second album in 30 years. After
its first in 1972, which developed near mythical status among
alt-country music fans, Ely, Hancock and Gilmore split to pursue solo
careers. They've remained close, often recording each other's songs
on their individual albums, and reunited last year for a brief
Flatlanders tour, during which they decided to collaborate on another
album.</TE>
<TE>   They played the Troubadour in West Hollywood on Tuesday and appear
at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano tonight.</TE>

<HD>Lassie's Message for Scooby-Doo: Get Real</HD>
<DH>Television* Canine film heroes from the old days showed a
depth of talent beyond the scope of graphics. Now a film festival
honors them.</DH>

<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The most popular movie dog of the summer, Scooby-Doo, isn't even the
real deal.</LD>
<LD>   He's just a computer-generated figment of animators' imagination
that can't hold a bowl of kibble to famous celluloid dogs of the past
like Pal, Terry, Skippy and Romney--four-pawed thespians who stole
scenes from some of film's biggest stars during Hollywood's Golden
Age, including Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn, Judy Garland,
William Powell and Myrna Loy.</LD>
<LD>   Every Wednesday this month, Turner Classic Movies will throw the
spotlight on these canine heroes in a 28-film festival, "Dog Days of
Summer."</LD>
<TE>   The celebration kicks off tonight with a seven-film "Lassie"
marathon starring the superstar of the canine performers, Pal, a
North Hollywood-born collie who had a habit of chasing motorcycles.</TE>
<TE>   In between films are "dog bites," featuring information on various
film pooches, plus recollections from actors who worked with them.</TE>
<TE>   "Pal was an amazing dog," says Tom Brown, vice president of
program production for TCM and a Scottie aficionado. "The thing we
found out in researching Pal's life is that he was the chorus girl
who made good, even though Pal was a boy."</TE>
<TE>   Pal starred in all seven "Lassie" movies during the 1940s and
early 1950s, as well as the 1940s radio series and 1954 pilot episode
of the "Lassie" TV series, but he wasn't the first choice to play the
courageous female collie in the 1943 classic that started the
franchise, "Lassie Come Home."</TE>
<TE>   "He was a great dog all the way around," says trainer Bob
Weatherwax, the son of Pal's trainer, Rudd Weatherwax. "All the
Lassies have been great dogs, but this was a particularly great dog
in the sense that he was very physical and almost was never doubled."</TE>
<TE>   MGM, he recalls, had hired a prize female collie to star in
"Lassie Come Home." Though his father was one of the top dog trainers
in Hollywood, the studio hired another trainer who had very little
movie experience.</TE>
<TE>   To be on the safe side, the movie's production manager hired Rudd
Weatherwax and Pal to double "in case this dog failed to perform in
certain scenes." Soon after production began, Pal got his big break
when the star collie refused to swim in a river.</TE>
<TE>   Not only had Weatherwax trained Pal to swim, he choreographed the
whole sequence to show off Pal's acting abilities.</TE>
<TE>   "When Pal swam the river, when he came out the other side, my
father had him collapse and crawl and get on his side and struggle.
The director, Freddy Wilcox, got up and said, 'Well, Pal swam in and
Lassie swam out.' "</TE>
<TE>   Pal also went on extensive press tours to promote his films,
visiting children's groups and veterans of World War II. "Lassie
became an icon of America to the returning troops," Brown says.</TE>
<TE>   A veritable Laurence Olivier of the dog set, Pal retired at 14 and
died at the ripe old age of 18 in 1958. "I have my new Lassie, No.
9," says Weatherwax. "I just retired my eighth-generation Lassie.
They are all descendants of the original collie."</TE>
<TE>   Almost as famous as Pal was Terry, the female Cairn terrier who
played Dorothy's male dog, Toto, in "The Wizard of Oz."</TE>
<TE>   Terry will be profiled during the festival, and although "Wizard"
won't be screened during the celebration, TCM is airing the 1939 Judy
Garland classic on Thursdayand Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Terry also had a long healthy career at MGM, making 12 movies
before she retired in 1942. Her original owner had left Terry with
Carl Spitz, who owned a Hollywood dog-training academy, and never
returned. The poor dog was so shy she wouldn't come out from under
the bed for several weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Although she was a seasoned veteran by the time she got the role
in "The Wizard of Oz," she was fearful of the wind machines in the
movie. During production, one of the witch's soldiers stepped on her
and sprained her ankle. Terry was out of commission for a few weeks
and Spitz had to rush to find a replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Romney, a descendant of Terry's, was considered one of the best
animal actors in Hollywood and starred in such films as "Without
Love" with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn and "George Washington
Slept Here" with Jack Benny.</TE>
<TE>   Motivated by a Mouse</TE>
<TE>   On July 10, TCM will honor famous crime-movie dogs, including
Skippy, who played Nick and Nora Charles' sophisticated wire-haired
fox terrier, Asta, in "The Thin Man" and "After the Thin Man."</TE>
<TE>   Skippy, whose trainer used a squeaky mouse toy as motivation, also
starred as the irrepressible Mr. Smith in the 1937 screwball comedy,
"The Awful Truth."</TE>
<TE>   Famous crime-movie dogs are featured in such films as "Behave
Yourself," which starred a mutt named Archie whom costar Shelley
Winters swore was so good that he must have studied with coach Lee
Strasberg at the Actors Studio in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Weatherwax is convinced that computer-assisted graphics dogs like
Scooby-Doo will never replace real dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it will ever work because they are not a living,
breathing entity," says Weatherwax.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot take that dog out like I do with Lassie to hospitals
and let people see them. Also, you cannot advertise product with that
dog because he does not eat products. He doesn't wear flea collars!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Dog Days of Summer" festival begins tonight at 5 on TCM with
"Lassie Come Home," followed by "Son of Lassie" at 7; "Courage of
Lassie" at 9; "Hills of Home" at 11 p.m.; "The Sun Comes Up" at 1
a.m. on July 4; "Challenge of Lassie" at 3 a.m.; and "The Painted
Hills" at 4:30 a.m. The festival continues every Wednesday through
July 31.</TE>

<HD>'Mike' Scores With Humor and Action</HD>
<DH>The heartwarming film sets a classic father-son story on a
fast-paced basketball court. Both elements work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Like Mike" is a sure-fire heart-warmer: lively, funny yet
emotion-charged and uplifting.</LD>
<LD>   This family-friendly movie, about a little kid who ends up a star
on an NBA team, soars above so many sports comedies because director
John Schultz and writers Michael Elliot and Jordan Moffet aim as high
as the basketball hoops that figure so importantly in their story.</LD>
<LD>   They consistently set off the fast-moving fantasy action on a
basketball court with the reality of a father-son relationship that
develops in tentative fits and starts and no small amount of anguish,
even given considerable humor.</LD>
<TE>   The youngest solo rap star to ever hit the top of the charts, Lil'
Bow Wow (who recently dropped the Lil') makes a terrific film debut
opposite Morris Chestnut, who gives a wonderfully nuanced performance
as the star player of the Los Angeles Knights. He's a suave ladies'
man who makes no secret of his reluctance to mentor a pint-sized
13-year-old basketball whiz who, worse yet, outshines him on the
court.</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers take pains to set up their premise before running
with it. Lil' Bow Wow's Calvin Cambridge lives in an orphanage
(gulp), a somewhat rundown turn-of-the-last-century mansion not far
from Staples Center, where the Knights are doing so poorly that
announcer Frank Bernard (Eugene Levy), as a promotional gimmick,
holds raffles in which the lucky ticket-holder gets to go one on one
with Chestnut's Tracey Reynolds.</TE>
<TE>   The Knights' kindly Coach Wagner (Robert Forster) has given Calvin
some free tickets and, sure enough, he's the lucky winner.</TE>
<TE>   Much to Calvin's and Tracey's astonishment, the 4-foot, 8-inch boy
trounces the basketball star, for Calvin happens to be wearing
magical sneakers. (How and why they got that way is too inspired to
be revealed here.)</TE>
<TE>   The Knights promptly sign up Calvin, seeing him as their
salvation, and Tracey is ordered to be his roommate. That the boy
might cramp his style as a playboy is but the tip of the iceberg:
Having rejected his own father, he resents Calvin's open craving for
a dad. When Tracey starts to develop paternal feelings despite much
resistance for this brash kid, he has no idea how to be a father.
Tracey's journey within himself and with Calvin takes the film to an
entirely new and serious level.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the filmmakers have the wisdom to realize that
magic seems inevitably to wear off; that moment happens when Calvin
discovers not only the full meaning of what it means to be a team
player but also that receiving involves giving. "Like Mike" earns the
warm feelings it elicits as fully as it does its many laughs.</TE>
<TE>   The film surrounds its stars with lots of fine actors. Crispin
Glover's orphanage administrator seems a perfectly decent fellow,
until he smells big bucks in Calvin; Anne Meara is funny as Calvin's
doughty no-nonsense tutor Sister Theresa; and stunning Sandra Prosper
has a delightfully well-played scene as Tracey's date, distracted by
her maternal concern for Calvin.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out a very large cast are 18 NBA players and about half a
dozen prominent sportscasters playing themselves. A well-crafted film
carefully thought-out in all its aspects, "Like Mike" may well
deliver audiences a richer experience than they had anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

suitable for all ages.</TE>

<LD>The next time you flush the toilet, flip a light switch or take a
spin in your SUV, you might just give a silent note of thanks to the
beautiful minds and iron-clad resolve of the people responsible for
making it all possible across this great land of ours.</LD>
<LD>   OK, now back to reality. We've been taking the modern miracles of
infrastructure for granted for far too long to expect anyone to give
it much thought now, but PBS' four-part series, "Great Projects: The
Building of America," aims to rectify that. And the good news is that
the back stories of the taming of wild rivers, the hot-wiring of
sprawling cities and the complexities of bridge and road challenges
turn out to be a painless and frequently fascinating series of
history lessons.</LD>
<TE>   The first of the hourlong specials, "A Tale of Two Rivers" (at 10
tonight on KCET, KVCR), dishes some dirt along with the details of
how engineers struggled to harness the Colorado (for water and power)
and the Mississippi (for flood control). The Colorado's solution, the
building of Hoover Dam, is a neater package for TV purposes, and the
head-butting between President Herbert Hoover and his successor,
Franklin D. Roosevelt, provides some juicy tidbits. Did you know that
the initials HD, for Hoover Dam, had to be blasted off the face of
the structure after FDR took over in 1932? It was known as Boulder
Dam until an act of Congress restored its original name 15 years
later, which Hoover, who had campaigned under the slogan "The Great
Engineer," lived to see.</TE>
<TE>   The project also provided thousands of desperately needed jobs for
a country in the throes of the Great Depression. Recalls the widow of
one of the workers: "Everybody that hadn't committed suicide was
trying to get a job."</TE>
<TE>   Next Wednesday, the U.S. gets plugged in on "Electric Nation."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like the men whose lives they chronicle, members of an oh-so-secret
government organization that polices and monitors alien activity on
Earth, the creators of "Men in Black II" knew their challenge was
great: how to come up with a sequel to one of the thoroughly
enjoyable summer comedies of recent years, a film that was not only
smart and funny but also pretty much of a surprise, an enterprise no
one expected to be as clever as it turned out to be.</LD>
<LD>   It sounds like Mission: Impossible and, regrettably, it is.</LD>
<LD>   For despite the expenditure of what was clearly a lot of effort,
not to mention a whole lot of money, the new "Men in Black" is a
disappointment. A good-faith attempt has been made to duplicate the
original elements, but the mix is wrong, bearings have been lost, the
balance is off. It was attitude that made "Men in Black" special, a
particular kind of cool insouciance that has proved as impossible to
duplicate as it was irresistible to experience.</LD>
<TE>   Not that people didn't try. Back from the original are director
Barry Sonnenfeld and stars Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as agents
Jay and Kay, the best the planet has to offer. Missing in action,
sadly, is the original credited writer, Ed Solomon. It may have been
his touch, or it may have been the freshness of seeing Lowell
Cunningham's comic-book concept for the first time, but this film's
Robert Gordon and Barry Fanaro script plays like the thrill is gone.</TE>
<TE>   From the opening segment, a spoof of everything from TV's
"Unsolved Mysteries" through Ed Wood's "Plan 9 From Outer Space," the
humor here seems too self-aware, too conscious of how hip the first
one was and too needy in its attempts to duplicate it.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Episode 27 of "Mysteries in History" hosted by Peter Graves
does lay out plot points that turn out to be crucial. It seems that
25 years ago a group of Kylothians came to Earth in an attempt to
hide a mysterious and valuable light from the truly evil Serleena.
Following Earth's policy of noninvolvement, the Men in Black said the
light could not stay, and there, or so everyone thought, the matter
ended.</TE>
<TE>   But wait a minute. Isn't that Serleena, cleverly disguised as a
Victoria's Secret lingerie model (Lara Flynn Boyle), back on Earth
after a quarter of a century? She seems to think the light never left
the planet and is even more determined to get her hands, uh,
tentacles, on it.</TE>
<TE>   The only MIB operative who knows the true story, agent Kay, the
legendary go-to guy, was neutralized at the end of the last film and
now works in quiet, memory-less desperation as the postmaster of
Truro, Mass. Clearly, Jay has to help Kay get back to speed if Earth
is to have any hope of surviving.</TE>
<TE>   This is "Men in Black II's" minimal plot, and that is one reason
why the film is so short, a mere 88 minutes, including an especially
long credit roll. Even with that, the story is not without its share
of dead spots, and when those happen, the film sends in the aliens.</TE>
<TE>   More than the original, more even than an episode of "Star Wars,"
"Men in Black II" is chockablock with an endless array of misshapen
aliens, often as not fully equipped with a nasty row of teeth. When
you throw in Serleena, prone to changing into a grotesque
all-tentacle form, this film has a higher yuck factor than it should.
Director Sonnenfeld has been overly enamored of special effects
before ("Wild, Wild West," anyone?), and it is not a pleasant sight.</TE>
<TE>   Hovering over the film like the guardian angel it needs is Smith
as the hippest dude in town. Smith is not even close to tired of his
agent role, and the interest and charisma he brings to it counteracts
not-so-bright ideas like giving Frank the talking pug more screen
time than he can effectively handle.</TE>
<TE>   "Men in Black's" best idea is bringing on Rosario Dawson as Laura,
a love interest for the good agent. An actress who's been in
everything from "Kids" to "Josie and the Pussycats," Dawson brings a
warm and welcome human touch to a film that has been needing it all
along.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for sci-fi action violence, some provocative
humor. Times guidelines: Some grotesque characters that could
frighten younger audiences.</TE>

<CX>   "Men in Black II"--The review of "Men in Black II" in Wednesday's
Calendar mistakenly said that Tommy Lee Jones' character had been
"neutralized" instead of "neuralized," a process that erases memory.</CX>

<HD>Top 10 Has Newsy Look for Summer</HD>

<LD>The newsmagazines are mounting their usual summer ascent as an
alternative to network reruns--with four ranking among last week's
Top 10--while unscripted programs continue to offer a mixed bag
ratings-wise, based on viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen
Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Programmers are also seeing the value of self-contained (as
opposed to serialized) dramas, as the procedural crime shows "CSI:
Crime Scene Investigation" and NBC's three versions of "Law &amp; Order"
continue to repeat better than series such as "ER" and "The
Practice."</LD>
<LD>   The fourth edition of the "Law &amp; Order" franchise, the unscripted
"Crime &amp; Punishment," is also performing reasonably well, as is NBC's
"Dog Eat Dog."</LD>
<TE>   Fox's talent search, "American Idol," meanwhile, cooled for the
second straight week, and ratings have been so-so for ABC's "State
v." and "Houston Medical."</TE>
<TE>   NBC's lineup included a seven-episode "Scrubs" marathon, with the
first-year comedy not surprisingly faring best in the Thursday slot
it will occupy this fall, dropping a respectable 16% off its
"Friends" lead-in audience. Although CBS was first overall, NBC has
maintained the lead in attracting adults under 50--the key figure to
youth-happy advertisers--for 14 consecutive weeks.</TE>

<TE>   National Nielsen Viewership</TE>
<TE>   Here are the rankings for national prime-time network television
last week (June 24-30) as compiled by Nielsen Media Research. They
are based on the average number of people who watched a program from
start to finish. Nielsen estimates there are 269 million potential
viewers in the U.S. age 2 and older. Viewership is listed in
millions.</TE>

<LD>Shipping lines and dockworkers have agreed to extend their contract
on a day-to-day basis as negotiations covering workers at West Coast
ports continue, minimizing the risk of labor disruptions.</LD>
<LD>   The three-year contract had been due to expire Monday. Retailers
who depend on shipments from Asia at this time of year for
back-to-school and holiday supplies have been closely monitoring the
talks and viewed the continued negotiations as a positive sign.</LD>
<LD>   Talks between the International Warehouse and Longshore Union and
the Pacific Maritime Assn. are focused primarily on health benefits
and technology upgrades that could cut jobs.</LD>

against Rexall Sundown Inc. over Rexall's Metab-o-lite diet pills.
Metabolife, a closely held company based in San Diego, says Rexall
Sundown has used a "virtually identical" name and packaging to
piggyback on "millions of dollars" in nationwide advertisements for
Metabolife products. Boca Raton, Fla.-based Rexall Sundown is a unit

<LD>A judge dismissed Federal Trade Commission charges that
Schering-Plough Corp. and Upsher-Smith Laboratories Inc. colluded to
set prices for a blood pressure drug.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by an FTC administrative law judge is a defeat for
the FTC's concerted push against what it sees as a pattern of
anti-competitive practices within the drug industry that is keeping
cheap generics off the market.</LD>
<LD>   The FTC had alleged that Schering-Plough, the maker of K-Dur 20,
illegally paid pharmaceutical firms millions of dollars to induce
them to delay launching generic versions of the drug.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Schering-Plough fell $1.14 to $22.36 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission's audit-independence case
against Ernst &amp; Young was dismissed by an administrative law judge
who said the SEC's one-member vote violated federal rules.</LD>
<LD>   Commissioner Isaac Hunt was the only SEC member who voted,
charging Ernst &amp; Young with violating independence rules in its
audits of PeopleSoft Inc. SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt and
Commissioner Cynthia Glassman, who have past ties to the
fourth-largest accounting firm, recused themselves. Two other SEC
seats are vacant.</LD>
<LD>   The dismissal puts a spotlight on delays by the White House and
the Senate in approving SEC nominations.</LD>

<LD>The accounting practices of the nation's five largest music
corporations will come under scrutiny during a July 23 hearing by the
California Senate.</LD>
<LD>   State legislators are reviewing the contracts of recording artists
and intend to probe allegations by music acts that record firms
consistently cheat them out of royalty payments.</LD>
<LD>   The hearing was announced Tuesday by Sen. Martha Escutia
(D-Whittier), chairwoman of the Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Kevin
Murray (D-Culver City), chairman of the Select Committee on the
Entertainment Industry.</LD>
<TE>   "Recording artists should not have to sue for what is rightfully
theirs," Escutia said. "Yet, unfortunately, that is the case for many
artists."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>EchoStar Communications Corp. said it would fight U.S. regulators'
cancellation of its license to sell Internet access, data and
telephone service using new frequencies.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Communications Commission revoked EchoStar's right to
sell service in the Ka band, a high-frequency range not yet used
commercially. EchoStar failed to ensure a satellite it's building
will work in the Ka band, the FCC said.</LD>
<LD>   EchoStar said it already has spent $75 million on the satellite,
planned for launch this year. The FCC decision was based on the
misunderstanding that construction hadn't begun, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   EchoStar shares fell 3 cents to $16.51 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nike Inc. sued Minnesota Vikings quarterback Daunte Culpepper,
claiming that he breached a contract by signing with rival Reebok
International Ltd. without allowing Nike to match the offer.</LD>
<LD>   Culpepper signed a one-year agreement with Nike in July 2000 that
the biggest apparel maker said gave it the right to match any offer
by a competitor, according to the complaint, filed in U.S. District
Court in Oregon. Culpepper verbally agreed in October 2001 to re-sign
with Nike but hasn't completed the agreement, the complaint said.</LD>
<LD>   Neither Culpepper's agent nor Reebok returned phone calls seeking
comment.</LD>

<LD>DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. won an
appeal barring a judge from hearing asbestos cases against them.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals said U.S. District Judge
Samuel B. Kent demonstrated his bias against the companies in a
letter he wrote protesting their attempts to shift the asbestos
health claims to a bankruptcy court in Delaware.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, which also reverses Kent's order for sanctions
against the car makers, may delay resolution of some of the
20,000-plus asbestos suits against the companies.</LD>

<LD>Sultry weather throughout the United States kept sales at retail
stores clipping along in June even as results were mixed in the
latest week, suggesting that consumer spending is not withering
during the summer, two reports said.</LD>
<LD>   Instinet Research said its Redbook Retail Sales Average rose 1.8%
in four of the five weeks of June from the same period last year.</LD>
<LD>   And though another measure from Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UBS
Warburg showed sales slipped 0.9% for the week ended June 29 compared
with the previous week, the drop came after three weeks of strong
gains.</LD>

<HD>EDS Cuts 2,000 Workers to Match Contracts</HD>
<DH>Tech: The company says the layoffs are not related to its
work for WorldCom. The firm's stock continues to slide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Electronic Data Systems Corp. said Tuesday that it has laid off 2,000
workers, or 1.4% of its work force, saying the cuts were needed to
balance its employment levels with ongoing contracts.</LD>
<LD>   EDS, which has 140,000 employees worldwide, said most of the cuts
were in North America. It said it periodically hires or fires workers
to match them with available work.</LD>
<LD>   The computer services company denied that the cuts were related to
its work for troubled telecommunications company WorldCom Inc.</LD>
<TE>   EDS has an 11-year contract with WorldCom signed in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The layoffs were announced as EDS moved to stop a slide in its
stock that has erased about $9 billion of shareholder value in the
last week.</TE>
<TE>   EDS Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Brown defended the
company's accounting practices and said that even if WorldCom went
out of business, the effect on EDS would be minimal.</TE>
<TE>   Investors apparently were not soothed. After taking EDS' stock
down 36% in the last week, the shares lost an additional 33 cents, or
1.1%, to $30.12 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Plano, Texas-based EDS earned about $600 million from the WorldCom
contract last year, or about 2.5% of its revenue.</TE>

<HD>Accounting Fears Sink Cardinal Shares</HD>
<DH>Stocks: The company blames a misunderstanding about its
former auditor Andersen for the plunge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street's high anxiety over corporate accounting scandals led to
wild selling of drug wholesaler Cardinal Health Inc.'s shares
Tuesday, sending them down as much as 18% in an apparent
misunderstanding about certification of the firm's results since
1999.</LD>
<LD>   Dublin, Ohio-based Cardinal said it couldn't get former auditor
Arthur Andersen to sign off on the company's financial statements
from 1999 through 2001. But Cardinal said the delay is due to
staffing problems at Andersen, not problems with Cardinal's numbers.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen, Enron Corp.'s former auditor, was convicted in June of
obstructing a U.S. investigation of Enron's collapse and will stop
auditing public companies by the end of August.</LD>
<TE>   "After reasonable efforts, we have been unable to obtain
Andersen's consent" regarding already audited financial statements,
Cardinal said in a regulatory filing.</TE>
<TE>   The wording in the filing triggered a plunge in the firm's shares
early in the day, to as low as $46.80. The stock recovered most of
the loss after the company clarified the problem. The shares finished
down $2.89 to $54.41 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "The Securities and Exchange Commission has provided boilerplate
language for former Arthur Andersen clients to use, so we
incorporated that language verbatim" in the filing, said Anthony
Rucci, chief administrative officer at Cardinal. "This is not about
us; we've been given clear audits on all these previous years."</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal has hired Ernst &amp; Young to replace Andersen.</TE>

<HD>Ford Sued Over Gas-Tank Design</HD>
<DH>Autos: Texas officials accuse the car maker of hiding a
safety defect in its Crown Victoria police cruisers. The company says
the vehicles are safe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. on Tuesday was hit with a class-action suit in Texas,
where county officials are pressing for immediate safety improvements
to the fuel systems of an estimated 25,000 Crown Victoria police
cruisers owned by law enforcement agencies throughout the state.</LD>
<LD>   The suit accused Ford of hiding a safety defect, adding fuel to a
growing controversy over whether the location of the gas tanks in the
cruisers--behind the rear axle--makes them unusually susceptible to
fires in vehicle wrecks. At least a dozen officers reportedly have
been killed and several others have suffered severe burns in fiery
wrecks of the cruisers since 1992.</LD>
<LD>   "As a result of this class action, we believe Ford can no longer
ignore cries of the widows and children of police officers killed in
survivable collisions, in which inadequately protected fuel tanks
ruptured and exploded," said plaintiffs lawyer David Perry, who also
has sued Ford on behalf of individual burn victims.</LD>
<TE>   Ford officials said they had not seen the lawsuit and could not
comment, except to repeat their contention that the vehicles are
safe.</TE>
<TE>   The suit was filed in Corpus Christi by Nueces County, which owns
106 of the cruisers, and is seeking to represent hundreds of other
Texas police and sheriffs departments. A similar case filed in New
Jersey seeks certification of a nationwide class of law enforcement
agencies that operate the cruisers, about 400,000 of which are
currently in use.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs and other critics say the fuel systems' poor design has
resulted in officers burning to death who would have otherwise been
protected by the hefty Crown Vics. There have been at least a dozen
police deaths reported in public documents and news articles, but
it's uncertain if the officers all burned to death or if some were
killed on impact.</TE>
<TE>   Ford says the gas tank fires have been extremely rare, and the
result of violent, high-speed collisions that no fuel systems can be
expected to withstand.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Ford has acknowledged in court papers that it sought
to fortify the tank, beginning with the 1998 model year, by
increasing the thickness of the metal in the rear half of the tank by
about 20%.</TE>
<TE>   The change, which has not been publicized previously, was
acknowledged by Ford in a pair of lawsuits stemming from the deaths
of Florida state trooper Robert Smith in 1997 and Louisiana state
trooper Hung Le in 1998. Both were rear-ended in 1996 Crown Victoria
cruisers.</TE>
<TE>   In response to written queries from lawyers for families of the
officers, Ford said it increased the thickness of the rear half of
the tanks from 0.75 millimeters to 0.91 millimeters. The change
required a tooling cost of $28,000 plus $1.20 per vehicle, according
to Ford, which said the change was intended, in part, "to increase
[the tank's] overall robustness."</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is they put the tank in a bad position," and the
thinner tank also made it "more susceptible to puncture," said Glenn
McGovern, lawyer for the family of Hung Le.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas complaint focuses on a different change recommended by
Ford last October in a notice to repair shops. The notice advised the
shops to change a bolt and grind down a metal tab that may have
punctured or ripped fuel tanks in some of the wrecks.</TE>
<TE>   But Ford did not notify all owners, nor agree to pay for the
modifications, except for cars still under warranty.</TE>
<TE>   The suit seeks a court order compelling Ford to notify all Texas
police agencies, many of which do not know the fixes are needed, the
suit says. It also asks that the fixes be made at Ford's expense, and
that the company be barred from making public statements minimizing
the need for the repairs.</TE>
<TE>   The suit says Ford internal documents show the firm has known
since the 1980s that the worst place to put fuel tanks is behind the
axle. Potentially dangerous for civilians, the location is
particularly unsafe for police, who are exposed to rear-end
collisions when they pull over to write tickets or help stranded
motorists, the suit states.</TE>
<TE>   Ford, with 85% of the market for police vehicles, sold 56,000 of
the cruisers last year.</TE>
<TE>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last November
opened an investigation of the fuel systems of Ford "Panther"
platform cars, including the civilian and police Crown Victorias, the
Lincoln Town Car and the Mercury Grand Marquis. The probe is
continuing.</TE>
<TE>   Some Arizona agencies have frozen purchase orders, and the city of
Phoenix is retrofitting its 735 Crown Vics with new, and purportedly
safer, fuel systems.</TE>

<HD>Universal Executives Look to Diller for Rescue</HD>
<DH>Media: Problems at Vivendi, the studio's parent, lead to
speculation on the mogul's plans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Up and down the halls of Universal Studios on Tuesday there were
periodic outbursts--20! 19! 18!--as assistants yelled out updates on
the deteriorating Vivendi Universal stock price.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone's stock options are worse than underwater," one
executive said. "They are anchored to the bottom of the ocean."</LD>
<LD>   As dire speculation swirled through Wall Street about the
financial future of Vivendi Universal, the big question at the
Hollywood studio centered on the plans of the company's most
influential U.S. executive, Barry Diller: Will he buy Vivendi's
movie, television and theme park divisions? Will he ride to their
rescue?</LD>
<TE>   But the word most used to describe Diller today is "coy."</TE>
<TE>   "Barry's waiting, and so we're waiting," said one executive, who
like the others, asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   According to executives close to the storied mogul, Diller is
doing what he has done for the seven months since he was put in
charge of Vivendi Universal's non-music entertainment operations.
Which is to say, very little.</TE>
<TE>   The current theory among Universal Studios executives is this:
Diller is betting that the French soon will realize he is their best
bet for increasing the value of their Hollywood assets. And when
Vivendi Universal comes calling with an offer to sell him the studio
as a way to pay off its huge debts, Diller will decide whether he's
interested.</TE>
<TE>   After cashing Vivendi Universal's $275-million check at the end of
the year--a bonus from last year's purchase of his USA Networks--some
guess that Diller will let go of his old dream of owning a Hollywood
studio.</TE>
<TE>   "He really isn't focused on this place," said one executive.
"Barry doesn't consider Universal his problem."</TE>
<TE>   The staff at Vivendi Universal Entertainment would appreciate a
boss who would lead a buyout of the division, cutting them loose from
the mess in France and restoring the value of the stock.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that Diller doesn't appear to be so inclined.</TE>
<TE>   The first signal Diller sent to the staff was memorable. He kept
now-ousted Vivendi Universal Chairman Jean-Marie Messier and studio
President Ron Meyer waiting for more than an hour to introduce him to
the senior staff. After only 15 minutes of glad-handing, Diller was
gone.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry has been a minimalist at Universal," one executive said.</TE>
<TE>   Diller spends most of his time in New York focusing on his other
company, USA Interactive Inc., an e-commerce business that has made
him a billionaire. He's been clear that he would not involve USAI in
any purchase of Vivendi Universal assets.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Diller has made some efforts to keep the studio stable and
in shape to survive the current turmoil. The top executives all have
new contracts. And he has dangled the idea that he is working on a
new incentive plan to replace the sunken Vivendi Universal stock
options.</TE>

<HD>West's Housing Prices Are On Track, Fed Says</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Region is no more vulnerable to a market
bubble than rest of the U.S., report states.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bubble or no bubble?</LD>
<LD>   Though economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco
won't speculate on whether home prices have soared too high, they say
that California and the Western region don't appear any more
vulnerable to a price drop than the rest of the nation.</LD>
<LD>   That's the word in Tuesday's quarterly Fed report that tracks the
economic health of the San Francisco Federal Reserve District, which
includes California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Oregon,
Washington, Alaska and Hawaii.</LD>
<TE>   In the first quarter, the district's residential real estate
market performed right in step with the nation's, according to the
report, with home prices rising 5.7% and sales up 11% compared with
the same period a year ago. California outpaced the pack, with home
prices increasing 7.4% and sales up 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Such increases have some observers whispering the B-word for
California, but Fed economist Mary Daly said the recent spike had to
be put in context.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason California's recent home-price appreciation
looks so steep is that the residential real estate market was mired
in a deep trough for much of the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s, prices soared, then plunged starting in the
early '90s as the defense industry collapsed. Only in recent years
have California prices begun outpacing those of the nation again.</TE>
<TE>   When measuring the state's boom-bust-boom pattern over the long
U.S. economic expansion, it turns out that home-price appreciation in
California lagged behind that of the nation, Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   From the first quarter of 1991 through the first quarter of this
year, home prices rose 57% across the United States as a whole but
only 41% in California, according to the Fed data.</TE>
<TE>   "No one can answer the question as to whether we're in a bubble or
not," Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we can say is that ... even with the recent, rapid run-up in
values, California doesn't look out of line with the rest of the
nation."</TE>
<TE>   The housing supply in California likewise looks tight compared
with the rest of the country, Daly said, as measured by the amount of
housing being constructed in the state relative to its job creation.</TE>
<TE>   From 1991 to 2000, the district, excluding California, created 1.5
jobs for every new housing permit issued--a ratio considered ideal by
many regional planners and just slightly above that for the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Over the same period, California created two new jobs for every
housing permit issued in the state. From 1995 to 2000, that ratio
rose to 3.6--more than double that of the nation and the rest of the
district.</TE>
<TE>   The higher the ratio, the higher the pent-up demand for housing.
Daly said that figure has eased of late since California, like the
rest of the nation, isn't creating many new jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she said, strong demand probably would keep the state's
housing market tight in coming quarters.</TE>

<HD>Sellers of French Fries May Face Suits</HD>
<DH>Food: Two California environmental groups plan to target
companies that fail to warn of a suspected carcinogen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two California environmental groups have notified the state attorney
general's office of their intent to sue the nation's top sellers of
French fries under California's Proposition 65, which requires
manufacturers to warn consumers of toxic chemicals in their products.</LD>
<LD>   They hope their action will prompt the state to probe the matter
and possibly file its own suit, an action the state attorney
general's office said it is considering.</LD>
<LD>   The chemical they're seeking a warning for is acrylamide, a
suspected carcinogen. A recent Swedish government study found high
levels of the chemical in fatty starchy foods cooked at high
temperatures, such as French fries.</LD>
<TE>   In one test, McDonald's French fries were found to contain 300
times the amount of acrylamide allowed by the Environmental
Protection Agency for a glass of water.</TE>
<TE>   The two groups hope to use the 1986 state law to force McDonald's
and Burger King to put a warning on their packaging in California, or
reformulate their fries.</TE>
<TE>   One of the two groups--Southern California-based Environmental
World Watch--also is seeking similar action from grocery
manufacturers whose products have been found to contain high levels
of acrylamide.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope this is going to erupt into a full-scale investigation on
the part of the food industry" to determine the source of the
carcinogen, said Robert J. Mandell, a Northridge attorney
representing Environmental World Watch.</TE>
<TE>   Acrylamide is on the state's list of chemicals known to cause
cancer or reproductive toxicity. Scientists have generally not
associated it with food, but as a water treatment, an ingredient in
packaging and as a byproduct of cigarette smoke.</TE>
<TE>   The state's listing does not call acrylamide a human carcinogen,
but it is on the list of chemicals that require a consumer warning on
packaging, or a warning in the stores and restaurants where products
containing it are sold, said Ed Weil, a deputy attorney general based
in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists at a World Health Organization meeting last week in
Geneva called the April discovery of acrylamide in food a "major
concern." But they urged more research and did not caution people to
change their diets.</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration has not issued any warnings on
acrylamide. But it has launched a new round of research to determine
which foods contain high levels of the suspected carcinogen and how
it is formed.</TE>
<TE>   Both Environmental World Watch and a six-member coalition of
environmentalists and academics have given the California attorney
general's office 60-day notice of their intent to file suit, a move
that typically lets the office decide if it wants to take action.</TE>
<TE>   Weil said the state is considering the matter and will make an
announcement in coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been looking at it since the story first broke," Weil said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Burger King said the suits don't "make sense"
because the discovery of acrylamide in food is so new.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot that still needs to be understood about the effects
of these levels [of acrylamide]," said Burger King's Rob Doughty.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, McDonald's executives said the suit was premature.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the company called the suit "inappropriate" and
said that "flooding" Californians with labels related to all baked
and fried foods would "undermine the purpose of Prop. 65 by devaluing
labeling in general."</TE>
<TE>   Environmental attorneys argue that everyone, even food companies,
must follow state regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "If your product contains a carcinogen and you know that it
contains this carcinogen, you are obligated under California law to
warn the consumer," Mandell said. "It's as simple as that."</TE>

<LD>Wall Street's bears knocked over another milestone Tuesday, driving
the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index below its post-
terrorist-attacks closing low in a second day of heavy selling.</LD>
<LD>   Investors continued to dump technology shares, but they also
targeted many of the stock sectors that had been among this year's
better performers. Fears over accounting scandals and possible new
terrorist attacks made for a grim mood overall.</LD>
<LD>   The S&amp;P 500 slid 20.56 points, or 2.1%, to 948.09, the lowest
close since Jan. 12, 1998. The index easily fell through its Sept. 21
closing low of 965.80--which many investors hoped had marked the end
of the bear market that began in March 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index also sank further, tumbling 45.98
points, or 3.3%, to 1,357.82, a five-year low. Nasdaq broke through
its Sept. 21 low on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow industrials dropped 102.04 points, or 1.1%, to 9,007.75.</TE>
<TE>   Losers swamped winners by 25 to 8 on the New York Stock Exchange
and by 26 to 9 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Trading volume was heavy, though Nasdaq's total again was inflated
by huge volume in WorldCom, shares of which rose 4 cents, to 10
cents.</TE>
<TE>   Investors' collective sentiment was damaged anew last week, when
WorldCom revealed that it had understated expenses by $3.9 billion
over the last five quarters. Already reeling from a host of corporate
scandals this year, many investors now have no appetite for equities,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, "the path of least resistance is to sell," Philip
Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management,
told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting worries were fanned Tuesday by reports that
entertainment giant Vivendi Universal may have sought to pad its
books in 2001. Vivendi's U.S.-traded shares dived $4.69, to $17.76.</TE>
<TE>   Investors dumped many other stocks that have suffered from rumors
about possible accounting issues, including AOL Time Warner, down 99
cents to $12.52, and power companies such as Dynegy, down 46 cents to
$6.24. The Dow Jones utility stock index fell 2.3% to 262.90, its
lowest since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Sellers also hammered some of the stock groups that had held up
well for much of this year, such as smaller and mid-size stocks. The
S&amp;P small-cap stock index fell 3.3%; the S&amp;P mid-cap index lost
nearly 3%.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of home builders, HMOs, gold miners and real estate
investment trusts also were broadly lower. They had been among this
year's leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said the dumping of recent leaders could indicate
that the latest selling wave is nearing an end. Investors often wait
to sell their best-performing stocks last.</TE>
<TE>   Richard McCabe, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the market was
"very, very oversold"--meaning prices have been falling so sharply,
and for such an extended period, that a bounce is overdue simply for
technical reasons.</TE>
<TE>   He expects stocks to rebound for two to three months, then slump
again in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts still are holding out hope that investors will
respond positively to what are expected to be upbeat second-quarter
earnings reports from many companies, thanks to the economy's
recovery in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But the damage to investor psychology from the corporate scandals
could be deep and long-lasting, some analysts warn.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is whether we have a crisis of confidence or a
contraction of confidence. Judging from the fact that the market is
hardly acting as a magnet for money right now, I think it's fair to
say that it could trade lower still," said Alan Ackerman, executive
vice president at Fahnestock &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading Tuesday, the dollar took back some ground against
the euro, after European Union reports showed that consumer and
business confidence had waned. The euro closed at 98.4 cents, down
from 98.8 cents Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Computer chip stocks slumped after analysts at Morgan Stanley
and Salomon Smith Barney lowered forecasts for industry growth.
Intel, the largest maker of semiconductors, slid to its lowest since
June 1998, declining 97 cents to $16.57.</TE>
<TE>   Other losers included National Semiconductor, down $4.58 to
$22.75; International Rectifier, down $1.03 to $25.58; and Micron
Technology, off 76 cents to $19.24.</TE>
<TE>   * Among other tech names, Cisco Systems fell 53 cents to $12.56,
Oracle dropped 32 cents to $8.68, and Computer Sciences was off $1.23
to $40.45.</TE>
<TE>   * Among utilities, American Electric Power fell $1.11 to $38.48
and PG&amp;E dropped $1.17 to $16.18.</TE>
<TE>   * Home builders' shares slumped after rallying Monday. Pulte Homes
lost $2.97 to $54.97, Centex slid $3.56 to $54.54, and KB Home
dropped $2.67 to $49.83.</TE>
<TE>   * In the gold sector, Barrick Gold fell 74 cents to $18.44 and
GoldCorp lost 95 cents to $9.90 as near-term gold futures eased $1.20
to $312.80 an ounce, the lowest since mid-May.</TE>
<TE>   * Among real estate investment trusts, Boston Properties fell 62
cents to $39.25 and Duke Realty was off 65 cents to $27.40.</TE>
<TE>   * On the plus side, some classic "defensive" stocks gained. Philip
Morris added 74 cents to $45.70 and Anheuser-Busch rose 90 cents to
$51.20.</TE>
<TE>   * European stock markets were broadly lower. The main German share
index tumbled 3.9%; the French index lost 4.2%, dragged down by
Vivendi.</TE>

<HD>Stewart Cancels Appearance on CBS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martha Stewart canceled her weekly appearance this morning on CBS'
"The Early Show" late Tuesday, saying she does not want to comment
further on allegations she used insider information when selling
ImClone Systems Inc. stock.</LD>
<LD>   "CBS is a premier news network and, as such, they are compelled to
interview Martha Stewart regarding the ImClone matter," Stewart's
statement read. "She is unable to comment or offer any other
information at this time out of respect for the investigatory
process. This inherent conflict unfortunately prevents Martha from
appearing tomorrow."</LD>
<LD>   A CBS spokeswoman did not return calls for comment.</LD>
<TE>   Other than one formal statement and her CBS appearance last week,
Stewart has shunned the spotlight since the ImClone allegations
became public.</TE>
<TE>   However, her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., has
hired Brunswick Group, a public relations strategy firm, apparently
to do damage control.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has denied wrongdoing in her sale of nearly 4,000 ImClone
shares one day before the Food and Drug Administration rejected
ImClone's experimental cancer drug, which sent the stock plummeting.
She reportedly is facing a probe involving charges of obstruction of
justice and making false statements.</TE>
<TE>   One of Stewart's few public comments about the scandal came last
week during her "Early Show" spot, when she called the matter
"ridiculousness" while she chopped cabbage.</TE>
<TE>   But that appearance, in which she tried to end the questions by
saying, "I just want to focus on my salad," became more fodder for
those who have parodied and pilloried her recent behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Since news of the investigation broke last month, shares in Martha
Stewart Living Omnimedia have fallen by as much as half, though they
have recovered a bit. Shares rose $1.10 to $12.60 Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>FDA Blocks Release of Nicotine-Laced Water</HD>
<DH>Beverages: Quick Test 5 hoped to have the product in stores
this month. The agency says the drink should be regarded as a drug.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A small Westlake Village company's bid to put the first
nicotine-laced drinking water on drugstore shelves this summer was
rejected Tuesday by the Food and Drug Administration, making it the
third smokeless nicotine product the agency has blocked this year.</LD>
<LD>   Quick Test 5 Inc., a three-year-old, 25-employee firm, had planned
to have its NICO Water available for consumers this month as a
"nicotine supplement" and a "convenient beverage when you can't or
don't want to smoke."</LD>
<LD>   One advertisement would have read "Out of Smokes? Grab a Bottle!"</LD>
<TE>   The FDA said Tuesday that it had "determined that this product
should be regarded as an unapproved new drug and cannot be legally
marketed as a dietary supplement."</TE>
<TE>   The agency added that nicotine-laced water also could not be
marketed as a smoking cessation product without undergoing the same
testing demanded of the manufacturers of other products, such as
Nicoderm CQ, Prostep, Habitrol, and Nicorette.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision underscores our commitment that consumers be
protected from drug products that have not undergone our rigorous
review process," said FDA Deputy Commissioner Lester M. Crawford.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Quick Test 5, Ed Haisha, said the FDA had confused
the company with an earlier and now-defunct effort to sell
nicotine-laced water. Quick Test 5 bought the rights to the nicotine
water patent in April.</TE>
<TE>   Haisha added that the company was confident it would be able to
convince the federal agency that it ought to be able to market the
product.</TE>
<TE>   Quick Test 5 manufactures drug- and disease-testing kits, Haisha
said.</TE>
<TE>   Haisha added that it was hypocritical of anti-smoking groups to
fight against a product that eliminates the health risks associated
with secondhand smoke.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 anti-smoking groups, including Washington-based Campaign
for Tobacco Free Kids, petitioned the FDA in December to step in
before nicotine-laced water hit the market.</TE>
<TE>   The group argued, among other things, that the water would serve
only as a hook to create more nicotine cravings and eventual smokers.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids also said nicotine
water served as another example of why Congress should give the FDA
the authority to regulate tobacco products.</TE>
<TE>   The Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids said it also has requested that
the FDA take action against a nicotine mint and against two cigarette
brands whose manufacturers claim to have removed at least some cancer
causing ingredients.</TE>
<TE>   In April, the FDA called on pharmacists around the nation to pull
two other nicotine products from their Internet sales lists:
nicotine-laced lollipops billed as a way to quit smoking and nicotine
lip balm.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate action Tuesday, the FDA rejected New York-based
Forest Laboratories Inc.'s application to sell an alcoholism drug
with Germany-based partner Merck KgaA.</TE>
<TE>   The drug, which is called acamprosate, is designed to calm the
cravings of recovering alcoholics. The FDA said it expected one more
safety test and more analysis of studies already conducted on the
drug.</TE>

<HD>O'Melveny Says It Will Combine With N.Y. Firm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles-based law firm O'Melveny &amp; Myers on Tuesday joined the
merger trend sweeping the legal profession, announcing its intention
to combine its practice with that of New York-based O'Sullivan, a
boutique firm specializing in private equity work.</LD>
<LD>   If approved by partners at both firms, the new practice would have
more than 800 lawyers, bolstering its position as one of the largest
in the country.</LD>
<LD>   O'Melveny saw profit rise 34% last year on 17% growth in revenue.</LD>
<TE>   The combined firm would have 265 attorneys in New York, almost
double the number O'Melveny &amp; Myers now has there, and it would add
private equity to its practice areas, which now include litigation,
bankruptcy, class actions, intellectual property and transactional
work.</TE>
<TE>   "We've really identified the private equity practice as a
strategic priority for us," said O'Melveny Vice Chairwoman Patricia
Frobes.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very few private equity firms of the caliber of
O'Sullivan, so it's always been at the top of our list," she said.
"It really was not so much looking to merge with another firm, but
targeting the private equity area in New York. That led us to
O'Sullivan. In the private equity practice, it's important to have a
strong profile and footprint in New York, which O'Sullivan gave us."</TE>
<TE>   An O'Sullivan representative did not return calls.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed merger is one of at least two dozen announced this
year among legal partnerships, which are following a consolidation
trend seen in other professional services fields, such as accounting.
Over the last two years, large, multi-practice law firms have been
growing and diversifying by combining with smaller firms that have
one or two specialties. After a record 70 mergers last year, 12 firms
now have more than 1,000 lawyers each.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're going to see another three or four years of
mergers," said Brad Hildebrandt, chairman of New Jersey-based
Hildebrandt International, a professional services consulting firm
that specializes in advising law firm mergers and acquisitions.
"There's been a substantial number of mergers of out-of-state firms
with small and mid-size New York firms."</TE>
<TE>   Hildebrandt said O'Melveny's proposed merger with O'Sullivan
follows a pattern of firms seeking to expand their New York presence
and their financial practice.</TE>
<TE>   "O'Sullivan is a very good small boutique finance firm in New
York--and very high profile with a very good reputation," he said.
"This fills out and expands [O'Melveny's] New York operation in the
corporate finance area, which is exactly what their goal should be.
You can't be too big in New York. This broadens O'Melveny's reach,
and makes it more competitive nationally and internationally."</TE>

<HD>Ovitz Issues an Apology for Comment About 'Gay Mafia'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO and LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Onetime superagent Michael Ovitz apologized Tuesday for his comments
in a Vanity Fair magazine article, due to hit the newsstands today,
in which he blames his downfall on a group he calls Hollywood's "gay
mafia."</LD>
<LD>   "I made some statements that were inappropriate during an open and
frank discussion with Vanity Fair," Ovitz said in a statement. "In
particular the term 'gay mafia' does not reflect my true feelings or
attitudes. It is regrettable and I am truly sorry."</LD>
<LD>   Ovitz's comments in the Vanity Fair story, which were furiously
faxed and e-mailed around Hollywood starting early Monday, stunned
even the town's most blase insiders. Some questioned Ovitz's sanity
and others said he was homophobic.</LD>
<TE>   Once Hollywood's most powerful agent, Ovitz's career initially
stumbled in the early 1990s when he left the Creative Artists Agency
he co-founded for the No.2 job at the Walt Disney Co.</TE>
<TE>   That job lasted 18 months and sent him into retirement with a
handsome severance. He reemerged in 1999 with a management firm
called Artists Management Group that he sold this year after its
television business failed and investors backed out.</TE>
<TE>   Ovitz told Vanity Fair that he was the victim of a
well-orchestrated attack campaign by his numerous enemies in
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   He blamed many people, not all of them gay, for his problems.
Among those singled out were Dream Works SKG founder David Geffen and
Universal Studios chief Ron Meyer, who was a founding partner at
Ovitz's former agency, CAA.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how hard it is for people to see me as a victim," he is
quoted as saying, "but in this case it's pretty close to the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Many of those named in the piece declined to comment; others, such
as Geffen, suggested Ovitz needed psychiatric care.</TE>

<HD>State Asks Judge to Void Sempra's Electricity Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a lawsuit designed to break a $7-billion electricity contract, the
state Department of Water Resources on Tuesday accused Sempra Energy
of fraud for allegedly lying about its ability to build a new power
plant to deliver electricity this summer.</LD>
<LD>   DWR contends that Sempra promised to supply power this summer and
beyond from plants it would build, but instead is buying power and
reselling it to DWR.</LD>
<LD>   Sempra says it is building plants capable of supplying 2,100
megawatts of power but it also is able to acquire power from other
sources under the contract.</LD>
<TE>   The suit, filed in San Diego Superior Court, says Sempra "induced
the department to enter into a long-term contract by misrepresenting
its intent to build new plants and supply the department power from
those plants to the detriment of the state and prior consumers."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego-based Sempra lashed back, saying that the charges are
without merit and that state officials are "playing a game of Russian
roulette with the state's energy future."</TE>
<TE>   "Their reckless political shenanigans are undermining the very
contracts that serve as the foundation for getting new power plants
built--plants that they acknowledge are necessary to serve
California's current and future energy needs," said Michael R.
Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, the
power-plant-building arm of Sempra Energy.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year agreement for as much as 1,900 megawatts was reached
last year as the state signed $43 billion in long-term electricity
contracts to tame power prices during the worst of California's
energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The state since then has been struggling to renegotiate those
contracts.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Meets Tunney Act Guidelines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. does not have to disclose its lobbying contacts with
Congress connected with its antitrust case, a federal judge decided
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The 1974 Tunney Act, which makes sure that a company settling
federal charges doesn't get improper favors from government
employees, calls for a company to disclose its lobbying contacts with
"any officer or employee of the United States."</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft listed only a handful of meetings with Justice
Department officials, drawing the ire of critics who said the company
should disclose its considerable contacts with members of Congress
and their aides. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly
disagreed.</LD>
<TE>   In its twice-a-year reports to Congress on lobbying activities,
Microsoft reported spending $300,000 on lobbying related to the
antitrust case in the first half of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly's ruling came as part of a procedural order in
which she certified that Microsoft and the Justice Department have
fulfilled the steps required by the Tunney Act.</TE>
<TE>   She will now decide whether the federal settlement is in the
public interest, the last requirement before the settlement goes into
effect.</TE>
<TE>   A decision on the settlement, as well as the suit brought by nine
states that want harsher penalties against the company, is expected
in late summer.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, European Union regulators said they were not yet
satisfied that online authentication services like Microsoft's .NET
Passport are complying with data protection laws in Europe, but
stopped short of launching a formal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Although Microsoft has put in place some measures to address data
protection, a number of elements of the .NET Passport system raise
legal issues and therefore require further consideration," the heads
of data protection agencies from the 15 EU countries said.</TE>

<LD>   Debt rating firm Standard &amp; Poor's said Tyco's rating could be cut
because the spinoff Monday of its CIT Group finance unit failed to
raise as much cash as expected.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco shares dropped $1.10 to $12.65 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   Tyco executives, in a conference call with investors, bristled at
any suggestion the company faces a credit crunch.</TE>
<TE>   "From now until November 2003 ... we can meet all of our
obligations without refinancing any debt or selling any assets,"
interim Chief Executive John Fort said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said management has found no evidence of accounting
irregularities in its review since former CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski
resigned last month. Kozlowski has been indicted on sales-tax evasion
charges.</TE>
<TE>   "Accounting issues have created a recent firestorm in the
corporate world," Fort said. "We're not in this category."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Swartz, Tyco's chief financial officer, said the company
expects to earn at least 44 cents a share in the quarter ended June
30, or a penny better than the consensus forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Swartz said cash flow estimates indicate Tyco can pay down more
than $8 billion of debt maturing in fiscal 2003 and finish the year
with almost $2 billion in cash.</TE>
<TE>   Investors had hoped Tyco could retire even more debt, but the sale
Monday of CIT raised $4.6 billion for the parent firm. Tyco had hoped
to raise as much as $5.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   CIT shares fell $1 to $22 in their trading debut on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Loral Cuts Outlook for Sales, Profit</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The company's stock plummets below $1 on forecast,
but CEO dismisses investor concerns about bankruptcy, delisting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Loral Space &amp; Communications Ltd. on Tuesday slashed revenue and
earnings expectations because of the drought in telecommunications
spending, and its shares plunged by nearly 33%.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based company, which sells satellites and satellite
communications services, said it would not be able to achieve
profitability in late 2003 as previously forecast, but dismissed
analysts' concerns it was headed for bankruptcy or delisting.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not concerned about bankruptcy.... We're not aware of
concerns about delisting," Loral Chief Executive Bernard Schwartz
told analysts on a conference call.</LD>
<TE>   Although the company's share price has plunged below the $1
minimum trading requirement on the New York Stock Exchange, Schwartz
said the NYSE also looks at operating and financial issues, which he
said aren't problems.</TE>
<TE>   Loral shares fell 32 cents to close at 66 cents on the NYSE. They
are down 78% this year.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which has been hit hard by a slump in
telecommunications and a downturn in satellite demand, did not
indicate how soon it foresees profitability.</TE>
<TE>   Loral said it still expected to end the year with $80 million to
$90 million in cash and available credit after capital spending of
$160 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it now expects a full-year loss of $190 million,
or 50 cents a share including certain charges, compared with its
previous forecast of a loss of 40 cents to 50 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Loral blamed much of the shortfall on its Skynet satellite
services business, which it said has been hurt by the economic
slowdown and delay in demand for high-speed data services.</TE>
<TE>   CFTC Approves Rules</TE>
<TE>   for Single-Stock Futures</TE>
<TE>   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Tuesday approved
long-delayed customer margin rules governing single-stock futures,
clearing one of the final obstacles to trading of the products.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which also must approve
the rules before trading can begin, will act as quickly as possible,
SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt said.</TE>
<TE>   Single-stock futures will provide "a new opportunity for customers
to manage their financial risk," CFTC Chairman James Newsome said
after the vote. Commissioners set the margin, or initial deposit,
requirement at 20% for the contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Futures exchanges, which have lost business to overseas and
electronic markets, see single-stock futures as a new product to
retain or attract customers and tap into the U.S. equity market.</TE>
<TE>   The contracts will allow investors to make leveraged bets on price
movements of individual stocks. The first futures are likely to be
offered on major blue-chip shares.</TE>
<TE>   Single-stock futures will require an investor to buy or sell a
company's stock, or settle in cash, at a specific price and date.
They differ from stock options, which give investors the right to buy
or sell a security without requiring them to do so.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. exchanges could start trading single-stock futures "by the
end of August or early September," Newsome said.</TE>
<TE>   Banks, pension-plan and hedge-fund managers and individual
investors are among potential users.</TE>
<TE>   Estimates of demand vary. "I ask various people, and demand ranges
from 'zero' to 'I can't wait,' " said John G. Gaine, president of the
Managed Funds Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News, Reuters</TE>
<TE>   SEC Proposes Anti-Terrorism Rules</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday proposed
anti-terrorism rules that would require brokerages and mutual funds
to verify the identities of people who try to open accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The rules also would require the firms to maintain records of the
information used to verify the person's identity and check the
information against any government lists of known or suspected
terrorists or terrorist groups, the SEC said. Other government
regulators will enforce similar rules over banks and commodities
firms.</TE>
<TE>   The rules will apply only to new accounts, not existing accounts.</TE>

<HD>Auto Sales on a Roll in June</HD>
<DH>Economy: Car makers are seeing strong results amid steady
consumer confidence. Ford and GM hope incentives will boost buying
through the summer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Auto sales in the U.S. turned in another strong performance in June,
declining just 1.7% from last year's robust level, auto makers
reported Tuesday. And Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.
announced a new round of sales incentives, which are likely to keep
sales strong into the summer.</LD>
<LD>   The auto sales numbers bode well for the economy, since vehicle
sales, a closely watched economic barometer, are a key component of
consumer spending.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe a moderate recovery is coming our way," said Jarleth
Costello, GM's senior U.S. economist. "Consumer confidence is well
above last fall's levels. The labor market is stabilizing with
unemployment claims settling down. Household income increased, and
low mortgage rates are encouraging a refinancing boom."</LD>
<TE>   General Motors managed to increase sales 4.3% last month, while
Ford Motor continued its slide with sales shrinking 10.6% compared
with last June.</TE>
<TE>   For the first half of the year, the U.S. auto market was down a
moderate 2.6% from last year's near-record pace, according to
tracking firm Autodata Inc. GM was down 2.2% but the Chrysler Group
of DaimlerChrysler declined 4% and Ford was off considerably, down
10.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Ford and GM renewed their incentive war Tuesday to boost their
sales in a market where the growth is going mainly to Japanese and
German imports.</TE>
<TE>   GM said it is reviving its no-interest financing, offering 0% to
2.9% loans of up to five years on 2002 model-year vehicles, or up to
$4,000 cash back. Ford announced it is offering $1,500 to $3,000
rebates and low-interest loans on 2002 models.</TE>
<TE>   Ford rejected the idea that the program, dubbed "We Will Rock
You," was a panic move in response to its 14.5% drop in sales in May
and 10.6% decline in June.</TE>
<TE>   "I would characterize this program as normal," Ford director of
sales analysis George Pipas said. "We certainly are not in a position
of having to panic. Consumers do expect programs on '02 cars, and we
want to do programs that connect with the end-of-model-year buyer."</TE>
<TE>   GM also had planned its incentive program, which it is calling
"Summerdrive," as a routine seasonal promotion, said Paul Ballew,
GM's executive director of market and industry analysis.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about maintaining our momentum and conveying it to consumers
most effectively," Ballew said. "It's part of the overall plan; it
was not an emergency, knee-jerk reaction to weak sales in May." GM's
sales declined 12.4% in May.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers
Assn., noted that American luxury brands, such as GM's Cadillac and
Buick divisions and Ford's Lincoln, have been languishing and that
the incentives could boost their fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   "Both GM and Ford have to find a way to stop this decline," Taylor
said.</TE>
<TE>   The GM program offers no-interest financing on 2002 Buick,
Cadillac, Chevrolet, Oldsmobile and Pontiac-GMC cars and trucks for
36, 48 or 60 months, depending on the vehicle. The deal ends Sept. 3
and does not include Saturn, Saab or Hummer vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street expects GM's move to be costly. The program is costing
GM $2,777 per vehicle, said auto analyst John Casesa of Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   "This appears to be an expensive program; one that fits the
multiyear pattern of an industrywide increase in incentives, and
suggests that GM is concerned about the industry sales outlook,"
Casesa said in a research note to clients. "However ... GM's
incentives [and for that matter the industry's], have typically risen
dramatically every summer as the company works to clear out old model
stock."</TE>
<TE>   Ford is offering up to $3,000 back or financing rates from 0.9% to
4.9%, with a handful of vehicles with no-interest financing for 36
months. The program runs through Sept. 30 but does not include Ford's
Thunderbird or SVT (Special Vehicle Team) performance vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Car and truck sales in the U.S. last year reached 17.1 million,
second only to the record 17.4 million sold in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Economists have expected the auto market to contract this year as
well. Based on the first six months, sales are on pace to reach about
16.7 million in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Brands that gained ground in the first half of the year included
Toyota, Lexus, Nissan, Acura, Mitsubishi, Mercedes-Benz, Saab and
Kia. Infiniti, BMW and Hyundai were all up more than 16%.</TE>
<TE>   Losers, besides the American Big Three, were Honda and VW, which
were down only about 1% compared with the first six months of last
year, and Audi, Mazda, Subaru, Isuzu, Suzuki and Volvo.</TE>

<LD>BAE Systems Controls will leave its longtime home near the Santa
Monica Airport next year and head toward Los Angeles International
Airport in a move that allows the aerospace company to cash in the
value of its Westside real estate.</LD>
<LD>   BAE has signed a 10-year lease valued at $47.85 million for
150,000 square feet of space at Wateridge Two, a new office building
on Goldleaf Circle in an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County
bordering Marina del Rey, Playa Vista and Culver City.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which makes electronic flight and engine controls for
defense and commercial aircraft, in December sold the 10.4 acres that
the manufacturer had occupied since the 1950s at Airport Avenue and
Bundy Drive in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   When BAE put its property on the market a year ago, industry
observers predicted the site would sell for $35 million or more. The
Westside office market had cooled by the end of last year. BAE
received $30 million from Santa Monica City College for the site and
has an agreement to occupy offices there as a tenant through June
2003.</TE>
<TE>   The landlord of Wateridge Two is Newport Beach-based Crown Realty
&amp; Development. Cresa Partners represented BAE in the lease. Crown
Realty was represented by CB Richard Ellis.</TE>

<HD>Likely New CEO a Steady Leader</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA and SARAH WHITE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>In the aftermath of Jean-Marie Messier's traumatic fall, crisis-torn
media conglomerate Vivendi Universal desperately needs "an
anti-Messier," a low-key, steady leader who must be especially adept
at balancing French and U.S. interests, analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   The board of directors apparently believes that Jean-Rene Fourtou,
a veteran consultant and pharmaceutical executive considered the
likely successor to the brash Messier, is the man for these troubled
times. It is expected to name Fourtou interim chief at a high-stakes
meeting today, although other candidates still were being mentioned
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Whoever assumes the new role of CEO probably will begin efforts to
turn around the ailing company by selling key assets of French-U.S.
conglomerate. And therein lies inherent conflict: Whereas U.S.
investors will want to see quick and profitable sales of assets, the
French have a different agenda, analysts say.</LD>
<TE>   French allies here will expect the new leader to protect French
firms whose loss to foreign buyers would be a political debacle,
especially the Canal Plus cable television channel and Vivendi
Environnement, which supplies water to about 40% of the
municipalities in the country, said Elie Cohn, research director of
the National Academic Research Center, a Paris think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Fortin, editor of the Challenges economics journal here and
author of a book about Messier, agreed: "The American reading of
things will be ... Let's sell as quickly as possible the assets that
are easiest to sell, in order to get the group out of debt and
refocus on films and music. The French reading will be much more
patriotic when it comes to saving what can be saved of Vivendi,
notably its French aspects.</TE>
<TE>   "In reality, Messier's successor, whoever he is, will have to
achieve a synthesis between these very, very different visions,"
Fortin added.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou has solid credentials and connections in the select milieu
in which the elite of France's private and public sectors converge.
He's an old friend of former French President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing and other influential figures who helped hasten Messier's
departure.</TE>
<TE>   He has experience navigating change and has demonstrated an
ability to work on both sides of the Atlantic and oversee corporate
restructuring projects. A business consultant for 23 years, Fourtou
oversaw the privatization of a French pharmaceutical company and its
eventual fusion with German interests to create Aventis, one of the
world's largest pharmaceutical concerns. He's done plenty of business
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the 63-year-old Fourtou, who now is semi-retired as vice
chairman of Aventis' board, doesn't have much to lose as he confronts
the massive job of resuscitating the world's second-biggest media
company.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to realize that there aren't a lot of candidates to take
over a group like this in the state that it's in," said Fortin. "You
need a man whose career is largely behind him."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Giscard and players in the center-right government
of President Jacques Chirac who believed change at the top was
overdue, the choice of Fourtou was championed by Claude Bebear, a
powerhouse among French executives and a vocal critic of Messier,
according to analysts and news reports.</TE>
<TE>   Bebear, former CEO of AXA, has been friends with Fourtou for 30
years. Both are children of teachers, and both are from southwest
France and are avid athletes and lovers of good food.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou studied at the prestigious Ecole Polytechnique. He joined
Bossard Consultants in 1963, eventually rising to the top post at the
consulting firm. The Giscard government put him in charge of the
state pharmaceutical company, Rhone-Poulenc, in 1986. He oversaw the
1993 privatization and restructuring of the firm, which merged with
Hoechst of Germany six years later to form Aventis.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou's "discreet, self-effacing" personality will come in
handy, Cohn said. Messier's combative style became one of the
fundamental elements contributing to the uproar at Vivendi, he said.
Nonetheless, some analysts say they aren't sure Fourtou is up to the
job.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a choice that surprises me," Fortin said. "He's never been
one of the most prestigious executives in France."</TE>
<TE>   Whether it turns out to be Fourtou or a surprise alternative,
Messier's successor will have to move fast. After months of losses,
surging debt and headlong expenditures, the mood is grim at Vivendi.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders and employees fear that working people could be hit
hardest.</TE>
<TE>   The most urgent issue: assessing and clarifying a murky financial
picture.</TE>
<TE>   "No one knows exactly the magnitude of the risk at Vivendi," Cohn
said. The successor "arrives in a situation of extreme crisis, and
there is no time to lose. He will have to use all his contacts and
negotiating skills."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Rotella reported from Lyon, France, and special
correspondent White from Paris. Achrene Sicakyuz of The Times' Paris
Bureau also contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>A Swift, Sad Ending for Hollywood Drama</HD>

<LD>It has become one of Hollywood's most predictable scripts.</LD>
<LD>   An outsider, usually a foreign company, spends billions of dollars
to acquire an entertainment empire, full of dreams of meshing
technology with the "content" Hollywood churns out in the form of
films, TV shows and music. By the final act, the chastened buyer is
in full retreat.</LD>
<LD>   Add to the list 45-year-old French executive Jean-Marie Messier.
He formally lost his job Tuesday as head of Vivendi Universal, known
for "The Mummy" films, TV shows such as "Law &amp; Order," Universal
Studios theme parks and a roster of top recording artists that
includes Eminem. Messier told his staff in a message he stepped down
"to restore peace and calm" at the company.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi joins a long list of scorched buyers, including Japanese
electronics manufacturers Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and Sony
Corp., Canada's Seagram Co. and Internet provider America Online
Inc., whose oversized ambitions about entertainment and technological
synergies crumbled because of bad planning, poor management or a
failure to figure out Hollywood's quirky business culture</TE>
<TE>   "Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose--the more things change,
the more they stay the same," said New York money manager Mario
Gabelli.</TE>
<TE>   Or, as Kaufman Bros. analyst Paul Kim put it, "It's another case
of a foreigner coming in like a drunk and overpaying for every
asset."</TE>
<TE>   The dramas usually play out for several years, which is why
Messier's downfall was unusually swift, coming just 19 tumultuous
months after Vivendi consummated a deal to buy Universal parent
Seagram. Indeed, until recently Messier insisted he would stay in the
job for as long as 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   At a May retreat in Orlando, Fla., Messier reminded executives
that his boyhood home was nestled in the French Alps. Messier
promised that even as company shareholders and directors were
mobilizing against him, he would "stand tall in strong winds," like
the mountain climbers he knew growing up.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Messier was buried under an avalanche of blunders. In the
message to his employees, Messier said, "Mistakes have been made, but
they can all be corrected; and that's what I had started to do."</TE>
<TE>   Messier talked a good game with his French-accented English. He
would tell anyone who would listen how he planned to move the staid
entertainment businesses of Universal Studios Inc. into an untethered
wireless world in which people could download Shania Twain's music or
scenes from "The Scorpion King" as easily as they dial a friend's
phone number.</TE>
<TE>   His decision to transform Vivendi, a staid French waste-management
and water company, into a synergistic entertainment and technology
company through a spending spree of more than $60 billion came the
day in January 2000 he learned that America Online was buying Time
Warner.</TE>
<TE>   Universal's entertainment operation of late has performed well,
with a stellar box-office year in 2001 and a music business that
dominates the charts.</TE>
<TE>   But Messier's larger vision required a huge leap of faith that few
investors were willing to make. They beat down the company's stock
price from the beginning of the deal, expressing frustration with
both the lack of a concrete strategy and the dearth of numbers that
conform to U.S. accounting standards.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, Messier continued to talk about telephones being
used for entertainment and Internet venture Vizzavi, a portal that
once was the cornerstone of his futuristic strategy but proved a
financial dud.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding Messier's problems was a combination of hubris and an
insatiable desire to promote himself.</TE>
<TE>   Messier wrote a 247-page autobiography published in 2000 in France
titled "J6M.com." That stood for "Jean-Marie Messier, Moi-Meme,
Maitre du Monde" or "Jean-Marie Messier, Me, Myself, Master of the
World." Although Messier insisted that the title was playful, critics
nonetheless said it captured what they see as an oversized ego.</TE>
<TE>   Messier continually irritated the French, once joking that his
homeland was "a small exotic country." He fired popular French TV
executive Pierre Lescure, head of Canal Plus, making the firing an
issue in France's presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Messier moved to New York and began referring to
himself as a New Yorker to tweak the French media.</TE>
<TE>   He did indeed launch himself energetically into the cultural and
civic life of his adopted city. In less than a year in Gotham,
Messier joined the board of the Whitney Museum of American Art and
reportedly is under consideration for a spot on the board of the
Metropolitan Opera.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Antoinette Messier, is a new board member of the New
York Philharmonic. Messier also became chairman of the media center
of the Museum of Television and Radio in New York.</TE>
<TE>   But Messier, like other corporate chieftains, was unable to
conquer the economics of media conglomeration and the notion of
synergies.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Inc. so far has yielded few synergies and rewards
for investors. The company announced a $54-billion loss in its last
quarter in what amounted to a dramatic concession that the deal
hasn't worked as planned.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sony is having a successful year at the box office, the
company has struggled for most of its 13 years in Hollywood to
smoothly run entertainment operations that include Columbia Pictures.
Sony has been burdened by management turmoil, big losses and gulfs in
the corporate cultures of its American executives and their Japanese
bosses. Sony's predecessor, soft drink giant Coca-Cola Co., thought
it could exploit its consumer marketing prowess with Columbia, but it
also couldn't make it work.</TE>
<TE>   Still, nowhere is the issue of outsiders more problematic than at
Universal, where three buyers in 12 years have owned the studio.</TE>
<TE>   Matsushita Electric Industrial in the early 1990s failed to mesh
its electronics operations with Universal's films, TV shows and
music.</TE>
<TE>   When Seagram took over in 1995, it wanted to move from slow-growth
operations such as beverages and investments in chemicals into
entertainment, especially music, that it envisioned would prove a
lucrative move when new technologies developed.</TE>
<TE>   Seagram scion Edgar Bronfman Jr., who oversaw the entertainment
operations as Seagram's chief executive, grew so disenchanted with
the risky, unpredictable entertainment business that he once called
Hollywood "a dumb town" in an interview. The Bronfmans sold Seagram
to Vivendi in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Messier also failed to show Wall Street he could mature from raw
deal maker to the kind of chief executive who could run an operation.
As he came under fire, Messier tried to appease investment
constituents in the U.S. and Europe, despite their vastly different
agendas.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. investors were wary of Messier's plunge into
telecommunications. They wanted him to shed Vivendi's
waste-management and water utility to focus on the entertainment
operations. European investors were skeptical of Messier's plunge
into Hollywood and the Americanization of his company, especially
after he moved to New York.</TE>
<TE>   "He was trying to straddle two worlds," money manager Gabelli
said.</TE>
<TE>   Messier also proved better at buying assets than running them,
adding such diverse holdings as publisher Houghton Mifflin Co. and
the MP3.com online music service, both of which investors questioned.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, he failed to manage Vivendi's increasing debt. That
became even more difficult amid a slowing economy and a
telecommunications industry free fall.</TE>
<TE>   The company spent $34 billion to buy Seagram and gain full control
of French TV giant Canal Plus. The debt level was exacerbated by the
$11-billion acquisition of the film and TV assets of Barry Diller's
USA Networks.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as the market was willing to lend, by buying bonds and
stock, it was OK," analyst Kim said.</TE>
<TE>   "But when the music stopped, they went into a death spiral, which
is where we are now."</TE>

<HD>Deal Would Let Northrop Branch Out</HD>
<DH>Defense: The firm's acquisition of TRW would enable it to
pursue contracts that span the military.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The proposed acquisition of TRW Corp. would bring Northrop Grumman
Corp. one step closer to creating a network of weapons and electronic
systems across all three military services, a feat that is at the
crux of the Bush administration's push to transform the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   With TRW, which agreed Monday to be acquired for $7.8 billion,
Northrop would have interests in virtually every sector of the
defense industry, offering everything from ships to satellites to
lasers to aircraft to computer networks.</LD>
<LD>   The breath of its businesses essentially would give Northrop elite
status among contractors able to provide "system of systems"
integration--a complex and lucrative task to oversee
multibillion-dollar defense contracts.</LD>
<TE>   Beyond strengthening Century City-based Northrop's position in the
defense industry, the TRW acquisition also would make it the leading
supplier of computer network services to the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   The combination of Northrop's and TRW's information technology
businesses would propel the combined company past Lockheed Martin
Corp. as the nation's largest provider of computer network systems
for the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   TRW Systems, based in Reston, Va., generates about $2 billion in
annual revenue and recently won a five-year, $650-million contract to
provide computer stations and supply management software to the Air
Force and the Pentagon. It developed and currently maintains the
database system for the Securities and Exchange Commission and is
helping to modernize the computer system for the Internal Revenue
Service.</TE>
<TE>   Through its acquisitions of Logicon, PRC and now Cleveland-based
TRW, Northrop would maintain many of the government's computer
systems, including the Web site for the White House and the networks
for the nation's most secret agencies, such as the National
Reconnaissance Organization.</TE>
<TE>   But Northrop's acquisition strategy in the last decade has aimed
at giving it a bigger role in defense, particularly in developing
systems that could be "inter-operable" among the military services.
The Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Army currently design and
develop weapons and communications systems separately.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed and Boeing Co., the nation's two largest defense
contractors, also have a wide range of products, but they are focused
mainly toward meeting the needs of a particular military service,
said Richard Aboulafia, a defense analyst for Teal Group.</TE>
<TE>   TRW essentially would give Northrop "the widest net of products
across all the services," Aboulafia said. And with such an arsenal,
Northrop would be able to meet its objective "to tie them all
together in a network."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Northrop's aspiration is summed up by an illustration
posted at its facilities, showing ships, aircraft, spy planes and
satellites linked by common electronic systems. Also known as
network-centric warfare, the term has been Northrop's mantra for
years.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop, which developed and manufactured the B-2 stealth bomber,
no longer focuses development on so-called platforms, or the
structures that make up an airplane, but on the electronic brains and
sensors that it believes will give the U.S. military significant
battlefield advantage.</TE>
<TE>   The addition of TRW would complete the transformation, analysts
said. It would give Northrop entry to growing areas of defense,
including missile defense, space-based weapons and space sensors. The
capability would help increase Northrop's ability to go after
large-scale system integration jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The deal also would elevate Northrop to playing a role as a prime
contractor in areas in which it has ranked only as a subcontractor.
For example, TRW is the prime contractor on developing the
Space-Based Infrared Low system of satellites that would orbit the
Earth looking for intercontinental ballistic missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, TRW would give Northrop its first major presence with
the Army. TRW currently is developing a battlefield identification
system for the Army that would help U.S. forces distinguish a "friend
from a foe." It also is helping the Army replace its communication
system.</TE>
<TE>   "Northrop will finally have the capability to mate the sensor
systems with TRW's expertise in battlefield command and control
systems," said James McAleese, a defense lawyer who has been advising
Northrop on the TRW acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop would make so many products that airmen, soldiers,
sailors and Marines would have hard time avoiding the brand. An
aircraft carrier built at Northrop's Newport News, Va., shipyard may
have aircraft whose major components were supplied by Northrop,
sailors logging onto computer networks developed by Northrop and
communication systems linked to satellites built by Northrop.</TE>
<TE>   "The synergy from these acquisitions will be more sublime than
obvious," said Paul H. Nisbet, a defense analyst for JSA Research
Inc. "It will happen as they pull together additional technology
capabilities they didn't have before."</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Too Big to Fail, Chief Says</HD>
<DH>Telecom: John Sidgmore asserts that the firm's survival is
a matter of economic and national security.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Discounting predictions that WorldCom Inc. might file
for bankruptcy protection, Chief Executive John W. Sidgmore said
Tuesday that the second-biggest U.S. long-distance telephone carrier
is too big to fail and that it remains a "key component of our
nation's economy and communications infrastructure."</LD>
<LD>   Sidgmore, in his most extensive public remarks since WorldCom
disclosed last week that it uncovered a major accounting fraud,
pledged full cooperation with federal regulators and said the company
is working with its lenders to avoid a bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<LD>   Late Tuesday, Newark, N.J.-based IDT Corp. made an unsolicited
offer to acquire WorldCom's long-distance and local telephone units
for $5 billion. WorldCom officials didn't immediately respond to the
offer.</LD>
<TE>   At an afternoon news conference at the National Press Club,
Sidgmore said he urged Federal Communications Commission Chairman
Michael K. Powell and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Harvey Pitt to support WorldCom's efforts to get its financial house
in order.</TE>
<TE>   The company last week named an independent investigator to look
into the accounting methods employed by fired Chief Financial Officer
Scott D. Sullivan, in which $3.9 billion in 2001 and the first
quarter of 2002 were wrongly listed as capital expenses to cover up
$1.2 billion in losses. Sidgmore vowed to release everything WorldCom
learns about the situation and to "clarify" an explanation of events
it gave to the SEC on Monday, which Pitt blasted as "inadequate."</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore also said WorldCom has enough cash on hand to fund its
operations through January.</TE>
<TE>   "We have over 60,000 employees and millions of investors,"
Sidgmore said. "Both commercial and national security interests rely
upon WorldCom's operations continuing without disruption."</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore's comments apparently encouraged some investors, who bid
the company's stock up to 10 cents, from 6 cents, after the news
conference began.</TE>
<TE>   But many analysts aren't convinced, believing that it may be only
a matter of time before WorldCom is forced to file for bankruptcy.
The company, based in Clinton, Miss., is saddled with about $30
billion in debt and Monday WorldCom's lenders declared the company in
default on $4.3 billion in credit.</TE>
<TE>   "Bankruptcy is clearly a possibility," said Blair Levin, an
analyst for Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. and a former chief of staff
for the Federal Communications Commission. WorldCom, he added, "is
clearly not too big to fail."</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities "have a real dilemma on their hands," added
Robert E. Litan, director of economic studies for the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Potential buyers of WorldCom assets, such as long-distance
carriers AT&amp;T Corp. and Sprint Corp., are "in a weak financial
position themselves, and there are antitrust and regulatory concerns"
about the financially stronger regional Bell telephone companies
buying a long-distance carrier, Litan said.</TE>
<TE>   IDT, which has been buying the assets of distressed
telecommunications companies, offered $2 billion for the MCI
long-distance division and $3 billion for WorldCom's MFS and Brooks
Fiber corporate local service. WorldCom executives have been seeking
at least $5 billion just for MCI. WorldCom paid $37 billion for MCI
in 1998, $12 billion for MFS in 1996 and $2.9 billion for Brooks in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law, financially distressed companies can choose to
discharge much of their debt and reorganize under Chapter 11 or
liquidate assets under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.</TE>
<TE>   But national security officials and federal regulators have grown
increasingly concerned about the consequences of a WorldCom
bankruptcy--or even a change in ownership of some of its critical
telecommunications assets, particularly its long-distance telephone
network, MCI, and UUNet, a WorldCom unit that carries more than half
the Internet's data traffic.</TE>
<TE>   An FCC advisor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
agency's staff was concerned that WorldCom might not be able to
financially maintain or find a suitable buyer for the critical
Internet data lines that UUNet operates.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the staff's feeling is that they [WorldCom] operate the
Internet backbone mostly for prestige," not profit, the advisor said.
"The concern is that no strong company will buy it or it will fall
into the hands of some foreign buyer," jeopardizing national
security.</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore said Tuesday that he is making "10 to 20 calls a day to
reassure customers" and prevent WorldCom from going under. And there
was some indication Tuesday that the effort was paying off.</TE>
<TE>   "We've talked to them three times today, and we feel they have the
right strategy to get through this," said Levi Berkowitz, chief
information officer for Vantanet, a Monsey, N.Y.-based data
networking consulting company that does business with WorldCom. "As
somebody who [depends on Internet] security, I don't believe the
current situation" will deteriorate, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld also discounted speculation that
WorldCom's financial problems might jeopardize communications
services the company provides the U.S. military.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's not [going] to be a problem," Rumsfeld told
reporters Tuesday. He said it was likely that services provided by
WorldCom under a multimillion-dollar contract would continue despite
its problems.</TE>
<TE>   But in an effort to unearth any remaining financial surprises,
Sidgmore said Tuesday that WorldCom is extending an internal
accounting investigation back to 1999. He said it may be forced to
repay a $2.65-billion loan after defaulting on bank agreements.</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore said he had no reason to suspect that Sullivan might be
misleading company officials and investors. But he said the company
has cut its ties with Sullivan. Sidgmore added that he had "no idea"
whether former CEO Bernard J. Ebbers knew of the irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore became CEO of WorldCom after Ebbers was ousted in April.
The executive is popular among employees, who view him as a smart and
candid manager. But they, and outside analysts, have been looking for
signs of whether he has the business and political acumen to lead the
company out of its accounting scandal.</TE>
<TE>   While some experts gave Sidgmore high marks for his press
conference Tuesday, they said he faces a challenging road ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "Washington is caught in the grips of a major corporate accounting
scandal in which no single CEO is likely to allay the fears of
regulators and those in Congress," said Erick Gustafson, director of
technology and communications policy for Citizens for a Sound
Economy, a Washington watchdog group active on federal tax and budget
policies.Also Tuesday, three more current or former WorldCom insiders
agreed to testify before the House Financial Services Committee on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's vice president for internal audit, Cynthia Cooper,
WorldCom audit committee chairman Max Bobbitt and Melvin Dick, once a
partner at WorldCom's former auditor Authur Andersen, have agreed to
appear. They will join Sidgmore, Chairman Bert Roberts and Salomon
Smith Barney telecommunications analyst Jack Grubman at the first
congressional hearings into the matter.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>If Monday's ouster of flamboyant Chairman and Chief Executive
Jean-Marie Messier was meant to calm the turmoil at Vivendi
Universal, it didn't work.</LD>
<LD>   Bond downgrades by rating firms Moody's Investors Service and
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. sparked near-panic selling in Paris, where
Vivendi shares plunged 25% Tuesday to a 15-year low--the lowest since
the October 1987 market crash. The S&amp;P report indicated Vivendi's
financial obligations this year could be $3 billion higher than many
analysts had expected.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, investors were less concerned about the media
conglomerate's fuzzy strategic focus and management woes than its
ability to survive a severe cash crunch.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi's new management now must negotiate at a disadvantage with
the big European banks that control the company's future and with
potential buyers of properties that may need to be sold more quickly
than originally planned, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   After a two-year buying spree, Vivendi Universal has amassed a
debt of $30 billion, about half of it in media and communications.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the company's signature properties could go on the block,
analysts said, including Universal Studios, Universal Music, French
pay-TV unit Canal Plus and French wireless-phone company Cegetel.</TE>
<TE>   The company has scheduled a board meeting in Paris today, during
which directors are expected to address the liquidity crisis and the
appointment of Messier's successor. The top candidate is said to be
Jean-Rene Fourtou, 63, vice chairman of the French-German drug firm
Aventis.</TE>
<TE>   But there are more immediate problems. While Moody's dropped
Vivendi's credit rating to junk-bond status, S&amp;P sliced it to one
notch above junk, with the explicit warning that the rating "would be
lowered several notches" if the company does not secure "significant
refinancing within the next few weeks."</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P said Vivendi might have to come up with $6 billion to cover
financial obligations this year.</TE>
<TE>   That's nearly double what the market was expecting, said Mark
Harrington, an influential investor with J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. in London,
who added that he was concerned about the company's ability to meet
its short-term cash needs in the wake of the ratings downgrades.</TE>
<TE>   The discrepancy was due mostly to various contingency payments
that analysts had not factored into their calculations, including
stock put options for company employees, he said. Under such options,
the company agrees to buy back shares from the employees when they
fall below a certain price.</TE>
<TE>   "The market was taking the view that Vivendi would find a way to
postpone these payments," Harrington said. "There was little clarity
on when these puts would be exercised."</TE>
<TE>   The downgrades caused concern among analysts that Vivendi's
lenders would cut off day-to-day financing.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi said last month it had 3.3 billion euros in credit
available to cover its cash needs. That has since fallen to just 2.3
billion euros, according to a source familiar with the matter. The
company drew down 500 million euros to pay off a loan related to its
publishing business and pulled another 500 million euros in
anticipation that lenders may not be willing to negotiate a new
standby line of credit.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an increased risk of a liquidation or bankruptcy
scenario," the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of French bank BNP Paribas, one of Vivendi's leading
creditors, posted their biggest drop in 3 1/2 years Tuesday over
concerns that Vivendi may not be able to repay money owed to French
banks.</TE>
<TE>   The ratings downgrades "will increase their costs of borrowing and
it will increase the urgency to dispose of things," said Dennis
Leibowitz, a money manager with Act II Partners in New York City and
an investor in the company.</TE>
<TE>   However, Leibowitz does not think the company is facing an
imminent crisis. "They have plenty of marketable properties" to cover
their obligations, Leibowitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi spokeswoman Anita Larsen said the company had no response
to the credit agency reports and added that Vivendi stood by a
previous statement that it has enough credit to meet its cash
obligations for the year. She said Vivendi had renegotiated covenants
with lenders so any credit rating drops would not trigger accelerated
loan repayments.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the stampede out of Vivendi shares in the Paris stock
market stemmed from a story in the French newspaper Le Monde that
implied the company had used an accounting trick to boost earnings.
Le Monde said Vivendi may have sought to increase profits improperly
by adding income from its stake in Rupert Murdoch's British Sky
Broadcasting, or BskyB.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi quickly denied that, however, saying that the accounting
treatment had passed muster with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The market carnage was less severe in New York, where Vivendi sank
$4.69, or 21%, on NYSE, to $17.76.</TE>
<TE>   For all the punishment Vivendi is taking on Wall Street, the
company's underlying operating results have been fairly solid.The
company did record the largest loss in French corporate history last
year, reflecting steep losses in the value of its acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   That aside, Vivendi Universal posted healthy results last year,
mostly on the strength of Universal Studios, which had record box
office results, and Universal Music Group, the world's largest music
company. The company's European telecom business also helped the
bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   The outlook for this year, however, is more uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's telecom business has also slowed and Universal Studios
has a thinner slate of movies this year and isn't likely to repeat
its success of a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest drains on Vivendi's bottom line have been the
company's pay-TV arm, Canal Plus, which has struggled because of the
rising costs of sports programming and the now-worthless European
Internet portal Vizzavi, a joint venture with Vodafone.</TE>
<TE>   Significantly, both businesses were cornerstones of Messier's
failed strategy to marry American media content--Universal movies,
music and games--with European distribution.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Chuck Philips also contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>A Player in Every Sense?</HD>
<DH>Steve Bing--involved in two paternity cases-- finances
films, donates to political causes as well as charities and, oh yes,
has an eye for the ladies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL ABRAMOWITZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even by Hollywood's inflated standards, the gala benefiting the
Natural Resources Defense Council in May was a glittering event. Tom
Hanks emceed. Steve Martin performed. And the Wadsworth Theater
crowd, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Dustin Hoffman, roared
appreciatively.</LD>
<LD>   The evening, which raised $1.6 million for one of Hollywood's pet
environmental causes, was capped by a keynote speech by former
President Clinton. Sitting next to Clinton all evening was a rangy
figure, seldom seen at charity events but crucial in the council's
effort to get the former president to attend. During his remarks,
Clinton made sure to thank the man--Steve Bing--for playing host to
him in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Bing?</LD>
<TE>   Until eight months ago, few in the audience, save for friends like
director Rob Reiner or Warner Bros. President Alan Horn, would have
recognized Bing's name. Now, almost everyone in Hollywood knows him.</TE>
<TE>   Bing, an heir to an estimated $600-million real estate fortune,
had become involved in two highly publicized paternity cases. In one,
he sued British actress Elizabeth Hurley to force a DNA test after
she said he was the father of her baby. In the other, he sued Kirk
Kerkorian for invasion of privacy after the billionaire's private eye
took Bing's dental floss out of his trash can. Kerkorian, embroiled
in a child support lawsuit with his ex-wife, wanted to collect DNA to
prove that Bing was the father of his wife's daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Bing has not welcomed the attention. In addition to suing Hurley
and Kerkorian, his attorneys have filed libel actions against
tabloids in England and the U.S., attempting to beat back the
paparazzi who tail him.</TE>
<TE>   But the press-shy 37-year-old scion is fast acquiring a
Gatsby-esque allure and notoriety. He is putting the finishing
touches on a deal with Warner Bros. that would in effect make him a
one-man mini-studio under the Warner umbrella, giving him a
distribution system for eight films he will personally finance.</TE>
<TE>   And although his gift was not publicized, Bing is the largest
donor in Natural Resources Defense Council history, having pledged a
year ago more than $10 million over four years to build a climate
center to focus attention in the United States on global warming.</TE>
<TE>   Now unmistakably on the map as a high-profile Hollywood libertine,
he is a man dedicated apparently in equal measures to philanthropy,
politics and women. Which makes him an object of envy and of
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Bing declined to comment. But two dozen of his friends and
colleagues who agreed to talk describe an affable, 6-foot-4 former
jock who tools around town in a '97 Lincoln, wearing jeans and ratty
T-shirts, or occasionally a garish Hawaiian shirt. A determined
bachelor, he lives in a small two-bedroom home in Bel-Air but has
bought the seven adjoining houses with the intention of knocking them
down and creating palatial grounds. He's a fan of strip clubs, has
been a high roller in Las Vegas for years, and yet he can discuss the
dense Robert Caro biography of Lyndon Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Twice a week, he rents a Beverly Hills screening room and projects
old films for his range of pals, who include Dominic "Donny Shacks"
Montemarano, a felon and onetime capo in the Mafia; shopping mall
magnate Ron Burkle; such Hollywood fixtures as Reiner, Warren Beatty
and William Goldman; and Dodger Chairman Bob Daly. He has an almost
filial relationship with actor James Caan.</TE>
<TE>   He dates prodigiously. Playboy playmates. Movie stars. "He's an
equal-opportunity employer," one friend says with a laugh. "Girls are
all over him."</TE>
<TE>   His lifestyle makes him almost a caricature of what critics of
Hollywood excess imagine goes on here. But to his admirers, there is
much to covet. Screenwriter Scott Rosenberg, a friend and former
writing partner, says, "My buddies back in Boston have the right
attitude--this guy's awesome."</TE>
<TE>   Befriending His Idols</TE>
<TE>   Bing's ability to enchant older men seems to have facilitated his
entree into Hollywood. On the tennis court of one of his Beverly
Hills neighbors, he made his first contacts, including Castle Rock
partner Andy Scheinman, director Garry Marshall and Caan. Caan
enlisted the athletic teenager to help him coach his son's T-ball
team and introduced him to the Playboy mansion.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve's gotten to meet all his heroes growing up--Mick Jagger,
Warren Beatty, William Goldman, Hugh Hefner, James Caan. They all
call him their friend now. Who among us gets to meet our childhood
idols and get them to befriend us?" Rosenberg says.</TE>
<TE>   Bing's money comes from his grandfather Leo, who built luxury
apartment houses in New York 80 years ago. His father, Dr. Peter
Bing, worked on public health issues for the Johnson White House
before relocating to Los Angeles, where he attends to the family
business.</TE>
<TE>   The family has appeared on the Forbes list of the 400 richest
Americans. Although the Bing name is not as well-known as Chandler or
Broad, California is dotted with evidence of the family's generosity,
from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Leo S. Bing Theater to an
array of programs at Stanford University, where Peter Bing used to be
chairman of the board of trustees.</TE>
<TE>   Before he finished high school at the Harvard-Westlake School,
Bing had already co-written his first screenplay, "Missing in
Action," with veteran sitcom writer Arthur Silver. It was made into a
Chuck Norris film and spawned a sequel.</TE>
<TE>   Bing, who inherited his fortune on his 18th birthday, dropped out
of Stanford in his junior year to pursue filmmaking. He directed an
erotic thriller titled "Every Breath," starring Judd Nelson, which
went straight to video. Over the next decade, Bing sold a number of
pitches to studios, almost all of which wound up in development hell.</TE>
<TE>   One, however, did well. The script, called "Down and Under," was
inspired by a story Bing heard as a teenager. It's about a pair of
childhood friends who are charged with taking mob money to Australia
but lose it to a kangaroo. The pitch sparked a major bidding war, and
it garnered Bing and co-screenwriter Rosenberg a $1.4-million payday
from Disney and producer Jerry Bruckheimer. The film debuts from
Warner Bros. early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Bruckheimer, like many who have met Bing socially, initially had
no idea how wealthy Bing was. "He never talks about his money,"
Bruckheimer said. "Unless someone told you, you'd never know who the
Bing family was. He tries everything to hide that."</TE>
<TE>   Although he eschewed de rigueur L.A. status symbols like BMWs, in
the early '90s Bing moved into the Hotel Bel-Air one night ... and
stayed for nine years.</TE>
<TE>   Known as a sugar daddy, Bing apparently takes pleasure in generous
gestures that go far beyond dinner and shows.</TE>
<TE>   When Montemarano, a pal Bing had cast in his independent film
"Night at the Golden Eagle," was accused of domestic violence, a
situation that threatened his parole, the multimillionaire not only
paid for his defense but also the lawyer for the woman who accused
him. When Hurley got in trouble with the Screen Actors Guild for
working during last year's commercial strike, Bing paid her
six-figure legal bill. She ultimately got off with a small fine.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, Hurley announced that she was pregnant and that
Bing was the father. He issued a news release saying that they had
not been in an exclusive relationship and that it was "her choice to
be a single mother." Tabloids in Britain, where Hurley lives,
variously labeled him "Bing Laden" and a "spermicidal maniac."</TE>
<TE>   According to a knowledgeable source in the Bing camp, the
multimillionaire had asked Hurley to terminate the pregnancy and she
refused. He then asked her to go to counseling with him to discuss
how to proceed, and again she refused. When she went public with the
story, he stopped talking to her, except when she called him with
condolences about the Kerkorian dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Hurley, through her representative, declined to comment. But
Bing's family remains outraged by how he's been depicted in the
media.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some sort of hysterical vilifying of the man. It's like
'Disclosure,' " says his sister Mary Bing, a 35-year-old social
worker in New York City, referring to the Michael Crichton book in
which a woman falsely accuses a man of sexual harassment. "No one is
holding the women accountable for their behavior. The only way he can
really defend himself is to say bad things about the women, and he
doesn't want to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Political Contributions</TE>
<TE>   Director-activist Rob Reiner, another childhood friend, initiated
Bing into politics, inviting him to the first fund-raiser for
Proposition 10, held five years ago at the home of Ron Burkle.
According to public records, Bing contributed $3.5 million to support
and defend the 1998 initiative that imposed a 50-cent-per-pack tax on
cigarettes to fund child-care and anti-tobacco programs for
preschoolers.</TE>
<TE>   Bing last week agreed to a $25,000 settlement with the Fair
Political Practices Commission for filing his required contribution
report late; he now has a professional attending to these affairs.</TE>
<TE>   In the last election cycle he gave more than $700,000 to
Democratic candidates, according to data kept by the Center for
Responsive Politics in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   On the night of the 2000 general election, Reiner called Bing from
Al Gore's Nashville headquarters when it became apparent the
Democrats would call for a recount. Bing immediately committed
$200,000 to the recount effort.</TE>
<TE>   Reiner and Warner Bros. President Alan Horn also introduced Bing
to the Natural Resources Defense Council.</TE>
<TE>   "He first got involved with us during the Clinton years," says
council spokesman Alan Metrick. "He was frustrated that not enough
attention was paid to the issue of global warming. Stephen Bing gets
it, and he's about to do something about it."</TE>
<TE>   Bing also pledged $25 million to Stanford University in the last
year, a Stanford spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   One casualty of his recent unwanted publicity has been the UCLA
school of medicine, the former recipient of millions in Bing largess.
He quit giving after UCLA honored Rupert Murdoch, who owns some of
the tabloids following Bing's story.</TE>
<TE>   Bing and Burkle, a well-connected Clinton supporter, are
particularly close. According to several sources, the pair are
contributing $1 million to a project called Democracy Corps, in which
Democratic pollsters provide sensitive polling and message crafting
for Democratic congressmen free of charge. Reiner, Horn and Burkle
all declined to comment, citing Bing's privacy concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Until his recent appearance in the tabloids, Bing's donations were
made anonymously and kept private.</TE>
<TE>   The notable exception has been his growing relationship with the
Democratic Party, which was heralded in newspapers this spring when
Democratic Party Chairman Terry McAuliffe announced that Bing had
agreed to contribute $5 million to help update voter outreach
programs. It was the second-biggest gift ever to the Democratic
Party.</TE>
<TE>   Politics have had indirect dividends also. Horn, Bing's partner in
liberal causes, helped craft the deal that made Bing part of Warner
Bros. Bing will personally finance eight films, and Warner Bros. will
distribute them. It's part of Warner Bros.' corporate strategy to
make its vast distribution network generate extra cash, and it has
several similar "rent-a-studio" deals.</TE>
<TE>   Bing, whose producing credits include the unreleased independent
film "Without Charlie" and the Sylvester Stallone picture "Get
Carter," has told associates that he isn't interested in art films
but rather in mainstream fare with budgets of at least $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   As foreign sources of financing dry up, Hollywood seems eager to
embrace a cash-rich producer.</TE>
<TE>   "Does he want to finance my company?" jokes studio
chief-turned-producer Mark Canton, who in the past has bought several
of Bing's projects.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two weeks, the two paternity cases that put Bing in
the public eye finally appeared to be heading toward resolution. An
English court revealed that Bing indeed was the father of Hurley's
baby, and Bing and Kerkorian's lawyers announced that the two men had
resolved their differences.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, he vowed to be a responsible parent if found to be
the father. Now, according to the Bing camp, he is distraught that he
might have only limited access to his son with Hurley, particularly
if she continues to live in England. If the Kerkorian child proves to
be his, Bing will have no access to her--unless Kerkorian and
Kerkorian's ex-wife Lisa Bonder permit it.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because he hasn't found the woman he wants to spend the rest
of his life with doesn't mean he's a deadbeat dad," his sister says.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even his friends don't expect to hear Bing wedding bells
any time soon. "Obviously, he has a little trouble with commitment,"
Rosenberg says with a laugh. "There's nothing more spectacularly
noncommittal than living in a hotel."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, what appears to be a prime importance to Bing these days
is his script for "Why Men Shouldn't Marry." The
philanthropist-political activist-writer-producer plans to direct
this tale about a man who's been through a horrible divorce and
becomes an anti-marriage guru. Unlike real life, it has a happy
Hollywood ending. It becomes a postcard to love and marriage.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>BUENOS AIRES -- President Eduardo Duhalde on Tuesday moved up
presidential elections by six months to March, saying he wanted to
boost international confidence in efforts to resolve Argentina's
economic crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Duhalde said that fast-forwarding the vote, originally set for
September 2003, would help restore order to Argentina, whose economy
has been in recession for four years.</LD>
<LD>   "We will reinsert ourselves into the international community. We
are very close to concluding a long negotiation" with the
International Monetary Fund, Duhalde said of talks with the lending
agency.</LD>
<TE>   Duhalde is lobbying the IMF for $18 billion in credit to repay
debt owed to lenders this year and next. The Washington-based lending
agency said Tuesday that it was preparing to send several teams to
Argentina to study support for the tottering economy.</TE>
<TE>   In an address lasting less than five minutes, Duhalde announced
only the barest outline of his election timetable. He said the
presidential primary would be called within 120 days.</TE>
<TE>   It was not immediately clear whether the elections would be only
for the presidency and vacant vice presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde was named by Congress on Jan. 1 to serve as caretaker
president amid political turmoil following President Fernando de la
Rua's resignation in December.</TE>

security chief, Jibril Rajoub, and the Gaza Strip police chief, Ghazi
Jibali, in a step toward reforming his security services, officials
said.</LD>
<TE>   Rajoub has been one of the most powerful figures in the West Bank
but has had a falling-out with Arafat. In April, Israeli forces
destroyed Rajoub's headquarters. He ordered the men inside to
surrender, causing them to lose face among many Palestinians.</TE>

talks with North Korea, U.S. officials said, four days after North
Korean naval vessels fired on South Korean patrol boats, killing four
sailors.</LD>
<TE>   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said U.S. officials
informed North Korea's United Nations mission Monday that a proposed
meeting next Wednesday in Pyongyang, the North's capital, was off
because North Korea had failed to confirm the date. But Boucher
acknowledged that the attack "had created an unacceptable atmosphere
in which to conduct the talks" on issues such as missile sales,
security on the Korean peninsula and nuclear inspections.</TE>

<HD>Peace Missions Are Put in Doubt</HD>
<DH>Policy: U.S. appears ready to stymie U.N. efforts worldwide
unless Americans are exempted from prosecution by a new international
court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>To the open dismay of its allies, the United States appeared prepared
Tuesday to paralyze U.N. peacekeeping operations from the Middle East
to Central Africa unless it secures a guarantee that American
personnel will be protected from the new International Criminal
Court--a condition that backers of the court consider legally and
politically untenable.</LD>
<LD>   U.N. officials and foreign diplomats are uncertain about both the
long-term implications of the U.S. stance as well as its motivation.
Washington has rejected back-room suggestions here that it simply
withdraw from U.N. peacekeeping missions, few of which have more than
a handful of American participants.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials here have told reporters and foreign diplomats in
recent weeks that Washington wants to retain the option of
participating in U.N. peacekeeping but cannot do so unless its
demands for immunity are met--and it is therefore prepared, if
necessary, to block peacekeeping missions that do not provide these
guarantees.</LD>
<TE>   After vetoing a routine extension of two U.N. peacekeeping
missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Sunday, U.S. diplomats proposed a
new Security Council resolution Tuesday that would exempt from court
"investigations or prosecutions" of all current, former and future
peacekeepers from countries, such as the United States, that haven't
signed the treaty establishing the court.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. resolution broadly interprets language in the treaty
allowing the Security Council to halt specific court proceedings for
up to a year and would require perpetual, 12-month deferrals of any
court action related to U.S. peacekeepers. Richard Dicker, an
official of Human Rights Watch, which strongly supports the court,
says the treaty never envisioned that kind of role for the Security
Council.</TE>
<TE>   Britain and France are expected to strongly resist the new U.S.
proposal when it comes up for debate today at the Security Council.
Both U.S. allies have veto power on the council and strongly oppose
special provisions exempting any peacekeepers from the court's
jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   The Europeans long have understood U.S. objections to the
international court but have been surprised by the hardening of the
Bush administration's position in the wake of the court's entry into
legal force Monday.</TE>
<TE>   With the council still deadlocked over the American demands, the
United Nations began planning to end its police-training program in
Bosnia today, and nervously contemplated the future of equally
sensitive U.N. missions elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Missions Up for Renewal</TE>
<TE>   Four U.N. missions are slated for renewal this month--in Lebanon,
Georgia, Western Sahara and the Prevlaka enclave in Croatia. Jeremy
Greenstock, Britain's U.N. ambassador and the current president of
the Security Council, said Tuesday that most council members "do not
want to go through this agony every time a new peacekeeping operation
comes up."</TE>
<TE>   European allies and some former U.S. diplomats criticized the Bush
administration's confrontational strategy, but President Bush
reiterated his adamant opposition to the new court Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll try to work out the impasse at the United Nations," Bush
said. "But one thing we're not going to do is sign on to the
International Criminal Court."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer
called the U.S. stance here "a vital matter of principle." The U.N.
talks "are difficult," he acknowledged, and "it's impossible to
predict what their outcome will be."</TE>
<TE>   Court Popular in Europe</TE>
<TE>   European officials said the administration misjudged the depth of
their commitment to the new court, assuming wrongly that British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and French President Jacques Chirac would
eventually give in to U.S. pressure. The court is genuinely popular
in Europe, they said, perhaps because it is not controlled by the
United States, the sole global superpower. In Britain, moreover, the
Labor Party could face a rebellion in its ranks if Blair is perceived
to support a go-it-alone U.S. foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. commitment to its position was equally misjudged by
the Europeans, diplomats say.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans thought they could convince us, but they did not
prevail, just like we thought we could convince them and did not
prevail," said Ole Peter Kolby, Norway's U.N. ambassador, after the
inconclusive council debate Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   China and Russia, the other two permanent veto-wielding members of
the Security Council, might appear more vulnerable to war crimes
prosecutions, but both have supported the European position in the
dispute and profess to be unconcerned by possible court infringement
on their sovereignty. China, however, has not signed the treaty
establishing the international court.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's concerns about protecting U.S. troops abroad reflect a
strong consensus in the defense establishment and in Congress, said
Alton Frye, a senior fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations in
Washington. Even U.S. officials who might privately question
administration tactics in opposing the international court share the
view that Americans stationed abroad are vulnerable to politically
motivated prosecutions, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a rising sentiment here that predates the Bush
administration, but that has now taken deeper root, that there should
a deeper appreciation in the international community of the
expectations and pressures that we face," Frye said. "The view is
that we do the heavy lifting, and we should not expose the people who
do the heavy lifting to special burdens."</TE>
<TE>   East Timor Withdrawal</TE>
<TE>   There are currently few U.S. personnel in U.N. peacekeeping
missions, and the administration had already said that it was not
planning to have any U.S. troops don the blue helmets of official
U.N. forces.</TE>
<TE>   With the withdrawal this week of three U.S. observers attached to
the U.N. mission in East Timor--a move prompted by the Security
Council's refusal last month to grant them protection from the
International Criminal Court--there are now 30 U.S. observers in U.N.
peacekeeping operations now in place around the world. The United
States also participates in U.N.-led police-training teams in East
Timor and Kosovo, as well as Bosnia.</TE>
<TE>   Countries that routinely send peacekeepers to trouble spots around
the world resent the notion that American troops are uniquely
vulnerable to war crimes accusations.</TE>
<TE>   "This problem is a shared problem, affecting everyone involved
with these missions," said Richard Ryan, the U.N. representative from
Ireland, a Security Council member and a long-standing contributor to
U.N. peacekeeping operations. Ireland now has 60 soldiers stationed
on the Lebanese border in a mission that is up for renewal this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats note that Dutch soldiers deployed in Bosnia under U.N.
auspices were accused of complicity in the 1995 massacre of thousands
of Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica. In Somalia a decade ago,
Belgian, Italian and Canadian peacekeepers were charged with various
offenses, including the torture and killing of adolescent combatants.</TE>
<TE>   "When Canadian peacekeepers in Somalia committed serious
atrocities, they were investigated and prosecuted at home," said
Fiona McKay, an expert on the court at the Lawyers Committee for
Human Rights.</TE>
<TE>   "That is what will happen to peacekeepers from countries with
functioning legal systems. That is how the ICC intends it to happen,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Though efforts are underway to get the European Union to take over
a 1,600-member U.N. police training unit in Bosnia, and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization can theoretically assume legal control
of the 18,000-strong peacekeeping force it is already commanding in
the field, the unexpected transition will be costly and disruptive,
U.N. officials said. After an emergency 72-hour extension, the
official U.N. mandate for the missions is due to end tonight at
midnight EDT.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not suggest that you should raise your hopes that there will
be a solution of the problem" before the midnight deadline,
Greenstock advised reporters after the council met Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Russian Airliner Had 50-Second Warning to Avoid Fatal
Collision</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Officials trade charges over who was to blame for
crash that killed 71 over Germany.</DH>

<DL>UEBERLINGEN, Germany</DL>
<LD>A chartered Russian airliner had less than a minute's warning before
slamming into a cargo plane over southern Germany, killing 71 people,
including 52 children headed for a beach vacation in Spain,
authorities said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Swiss air traffic control, which was in charge of the flight paths
of both planes involved in the Monday night crash, initially said
that it had given the Tupolev-154 nearly two minutes' notice and that
the pilot did not begin descending to avoid the DHL cargo jet until a
third request.</LD>
<LD>   The Swiss revised their account after the German government agency
in charge of investigating air accidents said that the Russian pilot
was given only about 50 seconds' warning to change altitude and that
he reacted after a second notice.</LD>
<TE>   In this lakeside resort town and in nearby areas, residents
recounted the horror of hearing a sound like rolling thunder, then
watching flames, airplane parts and bodies fall from the sky. On
Tuesday evening, about 400 people attended a memorial service at
Ueberlingen's 16th century Cathedral of St. Nicholas.</TE>
<TE>   In the Russian republic of Bashkir, families who had last seen
their children Saturday before the flight to Moscow were in shock.
They blamed their loss on the last-minute mix-up that caused the
children to miss their originally scheduled flight.</TE>
<TE>   "If only they had flown on time, none of this would have
happened," the mother of Bulat Biglov, one of the victims, said
through tears on Russia's NTV network. She was not identified by
name.</TE>
<TE>   Swiss and Russian officials, meanwhile, continued to trade charges
over who was to blame.</TE>
<TE>   Anton Maag, chief of the control tower at the Zurich airport in
Switzerland, said the initial warning about a minute before the crash
was "cutting it close but absolutely acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Nikolai Odegov, director of Russia's Bashkirian Airlines, denied
that the crew of its Tupolev had made any mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "My theory is that it is the fault of the air traffic
controllers," Odegov said in Moscow. "They put the planes on the same
path."</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials also rejected the idea that the Tupolev's pilots
might have had insufficient English skills.</TE>
<TE>   "The version that the plane ignored the instructions sounds mad to
all of us here. This simply cannot be the case because it could never
happen," said Sergei V. Rybanov, another Bashkirian Airlines
official. "These pilots were no kamikazes. They knew full well what a
precious cargo they were carrying, and they would never on Earth risk
the lives of the children they had on board."</TE>
<TE>   The children, most between 8 and 16, were mainly from the
political elite of the oil-rich, predominantly Muslim republic of
Bashkir. Russia's Interfax news agency said 27 of the victims were
the sons and daughters of high-ranking officials in the Bashkir
government.</TE>
<TE>   "Their trip was an ordinary summertime trip ... to get some sea
air, to swim in the sea and bathe in the sun," said Tatyana Y.
Ostapenko, 55, director general of the Soglasiye travel agency in
Moscow, which booked the flight. "They were scheduled to leave last
Saturday, but they missed their original flight to Spain. One of our
staffers took them to a wrong airport....But we managed to sort the
problem out--at least so we thought back then."</TE>
<TE>   She added: "They were happy to be going, and just a couple of
hours from then it turned into the worst nightmare in their lives.
The worst and the last."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the wreckage landed in residential areas but apparently
caused no injuries, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is nearly a miracle that there were no casualties on the
ground," Kurt Bodewig, Germany's transportation minister, said at a
news conference here.</TE>
<TE>   Police in helicopters scoured the area in search of debris and
bodies. The tail section of the Tupolev landed in a field about half
a mile from the nearest houses, and the main wreckage of the DHL
Airways Boeing 757 cargo plane landed in woods about five miles from
Ueberlingen.</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday afternoon, 800 police officers and 540 volunteers had
recovered 26 bodies, including those of the two DHL pilots. The
flight data and cockpit voice recorders for both planes, which are
vital for crash investigation, also were found, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The German account of the accident said the Russian pilot changed
course about 25 seconds before the collision 35,000 feet over Lake
Constance. About the same moment that the Russian plane began
descending, the DHL plane also cut its altitude, apparently in
response to its on-board collision-avoidance system.</TE>
<TE>   The two planes thus flew into each other as both tried to avoid a
crash.</TE>
<TE>   The planes were over Germany, but they had been passed over to
Swiss air traffic control shortly before the accident because they
were flying through an area on the approach to the Zurich airport.
Only one Swiss air traffic controller was monitoring traffic, which
was so light that his partner was taking a break, said Maag, the
Zurich control tower chief.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities described the single controller as experienced but
said he was being treated for shock Tuesday and had not been
immediately questioned.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Herr, a spokesman for Swiss air traffic control, said the
investigation should concentrate on two issues: Why didn't the
Russian pilot respond immediately to the first warning? And why did
the Boeing's automatic alarm call for the plane to descend rather
than climb?</TE>
<TE>   The situation that led to the crash "cannot have developed within
several seconds," said Georg Fongern, head of Cockpit, the German
pilots organization.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally we count on five to 10 minutes for two planes heading
for a planned crossing of their flight paths to be separated,"
Fongern said. "Of course we must ask why the two planes were not
brought apart earlier....All four partners--two flight control units
and two crews--must be investigated on how this could have happened."</TE>
<TE>   Swiss air traffic controllers took over responsibility for the DHL
plane about 11:23 p.m. and for the Russian plane about 11:30 p.m. The
collision came just after 11:35 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The need for the hand-over from German to Swiss control reflects
Europe's fragmented traffic control system, which the European Union
is trying to unify. But air traffic controllers have protested that
such a step would risk safety and cost jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The system has been criticized as inefficient but has not
generally been seen as responsible for accidents.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian plane was headed from Moscow to Barcelona, Spain, and
the cargo plane was en route to Brussels from Bahrain, after a
stopover in Bergamo, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Officials hoped to organize a direct flight for the victims'
relatives from Bashkir, in Russia's southern Ural Mountains, to
Germany in the next few days, Odegov said.</TE>
<TE>   Russian television showed scenes of weeping and distraught parents
filling out emergency visa applications to travel to Germany.</TE>

<HD>18 Americans Barred From Entering Israel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israel barred 18 Americans from entering the country and put them on
a flight back to the United States on Tuesday as part of a policy of
denying entry to foreigners who want to show solidarity with
Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   The Americans arrived at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International
Airport on Monday with the aim of going to the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip, Interior Ministry spokeswoman Tova Ellison said.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. group included naturalized citizens born in Pakistan,
Egypt and Iraq, she said. Two members of the U.S. group were granted
entry because they have dual Israeli citizenship. A British citizen
traveling with the Americans was put on a flight back to Britain.</LD>
<TE>   "They wanted to show solidarity with the Palestinians," Ellison
said. "The state of Israel is in a state of war at the moment, and no
other country would allow its enemies or those who support its
enemies to enter."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Embassy said it was checking into the matter and did not
immediately comment. U.S. citizens normally receive a 90-day tourist
visa upon arrival in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Ellison said Israel began denying entry to supporters of the
Palestinian Authority in March. Since then, about 120 foreigners have
been expelled from Israel and more than 200 have been denied entry,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Interior Ministry does not allow and will not allow entry to
those who come to support terror and the people who want to hurt the
state of Israel," the Interior Ministry said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Israel barred a group of 20 U.S. Muslims from entering
the country. In another case, eight foreigners, among them a
Jordanian journalist and two U.S. citizens, were expelled after
troops caught them in the Balata refugee camp in the West Bank making
a solidarity visit with Palestinians.</TE>

<HD>Historic Hearing Delves Into Mexico's Violent, Secretive
Past</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Two years ago, Mexican voters toppled a party that had reigned for
seven decades through a series of presidents who gave up dictatorial
powers every six years in return for untouchable retirement. Not
since 1934 had anyone tried to hold them legally accountable for a
misdeed.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, that taboo also fell--a victim of President Vicente
Fox's drive to make Mexico a more just and open society after decades
of official impunity and obsessive secrecy.</LD>
<LD>   Luis Echeverria Alvarez, who ruled Mexico from 1970 to 1976,
obeyed a summons to hear a prosecutor read a 3 1/2-hour-long
complaint from a citizens group alleging that he helped direct modern
Mexico's most infamous peacetime massacre.</LD>
<TE>   Then the 80-year-old recluse faced three hours of questions about
the shooting, in which as many as 300 student demonstrators died Oct.
2, 1968, in the Mexico City neighborhood of Tlatelolco.</TE>
<TE>   Echeverria was the minister in charge of Mexico's internal
security at the time. Witnesses at the closed hearing, which launched
the prosecutor's investigation into the complaint, said he sat
rigidly and listened silently, wincing at times.</TE>
<TE>   He won a 40-day recess to prepare written answers to the
allegations, which include genocide and crimes against humanity.</TE>
<TE>   The former president also faces complaints that he ordered the
deadly suppression of a 1971 student march and helped lead a
never-acknowledged "dirty war" in which at least 275 suspected
guerrillas disappeared between the late 1960s and the early '80s.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, he has shrugged off the charges, saying, "My
conscience is clear."</TE>
<TE>   But Ignacio Carrillo Prieto, the special prosecutor appointed by
Fox, is investigating that violent period--aided by a new freedom of
information law and the declassifying last month of millions of
Mexican secret-police files dating from 1952 through 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Although no former top official has gone to trial, Fox's campaign
for a more open society is one of the most striking changes of a
19-month-old administration that is widely criticized for faltering
on other promised reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Echeverria's summons came on the second anniversary of Fox's
electoral triumph over the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI.</TE>
<TE>   After Tuesday's session, the former president was ordered
to appear again next week to hear the accusations about the 1971 march,
in which paramilitary gunmen killed at least 30 students.</TE>
<TE>   PRI crackdowns on dissent were ruthlessly effective, although not
as bloody or large-scale as those carried out by some of Latin
America's military regimes.</TE>
<TE>   While calling itself a democracy and harboring leftists fleeing
other countries, Mexico controlled its foes with an array of weapons
that included wiretapping, torture and extralegal execution,
according to archival material now coming to light.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights activists say the opening of the security files is
unprecedented in Latin America. The archives include nearly 80
million espionage files that PRI governments kept on citizens.</TE>
<TE>   The new freedom of information law bars the government from
withholding any official document that describes "grave violations"
of human rights.</TE>
<TE>   It requires all government departments to provide copies of
documents within 20 days of any citizen's request.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of Mexicans have lined up to seek files in the national
archives. They are kept in the labyrinthine former Lecumberri Prison,
once known as the "Black Palace," where the PRI once held and
allegedly tortured some of its enemies.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Ramirez, 56, a former student activist and guerrilla fighter
who attended Tuesday's hearing as an advisor to the prosecutor, has
spent hours in the files searching for information on 30 comrades who
disappeared in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "You read the files and you relive the sensation of those
days--the fear, the terror, the indignation," he said. "But what's
new is the degree of surveillance they practiced on us. It was much
more intense than we realized at the time."</TE>
<TE>   "The archives give you a description of how brutal the system
was," said Sergio Aguayo, a leading human rights campaigner.
"Gradually, what's in those files will alter people's perception of
what happened and lead to changes in laws and political practices."</TE>
<TE>   What remains to be seen is whether Fox's government will dare
prosecute those responsible for past abuses. Its human rights
commission has examined the secret-police files, interviewed hundreds
of witnesses and handed the president a sealed list of 74 former
officials it holds responsible for crimes.</TE>
<TE>   A criminal trial of Echeverria, Mexico's oldest living former
president, might shatter any hope Fox has for gaining the PRI's
cooperation in pushing reforms through Congress, where the former
ruling party still holds a plurality.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's hearing was only the start of evidence gathering that
will determine whether the prosecutor asks a judge to hold a trial.
Legal analysts say Mexico's complex statute of limitations might
preclude a murder trial, although Echeverria's accusers disagree.</TE>
<TE>   PRI leaders have warned against a witch hunt. Their resistance
last year prompted Fox to abandon the idea of a truth commission--an
instrument used by regimes in other violence-scarred countries to
issue reports on the brutal behavior of their predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Fox has left it to Carrillo Prieto to decide how
to punish past abuses but has made it clear that everyone in Mexico is
now subject to the rule of law.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no place for untouchables," Fox said last month at a
ceremony opening the police files at Mexico's national archives to
the public. "The rule of law is not negotiable."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's hearing at Carrillo Prieto's downtown office centered on
a formal complaint by survivors of the 1968 massacre, in which police
and army soldiers opened fire on thousands of university students
protesting economic inequity and demanding democratic reforms.</TE>
<TE>   The government at the time put the death toll at 30; historians
say 10 times that number may have died, but no one knows for sure.
Tuesday's hearing launched the first official investigation of the
massacre, for which no one has been prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   The late Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, Mexico's president at the time,
assumed responsibility for the events that day. The archives have not
yet produced a document showing who gave the orders to shoot, but
Raul Alvarez Garin, one of the accusers at Tuesday's hearing, said
Echeverria shares responsibility because he controlled the security
forces.</TE>
<TE>   Historians call the massacre a pivotal event in Mexican politics.
It drove hundreds of young people into armed resistance and alienated
millions of others from the PRI, triggering a slow but steady decline
of the party's grip on the country.</TE>
<TE>   The former president slipped into the hearing through a parking
garage to avoid a small crowd of demonstrators outside the building.
One held up a sign that said, "Echeverria, your hour has come."</TE>
<TE>   Inside, five of Echeverria's seven accusers were present as the
prosecutor read out their case and asked his own questions: What
orders did you get from President Diaz Ordaz? Where were you on Oct.
2? Did you believe that the rally was such a threat to the country's
stability that the killings were justified?</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Cuellar, the former president's lawyer, said after the
hearing that Echeverria would answer all questions.</TE>
<TE>   "He has nothing to hide," the lawyer said. "Our strategy is to
testify, and to testify truthfully."</TE>
<TE>   Other former Mexican presidents from the PRI have been questioned
by prosecutors, but only as witnesses in cases against others. They
have enjoyed de facto immunity from prosecution so long as they
refrained from criticizing their successors.</TE>
<TE>   The only breach occurred in 1934, when President Lazaro Cardenas'
regime used the threat of arrest to silence his predecessor, Plutarco
Elias Calles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's historic that a president of Mexico is seated before a
prosecutor to testify in the role of the accused," said Felix
Hernandez, 55, a former student leader and one of Echeverria's
accusers.</TE>
<TE>   "If we are really living through a moment of transition,
Echeverria and his accomplices will go to jail."</TE>

<HD>Afghanistan Death Toll May Be 50</HD>
<DH>Asia: Villagers killed in a U.S. sweep of a trouble spot
included friends of Karzai, local officials say. About 150 were
reportedly injured.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN and GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>KABUL, Afghanistan -- Dozens of Afghan civilians who were reported
killed during U.S. airstrikes included friends of President Hamid
Karzai, and they appear to have been caught in the middle of an
extensive sweep in a brewing trouble spot, Afghan and American
officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Local Afghan officials reported that as many as 50 people may have
been killed and 150 injured in the predawn operation Monday in which
a U.S. gunship responded to perceived antiaircraft fire by strafing
targets strewn across several miles.</LD>
<LD>   Details remain murky, but Pentagon officials on Tuesday outlined a
larger operation than previously depicted, involving as many as 400
coalition troops on the ground and American bombers dropping
satellite-guided munitions on nearby cave complexes.</LD>
<TE>   Officials would not say what prompted the operation, but they
indicated that intelligence information led them to return to a
region considered a potential haven for Al Qaeda and Taliban
operatives, perhaps including ousted Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed
Omar.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an area that is known to have in the past been the home
of Taliban and Al Qaeda," said Marine Gen. Peter Pace, vice chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "We had intelligence that indicated it
would be worthwhile to go back and revisit."</TE>
<TE>   The attack, in a remote area of central Afghanistan, was under
investigation Tuesday by a group of Afghan and American officials. It
was the first time that Afghanistan's new transitional government has
had to deal with such a difficult situation involving diplomatic
allies, and it was personally painful for Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai is from Oruzgan province, where the bombing took place.</TE>
<TE>   The attack occurred near the area to which he returned last fall
to marshal the anti-Taliban forces that ultimately took the city of
Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of those who died are family members of those who fought
alongside Hamid Karzai against the Taliban," said Tayeb Jawed, chief
of staff to Karzai. "The president knew personally some of those who
were killed; it has been a very hard couple of days."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the information first released by the Pentagon was being
revised Tuesday, and many aspects of the attack remained obscure.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear whether some of those killed and injured were
attending a wedding.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan officials have suggested that shots that were fired to
celebrate a marriage may have been mistaken by U.S. forces as
antiaircraft fire. U.S. military officials have expressed skepticism
about that scenario but have not ruled it out.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld voiced his regrets but
said that such mistakes are inevitable. "The task for all of us is to
see that it is as limited as possible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Local Afghan officials told Karzai that four villages had been
attacked, information that was initially corroborated by U.S.
military officials when they briefed Karzai, Tayeb said.</TE>
<TE>   The reported number of dead in two of the villages totaled eight,
and in a third village about 40 people may have died. But those
numbers are unconfirmed, and it is unknown if any casualties occurred
in the fourth village.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the dead, there were about 150 injured, according
to estimates by local officials, Tayeb said.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai did not speak publicly, but Foreign Minister Abdullah read
a statement from the government that urged the coalition forces to
"take all necessary precautions to make sure they do not harm
innocent victims."</TE>
<TE>   In a meeting with U.S. commanders, Karzai "strongly advised
coalition forces to seriously assess situations and verify all
intelligence reports before taking action," Abdullah said.</TE>
<TE>   Pace said the attack unfolded in an area where U.S. planes have
repeatedly come under antiaircraft fire in recent days. Coalition
ground forces--mainly Afghan soldiers accompanied by U.S.
troops--were traveling in two groups, with an AC-130 gunship
providing cover.</TE>
<TE>   The plane encountered fire from several locations and unleashed
heavy cannon fire on at least six targets described by air crew and
ground spotters as enemy antiaircraft installations, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   No U.S. planes were hit, Pace said, and there was no exchange of
fire among troops on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The only casualties the Pentagon confirmed were four injured
children, whose father brought them to U.S. ground forces in the area
after the attack. The children, ages 8 months to 5 years, were taken
to the U.S. base at Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time as the ground operation, an American B-52 was
carrying out strikes on nearby cave complexes, officials said. During
that mission, it dropped seven satellite-guided, 1-ton bombs. Ground
air controllers reported that six of the bombs hit their targets, and
Pace said the seventh hit an unpopulated hill.</TE>
<TE>   If reports from local Afghans are confirmed, the attack would be
one of the deadliest for civilians in the 9-month-old war. Some have
voiced concern that the incident could strain confidence in America's
conduct of the war. The issue is particularly significant in places
like Oruzgan, where Americans rely on sympathetic locals for
information about Taliban and Al Qaeda movements.</TE>
<TE>   Since news travels slowly in Afghanistan, American mistakes in one
place are often virtually unheard of even in the next province. And
the vast majority of Afghans still are grateful to the Americans for
helping them get rid of the Taliban and their Al Qaeda guests.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, there is a growing sense of anger over civilian
deaths. The frustration is apparent in areas where civilians have
been killed and among members of the government, who now want to be
consulted before the Americans call in airstrikes or gunships.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah said he hoped that there would be a careful review by the
Americans of every level of the operation. "The whole procedure has
to be reviewed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan government officials were careful to underscore that they
understood the need for hunting down Al Qaeda remnants and accepted
that bombing would probably continue.</TE>

<HD>Colombia Must Declare War on Rebels, Official Says</HD>
<DH>Interview: Andean nation's main guerrilla group is out to
destroy the state, adds Otto J. Reich, the U.S. point man on Latin
America.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The State Department's senior official for Latin America said Tuesday
that the administration of Colombian President-elect Alvaro Uribe
needs to move aggressively to "take the war to the guerrillas" who
are trying to drive out the country's mayors and lower-court judges.</LD>
<LD>   Otto J. Reich, assistant secretary of State for Western Hemisphere
affairs, said in an interview that the new Colombian government will
need to intensify military action against the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia rebels, who have adopted a "perverse strategy ...
of trying to destroy the government from the lowest level up."</LD>
<LD>   In recent days, the group, known by its Spanish initials as the
FARC, has threatened to kill or kidnap Colombia's municipal judges
and more than 1,000 mayors if they do not resign. Several dozen
mayors have quit.</LD>
<TE>   The offensive is a direct challenge to Uribe, who won a landslide
victory in May after campaigning on a promise to increase military
pressure on the FARC and the other main insurgent group, the National
Liberation Army, or ELN. Uribe, who takes office next month, has
promised to sharply increase military spending and double the size of
Colombia's professional army.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is backing Uribe's plans to intensify the
battle and is asking Congress to increase U.S. aid to Colombia, which
has totaled nearly $2 billion since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Reich said the FARC's goal is to kill "just enough to get the
others to resign." If the mayors resign, "then they'll do the same
with the governors," he said, "and who'll run the government?
...These people are out to destroy the Colombian state."</TE>
<TE>   He said the new rebel offensive demonstrates that Uribe is correct
in his assessment that the rebel groups do not sincerely want to
negotiate a peace with the government, despite 3 1/2 years of talks.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian President Andres Pastrana broke off discussions with the
FARC in February and with the ELN in late May.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe, a former governor, has been criticized as a firebrand who
could dangerously escalate Colombia's 38-year civil war.</TE>
<TE>   But Reich, who flew to Bogota, Colombia's capital, five days after
Uribe's election, said Bush administration officials believe that the
new president is "not an extremist," but is "very level-headed."</TE>
<TE>   "He's somebody who realizes his government is under attack, just
like our country was under attack last Sept. 11, when we had to take
very strong measures," Reich said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the United States has tried to help Colombian authorities
respond to the new rebel campaign by helping to strengthen security
and protect local officials.</TE>
<TE>   But "that's not the answer," Reich said. "The answer is to take
the fight to guerrillas and isolate them."</TE>
<TE>   Reich acknowledged that Colombia's eagerness to put up the blood
and money necessary to fight the rebels has come into question. Only
last month, a General Accounting Office report noted that many U.S.
government officials expressed frustration that the Colombian
military was not carrying out the anti-rebel effort more forcefully.</TE>
<TE>   But Reich insisted that Uribe is committed to increasing
Colombia's effort.</TE>
<TE>   On another subject, Reich said the U.S. relationship with Mexico
is "very good," despite Mexican President Vicente Fox's
disappointment that he has not convinced U.S. officials to accept
more of his proposals for a liberalized American migration policy.</TE>
<TE>   Fox has urged Washington to grant more visas, legalize the
millions of illegal immigrants in the United States and reduce the
dangers involved in border crossings. His promises of such steps
helped propel him to a landslide victory two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Reich said American and Mexican officials have cooperated closely
on law enforcement, security and anti-narcotics efforts, among other
areas.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to take things in a historical perspective," he said.
Only two decades ago, the working relationship between the countries
was "just terrible. It was easier to work with the Eastern bloc
countries ... than with Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Doyle McManus contributed to this report.</TE>

<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>A bewildered U.S. judge set a July 17 hearing for the former head of
Mexico's state-owned oil company after U.S. federal prosecutors said
Tuesday that they were not ready to accept his surrender on
corruption charges filed in his home country.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Nancy Atlas agreed to give confused U.S.
officials more time to sort out the case and made Rogelio Montemayor
promise that he would not leave Houston, where he has been trying to
turn himself in since Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a new one on me," said Atlas, shaking her head at the end
of a brief hearing.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. officials initially insisted that they had not received a
request from Mexico for an arrest warrant, but State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said Tuesday that Mexico asked for a
warrant in a diplomatic note sent May 21.</TE>
<TE>   Montemayor, who headed Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, and was once
governor of the northern state of Coahuila, agreed to stay put
because he believes that he can get a fairer hearing in a U.S. court.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>PALE, Bosnia-Herzegovina</DL>
<LD>NATO troops ransacked the empty home of war crimes suspect Radovan
Karadzic on Tuesday in a raid they said was intended to crack down on
illegal smuggling and not to seize the fugitive former Bosnian Serb
leader.</LD>
<LD>   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization denied that the action was
aimed at showing that its peacekeeping mission is unaffected by a
U.S. refusal to renew a United Nations mandate for Bosnia-Herzegovina
that expires Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Troops forced open the gate of the 15-room house, blew doors open,
ripped up parquet flooring, tore the backs off icons and took the
hard drive from a computer.</LD>
<TE>   After the predawn raid by helicopter-borne French troops of the
NATO-led Stabilization Force, or SFOR, a statement from the force
said the house was "suspected of being associated with an illegal
smuggling network."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Maj. Scott Lundy, an SFOR spokesman, told reporters in
Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, that the raid had uncovered forged
passports and several firearms.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not expect to find Mr. Karadzic there today," he told BBC
television.</TE>
<TE>   Karadzic tops the wanted list of the U.N. war crimes tribunal in
The Hague. He and former army commander Ratko Mladic are charged with
genocide for the siege of Sarajevo and the July 1995 massacre in
Srebrenica during Bosnia's civil war.</TE>

<HD>Sudanese Talking Despite Fighting</HD>
<DH>Africa: A U.S. official expresses optimism about the
negotiations to end a 19-year civil war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>As top Sudanese government officials and rebel leaders hold peace
talks aimed at ending their country's 19-year civil war, forces back
home have been engaged in some of the fiercest fighting in months,
resulting in heavy battlefield casualties and more suffering for
hundreds of thousands of hungry civilians.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the fighting, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Walter
Kansteiner said the peace talks currently underway in Machakos, about
35 miles southeast of Nairobi, could bring both sides closer to a
peace agreement.</LD>
<LD>   U.S., British and Norwegian representatives are observing the
talks, which are being chaired by retired Kenyan Lt. Gen. Lazaro
Sumbeiywo. Kansteiner said the presence of international observers
has changed the tone of the talks.</LD>
<TE>   "There's still lingering [sentiment on both sides] that we've
fought too long to compromise our principles," Kansteiner said during
a meeting here late Monday with a small group of reporters. But
"there's also enough talk that 'our people are weary of this stuff
[and] we need to do a deal.' "</TE>
<TE>   The conflict has claimed more than 2 million lives, largely
because of hunger. The war pits Sudan's Islamic government in the
north against militias in the mainly Christian and animist south. The
fighting has intensified since 1999, when European and Asian
companies started pumping oil from the western part of Upper Nile
region.</TE>
<TE>   The Sudanese government has used the oil proceeds to buy more
sophisticated weapons while the rebels have attempted, with limited
success, to target oil installations operated by foreign companies.</TE>
<TE>   Kansteiner, who described the peace talks as the most promising in
recent years, was expected to meet President Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir
in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, this week. Kansteiner said he
would urge the Sudanese leader to allow United Nations food drops
into war-ravaged areas of the country, particularly in
rebel-controlled areas in  the western part of the Upper Nile region.</TE>
<TE>   Aid agencies say the government, which has been known to use food
as a weapon, has denied access to U.N. flights for the last few
months, cutting off supplies to hundreds of thousands of people.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir struck a conciliatory note this week when he called on the
main rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army, or SPLA, to
help "build a country dominated by forgiveness and reconciliation,
led by the rule of law." In a televised speech and a military parade
in Khartoum marking the June 30, 1989, coup that brought him to
power, Bashir said he hoped the negotiations in Machakos would help
end the war.</TE>
<TE>   But even as Bashir was addressing the nation, his soldiers were
bombing Kapoeta, a strategic town that was captured last month by the
SPLA. This week, aid workers told reporters that nine civilians were
killed and many others seriously wounded when soldiers dropped bombs
from a Russian-made Antonov plane.</TE>
<TE>   The SPLA also acknowledged this week that its fighters had
withdrawn from Gogrial, another strategic town 550 miles southwest of
Khartoum, after coming under heavy attack.</TE>
<TE>   Kansteiner said the recent heavy fighting probably meant that both
sides were jockeying to improve their position in the talks.</TE>
<TE>   A report issued last week by the International Crisis Group, a
respected think tank based in Brussels, called on the United States
to craft a "more robust" effort that fulfills President Bush's
intention of bringing peace to Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   John Prendergast, director of the group's Africa programs and a
top Sudan policymaker during the Clinton administration, wrote in the
report that the issue of self-determination for the south "is certain
to be the make-or-break point of greatest contention."</TE>
<TE>   "To ensure the unity of Sudan ... power will have to be shared and
rights guaranteed through constitutional and security arrangements,
backed by international guarantees," he wrote.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There is more riding on 20th Century Fox's new movie "Like Mike" than
a share of this summer's fastbreak box office.</LD>
<LD>   Behind the fanciful plot line about a boy who is carried to pro
basketball fame by a pair of magic sneakers is a bottom-line strategy
by the National Basketball Assn. to cast its brightest stars as
salesmen for the league. Among them: Jason Kidd of the New Jersey
Nets, Chris Webber of the Sacramento Kings and Vince Carter of the

<LD>   "There aren't a lot of 7- to 12-year-olds that will watch a whole
game, but we may be able to suck them in with a good story," said
Gregg Winik, executive vice president for NBA Entertainment. And the
hope is that when the video comes out, Winik added, kids will watch
it "over and over and over again."</LD>
<TE>   No longer able to rely on athletic feats alone to deliver new
fans--and their money--the NBA and other professional sports leagues
are aggressively cultivating Hollywood as never before.</TE>
<TE>   As they grant film crews unparalleled access to games and
stand-out athletes, they're negotiating production deals, exerting
more influence over scripts and taking greater care with how their
images are portrayed. League officials, such as Winik, have even
earned screen credits.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, the National Football League will throw open the door
to one of its secret bastions--preseason training camp--for an HBO
reality show focusing on the Dallas Cowboys. The NFL is banking on
the second-year series to satisfy die-hards but also attract women
and casual fans with behind-the-scenes stories of players and their
personal struggles.</TE>
<TE>   Major League Baseball has a senior manager for "presence
marketing" who lobbies studios and movie makers to weave the sport
into their films. The National Hockey League recently prevailed on
Nickelodeon to feature its "NHL Breakout" roller hockey tournament on
the cartoon series "Rocket Power."</TE>
<TE>   And NASCAR, already one of television's top sporting draws,
announced a movie deal last month in which pop singer Britney Spears
will play the daughter of a team owner in a film that will include
real race footage, drivers and pit crew action. The sport hopes to
get the attention of kids who may not even have their driver's
licenses.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not interested in making a movie just to make a movie,"
said Paul Brooks, a NASCAR vice president in charge of the sport's
new Los Angeles office. "We're interested in making a movie to grow a
sport."</TE>
<TE>   That attitude has created a new dynamic in Hollywood, which has
feasted on sports themes since movie cameras captured Bob
Fitzsimmons' stunning defeat of "Gentleman" Jim Corbett in the 1897
heavyweight title fight. Filmmakers realized big box-office returns
when they began featuring sports newsreels and cast athletes in
dramatizations or bit parts starting in the early 1900s.</TE>
<TE>   The leagues have been slower to see the box-office marketing
potential of their properties. But faced with aging fan bases and
fierce competition, league officials have reversed field.</TE>
<TE>   One of the earlier signposts came in 1992, when the NHL awarded
Walt Disney Co. a franchise team that would be named after its hit
movie "The Mighty Ducks." Two years later, the NFL worked closely on
the filming of "Little Giants" and won a rewrite of a scene to
include top players and famed broadcaster John Madden.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the leagues are taking it a step further, seeking a fusion
with Hollywood that sells two products at once, filling theaters and
arenas.</TE>
<TE>   Pro leagues offer Hollywood a built-in fan base, considerable
marketing prowess and the kind of authenticity that not even a studio
can create.</TE>
<TE>   Take Disney's "The Rookie," based on the real-life story of a
35-year-old science teacher who became a relief pitcher for the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays. Major League Baseball broke with tradition when it
allowed a camera crew 90 seconds to film actor Dennis Quaid trotting
in from the bullpen while the crowd cheered during a Texas
Rangers-Devil Rays game.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the movie's promotional blitz, Quaid hosted a segment
of MLB's "This Week in Baseball," and the league ran trailers for the
movie on ballpark Jumbotrons across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   But the NBA is at the forefront of marrying its interests with
Hollywood, insiders say. League officials said they were involved
with the making of Warner Bros.' 1996 movie "Space Jam" starring
Michael Jordan. "Like Mike," however, is in a league of its own,
combining the talents of a young rap superstar with giants of the
NBA.</TE>
<TE>   "The NBA has taken a much more aggressive role in the production
and cooperation in getting this movie to market than we've seen in
the past," said Dean Bonham, chief executive of a Denver-based sports
marketing group. "It takes cooperation to a new level."</TE>
<TE>   "Like Mike," a $20-million film rated PG, opens today against the
highly anticipated "Men in Black II."</TE>
<TE>   The movie features hip-hop singer Lil' Bow Wow as a Los Angeles
orphan who romps through the NBA in a pair of hand-me-down sneakers
initialed M.J.--presumably for Michael Jordan. Bow, as he likes to be
called, plays for the fictitious L.A. Knights, but his opponents, the
arenas, announcers and even one referee are real.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been impossible to do this kind of movie without
the NBA," said Tom Rothman, co-chairman of 20th Century Fox, which
brought the movie to the league's attention.</TE>
<TE>   NBA officials saw the movie as a perfect tool to recruit a
demographic bulge that marketers commonly refer to as "tweens."
Insatiable entertainment consumers, these prepubescent kids influence
an estimated $220 billion in annual spending, said James U. McNeill,
a retired Texas A&amp;M University professor who advises businesses on
how to market to sharp-eyed youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   "Being authentic and being real is very important indeed," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   NBA officials thought realism was crucial to the success of "Like
Mike." After scouring the script, they urged that one scene be
rewritten because it showed a coach shoving a player--a no-no in the
NBA.</TE>
<TE>   League officials were allowed to review the "dailies"--unedited
tapes of what is filmed each day. Former NBA all-star guard Reggie
Theus, the league's consultant on the film, said he asked for one
scene to be reshot because of a mock media camera on a tripod in the
background. The league wouldn't allow such cameras for safety
reasons, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Movie co-producer Peter Heller and others said the NBA suggested
hiring a well-known referee for game shots and also was "adamant"
that players tuck in their jerseys, a rule that carries a fine if
violated in the pros. One extra had to remove his earring because
such jewelry is forbidden on the court.</TE>
<TE>   Heller said he welcomed every suggestion: "I think the more you
can anchor a fantasy movie in reality, the better the fantasy plays."</TE>
<TE>   To heighten that illusion, the league helped assemble a veritable
NBA who's who for the film. Other players who appear in mock games
include David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs, Allen Iverson of the
Philadelphia 76ers and Tracy McGrady of the Orlando Magic. Filming
for one scene was delayed to accommodate Carter as his team made a
playoff run.</TE>
<TE>   Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning said he was "very cool" with
appearing in a film that not only inspires kids but seeks to
cultivate new basketball fans as well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about what sells tickets.... Times have changed, man. We're
living in a very marketable and promotional world now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite efforts by the NBA and Fox, there are no L.A. Lakers in
the film. They were said to be too busy winning their third
championship.</TE>
<TE>   As a courtesy, Fox asked Jordan, who does not appear in the film,
for his blessing to use the phrase "Like Mike."</TE>
<TE>   Players were paid Screen Actors Guild wages, which many donated to
charity. The NBA and Fox declined to discuss the financial agreements
behind their partnership, except to say the league received a fee.</TE>
<TE>   Studio officials said the league provided something as valuable as
money--exposure--when it threw its weight behind promoting the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Fox paid to air "Like Mike" commercials during each playoff game
and the NBA finals; the league hosted screenings in all its franchise
cities. The movie has been the subject of three segments on the
league's television magazine "NBA Inside Stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Godsick, Fox executive vice president for publicity and
promotion, said that during Game 6 of the series between the Lakers
and the Kings, the NBA also arranged for NBC to include Lil' Bow Wow
among the celebrities it panned to at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   It conveniently followed a "Like Mike" commercial.</TE>
<TE>   During the filming, NBA stars were shuttled for their cameos from
the First Union Center in Philadelphia where the All-Star festivities
were held in February to a movie set next door.</TE>
<TE>   An extra touch of reality was achieved by filming during the
popular dunk contest. Lil' Bow Wow ran onto the floor in his L.A.
Knights uniform, "waved at the crowd and took off toward the basket,"
said Winik, an NBA official who is an executive producer on the film.</TE>
<TE>   Movie magic would later convert the moment into a jaw-dropping
dunk shot.</TE>
<TE>   That was never explained to the somewhat bewildered 20,000 fans
providing the real-life backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they fully understood what was happening," Winik
said. "But they'll see it in the movie."</TE>

<HD>Hahn Plan Shifts LAX Burden to Other Cities</HD>
<DH>Travel: Mayor lacks the power to order changes, however,
and region's airports face limits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In putting together his $9.6-billion modernization plan for Los
Angeles International Airport, Mayor James K. Hahn has in effect
declared to other political leaders around Southern California that
much of the region's need to handle millions more passengers and tons
of additional freight in coming years will have to be solved
somewhere else.</LD>
<LD>   But the plan faces two major problems. Right now, there is no
place else--all other airports in the region face limits on their
ability to grow. And Hahn lacks the authority to force airlines to
change the number or the mix of planes that they schedule into LAX's
gates.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn's solution has been to design a plan that simply has no room
for more planes. Some say the design may discourage passengers from
using LAX.</LD>
<TE>   "If you make it so lengthy or onerous to go through those
checkpoints, part of the message is to go to Burbank or Long Beach or
John Wayne," said Steven Erie, a UC San Diego political science
professor who is writing a book about the region's infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole thing about an elevated train and Manchester Square is
partly just to encourage people who are taking international
flights--they're willing to put up with an additional hour or two
wait. But the short-haul traveler won't do that."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn built political capital for his plan, announced at an airport
ceremony Tuesday, in large part by promising former expansion
opponents that he would limit the nation's third-busiest airport to
78 million passengers a year. The airport served 61 million
passengers in 2001--52% more than its intended capacity.</TE>
<TE>   The passenger limit convinced El Segundo Mayor Mike Gordon, who
led opposition to former Mayor Richard Riordan's $12-billion LAX
expansion plan, to stand with a group of supporters flanking Hahn
when he unveiled his proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's plan, first outlined in the weeks after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, emphasizes security and safety over expansion. It
would entail a dramatic reworking of the airport, including the
demolition of four terminals, new transportation facilities to the
east of the airport and the removal of all cars in the central
terminal area.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn faces an uphill battle to turn his promise into reality. No
other airport in the country has successfully limited passenger
capacity. And efforts by some to artificially constrain growth
backfired, prompting airlines to leave the area, taking jobs with
them.</TE>
<TE>   "The only other airport to cut gates was Denver," said Michael
Boyd, a Denver-based airline consultant. "They opened at Denver
International Airport with 25 fewer gates than they had at Stapleton
and they lost a carrier because of it."</TE>
<TE>   Continental Airlines pulled out of Denver International Airport
because the limited number of gates made landing fees unaffordable,
Boyd said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn hopes to limit capacity in part by encouraging the airlines
to take commuter flights to airports in Long Beach, Ontario, Burbank
and Orange County. But many who were briefed on his plan before
Tuesday's announcement are asking how the mayor will persuade
airlines, which set their own flight schedules, to move service out
of LAX.</TE>
<TE>   "The key ingredient to keeping the cap on is regionalization,"
said Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice). "But what I want to see is more
tangible evidence that this regionalization is going to get as much
attention and focus and support as changes at LAX."</TE>
<TE>   Agencies that run the regional airports aren't likely to help
Hahn: Politicians in Long Beach and Orange County have made it clear
that they are not willing to do away with rules that limit capacity
at their facilities. And even if there were the political will to
open the airports to business from LAX, there are already airlines
standing in line to use the facilities.</TE>
<TE>   John Wayne Airport could grow slightly in the next few years,
according to a limited expansion plan approved by the Orange County
Board of Supervisors last week. It would allow 1.4 million more
passengers to use the airport each year starting Jan. 1. A federal
court must still approve the agreement--which would increase the
passenger load at the facility from 8.4 million to 9.8 million
passengers a year.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the plan is approved, the airport already has a waiting
list of 10 carriers that have requested permission to start service,
said Ann McCarley, an airport representative.</TE>
<TE>   At Long Beach Airport, American Airlines and Alaska Airlines are
negotiating with the city for more room at the Art Deco facility.
Space at Long Beach is scarce because of a noise compatibility
ordinance that limits the number of commercial takeoffs to 41 per
day. Upstart JetBlue Airlines has the rights to the remainder of the
spaces at the airport, an agreement that American says violates state
and federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Even areas where residents and politicians have said they would
welcome new air service, such as Ontario, face major hurdles to
accepting more flights. California Air Resources Board restrictions
limit Ontario, where the mayor's office hopes to shift a large
proportion of LAX's cargo load, to 12 million passengers a year.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say they can shift traffic to Ontario by
eliminating places for aircraft to park at LAX and by reconfiguring
gates for larger aircraft--a move, they add, that would entice
airlines to take smaller, commuter jets to regional facilities.</TE>
<TE>   But that plan wouldn't work, industry experts say, because
airlines have spent decades building a carefully orchestrated system
at LAX that uses small jets to feed larger airplanes traveling to
international destinations.</TE>
<TE>   "LAX has developed over 40 years the greatest fleet mix of any
airport in the country--it has everything from the biggest jumbo
freighters to 19-seat commuters," said Roger Cohen, managing director
of state and local affairs for the Air Transport Assn., an airline
trade group. "For the airport to dictate where these planes go would
be controverting 40 years of history."</TE>
<TE>   Airline representatives agreed, saying they rely on commuter
flights to support medium- and long-haul domestic flights and
international service. In fact, the passengers who get on
international flights from commuter aircraft are often those who make
the service profitable, said Alan Wayne, a spokesman for United
Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Getting the airlines to approve the plan will be key for Hahn
because carriers would pay for about half the renovation through
higher rent and landing fees. The remainder of construction funding
would come from a $1.50 fee added to passenger tickets, from federal
transportation funds and from bonds financed by income from airport
concessionaires.</TE>
<TE>   City officials hope to complete the plan in phases over 10 years.
It will take two years for the city to finish environmental studies,
hold public hearings and present the plan to the Airport Commission,
the City Council and the Federal Aviation Administration. Each must
approve the plan before construction can begin.</TE>
<TE>   Before the plan even reaches that review stage, city officials
must also figure out how they will transfer more than 1 million tons
of cargo a year away to other airports. LAX is the world's
third-busiest cargo airport in the world, handling about 2.5 million
tons of freight a year. Hahn's plan would allow for about 3 million
tons a year--about 1.2 million less than previous expansion plans.</TE>
<TE>   Airport Commission President Ted Stein said officials plan to
encourage airlines to take cargo that doesn't come in the belly of
aircraft--about 50% of the freight that goes through LAX--to other
regional facilities, possibly in Ontario or Palmdale.</TE>
<TE>   But Ontario is able to handle only about 500,000 tons a year now,
and Palmdale has no commercial airline service.</TE>
<TE>   It's also not clear how moving cargo from LAX would affect
traffic, and thus air quality, in the Southland.</TE>
<TE>   As much as 80% of the cargo that comes into the airport is
destined for Southern California, airport officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The question is where this freight ultimately needs to end up and
if it would ultimately need to be trucked from Ontario or Palmdale
back to Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Wal-Mart Tightens Gun Policy</HD>
<DH>Business: The retailer exceeds federal rules on buyer
background checks, provoking opposition from the NRA and other
groups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest seller of guns, has quietly ordered
its stores to adopt a tougher policy on gun sales that goes beyond
the requirements of the federal government and is sure to provoke
opposition from gun owners.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart executives, in an internal memorandum obtained by The
Times, told store managers five weeks ago to stop selling firearms in
cases where authorities were not able to determine whether the
would-be buyers should be banned from owning a weapon.</LD>
<LD>   Under federal law, if authorities cannot complete a criminal
background check on a gun buyer within three business days, retailers
are allowed to hand over the weapon even though the buyer's status is
unclear. Nine states have more stringent standards, including
California, where gun sellers must wait 10 days before completing a
transaction.</LD>
<TE>   The company "decided to take the extra step toward keeping guns
out of the hands of individuals who possibly ought not to have them,"
according to the memo.</TE>
<TE>   The move is a major change for a company that has sometimes been
criticized for lax gun-sale policies. The Arkansas-based retailer's
prominence in the national marketplace could put pressure on other
major gun sellers to follow suit in voluntarily withholding firearms
from buyers if it is unclear whether they are allowed to own one,
observers said.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart's decision drew immediate criticism from the National
Rifle Assn. and other gun-rights groups, which questioned the
legality of the unannounced policy shift and hinted that they might
seek to organize a boycott against the retailing giant.</TE>
<TE>   In the vast majority of the more than 8 million gun checks a year,
authorities determine the buyer's status in a matter of minutes or
hours, confirming whether the would-be buyer has a felony record, has
been institutionalized or is otherwise banned from owning a gun. Once
no disqualifications are found, the gun dealer is allowed to complete
the sale.</TE>
<TE>   But in about 5% of sales, the buyer's legal status cannot be
immediately determined--often because of similar names, lost
paperwork or poor record-keeping. These cases have proved vexing to
law enforcement because studies show that sales that proceed by
default--when the three-day limit runs out--produce a
disproportionately high number of cases in which a customer was able
to buy a gun even though he was banned from doing so.</TE>
<TE>   Americans for Gun Safety, a moderate gun-control group in
Washington, found in a recent study that in a 2 1/2 year period,
10,000 felons and others banned from owning a gun were able to
purchase weapons because their background checks could not be
completed in three days. A similar congressional study last month
confirmed widespread cracks in the system.</TE>
<TE>   In an April letter, Americans for Gun Safety appealed to Wal-Mart
and other large retailers that sell firearms--including Big 5, Gart
Sports, Sports Authority and Kmart--to adopt a "don't know, don't
sell" policy that would go beyond federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart, which describes itself as "the local store of choice"
for guns and sporting goods, did not responded to Americans for Gun
Safety directly. But internally, the letter prompted executives to
research the issue, and they were troubled to find nationwide data
showing that the three-day defaults lead to many banned gun sales,
said Wal-Mart spokeswoman Jessica Eldred.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the company decided "after much consideration" to
change its policy effective May 29 in its 2,700 stores, nearly all of
which sell guns, according to the memo.</TE>
<TE>   The memo lays out the policy unequivocally: If a store receives a
"delayed" response from federal or state authorities who conduct the
background checks on potential buyers, "do NOT transfer the firearms
until you receive a proceed. To restate, you MUST have a 'proceed'
(no matter how long it takes) before any firearm is transferred to a
Customer."</TE>
<TE>   Gun-control groups have long supported extending the three-day
period for background checks, but the issue is seen as politically
suicidal in Washington. Indeed, the current move is in the opposite
direction, as Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, a strong backer of gun
rights, has sought to complete the checks more quickly and destroy
the records within 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, many observers were impressed by the decision to move
beyond federal law.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very positive step for an organization as large as
Wal-Mart to take," said retired FBI official James DeSarno, who
oversaw the implementation of the background check system at the
bureau. The tough-to-check cases that take longer than three days, he
said, "are where you're going to find the problems."</TE>
<TE>   Matt Bennett of Americans for Gun Safety said: "We're just
delighted by how rapidly a huge corporation was able to pivot and
change its policy on such an important issue. This is a major step,
and if Wal-Mart is doing it, we hope others will follow their lead."</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart does not release figures on its gun sales, and no
centralized data are collected. But industry experts agree that the
retailer sells more guns than anyone else, and its policy shift is
likely to reverberate through the industry.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of the move will be more limited in those nine states
with laws that are already more stringent than the federal
government's.</TE>
<TE>   But California and states with similar laws have been plagued by
black-market guns--illegal buyers going to neighboring states with
looser laws. Wal-Mart is believed to make hundreds of millions of
dollars each year from its gun sales, but those sales have sometimes
proved controversial.</TE>
<TE>   Police in Pleasanton, Calif., last year suspended the gun-selling
license of a Wal-Mart after investigators found that the store had
repeatedly allowed buyers to claim their weapons before background
checks were completed.</TE>
<TE>   And in 1996, Wal-Mart banned an album by Grammy winner Sheryl Crow
from its shelves because of a song lyric suggesting that the chain
sells guns to children. The lyric grew out of courtroom allegations
that Wal-Mart's lax policies had allowed guns to be put into the
hands of minors, sex abusers and the mentally ill--including several
buyers who used the weapons in high-profile shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart said it has not heard many complaints from gun-buying
customers over the policy. "Overall, [the reaction] has been very
positive. Our customers understand that we're just trying to do the
right thing here, and they're very cooperative," Eldred said.</TE>
<TE>   But gun industry officials said they have already started hearing
grumblings from gun owners.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly this is cause for concern for us," said Andrew
Arulanandam, a spokesman for the NRA. "The NRA's position has always
been that law-abiding gun owners ought not to have their rights
infringed by any bureaucratic snafu" because the "flawed" background
check system is too slow to process requests.</TE>
<TE>   Arulanandam predicted that many gun owners would be incensed about
the policy change.</TE>
<TE>   When some Kmart stores briefly removed guns and ammunition from
their shelves immediately after Sept. 11, the NRA issued an alert
condemning the move and urging members to contact the company. But
Arulanandam said "it's too soon to tell" whether the group will seek
a boycott or similar action against Wal-Mart over its shift in
policy. "We'll monitor it," he said.</TE>

<HD>AIDS' Global Spread Staggers Researchers</HD>
<DH>Health: Without massive intervention, experts fear disease
will claim far more than ever expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 68 million people will die of AIDS in the next two decades
unless massive intervention efforts are begun immediately, according
to a grim new UNAIDS report issued Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   About 22 million people have already died of AIDS worldwide and
another 40 million are now HIV-positive, but the numbers are going to
grow much higher than was previously believed possible "if we
continue with prevention and treatment at the levels they are now,"
said Dr. Peter Piot, the executive director of UNAIDS, a joint United
Nations program on AIDS and HIV.</LD>
<LD>   "It's clear to me we are only at the beginning of the AIDS
epidemic in historical terms," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The report marks the first time in at least 10 years that the
agency has issued such a global projection of deaths. In the early
1990s, many experts, in fact, thought the epidemic was at or nearing
its peak, but in hindsight it is clear they underestimated the
virulence of the disease.</TE>
<TE>   As AIDS experts from around the world prepare to gather in
Barcelona, Spain, next week for the 14th International AIDS
Conference, the continued spread of the virus in the most severely
affected countries, and its explosion in several new regions, has
staggered those who track its progression, said UNAIDS epidemiologist
Neff Walker.</TE>
<TE>   While the rate of new infections and deaths has leveled off in the
United States and Europe, the gulf between wealthy countries and the
developing world has been growing ever wider.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, experts--basing their predictions on experience
with epidemics of other diseases--had thought the virus had reached a
saturation point in the most severely affected countries such as
Botswana and Zimbabwe and that infection rates would level off.</TE>
<TE>   "We have grossly, grossly underestimated how bad this was going to
be," Piot said. The continued spread of the virus has the potential
to depopulate some countries.</TE>
<TE>   In Botswana, 39% of adults are now HIV-positive, compared with
less than 36% two years ago, and researchers do not foresee a
leveling off of the infection rate. Because of AIDS, life expectancy
in Botswana has dropped below 40 for the first time since 1950.</TE>
<TE>   In Zimbabwe, one-third of all adults are now infected, compared
with one-quarter in 1997. In five other African countries, the HIV
prevalence rate is also more than 20%.</TE>
<TE>   In several sub-Saharan countries, half of all new mothers could
die of AIDS, according to experts.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, researchers fear a repeat of the sub-Saharan experience
in countries such as China and Russia, which have hitherto had little
experience with the problem. In the Russian Federation, for example,
new cases of HIV infection have been nearly doubling every year. In
the Ukraine, 25% of new cases now result from heterosexual contact.
"It's the fastest growing epidemic in the world," Piot said.</TE>
<TE>   The number of new infections in China grew 70% during the first
six months of 2001. UNAIDS experts predicted last week that the
number of HIV-positive people in China would grow from the current
estimated 1.5 million to 10 million by 2010. That, the report said,
would put the country "on the verge of a catastrophe that could
result in unimaginable suffering, economic loss and social
devastation."</TE>
<TE>   To forestall this global viral explosion in just the middle- and
low-income countries will require $10 billion a year from wealthy
countries and the affected nations themselves for prevention and
treatment, Piot said, and "that is a conservative estimate." But
currently, the total spending is less than $3 billion per year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not asking for the moon," Piot added. "By any standards that
are used for breaches in security, that's peanuts."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the money becomes available, AIDS workers will have their
hands full. A separate UNICEF report issued Tuesday said that the
vast majority of the world's youth have no idea what AIDS is or how
it is transmitted, much less how to protect themselves from it.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, another U.N. report to be issued today is expected to
say that the number of new cases could be cut by nearly two-thirds
through a massive prevention effort.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers take heart from experiences in the handful of
countries that initiated prevention programs several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In Uganda, which has the most ambitious prevention program in
Africa, the prevalence of HIV infections among adults has fallen from
8.3% in 1999 to 5% at the end of 2001. Zambia has also seen
successes: HIV prevalence among young women dropped from 28% in 1996
to 24% in 1999 in cities, and from 16% to 12% in rural areas.</TE>
<TE>   The government of Poland has mounted a strong effort to
successfully curtail the epidemic among injection drug users and
prevented it from gaining a foothold in the wider population.</TE>
<TE>   Strides are also being made in treatment, but they are modest. The
cost of so-called triple therapy--using three different classes of
drugs to block HIV replication--has fallen as low as $1 per person a
day for certain generic drugs, compared with a yearly cost of $12,000
to $15,000 for brand-name drugs in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But even that reduced rate is beyond the means of most developing
countries, where health budgets are often in the range of 5 cents per
person a year.</TE>
<TE>   The number of people receiving drug treatment in sub-Saharan
Africa increased tenfold over the last two years, but it is still
only about 30,000. Worldwide, UNAIDS estimates that less than 4% of
the people who could benefit from drug treatment are now receiving
it.</TE>
<TE>   On a positive note, Piot said, "political commitment has grown
hugely in the past two years." Nearly 100 countries have national
AIDS strategies and dozens have established AIDS commissions.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to go into these countries and be diverted to health
ministers" and lower-level officials, he said. "Now presidents and
prime ministers want to meet."</TE>

<HD>Balloonist Finally Makes It Around the World</HD>
<DH>Aeronautics: Steve Fossett completes record-making solo
trip on his sixth attempt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER and MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After failing five times and nearly losing his life in the process,
American adventurer Steve Fossett on Tuesday became the first person
to fly around the world solo in a hot-air balloon--and when he
succeeded, he had to celebrate alone.</LD>
<LD>   After spending 13 1/2 days floating six miles above Earth's
surface in an unpressurized gondola smaller than a prison cell, the
58-year-old multimillionaire finally succeeded on his sixth attempt
at the record. He floated over Kalgoorlie, Australia, at 6:40 a.m.
PDT Tuesday, coming full circle 19,428.6 miles from the point where
he embarked. He continued to drift, anticipating that winds would
bring the giant silver balloon down to a landing in Australia today.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an enormous relief and satisfaction," Fossett said by
satellite phone Tuesday from his balloon, the Spirit of Freedom.
"It's been a long trip, and I'm really glad to get across."</LD>
<TE>   Fossett didn't do much to mark his record, though. "You can't do
very much celebrating here," he said. "I do have a few bottles of Bud
Light, but I'm saving that for the landing because there's no one to
drink it with. That's the nature of solo flight."</TE>
<TE>   Fossett was already contemplating his next venture, in which he
would try to pilot a glider into the stratosphere.</TE>
<TE>   During his nearly two weeks aloft, Fossett sucked air from liquid
oxygen cylinders and ate tasteless military-style MREs. He slept in
one-hour intervals for, at most, four hours a day. He had minimal
heat, used a bucket for a toilet and could not shower. He dodged
thunderstorms and braved outside temperatures that dipped to 50 below
zero in a vehicle that had no engine and only two steering controls:
up and down.</TE>
<TE>   Fossett's trip wasn't quite as harrowing as that of Larry Walters,
the Los Angeles man who secured 42 weather balloons to a lawn chair
in 1982, not realizing they would take him to a height of 16,000
feet.</TE>
<TE>   But the Fossett expedition was the opposite of the one made by
Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones, the European duo who made history
in 1999 when they sailed their balloon around the world in 20 days.
Their high-tech gondola was the size of two minivans, equipped with a
bunk, toilet, kitchen and heat. They could breathe without an oxygen
mask because the gondola was pressurized like an airplane.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve took a very different approach--the harder approach to
flying around the world," said Andrew Baird, general manager of
Cameron Balloons, the Michigan-based company that built both
gondolas. "Imagine going to the smallest room of your house and
trying to live there for 10, 15 or 20 days. You can imagine how stir
crazy you might get."</TE>
<TE>   The living conditions during Fossett's journey were certainly
austere, but they were not as difficult as Charles Lindbergh's
transatlantic flight in 1927. Riding through darkness, fog and sleet,
Lindbergh made the 3,610-mile trip in 33 1/2 hours, taking only four
sandwiches, two canteens of water and 451 gallons of fuel. He didn't
have the opportunity to sleep and didn't have a radio, parachute, gas
gauge or navigation lights. He discarded them to decrease the plane's
weight and increase his chances for success.</TE>
<TE>   Fossett also had the benefit of high-tech communications equipment
and a support team. A global positioning system, backup satellite
telephone, high-frequency radio and rescue beacon were on board, as
well as the laptop computer he used to swap satellite e-mails with
his seven-person mission control team on the ground in St. Louis.
Staffed around the clock, mission control provided Fossett with
up-to-the-minute weather reports and flight-path information, and
communicated with air traffic controllers to let them know Fossett's
location. Fossett's balloon was also followed by a chase plane.</TE>
<TE>   While the gondola in which Fossett traveled was only seven feet
long, 5 1/2 feet wide and 5 1/2 feet tall, providing enough space for
him to lie down but not stand, the balloon that carried it was 14
stories tall and inflated to 550,000 cubic feet--the equivalent of
six Olympic-size swimming pools.</TE>
<TE>   Fossett carried enough fuel and oxygen to last 27 days, and had
estimated that he would complete the voyage in 20, one day longer
than Piccard and Jones, who finished their trip in 19 days, 21 hours
and 55 minutes. Fossett finished in 13 days and 12 hours, breaking a
second world record for speed.</TE>
<TE>   At times, Fossett's balloon raced along at nearly 200 mph, a
benefit of traveling over the Southern Hemisphere, where the winds
were faster and the weather conditions less severe. Piccard and Jones
flew closer to the equator, which also lengthened their trip to
29,054 miles.</TE>
<TE>   On a clear day, Fossett could see 200 miles in every direction.
Unfortunately, most of the view was ocean, since 90% of his trip was
above water.</TE>
<TE>   Fossett first tried to circumnavigate the globe in August 1998 but
was caught in a thunderstorm that ruptured his balloon and plunged
him 29,000 feet into the Coral Sea, 500 miles off Australia's east
coast. In August 2001, his last attempt, he was once again plagued by
thunderstorms and forced to abandon the trip halfway through by
landing in a Brazilian cattle ranch. However, he set a record for the
longest duration solo balloon flight to that point--12 days, 12 hours
and 57 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The multimillionaire president of the Chicago-based investment
firm Larkspur Securities, Fossett is no stranger to endurance sports.
His previous accomplishments include swimming the English Channel,
finishing an Ironman triathlon and competing in Alaska's Iditarod
dogsled race. He also holds sailing records.</TE>
<TE>   The first hot-air balloon was invented in 1783 when two French
papermakers launched a balloon that was made from cloth, lined with
paper and filled with smoke, but it took more than 200 years to
achieve an around-the-world trip.</TE>
<TE>   There are 5,000 to 6,000 balloonists in the U.S. Fewer than 10
have attempted around-the-world flights, according to Rick Jones,
president of the Balloon Federation of America.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's the food. At one point in Fossett's flight, he sent an
e-mail to mission control reporting on his meals. The macadamia nuts
and three-bean salad were OK, but the mashed potatoes? "I'd like to
say it's good," said Fossett, who had to put on his oxygen mask
between bites.</TE>
<TE>   "But it isn't."</TE>

<HD>Aniston Settles Suit Against Magazines</HD>
<DH>Celebrity: Actress had sued over publication of photo of
her sunbathing topless in her backyard. Details of agreement are not
disclosed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Jennifer Aniston settled a federal lawsuit Tuesday against
two men's magazines that published a photo of her sunbathing topless
in her backyard.</LD>
<LD>   Accompanied by her actor-husband, Brad Pitt, Aniston spent three
hours in the chambers of U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew, where
terms of the settlement were hammered out.</LD>
<LD>   No details were disclosed, but both sides described the settlement
as amicable. Aniston and Pitt were whisked away by security officers
afterward.</LD>
<TE>   The 33-year-old actress, who stars in the hit television series
"Friends," was prepared to begin trial Tuesday in her suit against
the publishers of Celebrity Skin, which featured the topless photo in
its September 1999 issue, and High Society, which printed it in its
December 1999 issue.</TE>
<TE>   Man's World Publications publishes Celebrity Skin, and Crescent
Publishing Group publishes High Society.</TE>
<TE>   Aniston contended in her lawsuit that a "stalkerazzi" with a
telephoto lens scaled a neighbor's eight-foot wall and snapped shots
of her "reclining topless in her backyard, wearing only her panties."</TE>
<TE>   She said publication of the photo caused her shame, humiliation,
anger and emotional distress.</TE>
<TE>   But lawyers for the magazines argued in court papers that the
photo was newsworthy. "Her body and her sex appeal are constant
subjects of news coverage about her," they asserted.</TE>
<TE>   They also charged that Aniston owes much of her worldwide fame to
the fact that she has been promoted as a sex symbol.</TE>
<TE>   Aniston's lawsuit accused the magazines of invading her privacy
through the publication of private facts and using her image for
commercial purposes without her consent.</TE>
<TE>   Lew dismissed the invasion of privacy claim in June because the
photo had appeared in European magazines before being published in
Celebrity Skin and High Society.</TE>
<TE>   The picture was published in the April 1999 issues of Eva Tremila,
an Italian magazine, and Daily Sport, a British newspaper, and in the
May 31-June 6 issue of Voici, a French magazine.</TE>

<HD>Peru Trek Claims 3 Southland Hikers</HD>
<DH>Mountaineering: The body of one man is recovered, the
others are feared dead after an ice avalanche at 18,000 feet. The
friends were veteran climbers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the only way to get to the highest peaks--you have to take small
steps.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Erskine, Bill Stampfl and Matthew Richardson knew this,
which is why they spent so many hours trekking up and down Mt. Baldy
in the San Gabriel Mountains, picturing higher mountains to scale.</LD>
<LD>   Their latest excursion was supposed to be a 19-day round-trip from
their Southland homes to Peru's tallest summit, Mt. Huascaran. They
were supposed to be back Sunday, bearing stories, pictures and
probably the name of the next mountain on their list.</LD>
<TE>   But Huascaran kept them.</TE>
<TE>   Erskine, Stampfl and Richardson were caught in an ice avalanche
while scaling the mountain June 24. Only Erskine's body has been
found.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, their families shared stories about the three
experienced climbers, some still holding out hope that Stampfl and
Richardson may have survived.</TE>
<TE>   Erskine's children answered calls in their Chino home from
well-wishers, planning a memorial service that they expect will
attract hundreds who knew him and the other climbers.</TE>
<TE>   Although each man took a different path to reach Huascaran, their
trails all seemed to lead through Mt. Baldy. They had become friends
through climbing. Stampfl was the oldest at 58, Richardson the young
one at 40. Erskine was 51.</TE>
<TE>   One of Stampfl's first climbs--the one that got him hooked--was to
Baldy's summit. Erskine routinely climbed Mt. Baldy, often twice in a
day, as if it were a 7,500-foot staircase. Richardson, of Claremont,
proposed there to his wife, Anne Marie, two years ago on Valentine's
Day.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson, an elementary school teacher, taught at an
appropriately named Montclair school, Monte Vista. He used his June
vacations to plan climbing expeditions.</TE>
<TE>   Erskine's children--Jeffrey, 24; Nicholas, 20; and Natalie,
18--recalled hikes to Baldy's summit with their father, who they said
remained in better shape than any of them. When Jeffrey was 13, his
father carried him on his back to simulate the roughly 100-pound load
he'd carry on another mountain expedition.</TE>
<TE>   The Erskine children on Tuesday planned another trek to Baldy's
summit, their first together in several years. They plan to take
their father's ashes and scatter them at the summit.</TE>
<TE>   Janet Stampfl recalled the soreness her husband had after his
first trip up Mt. Baldy. He'd improved to the point where he and
Erskine mused--jokingly, she said--about scaling Mt. Everest.</TE>
<TE>   At Kemper Enterprises in Chino, reports of the disaster hit extra
hard. Erskine worked there as the company's vice president and
financial officer for nearly 10 years. Kemper's president, Herb
Stampfl, is missing climber Bill Stampfl's older brother.</TE>
<TE>   The three friends traveled the world to scale mountains. Their
climbing resumes included some of the world's most recognizable
peaks: Denali, Kilimanjaro, Shasta and Rainier.</TE>
<TE>   Erskine was famous in his family for making a journey from
California's Sierra to Fairbanks, Alaska. On foot.</TE>
<TE>   Anne Marie and Matthew Richardson celebrated their honeymoon atop
Africa's Mt. Kilimanjaro. Erskine and Stampfl, who were close friends
as well as climbing partners, spent last summer climbing mountains in
Ecuador.</TE>
<TE>   Stampfl, a self-employed civil engineer born in Austria, completed
much of the itinerary for the Huascaran climb from his Chino home. As
with all climbers, weight mattered. Each man would have carried more
than 60 pounds on his back for the seven-day ascent to Huascaran's
summit.</TE>
<TE>   By June 24, the day of the avalanche, the climbers' ounce-by-ounce
planning and short steps to conserve energy would have had them at
18,000 feet, well over halfway to the top.</TE>
<TE>   Family members speculated about what the men would have done had
they reached Huascaran's 22,000-foot summit.</TE>
<TE>   Erskine, a devout Christian who through relief organizations
sponsored several children in other countries, would have left a
Bible wrapped in a weatherproof bag.</TE>
<TE>   Stampfl would have left probably the lightest items in his pack: a
tiny bag of origami turtles, a gift from his wife, Janet. "It was a
running joke," she said. "Since I couldn't go, the turtles went
instead."</TE>
<TE>   Richardson probably wouldn't have left anything.</TE>
<TE>   But Anne Marie Richardson said he would repeat what he had done
atop dozens of mountains before. He'd pull out a photograph, then ask
one of his climbing buddies to take a picture of him, Anne Marie's
picture in hand.</TE>

<HD>Another Dead Infant Found at a Dump</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The body of an infant was found Tuesday in the trash at a recycling
center in Walnut Park, officials said, the second such discovery in
recent weeks.</LD>
<LD>   An employee at Best Way Recycling on Firestone Boulevard saw the
baby and called the Sheriff's Department about 5:45 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Officials didn't know whether the child was a boy or girl, said
Sgt. Rich Longshore.</LD>
<TE>   On June 10, the body of a newborn girl with umbilical cord still
attached was found on a conveyer belt among garbage and recyclables
at a recycling plant in the City of Industry. Officials think the
trash load that contained that baby came from Azusa, but they have
not learned whom she belonged to, Longshore said.</TE>
<TE>   Longshore said he named that baby Amanda, after a friend told him
the name means "deserving of love." He arranged for her to be buried
in the Garden of Angels, a cemetery for abandoned babies.
Investigators plan to attend the service.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, a newborn boy was found alive in a cardboard box
outside a downtown Los Angeles apartment. He was about 2 hours old
and was dressed in clean clothes, officials said. The 5-pound,
4-ounce newborn was treated at County-USC Medical Center and released
to the county's custody.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, a baby girl was found outside an apartment in
Panorama City, naked and covered in blood. She was treated and also
turned over to the county.</TE>
<TE>   A California law allows a woman to leave her baby at a hospital,
health clinic or fire station within 72 hours of delivery without
being questioned or prosecuted. In the last few months, two babies
have been surrendered under the safe haven law, officials said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Forty-nine inmates held on nonviolent misdemeanor charges and with
bails of less than $25,000 have been released under a new Sheriff's
Department policy to reduce jail costs.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, 2,300 inmates were released under a policy then in
effect that required them to have served at least 70% of their
sentences for misdemeanors.</LD>
<LD>   Under the new policy, suspects arrested on misdemeanor charges
that would fall below the bail threshold, instead of being
incarcerated, will be given citations and released pending future
court dates. Sheriff's officials said the releases are needed so that
the department can save about $20 million a year by closing the
Century Regional Detention Center in Lynwood and the Biscailuz
Recovery Center.</LD>

vote, with one abstention, shows the board is divided in advance of a
campaign for a $3.3-billion construction bond measure and labor
negotiations this fall.</LD>
<LD>   Marlene Canter, David Tokofsky and Jose Huizar backed Young for
the presidency--the same group that voted for her one year ago.
Opposing were Julie Korenstein and Genethia Hudley-Hayes, who lobbied
other board members to regain the presidency she held before Young.

<HD>Airport Security Upgrade Plan Lags</HD>
<DH>Burbank: Officials say city ordinance may hinder meeting
U.S.-imposed deadline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Burbank Airport officials said Tuesday they may not meet a year-end
deadline for security upgrades mandated by Congress because a city
ordinance prohibits construction at the airport without voters'
approval.</LD>
<LD>   The nine-member Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority, which
oversees airport operations, voted in May to add 40,000 square feet
of space to accommodate new baggage screening equipment and security
personnel to comply with the Aviation and Transportation Security Act
of 2001, passed by Congress after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   But an initiative passed by Burbank voters in October bars city
approval "of any new, rebuilt, relocated or expanded airport
facility, under any conditions or due to any circumstances," unless
the authority implements a limit on the number of flights and a
curfew.</LD>
<TE>   "We are required to install the new baggage-inspection machines
required by federal law before the end of the year," Burbank Airport
spokesman Victor Gill said. "It appears we can't get started to meet
that goal because of the city's moratorium."</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials say they want to enclose an area behind a ticket
counter at one of the terminals that houses baggage-detection
equipment. They also want to increase the width of a passenger
checkpoint corridor to accommodate additional screening equipment,
Gill said.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank City Manager Robert R. Ovrom said it was premature for
airport officials to issue a statement indicating the airport would
not meet the U.S. mandate.</TE>
<TE>   "To put out a press release saying the city put up roadblocks is
misdirected." Ovrom said. "The roadblocks were put up by the
voter-approved initiative, which the city has been trying to get the
courts to invalidate," he said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Classrooms, like the teachers who teach in them, send a message to
students. And in Lynn Santamaria's classroom at Glendale's Hoover
High School, the message is crystal clear: Go To College. Exclamation
point.</LD>
<LD>   On one wall is a list of college acceptances won by this year's
crop of seniors to places such as UC Irvine, UCLA, UC Davis, USC.
Pennants from Yale and Duke and other colleges hang from another
wall. . Interspersed are inspirational messages, such as "''Set your
goals high and rise to meet them."</LD>
<LD>   The sentiment might seem a bit corny. But only if all of the
hoopla didn't deliver a payoff.</LD>
<TE>   Santamaria and Ruth Stanton-McAtee, who teaches next door, are
co-coordinators of the school's mentoring and counseling program
known as AVID--which stands for Advancement Via Individual
Determination.</TE>
<TE>   The program started in San Diego in 1980 and now operates in 1,275
middle and high schools in 21 states and 16 countries. The program's
goal is to reach out to students in the middle range of achievement,
adolescents who have great potential but are not meeting it. They are
B and C students whose teachers say could do much better if they were
motivated and put in a group of other youngsters who cheer one
another on to success.</TE>
<TE>   According to AVID's data, nearly 60% of its graduates were
accepted at four-year colleges in 1999, more than twice the statewide
percentage of all high schoolers. That makes it a valuable asset for
the state, which is facing a class action lawsuit by the ACLU and
other advocacy groups that accuse public education of doing little to
prepare minority and low-income students for college.</TE>
<TE>   AVID students at Hoover usually start their school day an hour
earlier than others, for a period of checking homework in groups,
studying and preparing college applications. For another hour, later
in the day, they come together again for tutoring and to work on
study skills, note taking and essay writing. Seniors conduct
college-style discussions in the Socratic questioning method.</TE>
<TE>   "AVID embodies the reasons I became a teacher," said
Stanton-McAtee. "If you want to inspire and support students to be
the very, very best and reach their greatest potential, then AVID is
the program that does that."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, they push their close-knit group of students to take
college prep and advanced placement classes. Stanton-McAtee has even
typed papers for harried students because, as she says, "that's what
a mom would do."</TE>
<TE>   Such aspirations might be second nature to many students whose
parents went to college or who live in affluent neighborhoods. But
the students served by AVID typically are the first in their families
to even consider college. Many of their parents came to the U.S. from
other countries, in search of greater opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   AVID tries to ensure that students don't get lost in the large,
confusing, understaffed high schools that seem endemic to urban
areas. Its teachers identify students as early as the 6th grade and
make sure they take the classes starting in the 7th grade that will
make them eligible for college six years later.</TE>
<TE>   Santamaria and Stanton-McAtee light a fire under Hoover's 215 AVID
students and then keep fanning the flames.</TE>
<TE>   Kritika Kapoor, 14, has felt the heat.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, in her first semester at Hoover, Kritika was
struggling, even though she already was in AVID. Stanton-McAtee
called her parents in for a conference. Though Kritika wasn't happy
about that, she buckled down afterward. She's getting A's and Bs now
and, in retrospect, is grateful Stanton-McKee was there to catch her
before it was too late.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized she was right," Kritika said recently, as the school
year wound down. "And that's why I want her as my teacher next year
because if it happens again, she'd push me."</TE>
<TE>   Nurtured by her AVID teachers as well as her fellow students,
Caroline Cortes blossomed into a confident junior who will head the
program's student governing council at Hoover next year. "I wasn't
into schoolwork or activities in junior high," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Santamaria came to her middle school and invited her to join
AVID. Cortes thought she'd go to a community college to become a
licensed practical nurse , just like her mother. Now, she plans to
attend a four-year university to study to be a registered nurse.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to get into a good college, this can help you,"
Cortes said.</TE>
<TE>   AVID's strong record has fueled a rapid expansion. In 2001, 55,000
California students were enrolled in AVID programs in 865 schools.
For example, in Los Angeles County, 160 middle and high schools now
have AVID programs, an 82% increase in the past three years.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing the program's effectiveness, the state turned to AVID
to help it increase the number of minority high school students
taking challenging advanced placement classes.</TE>
<TE>   Local districts fund the AVID teachers' salaries, and the state
invested $12.3 million last year to hire coaches to continue
expansion and maintain its quality.</TE>
<TE>   But then, this spring, the Davis administration, facing a massive
deficit in the state budget, proposed cutting AVID's funding in half.
The state legislative committee working on the budget has restored
the money, but AVID's backers still worry that Davis might cut it out
again.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Catherine Swanson, the San Diego teacher who started AVID,
says that would be shortsighted. "We figured it out," she said. "AVID
costs about $1 per student per school day."</TE>
<TE>   If the cuts were to go through, Stanton-McAtee said, Hoover High
would have to lay off tutors and turn away students.</TE>
<TE>   A healthy percentage of the Latino and black students who enter
the University of California or California State University come out
of AVID. In San Diego County, for example, 42% of the Latino high
school graduates who enroll in CSU and 20% of those who enroll in UC
are AVID graduates.</TE>
<TE>   At Hoover one day recently, 15-year-old Emil Bagherloo spent an
hour with his fellow AVID students, poring over algebra problems.
Asked where he plans to attend college, Emil quickly corrected the
questioner.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to college, I'm going to a university," he said,
confidently.</TE>
<TE>   That's not something, however, that he talks about much around
campus. If you're a "school boy," he said, "people make fun of you.
So I keep it to myself."</TE>
<TE>   Among his peers in AVID, however, it's not a secret. Every AVID
student plans to go to a university, he said.</TE>

<HD>Energy Transcript Questioned</HD>
<DH>Probe: Lawmakers say DWP document on transaction does not
match audiotapes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL and SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Senate investigators Tuesday questioned why the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power gave them a transcript last week that
does not match audiotapes of an energy trader phone conversation that
briefly resulted in higher electricity prices.</LD>
<LD>   Lawmakers warned that DWP officials risk contempt charges if they
altered or fabricated the transcript.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to know the proverbial 'who knew what, when' about that
transcript," said Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), chairman of the Senate
select committee investigating manipulation of California's
electricity market. "Where it came from, how it was created and what
it relates to."</LD>
<TE>   In response to the Senate investigation and a request by Mayor
James K. Hahn, DWP General Manager David H. Wiggs announced at a DWP
commission meeting Tuesday that he had hired a Washington, D.C.,
energy law firm, Van Ness Feldman, to scrutinize the city-owned
utility's trading and marketing practices. DWP and the city
attorney's office did a preliminary investigation over the weekend,
interviewing about 50 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Documents obtained by Dunn's committee appear to implicate DWP in
a November 2000 electricity sale dubbed a "ricochet," in which power
is exported out of California so that it can be bought back at a
higher price.</TE>
<TE>   "We still believe there was no Enron-type transaction, no ricochet
transaction," said Wiggs, who took his position after the power sales
now under scrutiny occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Still, to assuage lingering concerns, Wiggs said the law firm will
review taped telephone calls and transactions and focus on any that
are questionable. A final report from Van Ness Feldman is expected in
September.</TE>
<TE>   Commission President Kenneth T. Lombard said he believes that the
utility has done nothing wrong. He railed about the politically
charged atmosphere of the Senate hearings and said DWP employees were
"ambushed" during Dunn's hearing last week.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to be prepared when we go to these hearings," Lombard
said.</TE>
<TE>   DWP officials arrived to testify in Sacramento last week with a
17-page transcript of DWP trader conversations. They released the
transcript--which includes a DWP trader asking a state grid operator
to explain a "ricochet"--to dispute allegations that the DWP engaged
in such deals.</TE>
<TE>   DWP officials testified to lawmakers that the utility simply
fulfilled a request to move power from Arizona to Northern California
and was not trying to drive up the price of power.</TE>
<TE>   But a separate transcript of conversations recorded by the PG&amp;E
National Energy Group and obtained by Dunn's committee documents
DWP's involvement in what others described as a ricochet scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than placate lawmakers, the DWP transcript raised questions
about why it differs from the 40-page PG&amp;E transcript. Energy
companies routinely record their traders' phone conversations.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn called the DWP and PG&amp;E transcriptions "irreconcilable." The
committee sent a staff person to Los Angeles on Monday to listen to
DWP's audio recordings from the night of Nov. 11, 2000, Dunn said,
and found that the tape matches the PG&amp;E transcript but is not
reproduced entirely in the DWP's transcript.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn said the committee probably will hold a hearing next week to
determine whether DWP's transcript is a compilation of several
conversations, a discussion of an entirely separate incident or
"simply created out of whole cloth."</TE>
<TE>   Wiggs was not available to explain the source of the phone
transcript.</TE>
<TE>   It revolves around a brief, multiple-step deal in which PG&amp;E sold
power to DWP for $50 per megawatt-hour, and DWP used its rights to
transmission lines to move the electricity to the Oregon border. DWP
then sold some of the power back to PG&amp;E, which sold it to
Constellation Energy, which then sold it to the California
Independent System Operator for about $250 per megawatt-hour.</TE>
<TE>   When PG&amp;E and DWP tried to continue their arrangement, it was
canceled by Cal-ISO, which operates most of the state's transmission
grid. The Cal-ISO worker who halted the transaction called it a
ricochet and said it violated Cal-ISO rules.</TE>
<TE>   Ricochet is among the strategies for boosting profits in the
California electricity market that Enron Corp. traders described in a
December 2000 memo. Federal regulators made that memo public in May,
then asked dozens of energy companies to swear under oath as to
whether they had engaged in similar schemes.</TE>
<TE>   DWP officials declared to the federal regulators and to Dunn's
committee that they had not engaged in ricochet transactions--or any
of the tactics described by Enron--in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Thursday, the special Senate committee investigating the
electricity crisis voted to review documents and e-mails that Enron
said it mistakenly submitted last month.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for the bankrupt Houston company asked the committee
to give back several computer disks because some might contain
communications protected from the committee's subpoena by
attorney-client privilege.</TE>
<TE>   But lawmakers refused to give Enron the benefit of the doubt,
noting that the company appears to have tampered with, destroyed or
written over many of the computer files it submitted.</TE>
<TE>   "My working assumption," said Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey),
"is that the company is not respectful of this process and could use
any or all mechanisms available to it to avoid turning over
information."</TE>

<HD>Latino League Enters Fray With Flynn</HD>
<DH>Dispute: A forceful letter demands that the Oxnard
supervisor cease 'maligning and intimidating' community leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Latino civil rights group on Tuesday condemned Ventura County
Supervisor John Flynn for allegedly making disparaging comments about
the wife of Oxnard's mayor and warned that the veteran politician
will face "consequences" if he does not back off.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter hand-delivered to Flynn's office in south Oxnard,
leaders of a local chapter of the League of United Latino American
Citizens demanded that the supervisor "cease and desist the
maligning, intimidating, threatening and harassing of constituents
and community leaders."</LD>
<LD>   The letter refers to a well-publicized allegation by Irma Lopez,
wife of Oxnard Mayor Manny Lopez, that Flynn shouted, "I'm gonna get
you!" at her as she left a Democratic Party picnic June 22.</LD>
<TE>   Flynn denied making the threat and in turn accused Lopez and other
Latino community leaders of orchestrating a smear campaign against
him in an attempt to oust him from office and fill his seat with a
Latino politician.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn told The Times that Lopez "won't be happy until she sees a
sea of brown faces in every political office in west Ventura County."
He told the Ventura County Star newspaper that she wanted Latino
politicians "regardless of their capabilities."</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, local league chapter President Denis O'Leary and
state Vice President David M. Rodriguez said the group "will not
allow elected representatives to denigrate the leadership of our
community without consequence."</TE>
<TE>   O'Leary said the group hasn't decided what it will do should Flynn
ignore its offer to meet and resolve the dispute. Options range from
withholding political muscle in Flynn's reelection campaign to
bringing legal action.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't want it to go to any extremes," O'Leary said.</TE>
<TE>   "I really want this to be settled immediately and cordially. But
as a community, we can't tolerate these verbal attacks."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Flynn continued to defend his remarks as appropriate
and necessary to expose what he sees as an organized attempt to
discredit his political reputation.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that O'Leary is a teacher in the Rio Elementary School
District. One of Flynn's well-known political enemies is that
district's superintendent, Yolanda Benitez, with whom he has argued
with for months over use of a school gymnasium he helped get built.</TE>
<TE>   The league's entrance into the fight illustrates a deepening
divide between Flynn and an influential faction of Oxnard leaders
that includes the city's popular mayor and his politically connected
wife.</TE>
<TE>   Although Flynn's 5th District has been predominantly Latino for
many years, the veteran supervisor has received solid support from
the constituency until recently.</TE>
<TE>   O'Leary acknowledged that Flynn, a liberal Democrat, has ably
served his Oxnard district for 26 years.</TE>
<TE>   But the face-off with Lopez, and claims by other Latino leaders
that Flynn has berated them publicly as well, has forced the league
to take action, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Conspiracy Denied</TE>
<TE>   He denied there is a conspiracy to harm Flynn's reputation, saying
he has not talked to his boss, Benitez, since school ended weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I want Flynn to continue to do good work," O'Leary said. "He has
at least two years to continue representing us. We need to get beyond
these problems."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the current spat, Flynn likely will have little trouble
winning reelection in 2004, should he choose to seek an eighth term,
one political analyst said.</TE>
<TE>   Although his district is 65% Latino, Latinos turn out to vote in
much lower numbers than whites, said Herb Gooch, chairman of the
political science department at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand
Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   And turnout will be low to begin with, because 2004 is an off-year
election, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be very difficult to organize enough opposition to push
an old warhorse like Flynn out of office," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With his track record supporting farm workers' issues and civil
rights, Flynn has won the loyal support of many Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   One of them is John Cobian, president of the Mexican American
Political Forum, an Oxnard-based Latino advocacy group. Cobian
accused Lopez and others of being "carpetbaggers" trying to grab
power with "cheap tactics." Their claims are counterproductive,
Cobian said, because they are badly dividing the Latino community.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a Mexican American and, believe me, I would love to have a
qualified Hispanic in that position," he said. "But not in this way.
This is hitting below the belt."</TE>

<HD>Police Kill Suspect After Freeway Chase</HD>

<LD>Throwing money out the windows, four robbery suspects led police on
an hourlong chase Tuesday that ended when their SUV caught fire in
Pacoima and one suspect was fatally shot as he emerged pointing a gun
at police, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The Golden State Freeway was shut down in both directions at 6:35
p.m. and remained closed hours later except for two southbound lanes,
backing up traffic for miles.</LD>
<LD>   About 5:30 p.m., two men walked into Public Storage on Firestone
Place in South Gate, pointing guns and taking about $2,500 and the
tape from the surveillance camera, South Gate Police Lt. Bill Richert
said.</LD>
<TE>   As the men fled in a GMC Jimmy, a witness followed them, flagging
sheriff's deputies at Somerset and Paramount boulevards, who picked
up the chase. One of the robbers fired at the witness as he chased
them, Richert said</TE>
<TE>   The SUV clipped several cars and mowed down a street sign in
downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   As they fled north on the freeway, the suspects threw money out
the windows. But just north of the Ronald Reagan Freeway, the car
stalled, its left rear tire ground to metal, which sparked a fire.
For several seconds, the men remained in the burning car, then ran as
they raised their hands in surrender.</TE>
<TE>   One man pointed a gun at officers as he got out and was shot to
death, said California Highway Patrol Chief Gary Eberhard.</TE>
<TE>   "The car was on fire and they weren't getting out of the car, and
I heard all these pops," said Yoran Schechter, 42, of Agua Dulce, who
was on the freeway. "I thought maybe it was the tires blowing, and
then I realized it was gunshots and I tried to stay as far away as I
could."</TE>
<TE>   As the remaining suspects lay on the asphalt, wind blew money
across the freeway. Officers later found most of it.</TE>
<TE>   The names of the suspects have not been released. Police said two
of those who survived are juveniles.</TE>
<TE>   None of the employees at Public Storage was hurt, but a pregnant
worker was hospitalized as a precautionary measure, Richert said.</TE>

<HD>Church-State Line Is Still Blurred After Rulings</HD>
<DH>Religion: Decisions on the Pledge of Allegiance and school
vouchers continue a tradition of debate as old as the nation itself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two U.S. court opinions last week show why disagreements over the
relationship between God and public life in America are so
perennial--and so bedeviling.</LD>
<LD>   First, a federal appeals court ruled that religion could not be
part of a daily ritual of public school life: the Pledge of
Allegiance. The next day, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that religious
schools could receive public school dollars.</LD>
<LD>   The deep disagreement over where the dividing line should lie
between church and state was evident in the way so many people loved
one ruling but hated the other. This tension, nearly as old as the
republic itself, is apparent in myriad contradictions in government
policies on religion. For example, public schools are not allowed to
post the Ten Commandments, but the U.S. Supreme Court chambers
display a representation of Moses with the tablets. Prayer is not
allowed in public schools, but taxpayers foot the bill for chaplains
to lead prayers in Congress and prisons.</LD>
<TE>   This church-state tension springs, in part, from two conflicting
desires: to uphold a bedrock principle of American life--separation
of church and state--and the belief of most Americans in a
transcendent force.</TE>
<TE>   Many Americans who accept a wall between church and state also
cherish what scholars call "civil religion." That is manifested in
generic references to the divine in American currency, the national
motto and presidential inaugural addresses, as well as in displays
honoring Christmas and Hanukkah--and, more recently, Ramadan--on
public property.</TE>
<TE>   "A religious people want a transcendent dimension to the great
moments of national life, and the civil religion is one vehicle for
that," said Robert Benne, director of the Roanoke College Center for
Religion and Society in Salem, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Benne said civil religion sweeps in as a comforting force,
particularly during times of crisis. On the night of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, for instance, more than 100 members of Congress
stood on the steps of the Capitol to sing "God Bless America."</TE>
<TE>   The Pledge of Allegiance, scholars say, is one prominent symbol of
America's civil religion--one reason the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals decision striking it down provoked so much outrage from so
many people.</TE>
<TE>   "There is this pervasive sense that the nation is in trouble
morally," said Derek Davis, who directs the J.M. Dawson Institute of
Church-State Studies at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. "People are
looking for ways to have a more moral citizenry, for opportunities
for religion to surface in the public square."</TE>
<TE>   Some experts also suggest that the long national trend toward
"secular individualism" has run its course, creating a sense of
fragmentation that has led many Americans to long for more community.
Father Thomas Rausch, a theology professor at Loyola Marymount
University, said the pledge decision amounted to "one person's
view"--the atheist plaintiff's--"imposed on the common good."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a clash of values, between an individualistic ethos versus a
recognition of the importance of the common good," Rausch said.
"American society ... has focused on 'What is my right?' even if it
conflicts with a sense of community. But I do sense now that people
think things are out of control."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. C. Welton Gaddy, executive director of the
Washington-based Interfaith Alliance, sees less benign reasons for
the growing assertion of religion in public life. He said many
Christians who were once strong supporters of the separation of
church and state have increasingly called for exceptions as religious
diversity has grown in America.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly since changes to federal immigration law in 1965, the
nation's religious landscape has been reshaped by new waves of
Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and other minority groups. Some
conservative Christian leaders have denounced the growing diversity
from the pulpit and called for a new reassertion of the nation's
"Judeo-Christian heritage" in public life.</TE>
<TE>   "Religious diversity has made very nervous people who in former
days were stronger supporters of" church-state separation, said
Gaddy, a Baptist minister in Louisiana. "I have a hunch that we have
people who have been speaking out of both sides of their mouths."</TE>
<TE>   The more prominent role of religion in public life was apparent in
the last presidential election, when Republican candidate George W.
Bush, Democratic candidate Al Gore and Gore's vice presidential
running mate, Joseph Lieberman, all gave frequent public testimonials
about the place of faith in their lives. President Bush subsequently
launched a landmark--and hotly controversial--initiative to allow
more faith-based organizations to receive public dollars to carry out
welfare and other social-service programs.</TE>
<TE>   The current resurgence of religion in the public square reflects
that latest swing of a pendulum that has tipped back and forth for
centuries.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's first prominent religious minority, Catholics, began
a long fight to excise religious exercises from public schools,
beginning in the mid-1850s, said the Rev. Thomas Curry, auxiliary
bishop of Santa Barbara and author of "Farewell to Christendom," a
book published last year on church-state relations.</TE>
<TE>   Curry said Catholics protested because most of the religious
practices in use were distinctively Protestant, such as use of the
King James version of the Bible. He said Catholics were a "major
influence" in removing some readings and hymns from public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and other scholars said courts during the 1960s and '70s
adopted a fairly strict line between church and state--with the U.S.
Supreme Court throwing out all prayers in public schools in 1963, for
instance.</TE>
<TE>   Two decades later, a backlash began against what many saw as
government hostility toward religion rather than the neutrality they
argued the U.S. Constitution called for. In 1981, the high court
declared that public schools that allowed secular groups to use their
facilities for after-hours activities had to extend equal access to
religious groups.</TE>
<TE>   The drumbeat for "government neutrality" helped drive Bush's
faith-based initiative--and the Cleveland school voucher program.
Proponents argued that recipients of welfare payments or vouchers
should be able to use them at institutions of their choice, secular
or religious, with appropriate guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Monsma, a scholar of church-state issues at Pepperdine
University in Malibu, said religion and government will be in
conflict "as long as our country lasts." They "are two of the most
robust and powerful institutional forces in society. When you've got
two 300-pound gorillas in the same room, they're going to bump into
each other."</TE>

<HD>'This Is Someone's Life Here'</HD>
<DH>Deaths: Relatives were not told that two patients who died
at hospital had contracted Legionnaires' disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN and LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Relatives of two people who contracted Legionnaires' disease and died
at Good Samaritan Hospital since May said doctors at the downtown Los
Angeles facility did not inform them of the patients'
hospital-acquired respiratory infections.</LD>
<LD>   At least, that was the case until Tuesday, when the children of
one of the patients were telephoned by the hospital's chief of staff,
told of the infection and warned to expect a call from a reporter
about the case. The patient, Kwok Hin Cheng, 65, died on June 15.</LD>
<LD>   "They should have informed us about it," said Anderson Cheng, 25,
the man's son. "Of course, they're trying to cover themselves now.
This is someone's life here."</LD>
<TE>   Death certificates for the two patients, prepared by Good
Samaritan physicians, do not list Legionnaires' disease as the cause
of death or as a significant contributing condition, although one
certificate mentions pneumonia, which can be caused by the Legionella
pneumophila bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital previously had said that it was uncertain what role
Legionnaires' may have played in the deaths. In a written statement
Tuesday, Good Samaritan said no patients had died as a result of
hospital-acquired Legionnaires' disease, even though lab tests showed
the presence of L. pneumophila in the two patients who died.</TE>
<TE>   "We take our obligation seriously to keep patients and family
members informed of their medical condition," the statement said. "In
the case of death, the next of kin is always informed of our current
understanding of the cause of death."</TE>
<TE>   Seven other patients became ill with Legionnaires' disease at good
Samaritan, beginning in January, but all are recovering or have
recovered after being given antibiotics. A person contracts the
infection by breathing mist that comes from a water source
contaminated with the L. pneumophila bacteria. Not all people exposed
become infected.</TE>
<TE>   Until Tuesday, Cheng's family believed that his heart "just gave
out," his son said. Cheng, a chef who immigrated to the United States
from Hong Kong in 1969, had recently taken his citizenship test.
Notice that he was to be sworn in as an American citizen arrived by
mail on the day of his funeral.</TE>
<TE>   "We were expecting my dad to come home," Anderson Cheng said.
"Everything was fine after his bypass. They told us everything was
fine. His heart was beating regularly."</TE>
<TE>   Several days before Cheng died, and about a week after his bypass
surgery, he was taken from his regular room to the intensive care
unit because of a buildup of fluid in his chest.</TE>
<TE>   On his death certificate, doctors listed Cheng's problems as
cardiopulmonary arrest, a lack of oxygen flowing to the tissues of
the heart, coronary artery disease and diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   The case of 67-year-old Charles Griego was similar, family members
said. Phillip Griego, a human resources manager for UPS, said doctors
told his family that his father had a "touch of pneumonia" and that
he had been given medication, but they weren't any more specific.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Griego seemed to be recovering from his heart bypass
surgery on May 3 at Good Samaritan, his son said. He was sitting up
in a chair, eating gelatin or ice cream, and cracking jokes with
family members.</TE>
<TE>   But within a week, Griego developed a high fever, loss of appetite
and had difficulty breathing--all symptoms of Legionnaires' disease.
He died May 12.</TE>
<TE>   Phillip Griego said he is disappointed that doctors never
mentioned that his father had contracted Legionnaires' disease in the
hospital.In fact, when he read about the outbreak in The Times this
week, he said, "I thought, 'Oh, I wonder what happened there?' I
never had even heard of it before."</TE>
<TE>   A Moral Responsibility</TE>
<TE>   Good Samaritan did not have a legal responsibility to tell
patients or their families about the outbreak, several medical
ethicists said, but they added that it did have a moral one. The same
moral responsibility applies, they said, if a doctor makes a mistake
during surgery or if a patient contracts a disease through a blood
transfusion.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that is a plausible factor in the death of a patient or
the continued prolonged illness of a patient or the worsening of a
patient is something the family is entitled to know," said Michael H.
Shapiro, a law professor at USC.</TE>
<TE>   "Sooner or later, the truth is going to come out and, if there's a
cover-up, it's going to look really, really bad. People think they
can get away with stuff by stonewalling and denying and not
disclosing information.... They are supposed to put their ...
patients' interests above their own."</TE>
<TE>   If Good Samaritan withheld information from patients about the
outbreak, that would be "indefensible," said bioethicist Gregory
Stock.</TE>
<TE>   "You can certainly see what the motivation of the hospital is not
to tell," said Stock, director of the Program on Medicine, Technology
and Society at UCLA's Geffen School of Medicine. "There probably are
all sorts of liability issues that are involved there."</TE>
<TE>   The state gives doctors considerable flexibility in deciding which
factors to list on a death certificate. Public health authorities say
Good Samaritan officials acted promptly in alerting them to the cases
and seeking immediate solutions.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital said patients and their families are told about
communicable diseases if the information is "medically significant"
and if the disease can be transmitted from person to person, which is
not the case for Legionnaires'.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County health officials have already acknowledged that
they should have been more forthcoming with the public about the
Legionnaires' outbreak at Good Samaritan. The county knew about the
problem as early as March but did not disclose it publicly until
Sunday when asked by a Times reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Responsibility rests with physicians, not the county, to notify
patients that they have contracted Legionnaires' disease, said John
Wallace, spokesman for the county Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   Good Samaritan says it has taken steps to contain the
outbreak--decontaminating its water system, replacing shower heads
and giving patients bottled water instead of tap water. The public
has never been at risk because Legionnaires' is not contagious.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, Legionnaires' disease affects 8,000 to 18,000 people
annually. Most cases are acquired in the home or community, not in
health-care facilities. The disease is fatal in 5% to 30% of cases,
according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Griego's widow, Lilly, said she has many questions for doctors and
hospital officials about the death of her husband of 52 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I would really like to look into it further to find out what
really happened, to find out what my husband really did die of," she
said. "He came out of the heart surgery great. Even the doctor said,
'Your husband is doing fine. He did good in surgery.' ... A couple
days later, he started going downhill, everything started going
wrong."</TE>

<CX>   Legionnaires' disease--In some editions of the July 3 California
section, a photo caption incorrectly reported that Charles Griego
died of Legionnaires' disease at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los
Angeles. Griego contracted the disease at the hospital, but doctors
there say he did not die of it. His death certificate lists the
primary cause of death as a heart ailment. In other editions, a photo
caption incorrectly implied that Griego's children had just learned
that their father died after heart surgery. In fact, they had just
learned of their father's infection with hospital- acquired
Legionnaires' disease.</CX>

<HD>There's No Holiday From Safety for County's Lifeguards</HD>
<DH>Precautions: Fourth of July is expected to bring out the
crowds, so beach authorities say they are preparing for the worst.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even before the man in the long-sleeved blue shirt abandoned his
bright-orange body board and frantically began swimming toward shore,
Julie Beeles knew that he was in trouble.</LD>
<LD>   "I could see he was trying to paddle in and that he wasn't getting
anywhere," said Beeles, a roving lifeguard at Huntington State Beach.
"I'll never understand why they ditch their boards when they get
caught in a rip current. We keep telling them: 'The board floats; you
don't.' "</LD>
<LD>   Before a nasty riptide could carry him helplessly out to sea, the
man and his body board were towed in by a lifeguard aboard a personal
watercraft.</LD>
<TE>   "I guess that kind of stuff makes our job fun," she said.</TE>
<TE>   If so, then the fun is just beginning for Beeles and the other 100
lifeguards who patrol Huntington and Bolsa Chica state beaches. In a
few days, lifeguards all along Southern California's coast will be
overwhelmed by beachgoers.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, lifeguards at Huntington and Bolsa Chica made 4,880
rescues. More than 50 came on one day--the Fourth of July. This year,
lifeguard supervisor Mike Broussard is trying to prepare for the
worst.</TE>
<TE>   About 75 lifeguards, or three-fourths of the staff, will be
deployed on the holiday. Some will monitor the 69-degree water from
lifeguard towers and trucks, some will make rescues from boats or
personal water crafts and others will keep the peace on ATVs,
bicycles and sport utility vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   And if Thursday's forecast holds--sunny weather and small
swells--it could be pretty crazy from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the one day of the year when it's almost anarchy," Broussard
said. "We pray a lot on the Fourth. We see a lot of people swimming
in their pants and T-shirts. And when the waves are smaller, it's
worse for us. Because everybody seems to want to charge the surf."</TE>
<TE>   One dangerous element has been taken out of mix--alcohol. Since
1992, alcohol has been banned at Huntington and Bolsa Chica. Since
then, there have only been four drownings--three last year, two of
them alcohol-related, and one this year. Before the ban, he said the
beach recorded far more drownings.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, banning alcohol doesn't stop the beach party. People
still find a way to sneak in a six-pack or a bottle of wine and some
will come to the beach after they've hit the local pubs.</TE>
<TE>   If the Fourth is anything like last year, Huntington and Bolsa
Chica will be jammed. By noon last year, all the parking lots were
full. In the afternoon, people began illegally parking cars along a
two-mile stretch of Pacific Coast Highway, from Beach Boulevard south
to the jetty. "We towed a lot of cars," Broussard said.</TE>
<TE>   Lifeguards also spent the day settling disputes over the beach's
201 fire rings and treating injured cyclists who tried to worm their
way through the crowds. They also treated unsuspecting swimmers who
stepped on sting rays. To prepare his staff for the crush, Broussard
had each lifeguard take a refresher course on CPR and first aid.</TE>
<TE>   Because the beach is flooded with families on a holiday, it is
almost certain there will be lost children--a pet peeve of lifeguard
Cory Tague.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not uncommon for us to hold 20 or 25 kids on a weekend day,"
Tague said. "I can't believe how many parents just let their kids go
in the water and then turn around and forget about them. Because they
see lifeguards, they think their kids are safe. They don't understand
the hidden dangers."</TE>
<TE>   On this weekday afternoon, the hidden danger is a strong rip
current bending around Towers 5 and 6 at Huntington State Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Looking through his black polarized sunglasses, Tague is able to
predict the next rescue.</TE>
<TE>   "Something's about to happen here," Tague, 26, said. "With these
glasses, you can spot the rip currents pretty easily. Just look for
the brown areas of foamy water moving out to sea."</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, two body boarders are led ashore by a lifeguard.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd rather get there too soon and not have to make a rescue,"
Tague said. "It's a lot better than getting there too late."</TE>

<LD>The latest alert from Homeland Security didn't do it.</LD>
<LD>   The possibility of an Independence Day attack doesn't seem to be
doing it.</LD>
<LD>   And the unsettling announcement of a plan to distribute
radiation-fighting medicine tablets isn't doing it, either.</LD>
<TE>   Attendance is stubbornly up at San Onofre State Beach, a surfer's
paradise in the shadow of a nuclear power plant, and nothing short of
Al Qaeda terrorists riding sharks is going to keep anyone out of the
water.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just waste the rest of your life being upset about
things," said Bob Kennedy, who makes surfboards for a living and
signs them Bob-O. His straw-hatted buddy swigged Tecate beer and
agreed there is no percentage in fretting about the unknown. The
whole point of coming to the beach is to leave your worries behind.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 surfers were in the water at lunchtime Monday.
Lifeguard Evan Price said that on many days, there's a line of cars
waiting to get into the state park at 6 in the morning. Attendance is
running 20% over last year, added ranger Doug Harding, and last year
was bigger than ever.</TE>
<TE>   I wandered down the shore in the direction of the domed power
generators, which resemble giant igloos, and came upon swimming pool
contractor Mark Woodrome. He was playing hooky from work to sneak in
a surf, same as he's been doing for 28 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a crackup," Woodrome said of the state plan to distribute
potassium iodide tablets to more than 400,000 people who live within
10 miles of San Onofre, just in case there's a terrorist attack on
the power plant.</TE>
<TE>   If the plant gets hit, Woodrome said, nothing in the medicine
cabinet is going to save you. "Besides, we probably face a greater
radiation threat out here from the sun."</TE>
<TE>   Reminds me of a line from my brother, a stand-up comic, regarding
irrational fear about anthrax. We're addicted to triple bacon
cheeseburgers and Krispy Kremes, he says. Anthrax won't kill us, but
10 push-ups might.</TE>
<TE>   Woodrome happens to be correct about potassium iodide. It can
protect against only one of several types of radiation exposure.
Beyond that, the tablet is no more effective than ducking under a
desk. But if you do hit the floor, as we used to do in schoolroom
drills, and take potassium iodide, do you double your chances of
survival?</TE>
<TE>   Science does not yet know the answer. But there is a positive
side-effect from the mere distribution of potassium iodide: it
creates the appearance that the government is doing something
substantive to protect us.</TE>
<TE>   And appearing to be on the ball is a top political priority since
revelations that the FBI and CIA were roughly as professional as
F-Troop in handling Sept. 11 warnings.</TE>
<TE>   As I strolled the beach at San Onofre, Marine helicopters from
Camp Pendleton circled overhead and, speaking of threats to innocent
civilians, I considered diving for cover.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, U.S. military aircraft had just strafed another
village and might have inadvertently killed dozens at a wedding
party, possibly mistaking celebratory gunshots for enemy fire.</TE>
<TE>   One backfire from a surfer's pickup truck and we might all have
been goners.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd take a pill if it would help, but I can't live in fear of
anything," said Lois Kinsey, who stood on the beach waiting for a
friend. Kinsey called herself a "hair designer" and makeup artist at
the St. Regis resort "and globally." She wore a "Terminator" shirt
and said she did some of the hair in that movie, but not Arnold's.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no stress out here," she went on, gazing across turquoise
water and sunlit foam as if worshiping at a religious shrine. "God is
not my boss and he's not me, but there's a source of strength that's
in nature."</TE>
<TE>   At the south end of the beach, NBC's "Today Show" was taping a
story on Southern California surfing legend Mickey Munoz. He's the
guy who donned a wig many years ago and walked a board, doubling for
Gidget in the movies.</TE>
<TE>   Munoz caught a few waves and then paddled in to get the on-air
talent, newswoman Ann Curry, for her first surfing lesson.</TE>
<TE>   Before heading back out, Munoz told me he's been surfing at San
Onofre for 50 years and doesn't intend to be driven away by
unspecific threats from unknown evil-doers.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a 'be-here-now' aspect to catching a wave," says Steve
Pezman, publisher of the Surfer's Journal.</TE>
<TE>   You could say we're all on that board now, and maybe there's
something to be learned from the regulars at San Onofre.</TE>
<TE>   Light a sparkler tomorrow. Throw a burger on the grill. Ride the
big one.</TE>
<TE>   And Happy Fourth.</TE>

<DH>Investigation: U.S. Justice Department is looking into
possible civil rights abuses at the Metropolitan hospital in Norwalk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating possible civil rights
abuses at Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk, a sprawling
facility that for years has been the subject of complaints about
excessive use of restraints and drugs to control child and adult
mental patients.</LD>
<LD>   Federal investigators arrived last week at Metropolitan, which
houses disturbed felons from state prison and is the last state
hospital to treat mentally ill children.</LD>
<LD>   Justice Department officials in Washington did not return calls
for comment, and the precise target of their investigation is not
known.</LD>
<TE>   Hospital spokesman Catherine Bernarding and others confirmed the
existence of the federal investigation. It is the third recent
federal civil rights investigation into the treatment of mentally ill
people in Los Angeles County. Investigators are also examining mental
health care in the county's jails and probation department, which
runs county probation camps and juvenile hall.</TE>
<TE>   Allegations of excessive restraints and medicating of patients
have dogged the 1,041-bed Metropolitan hospital for years. They rose
sharply in 1997, when the state shuttered Camarillo State Hospital
and moved the children who had been housed there to Metropolitan. The
combination of children as young as 11 and an increasing number of
disturbed inmates from state prisons has alarmed advocates for the
mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   The 803 patients include 370 prison inmates, housed behind razor
wire and guard towers on the opposite side of the 162-acre facility
from the 101 children, ages 11 to 18.</TE>
<TE>   "They've turned it into much more of a prison-like facility," said
James Preis of Mental Health Advocates. "It seems more like a holding
tank rather than a treatment facility."</TE>
<TE>   Bernarding, the hospital spokeswoman, disagreed sharply with that
assessment. "Patients are being actively treated and we're seeing
good results," she said. "The program compares very favorably to any
other program that treats patients that are this seriously ill."</TE>
<TE>   Bernarding said new procedures have decreased the use of
restraints on patients in the adolescent ward by 66% between 1999 and
this year. Five-point restraints--which bind a patient to a bed--were
used 127 times in May and 69 times in June, she said. Restraints are
used only in emergencies, she added, and the adolescent program is
trying to move toward a no-restraint policy.</TE>
<TE>   On the medication issue, Bernarding said that most patients in the
hospital were on medication before arriving at Metropolitan. The use
of medication is carefully overseen by physicians, she said, adding
that "medication has been shown to be extremely effective at treating
most mental illness." Of the 101 children at Metropolitan, nearly all
are on some form of medication, Bernarding said. On average, children
at Metropolitan have been rejected from 15 prior placements, such as
foster homes or group homes.</TE>
<TE>   The federal investigation set off an immediate reaction among the
facility's 1,800 staff members.</TE>
<TE>   An unsigned, five-page packet entitled "How to Survive a USDOJ
Survey" has been circulated at the hospital. It advises staff to
answer questions from federal investigators "directly and honestly,
but ... do not volunteer any information beyond what is specifically
requested." The documents also direct those interviewed to tell
supervisors what questions were asked and warns them that
investigators may try to trick them into confirming allegations
against the facility.</TE>
<TE>   "Think first before answering," the document says, "and then
answer the specific question honestly, nothing more."</TE>
<TE>   It states that federal investigators are expected to look at a
wide range of issues, from use of medications and restraints to staff
training.</TE>
<TE>   Bernarding said Tuesday that the document was not official and had
limited circulation. She added that the administration halted its
circulation and directed staff to disregard it but could not identify
who wrote it.</TE>
<TE>   Although some mental health advocates have long complained about
Metropolitan, some say that many of the hospital's problems stem from
the troubled overall state of California's mental health system and
are not unique to the Norwalk facility.</TE>
<TE>   The dwindling number of state hospitals and community clinics
means more mentally ill people end up untreated, coming to the
government's attention only when they commit crimes and end up in
jail, advocates and mental health officials say. Then those patients
are channeled to hospitals like Metropolitan.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't pay to treat them up front and then they go to jail and
come in, more expensive, through the back door," said Carla Jacobs, a
Los Angeles County mental health commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs said that although she is not intimately familiar with the
operations at Metropolitan, she does not think the problems are with
its staff.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not think you're going to find a bunch of Nurse Ratchets
running around," she said, in a reference to the abusive enforcer at
a mental hospital in the novel and movie "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last five years, state regulators have cited Metropolitan
for a number of violations, ranging from failure to fully supervise
suicidal patients to improper use of restraints. The greatest number
of citations were issued from 1997 and 1998, when the hospital
underwent a regular inspection as it was struggling to deal with an
influx of children from Camarillo State Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, for example, state inspectors found that four of eight
patients tied down to beds had developed untreated lesions. They also
cited the hospital for tying one patient to his bed for 10 years
without providing a plan for how he could correct his behavior and
get out of the restraints. Last year the hospital was cited again for
restraining a man after he flushed a profanity-laced note from his
roommates down the toilet.</TE>
<TE>   Pamila Lew, an attorney for Protection and Advocacy, which
represents the mentally ill, said her organization hired an expert to
review the files of a woman who has been restrained "on a daily
basis" for several years at Metropolitan. Lew said the expert
concluded that the restraints were being used to modify the patient's
behavior rather than to protect her, staff members or other patients.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally, restraints and seclusion should only be used when
someone's about to lash out," she said. "They use the restraints as
punishment."</TE>
<TE>   Lew and other advocates said another part of the problem is the
influx of state prisoners into the hospital. The passage of a law
requiring sexually violent predators to be housed in psychiatric
hospitals after serving their jail sentences has pushed other types
of criminal offenders into Metropolitan from the state's three other
psychiatric hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "They have increasing numbers of people who are coming from the
criminal justice system," Lew said. "It's unfortunate for everyone
there, because it's unclear what their purpose is."</TE>

<HD>Metrolink Proposes Deal to Keep Train Operators</HD>
<DH>Transit: The plan is designed to prevent commute
disruptions if troubled Amtrak, the workers' employer, folds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Metrolink officials are attempting to work out a deal to transfer
their work force of contracted Amtrak train operators to a freight
rail company, a move meant to ensure that the commuter railway is
unaffected by the potential shutdown of Amtrak later this year.</LD>
<LD>   Metrolink last week sent proposals to two short-haul freight rail
companies, asking them to bid on hiring the nearly 145 Amtrak workers
who run the commuter rail agency's 416-mile, six-county network.</LD>
<LD>   The request came despite a Bush administration deal Friday that
gave Amtrak a temporary reprieve. The nationwide railway, which is
about $4 billion in debt and on flimsy financial footing, had
threatened to start shutting down this week if it did not receive a
federal loan.</LD>
<TE>   The White House deal immediately lends Amtrak $100 million, an
amount officials hope will be bolstered by a $170-million package
from Congress to keep Amtrak trains running until this fall.</TE>
<TE>   A regionwide railway that handles about 34,000 trips each weekday,
many of them sending workers from suburbs to downtown Los Angeles,
Metrolink operations are directly linked to Amtrak. That's because
Metrolink's force of train operators, conductors and dispatchers are
all actually Amtrak employees.</TE>
<TE>   The commuter railway contracts with Amtrak, paying about $18
million per year to farm out the work, a move Metrolink's officials
say is meant to keep internal costs low and to keep Metrolink clear
of direct involvement with unions.</TE>
<TE>   Metrolink officials are worried that the Bush administration deal
is merely a short-term solution and that Amtrak will be near closure
again late this year, unless the White House and Congress can agree
on more funding.</TE>
<TE>   Without a contingency plan, an Amtrak closure would shut down
Metrolink, since it would lose its key Amtrak employees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still tough to tell what is going to happen with Amtrak,"
said Metrolink Chief Executive David Solow. "Obviously, that's scary
for us. We're looking for a backstop to make sure we aren't affected
by what happens with them.... We need something solid to fill in if
Amtrak is suddenly not there."</TE>
<TE>   The Metrolink request was sent to two rail firms that run trains
on small slices of track in Southern California: Anacostia &amp; Pacific,
a Chicago-based company that operates out of the San Pedro area; and
RailAmerica, a Florida-based company that runs trains in San Diego
and Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Anacostia &amp; Pacific officials did not return phone messages on the
matter. RailAmerica officials declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   If the companies bid on the plan and one is picked by Metrolink,
the contract would hinge on what happens to Amtrak.</TE>
<TE>   If Amtrak closes down late this year, one of the rail concerns
could receive the $18-million annual contracts for the Amtrak
workers, who would be given the chance to keep their jobs and
continue to run Metrolink's trains while being paid by the freight
railway.</TE>
<TE>   Solow said the two firms were selected because they have
experience in the region and relationships with Union Pacific and
Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the rail companies that own chunks of
Metrolink's tracks. "Amtrak is going to run through July and summer,"
said Solow. "I'm far less confident about what is going to happen in
October."</TE>

<HD>Turnstiles Might Bring an End to Unusual Red Line Honor
System</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The quirky honor system on Los Angeles' subway might be nearing the
end of the line--not because of scofflaws, but to free up police to
thwart other crimes and terrorism, the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority says.</LD>
<LD>   Under a plan expected to be presented to the MTA's board on July
18, turnstiles would go up at Red Line stations from downtown L.A. to
North Hollywood, ending a 9-year-old system that trusted subway
riders to purchase tickets or risk being fined $250 by police.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that riders are dishonest, the MTA says. Passengers
boarded Red Line trains more than 37 million times in the last 12
months, and an estimated 95% of them paid their way. But rather than
pay Los Angeles police and county sheriff's deputies to check for
cheaters, the MTA wants to hire about 130 civilians to take over that
job and assist riders.</LD>
<TE>   Armed, uniformed officers would continue to roam stations along
MTA's subway and above-ground rail lines, but there would be fewer of
them.</TE>
<TE>   "You do not need a law enforcement officer to ask someone if you
paid your fare," MTA Deputy Chief Executive John Catoe told the Los
Angeles City Council on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Worried about the potential cutbacks of police, council members
unanimously passed a resolution to express their concern to the MTA's
board, which would have to approve any new security plan.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a uniformed officer, the presence alone is a
deterrent" to fare cheaters and other criminals, said Councilman Ed
Reyes. "Why we would take that away, I don't understand."</TE>
<TE>   The MTA says it is taking nothing away. Instead, Catoe said, it is
changing "the mix" of its $60-million security budget, freeing up
more police to fight crime in other areas of the city while
maintaining strong security on the subway.</TE>
<TE>   "The MTA provides transportation to almost 400 million customers a
year," Catoe said, "and, statistically, it is the safest place to be
in the county of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   When the Red Line's first stop opened in 1993, the route's novel
honor system attracted publicity and ridership.</TE>
<TE>   The honor system will remain on MTA's Blue Line, which runs from
downtown L.A. to Long Beach, and on the Green Line, which runs from
Norwalk to Redondo Beach. Likewise, the Gold Line from L.A. to
Pasadena is scheduled to open next July without turnstiles.</TE>

<LD>Ten passengers aboard a Metrolink train that was hit in April by a
Burlington Northern Santa Fe freight train have filed a lawsuit
against the rail operators, alleging negligence and willful disregard
for their safety.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, accuses
Burlington Northern and Metrolink of failing to install technology
that could have prevented the April 23 accident. Three people were
killed and more than 200 people were injured when a Burlington
freight train hit a Metrolink train filled with about 300 morning
commuters.</LD>

<LD>A San Juan Capistrano man was taken into federal custody Tuesday
pending sentencing after pleading guilty to running a scam involving
charitable collections.</LD>
<LD>   Mitchell David Gold, 44, was to have been sentenced, but the
hearing was delayed until July 23. Gold's company raised money for
charities but turned over only a fraction of the proceeds,
prosecutors said.</LD>

<HD>Intruder Was Unprepared for Hazards Tossed at Him in
Robbery Gone Awry</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe a home-improvement store isn't the best kind to attempt to rob.
A guy in a ski mask approached three people in a Norwalk store and
said, "Cash. I want all your cash." He began to swing a crowbar,
whereupon one of the would-be victims said, "Let's get this guy."</LD>
<LD>   The next thing the intruder knew, a hammer was flung at him, the
Long Beach Press-Telegram reported. Someone else threw a ladder. The
man in the ski mask slalomed out of the store as fast as he could.</LD>
<LD>   Stupid criminal tricks (cont.): A duo of burglars dressed as
custodians was looting a store in Palmdale when a shopkeeper next
door spotted them. He told them he'd keep quiet about it and went
inside his own store--where he promptly called the cops. The burglars
were arrested soon afterward, and no doubt left wondering whether
anyone can be trusted these days.</LD>
<TE>   Well, it seemed important at the time: Some 911 calls listed in
the Pasadena Star News:</TE>
<TE>   * "Male says Japanese bees won't let him take his meds
(medicines)."</TE>
<TE>   * "Husband locked in shower."</TE>
<TE>   * "Vicious peacock stuck in tree."</TE>
<TE>   * "Unknown person stole 10 gallons of water from [resident's]
pool."</TE>
<TE>   And, finally, the department received a call from an alarm company
rep who couldn't find the city of Puerto Vallarta.</TE>
<TE>   Told that it was in Mexico, the rep said this Puerto Vallarta was
in Southern California. Asked to spell it, the caller responded:
"P-i-c-o R-i-v-e-r-a."</TE>
<TE>   Guide to Adventurous Dining: July 4 is almost here, and you know
what that means--time to get the eats ready! Today's servings (see
accompanying):</TE>
<TE>   * An almost completely misspelled sandwich menu, including one
offering that would figure to have a cottony taste (Chuck Dapoz of
Manhattan Beach);</TE>
<TE>   * Some really aged frozen raspberries, advertised in Idaho, not
Russia (Leslie Siewierski of Westchester);</TE>
<TE>   * And, finally, a cut of meat where you wouldn't expect to find a
bone (Betty Borzage of Santa Ana).</TE>
<TE>   More food for thought: A while back, I showed you a photo of a
former Straw Hat pizzeria in Claremont whose new owner displayed a
sign that said Raw Hat. Well, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin columnist
David Allen, the watchdog of Claremont, writes that the Raw Hat folks
received a stern warning from the Straw Hat folks. Raw Hat
disappeared and was replaced by Stars Pizza, but it too went out of
business.</TE>
<TE>   Theorized Allen: "Maybe it was a lack of dough."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: I think most non-Valleyites in L.A. would agree with
me about secession. If the divorce does not go through, I'd be
willing to take the Valley back on one condition: No more whining!</TE>

<HD>Hillside Plan Sent to Voters</HD>
<DH>Growth: Ventura council members approve a ballot initiative
that would allow 1,390 homes to be built north of the city's
downtown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying they had no alternative, Ventura City Council members have
voted to place an initiative for hillside development on the Nov. 5
ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The Open 80 plan seeks to build up to 1,390 homes north of
Ventura's downtown while setting aside more than 3,000 acres of open
space. An ordinance adopted last year prohibits extending city
services onto the hillsides without voter approval.</LD>
<LD>   "Voters, go for it," Mayor Ray Di Guilio told the crowd after the
council vote.</LD>
<TE>   Though Di Guilio told Monday's audience that the council would
take no further action on the initiative, 25 residents still signed
up to speak. "After this evening, we're out of the loop," Di Guilio
said. "This is not the forum where the discussion will take place."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the initiative again criticized putting a development
agreement on the ballot without a completed environmental impact
report. Supporters called the proposed open space a great gift.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative came to the City Council after a successful
petition drive sponsored by the owners of the hillside land. Both
sides, and some members of the council, noted that the measure is
historic--it is the first time in California that a development
agreement has been placed on a ballot by citizens, they said.</TE>
<TE>   After listening to more than two hours of public comments, council
members peppered City Atty. Robert Boehm with questions about his
legal analysis of the initiative. Boehm told the council that he was
surprised by how much discretion the city would retain over the
proposed development, should the measure pass.</TE>
<TE>   The council can write arguments for or against the initiative, but
won't decide whether to do so until July 15.</TE>

<HD>Briquette, Wood Fires Banned in Los Padres</HD>
<DH>Safety: U.S. forestry officials take the action in light of
dry conditions. Campers are disappointed but understand the need.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reacting to one of the driest fire seasons in memory, the U.S. Forest
Service has banned all wood and charcoal briquette fires in Los
Padres National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   While forest officials don't anticipate a great outcry over the
ban, which began Tuesday and will last indefinitely, they acknowledge
it may disappoint some summer campers.</LD>
<LD>   Count Marlene Wait of Somis among the disappointed. She and her
husband, William, had been looking forward to cooking outdoor meals
in Los Padres with their Dutch oven. But since the oven requires
briquettes, it's now illegal to use the oven in the forest.</LD>
<TE>   "In one hour I could have made stew, enchiladas, apple crisp," she
said. "Now--thank goodness I brought pans."</TE>
<TE>   She now plans to use a cooking stove.</TE>
<TE>   She said the ban is probably practical, but dislikes the
inconvenience and bristles at the implicit suggestion that some
campers aren't responsible or cautious when dealing with cooking
fires or barbecues.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see the reason for [the ban]," she said. "But I don't have
to like it."</TE>
<TE>   The ban comes a little more than two weeks after crews
extinguished the Wolf fire, which burned nearly 23,000 acres in Los
Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have not determined the cause of the fire, which cost
more than $15 million to fight and clean up.</TE>
<TE>   A look at the forestry lands shows why officials are warning that
this is one of the most dangerous fire seasons in years.</TE>
<TE>   At the Wheeler Gorge campsite Tuesday, brittle leaves littered the
parched ground. A once-flowing creek trickled past and hillsides had
taken on fall hues of orange, red and brown.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't take much to set this place off," said William Wait,
surveying his surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   "In August or September, I don't know if I'd even come over here."</TE>
<TE>   The extremely dry conditions have also prompted forest officials
to limit cigarette smoking to inside vehicles and buildings,
developed campgrounds or sites with at least three feet of clearance.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, I think the public has been expecting us to make
this announcement," said Kathy Good, a Los Padres spokeswoman. "We
can't afford to let a fire get established."</TE>
<TE>   But campers still have alternatives to campfires, such as
picnicking or using portable stoves, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still lots of ways to have fun," Good said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the ban may spoil some of the ambience, hardy campers
will make do, said Alex Washington, a Chatsworth resident who makes
an annual Fourth of July trip to the Wheeler Gorge campgrounds with
his family.</TE>
<TE>   Family members said they understand the need for precautions. On
this trip, they were cooking with a propane stove and playing rummy
at night by flashlight and propane lamp.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything to keep the forest safe," Washington said.</TE>

<HD>Heartland Towns Dying but Spirit Lives On in the Heart of
O.C.</HD>

<LD>Over the years, haven't we waxed every last ounce of nostalgia out of
America's heartland?</LD>
<LD>   As a guy who spent his formative years in Nebraska off Highway 14
in Marquette (pop. 200), I can be a runaway freight train if left
unchecked on the subject.</LD>
<LD>   So, yes, we've probably overdone it, but for us children of the
Plains, it's a story that runs river-deep through our veins--and our
psyches.</LD>
<TE>   With more than casual interest, then, I, and no doubt thousands of
Southern Californians from the Midwest, read The Times story this
week about a congressional effort to bail out rural America.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to give tax breaks to homeowners or merchants who
settle in the shrinking towns that have helped flavor America since
the first colonists landed but which have been going the way of the
buffalo and the swimming hole.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal has the whiff of desperation.</TE>
<TE>   Even many of the Nebraska townspeople quoted in the story wondered
aloud if the horse wasn't already out of the barn.</TE>
<TE>   It was another sentiment in the story, however, that caught my
attention.</TE>
<TE>   A young farmer from Meadow Grove (pop. 311) said of the country
life:</TE>
<TE>   "We have something here that you don't have in Orange County,
Calif. When there's trouble, people help."</TE>
<TE>   The farmer has it only half-right, I think.</TE>
<TE>   The willingness to help your neighbor is, indeed, rooted in
Midwesterners.</TE>
<TE>   It probably dates to a time when, on occasion, everyone had to
bring in the sheaves--or the sheaves didn't get brought in.</TE>
<TE>   But it's part of Midwestern mythmaking to say that the same traits
don't exist in the population centers, especially on the coasts.</TE>
<TE>   And as long as the farmer mentioned Orange County ...</TE>
<TE>   I remember talking a few years ago to Russell Coble of Capistrano
Beach. Seeing one night that his neighbor's house was on fire, Coble
pulled a semi-conscious man from the living room.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing the man had a wife, probably in the bedroom where the fire
was centered, Coble made several attempts to re-enter the home,
finally succeeding through a back door and rescuing the woman.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was local attorney Bill Halle, who happened to be
sitting in court when an infirm and aging couple were trying to
represent themselves in a bankruptcy. Halle realized the couple were
over their heads and offered his card. In the ensuing months, he
spent dozens of hours advising the couple and drafting legal
documents--never charging a cent.</TE>
<TE>   Or the Laguna Beach effort of 26 organizations and churches that
helped about 370 families routed from their homes during the giant
fire that struck the town in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   All of those deeds were pretty Midwestern. We could probably fill
up a large section of the newspaper with others.</TE>
<TE>   After 15 years in Orange County, I can't say that Midwesterners
are kinder or more generous or more heroic than the Californians I
know.</TE>
<TE>   It's more a matter that the familiarity in rural America makes it
easier to help.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Jacobsen, a friend from those Marquette days who still lives
and farms in the area, says it stands to reason that people in large
population centers would be more cautious, if only because they
aren't as likely to know their neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   People around Marquette think nothing of driving 25 miles to shop
or as far as 60 miles to work in larger cities.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen says the essence of small-town life lingers but isn't
thriving.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of it still exists," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "The camaraderie that goes with a small town, knowing people,
waving to people on the road when you're driving. That's still
appealing, but people tend to be so busy now, just trying to survive,
that coffee shops don't even make it, because people don't have time
to stop in."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, we all feel it slipping away--those who once lived in
rural America and those who still do. I'm not sure the past can be
legislated back into existence.</TE>
<TE>   We may have to settle for memories that long outlive the coffee
shops.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Should Act Like the Leading Man He Is</HD>

<AU>Patt Morrison</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Look, I could have done this the same old way.</LD>
<LD>   I could have rung up all the talking heads in civic politics, and
said to each of them, "Hey, it's July--Jim Hahn has been mayor of
L.A. for one year. How's he doing so far?"</LD>
<LD>   And they would have ticked off a list of laudable deeds, the Boy
Scout merit badges Hahn has earned these twelve months past:</LD>
<TE>   He's whittled some of the deadwood out of the permit process,
promising a money-back speedy-service guarantee that even a
drive-through burger chain wouldn't dare to match.</TE>
<TE>   He's worked to kick neighborhood councils into gear.</TE>
<TE>   He's revved up a popular after-school program.</TE>
<TE>   He's handed over his juicy sinecure as head of the MTA board to
work at keeping the city from divorcing itself.</TE>
<TE>   And he's buying a fleet of "Pothole Killer" urgent-response trucks
that promise to be to gaping holes in the asphalt what 911 is
supposed to be to violent crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The talking heads would be right, for all these are true, all
worthy.</TE>
<TE>   But listing them no more describes Hahn's first year in office
than laying out a carefully detailed chain of precise biochemical
triggers and responses would describe falling in love.</TE>
<TE>   Something important is missing. Call it charisma, call it style,
that elusive chemical something that puts the capital-L into
"leader."</TE>
<TE>   Who knows this better than the experts?</TE>
<TE>   Not the talking heads. The other L.A. experts, the people who
match personalities to the roles they want to play.</TE>
<TE>   Casting directors.</TE>
<TE>   These days Bonnie Pietila is a producer of Fox's animated phenom
"The Simpsons," but before that, she was the casting director who put
together the ensemble of Simpsonian voices that has become the vox
pop of the world's televisions.</TE>
<TE>   So--how about that Jim Hahn? Would you cast him as mayor of L.A.?
Or even mayor of Springfield?</TE>
<TE>   "I would probably," she said diplomatically, "want someone who had
a known greater comedic flair. It'd be great if I could see where his
sense of humor lies.... I don't see where it comes out. I think he
needs to engage us on that level."</TE>
<TE>   Another casting director who's been matching actors to roles in
feature films and television for two decades doesn't want his name
used, which is just as well, because he'd never give Hahn a job, or,
after this, vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   If Hahn showed up at a casting call, here's what this man would
write down:</TE>
<TE>   "A real good actor at least sinks his teeth into a character. Hahn
hasn't sunk his teeth into any issue ... to me he compromises way too
much, which as an actor you never do.... As an actor he'd last about
three seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "And if you were going to look at him from the standpoint of a
character actor, at least a character actor is watchable, at least a
character actor is interesting. To me, the mayor is vapid.... He's
not watchable, he's not charismatic.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see a shallow actor when they walk into your office,
someone who hasn't made strong choices, hasn't committed to a
character. Every time I see Jim Hahn that's what I think. To me he's
a background player who got lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Thank you, Mayor Hahn. We'll be in touch.</TE>
<TE>   Do we really need that? Do we need a mayor who can also play one
on television?</TE>
<TE>   Damned right we do. This is a city built out of imagination, a
world city sprouted on a landscape that burns and floods and shakes,
a flea-bitten flyspeck of an outpost that became the world capital of
imagination.</TE>
<TE>   It's the coin of our realm, and if Hahn wants Los Angeles'
attention, he needs to catch its imagination in order to win it over.
So far, as the unnamed casting director said, "He's never gotten the
audience on his side, and as a performer, that's what he's got to
do."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn probably hates this part of being mayor. Maybe it seems phony
to him. But if he's wanted this role all his life, surely he realized
what it takes to do it.</TE>
<TE>   His father, the late Kenny, county supervisor and before that city
councilman, had a genius for this sort of thing. Once he fielded a
phone call from a woman whose trash had not been picked up. Hahn pere
drove to her house, picked up the trash and took it to the dump. Not
only did Kenny pick up the trash, he made sure people knew he did it.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't enough that Hahn loves L.A., though he does. He has to
make all the rest of us love it, too.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't enough for Hahn to be the First Bureaucrat, boasting
after his first 100 days of landfill reforms and shortening a
neighborhood council application form from 21 pages to six. He has to
make us excited about landfills, to make us want to fill out that
form for a neighborhood council.</TE>
<TE>   There is no one mayoral model, not in New York, where Fiorello
LaGuardia read the comics to the kiddies over the radio, and Rudy
Giuliani reinvented himself sometime after breakfast on Sept. 11, and
not here. Mayor Sam Yorty's buffoonery belied the hardest of hardball
political players. Tom Bradley, the Sphinx of Spring Street, conveyed
a reassuringly Zen-like civic serenity. Mayor Richard Riordan could
be, in Bonnie Pietila's phrase, "inadvertently funny," and it got
people to listen to him.</TE>
<TE>   It's Sunday morning on the city's calendar. The sermon topics are
secession, and security, and the meaning of a great city.</TE>
<TE>   The bully pulpit, like the city car, comes with the job. If Hahn
doesn't step into the pulpit and preach like he really means it,
someone else will.</TE>

<KH>THE SECESSION QUESTION</KH>
<HD>East Doesn't Meet West on Valley Split</HD>
<DH>Secession: Attitudes follow geographic lines. Approval runs
deepest among area's old guard.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Across the San Fernando Valley, the yearning to secede from Los
Angeles trumps the desire to stay together among most groups of
voters--men and women, old and young, Latino and white, the
college-educated and high school dropouts, according to the Los
Angeles Times Poll.</LD>
<LD>   But the depth of support for secession fluctuates widely. One of
the most striking gaps emerged along geographic lines within the
Valley, the poll found.</LD>
<LD>   In the West Valley--whose population is wealthier, more
conservative, less transient and contains a higher proportion of
whites--59% favor secession and 32% oppose it. Only 45% of East
Valley residents support a split, while 42% disapprove.</LD>
<TE>   The difference can be partly attributed to the West Valley's
stable base of longtime residents. Most voters who have lived in the
Valley for a decade or longer favor secession, perhaps reflecting a
long-simmering unhappiness with City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Voters who have moved to the Valley from somewhere else in the
city view secession less favorably. Newer residents are split on the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, 52% of Valley registered voters favor a separate city and
37% oppose it, the poll found. In Los Angeles as a whole, only 38%
support the split while 47% do not. To win, the secession measure on
the Nov. 5 ballot must attract a majority both in the Valley and
citywide.</TE>
<TE>   The urge to secede runs deepest among what could be called the
Valley's old guard: Republicans, self-identified conservatives and
moderates, wealthier residents and those living in the West Valley,
where the secession movement began in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   More than a third of the West Valley's registered voters are
lifelong Valley residents, according to the poll. Only 13% have lived
there less than a decade. But on the other side of the San Diego
Freeway, 27% have spent their lives there and almost as many are
newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   Irvin Park, a poll respondent from Northridge, is one of the West
Valley's old-timers. He moved to the Valley half a century ago, a
young World War II veteran. Now 76 and retired, he vigorously
supports secession because "I'm just not happy with what I'm seeing."</TE>
<TE>   Park, a white conservative Republican, says he is particularly
upset about rising crime and illegal immigration.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to move someplace where there's a little, small town,
probably Oregon or Washington or someplace like that," he mused. "I
think the Valley is overgrown."</TE>
<TE>   The West Valley's enthusiasm for secession--people there favor an
independent Hollywood more than Hollywood residents do--comes as no
surprise to Jaime Regalado, executive director of the Pat Brown
Institute for Public Affairs at Cal State Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a more conservative area, populated by people who feel
especially distant from City Hall and the downtown powers that be,"
he said. "Part of it is NIMBYism, part of it is wanting to turn back
the clock, part of it is wanting to avoid what they feel Los Angeles
is becoming. They're trying to retain a lifestyle they feel is
eroding."</TE>
<TE>   Liberals Disapprove</TE>
<TE>   Support for splitting off from Los Angeles is much softer among
Valley Democrats and people living in the less-affluent neighborhoods
east of the San Diego Freeway. Opposition to secession outweighs
approval among liberals and households earning less than $40,000 a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Shaking the notion that a breakaway appeals chiefly to whites, the
poll found that support is nearly even among white and Latino voters
in the Valley. A majority of both groups say the region would be
better off as an independent city.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Plascencia, a Latino Democrat who lives in Canoga Park, said
a Valley city would pay more attention to its poor neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "The more Latin areas, with more minorities, are pretty primitive
compared to Encino and Woodland Hills," said Plascencia, a
32-year-old music producer. "I was raised in Sylmar and Pacoima, and
there are still roads there that are dirt. The same cracks in the
same streets have been there for years. If the Valley controlled its
own money, maybe we could tend to the roads and graffiti and all the
neighborhoods a little better."</TE>
<TE>   The roots of the secession movement stretch back more than 40
years, to a time when the 222-square-mile Valley was largely white,
still dotted with citrus groves, and much more conservative.</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, a coalition of West Valley civic and business
leaders--fed up with perceived mistreatment by City Hall--began
exploring the idea of forming their own city.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Tucker, a white Republican who has called the Valley home
for 43 years, said she has watched her Van Nuys neighborhood turn
from a safe and friendly "paradise" to a dirty, crime-ridden area.</TE>
<TE>   "Gangs are getting out of hand," said Tucker, who favors
secession. "Graffiti is everywhere. When I moved here, there was no
graffiti. People took care of their yards. It was just a more
friendly neighborhood ....We're so multicultural now, you know. There
are language barriers. So many new people are coming in now that a
lot of them hesitate to get friendly."</TE>
<TE>   More than four in 10 Valley voters say their area does not receive
its fair share of city services. Among that group, two-thirds support
secession.</TE>
<TE>   Some See Ample Service</TE>
<TE>   Such reasoning, however, fails to resonate with more than a third
of Valley voters. For Leonette Johnson, a poll respondent who grew up
in South-Central Los Angeles and moved to North Hollywood two years
ago, the Valley is a well-tended area with impressive services.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand why these people are complaining," said
Johnson, 43, an African American telephone banker who opposes
secession. "If anyone's complaining, it should be South-Central,
because they're not getting their services over there."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said she suspects that the desire to break away sprang
from whites who grew uncomfortable with minorities and poor people
moving to the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "There are low-income neighborhoods that are struggling, and some
of them are struggling too close to the white culture," she said.
"And the white culture likes to move on when that happens, rather
than staying to help improve the situation."</TE>
<TE>   William Cartwright, a television editor from Encino, also
distrusts what he calls "the anti-progressive forces behind
secession" who also supported the Proposition 13 tax revolt and
opposed busing to desegregate schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like a citizen of the city at large," said Cartwright, a
44-year-old Democrat who is white. "Splitting off the Valley into
some parochial little subdivision of its own doesn't appeal to me."</TE>
<TE>   The poll was conducted by telephone from June 20 to 28. The survey
included 576 Valley voters with a sampling error of 4 percentage
points in either direction.</TE>

<TE>How the Poll Was Conducted</TE>
<TE>The Times Poll contacted 1,291 registered voters in the city of Los
Angeles, including a supplemental sample of Valley voters, by
telephone June 20-28. The poll interviewed 576 Valley voters. The
Valley sample was then weighted to its proportionate share in the
city. Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in
the city of Los Angeles. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so
that listed and unlisted numbers could be contacted. The entire
sample was weighted slightly to conform with census figures for sex,
race, age, education, registration and area of city. The margin of
sampling error for the entire city is plus or minus 3 percentage
points; for the Valley it is 4 points. For certain subgroups the
error margin may be somewhat higher. Poll results can also be
affected by other factors such as question wording and the order in
which questions are presented. Interviews were conducted in English
and Spanish.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Checks Ties to Man Held in Agent's Death</HD>
<DH>Crime: Drifter accused in slaying of ex-INS officer in
Santa Ana area may have robbed gay men in beach city. Police ask for
public's help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laguna Beach police began checking Tuesday on whether a drifter
accused of torturing and killing a retired immigration agent in his
Santa Ana-area apartment also robbed gay men in the Laguna Beach
area.</LD>
<LD>   The attempt to link Gregory Michael Pisarcik to crimes in Laguna
Beach and other south Orange County beach cities came after his
arrest in the death of Narciso P. Leggs Jr., a former immigration
agent whose bound and partially dismembered body was found Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Jim Amormino, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's
Department, which has primary jurisdiction, would not elaborate on
why detectives suspect Pisarcik was targeting gay men.</LD>
<TE>   Sgt. Jason C. Kravetz said the Laguna Beach Police Department was
trying to determine whether any of its cases might be connected to
Pisarcik, and also was asking anyone who might have had contact with
him to come forward.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely something we should look into," Kravetz said.
"Right now we don't know of any robberies we can attribute to this
guy.... There's a chance a victim may come forward who previously
didn't report anything."</TE>
<TE>   Pisarcik, 25, was being held without bail Tuesday and was
scheduled to be arraigned today on murder and robbery charges in the
death of Leggs, who worked as a supervisory detention and deportation
officer before retiring from the INS in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The two men apparently met in recent weeks in downtown Laguna
Beach. Leggs, 53, owned a limousine firm that once provided service
there.</TE>
<TE>   Pisarcik, a transient who grew up in New Jersey and has stayed on
and off with friends and relatives in Ojai and Orange, has no record
in Laguna Beach but a history of theft and narcotics arrests and
convictions elsewhere, according to records.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks before Leggs' murder, Pisarcik is believed to have
been involved in two crimes, Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa police
said. In the first case, a man believed to be Pisarcik jumped over
the counter of a Costa Mesa doughnut shop June 9, grabbed an
employee's car keys from the stock room area, then stole his Lexus.</TE>
<TE>   The car was located June 25, with two juveniles at the wheel and
Pisarcik's wallet inside. The night before the car was found,
Pisarcik and two friends allegedly left without paying a bill at
Denny's restaurant, 10136 Adams Ave., Huntington Beach. When a waiter
caught up to the group, he was struck in the face.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Pisarcik is a suspect in those cases but has not been
charged.</TE>
<TE>   Leggs is believed to have been killed a few days later inside his
garage apartment on Irvine Boulevard in an unincorporated area near
Santa Ana. His body was found by sheriff's deputies Saturday after
Leggs' landlord called police because he hadn't seen his tenant for
two days.</TE>
<TE>   Leggs was bound, gagged and tortured, police said. He died from a
blow to the head, officers said.</TE>
<TE>   His apartment was ransacked and some of his property stolen,
including a 1994 Lincoln Town Car.</TE>
<TE>   A key break in the case came Sunday, when an unidentified girl
noticed someone switching license plates on a 1991 white Lincoln in a
shopping center parking lot in Ventura County, Amormino said. She
told the owner of the Lincoln, who alerted police.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, a Ventura County deputy spotted the car and began a
pursuit that ended two hours later in Ventura.</TE>

<LD>The major league baseball youth academy originally planned for the
Hansen Dam area may instead be built at an Arleta landfill, Los
Angeles city officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The original location for the $10-million project was changed this
spring amid concerns about children's exposure to power lines.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, City Council President Alex Padilla introduced a
motion to begin studying the feasibility of a 41-acre site at Shelton
Arleta Landfill, which the city closed in 1974, said Padilla's
spokesman David Gershwin.</LD>

<HD>Ex-Judge Accused of Unethical Conduct</HD>
<DH>Law: State commission alleges James R. Simpson improperly
recalled a bench warrant for his campaign manager and tried to get
favorable treatment for his friends.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A retired Glendale judge improperly recalled an arrest warrant for
his former campaign manager and attempted to secure favorable
treatment for friends with traffic tickets while he was on the bench,
a state commission said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   James R. Simpson, 66, who was granted disability retirement from
Los Angeles County Superior Court in December, acted unethically when
he recalled a bench warrant for his former campaign manager, Allen E.
Brandstater, in September 1995, according to the state Commission on
Judicial Performance.</LD>
<LD>   Commission documents indicate that the Brandstater case, which was
assigned to another judge, involved a 1993 citation that Brandstater
received for an improper vehicle registration tag.</LD>
<TE>   In another case, Simpson allegedly gave Brandstater, who pleaded
no contest to a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence of
alcohol, additional time in May 1998 to complete the court-ordered
DUI first-offender treatment program and file proof that he attended
50 extra Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. The case was assigned to
another judge after Simpson recused himself.</TE>
<TE>   The commission accused Simpson of improperly seeking favorable
treatment for friends from court commissioners and a Glendale police
officer.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson allegedly asked former Glendale Municipal Court
Commissioner Dona Bracke on four occasions what could be done about
traffic tickets issued to his friends.</TE>
<TE>   He also allegedly asked Commissioner Steven K. Lubell about a $135
citation for driving an unregistered vehicle issued to Mark
Enzenauer, a videographer and business associate of Brandstater.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria B. Henley, the commission's director-chief counsel, said
Tuesday she cannot discuss pending cases.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson's attorney, Edward P. George Jr., was out of town and
unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson has denied allegations that he tried to influence the
handling of cases by court commissioners. The penalties he faces
include censure and being barred from handling cases as a temporary
judge.</TE>
<TE>   A 1964 graduate of USC Law School, Simpson served as a deputy
district attorney until being elected a Glendale Municipal Court
judge in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   He became a Superior Court judge in January 2000 when the courts
were unified.</TE>

<HD>Virk Seemed Distraught, Jurors Told</HD>
<DH>Courts: Testimony continues in the trial of a Port Hueneme
woman accused of trying to drown her two children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Port Hueneme mother accused of trying to drown her two children
appeared sad and distraught as she struggled to cope with a rocky
marriage punctuated by frequent screaming matches with her husband,
neighbors testified Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   One neighbor told jurors that in the months before the alleged
drowning attempt, defendant Narinder Virk walked "like a shadow" with
her narrow shoulders hunched over and her eyes downcast.</LD>
<LD>   "She looked like a bird that was hit by a storm," said Sylvia
Guapo, who lived in the same apartment complex.</LD>
<TE>   Guapo told jurors she once called police to report a volatile
fight between Virk and her former spouse, but acknowledged that she
never saw him hit her.</TE>
<TE>   Virk, 42, faces two counts of attempted murder for allegedly
trying to drown her son and daughter, then ages 9 and 6, in Channel
Islands Harbor on Jan. 12, 2000. She has pleaded not guilty by reason
of insanity.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Cynthia Ellington says Virk was "brutalized" by her
former spouse and suffered a mental breakdown on the night of the
incident. But prosecutor Richard Simon told jurors that Virk
deliberately tried to kill her children to seek revenge on her
ex-husband.</TE>
<TE>   Virk's trial continued Tuesday in Ventura County Superior Court
with testimony from neighbors and a schoolteacher. They all described
Virk, an Indian immigrant who speaks little English and can neither
read nor write, as a devoted mother who cared for her children
despite poverty and marital problems.</TE>
<TE>   "She was very protective of them," said kindergarten teacher
Therese Leclerc, who taught Virk's daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Leclerc testified that Virk walked her son, Sonny, and her
daughter, Harpreet, to Christa McAuliffe School in Oxnard every day.</TE>
<TE>   She told jurors she never saw the children's father at school,
contradicting his testimony from last week.</TE>
<TE>   Leclerc also testified that Virk was so thin during the 1998-99
school year that it appeared she was "starving."</TE>
<TE>   According to previous court testimony, Virk's ex-husband, liquor
store owner Santokh Virk, traveled to India for six months in the
fall of 1998 and told an employee that his family could get groceries
from the Port Hueneme store.</TE>
<TE>   Ellington contends Santokh Virk deserted the family with no food
or money, and later isolated his wife from her relatives in India.</TE>
<TE>   Guapo testified that she used to see Narinder Virk and her
children rifling through trash bins behind the apartment complex,
looking for recyclable cans to get money.</TE>
<TE>   "They looked like alley cats," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Lori Waldhauser testified that she once gave Narinder
Virk groceries.</TE>
<TE>   She also let Virk use her phone to call relatives in India because
the defendant's husband would not allow her to use the phone, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Waldhauser told jurors she never observed signs of physical abuse,
but she could hear the couple arguing frequently.</TE>
<TE>   During Tuesday's testimony, prosecutor Simon tried to show that
the defense witnesses were biased in favor of Virk.</TE>
<TE>   And he questioned what they really knew about the facts of the
case.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Guapo became angry with his questions and began to
argue with Simon, prompting Judge Ken Riley to instruct her to limit
her own remarks and answer the lawyer's questions.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony is scheduled to resume today.</TE>

<HD>Santa Paula Development Tied Up by Council</HD>
<DH>Vote: City leaders may have overstepped their authority in
denying a spot on the November ballot for a proposed 2,250-home
project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two proposed housing projects. Three ballot measures. And a split
City Council.</LD>
<LD>   Sound confusing? Welcome to Santa Paula City Hall.</LD>
<LD>   The city's elected leaders took up two major land-use measures
Tuesday night and came out with two tie votes, one of which elections
officials say was improper under state law.</LD>
<TE>   At issue is a proposed 2,250-home development in Adams Canyon on
the outskirts of town. Arizona-based Pinnacle Development Group filed
a petition to place the project on the November ballot for a public
vote, as required by Santa Paula's slow-growth ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council accepted the petition--which was certified by
City Clerk Steven Salas--on a 2-1 vote, with Councilwoman Laura
Flores Espinosa dissenting. Councilman John Procter abstained from
the vote and Mayor Don Johnson excused himself, citing conflict of
interest concerns.</TE>
<TE>   But when it came time to vote on placing the measure on the
ballot, the council voted 2-2. Councilmen Ray Luna and Richard Cook
voted yes, Espinosa and Procter voted no. The measure failed.</TE>
<TE>   Once a petition is deemed complete, state elections law leaves
elected leaders no discretion, said Ventura County Assistant
Registrar of Voters Bruce Bradley. He said they must either place the
matter on the ballot or approve the proposal as submitted.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula's city attorney told the council the same thing
repeatedly Tuesday night, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Boyd, general manager for the project, called Ranch at Santa
Paula, said he was baffled, but not surprised, by the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the housing project want to give the council the
chance to correct the mistake, he said. But they are also running up
against a July 19 county deadline to place questions on the ballot,
and, if needed, will go to court to ask a judge to order the
initiative on the ballot, Boyd said.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, what they've done here is not legal and doesn't make any
practical sense," he said. "We don't want to impose any damage or
costs on the city if possible, but at the same time we need to get
them to do what they're supposed to do."</TE>
<TE>   But Espinosa said she has no intention of changing her vote.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all about a big, greedy developer trying to ramrod this
through and destroy a community," she said. "If they are unhappy with
the council's decision, then the next forum is the courts."</TE>
<TE>   She also firmly believes that the council did have the discretion
to deny putting the qualified initiative on the ballot, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why it's an agendized item--you either vote yes or no,"
Espinosa said. "You can't fault me for voting my conscience."</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa and Procter both said Pinnacle's petition was flawed. The
councilwoman added that she does not trust the opinion of county
elections officials, whom she blamed for technicalities that derailed
two other measures.</TE>
<TE>   One of those involved a petition to place a question on the ballot
aimed at stopping the Pinnacle project. The other was a proposal to
build an 80-home development on a 32-acre parcel at Peck and Foothill
roads as an alternative to the bigger project.</TE>
<TE>   The proponent of that plan, local developer Scott Anderson, asked
the council Tuesday night to place the measure on the November
ballot. That also failed on a 2-2 tie, with Espinosa and Procter
voting yes and Luna and Cook voting no.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said he's sure Pinnacle will win in court.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed they wouldn't put us on the ballot as well and
let the will of the people decide," he said. "Instead it seems like
the City Council is deciding what should be there and what
shouldn't."</TE>

<HD>Mt. Wilson Observatory Turf War Ends</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Private institute sought the land, calling U.S.
maintenance poor. Work is performed after lawmaker proposes a
110-acre giveaway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The land around Mt. Wilson Observatory will stay in U.S. Forest
Service hands, at least for now.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. John E. Peterson (R-Pa.) introduced legislation last month
that would give away prime acreage within the Angeles National Forest
to the nonprofit Mt. Wilson Institute, which runs the observatory. On
Monday, institute representatives met at the observatory with
officials from the U.S. Forest Service, Rep. Adam B. Schiff
(D-Burbank) and staff for other members of Congress to try to resolve
some of the problems that led to the legislation.</LD>
<LD>   At issue were 110 acres of land beneath and around the
observatory. Institute officials complained that the Forest Service
had failed to perform routine and long-term maintenance on the
property, and that they were unable to make repairs because the
observatory is on public land. The institute said that if it had
control of the property, it could maintain the site using grant
money.</LD>
<TE>   In the last two weeks, the Forest Service has cleared brush,
downed dying Ponderosa pine trees, repaired bathrooms and replaced a
faulty electrical relay on the 300,000-gallon water tank that
provides water to the entire mountaintop.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a flurry of activity up there," said Craig Jensen, who
is a member of the institute board.</TE>
<TE>   At the meeting this week, institute representatives and Forest
Service officials agreed to spend the next six months improving the
site and their own working relationship. And because of that
arrangement, a spokesman for Peterson said, the legislation would
most likely be unnecessary. "Our goal was to resolve the serious
risks," said Paul Feenstra. "As long as these problems are resolved,
there is no reason to proceed with the legislative remedy."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Blackwell, regional forester for the Pacific Southwest region
of the Forest Service, who attended the hilltop meeting, said he was
pleased with how the issue had been resolved. "Clearly, there were
relationship and communication problems," he said. "We had
legislation introduced as a result of that ... and I went down in
person to try to deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   But some critics of the deal wondered how such problems could have
gone so far as to require a legislative response to what seemed to be
only maintenance issues.</TE>
<TE>   It is rare for an out-of-state congressman to introduce
legislation to give away federal land in someone else's district, but
Peterson is the vice chairman of a subcommittee on forest resources.
His chief of staff, Robert Ferguson, was a trustee of the institute
from April to June of this year. Leaders of the institute share
Peterson's skeptical view of global warming, questioning whether
humans have contributed to the phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Corcoran, regional representative for Sierra Club, said he
thought that the scope of the bill seemed out of proportion to the
problem expressed by the institute. "I felt like this bill was using
a gun to kill a gnat," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's another bad deal exposed, and stopped," said Janine
Blaeloch, director of the Western Land Exchange Project, a public
interest organization that monitors federal land exchanges and sales.
"It's especially good because very rarely is the public even aware
that their public lands are being used as trading currency--or being
given away, for that matter."</TE>
<TE>   Schiff offered to host another meeting of all concerned parties at
the end of the year. "It seemed to me that the items that needed work
were not so insurmountable that better communication could have
resolved it," he said. "But the introduction of the bill had
catalytic effect on the parties.... I think the Forest Service's
continued ownership of the property, and higher attention to it, are
in best interest of the public."</TE>

<HD>Arizona Fire Battle Is Winding Down</HD>
<DH>Disaster: The blaze that consumed 467,580 acres is 70%
contained, and crews start pulling out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CIBECUE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Crews fighting the largest wildfire in Arizona history shifted their
focus from the evacuated community of Forest Lakes to the southern
end of the blaze, and fire bosses say the end of the battle may be in
sight.</LD>
<LD>   The 467,580-acre blaze about 100 miles northeast of Phoenix has
consumed at least 423 homes since it started June 18, but was about
70% contained Tuesday. The fire is expected to be fully contained by
Sunday, and some crews are already being pulled off the lines to be
sent to other fires.</LD>
<LD>   About 25,000 evacuees have been allowed to return home, many of
them in Show Low, the economic hub of the area.</LD>
<TE>   But 3,500 to 4,000 others remain evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said it would be at least a few more days before the
remaining evacuees are allowed to go back.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters watched for flare-ups near the fire perimeter, at one
point snuffing a 10-acre blaze northwest of Cibecue believed to have
started by a flying ember.</TE>
<TE>   With fire line built around most of the huge fire, prospects for
containing the blaze were good, said Kris Eriksen, a fire information
officer. The main fire had threatened the community of Forest Lakes
over the weekend, but firefighters were able to keep it out of the
community.</TE>
<TE>   Crews didn't work the fire near Forest Lakes Monday night, said
fire information officer Bruce Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   The number of people working the blaze dropped from 4,000 over the
weekend to 3,400 Monday night.</TE>

<HD>Planned Parenthood, Others Told to Turn Over Records to Aid
Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DES MOINES</DL>
<LD>A judge has ordered Planned Parenthood and five hospitals to turn
over hundreds of pregnancy tests to help police find the mother of a
newborn whose body was dumped, then shredded at a recycling center.</LD>
<LD>   Buena Vista County Atty. Phil Havens has argued the tests are not
medical records because they can be administered by laypeople.</LD>
<LD>   But the American Civil Liberties Union called last week's District
Court ruling an "extreme invasion of privacy." Planned Parenthood
officials appealed Monday to the Iowa Supreme Court, saying their
files are protected by federal law.</LD>
<TE>   "Basically what these guys are asking for is to walk into our
clinic and have carte blanche access to our records. That's so
appalling to me," said Sandra Suarez, an attorney for Planned
Parenthood.</TE>
<TE>   District Judge Frank Nelson subpoenaed pregnancy test records
conducted by the hospitals and Planned Parenthood from August 2001 to
May.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's body was found at the recycling center May 30.
Investigators have interviewed new mothers, doctors, school officials
and human service workers but say they have no suspects and few
clues.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Chuck Eddy declined to comment Tuesday, referring
questions to Havens, who did not return a phone call to his office.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just about pregnancy services but also about the privacy
rights that all of us have in our medical records," said Randall
Wilson, legal director of the Iowa Civil Liberties Union. "If the
people who are using those clinics believe they are getting medical
care, then they have a reasonable expectation of privacy."</TE>
<TE>   Planned Parenthood officials estimated they gave out nearly 1,000
pregnancy tests from August to May. But pregnancy tests are also
widely available at drugstores and, so far, there is no indication
the baby's mother visited either the clinic or any of the five
hospitals.</TE>

<LD>   Authorities in North Carolina have seized $1.4 million worth of
narcotics and have convicted more than 80 Marines and sailors for
using or distributing designer drugs, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   It was one of the biggest drug investigations involving the
military in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said that a two-year investigation, code-named Operation
Xterminator, was conducted by the Naval Criminal Investigative
Service office at Camp Lejeune, N.C., with state and local
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation began in February 2000 after Camp Lejeune
officials were alerted that a large number of service members were
frequenting clubs in Wilmington where designer drugs were prevalent,
according to a statement released by the Camp Lejeune public affairs
office. The drugs involved were ecstasy, cocaine, LSD and
methamphetamine, Marine Corps officials said.</TE>

<LD>AND FINALLY ...</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   A judge ordered Ohio's largest egg farm to begin shutting down its
operations in two counties because of an ongoing fly outbreak.</LD>
<TE>   It is the harshest decision to be taken against Buckeye Egg Farm
of Newark, which has repeatedly been accused of infestations of
flies, beetles and other insects, and of polluting creeks. A judge
previously had ordered the farm to pay $1.2 million in fines for
violations.</TE>
<TE>   "Shutting down barns seems to be only way to take care of the fly
nuisance," state Atty. Gen. Betty Montgomery said. Matt Doyle, the
company's chief financial officer, said he would not comment until he
read the judge's order.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Gregory Frost of Licking County Common Pleas Court ordered
Buckeye to begin shutting down a barn every two weeks at its
operations beginning Aug. 19.</TE>
<TE>   Buckeye has 15.5 million hens and the company produced 2.6 billion
eggs last year, or 4% of the nation's supply.</TE>

<HD>President Revisits Issues, and States, to Push Goals</HD>
<DH>Politics: Bush's focus is redirected to domestic policies
that dominated his 2000 campaign, such as school vouchers and welfare
reform.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>MILWAUKEE -- Using issues that worked for him two years ago,
President Bush is revisiting some of the most important states on the
political map, putting pressure on a Congress that has moved slowly
on his limited domestic agenda.</LD>
<LD>   During the first six months of the year, the peripatetic president
has visited 33 of the 50 states. But it is the states to which he has
returned again and again that draw attention, and the topics on which
he is focusing set out a road map for his own political course.</LD>
<LD>   He was in Ohio on Monday--visit No. 4 in 2002. On Tuesday, he
spent two hours in Wisconsin--his third time in the state this year.
And on Thursday, he is planning to attend an Independence Day parade
in a small town in West Virginia--visit No. 3 there.</LD>
<TE>   He is talking about school vouchers, about his faith-based
initiative, about overhauling the welfare system and about
patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   The issues formed the foundation of his 2000 presidential
campaign, and they work comfortably for him in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in the case of his proposal that the federal government
relax regulations so religious-based organizations can run some
social welfare programs traditionally run by government agencies,
Bush has a handy target in Congress' skittishness.</TE>
<TE>   The welfare program Bush wants to expand is built on proposals
advanced by Republicans in the mid-1990s and endorsed by the Clinton
administration. On Tuesday, he found a nexus of the two issues at
Milwaukee's Holy Redeemer Institutional Church of God in Christ.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in a meeting hall of a church where welfare recipients
receive job training, Bush said that, in rewriting welfare laws,
Congress must not undo the toughened welfare requirements the House
and the Senate imposed six years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "One way to make sure that we continue to make progress is insist
upon work, and then help people who need help to find a job," the
president said. Religious groups can do that, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Government can hand out money.... But what government cannot do
is put hope in people's hearts or a sense of purpose in their lives,"
he said. "When we find programs that work, when we find a place that
is actually effective at helping people, this government will welcome
such programs."</TE>
<TE>   Critics have argued that allowing churches and other religious
groups to receive government money for job training, for example, may
violate the constitutional doctrine of separation of church and
state.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bush said, "our government should not fear faith in our
society." He singled out the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty
in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't ask, 'What is your religion?' They ask, 'Are you
hungry?' But because of their name and their identity, federal
officials have repeatedly discouraged them from applying for federal
funds," he said. "That's not right. The federal government should not
ask, 'Does your organization believe in God?' ... They ought to ask,
'Does your program work?' "</TE>
<TE>   The House has moved ahead of the Senate on the faith-based
legislation and the welfare measure, approving its own versions while
Senate committees work on the two pieces of legislation.</TE>
<TE>   For his travels this week, Bush has chosen states that have
generally played important roles in picking presidents in modern
campaign history.</TE>
<TE>   Bush took Ohio by a 3.5 percentage point margin over former Vice
President Al Gore, the Democrats' candidate in 2000. He lost
Wisconsin by a margin of 0.02 points, and he won West Virginia by 6.3
percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   The issues on which Bush is focusing do not demand congressional
action or even the prospects of congressional action to carry
political weight. They have a particular appeal to the conservative
base that Bush courts.</TE>
<TE>   "If none of this stuff gets enacted, it has a long shelf life,"
said Ross K. Baker, a Rutgers University political scientist, feeding
a president's opportunities to accuse Congress--as Harry S. Truman
did effectively in 1948 and nearly every president has done since
then--of being a "do-nothing" legislative body.</TE>
<TE>   The effort to win congressional approval for each of the social
policy issues has faced obstacles since Bush took office nearly 18
months ago.</TE>
<TE>   As Congress worked on his education proposals, Bush quickly
accepted compromises that abandoned the voucher program, which would
allow parents to send children to parochial or other private schools
with tuition help from taxpayers. Vouchers were not part of the
education legislation he signed in January, and until Monday in
Cleveland--after the Supreme Court decision supporting their use--he
had drawn little attention to what had been a central piece of the
education overhaul on which he had campaigned.</TE>
<TE>   He quickly won approval last year of a $1.35-trillion, 10-year tax
cut; now he is campaigning on occasion to make it permanent. And the
faith-based initiative faces difficult obstacles in the Senate.</TE>

<HD>First Woman Likely to Be Named to Head CDC</HD>
<DH>Health: Dr. Julie Gerberding, an infectious-disease
specialist, rose to national prominence during the federal agency's
response to the anthrax attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An infectious-disease specialist who played a leading role in the
anthrax investigation is expected to be named today to head the
Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according
to Bush administration officials.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Julie Gerberding will become the first woman to lead the
nation's premier public health agency. Health and Human Services
Secretary Tommy G. Thompson is scheduled to announce his
choice--which does not require Senate confirmation--at the CDC
headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   Gerberding will take over an agency with more than 8,500 employees
nationwide and a $6.8-billion budget. The agency has struggled with
morale in the wake of criticism about its anthrax response, and
Gerberding recently called the transition "tough."</LD>
<TE>   Although the CDC has many responsibilities related to homeland
security, it is to remain in the Health and Human Services Department
under President Bush's proposal for a Department of Homeland
Security. It has received a burst of new funds to counter the threat
of bioterrorism, which hit home during the anthrax attack.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Gerberding arrives as the director of the CDC at a time of
great opportunity and substantial challenge ... , " said Bill Roper,
dean of the University of North Carolina School of Public Health and
CDC director under the first President Bush. "The anthrax attacks
brought very heightened visibility and new responsibility and
resources. The next director must make the most of those things."</TE>
<TE>   Several top public health authorities described Gerberding's
background as uniquely suited to the new demands on a CDC director.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at threats of [the] 21st century, they are by far the
threats we face from new and emerging infectious diseases, antibiotic
resistance and bioterrorism, all areas Julie understands well," said
Dr. Gail Cassell of Eli Lilly and Co., who serves as bioterrorism
advisor to the government and pushed for Gerberding's appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Gerberding, 46, came to the CDC in 1998 after nearly two decades
at UC San Francisco, where she established herself as a leading
expert in the treatment of AIDS and in medical workers exposed to
HIV-positive blood. She earned a bachelor of arts degree in chemistry
from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, graduating with
honors before going on to attend the university's medical school.</TE>
<TE>   She did her internship and residency at UC San Francisco in the
early 1980s and later earned a master's degree in public health from
the school. Gerberding is married and has a 21-year-old stepdaughter.</TE>
<TE>   She joined the CDC as head of health care quality and led the
fight against the spread of infections in hospitals. Last year she
began a temporary assignment as acting deputy director of the CDC's
National Center for Infectious Diseases, a position she held when the
anthrax attack began.</TE>
<TE>   As a CDC insider for the last four years, Gerberding has seen
firsthand the agency's struggles with aging equipment and decrepit
buildings. Thrust into the spotlight after the anthrax cases were
confirmed, the CDC received an infusion of money, including about $2
billion earmarked for bioterrorism preparedness at the federal and
state levels and for the acquisition of vaccines for deadly diseases,
such as smallpox.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, however, many of the agency's other programs
have faced cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC's top slot has been vacant since the resignation in March
of Dr. Jeffrey Koplan. Koplan, who spent the majority of his career
at the CDC, had defended his agency against charges it was too slow
to respond to last fall's anthrax attack, which left five dead and at
least 13 others sick.</TE>
<TE>   It was during the mail-launched bioterrorist attack that
Gerberding rose to national prominence as a top CDC spokeswoman,
earning praise from politicians and public health groups for her
straightforward style and expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ivan C. A. Walks, who was head of Washington's health
department during the anthrax crisis, called Gerberding a "solid
scientist."</TE>
<TE>   "She also understands the importance of the big national
scientists working with the local people in order to make sure the
best information is available to the public," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "She is a very sensible, extraordinarily well-informed person who
doesn't hide behind jargon or the idea that she has special knowledge
about complicated matters that she really can't quite explain," said
Dr. Julius R. Krevans, chancellor emeritus at UC San Francisco, who
has known her since she was an intern.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a clinical scientist who has actually had a lot of
experience dealing with patient problems," he said. "It's one thing
to make out the guidelines and it's another to understand that
clinicians are the ones having to carry out those guidelines. She
knows the difference and it will serve the public well."</TE>

died and another was missing after they were swept away in flood
waters.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Rick Perry activated the Texas National Guard to help with
relief efforts. Rescue teams used rafts, personal watercraft and
helicopters to rescue people from stranded vehicles and flooded
homes.</LD>
<LD>   The storm has dumped more than 15 inches of rain in some areas.
Less than a week ago, water restrictions were imposed because of a
drought.</LD>
<TE>   Low-lying areas in San Antonio were under several feet of water,
while dry creek beds were transformed into boiling brown torrents
carrying trees and household appliances downstream.</TE>
<TE>   In Utopia, about 75 miles west of San Antonio, a man died after
being washed off a farm tractor while traveling to help other people,
said Travis Hall, a state police spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Also near Utopia, a man was swept away from a car stuck in deep
water.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen people were ordered to evacuate a mobile home
park in Austin.</TE>
<TE>   Storms will continue until at least today and possibly into the
Fourth of July, said weather service meteorologist Larry Eblen.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, a second man drowned in Austin when he fell into a
swollen creek.</TE>
<TE>   An 11-year-old boy was in critical condition after he was rescued
from a San Antonio creek, where he fell in after losing his footing
on a bank.</TE>
<TE>   About 70 roads in Hays County were closed by high water.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is flooded that can be flooded," said Hays County
sheriff's Sgt. Allen Bridges. "There is no way to get east or west or
north or south ... right now."</TE>
<TE>   The governor said two National Guard helicopters were sent to help
travelers who were stranded by high water on Interstate 10 on
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty National Guard personnel and 10 large trucks were sent to
San Antonio to assist with rescues and evacuations.</TE>
<TE>   Several state parks were closed or had been forced to move campers
to higher ground Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Flooding of the Frio and Nueces rivers and their tributaries
closed a 15-mile stretch of Interstate 35 from Cotulla to Dilley in
Frio County for more than 10 hours Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "The county is shut down. We've had cars swept off the road and
people stuck in houses," Frio County chief deputy Rodney Lucio said.</TE>
<TE>   Farther south, LaSalle County also had high water.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess this is our 100-year flood.... I'm flooded all over the
county. Every crossing I have is flooded," said LaSalle County
Sheriff Jerry Patterson. The Border Patrol office in Laredo sent
watercraft to aid with rescue efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The heavy four-day rainfall had boosted the Edwards Aquifer, a
main source of drinking water in the area, by more than 25 feet on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the decline of water in the aquifer had triggered
mandatory water usage restrictions in San Antonio.</TE>

<HD>Preparing for a Safe, and Sane, Fourth</HD>
<DH>Festivities: Security will be tight at gatherings, but
Americans 'should celebrate heartily because we have freedom,'
president says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER and ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush said Tuesday that Americans should not
let threats of terrorist attacks deter them from publicly gathering
to celebrate Independence Day, as the nation's cities and towns
geared up to provide heavy security for their holiday festivities.</LD>
<LD>   During a visit to a Milwaukee church, Bush said Americans should
"celebrate the fact that we're fortunate enough to be Americans" on
the Fourth of July.</LD>
<LD>   "They should celebrate heartily because we have freedom and we
love freedom," Bush said. "And ... they should also know our
government is doing everything [it] can to make the homeland secure."</LD>
<TE>   Bush plans to spend the holiday Thursday at a low-key event in
Ripley, W.Va., and then return to the White House to watch fireworks
on the Mall, White House officials said.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said there were no plans as of
Tuesday to change the government's terrorism alert level, which is
now at yellow, or mid-level on the five-color scale.</TE>
<TE>   "It remains a time of celebration and vigilance," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   In the nation's capital, the FBI and other law enforcement
authorities said they would be on heightened alert for the
possibility of terrorist attacks, even though they have received no
specific or corroborated threats. That was also the case in Los
Angeles, New York, Las Vegas, Seattle and other cities.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, the State Department formally warned Americans
living overseas to be even more vigilant, telling them to keep a low
profile.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. government continues to receive credible indications
that extremist individuals are planning additional terrorist actions
against U.S. interests," said the State Department's "Worldwide
Caution" memo.</TE>
<TE>   "Such actions may be imminent and include suicide operations," the
memo said. "We have no further information on specific targets,
timing or method of attack." As July 4 approached, U.S. officials
said they were continuing to pick up vague, uncorroborated, but still
threatening intelligence "chatter" about a possible attack within the
United States as well.</TE>
<TE>   A confidential warning from the FBI to federal, state and local
law enforcement agencies said that although the bureau has no
"specific or credible information" of a July 4 threat, "the political
and cultural significance of this date warrants increased vigilance."</TE>
<TE>   Millions of Americans are expected to congregate in open places to
celebrate the first Independence Day since the attacks of Sept. 11,
to watch parades and enjoy fireworks displays, concerts and other
festivities.</TE>
<TE>   As they do, thousands of FBI agents, local and state police and
other authorities plan to circulate among them, watching for signs of
potential trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "People will be gathering to celebrate Independence Day, and the
fact is that if a terrorist incident did occur, it could cause
casualties because of the large numbers of people gathered in one
place," said one FBI official in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have appropriate personnel in place should something
occur," said a second FBI official, who also asked not to be
identified. The FBI has directed all of its 56 field offices to
submit their plans for canvassing major events in their areas, and
the bureau is beefing up round-the-clock coverage at its Strategic
Information and Operation Center in Washington. The White House
situation room also will be fully staffed and on high alert, as will
the embryonic U.S. homeland security network.</TE>
<TE>   The capital, always considered a likely target of any terrorist
strike, has been abuzz for weeks with talk of July 4 threats.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in Washington said that they were stepping up security
to unprecedented levels at the gala fireworks celebration on the
Mall--the nation's premiere July 4 event.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2,000 officers from 16 different agencies--far more than
in years past--will be on hand, and there will be numerous extra
checkpoints and special double-fencing around the historic 300-acre
area, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel very prepared at this point," said Teresa Chambers, chief
of U.S. Park Police. "As of now, it's all systems go."</TE>
<TE>   A lot is riding on the event, Chambers acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our first post 9/11 July 4 celebration for
Washington--what greater place to celebrate our independence and let
the terrorists know that they missed the target?" she said. "There is
no reason for anyone [planning to attend the event] to change his or
her plans," Chambers added. "My family is going to be down there.
This is where we want to celebrate this Fourth of July."</TE>
<TE>   Donna Stubbs of Alexandria, Va., said she went to the fireworks
celebration on the Mall last year. But this year, she and her husband
are staying away.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way we're going to the Mall," Stubbs said. "I just
don't want to be in harm's way with all this going on. Who knows what
will happen?"</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the FBI planned no special deployments, saying it
was already on high alert.</TE>
<TE>   "We're already doing everything we can," said Special Agent Matt
McLaughlin, a spokesman for the Los Angeles field office. He said the
office long ago drew up contingency plans in the event of an attack,
and more recently coordinated specific security plans with local and
state law enforcement authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the Los Angeles field office "aggressively"
investigated two separate allegations about impending local attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In one, intelligence intercepts indicated that about 25 Al Qaeda
members had come through three ports, including Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   A second threat warning indicated that a container ship with
dozens of terrorists was headed for Los Angeles, perhaps to Santa
Catalina Island.</TE>
<TE>   "Those were matters in which the FBI initially assessed and
determined that there was no need to issue an alert," said
McLaughlin.</TE>
<TE>   In Las Vegas, the FBI also is on guard, even though a warning
about a possible terrorist attack on "the day of freedom" in that
city turned out to be a hoax, FBI officials said.</TE>
<TE>   And in New York, security will be extremely heavy, especially at
Macy's July 4 fireworks display, which has the theme "A Time for
Heroes."</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference in Albany on Tuesday, Gov. George Pataki said
2,000 members of the National Guard would be deployed around the
state, with extra state police sent to the Canadian border. Some
troops will augment police at New York City's bridges and tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   Spectators attending the fireworks show along the East River in
New York City will be scrutinized as they are funneled through 14
police checkpoints. Police launches will keep boats away from the
display.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered a no-fly zone
that will last until the end of September near the Statue of Liberty.</TE>
<TE>   Teams of specially trained police with heavy weapons also have
been assigned to prominent buildings and other landmarks, and
radiation detectors will be in place, Pataki said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers John J. Goldman, Vicki Kemper and James
Gerstenzang contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Wayward Orphaned Orca Is Healthy and Homebound, Authorities
Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>SEATTLE -- An orphaned female orca has passed all medical tests and
is ready to be reunited with her family in Canadian waters, a
spokesman for the National Marine Fisheries Service said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "It is time for her to go home," Brian Gorman said. "She's got a
ticket, her bags are packed and we're just waiting for word from the
Canadians."</LD>
<LD>   Gorman said U.S. researchers gave results of the orca's final
battery of medical tests to their Canadian counterparts over the
weekend. The animal, which was captured when she became overly
friendly with boaters in Puget Sound, was found to have no
communicable diseases, and other minor medical conditions have
cleared up.</LD>
<TE>   "She's behaving like a healthy, active young whale," Gorman said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans,
Michelle McCombs, did not immediately return a Tuesday call for
comment on her agency's stance in the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Gorman said Canadian researchers probably got their first look at
the latest test results Tuesday, since Monday was the Canada Day
holiday.</TE>
<TE>   He said the fisheries service and Canadian officials have been in
daily discussions about moving the 2-year-old, 1,240-pound killer
whale north. Authorities hope she will rejoin her pod when it makes
its annual summer visit to waters east of Vancouver Island.</TE>
<TE>   She was captured by a fisheries service team June 13 and has been
under close watch in a 40- by 40-foot holding pen in Clam Bay near
Manchester, on the Kitsap Peninsula across Puget Sound from Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The agency decided to capture her in part because of concerns
about her health.</TE>
<TE>   The whale, dubbed A-73 by researchers for her order in her birth
pod, was first spotted near the Vashon ferry dock in mid-January.
Researchers believe her pod left her after her mother died, and she
found her way into Puget Sound.</TE>
<TE>   Whale activists are helping to raise money to cover capture and
relocation costs, which could reach $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   The whale has adjusted well to captivity, Gorman said. Since her
first few days in the pen, when she ate only one or two 5-pound
salmon, she has increased her daily intake to at least 40 to 50
pounds of fish.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian officials have said they would not allow A-73 into their
waters if there was any sign she could have communicable diseases.
However, Gorman said the U.S. team has conducted an array of tests
for diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian experts will oversee the effort to reunite A-73 with her
home pod in Johnstone Strait, off Vancouver Island. Plans call for
her to be held in a penned-off cove to allow her and the pod to
become accustomed to each other.</TE>

<HD>Ala. City Seals Its New Era</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Seeking to dilute images of its racist past, officials in Montgomery,
Ala., voted Tuesday to add the motto "Birthplace of the Civil Rights
Movement" to the city seal.</LD>
<LD>   For 50 years, the seal has carried the phrase "Cradle of the
Confederacy," a reference to the city's role as the first capital of
the Confederate States of America.</LD>
<LD>   But many residents of Montgomery, where blacks now outnumber
whites, found that legacy offensive. And they wanted to honor the
city's role as site of the first major civil rights demonstration,
the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955-56.</LD>
<TE>   The new seal, approved by a unanimous vote, features both slogans,
along with a six-pointed gold star.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it," said Councilman Willie Cook, who led the effort
to include the civil rights motto, "our city has a dual history. Now
our seal reflects that."</TE>
<TE>   Seals, flags and other public symbols have become increasingly
controversial in the South as residents struggle with how to display
their history.</TE>
<TE>   While many white Southerners celebrate their Confederate heritage,
many blacks loathe it for its connection to slavery. Last year, after
a long, emotional debate, Georgia changed its state flag from one
dominated by the Confederate battle cross to one barely showing it.</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina and Alabama have also wrestled with placement of
the Confederate cross on public property.</TE>
<TE>   "Cradle of the Confederacy" was added to the Montgomery seal in
1952 by an all-white City Council reacting to the rumblings of the
civil rights movement.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the seal has appeared on the city letterhead, official
correspondence and police badges.</TE>
<TE>   "How would you like it if you're black and get stopped by an
officer wearing that on his chest?" asked Cook, who is black.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Cook proposed the new slogan but stopped short of calling
for the removal of the Confederate wording.</TE>
<TE>   Though whites make up less than half of Montgomery's 202,000
residents, the mayor and the majority of council members are white.</TE>

<HD>Suicide Punctuates Hunt for Serial Killer</HD>
<DH>Crime: It took five years to link a suspect to the deaths
of three young Virginia girls. As authorities closed in, he killed
himself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SPOTSYLVANIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>SPOTSYLVANIA, Va. -- The murders were among the most publicized in
recent Virginia history: three girls abducted from their yards and
killed in the rolling hills of the state's Civil War battlefields.
For more than five years, investigators found few clues.</LD>
<LD>   They called in psychics and checked out 11,000 leads. DNA from
400,000 convicted felons was tested. A $150,000 reward was offered.
Even a segment on "America's Most Wanted" failed to produce any
useful tips. Week after week, a federal and local task force that at
times numbered 80 officers met to pore over the evidence, which led
them nowhere.</LD>
<LD>   Then, suddenly, there was a message last week on the Spotsylvania
sheriff's hotline. "I think I've found your boy," said Charles
Pickett, a case manager with the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children in Alexandria, Va.</LD>
<TE>   Computer data, Pickett said, had linked the suspect in the June 24
abduction and rape of a teenage South Carolina girl with three
victims from here: Sofia Silva, 16, killed in September 1996; and
Kristin Lisk, 15, and her sister, Kati, 12, killed eight months
later.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to stay calm but I'm vibrating inside," Spotsylvania's
sheriff, Ronald Knight, said Tuesday. "But if the bottom falls out,
like it has before, we still have to go back at the investigation
again."</TE>
<TE>   The 38-year-old suspect, Richard Marc Evonitz, fatally shot
himself Thursday as police in Sarasota, Fla., surrounded him and a
police dog bit his leg. Authorities hope that DNA will prove he was
the killer of the girls in Spotsylvania, 70 miles south of
Washington. Lab results may not be known for two weeks or more.</TE>
<TE>   Evonitz had served three years' probation after pleading no
contest in 1987 to a Florida charge of lewd and lascivious behavior
in the presence of a child. Police targeted him last week after the
South Carolina teenager escaped and notified authorities.</TE>
<TE>   By the time police arrived, he had fled his apartment near
Columbia. Inside, authorities said they found notes about where the
Spotsylvania girls had lived and a local newspaper published the day
after the Lisk sisters disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   When police implicated Evonitz in the June 24 abduction, the South
Carolina office of the missing children's center began running data
through its computers and notified Pickett, an 18-year veteran of the
organization's headquarters in Alexandria.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a huge database," Pickett, who lives in Spotsylvania,
said Tuesday. "When I ran Evonitz's name, timelines with the
Spotsylvania murders started matching, age groups and circumstances
of the crimes matched, addresses came up.... By the end of the day I
had a 50-page printout to give the sheriff."</TE>
<TE>   Knight, the sheriff, said the task force working on the
Spotsylvania killings has been doubled to 12 officers since Evonitz's
suicide, and as many as 70 people will be interviewed or
re-interviewed. "We want to reconstruct the last 10 years of
Evonitz's life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The slayings traumatized the towns of Spotsylvania County, a
normally quiet area of 100,000 people that serves as a bedroom
community for Washington and northern Virginia. For the first time,
parents began accompanying their children to school, locking their
doors and eyeing strangers warily.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost our innocence with those killings," Knight said.
"Suddenly we were no longer country bumpkins. We weren't immune
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Sofia disappeared one afternoon after school while doing homework
on the front step of her home in a subdivision known as Oak Grove
Terrace. She left money and personal possessions, and there was no
sign of a struggle.</TE>
<TE>   Police theorized she got into a car with someone she knew. Six
weeks later her body, wrapped and bound in a white cloth covering,
was found in a nearby stream.</TE>
<TE>   Eight months later, Kristin and Kati disappeared from their front
yard after coming home in separate school buses. Kristin's school
bag, with a ladybug good luck charm attached to the zipper, was left
on the ground, next to her geometry book. A few days later, their
bodies were found in a river.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies said Evonitz was unknown to them when his name
was mentioned as the prime suspect last week. He apparently had no
police record during the two years he lived here in the mid-1990s
selling computer-operated grinding machines.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia law did not require Evonitz to register as a sex
offender. The law has since been changed and requires offenders to
register within 10 days of changing residences.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities initially had said the deaths of Sofia Silva and the
Lisk sisters were unrelated because a suspect in the Silva slaying
had been arrested and investigators said the DNA evidence against him
was overwhelming. Charges were later dropped, however, when state
officials admitted that a lab examiner had erred in determining that
fibers found in the suspect's van matched those on the victim's body.</TE>

<HD>Vegas' Only Trauma Unit to Close Today</HD>
<DH>Health: Fifty-seven of 58 surgeons have quit, entirely
shuttering the hospital's center. Doctors cite exposure to costly
malpractice insurance lawsuits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>LAS VEGAS -- The only trauma center serving this city of 1.4 million
residents--and an expected holiday weekend influx of a
quarter-million visitors--will close at 7 a.m. today for lack of
doctors.</LD>
<LD>   All but one of the 58 trauma-trained orthopedic surgeons serving
the county-operated University Medical Center have quit, citing
exposure to costly medical malpractice lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   With their departure, the hospital was forced to close its trauma
center altogether, making other specialists--including vascular,
thoracic, plastic and other surgeons--unavailable as well,
administrators said.</LD>
<TE>   Seriously injured victims of car and boating accidents, shootings
and other life-threatening incidents will be taken to local emergency
rooms, which provide reduced levels of care.</TE>
<TE>   Once stabilized, those patients may be airlifted to the Loma Linda
University Medical Center in San Bernardino County or trauma centers
in Salt Lake City, Phoenix or elsewhere in Southern California,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year-old University Medical Center trauma unit served not
only patients in southern Nevada, but those from Needles and Barstow,
Calif., to the injured in southern Utah and northern Arizona. The
center saw more than 11,000 patients a year and claimed to be among
the 10 busiest in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Trauma care was introduced nationwide in the late 1960s to address
the "golden hour"--the initial 60 minutes after a serious injury when
appropriate and timely treatment can mean the difference between life
and death.</TE>
<TE>   "Most communities--certainly with populations of a million or
greater--have at least one trauma center," said Dr. David Hoyt,
medical director of trauma at the American College of Surgeons, which
sets trauma center standards.</TE>
<TE>   While trauma centers in some cities have closed because of various
financial pressures, never before has a city this size lost its only
one, Hoyt said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tragedy to our community's public health, the darkest
day I can recall," said Dr. John Fildes, the Las Vegas trauma
center's medical director. "Closing the trauma center means the
standard of care that our community has come to rely on is going to
be turned back 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   Erin Kenny, a Clark County commissioner who heads the hospital's
board of directors, said she was more disappointed than angry at the
doctors, calling their actions tantamount to a protest strike over
escalating malpractice insurance premiums.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't want to be the doctor who has to look into the eyes of
a family whose loved one was killed because there was no trauma
center," she said. "That will be devastating, and I'm fearful it will
become a reality in very short order."</TE>
<TE>   The closing was precipitated by sharply rising costs of
malpractice insurance in southern Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Nevada State Medical Assn., about 140 physicians
in Clark County--about 10% of the region's doctors--have quit or
retired since February or are threatening to do so because insurance
premiums have doubled or more this year.</TE>
<TE>   Because trauma doctors are independent and separately insured
contractors at the center, they are targeted as "deep pockets" by
litigious patients because lawsuits against publicly run University
Medical Center and its medical school physicians are capped at
$50,000, said Dr. Anthony B. Serfustini, chief of the trauma center's
orthopedics department.</TE>
<TE>   "If a patient wakes up as a quadriplegic through no fault of mine,
and after they settle with UMC and a medical school physician and the
anesthesiologist for $50,000 each, they'll then go after me for
another $5 million," he said. "They'll take my house, my '81 Toyota
Land Cruiser, my savings, my kids' college tuition fund. They'll take
it all."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors here want the type of tort reform embraced by California
in 1975, which among other things limits jury awards to $250,000 for
malpractice pain and suffering.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Nevada established its own, state-operated insurance
company to make available less expensive liability insurance,
especially for obstetricians. Officials are hoping to expand coverage
for other, high-risk specialties.</TE>
<TE>   "Long-term, lasting solutions ... will require legislative
action," said Gov. Kenny Guinn, who plans to call a special
legislative session to address the problem.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, local emergency rooms are preparing for more--and
harder--work.</TE>
<TE>   At Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center and Sunrise Children's
Hospital, the emergency room has been fortified with extra X-ray
equipment and a blood bank; two surgery rooms also have been set
aside for trauma cases, spokeswoman Ann Lynch said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, trauma specialists--including those who had worked at
University Medical Center but also have privileges at her
hospitals--will not staff the emergency room around the clock, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "You won't be getting the trauma team that flies into action when
the ambulance hits the door," she said. "Many of our staff haven't
been in trauma service for years, and they're doing their best in a
few days to brush up and get ready.</TE>
<TE>   "No emergency room will meet the standard of care that the trauma
center did," she said. "There's just no way, and we realize that."</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>BOSTON -- Innkeeper Sandy Knox-Johnston wanted to treat World Trade
Center rescue workers and families of victims to free vacations on
the exclusive island of Nantucket, off the Massachusetts coast.</LD>
<LD>   But only six people accepted the offer in the fall and spring.</LD>
<LD>   Now, in peak summer season, Knox-Johnston is scrambling to find
space for 75 hopeful vacationers through her program,
Island-to-Island.</LD>
<TE>   "I think the people in New York were not emotionally ready to
leave until the World Trade Center site was cleared," said
Knox-Johnston, 59, whose phone started ringing in May.</TE>
<TE>   The vacationers asked to come when their children were out of
school, and Knox-Johnston has agreed to help them find accommodations
in the high season.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have said no and, 'We're sorry, July and August are too
chaotic,' " Knox-Johnston said. "But that's a very hard thing to say
to people who have been working in the World Trade Center site."</TE>
<TE>   Some applicants have been offered rooms by innkeepers, private
homeowners and through a similar Sept. 11 respite program on Cape
Cod.</TE>

<HD>Mich. Senator Sides Against Yucca Site Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) said Tuesday she will vote against
moving radioactive waste to Yucca Mountain in Nevada because she is
worried the shipments could be the target of a terrorist attack</LD>
<LD>   Stabenow said the Bush administration has not done enough to
ensure the safety of the thousands of shipments that would bring
nuclear waste from around the country to the proposed waste
repository 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Stabenow cited an Energy Department study that raises the
possibility that waste might be barged north on Lake Michigan to
Muskegon, Mich., where it would be transferred to rail cars destined
for Nevada.</LD>
<TE>   Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham denied in a letter to Stabenow
that the study commits the department to using barges. She said his
letter did not provide enough assurance.</TE>
<TE>   Stabenow is the second senator in recent days to come out against
the Yucca Mountain project, joining fellow freshman Jean Carnahan
(D-Mo.), who announced her opposition Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada's two senators, Democrat Harry Reid and Republican John
Ensign, both of whom oppose the Yucca plan, still face a steep climb
to persuade 51 senators to kill the repository plan.</TE>
<TE>   Used reactor fuel in Michigan is being held in water-filled pools
at four plants in the state.</TE>

<HD>No Benefits Seen From Hormone Therapy</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Hearts aren't protected and the regimen could be
risky for women, study finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hormone replacement therapy does nothing to protect the hearts of
women with heart disease and confers some risk, according to a pair
of reports on a new study that tracked several thousand
post-menopausal women for nearly seven years.</LD>
<LD>   The reports in today's Journal of the American Medical Assn. found
no reduction in heart attacks or overall risk of dying when the women
were given the hormones estrogen and progestin. They found no
reduction, either, in other signs that disease had progressed, such
as the need for bypass surgery.</LD>
<LD>   In contrast, the risk of forming blood clots was doubled, and the
rate of gallbladder surgery increased by 50%, in the group that took
the hormones compared to those who swallowed placebo pills.</LD>
<TE>   "I think this study lays to rest the notion that hormone
replacement therapy prevents heart attacks or other cardiac events in
women with preexisting coronary disease, " said Diana Petitti,
director of research for Kaiser Permanente Southern California, who
wrote a commentary accompanying the two papers.</TE>
<TE>   But the study does not rule out the possibility that hormone
treatment might help prevent heart disease in post-menopausal women
who have not yet developed the disease, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does it negate other reasons for taking the hormones, such as
relief for hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, and
protection against fractures in women who have osteoporosis.</TE>
<TE>   The study--known as the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement
Study, or HERS--was undertaken because much evidence seems to link
estrogen to protection against heart disease. For instance,
epidemiological studies suggest that women who opt to take estrogen
have a lower risk for heart disease than those who don't.</TE>
<TE>   But there is always the chance that women taking hormones differ
from those who do not: For instance, they may be richer or more apt
to go to the doctor or look after their health. These factors, not
the hormones, might be the real reason for the differences in risk.</TE>
<TE>   In the trial, 2,763 U.S. women with heart disease--age 67 on
average at the start of the study--were randomly assigned to receive
either estrogen and progestin or a placebo. Nobody knew who was
getting hormones.</TE>
<TE>   Results from the trial after four years, published in 1998, were
not encouraging. Overall, there was no observed difference in risk.
For the first year of the study, the risk of heart attacks was even
higher in the group taking hormones. Then, that risk declined.</TE>
<TE>   That decline led scientists at the 20 centers involved in the UC
San Francisco study to continue monitoring the women. They hoped that
the decline would continue, leading to a protective effect from the
hormone. After nearly three years, it did not.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, "it seems likely that there are no benefits and there are
some harms," said Dr. Stephen Hulley, coauthor on both studies and
professor and chairman of the department of epidemiology and
biostatistics at UC San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Women with heart disease would be better off using proven
therapies such as low-dose aspirin, blood pressure medications and
cholesterol-lowering drugs, doctors said. Diet and exercise are also
important.</TE>
<TE>   And because there are many reasons why women opt to take hormones,
the decision for each is personal, they said, to be reached after
discussion with a doctor.</TE>

<HD>Prostate Cancer Test Leads to Overdiagnosis, Research Finds</HD>
<DH>Health: About a third of men older than 65 would never
experience disease symptoms, study says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY SINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roughly one-third of men older than 65 who have been diagnosed with
prostate cancer through the use of a commonly used test may be
overdiagnosed and are receiving unnecessary treatments, according to
a new study published today. The study, a statistical analysis of
prostate cancer incidence conducted by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center in Seattle, found that 35% of patients screened with
the Prostate Specific Antigen test would never experience any
symptoms of the disease in their lifetimes.</LD>
<LD>   The study's findings address a long-running controversy over the
PSA test, which measures a level of protein in the blood associated
with the cancer. While the test can provide early detection of the
disease, the treatments carry the risk of side effects such as
impotence and incontinence.</LD>
<LD>   The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute, combined data from a national registry of cancer cases and
PSA screening information from Medicare records to create a
statistical model of how many men were overdiagnosed.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Durado Brooks, director of the prostate and colorectal cancer
national office at the American Cancer Society, stressed that the
study shows that PSA screening allowed most cancers to be picked up
earlier. But the study did not address the effectiveness of early
diagnosis in decreasing the number of deaths the disease causes.</TE>
<TE>   This question can only be answered with randomized clinical
trials, which are being conducted in the U.S. and Europe. Results
from the American trial, which is sponsored by the National Cancer
Institute, are not expected for another four to six years.</TE>
<TE>   Prostate cancer can range from a disease that is very aggressive
to one that is relatively harmless. Many men can live out their life
with prostate cancer without being diagnosed, said Brooks. But he
added that it is "difficult to determine which cancers will be slow
growers and which will be aggressive bad actors."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 200,000 men will be diagnosed this year with prostate
cancer, which is the second leading cause of cancer death in men,
according to the American Cancer Society.</TE>
<TE>   Treatment options include surgery, radiation, hormone therapy or
no treatment. Each individual will have a different set of factors,
such as PSA levels, age or other health conditions, that will
determine what treatment to pursue, said Ruth Etzioni, lead author of
the study and a biostatistician at the cancer research center.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the side effects of treatment, some men may opt out of
treatment and instead closely monitor their disease.</TE>
<TE>   This "watchful waiting" approach may be appropriate for older men
or men with other health problems, such as advanced heart disease or
diabetes, Brooks said. If a patient is expected to live for only
three to five years because of other health conditions, there may be
no point in undergoing prostate cancer therapy, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The American Cancer Society encourages men to be screened for
prostate cancer or to discuss the issue with their doctor. Men with a
family history of the disease should definitely be screened, the
cancer society says.</TE>

<HD>It's Home Run Derby for White Sox, Tigers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Comiskey Park proved to be the friendly confines in Chicago for at
least one day.</LD>
<LD>   Magglio Ordonez and Sandy Alomar each homered twice as the White
Sox and Tigers combined for a major league-record tying 12 home runs
in Chicago's 17-9 victory over Detroit on Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Both teams hit six home runs in the game as they tied the record
they set together on May 28, 1995 in Detroit.</LD>
<TE>   Kenny Lofton and Jose Valentin also homered for the White Sox, who
have scored 77 runs in winning seven of nine games against the Tigers
this season.</TE>
<TE>   "If you made good contact in the air the ball was probably going
to go out," Alomar said.</TE>
<TE>   Dmitri Young homered twice for Detroit. Robert Fick, George
Lombard, Wendell Magee and Damion Easley also homered.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like Colorado out there," Young said. "Everybody put it
way in the air. We lost, but it was still uplifting to see our bats
like that."</TE>
<TE>   Ordonez, who lost out in his bid to become the American League's
30th All-Star earlier in the day, hit a solo homer in the first
inning against Adam Bernero (2-4) and a grand slam off Jose Paniagua
in Chicago's seven-run eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 4-3, the White Sox scored four runs off Bernero in the
fourth inning to take the lead for good.</TE>
<TE>   New York 10, Cleveland 5--Raul Mondesi hit an RBI single and
scored twice in his Yankee debut, and New York overcame a
record-setting homer by Jim Thome to beat the Indians at New York.
Thome became the first Indian player to homer in six consecutive
games, launching a long drive off Roger Clemens, who left after five
innings because of leg cramps.</TE>
<TE>   Batting fifth, Mondesi went one for two and reached base all four
times he batted. He walked, was hit by a pitch, got aboard on an
error and had an RBI single in the seventh. Jorge Posada's grand
slam, the fourth of his career, capped a seven-run seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 2-6, Toronto 1-4--Spot starters Tim Wakefield and Sunny Kim
gave Boston a boost in both games as the Red Sox swept the Blue Jays
at Boston. Kim pitched six scoreless innings in the nightcap and but
ran into trouble in the seventh before the Red Sox held on. Wakefield
also pitched six shutout innings and Lou Merloni hit a two-run triple
in the seventh as Boston came from behind to win the opener.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 4, Minnesota 3--Olmedo Saenz hit a pinch-hit two-run home
run in the ninth inning to help the A's win at Oakland. Eric Chavez
doubled off Eddie Guardado (1-2) to start the A's ninth. Jermaine Dye
struck out but then Saenz, pinch-hitting for John Mabry, homered on
an 0-and-2 pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 7, Seattle 5--Mike Sweeney hit a tiebreaking homer in
the ninth against Kazuhiro Sasaki and Raul Ibanez connected two
batters later for his second of the game as the Royals won at
Seattle. Sasaki (2-3) has given up only five earned runs all season,
four in his last two outings. Paul Byrd (11-5) gave up five runs in
eight innings to get the win.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 3, Tampa Bay 1--Rafael Palmeiro hit his 465th homer, tying
him with Dave Winfield for 22nd place, and Kenny Rogers gave up three
hits and one run over seven innings as the Rangers won at Arlington,
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Gonzalez homered for Texas, which ended a four-game losing
streak.</TE>

<HD>Lopez Feels at Home, Shuts Down Angels</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Mexico native says he hears many Edison Field
fans cheering for him in Orioles' 3-0 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever since Fernandomania swept across Southern California two decades
ago, the Angels have longed for a Mexican star to call their own.</LD>
<LD>   Mexican immigrants and their children, friends and relatives fill
neighborhoods near Edison Field, in Anaheim and in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels have sent scouts to Mexico, signed affiliations with
Mexican league teams, worked with the local Hispanic Chamber of
Commerce, even imported a Mexican league team for an exhibition game,
all in an attempt to win the loyalty and patronage of those potential
fans.</LD>
<TE>   The winning pitcher Tuesday was born in Oaxaca, Mexico. He still
lives there. Unfortunately for the Angel players, and unfortunately
for the Angel marketing department, Rodrigo Lopez pitches for the
Baltimore Orioles.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez and three relievers combined on a four-hit shutout, with Jay
Gibbons hitting two solo home runs, and the Orioles beat the Angels,
3-0, before 18,521 at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt great to pitch in California," Lopez said. "I heard a lot
of Mexican fans rooting for me. It felt really good."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez (7-3) scattered four singles over seven innings, as the
Angels were shut out for the first time since May 7. The rookie
lowered his earned-run average to 2.89, trailing only Boston's Derek
Lowe and Pedro Martinez among American League pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   In defeat, the Angels' Ramon Ortiz pitched another splendid game.
Ortiz (8-6) gave up two runs in eight innings, striking out seven.
His 3.38 ERA ranks among the top 10 in the league.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Schoeneweis, removed from the Angel rotation last week,
entered the game in the ninth inning, in his first relief appearance
since July 21, 1999. Gibbons hit his first pitch for a home run.
Schoeneweis pitched to four batters, giving up two hits, and Matt
Wise got the final out of the inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels botched several chances to score, going 0 for 9 with
runners in scoring position. Lopez walked five batters and hit one,
affording the Angels a fair share of baserunners.</TE>
<TE>   "He did a great job," Angel shortstop David Eckstein said. "When
he got into trouble, he pitched out of it. He kept us off balance
just enough."</TE>
<TE>   They ran into tough luck in the third inning, putting runners on
first and second with none out, but Tim Salmon and Garret Anderson
lined out.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth, with second and third and one out, Bengie Molina
flied out, but Troy Glaus was running from third base on contact. By
the time he retreated to the base, it was too late to tag.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, 26, is one of the year's unlikely success stories. He
pitched seven seasons, mostly undistinguished ones, in the San Diego
organization. When the Padres finally gave him a shot in the major
leagues, two years ago, he started six games, lost three and won
none.</TE>
<TE>   He shrugged and kept on pitching, summers and winters alike. He
goes home every winter and pitches in the Mexican winter league, for
the Culiacan Tomato Growers.</TE>
<TE>   He was the pride of the Tomato Growers last winter, with a 10-2
record during the winter league season and a shutout in the
championship game of the Caribbean World Series.</TE>
<TE>   But he was just another arm in spring training, a guy with a
non-roster invitation to camp and a uniform with No. 82 on the back.
He won a spot in the bullpen--and changed his uniform number to
13--and pitched his way into the starting rotation.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted this opportunity in San Diego, but I never got it,"
Lopez said. "Now I'm going to do whatever it takes to be successful."</TE>
<TE>   His presence in Anaheim on Tuesday evoked a bit of Dodger trivia.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez and catcher Geronimo Gil, who was acquired from the Dodgers
last July for reliever Mike Trombley, represent the first Mexican
battery on a major league team since 1987, when Alex Trevino caught
Fernando Valenzuela for the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels good to come out here and pitch well," Lopez said,
"because Fernando Valenzuela did the same during his career in
California."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Schoeneweis Draws Interest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels dropped Scott Schoeneweis from their starting rotation
Friday. Since then, agent Scott Boras said, several teams have called
to ask whether he believes the Angels might trade Schoeneweis.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no doubt in my mind he's going to be a successful major
league starter for a long time," Boras said.</LD>
<LD>   Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman said that he also has gotten
calls about Schoeneweis. For now, Schoeneweis isn't going anywhere,
except to the Angel bullpen.</LD>
<TE>   "We're looking at winning now," Stoneman said. "Let's see if this
helps us."</TE>
<TE>   While Boras said he understood the rationale behind the Angels'
decision--they needed another left-hander in the bullpen, and rookie
John Lackey was ready to join the rotation--he still believes
Schoeneweis can develop and prosper as a starter. Boras cited his
ability to pitch lots of innings (205 last season) and keep his team
in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "He has the capacity to be a No. 3 starter on a lot of teams,"
Boras said.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis, 28, is 6-6 with a 5.41 earned-run average. The Angels
went 8-7 in his starts.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels believe he might be better suited to the bullpen,
although they have not ruled out returning him to the rotation. He is
not eligible for free agency for another three years, but he is
eligible for salary arbitration this fall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Darin Erstad finished last in the online voting for the final spot
on the American League All-Star team. Boston's Johnny Damon won,
followed in order by Cleveland's Jim Thome, Oakland's Eric Chavez,
Chicago's Magglio Ordonez and Erstad.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad said he would have voted for Chavez. He said he was neither
disappointed nor surprised in his last-place finish.</TE>
<TE>   "They all have better numbers than I do," Erstad said.</TE>
<TE>   Damon is hitting .312 with five home runs, 60 runs scored, 39 runs
batted in and 18 stolen bases. Erstad is hitting .313 with six
homers, 49 runs, 47 RBIs and 14 steals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In spring training, the Angels planned for Scott Spiezio and Shawn
Wooten to share time at first base, with Wooten getting most of the
starts against left-handers. But, with Wooten one week away from
completing his rehabilitation assignment and Spiezio hitting .371
against left-handers, Manager Mike Scioscia said Spiezio would
continue to play against lefties.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels can use Wooten at first base, third base, catcher and
designated hitter. They're 16-6 against left-handed starters, with
Spiezio, third baseman Troy Glaus (.338), catcher Bengie Molina
(.300) and infielders Benji Gil (.394) and Jose Nieves (.356) all
hitting well against lefties. Wooten's return could make Nieves
expendable, and the Angels would consider trading him for an
experienced relief pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Wooten is scheduled to play this week with triple-A Salt Lake and
Monday and Tuesday with Class-A Rancho Cucamonga before joining the
Angels after the All-Star break.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andruw Jones and Johnny Damon won an Internet runoff for the final
two spots in next week's All-Star game.</LD>
<LD>   More than 750,000 voters cast about 3.1 million ballots from
Sunday night to Tuesday. American League Manager Joe Torre and
National League Manager Bob Brenly picked five players to compete for
the final spot.</LD>
<LD>   Jones, the Atlanta Braves' center fielder, beat out Pittsburgh's
Brian Giles by more than 70,000 votes. St. Louis' Albert Pujols was
third, followed by San Diego's Ryan Klesko and Colorado's Larry
Walker.</LD>
<TE>   Damon, the center fielder for the Boston Red Sox, beat out
Cleveland's Jim Thome by more than 26,000 votes. Oakland's Eric
Chavez was third, followed by Chicago's Magglio Ordonez and the
Angels' Darin Erstad.</TE>
<TE>   Damon's addition gives Boston six players on the All-Star roster,
tying Torre's Yankees and Brenly's Diamondbacks for the most. The Red
Sox have not had six All-Stars since 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez, who was selected by Torre, has
declined the invitation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brenly made some of his Diamondbacks players a little extra money
by picking them for the All-Star team.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Johnson, Curt Schilling, Luis Gonzalez and Damian Miller
each got $50,000 bonuses because Brenly chose them for the NL team
this week. Junior Spivey and Byung-Hyun Kim, the other Diamondbacks
selected by Brenly don't earn any extra money.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 37 of the 60 All-Stars will receive bonuses this year
ranging from $10,000 to $100,000, according to a survey. The total
bonus amount was $1,525,000.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest winners are Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants,
Alex Rodriguez of the Texas Rangers, Shawn Green of the Dodgers, and
Omar Vizquel of the Cleveland Indians, who will receive $100,000
each.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   About two dozen fans were treated for effects of the near-record
heat at Boston during the Red Sox's 2-1 victory over the Toronto Blue
Jays at Fenway Park. Temperatures in the city reached the mid-90s and
climbed to 104 degrees on the field during the first game of the
day-night doubleheader.</TE>
<TE>   Half of those needing fluids and cooling down were children, Foley
said, including some who had vomited from dehydration. About 10
people collapsed, but no one was hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Met reliever Mark Corey was cleared to resume pitching
after completing a series of neurological tests following his seizure
last week. Tests found no reason for the seizure and doctors said
they thought the pitcher had an anxiety attack.... John Henry
Williams, the son of baseball Hall of Famer Ted Williams, broke a rib
during a minor-league game and will be out five to six weeks.</TE>

<LD>Nick Canepa of the San Diego Union Tribune writes that Yao Ming, the
7-foot-5 Chinese basketball player chosen in the draft by the Houston
Rockets, already has done some popping off about Shaquille O'Neal.</LD>
<LD>   " 'He's a mountain in my way,' Yao says, taking Shaq a few steps
past a building. 'I will try to conquer it by all means.' ...</LD>
<LD>   "But it's not a good thing to anger Shaq. I'm thinking he doesn't
like to be called 'a mountain' by someone he hasn't met."</LD>
<TE>   And certainly not "it."</TE>

<TE>   Trivia time: When did Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak end?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Her hang-up: Jelena Dokic, 19, of Yugoslavia had a superstitious
routine at Wimbledon before she was eliminated Monday: She avoided
stepping on white lines. She blew on her right hand while waiting for
serves. She bounced the ball five times before her first serve and
twice before her second. And the ball boys and girls always had to
pass her the ball with an underarm throw.</TE>
<TE>   They won't miss her, for sure.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Won't work: David Letterman suggested his top 10 ways to get
Americans more interested in soccer. They include:</TE>
<TE>   * "Constitutional amendment stating if U.S. wins World Cup, every
American gets a brand new car."</TE>
<TE>   * "More players who look like Mia Hamm--fewer players who look
like Davor Vugrinec."</TE>
<TE>   * "Printed on every red card, a collectible 'Star Wars' photo."</TE>
<TE>   * "Instead of 'Goooooal!' have the announcer yell 'Yahtzee!' "</TE>
<TE>   * "Give Tiger Woods a soccer ball. America will never lose again."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another Yogi-ism: Sports publicist-broadcaster Irv Kaze, who died
Saturday, once told of having dinner with Yogi Berra. He said that
Berra ate his main course down to the last bite before asking what it
was.</TE>
<TE>   "Veal cutlet," Kaze told him.</TE>
<TE>   Berra pushed the plate away, saying, "I don't like veal cutlet."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Well, does he? Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "The
sports question people ask me most is, 'Can you get me tickets?'</TE>
<TE>   "But a close second is, 'Do you think Barry [Bonds] does
steroids?' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Out of it: Miami Dolphin Coach Dave Wannstedt has a one-track
mind.</TE>
<TE>   When he looked around his house recently, he told the Miami
Herald, he knew something was different, but he didn't know what.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he realized something had been added: a grand piano.</TE>
<TE>   "How long has that been there?" he asked his wife, Jan.</TE>
<TE>   Said she, "Two months."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oh, no! A minor league hockey team with an unforgettable nickname
is moving from Macon, Ga., to Lexington, Ky. No more Macon Whoopee.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: On July 17, 1941, at Cleveland's Municipal Stadium.
DiMaggio grounded out to third base twice, walked and bounced into a
double play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Ray Ratto of the San Francisco Chronicle on the feud
between Bonds and Jeff Kent: "They've hated each other since the day
Kent came to town in 1997. They hate each other today, and they'll
hate each other when they both join the feathered choir.</TE>
<TE>   "The one who lives longer will attend the other's funeral, just to
make sure he's dead."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Tennis's Most Wanted"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Floyd Conner</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Brassey's Inc.of Dulles, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $12.95</TE>
<TE>   King Louis X of France died after catching a bad chill when he
drank an urn of ice-cold water following a strenuous match in 1316.</TE>
<TE>   It could have been worse. In those days, tennis players were
sometimes killed when they were struck in the head with the hard
leather balls used at the time.</TE>
<TE>   These are the kind of intriguing stories Floyd Conner offers in
his book, "Tennis's Most Wanted: The Top 10 Book of Baseline
Blunders, Clay Court Wonders, and Lucky Lobs."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the well-documented "Battle of the Sexes," the numerous
tirades of John McEnroe, or the achievements of Chris Evert, who won
18 Grand Slam women's singles titles, there are hundreds of more
unfamiliar stories in the 70 sections of Top 10 lists in this
304-page paperback.</TE>
<TE>   After opening with an entertaining history of the game, which
includes King Louis' plight, and the fact that the modern game of
lawn tennis was invented in Britain in the 1870s, Conner delves into
more recent topics.</TE>
<TE>   There's the story of Renee Richards, who played in the 1955 U.S.
Open as a man and--after a sex-change operation--as a woman in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   There's tidbits such as this one: Pete Sampras owns a record 13
Grand Slam men's singles titles, but not one French Open title.</TE>
<TE>   And this one: Richard Williams--no, not that Richard Williams--won
U.S. singles titles in 1914 and 1916 after surviving the Titanic
disaster of 1912.</TE>
<TE>   Some Top 10 lists include "Teen Phenoms," "Marathon Matches,"
"Court Artists," "Classic Collapses," and "Love Matches," to name a
few.</TE>
<TE>   "Most Wanted" books are also available on the Olympics, golf,
football, baseball, and, soon to come, hockey.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Because they signed two Cuban players, the Dodgers were included in a
U.S. government list of 86 companies that were fined for violating an
international trade law, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday on
its Web site.</LD>
<LD>   In cases dating to 1998, the Dodgers were fined by the Treasury
Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control under the Trading With
the Enemy Act. Cuba is among the nations on the "enemies" list that
also includes Iran, Iraq and North Korea.</LD>
<LD>   The club reached a $75,000 settlement with OFAC in 1999 for
signing the Cubans, who were not identified in the story.</LD>
<TE>   "This is an issue between Major League Baseball as a whole and
Cuba and its players," said Derrick Hall, Dodger senior vice
president. "We dealt with the proper authorities, came to a
settlement and the case has been resolved."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were fined a reported $200,000 in June 1999 by Major
League Baseball for signing Juan Carlos Diaz and Josue Perez after
the team was accused of holding secret tryouts in Cuba and arranging
the players' defections.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were prohibited from re-signing Diaz and Perez, and
the players were declared free agents by the Commissioner's office.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Courtney, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, did not
identify the players in the Wall Street Journal report. He said the
players joined the Dodgers' organization in the Dominican Republic
and claimed to be citizens of that Caribbean nation.</TE>
<TE>   The OFAC list included 115 fines totaling $5.8 million, the Wall
Street Journal said. The list adds to information the agency
disclosed in March, but doesn't include all fines during the period.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Bowl Over Arizona</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Strong words between teams follow L.A.'s 8-0
victory, which extends its lead in National League West to 31/2
games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks turned the temperature up on an
already heated rivalry Tuesday night, scorching the desert with a
flurry of fighting words and angry insinuations after the Dodgers'
8-0 victory before 39,211 in Bank One Ballpark.</LD>
<LD>   Omar Daal (7-3) threw five shutout innings, reliever Giovanni
Carrara added three scoreless innings, and Paul Lo Duca, Cesar
Izturis and Eric Karros homered as the Dodgers shut out the
Diamondbacks for the second straight game and increased their lead in
the National League West to 3 1/2 games.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers (52-31) have won 11 of 14 games and have not allowed a
run in 24 consecutive innings, dating to the third inning of Sunday's
5-1 loss to the Angels. They are tied with Atlanta and Seattle for
the best record in baseball.</LD>
<TE>   But those details were secondary to the main event that unfolded
afterward, when Dodger Manager Jim Tracy took exception to a Rick
Helling pitch that hit Dodger third baseman Adrian Beltre in the back
and Helling, responding to an insinuation that he may have faked an
injury to avoid a fight, called Tracy "an idiot."</TE>
<TE>   At the root of the dispute was a sixth-inning collision at home
plate between Dodger outfielder Brian Jordan, a 6-foot-1, 220-pound
former NFL defensive back, and Helling, a 6-foot-3, 220-pounder who
played linebacker at the University of North Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   With a 1-0 Dodger lead, Jordan doubled to left, scoring Dave
Roberts from second and Karros from first. As Karros slid home, the
ball got by catcher Damian Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan headed for the plate, and Miller's throw to Helling at home
was in time. But Helling, who was blocking the plate, bobbled the
ball. Jordan flipped over Helling and had to reach underneath the
pitcher to find the plate, tagging it for a 4-0 lead before Helling
retrieved the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Helling drilled Beltre in the back with his next pitch, and
Beltre, believing the pitch was intentional, took several steps
toward the mound as both benches emptied. But Helling stumbled off
the mound in pain after the pitch--he suffered a sprained right ankle
in the collision with Jordan and aggravated it on the pitch to
Beltre.</TE>
<TE>   No fight ensued, and Helling left the game. As it turns out, the
teams were just getting warmed up.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me make something perfectly clear--we as a club are not
interested in starting any unnecessary activity," Tracy said. "Brian
Jordan was trying to score, the plate was blocked, [Helling] dropped
the ball and he was still trying to impede Jordan. But you are not
going to stop Brian Jordan from scoring on that play.</TE>
<TE>   "And then that next pitch ... I hope [Helling] did hurt himself.
Not to be nasty or anything, but if he didn't hurt himself on the
previous play, then it was unnecessary to hit Adrian Beltre in the
back. I hear he hurt his ankle. If he did turn his ankle, I can see
how a ball would get away from him and hit a guy in the back. But
we'll see how he is in five days."</TE>
<TE>   The insinuation was clear. If Helling makes his next start, Tracy
will question whether he really was hurt or if he was feigning injury
to avoid a bench-clearing brawl. When told of Tracy's remarks,
Helling fumed.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I put weight on the leg, I thought I broke it in
half," Helling said. "It was pretty obvious my leg gave out. I've
never missed a start in my major league career, and I'm the last
person to fake an injury. That's ridiculous.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved the contact at the plate. That was the first contact I've
had since college football, and I'm not afraid of it. If someone
wanted to charge the mound, I'd love it. I tell you what, I'll be
pitching five days from now. And if [Tracy] thinks I faked an injury
to avoid a fight, then he's an idiot."</TE>
<TE>   Beltre did not want to discuss the incident. "I don't want to say
anything I'll probably regret," he said. Jordan, who left the game in
the eighth inning because of a stiff back, thought it was a clean
play and didn't criticize Helling.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona Manager Bob Brenly thought Tracy overreacted.</TE>
<TE>   "Rick Helling is a tough guy, and after that collision, it was
apparent something was wrong with him," Brenly said. "He refused a
trainer, and on the next pitch he sprained his ankle. He thought his
leg was broken. Beltre didn't do anything. Why would we want to hit
him? I think [Tracy] read too much into that."</TE>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Shortstop Cesar Izturis began Tuesday night's game with a .234
average, third baseman Adrian Beltre was batting .240, and regular
second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, who did not start because of a mild
concussion, was hitting .245.</LD>
<LD>   Over one-third of the Dodger offense--not including the pitcher's
spot--has provided minimal production this season, and of the Dodger
regulars, only Shawn Green (.281, 25 homers, 63 runs batted in) is
having what might be considered a career year.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, the Dodgers were a whopping 20 games over .500 before the
game against Arizona and leading the National League West, a
testament to how good their pitching, most notably the rotation and
closer Eric Gagne, has been.</LD>
<TE>   Improved performances from the infielders would add some punch to
the offense, but Green doesn't believe the trio needs to morph into
Troy Glaus, Alex Rodriguez and Jose Vidro overnight for the Dodgers
to reach the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't take career years from everyone to win; it takes a
lineup where hardly anyone is hitting below .260 or .270, like
Arizona had last year," said Green, who returned to the lineup
Tuesday night after missing two games because of a jammed left thumb.
"There aren't too many easy outs in our lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, due to injuries and guys having down years for
whatever reason, we didn't have that balance. That's why we're
winning so many series this year--because we're consistent. I think
it's a lot more dangerous than a lineup with one or two boppers. You
can pitch around those guys and beat those teams."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dan Evans, Manager Jim Tracy and Dodger coaches
met Tuesday afternoon for an 82-game checkup, sort of a
state-of-the-team address that Evans also conducted after the
Dodgers' first 40 games and will do again at the 120-game mark and
after the 162-game season.</TE>
<TE>   Among the key subjects: How the Dodgers can strengthen themselves
before the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline. Evans is exploring
possible deals to improve the bullpen and the bench, but he won't
make any move he believes will disrupt team chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   "You always look to improve, but at the same time, I'm going to be
real careful to do things that make sense in the clubhouse, on the
field and for the future," Evans said. "Part of the reason we're
where we are today is clubhouse chemistry, and I'm not going to do
anything to screw that up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Veteran reliever Terry Mulholland said there "has been talk among
players" about setting a strike date at Monday's meeting of the Major
League Players Assn. executive board in Chicago, "but right now
that's our business, and some things you just don't discuss until the
time is right."</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland was scheduled to attend the meeting but changed his
mind when union chief Don Fehr told him he would be visiting the West
Coast soon after the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   "That meeting is going to be huge," said catcher Paul Lo Duca, the
Dodgers' player representative. "I'm hoping we can resolve something
because a lot of fans might not come back for a while [if there's a
strike]. I don't know what's going to happen. It's like a crapshoot."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Darren Dreifort, rehabilitating his surgically repaired elbow,
threw in the bullpen Tuesday and is scheduled to throw another live
batting-practice session Friday in St. Louis.... The Dodgers signed
Georgia high school pitcher Jonathan Broxton, a second-round pick in
the June draft, to a $685,000 bonus and have now reached agreement
with their top 10 selections in the draft.</TE>

<HD>Johnny Be Good Is Hot</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnny Be Good, a 4-year-old gelded son of Summing, has come a long
way in a short time.</LD>
<LD>   Claimed for $5,000 by owner-trainer Adan Farias a little more than
two months ago at Los Alamitos, Johnny Be Good has won three in a row
at three tracks.</LD>
<LD>   After beating $12,500 quarter horses at Los Alamitos, he rolled to
an easy win over thoroughbreds at Stockton, then came up with his
biggest win of all Sunday at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<TE>   On paper, Johnny Be Good looked overmatched in the 5 1/2-furlong
turf race for $50,000 claimers, but the California-bred certainly
proved he belonged. On the lead throughout under regular jockey Ramon
Guce, who collected his first win at Hollywood Park, Johnny Be Good
held off the 9-year-old win machine Fit For A King by a nose at 16-1.</TE>
<TE>   His win was the second of the day for a horse shipping from a
supposedly lesser circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Is It True Mex, who had earned all his victories in Northern
California, held off Diamant by a head to win the fifth, another turf
sprint, at 40-1 under apprentice Omar Figueroa.</TE>
<TE>   Those two surprises seemed to make a pick six carryover for today
a slam dunk, but one ticket was able to isolate all of the winners
and the payoff was a hefty $219,815.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Diamond Hope, second to Regiment in a stakes at
Lone Star Park on May 27, heads the field for the fifth race, a
$50,000 optional claimer at one mile on the turf. Nine others are
scheduled to go, including recent impressive maiden winners Rock Cod
Johnny and Stormed. Six Hitter and Dark Sorcerer also have to be
considered contenders.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Bobby Frankel. The trainer leads the standings at
Hollywood Park and has also won with eight of 19 starters at Belmont
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Armando Lage. The trainer began Pleasanton on an
0-for-21 streak, unusual for someone hitting at about a 17% clip for
the year.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Magnificent Max in the
second, using Harvest Girl, Run Rate and Whoopddoo in the third and
Lost In Paradise, Heaven's Treat and In Season in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/132. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $10.60/$756.40. Total money bet: $858.</TE>

<HD>Boucher Leaves for Dallas, $9.3 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philippe Boucher, an unrestricted free agent, bolted the Kings on
Tuesday, agreeing to a four-year, $9.3-million contract with the
Dallas Stars that will reunite him with former King assistant Dave
Tippett, the Stars' new coach.</LD>
<LD>   Tippett, signaling his interest in Boucher, phoned the defenseman
within minutes of Boucher becoming a free agent Sunday at midnight.</LD>
<LD>   Tippett's recruiting skills notwithstanding, however, it was Star
owner Tom Hicks' deep pockets that landed Boucher in Dallas, where he
will join a team that won five consecutive division titles before not
reaching the playoffs last season.</LD>
<TE>   The Stars, retooling for another run at the Stanley Cup, are also
bidding for high-end free-agent forwards Bill Guerin, Tony Amonte and
Teemu Selanne.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher, 29, turned down a three-year, $6-million offer from the
Kings, sources said. He was paid $582,038 last season, when he posted
seven goals and 30 points in 80 games, the best totals of his career.
The previous season, which Boucher spent mostly in the minors
recovering from foot injuries, he earned only about $110,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a weird day," Boucher, traded to the Kings in 1995, said
from Quebec City, his summer home. "You wait for that day for a long
time to be an unrestricted free agent and then you get mixed
emotions.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy to go to Dallas, but I'm obviously sad to leave L.A.
because I played there a long time. I had a good time in L.A.; I love
the guys and I loved the situation I was in ... and my family really
loves it there. It's really the only place my family really knew. But
once we realized the offers weren't really close....</TE>
<TE>   "Dallas is a team that really wants to win. I'm not saying L.A.
doesn't want to win but ... I didn't really fit into their budget. I
understand that."</TE>
<TE>   It's the second consecutive summer the Kings have lost their top
unrestricted free agent. Last July, Luc Robitialle signed with the
Detroit Red Wings.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we made a pretty good offer, so I'm disappointed that
he's gone," General Manager Dave Taylor said of Boucher. "Not a
terribly long ways apart in the two offers, but apparently a fourth
year in the deal to go to Dallas [was the difference]."</TE>
<TE>   Boucher's agent, Pat Brisson, said that 12 teams called about
Boucher on Monday and that, after hearing his terms, six continued to
show interest.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have offered unrestricted free-agent forward Kelly
Buchberger, 35, a one-year contract, Taylor said. He scored 13 points
in 74 games with the Kings last season.</TE>
<TE>   Mighty Duck defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski accepted a qualifying
offer from the team, which will pay him $1.075 million next season.
Vishnevski, 22, led the Ducks with 230 penalty minutes but was the
only Duck regular not to score a goal last season.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have seven more restricted free agents who played at
least 50 games last season, including left wing Paul Kariya, centers
Steve Rucchin and Matt Cullen, and defensemen Ruslan Salei and Pavel
Trnka. Cullen, who was second on the team with 48 points and scored a
career-high 18 goals, probably will go to arbitration. He earned
$484,000 last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks hired Charles Harris as director of off-ice publicity
and community relations.</TE>

<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the former Laker center, resigned Tuesday after
one season as coach of the Oklahoma Storm, which he guided to the
United States Basketball League championship.</LD>
<LD>   Abdul-Jabbar, a Hall of Famer, stepped down so he could seek
another coaching position in college or the NBA, USBL spokesman
Dennis Truax said.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first head coaching job at any level for Abdul-Jabbar,
the leading scorer in NBA history. He had been an assistant with the
Clippers.</LD>
<TE>   The USBL season ended Sunday with Oklahoma's 122-109 victory over
Kansas City in the championship game. The Storm had a 20-13 record.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great run this year and I am glad that I got the chance
to come to Enid and Oklahoma City," Abdul-Jabbar said after Sunday's
game.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul-Jabbar set nine NBA records, including most points (38,387).
He won six league championships, six most-valuable-player awards and
played in 18 All-Star games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia 76ers signed 6-foot-11 Greek center Efthimios
Rentzias, a former first-round draft pick who has played in the
Spanish League the last five seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The 76ers acquired the rights to the 25-year-old Rentzias from
Atlanta during last week's NBA draft, sending two future second-round
picks to the Hawks.</TE>
<TE>   Rentzias will attempt to join Jake Tsakalidis of the Phoenix Suns
and Antonis Fotsis of the Memphis Grizzlies as the only Greek players
in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Rentzias was selected by the Denver Nuggets with the 23rd overall
pick in the 1996 draft but didn't play in the NBA. Denver traded his
rights to Atlanta the following year. Rentzias averaged 9.2 points
and 3.5 rebounds in 51 games for Barcelona last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Missouri point guard Wesley Stokes said he plans to
transfer to San Diego State, becoming the third major-college player
to join the Aztecs this off-season.</TE>
<TE>   After he sits out the 2002-03 season, Stokes will have two years
of eligibility remaining. He averaged 5.8 points last season and led
the Tigers with 147 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Other players who have transferred to San Diego State during this
off-season are guard Travis Hanour from Arizona and center Chris
Manker from Oregon State.</TE>

<HD>More Minnesota Probation</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NCAA hit Minnesota with two more years of probation on Tuesday,
for rule-breaking in the women's basketball program, but spared the
school harsher penalties.</LD>
<LD>   The women's basketball team will forfeit a scholarship in each of
the two seasons, and recruiting will be trimmed back. The NCAA
declined to shut down the program for two seasons, which was a
possibility under the NCAA's repeat violator rule, and didn't ban the
Gophers from postseason play.</LD>
<LD>   Minnesota already was serving four years' probation for academic
cheating uncovered in the men's program in 1999. Tuesday's action
extends the probation until October 2006.</LD>
<TE>   New Coach Pam Borton, who took the job two months ago despite the
pending sanctions, said she was relieved that she no longer has to
reassure recruits nervous about the NCAA's so-called "death penalty."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm excited that this is over and that this is done," Borton
said. "We can move on."</TE>
<TE>   Former coach Cheryl Littlejohn was fired before last season after
a university investigation found she had given $200 to $300 to a
player, bought clothes for others and encouraged players to lie to
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's announcement cited several other violations by
Littlejohn, including arranging free housing for recruits in 1998 and
arranging for student managers and assistants to oversee improper
workouts in 1998 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Littlejohn, whose teams were 29-81 in four years, also was hit in
Tuesday's announcement. She is banned from participating in
off-campus recruiting from July 8-Nov. 20 at Chicago State, where she
now coaches. She's also not allowed to take part in the first seven
days of practice this season.</TE>
<TE>   Track and Field</TE>
<TE>   Marion Jones won the 100 meters for a fifth consecutive victory,
and Gail Devers overcame a clumsy start to set a stadium record in
the 100 hurdles in the Athletissima track meet at Lausanne,
Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Jones clocked 11.05 seconds to beat Tayna Lawrence of Jamaica by
.09. Jones will race next in Paris on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The 35-year-old Devers, unbeaten this season in the event, won in
12.40 seconds, shaving off 0.11 from the season's previous best time
she set June 23 at Stanford. She also bettered the Pontaise track
record she set two years ago by .10 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Francis Obikwelu, a Nigerian who now races for Portugal, won the
men's 100 in 10.10. After Olympic and world champion Maurice Greene
and Ato Boldon withdrew from the meet citing fatigue, Obikwelu beat
Americans Tim Montgomery, Bernard Williams and Joshua Johnson.</TE>

<TE>   Fresno State wide receiver Rodney Wright, a seventh-round draft

and caused it to hit a post and burst into flames.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado State's Frostee Rucker, accused of sexually assaulting
another student has pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of harassment.
Rucker, from Tustin High, was ordered to serve a one-year deferred

$24-million contract with the Red Wings to replace Dominik Hasek, who
has retired.</LD>
<LD>   Jumping at a chance to join the defending Stanley Cup champions,
Joseph, an unrestricted free agent, turned down more money and the
chance to return to the Toronto Maple Leafs, who offered him a
three-year, $26.5-million deal.</LD>
<TE>   "Probably a year ago I couldn't have seen myself playing anywhere
else," said Joseph, who has an option for a fourth year with the Red
Wings. "But Detroit offers a very unique opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody who plays there says the future is now. That was
enticing."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph's signing was part of a busy day in the NHL. Toronto did
not spend much time waiting to execute Plan B, signing veteran goalie
Ed Belfour to an incentive-laden two-year, $13.5-million contract two
hours after Joseph's signing.</TE>
<TE>   Although Belfour, 37, is coming off a disappointing,
injury-plagued season with the Dallas Stars, Toronto Coach Pat Quinn
had his eyes on him since the Salt Lake City Olympics in February.
Belfour didn't play a minute, but Quinn was impressed with how he
handled himself in his role as No. 3 goalie behind Martin Brodeur and
Joseph for Team Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "[Canada assistant and former Dallas Coach Ken] Hitchcock spoke
particularly highly of his goaltender, as a competitor, as a guy that
in the big games he was the guy that he wanted in the net," Quinn
said. "And, in fact, he ranked him ahead of the other two guys
[Brodeur and Joseph], quite frankly."</TE>
<TE>   Toronto chose Belfour, a two-time Vezina Trophy winner, over
another unrestricted free agent, Byron Dafoe, because of his winning
track record. Quinn said Belfour's history of back injuries and his
.895 save percentage, 29th among No. 1 goalies in the 30-team NHL
last season, was not a factor.</TE>
<TE>   "I've admired his competitive instincts, watched him win a Cup and
watched him outduel other goaltenders in playoff time," Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   In other news, the New York Rangers outbid Toronto to sign their
second big-name free agent in two days, picking up defenseman Darius
Kasparaitis. Center Bobby Holik signed with the Rangers on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Kasparaitis will rejoin New York Coach Bryan Trottier, who was an
assistant in Colorado and Pittsburgh when Kasparaitis played for
those teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Calgary Flames made its first free-agent signing of the summer
when they landed veteran forward Martin Gelinas, whose overtime goal
put the Carolina Hurricanes into the Stanley Cup finals. Gelinas had
seven points in 23 playoff games for Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest signing was Joseph.</TE>
<TE>   Although there were reports that the Toronto native wanted to
leave the Maple Leafs because of a clash with Quinn, Joseph said that
was not the case.</TE>
<TE>   "No animosity at all," Joseph said of Quinn, who replaced him as
the starting goaltender for Canada after an opening-round loss to
Sweden at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I refer to an analogy, that if I was 22, when I first
started, and you said: 'At 35 you haven't won a Stanley Cup and you
can go to a team that is the odds-on favorite. What would you do?'
There's no guarantees that I'll go to Detroit and win the Stanley
Cup. But I'm willing to take that opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   At 35, Joseph gives the Red Wings another aging, high-priced
All-Star goalie. Hasek, 37, led the Red Wings to their third NHL
championship in six years before he decided to return home to the
Czech Republic.</TE>
<TE>   "He's similar to Dom in the way he can make that save when you
think the other team can score," Detroit defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom
said. "His reactions are so fast, especially on the shots in close. I
think he's really capable of playing good with a good team.</TE>
<TE>   "I think maybe in Toronto, he and [captain Mats] Sundin were the
two big players with all the focus on them. With us, he'll have other
guys to take the pressure off him."</TE>
<TE>   Joseph, who compiled a 133-88-27 record and a 2.42 goals-against
average in four seasons with Toronto, earned $6.57 million last
season, which was the last of a four-year, $24-million deal. He broke
his hand last season but went 29-17-5 with a career-best 2.23 GAA and
a .906 save percentage in 51 games.</TE>
<TE>   He had a 2.30 GAA and a .914 save percentage in 20 playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   The Maple Leafs were eliminated in the Eastern Conference finals
by Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph became an unrestricted free agent after failing to reach a
deal Sunday with the Maple Leafs, who then traded his rights to
Calgary for a 2004 eighth-round draft pick.</TE>

<HD>Colon's Debut Gets Rave Reviews</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bartolo Colon wasn't too impressed with his first start for the
Montreal Expos, but his performance left his new teammates gushing.</LD>
<LD>   Colon won in his first start since coming over from Cleveland, and
Fernando Tatis hit a go-ahead grand slam as the Expos beat the
Atlanta Braves, 5-2, Tuesday night at Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Barrett also homered for second-place Montreal, which
pulled within eight games of the Braves in the National League East.
Atlanta lost for just the second time in 13 games.</LD>
<TE>   The Indians sent Colon, pitcher Tim Drew and cash to the Expos
last week for first baseman Lee Stevens and three minor leaguers. In
16 starts with Cleveland, Colon was 10-4 with a 2.55 earned-run
average and won his last three starts.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't miss a beat in his first appearance ever against
Atlanta. Colon gave up two runs in the first--one earned--and then
held the Braves scoreless over his final six innings.</TE>
<TE>   The big right-hander appeared to get stronger as the game wore on,
throwing a 98-mph fastball in the seventh inning on his 97th pitch.
He gave up only five hits and struck out six.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the most impressive pitcher I've ever caught," Barrett said.
"I know that's going to make some of my boys jealous. I was trying
really hard not to smile too much back there. I was so happy."</TE>
<TE>   The Expos got off to a rocky start for their new pitcher,
committing two errors in the first. Rafael Furcal led off with a
triple and scored when Vladimir Guerrero misplayed a fly ball by
Julio Franco into a three-base error.</TE>
<TE>   Franco came home when Gary Sheffield reached on a throwing error
by shortstop Orlando Cabrera, giving the Braves a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "He got a few bad breaks in the first inning, but he shut them
down and didn't give them anything else," Montreal Manager Frank
Robinson said. "He comes right at you. He doesn't let up."</TE>
<TE>   Houston 6, Cincinnati 5--Lance Berkman homered on his first two
swings, driving in five runs, and Gregg Zaun hit a 10th-inning
sacrifice fly for the Astros at Cincinnati. Berkman's two homers put
the Astros up, 5-1, in the third, but Austin Kearns had four hits,
the most in his career, and Adam Dunn hit a solo homer as the Reds
tied the score at 5 in the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Biggio led off the 10th with a double off Danny Graves (3-2)
and Berkman was intentionally walked. After Richard Hidalgo drew a
one-out walk that loaded the bases, Zaun hit a sacrifice fly to left
field.</TE>
<TE>   New York 12, Philadelphia 6--Jeromy Burnitz had three runs batted
in, Mo Vaughn had two RBIs and Pedro Astacio (8-3) won for just the
second time since May 14 for the Mets at Philadelphia. The Mets, who
had lost four of five, moved back to .500 at 41-41.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Rolen had a two-run double and two-run homer for
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 9, Chicago 7--Cliff Floyd had three hits, including a
go-ahead home run in the fifth inning, for the Marlins at Miami.
Sammy Sosa hit his 28th homer for the Cubs, who have lost seven of
eight. Florida's Brad Penny, making his first start since May 18,
came off the disabled list and gave up five runs. Chicago's Tom
Gordon made his first appearance for the Cubs since Sept. 5.,
striking out two in one inning.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 11, San Diego 5--Placido Polanco, Jim Edmonds and Albert
Pujols homered on consecutive at-bats in the second and Polanco
finished with three RBIs to help the Cardinals win at St. Louis and
take a one-game lead in the NL Central over Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 12, Pittsburgh 6--Ruben Quevedo limited the Pirates to
three runs in 6 2/3 innings and also drove in three runs at
Pittsburgh.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A record 62 home runs were hit in the major leagues Tuesday night,
breaking the mark of 57 set April 7, 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Jay Gibbons' second homer of the game for Baltimore against the
Angels' Scott Schoeneweis broke the record.</LD>
<LD>   The hitters didn't stop after that.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers' Eric Karros connected against Arizona's Greg
Swindell, Oakland's Olmedo Saenz hit a game-winning two-run shot
against Minnesota's Eddie Guardado, and Kansas City's Mike Sweeney
and Raul Ibanez homered against Seattle's Kazuhiro Sasaki.</TE>
<TE>   Ibanez's homer was his second of the day, making him a record
ninth player to hit at least two in a game Tuesday. The previous mark
was eight, on May 19, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   There were 30 homers hit in the American League, topped by a
record-tying 12 in Chicago's 17-9 victory over Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco and Colorado combined for 10 of the 32 homers in the
NL in the Giants' 18-5 victory at Coors Field.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco's Damon Minor, Tsuyoshi Shinjo and Reggie Sanders
each homered twice, and the Giants became the 16th team to have three
players with multiple homers in a game. Barry Bonds, who set the
major league record with 73 last season, didn't hit any.</TE>
<TE>   Magglio Ordonez and Sandy Alomar of the Chicago White Sox,
Detroit's Dmitri Young, Houston's Lance Berkman also homered twice.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Sosa hit his major league-leading 28th homer for the Chicago
Cubs, one more than Berkman.</TE>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The San Francisco Giants had a record-setting night for
homers--without getting any from Barry Bonds.</LD>
<LD>   Damon Minor, Tsuyoshi Shinjo and Reggie Sanders each homered twice
to tie a major league record as the San Francisco Giants routed the
Colorado Rockies, 18-5, Tuesday at Coors Field.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants became the 16th team to have three players with
multiple homers in a game. Their seven homers was the most since
hitting a club-record eight against Milwaukee on April 30, 1961.</LD>
<TE>   Minnesota was the last team with three players to have at least
two homers in a game, on July 12, 2001, against Milwaukee. The 10
combined home runs between the two teams tied a Coors Field record,
which had happened four other times.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco had 23 hits and seven homers--two in an eight-run
first inning--for its fifth win in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Minor was four for six and had two-run homers in the second and
fourth. Shinjo had a career-high five hits after going hitless in 17
at-bats. He hit his second career grand slam off Denny Neagle (4-6)
in the first and hit a solo shot in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "We got taken to the shed, taken to the wood shed," Colorado
Manager Clint Hurdle said. "We couldn't get outs. It was not a good
outing."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco sent 13 hitters to the plate in the first inning.</TE>

<HD>Pitts Becomes Quite the Party Crasher</HD>
<DH>Pro football: San Diego State star, with no high school
experience, has key role with Texans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The accolades earned by most of the players selected in this year's
NFL draft began piling up when they were in high school: "Four-year
starting quarterback" ... "All-American linebacker" ... "Star running
back in the state championship game."</LD>
<LD>   And then there was Chester Pitts of San Diego State, a
second-round selection by the expansion Houston Texans.</LD>
<LD>   "Lettered on the track team and was an All-Prep League selection
in the shotput and discus," read the two-line entry recapping his
high school athletic accomplishments. "Also holds the school record
in each event."</LD>
<TE>   Nothing about football, and for good reason. Pitts is the only one
among the 261 players taken who did not play high school football.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew what we were getting," said Tony Marciano, Houston's
offensive line coach.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew his background. He's a big, intelligent person with good
speed and, bottom line, they're hard to find."</TE>
<TE>   Pitts, a 6-foot-4, 320-pound offensive tackle, grew up in Carson
and attended California Academy of Math and Science, a small, Long
Beach Unified School District magnet school on the campus of Cal
State Dominguez Hills.</TE>
<TE>   CAMS doesn't field a football team.</TE>
<TE>   Pitts was attending San Diego State and working part-time at a
grocery store to help support his 18-month-old daughter when he met
Mike Milano and Kyle Turley, both Aztec offensive linemen.</TE>
<TE>   Pitts recalls half-heartedly bragging that he was considering
trying out for the team. Milano and Turley, now the left tackle for
the New Orleans Saints, encouraged him to approach the coaching
staff--which Pitts did the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   "[The coaches] didn't know me from Adam, but they liked my size
and they said, 'We'll give you a shot,' " Pitts said. "That's how it
got started."</TE>
<TE>   Pitts was out of shape when he arrived for his first off-season
practice in February 1998. He told the coaches he wanted to play
tight end, a position typically filled by far quicker athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Convinced that he wouldn't return after his first workout, the
coaches didn't even bother repositioning him.</TE>
<TE>   "He had this glazed look in his eye, like he was saying, 'What is
this?' " Aztec line coach Damon Baldwin recalled. "We were all
chuckling, saying, 'Here's another kid who thinks he can play because
he's big.' "</TE>
<TE>   Pitts remembers that morning--at least parts of it--as if it
happened yesterday. "I'd never been so tired in my life," he said. "I
sat on the stadium steps and fell asleep for 45 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   But Pitts returned to practice the next day. And the next, and the
next, showing the determination he learned from his mother, LaVerne,
who'd worked so diligently to get him into CAMS.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a quitter," he said. "That's what everyone expected me to
do [after the first day of practice]. I swore up and down I wasn't
going to quit and that was all the drive I needed."</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin needed extra linemen that spring, so he put Pitts on the
scout team, where he held a blocking bag and kept the team loose with
his sense of humor and positive attitude. Baldwin eventually let
Pitts onto the field for the final play of the last scrimmage before
the season began.</TE>
<TE>   "I stood right behind his butt and told him who to block," Baldwin
said. "The guys were clapping and cheering, saying, 'Hey, Chester
finally got in.' "</TE>
<TE>   During the first season, Baldwin couldn't help but notice Pitts'
quick feet and agility during drills. That was enough to get Pitts
onto the traveling squad the next season, where he lined up for about
35 plays. During a September blowout victory at Kansas, he replaced
an injured player in the second quarter and caught the attention of
coaches during his 15 plays as a substitute.</TE>
<TE>   "He showed us some things that game," Baldwin said. "That's what
led into his junior and senior years."</TE>
<TE>   Pitts earned the starting job at tackle his junior season, then
earned All-Mountain West Conference honors as a senior. He didn't
allow a sack and had 108 knockdowns in 762 plays last season. After a
27-12 loss at Ohio State in mid-October, Pitts started to believe he
had the ability to play at the next level.</TE>
<TE>   "I needed to show I could rise up for the big-time game," he said.
"And I had my best game of the year against Ohio State."</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin's favorite play last season was a screen pass against
Utah. Pitts swung outside, steam-rollered the cornerback, stayed on
his feet and ran alongside the wide receiver for about 20 yards. He
then knocked the free safety off his feet and pushed a pile of
defenders trying to make the tackle an additional 10 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin made sure that clip was the first in Pitts' portfolio,
which was growing in demand each week. "The scouts liked his
athleticism," Baldwin said. "And they thought he had great upside
because he showed so much improvement in such a short amount of
time."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Pitts' name didn't appear in many mock drafts. Scouts said
that was because he'd played poorly in the Senior Bowl in January.
What some might not have known, however, was that two months earlier,
Pitts had undergone surgery to remove torn cartilage in his left
knee, an injury he'd played with all season.</TE>
<TE>   The Texans took him 50th overall, making him the seventh offensive
tackle selected. And they haven't been disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "We were impressed with Chester throughout [a mini-camp],"
Marciano said. "He picked up the offense fairly well and fairly
quickly. We knew he would because he's an intelligent player.
Physically, he handled himself well. We like his athleticism, his
size and versatility."</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence is expected of a CAMS graduate, but showing it as a
professional athlete is not.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Maldonado, who graduated from high school with Pitts and is
studying neuroscience at UCLA, remembers sitting in the back of class
with Pitts, cracking jokes and having a good time, but all the while
wondering what Pitts was doing at a school like CAMS.</TE>
<TE>   "I would ask him what he was doing there and not at a high school
with a football team," Maldonado said. "A guy [as big] as him looked
completely out of place, but he had his priorities straight. He
wanted to get a good education."</TE>
<TE>   Neither of Pitts' younger brothers, Devin and Ryan, followed him
to CAMS, nor did his younger sister, Julia. Devin was a star football
player at North Torrance High and will be a junior wide receiver at
USC. Julia was a three-sport star at North Torrance and recently
signed to play basketball at UCLA. Ryan is a sophomore at El Camino
College and runs on the track team.</TE>
<TE>   Pitts said the long, grinding process of getting him into CAMS,
coupled with his subtle complaints about the lack of a football team,
led LaVerne to enroll her children in more sports-oriented public
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I made their lives so much easier," Pitts said. "I took all the
body shots."</TE>
<TE>   Pitts will join an already talented Houston line that includes
former USC All-American Tony Boselli. Early indications have Pitts
moving inside to guard, where he'll have less ground to cover but
stiffer contact from blitzing linebackers and bull-rushing linemen.</TE>
<TE>   Pitts said he would be glad to change positions if it means
getting more playing time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extremely difficult to go from college to playing left
tackle in the NFL," Pitts said. "You're on an island all alone. One
slip up and the franchise quarterback's out for the season."</TE>

<HD>Little Pro, Big Shadow</HD>
<DH>Eddie Merrins has been asked to take a different role at
Bel-Air Country Club, a development that makes many members mad</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the wall of the checker-carpeted cubbyhole that houses Bel-Air's
rarest treasure, there hangs a cartoon.</LD>
<LD>   It is of a golfer wearing glasses, a cap, a tie, a glove and
spikes while holding a driver.</LD>
<LD>   The golfer has everything but a body. The clothing and equipment
seemingly float in mid-air. The golfer is a ghost.</LD>
<TE>   The cartoon was drawn for Eddie Merrins, the giant Little Pro, and
anybody who has felt his gentle touch understands why.</TE>
<TE>   For 40 years at the Bel-Air Country Club, Merrins has been the
quiet, dignified teacher of golfers not only rich and famous, but
those who long to be.</TE>
<TE>   Giving lessons to everyone from Fred Astaire and Arnold Palmer to
Annie In The Beverage Cart, Merrins has established himself as a
5-foot-7 city landmark and one of the most beloved club pros in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   The cartoon, penned by a friend, was meant to serve as a logo.</TE>
<TE>   But next month, to the amazement of many, it will become a
portrait.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Merrins, on his 70th birthday Aug. 4, will disappear from
the office as Bel-Air's golf pro, being moved to who-knows-where,
being given an "Emeritus" title that means who-knows-what.</TE>
<TE>   "Emeritus," says Merrins, chuckling, his soft Mississippi accent
rising. "I'll gladly do whatever the club wants me to do, so I'll
have to get out my Thorndike for that one."</TE>
<TE>   After 40 years, Merrins is being put out to teaching pasture to
make room for a younger pro, a move that has stirred deep pockets of
outrage among a 540-person membership that pays dearly for tradition.</TE>
<TE>   He will continue to give lessons but will be forced to move out of
his office and give up the daily control that has allowed him to help
shape Bel-Air into one of the nation's most respected clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a terrible situation," said Ed Steidle, longtime member.
"In my opinion, they have treated him very badly."</TE>
<TE>   In the genteel confines of a club renowned for its politeness
almost as much as its discretion, there have been mumblings at
cloth-napkined lunches, discussions on manicured fairways, creating a
buzz that has spilled on to the surrounding starry streets.</TE>
<TE>   After one Hollywood event, an actor member walked up to another
member and announced, "They can't do this. Eddie is Bel-Air!"</TE>
<TE>   Against Merrin's wishes, and without his knowledge, members are
circulating a petition to have him reinstated.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing has taken on a life of its own," said Richard Crane,
another longtime member who also serves as Merrins' attorney.</TE>
<TE>   It's about a life that was once thought to be immune to age, a
golfing world that is sadly changing as fast as Augusta boss Hootie
Johnson was able to ship those you're-too-old-for-the-Masters letters
this spring to three elderly former champions.</TE>
<TE>   But it's also about the life of a club whose changing membership
is trying to brace for the future while still respecting the past.</TE>
<TE>   "The Little Pro represents all that is great about this game,
that's why we want him around forever," said Anthony Chidoni,
president of Bel-Air. "But there were some who thought the timing was
right to put him on emeritus now so he can work with the new pro."</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, though, this is about the life of a gentleman golfer so
braced in decorum, he still gives lessons in a coat and tie, he has
still never cursed in public, and he still attends daily morning
Mass.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to make a big deal out of this," Merrins said last
week, looking around at a lifetime of photos and awards that will
soon be dumped into boxes. "The club is a special place, and I would
never do anything to tarnish that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The first thing you need to know about Eddie Merrins is that he
once gave a golf lesson at a wedding.</TE>
<TE>   Standing at the altar, with the bride having just entered the
church, Merrins was nudged by a fellow groomsman.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he was having the dreaded balance problem," Merrins
recalled. "What was I supposed to do?"</TE>
<TE>   Of course. Anyone in that situation would have, as Merrins did,
stick out his hands and bounce on his feet and explain balance just
as the bride was wobbling up the aisle.</TE>
<TE>   Merrins has given a golf lesson in an airport with an umbrella,
and a golf lesson in an airplane above the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "Right outside the bathroom," his wife, Lisa, recalled with a
sigh.</TE>
<TE>   He has given golf lessons during El Nino (he was wet for two
months), during an earthquake ("We played through") and even at
night.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to see to play golf," he said. "You play golf by
feel."</TE>
<TE>   As if proving that theory, he has given lessons to blind
entertainer Tom Sullivan, and to foreign prodigies who don't
understand one word he is speaking.</TE>
<TE>   Merrins once gave a lesson to Alvin Dark in foul territory before
a baseball game, and this year gave lessons to marshals standing
inside the ropes at the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   This spring Merrins was even in Augusta, Ga., giving a lesson to
Arnold Palmer on the practice tee moments before Palmer began his
final Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Yep, Palmer went directly from the Little Pro to last place,
shooting a first-round 89 before announcing his retirement from the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "If he wants to blame that 89 on me, I'll take full credit,"
Merrins said.</TE>
<TE>   Merrins once gave a lesson to a 5-year-old, shortly after giving a
lesson to a 90-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   This kid from Meridian, Miss., who began playing with borrowed
clubs and was given his diminutive nickname by fellow touring pros in
the late 1950s, has never forgotten that golf is a sport for
everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "The man is like a father figure to me," said Andy Schaefer.</TE>
<TE>   Pro? Captain of industry? Rich Hollywood guy?</TE>
<TE>   Bel-Air caddymaster.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The second thing you need to know about Eddie Merrins is that he
understands slices and hooks and shanks.</TE>
<TE>   Because he understands failure.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, at 18, he beat Gay Brewer to win the national junior
championship and figured he was headed for a long career.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in the NCAA finals for Louisiana State two years later, he was
leading with four holes to play and lost.</TE>
<TE>   And in the Beaumont Open in Texas nine years later, his first
attempt at becoming a tour regular after several teaching stints, he
was leading with nine holes remaining and finished fourth.</TE>
<TE>   In 200 ensuing PGA tour events, Eddie Merrins never finished
higher than that fourth place.</TE>
<TE>   Yet his teaching has produced many championships because he has
apparently understood why.</TE>
<TE>   Simplicity. Basics. Touch.</TE>
<TE>   The likes of Greg Norman and Fred Couples have spoken as if
Merrins doesn't share wisdom about golf as much as he shares himself.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, it's all about your ability to give," Merrins said.
"Being a pro golfer, you only care about yourself. It seemed like a
selfish existence to me. I wanted to do more."</TE>
<TE>   When there was an opening at Bel-Air in 1962, and officials heard
about this calm southerner with a resume that included a stint at
Philadelphia's prestigious Merion Golf Club, Merrins was hired.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his posh surroundings, the simple approach never changed.
It is no coincidence that two of his most famous students were once
public-course hackers who set the mark for mental toughness.</TE>
<TE>   The only guy to have stared down Tiger Woods in a major
championship?</TE>
<TE>   A Merrins student by the name of Bob May, a kid who used to drive
up from Orange County every Sunday for lessons.</TE>
<TE>   May would calmly toss a ball in his hand while waiting to tee off
during his playoff loss to Woods in the 2000 PGA Championships.
Indeed, Merrins taught him that as a sort of hypnosis.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in his little office that August Sunday, watching May
compete in the finals, Merrins wept.</TE>
<TE>   And the only caddie from East Los Angeles to ever compete in the
Masters?</TE>
<TE>   Another Merrins student by the name of Greg Puga, a Bel-Air caddie
whom Merrins nurtured while he was becoming good enough to win the
amateur tournament that guaranteed him a berth.</TE>
<TE>   Sort of like the caddie whom Merrins supported while he lived in
his car. Or the penniless caddie named Lloyd whom Merrins used as his
personal bag-carrier.</TE>
<TE>   "Eddie is very protective of the caddies," said caddiemaster
Schaefer. "He makes it like a family around here."</TE>
<TE>   A diverse family, for sure.</TE>
<TE>   He has taught basketball stars (Jerry West), baseball stars (Tommy
John) and football stars (Jerry Rice).</TE>
<TE>   He has taught numerous Hollywood stars, of course, everyone from
James Woods to Robert Goulet to Craig T. Nelson.</TE>
<TE>   And, yes, he has taught a Ringo Starr.</TE>
<TE>   "Eddie!" said Starr during their memorable lesson, grabbing his
tie in the middle of a 90-degree afternoon. "You've got to lighten up
a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The third and final thing you need to know about Eddie Merrins is
that he hates this fuss.</TE>
<TE>   He was informed of his demotion a year ago. He said nothing.</TE>
<TE>   The members received a letter about the demotion this May. They
were upset. He still said little.</TE>
<TE>   Reportedly, the board of directors voted, 5-4, to change his job
status for reasons that involve both age and compatibility.</TE>
<TE>   "I want Eddie to stay forever," said Jim Mahoney, a member who
joined the club the same year Merrins arrived. "But this is a normal
and natural thing that will happen. Sooner or later, we're all going
to have to back off a bit."</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, however, Merrins is healthy and active and has
slowed little. A cynic might say that the only thing foggy is the
perspective of those younger members who want him to reduce his load.</TE>
<TE>   They weren't there, perhaps, when Merrins brought Jack Nicklaus to
the club and introduced him to a teenaged Tiger Woods.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't see how he became so close to such a wide variety of
patrons, he was a pallbearer at the funerals for Ray Bolger and Jim
Murray.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't see him win a national golf championship as UCLA's
coach in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   And they had no idea that, for daily exercise, he used to walk
around the UCLA track with John Wooden, two teachers talking about
teaching.</TE>
<TE>   Universally, it seems, everyone at Bel-Air loves Eddie Merrins.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone there seems to believe that, in the eternal sport
of golf, his message of yesterday can still work today.</TE>
<TE>   Because nearly everyone in the business knows the Little Pro, his
phone calls can still land the members a tee time at nearly any
course in the world.</TE>
<TE>   His new video series, "Swing The Handle," is selling worldwide
from www.swingthehandle.com.</TE>
<TE>   Spend a day with him, and count the number of phone calls he
receives from all over the country, desperate golfers looking for
help.</TE>
<TE>   Forty years later, 70 years old, the coat is still on, the tie is
still tight.</TE>
<TE>   "For those of us for whom golf is a meaningful part of our life,
Eddie has added to every single fact of that life," said John Marin,
another longtime member. "You can be anywhere in the world and
they'll ask, 'Do you know the Little Pro?' His impact on Bel Air is
immeasurable."</TE>
<TE>   That said ...</TE>
<TE>   "This is as good of a circumstance as could possibly be for
everyone," Marin said. "Everybody wins."</TE>
<TE>   Although it's Merrins who is losing his old office, his old job,
his old salary.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I've had a lot of anxious moments about this," Eddie Merrins
allowed recently, lowering his voice as if not to insult even the
club furniture. "It's like walking across a darkened room. I'm not
really sure what I'll stumble over."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever it is, the Little Pro will no doubt apologize, then
softly play through.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two days after the end of the World Cup, the sound of slamming doors
is reverberating throughout the soccer world as one coach after
another is shown the way out.</LD>
<LD>   In the 48 hours after Brazil's victory over Germany on Sunday,
Saudi Arabia fired its coach, Spain's coach stepped down and the
president of the French soccer federation stated flatly that France's
coach will get his pink slip later this week.</LD>
<LD>   Saudi Arabia's Nasser al Johar was the first to fall. Under his
charge, the Saudis lost their three World Cup games--the most
humiliating an 8-0 drubbing by Germany--and failed to score a goal.</LD>
<TE>   All the same, Prince Nawaf bin Faysal ben Abdul Aziz, head of the
Saudi delegation at the World Cup, vowed only one month ago that Al
Johar would keep his job come what may.</TE>
<TE>   Al Johar did not help his cause, however, when he said that
"people in Saudi Arabia should lower their expectations" concerning
the national team. But the Saudi soccer federation also shares some
responsibility. It has appointed and fired six coaches since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Prince Sultan bin Fahd, head of the federation, said five foreign
candidates are being considered for Al Johar's position. One of them
might be Brazil's World Cup-winning coach, Luiz Felipe Scolari, who
has said he would like to coach a foreign team--in other words, one
that can pay very handsomely, and the Saudis fit that bill.</TE>
<TE>   Spain, meanwhile, is looking for its first new coach in four years
after Jose Antonio Camacho on Tuesday said he had had enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I did my job and now I am leaving," Camacho said at a news
conference in Madrid. "I believe the national team is not dependent
on the coach. All I think it needs is that little bit of luck that we
have been missing in the past."</TE>
<TE>   It was certainly missing at Korea/Japan '02, where a patently
incorrect call by a linesman denied Spain a goal against South Korea
and cost Camacho's team a place in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   "Life is made up of stages and this one is finished for me," he
said. "The Euro 2004 [championship in Portugal] is two years away and
the next World Cup another two. I need more [immediate] challenges."</TE>
<TE>   Camacho finished with a 28-7-9 record as Spain's coach, leading it
to the quarterfinals of Euro 2000 and the quarterfinals of the World
Cup.</TE>
<TE>   In France, Roger Lemerre's days as coach appear to be dwindling
down to a not-so-precious few in the wake of the 1998 world
champion's first-round ouster from the Cup. He has refused to resign
and might be forced out.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any other solution [but to change coaches]," Claude
Simonet, president of the French Football Federation (FFF), told
France Football magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The FFF will meet Friday to resolve Lemerre's fate. His contract
runs through 2004, but already several names have surfaced as
potential replacements.</TE>
<TE>   One is Philippe Troussier, who took co-host Japan to the final 16
of the World Cup before stepping down. Another is former national
team midfielder Alain Giresse, now coaching in Morocco.</TE>
<TE>   France starts its Euro 2004 qualifying campaign in September, and
Simonet said a new coach will be in place this month.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, too, is casting around for a replacement for Oleg
Romantsev, who resigned after Russia failed to advance to the second
round.</TE>
<TE>   A newspaper survey in Moscow over the weekend showed that 79.6% of
14,000 Russians polled said they wanted to see a foreign coach take
over the national team. The top three "people's choices" were Dino
Zoff, Italy's 1982 World Cup-winning goalkeeper; former AC Milan
coach Alberto Zaccheroni, and Richard Moller Nielsen, who coached
Denmark to its Euro '92 title and recently resigned as Israel's
coach.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil Homecoming</TE>
<TE>   Almost a half-million people turned out on the streets of the
Brazilian capital of Brasilia to honor Ronaldo and the rest of
Brazil's World Cup winners when the team returned home.</TE>
<TE>   The party was not confined to the ground. Overhead, Air Force
planes spelled out the words "Five-Time Champion" in white smoke.</TE>
<TE>   At the presidential palace, Scolari, the coach, and his players
were embraced individually by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
and each was presented with the National Medal of Honor.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn Wins Golden Ball</TE>
<TE>   Germany goalkeeper Oliver Kahn has won the Golden Ball as the
outstanding player at the 2002 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn received 25% of the votes cast by the World Cup media and
Ronaldo received 21%. Much of the voting was done before Sunday's
final.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo, who won the Golden Ball in 1998, received the Silver Ball
and South Korea defender Hong Myung-Bo (18%) received the Bronze
Ball.</TE>

<LD>Spain, a 5-year-old mare who earned a record $3.5 million, most
recently sharing purses after a win and a third-place finish while in
foal, has been retired. Prince Ahmed bin Salman's Thoroughbred Corp.,
the breeder and owner of Spain, said she has been sent to Three
Chimneys Farm in Midway, Ky., where she is due to deliver a foal next
April.</LD>
<LD>   Spain finished with $3,540,542 in purses, winning nine of 35
races. She also had nine seconds and seven thirds. She broke the
record for earnings by a filly or mare when she won the Louisville
Handicap at Churchill Downs on May 3. She scored her biggest win for
trainer Wayne Lukas in the 2000 Breeders' Cup Distaff at Churchill.</LD>
<LD>   Spain was bred to Storm Cat on May 15. A month later, she won the
Fleur De Lis Handicap at Churchill. Saturday, in her final race, she
ran third at Monmouth Park in the Molly Pitcher Handicap.</LD>
<TE>   "I think they took the position that adding on to the [earnings]
record is nice, but it really has no significance [on her breeding
career] and, God forbid, something would happen to her," trainer D.
Wayne Lukas told Associated Press.</TE>

<DH>Summer pro league tryout draws mix of players with big
hopes</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Awvee Storey has experienced the bright lights of big-time college
basketball, playing at such famed arenas as Pauley Pavilion and
McArthur Court, and traveling to storied Chapel Hill, N.C., and
exotic Puerto Rico.</LD>
<LD>   This week, Storey has been in an old, hot Long Beach gymnasium
with more than 200 other players trying to keep alive a dream that
has burned since childhood. Some, like Storey, have played at college
basketball's highest level. Others played in Division III or NAIA
where the lights aren't as bright. There's even some who dominated
their recreation leagues and are taking the longest of shots at the
ultimate dream--the NBA.</LD>
<LD>   At the Summer Pro League's Super Camp, these players are trying
out for spots in arguably the premier summer basketball league in the
nation. Of the 200 or so players participating in the camp, about 25%
are put on rosters, according to Eric Hamasaki, who oversees the
league's day-to-day operation.</LD>
<TE>   Those who make it will be viewed by dozens of scouts from the NBA
and overseas when the league begins its 33rd season Sunday at the
Pyramid on the campus of Long Beach State. Decision day is today,
when the camp ends after four days of skills tests and games.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll find that for a lot of guys, they realize that maybe it's
time to go out and get a real job," said Nick Colon, a camp director
who is going to make some of those decisions. "Sometimes that is
needed so a guy can move on. But you know, America is based on
dreams."</TE>
<TE>   The dream of pro basketball is why participants shelled out $305
to $340 for an opportunity that guarantees only that each player get
an equal amount of playing time in three days of pro-style games with
officials and coaches, and each player will receive a written and
oral evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   That opportunity attracted Wayne Heckaman, a 6-foot-9 center who
played at NAIA Dickinson State in North Dakota. Heckaman, 23, made
the 1,500-mile-plus trip by car. He was one of many players who came
from outside California to attend the camp.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to see if I can play with these guys," he said.
"I want to see where I sit among these players. A friend of mine came
out here last year and he wound up getting on a team in the league. I
thought I might as well give it a shot."</TE>
<TE>   John Younesi, who is the president of the Summer Pro League, said
the camp is what sets his operation apart from other summer leagues
that often are for only NBA players and prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no other league that has this," Younesi said. "If these
guys are good enough, we'll put them on our free-agent teams. They'll
get exposure by playing in front of scouts from every part of the
world."</TE>
<TE>   Storey is looking for just that. As a junior at Arizona State two
years ago, the 6-6 Chicago native led the Pacific 10 Conference in
rebounding. But after a disappointing senior season, he said he
thought the camp would provide an opportunity to showcase his skills.</TE>
<TE>   Though the games are often played at a helter-skelter pace, Storey
stood out with his leaping ability around the basket. He said he
would relish the chance to play anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to see where I stood and find out whether I should
continue playing or not," said Storey, 25. "I'm just trying to get my
name out there. I'm all about opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   For Brandon Payton, the camp provides exposure he believes he
didn't receive in college. After a standout career at Concord De La
Salle High, Payton, 22, played at UC Santa Barbara and Oregon State
but didn't have a big impact at either school.</TE>
<TE>   Payton, whose brother is All-Star guard Gary Payton, wants to join
his sibling in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   He admitted that being in a tryout camp for a summer league isn't
what he hoped for coming out of college. But that hasn't dimmed his
enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   "I figure the Lord is just making me work that much harder to
achieve my dream," he said. "All this is positive for me."</TE>
<TE>   Colon, an assistant coach at Sacramento State, said opportunities
to play overseas have never been better. Though it's doubtful any of
the players at the camp will ever make an NBA roster, some could find
their way to leagues in Europe or Asia.</TE>
<TE>   "Some guys are not realistic," he said. "But many guys find out
that they might not be good enough to play in the NBA but good enough
to play overseas. In some of the better leagues, you can make about
$400,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of Americans play in Russia. Who would have thought that
would happen?"</TE>
<TE>   Carl Holman is fulfilling a dream that he abandoned more than 20
years ago. After years of drug abuse and stints in California state
prisons, he said he is clean and back playing the game he loves.</TE>
<TE>   At 39, he thought it was worth it to make a last-ditch effort to
play with the pros.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in the best shape of my life and I'm having a ball," Holman
said. "I should have been doing this years ago. Who knows? I can give
the Lakers another year or two if they need me."</TE>

<HD>Woods Withdraws From Western Open</HD>

<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>LEMONT, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods withdrew Tuesday from this week's Western Open, citing an
unspecified illness.</LD>
<LD>   Woods made the announcement on his Web site. He notified the PGA
of his decision Tuesday morning, Western Open spokesman Gary Holloway
said.</LD>
<LD>   "Naturally, we are disappointed he has had to withdraw," said John
Kaczkowski, tournament director for the sponsoring Western Golf Assn.
"We appreciate the ongoing relationship we have enjoyed with Tiger
since 1992, when he competed in the Western Junior."</LD>
<TE>   Kaczkowski wished Woods well in his pursuit of golf's Grand Slam.
Woods has won the Masters and the U.S. Open, and had planned to make
the Western his final tuneup for the British Open, which will be
played July 18-21 at Muirfield, Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   But Woods instead decided to remain home to rest, according to his
Web site. The announcement gave no details on Woods' illness.</TE>
<TE>   Woods has played the Western Open seven of the last eight years
and won in 1997 and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The $4-million tournament begins Thursday at Cog Hill Golf and
Country Club near Chicago. Scott Hoch is the defending champion.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, 26, hasn't played since winning last month's U.S. Open. He
did not play in last week's St. Jude Classic at Memphis, Tenn., to be
the best man at the wedding of Jerry Chang, a long-time friend and
former Stanford teammate.</TE>
<TE>   PGA Tour rookie Brenden Pappas replaced Woods in the tournament.</TE>

<HD>Trinidad Decides to Throw in the Towel</HD>
<DH>Boxing: Retirement of the 29-year-old former champion is
greeted with skepticism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frustrated by an inability to land a rematch with the only fighter to
beat him and annoyed with a delay in another multimillion-dollar
rematch against a boxer he already defeated, Felix "Tito" Trinidad is
calling it quits.</LD>
<LD>   Trinidad's lawyer, Nicolas Medina, said in a statement Tuesday
from San Juan, Puerto Rico, that the former welterweight and
middleweight champion was retiring.</LD>
<LD>   "After carefully evaluating all present factors and listening to
the recommendation of his father, manager and trainer, he has decided
to retire definitely as a professional boxer," Medina said.</LD>
<TE>   "The only fights remaining would not add anything to his career,
but would cause great risk to his health."</TE>
<TE>   Trinidad, 29, had been attempting to get a rematch with Bernard
Hopkins, who punished Trinidad until knocking him out in the 12th
round for the undisputed 160-pound championship on Sept. 29, 2001.
Hopkins, though, has rejected Trinidad's overtures.</TE>
<TE>   Further frustrating Trinidad was the collapse of a deal, in
principal, for a rematch with Oscar De La Hoya, who Trinidad defeated
by majority decision on Sept. 18, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The tentative agreement, between Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter,
and Don King, Trinidad's promoter, was contingent upon De La Hoya
beating Fernando Vargas. But that bout, originally scheduled for May
4, was postponed until Sept. 14 because De La Hoya suffered a hand
injury.</TE>
<TE>   The developments left Trinidad without a quality opponent, so he
agreed to fight French journeyman Hacine Cherifi on May 11. Trinidad
won on a fourth-round knockout.</TE>
<TE>   Arum spokesman Bill Caplan said they believed Trinidad's
retirement was a ruse.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a ploy either to get King to work harder to get the fight
with Hopkins," Caplan said, "or to get Hopkins to say, 'Wait a
minute, don't retire. I'll kick your [behind] again.'</TE>
<TE>   "Is he retired? Maybe for a day or two."</TE>
<TE>   Trinidad's people, however, are playing it straight.</TE>
<TE>   "Tito has finished his career healthy, with a brilliant record
and, thanks to God, with an economic future that guarantees peace for
him and his family for the rest of his life," said his father, Felix
Trinidad Sr., who also served as the fighter's trainer and manager.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Trinidad added that he and his son made the decision
after speaking with King, who told them there was little chance of a
rematch with Hopkins.</TE>
<TE>   Trinidad was 41-1 with 34 knockouts and fought in 21 title bouts
after beginning his career in 1990 at the age of 17.</TE>
<TE>   He won his first title on July 19, 1993, with a second-round
knockout of Maurice Blocker to claim the International Boxing
Federation welterweight crown. He defended the title 15 times.</TE>
<TE>   After taking De La Hoya's World Boxing Council welterweight title,
Trinidad moved to the super welterweight division.</TE>
<TE>   He won the World Boxing Assn.'s belt with a unanimous decision
over David Reid on March 3, 2000, and defended the belt twice that
year, first against Mamadou Thiam on July 22 with a third-round
knockout, then knocking out Vargas in the 12th round of their
slugfest on Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Trinidad moved to 160 pounds and, after knocking out William Joppy
in the fifth round to win the WBA middleweight championship on May
12, 2001, suffered his first loss to Hopkins.</TE>

<HD>Henin Makes Her Point Against Seles</HD>
<DH>Wimbledon: She scores an impressive 7-5, 7-6 (4) victory
over the fourth-seeded player and charges into semifinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>One match point saved was reasonable. Certainly, such a legend as
Monica Seles wasn't going to leave quietly, hitting an ace to stay
alive in her quarterfinal match Tuesday against Justine Henin of
Belgium.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a sharp cross-court winner by Seles on the second match
point, Henin still had a bit of room to maneuver in the second-set
tiebreaker. Henin, who has been known to blow leads in the past, then
curved a shot toward Seles while serving on the third match point.
Seles popped the return long, and Henin landed in the Wimbledon
semifinals.</LD>
<LD>   Though Henin played in the Wimbledon final last year, this victory
represented a significant milestone in her blossoming career. It was
the first time in five matches she defeated Seles, the player she
once watched at Roland Garros as a youngster. Maybe it was why Henin
has had such difficulty with Seles, losing a big lead at the 2001
Australian Open.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe it was why the sixth-seeded Henin showed more emotion than
usual, blowing a kiss after her 7-5, 7-6 (4) quarterfinal victory
against No. 4 Seles. And finally, maybe it was why Henin wasn't ready
to think about a semifinal match against two-time defending champion
Venus Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I am still in my quarterfinal," Henin said.</TE>
<TE>   Who could blame her?</TE>
<TE>   Henin has defeated Williams once in six matches, and the
top-seeded player was in dominating form, making a good player, Elena
Likhovtseva of Russia, look rather ordinary. In the first
quarterfinal, Williams beat Likhovtseva, 6-2, 6-0, in 44 minutes,
and, more importantly, escaped the subsequent rain delays, becoming
the first player to reach the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was pleased with her performance but relatively
understated in her celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was younger, I used to always to do a lot of fist pumps
and things like that," Williams, 22, said. "It's not like it's not as
exciting now, it's now I expect myself to be almost perfect.</TE>
<TE>   "Whereas when I first started, I was just first doing things,
first getting to the quarterfinals. It was all new. But now I expect
to be there."</TE>
<TE>   Williams is beating everything, even the weather. She was safely
in the semifinals, and third-seeded Jennifer Capriati was still
trying to finish her fourth-round match later in the afternoon.
Capriati had split sets with Eleni Daniilidou of Greece on Monday and
the match had to be suspended because of darkness.</TE>
<TE>   Originally, they were scheduled to finish on Court 1 after the
fourth-round match between Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands and
Mark Philippoussis of Australia. The men's match also must be
finished today, as they have split the four sets, which have been all
been decided by a tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   Between the length of their match and the weather problems, it
became clear that Capriati might not get her match in. Her coach and
father, Stefano, voiced his displeasure with the schedule and the
match was moved to Court 18.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati needed only 28 minutes to win the third set and reach the
quarterfinals. She defeated Daniilidou, 6-1, 3-6, 6-1, and saved
three break points at 3-1. Today, Capriati will play No. 9 Amelie
Mauresmo of France in the quarterfinals, and No. 2 Serena Williams
will meet No. 11 Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia, weather permitting.</TE>
<TE>   The way Daniilidou was playing in the second set Monday, Capriati
was relieved to have had the match suspended.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be really ready to come out right from the first
ball," she said. "But it was probably helpful because the player
today and the player yesterday was completely different. In that
second set, she was playing pretty unbelievable. It would have been
very tough to beat her if we would have kept playing."</TE>
<TE>   They weren't the only ones who had to endure an overnight wait.
Xavier Malisse of Belgium and Greg Rusedski of Britain played four
sets Monday and had to return for one more Tuesday. Malisse was
sharper for the one-set contest, winning the fourth-round match, 3-6,
6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, and the British disappointment resounded through
the grounds and on television.</TE>
<TE>   "Disappointment again for Greg," said a BBC commentator.</TE>
<TE>   All is not lost for Britain, since Tim Henman remains, but Tuesday
was a breakthrough for Belgium. Henin is in the quarterfinals, and
Malisse became the first Belgian to reach the Wimbledon men's
quarterfinals since 1924. That year, Jean Washer made the
quarterfinal round and lost to Frenchman Rene Lacoste in four sets.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he's a good player," said Rusedski, who missed a forehand
volley on break point at 3-3 in the fifth set. "He's very crafty
because he's got a long reach. He's quick.... He makes shots out of
nothing sometimes. He's not a consistent player, but he's a flashy
player. He was just very loose the whole time when he plays."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Malisse knew Rusedski's tense demeanor would hurt him
at the crucial juncture in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew on break point, if I got it back, he would get a little
tight," Malisse said.</TE>
<TE>   Right. After all, it's not handling the expectations of a hopeful
nation.</TE>

<HD>Players Oppose Drug Tests</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Venus Williams, Capriati take a stance against
out-of- competition testing, citing privacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>Venus Williams and Jennifer Capriati lodged objections Tuesday to the
WTA's proposal to begin out-of-competition drug testing.</LD>
<LD>   The organization has not conducted such tests yet, a fact that
became public this week, but the tour's general counsel said it hoped
to test in 2003. Track and field stars and other high-profile Olympic
athletes regularly submit to random, out-of-competition drug tests,
given with no warning.</LD>
<LD>   Williams and Capriati, however, objected to the element of
surprise and cited privacy issues.</LD>
<TE>   "I just don't think they have any right to kind of see what's
going on inside your body, whatever, even if you're not doing
anything," Capriati said. "It's just I've never heard of anything to
be concerned about anyway, if anyone for steroids [is] getting tested
for that or getting caught with that. I don't really see what the
point would be."</TE>
<TE>   Capriati was asked if she thought anyone used steroids in the
sport. She said no, then was reminded that three players on the ATP
tour have received varying suspensions after testing positive for
performance-enhancing drugs since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, the guys is another story," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Samantha Reeves tested positive after taking an
over-the-counter dietary supplement containing nandrolone, a banned
substance.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said she had a problem with the concept of an unannounced
drug tester showing up on her doorstep.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that would be a good idea," she said. "I think
there has to be at least a notice, normally. I wouldn't let anyone in
my house if I'm not expecting them. Showing up at the door, you
kidding?"</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Williams said, an employee of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency
showed up at her home shortly before Wimbledon. That agency tests
U.S. athletes eligible for Olympic competition and those tests are
unrelated to what the WTA plans.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone tried to get in the development, doing a drug test,"
Williams said. "If I wasn't tested in the next two hours, I wouldn't
be playing on tour. You know, there's always someone at the gates,
trying to get in. Normally, I tell the gate, 'Tell them Venus moved
to Siberia some months ago.' "</TE>
<TE>   Rich Wanninger, the USADA's director of communications, said that
Williams had been scheduled for an out-of-competition drug test
before Wimbledon but the test was not carried out. Williams is in the
player pool to be tested, as are Capriati and about three dozen other
American tennis players, he said. Pam Shriver, former tour player who
now is a television commentator, supported the idea of
out-of-competition testing. She acknowledged there have been more
questions raised about the sport since female players have been
getting bigger and stronger.</TE>
<TE>   "On the world stage, this is a huge issue," Shriver said. "You
have to go as far as you can go to erase the doubts. Let's get rid of
the doubts."</TE>

<LD>On the Fourth of July, when the nation will be celebrating its
independence, I will be spending the day quietly praying for the
safety and security of my fellow citizens. Being a naturalized
citizen from a country that won its independence from the British in
1947, I fully understand the significance of the Fourth of July.</LD>
<LD>   In the past, I spent the day either visiting friends or organizing
a barbecue or visiting public places to watch fireworks. But this
year is different.</LD>
<LD>   This year, the Fourth of July is more than a holiday and
celebration for me. It is going to be a tense day. I will be watching
the news closely, praying that the day ends peacefully.</LD>
<TE>   Sulaiman abu Ghaith, a high-ranking operative of the Al Qaeda
terrorist network, is threatening to attack American interests. He is
a Muslim who claims to speak on behalf of Islam. He uses religious
scriptures in support of his acts, the same scriptures that I read
and exhort my children to read daily.</TE>
<TE>   He prays the same way I pray, and he believes in the same God as I
do.</TE>
<TE>   Yet on that day, I will be asking God to save my country and me
from Abu Ghaith's wrath. I will be asking God not to listen to any of
his prayers, however intense they may be. I will be praying for those
law enforcement officers who will be keeping a close watch on
everything that appears to be suspicious. I will be praying for my
people, my American people.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Ghaith might invoke all the divine names that he remembers,
yet he cannot convince me and an overwhelming majority of Muslims
that we share the same faith. Whatever names he uses to describe his
faith, he does not belong to the community of the faithful, for those
who believe in the divine do not destroy his creation.</TE>
<TE>   In the name of religion, Abu Ghaith wants to destroy a country
that is home to 6 million or more Muslims. Many of these Muslims came
to this country to escape the political and religious persecution of
the power elite in their former countries. Many of them have long
been here and have never condoned violence--much like the millions of
African Americans over the generations who have sought only peace
despite the experience of slavery.</TE>
<TE>   The Fourth of July has a special significance for all such people.
It is not only the country that they celebrate but also the freedoms
that this nation stands for.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Ghaith wants to kill Americans, who collectively have acted to
ensure that Muslims are not treated differently in their new country.
On Sept. 11, when friends of Abu Ghaith were flying planes into the
World Trade Center, hundreds of Americans were standing outside
Islamic centers and mosques to protect Muslims from any violence or
vandalism. The Fourth of July is a special day for Muslims to thank
all those Americans who stood in defense of their freedom.</TE>
<TE>   On the Fourth of July, the differences between Muslim Americans
and those who speak the language of Abu Ghaith will become sharper.
Even though both of us pray to the same God and in the same language,
our prayers and idioms are different.</TE>
<TE>   I will ask God to protect this country--my country--and its people
and secure them from all ills. I will ask God to ensure that the
freedom that this country has guaranteed is preserved, and I will ask
God to return the happiness of those families whose lives were
destroyed by the terrorists in September 2001.</TE>
<TE>   I will ask God to embrace America as my fellow citizens have
embraced me.</TE>
<TE>   However humble I may be in my prayers, I will certainly ask God to
destroy those who are out to destroy innocent beings. I know my God
is merciful, and he will listen to me and many others like me.</TE>
<TE>   I hope that my country, the United States of America, will be safe
on the Fourth of July because of the vigilance of law enforcement
officers and the prayers of millions, including Muslims, around the
globe.</TE>
<TE>   The Fourth of July is a day to demonstrate my commitment to God
and my country.</TE>

<HD>Mexico's Beset Fox Must Redefine 'Change'</HD>
<DH>Making truth a pillar of government could restart a
paralyzed presidency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE DRESSER</AU>
<BD>Denise Dresser is a senior fellow at the Pacific
Council on International Policy at USC.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years after dislodging the Institutional Revolutionary Party from
power, Mexico's President Vicente Fox inspires a multitude of
metaphors. He's frequently described as a captain without a compass,
a quarterback who can't score a touchdown, a janitor who takes care
of a building but doesn't have the skills to remodel it.</LD>
<LD>   At home and abroad, the prevailing perception is that his
administration is paralyzed, his team is in disarray and his bold
vision is a mirage.</LD>
<LD>   Unless he is able to salvage his presidency, Fox will be
remembered as the man who knew how to topple the PRI but didn't know
how to govern or change the country he fought so hard to lead.</LD>
<TE>   Mexicans are growing worried about what hasn't happened since Fox
took office. They speak about the gap between what was offered and
what has been delivered, between what they demand and what they get
in return.</TE>
<TE>   Fox is applauded for maintaining macroeconomic stability and
opening up the archives of the 1970s "dirty war" against leftists and
supporting a freedom-of-information act.</TE>
<TE>   But his modest triumphs have been overshadowed by his dramatic
defeats. Fox promised ambitious fiscal reform and ended up with
diluted disaster; he promised a new labor law but wasn't able to
domesticate old labor leaders; he promised badly needed structural
reforms but hasn't mustered enough consensus to get them approved.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Mexico is stuck in a rut because of hostile relations
between the president and the Congress, ambiguous relations between
him and the PRI and dysfunctional relations between him and the
disparate Cabinet he selected.</TE>
<TE>   After two years of almost daily disappointments, Fox is a changed
man. He seems less inclined to make courageous calls for action or
take the risks they would entail. He has shrunk the purpose and the
scope of his presidency. Whereas two years ago change meant total
renovation, today it means minimum maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   Fox once wanted to be remembered as the man who reinvented the
country, but now he's content if his popularity rating remains higher
than 50%. Instead of using his six-year term to bring about change,
he simply wants to stay out of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, it may be too soon to label his presidency a squandered
opportunity or to speak of what could have been.</TE>
<TE>   A recent poll in the newspaper Reforma indicates that although 51%
believe that Fox has not changed the country at all, many think that
he could still do so. They criticize Fox for not taking corruption
head-on, yet they praise him for his honesty.</TE>
<TE>   Fox could get a second chance if he moves aggressively to identify
and bring to justice those responsible for human rights abuses in the
past and those responsible for illegal campaign financing in his own
election.</TE>
<TE>   Fox needs to step away from measuring the success of his
administration by legislative victories. If he continues to tread
down that path, the PRI will trip him at every turn, given that the
party has no appetite for congressional collaboration.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, the Fox team must redefine "change" so that it means
total transparency and true accountability and governmental
responsibility. Fox should not only reveal the names of the 74
officials--identified in a National Human Rights Commission report
written in  2001 but yet to be publicly released--who tortured and
killed leftists in the 1970s; he should make sure they are brought to
justice. Fox should not only pursue those who channeled millions of
dollars from the state oil company into his rival's campaign coffers,
he should also come clean on irregularities in his own campaign
finances and the role his Friends of Fox organization played in them.</TE>
<TE>   To restart his paralyzed presidency, Fox needs to focus on the
truth--not as a government concession but as a citizen right. If
Mexico's president can build a political system wherein lies are
exposed and government is not immune from scrutiny, his presidency
will have amounted to more than just removing the PRI. After so many
years of deceit in Mexico, truth would be a real change.</TE>

<BD>Ranan R. Lurie is a senior associate at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington and a syndicated
columnist and political cartoonist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have lived exactly half my life in these United States of America.
The other part was spent in Canada, Britain, Israel, Germany and
Japan. As such, I can say with more authority than most that this
country is the finest place a person can choose to live.</LD>
<LD>   However, if soccer were to become part of the American national
heritage, it would be an even better place.</LD>
<LD>   We saw, over the last month, hundreds of millions of people around
the world drunk with excitement while following the international
soccer matches played in Japan and South Korea.</LD>
<TE>   All those perspiring faces looked alike to me. Whether the fans
were Norwegian or Ghanaian, German or Chinese, boy or girl, tall or
short, Muslim or Catholic, black, brown, yellow or white, they all
had that same expression of enthusiasm developed from watching
soccer, the great equalizer.</TE>
<TE>   Common sense dictates that if something can intrigue so many
different people, it must be worth looking into. So why not adopt it
as our national sport? Let's analyze the benefits:</TE>
<TE>   * It's wonderful for business. Think of the opportunities: soccer
cards of the new heroes, increased hot dog and T-shirt sales, the
parades, the halls of fame, the movies, the jobs created for stadium
builders, the boost to tourism (traveling to Brazil to watch the
game, having Brazilians come over to collect their trophies).</TE>
<TE>   * Americans joining the rest of civilization.</TE>
<TE>   * Americans finally having a common language with the rest of the
world.</TE>
<TE>   * America buying the Brazilian team, issuing its members green
cards and thus beating every other soccer team in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Seriously speaking, we need to find as many common denominators as
we can with the world. The more mutual habits, traditions, sports and
interests we can share with other people around the world, the fewer
reasons for disputes. I claim from personal knowledge that the
average Japanese, German or Brit loves and admires the United States
and what it stands for. Yes, we do suffer from well-deserved jealousy
that is cemented by habits that are so American (among them football
and baseball, which we have never managed to market to the rest of
the world). Why?</TE>
<TE>   The United States is like a wonderful giant cruise ship that has
everything. When it reaches, for instance, the port of Naples, no one
bothers to get off because the stores on Deck 14 are better.</TE>
<TE>   We need to puncture the great bubble that surrounds us. A
well-aimed soccer ball can penetrate it and help do the job. But
let's be careful not to win too much.</TE>

<HD>Let's Aim for the Moon, or Mars</HD>
<DH>Privatize space travel, free NASA for research.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK R. WHITTINGTON</AU>
<BD>Mark R. Whittington, a space policy analyst, is author
of "Children of Apollo" (Xliberis Publishing, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How did America's human space flight program get stuck going around
in circles in low Earth orbit? Thirty years ago, humans stopped going
to the moon. Despite a subsequent generation of improvement in
technology and experience, there is little serious thought of going
back to the moon, not to speak of going to Mars.</LD>
<LD>   The reason for our being in the trap of low Earth orbit stems
mostly from the failure of the space shuttle and the space station
programs to live up to the promises of their creators.</LD>
<LD>   The space shuttle was supposed to lower the cost of space travel.
Instead, because of a limited development budget and government
mismanagement, the space shuttle has made space flight more expensive
than it was in the 1960s.</LD>
<TE>   The space station was supposed to be a world-class laboratory and
orbiting port of call for lunar and interplanetary spacecraft.
Instead, 18 years and tens of billions of dollars since it was
proposed, the current incarnation of the space station has become a
money pit as officials of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration struggle to find a way to make use of it.</TE>
<TE>   With such a record, who can blame people for being skeptical of
any idea of lunar bases or expeditions to Mars? NASA would just mess
those up too, the reasoning goes. Indeed, the conventional wisdom
seems to be that NASA should fix its problems closer to home before
it even thinks of going beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Pursuing such a course would be a prescription for stagnation, or
even the death of human space flight, because ever more people would
lose interest in space adventures.</TE>
<TE>   NASA should hand human space flight operations over to the private
sector as quickly as possible. In breaking the Gordian knot, NASA
could transform itself from a bureaucratic operations agency to a
cutting-edge outfit performing the research, development and
exploration it was known for in the past.</TE>
<TE>   NASA should commercialize the space shuttle fleet--lock, stock and
astronaut. The government has run a national space line for far too
long, bringing along with it government inefficiencies.</TE>
<TE>   Next, NASA should throw open all regular launch services,
including the resupply and crew rotation of the International Space
Station, to private bid.</TE>
<TE>   Then NASA should redirect its space launch initiative away from
building a replacement for the shuttle and toward technology
development that will help create a private launch industry.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, NASA and the partners in the International Space Station
should privatize the orbiting facility. A private operator would be
empowered to enter into commercial agreements to maintain and enhance
the space station's capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas mismanagement by NASA has threatened to freeze the space
station at a crew of three, a private firm might be able to find
creative ways to expand that number back to seven. NASA and its
station partners could become customers rather than operators.</TE>
<TE>   A privately run low-Earth-orbit infrastructure would go further
toward proving the usefulness of humans in space than would staying
the course, hoping something will change by itself.</TE>
<TE>   A return-to-the-moon effort would not necessarily be an
Apollo-sized operation. Studies conducted at the Johnson Space Center
and at the Lunar and Planetary Institute suggest that a five-year,
$2.5-billion effort using off-the-shelf or soon-to-be-developed
technology could be mounted. Even at double the estimated cost, the
price of a return to the moon would be only a billion dollars a
year--half of what it takes to maintain the space station.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to begin the American odyssey on the stone deserts of
the moon and the rusty plains and valleys of Mars. The future
requires that we dare no less.</TE>

<LD>Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta installed federal security
directors at nine U.S. airports Tuesday, including David M. Stone at
Los Angeles International and Richard R. Baker at Ontario
International. Stone, an admiral and one of the Navy's top
anti-terrorism experts, and Baker, a 20-year FBI veteran, are
experienced security professionals. They're sorely needed in a new
Transportation Security Administration that isn't doing much better
than the slapdash private system it succeeded.</LD>
<LD>   A federal study released this week showed that baggage screeners
failed to detect 41% of concealed dummy weapons at LAX. The numbers
were only slightly better at Ontario. As an official at the security
agency told The Times on Monday, "It's still the same [flawed
security], it's just costing a lot more money"--$2.4 billion this
year alone for the agency, not to mention $100 million that LAX
officials have spent studying how to modernize. Though the
$9.6-billion plan that Mayor James K. Hahn made public Tuesday puts
aviation security out front, construction won't start for years.</LD>
<TE>   Airlines, federal officials and aviation experts increasingly
agree that the most cost- effective step would be to put less
emphasis on poorly thought-out random searches--confiscating a
grandmother's manicure kit, rummaging through underwear in a pilot's
bag, even searching the person and luggage of former Vice President
Al Gore--twice--on a recent Midwestern trip.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, experts agree, aviation security efforts should focus
more on improving computerized passenger profiling systems like those
long used successfully in Israel. That means more intensive attention
to a smaller number of travelers. The profiling system looks for
anomalies in a traveler's itinerary, finances and personal
profile--not, as is commonly assumed, at race or ethnicity.</TE>
<TE>   In recent congressional testimony, an El Al Airlines official told
of the questioning of a young pregnant woman in 1986. The woman
revealed that she had only $75 but planned to stay at one of Israel's
most expensive hotels. Since her story didn't add up, screeners
reexamined her baggage, which an X-ray had cleared. They found 7
pounds of explosives in the lining.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that some federal officials seem to understand
what's needed. As Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge recently put
it, summarizing the challenge to federal aviation security, "We need
to bring the same kind of attention to people at our airports as we
do to [scanning for] ... weapons."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Times poll released Tuesday on Hollywood and San Fernando Valley
secession is cause for cheer but not complacency. Even if the vote
were held today and secession lost, half the Valley residents polled
still would want out. City leaders can't ignore that if Los Angeles
is to be united in more than name.</LD>
<LD>   According to the poll, 38% of residents citywide favor San
Fernando Valley secession and 47% oppose it. In the Valley, however,
those polled supported a breakaway city 52% to 37%, which is why
proponents of unity can't rest easy. Hollywood secession would lose
25% to 59% citywide and even more resoundingly within Hollywood,
where 61% of registered voters polled opposed a breakup. Almost 40%
said they were upset to find their neighborhood in the proposed city,
a condemnation of the unseemly rush to get Hollywood on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   For a secession measure to pass, it would have to win in the area
petitioning to secede and citywide. Leaders of the Valley secession
movement figure that high voter turnout and strong support in the
Valley could tip the citywide vote in their favor. The Times poll
suggests that they would fall short of the 65% Valley margin they say
they need. Still, four months of campaigning lie ahead.</LD>
<TE>   The poll found that secession's staunchest supporters are white,
affluent, Republican, self-described conservatives or moderates who
live in the West Valley, the stronghold of secession for decades. Its
most ardent opponents live outside the Valley and are liberals,
Democrats, Jews and African Americans. These are dividing lines that
determine so many Los Angeles elections, and they're not very
flexible. Even electing a moderate Republican, Richard Riordan, to
the nonpartisan mayor's office failed to quell secession fever; the
drive to put it on the ballot began during his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   But support for secession also transcends old patterns and
ideologies. Latinos, for example, split along geographic lines, with
52% of Valley Latinos polled supporting secession and 36% of Latinos
citywide. The top reasons cited for support were the expectation of a
smaller, more efficient government, more local control and better
access to city services.</TE>
<TE>   Whether a new Valley city of 1.4 million souls could deliver all
that is open to debate. But it is without question that all Los
Angeles residents want to feel connected to and respected by their
government, and that many Valley residents feel ignored. City leaders
can do something about this by energetically supporting the new
neighborhood councils and getting city services where they are
needed, not later but now. Otherwise voters citywide may well defeat
secession only to have a still-divided city.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing will satisfy secession ideologues who have already
dismissed every effort to bridge the divide, including the addition
of a fifth City Council seat for the Valley. But a city that works
could well win over the rest.</TE>

<LD>The good guys won Monday, beating a slash-and-burn campaign by the
auto industry in one of the Legislature's more titanic recent
struggles. The Assembly, after a long and bitter debate, passed a
landmark bill to fight global warming by limiting greenhouse gas
emissions from autos, light trucks and sport utility vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   The bill's modest goals survived an all-out misinformation
campaign by auto makers, dealers and labor unions. The industry has
long resisted safety and environmental standards, from seat belts to
catalytic converters.</LD>
<LD>   AB 1493, by Assemblywoman Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), was backed
by environmental groups but would not have passed without the
arm-twisting support of Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San
Francisco) and Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City). This was
a watershed for the new speaker, as concerns were mounting that
Wesson, the Assembly Democrats' chief fund-raiser, was reluctant to
clash with wealthy special interests. Wesson muscled the bill through
on a party-line vote of 41 to 30. Burton did the same in the Senate
last weekend.</LD>
<TE>   The bill goes to Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat who sees himself as a
business-friendly executive. A campaign by the same auto industry
opponents to persuade Davis to veto the bill opened Tuesday. But it
should be easy for Davis to come down on the green side. AB 1493
allows the governor to bolster his environmental support while
pioneering in an area where President Bush fears to go. A veto would
infuriate Burton and Wesson, leaders with the power to punish Davis.</TE>
<TE>   In its propaganda campaign, the auto industry portrayed AB 1493 as
the death knell for the auto in America as we know it. Bureaucrats on
the Air Resources Board would demand production of tinny little cars
that would put soccer moms and kids in the path of death. The bill
would impose higher taxes and limit miles driven. There would be no
more SUVs. Only the better-off could afford cars.</TE>
<TE>   None of that is true. The bill directs the Air Resources Board to
establish carbon dioxide standards by 2005, but they would not be in
effect until the 2009 model year. Some auto companies are already
planning low-emission SUVs using hybrid gas-electric engines. No
kinds of vehicles are banned. The Legislature can overrule the board
at any time.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents derided the effect California can have on a global
problem, in that it accounts for just a small percentage of overall
greenhouse gases. But with the world's fifth-largest economy, the
state has an influence that cannot be denied. What happens here often
becomes the norm for the rest of the country. The U.S. fight to
offset the potentially catastrophic effects of warming has begun in
the proper place.</TE>

<HD>Mark Kroeker's Bid to Lead L.A. Police</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In its search for a strong and effective chief of police, Los Angeles
can't do better than Portland, Ore., Police Chief Mark Kroeker
("Kroeker 'Wants to Lead' LAPD," June 30). His failure to win the
position last time it was open was clearly a decision based on
politics rather than qualifications.</LD>
<LD>   In my experience with Kroeker when I served as a staff attorney
for the Anti-Defamation League, he is a man well-respected by his
peers and subordinates as well as community leaders and individuals.
He is a strong and courageous leader, a creative and forward-looking
manager and a man of impeccable integrity. Kroeker demonstrates that
strength and sensitivity can indeed exist in the same person. I urge
the decision makers to name Kroeker "top cop." We will all have
reason to say thanks.</LD>
<LD>   Barbara H. Bergen</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I find it suspicious and an alarming omission that you would
report at length Kroeker's interest in becoming Los Angeles police
chief without mentioning his highly publicized refusal to assist the
anti-terrorism campaign. Your Nov. 30 article, "Now Portland Comes In
for Questioning," subtitled, "Probe: Oregon city and its police chief
catch flak for refusing to interview foreigners on a U.S. list,"
reported the following:</TE>
<TE>   "Law enforcement officers in the rest of the nation are
questioning foreigners about their possible knowledge of terrorist
activities. But Kroeker, worried about civil rights violations, has
said his officers will not join in this task. His is the only police
agency in the country to refuse to cooperate for such reasons,
according to a spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thank you for bringing to light the story of Victor Samayoa and his
tutor, Armando Herman (June 27). When most conversation seems to
drift toward security threats, the hopelessness of the Middle East,
American corporate thievery and the sexing-up of our preteen
daughters, I'm grateful for people like Herman, who set aside their
personal interests for an intangible greater good.</LD>
<LD>   To read about Herman and Samayoa reminds me that all is not lost,
that it doesn't take an event with the magnitude of Sept. 11 to know
that for every act of plain meanness in the world there are probably
a million acts of selflessness and dedication to the advancement of
the human spirit. As the father of an autistic child, I thank God for
men and women like Herman (and Samayoa) and the wide ripples of hope
their courage and friendship create.</LD>

<LD>Unfortunately, the information about Pomona College in "Scholarships
for Achievement, Not Need, Increase Rapidly" (June 17) gave an
inaccurate picture of Pomona's financial aid program. While the
figure quoted regarding the average family income of Pomona aid
recipients was correct, the impression was given that we were among
the schools "shifting more of their money into scholarships based
solely or partly on merit."</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Pomona's financial aid program is completely need-based.
We are also one of the few schools that have a need-blind admissions
policy and still meet the full demonstrated financial need of every
student admitted. Because Pomona College is strong financially, we
are financially able to give more money to more students. During
2001-02, a total of approximately $19.4 million was awarded to 773
Pomona students in the form of financial aid. The average aid package
was about $25,000.</LD>

<LD>It comes as no surprise to me that the L.A. Department of Water and
Power overcharged the state on energy sales (June 29). Three times in
the last few years my sewer charges have exceeded my water charges by
300%! I asked how is it possible for three times more water to flow
out of my house than comes into it?</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, they do that to save you money," was the straight-faced
reply. What a shame that the role of city government has changed from
public service to making a profit. I'm fed up with it. Until the DWP
charges a fair price, based on reality, I'll be paying the imaginary
portion of my sewer bill with an imaginary check.</LD>

<HD>Alternative Words for Pledge of Allegiance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is a simple and quite meaningful solution to the uproar over
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals declaration on the
congressionally modified (for purely political purposes) Pledge of
Allegiance with its reference to a nation "under God"--let's all
learn anew and recite regularly the preamble to the Constitution of
the United States. The high school seniors in my first-period
Advanced Placement American government and politics class have been
doing just that for the past several years. This is much more than an
avoidance of the constitutionally questionable religious reference;
it takes back our Constitution and renews our commitment to the
fundamental principles that guide our one indivisible republic as we
pursue liberty and justice for all.</LD>
<LD>   Patriotism is not about a flag. It is and should always be about
thoughtful and reasoned understanding of the foundational principles
that are what really hold us together as a people, especially when
challenged. "We, the People ... do ordain and establish this
Constitution for the United States of America" are words we can all
live by.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin H. Fox</LD>
<TE>   South Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So, the Pledge of Allegiance has gotten controversial. I'd like to
see our kids recite this every morning at school. It was written
about 40 years earlier than the pledge, but by America's greatest
poet--a man who spent his entire life writing about what it means to
be truly American--Walt Whitman.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what you shall do: Love the earth and sun and the
animals, despise riches, give alms to everyone that asks, stand up
for the stupid and crazy, devote your income and labor to others,
hate tyrants, argue not concerning God.... "</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Fenwick</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Palisades</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While many of my neighbors are outraged over the recent 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals ruling on the Pledge of Allegiance, I find
it curious we even have such a pledge. What sort of "allegiance" are
we committing to?</TE>
<TE>   Might it not be better to debate the language of the pledge,
wherein we could say, "I pledge my best efforts to support and defend
liberty, equality and justice for all." Now that makes more sense,
even to a first-grader!</TE>

<TE>   Orange</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You reap what you sow ("Keep God in the Pledge, an Angry Chorus
Cries," June 28). When you think about it, the response to the pledge
decision is exactly what you would expect from a populace that has
learned what it means to be an American from recitation of the pledge
rather than from study of, say, the Federalist Papers.</TE>

<LD>Re "School Vouchers Win Backing of High Court," June 28:</LD>
<LD>   As a member of the Catholic Church, I am opposed to and fear
government vouchers for private schools due to the "slippery slope"
that is being created. Sure, now vouchers are primarily spent on
Catholic schools, but how could we deny them to the many new private
schools that could be created with this new source of taxpayer
revenue, including those that teach ideas such as Islamic
fundamentalism, white supremacy, communism and the overthrowing of
traditional American ideals?</LD>
<LD>   If we have to grant taxpayer-paid vouchers to Catholics, then why
not to schools created by the followers of the likes of David Koresh,
Osama bin Laden or Timothy McVeigh?</LD>
<TE>   Do we really believe that the government is nimble enough to
provide oversight over what is going on in all the private schools
that will receive vouchers? Do we really want to trust our taxpayer
money to fall into the hands of the people who might run these
schools? Or do we even trust it going into the hands of the Catholic
clergy, whose track record with children and adolescents has been
very troubled as of late?</TE>

<TE>   The only blow delivered was to the education establishment
(editorial, June 28). This ruling clearly articulates that state or
federal funding of students for kindergarten through 12th grade is no
different from funding for religious day care or religious university
enrollment. Is The Times concerned that Cal Lutheran or Loyola
allocates resources to "proselytizing and religious training, key
parts of the mission of any religious school"? Is The Times against
state-funded scholarships or federally funded research programs to
these institutions? The Times has always been a strong advocate for
education and champion of diversity in educational institutions. Yet
you apparently fail to see the wisdom in allowing parents to select
the best among education alternatives for their children.</TE>
<TE>   Playing to the fears that charlatans will operate schools or that
the equivalent of madrasas will be established is a cynical
viewpoint. A more likely outcome will be the establishment of a wide
variety of fine educational facilities that market-driven outcomes
demand.</TE>

<HD>Democrats Pose New Threat to Davis Budget</HD>
<DH>Finances: Lawmakers in the governor's party complain the
spending plan lacks enough new taxes to cope with deficit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Though he says he doesn't feel the need to negotiate with Republican
leaders to win passage of a new state budget, Gov. Gray Davis may
find himself forced to talk taxes with another group of unhappy
lawmakers: members of his own party.</LD>
<LD>   As the Assembly struggles to pass a budget and a related tax plan
to help fund it, not only is it unclear whether there are enough
Republicans to approve the package, but Democratic support is now in
doubt too.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblywoman Helen Thomson (D-Davis) indicated that her vote in
favor of the spending plan over the weekend could be the only aye
vote she casts for the document because it contains too few new
taxes.</LD>
<TE>   Thomson said it is an unfair burden on Californians that lawmakers
have not considered other tax proposals before settling on a one-year
hike in vehicle license fees to help close the state's $23.6-billion
budget gap. And she is not alone.</TE>
<TE>   "My personal feeling is what we're doing now in terms of the
budget is obviously totally inadequate," said Assemblyman John Dutra
(D-Fremont). "It's not looking at the long-term problem at all."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate approved the spending package for fiscal 2002-03 over
the weekend and sent it to the Assembly, where Republicans blocked
its passage Sunday because it contains about $4 billion in new taxes
and other revenue. The result was that California missed a July 1
deadline to have a new budget in place. The plan requires a
two-thirds majority approval, which means in the Assembly that four
Republicans must join the Democratic majority to pass a budget,
assuming that all 50 Democrats vote in favor.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Democratic leaders, however, did not call for a vote
Sunday on a key budget-related bill that contains the tax plan. Dutra
predicted that if lawmakers were asked to vote on the plan, it would
fall 14 to 16 votes short of passage in the Democratic caucus.</TE>
<TE>   He said many of his counterparts believe that the vehicle license
fee proposal should run for two years, it should exempt cars valued
at $10,000 or less, and the full license fee should be restored for
vehicles worth more than $10,000, to generate $3.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Those provisions, he said, would make the tax less regressive,
because vehicles valued at $10,000 or less generate only 12.5% of the
revenue from the fees but cover 50% of the people who pay them.</TE>
<TE>   Nineteen Assembly Democrats, including Dutra, Thomson and Wilma
Chan (D-Alameda), held a news conference a week ago to support taxing
top earners more to help balance the budget. "I don't think the
[personal income tax proposal] is dead yet, but I also think it's
important that we have a budget by this summer," Chan said.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson and Dutra said the state needs to take a long-term
approach to budgeting as a result of ongoing imbalances between
revenue and spending.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to a request by Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte of
Rancho Cucamonga, the state's independent legislative analyst,
Elizabeth Hill, predicted in a letter Tuesday that the budget
shortfall for fiscal 2003-04 would hit $9.8 billion. Hill had
previously predicted an $8-billion gap, but attributed the new,
higher figure to restorations made by lawmakers of ongoing spending
cuts that had been sought by Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the programs that lawmakers restored are in health, social
services and local government. "We remain firm in our belief that we
ought to solve the budget problem and just not paper it over until
after the election," Brulte said. "This budget is worse than the one
Gov. Davis submitted in May, and his wasn't very good to begin with."</TE>
<TE>   During a tour of the UC Davis Cancer Center on Tuesday, the
governor reiterated his plans to peel off the minimum number of
Assembly Republicans rather than negotiate with their leaders. A
Davis aide later said the administration is very confident that
Assembly Democrats will support the spending plan and that gaining
its passage is the task at hand.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working very hard to convince four or five Republicans to
step up and do the right thing," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Budget watcher Kevin Gordon, executive director of the California
Assn. of School Business Officials, summed up the dilemma facing
Davis and Democratic leaders this way: "If they lean too far to the
right to get some Republicans, they risk losing Democrats on the
other side."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate, which approved the budget and a series of related
bills Saturday, had voted previously to tax the wealthy to raise
money, but came up a vote short.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats subsequently found the one GOP vote they needed
to approve the spending package in Sen. Maurice Johannessen
(R-Redding), but only after Democratic leaders ditched the income tax
plan and replaced it with Davis' original one-year, license-fee
proposal. Both Johannessen and Davis oppose the income-tax hike,
which would raise between $2.7 billion and $3.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   In another budget-related development, Senate Republicans have
voted to boot Johannessen from their caucus, triggering this response
from him Tuesday: "Nah-nah, nah-nah, nah."</TE>

<HD>Head of Oracle Inquiry Ousted as Panel's Chairman</HD>
<DH>Politics: Assemblyman says he is being punished for his
aggressive probe. But speaker says it was because he failed to vote
on auto-emissions bill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- The lawmaker who headed the inquiry into the state's
botched software deal with Oracle Corp. was dumped from his committee
chairmanship Tuesday by Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblyman Dean Florez (D-Shafter) said Wesson called him into
the speaker's office and informed him he was losing the post on the
Joint Legislative Audit Committee for an irresponsible act: failing
to stick around a day earlier to vote on a controversial bill to
regulate auto emissions of greenhouse gases.</LD>
<LD>   But Florez said he felt he was being punished for something else:
leading an aggressive probe into the political and bureaucratic acts
that led to the state approving the $95-million Oracle pact without
competitive bidding.</LD>
<TE>   The hearings, he said, made him unpopular with some Democratic
lawmakers and may have led to complaints from Gov. Gray Davis'
administration.</TE>
<TE>   A Sunday opinion piece Florez penned for the Sacramento Bee that
carried the headline "Is Capitol for sale to highest bidder?" may
have been the final straw, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely, it was Oracle, no doubt," Florez said. "It seems to
me more like payback for Oracle than anything."</TE>
<TE>   Wesson (D-Culver City) declined to discuss the Florez demotion,
and a spokesman described it as "an internal matter."</TE>
<TE>   But a source close to the speaker stressed that the decision had
"absolutely nothing" to do with the Oracle hearings.</TE>
<TE>   The move, the source said, was not based on Florez's refusal to
support the emissions measure.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, it was based on his refusal to fulfill his duties as a
member of the speaker's leadership team by staying for the vote and
helping defeat Republican attempts to overturn it.</TE>
<TE>   The emissions bill by Assemblywoman Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills)
passed by a 41-30 vote and awaits the governor's signature.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, which would make California the first state to regulate
tailpipe emissions of gases suspected of causing global warming, was
a top priority for Wesson and other Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Florez said that he was not a supporter of the bill and had voted
against an earlier version.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than stay to do the same again Monday, he said, he took a
charter flight home to watch his 11-year-old son play in a Little
League game.</TE>
<TE>   If he was bounced from a committee for failing to vote for the
emissions bill, Florez said, that's even less ethical than the Oracle
debacle.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know chairmanships were being traded for votes," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Bill to Name Bodie as State Ghost Town Dies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A bill to designate Bodie as the official state ghost town has died
in the Senate after pressure from backers of a rival ghost
town--Calico--turned some lawmakers against it.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the setback, the bill's author, Assemblyman Tim Leslie
(R-Tahoe City), vows to find the votes he needs and bring the measure
up again when the Senate returns from summer recess in August.</LD>
<LD>   "It's disappointing, but we think we still have a chance," said
Kevin O'Neill, an aide to the assemblyman.</LD>
<TE>   The measure, AB 1757, sought to single out Bodie, in remote Mono
County, as California's most authentic ghost town.</TE>
<TE>   But after fans of Calico complained, some legislators opted not to
support the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie said Calico, just off Interstate 15 near Barstow, has a lot
to offer, but is essentially a "snow-cone ghost town experience,"
with mock gunfights, Wild West parades and other artificial
attractions.</TE>
<TE>   Bodie, by contrast, has been preserved in a state of "arrested
decay," and gives visitors a more pure encounter with a ghost town,
he said.</TE>

<HD>DNA Cited in Westerfield Trial</HD>
<DH>Courts: Expert testifies that hair in suspect's house
matches victim's dog. Defense calls neighbors to the stand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The prosecution closed its case against David Westerfield on Tuesday
by presenting DNA evidence it suggests ties the murder defendant to
7-year-old Danielle van Dam.</LD>
<LD>   Westerfield's attorney opened his defense with testimony from
three neighbors who said the accused killer acted normally in the
days around the girl's disappearance.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors have alleged that their case is cemented by several
pieces of physical evidence and on Tuesday they presented the final
one: A DNA expert testified that dog hair found in Westerfield's home
is similar to the hair of the dog owned by the Van Dam family.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that the dog's hair was clinging to Danielle's
pajamas when Westerfield kidnapped her from her bedroom and took her
to his house two doors away and later to his recreational vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Joy Halverson of the QuestGen Forensics laboratory in Davis said
the hair found in Westerfield's RV, on a comforter, and in a trash
can in Westerfield's garage matched that of the Van Dams' Weimaraner,
Layla.</TE>
<TE>   But under cross-examination by defense attorney Steve Feldman,
Halverson, a veterinarian, said the hair could have come from a dog
of the same breed.</TE>
<TE>   Other DNA experts previously testified that the girl's hair, blood
and fingerprints were found in Westerfield's home and RV.</TE>
<TE>   The defense has attempted to explain that evidence by suggesting
Danielle may have left the hair or even blood during a previous visit
to Westerfield's home.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle disappeared Feb. 2. Her nude and decomposing body was
found in a rural area of the county, 40 miles from the Van Dam
neighborhood, on Feb. 27.</TE>
<TE>   Halverson was the final prosecution witness as Deputy Dist. Atty.
Jeff Dusek, after 15 days of testimony, finished the state's case.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman called three neighbors as the opening defense witnesses.
They testified, in effect, that Westerfield did not appear to act
strangely the day Danielle disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have alleged that Westerfield was so unnerved by what
he had done that he began a circuitous trip in his RV from the Silver
Strand beach in Coronado to the sand dunes of Imperial Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The witnesses also gave testimony that could help explain
Westerfield's other actions at the time of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Mark Roehr testified that he once found Westerfield's RV
unlocked. Feldman has suggested that Danielle may have gotten into
the vehicle without her parents' knowledge while playing in the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Roehr and other neighbors also testified that it was not unusual
for Westerfield to thoroughly clean his RV after going to the desert.</TE>
<TE>   Dusek has said that Westerfield cleaned the vehicle to wash away
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield, 50, is accused of kidnapping, murder and possession
of child pornography. He faces a possible death penalty if convicted.</TE>

<HD>Raymond Lubow, 82; Created Effects Foot Pedals for Guitars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raymond Lubow, the inventor and manufacturer of Morley pedals--foot
pedals that produce a variety of musical effects popular with
electric guitarists and keyboard players--has died. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Lubow died June 18 at his home in Los Angeles after a long
struggle with prostate cancer.</LD>
<LD>   In the early 1960s, Lubow was the owner of a Los Angeles
television repair business with his brother, Marvin, when he
developed a new method of creating echoes and other delayed sounds
that had been popularized by legendary guitarist Les Paul in the
1950s.</LD>
<TE>   But instead of the bulky tape-recorder mechanism previous
manufacturers had used to create echoes, Lubow created a much smaller
electronic unit that made echo effects without the use of tape.</TE>
<TE>   Early units produced by the Lubow brothers' corporation, Tel Ray
Electronics, were sold under the name Ad-N-Echo and also were
incorporated into amplifiers and other equipment made by such leading
manufacturers as Fender, Gibson and Rickenbacker.</TE>
<TE>   Lubow's pioneering efforts in various forms of sound modification
earned him numerous patents and an industrywide reputation.</TE>
<TE>   The Lubow brothers' firm made more than 30 devices that alter
musical sounds.</TE>
<TE>   But the company's best-known products, produced under its Morley
division beginning in the 1970s, were its effects pedals, which used
a pioneering photoelectric circuit and were considered more rugged
and dependable than those made by competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Resembling the accelerator pedal of a car, the pedals allow a
guitarist to control volume, create the familiar throaty "wah-wah"
sound or produce a fuzzy, distorted sound.</TE>
<TE>   The company's pedals, which were distributed worldwide, have been
used by countless bands and musicians, including the Beach Boys, the
Grateful Dead, U2, Chick Corea, George Harrison and Stevie Wonder.</TE>
<TE>   The Morley line of pedals was known for its distinctive "Morley
Man" logo: a wailing, longhaired rocker.</TE>
<TE>   "For a period of three or four years in the '70s, Morley pedals
were sort of the industry standard," said rock music expert Jim
Washburn, author of "Martin Guitars," a 1997 book that chronicles the
history of America's oldest guitar company.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn said Lubow didn't invent the wah-wah pedal--it was
pioneered by the Vox company around 1966--but Lubow "made some unique
improvements" to it.</TE>
<TE>   "His way of finding new solutions to things was indicative of the
innovation and creativity that suffused the [music] industry at the
time," Washburn said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bronx-born Lubow studied electronics at Hebrew Tech in
Manhattan before serving in the Army Signal Corps during World War
II.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he and his wife, Sylvia, moved to Los Angeles,
where Lubow opened a radio repair business.</TE>
<TE>   When Lubow retired in 1989, the company was sold to Accutronics
Inc. The Morley pedal continues to be manufactured.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife of 56 years, Lubow is survived by three
daughters, Carla of Los Angeles, Dana of Monrovia and Lisa of
Glendale; a brother, Marvin of Spokane, Wash.; a sister, Anita
Chernick of Sherman Oaks; and two grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Charcoal Briquette, Wood Fires Banned in Los Padres Forest</HD>
<DH>Safety: Officials take action in light of dry conditions.
Campers are disappointed but understand the need.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reacting to one of the driest fire seasons in memory, the U.S. Forest
Service has banned all wood and charcoal briquette fires in Los
Padres National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   While forest officials don't anticipate a great outcry over the
ban, which began Tuesday and will last indefinitely, they acknowledge
it may disappoint some summer campers.</LD>
<LD>   Count Marlene Wait of Somis among the disappointed. She and her
husband, William, had been looking forward to cooking outdoor meals
in Los Padres with their Dutch oven. But since the oven requires
briquettes for heat, it's now illegal to use that oven in the forest.
"In one hour I could have made stew, enchiladas, apple crisp," she
said. "Now--thank goodness I brought pans."</LD>
<TE>   She now plans to use a cooking stove. Wait said the ban is
probably practical, but dislikes the inconvenience and bristles at
the implicit suggestion some campers aren't responsible or cautious
when dealing with cooking fires or barbecues.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see the reason for [the ban]," she said. "But I don't have
to like it."</TE>
<TE>   The ban comes a little more than two weeks after crews
extinguished the Wolf fire, which burned nearly 23,000 acres in Los
Padres. Authorities have not determined the cause of the fire, which
cost more than $15 million to fight and clean up.</TE>
<TE>   A look at the forestry lands shows why officials are warning that
this is one of the most dangerous fire seasons in years: At the
Wheeler Gorge campsite Tuesday, brittle leaves littered a parched
ground. A once-flowing creek trickled past and hillsides had taken on
fall hues of orange, red and brown.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't take much to set this place off," said William Wait,
surveying his surroundings. "In August or September, I don't know if
I'd even come over here."</TE>
<TE>   The extremely dry conditions have also prompted forest officials
to limit cigarette smoking to inside vehicles and buildings,
developed campgrounds or sites with at least three feet of clearance.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, I think the public has been expecting us to make
this announcement," said Kathy Good, a Los Padres spokeswoman. "We
can't afford to let a fire get established."</TE>
<TE>   Campers still have alternatives to campfires, such as picnicking
or using portable stoves, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still lots of ways to have fun," Good said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the ban may spoil some of the ambience, hardy campers
will make do, said Alex Washington, a Chatsworth resident who makes
an annual Fourth of July trip to the Wheeler Gorge campgrounds with
his family.</TE>
<TE>   The family said they understand the need for precautions. On this
trip, they were cooking with a propane stove and playing rummy at
night by flashlight and propane lamp.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything to keep the forest safe," Washington said.</TE>

<HD>Dr. Norman A. Gale, 88; Pioneered the Use of Tetanus
Inoculations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Norman A. Gale, 88, a San Diego physician who helped cut tetanus
deaths in the 1950s and made house calls and worked seven days a week
until his retirement in January, died June 13 of respiratory failure
at Scripps Mercy Hospital, where he had been on staff for 54 years.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Topeka, Kan., the Eagle Scout earned his medical degree at
the University of Kansas and spent World War II as an Army physician
attached to the 77th Evacuation Hospital. He served in England and
the Sicilian and North African campaigns, landed on Utah Beach in
Normandy after D-day and joined U.S. troops in Belgium at the Battle
of the Bulge.</LD>
<LD>   During the war, he learned the effectiveness of mass inoculations
to prevent tetanus, commonly called lockjaw, which is contracted from
organisms in soil that enter the body through open wounds. After
servicemen were inoculated during the war, Gale recalled in a 1955
speech to the American College of Surgeons, a mere 12 cases of
tetanus occurred. He later used the inoculation concept in San Diego,
dramatically reducing the mortality rate of the disease.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to his duties at Scripps, Gale served as chief of
medicine at Sharp Memorial Hospital in San Diego and was assistant
superintendent at what is now UC San Diego Medical Center. Disliking
elevators, he daily climbed, until his retirement, 11 flights of
stairs at Scripps and seven flights to his downtown San Diego office.
When he made house calls to elderly patients, he frequently took
along treats, such as a strawberry milkshake or fresh tomatoes.</TE>

<HD>Bridie Letzer, 78; Former Political Prisoner, Civil Rights
Activist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bridie Letzer, 78, who as a teenager was imprisoned in her native
Belfast for possessing a political leaflet and later became a
crusader for civil rights there and in the U.S., died June 25 in
Northridge of undisclosed causes.</LD>
<LD>   In 1939, the 15-year-old watched her brother sent to prison by the
British in their native Northern Ireland. Soon afterward, someone
handed her a leaflet denouncing such internments and demanding the
release of those jailed for no crime. The flier was found in her
pocket, and she was sentenced to three years at hard labor in a
women's prison. Only the ability of the Irish people to laugh, help
each other and hope, Letzer often said, enabled her to keep her
dignity and endure the suffering.</LD>
<LD>   After she came to Los Angeles in 1946 as the bride of an American
soldier, she became a leader among Southern California's Irish
Americans and a staunch advocate for civil rights around the world.
She went daily to the British Consulate to protest the ongoing
conflict in Northern Ireland. She also campaigned for fair employment
practices by American companies doing business in Northern Ireland.</LD>
<TE>   Letzer also protested apartheid in South Africa and worked for
black and Latino rights in the U.S.</TE>

<HD>State Is Ready for Holiday Trouble</HD>
<DH>Safety: Officials plan to increase security staffing though
there are no confirmed threats of terrorist activity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Security officials Tuesday assured Californians that the state's
anti-terrorist machinery is prepared for trouble during the Fourth of
July holiday, but the only threat so far is a convention of Hells
Angels motorcyclists.</LD>
<LD>   George Vinson, homeland security advisor to Gov. Gray Davis,
Highway Patrol Commissioner D.O. "Spike" Helmick and state Emergency
Services Director Dallas Jones called a news conference to report
that they knew of no terrorist threats to the state.</LD>
<LD>   But, as a precaution, they said, beefed-up forces of state and
local law enforcement officers, firefighters, public health
specialists and other emergency response personnel will be ready to
pounce on any terrorist activity.</LD>
<TE>   They discussed California's preparedness to prevent or respond to
terrorist acts as highly publicized but unconfirmed reports continued
to circulate that terrorists might be planning an attack against the
United States on Independence Day.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no--I've got to emphasize--no specific threat information
over July 4 here in California. But that doesn't mean we can go to
sleep," Vinson said.</TE>
<TE>   He called the state "well-prepared."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that, since Sept. 11, California has adopted terrorist
prevention and deterrence plans and refined state and local level
emergency responses.</TE>
<TE>   The state has also established a Sacramento-based law enforcement
network to collect and share terrorist intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Even though no credible threat had been uncovered, Helmick said,
the CHP will put a "maximum force" of about 6,000 officers on duty
during the holiday, order its 30 airplanes and helicopters into the
air for round-the-clock surveillance and pay special attention to
bridges in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Helmick and Vinson said that the only immediate threat to safety
and peace during the holiday may be the fifth annual convention of
Hells Angels in the dusty Central California farm town of Hollister.</TE>
<TE>   Helmick estimated about 70,000 riders would attend the event.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials had expressed concern about public
safety in Hollister against the backdrop of a fatal gun battle in
April between Hells Angels and rival Mongols at a casino in Laughlin,
Nev.</TE>
<TE>   Two Angels and a Mongol were killed, 16 people were injured and a
third Angel member was shot dead as he left town.</TE>

<KH>THE SECESSION QUESTION</KH>
<HD>Breakup Backers Undeterred by Poll Results</HD>
<DH>Reaction: Those seeking Hollywood and Valley cityhood
dismiss survey. But L.A. officials see evidence that bids to split
the city are failing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pointing to the results of a new Los Angeles Times poll, city
officials Tuesday labeled Hollywood secession a flop and said the San
Fernando Valley breakaway effort is already stalling months before
the Nov. 5 vote.</LD>
<LD>   Secessionists countered that their campaigns are just getting
underway and wrote off the poll results as irrelevant.</LD>
<LD>   In Hollywood, Hollywood VOTE founder Gene La Pietra held a festive
ribbon-cutting to open the offices of his new Hollywood Independence
Committee, and said over the strains of a live band that he wasn't
going to win just Hollywood's freedom, but that he would soon start a
parallel campaign--to break Hollywood schools out of the Los Angeles
Unified School District.</LD>
<TE>   "A poll is a poll. You're going to have a poll every week from now
till Nov. 5," he told a small gathering of supporters at an office
strip he owns on Santa Monica Boulevard, now painted bright red,
white and blue and decorated with stars and large letters reading,
"Hollywood Independence.com."</TE>
<TE>   He invited Los Angeles residents to come see the current state of
Hollywood for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Once they see how neglected Hollywood has been, and how ignored
it has been by the city of Los Angeles, they're going to support this
as the right thing to do," he said of secession. "These polls will
change like the tide coming in off the ocean."</TE>
<TE>   Valley secession supporters struck a similar theme: "We are
confident that when voters have the real facts--not just the spin of
the downtown power brokers--they will choose independence," said
Laurette Healey, co-chairwoman of the San Fernando Valley
Independence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The Times poll showed that fewer than a quarter of Hollywood
voters support the secession of their area, and that 59% of voters
citywide are against it. Meanwhile, Valley secession, leading 52% to
37% in the Valley, is lagging citywide, with 47% of voters opposed
and 38% in favor.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn Encouraged</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn called the numbers encouraging.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought the support was there for Hollywood secession,"
he said. "Clearly people are not happy being stuck in that boundary."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Eric Garcetti, who represents much of Hollywood, said
he is eager for a secession election. "To use a Hollywood analogy, it
feels like this blockbuster we all heard about is turning into a big
flop," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Union Joins Opposition</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, the union representing Los Angeles police officers
announced its opposition to secession, asserting that public safety
would be jeopardized if the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood broke
away.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Protective League joins several other unions
representing city workers that have said they will oppose secession.</TE>
<TE>   "After careful study, the [league] has come to the conclusion that
the answer to Los Angeles' crime problems clearly isn't secession,"
said union President Mitzi Grasso. "If secession passes, the public
will get less police services. If they want 'same level service,' it
will cost them more."</TE>
<TE>   Valley secession leaders predict that an independent city would
have better police services as it gained local control of deployment
and streamlined city bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said poll results for Valley secession indicate
that people are beginning to see the pitfalls of leaving Los Angeles
behind.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the trend from previous polls, it's moving in the
direction that indicates the more you know about secession, the less
you like about it," said City Council President Alex Padilla, who
represents the East Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the Valley's homeowner and chamber of commerce groups
who support secession dismissed the poll, saying support for the
breakup movement is much stronger than indicated.</TE>
<TE>   "The poll in no way reflects the sentiments of the hundreds of
people I've spoken with who are fed up" with L.A.'s bloated
bureaucracy and unfair treatment of the Valley, said Gerald A.
Silver, a retired community college professor and president of
Homeowners of Encino.</TE>
<TE>   But Don Schultz, president of the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn. and a
former secessionist, called the results "an eye-opener."</TE>
<TE>   "I see the secession movement starting to slow," said Schultz, who
last month came out against breaking away because he believed that
Van Nuys was slighted in the council districting plans for a new
Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't seem like secession would be better for Van Nuys," said
Schultz, who supports a borough plan being considered by City Hall.
"If we can make L.A. a better city, why not keep it together?"</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the City Council voted Tuesday to formally request that
the Local Agency Formation Commission reconsider putting Hollywood
secession on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, city officials said LAFCO's proposal to have the
Hollywood city pay the remainder of Los Angeles $21.3 million the
first year to cover the revenue lost in the split is inadequate. Los
Angeles would need $86 million to $100 million to be made financially
whole, a consultant for the city said.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at Tuesday's council meeting as he was being confirmed
for a city commission post, honorary Hollywood mayor Johnny Grant
said the secession movement is on its last legs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they peaked already and [support] will go even lower," he
said. "The people of Hollywood just want to remain a part of the city
of L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood secession campaign has been propelled by the money
and efforts of La Pietra, a millionaire nightclub owner who says he
wants to be mayor of a new city of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Street Campaign</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, he said he would start sending several hundred people
out on the streets each day to talk to Hollywood residents and would
continue to pour cash into the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll spend at least $1 million and whatever it takes to make it
happen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra said that in the next couple of weeks, Hollywood
secessionists will begin collecting signatures for Hollywood schools
to split from L.A. Unified. He expressed hope that such a proposal
could be placed on the ballot soon.</TE>
<TE>   The odds are against him.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires school secession activists to collect
signatures of 8% of those who voted within the proposed new district
during the most recent gubernatorial election at the time they began
circulating petitions.</TE>
<TE>   Once signatures were collected and verified, the 11-member Los
Angeles County Committee on School District Organization would study
the issue, hold public hearings and submit the proposal and a
recommendation to the state. State officials would then study the
issue further, hold hearings and, finally, decide whether to call an
election.</TE>
<TE>   Within the last few years, the state has rejected proposals for
Lomita and the San Fernando Valley to split from the Los Angeles
Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   A plan to remove Carson's schools from the district made it to the
ballot, but was rejected by voters.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Police Check Links to Man Held in Ex-Agent's Death</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laguna Beach police began checking Tuesday on whether a drifter
accused of torturing and killing a retired immigration agent in his
Santa Ana-area apartment also robbed gay men in the Laguna Beach
area.</LD>
<LD>   The attempt to link Gregory Michael Pisarcik to crimes in Laguna
Beach and other south Orange County beach cities came after his
arrest in the death of Narciso P. Leggs Jr., a former immigration
agent whose bound and partially dismembered body was found Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Jim Amormino, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's
Department, which has primary jurisdiction in the investigation,
would not elaborate on why detectives suspect Pisarcik was targeting
gay men.</LD>
<TE>   Sgt. Jason C. Kravetz said the Laguna Beach Police Department was
trying to determine whether any of its cases might be connected to
Pisarcik, and also was asking anyone who might have had contact with
him to come forward.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely something we should look into," Kravetz said.
"Right now we don't know of any robberies we can attribute to this
guy.... There's a chance a victim may come forward who previously
didn't report anything."</TE>
<TE>   Pisarcik, 25, was being held without bail Tuesday and was
scheduled to be arraigned today on murder and robbery charges in the
death of Leggs, who worked as a supervisory detention and deportation
officer before retiring from the INS in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The two men apparently met in recent weeks in downtown Laguna
Beach. Leggs, 53, owned a limousine firm that once provided service
there.</TE>
<TE>   Pisarcik, a transient who grew up in New Jersey and has stayed on
and off with friends and relatives in Ojai and Orange, has no record
in Laguna Beach but a history of theft and narcotics arrests and
convictions elsewhere, according to records.</TE>
<TE>   Leggs is believed to have been killed inside his garage apartment
on Irvine Boulevard in an unincorporated area near Santa Ana. His
body was found by sheriff's deputies Saturday after Leggs' landlord
called police because he hadn't seen his tenant for two days.</TE>
<TE>   Leggs was bound, gagged and tortured, police said.</TE>
<TE>   He died from a blow to the head, officers said.</TE>
<TE>   His apartment was ransacked and some of his property stolen,
including a 1994 Lincoln Town Car.</TE>

<LD>Dist. Atty. Thomas Sneddon wants county supervisors to consider a
lawsuit against the state for what he described as a "raid" on county
funds by the state.</LD>
<LD>   Sneddon said in a letter to supervisors that he was outraged by
the state's effort to assess the county more than $1 million to pay a
portion of a multimillion-dollar fine levied against California by
the federal government.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government is penalizing California for not

<LD>Lawyers for the wife of Rep. Gary Condit (D-Ceres) and the National
Enquirer are wrangling about whether the tabloid legally can be
called a "newspaper."</LD>
<LD>   The Enquirer wants Carolyn Condit's pending $10-million libel case
thrown out because she never demanded a retraction before suing. She
filed suit in February, accusing the tabloid of libel for an Aug. 7
headline that stated she attacked Chandra Levy. State law gives
papers a chance to correct mistakes by printing corrections or
retractions before suits are filed.</LD>

<LD>   The falloff in lodging industry profits--a 19.4% drop industrywide

before running over her in the couple's van outside the Tarzana post
office, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Sophie Jennie Rodriguez, 38, was rushed to Northridge Hospital
Medical Center in critical condition after the attack, which took
place about 5:20 a.m. in the 18700 block of Philiprimm Street, LAPD
homicide Det. Rick Swanston said.</LD>
<LD>   The victim's husband, Daniel Sada, 53, was arrested at their
Sylmar home on suspicion of attempted murder. He was being held at
the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley Division jail in lieu
of $500,000 bail, and authorities said he will be arraigned Friday in
Van Nuys Superior Court.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses told police they saw Sada, a U.S. Postal Service
employee, pull up in his van across the street from the Tarzana post
office, Swanston said. Moments later, Sada allegedly pulled a
screaming woman from the van.</TE>
<TE>   "She was lying in the street when he produced a pipe and began
hitting her with it," Swanston said. "When witnesses yelled to the
man to stop, he jumped back in the van and drove west on Philiprimm
Street." Police said he turned the van around and allegedly began
speeding back toward the post office, "deliberately running over the
victim," Swanston said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they traced the van to Sada using a partial
license plate number provided by a witness. Postal service
spokeswoman Terri Bouffiou said Sada, a 29-year employee, worked at
the Santa Clarita mail processing plant.</TE>

<HD>Design Flaw Shuts Down Magic Mountain Ride</HD>

<LD>Magic Mountain's newest thrill ride will be shut down indefinitely as
ride engineers work on a design flaw on one of the 28 coach seats
that twist, spin and flip riders while moving at 76 mph, park
officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "It was not riding as efficiently as we would have liked it to,"
park spokesman Andy Gallardo said about the "X" ride, which opened in
January.</LD>
<LD>   The ride, which features 360-degree turns and 200-foot drops, was
shut down three weeks ago after maintenance crews noticed one of the
coach seats, which spin riders upside-down, was not moving smoothly,
Gallardo said. The problem was expected to be fixed soon but has
taken longer than anticipated, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Amusement ride inspectors with the state Division of Occupational
Safety and Health are scheduled to check the ride July 19 after
modifications are completed, said Susan Gard, a Cal/OSHA spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County building and safety officials also conduct
inspections at Six Flags Magic Mountain every 90 days, and amusement
park maintenance crews watch daily for safety or operational
problems, Gallardo said.</TE>
<TE>   Research is underway to determine whether fast-moving thrill rides
have a connection to brain injuries.</TE>
<TE>   A 28-year-old Fontana woman died in June 2001 shortly after riding
Goliath, another Magic Mountain roller coaster. Her parents filed a
wrongful death lawsuit in May.</TE>
