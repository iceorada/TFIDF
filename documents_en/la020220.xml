<HD>Mixed Verdict Returned in James Brown Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Brown was cleared of sexual harassment and emotional distress
allegations Tuesday morning in a civil lawsuit brought by former
employee Lisa Ross Agbalaya, but the jury found Brown's company, the
James Brown Enterprises Inc., had wrongfully terminated Agbalaya.
Brown was at home in South Carolina as the verdict was read, but his
lawyer, Debra Opri, immediately reached him by phone. The Godfather
of Soul wept when he heard the news, Opri said.</LD>
<LD>   "We won! We won! We won!" Opri announced to waiting reporters.
Agbalaya, who had listened to the verdict with eyes closed, took
comfort from her parents and her husband. "It was certainly a
disappointment given the evidence," said Agbalaya's attorney Matthew
Herrell. "We have absolute confidence in the honesty of our client."
He added, "the bottom line is, we got a wrongful termination
verdict."</LD>
<LD>   The jury was scheduled to determine the amount of damages on
Tuesday afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   Opri told reporters she plans to appeal that verdict. "The jury
agreed with our position that this was a frivolous lawsuit and the
only cause of action for wrongful termination was against a company
that was not an originally named defendant," she said. Opri contends
that Agbalaya's suit wasn't valid because she didn't use the
company's legal name in the complaint. She called it The New James
Brown Enterprises Inc.--James Brown West, not James Brown Enterprises
Inc., Opri said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Agbalaya's attorneys amended their complaint with the
legal name, Opri intends to appeal the verdict based on the original
suit, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a glitch," she said. "It's easy to overturn on appeal."</TE>
<TE>   Agbalaya, who managed Brown's West Coast operations, testified
that from July 1999 to February 2000, Brown repeatedly made unwanted
sexual advances and that when she refused them, she was fired.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has denied Agbalaya's allegations and says he fired her
because financial troubles forced him to close his West Coast office.</TE>
<TE>   Agbalaya's suit demanded $2 million for sexual harassment,
wrongful termination, and intentional infliction of emotional
distress.</TE>
<TE>   Designing Man</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Sandell blew out the candles of his birthday cake, blushing
slightly. "Yeah, I'm turning 25," he said. "Again."</TE>
<TE>   The birthday boy may not be a household name in the United States
yet, but in Europe, the Swedish designer is a rising star of
architecture, and he's determined to export his vision of sleek but
functional design to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Sandell, who actually turned 43, was honored Sunday evening by a
dozen of his countrymen at the Santa Monica home of Andreas Ekman,
the Swedish consul general. After a three-course dinner, Sandell
chatted about contemporary inspirations. Frank Gehry's name came up,
and Rem Koolhaas was mentioned. "Yeah," said Sandell with a smile,
"he's the rock star of architecture."</TE>
<TE>   But Sandell, who Tuesday was to give a speech to students in
Pasadena, joked that his talk would feature another noted architect:</TE>
<TE>   "Me, myself and I."</TE>
<TE>   A Laughing Matter</TE>
<TE>   "Un-Cabaret" has never been about punch lines, said comedian Bob
Odenkirk, and he wasn't joking.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, at this Hollywood institution, the story's the thing as
performers like Odenkirk mine the humor in what some might describe
as the most pathetic and embarrassing parts of their personal lives.
"I'm really dreading the CD," he said, referring to the newly
released "Beth Lapides' Un-Cabaret--The Un &amp; Only," which features
live recordings of performances by Odenkirk, Andy Dick, Merrill
Markoe, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his trepidations about the CD, Odenkirk had showed up for
its release party Saturday night in Hollywood, as had Julia Sweeney,
who was wearing a Truthseekers sweatshirt. The Sweeney bit
immortalized on the CD is titled: "I recently started having sex
again," and such candor is typical at Un-Cabaret. The confessional
nature of the show provides Sweeney with details about her
colleagues' current travails and obsessions. "I know everything," she
said. "It's almost like a newsletter."</TE>
<TE>   City of Angles runs Tuesday through Friday.

<DL></DL>
<LD>The kids are getting a little older now, and we all behave more and
more like the cast of "Friends"--thrown together on some overstuffed
couch, draping our legs over the ends of the furniture and poking
fingers into each other's midriffs, checking for pregnancies and poor
nutrition. There's my wife, Jennifer Aniston. Me, an aging Matthew
Perry. But shorter. Less smirky. Together, we watch these Olympic
Games.</LD>
<LD>   "You pregnant, Dad?" some kid asks after poking me in the stomach.</LD>
<LD>   "Don't even suggest it," her mother says.</LD>
<TE>   "Your mother doesn't think pregnancy is funny," I tell them.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing good has ever come of pregnancy, except of course for you
and me and a few of our choicest friends. Otherwise, pregnancy brings
only heartbreak and hardship, poverty and long, achy nights on the
couch. Eventually, childbirth.</TE>
<TE>   On the positive side, pregnancy offers you children, two of whom
are on the couch with us now, also behaving like the cast of
"Friends," the pampered children of the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   "He is so gifted in the air," Scott Hamilton is saying of some
figure skater.</TE>
<TE>   "Gifted?" asks the boy.</TE>
<TE>   "Yep, I think he said gifted," I say.</TE>
<TE>   The TV, on long winter nights, is like an extra fireplace. We warm
our hands by it. We warm our thoughts by it. With the Olympics in
full stride, we gather around this flickering fire and watch the
world.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone looks like the Americans now," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "They do?" the little girl asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, Tom Cruise," I say.</TE>
<TE>   On TV, there's this Russian figure skater with Tom Cruise hair.
Used to be, you could tell the Eastern Bloc athletes by their severe,
soldierly haircuts. No more. Now the Eastern Europeans have Hollywood
hair, the flowing tresses of cocker spaniels.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes!" says Scott Hamilton as the skater nails a quadruple jump.</TE>
<TE>   I like figure skating the way I like toy poodles and Sheena Easton
songs, which is to say I struggle to quell the violent spasms they
trigger in me. As a pampered parent of the 21st century, it's up to
me to set a good example.</TE>
<TE>   "You're grinding your teeth," my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at that shirt," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty, that shirt," my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a blouse," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't the Laker game on?" asks the boy.</TE>
<TE>   "The Laker game's over," my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   Skating. You really think this is what the Greeks had in mind?
Outdoors, other Olympic competitors are skiing through forests and
shooting guns. On mountainsides, the ski jumpers are gliding off the
edges of the Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, Hansel and Gretel are twirling on ice, then crying when
things go wrong. Talk about your pampered children.</TE>
<TE>   "And if they found malfeasance on the part of judges, what then?"
asks the ever-earnest Bob Costas, our commissioner of television.</TE>
<TE>   What then? I want to shout, "THE WORLD WILL END, THE WORLD WILL
END!" But I don't. This is more serious than that.</TE>
<TE>   You may have heard about this skating fuss. What happened, I
think, is that Hansel and Gretel, a pair of skaters from some
snowbound nation to the north, were robbed of Olympic gold, creating
the biggest international incident since, probably, the Crusades.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, they receive their own gold medals. And the world is
right again.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone should get gold medals," I say.</TE>
<TE>   There is no escaping these Winter Games. You leave the couch, go
off to work, and a TV is crackling in the corner of the newsroom with
three people surrounding it, practicing their wisecracks.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got his mojo working today!" a TV commentator says after a
dazzling snowboard run.</TE>
<TE>   "My mojo's in the shop," one of my co-workers says.</TE>
<TE>   "I never could work my mojo," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Picabo Street?" asks another colleague. "Did she name herself?"</TE>
<TE>   My co-workers and I watch the biathlon, the sport you keep
expecting Leslie Nielsen to show up in. And something called curling,
a sort of bar game played with brooms and a giant tea pot. In
Switzerland, it's more popular than sex.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I found my Olympic event," I say as two guys chase a
curling stone with brooms and maybe some Windex.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Winter Olympics are lovable mostly for the charming
assortment of arcade games that pass for sports.</TE>
<TE>   In the biathlon, you ski, then stop to shoot stuff. In curling,
you slide a tea kettle across an icy surface.</TE>
<TE>   They are like games you made up as a kid on long rainy weekends
when your parents made the mistake of leaving you home alone with
your wilder friends.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes!" an announcer says when the curling stone nudges the
bull's-eye.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes!" I say when a biathlon competitor hits three of her targets.</TE>
<TE>   On the way for coffee, another colleague passes, pauses, then
tilts her head to listen to the TV.</TE>
<TE>   "What's that noise? Sports?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   That's music, actually, two announcers breathlessly describing the
end of the women's cross-country race, where a beautiful Russian
finishes with a little bit of frozen spittle frosting her lovely
chin.</TE>
<TE>   "Noise?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   No way.</TE>

<LD>Olympic Athletes:</LD>
<LD>   How Fast Are They?</LD>
<LD>   In Olympic sports such as skiing, speedskating and bobsledding,
performances are measured in minutes, seconds, tenths and hundredths
of a second, but how fast do you think the athletes are really going?
Can a speedskater travel as fast as a car?</LD>
<TE>   The distance of most Olympic events is measured in meters. Car
speed in the United States is measured in miles per hour (mph).</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, American speedskater Dan Jansen won the gold medal in
men's 1,000 meters in 1 minute, 12.43 seconds, setting a world
record. Let's figure out how many miles per hour he averaged.</TE>
<TE>   Step 1: Calculate the distance in feet (multiply 1,000 meters by
3.28084 feet).</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: Convert the distance in feet into miles (divide the number
of feet by 5,280).</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Calculate Jansen's time in seconds (1 minute x 60 seconds
+ 12.43 seconds).</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Convert the time in seconds into hours (divide the number
of seconds by 3,600).</TE>
<TE>   Step 5: Divide distance in miles (the answer from step 2) by the
time in hours (the answer from step 4) to figure speed in mph.</TE>
<TE>   Using this formula, figure the miles per hour for other Olympic
athletes by reading about their performances in the Sports section.</TE>
<TE>   This newspaper-based lesson and many others are available to
teachers at no cost through sponsorships by Times subscribers and
local businesses. For more information, call The Times in Education
office in your area: San Fernando Valley, (818) 772-3477; Los
Angeles/San Gabriel Valley, (213) 237-4342; Orange County/Inland
Empire, (714) 966-7558; or visit www.latimes.comTIE.</TE>
<TE>   ANSWERS: 1: 3,280.84 ft. 2: .6213712 mile. 3: 72.43 seconds. 4:
.0201194 hour. 5: 30.884181 mph. Rounding to the nearest mile,
Jansen's 1994 gold medal speed was 31 mph, about the speed your car
travels on the way to school.</TE>

<LD>"No presents!" Nancy says. "But please stop over and celebrate. We
have been waiting for this moment for so long."</LD>
<LD>   I wouldn't miss it for the world. It's the day Nancy and Jack's
son becomes, officially, Nancy and Jack's son. It's Baby Benjamin's
Adoption Day. He's almost a year old now; he was placed in Nancy's
arms just minutes after birth. For adoptive parents, especially those
who adopt domestically, there is always this holding-of-the-breath
period. There is paperwork. There are parental rights to terminate.
There are lawyers and there are clerks and there are forms and there
are fees. Depending on the level of cooperation of all the people
involved, the limbo can carry you well beyond the limits of your
personal sanity zone.</LD>
<LD>   We never worried that this day wouldn't come for Nancy and Jack
and Benjamin. Not really, anyway. It's not something you allow
yourself to think, let alone say. The more we got to know Benjamin,
and the more we got used to the sight of him occupying his rightful
spot on Nancy's left hip, the more each of us knew, privately, that
there was nothing we wouldn't do to keep this family intact. Look
out, lawyers. Look out, judges.</LD>
<TE>   Nancy tells me that Beth has offered to bring her signature
lasagna. The same lasagna she made when we gathered to paint the
nursery awaiting Benjamin. The same lasagna she made, as a matter of
fact, when we all painted the nursery awaiting my daughter. Mind you,
Beth's repertoire extends several light-years beyond lasagna, but
somehow she has made this dish our traditional meal of baby
welcoming.</TE>
<TE>   I tell Nancy I'll bring the salad. She says B.K. has offered to
bring champagne, and that Ellen plans to stop at a fancy bakery to
pick up a fancy dessert.</TE>
<TE>   When we arrive at Nancy's we all marvel again at how huge Benjamin
has gotten. He's an 11-month-old baby in size 2T clothes. He's here
on Nancy's hip, and Jack is one step behind, and the two of them are
going on and on about what happened in family court, about what the
judge said, about the way the cop in the courtroom stepped out from
behind his serious cop-face, actually got teary-eyed, and said,
"Congratulations!" and then handed Benjamin a toy sheriff's star.</TE>
<TE>   It's choking us all up, hearing this story. It's just exactly how
we imagined it, only better. And Benjamin, he's wriggled down from
Nancy's hip and crawled into the adjoining room, where my daughter
has hold of his toy lawn mower. Pretty soon we settle into chairs,
and Jack and my husband head off to play with the toy lawn mower, and
the subject of conversation switches away from Benjamin and onto more
mundane matters of movies to see and vacations to take and even,
quietly, whispers of boyfriend possibilities for B.K.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey," says Nancy, looking around. "This is like a Girls' Night
Out, except with kids and men in the background."</TE>
<TE>   She's right. And that isn't right. This is supposed to be Baby
Benjamin's Adoption Day!</TE>
<TE>   Then again, maybe it's exactly right. The anticlimax is as fitting
as it is magnificent. Baby Benjamin's Adoption Day, as it turns out,
is just another day. Because he's one of us. Just another one of us.
We don't need a judge to proclaim it. But this child has been one of
us since the day he was born.</TE>
<TE>   "So let's eat," Beth says. She's heated up the lasagna and is now
standing before us, her hands protected by thick, cheerful
potholders. It's funny to see how Beth, the one among us who has
stated that she never wants children, has become our group's mom. How
did that happen? It's funny, too, to see how Nancy and I, the only
moms of our group, remain the somewhat scatterbrained children. And
B.K. is the wise middle child with a philosophy brewing in her head.
And Ellen, flitting in and flitting out, leaving us for 18 months at
a time, is like the big sister off at college, always out there,
always exploring, and always coming home.</TE>
<TE>   How did this family happen? No two people in this room share a
biological brother or aunt or even a distant cousin. And yet we've
been a family for well over a decade now.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about adoption. Maybe we should get a lawyer. Maybe we should
fill out forms and pay fees to a nice judge who can make it official.
Then again, maybe we should just skip all of that and have some of
Beth's lasagna.</TE>

<HD>Playing Up Raggedy Ann</HD>
<DH>The doll's fans are on a mission to win her a spot in the
Toy Hall of Fame.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN REIMER</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What does Barbie have that Raggedy Ann doesn't? Besides the hourglass
figure and all those accessories?</LD>
<LD>   How cuddly is a Tonka truck? Has anyone ever written the
adventures of the Hula-Hoop?</LD>
<LD>   The fact is that all of these toys have what the beloved rag doll
does not: a place in the National Toy Hall of Fame.</LD>
<TE>   "We love all toys, including Raggedy Ann," said Kim Baldwin,
spokeswoman for the Hall of Fame in Salem, Ore. "The fact is, she
just hasn't made the cut."</TE>
<TE>   Raggedy Ann fans are out to remedy this injustice with a
grass-roots petition drive to influence the voting of the 100
mysterious selectors who, each year since 1998, have decided which
toys make it into the Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   "This is her year," says Joni Gruelle Wannamaker, granddaughter of
Johnny Gruelle, creator of the Raggedy Ann and Andy series of books.
"People really need a lovable toy in this country right now. She is
needed this year."</TE>
<TE>   The National Toy Hall of Fame is located in A.C. Gilbert's
Discovery Village, a children's interactive museum established in
Salem to venerate the native son who was the inventor of the Erector
Set. (It bears noting that the Erector Set was inducted into the Toy
Hall of Fame in 1998, the first year of voting.)</TE>
<TE>   "Raggedy Ann has been on the nomination list several times," said
Baldwin, who welcomes the groundswell of support for a nominated toy.
"But there have been such a wide variety of toys. And there are so
many great toys."</TE>
<TE>   The Hall of Fame--where the toys are displayed--is located in one
of the historic homes where Gilbert played as a child. Its
administrators accept nominations for a full calendar year, and it
only takes one nomination to make the list. "We are looking for the
kind of toy that is an icon in American culture. It has to be safe
and inspire creative play," said Baldwin.</TE>
<TE>   Among the honorees are generic toys including the bicycle and the
jump rope, and branded toys including Lincoln Logs and Etch-a-Sketch.
"A new toy can get in if it is loved, but generally these are toys
that have been loved by generations," said Baldwin.</TE>
<TE>   The list of nominees, which numbers 90 this year, has been
distributed to a selection committee composed of educators, child
development experts and toy industry experts. But not toy
manufacturers, Baldwin is quick to add.</TE>
<TE>   Among the nominees this year is G.I. Joe. Many a girl who is a
woman now remembers how her brother tortured her Raggedy Ann with
Joe.</TE>
<TE>   The winners will be announced, with considerable fanfare, on March
27 at noon in Salem.</TE>
<TE>   Only the top vote-getters in a complicated point system make it
into the hall, and since the first year, when 11 made it, the number
of inductees has shrunk to a precious two last year: Silly Putty and
Tonka trucks.</TE>
<TE>   "We love the idea that there is a petition drive for Raggedy Ann,"
said Baldwin, who has heard that one of the petitions carries 3,000
names. "But unless the selectors hear about this, the petitions can't
have any effect on their voting. I mean, the selectors are scattered
all over the country."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Arcola, Ill., Gruelle's granddaughter presides over
the Raggedy Ann and Andy Museum with calm certainty that this is
Ann's year. "I have been thinking that it has just not been Raggedy
Ann's time until now," said Wannamaker.</TE>
<TE>   "Raggedy Ann has been a kind of cyclical doll since she was
created in 1915. Every 20 years or so, she experiences a kind of
upswing, and that is happening now."</TE>
<TE>   Gruelle, a newspaper and magazine illustrator, created a whimsical
drawing of a doll named Raggedy Ann in 1915 and pitched the idea of a
juvenile book about her adventures to a Chicago publisher. In 1918,
P.F. Volland Co. published Gruelle's "Raggedy Ann Stories" and
introduced a matching character doll. The rest is history.</TE>
<TE>   If Wannamaker is conflicted about anything, it is the fact that
she has never considered Ann a toy. She considers her a friend, a
companion. "We hear stories every day in the museum from people about
their adventures with her. She has been in fires, with soldiers in
all the wars.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you ever heard a story about someone going back into a
burning house for a Monopoly game?"</TE>
<TE>   Monopoly made it into the Hall of Fame in its first year.</TE>

<HD>The Otherwhere Ice Show</HD>
<DH>Part 3 The story so far: Molly is Cinderella in the Skate
Club Ice Show. Magnus the magician from Otherwhere says he can help
her do a perfect double axel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GAIL KIMBERLY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Now," Magnus said, "for the wicked stepmother and the ugly sisters."
He waved his whip, and the three little women were suddenly dressed
in hoop-skirted finery, makeup hardening their faces into scowls.</LD>
<LD>   The music changed to the Cinderella theme they would play in
Molly's show.</LD>
<LD>   "Are you ready?" Magnus asked her.</LD>
<TE>   Molly felt dazed. "No," she told Magnus. "Wait."</TE>
<TE>   "You're not ready? But you've been rehearsing to do Cinderella,
haven't you?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, but I'm having trouble with the double axel. I haven't had
time to practice and get it perfect." She didn't want Magnus to see
her stumble and fall.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to practice." Magnus waved his flashing whip above
her head.</TE>
<TE>   "There now, try your double axel."</TE>
<TE>   Molly hesitated. What if she messed up?</TE>
<TE>   "Go ahead," he told her, giving her a gentle push toward the
center of the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Molly glided around the pond, built up speed and leaped into two
perfect turns, then landed gracefully. She couldn't believe it had
been so easy.</TE>
<TE>   Could she do it again?</TE>
<TE>   She raced across the ice and into another perfect double axel,
feeling as dainty as a snowflake. The wicked stepmother and the two
ugly sisters applauded her and cheered.</TE>
<TE>   Magnus slapped his whip against his palm. "Are you ready to do the
show now? The audience is waiting."</TE>
<TE>   Molly was confused. What audience was Magnus talking about?</TE>
<TE>   He was already waving his magic whip and people were gathering
around the pond, murmuring and chatting as they settled into the rows
of benches.</TE>
<TE>   Molly blinked at them. Were they all people? Wasn't that a deer in
the front row with three owls perched on the seats behind it? It was
hard to tell with the spotlights shining in her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: What kind of ice show is this?</TE>
<TE>   Gail Kimberly lived in Ottawa, Canada, where she learned to skate.
But she never could do the double axel. This story will be on The
Times' Web site at www.latimes.comkids.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Way back in college, when I had a social conscience and a sense of
duty, I volunteered in a program teaching "educationally handicapped"
children to read and write.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't great shakes as far as saving humanity, but it may have
been a step in the right direction, and it did relieve some of the
guilt I felt about living with my parents in that house high on top
of Trousdale Estates in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Fifteen years later, I still have a certain idealism. And I do
believe in the need for the mighty to help the weak. In that spirit,
and long before President Bush came up with the same idea, I took my
"volunteer spirit" and looked for a place where my talents  will be
used for the common good.</LD>
<TE>   I was drawn to the library of one of my kids' private schools.
Certainly, I've had my doubts about the necessity of donating my time
and energy to a school that charges the equivalent of a small
country's gross domestic product as tuition every year, then demands
that each family participate "voluntarily" in the annual giving
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But even I, with my nonexistent mathematical ability, can see that
all the fabulous perks my child enjoys at this school--17 field trips
a year, parties in every classroom, a library that stocks every book
ever published (except for mine), and tennis courts that put
Wimbledon to shame--cannot possibly be paid for by mere tuition.</TE>
<TE>   Those perks are made possible through the hard work and ingenuity
of dedicated parents who are at least as busy as I am but who manage
to carve out a place in their lives for the good of others.</TE>
<TE>   I sign up to do my part, and soon I get a call from one of the
other volunteers telling me we're going to start twice-monthly
meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "Meetings?" I'm aghast. I'm a writer. The only meetings I have are
with the Starbucks staff in the morning before I head home to my
computer. "What kind of meetings?"</TE>
<TE>   "Mostly breakfast," she says, obviously missing the point, "7:30
on Monday mornings. Sometimes we'll have a working lunch."</TE>
<TE>   A working lunch? Like we're going to be so busy we can't find time
to eat before or after the meeting?</TE>
<TE>   She must have interpreted my silence for understanding.</TE>
<TE>   "The parent association president has passed along her wishes for
the year," she says, gaining momentum. She sounds like a Marine
commander in the field. "She wants six events a year, six of us on
the committee, one event per person, three months to plan."</TE>
<TE>   I feel the floor sinking.  This can't be so hard, I reassure
myself. I know books better than I know anything else.  I can
certainly negotiate my way through a school library stacking kids'
books.</TE>
<TE>   All summer long we meet and plan and devise strategies to make our
library more organized, better staffed, more welcoming to the
children. To me, the place looks pretty close to perfect as it is,
but I'm afraid to voice this to my committee co-chairs because they
may think me less of a perfectionist than I should be.</TE>
<TE>   So I stumble into the 7:30 a.m. meetings with my coffee and a
chocolate muffin, sit through the working lunches as everyone unpacks
salads while I eat a custard eclair. I watch the other moms flip
through leather-bound date books in which they have scheduled every
hair appointment, every baseball practice, and every one of their
thousand-and-three volunteer involvements for the next 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   The other moms are all perfectly made up, full of energy, brimming
with ideas. I have no date book, no energy and no hair appointments.
My kids don't play baseball or soccer. And I don't see why one
library needs six co-chairs and as many "events" per year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, we manage to conceive of four library events, plus a used
book drive and a new book drive to fulfill the parent association
president's wishes.</TE>
<TE>   "Do we need two separate book drives?" I ask, committing heresy by
questioning the president's authority. "Can't we have a single drive
and put the used and the new books in separate bins when they
arrive?"</TE>
<TE>   We're doing two book drives.</TE>
<TE>   We report to the library, unpack boxes of newly arrived books and
file them alphabetically on the shelves. I work Q-T. The Marine
commander does L-P. The woman who does U-Z is an anesthesiologist.
The person opening the boxes has just finished remodeling her house
with plans she drew when she was in architecture school.</TE>
<TE>   One afternoon I look at her and the others, abandon caution to the
wind, and venture an opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "You know," I say, "the school may be better off using each of us
in our own fields of expertise and hiring a college student to stack
the books."</TE>
<TE>   The Marine commander looks over at my section and pulls out a T
book I've misfiled with the S's. I seem to do this a lot--misfile
books, misunderstand orders, mistake a job that takes an entire day
when you're working for free for one that any normal person could
easily finish in an hour, if they were to be paid.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a lawyer in a big firm," says the commander, restacking the
errant book, then returning to her section without so much as a
pause. "Billed $500 an hour."</TE>
<TE>   Five-hundred dollars is what I've been offered by a women's
volunteer organization in Orange County to spend 36 hours straight
with their members, even sleeping in their digs, so I can tell them
privately about writing my last novel. Maybe I should take over the
L-Ps as well as the Q-Ts, and let the Marine commander go back to
practicing law.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't work there anymore," she tells me. I've noticed she has no
use for pronouns. "Quit my job so I'd be available to volunteer at
the school any time I was needed."</TE>
<TE>   She quit her job so she could be a volunteer? At the library?</TE>
<TE>   "Future of our children at stake," she explains, and the other
moms nod in agreement. Maybe it's because I'm a writer, and,
therefore, semi-unemployed most of the time. Or maybe it's because I
come from Iran, where most people spend most of their time looking
for jobs, but I always thought a job was a pretty good thing.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone can have a job," the Marine commander continues. "Not
everyone can be a good volunteer." I think that's why she has taken
my name off the list of library volunteers for next year. She
suggests I take the $500-sign-your-life-away offer from Orange
County. Or make a hair appointment. Or go back to writing.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Advocates of alternative fuel vehicles got a Valentine's Day present
last week when the Senate Finance Committee approved the Energy Tax
Incentives Act of 2002 and sent it to the full Senate for a vote.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, which also must go to the House, was introduced by
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and cosponsored by seven other
Republican senators, six Democrats and Vermont Independent James M.
Jeffords.</LD>
<LD>   It would provide $14.6 billion for a variety of alternative fuel
programs, including a $2-billion package of tax credits and
incentives for purchase of alternative fuel vehicles such as those
that run on natural gas or electricity. The measure also would
provide credits for fuel cells. Tax credits for purchase of such
vehicles would range from as little as $250 for a limited-use hybrid
to $40,000 for a fuel-cell or electric bus or heavy truck.</LD>
<TE>   A natural gas-powered passenger car such as Honda's Civic GX
probably would qualify for an incentive in the $2,500-$4,000 range;
battery-powered electric cars and light trucks would qualify for
credits of $4,000 to $6,000, and future fuel-cell vehicles could
qualify for up to $8,000. Efficient hybrid passenger cars such as the
Toyota Prius and the Honda Insight would qualify in the $2,000-$3,000
range, supporters of the bill say.</TE>
<TE>   The measure would provide credits of up to $130,000 for
installation of alternative fuel infrastructure--such as natural gas
pumps or electric recharging stations. It also provides tax credits
of up to 50 cents per gallon, or gallon-equivalent, for purchase of
alternate fuels such as natural gas, propane, hydrogen and methanol.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate is expected to take up the bill as early as Feb. 25.</TE>
<TE>   "The provision is in President Bush's budget, and for the first
time since 1997 it looks like success is in sight" for proponents of
tax credits for advanced vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles, said
Jason Mark, director of the Union of Concerned Scientists' Clean
Vehicle Program.</TE>
<TE>   Major supporters of the bill include UCS, Natural Resources
Defense Council and other major national environmental groups as well
as car makers Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co.</TE>

<HD>Keeping Light-Truck Models Fresh Has Become Crucial to the
Success of Many Manufacturers</HD>
<DH>Marketing* Regular updates are needed to keep ahead of the
competition in the increasingly hot sector.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With light-truck sales accounting for more than half of the U.S.
market, auto makers are finding they now must do with trucks what
they've been doing all along with passenger cars: update them
constantly.</LD>
<LD>   And when General Motors Corp., Dodge and Toyota Motor Corp.
unveiled a trio of new pickup truck models at the Chicago auto show
this month, it underscored the established players' need to keep
things fresh as new competition looms.</LD>
<LD>   "In pickups, you never used to see mid-cycle enhancements; they'd
be on the market for a decade or more" relatively unchanged, GM
spokesman Brian Akre said. "But as you have more and more new entries
and customers, design and fashion play a bigger role."</LD>
<TE>   Over the last decade, full-size pickups have evolved from
commercial-use products to personal products. People who choose a
truck as their everyday transportation "want something that has a
fair amount of fresh image as well as luxury features," said George
Peterson, president of consulting firm AutoPacific Inc. in Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   That means more intense competition as auto manufacturers seek to
grab consumers' attention--and their money--with high-profit,
full-size pickups.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese auto companies are investing heavily in developing
pickups--once exclusively the domain of U.S. brands--and one, the
Toyota Tundra, has taken a chunk out of the Americans' market share.</TE>
<TE>   With Toyota already in the game, Nissan is next up. It is planning
a full-size pickup truck and an SUV to be built at a plant under
construction in Mississippi. Honda has just opened an Alabama plant
to build large minivans and SUVs that also could produce full-size
pickups, a move the company is contemplating.</TE>
<TE>   Ford has updated its F-series pickup--the country's best-selling
vehicle of any type--several times since the model was introduced in
1996. After launching with a standard cab and an extended "supercab"
with a third door for rear access, Ford has come out with a
heavy-duty model, a four-door supercab, and a "super crew cab" with
four standard-size doors.</TE>
<TE>   Auto makers need many versions of their pickups because they have
become a family car in many households, said George Pipas, Ford's
director of sales analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Ford showed nothing new in Chicago, but it is deep into an
F-Series redesign expected to cost as much as $1.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   GM showed 2003 model Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup
trucks at the Chicago show that sported new headlights, taillights
and grilles as well as a few interior updates, including a front
passenger sensor that deactivates the air bag when a child or small
adult is in the seat.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler Group's Dodge division showed off the new Ram Heavy Duty
2500 and 3500 pickup trucks that sport the tougher "big rig" styling
of the light-duty 2002 Ram 1500.</TE>
<TE>   Dodge's engines for the heavy-duty models are a redesigned Cummins
turbo diesel with 203 horsepower and a massive 555 foot-pounds of
torque, and a 5.7-liter Hemi Magnum V-8 that puts out 345 horsepower.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota said it will begin building a sporty Tundra Stepside pickup
truck in August. The truck has a step built into the side of the load
bed, flared rear fenders, redesigned taillights and a new front end.</TE>
<TE>   All this is meant to keep attention on the players already in the
truck market and facing a fresh influx of competition.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Japanese may be late to the party, they're spending a
lot to win truck customers, "and we don't take the challenge
lightly," GM's Akre said.</TE>

<HD>Director Forges Ahead Despite Controversy and Death Threats</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARIAM FAM</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CAIRO, Egypt</DL>
<LD>Some see Inas el-Degheidi as a feminist fighting through her films
for the rights of Egyptian women. Others argue that Egypt's most
famous female director gets attention the easy way--by filming cheap
sex scenes. Islamic militants simply think El-Degheidi should be
dead, police say.</LD>
<LD>   As one of the first, and the few, women to have invaded what is a
male-dominated career, El-Degheidi is used to controversy.</LD>
<LD>   "I was the first to tackle subjects that were banned in the
cinema, so they shock people. Maybe in the future people will say,
'This woman was courageous,'" El-Degheidi said in an interview.</LD>
<TE>   Of militants, she said, "They say I've crossed the red lines in
art, and I say art knows no red lines."</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, police said a group of Islamic militants plotted
to kill El-Degheidi. The group's other targets, according to police
and prosecutors, included President Hosni Mubarak and Mohammed Sayed
Tantawi, the government-appointed head of Al-Azhar mosque and
university, one of Islam's oldest and most prominent institutions.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not take it seriously at first, and to be honest I felt
happy for a moment on hearing the news, because they put my name
among those of very important people and saw me as someone who can
change history," El-Degheidi said.</TE>
<TE>   A police offer to assign her guards convinced the director the
threat was serious. She says she refuses to knuckle under to
extremists or live in fear--she refused the guards.</TE>
<TE>   El-Degheidi argues that her movies advocate "defending women's
rights, women's feelings and dignity.</TE>
<TE>   "Our traditions, customs and maybe our religion--though it gave
women a lot--didn't make women equals of men in many aspects.... I am
not convinced of this. I can't be a follower," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her movies have covered such subjects as prostitution and selling
girls into marriage. One movie, "Disco, Disco," tackled the
educational system, drugs, homosexuality and extremism among youth.</TE>
<TE>   El-Degheidi studied at Egypt's Cinema Institute. Since her debut
as a director in 1984, she has directed 13 movies and won a number of
prizes at home and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   She caught the attention of critics and viewers alike with her
earlier movies, widely seen as both daring and important.</TE>
<TE>   Many argue, however, that in her later work El-Degheidi has
compromised art for commercialism, relying on scenes of scantily
dressed, sultry women and sexually loaded conversations in movies
that had poor, or no, story lines.</TE>
<TE>   Mahmoud Saad, a critic, said he's not against sex scenes in
context, but that the ones in recent El-Degheidi releases are
"somewhat disgusting" and that her recent movies play on viewers'
sexual instincts and offer no real message.</TE>
<TE>   El-Degheidi said that in life and in her movies, sex is "a main
drive" of people's behavior. She argued that society accepts sex
scenes from male directors but expects her, as a woman, to shy away
from them.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian critic Ali Abu Shadi said El-Degheidi is attacked because
she wants to change backward traditions. He said she could be  more
daring; for example, she tries to give her films moral endings so as
not to provoke people.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Shadi, a former government censor, said he hopes intellectuals
won't be cowed by assassination lists and won't--consciously or
unconsciously--censor themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Word of mouth about El-Degheidi's latest movie caused a stir even
before its release in January. "Memoirs of a Teenage Girl," which
El-Degheidi directed, wrote and produced, examines virginity and
premarital pregnancy through the story of a girl caught between her
conservative upbringing and a world of dreams where she meets her
Prince Charming.</TE>
<TE>   El-Degheidi stormed out of a recent discussion of the movie after
she came under fire from viewers who argued that it presents Egyptian
girls in a bad light and promotes immoral behavior.</TE>
<TE>   She said she was exploring the dilemma of girls "who are victims
of a society that lives with two personalities: You can do anything
wrong as long as it's not in public."</TE>
<TE>   Those who criticized the movie are people who "took it in a
Taliban-like way," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her views can be dangerous in a conservative and deeply religious
country.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, extremists killed anti-fundamentalist writer Farag Fouda.
In 1994, they stabbed and seriously wounded Nobel laureate Naguib
Mahfouz, who was accused of insulting Islam in one of his works.</TE>
<TE>   El-Degheidi, like many Egyptian liberals, charges that in an
attempt to appease fundamentalists, the government sometimes cracks
down on intellectuals, censoring and banning movies and books deemed
un-Islamic.</TE>
<TE>   The result, el-Degheidi argues, is that fundamentalists have gone
"wild," gained ground and infiltrated different fields because "they
are hiding behind religion."</TE>
<TE>   The alleged militants accused of targeting her currently face
trial but deny all charges. Whether they remain behind bars or are
freed doesn't concern El-Degheidi.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel I am doing anything wrong and I am not scared," she
said. "I'll continue my path the way I want to."</TE>

<HD>A Lord of the Dancers</HD>
<DH>The longtime cobbler built his flamenco and folklorico
reputation by hand, one shoe at a time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gonzalo Duran speaks about the shoes he makes as if they were his
children. See those boots of worn, gray leather? the diminutive
shoemaker asks at his cluttered shop in a garage behind his home in
Boyle Heights. Those boots danced a polka for Don Francisco on
"Sabado Gigante," the popular variety show on Spanish-language
television.</LD>
<LD>   Every pair tells a story in this old-fashioned workshop with its
vintage Singer sewing machines and foot molds made in Mexico. A
rickety wooden rack holds several pairs of tap shoes in suede of
shocking colors--hot pink and purple. Those are going to dance in
Oregon, he says proudly of his American creations. And over there,
those mod black ankle boots once kept beat to a credible "Hard Day's
Night" during a Beatles tribute show.</LD>
<LD>   "The sound you get is from my shoe," says Duran, who has fashioned
footwear by hand for 40 years in his Latino immigrant neighborhood
just east of downtown. "The dancers may guide them, but my shoe gives
it the flavor."</LD>
<TE>   Duran is part of a vanishing breed of craftsmen--cobblers who
design and create footwear by hand. With scarred and calloused
fingers, he draws outlines of his customers' feet on plain white
paper, then cuts out their tailored shape from large sheets of
leather, leaving scraps like cookie dough with holes in it. Special
instructions are written on yellow Post-it Notes, such as "Customer
wears orthotics due to surgery."</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican immigrant has built a reputation for his flamenco and
folklorico shoes, but he also takes custom orders for "Star Trek"
enthusiasts and Elvis impersonators. Customers come from as far away
as Fresno and Santa Barbara for a pair of Duran's shoes, crafted to
fit like slippers and last like cowboy boots. They may not be the
finest shoes in the world, some clients say, but they are among the
most comfortable and durable.</TE>
<TE>   Like a character from central casting, Duran, 78, looks the part
of the little old shoemaker from the Old World. Neatly dressed and
bespectacled, with a playful gleam in his eyes, Duran whistles as he
shuffles slowly around his workshop with the aid of an aluminum
walker. The device is a sign of his ailing health, along with the
custom shoes he made for himself, with elastic instead of laces to
allow for swelling in his feet. Since being hospitalized in September
for kidney failure, Duran has been receiving dialysis regularly. His
wheelchair is at the ready for longer treks, folded up in his shiny
new pickup truck.</TE>
<TE>   But he curses the contraptions, which now keep him from enjoying a
waltz or danzon, as he and his wife used to do at neighborhood dances
with their favorite seniors club, Amistad y Alegria, or Friendship
and Happiness.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to get rid of this thing," Duran says, taking a seat in
his small office and pushing the walker away with frustration. "I've
got too many things to do."</TE>
<TE>   Isabel, his wife of 59 years, wants her husband to stop designing
new shoes. The former seamstress worries that his hands are not as
steady as they used to be, so the blade slips and slices his fingers
when he's cutting patterns. His two workers, who have been with him
for more than 12 years, won't let him operate the heavier machines,
for his own safety.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't let me do anything anymore," he grumbles.</TE>
<TE>   Duran has been doing business in this barrio for 39 years, the
last 12 at his current location on East 4th Street, which he bought
as an empty lot. The walls of his small office, which is just off a
bedroom, are covered from floor to ceiling with photos of his
customers, including a few celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   Duran has made shoes for Los Lobos, the Chicano rock band, and for
Adam West, the original TV Batman. Michael Flatley, the flamboyant
"Lord of the Dance," autographed his photo with a dedication to "The
World's Greatest Shoemaker."</TE>
<TE>   Flatley would pull up in a limousine outside the modest shop,
recalls Duran, peeking out his open frontdoor to re-create the
surprise of seeing the luxury vehicle make a stop in the blue-collar
neighborhood. One time, Flatley ordered 11 pairs of dance shoes and
rewarded the shoemaker with prime seats to one of his shows.</TE>
<TE>   Making Footwear for Grass-Roots Clientele</TE>
<TE>   Most of Duran's clientele, though, is grass roots. He makes boots
for folklorico groups from nearby schools, for local mariachi singers
and ensembles and for the area's professional flamenco dancers.
Sadly, his wall also includes a small snapshot of the late Maria
Isabel Fernandez, a lovely teenage flamenco dancer whose violent
murder in 1999 shocked and rallied Southern California's Spanish
dance community.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Talavera, a leading flamenco instructor who was mentoring the
slain dancer, says many in L.A.'s flamenco world swear by Duran's
shoes. Although some still prefer to order directly from Spain,
Talavera says he likes Duran because he's affordable and accessible.
The personal service beats dealing with anonymous shoemakers in
Sevilla and getting stuck with an ill-fitting shipment.</TE>
<TE>   "Duran's the only one here in Los Angeles," says the
Whittier-based teacher, who leads two local flamenco groups. "Among
[Mexican] folklorico dancers, he's held in very high esteem."</TE>
<TE>   Anahi Armenta has been a customer since she started dancing
folklorico as a teenager at nearby Roosevelt High School. Now married
and the mother of a young son, Armenta came all the way from Corona
one recent afternoon to have a pair of shoes repaired by Duran.</TE>
<TE>   Not her white dancing shoes, which Duran made 11 years ago. Those
are still holding up just fine.</TE>
<TE>   "They fit to perfection," says Armenta, who's studying to be a
teacher and still performs with a folklorico group in Riverside. "So
I don't need to buy another pair."</TE>
<TE>   Satisfied customers make Duran a contented cobbler. But just as he
takes credit for their good performances, he also feels the shame of
missed steps.</TE>
<TE>   Once, he got dressed up to attend a folklorico concert in Santa
Monica where 30 young dancers were performing in his new shoes. The
proud craftsman took a conspicuous seat, quite pleased with
himself--until a heel was kicked loose and went flying across the
stage. Unable to bear the embarrassment, Duran got up and left the
auditorium, ripping off his tie in anger. Later, back at the shop, he
scolded his workers and ordered them to use longer nails.</TE>
<TE>   The first rule of shoe making: They must be made to last.</TE>
<TE>   Craft Learned From His Father</TE>
<TE>   Duran learned his craft as a boy from his father, Francisco, a
shoemaker in the rustic Durango town of Rosario, a few hours from
Parral, Chihuahua, where he was born. Those shoes had to be masisos,
strong enough to withstand hard hillside climbs along dusty roads.</TE>
<TE>   His father is now 103 and lives in Juarez, where the younger Duran
made cowboy boots before moving to California in 1954. "He's doing
better than me," he says of his father. "I've got to get around with
this piece of junk."</TE>
<TE>   Duran's mother died almost 20 years ago. It was at her funeral
that he vowed to quit his drinking and his ornery ways, he says. He
controlled his compulsive eating and lost 131 pounds off his old
burly self, which once weighed 316.</TE>
<TE>   He believes his quest for self-improvement made him a better
husband and father, not to mention a better businessman.</TE>
<TE>   Before, he admits, he was sometimes rude to his customers and
careless about their orders. Now, he aims to please.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to learn to love yourself and respect others," he says.
"In this job, I sometimes like--how do you say?-- a challenge. Un
reto. You understand? I want to make my customers happy. I want to
make shoes exactly the way they want them."</TE>

<CX>   Dancer's mentor--In a Feb. 20 Calendar story, flamenco dance
instructor Juan Talavera was misidentified as a mentor of slain flamenco
dancer Maria Isabel Fernandez. Though Fernandez was rehearsing with
Talavera's company before her death in 1999, her principal instructor was
Roberto Amaral.</CX>

<HD>Fuzzy Music Label Yields Whimsy and Creativity</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Drummer Peter Erskine calls his record company Fuzzy Music. And
unlike fuzzy math, it's an exemplary phrase, used to underscore
Erskine's belief in music "that does not fit the large corporate
record company way of thought or aesthetics." On Monday night at the
Temple Bar in Santa Monica, he put that belief into action in an
evening featuring two of Fuzzy Music's best-known bands: his own
Lounge Art Ensemble and the group 3prime.</LD>
<LD>   The Lounge Art Ensemble--a trio consisting of Erskine, saxophonist
Bob Shepherd and bassist Dave Carpenter--is Fuzzy Music's flagship
group, and with good reason. The instrumentation is similar to a
classical chamber trio in the sense that it is the ultimate
distillation of the elements necessary for improvisational
creativity. And these three musicians, superb individual artists,
equally adept as ensemble players, have been together long enough to
find their musical linkages with intuitive ease.</LD>
<TE>   One of the whimsical aspects of the Lounge Art Ensemble is the use
of material that uses new melodies applied to the chord changes of
standard songs. That's an old technique, of course, particularly
favored in the '40s by the beboppers. But the humorous twist that the
group brings to the process is the application of names to the new
songs that are reflective of the originals. Their opening set, for
example included "It Already Happened" (on the chords of "It Could
Happen to You") and "Amusing Paramour" (on the chords of "My Funny
Valentine").</TE>
<TE>   The group 3prime--pianist Tom Ranier, bassist Abraham Laboriel and
drummer Peter Donald--was similarly craftsmanlike, if less musically
compelling. Too predictable in the faster numbers that tended to
climax with Laboriel's snapping bass solo, it was at its best with
slower, more thoughtful interpretations of standards.</TE>

<HD>A Surfer's Music Catches a Wave</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* Singer Jack Johnson's career is going swell, but
his life on the beach comes first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About a year ago, Jack Johnson was on the beach at Rincon, his
regular surfing break just south of his Santa Barbara home, when a
car drove by with music blaring out the window. The folkish song with
a lightly blues-reggae lilt caught his ear.</LD>
<LD>   "I remember hearing this bass line and starting to bob my head to
it," Johnson says. "As the car went by, I looked to see if I knew the
person driving and at the same time I saw that it wasn't someone I
knew, I just then realized that it was my song."</LD>
<LD>   It was a head-turning experience, Johnson says, a twilight-zone
confluence of his two worlds: surfing and music.</LD>
<TE>   And while most aspiring pop musicians would kill for the kind of
momentum that Johnson is currently enjoying, that other world keeps
pulling him in the opposite direction.</TE>
<TE>   "With surfing, I didn't want that [external pressure]," he says,
sitting in the dressing room at the House of Blues in West Hollywood,
before playing to full houses on two straight nights. "As soon as
anyone else had any say--'You have to do this photo shoot'--I didn't
want to do it anymore ....</TE>
<TE>   "We were playing around between Santa Barbara and San Diego before
we had a record out or even wanted to. I would continue that for my
whole life. But the fact that it's catching on, I'm honored."</TE>
<TE>   Surfing had been the public pursuit of the Hawaii native, a star
as a surfer and as a maker of surf films. Music was a private
passion, something he did mostly for himself and his friends. Though
he'd made an album, "Brushfire Fairytales," released in early 2001 on
the tiny independent label Enjoy Records, he never really expected
his shambling odes to love and the laid-back life to be blasting from
car stereos of people he'd never met.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine how he felt Saturday night as he stood on stage at the
House of Blues, with a heavy presence of bubbly high school and
college-age girls in the packed crowd, loudly singing along to every
song and squealing after every verse and at every one of his bashful
grins.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to figure out," Johnson, 26, says before the show. "I
don't feel I deserve any of it."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up on the north shore of Oahu, Johnson started surfing at
4 and playing guitar at 14, learning Van Morrison and Cat Stevens
songs from a family friend during beach barbecues. In high school he
was a rising star on the competitive surfing circuit, but moved to
Santa Barbara to major in math at UCSB, where he met his wife, Kim.
He switched to the film program in his second year, and by the time
he graduated he was gaining a reputation in the surf film world for
favoring the classic beauty and spirituality of the sport over the
more in-vogue daredevil extremism.</TE>
<TE>   Among the fans of the films was neo-blues singer G. Love, whose
music Johnson had used in his films. The two met through a mutual
friend several years ago and wound up surfing and jamming together,
eventually using some spare studio time to record Johnson's song
"Rodeo Clowns." G. Love liked it so much that he put it on his 1999
album, "Philadelphonic," and it became a college radio hit.</TE>
<TE>   Around the same time, a demo tape of Johnson songs was given to
J.P. Plunier, the manager and producer of folk-pop star Ben Harper.
Plunier and former Virgin Records executive Andy Factor started the
L.A.-based Enjoy Records to make an album with Johnson, planning to
sell it primarily at surf shops. Johnson figured they'd sell 5,000
copies of "Brushfire Fairytales," but a year after its release it has
reached 130,000 with little radio play. It's now been picked up for
distribution by the major Universal Records, and powerful radio
stations, including rock-heavy KROQ-FM (106.7), have started to
embrace the acoustic folk-blues shuffle "Flake," pushing the album's
sales to 8,000 a week and climbing.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Johnson's picked up an intense following, with
active trading of live recordings via Internet communities in the
manner of jam bands. The appeal was easy to see Saturday. Following a
screening of his film "Thicker Than Water," Johnson--in super-casual
green T-shirt, black jeans and thong sandals--was easy-going and
natural on stage, backed by a bassist and a drummer.</TE>
<TE>   With a relaxed, breezy, acoustic guitar facility and a pleasant,
unaffected voice, he was surprisingly involving. His lyrics are
thoughtful, whether calling for the world to slow down ("Inaudible
Melodies") or playfully rhapsodizing about his wife ("Bubble Toes").
And in "Fortunate Fool" he proved capable of creating melodies that
evoke the world of pop standards. Closing the show, "Flake" was
enlivened by the acoustic slide guitar work of guest Harper.</TE>
<TE>   But as comfortable as Johnson seemed, he's not sure what to make
of his growing legion of fans.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point it could be too many people," he says quietly. He
can't say how many is too many, but he knows what he's not willing to
give up in exchange for pop stardom. Before signing with Enjoy, he
rejected offers from record companies that asked him to forgo surfing
and filmmaking and be a full-time musician. And even in negotiating
the distribution deal with Universal, he drew a line in the
metaphorical sand.</TE>
<TE>   "I voiced my opinion that there may be a point where everyone's
saying that it's a perfect time for me to do something to promote the
record and I may say that it's a perfect time to chill out," he says.
"I'll only do this as long as it's fun."</TE>
<TE>   He's not bluffing. Factor, the co-founder of Enjoy Records, says
that Johnson already has blown off a scheduled meeting with Universal
executives. The waves were good in Santa Barbara and he wanted to
stay there to surf.</TE>

<HD>A Romantic With a Passion for Color</HD>
<DH>Art* An Orange County exhibition of Elmer Bischoff
paintings explores how the Bay Area artist poured his feelings out in
paint and pigment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KINNEY LITTLEFIELD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Elmer Bischoff wasn't the most famous of 20th century San Francisco
Bay Area painters, but in his own idealistic and individualistic way,
he loomed bright.</LD>
<LD>   At least that is the message of Susan Landauer, chief curator at
the San Jose Museum of Art and guest curator of "Grand Lyricist: The
Art of Elmer Bischoff," an exhibition on view at the Orange County
Museum of Art through May 19.</LD>
<LD>   "Bischoff's brushwork was so dreamy and melting that the term I've
conceived for his work is 'liquid light,'" Landauer said. "He was
truly a colorist. He'd create these passages of color that move
across his canvas in an ever-shifting interplay--perhaps 20 hues in a
small radius of a few inches."</LD>
<TE>   Bischoff, who was born in Berkeley in 1916, studied, taught and
painted in the Bay Area for most of his life. He died in 1991. He was
a founder of the Bay Area Figurative group of the 1950s, along with
his better-known colleagues Richard Diebenkorn and David Park.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition, which was organized by the Oakland Museum of
California, features nearly 70 canvases that trace the history of
Bischoff's work, from its Abstract Expressionist bent of the '40s to
the hotly colored figurative scenes of the '50s and Bischoff's return
to abstraction of a more complex and frenetic sort in the '70s.
Landauer's book, "Elmer Bischoff: The Ethics of Paint," serves as the
exhibition catalog.</TE>
<TE>   Included in the exhibition, "Woman With Dark Blue Sky" (1959),
"Figure and Red Wall" (1955) and "Blue Clouds" (1963) typify
Bischoff's blend of figuration and abstraction, his signature
synthesis of the human form with expanses of luxuriant, thickly
smeared paint.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it was Bischoff's fluid sensuality that set him apart from
Diebenkorn and Park.</TE>
<TE>   "As Bill Berkson writes in the introduction to my book, if Park
was the classicist and Diebenkorn the modernist, Bischoff was the
romantic," Landauer said. "Bischoff believed an artist could transmit
his own feeling into paint. His method of handling paint was
spontaneous, unpremeditated."</TE>
<TE>   If pigment stirred his soul, the Bay Area owned Bischoff's heart.
Berkeley was his lifelong muse.</TE>
<TE>   In the '30s, Bischoff studied art at UC Berkeley, a rare outpost
of European-leaning modernism during the Depression, when American
popular taste embraced realism and homespun regional art. He ended up
teaching at UC Berkeley too, for 22 years. He refused to leave the
Bay Area for New York, going against common career wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   "Bischoff was underappreciated in his lifetime," Landauer said.
"He said he could only paint in the Bay Area. I certainly would like
to see him transcend the regional tag of a 'California painter'--but
he was attached to a sense of place. He had a feel for the hills and
the expanse of the bay."</TE>
<TE>   Music also informed his art, according to Landauer. Bischoff was a
jazz trumpeter. His loose, highly gestural style smacks of jazz
improvisation, even in simple compositions of a figure in a room or a
garden or on the shore.</TE>
<TE>   "He could make hopelessly mundane subjects feel fresh," Landauer
said. "It was like Charlie Parker or Miles Davis doing improvisations
on a familiar tune like 'Over the Rainbow.'"</TE>
<TE>   In 1957, Bischoff, Diebenkorn and Park gained national attention
when the Oakland Museum mounted "Contemporary Bay Area Figurative
Painting." Seventeen years later, Bischoff made an abrupt decision to
abandon the figurative work with which he was most identified,
returning to abstraction.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a matter of survival in the studio, as was his move from
abstraction to figurative painting in 1952," Landauer said. "Bischoff
simply felt he had run dry. At the time, his figurative work was
selling well. His New York gallery, Staempfli, dropped him after he
made the change.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why I used the word 'ethics' in the title of my book,"
Landauer said. "Bischoff would not merely crank work out. He believed
in being true to himself and his integrity of vision. He never did
falter in his convictions through the many art trends that have come
and gone. In that sense he was absolutely a risk-taker."</TE>

<LD>   Greenfield Show Pulled for 'Crossfire' Reruns</LD>
<LD>   Jeff Greenfield's CNN talk show, "Greenfield at Large," which
premiered in June, has succumbed to low ratings. In a wry online
message, the host laid the blame squarely on his viewers, who failed
to enlist support for the program.</LD>
<TE>   "If you're wondering why we're being canceled, please bear in mind
that it's entirely your fault," Greenfield wrote. "You heard us. If
only you had gotten millions of people to watch us, we'd be moving
into Larry King's office even now."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, however, he offered absolution: "We forgive you. After
all, we enjoyed your company and your feedback," Greenfield said.</TE>
<TE>   The last show was seen Friday. It's been replaced in the 8 p.m.
slot by reruns of "Crossfire," CNN said. Greenfield will continue to
appear on "Inside Politics" and to contribute essays and analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian Shoots: First 'Pasadena,' Now This</TE>
<TE>   The problem of runaway movie and TV production is in the spotlight
again this week, with NBC announcing that the movie "L.A. Law: Return
to Justice" has begun shooting--in Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   The film is only the latest Southern California-centric project to
be shot in Canada, where tax breaks and the currency exchange rate
make production less expensive. The Fox series "Pasadena" was also
filmed in Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   The "L.A. Law" reunion project, which brings together most of the
original cast except for Jimmy Smits, is scheduled to air during the
May rating sweeps.</TE>
<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   Oscar Omission Lights Political Fuse in Italy</TE>
<TE>   Italy didn't take well to the absence of Nanni Moretti's "My Son's
Room" from the list of Oscar nominees vying for the best foreign
language film. According to Variety, the omission has polarized the
division between the country's center-right political establishment,
led by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and its mostly left-wing
film industry.</TE>
<TE>   Moretti, whose film won the Palme d'Or at last year's Cannes
International Film Festival, has been a particular target as a vocal
spokesman for the left.</TE>
<TE>   "Moretti excluded from the Oscars? Inevitable," said Vittorio
Sgarbi, undersecretary for the ministry of culture. "They realized
that as an artist he's worthless; he's an impotent director."</TE>
<TE>   Certain Italian directors with a right-wing bent have also taken
potshots at the film. "Moretti's film is a bad movie that has nothing
to say to Americans," said Franco Zefferelli. Added Lina Wertmuller:
"I don't like Moretti's films and he could never have been an Oscar
candidate because Americans also like another type of cinema."</TE>
<TE>   Insurance Problems Put 'Gosford' in Jeopardy</TE>
<TE>   "Gosford Park," which racked up seven Academy Award
nominations--including one for best picture--nearly didn't make it to
the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Because director Robert Altman is 76 years old, Variety reports,
it was prohibitively expensive to line up insurance for him given the
film's $19.8 million budget. Not until the producers found a standby
of stature could the project move ahead. The fellow's identity has
now been revealed. Director Stephen Frears ("My Beautiful
Launderette") was ready to take the reins should anything go awry,
the trade paper says.</TE>
<TE>   Brosnan Injured in Line of Duty on Bond Film</TE>
<TE>   Pierce Brosnan injured his knee while shooting a water scene on
the British set of the untitled James Bond film and is out of action
for about two weeks, E! Online News reports.</TE>
<TE>   Though producers declined to provide details about the injury,
they said it is not expected to affect the November release date for
the film--the 20th in the series and the fourth in which Brosnan has
starred.</TE>
<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   London Premiere Part of Gershwin Windfall</TE>
<TE>   The 1983 Broadway musical "My One and Only" is about to premiere
in London. And that's only a small part of the activity feeding the
Gershwin estate.</TE>
<TE>   In an age short on new melody and long on nostalgia, material
created by George and Ira Gershwin continues to generate between $5
million and $10 million a year, London's Telegraph reports. "Rhapsody
in Blue" is the biggest earner and "I Got Rhythm" the most recorded.
Playwright Wendy Wasserstein is working on a live musical version of
"An American in Paris," and artists ranging from Sting to Diana Krall
are lining up to sing Gershwin tunes.</TE>
<TE>   Not every project that comes its way is given the go-ahead,
however. Marc Gershwin, son of the third Gershwin brother, Arthur,
and Leopold Godowsky III, son of Frances--the only Gershwin
sister--shot down a South African staging of "Porgy and Bess" during
the apartheid era ("We wouldn't allow it on principle") and an
all-white Finnish "Porgy" ("They wrote and said, 'But Mr. Gershwin,
the problem is we have no black actors in Finland'").</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Roger Deakins received the feature film award from the American
Society of Cinematographers for his black-and-white photography in
"The Man Who Wasn't There" Sunday night at the Century Plaza
Hotel.... Marlo Thomas and F. Murray Abraham have been cast to
portray Jacqueline Susann and her husband, Irving Mansfield, in
"Paper Doll," a play based on the life of the "Valley of the Dolls"
author, tentatively due to open at Broadway's Cort Theater in April.</TE>

<LD>Indigo Girls first came to prominence during the late-'80s
sensitive-chick movement (Tracy Chapman, Suzanne Vega, etc.), and
they haven't changed their  formula much. But, hey, if Jewel can
still be relevant in the pop world, then why not Indigo Girls?</LD>
<LD>   Basking in the fan love that partly explains its staying power,
the folk-pop duo gave the faithful a taste of its forthcoming album
and played a lot of old favorites during a sold-out show on Monday at
the Knitting Factory in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   "Become You" (due March 12) eschews the broader sonic palette of
1999's "Come on Now Social," returning to the all-acoustic approach
that is a hallmark of Amy Ray and Emily Saliers' 21-year association.
Accordingly, the pair's hourlong set featured them playing acoustic
guitar, harmonica and other stringed instruments, and harmonizing
with that trademark blend of Ray's shaggy-edged alto and Saliers'
sweet soprano.</LD>
<TE>   Their best work still blends emotional introspection and an
activist mind-set with agreeably jangling hooks. Such new selections
as the album's blues-folk title track offered self-affirmation,
romantic pensiveness and personal reflection and bore the classic
upbeat/downbeat contrast of Saliers' and Ray's respective personas.</TE>
<TE>   The women scarcely had to encourage singing along on such older
numbers as the jubilant "Closer to Fine" and the rollicking
folk-popper "Get Out the Map." If at times the lyrics were blandly
pretentious, Ray and Saliers were so lively and down-to-earth that
even nonbelievers would have had a hard time finding places where the
set dragged.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's nothing like a national security crisis to bring about a
closer examination of our methods for safeguarding the American way
of life, which is why tonight's Discovery Channel premiere of
"G-Man--The Making of an FBI Agent" (9 p.m.) carries a heightened
sense of mission.</LD>
<LD>   The hourlong program follows the 40 brave souls of Class 0105
through the agency's 16-week training and testing ordeal at Quantico,
Va. It takes a year of screening just to make it to rookie camp at
Quantico, and the candidates' backgrounds are as varied as their
reasons for accepting the challenge.</LD>
<LD>   The almost swaggering confidence exhibited by some of these men
and women at the outset of training fades from view as the days wear
on. Physical ability tests, firearms training and hand-to-hand combat
instruction are interwoven with 370 hours of classroom work.</LD>
<TE>   The courses on international warfare, forensics, ethics, the law
and more come in wave after wave.</TE>
<TE>   Any spare moments are spent studying or working out. The combined
assault on mind and body leaves some by the wayside, as the
single-minded survivors doggedly push toward the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   The straightforward style of executive producers Tom Cochran and
Jack Smith and writer Kevin Finch works effectively to bring the
Quantico experience alive through the eyes of the candidates. By
graduation day, there's a palpable sense of relief and pride in these
people we've come to know.</TE>
<TE>   And any lingering trace of swagger has been replaced by a cool
confidence born of having gone through a crucible the likes of which
few ever experience.</TE>

<HD>The Case of the Tasty But Poisonous Nut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KARP</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To meet Paul Schrade, a tall, white-haired 77-year-old with a gently
bemused smile, you'd never suspect that he's obsessed with a
poisonous nut. Mention the bitter almond, however, and the retired
union organizer won't stop talking about how--on a culinary tour of
Sicily in 1990--he fell in love with its powerful, unique flavor,
which gives marzipan and almond milk their characteristic taste. Even
after he was told that raw bitter almonds contained a form of cyanide
and were illegal in the Unites States, Schrade was fascinated.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought, 'European chefs make good use of bitter almonds for
cooking and baking--why shouldn't we?'" he says.</LD>
<LD>   Through his second career as a bakery consultant and forager for
Campanile restaurant, Schrade sought to spur a revival of the ancient
Mediterranean flavoring in California. Undeterred, or perhaps
intrigued, by the nut's sinister reputation--spread by mystery tales
in which the detective sniffed the odor of bitter almonds on a
cyanide victim's breath--he sleuthed relentlessly for sources and
information.</LD>
<TE>   He learned that most of the original wild species of almonds were
bitter, but that, as the nuts came into cultivation thousands of
years ago, farmers began concentrating their crops toward sweet
types, the kind grown today in California.</TE>
<TE>   A recessive gene causes bitter almond trees to produce in their
shoots, leaves and kernels a toxic compound called amygdalin, which
serves as a chemical defense against being eaten. When amygdalin is
moistened, it splits into edible benzaldehyde, which provides an
intense almond aroma and flavor, and deadly hydrocyanic acid, a
fast-acting inhibitor of the respiratory system.</TE>
<TE>   The lethal dose of raw bitter almonds depends on the size of the
nuts, their concentration of amygdalin and the consumer's
sensitivity. But scientists estimate that a 150-pound adult might die
from eating between 10 and 70 raw nuts, and a child from ingesting
just a few.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, although it may be safe for most adults to nibble a
raw bitter almond to experience its intense flavor, that would be
unpleasant to most people. The nuts are not meant to be eaten as a
snack food like regular almonds: They're used as a spice, like nutmeg
or cinnamon.</TE>
<TE>   Schrade, who studied organic chemistry at Yale, learned that
because hydrocyanic acid vanishes into the air when heated, cooking
destroys the poison in bitter almonds and allows them to lend their
flavor to a wide range of dishes, both traditional and modern.</TE>
<TE>   In the course of his explorations, Schrade found several
California chefs eager to cook with bitter almonds. At the center of
this informal network is Tim Woods of Echo restaurant in Fresno,
famed for his zealous use of local ingredients.</TE>
<TE>   Since bitter almonds are usually not available commercially, he
harvests his nuts from nearby wild and backyard trees, and uses them
to add a pleasing bite to the richness of bread pudding with caramel
and to stone-fruit cobblers. He also shares his supplies with Sean
Lippert, formerly chef of Across the Street in New York, for her
bitter almond granita, and with Judy Rodgers of Zuni Cafe in Berkeley
and Kim Boyce, pastry chef of Campanile, who both use the nuts to
flavor panna cotta and ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   Until recent decades, most Mediterranean almond orchards were
grown from seed, and the shuffling of genes resulted in a mix of
bitter almond trees among the sweet. Growers liked to keep a few
bitter trees around because they helped to pollinize the sweet
varieties. The inclusion of bitter nuts gave snackers occasional
unpleasant surprises, but they deepened the flavor of marzipan,
almond milk and glazes for cakes. In Italy, bitter almond paste was
traditionally used to make crisp amaretti cookies, and bitter almond
extract flavored amaretto liqueur. In Greece, bitter almonds are used
in soumada, a sweet syrup.</TE>
<TE>   There's little large-scale cultivation of bitter almonds left in
Spain and Italy, mostly just scattered trees remain, but it is still
possible to buy raw bitter almonds at European specialty markets.
Morocco and Iran now lead in commercial production of bitter almonds.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, the lack of clear information about bitter
almonds' legal status has squelched their cultivation, trade and use.
No stores regularly stock bitter almonds, so cooks seeking them have
had to rely, like Woods, on seedling trees growing wild along
streams, roads and railroad tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if I should sell them or not," says Bill Fujimoto,
owner of Monterey Market in Berkeley, which carries bitter almonds
occasionally. "I don't leave them out on the counter. I sell them
only when people who know bitter almonds ask me for some."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Schrade made dozens of inquiries to federal and
state health authorities about the legality of bitter almonds, but
never received a definitive answer. Recently, however, a friend
steered him to a Food and Drug Administration Web site that states,
"Because of their toxicity, bitter almonds may not be marketed in the
United States for unrestricted use." The agency's regulations do,
however, allow almond paste and extract manufacturers to use the nuts
as long as their products do not contain more than minute, safe
levels of hydrocyanic acid.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA clarified the agency's position recently, saying that it
would allow bitter almonds to be shipped interstate to professional
chefs and bakers, as long as their dishes were cooked to be nontoxic.
But the agency said it would take "appropriate action" against
vendors found to be selling bitter almonds to the public in such a
way that they could easily be confused with regular almonds. These
actions might include issuing a warning, or seizing the product.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA regulates interstate commerce in foodstuffs, but bitter
almonds grown and sold within California fall under the jurisdiction
of the state's Department of Health Services, which takes a less
restrictive approach to retail sales. James Waddell, acting chief of
the department's Food and Drug Branch, says that the agency has no
specific regulation covering bitter almonds, but that the nuts could
be sold in accordance with its rule for bitter apricot kernels, which
requires packages to bear labeling stating: "may be toxic; very low
quantities may cause reactions."</TE>
<TE>   The upshot is, California growers and vendors are permitted to
sell properly labeled packages of bitter almonds to California
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   This is good news to Rusty Hall, one of Schrade's discoveries, who
grows both sweet and bitter almonds, which he sells at farmers
markets and by mail order. Virtually all the state's sweet almonds
come from vast irrigated orchards of densely planted trees in the
Central Valley, but at his ranch near Paso Robles, Hall quixotically
tends an ancient orchard that he dry-farms, which he is convinced
gives his sweet almonds more concentrated flavor.</TE>
<TE>   On a bright September morning in the middle of harvest, Hall
surveyed his widely spaced trees, their roots reaching deep into the
rolling hills. Central Valley farmers harvest mechanically, but Hall
and his workers gathered the crop by hand, using long poles and
rubber mallets to knock down the almond fruits, which resembled
thin-fleshed, split-open apricots, onto tarps.</TE>
<TE>   They carefully avoided half a dozen bitter almond trees, which
were flagged with red surveyor's tape tied to their branches. Almond
orchards in the area were grafted on almond seedling rootstock,
explained Hall, and some of the rootstock, as usual, turned out to be
bitter almond. Sometimes the sweet almond graft didn't take, or the
scion later died, leaving the bitter rootstock to develop into a
tree.</TE>
<TE>   It's not hard to find bitter almond trees in local orchards, he
added, but tough to convince a processor to hull and shell the nuts:
California sweet almond growers, who harvested 525,000 acres last
year, regard bitter almonds as contaminants. Therefore, said Hall,
he'd have to wait until the end of the season to pick and process his
bitter almonds separately.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the almond industry's fear of bitter nuts, it seemed
impossible that anyone would dare to grow them commercially in
California. But a little more than a year ago, Schrade announced
triumphantly that he had found such a source: Thomas Vetsch, a Swiss
American grower from Bakersfield, had a small planting of 3-year-old
bitter almond trees, which were just starting to bear, as a sideline
to his 1,200 acres of sweet almonds.</TE>
<TE>   On a blustery day last March, with his almond orchards in full
bloom, Vetsch gave instructions to a beekeeper and shared his passion
for almonds.</TE>
<TE>   "Just look at this," he said, gesturing excitedly at the sea of
white blossoms. "This is the glory of the world, the wonderful sweet
fragrance, the bees flying around. Hear that buzz? That's what you
want to hear: strong bees," he said, his eyes gleaming.</TE>
<TE>   Vetsch and his wife, Kim, had fallen in love under an almond tree,
he said. The almond project was their dream. In addition to selling
bulk almonds commercially, they have a smaller venture, Mandelin,
that manufactures almond pastes. A perfectionist, he had originally
planted some bitter almonds so as to be able to control all the
ingredients for the pastes, normally made with imported oil of bitter
almond.</TE>
<TE>   But when he was asked to show a visitor his bitter almond trees,
his expression darkened. At a recent almond industry conference,
rumors that someone in Kern County was growing bitter almonds had
caused a sensation. Soon thereafter, Vetsch had fired up the chain
saws.</TE>
<TE>   "It's over. It's history. I have no more bitter almonds," he said
vehemently, pointing to a bulldozed section with a pile of uprooted
trees. "In Europe they love bitter almonds, but they will never be
grown here. Americans are so sue-crazy--if someone feels a little
off, the first thing they do is call a lawyer. I can't put the whole
farm in jeopardy."</TE>
<TE>   Vetsch said he hadn't given up his quest for European-style,
full-flavored almonds, however. At his office and factory in
Bakersfield, he offered a taste of nuts higher in oil and richer in
flavor than American almonds.</TE>
<TE>   "That's as close to bitter as it gets, but with no poison," he
said. "We use it in our almond pastes."</TE>
<TE>   Asked to name the variety, he said, "What? Do you think that I'll
tell my secrets?"</TE>
<TE>   When told of the trees' demise, Schrade was disappointed but
philosophical. It will take further work to remove the stigma of
bitter almonds, he reflected.</TE>
<TE>   As much as he loves the flavor the nuts provide, he said,
"Sometimes when I'm on the treadmill at the gym and I feel a bit
peaked, I wonder: 'Am I getting old? Or is it the bitter almonds?'"</TE>

<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 15 minutes plus 2 hours
standing and 6 hours chilling</TE>
<TE>   Campanile has long taken a lively interest in the sourcing and
cooking of bitter almonds, assisted by Paul Schrade, the restaurant's
indefatigable forager. In addition to this recipe, pastry chef Kim
Boyce also prepares bitter almond ice cream and stollen using
marzipan paste from Mandelin (Vetsch Farms).</TE>
<TE>   Oil</TE>
<TE>   3 1/4 cups whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   1 cup milk</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   40 bitter almonds, finely chopped (2 ounces), or 2 teaspoons
almond extract</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons cold water</TE>
<TE>   Using your fingers, lightly coat 5 (5-ounce) ramekins with oil.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the cream, milk and sugar in a saucepan and cook over
medium heat for 5 minutes. Add the almonds, whisk to combine and set
aside. Allow the almonds to infuse for 2 hours. If using extract,
heat the cream, milk and sugar, whisk to combine and then remove from
the heat. When cool, add the almond extract.</TE>
<TE>   Place the gelatin in a large stainless steel mixing bowl. Pour the
water over the gelatin, adding more water if necessary to moisten all
the gelatin.</TE>
<TE>   Place the mixing bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water
and heat until the gelatin melts, about 30 seconds. Do not stir the
gelatin, as it will scald on the sides of the mixing bowl. Turn off
the heat and keep the gelatin warm.</TE>

<LD>Since bitter almonds are difficult or impossible to obtain in the
United States, home cooks, professional chefs and industrial users
have long resorted to alternative sources for intense almond flavor.</LD>
<LD>   Apricot and peach kernels, easy enough to obtain from fresh fruits
by cracking open the pits (put them in a kitchen towel and hit them
with a hammer), can substitute for bitter almonds, though they have
less amygdalin and thus less flavor. Generations of home canners have
used one or two kernels to add a heightened flavor when cooking
peach, apricot and cherry jam.</LD>
<LD>   "The flavors are close enough," says Tim Woods of Echo restaurant
in Fresno. "I prefer bitter almonds, however, because the apricot
kernels often have a musty taste."</LD>
<TE>   China exports bitter nuts which are often called almonds but are
botanically apricot kernels. The fruits, closely related to almonds,
are grown primarily for their seeds, not for their flesh. To
complicate matters, China and Central Asian countries also produce
sweet apricot kernels, which can be eaten like normal almonds.
Chinese bitter apricot kernels are available at some ethnic markets
in the United States (often without warnings of their toxicity, in
violation of state and federal regulations), but before buying it's
important to ask whether the kernels are bitter or sweet. The bitter
kernels are often called "north" almonds, and the sweet kernels,
"south" almonds. All bitter nuts, of course, must be cooked to remove
the cyanide.</TE>
<TE>   Peach leaves macerated in hot water may also be used for bitter
almond flavor.</TE>
<TE>   The most common sources of bitter almond taste, however, are
almond extracts, which are distilled to be free of cyanide. "Pure"
almond extract should contain natural oil of bitter almond, a
colorless fluid, along with water and alcohol. "Natural" extract
usually is flavored with benzaldehyde made from cassia, a relative of
cinnamon. "Imitation" extract uses synthetic benzaldehyde, which is
manufactured from a petrochemical.</TE>
<TE>   Although oil of bitter almond can be pressed from bitter almonds,
apricot kernels and other fruit kernels containing amygdalin (such as
those from peaches, plums or cherries), true bitter almonds almost
never are used. Apricot kernels yield more oil and, being byproducts
of the fruit industry, are cheaper.</TE>
<TE>   It takes 100 pounds of kernels to make 1.7 ounces of bitter almond
oil, so the natural product is very expensive compared to the
synthetic benzaldehyde in "imitation" almond extract. Many cooks say
that pure and natural almond extracts have a more rounded taste than
the imitation product, but the flavoring in all three forms consists
almost entirely of benzaldehyde, and chemists must use sophisticated
analytical tests to tell the difference.</TE>
<TE>   There is thus considerable incentive for manufacturers to
substitute the cheaper products, and several industry sources claim
that most of what is sold as oil of bitter almond in the United
States is actually from cassia or even synthetic.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd question whether there's any of the real stuff around any
more," said Kim Bleimann, president of  Berje Inc., an importer of
essential oils based in Bloomfield, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Laurie Harrsen, a spokeswoman for McCormick, the
nation's leading extract manufacturer, said: "The oil of bitter
almond in McCormick's pure almond extract is derived from apricot
kernels, in accordance with FDA regulations."</TE>

<HD>Oil Drips With Money for Alaska</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE</DL>
<LD>Who wants to drill for oil in the far north of Alaska? Alaskans do.
And do they ever.</LD>
<LD>   More than the oil companies themselves, more than labor unions,
more even than George W. Bush, Alaskans are desperate to get some
fresh crude flowing out of the wilderness here. That's because there
is a threat on the horizon. Doom is settling in like ice fog. The
bears are restless in their dens. Without new oil, goodness, Alaskans
might be asked to pay taxes.</LD>
<LD>   For a generation now, Alaskans have been living high off public
lands and the royalties from free-flowing petroleum. Instead of
having to pay state taxes, Alaskans get a juicy cash kickback every
year from their government. But the big North Slope oil fields are
slowly drying up.</LD>
<TE>   So, Alaska has dipped into its shrinking state treasury for money
to mount the mother of all lobbying campaigns: nearly $5 million to
try to convince other Americans and Congress that it's in the
nation's best interests to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
to oil drilling so that Alaskans won't have to shoulder the yoke and
actually pay for their schools and hospitals themselves.</TE>
<TE>   For pure self-interest, Alaska beats even Enron in trying to shape
government policy. In the last year, the state spent $3.85 million in
its Arctic refuge drilling campaign and appropriated another $1
million last week.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Enron spent $2.1 million lobbying in 2000 and $1.9
million the year before, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics.</TE>
<TE>   I have been kicking around, writing about, playing and working in
Alaska on and off for a dozen years now. I love this state and its
people, truly.</TE>
<TE>   I also love to pull the fig leaf off their silly myths once in
awhile, even though they roar like angry sow bears every time.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, you'll hear plenty about national energy
independence in the debate over the Arctic refuge. But the real fight
is Alaska's fight for money.</TE>
<TE>   National energy independence? The last time we heard that argument
was when federal lands in Prudhoe Bay, west of the refuge, were
opened for drilling. Back then, Americans were promised that North
Slope crude would lead the country to self-sufficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Funny, but for the benefit of Alaskans who wanted a better price
for their oil, Congress later said never mind and allowed this oil to
be sold to Asia. Today the U.S. imports a larger share of its oil
than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   Funny, too, but if you look close, you don't see much in the way
of oil company lobbying to drill in the disputed coastal section of
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. To the disappointment of many
Alaskans, the giant oil companies are preoccupied elsewhere--in
Russia, in Africa, in Latin America, in the Gulf of Mexico and in
Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   So the state has had to shoulder the argument itself, hand in hand
with the president.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Well, on the frontier, life has been cushy for a generation
now. At least as far as government goes. Alaskans--those hardy and
self-reliant frontiersmen--get an annual "dividend" from the Juneau
government: the earnings off a $21-billion "permanent fund" that is
the citizenry's share of oil revenues over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the payout was $1,963.86 per person, or $7,855 for a
family of four. On top of that, oil pays for 84% of state government,
meaning no income or sales taxes.</TE>
<TE>   On the federal front, government also favors Alaskans. For every
$1 they pay in U.S. taxes, they receive $1.68 back--to provide such
cushy services as subsidized airline service to air-freight soda pop
to remote villages. This per-capita payout is twice the 86 cents that
Californians get back for each $1 they pay in federal taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Alaskans are grateful, of course. They adhere to the
illusion of rugged individualism, which means they are second to none
when it comes to complaining about government and taxes.</TE>
<TE>   And right now, the complaints have reached fever pitch. Like many
states, Alaska faces a budget deficit: $1 billion. The governor has
proposed an income tax. Other politicians are arguing for a sales tax
on the grounds that at least some of the burden would then be
sloughed off on tourists rather than to residents. Some state leaders
have been so daring as to propose dipping into the permanent fund to
pay for government.</TE>
<TE>   But the best hope, at least for the long run, is more oil. So when
you hear that drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is
going to help America, you'll know exactly which part.</TE>

<HD>Palestinians Must Take Charge of Their Own Destiny</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAWAZ A. GERGES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The escalation in Palestinian-Israeli hostilities overshadows an
equally daunting political challenge facing Palestinians: their lack
of visionary leadership and the absence of a public debate on this
critical issue. With the exception of a few courageous voices,
Palestinians and the Arab world have refrained from publicly
discussing Yasser Arafat's dismal failings with regard to peace
negotiations and the urgent task of nation-building.</LD>
<LD>   Arab and Muslim colleagues confide to me that they fear that
criticizing Arafat's autocratic conduct would play into Israeli
hands, particularly the ruling Likud government, which is trying to
destroy Arafat and his Palestinian Authority. Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon's besiegement and humiliation of Arafat compel
Palestinians to side with their nationalist leader. Sharon's
destructive methods are producing the opposite of their intended
results.</LD>
<LD>   Tragically, Palestinians appear to be repeating the costly
mistakes committed by their Egyptian, Syrian and Iraqi brethren, who
sacrificed economic and political development at the altar of
security and the fight against the "Zionist entity," losing both
battles in the process.</LD>
<TE>   Palestinians are at a crossroads and no longer can afford to
blindly trust a bankrupt leadership. Arafat has squandered humble but
important achievements that were hard-won by Palestinians over the
last two decades. Closedminded and authoritarian, Arafat has not
digested three of the most critical lessons in the prolonged
Arab-Israeli conflict.</TE>
<TE>   * Lesson one: Violence and terrorism against Israeli civilians
undermine, not strengthen, the legitimate Palestinian cause by
empowering the hard-liners in Israel who oppose a sweeping peace
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of building bridges directly to the Israeli public and
informing his people of the requirements of peace, Arafat spent more
time abroad, conducting shuttle diplomacy. He also spent more time
abroad than in communicating with Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   The academic debate about who is accountable for igniting the
armed Al Aqsa intifada overlooks the fact that violence and terrorism
threaten not only to destroy Arafat and his Palestinian Authority but
also Palestinian nationalist aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   * Lesson two: Despite signing the 1993 Oslo accords, Arafat
continues to pursue the illusion of an Arab option.</TE>
<TE>   Although Arab rulers pay lip service to the plight of the
Palestinians, they have not translated their rhetoric into real
currency. Since the outbreak of the intifada 17 months ago and after
two Arab summits, Arab rulers pledged billions in U.S. dollars to aid
the collapsing Palestinian economy but delivered little of this
promised aid.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians should not expect much concrete assistance from the
Arab summit in March because the Arab world is deeply divided over
the Palestine question. While Egypt, Jordan and the Gulf countries
call for an end to the intifada and a return to the negotiating
table, Syria and Lebanon oppose giving up armed resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Mainstream Israelis--some of whom have become skeptical--must be
convinced of the limited nature of the Palestinians' nationalist
aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   * Lesson three: Socialized into the chaotic street politics of
Jordan in the 1960s and 1970s and of Lebanon in the 1970s and early
1980s, Arafat took what he learned and applied it to the Palestinian
situation: He behaved much more like a militia boss than a statesman
confronting the challenge of constructing a democratic state.</TE>
<TE>   By failing to understand the real sources of Israeli power,
Arafat, using corruption as a tool to consolidate his political
control and marginalize opposition, built a bloated bureaucracy and
several security agencies beholden to his will.</TE>
<TE>   Shattered were the high hopes pinned on Palestinians to avoid
imitating the deadly models of Arab militarism and authoritarianism
and to chart, instead, a more liberal path.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that his Palestinian Authority lacks moral
legitimacy in the eyes of the world and many Palestinian citizens as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the Palestinian cause has become synonymous with
Arafat to the detriment of the former. Yet Palestinians remain
ambivalent about taking their leader to task and holding him
accountable for his wrongful deeds, thanks mainly to Sharon's
shortsighted policies and his brutal crackdown. The Palestinian
public is terrified of what the future holds after Arafat's
departure.</TE>
<TE>   In the final analysis, Arafat's dismal failure to nourish an open
society and develop transparent institutions likely will have as much
lasting negative effects on Palestinians as the current setback in
peace talks and the devastating Israeli onslaught.</TE>
<TE>   Sooner rather than later, Palestinians and Israelis will recognize
their common interests and make the needed painful compromises to
settle their differences.</TE>
<TE>   But the autocratic and security-oriented apparatus installed by
Arafat will take years if not decades to dismantle. This culture of
authoritarianism and cult of personality have already wreaked havoc
in Arab politics, deepened public cynicism and fueled intolerance and
extremism.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of legitimate authority, competing parallel
authorities tend to fill the vacuum.</TE>
<TE>   It is no wonder that militant groups, such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad
and others, have gained popularity at the expense of Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of who is in power in Israel, the longer Palestinians
postpone the inevitable--which is to say, initiating a frank, open
discussion about the nature and form of their future leadership and
government--the more the Palestinians risk being oppressed further
and perpetuating their prolonged tragedy.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the petition he filed last year on behalf of the Bush
administration, U.S. Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson urged the
U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal of a Cleveland school voucher
case, which he said involved a program assisting "the parents of
students enrolled in failing public schools."</LD>
<LD>   Olson was successful--in more ways than one.</LD>
<LD>   Not only will the high court hear oral arguments in the case
today, but parents, elected officials and reporters are also largely
accepting Olson's erroneous description of the Cleveland program.</LD>
<TE>   As the Supreme Court prepares to hear this case, it must not allow
its judgment to be clouded by the myth that vouchers are helping
children trapped in "failing" schools. The nine justices must
recognize that how they decide the case could encourage other states
down a dangerous path that drains critical funds from public schools
and the students they serve.</TE>
<TE>   The voucher program the high court will examine operates very
differently than its defenders would have Americans believe.</TE>
<TE>   Besides diverting more than $10 million from education budgets in
this school year alone, the program funnels tax dollars to many
families whose children either never attended public schools or, if
so, attended quality public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, an Ohio research institute reviewed information from
the voucher program's applications. What it found was stunning. Only
21% of the students receiving state tuition aid through the program
had attended a Cleveland public school the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Far from having "escaped" public schools, nearly eight out of 10
voucher students were already attending private schools or were just
starting kindergarten.</TE>
<TE>   For those voucher students who can be traced back to the public
schools, relatively few were attending failing schools.</TE>
<TE>   Catalyst for Cleveland Schools, an organization that reports on
reform efforts, examined the 10 public schools that had lost the most
students to vouchers. Rather than support the myth of vouchers as a
life raft for students in failing schools, the organization found
that these 10 schools were more likely to have test scores above the
district average--in some cases, above the state average.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, six of these 10 schools were classified among the
district's "empowered" schools, chosen for overall excellence. Three
of these 10 schools were among 1,320 high-poverty, high-minority
public schools highlighted in a recent report by the Education Trust
for their high performance. Not one of the these 10 schools was on
the Cleveland Municipal School District's list of low-performing
public schools.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to suggest that there aren't public schools that need
significant improvement. But funneling tax dollars to vouchers
undercuts the ability to fund smaller classes, early intervention,
after-school programs and other reforms that can turn around troubled
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Another myth is the notion that vouchers give Cleveland parents a
wide diversity of choices, including suburban public schools. While
the voucher law permits suburban public schools to participate, not a
single suburban public school does so.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, data released earlier this month show that 99.4% of
voucher money flows to religious schools. While there were once 11
nonreligious schools that participated in the Cleveland program, that
number has fallen to only three. In fact, the law is structured in a
way that encourages this. For parents who don't want a religiously
based education, there is virtually no choice.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking before the Supreme Court, pro-voucher attorneys are
likely to portray their effort as a crusade to help kids in failing
public schools.</TE>
<TE>   But repetition doesn't turn a myth into a reality. During
arguments in a 1770 trial, John Adams put it best: "Facts," he said,
"are stubborn things."</TE>

<LD>Since last May, the General Accounting Office, which is Congress'
investigative arm, has been asking the White House for information
about who helped Vice President Dick Cheney write the
administration's energy plan. Cheney and Co. have been stubborn
beyond reason in their refusal, and Comptroller General David M.
Walker may finally go to court this week to demand the information.
Walker, a former Reagan administration official who was backed for
his current job by Senate GOP leader Trent Lott, is making a
principled argument for the public's right to know.</LD>
<LD>   The administration is trying to portray its standoff with Congress
and Walker as protecting the powers of the presidency by maintaining
separation of powers. The powers of the presidency were bound to
expand after Sept. 11. But the requests for information about the
energy task force were first lodged by Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los
Angeles) in April, almost half a year before the war on terrorism
began. As more emerges about energy giant Enron's collapse and its
political reach, the importance of a clear picture of how Cheney ran
his operation increases.</LD>
<LD>   Consider what is already known.</LD>
<TE>   Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay met with Cheney April 17 and
delivered a memo advocating specific policies. All told, Enron
representatives met six times with the task force. According to a
report issued by Waxman in January, no less than 17 policies in the
White House energy plan were espoused by Enron or would have helped
it. Lay also met with Clay Johnson, the White House personnel
director, to lobby for nominees to the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission. President Bush later appointed two Enron favorites.</TE>
<TE>   The request of the GAO is limited and reasonable. Walker is not
asking for transcripts. He simply wants to know who the energy
commission met with and what the subject of discussion was. Of
course, any information about White House contacts with energy
industry officials may turn out to be harmless. The White House,
though, may end up embarrassed by the extent of its ties to oil and
gas interests. Better to face it now than to stonewall and keep the
issue burning.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's resistance is not limited to the energy plan meetings. He
is on something of a personal crusade to roll back the gains for open
government made during the Watergate era--when Cheney was chief of
staff for President Gerald R. Ford. As Secretary of Defense during
the Gulf War, when the Pentagon kept the press on as short a leash as
possible, Cheney's inclination to work beyond scrutiny grew stronger.</TE>
<TE>   But as the Watergate abuses showed, government runs best in the
open. In defying Congress and the GAO, Cheney shrouds the
administration's actions, and the public can only imagine the worst.</TE>

<LD>On March 5, county voters will be asked to choose judges for seven
open or contested seats on the Los Angeles Superior Court. The Times
makes the following endorsements in these races:</LD>
<LD>   Office No. 2: Hank Goldberg, a deputy district attorney who,
during his more than 15 years with the office, has handled a wide
range of prosecutions, including a number of high-profile cases. He
also has broad experience training new prosecutors and has written
and lectured extensively. Goldberg's opponents for this open seat are
a private practitioner in Santa Monica and a workers' compensation
judge. Goldberg has won high marks from colleagues and judges for his
temperament, sincerity and skill in the courtroom.</LD>
<LD>   Office No. 39: This open-seat race includes two unimpressive and
relatively inexperienced prosecutors and a perennial candidate for
the bench. We nod toward one of the newcomers, Richard Naranjo,
because of his 10 years as a deputy district attorney and his nearly
15 years in business, a non-legal background that is rare on the
bench.</LD>
<TE>   Office No. 40: Superior Court Judge Floyd Baxter is being
challenged by an attorney-arbitrator. The Los Angeles County Bar
Assn. has rated the challenger as "not qualified" and Baxter as "well
qualified," and we see no reason to oppose the reelection of this
capable sitting judge. We endorse Baxter.</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 53: Of the four candidates running for this open seat,
we support Lauren Weis, a deputy district attorney who has the
experience to make a good judge. A prosecutor for 23 years, Weis
helped make major improvements in the way local law enforcement
agencies handle sexual assault victims and prosecute the perpetrators
of these crimes. She has a worthy opponent in longtime private lawyer
Hurschell Don Christian, but we favor Weis because of her evident
commitment to be a judge.</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 67: In this open seat, we support Paul Bacigalupo, the
supervising judge for the state bar who hears lawyer discipline and
misconduct cases. Bacigalupo has a strong background in civil law and
a "well qualified" rating from the bar. One of his three opponents is
David Gelfound, a talented deputy district attorney who may one day
become a judge. But in this election, Bacigalupo has the maturity and
breadth of experience for the job.</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 90: We endorse incumbent Judge Robert Simpson. The bar
association rated Simpson highly and his challenger, a Glendale
lawyer, less so. Simpson is a skilled and solid jurist who brought
years of broad experience as a civil practitioner to the bench. He
should be reelected.</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 100: Richard Walmark, a deputy district attorney for 16
years, has earned the bar's "well qualified" rating because of the
depth of his experience as a prosecutor. Not so for his challengers
for this open seat, one of whom was rated as "not qualified." We
support Walmark.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>California is justly famous for its natural assets--a spectacular
coastline, mountains, beaches and waterways, as well as the variety
of its flora and fauna, from the North Coast redwoods to the Joshua
trees of the Mojave Desert.</LD>
<LD>   But in recent decades, chronic shortages of state funds and lack
of commitment in Sacramento have starved these assets of the
financing needed to save them from development, to cleanse them of
pollution and to rescue and restore them.</LD>
<LD>   The state made up some ground, especially in the state parks, with
voter approval two years ago of a $2.1-billion bond issue. But most
of that money is spent or committed while barely making a dent in the
statewide need.</LD>
<TE>   Voters can help save and preserve the state's gems by approving a
$2.6-billion bond measure, Proposition 40, on the March 5 primary
election ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 40 is particularly vital to Southern California
because of the investment it would make in developing and
rehabilitating urban parks and recreation.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Los Angeles would be guaranteed $47 million for such
facilities. It also would be eligible to compete for an additional
$120 million in potential grants to conservancies seeking to preserve
and restore the San Gabriel and lower Los Angeles rivers, the Baldwin
Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Los Angeles County would get more than $37 million for
parks and recreation areas.</TE>
<TE>   But Proposition 40 is far broader in scope than city parks and
playgrounds. Its allocations include $300 million for purchase of
wildlife habitat; $300 million to protect and restore watersheds,
rivers, lakes, beaches and coastal waters; and $267.5 million for the
purchase, development and preservation of buildings, artifacts and
other properties of cultural and historic importance.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds would be repaid over 20 years. Bonds like this one are
the proper way to finance long-range improvements that will serve
future generations.</TE>
<TE>   The state is well below its informal limits on bond debt, so
Californians proud of their natural heritage can vote for Proposition
40 with no twinges about adding too much to the state's obligations.
Vote yes on Proposition 40.</TE>

<HD>Joe Benon Has Sabor</HD>
<DH>He keeps alive the Jewish cooking of Rhodes here in L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANA MARIA GABRIEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A very old Rhodesli Sephardic woman once told Joseph Benon he had the
gift of sabor. According to the ancient lore of the Spanish Jews,
this means he was born with the flavor of Sephardic food in his
mouth.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to be blessed with sabor to know what this is all
about," says Benon, bustling about his Westwood kitchen, serving up
steaming platters of keftes de gallina (chicken patties), beselias
(fresh peas with meat) and arroz estilo sepora (Sepora's rice).</LD>
<LD>   Benon, a 70-year-old retired grocer, is a highly regarded
Sephardic cook who re-creates the ancient cuisine of the Rhodesli
Sephardim. These Spanish Jews flourished on the Greek island of
Rhodes for more than 500 years. Their vibrant culture was nearly
extinguished by the Holocaust; only an estimated 50 Jews live on the
island today.</LD>
<TE>   The largest population of Rhodesli Sephardim now lives in Southern
California. These Rhodesli have almost entirely assimilated into Los
Angeles' Jewish community over the last 60 years, with most of them
attending local Sephardic synagogues. Benon says very few of the
remaining Rhodesli Sephardim appreciate their traditional cuisine
enough to try to preserve it.</TE>
<TE>   "People call me up regularly and ask me to make things," Benon
says. "But they really don't know about the food, and they really
don't want to know about it. They just want to eat it."</TE>
<TE>   Like many other good cooks, Benon learned about food in his
mother's kitchen. Sepora Benon prepared fresh ingredients every night
for the next day's meals, and insisted her five children learn to
make the family's traditional dishes as they worked by her side.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us kids cook," says Benon. "We started by stringing beans
and shelling peas, then moved on to other things. I learned to cook
like the old-timers, putting in a little bit of this and that until
it's just right."</TE>
<TE>   After marrying his wife, Roslyn, Benon expanded his knowledge of
Sephardic cooking with his mother-in-law's help. Lena Cohen prepared
recipes from Rhodes and taught Benon to appreciate the history of the
cuisine. Benon's cooking is now considered to be so authentic (and
delicious), he is often asked to cater events for the opening of
Sephardic exhibits at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles and
the Sephardic Temple Tifereth Israel in Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   Benon's recipes are rich with the foods of the Mediterranean, all
of which were readily available to the Sephardim in Rhodes. Over the
centuries, Turkish, Greek and Italian influences were gradually
incorporated into the Sephardic community's original Spanish-style
cookery. Rice, meat (especially lamb and chicken), cheese and
vegetables went into the pastries, grain dishes, salads and
casseroles. Olives, lemons, marinated vegetables and anchovies
enhanced their flavors.</TE>
<TE>   Benon's distant cousin, Kaye Israel, is also an excellent Rhodesli
Sephardic cook. She and Benon grew up in the same Rhodesli
neighborhood in Los Angeles around Broadway and 49th Street, where
she remembers young people used to ask their elders not to prepare
the old-style foods.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought the food was too different," Israel says. "We wanted
things we thought were more American, but this changed as we got a
little older and learned to appreciate the food."</TE>
<TE>   Israel's specialties are now the savory pastries that developed in
Rhodes long before her parents immigrated to the United States in the
1920s. Her boyos (spinach and cheese pastries) and burekas (rice and
cheese turnovers) are family favorites, particularly at brunch, where
they are served with hard-boiled eggs and a spinach and pasta souffle
known as quajado de espinaca.</TE>
<TE>   Like Benon, Israel learned to cook traditional foods from her
mother, but it was her aunt who helped perfect her flawless
techniques in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   "My aunt lived close by, and when she wanted company, she would
call and ask, 'Don't you want to bake something?'" Israel recalls.
"She taught me how to make the food well. If it wasn't pretty, or
done exactly right, she would make me do it over!"</TE>
<TE>   Israel teaches a cooking class at the temple. Many of the people
who attend are women who remember eating Sephardic food as children
and now want to make it themselves. They particularly seem to enjoy
the mixture of tradition, technique and just plain fun in Israel's
classes.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody gets to put their hands in the dough and learn how to
work it," Israel said. "It's the best way to learn how to cook this
food, and I tell them about it as we go."</TE>
<TE>   But Benon prefers to share his recipes through a series of five
videos he developed with Sephardic historian Art Benveniste as a
fund-raiser for the temple's programs. In the videos, he gives
detailed explanations for making an array of Rhodesli Sephardic
foods, including baked goods, main dishes, sweets and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   "Hardly anyone knows how to cook this food but me anymore," Benon
says. "That's why I developed the videos, so others will learn how. I
get a lot of requests to cater now that I'm retired, but I cook only
for my family and friends or places like the Skirball museum. For me,
Sephardic cooking is a real labor of love."</TE>

<HD>Clergy Scorn Hahn Over Chief Parks</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was saddened and outraged to read of the two African American
ministers, bolstered by three dozen other Christian men of the cloth
("a preacher called by God," one of them described himself), charging
Mayor James Hahn with attempting to bribe them into silence ("Clergy
Scorn Funds Hahn Offered," Feb. 14).</LD>
<LD>   Here are men who have known and trusted the mayor for 20 years,
who have now taken the moral low road with unsubstantiated charges.
Is their cause so desperate that they must resort to this?</LD>
<LD>   How these men thought their action would help the cause of
reappointing Chief Bernard Parks escapes me. Whether Mayor Hahn did
or did not try to buy someone's silence has nothing to do with the
chief's merits. And they know that--which can only invite the
suspicion that their charges are meant to distract public attention
away from what for most of us is still an unresolved question.</LD>

<TE>   Re Bishop Charles Blake and the Rev. Cecil Murray: I am thankful
that I am neither in their congregations nor the community they
supposedly serve. They could have taken the grants and done something
worthwhile with the money. Instead they chose the political spotlight
to try to make a statement. They should look at the recent crime
stats and see that more and more good people in their community are
becoming victims of violent crimes. They still would have their 1st
Amendment right to speak out even if they took the money.</TE>

<TE>   I have been active in community policing in Van Nuys since the
early '90s. Before Parks became chief we had built up an effective
Neighborhood Watch program that virtually eliminated crime in our
neighborhood. Under Parks the program was dismantled, with disastrous
results. These results are a matter of record. Crime is up.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last three years I joined with other community members to
fight for the return of our community policing program. We have
received only grudging concessions from the chief. We once had
monthly meetings at the Van Nuys Division. The meetings would include
the division commander, senior lead officers and volunteer police
community representatives as well as Neighborhood Watch block
captains. Vital information between neighborhoods was exchanged and
networks were established. The division has not hosted a meeting in
three years.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship between the community and the department has
suffered as a consequence of the chief's policy. Parks must not be
reappointed.</TE>

<LD>In her Feb. 14 commentary, "Liberal Media Ignore What They Don't Want
to Hear," speaking of "special interest bureaucrats," Norah Vincent
claims that "today in America, such flacks are almost exclusively the
property of the complainant left."</LD>
<LD>   This is blatantly false. According to data available at
http://www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists, in 1999 "such flacks" accounted
for less than 6% of all lobbying dollars spent in Washington, a
figure that includes all single-issue lobbyists, not just the
"liberals." A big chunk of that special interest money comes from the
gun lobby and the antiabortion lobby. Finance, insurance and real
estate lobbyists spent three times more than all special interest
lobbyists combined; energy lobbyists (e.g., those working for Enron)
spent twice as much.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thank God for Robert Kuttner ("Needed Now: Healthy Dissent,"
Commentary, Feb. 17). I feared that, somehow, everyone had missed the
dangers evolving from the posturing of President Bush and his aides.
They must not be allowed to use the popularity of a wartime
presidency to take this country into harm's way or to engineer an
election based on accusing people who question his policies or his
political party.</LD>
<LD>   We are a democracy, which needs dissent and opposition parties in
order to survive. As a nation, we need positive opinion from other
nations of the world to pursue world policies that we feel are in our
self-interest. We cannot be an aggressor nation. We cannot wage war
on anyone and everyone we think may be our future enemies. Only
dictators and megalomaniacs think they can rule the world and make it
conform to their concept of what is true, right and desirable. Let us
all join in the debate regarding what is perceived as good and right
for this great nation and the rest of the world.</LD>
<LD>   Albert J. Grafsky Jr.</LD>
<TE>   Palm Desert</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps some of the answers to Kuttner's questions can be found in
the way in which George W. Bush became president. Fifty-two percent
of the voters voted left of center (49% for Gore, 3% for Nader).
After weeks of political battle, the Supreme Court intervened and
awarded the presidency to Bush. The numbers suggest that the voters
would not be supportive of an extreme right-wing agenda. Bush,
knowing this, but also knowing that he owed so much to the right wing
of the Republican Party, chose to ignore the electorate and steered
to the extreme right.</TE>
<TE>   History is replete with examples of leaders who, without any
mandate, came to govern with a dictatorial hand. The question is,
with only eight months until the midterm election, is there a
political party that will have the courage to take up the debate and
restore dissent? An obvious choice would be that the Democratic Party
should lead the debate. Of course, 49% of the electorate thought the
choice was obvious in November 2000.</TE>

<TE>   San Clemente</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The tried-and-true adage "actions speak louder than words" has
afforded Bush the privilege of having very high popularity ratings.
When are our president and some of his Cabinet members going to
realize this? His repetitious, hyperbolic rhetoric is frowned upon by
an inordinate number of American citizens and by many of our allies.</TE>
<TE>   True patriotic actions promote freedom; hyperbolic rhetoric does
not.</TE>

<LD>   The California Medical Assn., which is sponsoring AB 1600, and
Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley (D-Santa Cruz), who introduced the bill,
asked Richman, the only physician in the California Legislature, to
coauthor the bill precisely because of his background in this complex
subject.</LD>
<LD>   Who better to address the unfairness of HMO contracts than
Richman, who has been on the front lines battling the HMOs for his

<LD>Regarding your photographs of Sheriff Lee Baca's and L.A. Police
Chief Bernard Parks' stars (Inside Politics, Feb. 18), you are
absolutely right. The reason for the number of stars is lost in the
mists of history. To set the record straight: The office of sheriff
of L.A. County is an elected position. He is the chief law
enforcement officer in Los Angeles County, therefore the fifth star.
All other chiefs of police in county police agencies wear four stars.
The rank and structure of most law enforcement agencies derive their
lineage from the military. Army Gen. Omar Bradley, during World War
II, for instance, wore five stars.</LD>
<LD>   The L.A. County sheriff is also the chief for Region 1, which
includes Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside
counties, during major emergencies, artificial or natural, and he
reports to the state Office of Emergency Services. Yes, the fifth
star is symbolic but appropriate.</LD>

<HD>Powell's Candor on Condom Use</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Colin Powell is to be commended for speaking out
in favor of condom use ("Unlike His Boss, Powell Takes Pro-Condom
Stand," Feb. 15). As for those who are criticizing him for doing so,
it's clear that they're more interested in advancing a sex-negative
agenda than they are in saving lives.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, abstinence should be taught. But it should be taught as part
of a complete program of sex education, including information on
masturbation and all forms of contraception. While it is true that
abstinence is the surest way to avoid sexually transmitted disease
and pregnancy, it's also true that proper condom use greatly reduces
those risks. This is not a "mixed message," it's just simply the
truth.</LD>
<LD>   True education means teaching all the facts, not merely those that
support a given agenda. Abstinence-only sex "education" is not
education at all, it's indoctrination.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "U.S. Shouldn't Indulge China's Taiwan Fantasy," Commentary, Feb.
14: Right on! As Daniel C. Lynch points out, the collective
identities of the Taiwanese and the Chinese are too distinct to forge
a natural political unification. It defies logic to think that a
country of 23 million people with a democratically elected president
can be pressured to forgo its hard-earned freedom and democracy to
become part of the largest holdout communist country in the world.</LD>
<LD>   Once the Chinese government becomes disillusioned with its
"natural unification" fantasy, only a show of solid public support to
the Taiwanese democracy from the U.S. can head off a dangerous
military confrontation in this game of chicken.</LD>

<TE>   Lynch is misleading the American people by saying that the
collective identities of the Taiwanese and Chinese people "remain too
distinct." In fact, the Chinese and Taiwanese are all Chinese, with
the same cultural origin. His argument is not even following the U.S.
China policy: One China, and Taiwan is a part of China.</TE>
<TE>   Even worse, he distorts the history, saying, "Taiwan never really
has been a part of China." Since World War II, Taiwan has been
returned to China from Japanese occupation by international treaties
and recognized by the U.N. and the U.S. Lynch's avowal of an
independent Taiwan is not even supported by the U.S. government.</TE>

<LD>Re "Clinton Library Expected to Benefit Black Businesses," Feb. 15: I
would like to remind all the black people in Arkansas who think that
Bill Clinton was "our first black president" that it was President
Lyndon B. Johnson who fought and then passed the first civil rights
bill after the Civil War, and it was also Johnson who put the first
black man, Thurgood Marshall, on the U.S. Supreme Court.</LD>
<LD>   Clinton had several chances of nominating a black man or woman to
the Supreme Court but he chose two white people instead. I am sure
that he did treat the black people with respect and was of help to
them, but to say that he was the first president to respect the black
people is an insult to all the things that Lyndon B. Johnson did at a
time when racism was a popular attitude in this country.</LD>

<LD>A new Valley city should be proud of evolving from a historically
great city, Los Angeles. So why not retain part of that name? But
North Los Angeles would suggest, erroneously, that the new city was
merely a geographical segment of L.A. (letter, Feb. 14). So,
repeating my suggestion made over a year ago, omit the "Los" and
simply call it North Angeles.</LD>

<HD>How to Eat Like Esther</HD>
<DH>The heroine of the Purim story was a strict vegetarian.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDY ZEIDLER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Queen Esther, the heroine of the Purim tale, was quite a woman. Not
only did she outwit the evil Haman and save the entire Jewish
population of Persia, she did it all as a vegetarian. Or, by today's
standards, a vegan.</LD>
<LD>   According to tradition, when Esther married King Ahasuerus and
moved into the palace, she ate only fruits, beans and grains. Legend
has it that poppy and caraway seed pastries were her favorites.</LD>
<LD>   In keeping with this, when we celebrate Purim this year (it begins
Monday evening) I will be serving Chickpea Pizza, a spring salad of
fennel and lima beans, Mushroom-Barley Soup and a Caraway Bundt Cake.</LD>
<TE>   Chickpea Pizza is based on the Provencal dish socca, which is
usually eaten as a midmorning snack. Along the Italian Riviera it is
called farinata, and it is served at lunch topped with chopped
tomatoes and capers. Made with only ground chickpea flour and water,
it takes just minutes to make and can be prepared ahead of time and
refrigerated.</TE>
<TE>   It is also delicious served plain or topped with spices, cheese,
vegetables and olives--but always include a liberal sprinkling of
fresh ground pepper. While it is traditionally baked in a brick oven
in pizza pans, my method calls for stove-top cooking, then finishing
under the broiler.</TE>
<TE>   Beans--fresh, frozen or dried--are always included in our Purim
menu. With the beginning of spring, I take advantage of the arrival
of the fresh beans at the local outdoor farmers' market. Lima beans
are now coming into season, and when combined with diced fennel and
extra-virgin olive oil they make a perfect Purim salad served over
finely sliced lettuce.</TE>
<TE>   The Mushroom-Barley Soup that I prepare for Purim is made without
chicken or meat broth. What gives this soup texture and depth of
flavor is fresh shiitake mushrooms. Remember to cook the soup
vegetables briefly before adding the barley and water. This is a
satisfying soup that is hearty enough to be a main course.</TE>
<TE>   Almost everyone associates caraway seeds with rye bread, but you
will be amazed at the way their aromatic, distinctive flavor
highlights this Caraway Bundt Cake. It is made with egg whites, and
although it contains no egg yolks, the texture resembles a pound
cake. As a holiday Purim dessert, it is a perfect accompaniment to
the wine that is such an important part of the celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Make mini-cakes using the same recipe, and the family can give
them as gifts to those less fortunate. These are known as
shalachmones, and giving them is the custom during the Purim holiday.</TE>

<TE>   Sift the chickpea flour with 1/2 teaspoon of salt into a bowl.
Slowly add the water, whisking constantly to form a paste. Beat with
a wire whisk until smooth. Let the batter stand, covered, at room

<TE>   In a 10-inch nonstick, ovenproof skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the
olive oil over medium-high heat. Stir the batter and pour 1/2 the
batter into the skillet, tipping and swirling it to evenly coat the

and the top is almost set, 2 to 3 minutes. Burst any large air
bubbles with the tip of a knife. Sprinkle 1/2 of the tomato and green
onions along with pepper to taste on top.</TE>
<TE>   Place the pan under the broiler and cook until golden and crisp,
about 2 to 3 minutes. Slide the pizza onto a work surface. Sprinkle
with salt to taste and half the Parmesan cheese. Cut the pizza into
wedges and serve hot. Repeat with the remaining batter.</TE>

<HD>Davis Ad Uses Deukmejian to Attack Riordan</HD>
<DH>Politics: TV spot quotes GOP former governor-- not a Davis
ally-- questioning former mayor's character.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest twist in an increasingly strange campaign, former
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian surfaced Tuesday in a new TV ad
attacking Richard Riordan--an ad sponsored by Democratic Gov. Gray
Davis.</LD>
<LD>   The spot, airing statewide, renews Davis' attacks on Riordan over
the death penalty and abortion. It also broadens the assault to
suggest that Riordan has "flip-flopped" on taxes.</LD>
<LD>   Then it quotes Deukmejian--no friend of Davis--questioning
Riordan's character.</LD>
<TE>   "Former Gov. George Deukmejian says Riordan tries to be all things
to all people and questions his commitment to principles," the ad
intones.</TE>
<TE>   The spot began airing statewide as Riordan campaigned on education
reform, Jones attacked the former Los Angeles mayor's party
credentials and the third major GOP candidate, Bill Simon Jr., picked
up the endorsement of a gun owners' group.</TE>
<TE>   It is odd--if not altogether unprecedented in California--for a
candidate of one party to feature such a prominent figure from
another in his advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Odder still, Deukmejian is being showcased in an ad touting his
preferred candidate, fellow Republican Bill Jones. Secretary of State
Jones, however, is struggling financially and paid less than $100,000
for his first round of advertising, in Fresno, Bakersfield and San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Davis has sunk $1.5 million into the new anti-Riordan
ad--meaning it will get more than 10 times the exposure of the
pro-Jones spot with Deukmejian.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of respect for the former governor of California,"
said Garry South, chief strategist for the Davis campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the advertisement's strange-bedfellows nature, South
replied, "When is the last time a former governor of California
publicly came out and said he could not vote for his party's
front-runner?"</TE>
<TE>   Deukmejian, in Jones' ad and in a series of appearances across the
state, has repeatedly criticized Riordan for his generous support of
Democratic candidates and causes over the last two decades. "Riordan
is a man I couldn't vote for," Deukmejian says in Jones' limited-run
advertisement.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has been aggressively attacking Riordan on the airwaves for
the last several weeks, well before the March 5 primary that will
decide the GOP nomination. The unusual strategy is an attempt to
undermine Riordan and possibly tip the race to one of the opponents
that Davis would prefer to face in November--or failing that, weaken
Riordan in advance of the general election.</TE>
<TE>   As Davis stepped up his television assault, Riordan sought to keep
the campaign focused on education, challenging the state's school
district administrators to make their budgets public.</TE>
<TE>   Citing a study from a Claremont McKenna College research
institute, Riordan complained that districts throughout the state
waste money that could be better spent in the classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "Show us the money," said Riordan, making a short campaign stop at
a school in Bell. "If we know how much is spent in the classroom for
essentials, then school officials will have to explain where the rest
of the money is going."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said that California now spends more money on education
than the annual state budgets of Oregon, Washington, Nevada and
Arizona combined--almost $54 billion. But, according to the study,
some schools spend less than 40% of their funds on classroom
expenses. The rest of the money is used for "bloat," Riordan said.
"It has become impossible to determine how much money is being spent
in the classroom versus funding to support inefficient bureaucracy,"
Riordan said.</TE>
<TE>   He added: "You're going to need a strong accounting arm in
Sacramento to make sure they've got it right. For years bureaucrats
have been experts at hiding what they've been doing."</TE>
<TE>   As Riordan challenged school administrators to open their ledgers,
Jones continued to attack Riordan's party loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's running in the wrong primary," Jones told about 25
members of a Los Angeles County Republicans' club at a luncheon in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Simon was campaigning in the Central Valley--Fresno,
Sacramento and Chico--to tout his endorsement by the Gun Owners of
California. The far larger National Rifle Assn. has endorsed Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Simon called for a moratorium on new gun laws and said that if
elected he would study whether existing laws are feasible. "Our most
important gun legislation [is] the gun laws that are designed to keep
guns out of the hands of bad people," Simon said, citing the
three-strikes and the 10-20-life laws that allow enhanced penalties
for felonies committed with firearms.</TE>

<HD>Berkeley Class on Sexuality Suspended After Reports of Orgy</HD>
<DH>Education: University plans an inquiry into the
student-run, for-credit class.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON and STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UC Berkeley has suspended a course on male sexuality amid allegations
that its students engaged in an orgy at a class party and watched a
student coordinator have sex onstage at a strip club.</LD>
<LD>   The university suspended the student-run, for-credit class after
its coordinators failed to show up for a meeting last week with a
faculty sponsor. Allegations about the course were published Friday
in the campus newspaper, the Daily Californian.</LD>
<LD>   UC Berkeley spokeswoman Janet Gilmore said the university is
investigating the course and also reviewing its counterpart, a class
on female sexuality.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously, the events described in the Daily Cal are not part of
the approved course content," Gilmore said Tuesday. "Right now, we're
just trying to find out what happened. We're taking this very
seriously."</TE>
<TE>   The faculty sponsor of both classes, Caren Kaplan, who is chair of
the Women's Studies Department, could not be reached for comment
Tuesday. Neither could students in the course.</TE>
<TE>   The sexuality courses are offered under UC Berkeley's popular
"democratic education at California" program, known as "de-cal," and
are sponsored but not funded by the university. They are initiated
and run by student coordinators with a faculty member responsible for
overseeing the content and grades, university officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The roughly 100 offerings for the spring semester include a
history of the state of Israel, Greek folk-dancing lessons and a
class about blackjack, according to the schedule on the de-cal Web
site. Students receive up to 4 units of credit.</TE>
<TE>   The Daily Californian reported Friday that several students
involved in the male sexuality class said the orgy occurred at a
party held at the home of an instructor and was intended to help
students get acquainted. It was not mandatory, an instructor said.</TE>
<TE>   The paper reported students saying some of those who attended
played a game in which they privately took Polaroid pictures of their
genitalia, with the group later attempting to match the photos with
the correct owner.</TE>
<TE>   According to the newspaper, another student said a group of
students chose a trip to a gay strip club as their final project,
where they watched the class leaders strip and have sex on stage.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged incidents and resulting suspension touched off an
uproar this week on the famously liberal campus. In letters Tuesday
to the editor of the Daily Californian, several students vigorously
defended the sexuality classes. Alumni, in contrast, ridiculed the
offerings and threatened to withhold support from the university as a
result.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Sexton, news editor of the newspaper, said some students
have called the classes among the best at Berkeley, although he has
some qualms. "The majority of the class is just like a counseling
session, with people talking about their sexual experiences. While
that's fine, I don't feel it should be for credit."</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Ahn, an official of the student government organization
that sponsors the courses, said most students still support the
de-cal program and the sexuality classes because they deal with
topics important to students but often taboo in society at large.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore, the school spokeswoman, said Kaplan called a meeting of
coordinators for both the male and female sexuality classes riday and
suspended the male class immediately when its coordinator did not
appear.</TE>

<LD>"It's a wine from Alsace, the '96 Marc Tempe Gewurztraminer 'Grand
Cru Mambourg.' It's from the warmest area of Alsace, and the wines
develop a rich and spicy character. My wife and I enjoyed it at the
Sierra Mar restaurant at the Post Ranch Inn in Big Sur--a fabulous
spot. It was stunning with foie gras. Gewurztraminer is so rich that
it works well with foie gras."</LD>

<HD>The New Face of Natural Foods</HD>
<DH>Forget nut loaves, brown rice and homeopathic remedies.
Yesterday's health food stores are today's gourmet pleasure palaces.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The newest branch of Whole Foods Market is in Porter Ranch, a
development cutting into the windy horse country of the Santa Susana
Mountains. Set in one of the last semi-wild corners of the San
Fernando Valley, it's a neighborhood where everything seems new. The
mall is new, the homes nearby are new and, inside, on aisle after
aisle stocked with delicacies, the face of the American health-food
movement is brand-spanking new.</LD>
<LD>   Gone are the stripped pine shelves, the greasy brown rice
stir-fries, the leaden baked goods, the anemic staff and the
conviction that meat is murder. Here clerks are not ornery ideologues
but bright-eyed, smartly turned-out food handlers looking for careers
in the grocery business.</LD>
<LD>   As customers leave the floral section and enter the produce area,
misters spray butter lettuces and bouquets of fresh herbs. There are
organic fruits, fruits from farms "in conversion" to organic and just
plain fruit. The fish counter stocks thick swordfish steaks, Atlantic
salmon, prawns, live mussels and tilapia so fresh the eyes still
stand proud. Workers behind the fish counter offer samples of
bouillabaisse and lobster bisque.</LD>
<TE>   Nearby, another is taking a feather duster to the selection of
balsamic vinegars. Next to it is a display of easily 50 kinds of
extra-virgin olive oils, including the delicious (and organic)
Spanish L'Estornell.</TE>
<TE>   Moving on, there is a meat counter. Not just any meat counter, but
one displaying well-marbled New York strip, New Zealand lamb and
prime rib eye; next to it is a dry-aging room for sides of beef. Over
at the deli, 16 types of olives are displayed in sumptuous platters,
including Nicoise, black sun-dried, Alfonso, Cerignola, Calamata and
Lucques. This is not a discount store. The olives are $7.99 a pound,
the rib eye $14.59 a pound.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere there is a cheese aging room and a wood-fired pizza
oven. There is an in-store bakery. There is a catering operation
making everything from salads to pizzas to stews. Over there, fresh
coffee is roasting. Back that way is a large wine section.</TE>
<TE>   If this is a health food store, it begs the question: What is Dean
&amp; DeLuca?</TE>
<TE>   The change from lentil loaves to gourmet food can be explained in
two ways: one, that the American health-food movement has come of
age; or, two, that it has sold out. Either way, a market sector that
made its name being anti-establishment is now the darling of the
grocery industry, with growth rates that analysts say are four times
that of mainstream supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   Whole Foods, followed by Wild Oats, both public companies listed
on NASDAQ, have not just led the make-over of the health food
industry; for all intents and purposes, they are the industry. Whole
Foods Market has 125 stores in 23 states, and Wild Oats has 107
stores in 22 states.</TE>
<TE>   Under Whole Foods, old stores have been refurbished and new stores
are being conceived as latter-day pleasure palaces. Gone is the
notion of food solely as cure for body and social ills in one
mouthful. Those partial to Oreos do not have to skulk off to the
competition to feed their vice. Rather, they are offered supposedly
cleaned-up versions without hydrogenated fat.</TE>
<TE>   While they are now big businesses, both chains began not so long
ago as humble health-food stores--John Mackey, Craig Weller and Mark
Skiles opened Whole Foods in Austin, Texas, in 1980, and Mike
Gilliland and Elizabeth Cook opened the vegetarian shop Wild Oats in
Boulder, Colo., in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   But it did not take long for them to display distinctly
carnivorous business instincts. Both groups rapidly expanded their
chains by taking over smaller businesses around the country. In
Southern California, Whole Foods took over Mrs Gooch's in Los Angeles
in 1993; Wild Oats took over Henry's Markets in San Diego in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Whole Foods first set the tone for the romping new sybaritism, and
by doing so gained the business edge. According to Investors Business
Daily, Whole Foods had the vision to spot that the market for pills
and potions was limited but that the quality grocery business was
wide open. Wild Oats was slower backing away from its emphasis on
homeopathic antidepressants and aromatherapies.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers tell the story: Whole Foods' annual sales in 2000 were
$1.8 billion, more than twice those of Wild Oats. Whole Foods' 2001
figures, which were just released, show a rise to more than $2.2
billion. Wild Oats' 2001 figures won't be released until next week.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Wild Oats is in a state of market correction. Last
March, founder Gilliland resigned and the chain appointed Perry Odak
from Ben &amp; Jerry's as its leader. Odak, in turn, brought in a slew of
new vice presidents who have come from companies like Coca-Cola and
the Gap.</TE>
<TE>   Change is now proceeding apace. Funky and poorly performing stores
are being closed--six have been shut down in recent months--and four
new openings are scheduled for this year, including one in Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   As the chain updates and upgrades, there have been some awkward
transitions. For example, the Hollywood Wild Oats was sold last year
but remained open through January, trading under the company's name.
The result was a mixture that might not have fit the new Wild Oats
image: A masseuse offered head massages near the meat counter, and a
poster inquiring "Do you experience two to three bowel movements per
day?" was propped up near the deli section.</TE>
<TE>   While some stores bearing the name are not Wild Oats, some stores
actually owned by the chain go by other names. The company has
allowed some chains it has taken over to retain their formats and
much of their independence.</TE>
<TE>   One example is the Henry's Marketplace stores in San Diego. These
are low-key suburban stores with produce displayed on tables. For
every conventional Fuji apple, there will be an organic one. A meat
counter displays pre-speared kebabs and carne asada; there is some
wine and your choice of real or soy ice cream. The resident dietitian
chatters avidly about the benefits of eating like a caveman.</TE>
<TE>   To reconcile the new, reformed Wild Oats with the slightly shaggy
but familiar Henry's, Henry's has become the chain's "farmers market
division."</TE>
<TE>   The mix can be confusing. Asked which is the real Wild Oats,
company spokeswoman Sonja Tuitele points to the new
26,000-square-foot branch in Irvine, or the smart Santa Monica
branch, where customers are as likely to be buying fresh arugula,
Tuscan olive oil and English tea as echinacea and Tofurky. The new
Wild Oats, says Tuitele, marries the "gourmet" and the "natural."</TE>
<TE>   But it has a way to go to catch up with Whole Foods, which picked
up the theme of eco-gourmandism and ran with it, consistently,
nationally and on a supermarket scale. Key to the Whole Foods formula
are huge stores in what it calls the "big box" format--35,000 square
feet, on average 10,000 square feet larger than Wild Oats' new sites
in California.</TE>
<TE>   Equally important is location. Whole Foods plans to position "big
boxes" in areas where the average household income is $50,000 or
more. This leads the shops to chase new suburban developments such as
Porter Ranch. Michael Besancon, president of the southern Pacific
region of Whole Foods, defends the strategy, although in an ideal
world, he says, the sprawl would stop, we would preserve the
countryside, and visionary retailers would lead the redevelopment of
neglected inner cities.</TE>
<TE>   Besancon, who describes himself as a card-carrying
environmentalist who marched in the first Earth Day parade, got into
the health-food business in 1970, founding Follow Your Heart Natural
Foods in Canoga Park. He is a vegetarian of 32 years, but one of the
best New York strip steaks for sale anywhere in Los Angeles is at a
meat counter just behind him. "I keep my personal bias to myself," he
says. His corporate barometer for a product, he says, is excellence.
"If we're going to carry a product, it's going to be the best."</TE>
<TE>   The emphasis on quality is not accidental. The Hartman group, a
market research company in Bellevue, Wash., that studies the
"wellness" industries, recently surveyed Whole Foods customers. Among
"lifestyle segments," they found that foodies outnumbered vegetarians
by more than three to one, and the fitness-minded by two to one.</TE>
<TE>   The old customers are still catered to. It's just that the meat
counter is better positioned than the one with soy products, and the
"nutraceuticals" are sequestered off in an unobtrusive aisle, in much
the same way a conventional supermarket might stock personal hygiene
products.</TE>
<TE>   The new star, quite simply, is the food. Besancon says one of the
major thrusts in the new orientation is on "artisan product." This is
Whole Food-ese for foods made on smaller farms, with a degree of Old
World craft involved.</TE>
<TE>   Vivien Straus' family runs Straus Family Creamery in Marin County,
an organic dairy that makes nonhomogenized milk, whole-milk yogurt
and smoothies. She says Besancon's claim is not just bluster--Whole
Foods is good to the small guys. "Without them we wouldn't exist,"
she says. Whole Foods not only stocks their products, but in Northern
California it helped devise a returnable bottle program.</TE>
<TE>   The staff seems enthusiastic about what it sells. At the deli
counter someone offers spiced olives. Nearby a woman is handing out
tastes of brie with fig paste. Convenience is a constant theme, but
with a quality that brings to mind French traiteurs rather than
American-style takeout joints. For roughly the same price it costs to
order from Domino's, you can walk away from Whole Foods with a
freshly baked goat cheese and olive pizza. Or you can buy an unbaked,
pre-assembled one to cook at home. And instead of a liter of Coke,
you can buy a bottle of wine.</TE>
<TE>   But for all the service, for all the cheery bustle, to catch and
keep foodies, Whole Foods is finding it has to do more than buy food
from small producers. It's going to have to train its own class of
artisans. Butchers, says Besancon, are almost impossible to find, and
the chain is now training its own staff in a bid to save a dying
craft.</TE>
<TE>   Cheese fares worse than meat. Whole Foods stocks the full gamut of
cheeses from Neal's Yard in London, including one of only two
authentic Cheddars left in production in all of England. It charges
Neal's Yard prices, too (as high as $17 per pound). But while Neal's
Yard picks up the cheeses at the farms, ages them, then cuts them to
order at a well-displayed cheese counter, Whole Foods sells the
cheese the same way it might treat processed "Cheddar" from Kraft--in
pre-cut, misshapen, plastic-wrapped clumps, which it displays piled
up in a refrigerated case.</TE>
<TE>   Besancon defends the pre-cut cheese by saying customers wouldn't
have the patience to wait for it to be cut to order and wrapped
properly. "Nobody would buy it," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But the new stores come in for their harshest criticism not from
foodies but from the old guard of the health-food movement. Peter
Lassen of the Lassen chain of health food stores in Ventura County
says these new models have lost their way by pandering to the
crossover set with doppelgangers of junk food. "We draw a line in the
sand to keep with the cleaner products," he says. "We're not
interested in carrying Cheerios or Coke or the crossover things that
the mainstream does."</TE>
<TE>   Whole Foods has not only crossed that line, it is doing a victory
dance in the end zone. It is now celebrating National Snack Foods
Month by pushing its organic pretzels, imitation Oreos and air-popped
popcorn. To promote these as somehow wholesome, it offers advice from
its "snack coach," Alana Sugar: "Frequent, balanced snacking is one
of the best things you can do to promote well-being," says Sugar.</TE>
<TE>   A health-food chain peddling Oreo-type cookies and observing
National Snack Month in a country where the federal government is
simultaneously declaring obesity an epidemic has a mad kind of daring
about it. Read the fine print of Whole Foods promotional material,
and behind all the salsa and corn chip serving tips, the chain
insists that what it is doing is promoting "responsible snacking."</TE>
<TE>   But the more obvious reason for the lusty new abandon is a
paradigm shift in the health-food movement. A generation that set out
to reform its customers now seems intent on pleasing them, and
profiting while it's at it. Whole Foods and Wild Oats are now
adjusting their values to fit the marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   "We're creatures of the demands of our customers," says Besancon.
"Our customers expect us to have strawberries year-round. If our
competitors do, we have to."</TE>

<HD>California Syrah Starts to Show What It Can Do</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES E. OLKEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Syrah, the grape behind the great reds of Hermitage and Cote Rotie in
France's Northern Rhone, is just now catching on in a big way. West
Coast plantings have increased so fast that the 1999 vintage, the
most recent on the market, only represents something like 25% of the
present acreage.</LD>
<LD>   In all the excitement, it's important to remember that the better
part of Syrah's story is yet to be tasted. It takes three to five
years for a vine to bear fruit, and then it's 18 to 30 months before
the wineries release their finished wines.</LD>
<LD>   The early days of planting a new variety are always an interesting
time. Without any firm information about where the variety will do
well, vineyardists tend to plant it everywhere. When that happened
with Cabernet Sauvignon during the early 1970s, it turned out that
many of their guesses were expensively wrong.</LD>
<TE>   Now we have a Syrah planting boom, with grapes going in everywhere
from the cool Carneros region, which straddles Napa and Sonoma, to
the very warm Lodi area of the Central Valley. Logic and past
experience tell us the variety will probably not succeed equally well
in both places.</TE>
<TE>   Still, as the wines recommended here illustrate, Syrah seems to be
amazingly flexible, making good wines in a wide variety of locations,
with the possible exception of the very coolest sites.</TE>
<TE>   * 1999 Bridlewood Winery "Winners Circle Selection," San Luis
Obispo County, $22. This Syrah has been blended with 20% Viognier, a
technique used in France to lighten the wine, but you can't really
tell here, because ripeness overrides all else. Tastes of blackberry
jam and chocolate together with sweet oak provide plenty of richness,
and the nominal tannins will need just a few years to soften.</TE>
<TE>   * 1999 Bridlewood Winery, Central Coast, $18. Brighter at first
blush than the reserve selection, this one is also fairly tight.
While less expensive than its mate above, it will probably last
longer in your cellar.</TE>
<TE>   * 1999 Brophy Clark Cellars, Santa Ynez Valley, $16. Showing the
gamy side of Syrah, this wine is long and outgoing with vibrant
fruitiness firmed up by crisp acidity. It shows intriguing touches of
minerals in its lengthy, lightly tannic finish.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1999 Cakebread Cellars, Carneros, Napa Valley, $45. Yes, it is
expensive, but Cakebread's lovely Syrah needs mentioning, not just
because of its quality but because it hails from the cool Carneros
District--not usually associated with Syrah. It smells of rich oak
spice, optimally ripened blackberry fruit and complex accents of clay
and loam. So rich and outgoing that it's tempting to drink it now,
this wine will get better with some aging.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1999 Columbia Crest Winery "Reserve," Columbia Valley, $25. The
wineries and growers of Washington have made a massive commitment to
Syrah. We are seeing just the first of those now, and the results are
promising. This wine earned star ratings, as did wines from McCrea
Cellars (the 1999 "Amerique" especially), Cayuse Vineyards and Hogue
Cellars. They all impress with balance and depth, though none of them
matches the Columbia Crest's pure blackberry fruit intensity.</TE>
<TE>   *** 1999 Lewis Cellars, Napa Valley, $55. Here is the deepest,
most exciting Syrah of the 120 tasted. Winemaker and former Indy
racer Randy Lewis has crafted a delightful, delicious wine focused on
complex fruit smelling and tasting of ripe berries, black plums,
sweet cream and roasted vanilla beans. Despite its fullness of body,
it retains good balance throughout.</TE>
<TE>   * 1999 Paraiso Springs Winery "Santa Lucia Highlands," $22. The
Santa Lucia Highlands near Monterey are better known for Pinot Noir,
but this tasty effort and the ** 1999 Testarossa Vineyards "Garys'
Vineyard," $24, make a strong case that the warmer parts of the area
may also be Syrah territory. This wine has the fruit and the spice of
Syrah while steering clear of the gamy aspects of the grape that can
show up in many California and Washington Syrahs.</TE>
<TE>   $* 2000 Rosenblum Cellars "Abba Vineyard," Lodi, $13. The Lodi
growing region, between Stockton and Sacramento in the Central
Valley, is awash in new plantings and boasts more acreage under vine
than the Napa Valley. Of course, it is not as successful as Napa, and
Lodi's hot climate and very deep soils may mean it will never
challenge Napa for greatness. But this wine, one of the few Lodi
Syrahs to cross my tasting table, is ripe, rich, somewhat soft but
tasty. It's well suited for current drinking.</TE>

<HD>Wine of the Week</HD>
<DH>2000 Mas de Daumas Gassac Vin de Pays de l'Herault Blanc,
Languedoc, France.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Located in Languedoc, just west of Montpellier, Mas de Daumas Gassac
is best known for a Cabernet that can hold its own against some of
the top Bordeaux. Ownes Aime and Veronique Guibert also make this
remarkable white, a blend of Chardonnay and Viognier. It's the
Viognier that's responsible for its lacy texture and delicate scent
of violets, orange blossom and honey. What I love best about it is
the long, lovely finish.</LD>
<LD>   The crisp acidity of the 2000 vintage means this is an especially
food-friendly wine. It's a wonderful alternative to straight
Chardonnay with appetizers, smoked salmon, asparagus risotto or other
light first courses.</LD>
<LD>   About $28. Available at The Wine House in Los Angeles, (310)
479-3731; Woodland Hills Wine Co. in Woodland Hills, (818) 222-1111;
and Wine Exchange in Orange, (714) 974-1454. If you can't find this
wine, have your local store call the distributor, Grapevine, (310)
338-9463.</LD>

<HD>Chicken Soup for the Bowl</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like many Americans, I have fond memories of family dinners that
began with a savory bowl of steaming chicken noodle soup. There's no
mystery to its preparation; the chicken does all the work as it
simmers unattended. But there are a few important basics to keep in
mind.</LD>
<LD>   Use lots of bony pieces, such as wings and backs, and dark-meat
cuts such as legs and thighs. (An acquaintance recently complained
that no matter what she does, her soup doesn't compare with those at
restaurants. It turns out that she uses boneless chicken breasts,
lots of water and no salt--no wonder her soup lacks flavor.) If your
butcher can get you a stewing hen, it will need more time to simmer
but will produce a superb soup.</LD>
<LD>   Supporting flavors come from aromatic vegetables--onions, carrots
and celery. Garlic is a great addition, as are leeks, parsnips or
parsley roots, when you have them. Include a few herbs or spices,
such as thyme, bay leaves and parsley stems for the French bouquet
garni. Dill gives an Eastern European flavor, ginger root and
cilantro an Asian accent and cumin, turmeric and plenty of pepper a
Middle Eastern touch.</LD>
<TE>   If you want noodles or rice in your soup, cook them separately so
the starch they give off won't cloud the broth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Levy is the author of "1,000 Jewish Recipes" (Hungry Minds, 2000).</TE>
<TE>   Chicken Soup With Dill And Cumin</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 50 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 2 hours</TE>
<TE>   I often turn my chicken soup into a main course by adding extra
carrots and plenty of other vegetables--zucchini, winter squash,
mushrooms, asparagus, potatoes or green beans. Personally I prefer my
soup less salty than typical deli versions, but it always needs some
salt. The seasoning combination of dill, bay leaves and cumin in this
recipe is popular in Israel. You can keep chicken soup in a covered
container for a few days in the refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 to 3 pounds chicken pieces, preferably thighs or legs</TE>
<TE>   1 large onion, cut in large dice</TE>
<TE>   4 carrots (3/4 pound), peeled if you like, sliced 1 inch thick</TE>
<TE>   4 to 6 boiling potatoes (1 1/4 pounds), peeled, cut into 1-inch
squares, or 1 1/2 cups thin egg noodles</TE>
<TE>   2 large stalks celery with leafy tops, sliced, optional</TE>
<TE>   2 bay leaves</TE>
<TE>   6 to 8 cups water</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 to 2 teaspoons ground cumin</TE>
<TE>   4 zucchini (1 pound), sliced 1 inch thick</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound mushrooms, quartered, optional</TE>
<TE>   4 cloves garlic, chopped</TE>
<TE>   3 or 4 tablespoons chopped fresh dill or 1 tablespoon dried</TE>
<TE>   Place the chicken, onion, carrots, potatoes (but not the noodles),
celery and bay leaves in a large stew pan or soup pot. Pour in enough
water to cover the ingredients by about 1 inch. Bring to a boil. With
a large spoon, remove the foam from the soup's surface. Add salt,
pepper and cumin to taste. Cover and cook over low heat, occasionally
skimming off the foam and fat, until the chicken is tender, about 45
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Add the zucchini, mushrooms and garlic and bring to a simmer.
Cover and cook over low heat until the vegetables are tender and the
soup is well flavored, about 15 minutes. Discard the bay leaves.</TE>
<TE>   If adding noodles, bring a saucepan of water to boil and add salt.
Add the noodles, stir and cook uncovered over high heat until tender,
about 5 to 7 minutes. Drain well. Keep the noodles in a separate dish
so they won't soften when you reheat the soup.</TE>
<TE>   Skim the fat from the broth with a large spoon. If you refrigerate
the soup until cold, the fat solidifies on top and can be easily
removed. Remove the chicken and discard its skin. Leave the pieces
whole or cut off the meat, discarding the bones. Return the chicken
to the soup or save part of it for other uses.</TE>
<TE>   Reheat the soup to a simmer. Add the dill and more salt and
pepper, if needed. Divide the noodles among shallow soup bowls, then
ladle the hot soup over them.</TE>

<HD>City Council Supports Building Schools on Ambassador Hotel
Site</HD>
<DH>Land use: In answer to preservationists' concerns, the
board urges L.A. Unified to investigate the importance of saving the
historic structure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of debate, the Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to
support the construction of one or more schools on the property of
the former Ambassador Hotel, while leaving open the possibility that
the school district might preserve the historic structure.</LD>
<LD>   The council stopped just short of taking a position supporting
preservation of the building and instead agreed to encourage the
district to "review the historic aspects of the site."</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Nate Holden said the council should not force
preservation if it would hinder building schools or providing new
commercial uses along Wilshire Boulevard near the hotel, which is in
his district. The council action urges the Los Angeles Unified School
District to pursue development consistent with the city general plan,
which designates the Wilshire Boulevard frontage for commercial uses.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Conservancy, which has been working to get the
school district to renovate the hotel as part of a new school
development, said the compromise language was acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps the language could have been stronger, but we are pleased
the council is interested in having the school district consider
reusing the hotel as a school," said Ken Bernstein, director of
preservation issues for the conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   The conservancy, which contends that the buildings are
architecturally significant and of historic importance, does not want
the hotel torn down.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel hosted six Academy Awards, was visited by every
president from Herbert Hoover to Richard Nixon and was the site of
Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 assassination.</TE>
<TE>   School officials lobbied the council not to take a position that
would force the district to commit to one option now.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that it is too early to choose--or foreclose--any
particular use of the Ambassador Hotel site beyond the need to build
schools," Glenn Gritzner, a school district official, said in a
letter to the council Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   He said more analysis and community comment will be considered
before a decision is made.</TE>

<HD>Council Takes Up City Hall Elevator Woes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Council members complained Tuesday that after
spending $300 million to renovate City Hall, only two of the eight
elevators are working, forcing city officials to waste time waiting
for packed cars.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Dennis Zine noted that the council had to authorize a
new roof for City Hall after the renovation project, and demanded a
report on why the elevators were not fixed during the work.</LD>
<LD>   "Where did we spend $300 million and who is accountable for that?"
Zine asked, saying he was frustrated to have to take the stairs from
the parking basement Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The budget for City Hall included a seismic retrofit, upgrading of
the fire safety systems and historic restoration, but somehow did not
include money to fix the circa-1926 elevator system, said Tony
DeClue, head of the city General Services Department.</TE>
<TE>   The council agreed to consider proposals to spend $1.6 million to
$6 million to repair or replace the mechanical works in the
elevators.</TE>
<TE>   David Paschal, who oversees the elevator system, recommended the
$1.6-million repair option, saying, "It will allow us to get years
and years out of the elevators and it will make them reliable."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Janice Hahn called it a public safety emergency. "I
feel it [the lack of operating elevators] is unconscionable," she
said, "to have a building of this size with the number of people we
have visiting."</TE>

<HD>A Different Kind of Dog Dropping Has Owner Barking to Cops</HD>

<LD>The crime blotter of the L.A. Independent carried a complaint from a
woman whose large dog "stays out on the balcony of her apartment when
she is not home. The dog has pillows and blankets out there, which it
occasionally throws over the balcony."</LD>
<LD>   The dog owner claims that when the items land below, her
downstairs neighbor "throws them in the trash."</LD>
<LD>   I don't suppose it would help to teach the mutt to fetch.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Food for thought: When Joel Davis spotted a store sign in Atwater
Village, he concluded: "They must use a special kind of 'flower' in
their pastries" (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of unusual combinations: Joyce Thorne of San Diego
spotted a place where you could evidently get your teeth cleaned
without leaving your car (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Thorne believes the ad was supposed to say "car wash and detail
center."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Turning to crime: As she filled out a mail order form for some
magazines, Gail Fisher of Whittier realized she didn't have the
prison currency necessary--though she added: "I do have a personal
check" (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A landlord who lays down the law: Gloria West of Calabasas noticed
a rental in a drug-free house (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Presidents in training: When Pasadena teacher Valerie Anne
Williams assigned her third-graders an essay titled "If I Were
President for a Day," the kids at San Rafael Elementary School came
up with some interesting parallels to the real-life occupants of the
White House.</TE>
<TE>   Eliud Celis, for instance, would have a dining routine reminiscent
of ex-President Clinton's. When he becomes president, he said, "I
will go to McDonald's with my wife and get a Big Mac." (OK, the
parallel isn't perfect--I don't recall Hillary Rodham Clinton
accompanying her hubbie to the golden arches.)</TE>
<TE>   Salvador Vega brought back memories of Warren G. Harding's
favorite sport: "In the evening I will go home and invite my friends
for dinner and after dinner we will play poker with cards and poker
chips."</TE>
<TE>   But none of the students spoke of eating pretzels as president,
obviously having learned from George W.'s problem with the twisty
things. Martha Monroy did say, however, she would "go to the movies
and eat a lot of popcorn."</TE>
<TE>   As far as letting off steam is concerned, Latasha Jones didn't
mention golf or jogging. She said that at the end of her work day in
the Oval Office, "I will go outside and howl." I guess working with

<HD>Teen Collapses, Dies at School</HD>
<DH>Mystery: The cause of death for Ricardo Martinez, 15, of
Van Nuys High remains unknown. An autopsy is planned. He had a
6-month-old son.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF and DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 15-year-old Van Nuys High School student who was the father of a
6-month-old baby collapsed and died Tuesday in front of fellow
students as he was changing into his gym uniform, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Ricardo Martinez fell off a locker room bench shortly before the
gym class, which was to begin at 7:40 a.m., said Bob Collins, a
superintendent for the southwest Valley area of the Los Angeles
Unified School District.</LD>
<LD>   "He just fell on the floor and started shaking a little,"
10th-grader Kenny Luweloyn said. "His eyes were open."</LD>
<TE>   A teacher and a school nurse tried to revive the ninth-grader with
cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</TE>
<TE>   He was taken to Valley Presbyterian Hospital, where he was
pronounced dead at 9:05 a.m., Collins said.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Humphrey of the Los Angeles Fire Department said Martinez
was not breathing and did not have a pulse when paramedics arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "As of now, there are no indications of foul play," Los Angeles
Police Det. Al Aldaz said.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy will be conducted later this week, but a cause of death
may not be determined for weeks, said Scott Carrier, a spokesman for
the Los Angeles County coroner's office.</TE>
<TE>   At 11 a.m., Van Nuys High Principal Herman Clay told teachers to
inform students that Martinez had died. A crisis team was called in
to counsel students, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Family members gathered outside the parents' Van Nuys apartment,
holding each other and fighting off tears, said they were puzzled by
his death.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Martinez said her brother "had no health problems. He wasn't
in a gang. He wasn't using drugs."</TE>
<TE>   Ricardo Martinez had boxed for four years with an LAPD-sponsored
after-school program for at-risk youth, but quit six months ago when
his son, Ricardo Sebastian Martinez, was born.</TE>
<TE>   He applied to rejoin the program Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   One of six siblings, Martinez worked weekends for a construction
company run by his girlfriend's father, using his income to support
his baby and his girlfriend, Joanna Limas, 15.</TE>
<TE>   "Last night, he was singing to our son in the bathroom," Limas
said. "We read a book together to him before going to bed. This
morning he kissed me and my baby to say he was going to school. I
don't know what to do now that I'm alone with my baby."</TE>
<TE>   Maria Martinez said her brother bought Limas a ring last February
and the couple expected to marry.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the burdens of school, work and family, his sister said he
was happy.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Maria Ventura, said she saw her son less after the
baby's birth. When he came home, he would grab a spot on the couch or
floor to sleep.</TE>
<TE>   "He never did anything else" besides spend time with his
girlfriend and their baby, Ventura said. "He never went out."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Andrea Perera and Jennifer Sinco Kelleher
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Orchestra's Playing Is Just a Little Too Spirited</HD>
<DH>Aviation: United kicks St. Petersburg Philharmonic off
flight to Los Angeles after members fail to heed crew's orders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN GILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was the kind of bawdy behavior normally associated with rock 'n'
roll bands: allegations of rowdy musicians drinking in public,
throwing things around and refusing to keep the noise down.</LD>
<LD>   But the band that got kicked off an Amsterdam-to-Los Angeles
flight was neither a thrash-and-burn heavy metal group nor a raucous
rap band.</LD>
<LD>   It was the St. Petersburg Philharmonic, Russia's oldest symphony
orchestra.</LD>
<TE>   About 90 of the orchestra's members were removed from the aircraft
Monday during a scheduled layover at Washington's Dulles
International Airport, United Airlines officials said. The orchestra
was on its way to Los Angeles for a scheduled concert tonight at the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, launching a monthlong American tour,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the unexpected stopover, tonight's show will go on,
according to a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Philharmonic.</TE>
<TE>   St. Petersburg orchestra members, who continued to Los Angeles on
a later flight, were still traveling Tuesday and could not be reached
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Their scheduled program tonight will include the works of
Prokofiev, Stravinsky and Shostakovich.</TE>
<TE>   But that performance may not be nearly as memorable as the one
that United flight crew members and passengers said the orchestra
gave during the Amsterdam-to-Dulles leg of their trip.</TE>
<TE>   While on Flight 947, United officials said, many members of the
group drank liquor from bottles they had brought on board, talked
loudly and disturbed other passengers, and refused to sit or follow
the crew's safety commands.</TE>
<TE>   The cacophony prompted United officials to bring down the curtain
on the orchestra's second act. The musicians were removed from the
plane, and the flight continued to Los Angeles without them.</TE>
<TE>   Members spent the night in the Washington area at their own
expense. It was not clear whether Yuri Temirkanov, the Philharmonic's
conductor, was among them.</TE>
<TE>   Booked on another United flight Tuesday, the orchestra members
apparently had learned the limits of creative expression in the
strict world of airline travel.</TE>
<TE>   They showed up in "much different spirits," said Susana Leyva, a
spokeswoman for United.</TE>
<TE>   She said the group met with an airline representative before
boarding.</TE>
<TE>   "We outlined a conduct agreement that, while in flight, our crew
is in charge," she said. "Our representative was very confident that
they would observe all safety rules on board the flight today."</TE>
<TE>   Citing airline policy, Leyva would not say which flight the
musicians were on or what time they were due to arrive.</TE>
<TE>   She said United did not pay for their unexpected stay in
Washington because, like all other carriers, the airline only puts up
passengers overnight as a result of a mechanical or weather delay.</TE>
<TE>   For many years known as the Leningrad Philharmonic, the St.
Petersburg group is the oldest symphony orchestra in Russia, dating
to 1882, when it performed for the aristocracy.</TE>
<TE>   It frequently makes trips to Europe and was last in the United
States in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Hinckley, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, confirmed that the group would perform as scheduled
tonight at 8.</TE>
<TE>   She did not, as of yet, have a contact for comment from the group.</TE>
<TE>   Like United, she seemed ready to forgive and forget whatever
behavior may have prompted the delay.</TE>
<TE>   "They're on their way," Hinckley said Tuesday afternoon. "So
everything is fine."</TE>

<LD>Because of their sturdy texture and meaty flavor, portabello
mushrooms lend themselves to breading and frying. Or you can try
roasting them, which saves fat and calories.</LD>
<LD>   Make sure the mushrooms brown evenly by arranging them in a single
layer in a large baking pan and lightly spraying them with cooking
spray. The mushrooms are best served hot--toss them at once with the
Parmesan so it melts a little.</LD>
<LD>   The light red sauce, served on the side, also keeps this dish's
fat and calories low.</LD>
<TE>   Roasted Portabello Mushrooms With Red Sauce</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes
* Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick olive oil cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 teaspoons dried oregano leaves, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   6 portabello mushrooms, about</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 inches in diameter</TE>
<TE>   1 cup plain Italian bread crumbs</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup nonfat egg substitute</TE>
<TE>   Spray a nonstick skillet with the cooking spray; heat over
medium-low heat. Cook the garlic just until tender and beginning to
brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the tomato sauce, 1/4 teaspoon of the
oregano and the lemon juice. Heat to a simmer. Reheat just before
serving the mushrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, heat the oven to 450 degrees. Spray 2 (15x10-inch)
jelly roll pans with cooking spray and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the mushrooms into 3/8-inch slices.</TE>
<TE>   Stir together the bread crumbs, the remaining 1 teaspoon of
oregano, 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan cheese and the salt in a
shallow glass dish. Pour the egg substitute into a second glass dish.</TE>
<TE>   Add the sliced mushrooms, a few at a time, to the egg substitute
and stir to coat. Add the mushrooms to the bread crumb mixture,
turning to coat all sides.</TE>
<TE>   Place the breaded mushrooms on the pans and lightly spray them
with the cooking spray. Roast the mushrooms 10 minutes and turn.
Continue to roast until the mushrooms are lightly browned, another 5
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the mushrooms from the baking pans to a large bowl.
Sprinkle them with the remaining Parmesan cheese and toss. Taste and
add more salt if need be. Serve with the reserved red sauce.</TE>

<LD>Chicken Cacciatore, or Hunter's Chicken, is traditionally made with
bone-in chicken stewed for an hour or more. It's worth the wait if
you have the time, but who does on a weeknight?</LD>
<LD>   This version uses pieces of boneless chicken thighs to reduce
cooking time without sacrificing flavor.</LD>
<LD>   White button mushrooms work well, but you can also try brown
Italian, porcini or shiitake mushrooms. Cook a 12-ounce bag of egg
noodles, toss the noodles with 2 tablespoons of butter and serve
alongside the chicken.</LD>

<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>The Guide Michelin, France's foremost restaurant guidebook, unveiled
its annual list of ratings two weeks ahead of schedule last week to
squelch panic among top chefs and food critics. It was the first time
the prestigious guide with the red cover has jumped the gun on its
official March 1 release date.</LD>
<LD>   "We wanted to cut short the rumors," said spokesman Jean-Frederic
Douroux at Michelin's travel publishing arm.</LD>
<LD>   The talk was apparently spooked by rumored wholesale changes
instigated by the guide's new editor, Derek Brown, a Michelin veteran
of more than 30 years, who comes from England. Brown took his post
last year but had yet to oversee a full edition.</LD>
<TE>   In the new guide, Michelin raised three restaurants from two stars
to the maximum rating of three, bringing the total number of the
gastronomically faultless to 23. The guide rewarded Paris chefs
Christian Le Squer at Ledoyen and Guy Savoy, whose restaurant of the
same name stands near the Arc de Triomphe, as well as Jean-Georges
Klein for his skill at the helm of L'Arnsbourg in rural northeastern
France.</TE>
<TE>   Emile Jung saw his three-star Le Crocodile in Strasbourg slip to
two-star status.</TE>
<TE>   Douroux declined to expand on the speculation regarding the guide,
but media reports said the gastronomic rumor mill had been churning
overtime due to Brown's arrival at the helm of the culinary Bible.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation about who is in or out grips the rarefied world of
French haute cuisine every year for as much as three months before
the release of the guide, which can make or break reputations by
awarding or withdrawing a single little star in its chart.</TE>
<TE>   With such high stakes, rumors and leaks alike are eagerly
anticipated. "This time it was worse because, with the change of
boss, the anxiety was amplified by a sense of the unknown," said Jean
Miot, gastronomic critic at the French daily Le Figaro. "It was even
more intense because he is British."</TE>

<HD>Ex-LAPD Officer Acquitted in Felony Civil Rights Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Douglas Beard was accused of lying about why he
pulled over a suspect in 1995.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Los Angeles police officer was acquitted by a federal jury
Tuesday of charges that he lied about why he stopped a motorist, who
turned out to be an armed ex-felon.</LD>
<LD>   Douglas Beard, 31, was accused of falsely testifying that he saw
the motorist run a stop sign that did not exist.</LD>
<LD>   He was indicted on charges of conspiring to violate civil rights
law, a felony, and depriving a citizen of his rights under color of
authority, a misdemeanor.</LD>
<TE>   If convicted, he could have faced up to 11 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very gratified about the jury's decision," defense lawyer
Ira Salzman said at the end of the weeklong trial in Los Angeles
federal court.</TE>
<TE>   Beard, who was dismissed from the force over the incident, will
now seek reinstatement.</TE>
<TE>   "Doug is looking forward to getting back to doing the work he
loves most," Salzman said. Beard has worked as a bottled water
delivery man since leaving the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   The disputed stop occurred on June 20, 1995, when Beard and his
77th Street Division training officer, Edward P. Ruiz, 36, pulled
over a car driven by Thyjuan Taplin in South-Central Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   After being ordered out of his car, Taplin ran away, tossing a gun
as he fled. He was captured a short time later and booked for being a
felon in possession of a gun.</TE>
<TE>   Taplin's lawyer argued during a preliminary hearing before a state
court judge that his client could not have been pulled over for
running a stop sign because there was no such sign there.</TE>
<TE>   When the judge refused to dismiss the charge, Taplin negotiated a
deal and was sentenced to 16 months in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Salzman said Ruiz first remarked that Taplin had run the stop
sign, and Beard believed him.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, who is no longer on the police force, is serving a 10-month
sentence in a halfway house after pleading guilty to falsely
arresting another man on a weapons charge.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors had planned to call Ruiz to dispute Beard's
story but were barred from doing so before the trial got underway.</TE>
<TE>   A prosecution spokesman said U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian
ruled that Ruiz could not testify because he had been exposed to
Beard's testimony before LAPD Internal Affairs investigators, which
is not admissible in court.</TE>

<HD>Deputies Kill Driver After Palmdale Chase</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies shot and killed a man after he
led them on a 10-minute car chase in Palmdale, authorities said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Raimin Isayo, 28, was stopped by a deputy about 11 p.m. Monday for
a broken taillight near Palmdale Boulevard and 15th Street East, said
Deputy David Cervantes, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department.
When the deputy noticed the car's ignition had been altered and
questioned the driver on the vehicle's ownership, Isayo drove off,
Cervantes said.</LD>
<LD>   Deputies chased Isayo to his estranged wife's parents' house in
Littlerock. There, his brother and wife approached the car, ignoring
warnings from deputies to move aside, Cervantes said.</LD>
<TE>   Deputies fired one round from a beanbag shotgun, hitting the
woman. Isayo soon after pointed the gun at his brother, wife and
deputies, Cervantes said. Authorities said deputies then fired,
striking Isayo in the upper body. .Isayo died at the scene, Cervantes
said. No deputies were hurt.</TE>

<HD>Coalition Seeks Ways to Speed I-10 Freight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Transportation officials from eight states have begun a joint effort
to speed the movement of freight along Interstate 10, the nearly
2,500-mile-long freeway that stretches from Jacksonville, Fla., to
Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   With domestic freight traffic expected to grow by 85% through
2020, the coalition said, it's imperative that a plan be developed to
improve conditions on I-10 and that alternative modes of
transportation be studied.</LD>
<LD>   "Right now there are a lot of trucks, and we don't know how to get
them off the highways," said Arno Hart, project manager for the
National I-10 Freight Corridor Study.</LD>
<TE>   Other problems with the major freight corridor include traffic
congestion, truck safety and air quality, said Rose Casey, a deputy
district director of planning for the California Department of
Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the I-10 study group have discussed reducing the
crowding by shifting more freight to trains, creating truck-only
lanes or even developing a separate highway system for trucks to keep
them off urban stretches of the roadway.</TE>
<TE>   The timeline calls for the study to be completed by 2003, in time
to lobby for any major changes to be included in Congress' next
transportation appropriations bill.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an issue that really should be given national priority,"
said Robert Calix, a transportation planning manager with the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Half of I-10 cargo that
originates in Southern California eventually ends up on the East
Coast, he said. "A lot of the burden borne is for the sake of the
rest of the country," he added. "We're trying to position ourselves
as a national issue."</TE>
<TE>   One voice, he said, will be more effective in promoting
improvements.</TE>

<HD>Man Claims Share of Record Lotto Jackpot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of three winners in last week's record-setting $193-million
California lottery came forward Tuesday to claim his share of the
largest single-state jackpot in U.S. history.</LD>
<LD>   Andy Kampe, a self-employed engineer who bought his ticket at a
Northern California supermarket, said he planned to quit his job and
buy a "pretty hot car" with part of his $64.3 million in winnings.</LD>
<LD>   The other two winners, who purchased tickets in Orange and
Montebello, had yet to come forward as of Tuesday night.</LD>
<TE>   Kampe, 57, owner of Kampe Construction in Half Moon Bay, overcame
the one-in-41-million odds by picking all six numbers in Saturday's
SuperLotto Plus drawing.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference in San Francisco, he received an oversized
check for the $64.3 million he will get before taxes over the next 26
years. Kampe elected to take the money in annual payments, with the
first check, for $1.6 million, expected to arrive in two to six
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   He had purchased 20 Quick Pick tickets at an Albertson's
supermarket in Half Moon Bay for Saturday's drawing.</TE>
<TE>   Kampe said Tuesday that he and his family--his wife, Diane, quit
her job as a nurse at Coastside Medical Clinic--may "go hide" for
about a month to figure out what to do with the money. He has two
daughters, Amanda Valerino, 27, who lives in Nevada, and Ana Kampe,
26, who lives in Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Kampe said he is planning to fire himself from his job, travel and
possibly make some big purchases. "I'll probably get myself a pretty
hot car," he said. "I've got a truck now."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Margie Bennett, the franchise owner of the Montebello
7-Eleven store where one of the winning tickets was sold, said she
only hopes that one of the winners is a regular customer.</TE>
<TE>   For selling the winning ticket, she gets to split $321,666, or one
half of 1% of the jackpot, with 7-Eleven Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said the days leading up to Saturday's drawing were hectic
for her and her employees. As a reward for their hard work, she said,
"I'll give a little bit to some of my employees, help them with
schools. Otherwise, I have no idea."</TE>
<TE>   In Orange, the manager of the 7-Eleven store where the third
winning ticket was sold said he returned from a trip to Las Vegas to
learn he had won a tidy sum without having gambled a dime.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Bisla, 61, of Orange said he hasn't decided how he will
spend his share of the $321,666 he must split with 7-Eleven Corp.</TE>

<HD>Cheney Hits Right Notes for Nixon Library Audience</HD>
<DH>Politics: The vice president and his wife receive an
Architect of Peace award during visit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Call it the Back to Business Tour.</LD>
<LD>   As part of Vice President Dick Cheney's return this week to the
more traditional role of partisan cheerleader and fund-raiser, he
stopped in Yorba Linda on Tuesday to raise money for the Richard
Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace.</LD>
<LD>   There--where he and his wife, Lynne, were honored for promoting
peace--Cheney was welcomed enthusiastically by Orange County
Republicans, who haven't celebrated a friendly administration
official gracing the red carpet in nearly a decade.</LD>
<TE>   "The United States today is safer than any other country," Cheney
said during a question-and-answer session that followed his remarks
on the country's resolve to root out terrorism with the help of a
reinvigorated military.</TE>
<TE>   "We are passing through a dangerous period for us and for the
civilized world," he said. "As in the great conflicts of the century
just passed, the United States must accept the place of leadership
given to us by history."</TE>
<TE>   If there was scant solace in some of his remarks--"Even if we're
99% successful in defending against another [terrorist] attack, that
1% can kill you"--there was at least the sense of sacrifice for a
noble cause.</TE>
<TE>   The audience of 175 people, who paid $2,500 each to attend, leaped
to their feet several times with appreciative applause.</TE>
<TE>   "He's so reassuring," said Lois Lundberg, chairwoman emeritus of
the Orange County Republican Party. "We are absolutely where we ought
to be."</TE>
<TE>   "This is as good as it gets," GOP activist Doy Henley said. "We've
got the right guy, and we're back."</TE>
<TE>   The library visit, during which the couple received the Architect
of Peace award, was part of a four-day tour of Western states by the
vice president. He has been largely absent from public venues since
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and has recently been buffeted by
criticism of his secrecy about dealings with Enron executives.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Cheney delivered his peace-through-strength message to
an audience of Marines and their families at the Miramar air station
in San Diego County, home to nine Marines lost in the military
campaign in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   At the library luncheon, Cheney and his wife were presented with a
Tiffany crystal star by Julie Nixon Eisenhower after dining on
lobster salad, seared sea bass and miniature white- and
dark-chocolate replicas of the Capitol and White House filled with
berries and flavored cream.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney praised President Bush, who he said will "not for a moment
be deterred or distracted in the defense of this nation, our allies
and our freedom." He said the administration's war on terrorism is
using the help of several countries, "many of whom would not have
qualified as friends of the U.S. in the past." One of the new
friends, Cheney said later, is China, which Bush will visit on his
current trip overseas. "They've given us every indication they want
to be allies in fighting against terrorism," he said. "We have no
criticism to offer in terms of the way they've cooperated."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney also praised Mexico and Canada for tightening their borders
to help keep terrorists from slipping into the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   But he rejected the idea that closed military bases could be
reopened as part of the armed-forces buildup. He said the military
shouldn't be wasting money on bases that it doesn't need and should
focus instead on manpower and new-technology munitions.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney left Yorba Linda for Century City to prepare for an
appearance on "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" and then take the
stage for a $1-million fund-raising dinner for members of the state
GOP's newly formed "Team Cal"--a group of donors who have each
pledged to raise $25,000 for the party.</TE>
<TE>   Later this week, Cheney will deliver speeches in Fresno and
Silicon Valley, with fund-raisers for Republican Reps. Richard W.
Pombo and John T. Doolittle. Also scheduled: a visit to the Winter
Olympics in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, meanwhile, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) joined a
chorus of calls for Cheney to release the records of his closed-door
energy task force, including his discussions with officials of the
disgraced Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has refused to turn over records of its
meetings with Enron executives and others who advised Cheney's panel
last year, provoking a legal fight that Congress is expected to join.</TE>
<TE>   "The American people deserve to know," McCain told a town-hall
audience about the deliberations that shaped the administration's
national energy policy.</TE>

<HD>25 to Life for Strip Club Owner Who Ordered Partner's Death</HD>
<DH>Courts: The judge shows leniency to keep the sentence in
line with the hit man's, who confessed and worked with prosecutors on
the case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County judge Tuesday sentenced a former California Highway
Patrol officer to 25 years to life in prison for ordering the murder
of his business partner in 1989, a crime solved more than a decade
later when the hit man confessed.</LD>
<LD>   A jury convicted Michael Woods of first-degree murder last year
for paying $50,000 to have his partner in a string of Los Angeles
County strip clubs killed.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Kazuharu Makino declined to give Woods the
maximum sentence, life in prison without parole, saying he thought it
was out of line with the 20-year sentence the confessed hit man
received.</LD>
<TE>   The investigation into the slaying of Horace "Big Mac" McKenna, a
bodybuilder and former CHP officer, stalled for more than a decade
until the triggerman confessed and agreed to work undercover for
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   After a 10-month investigation, detectives arrested Woods, his new
business partner, David Amos, and detailed the duo's alleged
arrangement with John Sheridan, the gunman. Both Amos and Sheridan
received 20-year sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Makino said he reduced Woods' sentence to bring a sense of
equity to the case. Sheridan, who admitted using an Uzi machine gun
to kill McKenna, might have received the death penalty if not for the
agreement with prosecutors, the judge noted.</TE>
<TE>   'Who Do You Give</TE>
<TE>   the Break to?'</TE>
<TE>   Woods' lawyers were highly critical of the investigators'
arrangement with Sheridan, who was allowed to remain out of custody
for nearly a year while helping build a case against Woods and Amos.
They contended during the trial that Amos and Sheridan lied about
Woods' involvement to get leniency.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the old case of who do you give the break to? It's my
opinion they gave it to the worst person, a sociopath killer who I
believe would not hesitate to kill again," said Woods' attorney,
Richard Hirsch.</TE>
<TE>   With credit for good behavior, Woods, 59, will be eligible to
apply for parole in about 12 years. Amos and Sheridan are eligible
for parole in less than 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Bruce Moore said he was satisfied with the
sentence, but declined further comment.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, Moore argued that Woods wanted McKenna dead so
he could gain control of the strip clubs both men operated. Woods and
McKenna met while assigned to the Highway Patrol's West Los Angeles
division in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Amos testified at the trial that Woods paid him $50,000 to arrange
McKenna's murder. Amos said he paid Sheridan $25,000 to commit the
killing.</TE>
<TE>   After McKenna's death, Amos became 40% owner of Woods' strip
clubs.</TE>

<HD>Trial Ordered for Teens in Slaying of Transient</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Ventura County teenagers were ordered Tuesday to stand trial on
murder and robbery charges in connection with the fatal beating of a
homeless man last summer.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Coffman, 19, and Timothy Becker, 18, are among four teens
accused of kicking and throwing rocks at 58-year-old James Clark as
he lay in a sleeping bag near the mouth of the Ventura River on June
30.</LD>
<LD>   During a preliminary hearing, Ventura Police Det. Pat Stevens
testified that during separate police interviews, Coffman and Becker
admitted participating in the assault.</LD>
<TE>   The teens told police they stumbled on a "bum" while heading to a
beach party with Rocky Mattley, 14, and Christopher Dunham, 19. The
group took the man's radio and backpack, which held a container of
pennies, Stevens said.</TE>
<TE>   Becker and Coffman told police the teens later went back, pelted
Clark with the coins and began kicking him in the face, arms and
chest.</TE>
<TE>   Becker told Stevens that later that night Dunham and Mattley said
they were "going to go back and mess with the bum some more," he
testified.</TE>
<TE>   "When they came back, they told Tim Becker that they hit Mr. Clark
with some rocks," Stevens testified.</TE>
<TE>   Dunham and Mattley are also facing murder charges. Dunham waived
Tuesday's preliminary hearing and will proceed to trial. Mattley is
being prosecuted in Juvenile Court.</TE>
<TE>   The four teens were arrested last summer within two weeks of the
attack on Clark and have given conflicting statements to police about
who struck which blows.</TE>
<TE>   In arguing the case Tuesday, Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Maeve Fox
told Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ronald Purnell that
prosecutors believe all four teens are liable for murder because they
participated in the attack together.</TE>

<HD>Prosecutors Say Pair Responsible for Fatal Blast</HD>
<DH>Rocketdyne: Jury is urged to convict the ex-workers.
Defense to give closing arguments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal prosecutor asked a jury Tuesday to hold two former
Rocketdyne employees responsible for illegally burning hazardous
waste that resulted in a deadly 1994 blast at the Santa Susana Field
Laboratory near Chatsworth.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant U.S. Atty. William Carter argued that both men knew
excess chemical materials were being burned for disposal, an
essential element in the prosecution of federal environmental laws.</LD>
<LD>   "They are responsible for their conduct," Carter told jurors in
his four-hour closing argument.</LD>
<TE>   Joseph E. Flanagan, 61, of Stanwood, Wash., and Edgar R. Wilson,
65, of Chatsworth are on trial in Riverside. The pair are accused of
illegally burning chemical waste at the field laboratory on July 21
and July 26, 1994. Both testified they were conducting what they
believed were legitimate experiments.</TE>
<TE>   The men face up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on
each felony count.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys John D. Vandevelde and Leonard Sharenow are
expected to give their closing arguments in the four-month trial
today.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is being held in Riverside because the case, filed in
Los Angeles, was randomly assigned to Judge Robert J. Timlin of the
U.S. District Court's Central District.</TE>
<TE>   The July 26, 1994, explosion instantly killed chemical engineer
Otto K. Heiney, 53, of Canoga Park, and physicist Larry A. Pugh, 51,
of Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   The case arises from the deaths of the two scientists, and alleged
violations of the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.</TE>
<TE>   The blast occurred as Heiney, Pugh, Wilson, James F. Weber, the
group's hazardous waste coordinator, and mechanic Lee Wells were
burning materials in what the defense contends were legitimate
scientific tests.</TE>
<TE>   The men covered large metal trays in sawdust, then poured excess
chemical mixtures on top and ignited it.</TE>
<TE>   On July 21, 1994, the procedure resulted in a brush fire.</TE>
<TE>   Five days later, after the first two burns were completed, the
chemicals unexpectedly ignited, causing the deadly explosion.</TE>
<TE>   "No one in this case testified that they had ever seen anything
like this" except at an older burn pit, Carter said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor argued that the procedures were unlike any other
tests conducted at the lab, now owned by Chicago-based Boeing Co.
Carter said the procedure was identical to that used to legally
dispose of chemical waste at the company's burn pit before its permit
expired.</TE>
<TE>   None of the men measured the chemicals, took notes or collected
data, Carter said. "These were essentially barbecues."</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan, then the director of Rocketdyne's Chemical Technology
Group, was not present at the lab but supervised the group.</TE>
<TE>   He and Wilson have defended their actions, saying they believed
Heiney and Pugh were conducting legitimate scientific experiments.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Flanagan testified he did not direct or approve any
"phony testing" or illegal storage of hazardous materials.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan said he authorized Heiney to conduct the tests.</TE>
<TE>   After the explosion, Flanagan told internal investigators that a
side benefit of Heiney's testing was the spending of unnecessary
chemicals, Carter said.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, a lab technician, told jurors earlier this month the tests
appeared "unusual" to him.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said he had asked Weber, who was his supervisor, about them
and was told Heiney was in charge.</TE>
<TE>   Weber, 51, of Moorpark was indicted in 1999 with Flanagan and
Wilson but pleaded guilty in August to a misdemeanor count of
illegally storing explosive materials. Weber was expected to testify
for the prosecution but did not do so.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is an avalanche of evidence ... [that] this was not
a test," Carter said. "It was an effort to get rid of these
materials."</TE>
<TE>   Carter urged jurors to consider prior acts by Flanagan and Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Flanagan and his group were under considerable corporate pressure
to clean up their area by getting rid of excess materials, Carter
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the materials, he said, could not be legally stored,
shipped or burned without a permit.</TE>

<LD>Quick, now--which section of the paper are these quotes from?</LD>
<LD>   "The real deal ... attuned to character ... defying everyone's
expectations."</LD>
<LD>   Observations about the three top GOP guys running for governor?
Wrong. Good, but wrong.</LD>
<TE>   They're from ads for Oscar-nominated movies, which got me to
thinking of these two big campaigns being waged simultaneously--for
governor, and for the Academy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   We talk about them both as "races." February would be a far more
engaging month if the people running for governor campaigned as if
they were angling for an Oscar, and the other way around.</TE>
<TE>   This is the 74th time around for the Oscars, but only the third
March primary for California, so the Oscars have a big jump in the
spring offensive.</TE>
<TE>   They wage their trench warfare in newspaper and TV ads, and they
can mix it up.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Gen. Miramax fixed bayonets and spent $15 million
charging over the top on behalf of "Shakespeare in Love." The
DreamWorks axis defending "Saving Private Ryan" was overrun, just
like the PR budget.</TE>
<TE>   See? These guys are made for politics.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians hang around factory gates and lunch counters;
best-acting nominees could do some shoe-leather campaigning:</TE>
<TE>   Sissy Spacek works the dining room at Eurochow, beats a path
between the two Starbuckses on Montana Avenue, loiters at Barneys,
glad-handing the movie people trying on four different jackets, all
black.</TE>
<TE>   Will Smith hires a lush campaign bus for a "victory tour" of
voter-rich academy haunts from Studio City to Santa Monica, Brentwood
to Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Renee Zellweger, who put on 20 pounds to play Bridget Jones, ups
her numbers by courting the zaftig vote and the bulimic vote in the
ladies' rooms of any restaurant in 90210.</TE>
<TE>   Ian McKellen takes his plummy vowels to Venice: How d'you do. Ian
McKellen--I'd be so grateful for your vote for best supporting
actor--yes, indeed, as Gandalf. Oh, from Iowa? Just visiting, are
you? Well, well ... it seems all Americans do sound alike."</TE>
<TE>   To parallel the GOP primary, we'd have a televised directors'
debate among Ridley Scott (he got nominated, but "Black Hawk Down"
didn't), David Lynch (ditto on "Mulholland Drive") and Baz Luhrmann
("Moulin Rouge" got nominated but he did not).</TE>
<TE>   They could make nice and promise to break bread the morning after,
whoever won.</TE>
<TE>   Or they could go negative: One of my opponents reputedly flunked
out of Young Filmmaker Camp in sixth grade.... One of my opponents
has walked into this competition without ever having paid his dues,
never serving as second assistant assistant second-unit director,
never having so much as changed the oil on an editing machine.</TE>
<TE>   The Sunday talk show lip-flappers would size up the Oscar race on
their terms:</TE>
<TE>   Robert Novak on "A Beautiful Mind": Russell Crowe as a hush-hush
math whiz? Another typically failed federal program! And since when
do we need foreigners in top-secret jobs?</TE>
<TE>   James Carville on "Gosford Park": Knock this 'Upstairs-Downstairs'
world upside the head! This is what we fought a revolution foah!</TE>
<TE>   Bill O'Reilly on "Lord of the Rings": More politically correct
dreck--Orwellian special effects to make tall actors short! What
next, mandatory booster seats on every barstool and toadstool in
Middle-earth?</TE>
<TE>   Two multimillionaires, Dick Riordan and Bill Simon, and a
politician-farmer, Bill Jones, are running in the GOP primary. In the
academy's universe, the Jimmy Stewart-just-folks guy always outfoxes
the rich guys. In politics--dream on.</TE>
<TE>   If a casting agent were handling the trio, they might wind up
thusly:</TE>
<TE>   Jones: the loyal best friend, the one who doesn't get the girl, a
role often filled by ... Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan: the funny guy, the one the girls surprise everyone by
falling for.</TE>
<TE>   Simon: the nerdish guy who thinks he might be Clark Kent but can't
persuade anybody else of it.</TE>
<TE>   Ebert and Roeper would weigh in:</TE>
<TE>   Jones: A farmer? Two green thumbs!</TE>
<TE>   Riordan: All thumbs!</TE>
<TE>   Simon: So rich he doesn't need to thumb!</TE>
<TE>   There's one thing the Oscars have that California politics could
do well to imitate. You can bet the back lot that voter turnout among
the 5,739 voters of the academy is something higher than a wretched
50%.</TE>

<HD>Ahmanson Gets Green Thumbs Up in Report</HD>
<DH>Housing: Environmental study says construction won't
destroy rare species. Opponents dispute the findings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX and MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Building a suburb of 3,050 homes would substantially affect the rare
frogs and flowers dotting the hills of Ahmanson Ranch, but with minor
safeguards such problems could be reduced to acceptable levels, said
an environmental study released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The report will be dissected in a series of public hearings,
culminating with a vote, likely this fall, by the Ventura County
Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   But even before county officials distributed copies, opponents
declared that the supplemental study fell short, possibly setting the
stage for yet another lawsuit over the much-litigated project at the
county's eastern edge, near Calabasas.</LD>
<TE>   A chief objection is that the study, conducted by an independent
consulting firm, did not reexamine the effects of increased traffic,
a major concern of west San Fernando Valley residents.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't do anything of significance," said Mary Wiesbrock,
director of the opposition group Save Open Space. "They didn't do a
new traffic study. They're not dealing with the impacts on Las
Virgenes Creek. And they're [making] the absurd statement that the
spineflower and the frog are going to survive this huge urban
assault."</TE>
<TE>   Ahmanson spokesman Tim McGarry said the developer, while still
sorting through the report's details, was "certainly pleased" with
its findings.</TE>
<TE>   "It erases a question mark that's been attached to the Ahmanson
Ranch project since the frog and flower were discovered" three years
ago, McGarry said. "We've said for some time that we could protect
the species and build the project. And that has now been confirmed by
an independent evaluation."</TE>
<TE>   The environmental report found that even with some recommended
modifications, the project would destroy nearly 7% of the San
Fernando Valley spineflower plants found at the ranch. Construction
and traffic could also indirectly cause the loss of some California
red-legged frogs or their habitat, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County officials approved the Ahmanson Ranch project in
1992. The planned suburb, a 2,800-acre residential, retail and office
development northwest of Calabasas, has won awards for its innovative
design and withstood more than a dozen lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   But the project hit a bump in 1999 when biologists commissioned by
the developer, Washington Mutual Bank, found two unexpected species
at the site: the San Fernando Valley spineflower, long assumed to be
extinct, and the California red-legged frog. The discoveries prompted
Ventura County to commission a supplemental environmental impact
report, required under state law when significant new information
emerges.</TE>
<TE>   Among the safeguards the new study recommends for the spineflower
are fenced-off preserves, an annual population census and weed
abatement. California considers the flower an endangered species, but
it has not won federal protection.</TE>
<TE>   For the frog, a threatened species under the federal Endangered
Species Act, the report proposes a 300-foot buffer zone around pools
where the animals live, curbs suitable for frog-hopping, limits on
pesticide use, and a biologist to check open trenches to make sure
frogs aren't trapped during construction.</TE>
<TE>   "At first glance, [the proposed mitigation] appears to be window
dressing rather than substantive measures," said Peter Galvin, a
conservation biologist at the Center for Biological Diversity, a
national group that opposes the Ahmanson Ranch project.</TE>
<TE>   "They come up with these mitigation measures, like, 'We'll fence
this area off.' The effort may be well-intentioned, but years after
the development is built and people are living there, who is going to
make sure that no one drives a dirt bike onto the area?"</TE>
<TE>   While welcoming the chance to poke holes in Ahmanson's plans
through the supplemental review, Los Angeles County politicians have
repeatedly demanded a more detailed analysis.</TE>
<TE>   "To rely on a 10-year-old environmental impact report, especially
on the issue of traffic, is not credible," said Los Angeles County
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky. "If they don't address it in their EIR,
they're going to address it in court."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Supervisor John Flynn countered that an entirely
new environmental review, replete with fresh hurdles, could invite a
lawsuit from the developer. But Flynn's colleague, Supervisor Steve
Bennett, said the omission of updated traffic projections could be a
sticking point when it comes time to vote.</TE>
<TE>   "It's legitimate to say, 'Hey, does this satisfy all the
environmental concerns that should be addressed?'" Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   The battle lines over Ahmanson were drawn years ago, but the fight
gained intensity in recent months as both camps cranked up public
relations campaigns in anticipation of Tuesday's report.</TE>
<TE>   In one full-page newspaper ad, the developer touted its
frog-friendly efforts, declaring that the amphibians "are being
groomed for stardom in a repopulation program." Anti-Ahmanson forces
countered with radio spots featuring actor Martin Sheen asking: "Are
you stuck in traffic right now? If not, you better enjoy this rare
moment. Because it's only going to get worse, thanks to Washington
Mutual Bank."</TE>
<TE>   Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch, the celebrity-studded opposition
group that sponsored the Sheen ad, vowed to campaign against the
project regardless of the county supervisors' decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to try to convince Washington Mutual that this project is
bad business for them," said HBO executive Chris Albrecht, who
co-chairs the group along with producer-director Rob Reiner.</TE>
<TE>   But McGarry dismissed the criticism. "The truth about the project
is that it meets the region's need for new housing in an
environmentally responsible way that puts homes close to jobs," he
said.</TE>

<DH>Violence: Police say Robert Guillory apparently was an
innocent victim of a gang. Large vigil decries the killing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The shooting death of a young man pursuing his goals in the
entertainment industry sparked an angry call against violence at a
Tuesday night vigil.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Demond Guillory, 25, a personal assistant for an ABC sitcom
and former Dorsey High School athlete, was killed Saturday near
Stocker Street and Crenshaw Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   Guillory, who was driving alone, was waiting to make a left turn
when he was shot by a gunman who accused him of being a rival gang
member, police said. He died later at a hospital. Police and
relatives said he was not a gang member.</LD>
<TE>   The gunman, a woman and another man fled the scene near the
Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza mall in a 1995 or 1996 silver four-door
Honda, said LAPD Southwest Division Capt. Morris Smith.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, about 100 people--family members, community activists
and friends--gathered at Leimert Park to ask the public's help in
finding Guillory's killer and to stop senseless violence.</TE>
<TE>   "Three-thirty in the afternoon," said an incredulous Khalid Shah,
executive director of Stop the Violence. "We know somebody saw this."</TE>
<TE>   Karim Abdul-Jabbar, a Miami Dolphins running back who played
football with Guillory at Dorsey High, said: "What hurt me so much is
not the death but the senselessness and ignorance of the death."</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Dorsey in 1994, Guillory received his
bachelor's degree from San Jose State University, his family said. At
the time of his death he was working on the show "My Wife and Kids,"
starring actor Damon Wayans. Guillory's dream was to produce musical
scores for movies, cousin Anissa Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke of marrying his girlfriend of three years and having
kids, she said. "They would tease each other, 'If we win the lottery
tonight, one of us has to ask the other to marry them,'" Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   There have been seven homicides so far this year in the Southwest
Division, the LAPD's Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   The family asks that donations be forwarded to the District
Attorney's Crime Prevention Foundation in memory of Robert Demond
Guillory, 320 W. Temple St. Room 1162, Los Angeles, CA 90012, Attn:
Cyndi Voltz.</TE>

<HD>PUC May End Private Deals to Buy Power</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a decision that will have major implications for the future of
energy deregulation in California, officials will decide Thursday
whether businesses and institutions can continue to buy power from
private electricity providers.</LD>
<LD>   The vote by regulators could effectively kill what was once the
cornerstone of California's foray into deregulation. It also could
force thousands of customers that entered into cost-effective private
deals from July to September last year to cancel them and return to
the public power grid within 90 days.</LD>
<LD>   The state wants to rein in private deals to shore up the troubled
investor-owned utilities and pay off long-term power contracts
purchased at the height of the energy crisis.</LD>
<TE>   The lost savings could be sizable: The University of California
and California State University systems estimate their combined costs
would rise by $50 million a year. The Los Angeles Unified School
District would see $7 million in additional annual costs. Although
private businesses arguably can raise prices to cover new costs, the
dollars cannot be squeezed out of public budgets, officials for the
school systems say.</TE>
<TE>   All are customers of Enron Corp., which despite its bankruptcy
delivers as much as half the state's private power and boasts a
client list of many of the state's largest businesses. Although
customers of all private energy service providers could be stung by
the action, many Enron customers could face additional hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   During last year's energy crisis, Enron temporarily transferred
many of its customers back to the investor-owned utilities to save
money. Now, state regulators contend that those customers not
switched back to Enron service by July 1 should not be eligible to
renew their private, direct-access contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The California Public Utilities Commission blocked all new
direct-access contracts Sept. 20, but left open the issue of whether
thousands of deals signed throughout the summer also would be
suspended. On Thursday, it will consider extending the ban back to
July 1 and forbidding all contract extensions or reassignments on
deals inked before then.</TE>
<TE>   Crafted by Administrative Law Judge Robert Barnett and championed
by Commissioner Carl Wood, the decision would effectively kill
private power purchases. The move is necessary, Wood says, to prevent
disproportionately saddling small, mostly residential users with the
state's burden through rate hikes and surcharges.</TE>
<TE>   About 13% of the state's electricity load is handled by
direct-access providers, which tend to serve the state's biggest
customers, up from 2% on July 1, Wood said. That leaves residential
consumers and smaller businesses to pick up the state tab.</TE>
<TE>   The Barnett decision is being fiercely opposed by service
providers--Enron among them--industry trade groups and private access
customers, which would lose hundreds of millions of dollars in
savings, directing those dollars instead to help the state pay off
its debt.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody could be in trouble if [the Barnett decision]
gets passed," said Daniel W. Douglass, a Woodland Hills lawyer
representing the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, a group of
direct-access proponents.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, an arm of the PUC that
serves as an advocate for California consumers, sounded an alarm bell
in comments filed last week.</TE>
<TE>   "The [decision] would basically give energy service providers 90
days to wrap up their business and leave the state," the comments
said. "Direct access would be over."</TE>
<TE>   The PUC will consider an alternate decision, drafted by
Commissioner Geoffrey F. Brown and supported by direct-access
proponents. It suspends contracts signed after Sept. 20, rather than
making the ruling retroactive to July, and allows contract renewals
and reassignments.</TE>
<TE>   In its comments filed with the PUC, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.
supported the less restrictive Brown decision, but called for a
surcharge to be imposed on direct-access customers to help shoulder
the state's burden. It also opposes allowing direct-access customers
to switch to other direct-access service providers. Southern
California Edison favored the more restrictive proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Enron customers have reason to watch the decision carefully.
Beginning last spring, Enron moved thousands of customer accounts
over to SCE and PG&amp;E--although it continued to honor its price
contracts with those customers.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as prices on the spot market stabilized and utility rates
and surcharges climbed, it shuttled them back to direct access
throughout the summer. UC and CSU sued to block the switch and
settled their case in May. But most other customers were moved
without a fight.</TE>
<TE>   "It was another nightmare for Enron, for our customers, for PG&amp;E,
for everybody," said Michael Lechner, a former account manager at
retail unit Enron Energy Services Inc. in Northern California who is
no longer with the company. "There were bills being misplaced, bills
not being paid, customers threatened with shut-off notices. If I were
a customer I would have sued for whiplash."</TE>
<TE>   Customers in San Diego Gas &amp; Electric's territory were not moved
onto bundled service and back again because SDG&amp;E rates were already
comparable to spot market rates, former employees said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the more restrictive proposal, those customers that were not
receiving electrons from a direct access provider July 1 could be
forced to abandon their contracts and return to bundled service.</TE>
<TE>   "They're finished," said one former executive at Enron Energy
Services.</TE>
<TE>   EES does not disclose customer data. But the company is "a major
provider, if not the major provider" in California, Wood said. He
previously estimated that Enron provides nearly half the state's
private power load.</TE>
<TE>   The company's customer list includes fast food operators
McDonald's, Burger King and Del Taco, stores 7-Eleven, Safeway and
Albertson's, and major companies TRW, IBM and Kaiser Permanente,
according to documents obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   None of the private firms contacted--some of which are in
negotiations with Enron on contract extensions--agreed to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Enron says clients that were receiving bundled service July 1
should be considered direct-access customers because they were
contractually bound to Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Enron's position that since Enron was still charging the
customer the same amount for power as they had agreed to under the
Enron contract, that they were Enron's customers still," said Mike
Day, Enron's outside counsel for regulatory affairs.</TE>
<TE>   But Wood, of the PUC, disagrees, arguing that those customers
would be forced back to bundled service within 90 days if the Barnett
decision prevails.</TE>
<TE>   "In my view, they would be considered to be bundled customers," he
said. "They may very well have a cause of action against Enron."</TE>
<TE>   Day said Enron is "purchasing the electricity and providing the
natural gas for customers and no customer has suffered an
interruption of service."</TE>
<TE>   Still, customers fear that could abruptly change because of the
company's bankruptcy. Although a disruption in service appears
unlikely, even an orderly disposition of assets could sting Enron
customers under the Barnett decision. That's because customers could
be barred from seeking service from other energy service providers,
leaving them no choice but to return to the utilities.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Unified School District "naturally has concerns
about [Enron Energy Services'] ability to serve in the future, as
well as the company's broader financial and legal crises generally,"
LAUSD energy manager Kenneth J. Davis said in testimony to the PUC
last month.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' testimony came in connection with an ongoing investigation
into the effect of Enron's bankruptcy on customers here.
Furthermore, the Barnett decision bans new contracts once terms
expire. Although Enron worked to save its customers from just such a
regulatory pitfall, it appears those efforts may not succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Enron offered across-the-board contract extensions in late June in
anticipation of PUC action, sources familiar with the deals said. The
bulk of those--brief documents with no negotiated terms and bilateral
escape clauses--carried through 2009.</TE>
<TE>   But Wood said that because the terms were not negotiated, those
would be considered new contracts under the Barnett decision and
disallowed. If that view is upheld, Enron's customers would be forced
back to the utilities at the end of current contracts, which begin
expiring as early as March.</TE>
<TE>   It is unknown whether customers of other ESPs face a similar
problem. But for all direct-access customers, the main fear is that a
forced return to investor-owned utilities will be costly.</TE>
<TE>   CSU spokeswoman Clara Potes-Fellow said annual electricity costs
would spike by 40% if Enron service at 19 campuses and the
chancellor's office is replaced by bundled service. For the CSU and
UC systems--seven of 10 UC campuses are under EES contract--the
change could amount to $50 million a year, said CSU energy and
utilities chief Mark Gutheinz.</TE>
<TE>   And in testimony to the PUC last month, LAUSD's Davis estimated
the loss in savings to the district at $7 million a year.</TE>

<HD>Enrollment by Californians in HMOs Slipping</HD>
<DH>Health: In state where managed-care system took root, many
are shifting to preferred provider or 'point of service'  coverage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The percentage of Californians enrolled in HMOs declined last year
for the first time in at least eight years, dropping below 50%, a
report released Tuesday shows.</LD>
<LD>   The decline, a significant milestone in a state where managed care
was pioneered, reflects growing dissatisfaction among employers and
workers with health-maintenance organizations and their limited
choices. It also reflects a paradoxical resurgence in more expensive
health plans that offer greater choices of medical options, such as
preferred provider organizations and "point of service" plans that
allow patients to seek treatment outside their regular health-care
network.</LD>
<LD>   Whether the trend will continue is unclear, according to the
Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational
Trust, which prepared the report showing a dramatic decline in HMO
enrollment to 48% in 2001, from 55% in 2000. The percentage had been
growing steadily since 1994, when 35.3% were in HMOs.</LD>
<TE>   With costs rising sharply, including a 9.9% jump last year in
California, a return to some form of HMO model--with its lower
costs--may occur, said Larry Levitt, vice president of the Kaiser
Foundation. "But it's not happening now. The question now is whether
these more expensive options will be favored as health-care costs
continue to grow."</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser's third annual employer health benefits survey also pointed
out another striking fact that seems to fly in the face of
conventional wisdom that fewer employers are offering health
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   According to Kaiser, the percentage of California employers
offering some form of health-care coverage soared from 48% in 1999 to
66% in 2001. Levitt said the surge reflected the booming economy, the
dot-com boom and the desire among employers to attract the best and
brightest workers by offering good medical plans.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest jump, said the report, occurred among high-wage small
firms (200 or fewer employees) whose workers earned more than
$20,000. The percentage of those employers that offered health care
rose to 75% from 47% during the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Levitt said the boom reflected a strong economy that no longer
exists. "Now that we are in a recession we could very well go back to
former levels," he said. "I would also be willing to bet that a lot
of those high-wage companies don't exist anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Levitt and other experts and observers said the disenchantment
with pure HMOs is leading to other forms of health-care coverage as
employers scramble to manage costs. Even mid-range and some smaller
businesses are moving to self-funded insurance, in which employers
avoid upfront premiums and pay only when a medical claim is filed.</TE>
<TE>   Another model gaining favor in other parts of the nation, although
not yet in California, is one that allows an employee to contribute
pretax dollars to a health savings account that may include an
employer contribution as well. Once an employee's medical costs rise
above a certain amount, usually $1,500 to $3,000, insurance covers
most of the expenses, Levitt said.</TE>
<TE>   The appeal is freedom of choice, but the downside is higher
out-of-pocket expenses, Levitt said.</TE>
<TE>   Even the trade association that represents California health plans
acknowledged the shift.</TE>
<TE>   "This trend reflects the desire of some consumers to have more
options, more choices, easier access to specialists and their desire
to avoid some of the tools that managed care and specifically HMOs
use to control costs. Many HMOs have been offering the same kinds of
benefits offered in PPOs, which is all fine except for the cost
problem," said Walter Zelman, president of the California Assn. of
Health Plans. "Sometimes the public wants to have its cake and eat it
too. Our concern is that we not wipe out the low-cost options because
for too many people that is the only option."</TE>
<TE>   From 1994 through 2000, according to Kaiser and Interstudy
Publications, the percentage of HMO enrollment in California rose
steadily from 35.3% in 1994 to a peak of  54.1% to  55% in 2000.
Nationally, HMO enrollment also fell from its peak of 31% in 1996 to
just 23% last year.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the Kaiser report said, the percentage of
Californians enrolled in PPOs rose to 27% in 2001 from 25% in 2000.
Point-of-service plans, once considered a dead model by some
health-care analysts and experts, rose by the greatest amount, to 25%
from 19%.</TE>
<TE>   Levitt said the managed-care industry is well aware of these
changes and has been scrambling to adapt.</TE>

<HD>Sales of Homes Soar in Southland</HD>
<DH>Real estate: January spike, which boosted prices, is
unlikely to be sustained, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buyers in the Southland snapped up homes last month at the most
hectic rate for a January in 13 years, triggering a steep run-up in
prices, according to a report released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles County, 8,087 new and existing condos and houses
were sold last month, up more than 22% from a year earlier and the
biggest volume for a January since the frenzied market of 1989. The
median price of homes sold advanced 17.5%, to a record $235,000,
according to DataQuick Information Systems Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Orange and Ventura counties also saw double-digit sales increases
last month, as consumers moved to lock in on low interest rates. More
renters have been driven to buy homes as rising apartment rents
approach the cost of homeownership.</LD>
<TE>   Although the January spike in sales was unusual and not likely to
be sustained, analysts said the DataQuick report reaffirmed the
enduring strength of the housing market, which has cushioned the
blows of an otherwise sluggish economy.</TE>
<TE>   A separate national report Tuesday said that construction of new
homes and apartments in January far exceeded expectations, partly
helped by the milder winter weather. And some home builders said
orders early this year were running at a brisk pace, indicating
consumers are becoming more confident about the economy.</TE>
<TE>   At Westwood-based KB Home, the nation's third-largest home
builder, orders for new homes in California jumped almost 27% last
month from a year earlier, Chief Executive Bruce Karatz said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a growing consensus that the economy has seen its worst
days, and while [consumers are] unsure about how quickly it will
recover, they're no longer concerned that we're in a downward
spiral," Karatz said. "That puts a floor on prices and gives people
confidence they can buy without making a bad choice in timing."</TE>
<TE>   Many buyers in the Southland felt January was the right time.</TE>
<TE>   DataQuick's report showed that sales in Los Angeles County climbed
more than 20% in every category--existing houses and condos as well
as new homes. John Karevoll, the analyst who prepared the report,
said the January figures were somewhat inflated by sales carried over
from December, when lenders were slowed by the refinancing boom.
DataQuick's report is based on escrow closings.</TE>
<TE>   Karevoll cautioned against reading too much into one month's data.
In fact, when combining sales in November, December and January, the
total is up a more modest 3.3% from the three-month period a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Los Angeles County home sales in recent months have been
outpacing those in more expensive markets such as Orange County,
largely because of its more abundant supply of lower-priced homes.
But the strong demand and sales are reducing inventory levels, and
that is triggering a surge in prices.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the 17.5% jump in the median price last
month was the strongest since August 1989, when prices rose 19.5%,
according to DataQuick.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frightening to see prices going up like this," said Wendy
Furth, a Coldwell Banker agent in Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   More-affordable homes are moving especially fast.</TE>
<TE>   At the present sales pace, the current supply of resale homes on
the market would be depleted in 2.9 months in Los Angeles County and
in 2.3 months in Orange County, according to the California Assn. of
Realtors</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times before something comes on the market there's
already an offer on it," said Ian Medina, president of SIM Real
Estate in Los Angeles. He said the number of renters looking to
become purchasers in the $230,000 range or lower has increased
rapidly in recent months because of expanding programs that help
first-time buyers. "There's a lack of inventory in our market, and
that translates into a seller's market."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said that pricier homes--those costing $500,000 or
more--in Los Angeles and Orange counties are generally showing
minimal rates of appreciation, compared with those in communities
such as Compton, South-Central Los Angeles, Palmdale and Inglewood,
which are showing double-digit price gains.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, which also experienced the best January in 13
years, sales jumped 14% from a year earlier, to 3,134 houses and
condos. The median price of those sales was $308,000, or nearly 12%
ahead of last year, but was down from the $332,000 mark in December
largely because fewer expensive new homes were sold.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County also saw steep growth, as the median price rose 10%
to $284,000 from a year ago. Sales jumped 28% from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Data for Riverside and San Bernardino counties were not available
Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Support May Boost Japan's Leader</HD>
<DH>Asia: U.S. backing may give Koizumi the resolve needed to
counter his nation's economic ills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>As President Bush headed for South Korea on Tuesday, Japanese Prime
Minister Junichiro Koizumi was left where he was before their summit:
struggling with a bad economy, a looming banking crisis, a vulnerable
reform program and critics increasingly emboldened in parliament and
on the street.</LD>
<LD>   Aware of Koizumi's recent popularity decline, Bush did his best
during the three-day visit to protect his counterpart. The president
soft-pedaled economic issues, left his senior economic team at home
and focused on the U.S.-Japan security alliance.</LD>
<LD>   When the attention did shift to the economy, Bush was extremely
gentle in public. He drew on symbolism by visiting the Meiji Shrine
and by referring in a speech to great leaders of the post-1867 Meiji
restoration--a time of wrenching change as Japan embraced
modernization--to suggest that Koizumi's nation can repeat those
actions. At times, Bush's comments had an almost cheerleader-like
quality. "I'm confident of this man's leadership ability, I'm
confident of his strategy and I'm confident of his desire to
implement this strategy," the president said during a news
conference.</LD>
<TE>   But more than leadership, strategy and desire are required to turn
around Japan's protracted banking and economic ills, analysts say. To
begin with, Japanese prime ministers are politically weaker than U.S.
and British leaders. This places far greater emphasis on consensus.
And with Koizumi's popularity tumbling and strong old-guard interests
on the ascent, any commitment to act seems further away than it did
six months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The markets showed signs of expecting more out of the summit. As
Bush left town, the yen weakened and the benchmark Nikkei fell 2.44%
on Tuesday, closing at 9,847.16, down 246.09 points, after rising for
several days. At midday Wednesday, the index was virtually unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   Bush made a point during the visit to call Koizumi trustworthy, a
friend, a personal advisor, unwavering, steadfast, supportive, bold,
energetic, determined, humorous and another version of Seattle
Mariner star Ichiro Suzuki, who can hit anything you throw at him.</TE>
<TE>   Some Japanese found Bush's oral support a bit over the top for a
nation in which public displays of emotion tend to be muted. "I think
he praised Koizumi too much," said Mitsuo Takii, professor of
international relations at Obirin University. "I'm sure his voice
doesn't represent the views of U.S. industry."</TE>
<TE>   There's little doubt Bush genuinely likes Koizumi and enjoys
strong rapport with the Japanese leader. But there are serious
political calculations going on as well.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi, even in his politically wounded state, represents the
best U.S. hope for change here, given the lack of alternatives in the
major parties. Pushing too hard for change could undermine Koizumi's
position by making him look weak. And it's unclear how much U.S.
pressure would work in Japan's current political environment.</TE>
<TE>   This arguably spurred the administration's decision to give
Koizumi its full support in hopes of infusing him with strength. In
addition to its impact on the global economy, a weak Japanese economy
could undercut Bush's longer-term efforts to oppose terrorism and
develop a missile defense system.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's backing may give Koizumi a modest short-term public boost.
It also may bolster the prime minister's resolve to weather the tough
fight against entrenched economic and political interests. But most
see little chance it will keep Koizumi's powerful political enemies
on the defensive.</TE>
<TE>   "The summit was a very good performance," said Shinichiro
Kawasaki, analyst with the think tank Daiichi Life Research
Institute. "But it won't really change anything."</TE>
<TE>   In his speech Tuesday before parliament, Bush also sought to
inspire change through empathy and leadership by example. He cited
the early 1980s, when the United States was losing its
competitiveness and was weighed down by a savings and loan crisis.</TE>
<TE>   But the skeptics were never far from view. When Bush extolled
Koizumi in parliament as a great reformer, several lawmakers laughed
openly.</TE>
<TE>   Some believe the Bush message was too gentle. Japan has embraced
and endured upheaval at key junctures, they point out. But these
actions generally were preceded by enormous outside pressure that
helped break the domestic logjam, notably during the Meiji
restoration and the post-World War II period.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, our only hope is foreign pressure. We never seem
to learn," said Atsuo Mihara, an independent economic critic. "Bush
really should have delivered a much stronger message on the economy.
It's in disastrous shape, as anyone involved in the markets knows,
and I'm just afraid Koizumi will miss the message."</TE>

<HD>On a PC Near You--Downloadable Films</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: MGM will join with CinemaNow to distribute
movies for a fee over the Internet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Using the aptly titled film "What's the Worst That Could Happen?"
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. today becomes the first major Hollywood
studio to offer downloadable movies over the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The studio, working with CinemaNow Inc. of Marina del Rey, plans
to test the market for online video-on-demand by offering both
downloadable and "streamed" versions of the Martin Lawrence-Danny
DeVito film and "The Man in the Iron Mask," a 1998 action flick
starring Leonardo DiCaprio.</LD>
<LD>   The major studios have not offered any downloadable movies to
date, concerned about fueling piracy and disrupting other, profitable
forms of distribution. But MGM decided to move ahead with tests,
believing that the best way to fight unauthorized services is with
authorized ones.</LD>
<TE>   "Our intention in the next two years is to find out as much as we
can about how consumers want VOD delivered, what they think about it,
[and] how much they want to pay," said Blake Thomas, vice president
of worldwide marketing at MGM Home Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   MGM had previously announced plans to offer downloadable movies
through the "Movielink" joint venture with four other Hollywood
powerhouses, but that effort has struggled to get started.</TE>
<TE>   Unwilling to wait, MGM is breaking from the pack to conduct a wide
variety of experiments with video-on-demand services on its own.</TE>
<TE>   The market for online movies is limited today, given how long it
takes to download them, the picture quality and the shortage of
Internet-connected TV screens. Nevertheless, the movie industry faces
a growing threat from online pirates and Web-based services that let
consumers download unauthorized copies of movies for free.</TE>
<TE>   The Motion Picture Assn. of America succeeded Tuesday in derailing
a controversial Taiwanese Web site, Movie88.com, that let visitors
download movies for $1 per day. But consumers continue to make at
least 1 million free copies of movies each day through online
file-sharing services and Internet chat sites, some experts estimate.</TE>
<TE>   "They're already too late on trying to reel in digital piracy,"
said analyst P.J. McNealy of GartnerG2, a technology research and
consulting firm. Their task now, McNealy said, is coming up with an
offer "that's compelling enough to compete against free."</TE>
<TE>   Another issue is providing video on demand without cutting into
profits from video stores and other distributors.</TE>
<TE>   "It is much more of a business-model question at this point" than
a technology issue, said Richard Baskin, chairman of Intertainer, a
Culver City-based video-on-demand company.</TE>
<TE>   The studios created two video-on-demand ventures, Movielink and
Movies.com, which could deliver their first movies later this year.
But those ventures have drawn an antitrust probe by the Justice
Department, pressuring the studios to strike deals with unaffiliated
companies.</TE>
<TE>   CinemaNow is one of a handful of Web-based movie companies still
on its feet after the dot-com implosion. Aside from the MGM movies,
its library of 1,500 feature films and 500 shorts comes entirely from
independent studios.</TE>
<TE>   Although the site attracts more than 1 million visitors a month,
Chief Executive Curt Marvis said the company still needs "the
locomotive content that drives people in." That means movies from the
seven major Hollywood studios, which own the vast majority of widely
popular films.</TE>
<TE>   Three of those studios, including MGM, have deals with Intertainer
to stream movies, which allows viewers to watch films on demand but
not store them for later viewing. But Intertainer's online service is
available only to customers of selected Internet providers with very
high speed connections.</TE>
<TE>   CinemaNow's test with MGM is broader, enabling any consumer with a
high-speed Internet connection and a Windows-based computer to watch
streamed versions of the two films.</TE>
<TE>   The movies will be available at two speeds: 300 kilobits per
second, which Marvis said delivered a near-VHS-quality picture, and
700 Kbps, which he described as between VHS and DVD quality.</TE>
<TE>   The real departure, though, is that the films also will be
available for downloading. To prevent piracy and preserve the market
for DVD and VHS sales, the movies will come with electronic locks
designed to prevent copying and stop playback 24 hours after the
films are fully downloaded.</TE>
<TE>   The main advantage to downloading is that it delivers a
high-quality picture with none of the interruptions related to
Internet congestion. The big disadvantage, though, is the amount of
time it takes to obtain a movie--more than a day through a dial-up
modem.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the Worst That Could Happen" will go for $3.99 to $5.99,
depending on location and Internet connection. "The Man in the Iron
Mask" will rent for $2.99, or $1.99 if rented in combination with the
other movie.</TE>

<HD>CMGI Chief Is Stepping Down</HD>
<DH>Internet: Move by David Wetherell comes after firm lost
$5.5 billion last year and stock fell 70%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CMGI Inc., the Internet company that bought more than two dozen Web
businesses in four years but lost $5.5 billion last year, said David
Wetherell is stepping down as chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   CMGI's strategy was to reap gains by selling shares of its
businesses to the public. That plan stalled as investor demand for
initial stock offerings and money-losing Web businesses cooled.</LD>
<LD>   "A sacrifice was needed," said David Simons, managing director at
Digital Video Investments, an institutional research firm. "The
numbers speak for themselves. He kept promising a big turnaround and
that never happened."</LD>
<TE>   Wetherell, 47, will continue as chairman of the Andover, Mass.,
company and will be replaced by Chief Financial Officer George
McMillan, 54. The change is effective March 1.</TE>
<TE>   CMGI stock tumbled 70% in the last year, leaving it with a market
value of about $537 million compared with $26.5 billion in December
1999.</TE>
<TE>   While CMGI's stock was soaring, Wetherell bought companies ranging
from Web search service AltaVista Co. to Internet service provider
1stUp.com. The decline in CMGI's shares reduced Wetherell's holdings
to about $36 million from more than $3 billion at the end of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Wetherell "figured now was the right time [as] his best use as a
visionary and mine as a financial guy turned out to be a great
marriage," McMillan said Tuesday. He said that Wetherell wasn't asked
to step down by the board.</TE>
<TE>   McMillan, at CMGI since July, said part of the company's challenge
is to become profitable, before some costs, by January 2003 to
convince money managers to invest in the stock.</TE>
<TE>   "We have nine companies here which we believe offer building
blocks for the long term," McMillan said. "Our focus is to run them,
not churn them."</TE>
<TE>   The firm might acquire additional businesses or sell some units.</TE>
<TE>   CMGI's early successes include Lycos Inc., bought by Terra
Networks for $6.5 billion in October 2000. CMGI sold GeoCities to
Yahoo Inc. in 1999 for $4.1 billion. CMGI shares fell 5 cents to
$1.37 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>CNN Elevates Ryan to Key Post</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The process of revamping CNN continues, as Teya Ryan, who oversaw the
successful summer revamp of the CNN Headline News channel, was named
executive vice president and general manager of CNN's flagship U.S.
channel Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan replaces Sid Bedingfield, a 16-year CNN veteran who became
executive editor, CNN News Group, serving as deputy on editorial
matters to CNN News Group Chairman Walter Isaacson.</LD>
<LD>   The shift comes as CNN, a unit of AOL Time Warner, faces a stiff
ratings challenge from News Corp.'s Fox News Channel, which passed
CNN in January, among the all-news networks. Ryan said her initial
focus at CNN will be shaping a new show anchored by Connie Chung, who
is joining CNN from ABC News. She declined to be specific about
additional changes but said that overall CNN is "on the right road.
We just have to keep pushing.... We'll be looking at all the other
programs. How we shape the news, how creative can we be, how bold can
we be."</LD>
<TE>   At Headline News, Ryan added more information to the screen and
substantially quickened the pace, which some critics found dizzying,
just as they questioned the hiring of former "NYPD Blue" star Andrea
Thompson as an anchor.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the ratings rose even before the war on terror lifted most
news viewing, and the changes have attracted younger viewers, who are
an often elusive target for TV news. "People speak with their
remotes, and they like what we're doing," Ryan said, adding that CNN
and Headline News are "very, very distinct services, and they will
remain distinct."</TE>
<TE>   CNN has already been through a year of intense change, with the
departure of several on-air personalities, the return of Lou Dobbs to
the financial show "Moneyline" and the addition of signature
programs, including a morning show anchored by Paula Zahn and an
evening program from Aaron Brown. Another key program anchored by
Jeff Greenfield was just canceled for lack of ratings, with
Greenfield signing off Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Rolando H. Santos, the president of CNN's Spanish-language
channel, CNN en Espanol, will replace Ryan at Headline News.</TE>

<HD>Walt Disney Investors Get Upbeat Report</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: CEO Eisner makes little mention of financial
setbacks and focuses much of his comments on lucrative ESPN.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HARTFORD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Michael Eisner took his annual
meeting on the road Tuesday and into the backyard of one of the
company's few bright lights--cable sports network ESPN--to put the
best face on an otherwise bleak year.</LD>
<LD>   In an upbeat assessment that made little mention of Disney's
financial setbacks in 2001, Eisner focused much of his comments on
ESPN, the lucrative cable network Disney won in its 1996 acquisition
of Capital Cities/ABC.</LD>
<LD>   "The real reason we chose Hartford was because of its proximity to
Bristol, home of the greatest four letters in sports
entertainment--ESPN," Eisner said in a presentation at the Hartford
Civic Center. "I will tell you that if we had gotten only this
incredible sports network when we purchased Capital Cities/ABC we
would have gotten our money's worth."</LD>
<TE>   Eisner praised the volunteer efforts of Disney employees after
Sept. 11, but otherwise downplayed the effect on the travel and
tourism industry that drives about one-third of Disney's business.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some investors remain concerned that Disney is no longer
the formidable moneymaker it was during much of the 1990s, noting
that dependable breadwinners in years past--video, consumer products
and animation--were stumbling well before the recent economic
downturn. Disney's ABC also has fallen into third place from first
place two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But Eisner, touting the strength of Disney characters and brands
as well as the company's growth prospects in cable, wireless and
broadband technology, said the company's problems are short term.</TE>
<TE>   "When the economy improves, there can be little doubt that our
family of brands will help propel resurgent growth," Eisner said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Disney's woes, company executives faced few tough
questions from shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   One asked about discounts for Disney's cruise line. Another
complained about the noise level on rides at Walt Disney World. An
investor wearing Mickey Mouse gloves asked about prime-time
programming for "Wonderful World of Disney."</TE>
<TE>   There were some serious issues raised by shareholder groups,
though. One resolution called for Disney to stop awarding consulting
work to its auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers to avoid potential
conflicts of interest. The resolution, which came in response to the
collapse of Enron Corp., failed after Disney said it would adopt a
policy discontinuing its practice of contracting with the same firm
for audit and consulting work.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut state Treasurer Denise L. Nappier, principal fiduciary
of Connecticut's $20-billion state pension fund, which is an investor
in Disney, praised the action.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very significant announcement by the CEO of a very
important U.S. company. Make no mistake, Disney's position has
evolved. Just a few months ago, Disney flatly opposed this
resolution. Today, the company has truly come full circle."</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders also voted down resolutions calling for Disney to
adopt a code of conduct for companies that manufacture in China and
to report on its theme park safety guidelines and all ride injuries
over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   A third resolution that would have barred any officer from
receiving more than 5% of the total options granted in a given year
also was overwhelmingly rejected. Even so, proponent Marni Thompson,
of the group Responsible Wealth, drew loud applause after she said,
"while shareholders' return has been poor, Disney's executives have
gotten rich."</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, some shareholders expressed disappointment with
the presentations.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a pretty tightly controlled meeting, as usual," said
stockholder Pat Rabby.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything was very general and very cutesy, but I would like to
have had something more specific about what the company was doing,"
said Joan Weed, a preschool teacher from New Canaan, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said Disney had cut more than
$500 million in costs and would emerge more profitable when the
economy rebounds. "As troubling as the economic conditions are, it is
important to keep them in perspective and recognize that this company
has been through uncertain times before," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney shares fell $1.04 to $22.86 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>McCain 'Tainted' by Telecom's Donations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LOS ANGELES</DL>
<LD>Sen. John  McCain (R-Ariz.) said Tuesday that he had been "tainted"
by donations from Global Crossing Ltd., but never acted improperly on
behalf of the telecom firm.</LD>
<LD>   McCain, who has received more money from Global Crossing than any
other member of Congress, said he expected the Senate Commerce
Committee to investigate the company as soon as it clears its
schedule of Enron Corp. proceedings. McCain is the ranking Republican
on the committee.</LD>
<LD>   Some $50 billion of investor money in Global Crossing has
vaporized since 2000, and the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the FBI are investigating the firm's accounting methods.</LD>
<TE>   "I am tainted by this because I received money from them," McCain
told reporters after addressing a Town Hall Los Angeles luncheon
about the need for campaign finance reform. McCain, who campaigned
for president in 2000 on the need to overhaul campaign financing,
lambasted the system during his luncheon speech.</TE>
<TE>   McCain collected $31,000 from Global Crossing employees in March
1999 for his presidential campaign. That month, he urged the Federal
Communications Commission to open the market for laying undersea

<DL></DL>
<LD>When an economic slowdown last year threatened to produce a gap
between Global Crossing Ltd.'s first-quarter sales figures and the
numbers it had promised Wall Street, the ambitious telecommunications
giant didn't want to disappoint.</LD>
<LD>   Global Crossing made the numbers, but now the company stands
accused of using aggressive--and potentially fraudulent--accounting
techniques to inflate its sales and earnings figures. Officials from
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation are combing Global Crossing's books.</LD>
<LD>   At the center of the growing controversy is Joseph Perrone, the
company's executive vice president of finance and former outside
auditor. Perrone has declined to be interviewed, but former
colleagues say the company's response to the cash shortfall was
consistent with Perrone's aggressive, hubristic personality.</LD>
<TE>   Despite spending 31 years as an auditor and partner with the Big
Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., Perrone hardly fits the
mold of the conservative, buttoned-down accountant.</TE>
<TE>   Former colleagues describe the short, rotund 53-year-old as a
"street-smart" executive who ran his department as his personal
fiefdom. He scooped up candy from workers' desks, paid generous
salaries to favored employees, and made thinly veiled threats to the
vice president who questioned some of his accounting decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "With Joe, it was all about personal loyalty," said one former
employee in Global Crossing's accounting and finance group. "If you
weren't part of the club, you were out."</TE>
<TE>   By the time he joined the company in May 2000, Joe Perrone was
intimately familiar with Global Crossing. At Andersen, as the
accounting firm now is known, he served as global managing partner
for the firm's work with Global Crossing and directed Andersen's work
in connection with Global's 1998 initial public offering, which
raised about $400 million.</TE>
<TE>   Though it is common for outside auditors to jump ship and go
in-house at the companies they audit, Perrone's move was unusual
because he was so highly placed at Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   It piqued the interest of SEC officials, who questioned whether
Perrone's hiring "impaired" Andersen's independence. Ultimately, the
SEC was satisfied that Andersen "met the requirements for
independence," according to Global Crossing spokeswoman Becky
Yeamans.Before leaving Andersen, Perrone rose to become the firm's
partner in charge of the metro communications, media and
entertainment practice. In that role, he worked with telecom
heavyweights, including AT&amp;T Corp. and its spinoff, Lucent
Technologies Inc.</TE>
<TE>   But Global Crossing, an audacious upstart, was arguably sexier
than industry stalwarts. Founder Gary Winnick raised $20 billion to
build a worldwide undersea phone network and spent lavishly to make
his vision a reality.</TE>
<TE>   To lure Perrone from Andersen, Global Crossing offered him a
$2.5-million signing bonus on top of a base salary of $400,000 and a
target annual bonus of $400,000, according to SEC filings. Perrone
also received 500,000 Global Crossing stock options, along with
shares in its sister company, Asia Global Crossing Ltd., which were
to vest over a three-year period. Perrone also is chief accounting
officer at Asia Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after arriving at Global Crossing's executive offices in
Beverly Hills, Perrone held a meeting with the company's finance
employees and told them "there should be no significant changes," the
former employee said. But a few months later, the accounting group
was moved to Madison, N.J., where the bulk of the company's finance
team was based. One member of the Beverly Hills accounting staff was
offered a job in New Jersey, but the rest were laid off with
severance, the employee said.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to move the group to New Jersey was "a collective
leadership decision," said company spokeswoman Tisha Kresler, adding
that Global Crossing "had already moved significant business
operations to the East Coast."</TE>
<TE>   Perrone had strong ties to New Jersey. He graduated from Seton
Hall University in South Orange, N.J., with a degree in accounting in
1969. He was active in the school's alumni association and sent his
son, Joe, to Seton Hall as well. He also was active in the New Jersey
Society of Certified Public Accountants, where he was a member of the
board of trustees and was chairman of the group's committee on
accounting and auditing standards.</TE>
<TE>   At Global Crossing, Perrone hired several accountants from his
office at Andersen and paid them handsomely for the switch. Several
junior staffers were paid salaries of $70,000 to $120,000, more than
Global Crossing employees with substantially more experience and
education. Kresler said Global Crossing employees "are paid
appropriate salaries commensurate with their experience."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, things began to turn sour for the telecom industry.
Optimistic network operators built huge amounts of infrastructure
just as a nationwide economic slowdown curtailed corporate spending
for such services. That left companies such as Global Crossing with
insufficient revenue to pay the massive debt they had accumulated to
build their costly networks.</TE>
<TE>   By the first quarter of 2001, cash was running short and time was
running out. Telecom companies were boosting their earnings reports
by entering into deals to swap capacity on each other's networks
using instruments called indefeasible rights of use, or IRUs.
Companies, including Global Crossing, would sometimes buy an IRU and
book the price as a capital expense, which could be spread over a
number of years. But the income from IRUs would be booked as revenue,
which would ring an immediate boost to the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, the practice is within the arcane rules that govern
accounting methods, but only if the swap transactions are real and
entered into for a genuine business purpose.</TE>
<TE>   The practice worried Roy Olofson, Global Crossing's vice president
of finance. In meetings with Perrone, Olofson "voiced concerns" about
the company's financial practices, particularly the numbers it
reported for the first quarter of 2001, according to Olofson's
attorney, Brian Lysaght. Olofson told Perrone he feared Global
Crossing "had entered into last-minute swap transactions" to make
sure the company's revenue and earnings figures would meet Wall
Street's expectations, Lysaght said.</TE>
<TE>   "Perrone immediately responded by implicitly threatening Mr.
Olofson with termination," according to Lysaght. "He told Mr. Olofson
that ... a list would be created as to which employees would be laid
off. He told Mr. Olofson to call him on June 6 to find out his
status."</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing has said that it reviewed the allegations made by
Olofson and found them to be "without merit." The company has
described Olofson as a disgruntled former employee who is trying to
extract a cash settlement.Perrone also may have used his position at
Global Crossing to steer business to his son's start-up company,
Chicago-based Withit, which uses the Internet to stream content to
large financial services companies. Global Crossing Financial
Markets, a division of Global Crossing that specializes in the
financial services industry, announced a deal in June to distribute
Withit's streaming media broadcast system to its clients around the
world. Neither company disclosed whether any money changed hands.</TE>
<TE>   Perrone was not involved in the deal, said Kresler, the Global
Crossing spokeswoman. She declined to discuss the financial value of
the agreement, calling it "proprietary information" that the company
wouldn't make public "for competitive reasons." However, Global
Crossing is reevaluating whether the deal should be disclosed in its
annual report. It's unclear how Global Crossing became acquainted
with Withit, which analysts describe as relatively obscure.</TE>
<TE>   Perrone's son, Withit Chief Executive and founder Joe Perrone,
said he couldn't comment on the deal with Global Crossing because the
product involved in the deal "has yet to be released, and I can't
talk about products that haven't been released in the market."</TE>

<HD>The Bilingual Schooling Battle Flares Anew</HD>
<DH>Education: Author of Prop. 227 accuses state board of
weighing new rules that would nullify the law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly four years after voters overwhelmingly approved an initiative
to effectively end bilingual education in California, forces on both
sides of the issue are at war with the state over how the law should
be applied in classrooms.</LD>
<LD>   Ron Unz, author of Proposition 227, accuses the State Board of
Education of trying to nullify his initiative. The board is weighing
new regulations that Unz claims would funnel hundreds of thousands of
immigrant children back into bilingual classes.</LD>
<LD>   Bilingual advocates, meanwhile, charge that those same regulations
do not go far enough to protect the rights of immigrant parents who
want schools to make exceptions for their children.</LD>
<TE>   The pro-bilingual forces have taken their case to the state's most
powerful Latino legislators, one of whom is preparing a bill that
would protect parents' ability to choose bilingual education. These
programs have been largely dismantled but still exist on a small
scale.</TE>
<TE>   Unz, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, has mounted a one-man media
blitz, issuing news releases and calling reporters coast to coast to
get his point across.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 227 opponents are trying to "completely restore the
system of bilingual education in California," said Unz, who backed a
similar measure that passed in Arizona nearly 18 months ago and is
now mounting campaigns in Massachusetts and Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 227 was supposed to settle the bilingual issue in
California once and for all. But the rancor that has simmered for
years flared in recent months. It is expected to rise again today at
a state Assembly hearing on bilingual education.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very emotional issue," said John Mockler, executive
director of the State Board of Education. "Our job is make sure the
law works as it is written. It's been difficult because people have
strong feelings."</TE>
<TE>   The renewed debate could spell political peril for Gov. Gray Davis
as he seeks reelection. Davis opposed Proposition 227 but has vowed
to enforce it. The leading Republican challenger, former Los Angeles
Mayor Richard Riordan, endorsed the initiative and contributed money
to the Proposition 227 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan has not yet made an issue of the bilingual controversy.
But Unz and others are publicly questioning whether Davis' appointees
on the State Board of Education are trying to unravel the law at the
governor's behest--an accusation strongly denied by the Davis
administration.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor is certainly not trying to undermine the spirit of
227," said spokeswoman Hilary McLean.</TE>
<TE>   In broad terms, Proposition 227 requires all California
schoolchildren to be taught in English. The measure also makes
bilingual programs available if parents apply for waivers, or
exceptions to the law, at their children's schools. Most parents have
opted for English instruction: just 12% of the state's 1.5-million
students remain in bilingual programs.</TE>
<TE>   Many say the current debate stems from vague language in the law.
Like many laws, it requires clarification through elaborate
regulations. An initial set of rules was adopted after the law
passed; now those rules are being revised and consolidated with other
rules relating to immigrant students.</TE>
<TE>   Unz and bilingual advocates agree on one thing: the new
regulations are wrongheaded. Both sides fear the rules would
inappropriately give teachers and administrators the authority to
decide who receives bilingual education.</TE>
<TE>   From there, they part ways. Unz says Proposition 227 clearly gives
the final say to parents. But the regulations, as written, would
allow school officials to subvert the initiative by giving them the
authority to refer large numbers of students into bilingual classes,
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Bilingual advocates have the opposite concern--that school
officials will use the regulations to block children's access to
bilingual classes. They want the rules revised to enhance parents'
choices of bilingual programs, customized to their children's needs.</TE>
<TE>   The advocates have long contended that schools either ignore
parents' wishes or fail to adequately inform them of their options--a
contention that was supported by a recent independent analysis by the
American Institutes for Research in Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   The report, ordered by state law, found that parents were often
unaware of their right to choose bilingual programs and that their
options were often unclear.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fear is that these regulations will be used by districts to
deny parents the right to place their child in an alternative
program," said Mary Hernandez, a staff attorney with the group
Multicultural Education, Training and Advocacy, which has helped
organize parent protests at state school board meetings.</TE>
<TE>   State Board Is Caught in Middle</TE>
<TE>   Privately, state officials criticize the advocates' demands,
saying bilingual programs customized to individual students would
bankrupt school districts.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way we are going to allow that," said one state board
member, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. "It would
break the system."</TE>
<TE>   Assailed from both sides, members of the California school board
say they are merely trying to clarify the law and ensure parents'
rights are protected. "I'm confident that the regulations are legal
and appropriate under Proposition 227," board President Reed Hastings
said.</TE>
<TE>   Disputes have broken out on other fronts as well--over everything
from the types of books to the tests that should be used for these
students.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides in the debate say their positions have been vindicated
by the experience of the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   Although the state has yet to thoroughly analyze test scores, Unz
says his own calculations based on Stanford 9 tests show large gains
among English-language learners.</TE>
<TE>   Bilingual advocates say the gap between these children and fluent
English speakers has in fact widened.</TE>
<TE>   Even as bilingual-education advocates haggle with the school
board, they also have pressed their case with Sacramento's Latino
power brokers.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez and others in the bilingual coalition have gained the
support of state Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), chairman of
the Latino Legislative Caucus.</TE>
<TE>   Polanco shares parents' concerns over the proposed regulations and
has protested to the state school board. Separately, he has ignited
debate with plans to introduce legislation that would require
"appropriate instruction, curriculum and materials" for students with
limited English skills.</TE>
<TE>   Critics Upset by Wording of Bill</TE>
<TE>   "The instruction shall be understandable to the pupil and shall be
integrated into the regular school day," a summary of the bill says.</TE>
<TE>   That, critics say, constitutes a return to bilingual education.</TE>
<TE>   "[Advocates] want separate teachers, separate books, separate
classrooms," said one state board member, who also asked to remain
anonymous for fear of angering Latino lawmakers. "It fundamentally
confuses my sense of justice and civil rights."</TE>
<TE>   Polanco says he is not trying to skirt Proposition 227, but to
ensure that immigrant children get the opportunities they deserve.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this is good, sound public policy," he said of his
pending bill. "Our interest is to teach kids to master the English
language."</TE>

<HD>Death Sentence in 1980 Double Slaying Reversed</HD>
<DH>Courts: U.S. appellate panel finds attorney failed to offer
mitigating evidence, including client's brain damage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court on Tuesday reversed the death sentence of a
man convicted of a double homicide in Fresno, ruling that the
defendant's attorney had provided constitutionally deficient
representation.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in its third death-penalty
reversal this month, ruled 2 to 1 that Fernando E. Caro's trial
lawyer had negligently failed to investigate that his client suffered
from brain damage and child abuse.</LD>
<LD>   Consequently, the appellate court said, the attorney also failed
to explain to the jury how repeated beatings and brain damage from
pesticide exposure might have contributed to Caro's aggressiveness
and lack of judgment.</LD>
<TE>   If such mitigating evidence had been presented to jurors, they
might have sentenced Caro to life in prison rather than death, the
court said.</TE>
<TE>   "The omission of this evidence renders Caro's death sentence
unreliable," Judge Warren J. Ferguson wrote for the majority, which
upheld the ruling of a federal trial judge. "A little explanation can
go a long way. In this case, it might have made the difference
between life and death."</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson, joined by Judge Harry Pregerson, wrote that Fresno
Public Defender Marc Ament failed to present crucial information on
Caro's exposure to neurotoxins and child abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "The penalty phase jury was deprived of this critical explanation
in determining Caro's culpability for his crime," Ferguson wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Andrew J. Kleinfeld issued a strong dissent, saying the
trial lawyer had done an adequate job. The 9th Circuit's majority did
not follow Supreme Court precedents on what constitutes "ineffective
assistance of counsel," Kleinfeld added.</TE>
<TE>   Dane Gillette, deputy attorney general, said the ruling was "very
troubling." He said the state would either ask the 9th Circuit to
rehear the case before a larger panel of judges or ask the U.S.
Supreme Court to review the decision.</TE>
<TE>   But Caro's current lawyer, Lynne S. Coffin, the chief state public
defender, said, "I'm very gratified that the 9th Circuit upheld the
findings [of U.S. District Judge James Ware], which I think were fair
and accurately describe my client's disabilities."</TE>
<TE>   Caro, 52, has been on death row 20 years. He was convicted in
October 1981 of the 1980 shooting of two Fresno County
teenagers--Mary Booher and Mark Hatcher--who were riding their
bicycles near an orchard. Caro was sentenced to death two months
later.</TE>
<TE>   The murder verdict and the death sentence were upheld by the
California Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court declined review.</TE>
<TE>   Caro then sought review in federal district court in San Jose,
where his case had been tried after a judge granted a change of
venue.</TE>
<TE>   Ware initially ruled Caro was not entitled to an evidentiary
hearing on Coffin's contention that the trial attorney had failed to
adequately investigate Caro's brain damage and abuse. The 9th Circuit
reversed Ware's decision and ordered him to hold the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Coffin presented extensive testimony on Caro's background and
presented three experts on toxic chemicals. Caro was the son of poor
farm laborers who beat him throughout his childhood, hitting him with
fists, sticks, boots and tools. Caro was born with a 3-inch lump on
his head due to the use of forceps during his delivery and had
several head injuries as a child.</TE>
<TE>   Exposure to Toxic Chemicals Cited</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Caro "spent his childhood working and playing in
pesticide-soaked fields," according to the 9th Circuit decision.</TE>
<TE>   Caro's exposure to toxic chemicals continued into adulthood,
according to the ruling. During high school, Caro worked as a
"flagger" for a crop-dusting company, indicating to pilots where they
should spray pesticides onto the fields. Later, as a maintenance
worker at FMC Chemical Corp., a manufacturer of toxic pesticides,
Caro responded to chemical spills, repaired the ventilation system
and was regularly exposed to pesticides and "was poisoned by a number
of toxic chemicals at the plant," Ferguson wrote.</TE>
<TE>   A neurologist, a neuropsychiatrist and toxicologist all testified
that at the time of Caro's trial they would have found he was
suffering from brain damage due to exposure to neurotoxicants, his
personal history or a combination of the two.</TE>
<TE>   The experts also testified that relevant information on the effect
of toxic chemicals was available at the time of Caro's trial. Also,
they testified that the sort of damage Caro suffered could have
impaired his judgment, while not necessarily lowering his I.Q.</TE>
<TE>   The state did not present any expert witnesses. Ware concluded
that the record "irrefutably establishes that [Caro] suffered brain
damage as a result of his exposure to toxic pesticides as well as his
personal background."</TE>
<TE>   Majority Uphold Findings on Trial Lawyer</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit majority Tuesday upheld that finding and Ware's
conclusion that the trial lawyer had provided constitutionally
ineffective assistance.</TE>
<TE>   The majority said its ruling was consistent with a recent Supreme
Court decision that held an attorney's failure to investigate and
present evidence of a defendant's mental defect and social history
constitutes deficient performance.</TE>
<TE>   Kleinfeld countered that the trial lawyer had consulted two
psychiatrists, a clinical psychologist and a licensed social worker
and they came up with no strong mitigating evidence. Also, Kleinfeld
asserted that even if they had, "it probably wouldn't have made any
difference to the outcome" because Caro had functioned competently in
college and the Marine Corps and had prior crimes, which the
sentencing jury considered.</TE>
<TE>   Kleinfeld said the majority's opinion stood for "the proposition
that if anyone can come up with anything that might have bolstered
whatever case the defense had during the decades following imposition
of a death penalty, then the defendant is entitled to a new penalty
trial."</TE>

<HD>Will the Real Riordan Please Stand?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE LOPEZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With only two weeks to go until the primary, it's now as clear as
could be. Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan should never have
run for governor.</LD>
<LD>   In a matter of weeks, he's gone from a Republican primary shoo-in
to a real question mark, and I'm not just talking about politics. I'm
talking about whether he'll get a crypt in the new cathedral.</LD>
<LD>   Riordan's name popped up on a list of major donors who might have
an inside track to prime real estate in the 1,300-crypt mausoleum
under Our Lady of the Angels in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Mary McNamara of The Times reported that four crypts are directly
under the altar, along with six exclusive chapels nearby. Kind of
like sky boxes for the dead.</TE>
<TE>   Should Riordan, a devout Catholic and pal of Los Angeles Cardinal
Roger M. Mahony, get a Rolls Royce tomb at the Rog Mahal? I would
have said yes before the campaign, no question about it. But now I'm
not so sure.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, who once referred to abortion as murder, is running on a
vow of supporting a woman's right to choose. That might be safe
politically, but it runs counter to everything the church preaches,
not to mention Riordan's own words.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, despite more signs of waffling, Riordan is backing the
death penalty. This further calls into question his belief in the
sanctity of life, and suggests that he's out of step once more with
the Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   Just two years ago, in a gesture of humanity, Mahony issued a
public plea for Gov. Gray Davis to put a stop to the death penalty.
It had no apparent effect on Davis, who's always had the personality
of an executioner, but at least Mahony gave it an honest try.</TE>
<TE>   I don't mean to get into the church's business here, but it seems
to me that Riordan's standing in an elite Catholic fraternal order,
the Knights of Malta, should be subject to review on the basis of his
gubernatorial campaign. I just can't imagine that too many Knights
are as far out of step as he is, and I haven't even mentioned that
Riordan is a gay-rights advocate.</TE>
<TE>   Frankly, I like that Riordan is a little of this and a little of
that, which in some ways makes him a strong statewide candidate in
California. The question is whether he's truly (a) a moderate, (b) a
well-intentioned guy who just can't make up his mind or (c) yet
another candidate who will say whatever he thinks might work at the
polls.</TE>
<TE>   One political consultant told me that Riordan was always
unequivocally anti-abortion, but started hanging out with Hollywood
types and other self-reverential wildlife who preached a new
religion.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick surrendered himself to what I'll call the Westside limousine
liberals. These are very rich, trendy people who don't worry about
public safety because they live behind gates, and their kids are in
private school so they don't care about public education. But they're
really into pro-choice."</TE>
<TE>   Then Riordan met his third wife, Nancy Daly, who comes out of that
same orbit. So when he should have been cycling the French
countryside on croissant runs, Riordan ended up having to figure out
what kind of man he was. That's a mistake at any age, but
particularly dangerous in the heat of a campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "He had people around him who convinced him abortion was going to
make the difference between him winning and losing, so he became
obsessive about it and kept talking about it," said the political
consultant.</TE>
<TE>   It was like waving a target in the face of Davis, whose
bone-diggers came up with the tape in which Riordan comes off like
Pat Robertson on abortion. So now Riordan is in the awkward position
of explaining how, as governor, or as a man, he could support
something he once referred to as murder.</TE>
<TE>   "He put this on himself by making abortion the centerpiece of his
campaign," says the consultant, "when it should have been about Gray
Davis."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it should have been about housing, transit, jobs, energy
and education. But Riordan is off his stroke now, with Bill Simon and
Bill Jones closing in on him as they make sport of his personality
changes and flip-flops.</TE>
<TE>   In a clear signal that Riordan is flummoxed, he's come out against
lobbyists. Yeah, we get it. Davis has been bought off. But lobbyists
are part of the scene, working both sides of every issue, and some of
them can actually educate a guy who's as short on public policy
experience as Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   There's an even stronger sign that Riordan is in panic mode. He
canceled a ski trip. Is that the Dick Riordan we know? Is it the Dick
Riordan he knows?</TE>
<TE>   There's still time to bag it, Dick, and make a down payment on a
crypt near the altar. Politics is the graveyard of good intentions,
and it ain't no shortcut to heaven.</TE>

<HD>Killer Dogs' Owners Ignored Danger Warnings, Jury Told</HD>
<DH>Court: Prosecutor says 30 incidents preceded the mauling
death of a San Francisco woman. Defendants' attorneys deny
negligence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Francisco couple on trial for the fatal dog-mauling of their
neighbor knew their massive Presa Canario dogs were dangerous yet did
nothing to prevent a ferocious attack, prosecutors said during
opening statements Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Diane Whipple was not the first victim of these dogs, but was the
last in a line of almost 30 prior warnings and incidents," Assistant
Dist. Atty. James Hammer said in Los Angeles County Superior Court,
where the case was moved because of publicity in the Bay Area. "They
disregarded all of those warnings and Diane Whipple is dead as a
result of that."</LD>
<LD>   Showing gruesome autopsy photographs and diagrams of the Pacific
Heights apartment where the attack occurred, Hammer said officers
found Whipple lying face down, covered in blood and her clothes
ripped off.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorneys countered by calling the attack on the
33-year-old college lacrosse coach an unexpected and tragic accident.
They said that Marjorie Knoller, 46, and Robert Noel, 60, were
responsible owners and that the dogs were not vicious.</TE>
<TE>   The impassioned statements, which lasted all day in the crowded
downtown courtroom, set the stage for the trial for the husband and
wife attorney team. Whipple was attacked by the dogs, which each
weighed more than 100 pounds, on Jan. 26, 2001, as she scrambled to
enter her San Francisco apartment. She died of blood loss and
asphyxiation, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller and Noel face charges of involuntary manslaughter and
keeping a mischievous dog. Knoller also faces second-degree murder
charges because she was in the apartment hallway during the attack.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Knoller could face 15 years to life in state prison.
Noel could face four years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs, Bane and Hera, have been put to death.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Tuesday that Knoller and Noel were associates of
the Aryan Brotherhood, a white supremacist prison gang, and that they
were keeping the dogs for inmates at Pelican Bay State Prison. Hammer
said they were part of a scheme, called "Dog O War," to breed, raise
and train aggressive guard dogs for the inmates, one of whom they
adopted.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys, however, maintained that their clients were not
part of any such operation. Knoller's attorney, Nedra Ruiz, said the
couple were keeping the dogs because the inmates wanted to draw
pictures of them.</TE>
<TE>   The 12 jurors and six alternates are expected to hear testimony
from prison experts, veterinarians and neighbors during the trial,
estimated to last between four and five weeks.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Hammer said Whipple had returned from buying groceries
at the same time that Knoller finished taking Bane for a walk and
opened her own door, allowing Hera to enter the hall. Whipple's key
was in her door's lock, and she had placed one bag of groceries
inside when the first dog lunged at her, he said.</TE>
<TE>   An elderly neighbor heard growling, barking and pounding on her
door, and a few minutes later heard someone yell, "Stop." The
neighbor called 911. Knoller did not call, Hammer said.</TE>
<TE>   When officers arrived, Whipple's throat had been torn and she was
trying to crawl toward her door, Hammer said. There were marks or
gashes on her thighs, back, breast, neck and arms.</TE>
<TE>   "Diane Whipple was covered literally from her head almost to her
toes from wounds from these two dogs," Hammer said.</TE>
<TE>   Hammer said neither defendant showed any remorse after Whipple's
death. He played a television interview during which Knoller said her
neighbor had ample time to enter her apartment and slam the door.</TE>
<TE>   The couple deliberately ignored warnings about the dogs'
unpredictable and dangerous nature, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Janet Coumbs, who testified Tuesday, kept the dogs on her Northern
California farm and said she told Knoller on several occasions that
Hera killed both her sheep and her daughter's cat. A veterinarian
wrote a letter to the couple, advising them, "These animals would be
a liability in any household," Hammer said.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs, which Hammer called "some of the biggest and most
aggressive dogs in the world," had bitten or attacked others numerous
times, including an incident when one of the dogs lunged at a woman
who was eight months pregnant and another when Bane nearly severed
Noel's finger. One of the dogs had previously bitten Whipple,
prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   But in her opening statement, Ruiz said that the couple took their
dogs to Laundromats, to restaurants and a brew pub, and that "the
dogs were never a problem, whatsoever."</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz said Knoller did everything she could to protect Whipple from
the "jaws of this berserk beast."</TE>
<TE>   That afternoon, Knoller yelled at Bane to stop, yanked him back
and covered Whipple with her own body, Ruiz said, getting tearful at
times. The dogs overpowered her client and made it impossible for her
to stop them in time to save Whipple, Ruiz said as she got down on
the courtroom floor and acted out the attack.</TE>
<TE>   In her attempts to put Whipple out of harm's way, Knoller was
bitten and bruised, Ruiz said.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is sorrier that Marjorie Knoller could not save Ms.
Whipple than Marjorie Knoller, who risked her life," Ruiz said.</TE>
<TE>   Noel's attorney, Bruce Hotchkiss, said his client was in no way
responsible because he arrived home after the incident was over.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Noel was not present at any time during the tragic events,"
Hotchkiss said during his brief opening statement.</TE>
<TE>   Noel and Knoller were responsible with their pets, frequently
taking them on walks and to the veterinarian, Hotchkiss said.</TE>
<TE>   Whipple's mother, Penny Whipple-Kelly, came from Connecticut to
watch the trial. She said that seeing the photographs during opening
statements was "heart wrenching."</TE>
<TE>   "That's not how I try to remember my daughter," she said. "But she
would have wanted me to be here.... I intend to stay here, no matter
what."</TE>

<HD>S&amp;P Downgrades Farmers Insurance Group's Ratings</HD>
<DH>Financial services: The insurer is the second to face a
downgrade as claims have cut reserves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steep losses in homeowners insurance led a major rating company to
downgrade Farmers Insurance Group on Tuesday and signaled more rate
hikes ahead for policyholders nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   Standard &amp; Poor's cut Farmers' credit and financial strength
ratings by two notches, to A from AA-, after two years of rising
claims costs eroded the Los Angeles-based insurer's capital reserves,
said S&amp;P analyst Grace Osborne.</LD>
<LD>   The action was the second time this year that a major insurer
faced a downgrade. Last month, A.M. Best cut its financial strength
rating of State Farm's California subsidiary, State Farm General
Insurance Co., one notch from A- to B+ because of similar losses in
the insurer's homeowners line.</LD>
<TE>   Such downgrades make it more expensive for companies to borrow
money and are considered a blow to insurers' reputations.</TE>
<TE>   The rating actions are expected to lead to more rate hikes for
U.S. homeowners, whose premiums started rising in 2001 after being
stable for several years. In California, State Farm has asked for two
6.9% increases, Allstate applied for a 22.3% increase and Farmers has
requested five rate hikes, ranging from 5% to 6.9% each.</TE>
<TE>   "Homeowners insurance has been problematic, and that is why
[insurers] have been doing a lot of these rate increases," Osborne
said. "All these companies will continue to look at their results in
individual states and see if rates need to be adjusted further."</TE>
<TE>   Farmers' pretax losses jumped in 2000 to $865.5 million from
$103.4 million in the previous year, and 2001  probably was worse,
Osborne said. Farmers, which is the nation's third-largest home and
auto insurer, hasn't released its financial results for last year,
but the insurer said it lost $400 million in Texas alone because of a
huge increase in mold-related damage claims.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers and other insurers also have been hurt by storm-related
losses in the Midwest and an increase in the frequency and severity
of claims nationwide, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers officials said Tuesday the company had already taken
significant steps to reverse the losses, such as raising rates,
restricting coverage, spreading risk through reinsurance and
accepting a $500-million infusion from its parent company, Zurich
Financial Services Group.</TE>
<TE>   Those actions convinced S&amp;P that the insurer's outlook is stable
and that its operating results probably will improve this year,
Osborne said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the changes by Farmers and other insurers have prompted a
backlash, however. A Santa Monica-based consumer group, the
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, accused insurers of
gouging consumers and asked California Insurance Commissioner Harry
Low not to allow further rate increases. All rate changes in
California must be approved by regulators.</TE>
<TE>   In Texas, by contrast, insurers face few restrictions on raising
rates, and some companies have boosted premiums by as much as 200%
after mold-related claims spiraled last year. Thousands of homeowners
have had their policies canceled, and insurers have rewritten
coverage to exclude most water-related damage.</TE>
<TE>   The changes have been so sudden and severe that Gov. Rick Perry
ordered the state's attorney general last week to investigate the
business practices of Farmers, State Farm and Allstate, saying the
insurance market in Texas had suffered a "breakdown."</TE>
<TE>   Mold-related claims also are on the rise in California, although
the problem is not yet as severe as in Texas, analysts said.</TE>

<HD>Lorillard Sues Anti-Tobacco Group Over Ads</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lorillard Tobacco Co. sued an anti-tobacco group, saying it violated
a 1998 settlement by running "vilifying" advertisements that
improperly attack tobacco companies.</LD>
<LD>   The Loews Corp. unit claims the American Legacy Foundation has run
a campaign based on personal attacks and offensive statements, not
education. Lorillard filed the suit in Wake County Superior Court in
North Carolina.</LD>
<LD>   With a goal of educating people about the risks of smoking, the
American Legacy Foundation was created as part of a $206-billion
settlement in 1998 between the tobacco industry and 46 states.</LD>
<TE>   Lorillard says the advertisements went beyond education on the
addictiveness, health effects and social costs of smoking. The
organization violated the settlement "by executing a campaign of
offensive statements," the company says.</TE>
<TE>   The organization also made false allegations, including an
advertisement that accuses the company of adding dog urine to its
products, Lorillard's suit claims.</TE>
<TE>   In a preemptive move last week, the American Legacy Foundation
sued in Delaware Chancery Court, asking a judge to rule that its ads
don't improperly attack Lorillard and to declare that the company has
no basis to sue the foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Lorillard had told the foundation Jan. 18 it planned to file a
lawsuit within 30 days. The anti-smoking foundation's suit said it
isn't a party to the 1998 settlement and doesn't have to comply with
it, although the foundation was established as part of the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Loews Corp. shares fell $1.24 to close at $58.58 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Regal Cinemas Inc., the largest movie theater chain, will pay
big-screen film-projection systems maker Imax Corp. $6.5 million to
settle unpaid leases and keep six U.S. theaters that use the screens
from shutting down. Closely held Regal, which won court approval for
its bankruptcy restructuring plan last month, owed Imax money for
system rental and penalties related to canceling orders, Imax
Co-Chief Executive Rich Gelfond said. The settlement is subject to
court approval, Imax said. Imax made an initial claim against Regal
for $11.8 million in November after Regal filed for protection from
creditors. Imax shares rose 12 cents to $3.43 on Nasdaq.</LD>

<HD>TRW Chief Leaves for Honeywell Post</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: The sudden resignation of David M. Cote prompts
a sell-off of the company's shares.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just days after pushing for TRW Inc. to shed its automobile parts
business, chairman and chief executive David M. Cote abruptly
resigned Tuesday to take over the top position at aerospace rival
Honeywell International Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The stunning move shocked investors, who led a late sell-off of
TRW shares. They fell $3.29 cents, or 7%, to close at $41.75 on the
New York Stock Exchange. TRW announced the resignation about an hour
before the close.</LD>
<LD>   But aerospace analyst Paul H. Nisbet of JSA Research Inc. said
investors were overreacting to a personnel move that has no
underlying reason other than Cote getting a better job.</LD>
<TE>   ''I didn't leave TRW without some angst,'' Cote told analysts. ''I
really enjoyed the company. I liked the businesses we were in. But at
the end of the day, the opportunity to run Honeywell was too big to
pass up.''</TE>
<TE>   Honeywell, a Morristown, N.J., maker of aircraft components and
power generators, has been looking for a chairman and chief executive
to replace Lawrence Bossidy, who returned to the company on an
interim basis last summer after it failed to get European approval to
merge with General Electric Co.</TE>
<TE>   Both Bossidy, 66, and Cote, 49, are former GE executives, and Cote
was once considered a potential successor to GE's longtime and
now-retired chairman, Jack Welch.</TE>
<TE>   In Cote, Honeywell will get a chief executive who has two years of
experience running a company with similar lines of business.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the resignation appears to have caught TRW off guard as its
directors assured analysts that there were no financial problems and
that the company was still on track to meet its earnings projections
for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street has been leery of any sudden changes in management
since the Enron Corp. scandal erupted after the resignation of one of
its top executives last fall.</TE>
<TE>   The move also came days after the Wall Street Journal reported
that Cote was pushing to have TRW divest its automotive business and
concentrate on aerospace and defense-related operations. TRW
generates about two-thirds of its revenue from the automobile
business, but earnings have been dropping while prospects for
aerospace earnings have climbed with the possibility of a major
defense buildup. The sudden resignation fueled speculation that Cote
left after a disagreement with the board over the firm's direction.</TE>
<TE>   There was more intrigue Tuesday as a former TRW executive who was
scheduled to speak at a defense industry conference in Washington did
not appear. That executive, Philip A. Odeen, was later named to head
a three-person chief executive office.</TE>

<HD>Wal-Mart Profit Up 9.2% as Sales Rise</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 9.2%
as the retailer sold more groceries and attracted customers from
Kmart Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $2.19 billion, or 49 cents a share, and sales
in the quarter ended Jan. 31 rose 14% to $64.2 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart offered more discounts in the quarter to fend off Kmart,
which cut prices on thousands of goods in an unsuccessful attempt to
win shoppers before seeking bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<TE>   Although the moves helped boost sales, profit margins narrowed at
Wal-Mart's main unit, which includes its grocery stores, Chief
Financial Officer Thomas Schoewe said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call raised their
fourth-quarter profit forecast by 1 cent to 49 cents after Wal-Mart
said this month that higher-than-expected sales would help it exceed
estimates. The company Tuesday raised its forecast for this year's
earnings to $1.74 to $1.76 a share, in line with analysts'
projections.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart fell 74 cents to close
at $54.29 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Prices are expected to return to "more normal levels" this year,
Schoewe said. Wal-Mart forecast first-quarter profit of 35 cents to
36 cents a share, on a 5% to 7% increase in revenue. Analysts had
estimated earnings of 35 cents, First Call said.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart's sales at stores open at least a year rose 6.9% last
quarter. Annual revenue reached $217.8 billion, making Wal-Mart the
world's biggest company by sales.</TE>

<HD>Environmentalists Sue to Block UC Merced</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three environmental groups based in the San Joaquin Valley filed suit
against the University of California campus planned for Merced County
and others Tuesday, seeking to stop or slow the construction of a new
UC campus near Merced.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, the university's regents approved the project's final
environmental impact report and plans for its central facilities,
setting the stage for a groundbreaking in May.</LD>
<LD>   Environmental activists warned then that they would file suit to
try to block construction. They have accused university officials of
piecemeal planning and failing to adequately address the
environmental effects of the project.</LD>
<TE>   In the suit, filed in Merced County Superior Court, three
groups--the San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center, Protect Our
Water and Central Valley Safe Environment Network--ask for an
injunction against all activity related to the project, until the
university is found to be in compliance with applicable environmental
laws. It also asks for all approvals so far to be set aside. "We
believe they've violated the Environmental Quality Act and are trying
to get them to comply," said Steve Burke, spokesman for Modesto-based
Protect Our Water.</TE>
<TE>   UC Merced spokesman James Grant said the university had been
diligent in complying with all applicable laws.</TE>
<TE>   Grant said university officials are confident their plans will
withstand the legal challenge.</TE>

suit against the University of California campus planned for Merced
County. In fact, they sued the University of California, Merced County

<HD>Personal, Business Bankruptcy Filings Soar</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Debt-laden consumers and businesses filed for bankruptcy at a record
clip last year, leading to a 19% hike in total bankruptcy filings,
according to a report released Tuesday. And analysts believe filings
may hit even higher levels in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   The increased levels of spending and debt racked up during the
1990s by consumers and businesses, combined with the decrease in
personal savings and the recession that began last year "created
something of a 'perfect storm' from a financial standpoint," said
Jack Williams, professor of bankruptcy law at Georgia State
University College of Law.</LD>
<LD>   "Any combination of those would have increased bankruptcy filings,
but when they all came together, it caused bankruptcies to rise at a
tremendous rate," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Compared with 2000, total bankruptcy filings increased 19% last
year to 1.49 million, surpassing the previous high of 1.44 million
set in 1998, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S.
courts. Personal bankruptcies rose 19% to 1.45 million, while
business bankruptcy filings rose 13% to 40,099.</TE>
<TE>   The corporate bankruptcies were notable not just for their number,
but also for their size, Williams said. Ten Fortune 500 companies and
22 Fortune 1,000 companies filed for protection from their creditors
in 2001, Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go behind the numbers, not only do you see big
increases, but we see a significant change in the profile of the
companies," he said. "It's not just Joe's Hardware."</TE>
<TE>   When big companies file for bankruptcy there's a ripple effect
felt by smaller companies that provide supplies and services to the
company, as well as by the corporation's employees. However, that
ripple effect is not immediate, Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, consumers use up their savings, sell assets and borrow
from relatives and friends for six to nine months before they finally
succumb to bankruptcy, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   Because the ripple effects of relatively recent filings by big
companies such as Enron Corp. and Kmart Corp. haven't been felt yet,
many experts believe the bankruptcy rise is far from over.</TE>
<TE>   A January survey of bankruptcy attorneys found that 94% of those
surveyed believed that bankruptcies would continue to rise this year,
said Samuel J. Gerdano, executive director of the American Bankruptcy
Institute in Alexandria, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Bankruptcy Court filings are likely to increase even though the
economy has shown some signs of life recently.</TE>
<TE>   "Bankruptcies are a lagging economic indicator. They don't tell
you what's coming. They tell you what household debt burdens or the
economy were like a year ago," Gerdano said.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers usually pay off debt during a recession, but that's not
happening today--another bad sign for the future, said Paul Kasriel,
chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Debt as a percentage of assets and as a percentage of income is at
post-war highs, Kasriel said.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve's yearlong campaign of interest rate cuts has
encouraged consumers to continue spending and accumulating debt, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some vulnerabilities out there," Kasriel said. "The
high debt levels leave the door open for a double-dip recession, when
the Fed does start to tighten the money supply again."</TE>
<TE>   Experts had been predicting a record year for bankruptcy filings
in 2001, in part because of efforts in Congress to tighten U.S.
bankruptcy laws, which likely spurred some debtors to make preemptive
filings.</TE>
<TE>   Legislative efforts to toughen the standards for bankruptcy
filings are currently stalled.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Hit by More Accounting Concerns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks tumbled Tuesday as investors returned from the long weekend
with new concerns about the accuracy of corporate accounting and the
health of the telecom industry.</LD>
<LD>   The Nasdaq composite index dropped 54.59 points, or 3%, to
1,750.61, its lowest close since Nov. 2. The technology- and
telecom-heavy index's ninth losing session in the last 12 widened its
year-to-date loss to more than 10%.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 157.90 points, or 1.6%,
to 9,745.14, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slid 1.9%, although both
blue-chip indexes remained above their recent lows of two weeks ago.</LD>
<TE>   "After the Enron crisis, we're seeing a lot of guilt by
association," said Fritz Reynolds, manager of San Francisco-based
Reynolds Blue Chip Growth Fund. "People wonder who's hiding what, and
now every company is suspect. Now it seems to be IBM's turn."</TE>
<TE>   IBM dropped $3.35 to $99.54, its lowest price since Oct. 11, even
though the computer giant pledged to provide more details about its
accounting in response to investor concerns. The stock was clipped
Friday after a published report questioned whether the company was
completely forthcoming in reporting the sources of its fourth-quarter
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the cash-strapped telecom sector continued to slump.
Nextel Communications sank $1.31 to a record low of $3.55 after
Barron's magazine said the heavily indebted wireless network operator
may not be able to find a suitable merger partner.</TE>
<TE>   Among other wireless shares, Sprint PCS slid 52 cents to $8.75,
Western Wireless lost 49 cents to $9.04, and Rural Cellular slumped
$1.35 to $4.75.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the telecom sector, Qwest Communications fell 29 cents to
$7.27, WorldCom Group eased 25 cents to $6.48, and Lucent
Technologies dipped 12 cents to $5.29.</TE>
<TE>   Losers topped winners 25 to 10 on Nasdaq and 2 to 1 on the New
York Stock Exchange, though trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Action in foreign markets set a poor tone for Wall Street. Japan's
Nikkei-225 index tumbled 2.4%. Some analysts said there was
disappointment that President Bush, on a visit to Japan, didn't push
for greater economic reforms.</TE>
<TE>   European markets also were weak. Bloomberg's index of 500
blue-chip European stocks slid 1.9%.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. market surged in the fourth quarter, anticipating an
economic recovery this year. Recent data have pointed to a
stabilizing economy. But because of "Enronitis" jitters, a renewed
rally in the market may have to wait for clearer signs that business
activity, and corporate earnings, are reviving, Reynolds said.</TE>
<TE>   Although broad market indexes have slumped in the last six weeks,
the pullback so far has been fairly normal in the context of the
rally between Sept. 21 and Jan. 4, according to so-called technical
analysts, who scrutinize market chart patterns.</TE>
<TE>   A 50% "retracement" of the rally would be typical as investors
take profits, analysts say. So far, the S&amp;P 500 has given back about
43% of the points gained in the rally. The Nasdaq composite has given
back about 49% of its rally.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow has yet to give back even one-third of its post-Sept. 21
rally.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of retracing is normal, especially after such a strong
rally," said Bill Ryder, quantitative strategist at First Union
Securities in Richmond, Va.</TE>
<TE>   But if the S&amp;P were to retrace more than 50%, to 1,050, "That
would be our line in the sand," Ryder said. "We would advise our
risk-averse clients to become a little more cautious."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas McManus, equity strategist at Banc of America Securities in
New York, worries that key indexes could "retest" their September
lows sooner rather than later.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite would have to fall 19% to hit its three-year
low of 1,423 reached on Sept. 21, but that kind of move can happen
quickly in the Nasdaq market: The index sank 25% in one week during
its April 2000 tailspin, McManus noted.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Rejects Unocal Patent on Gas Formula</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Unocal Corp. patent for cleaner gasoline was rejected in a
preliminary review by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office after
protests from refiners such as ChevronTexaco Corp. that face millions
in license fees.</LD>
<LD>   Unocal claimed to have invented a type of gasoline blend, dubbed
'393.</LD>
<LD>   The formula easily could have been developed by reading a 1984
report on gasoline standards written by the Society of Automotive
Engineers, the patent office said in a Jan. 31 "non-final rejection"
that followed a preliminary review.</LD>
<TE>   The patent office determined that Unocal "did not invent anything
new or novel" in the gasoline blend, Valero Energy Corp. said. Unocal
accused San Antonio-based Valero last month of infringing its fuel
patents.</TE>
<TE>   A Unocal spokesman confirmed the initial rejection in the
government's review and said that Unocal expects that its patent
"will be supported and borne out by the very documents that the other
parties are using to support their argument."</TE>
<TE>   On the NYSE, Unocal fell 46 cents to $34.91, Valero fell 94 cents
to $44.06, and ChevronTexaco's fell 70 cents to $81.65.</TE>

<LD>PNC Financial Services Group said it reduced 2001 earnings by an
additional $35 million after discovering the bank incorrectly
accounted for the sale of its mortgage banking business.</LD>
<LD>   The Pittsburgh company, which in January was forced by the Federal
Reserve to cut 2001 net income by $155 million, said an entry for the
sale of its $605-million residential mortgage unit to Washington
Mutual Inc. was accounted for as retained earnings instead of
discontinued operations.</LD>
<LD>   The bookkeeping error was found during its year-end review, the

discount rate of 1.73%, up from 1.715% last week. An additional $14
billion in six-month bills was sold at 1.83%, up from 1.81%.</LD>
<LD>   The three-month rate was the highest since Feb. 4, when the bills
sold for 1.735%. The six-month rate was the highest since Dec. 26,
when the rate was 1.85%.</LD>
<LD>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.76% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,956.30, and 1.872% for a six-month bill selling for $9,907.50.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
on one-year constant-maturity bills, the most popular index for
making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, rose to 2.24% last week
from 2.19% the previous week.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mylan Laboratories Inc. said a federal judge ruled that the
generic-drug maker doesn't infringe rival Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s
patent for the anti-anxiety drug, BuSpar.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge John Koeltl also denied Bristol-Myers' motion
to dismiss Mylan's antitrust claims, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-nine state attorneys, Mylan and Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc.
sued Bristol-Myers, accusing the largest cancer drug maker of
thwarting competition by using a compound related to BuSpar to delay
generic competition.</LD>
<TE>   In turn, Bristol-Myers sued Mylan and Watson for patent
infringement.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at New York-based Bristol-Myers, which had $709 million
in BuSpar sales in 2002, could not be reached for comment after
hours.</TE>

<HD>Possible Gold Sell-Off Sinks Futures Prices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gold futures prices Tuesday suffered their biggest drop in eight
months after the head of Germany's central bank said the
second-largest holder of the metal might sell some of its reserves.</LD>
<LD>   The Bundesbank may slowly sell some gold and reinvest the proceeds
in income-producing assets such as bonds, President Ernst Welteke
said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. He didn't say whether the
sales would be in conjunction with a September 1999 agreement by the
Bundesbank and 14 other central banks to limit such sales over the
following five years.</LD>
<LD>   Welteke's comment "was responsible for most of the selling"
Tuesday, said Jim Steel, director of commodity research at Refco Inc.
Investors were surprised, he said, because "the Bundesbank is
notoriously tight-lipped on these things."</LD>
<TE>   Near-term gold futures in New York sank $5.20 to $293.20 an ounce.
Gold futures had rallied to $303.50 on Feb. 8--a two-year high--as
some nervous investors turned to the metal amid the stock market's
latest slide. Gold began the year at $279.</TE>
<TE>   "We have significant gold reserves," Welteke said. "I could
imagine that we slowly sell some of this gold and reinvest the
revenue in assets that pay interest."</TE>
<TE>   Gold slumped through the late 1990s in part because many central
banks were selling reserves. Fifteen European central banks agreed in
September 1999 to limit sales over the following five years. That
helped halt gold's decline after prices hit 20-year lows.</TE>

<HD>Study Urges Deferring MTBE Phaseout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California should defer its scheduled phaseout of the clean-gasoline
additive MTBE until 2005 if it wants to avoid fuel shortages and
price spikes, according to a study commissioned by the California
Energy Commission.</LD>
<LD>   If the phaseout continues as scheduled for Dec. 31, "it will
result in a supply shortfall of 5% to 10% for the California gasoline
pool as a whole," said the study by consulting group Stillwater
Associates.</LD>
<LD>   That would boost prices as high as $3 a gallon, the study said.</LD>
<TE>   Although MTBE has succeeded in helping fuel burn more cleanly, it
has been dogged by findings that it is contaminating ground water and
by studies suggesting it is a carcinogen.</TE>

<LD>AES Corp. plans to sell as much as $1.5 billion in assets and trim
spending by 41% as the United States electricity producer tries to
avoid a cash crunch after losses in Latin America.</LD>
<LD>   AES wants to sell an Illinois utility, a Dominican Republic power
plant and a minority stake in Ipalco, an Indiana utility, company
executives said. AES will cut spending by $490million to $710million,
and Chief Executive Dennis Bakke will sell 7million AES shares to
repay a $36-million personal loan.</LD>
<LD>   AES is shedding assets at a time when energy companies such as
Williams Co. and Calpine Corp. have offered billions of dollars of
power plants, pipelines and utilities for sale to improve their
balance sheets.</LD>
<TE>   AES, which produces electricity in 32 countries, also will
withdraw from trading in spot markets such as New York, California
and Britain because of higher risk from wide price swings. AES will
shut plants, sell them or arrange to sell power under long-term
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AES, which is based in Arlington, Va., fell $2.25 to
close at $4.75 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Spending Cap Removed in 2nd Council District</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Limits on campaign spending were lifted in the contest for Los
Angeles City Council on Tuesday, leading to predictions that total
spending in the 2nd District race could top $800,000 by the March 5
election.</LD>
<LD>   The cap was lifted after the leader of an Indian tribe that
operates a casino spent $20,000 to send a letter to voters in the
east San Fernando Valley, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Barbara Lyons, vice chairwoman of the tribal council for the Agua
Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians in Palm Springs, wrote the letter
supporting Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama City). The letter
was paid for by Lyons, said Judy Simon, her secretary.</LD>
<TE>   Under city law, campaign spending caps can be exceeded when
outside contributors spend more than $50,000 on behalf of candidates.</TE>
<TE>   With total independent expenditures in the race exceeding that
sum, both Cardenas and his opponent, Wendy Greuel, will now be
legally entitled to spend more than the $275,000 cap.</TE>
<TE>   With the cap lifted, one Cardenas advisor predicted the two
candidates may spend as much as $400,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel spent more than $450,000 in the primary compared with more
than $312,000 for Cardenas.</TE>
<TE>   The United Firefighters of Los Angeles reported spending $19,800
on mailings supporting Cardenas, who also benefited from $3,630 in
mailings from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees, AFL-CIO.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel Outdoor, a billboard company, has spent $41,500 on
billboards supporting Cardenas and Greuel.</TE>

<HD>Valley Home Sales Off to a Fast Start</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Brokers report the best January since 1989 in
terms of units sold. The median price for a single-family house
jumped 19% over last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite limited availability, more single-family homes were sold in
the San Fernando Valley last month than in any January since 1989,
real estate specialists said.</LD>
<LD>   A total of 903 homes were sold during the month, representing a
32% jump from last year, according to the Southland Regional Assn. of
Realtors. In January 1989, the best January on record, 1,057 homes
sold, according to the association.</LD>
<LD>   Although Valley housing is in high demand, existing homes or
vacant lots on which to build are scarce, said Jim Link, executive
vice president of the association.</LD>
<TE>   "That's true in the Valley," Link said, "but quite honestly,
that's true in surrounding areas as well."</TE>
<TE>   The inventory of single-family homes and condominiums continued to
shrink last month. With 3,116 properties listed for sale, it was down
26% from a year ago, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer homes create higher demand and higher selling prices, said
Olga Moretti, president of the association.</TE>
<TE>   The median single-family home resale price--the price at which
half the homes sold for more and half for less--was $279,000, 19%
higher than in January 2001. The condominium median resale price rose
to a record $175,000, up 22% from January 2001. The price beat the
previous high of $160,000 set last October.</TE>
<TE>   "As the median price goes up, people are having trouble getting
into the housing market," Moretti said. "The condo market is picking
up because that is a way of getting in."</TE>
<TE>   In the Santa Clarita Valley, single-family home sales hit record
highs, with a 30% increase compared to a year ago. Condominium sales
were up 12%. A spate of new housing developments has heated up the
market there, Link said.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation there is that the new construction helps feed the
market for resales," Link said. "People go up there to look for homes
in new tracts and find their dollar buys a little more in a resale."</TE>
<TE>   Only 671 Santa Clarita properties were listed for sale last month,
down 40% from a year ago. The median resale price of homes last month
was $279,000, up 14% from a year ago. The median resale price of
condos in January set a high of $167,900, a 14% jump from a year ago.</TE>

<HD>Wal-Mart Profit Rises 9.2%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 9.2%
as the retailer sold more groceries and attracted customers from
Kmart Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $2.19 billion, or 49 cents a share, and sales
in the quarter ended Jan. 31 rose 14% to $64.2 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Wal-Mart offered more discounts in the quarter to fend off Kmart,
which cut prices on thousands of goods in an unsuccessful attempt to
win shoppers before seeking bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<TE>   Although the moves helped boost sales, profit margins narrowed at
Wal-Mart's main unit, which includes its grocery stores, Chief
Financial Officer Thomas Schoewe said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call raised their
fourth-quarter profit forecast by 1 cent to 49 cents after Wal-Mart
said this month that higher-than-expected sales would help it exceed
estimates.</TE>
<TE>   The company Tuesday raised its forecast for this year's earnings
to $1.74 to $1.76 a share, which is in line with analysts'
projections.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart fell 74 cents to close
at $54.29 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Prices are expected to return to "more normal levels" this year,
Schoewe said. Wal-Mart forecast first-quarter profit of 35 cents to
36 cents a share, on a 5% to 7% increase in revenue. Annual revenue
reached $217.8 billion, making Wal-Mart the world's biggest company
by sales.</TE>
<TE>   In other earnings reports:</TE>
<TE>   * Anaheim-based New Horizons Worldwide Inc., which owns and
franchises New Horizons Computer Learning Centers, said a
fourth-quarter net loss of $304,000, or 3 cents a share, contrasted
with net income of $2.3 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue declined 3% to $35 million.</TE>
<TE>   *  MTI Technology Corp., an Anaheim provider of data storage
products, reported a third-quarter net loss of $9.6 million, or 30
cents a share, compared with a net loss of $5 million, or 15 cents a
share, a year ago. Revenue declined 29% to $29.8 million. In the
latest quarter, MTI recorded a $6-million loss on equity in its
Caldera Systems Inc. affiliate, compared to a $1.1-million loss in
the third quarter a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   * Endocare Inc., an Irvine medical devices company, said its net
loss for the fourth quarter narrowed to $260,000, or 1 cent a share,
from $3.2 million, or 23 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose to a
record $5.2 million from $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Irvine-based Trimedyne Inc., a manufacturer of surgical lasers
and disposable and reusable fiber-optic devices, posted a
fourth-quarter net loss of $1 million, or 8 cents a share, compared
with a net loss of $1.9 million, or 16 cents a share, for the same
period a year earlier. Revenue rose 82% to $2 million.</TE>

<HD>County Employees Elect to Volunteer for Polling Places</HD>
<DH>Balloting: Hundreds sign up for March 5 primary to help
relieve a growing shortage of precinct workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gabriel Esquivel usually sits behind a desk monitoring financial
information for Orange County. But on election day, Esquivel will
join hundreds of other county employees who have volunteered as poll
workers.</LD>
<LD>   The goal is to help change the county's reputation for chronic
election problems. A plus for Esquivel, 38, is that he speaks Spanish
and is willing to provide information in either English or Spanish
during the March 5 primary.</LD>
<LD>   "I offered myself as a volunteer," Esquivel said. "And I intend to
do whatever they want me to do."</LD>
<TE>   That includes working long hours. Program organizers at a training
session Tuesday said county workers are expected to be at the polls
by 6:30 a.m. with a positive attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to instill in the volunteers the importance of the
vote, plus to instill a positive attitude," said Steve Rodermund,
chief deputy in the county's Registration and Elections Department.
"We don't want anyone saying to potential voters who may be at the
wrong polling place, 'You don't get to vote' or 'Go away.'"</TE>
<TE>   Under the program, employee volunteers will draw their normal
salaries plus a $50 stipend for helping to supplement the thinning
ranks of precinct workers.</TE>
<TE>   Election officials say the current pool of volunteers is aging,
and younger people are not stepping forward.</TE>
<TE>   The program, which will cost $119,000, is the latest in a series
of changes for the elections department. In September, the county
agreed to a $1.1-million budget boost to hire 13 additional employees
and bolster a department criticized for problems during the Nov. 7,
2000, general election.</TE>
<TE>   The county came under fire for problems that included 40,000
sample ballots being shipped late to Spanish- and Vietnamese-speaking
voters, the misidentification of a Libertarian candidate as a
Republican on the ballot and a precinct that opened without any
ballots.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Spanish-speaking voters in Santa Ana complained to
community leaders that they were treated poorly or given misleading
information.</TE>
<TE>   For the March primary, the county is seeking not only Spanish
speakers but also Vietnamese employees to work in Vietnamese
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   With the election less than two weeks away, about 260 county
employees have volunteered so far. Rodermund said the department's
hope is to recruit 1,700 volunteers by November.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Burton, the county's chief financial officer, was among the
first to sign up.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a personal responsibility," Burton said. "When the
word went out that county employees were needed, I put my name
down."About 7,000 volunteers work at the county's 1,716 precincts on
a typical election day.</TE>
<TE>   During Tuesday's training session, organizers handed out copies of
a pamphlet on ballot information, a guide for working the polls and
tips on serving voters.</TE>
<TE>   One of the themes emphasized by Rodermund, who led the session,
was keeping personal sentiments in check and treating voters with
dignity.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you have 7,000 people out there, you have the potential
of someone allowing their biases to surface," Rodermund said. "The
last thing we want is a confrontation at the polling place."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I had an especially fretful weekend. If you knew me, you'd know
that's saying something.</LD>
<LD>   From the time I left the office Friday night until I dropped in
Monday afternoon, one thought haunted me: What if my office mates hit
the lottery?</LD>
<LD>   Could I possibly handle it if people I've known for years hit the
big one and split $193 million? Could I fake the happiness that would
be required as they danced deliriously around the office?</LD>
<TE>   I'd certainly try, but it's doubtful I'd pull it off.</TE>
<TE>   More likely, I'd have to go sit in my car. Or take a long drive.
Possibly, toward a cliff.</TE>
<TE>   Small of me, I know. But isn't that exactly how you'd feel? Would
you really want your next-door neighbor cashing in millions of
dollars and smiling all the time? Of course, you wouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding my anxiety was that I had every chance to join my
colleagues in their quest. Early Friday evening, my friend Jerry was
still circulating in the office, squeezing $5 from another co-worker
so he could buy more tickets.</TE>
<TE>   I could have chipped in. But, geez, five bucks?</TE>
<TE>   OK, I'm small and cheap.</TE>
<TE>   It's always bugged me that the lottery is designed for one winner.
I know they have multiple winners, like this week, but wouldn't it be
better to guarantee that outcome if the kitty got over a certain
amount--say about $50 million?</TE>
<TE>   "The public told us they wanted bigger jackpots," says lottery
spokeswoman Cathy Doyle Johnston.</TE>
<TE>   I tell her of my fear that friends might win. "By nature, I'm an
optimistic, positive person," she says. "I can walk away from a slot
machine and if someone walks up right behind me and wins $1,000, I
think, 'They must have needed it more than I do.'"</TE>
<TE>   Well, good for her.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Jerry left Friday night, he'd lined up more than 40
contributors. With $5 from each, that meant he'd be buying more than
200 tickets. I panicked; that sounded like a lot. I would have rested
easier had I known the number of tickets sold statewide would be
around 104 million and the odds of winning the big prize were 1 in 41
million.</TE>
<TE>   Still, I visualized Jerry sitting at home Saturday night, eating
some popcorn, awaiting the results and then discovering he had struck
gold. I pictured some leaping and whooping and a hat flying into the
air.</TE>
<TE>   It was more than I could stand.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime Sunday, I heard the news that three winning tickets had
been sold. That worried me because it increased the chances my
friends had hit. Then, a report said one of the winning tickets had
been sold at a convenience store in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Orange?</TE>
<TE>   Oh, no. Jerry lives in Anaheim. What if he'd had a lucky feeling,
drifted over to Orange and bought all the tickets there? I know for a
fact that the man frequents convenience stores.</TE>
<TE>   I waited at home Sunday for the phone to ring, but it didn't, and
that buoyed me. Surely, I thought, someone would have called to say
they'd won--if only to begin rubbing it in, because that's what I
would do.</TE>
<TE>   As of this moment--while I'm confessing to my pettiness--it's
Tuesday afternoon and the Orange winner hasn't been identified.</TE>
<TE>   But, whoever it is, thank God it's not Jerry and my friends.</TE>
<TE>   I know that, because I came in to the office for a while on Monday
afternoon. It was a holiday, so not many people were around.</TE>
<TE>   "Please tell me Jerry didn't have one of the winners," I said to a
colleague.</TE>
<TE>   "He's working the night shift tonight," my friend replied. "That
tells you all you need to know."</TE>
<TE>   Just like that, the cloud lifted.</TE>
<TE>   A calm settled over me, and I appreciated my wonderful and kind
office mates with greater passion than before, knowing none of them
was an instant millionaire.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's wrong, but the thought of Jerry coming in and working
the night shift, instead of being in some Porsche dealership pricing
new convertibles, filled me with my first real joy of the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   I couldn't wait until Jerry showed up for work, so I could tell
him how sorry I was that he hadn't won.</TE>

<HD>Man Gets 6 Years in Highway Fatality</HD>
<DH>Courts: The Fillmore resident expresses remorse for killing
a woman and injuring her son last summer.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Fillmore man was sentenced Tuesday to six years in prison for
driving drunk and killing a woman who was headed to her son's wedding
rehearsal last July.</LD>
<LD>   After hearing emotional pleas for tough punishment from the
victim's family, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Bruce Clark
sentenced a tearful Sergio Casas before a packed courtroom.</LD>
<LD>   Casas, 36, had been eligible for a sentence ranging from probation
to 11 years.</LD>
<TE>   "This is one of those cases where a good person has done a
terrible wrong to a very, very nice family," said Louis (Chuck)
Samonsky, Casas' attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Audry Rohn argued in court that the former
Caltrans maintenance worker deserved a decade behind bars for making
"terrible decisions" that devastated a family and destroyed a sacred
family event.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought this was a prison case," Rohn said outside
court. "He took a life."</TE>
<TE>   Casas Had Pleaded Guilty to Charges</TE>
<TE>   Casas, clad in a white dress shirt and dark slacks, cried
intermittently during the 45-minute proceeding. He had been free on
bail since his arrest last summer but was taken into custody after
sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Casas had pleaded guilty to vehicular manslaughter while drunk and
driving under the influence of cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing will be held to determine restitution, which prosecutors
have said could top more than $100,000. The sum includes medical
costs for a surviving victim and the wedding, which was canceled.</TE>
<TE>   According to authorities, Casas had cocaine and twice the legal
limit of alcohol in his system when he struck Robin
McDonald-Gwaltney, 43, of Oxnard during the early evening on July 26.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald-Gwaltney had stopped on the shoulder of California 126
near Santa Paula to pick up her 20-year-old son, Jason McMillan,
whose car had broken down, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   'More Pain Than I've Ever Been Through'</TE>
<TE>   They had been headed to McMillan's wedding rehearsal at the Church
of Angels in Santa Paula. McDonald-Gwaltney was hit while carrying
her son's tuxedo from his car to hers.</TE>
<TE>   McMillan was pinned between his car and his mother's and suffered
a crushed leg and a broken pelvis. On Tuesday, he hobbled to the dais
to address the judge.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been through more pain than I've ever been through in my
entire life," McMillan said. He continues to undergo physical therapy
for his injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Crystal McMillan, an aunt, told the judge that the day of the
crash started as a joyous occasion but turned horrendous. The
family's pastor urged the judge to mete out a sentence that didn't
trivialize the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Casas' ex-wife, Los Angeles Police Officer Korina Kozub-Casas,
testified that her ex-husband had been distraught since the crash.
She said she had believed that drunk drivers were "scum" but doesn't
think that of her ex-husband.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to put into words the amount of remorse Sergio has,"
Kozub-Casas said.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides of the case acknowledged the defendant's
remorsefulness, as Casas did in a letter that was read in court by
his attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm truly sorry for what I've done to you and your family," Casas
wrote Jason McMillan. "Why did I make such a decision [to drive
drunk]?"</TE>
<TE>   Samonsky said his client had no record before the crash and had
not drunk alcohol in two years. Since his arrest, Samonsky said,
Casas has spoken about the dangers of drinking and driving to several
community groups.</TE>

<HD>Cleanup Plan for Oxnard Plant Rejected</HD>
<DH>Environment: Agency says the proposal to halt discharges at
the beachfront recycler needs strengthening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A years-long attempt by water-quality regulators to crack down on a
beachfront metal recycler in Oxnard stalled again Tuesday, as members
of a regional board rejected a cleanup plan considered too weak.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board
directed staff members to spend the next nine days in further
negotiations with attorneys for Halaco Engineering Inc. and
environmental groups to strengthen the proposal, which aims to halt
daily discharges of a soupy waste the smelting plant produces.</LD>
<LD>   If no agreement can be reached, board members agreed to launch a
formal hearing process that could give them the enforcement tools
needed to order cleanup of the waste pools and a 40-foot-high slag
heap on Halaco's property. The slag heap has been blamed for two
decades of contamination of nearby wetlands, ground water and the
ocean.</LD>
<TE>   "We are trying to keep the parties' feet to the fire," said board
member David Nahai after an eight-hour hearing on the matter Tuesday.
"Now they have every incentive in the world to address these issues
in a fair and good-faith manner."</TE>
<TE>   Local environmentalists, who also are fighting Halaco in state and
federal courts, applauded the board's action. About 25 people came to
the meeting to criticize the smelting plant, which has occupied the
shores of south Oxnard since 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Watchdog Group Hails Water Board's Decision</TE>
<TE>   "They clearly and decisively said what was given to them was no
good and that they want something better," said Drew Bohan, executive
director of Santa Barbara ChannelKeeper, an environmental watchdog
group.</TE>
<TE>   "The board did its job today, and the community should be proud."</TE>
<TE>   Halaco's regulatory problems heated up two years ago when the
water board found evidence that ammonia and other toxic chemicals
were seeping from the company's property into the adjacent Ormond
wetlands, potentially harming migratory birds and other wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Halaco officials have always maintained the plant has never
violated its permit or environmental laws, and have vigorously fought
attempts to tighten restrictions on its waste-water discharges.</TE>
<TE>   When the regional board was set to adopt a new, tougher permit in
November, Halaco unveiled a plan to install a $100,000 filtration
system it promised would allay concerns. The system would remove
water from the slurry generated by its metal-recycling operation,
producing cleaner waste water along with solid material that could be
sold for uses such as fertilizer additives.</TE>
<TE>   The board was asked Tuesday to approve a so-called "cease and
desist" order that embraced that plan and outlined a timeline for
Halaco to convert to the new system, stop the waste-water discharge
and begin reducing its slag heap.</TE>
<TE>   Halaco's attorney, Arthur Fine, said it was a good proposal that
resulted from countless hours of hard work on the part of his company
and the regional board's attorneys and experts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed after all that effort that it was not accepted,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Halaco critics and water quality board members said the
document had limited enforcement powers and was fraught with
loopholes "big enough for a truck to drive through."</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, they argued it provided too much leeway for a company
they say has a shoddy track record when it comes to following through
on its promises.</TE>
<TE>   Firm's Record With Agencies Assailed</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Supervisor Kathy Long told the board Halaco has
defied several regulatory agencies, showing it is not a good
corporate citizen.</TE>
<TE>   The company has been at the center of a number of legal tangles
related to air and water quality issues in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it difficult to trust them," Long said.</TE>

<HD>Trial Ordered for 2 Teens in Fatal Beating</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Officer testifies that both Timothy Becker and
Robert Coffman admitted taking part in the June assault of a
transient.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Ventura County teenagers were ordered Tuesday to stand trial on
murder and robbery charges in connection with the fatal beating of a
homeless man last summer.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Coffman, 19, of Oak View and Timothy Becker, 18, of Ventura
are among four teens accused of kicking and throwing rocks at
58-year-old James Clark as he lay in a sleeping bag near the mouth of
the Ventura River on June 30.</LD>
<LD>   During a preliminary hearing, Ventura Police Det. Pat Stevens
testified that during separate police interviews, Coffman and Becker
admitted participating in the assault.</LD>
<TE>   The teens told police they stumbled on a "bum" while heading to a
beach party with Rocky Mattley, 14, and Christopher Dunham, 19.</TE>
<TE>   The group took the man's radio and backpack, which held a
container of pennies, Stevens said.</TE>
<TE>   Teens Pelted Man With His Coins, Officer Says</TE>
<TE>   Becker and Coffman told police the teens later went back, pelted
Clark with the coins and began kicking him in the face, arms and
chest.</TE>
<TE>   Becker told Stevens that later that night Dunham and Mattley said
they were "going to go back and mess with the bum some more," he
testified.</TE>
<TE>   "When they came back, they told Tim Becker that they hit Mr. Clark
with some rocks," Stevens testified.</TE>
<TE>   Dunham and Mattley are also facing murder charges. Dunham waived
Tuesday's preliminary hearing and will proceed to trial. Mattley is
being prosecuted in Juvenile Court.</TE>
<TE>   The four teens were arrested last summer within two weeks of the
attack on Clark and have given conflicting statements to police about
who struck which blows.</TE>
<TE>   In arguing the case Tuesday, Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Maeve Fox
told Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ronald Purnell that
prosecutors believe all four teens are liable for murder because they
participated in the attack together.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need to show who struck the fatal blow," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a group of four young men who confronted an utterly
helpless, fragile man."</TE>
<TE>   According to autopsy results, Clark weighed only 123 pounds,
including his clothes and sleeping bag.</TE>
<TE>   Medical Examiner Ronald O'Halloran testified Tuesday that Clark
sustained a fractured skull, a crushed left kidney, a broken rib and
numerous bruises and abrasions over his body.</TE>
<TE>   Homeless Man Died From Multiple Blows</TE>
<TE>   O'Halloran estimated that Clark lived for approximately an hour
after the attack and died as a result of multiple blows.</TE>
<TE>   He was unable to pinpoint which blows came first or whether they
were caused by rocks, boots or other objects.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the murder charge, Coffman was ordered to stand
trial on a charge of attempted murder in connection with a stabbing
at the Ventura beach promenade a day after Clark's death.</TE>
<TE>   Coffman and Becker are scheduled to be arraigned March 5.</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, Clark's nephew, Tom Clark, said he hopes all
the teens will be punished.</TE>
<TE>   "They just picked on a poor, helpless human being," he said.
"Hopefully, they will pay for it."</TE>

<HD>Error Leads to Dismissal of Murder Charges</HD>
<DH>Ruling: Prosecutors are expected to refile the case against
a man accused of killing a Port Hueneme woman in 1993.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In yet another blow to prosecutors' efforts to crack an 8-year-old
homicide, a Ventura County judge Tuesday dismissed charges against
Michael Schultz after finding that the district attorney's office
made an error in refiling the case.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this month, a Santa Barbara County judge set aside an
indictment charging Schultz with murder, rape and related allegations
in the 1993 slaying of a Port Hueneme woman, ruling that the grand
jury was too male-dominated and not reflective of the county's
population.</LD>
<LD>   Schultz, 32, was rearrested after the Feb. 1 decision, and
prosecutors charged him with the same crimes.</LD>
<TE>   But Deputy Public Defenders Steve Lipson and Brian Vogel
challenged the manner in which the district attorney's office brought
the second set of charges, alleging that prosecutors had made a
procedural error.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing Tuesday, Superior Court Judge Art Gutierrez agreed
with the defense and dismissed the case.</TE>
<TE>   While seemingly a minor setback, the ramifications of the ruling
could be significant.</TE>
<TE>   "Arguably, it is a second dismissal," Lipson said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Legally, the prosecution may be barred from bringing charges if a
case has twice been dismissed, Lipson said.</TE>
<TE>   The question remains whether the ruling by Santa Barbara County
Judge Frank Ochoa constituted a dismissal or whether a seldom-used
legal provision allows the district attorney to essentially bring
charges a third time.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Frawley said Schultz, who is
being held without bail, was to be rearrested Tuesday and arraigned
on murder charges today.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Schultz, a Ventura
resident who authorities say raped and strangled Cynthia Burger, 44,
during a home burglary.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities allegedly linked the crime to Schultz using DNA
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Given the potential penalty, Lipson said the defense has been
aggressive in making sure the appropriate legal steps are taken.</TE>
<TE>   "In these types of cases, you make sure they do everything
correctly," he said.</TE>

<HD>Perrodin Seeks to Block Ruling That Ejected Him</HD>
<DH>Compton: The man who lost the mayoralty earlier this month
to Omar Bradley files request for a stay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ousted Compton mayor Eric Perrodin asked an appeals court Tuesday to
suspend a judge's controversial ruling earlier this month that tossed
him from office.</LD>
<LD>   A petition was filed on Perrodin's behalf by election law attorney
Frederic Woocher, who says Superior Court Judge Judith Chirlin
exceeded her authority and abused her discretion in awarding the
mayoralty to Omar Bradley.</LD>
<LD>   "We're requesting a stay because the Superior Court's ruling is
completely unprecedented," Woocher said.</LD>
<TE>   The request for a stay was filed in addition to Perrodin's appeal
of Chirlin's ruling, which was filed Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Court officials said a response from the state's 2nd District
Court of Appeal could come as early as this week.</TE>
<TE>   Chirlin's ruling followed the then-two-term-incumbent Bradley's
defeat June 5 by Perrodin in a stunning upset. Bradley sued, alleging
rampant election fraud.</TE>
<TE>   In her Feb. 8 ruling in that case, Chirlin found evidence of
fraud, but said it was mostly on the part of Leslie Irving, whom
Chirlin removed from her post on the Compton City Council and barred
from holding office in California.</TE>
<TE>   Chirlin also removed Perrodin from office and installed Bradley
after finding Perrodin had unfairly benefited from being listed first
on ballots instead of in the legally required random order, an error
Chirlin attributed to City Clerk Charles Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin's request for a stay contends that he and the citizens of
Compton "will suffer grave and irreparable harm" if Bradley remains
in office.</TE>
<TE>   Among the alleged harms Perrodin cites are nearly $1 million in
claims against the city that were scheduled to be discussed in closed
City Council sessions Tuesday night. The claims include $874,802 in
legal fees and court costs, $43,241 in "salary compensation" for
Bradley for the seven months he was out of office and $38,789 in back
pay for Melanie Andrews, whom Irving defeated.</TE>
<TE>   The council did not consider those claims in closed session.
Instead it voted to place city manager Harold Caldwell, who was named
after Perrodin was elected, on administrative leave with pay and it
named John D. Johnson as interim city manager, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was the city manager during Bradley's administration.</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin said he will eventually win what could be a lengthy
appeal process; his request for a stay says the city "will have a
hard time recovering any of these funds once they are paid to the
claimants."</TE>
<TE>   Compton City Atty. Legrand Clegg said Chirlin's ruling does not
specifically provide for retroactive compensation or call for
Perrodin and Irving to reimburse the city for compensation received
during their terms.</TE>
<TE>   "Absent such an order from Judge Chirlin," Clegg said, "any
authorization of retroactive compensation can only be construed as a
gift of public funds."</TE>
<TE>   Several legal experts expressed surprise at Chirlin's verdict,
including Woocher, whom Perrodin hired after deciding to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Bradley Hertz, who represented Bradley, said the
California Election Code requires that Bradley remain in office
during the appeal process.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want the mayor's office to be a revolving door every
time a court makes a ruling," Hertz said.</TE>

<LD>A Superior Court judge charged with child molestation and possession
of child pornography will face opposition from 11 write-in candidates
in next month's primary election, county officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Only Judge Ronald C. Kline's name will appear on the March 5
ballot, but voters may pencil in one of the write-ins.</LD>
<LD>   Voters who do so must also punch the ballot. In the past week,
four lawyers, including retired Judge Dan C. Dutcher, joined the race
for Kline's seat before Tuesday's deadline to register as an official
write-in candidate. If Kline fails to win more than 50% of votes cast
in his race for judicial office No. 21, there will be a run-off
election in November. Kline has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</LD>

<HD>Delaney Gets Probation for Reckless Driving</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Actress Kim Delaney pleaded no contest Tuesday to a misdemeanor
charge of reckless driving stemming from her arrest last month at her
Malibu home.</LD>
<LD>   Malibu Superior Court Judge Lawrence Mira sentenced Delaney, 40,
to two years' summary probation and a $300 fine, plus other fines. He
also ordered her to undergo safe driving counseling, said Jane
Robison of the district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Delaney's attorney, Steve Sitkoff, entered the plea; she was not
in the courtroom. The "Philly" star and Emmy-winning former co-star
of "NYPD Blue" was arrested Jan. 27 on suspicion of drunk driving.
But prosecutors found insufficient evidence to prove that her erratic
driving was due to alcohol.</LD>
<TE>   Delaney was arrested after a motorist who allegedly saw her
driving erratically followed her home and alerted authorities, police
said. Delaney refused to take a field sobriety test at her home and
at the sheriff's station, police said.</TE>

<LD>A proposed policy would allow Kern County's gay and lesbian employees
to take sick leave when their partners are ill.</LD>
<LD>   Sick leave also could be used in the death of a partner under the
proposed policy, which is expected to be voted on this week by the
Kern County Board of Supervisors. The employee and the partner must
be registered as domestic partners with the state to qualify.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, state lawmakers passed a bill that gave homosexual
partners some of the same rights as married couples, but county
officials said they will consider only the sick leave issue.</LD>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Gershberg Is Happy to Be Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The doctor did not have good news for Howie Gershberg. The cancer had
returned to his intestines and advanced into his lungs. The cancer
was inoperable there, and he should not expect to live beyond one
more year.</LD>
<LD>   That was 18 months ago. And, yes, that is Gershberg, a beloved and
respected minor league pitching coach, walking into the Angel
clubhouse every day to do the job he loves.</LD>
<LD>   "It's great to be back," Gershberg said. "The most important thing
is working. It keeps you in a good frame of mind."</LD>
<TE>   Gershberg, 65, missed spring training last year while undergoing
chemotherapy. To the amazement of his doctor, the treatment
controlled the spread of the cancer, and Gershberg says he feels
fine. "I can go on like this forever if it doesn't spread," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the cancer is not in remission, and he is scheduled for more
tests in April. The Angels--his employers since 1985--have kept him
on their staff and encouraged him to tutor pitchers in spring
training and in the minor leagues as his health allows.</TE>
<TE>   "We all call him the guru," said pitcher Matt Wise. "It's
definitely good to see him here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Fabregas did not sign the largest contract on the team
during the off-season, but the Angels' backup catcher certainly
signed the smartest one. On Nov. 15, 11 days after the World Series
ended and before free agents flooded what would become a buyer's
market, Fabregas signed with the Angels for a guaranteed $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 109 free agents signed through Tuesday, according to
Associated Press, 42 signed minor league contracts, including such
notables as Jose Canseco, Rickey Henderson, Dante Bichette and Mike
Jackson. As Canseco learned last spring when the Angels abruptly
released him, a minor league contract guarantees you nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Fabregas batted .223 with two home runs last season. He directed
agent Scott Boras to get the best deal he could from the Angels,
which turned out to be for the same $500,000 Fabregas made last
season and an additional $250,000 in incentive bonuses. Had he
balked, General Manager Bill Stoneman might have found another
veteran backup in that price range, and Fabregas might well have a
minor league contract somewhere else and a good chance to start the
season in triple-A.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew the guys here wanted me back, and I wanted to be back,"
Fabregas said. "To go and test the market and maybe make a little
more somewhere else, well, the grass is not always greener on the
other side.</TE>
<TE>   "Besides," he said, grinning, "the difference in me going
somewhere else would not be millions."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Ben Weber arrived in camp Tuesday, after a 21-hour drive
from his home in Beaumont, Texas. Weber's locker is next to that of
fellow reliever Dennis Cook, the father of 4-year-old triplets. Weber
and his wife, Marisa, became parents of triplets last week, and Weber
said he would lean on Cook for advice.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe he can give me some pointers," Weber said. "I just hope he
doesn't scare the hell out of me."</TE>
<TE>   The first warning: Be prepared for sleep deprivation. Cook
jokingly suggested Weber might doze off in the bullpen now and then.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll probably have to nudge him to keep him awake," Cook said.</TE>
<GT></GT>

Fabregas, left, probably avoided the dreaded minor league contract
signed by many others.</CP>

<LD>George Steinbrenner has not given up on Darryl Strawberry.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Yankee owner said Tuesday the troubled former
outfielder will be offered a job as a player development coach after
completing court-mandated drug treatment.</LD>
<LD>   "He will join me," Steinbrenner said. "He will come with us. He

<DH>Boys' basketball: Guard lifts St. John Bosco to 73-69
victory over El Dorado after missing twice in regulation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gio St. Amant, Bellflower St. John Bosco High's do-everything guard,
did everything during regulation Tuesday night but put away Placentia
El Dorado.</LD>
<LD>   St. Amant scored 29 points and answered every big El Dorado bucket
with one of his own as the Braves tried to hold off the Golden Hawks'
frantic fourth-quarter rally. With time running down, though, St.
Amant missed a layup and later an off-balance three-pointer that
allowed El Dorado to send the Southern Section Division II-AA
second-round boys' basketball game at Bellflower into overtime.</LD>
<LD>   That's when St. Amant took control, scoring six of the Braves'
eight points during the four-minute extra period to give St. John
Bosco a 73-69 victory that propels them into the quarterfinals
against fourth-seeded Corona Centennial.</LD>
<TE>   "After missing those two shots at the end, I felt I had to redeem
myself," said St. Amant, who finished with a game-high 35 points. "I
couldn't end my season like that."</TE>
<TE>   St. Amant has averaged 36 points during the Braves' three playoff
victories, including a 40-point output against Hemet West Valley in
the first round.</TE>
<TE>   "He's our go-to guy," St. John Bosco Coach Matt Hart said. "He's
been big."</TE>
<TE>   St. Amant hit a mid-range jumper to give the Braves (23-6) a 63-55
lead midway through the fourth quarter and seemingly put the game out
of reach. But El Dorado standout forward David Patten (27 points)
made a basket underneath and a pair of free throws to cut the deficit
to four points.</TE>
<TE>   St. John Bosco's Roy Alugbue took a feed from Kenny Taylor and
scored inside to put the Braves back up by six, but Golden Hawk
guards Dustin Price and Kyle Miller hit back-to-back three-pointers
to tie the game at 65 with 56 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Each team had a possession with two seconds remaining but threw
the ball out of bounds. St. John Bosco got the last shot off when
Robert Reynaga rebounded St. Amant's long miss and attempted a quick
putback. The ball stuck on the rim for about a second before falling
out.</TE>
<TE>   Patten appeared to give El Dorado (23-5) its first lead of the
game on the first possession of overtime when he scored on a drive,
but the Pepperdine-bound player was called for charging. St. Amant
then drove to the basket and made a layup as St. John Bosco took the
lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Hawks, who never led, had a chance to tie the game or
take the lead with six seconds left before Price lost control of the
ball and turned it over after dribbling behind his back. Reynaga was
intentionally fouled and made two free throws to set the final
margin.</TE>
<TE>   St. Amant scored 16 by halftime as the Braves took a 12-point
after having led by as many as 15 in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves built their big lead because Patten was a nonfactor for
all of the first quarter and much of the second. He missed his first
three shots before being benched by Golden Hawk Coach Ryan Mounce.</TE>

North, 70-53, in Friday's quarterfinal at a site to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos trailed, 48-38, at the end of the third quarter, but
despite Rochand Scoby's three-point play and Jones' three baskets and

<LD>Brigham Young-bound quarterback Ben Olson plays basketball just for
fun, and he's had a great time leading Thousand Oaks into the
Division I-A quarterfinals.</LD>
<LD>   Olson scored 17 points and his football teammate Dave Anderson
added 16 for the Lancers (25-3), who defeated Rowland, 60-39, in a
second-round game Tuesday night at Rowland Heights.</LD>
<LD>   Thousand Oaks has won 15 consecutive games behind a smothering
man-to-man defense.</LD>
<TE>   Another football player, Kevin Rex, had nine points and started a
three-point barrage at the end of the third quarter that turned a
seven-point halftime lead into a 20-point margin at the outset of the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We are showing football players can play other sports," Olson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rowland finishes the season 20-8.</TE>

<LD>Now that Jon Gruden has packed his silver-and-black bags and left
Oakland to become coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, observers are
left to wonder who the next Raider coach will be.</LD>
<LD>   Ray Ratto of the San Francisco Chronicle said owner Al Davis isn't
one of those worrying about it.</LD>
<LD>   "Davis made it clear without ever saying so that he thinks there
are Grudens to be found in nearly every Wal-Mart aisle in America,"
Ratto wrote.</LD>
<TE>   Still, there are those bemused by the move, Ratto included.</TE>
<TE>   "None of this could have happened without the help of at least two
parallel universes and a gallon of Old Hair O' the Dog," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: How many of the 17 Formula One races in 2001 were won

<TE>   Wifely duty: While Ronaldo lounges in Brazil during carnival
season recuperating from his latest in a three-year series of
injuries, the family's soccer name is being kept in the spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   Milene Domingues, who married the Inter Milan forward in 1999, is
preparing to debut for the Italian Women's Serie A side Monza.</TE>
<TE>   "She is very good," Monza Coach Raffaele Solimeno told Gazzetta
Dello Sport. "She has speed and is very agile."</TE>
<TE>   Nice to know there's at least one Ronaldo who can still run.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whale watching: Commenting on the eve of Maryland's 87-73 victory
over Duke, the Washington Post's Tony Kornheiser viewed the rivalry
in nautical terms.</TE>
<TE>   "Duke has become Maryland's white whale," he wrote. "I'm always
surprised [Terrapin Coach] Gary Williams doesn't come out of the
tunnel with a harpoon in his hand."</TE>
<TE>   There was no need. The previously No. 1 Blue Devils felt the sting
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leaving him breathless: The San Francisco Chronicle's Scott Ostler
isn't impressed by Giant General Manager Brian Sabean's claim that
Tsuyoshi Shinjo "is going to take your breath away going to get the
ball in center field."</TE>
<TE>   "Big deal," Ostler said. "Walking up the steps to the beer stand
takes my breath away."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Longhorns shorten odds: According to Dan Cook of the San Antonio
Express-News, Texas Coach Mack Brown "just finished signing one of
the greatest crop of high school recruits in the history of
collegiate football.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe the greatest of all time."</TE>
<TE>   Cook pointed out that the Longhorns had signed nine of the
nationally rated top 50 players and seven of the top 10 recruits in
Texas. But there's a downside.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, he wrote, has "put himself on the spot to again finish in
the top 10 this coming season, and he'd better win a national title
in one of the three following years or it will never happen during
his watch in Austin."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jumping to conclusions: Promoter Al Franken, whose 42nd L.A.
Invitational indoor track meet will be staged Saturday at the Sports
Arena, suggests that 1996 Olympic champion high jumper Charles Austin
could meet his match. One of his opponents is the aptly named Nathan
Leeper.</TE>

<LD>An update from sick bay ...</LD>
<LD>   The cast on Lamar Odom's sprained right wrist was removed Monday
and he remained in L.A. to continue rehabilitation exercises as the
team begins a five-game trip tonight against the Heat in Miami.
Odom's wrist and sprained right ankle are expected to sideline him
for at least two more weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Darius Miles suffered a sprained right shoulder Monday when he
charged into Portland's Bonzi Wells and fell heavily to the floor.
His status for tonight's game was termed questionable by the team
Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Elton Brand's injured right ring finger probably won't keep him
from playing tonight. Heck, the Supreme Court probably couldn't keep
Brand off the floor, although he has injuries to his finger, elbow,
knee and shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Corey Maggette continues to limp through games on a sore left
knee. He had 10 points in 36 minutes Monday, occasionally matching up
against Trail Blazer power forward Rasheed Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for us to get well, period," Coach Alvin Gentry
said. "This has been the craziest year for injuries. Last year, we
had almost no injuries until Corey got hurt at the end. This year, we
have not had our whole team out there for one game."</TE>
<TE>   When it was mentioned that despite the injuries the Clippers are
within striking distance of a playoff spot, Gentry said, "As I've
said all along, we have pretty good depth. The guys have been able to
weather it [the injuries] and hang in there."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Miami, 4:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Site--American Airlines Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KXTA (1150) at 6:30.</TE>
<TE>   Records--Clippers 26-28, Heat 21-30.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Heat--1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--Miami is 12-4 since suffering a 34-point loss Jan. 12
against the Phoenix Suns, gaining a measure of respectability after a
poor start. The Clippers defeated the Heat in a Dec. 4 game at
Staples Center that left Miami with a 12-game losing streak and a
2-14 record. Miami is 11-13 against teams with .500 or better
records, but is 10-17 against opponents with less than .500 marks.
The Clippers are 3-10 at Miami.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Black Star Risen: The Alan Page Story"</LD>
<LD>   Where: ESPN, tonight, 7</LD>
<TE>   Even if you're familiar with Alan Page, the Hall of Fame football
player who is now in his 10th year as a Minnesota Supreme Court
justice, you'll still be amazed by all that Page has accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   NFL Films, in this one-hour special that is part of ESPN's
celebration of Black History Month, aptly tells the story.</TE>
<TE>   Page grew up in post-war Canton, Ohio. His father owned a tavern
that was a front for a gambling establishment. His mother died during
the spring of 1959, before Page's freshman year of high school.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Page immersed himself in studies and extracurricular
activities. He was a member of the school band before trying
football. When he did go out for football at Central Catholic High,
he was the only black player on the team.</TE>
<TE>   He went on to Notre Dame, earning All-American honors and playing
on a national championship team as a senior in 1966. He was a
first-round draft pick of the Minnesota Vikings, and in 12 seasons in
Minnesota he made the Pro Bowl nine years in a row. In 1971, he was
the NFL's most valuable player, a rare honor for a defensive lineman.</TE>
<TE>   But Page's prowess on the football field is overshadowed by his
dedication to excelling off the field.</TE>
<TE>   He began attending law school while playing for the Vikings: "For
the first time I was using my head for something other than somewhere
to store my helmet or as a battering ram."</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Page was inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame in his
hometown of Canton. Coincidentally, during his college years Page had
worked for the construction company that built the Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   He selected a Canton high school principal to introduce him at his
induction and he spent almost all of his induction speech talking
about the importance of education.</TE>
<TE>   He created the Page Education Foundation, which has provided
scholarships for some 3,400 young people. The foundation is just
another part of Page's amazing story.</TE>

<HD>Dinkins Doesn't Yield to Adversity</HD>
<DH>Girls' basketball: Rialto Eisenhower guard rallies from
setbacks, including the death of her father.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When she was 14, her father died suddenly.</LD>
<LD>   At 15, she was the only bone marrow match that her sister could
turn to in a battle against sickle cell anemia.</LD>
<LD>   Then she ripped a ligament in her right knee, sidelining her for
the season.</LD>
<TE>   Today, at 16, Laura Dinkins is having the best basketball season
of her tumultuous life, averaging 11.3 points and 11.3 rebounds as a
starter at guard for Rialto Eisenhower High, The Times' 20th-ranked
girls' team.</TE>
<TE>   But those stats, as well as her 3.5 grade-point average, are only
part of the reason Dinkins has become an inspiration to those who
know her.</TE>
<TE>   "She's one of those kids," Eisenhower Coach David Wolfe says, "who
keeps you in education."</TE>
<TE>   He was supposed to be in the bleachers, cheering for her when she
made the Eisenhower varsity. That was the deal Dinkins had with her
father, David Edwards, who practiced with her, took her to see the
Lakers, and needled her about someday making it in the WNBA.</TE>
<TE>   But only weeks after learning his daughter would be playing
varsity as a freshman, Edwards died of a stroke in September, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Grief-stricken and confused, Dinkins wondered whether she should
continue playing basketball, a passion she so closely shared with her
father. For two months, she would go home after school and close her
bedroom door.</TE>
<TE>   And cry.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something I wanted to do with him by my side," she said. "I
thought about it every minute of the day ... I really didn't want to
play without my dad being there to see my progress."</TE>
<TE>   But that would have gone against her father's wishes. Although she
played sparingly, she finished her freshman season on a strong note,
averaging 12 points and eight rebounds in three playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   The next summer, Dinkins, one of six children ages 13 to 30,
learned that her younger sister was dying. The family had known since
Deanna was a toddler that she had sickle cell anemia. But it wasn't
until the summer of 2000 that they were told she would likely die
without a bone marrow transplant.</TE>
<TE>   And Dinkins was the only match.</TE>
<TE>   Floyd Eddings, an assistant at Eisenhower who began taking Dinkins
under his wing, was enlisted to tell Dinkins about her sister's
worsening condition--and how she could help.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me that Deanna was probably going to die if she didn't
have the transplant, if I wasn't willing to help her out," Dinkins
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   But she was frightened. Of the needles involved. Of the guilt she
would feel if the transplant didn't succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I had to be willing to help her, but I went back and forth
for about three days about not doing it. I'd say yes, and then no,
and then yes, and then no. I was scared. I wasn't sure what the
effect was going to be on me, or her, if she rejected it," Dinkins
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I had already lost my dad, and if I didn't help my sister, I was
going to lose her too. That was the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   The transplant, for the most part, has been a success. Deanna has
suffered a series of afflictions, including a shrinking jaw and
severe blistering in her mouth and throat that has required regular
hospital stays, but her prognosis is good. Hip replacement surgery is
also planned after she is taken off an aggressive steroid treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time, she'll be a normal kid," Vivian Edwards said
of her daughter. "She's had to endure a lot. She's still enduring."</TE>
<TE>   As is Dinkins.</TE>
<TE>   While her mother works for Kaiser Permanente Medical Center,
Dinkins oversees her sister's care. Every few weeks, Deanna feels
well enough to watch Dinkins play.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a lot of people, especially 16-year-olds, who have a
little sister who goes through all this," Deanna said. "[But Laura]
still keeps her cool and functions with everything that's going on."</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks after donating her marrow, Dinkins suffered a torn
anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus in her right knee during a
summer tournament game.</TE>
<TE>   Her sophomore season was almost entirely lost. She played in only
the last two games--one of them a playoff upset of Chaffey in which
she sparked a comeback by contributing eight points and six rebounds
off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until this, her junior season, that Dinkins has stayed
healthy and enjoyed the kind of consistent success she and her father
envisioned. Her team plays at home tonight against Etiwanda in the
second round of the Southern Section's Div. 1-AA playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   It's not so much what Dinkins has been able to accomplish, as it
is how she's gone about it that is most impressive. For example, when
she sat out last season, Dinkins still watched every practice. She
also filmed the games and passed out water during the breaks. She
boosted her grades and also her team's morale, then put in the extra
work it took to get back into playing shape for this season.</TE>
<TE>   "She works very hard for her academic and basketball success,"
Wolfe said. "She's not the fastest, but she's our best defender.
She's not the best jumper, but she can lead us in rebounding. She's
not the best shooter, but she can figure out a way to score."And
figure out a way to cope.</TE>
<TE>   "I admire how strong she is to keep going," said Jasmine
Clarendon, a teammate. "She's strong-hearted, brave, outgoing,
serious. I don't think most high school kids could handle it."</TE>
<TE>   Dinkins credits Clarendon, a classmate, for helping her
"emotionally and basketball-wise" when she was struggling her
freshman year.</TE>
<TE>   "There were times I wanted to quit, but she kept pushing me
through," Dinkins said. "I really kept to myself, I didn't have a lot
of friends. She gave me peace of mind and comfort. She'd give me a
hug and let me know that everything was OK. That really helped."</TE>
<TE>   Eddings, a former NFL receiver, also played an important role in
Dinkins' emotional journey.</TE>
<TE>   "She's relentless in her effort to learn things. She never gives
up, she keeps asking questions," said Eddings, whose close
relationship with Dinkins led to an unexpected relationship: He
became engaged to Vivian Edwards on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of kids don't show an appreciation for things, but she
alone makes up for all those other kids because she appreciated
things so much," Eddings said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Dinkins appreciates the memories. She recalls fondly the day
after a summer league game when she and her father learned together
she would be playing varsity basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's the happiest I had ever seen him," Dinkins said.
"He was so happy I was going to play varsity, and he told me to keep
working hard and never give up."</TE>

<HD>A Healthy Beltre Ends Who's-on-Third Talk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>It wasn't an Olympic year, but the Dodgers fielded a 7x.225 relay
team last season.</LD>
<LD>   In Adrian Beltre's absence for the first 36 games of 2001, seven
third basemen--Chris Donnels, Jeff Reboulet, Dave Hansen, Phil Hiatt,
Hiram Bocachica, Jeff Branson and Tim Bogar--combined to hit .225
with one home run and 12 runs batted in.</LD>
<LD>   And you wonder why Dodger Manager Jim Tracy is excited to see
Beltre in camp this spring, in excellent shape and primed to join the
team for its first full-squad workout today?</LD>
<TE>   "This is my first spring training where I can look at my everyday
third baseman and see a picture of health," Tracy said Tuesday. "I
don't think I ever got an opportunity to see that last year."</TE>
<TE>   Beltre, 22, was a wreck last winter, losing 30 pounds while
battling complications from a botched appendectomy in the Dominican
Republic. He had a second surgery March 12 to close a wound in his
right lower abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre opened the season on the disabled list and returned in
mid-May, but it was another three months before he began to remotely
resemble the Beltre who batted .290 with 20 homers and 85 RBIs in
2000. Beltre, who batted .203 in May, batted .304 in August and
finished with a .265 average, 13 home runs and 60 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a whole different story this year," Beltre said. "I was in
the hospital at this time last year. I couldn't eat, walk, throw,
hit. Now, it's so exciting to be here. I can talk, play around, jump,
swing, hit. I'm looking forward to being healthy all season."</TE>
<TE>   So are the Dodgers, who will need a lot more offense from Beltre
and first baseman Eric Karros, who battled back problems last season,
if they are to overcome the loss of left fielder Gary Sheffield, the
36-homer, 100-RBI slugger who was traded to Atlanta in January.</TE>
<TE>   "No doubt, Sheffield was a great hitter; there's not a lot of
right-handed hitters like him," Beltre said. "But it's not all about
one hitter, it's about a team. If we're all healthy and do the little
things, we should be OK."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Andy Ashby cleared another significant hurdle Tuesday
in his recovery from surgery to repair a torn flexor muscle in his
elbow. Of the 50 pitches in his bullpen workout, Ashby threw about 10
curveballs, the first time he had snapped off breaking pitches during
his rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little timid at first, but as I went on I was OK," Ashby
said. "I really wanted to see how I was going to feel, because
throwing a curve can really bite [on your elbow]. With each step you
take, throwing the cutter, the split-fingered fastball, you're
wondering how you're going to feel. After throwing three or four
curves, I realized it felt pretty good. I'm definitely going in the
right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger ace Kevin Brown, who is recovering from the same surgery
Ashby had, threw 80 times Tuesday, 40 long toss and 40 off a flat
surface, for the second consecutive day. Brown experienced no
problems or discomfort and will not throw today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hideo Nomo's split-fingered fastball already has baffled a few
Dodger catchers, who have had trouble handling the Japanese
right-hander's dirt-diving pitch in early bullpen sessions, and Tracy
has taken notice.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people question why he returned to the success [in 2001]
that he had earlier in his career, and my opinion is because the
depth of his splitter is back, and that was something he lost over
time," Tracy said of Nomo, who was 12-10 with a 4.50 earned-run
average for Boston in 2001 and led the American League with 220
strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a very difficult pitch to lay off when it's going right
and an easy pitch to hit when you hang it."</TE>

<HD>Expos Go to the Pen</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After unsettling winter, team still seeks
personnel as it opens what could be its last spring training.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JUPITER, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The Montreal Expos are making this up as they go along--witness the
signing of Jose Canseco on Tuesday--trying to rebuild an organization
frozen by major league baseball's contraction plan, decimated by an
unprecedented ownership situation and waiting for the other shoe to
drop.</LD>
<LD>   Baseball's 29 other teams combined to purchase the Expos last week
after politicians and the courts prevented the elimination of clubs
this season, providing another stay of execution for a franchise that
has been on life support since the mid-1990s.</LD>
<LD>   All but six baseball operations employees--minor league coaches, a
couple of roving instructors and the farm director--bolted the
seemingly sinking ship, with many joining former owner Jeffrey Loria,
who bought the Florida Marlins for $158.5 million after selling the
Expos for $120 million.</LD>
<TE>   The players and remaining skeleton staff are now operating under
newcomers in the Expos' top positions, including President Tony
Tavares, who resigned as president of Disney's Anaheim Sports
subsidiary in January, General Manager Omar Minaya and Manager Frank
Robinson. However, no one is sure where this is going or how long the
ride will continue.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Bud Selig remains committed to eliminating at least
two teams before the 2003 season, and baseball's lowest-revenue club
is expected to be first to go. If contraction is postponed again, the
Expos, who were last in the majors in attendance last season, are
among the teams that might move to Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   On their second day of spring workouts here earlier this week, the
Expos tried to get back to baseball after what was an unsettling
winter even by their depressing standards. The day was sunny and
cloudless, but the mood was darkened by the haze of resignation. This
contraction stuff is just the latest in a long line of bloopers.</TE>
<TE>   "Around here, it's been difficult for a bunch of years, but this
is ... it's been hard," said pitcher Javier Vazquez, the Expos'
representative to the players' union. "All the great players in
Montreal left [in previous fire sales] because they [management]
traded them. But this is different.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been crazy and frustrating. Baseball just forgot about
us, but we're here right now. Hopefully, we can forget about the
winter and concentrate on baseball."</TE>
<TE>   That's all Minaya and Robinson would like to do, too.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball's first Hispanic general manager, Minaya, 43, was
formerly a senior assistant general manager with the New York Mets. A
native of the Dominican Republic, he is considered a top talent
evaluator. He eagerly accepted Selig's offer to run the Expos despite
the uncertainty surrounding the franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Minaya does not consider himself a caretaker for a dying club,
saying he is working to bolster the roster and operating as if the
Expos will be playing beyond this season. But he also has a safety
net, moving to a position in the commissioner's office if the Expos
are out of business in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to hire a minor league staff, a scouting staff and a
player development staff. And we have to get some [more] players,"
said Minaya, who has been denied permission to interview officials
from some organizations because of the unusual timing of the search
process. "There are some big challenges in front of me, but our goal
here is to win. I feel comfortable, with me having the authority to
do things, that we're going to get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Minaya wants to hire many of the 60 Marlin employees dismissed
when Loria brought his staff with him. That should help the Expos
fill positions in their farm system, where only two of last season's
29 coaches and instructors remain. Fortunately, the club's minor
league camp doesn't have to be fully operational until March 8.</TE>
<TE>   Even with all the uncertainty surrounding the Expos, Minaya
considers his appointment a big break. For Robinson, it's just
another way to punch the clock for a year.</TE>
<TE>   At Selig's request, the 66-year-old Hall of Famer left his
position as baseball's vice president of on-field discipline to
return to the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   The only player to be selected most valuable player in both
leagues, Robinson became the first African American manager in major
league history when the Cleveland Indians hired him toward the end of
the 1974 season. He also guided the San Francisco Giants and
Baltimore Orioles--being selected the American League manager of the
year with the Orioles in 1989--and has a career record of 680-751.</TE>
<TE>   He was not pining to be a manager again. Robinson acknowledges he
knew little about Montreal's players before pitchers and catchers had
their first workout Sunday, and his coaching staff was hastily
arranged. But he said that shouldn't stop the Expos from competing.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I look at it, it's a baseball season that has to be
played," said Robinson, who stressed he is not interested in managing
past this season. "We're not going to worry ourselves about the
off-field stuff; the political stuff. The only thing we have control
of is what's happening on the field.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to focus on baseball and play it as usual. We're
going to go out there and try to win every possible game. At the end
of the year, we'll hope that's enough to get us into the playoffs.
It's as simple as that."</TE>
<TE>   Improving the roster would help.</TE>
<TE>   While awaiting a decision on contraction, Loria's staff did
nothing to upgrade a club that finished 68-94, 20 games behind the
National League East champion Atlanta Braves. The Expos have four of
the game's rising young stars in Vazquez, outfielder Vladimir
Guerrero, shortstop Orlando Cabrera and second baseman Jose Vidro.
But they need more help, and Minaya said he has the authority to do
what is necessary--just as long as it's within the Expos' $35-million
budget.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to be creative," Minaya said.</TE>
<TE>   Minaya proved it in signing Canseco to a minor league contract.
The 37-year-old slugger has never played in the National League and
hasn't played 100 games in the outfield during a season since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   That was Minaya's first major personnel move, and he seems
confident that he can reshape the Expos to be competitive. "The fact
that I have experience in so many areas, I've been involved in
professional scouting, amateur scouting, international scouting, I
feel comfortable that we are going to be OK," Minaya said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have some great young players, and those guys are a big part
of winning games. If somebody wants to make me an offer on any of our
players, I'll listen. But I'm not shopping our players."</TE>

<LD>If you go by money alone, the four-year-old Accenture Match Play
Championship is among the top events in the world. It offers $5.5
million in prize money, more than any tournament in the world other
than the Masters, the Players Championship and the Tour Championship,
which have $6 million purses.</LD>
<LD>   If you go by reputation and stature, let's just say we've got a
slight cachet problem here.</LD>
<LD>   The top-ranked players in the world are playing for $5.5 million,
beginning today at La Costa. A terrific event. So who is the
defending champion?</LD>
<TE>   Exactly.</TE>
<TE>   The answer is Steve Stricker, whose hard-earned victory last year
in Australia ended his five-year winless streak.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how great a victory it was for Stricker, it will be
noted that he did it against a short field because many of the
top-ranked players didn't want to start their year the first week of
January in South Oakleigh, Victoria, Australia.</TE>
<TE>   It certainly wasn't the fault of Stricker, who was ranked 90th,
that the highest-ranking U.S. player who did show up was Hal Sutton,
ranked eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't feel like a defending champion since we are a long
ways away from where we were last year," Stricker said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the Match Play Championship is proving that even
if you cannot buy tradition, you may at least be able to afford a
down payment. This would be a critical year in the evolution of the
big-money tournament if a new deal wasn't already in the works. This
is the last year of Accenture's contract as title sponsor. A new
four-year contract is expected to be announced Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The match play event is part of a four-tournament World Golf
Championship series governed by the International Federation of PGA
Tours--the PGA Tour, the European Tour, the Asian PGA, the Southern
Africa Tour, the PGA Australasia Tour and the Japan Golf Tour. The
total prize money for all four events is $19.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   All business news aside, the real barometer of whether the Match
Play is a success is whether the players support it. They're
certainly lining up behind it this week, with 62 of the top 64
players in the world rankings at La Costa. The only ones missing are
Jose Coceres, who broke his arm playing soccer, and Thomas Bjorn, who
didn't want to travel.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody else is here, including Tiger Woods, who meets Peter
O'Malley of Australia in a first-round match and would face Nick
Price or Angel Cabrera in the second round. Woods says he is a fan of
the match play format.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to play each moment," he said. "That's the cool thing
about match play. You don't just worry about your game, you've got to
worry about what your opponent is doing, the golf course, the
conditions. It's a neat feeling because we don't get a chance to do
that as often as we would like."</TE>
<TE>   The last time the match play event was at La Costa, Darren Clarke
defeated Woods in a 36-hole final, 4-and-3. Clarke, who missed the
cut last week at the Nissan Open, says he is playing well enough, but
that he isn't having much luck on the greens.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke said his last visit to La Costa was a relaxed week for him.</TE>
<TE>   "Just walking around without a care in the world," he said.
"Walked around, smoking a cigar and having a nice time on the golf
course and that was it. It wasn't as if I wasn't trying, I just
didn't feel like I was."</TE>
<TE>   Clarke's first-round opponent is Matt Gogel, who won at Pebble
Beach three weeks ago.</TE>

broadcaster could be back at work by late April.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The orthopedic surgeon who performed hip surgery on Chick Hearn on
Tuesday called the operation a "complete success" and predicted Hearn
could be back announcing Laker games by late April--in time for the
NBA playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Hearn, who suffered a broken hip in a mishap at a service station
Sunday evening, should be up and using a walker by today, and is
expected to be walking with a cane when he leaves the hospital in a
week to 10 days, said Herbert Huddleston, who performed the surgery
at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys.</LD>
<LD>   The ball of Hearn's right hip was replaced during the procedure,
and Huddleston said Hearn was cracking jokes almost immediately
afterward.</LD>
<TE>   "He told me, 'I see my foot is still pointing in the right
direction,'" Huddleston said.</TE>
<TE>   Huddleston and others who took part in the surgery said in a news
conference that Hearn couldn't have come through the procedure any
better. They proclaimed him fit and strong and said all his vital
signs were good. Huddleston called him a "model patient."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Patterson, Hearn's cardiologist, said if the accident had
happened before Hearn had heart surgery Dec. 19 to repair an aortic
valve, there would have been more concern about his health and the
rigors of surgery.</TE>
<TE>   But fhis heart is now in good shape and "just about 100% recovered
from the heart surgery," Patterson said.</TE>
<TE>   During the surgery, which began at 4:20 p.m. and was concluded by
5:45, Hearn's wife, Marge, stayed in an ICU waiting room.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just one of those freak accidents," she said of Sunday's
incident. "And it could have been worse."</TE>
<TE>   She said the couple stopped for gas on their way out to dinner.
The station has a full-service lane, but Chick chose self-service.</TE>
<TE>   Chick was putting a credit card in the slot when the car started
moving forward, Marge said.</TE>
<TE>   Benito Murillo, who was working at the station Sunday night, said
Chick ran after the car.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he was worried about his wife," Murillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Marge said the door on the driver's side was open and her husband
was knocked over while attempting to get back in the car.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing he said was that he thought his hip was broken,"
Marge said.</TE>
<TE>   The car came to rest in some shrubs, and Marge called 911 from
inside the station.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson, the cardiologist, said he asked his famous patient
before Tuesday's surgery why he was pumping his own gas.</TE>
<TE>   The response was vintage Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to save up in order to pay my doctor bills," he quipped.</TE>

<HD>Walker Is Put on Injured List</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was the pop that scared Samaki Walker.</LD>
<LD>   When he yanked free from the Portland Trail Blazers' Shawn Kemp on
Sunday after the two had locked arms at Portland's Rose Garden,
Walker heard something pop in his elbow.</LD>
<LD>   So he was relieved to learn that an MRI taken Monday revealed
nothing more serious than a hyperextension.</LD>
<TE>   Even the news that he had been put on the injured list, exchanging
places with Shaquille O'Neal, didn't quiet Walker's sigh of relief.</TE>
<TE>   "When I heard that pop, that was something I had never experienced
before," Walker said. "I thought the worst. So I think I got off
easy."</TE>
<TE>   Required to spend at least five games on the injured list, Walker
can't return before the finale of the Lakers' coming trip, a Feb.
27th game against Minnesota. Walker's recovery period is estimated at
five to seven days.</TE>
<TE>   "When something like this happens, it's frustrating," said Walker,
who is averaging seven points.</TE>
<TE>   But, he grudgingly admitted, the injury might also provide a
welcome respite from the heavy workload he has been forced to assume
in O'Neal's absence.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's a positive to this," Walker said, "that's it."</TE>
<TE>   But he's not looking for an extended vacation.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I am able to straighten it out," said Walker of his elbow,
"I'll be able to tape it up and go."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even if Walker had not been injured, he would have been missing
from the starting lineup for the first time this season on Tuesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson was already planning on starting Robert Horry
at power forward because he feels Horry is a better matchup against
Boston Celtic power forward Antoine Walker.</TE>

<HD>A Matter of Time for Lakers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Bryant's potential game-winning basket
comes just after time runs out in a 109-108 loss to Celtics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers didn't lose Tuesday night's game at Staples Center to the
Boston Celtics by a point, 109-108.</LD>
<LD>   It was closer than that.</LD>
<LD>   They didn't lose by a tenth of a second.</LD>
<TE>   It was even closer than that.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing by one, Kobe Bryant launched a shot which would go
through the net as time expired. But as replays clearly showed, two
of his fingertips were still on the ball as the clock hit 0:00.</TE>
<TE>   It was that close.</TE>
<TE>   "We got together after the last shot," said referee Bob Delaney.
"Through the communication of the three referees, we determined that
the shot was still on the hand when there were zeroes on the clock.
It's a late shot."</TE>
<TE>   No argument from Laker Coach Phil Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "Looked like it was still in his hand when the red light went
off," Jackson said. "Close. It might have been the only good call
they made all night."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's shot was necessary because of Antoine Walker's go-ahead
basket a second earlier. With his team down by two, Walker took an
in-bounds pass from Eric Williams, took one dribble, and, before
Robert Horry could get to him, launched a three-pointer that banked
off the glass and through the hoop with 1.8 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Walker had 30 points along with 14 rebounds and 10 assists for a
triple-double.</TE>
<TE>   Teammate Paul Pierce had a game-high 33 points.</TE>
<TE>   Lost in all the excitement was the return of Shaquille O'Neal
after a five-game stay on the injured list to rest the arthritic big
toe on his right foot. O'Neal had 25 points and 17 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Even without the game-winning shot, Bryant had a team-leading 27
points.</TE>
<TE>   Cedric Maxwell, the former Celtic forward who now works as a team
broadcaster, said before the game the best way to recreate the old
Celtic-Laker rivalry would be to reunite the teams of the 1980s for
one game on pay-per-view.</TE>
<TE>   Don't waste your time focusing on nostalgia.</TE>
<TE>   The reunited Lakers and rejuvenated Celtics, while not exactly
recreating the Magic-Bird era, put some life back into the old
rivalry Tuesday in front of a sellout crowd of 18,997.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers dominated Boston in the first half, only to have the
Celtics make a fight of it later.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take O'Neal long to make his presence felt. As a matter
of fact, it didn't take any time at all. O'Neal easily won the
opening tipoff against Tony Battie.</TE>
<TE>   Systems check: Leaping ability operating normally.</TE>
<TE>   With a little over a minute gone, O'Neal was fouled. He converted
both free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Systems check: Free-throw shooting operating above normal.</TE>
<TE>   Two and a half minutes into the first half, O'Neal took a pass
from Rick Fox and scored on a trademark slam dunk.</TE>
<TE>   Systems check: Strength and determination operating within normal
range.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty seconds later, O'Neal took another pass from Fox and scored
on a smooth layup.</TE>
<TE>   Systems check: Mobility operating within normal range.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal also drew a foul on the play, but missed the free throw.</TE>
<TE>   Systems check: Free-throw shooting back to normal.</TE>
<TE>   Diagnostic conclusion: Shaq is back.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers led by 12 after the first quarter, 34-22, and upped
that to 15, 63-48, at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers squandered nearly all of that in the first five minutes
of the third quarter, Kenny Anderson's jumper moving the Celtics to
within five at 70-65.</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics figured to be tired, playing their fifth game in eight
days in the final stretch of a marathon seven-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the Celtics, not the Lakers, who appeared to have the
fresher legs.</TE>
<TE>   "They made a nice comeback on us," Jackson said. "We seemed to
lose all our sense of execution down the stretch the last two minutes
of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant disputed the officials call on the court, and was still
disputing the call in the locker room after the game, saying Sean
Corbin changed the minds of Delaney and third official Phil Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   "Two officials said it was good," Bryant said. "For one to come in
and overturn it in such a close situation, I don't agree with that
too much."</TE>

<HD>He's in Fat City</HD>
<DH>Vaughn, Happy to Be Out of Southern California, Thinks He
Has Finally Found a Home With the Mets</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Mo Vaughn is in a New York state of mind, recharged by his bustling
new surroundings and eager to reaffirm his star power.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Met first baseman, who reported to spring training
here Tuesday, is reveling in his good fortune, having been given a
chance to revive his stagnant career in baseball's marquee city.
Vaughn quickly embraced the Big Apple after three demoralizing
seasons with the Angels, saying he wasn't suited for the laid-back
Southland.</LD>
<LD>   He returns to the field after sitting out last season because of a
left arm injury, joining a club that underwent a radical off-season
makeover and expects to win the National League East division. Vaughn
is a big part of the Mets' ambitious plan to unseat the Atlanta
Braves, and that's fine with him.</LD>
<TE>   "Do I feel this team should win? Yes, I do," said the burly,
bearded Vaughn, appearing relaxed in his first spring session with a
throng of reporters at the Met training complex. "I think everybody
in the clubhouse should feel it too. You should feel pressure to play
well, and that's the pressure you put on yourself.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tremendous situation. If every individual does their
thing as individuals, you can come together perfectly as a whole. You
could have a great ballclub."</TE>
<TE>   The Mets are counting on Vaughn doing his part after they traded
veteran starter Kevin Appier to the Angels on Dec. 27 for the 1995
American League most valuable player, gambling that he had recovered
from surgery to repair a ruptured biceps tendon. Met General Manager
Steve Phillips made many other major moves, shuffling the deck with
blockbuster trades and free-agent signings, resulting in a roster
that also includes All-Star second baseman Roberto Alomar, slugging
outfielder Jeromy Burnitz, speedy leadoff batter Roger Cedeno and
starters Shawn Estes and Pedro Astacio.</TE>
<TE>   But players consider Vaughn the key new ingredient because of his
left-handed power and reputation as a leader in the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're in the playoffs, chances are Mo Vaughn is going to have
good numbers," said All-Star catcher Mike Piazza, who might benefit
most from Vaughn's presence. "If Mo gets a hit to win a game one day,
I want that to be me the next day. I think we'll all be that way. I'm
excited, but the humility part of the game will not allow me to make
predictions."</TE>
<TE>   Neither will Vaughn, who is gradually regaining his batting form.
He said his weight, an issue throughout his career, is not going to
be a problem. Vaughn hopes to start the season at 260 pounds. He
still needs to drop about 10.</TE>
<TE>   "[Acquiring Vaughn was] risky, but I don't think it's any more
risky than anybody else who has a year off and comes back to play,"
Manager Bobby Valentine said. "I'll be curious to see how he picks up
at first."</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn still has high expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that if I'm a healthy ballplayer, and I go out there and
get my 600 at-bats, I'm going to do my thing," said Vaughn, who has
hit at least 33 home runs in six of eight full seasons, including at
least 40 twice.</TE>
<TE>   "I did my thing unhealthy for two years, and I still was able to
ring up some stuff with a lot of things on my mind. I know if I've
got a clear mind, if I'm a happy player and healthy, there's some
great things that I can do."</TE>
<TE>   He rarely had clarity in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn was considered the final piece to an AL West championship
when the Angels lured him to Edison Field with a six-year,
$80-million deal, the biggest contract in team history, but things
started badly and continued downhill. He slipped down the dugout
steps in pursuit of a pop fly on opening night in 1999 and limped
through most of a season marred by injuries and infighting.</TE>
<TE>   He also came under fire from teammates for not participating in a
brawl against the Cleveland Indians at Jacobs Field in August 1999.
Vaughn said he knew he made a mistake in joining the Angels, and he
made the best of it as long as he could.</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn was born in Norwalk, Conn., attended college at Seton Hall
in New Jersey and his off-season home is in Boston. Guess where he's
most comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no animosity toward the Anaheim Angels," he said. "They
signed me as a free agent; it just didn't seem to work out the right
way there, that's all. It was an opportunity to come back to the East
Coast. Now, I'm right where I started as a kid. It just seems this is
the proper situation.</TE>
<TE>   "I can always thank them [the Angels] for being instrumental in
trading me this way. I have no ill will toward them. I think the
situation is just right here. I'm a professional, I'm going to play
where I have to play, but this is the ultimate situation."</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn has put down roots in New York, moving to the trendy lower
Manhattan neighborhood of TriBeCa. He's determined to experience all
the city has to offer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll probably change my [permanent] residence to New York," he
said. "That's the only way you can get the feel of where you are."</TE>
<TE>   Many wonder about the feeling in the Met clubhouse, what with so
many high-profile veterans. Vaughn said it would only take a New York
minute for the Mets to become one big family.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike Piazza is a good guy. I don't need two weeks to get to know
him," he said. "All I've got to do is sit with him to find out what's
going on with the individual. I sat with [reliever] John Franco and
met his wife and his kid [in the off-season]. I also ran into
[starter] Al Leiter. Roberto Alomar? I called him on the phone when
[Vaughn was traded to the Mets]. He's in Puerto Rico and we're
yelling back and forth. We're happy. Let's not make too much of it.
We're all good guys. You could tell that right away.</TE>
<TE>   "No knocks on any other situation, but this is the first time I've
ever been on a team where you could just throw out the balls [and
play]. All Bobby Valentine has to do is just give the signs. We don't
need a damn conference to find out [about each other]. We don't need
to go on a retreat."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Minnesota Timberwolves knew they needed a team effort without top
scorer and rebounder Kevin Garnett on Tuesday night, especially on
the road against the Dallas Mavericks.</LD>
<LD>   Chauncey Billups and Wally Szczerbiak stepped up to the challenge.</LD>
<LD>   Billups scored 24 of his career-high 36 points in the third
quarter, and Szczerbiak had 31 as Minnesota rallied for a 117-100
victory.</LD>
<TE>   "I had to keep pressure on the offensive end, and I did that,"
said Billups, playing his fifth game as the starting point guard
since previous starter Terrell Brandon went down with a left leg
injury. "The team fed off my energy. Wally started getting hot.
Everybody played well."</TE>
<TE>   The victory moved Minnesota within a half-game of first-place
Dallas in the Midwest Division.</TE>
<TE>   Garnett was in South Carolina to attend the funeral of his
grandfather on Tuesday morning and was unable to get to Dallas for
the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I told our guys that even without [Garnett], we wanted to share
the ball so that we wouldn't be predictable," Minnesota Coach Flip
Saunders said. "Offensively, I told our guys to be aggressive, and
Chauncey and Wally were aggressive. We were going to find a way to
hang in there."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Nash scored 24 points, and Adrian Griffin 15 for the
Mavericks, who had won eight of their previous 11 games against the
Timberwolves.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 99, Atlanta 79--Chris Webber had 19 points and 12
rebounds as the Kings pulled away in the fourth quarter for a victory
over the Hawks at Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Vlade Divac added 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Kings, who
outscored Atlanta, 30-13, in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento, which had its 20-game home winning streak ended Sunday
night by Seattle, improved to 28-2 at home.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 123, Golden State 115--Jason Kidd had 26 points, 12
assists and 12 rebounds for his league-high sixth triple-double, and
44th of his career, to lead the Nets over the Warriors at East
Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Lucious Harris had 19 points as New Jersey finished with seven
players in double figures in winning their third consecutive game,
and sending the Warriors to their eighth consecutive road loss and
16th in 17 games.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 99, Memphis 93--Tim Duncan scored 23 points, including
the last six points in overtime, and had 12 rebounds as the Spurs won
at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Daniels had 19 points and David Robinson had 14 points and
14 rebounds for the Spurs, who have defeated the Grizzlies 17
consecutive times.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 103, Phoenix 91--Rashard Lewis and Brent Barry each scored
18 points at Phoenix as the SuperSonics handed the Suns their fourth
consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   The loss was the second in as many games since Frank Johnson
replaced Scott Skiles as Sun coach on Sunday, and dropped the Suns
(25-28) three games under .500 for the first time this season.</TE>
<TE>   Clifford Robinson of the Detroit Pistons was suspended for one
game after pleading guilty to driving while under the influence of
alcohol, violating Arizona state law. Robinson will miss the Pistons'
home game against Washington tonight.... Michael Jordan did not have
his knee drained and is instead relying on ice and rest to soothe the
ailing joint that will force him to miss a game for only the second
time this season. Jordan did not travel with the Washington Wizards
to Detroit for tonight's game. He plans to play in Thursday's home
game against New Jersey.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Not Bullish on First Big Trade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Desperation, the mother of invention....</LD>
<LD>   Two NBA teams, Indiana and Chicago (giving the Bulls the benefit
of the doubt), began moving bodies in earnest, and more continued to
shop, hoping their general managers don't drop, at least before
Thursday's trade deadline.</LD>
<LD>   Not the locals, however. Insiders confirm the Lakers' and
Clippers' claims they're sitting this one out.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers, of course, need a healthy Shaquille O'Neal and there
aren't any on the market.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' Lamar Odom and Corey Maggette have been mentioned a
lot, but that's just other teams licking their chops over talented
young players they think Donald T. Sterling doesn't want to pay.</TE>
<TE>   I know, Donald, it's unfair. I can't imagine where they got that
idea but you'll show 'em.</TE>
<TE>   Won't you?</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the time may come when the Clippers have to think about
trading Odom, who's no longer their linchpin and remains
irresponsible, not to mention accident-prone, for something they
need, like a big-time, lights-out shooter.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, no one is offering a big-time, lights-out
shooter for him so that time isn't now.</TE>
<TE>   On to the big deal of the day:</TE>
<TE>   Chicago sends Brad Miller, Ron Artest and assorted journeymen to
Indiana for Jalen Rose, Travis Best and assorted journeymen and draft
picks (a "conditional No. 2," whatever that is).</TE>
<TE>   Comment: Have the Bulls lost their minds?</TE>
<TE>   In a word, yes. Of course, it happened years ago, before they ran
off their dynasty.</TE>
<TE>   Four seasons, one coach and 179 losses later, they're dismayed to
find rebuilding isn't as much fun as it looked. Since no free agent
they'd want will sign with them, for them, it may be impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Now as crowds finally dwindle in the United Center, people around
the Bulls say things like, "We could never take another young
player," because they don't think they can wait that long anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Why can't they? They're not in this mess by accident. They got
here the old-fashioned way, they earned it.</TE>
<TE>   It's a surprise to them that terminating a dynasty and starting
from scratch, to say nothing of doing it in a very-cold-weather city
with a very-player-unfriendly rep, carries a certain risk?</TE>
<TE>   Now they have Rose, who can score (20 points a game last season,
18.5 this one) and, best of all, can't flee, signed as he is for four
seasons after this one, at an average of $15 million per.</TE>
<TE>   On the down side, he always was moody and stardom, even at his
level (this isn't Kobe Bryant or Tracy McGrady or even Vince Carter;
Rose has never been an All-Star) hasn't turned him cheerful,
optimistic or selfless.</TE>
<TE>   Rose's problems with Coach Isiah Thomas have been an open secret
for months, since Thomas lamented:</TE>
<TE>   "If the guys I have can't take me past .500, then I have to find a
way to get past .500. It's not, 'I've been in the league eight years
and I'm owed.' You ain't owed [anything.] Your money's guaranteed but
your minutes aren't."</TE>
<TE>   Rose, 29, has been in the league eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the 6-foot-11 Miller, 25, took off 40 pounds and turned
into one of the East's better centers, averaging 13 points and 8.4
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, in the West he'd be a decent power forward, but
big men are scarce and he still represents a major upgrade over the
Pacer starter, Jeff Foster, and should work well with Jermaine
O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Artest, an intriguing, young, 6-7, 246-pound guard, a
relentless competitor and a tremendous defender, on and off the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he's either a little wacky, or, as Bull insiders claim,
completely out of his gourd.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was just his surroundings, which he certainly had an
impact on. On the way out of the Bull practice facility Tuesday, he
took his photo off the wall.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming Artest, 22, remains at liberty and comes to games and
practices, the Pacers have acquired a fine prospect while shoring up
their front line and moving Rose out of the way of the kids their
program will rise or fall on, Al Harrington and Jonathan Bender.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the others, priced to move, or not:</TE>
<TE>   Nick Van Exel, Denver--You may remember him. Jerry West dumped him
in 1999 and, although the Lakers don't retain anyone from that deal
(Tyronn Lue, Tony Battie), it remains one of West's best moves.</TE>
<TE>   Van Exel is the Michelangelo of moods and--surprise!--is once
again upset. In his final Laker days, he refused to reclaim his place
in the starting lineup, because coach Del Harris wanted him to. Now,
after floating the possibility of opting out of the last two years of
his contract in 2003--at a cost of $26 million--Van Exel has
recanted.</TE>
<TE>   My bet is Van Exel saw Charles Barkley on TV, raving this would be
one the dumbest moves of all time. Now Van Exel says he won't give up
the money and it's the Nuggets' fault for saying he would, which
can't be true.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: Anyone who didn't know what a pain he can be, just
got a refresher course. Van Exel will probably have to finish the
season in Denver before the Nuggets get desperate enough and give him
away in summer.</TE>
<TE>   Raef LaFrentz, Denver--All of a sudden, people are talking about
this soft, 6-10, three-point shooting, uh, center, averaging 15
points and seven rebounds, as if he were a prize. Of course, the
Knicks are in there pitching, offering their 230-pound,
50-game-a-season, uh, center, Marcus Camby. So far, the Nuggets have
resisted the urge.</TE>
<TE>   Stephon Marbury, Phoenix--Having offed coach Scott Skiles, the
Suns are out of scapegoats and must turn to root causes. They can
move Marbury, who has deep-sixed two teams in a row now, if they're
not too fussy about what they get back.</TE>
<TE>   Penny Hardaway, Phoenix--Unfortunately, the Suns gave him a
contract that has four more seasons--at $56 million--on it, so moving
him will require someone beyond desperation and into panic. In other
words, they should try the Knicks.</TE>

<HD>Hall of Famer Gibson Cited for Assault</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Gibson was cited for assault after a case of
possible road rage in Omaha.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said the situation started Friday in traffic and ended
about 10 miles away after a fist fight at an Interstate 80 gas
station in Sarpy County.</LD>
<LD>   Miguel Sanchez alleged Gibson pulled out from a car lot and cut
him off in traffic. Sanchez admitted he retaliated and cut Gibson
off, but believed the altercation would end there.</LD>
<TE>   Both Gibson and Sanchez were cited Saturday for third-degree
assault. They are expected in court March 20.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any comment," Gibson said from his Bellevue, Neb.,
home Tuesday. "It just doesn't do any good to talk about that kind of
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez claimed Gibson followed him for more than 10 miles as he
left Omaha and traveled west on Interstate 80.</TE>
<TE>   When Sanchez stopped for gas, he said Gibson confronted him.</TE>
<TE>   "I turned my back to reach for the nozzle ... that is when he hit
me here and hit me here," Sanchez said, pointing to both eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Gibson told authorities he followed Sanchez because he wanted the
Omaha man to pay for his eyeglasses, which he said were broken when
Sanchez cut him off in traffic. According to police records, Gibson
also claimed the 45-year-old Sanchez swung first.</TE>
<TE>   Gibson, 66, was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1981.</TE>

<TE>   The Philadelphia Eagles plan to designate Jeremiah Trotter as
their franchise player, a move that will keep the all-pro linebacker
in Philadelphia at least through next season.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles will make the announcement by Thursday's deadline,
preventing Trotter from signing with another team as a free agent, a
source told Associated Press on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Under the franchise tag, Trotter would be forced to accept a
one-year contract believed to be worth about $5.5 million--based on
an average of the league's five highest-paid linebackers.</TE>
<TE>   The New Orleans Saints signed free-agent quarterback Jeff Lewis to

<HD>Murray Is Eager to Return</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>King Coach Andy Murray turned down an offer from a Canadian
television network to provide in-studio analysis of the Olympic
hockey tournament, opting to spend the NHL's Olympic break at home
with his family.</LD>
<LD>   "But I didn't expect to spend it quite like this," Murray said
Tuesday from his home in Faribault, Minn., where he is recovering
after suffering four broken ribs, a concussion, a separated left
shoulder and numerous cuts and scrapes in a single-car accident early
Friday morning outside Sparta, Wis.</LD>
<LD>   Although still stiff and sore under a shoulder and chest brace,
and sporting the stitches that were required to close two cuts on his
forehead and another on his right wrist, Murray said he felt much
better after a painful weekend and was eager to get back to work.</LD>
<TE>   He is scheduled to fly into Los Angeles tonight and said he will
be "back at full power" Thursday morning, when the Kings return to
practice in preparation for the resumption of their season Tuesday
night at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have to hit anybody or take any shots or block any shots
or anything like that," Murray said. "What I have to do compared to
what the players do, I could be a lot worse off than this and still
do it....</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing at all will change."</TE>
<TE>   Early Friday morning, however, almost everything changed.</TE>
<TE>   Driving a late-model Ford truck he had given his older son,
Braden, Murray, 50, was en route from Faribault to Madison, Wis., to
watch the 17-year-old play in a high school hockey tournament when he
encountered a patch of ice on Interstate 90 about four miles east of
Sparta.</TE>
<TE>   Traveling at about 65 mph, the truck slid off the highway, crashed
through a wire fence and rolled several times down an embankment
through a wooded area, landing with its wheels up about 300 feet from
the icy interstate.</TE>
<TE>   A tree stopped it only a few feet before it would have plunged
into a shallow trout stream, Monroe County Sheriff Chuck Amundson
said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Murray's truck, reduced to scrap after the 6 a.m. accident, was
the first of about "four or five" vehicles that skidded off the
roadway within about a 15-minute span after an early morning storm
had "glazed" the highway, Amundson said.</TE>
<TE>   "There were cars going off right and left," the sheriff said.</TE>
<TE>   Murray, though, was the only person injured. He kicked out a
window, crawled out of the wreckage and made his way back up to the
pavement.</TE>
<TE>   Said Murray: "If you saw my truck and you saw me, there's no
comparison. I probably shouldn't have been able to get out of it."</TE>
<TE>   After being treated at St. Mary's Hospital in Sparta, Murray
insisted on attending a game in Sleepy Eye, Minn., involving his
younger son, 12-year-old Jordan.</TE>

<LD>To make it an American gold-medal sweep in 1,500-meter Olympic
speedskating, Jennifer Rodriguez, the Floridian who now lives in Park
City, Utah, will need to pass two higher-ranked competitors in the
women's race today. Derek Parra took care of the men's 1,500 Tuesday,
and Rodriguez, who got a bronze behind Chris Witty's gold in the
1,000, is ranked third in World Cup standings. In front of her are
Germany's Anni Friesinger and Canada's Cindy Klassen. Another German,
Claudia Pechstein, is fourth in the rankings and took the gold in the
3,000 in world-record time.</LD>

<LD>Skeleton time is here, time for the one day of men's and women's
singles in the hell-bent, down-the-hill, face-first race on a tiny
sled at 80 mph that is being contested in the Olympics for only the
third time, and the first since St. Moritz in 1948. Americans have
won three of the six medals awarded in this event--the women's
category is a first-ever--and leading contenders to keep up this U.S.
domination are Chris Soule and Jim Shea Jr. in the men's and LeaAnn
Parsley in the women's.</LD>

<HD>Getting on Board With Jim Shea Jr.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Jim Shea Jr. is going to need a bigger sled. The list of people ready
to take that 4,380-foot run with him in the skeleton competition is
growing, and you're welcome to hop on.</LD>
<LD>   I signed up on a whim, by flipping through a book and randomly
picking a U.S. Olympian to get to know and then follow at these
Games. I landed on skeleton and Jim Shea Jr.</LD>
<LD>   The headfirst version of luge, which is making its return to the
Olympics after a 54-year absence, might be an obscure sport, but this
wasn't an unknown guy. He had a made-for-NBC story, as what was to be
a celebration of three generations of Olympic athletes took a tragic
turn when his grandfather, 1932 speedskating gold medalist Jack Shea,
was killed in a car crash in</LD>
<TE>   January.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of Americans met Jim Jr. through his prominent role in
the opening ceremony. His Olympic teammates selected him to take the
athletes' oath, just as his grandfather did in their hometown of Lake
Placid at the 1932 Games. He and his father, Jim Sr., held the
Olympic torch together in Rice-Eccles Stadium in the final legs of
the relay.</TE>
<TE>   I got to see the playful side of Jim Jr. the day before at a
gathering with reporters. When his cell phone went off, he joyously
held it up so everyone could hear his new ring tone, "Low Rider." He
even sang his customized version of the song:
"Da-da-da-da-daaa-daaa-da, who's calling Jimmy?"</TE>
<TE>   And it turns out his grandfather was born in 1910, the same year
my grandmother was born in upstate New York. Maybe they crossed paths
when they were younger. That's one of the toughest parts of losing
elders, the questions that can never be answered.</TE>
<TE>   At least Shea absorbed as much as he could about the Olympic
experience from his grandfather during the time they did share
together.</TE>
<TE>   Jack told Jimmy about what it was like when he took the oath in
1932.</TE>
<TE>   "He said that literally your hair stood on end," Jim Jr. said.
"And he could feel the heartbeat of America--like the commercial. He
said you could feel the rush of energy and so many people. He just
said his heart was just pounding and it was an almost religious
experience."</TE>
<TE>   The family debated commercialism in the Games; Jack ached when he
heard athletes talk about the Olympics as a marketing vehicle,
something to turn gold into green. The Salt Lake bribery scandal hurt
too. But mostly he taught Jimmy about the true meaning of the
Olympics</TE>
<TE>   "He always talked about the Angel of Peace," Shea said. "It brings
the world together, through sport and competition. He just knew the
importance of it. It's not about winning the medals. It's about
competing. It's the real essence of the Games."</TE>
<TE>   Even though Jim's father competed in the Nordic combined and
cross-country events at the 1964 Innsbruck Games, Shea said he never
felt pressure to follow in their footsteps, like a son groomed to
take over the family business.</TE>
<TE>   He started playing hockey. Then he turned his attention to
bobsled.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have the size that I needed to be good," said Shea, who
also had a brief fling with luge. "So I lost a lot of weight and I
tried skeleton. It was just more exciting to me. Going headfirst
appealed to me. As a kid, you go down face-first. You're by yourself.
It was just nicer."</TE>
<TE>   Problem was, Shea and the Americans weren't very good. They were
traveling through Europe, floundering through the World Cup season in
1997, when the team's coach decided they should head home. But Shea
stuck around.</TE>
<TE>   "I was obsessed with doing well," he said. "I knew that if I got
the time and the experience on the track--[even] half of [what] the
Europeans had that I was going against--if I had a sled, if I had
time on the track, I could do well. I knew it."</TE>
<TE>   He called his father to say he would be staying around Europe. And
he was broke.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'That's Jimmy,'" Jim Sr. said. "I went out and sold
his Jeep for him and sent the money over with another competitor. I
think [I made] 1,700 bucks. Seventeen hundred bucks to somebody
that's living on a shoehorn is a lot of money. But he was living his
dream."</TE>
<TE>   Shea put a wooden board at the bottom of a hockey goalie bag, put
his sled on top of that, then crammed his clothes into the bag. He
dined on gas-station hot dogs. He tried his best to negotiate the
European train system ("I went to the wrong Altenberg three times,"
he said). He'd show up at tracks, do some maintenance work in
exchange for free runs and sleep in the bobsleds. His other
accommodations weren't much better.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was in Austria, I didn't sleep in one place that didn't
have animals underneath it," Shea said.</TE>
<TE>   He befriended the other members of the sport, which forms a tight
community. The British team adopted him as their "Pet Yank." He
learned from them all. Then he beat them in 1999 to become the first
American to win a skeleton world championship.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't get to share the experience with his grandfather too
much ("I couldn't really afford a phone call," Shea said), which was
why these Olympics were to have been the ultimate family moment. Even
though Jack was 91, he was in good health and ready to make the trip
to Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   "We always said that Jack would live to be 1,000," Lake Placid
Mayor Roby Politi said. "He was sharp as a tack. His spirit was
wonderful. When he carried the Olympic torch [at the Lake Placid
Olympic stadium in December], he jogged it in and lit the caldron."</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, two-thirds of the way across the country, the
flame passed into the hands of the Shea family again.</TE>
<TE>   "Both Jimmy and I felt there were three of us, my dad was with
us," Jim Sr. said. "It was special. We've kind of been on a
roller-coaster ride, with Jimmy making the team and Dad's untimely
death. That was a very, very proud moment for all of us."</TE>
<TE>   There is so much going on right now that it's easy to forget both
men are still early in the grieving process.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a lot of emotions built up, a lot of things that have
happened to me lately," Jim Jr. said. "I'm saving it all for after
the Games."</TE>
<TE>   Said Jim Sr.: "It catches you. You have the rush all the time, but
then you always have moments.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know when it's going to creep up on you. You talk about
the opening ceremonies.... At the moment it was just so spectacular
for us. Then you reflect back. The three of us could have physically
been there.... It's a very emotional ride for us."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Shea was to have been honored at a breakfast for U.S.
Olympians Sunday morning. While searching through his father's
belongings, Jim Sr. found a speech Jack had written for the occasion.
He read it on Sunday, sniffling between words, then received a
standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Jr. will place a funeral card from his grandfather's service
underneath his helmet before he makes his run today. So will several
of his competitors.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to slide with all of us," Shea said.</TE>
<TE>   It's the Olympic spirit, championed by Jack Shea, carried out by
his grandson's friends.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably the most special thing about being an Olympian is
meeting all of the athletes from the world," Jim Sr. said. "Basically
you become a family."</TE>
<TE>   Although they lost their patriarch, the family is growing.
Everyone is welcome. Come along for the ride.</TE>

<HD>Judging System Scores Points in Tryout</HD>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Michelle Kwan was outstanding. Sasha Cohen was almost as good. Irina
Slutskaya was better than both.</LD>
<LD>   At least, those were the results after a points system perhaps
resembling the one proposed this week by the International Skating
Union was applied by The Times to the women's technical program
Tuesday night at the Salt Lake Ice Center.</LD>
<LD>   I say perhaps because ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta wasn't
entirely clear about how the new system would operate if adopted. But
figure-skating experts consulted on Tuesday offered their best
guesses, and, interestingly enough for those who assume all figure
skating competitions are fixed, the points system devised resulted in
almost the same order of finish as the one produced by the nine
judges.</LD>
<TE>   (A cynic might suggest that the panelists who scored the skaters
for The Times were as corrupt as the judges, but you'll have to trust
me on that one.)</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the quality of skating was good. None of the favorites
took herself out of medal contention by committing a serious error in
the 2 minute, 40 second technical program. All performed the eight
elements required with levels of presentation ranging from adequate
to excellent.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, no one was really daring technically. Unlike the men,
who took risks in their short programs last week with quad-triple
combination jumps, none of the women even attempted a triple-triple
combination.</TE>
<TE>   Only two of the contenders, Slutskaya and Sarah Hughes, varied
from the tried-and-true triple lutz-double toe combination. They
performed more adventurous triple lutz, double loop combinations.</TE>
<TE>   That technical edge provided the difference for Russia's Slutskaya
in The Times' standings. She finished with 45 points to 441/2 for the
United States' Kwan and Cohen. Hughes was fourth with 431/2.</TE>
<TE>   According to the official standings, compiled by the judges using
the traditional 6.0 scoring system for technical and presentation
marks, Kwan was first, Slutskaya second, Cohen third and Hughes
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "Ooooh, I didn't like the technical marks," Kwan said afterward of
the scores awarded her by the judges.</TE>
<TE>   But an analysis of the elements reveals a technical advantage for
Slutskaya. Not only did she attempt a more difficult combination, she
had incredible height on her triple lutz. She also was more sure on
her double axel and performed her required step sequence on one foot.
Only one other skater, Ukraine's Galina Maniachenko, performed steps
on one foot. Kwan was superior technically to Slutskaya only on her
spirals.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan remained so close in points, and gained the edge in the
judges' scoring, because of her elegant presentation, which was
clearly the best of the night. If she is as impressive Thursday night
in the freestyle program, which rewards presentation more than the
technical program does, she will win the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   The only real complaint about the judging came from Elena
Tchaikovskaya, who coaches Russia's Maria Butyrskaya.</TE>
<TE>   "She skated beautifully and the judges' games continue," she said.</TE>
<TE>   If judges were playing games, it was the ones from Russia, Denmark
and Belarus who placed her third. The other judges had her between
fourth and eighth. She finished fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Tchaikovskaya would have been even more upset about The Times'
standings, which placed Butyrskaya sixth behind Japan's Fumie Suguri.</TE>
<TE>   The Times' panel assigned a standard number of points to each of
the eight required elements and awarded bonuses depending on how well
those elements were performed. For instance, a double axel was worth
three points. If it was done well, it was worth an extra point. If it
was done superbly, it was worth two extra points.</TE>
<TE>   The same point system was used to judge presentation, then doubled
to give it extra weight, then gave it even a little more weight by
deeming it the tiebreaker. But presentation still was worth only 20%,
not 50% as it is in the current system. That removes a great deal of
subjectivity--and potential for judges' malfeasance--from the short
program, which, after all, is supposed to place more emphasis on
technique.</TE>
<TE>   Butyrskaya suffered because of that. She brings more maturity to
her skating at 29 than most of her competitors, but she was
technically above average Tuesday night on only her double axel and
flying spin.</TE>
<TE>   Two much younger Americans, Cohen, 17, and Hughes, 16, exhibited a
better command of the ice.</TE>
<TE>   That was particularly true of Cohen, who was virtually equal with
Kwan. The Times' panel gave the edge to Kwan due to her presentation.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen built momentum early with a better than average combination
and then rated excellent for her spirals and layback spin. The Times'
awarded ultimate points for only seven elements all night. Cohen,
Slutskaya and Kwan earned two each. The other was earned by Suguri.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, skating second among the contenders behind Suguri, was
very good technically, although some judges might have marked her
down for cheating slightly on her triple lutz. Others obviously
didn't. It wasn't clear either way, even with the use of instant
replay. But her jumps in general weren't very high and her spins were
not remarkable. As for presentation, she still lacks the dynamism of
Slutskaya, Cohen and Kwan.</TE>
<TE>   The points system needs considerable work. For instance, it
doesn't reward degree of difficulty enough in the technical program.
The tie breaking process is also imperfect. But the system
potentially will cut down on bias, which is the point.</TE>

<LD>The first thing that needs to be cleared up about the Olympic sport
of skeleton is that it is not named after the late comedian named
Red.</LD>
<LD>   Red Skelton, of course, would have loved using his namesake sport
for material. After all, what sort of person would climb onto a
little sled, three feet long and 16 inches wide, and hurtle
head-first down a banked patch of ice as fast as 85 mph?</LD>
<LD>   Red would talk about how these people didn't have to worry about
head injuries because they already had some. He could poke fun at
moms and dads who take their children to toboggan runs, labeling it
child abuse.</LD>
<TE>   But for the handful of people worldwide who do this on an Olympic
level, the sport of skeleton is no joke. In fact, it was so serious
to U.S. competitors that they refused to talk to the press earlier
this week.</TE>
<TE>   They apparently have heard all those football and basketball and
baseball players, babbling on about "staying focused," whatever that
means.</TE>
<TE>   The focus for skeleton competitors will be fairly simple. Get a
fast start in your special spiked shoes, running while lugging the
70- to 115-pound sled--weight depends on the slider's body
weight--for a 50-meter sprint at the top of the run, and then somehow
plop down on it and tuck all body parts in before you hit the first
big bank.</TE>
<TE>   Your plop-down needs to be smooth. Your uniform needs to be
skintight material, usually rubber, for the best aerodynamics.</TE>
<TE>   The steering is done by shifting weight, mostly knees. Additional
steering is done by the tips of the toes, but that is more slowing
than steering, and when the tips of toes are being used a lot, time
is being lost. It helps if you have narrow shoulders, providing less
wind resistance.</TE>
<TE>   The sport is in the Olympics for only the third time, the first
time for women. It was held in previous Olympics in 1928 and 1948,
both in St. Moritz, Switzerland, site of the world-famous Cresta Run.
Interestingly, in those two Olympics, Americans won one gold and two
silvers to lead all countries.</TE>
<TE>   Percentage-wise, skeleton is the Winter Games sport in which the
United States is most dominant. Matter of fact, no other country and
only one person has ever won a silver medal in skeleton, both of
those going to John Heaton, in '28 and '48.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify for the Olympics, a competitor must be at least 18 in
the year the Games are being held. Most other Olympic sports have no
age qualification.</TE>
<TE>   Also, competitors must have competed in at least five
international events over the last two years on at least three
different tracks. That is no easy feat since there are only two
certified tracks in the United States, at Utah Olympic Park near Park
City and at Lake Placid, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Many countries are at a natural disadvantage when it comes to
skeleton. For example, how many skeleton runs do you suppose there
are in Guatemala?</TE>
<TE>   At all five international competitions, competitors must produce
results worthy of international ranking. Also, competitors' countries
must be members of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton
Federation, something the U.S. joined in 1923.</TE>
<TE>   Three U.S. men are entered, led by Jim Shea, whose grandfather and
father competed in Winter Games and whose grandfather died recently
after a car crash.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, there would have been three generations of Sheas in
Salt Lake City for the skeleton competition, two watching and one
sliding. Jim Shea will carry the funeral card from his grandfather's
service in his helmet.</TE>
<TE>   The other U.S. men entered are Lincoln Dewitt and Chris Soule; the
U.S. women are Gale Tristan and LeaAnn Parsley.</TE>
<TE>   Parsley's biography gives an indication of the type of person who
embraces this sport. Listed among her aspirations is to become a
smoke jumper, a person who parachutes into forest fires to help put
them out.</TE>
<TE>   There are no plans for future Olympics to follow the lead of luge,
which has competition in singles and doubles.</TE>
<TE>   Good thing, because doubles skeleton would be too much for Red to
resist, were he alive today.</TE>

<HD>Some Miraculous Coincidences</HD>
<DH>The U.S. faced Germany in the quarterfinals on a Wednesday
22 years ago, just as it does today. And that's only the start.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE ROSENBLOOM</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>For those who believe in miracles, here is how it might play out for
Herb Brooks' 2002 Olympic hockey team: The U.S. men play Germany in
the quarterfinals Wednesday night. Brooks' 1980 team also played
Germany, also on a Wednesday, also on Feb. 20.</LD>
<LD>   If they beat Germany, the Americans would play Russia in the
semifinals if the Russians beat the Czech Republic in their
quarterfinal. That game would be Friday. Brooks' 1980 team also
played Russia--then the Soviet Union--also in the semifinals, also on
a Friday, also on Feb. 22, and we all know how that turned out.</LD>
<LD>   You see where we're going with this?</LD>
<TE>   "There's a lot of talk about 1980 at these Games," winger John
LeClair said. But wait. There's more.</TE>
<TE>   If the U.S. men beat Russia, they could meet Finland for the gold
medal on Sunday. Brooks' 1980 team also played Finland for the gold
medal, also on a Sunday, also on Feb. 24. Think anything is lining up
in storybook fashion here for the children of the "Miracle on Ice"?</TE>
<TE>   "If that were to happen that way, that would seriously give me the
heebie-jeebies," said U.S. center Jeremy Roenick. "But I don't want
to get too far ahead. One blunder and we're out of the tournament."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, this is the medal round of the Olympics, where it's one
and done, so there is the practical matter of beating Germany. The
Germans, who emerged from the preliminary round, come in winless in
the seeding round, sandwiching an 8-2 rout by the Czechs and a 7-1
rout by the Swedes around a 3-2 loss to Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The surprising Americans enter the medal round not only as the
best offensive team but the best defensive team as well. They are
better (2-0-1) and more confident than they were in 1998 in Nagano,
Japan, when they went 1-2 in the seeding round and were eliminated in
the quarterfinals by the Czechs.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's sacrificing things for the betterment of the team,"
center Mike Modano said. "Everybody's got great skill and a great
feel for the game. But it's the little things we have to sacrifice
just to make us a better team overall defensively. If we're doing
that, we're thinking and we're skating and the lines seem to jell a
little quicker."</TE>
<TE>   Despite changing lines throughout the week, the U.S. has scored 16
goals in its three games while allowing only three. The Germans
scored only five goals in the three-game seeding round and allowed a
staggering 18. A mismatch, right?</TE>
<TE>   "Herb Brooks started talking about them the minute we got in the
room," Roenick said. "He was rip-roaring. He doesn't want us to
underestimate anyone. Before the Belarus game [an 8-1 U.S. victory],
he was all over the room about not taking anyone for granted.</TE>
<TE>   "I also think he wants to beat them for what the German coach
said."</TE>
<TE>   German Coach Hans Zach, who refused to pull his goalie for an
extra skater in the 3-2 loss to Canada, said he wanted to play the
top team in the other pool.</TE>
<TE>   Zach, who played on the German team in 1980 that lost a 2-0 lead
to Brooks' "Miracle on Ice" team--and don't think Brooks doesn't know
that--never named the United States, just the top team in the other
pool. No matter, Roenick said.</TE>
<TE>   "When [Zach] said that, it was common knowledge that we were going
to be the No. 1 team in the other pool," Roenick said. "All we had to
do was beat Belarus. I still think he was referring to us, and Herb
will use that as motivation."</TE>

<HD>Lithuanian Pair Files Protest Over Free-Dance Judging</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Another day, another accusation about unfair judging in figure
skating.</LD>
<LD>   Lithuanian ice dancers Margarita Drobiazko and Pavlas Vanagas
filed a letter of protest with the International Skating Union
Tuesday about Monday's free dance judging, saying the panel didn't
follow ISU rules regarding mandatory deductions for specific errors.</LD>
<LD>   Third-place finishers Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio of
Italy and fourth-place finishers Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz
of Canada took nasty falls but lost no ground in the standings,
remaining ahead of the fifth-place Lithuanians. Saying they felt
"dumped down," Drobiazko and Vanagas decided to capitalize on their
moment in the international spotlight to discuss problems they feel
have been rampant in ice dancing for years.</LD>
<TE>   "We really don't want any results to be reestablished," Vanagas
said, referring to the ISU's decision to declare co-gold medalists in
the disputed pairs competition. "We really don't want medals to be
put over our heads, because I think what happened at the Olympic
Games didn't have a good image for the ISU or a good image for the
Olympic Games....</TE>
<TE>   "Those who come to the rink [for competitions] know their place
before the competition, plus or minus one place. This is sad,
especially for young couples."</TE>
<TE>   They also said reforms introduced in ice dancing after the 1998
Nagano Games had done nothing to clean up the sport and contended
that bloc judging was still very much a factor.</TE>
<TE>   Vanagas also described the victory at last year's World
Championships of Fusar-Poli and Margaglio--favorites of ISU President
Ottavio Cinquanta of Italy--as "a controversial thing. That's one of
the things most coaches and athletes were thinking about."</TE>
<TE>   The Grand Prix Final two months ago, he said, was little more than
a tease. Bourne and Kraatz won, followed by Marina Anissina and
Gwendal Peizerat of France. Drobiazko and Vanagas were third,
followed by Fusar-Poli and Margaglio.</TE>
<TE>   "The Grand Prix Final was a great competition, and it was really
one of those that give athletes fresh [hope]," he said. "You felt if
you skate good, you will be judged good. If you fell, you would be
judged bad.</TE>
<TE>   "At the Grand Prix Final there was no former Soviet Union
dominance of the judges, which usually takes place when there are
former Soviet Union judges on the panel.... There are dirty-game
situations."</TE>
<TE>   Drobiazko also said she had been told not to discuss pressure put
on judges at previous competitions. "We didn't ask anybody to change
something," she said. "People feel just like sorry and say, 'Please
don't say anything.'"</TE>
<TE>   Said Vanagas: "All this pressure in the judges' stand is going on
before competitions and it is a pity."</TE>
<TE>   John Domanskis, a Newport Beach plastic surgeon who is serving as
Lithuania's Olympic attache, said the ISU's decision in the pairs
competition "added to our impetus to do something."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "We feel our athletes were deprived of a fair chance to
win a medal."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the ISU began its investigation of improprieties
in the pairs judging by interviewing Jon Jackson of San Francisco, a
judge who was witness to a conversation in a Salt Lake City hotel
lobby in which French judge Marie Reine Le Gougne allegedly said she
had made a vote-swapping deal with the Russians.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he heard an emotional Le Gougne tell Sally
Stapleford, chairwoman of the ISU's technical committee, the deal was
she would vote for the Russian pair of Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze over Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier and the
Russian ice dance judge would vote for the French duo of Marina
Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat.</TE>
<TE>   However, Le Gougne told the French sports newspaper L'Equipe she
had made no deals, and voted her conscience.</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne also told L'Equipe that Stapleford had physically
threatened her, which Stapleford denied.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Gary Bettman isn't ready to commit the NHL to a third
shutdown for the 2006 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Bettman, in Utah to watch his league's best players compete for
gold, said the NHL will evaluate the public's reaction to the Salt
Lake City Games and the players' opinions before formulating the
NHL's strategy for the next Olympics in Turin, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "While this has been so far an excellent experience, I don't know
what the future is going to hold," Bettman said. "We're going to have
to sit back and digest what happens here a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Gretzky, the executive director of Canada's hockey team,
held a news conference Tuesday in which the primary topic was ... his
news conference the previous day.</TE>
<TE>   In Monday's memorable talk session he said the Czech Republic's
Roman Hamrlik should be suspended for the rest of the tournament for
his cross-check against Canada's Theo Fleury; that everyone in the
world wants to beat Canada; excessive criticism of his team's
performance was unwarranted; and that any reports of dissension
between his players and Coach Pat Quinn are strictly "American
propaganda."</TE>
<TE>   "I have no regrets about what I said," Gretzky said Tuesday,
adding the reason he came to the podium was "I had had pretty much
enough with what I heard said about our hockey team.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like our team was getting bombarded. I just tried to stand
up for our hockey club."</TE>
<TE>   That American propaganda charge still seemed odd.</TE>
<TE>   "My kids asked me about it today," Gretzky said. "I said, 'I don't
know, I just said it.' They said, 'You know, we're American. What
does that mean?' I said, 'I don't know.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A short-track speedskater from Belarus has left the Games after a
drug test found a steroid level nearly 400 times the legal limit in
the athlete's body.</TE>
<TE>   The athlete vanished from Olympic Village housing Monday after
failing to show up for a second test.</TE>
<TE>   Officials barred the athlete from the Games pending an
investigation and punished the Belarus Olympic Committee for
allegedly helping the athlete avoid another exam.</TE>
<TE>   The Salt Lake City Games, however, remain free of a doping case
because the bag carrying the athlete's urine sample was not properly
sealed. It was broken by a lab courier in an apparent accident.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, officials decided the athlete had not technically
flunked a drug test, International Olympic Committee Executive
Director Francois Carrard said.</TE>
<TE>   The skater was identified Tuesday by Belarussian Sports and
Tourism Minister Yevgeny Vorsin as Yulia Pavlovich. He said she had
been sent home by team leadership "at her coach's suggestion," and
that the test results may have been produced by "medical help"
received from team personnel last weekend.</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>It's not every day you bump into San Bernardino's first family of
speedskating in the mosh pit of a Creed concert in Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   Team Parra, champions of the Olympics and the world by way of the
Inland Empire, were a lane change away from the headline band at
Tuesday's Medals Plaza ceremony. Although, to be honest, they were
most interested in the opening act.</LD>
<LD>   Gilbert Parra, 55, was there, clad in a white "Team Parra: Going
for Gold" sweatshirt and Olympic pin-covered cap, wiping away tears
as his son hit the stage.</LD>
<TE>   Maria McCracken, 54, was there too, nervously munching snack chips
stashed inside her parka pocket as she kept telling herself, as if
she were trying to convince a disbeliever, "My son won the gold
medal. My son won the gold medal."</TE>
<TE>   So they skewed a little older than your average Creed demographic.
So they came to the plaza, where the worlds of VH1 and "SportsCenter"
collide every night, eager to hear a more traditional standard,
lyrics written by Francis Scott Key.</TE>
<TE>   "What If."</TE>
<TE>   "My Sacrifice."</TE>
<TE>   "Higher."</TE>
<TE>   "One."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Creed's most popular singles ... or the abridged version
of the Derek Parra success story?</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Parra became the first American double
medalist at these Games by becoming the first Mexican American to win
a gold medal at the Winter Olympics. He also might have become the
shortest male speedskater to stand atop the Olympic medal
stand--research on that one still pending--and probably the first Fig
Newton fiend to break the world's 1,500-meter record.</TE>
<TE>   Standing 5 feet 4 inches in his stocking feet, Parra
out-maneuvered all the tall timber from Germany and the Netherlands
at the Utah Olympic Oval, turning in a remarkable time of 1 minute
43.95 seconds--breaking the old world record by more than a second.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember one time when I went to see Derek skate in Colorado
Springs," his mom, Maria, was saying. "This huge, tall German skater
came up to me and said, 'So, you're the one who made that little
guy?'</TE>
<TE>   "I laughed and said, 'Yes. And Derek would like to be as tall as
you.'</TE>
<TE>   "He looked at me and smiled and said, 'I would like to skate as
good as Derek.'"</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, no one else in the world was that good. That explained
what Derek was doing, warming up the audience for Creed with a gold
medal around his neck and "The Star Spangled Banner" pumping over the
sound system.</TE>
<TE>   As he received his medal from International Skating Union
President Ottavio Cinquanta, taking a break between figure skating
protests, Derek broke out in tears. So did Gilbert. So did Maria.</TE>
<TE>   "He gets that here," Maria said, patting her chest. "That's a gift
for him. He's able to express his feelings--and that takes courage.
That's what I love about him. He's not afraid to show what he is and
who he is."</TE>
<TE>   A few feet away, Gilbert blinked his reddened eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just too emotional to put into words," he said. "He's a
good-hearted boy. We're all emotional in this family. We get carried
away from time to time."</TE>
<TE>   This would be as good a time as any, considering Derek's long,
difficult road to get to that stage. Making the transition from
inline skating to long-track speedskating in 1996. Bouncing from San
Bernardino to Delaware to Milwaukee to Orlando, looking for work,
looking for training rinks.</TE>
<TE>   Getting married three years ago and having his wife Tiffany give
birth to daughter Mia on Dec. 14--two days before the U.S. Olympic
trials and a week and a half before Derek had to head overseas from
competition in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "Mia and I live in Orlando," Tiffany said, smiling. "Sometimes, so
does Derek."</TE>
<TE>   Moments after Derek received his medal, the members of Creed
lumbered onto the stage. But before the first number, lead singer
Scott Stapp called Derek out for an encore. "Come on and give it up
for an Olympic champion," Stapp told the crowd, and Parra came back
out for a few handshakes, claps on the back and another ovation,
seemingly stunned by the attention.</TE>
<TE>   "We love Creed!" Tiffany shouted. "I'm jealous. I want to be up
there with him."</TE>
<TE>   Back in San Bernardino, Gilbert imagined the party was spilling
over into Graziano's Pizza Place and the local Zendejas restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino, the world capital of speedskating.</TE>
<TE>   "It is now!" Gilbert said, beaming. "It's back on the map."</TE>
<TE>   But will they be serving Fig Newtons, Derek's favorite pre-race
fuel food, alongside the pepperoni and the burritos?</TE>
<TE>   Helping Nabisco get the post-Olympic marketing campaign rolling,
Gilbert retold the story of how Derek once ate a roll of the cookies
before an important race and won it. "Since that day," Gilbert said,
"he's been eating Fig Newtons. We try to keep him stocked."</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert and Maria are divorced and remarried, Maria now living in
Happy Camp, Calif., where she and her current husband run their own
business.</TE>
<TE>   A gold-mining club called "New 49ers."</TE>
<TE>   No kidding. According to Maria, the club travels around Northern
California, hunting for new deposits of the precious metal.</TE>
<TE>   "We dig for gold," she said, grinning as she set up the punch line
of the day, the punch line that brought Team Parra to Utah in the
first place. "And Derek got his here."</TE>

<HD>Kwan Wins the Battle but Not the Ice War</HD>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>At the risk of being drowned out by 15,600 cheers, pelted by dozens
of floral arrangements, suffocated with a flag and knocked cold by a
teddy bear, I offer these two thoughts.</LD>
<LD>   Michelle Kwan doesn't deserve to be in first place today.</LD>
<LD>   If her approach doesn't change, she might not deserve the Olympic
gold medal on Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   She could get punked by Sasha Cohen, just as she was punked four
years ago by Tara Lipinski in Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   She could get flattened by Irina Slutskaya, who has covered her in
ice chips three times in three big events this season.</TE>
<TE>   Or, she could be trampled by history, remembered as one of those
skaters who wins an Olympic gold medal only because it is her turn.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan may have been judged the best Tuesday in the Olympic women's
figure skating short program, leading by a close margin over Russia's
Slutskaya and Laguna Niguel's Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   But her performance was pure Oscar De La Hoya ...</TE>
<TE>   In the final rounds against Felix Trinidad.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan was the great fighter who has won the crowd and seemingly won
the belt, then decides to play it safe.</TE>
<TE>   Her skating was smooth and proper and beautiful. But it lacked a
flair, a glare and a finishing punch.</TE>
<TE>   All of which were evident in her two top competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Slutskaya, who finished second, soared over the rink one moment,
danced across it on one foot the next moment, then said what everyone
has been afraid to say.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel here a war on ice."</TE>
<TE>   There is a reason that four of the nine judges rated her
performance as the best.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, meanwhile, spun and twisted for two minutes, then admitted
what 5-foot-1 teenage girls rarely admit.</TE>
<TE>   "I went out there to attack."</TE>
<TE>   There is a reason that five of the nine judges rated her technical
program equal to Kwan's.</TE>
<TE>   As for the four-time world champion who has won everything but an
Olympic gold, it wasn't about attacking, but being adored.</TE>
<TE>   When Kwan took the ice after all of the other top skaters had
competed--luck of the draw--it didn't feel like a short program, it
felt like a coronation.</TE>
<TE>   The standing ovation at the Salt Lake Ice Arena lasted several
long seconds. And that was before she even started tried her first
triple lutz.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked up in the stands and it was like, 'I haven't even
started skating yet!'" she said.</TE>
<TE>   You wanna bet Slutskaya was thinking the same thing?</TE>
<TE>   "I think Americans, they like me," she said. "Of course, I'm not
the favorite like American girls."</TE>
<TE>   It was so loud, Kwan later said, "I feel America behind me."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't say much for Americans Cohen and Sarah Hughes
(fourth), but who could blame Kwan?</TE>
<TE>   Although her technical marks were not the best, each of her
artistic marks was a 5.9, as if the judges were applauding her just
for being her.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe this feeling will continue in Thursday's long program.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, even though Kwan skates fifth in the final set while
Slutskaya will be the last one to leave the ice by skating sixth,
none of that matters.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe if Kwan just stays on her feet, she gets a gold-filled
lifetime achievement award.</TE>
<TE>   But does she want to take that chance?</TE>
<TE>   Once the cheers stopped and Kwan started skating Tuesday--her
father Danny standing by the boards in place of previously fired
coach Frank Carroll--a couple of things became obvious even to the
average skating fan.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't jump the way Slutskaya jumped. She didn't dazzle the
way Cohen dazzled.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't fall, either, of course, and remember what they
say--you can't win a medal with a short program, you can only lose
one.</TE>
<TE>   But it just seemed that, on this night, Slutskaya and Cohen were
more intent on winning.</TE>
<TE>   Said Slutskaya: "I really love the competition."</TE>
<TE>   Said Cohen: "I thought to myself, 'You have one chance, I don't
want any regrets.'"</TE>
<TE>   Kwan, on the other hand, sounded more like somebody who was
already taking a victory lap.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like, 'I'm Michelle Kwan. What I've done I have no regrets.
Come here and enjoy yourself,'" she said. "I've done this a million
times. It was just like another practice."</TE>
<TE>   Then she won't blame those who thought that, at times, it sort of
looked like it.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, she poured out her amazing trademark spirals and spins.
And, yeah, after completing her triple flip, she was so excited, she
opened her mouth as if to scream.</TE>
<TE>   But all of them scream. All of them flip. All of them sparkle.</TE>
<TE>   The point of this entire event is, none of them are Michelle Kwan.</TE>
<TE>   None of them have earned an Olympic moment like this, endorsed by
America, gift-wrapped by the judges, just sitting there waiting to be
grabbed and embraced and waved high for history.</TE>
<TE>   The Torrance kid should know, it's time.</TE>

<LD>Victoria Liljenquist, who lives in Phoenix, reports that aliens are
planning a fly-by of the Olympics on Thursday between noon and 5 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not to create fear," she told the Salt Lake Tribune. "This
is a peaceful, wonderful thing."</LD>
<LD>   She said she has established a rapport with space travelers since
her first visit from them in 1994. She didn't say whether she also
hangs out with snowboarders.</LD>
<TE>   Runway Five Is Open</TE>
<TE>   People think skeleton racers are crazy for basically riding
face-first on a cafeteria tray down an ice-lined tube at speeds of up
to 85 mph, but Austrian world champion Martin Rettl says it's a
breeze compared to his day job.</TE>
<TE>   Rettl is an air-traffic controller back home in Innsbruck.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my hobby," Rettl said. "The other one is my life. And
it's very dangerous. I could kill other people; here, I can only hurt
myself."</TE>
<TE>   As an air-traffic controller, though, we might suggest Rettl
reconsider the nickname given in his Olympic athletic biography:
Crashman.</TE>
<TE>   No Couch Potato</TE>
<TE>   More skeleton: Liz Couch made the New Zealand team by answering a
newspaper advertisement that sought "fit young women with attitude."</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Oh man, this sounds amazing,'" Couch, a one-time
sprinter, said.</TE>
<TE>   Couch went to Calgary for her tryout.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved it; right from the beginning it was 'WHOA!!!' I can't
compare it to anything else. It's not as scary as it looks, it's just
a lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   Koz and Effect</TE>
<TE>   Team USA hasn't had much luck garnering Alpine medals, so maybe
it's time to turn things over to Team Koz.</TE>
<TE>   One of America's best remaining hopes for gold, silver and bronze
rests on the skis of Kristina Koznick, who trains independently from
the U.S. squad.</TE>
<TE>   Koznick, 26, will be one of the favorites in today's women's
slalom at Deer Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Koznick, from Burnsville, Minn., left the U.S. team years ago
because she became romantically involved with her coach, Dan Stripp,
a violation of team rules.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, despite her distance from the U.S. squad--"We're not invited
to train with them; we're not allowed to stay in the same
motels"--Koznick wants to make clear she's still trying to bring home
a medal for her country.</TE>
<TE>   "The only people I am competing for is the United States," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Koznick has had to pay her own bills on the World Cup circuit, yet
she is in the midst of an outstanding season, currently ranked second
in the slalom standings.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is different, I don't know if I could recommend it to
everybody unless it's in their heart," she said of going it alone.
"This year, all the struggles paid off. This year, I'm just loving
it."</TE>
<TE>   Koznick is one of the favorites to win gold, but she's certainly
not a cinch. She's had problems in the past in big events. She was
also one of the favorites in slalom at the 1998 Nagano Games, but
skied out in her second run.</TE>
<TE>   Koznick, however, says she's racing with more confidence than ever
as an independent.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm much more confident in this environment," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Koznick must also contend now with the X-factor, Croatia's Janica
Kostelic, who has already won gold and silver medals at Salt Lake.
Kostelic, the defending World Cup overall and slalom champion, had
been slowed by injuries most of the winter but is obviously back in
form.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been interesting to watch," Koznick said of Kostelic's
skiing. "It's taken time for her to get her confidence back. I think
it's good. She's a good skier and adds to the flavor of it all."</TE>
<TE>   Defensive Coordinator</TE>
<TE>   A shoulder injury dashed the Olympic dreams of a young wrestler
named Donald Rumsfeld. Now secretary of defense, his Olympic moment
arrived Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In Salt Lake City to visit troops helping in a $310-million
security effort, Rumsfeld congratulated the soldiers and spent time
with athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld stood and applauded as U.S. speedskater Derek Parra won
gold and broke a world record in the 1,500 meters.</TE>
<TE>   After the race, Rumsfeld was so excited, he called his boss.</TE>
<TE>   "I just got off the phone with the president," he said. "I told
him there was a world record set and by an American. He was more than
delighted."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said the Games so far "could not have been better," then
headed off to catch the U.S. women play Sweden in hockey. The
Americans won, 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a man who takes much time off from national
security," Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said.</TE>
<TE>   But on Tuesday, Rumsfeld seemed to catch some of the Olympic
spirit, saying there was "a wonderful feeling among all of the
countries. It's wonderful to see."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld also congratulated U.S. snowboarder Chris Klug, who was
inside an Olympic village gift shop when the secretary strolled
through.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me he was proud of me," Klug said, his medal hanging
around his neck.</TE>
<TE>   Klug competed in the Olympics 19 months after a liver transplant
and won a bronze medal in the parallel giant slalom. Klug said he's
glad to have troops patrolling the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "They keep us all safe and secure so we can get out there and do
what we love to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There are more military troops in Utah for the Games than there
are in Afghanistan. The Olympic security force includes about 4,500
military personnel, most of them from National Guard units around the
country. About 4,000 Americans are stationed in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke said Rumsfeld was close to a berth on the U.S. Olympic
wrestling team as a young man, but a separated shoulder kept him from
qualifying for the Games.</TE>
<TE>   A Lot of Benjamins</TE>
<TE>   Fred Benjamin, president of U.S. speedskating, hoped to get his
children better seats for tonight's short-track races at the Salt
Lake Ice Center.</TE>
<TE>   Then he found out that even upper-deck tickets--which his children
have--are going for up to $650 apiece. Face value is $40.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not getting into the lower decks," Benjamin said. "This
has got to be the hottest ticket at the Games, other than figure
skating."</TE>
<TE>   Sellout crowds of more than 15,000 jammed the arena for the first
two nights of short track.</TE>
<TE>   The sport's popularity intensified after Saturday night's
thrilling 1,000 meters, in which Apolo Anton Ohno was taken down in a
last-lap crash that also wiped out three other skaters.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno still picked up a silver and will be back today in the 1,500
to go for his second Olympic medal.</TE>
<TE>   Silver and Gold</TE>
<TE>   The day after rallying with a dramatic final slalom run to capture
a silver medal in the men's combined event, Bode Miller made a quick
trip to Los Angeles to appear on the "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno"
last week.</TE>
<TE>   On his way back, the plane stopped at Las Vegas and Miller had to
go through a security checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   His publicist, Rodney Corey, had the silver medal in his pocket
and set off the alarm.</TE>
<TE>   So Corey took the medal out of his pocket and placed it in a
plastic tray for inspection.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing the shiny object, a national guardsman told Corey: "Man,
that's a cool belt buckle."</TE>
<TE>   Aussie, Aussie, Aussie</TE>
<TE>   No typo, that's sun-splashed Australia with two Winter Olympics
golds, Alpine-ed Austria with one.</TE>
<TE>   "That's awesome," Alisa Camplin said. "We're a summer country, a
sunny country. But this is amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Camplin won the women's freestyle aerials Monday to give the
Aussies a second Olympic gold medal in three days.</TE>
<TE>   Australia had never won a Winter Olympic gold until Steven
Bradbury, in the easiest victory of the Games, skated past the
wreckage of four faster rivals to take the 1,000-meter speedskating
title Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Australia's only two medals so far are gold; winter sports power
Austria has 13 medals at these Games.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Wins, but Not in Top Form</HD>
<DH>The team seems to lack focus for much of its 4-0 victory
over Sweden. But the Americans' next stop is the gold-medal game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>The best weren't at their best Tuesday. As they prepared to travel
the final steps of their long journey, the pace slowed just a bit.</LD>
<LD>   The 4-0 victory over Sweden in the semifinals of the Salt Lake
Olympic tournament won't go down as one of the U.S. women's hockey
team's top performances. But it accomplished what none of the
numerous blowouts and powerful displays during the team's pre-Olympic
tour and even the first three outings at Salt Lake City could: It put
them in the long- anticipated gold-medal game against Canada on
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "Here we are," Coach Ben Smith said.</LD>
<TE>   Said U.S. forward Julie Chu: "When the buzzer went off, it hit me
that we're in the gold-medal game. It should be a great battle out
there."</TE>
<TE>   After Canada had to come back from a one-goal deficit to beat
Finland, 7-3, earlier in the day, the players were peppered with
questions about their matchup against the United States. Of course,
there still remained the small technicality that the United States
had to play Sweden. There wasn't the qualification that usually
precedes anticipated showdowns in, say, the NCAA tournament, when
reporters at least bother to ask, "If you face Team X...."</TE>
<TE>   Why bother? It would have been a better use of time to say, "If
Team USA's bus makes it to the arena on time Thursday, how do you
like your chances?"</TE>
<TE>   The Americans did not seem to be focused on Sweden on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   They looked slower, their passes weren't as crisp, their shots not
as accurate. They had only nine shots on goal in the first period,
five fewer than their previous low for the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   They weren't the focus of the fans or media, either. Their game
was up against the women's figure skating short program, another
Wayne Gretzky news conference between the second and third periods,
and a media availability session for the U.S. men's hockey team. As a
result, there were empty seats throughout the arena and the press
box.</TE>
<TE>   The E Center crowd of 7,738 finally cheered when Cammi Granato
scored Team USA's first goal from flat on her stomach. She reached
out with her stick and poked in a rebound with 2:44 remaining in the
first period. Katie King added a more conventional goal 21/2 minutes
later.</TE>
<TE>   There wasn't much to Granato's second goal. On the power play,
Jenny Potter took a slow shot that somehow squeezed by Swedish
goaltender Kim Martin and waited for Granato to knock it in.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth goal, about 13 minutes into the third period, was much
prettier. Four players touched the puck as Angela Ruggiero passed to
Granato, who passed to Krissy Wendell, who slid the puck across the
crease to Natalie Darwitz for the shot.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that in the third period, that was us," defenseman Chris
Bailey said. "The first two, maybe not. Especially the second.... You
see the way Darwitz and Granato and Wendell moved the puck, that's
the way we like to play hockey."</TE>
<TE>   As sluggish as the Americans started, at least they didn't trail.
Canada, which didn't allow a goal in the first three games of the
tournament, found itself behind Finland, 3-2, to start the third
period before rallying to set up the matchup everyone expected.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say we would have been disappointed [if Finland won],"
U.S. forward Katie King said. "I think it would have been great for
women's hockey if something new happened. At the same time, there's a
rivalry there [with Canada]. Definitely."</TE>
<TE>   They have played for the championship of every tournament that
mattered in women's hockey. The ledger stands at seven world
championships for Canada, one Olympic gold medal for the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   In playing close in defeat, at least Tuesday's losers (or, to put
a more positive spin, Thursday's bronze-medal competitors) provided a
little hope that perhaps future women's hockey tournaments won't be
so mismatched. The North American dominance is so strong that in
December the Swedish hockey federation questioned whether it would be
worthwhile to send a team.</TE>
<TE>   "We did show them that we could win," Swedish forward Maria Roth
said. "I think they'll be happy. We're really happy.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a great time. It's the greatest thing you can ever dream
of as an athlete."</TE>
<TE>   Now the Swedes can say they have a shot at the bronze, which is
the equivalent of the gold medal for the rest of the world.</TE>
<TE>   The real gold, as expected, will stay on this continent. The only
question is if it will be north or south of the border.</TE>

<HD>On Two Tracks, Americans Mine Historic Gold</HD>
<DH>First women's bobsled contest goes to Vonetta Flowers, the
first U.S. black to win Winter gold, and Jill Bakken.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY TEMKIN</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>There were Jean Racine and Gea Johnson, a soap opera in a sled.</LD>
<LD>   And there were Sandra Prokoff and Susi-Lisa Erdmann, the seemingly
unbeatable German pilots.</LD>
<LD>   Whoever dreamed that Jill Bakken, an afterthought in the
tumultuous buildup to the inaugural women's Olympic bobsled
competition, and Vonetta Flowers, a track star who had planned to
retire from sports after failing to make the U.S. 2000 Summer Games
team, would steal the spotlight Tuesday, not to mention the first
gold medal in the event?</LD>
<TE>   But Bakken, known as a gifted driver who faltered in major events,
and brakeman Flowers came up big on the biggest day in their sporting
lives.</TE>
<TE>   It topped off a day that was almost a fantasy on ice for the U.S.
women. Michelle Kwan finished the figure skating short program in
first place. Sasha Cohen and Sarah Hughes were in third and fourth
place, respectively, heading into Thursday's final. And, in hockey,
the U.S. women's team took the final step to the seemingly
inevitable: Their 4-0 win over Sweden put them in the final against
Canada on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Bakken and Flowers did their part, posting the fastest runs in
each of the two heats at Utah Olympic Park for a total time of 1
minute 37.76 seconds, a comfortable .30 of a second ahead of Prokoff
and Ulrike Holzner.</TE>
<TE>   World Cup champion Erdmann and Nicole Herschmann finished third in
1:38.29; Racine and Johnson were fifth in 1:38.73.</TE>
<TE>   The Bakken-Flowers victory had historic overtones. Flowers became
the first African American to win a Winter Games gold medal. And this
was the first U.S. bobsled medal since an American four-man team won
a bronze medal in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   The two were the last sled to race in the second heat, and when
their winning time flashed on the scoreboard, it set off a wild
celebration among the athletes, their coaches and fans.</TE>
<TE>   Bakken, 25, a Park City resident, hugged her mother, Peggy Smith,
a single mom who once took out a second mortgage on her house to help
finance her daughter's bobsled career.</TE>
<TE>   Flowers was in tears an hour later at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   "I have truly been blessed to come into this sport and pick it up
so fast," said Flowers, 28, of Helena, Ala., who got into bobsledding
in 2000 when she saw an ad posted at a track meet by a driver looking
for a brakeman. "My goal was the Summer Olympics. God had a different
plan, and I'm grateful to be here now."</TE>
<TE>   It once seemed doubtful either athlete would ascend to the top
step of the medal podium. Bakken has battled injuries throughout her
career and finished ninth on the World Cup circuit in 2000-01 and
sixth this season.</TE>
<TE>   By December, she questioned whether she and brakeman and good
friend Shauna Rohbock could generate the kind of starts crucial to
winning an Olympic medal, so she wound up teaming up with Flowers,
who had been out of the sport since October after splitting with
another driver.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, Racine, the 2000-01 World Cup champ, dropped
best friend Jen Davidson as her brakeman after the two slipped behind
Prokoff and Erdmann in this season's World Cup races. Racine added
former NCAA heptathlon champion Johnson, who was suspended in 1994
from track and field for the use of anabolic steroids.</TE>
<TE>   While Bakken escaped criticism for her brakeman switch, Racine
attracted a torrent of criticism. Much of the difference in reaction
came from the fact she and Davidson were objects of a major marketing
campaign that emphasized their friendship.</TE>
<TE>   Racine and Johnson were a medal favorite, but Johnson injured her
left hamstring Saturday, and the effect was obvious in their poor
starts Tuesday. Even at full strength, though, Johnson and Racine
might not have caught Bakken and Flowers, who set a track record of
48.81 on their first run.</TE>
<TE>   While Racine and Johnson fielded endless questions about their
respective controversies, Bakken and Flowers were happy to escape
attention until Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people saw us as the other team, and we had to come out
and prove them wrong," Flowers said.</TE>
<TE>   She had nothing to prove in making African American sports
history: She didn't realize it was there to be made until she was
asked about it.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully this will encourage other African American girls and
boys to give winter sports a try, because you don't see too many of
them out there," she said.</TE>

<HD>Kwan's One Step Away</HD>
<DH>She holds nothing back in an impressive short program to
take the lead over Russia's Slutskaya. Laguna Niguel's Sasha Cohen is
in third.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Michelle Kwan held nothing back. The judges rating her performance
Tuesday closely followed suit, putting her in position to win the
Olympic figure skating gold medal that eluded her four years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Kwan, who has second-guessed herself for not letting loose
emotionally in her silver-medal performance at the 1998 Nagano Games,
had no regrets after her impressive short program Tuesday at the Salt
Lake Ice Center. The four-time world champion and six-time U.S.
champion received a string of nine 5.9s (out of 6.0) for her
"Rachmaninov" routine, lodging her in first place by a 5-4 margin
over Russia's Irina Slutskaya after the first phase of the women's
competition.</LD>
<LD>   Sasha Cohen of Laguna Niguel was third, followed by Sarah Hughes
of Great Neck, N.Y., and Maria Butyrskaya of Russia. Any of the top
three can become the new Olympic champion by being ranked first in
Thursday's long program, which counts for two-thirds of the final
score.</LD>
<TE>   Hughes, apparently penalized for a faulty takeoff on her triple
lutz jump and coming too close to the boards in landing her triple
lutz-double loop combination jump, needs someone above her to falter
for her to win the gold. But she can still win a medal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a great competition," said Kwan, the 21-year-old
daughter of Chinese immigrants who settled in Torrance and once sold
their house to finance her training.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be tough, and it's sort of like who's the
strongest. Thursday is going to be a big night for all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Kwan was ranked first by judges from Germany, Slovakia, Denmark,
Italy and the U.S., and second by judges from Russia, Belarus,
Finland and Canada. Slutskaya, besides four first-place votes, got
two seconds and three thirds. Cohen got three second-place votes,
three thirds and three fourths, while Hughes' placements ranged from
fourth to 10th from the Russian judge.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt good. I felt really calm out there," said Kwan, who was
showered with applause from the heavily pro-American crowd. "It was
crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, second to Kwan at last month's U.S. championships,
performed a charming routine to "Sentimental Waltz." The
17-year-old's jumps were high and her spins showed off her amazing
flexibility, earning marks of 5.5 to 5.8 for the required elements
and 5.6 to 5.8 for presentation.</TE>
<TE>   "To go out there for my Olympic moment and skate clean was a dream
come true," said Cohen, a first-time Olympian who has never competed
at the world championships. "I was nervous off the ice, but once they
called my name, no butterflies. I just went out there to attack."</TE>
<TE>   Said her coach, John Nicks: "She's really at the beginning of her
career, which is a little scary, and she's going to improve
enormously over the next four years if she can keep it together
physically--and hangs on to me."</TE>
<TE>   Slutskaya, the runner-up to Kwan at last year's world
championships, displayed her virtuosity with a sequence of spirals on
one foot and hitting all her jumps cleanly.</TE>
<TE>   "I really love competition with Michelle and Sarah," said
Slutskaya, who will skate last among the top six women Thursday, just
after Cohen and Kwan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so nice. You feel here a war on ice."</TE>
<TE>   A war of nerves, too, one the principals survived in fine form.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan widened her smile after she landed her triple flip, the last
jump among the eight required elements in her 2-minute, 40-second
program. Her marks for required elements included one 5.5 from
Italian judge Paolo Pizzocari--who judged everyone severely--and
peaked at 5.9 from Slovak judge Maria Hrachovcova.</TE>
<TE>   "I've learned a lot, not just from that one experience in Nagano,"
Kwan said. "I've learned a lot over the last four years.... I just
wanted to have fun."</TE>
<TE>   That she did, eclipsing memories of her up-and-down season with a
serene, elegant performance that drew a standing ovation from the
roaring, flag-waving crowd of 15,600.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely proud to be an American," she said, "and tonight I
tried to skate from my heart, to make America proud. Seeing the
American flags was an incredible moment for me."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes drew the fifth starting position in the random draw and was
the first of the U.S. women to perform. Her "Ave Maria" routine
lacked speed, and she finished her triple lutz-double loop
combination jump perilously close to the end boards.</TE>
<TE>   Her marks ranged from 5.1 to 5.6 for the required elements and 5.5
to 5.7 for presentation, and she was placed 10th by Russian judge
Tatiana Danilenko--who placed Slutskaya ahead of Kwan and Butyrskaya
ahead of Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes' coach, Robin Wagner, said the low first marks might have
resulted from Hughes' "flutz," or incorrect takeoff on the lutz.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very strong skate," Wagner said. "It was a little slower
than I would have liked to have seen, but after the triple flip, she
loosened up."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes acknowledged she was disappointed with her first set of
marks, "coming here third in the world and skating a short program
that was clean and didn't have any major flaws ... I'm my most
important judge. I'd give myself 5.8, 5.9."</TE>
<TE>   Butyrskaya, the 1999 world champion, didn't talk to reporters. Her
required element marks ranged from 5.0 from the stingy Italian judge
to 5.7, and her presentation marks ranged from 5.5 to 5.8.</TE>
<TE>   "Maria was pleased with her performance," said her coach, Elena
Tchaikovskaya. "She skated beautifully and the judges' games
continue."</TE>
<TE>   And on Thursday, the marquee event of the Games will end.</TE>
<TE>   "To skate well was part of an Olympic dream come true for me,"
Cohen said. "We've all trained hard, and anything can happen."</TE>

<HD>Millikan Finds Easy Route Past Peninsula</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hugo Sanchez and Agustin Nunez, the best of friends off the field,
were a lethal tandem for host Long Beach Millikan High on Tuesday in
a second-round game of the Southern Section Division I boys' soccer
playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez scored three goals and Nunez had a goal and an assist as
defending champion Millikan defeated Palos Verdes Peninsula, 4-1, to
advance to the quarterfinals for the fourth time in five years.</LD>
<LD>   The third-seeded Rams (24-2-2) will play an upstart Upland team
that defeated Citrus Belt League champion Rialto, 1-0, in overtime,
on Tuesday after beating Sierra League champion Diamond Bar, 2-1, in
the first round.</LD>
<TE>   "I told the kids that this was a big win, but not that big,"
Millikan Coach Rod Petkovic said. "I told them that this puts us in
the top eight, but our next goal is to get into the top four."</TE>
<TE>   Millikan, which led, 2-1, at halftime, took command of the game at
the 59-minute mark when the 5-foot-6 Sanchez beat Peninsula
goalkeeper Brent Butler with a header off a pass from Nunez.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams scored five minutes later when Sanchez scored on a
left-footed shot off a pass from Bryan Kinnear.</TE>
<TE>   "The fourth goal was just really a great shot by that kid,"
Peninsula Coach Bruce Myhre said. "He just had a little too much room
and he just placed it perfectly into the right corner of the net."</TE>
<TE>   Millikan took a 1-0 lead at the 17-minute mark when Nunez scored
on a rebound of a blocked shot, but Peninsula (20-8-2) tied the score
two minutes later on a header by Robbie Pickard off a free kick by
Brian Selogie.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't get down at all when they scored," Sanchez said. "In
fact, that encouraged us to play that much harder."</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez's first goal of the game came six minutes later when he
beat goalkeeper Peter Dusevic on a play in which the Peninsula bench
claimed he was offsides.</TE>
<TE>   "That really upset me because that was definitely offsides," said
Myhre, who will coach at Palos Verdes High next season when it
re-opens. "But we just lost to a better team. They're very good."</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeeper Jose Barragan had five saves for Millikan.</TE>
<TE>   Dusevic had six saves for Peninsula in the first half and Butler
had two in the second as Myhre went with a two-goalie rotation that
had produced six shutouts this season.</TE>

<TE>   Alta Loma 5, Aliso Niguel 4 (OT)--Kameron Hart scored the
game-winner with two minutes remaining in the second 10-minute
overtime in a Division I second-round game at Aliso Niguel.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Davey of Aliso Niguel sent the game into overtime when his
goal in the 78th minute tied the score at 3-3.</TE>
<TE>   Brendan Duggan of Aliso Niguel (14-11-2), and Dan Larocque of Alta
Loma traded goals in the first overtime period before Hart's winning
score.</TE>
<TE>   Montebello Schurr 2, Santa Ana 2 (Schurr won on penalty kicks,
8-7)--Luis Marquez had the winning penalty kick for visiting Schurr
(16-5-2) in a Division I second-round game. Eddie Negrete and Jaime
Carillo scored in regulation for Schurr.</TE>
<TE>   Cathedral City 3, Temecula Chaparral 2--Host Cathedral City (22-3)
upset top-seeded Chaparral as Julio Alvarez kicked in the game-winner
in a Division III second-round game.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez's goal came after Cathedral City had taken a 2-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   La Palma Kennedy 2, Corona Centennial 1--Blake Calabrese scored
the winner on an assist by Danny Robinson in the 36th minute of the
Division III second-round game at Centennial.</TE>
<TE>   Centennial (22-3-1) scored first on Sergio Soto's unassisted goal
in the opening minutes, but Robinson tied the score in the 20th
minute. Scott Loveless had seven saves for Kennedy (19-3-2).</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Mater Dei 2, La Habra 0--Randy Poggio and Wayne Matthews
each scored to lead visiting Mater Dei (22-5) in a Division III
second-round game. Poggio's goal was his 27th of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Pomona Diamond Ranch 3, La Canada St. Francis 1--Mario Rodriguez
scored three goals for host Diamond Ranch (19-6), which upset
second-seeded St. Francis in a Division IV second-round game.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, who has 31 goals in 19 games, scored his final goal on
a breakaway in injury time. Carlos Marco had cut the lead to 2-1 with
three minutes remaining for St. Francis, which defeated Diamond Ranch
for the title last season.</TE>

<HD>Even With Shaq Back, There Is Much Work to Do</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First came the big foul. Then the two big free throws. And the two
big sweetly-flung net ticklers. Shaquille O'Neal did an exaggerated
wipe of his brow and mouthed "Whew," after the first. He gave the big
smile after the second.</LD>
<LD>   The big guy with the sore big toe is back on the basketball court.
And, boy, does he have his work cut out for himself.</LD>
<LD>   As the Boston Celtics kept pushing, pushing, pushing the game they
had almost always been behind in, Shaq stood near the basket waving
his arms and begging for the ball. Then he'd frown as Kobe Bryant or
Robert Horry or Derek Fisher would insist on shooting badly-aimed
jump shots.</LD>
<TE>   With 58.6 seconds left, the Celtics tied the Lakers. With 11.9
seconds left, Bryant seemed to bail them out. With 1.2 seconds left,
Antoine Walker seemed to have taught the Lakers a lesson. He banked
in a three-pointer to give the Celtics a 109-108 victory.</TE>
<TE>   With no time left, Bryant seemed to have saved the Lakers,
swishing a faking, lunging jumper. The score was on the scoreboard,
110-109. Except the officials gathered to chat and to decide the shot
was too late. Good call too, because the ball was on Bryant's
fingertips as zeroes came up.</TE>
<TE>   This is what happens when you have 21 turnovers and lose interest
in running any offense in the middle part of the game and when you
don't match the energy and enthusiasm of your achy big man.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq came back to play against the Boston Celtics. He had 25
points. The Lakers did not turn into instant champions.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time under Phil Jackson, the Lakers have lost three
games in a row.</TE>
<TE>   When the big guy is back, all the Lakers should seem a little
larger.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody should stand a little taller, with backs a little
straighter, with struts a little friskier. Instead, the other Lakers
seemed a little lazier. They moved a little slower, stood a little
smaller, slumped their shoulders and walked away losers.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq's got some work to do. The way Jackson coaches, with veiled
messages delivered through the media, with mystical memos and
convoluted concepts, he needs Shaq. He needs Shaq's big grin and big
mouth. Jackson needs Shaq to interpret his words and thoughts and
motives and ideas into winning basketball for the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   The Laker yellow seems yellower when Shaq is in the middle holding
the ball with his one big hand over his big head while all the little
people run around his legs trying to swat it away. The Laker purple
seems darker when Shaq is swinging his big behind in a swaying
sashay, clearing away the rubble of the opponent and shaking the
place to its roots when he slams home his first dunk.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoo," Shaq said and the crowd wanted to "whoo" with him.</TE>
<TE>   Everything the Lakers did seemed so little and wrong when Shaq sat
out the last five games with his cranky big toe and everything teams
such as Atlanta and Portland did seemed so big.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in a period of 38 seconds in the first quarter Shaq had his
first rim-rattling dunk, then he butted three defenders out of the
lane and made a layup plus the additional free throw and then, on the
run, he got another dunk.</TE>
<TE>   His teammates didn't respond, not for long enough. But it is
clear. Shaq will be carrying championship hopes from now until June.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq is back and the rest of the Lakers don't seem to appreciate
their blessing. They stood around or fooled around too much, heaving
up jump shot after jump shot while the Celtics kept playing hard even
when they were behind by 18 points in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Now the rest of the regular season is going to be an experiment
for Jackson and Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has said it is possible Shaq might spend another five-game
period on the injured list. Just a little toe break, a chance to give
Shaq time away from the throbbing pain.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the thing. Shaq's big, ugly, mangled, gnarly, bony toe
supports a body of gargantuan strength and mass. There's not a body
like it anywhere nor the toe invented to support that. Who knows what
the toe can take?</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes you forget how massive Shaq is. His hands are so soft
when they catch the basketball. He plays the game standing on his
toes, a graceful ballerina who could knock over small buildings with
a single grand jete.</TE>
<TE>   So it's going to be a four-month experiment in toe control. How
much can Shaq play? When should he stop? How much should he rest in
the regular season?</TE>
<TE>   Because gaining homecourt advantage in the playoffs is much less
important for the Lakers than making sure Shaq can manage the
vagaries of his toe.</TE>
<TE>   It won't matter much whether the Shaq-filled Lakers get three or
four home games per series. It also won't matter if they turn into
the Shaq-less Lakers in the playoffs because then they won't be
winning any championships.</TE>
<TE>   It will be up to Jackson and Shaq to figure out how much Shaq must
play to stay sharp and in shape without leaving him limping and
useless.</TE>
<TE>   And now that Shaq has rejoined the Lakers, it would be nice if the
Lakers rejoined Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   It would be nice if the Lakers recognized that just showing up is
not going to win them a championship, a playoff series or a
mid-February game against the Celtics. Shaq or no Shaq.</TE>

<HD>Good Reporters Always Seek the Naked Truth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A reporter, of course, is supposed to uncover things, which explains
why Lisa Guerrero apparently undid all the buttons on her blouse
before posing for the picture that is posted on
Foxsports.com--keyword "Lisa G."</LD>
<LD>   From my vantage point, I think I can say no one has to worry about
a hidden microphone on this journalist.</LD>
<LD>   I looked closer, of course, and noticed Guerrero had included an
interview with Tom Lasorda along with her provocative picture, and so
I called the dirty old man.</LD>
<TE>   Instead I got Jo, his wife, and immediately tattled on him. "Is
that the way she was dressed when she interviewed Tommy?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   I honestly didn't know, but I told her, "Yes," only sorry I
couldn't listen later when Lasorda called his wife from Vero Beach to
find out if everything was OK.</TE>
<TE>   I'M NOT happy when my two daughters want to wear two-piece bathing
suits, and I'm constantly telling my wife to put her clothes back on.
But they aren't journalists trying to get the attention of coaches
and athletes, and I'll bet you Mike Garrett and Kevin Brown talk to
Guerrero whenever she wants.</TE>
<TE>   I understand Sports Illustrated has its swimsuit issue, and NBC
went with Playmates at halftime of the Super Bowl. But I don't recall
any Web site, magazine or legitimate media outlet giving us a
cheesecake gander at one of their very own journalists like this.
"Look," said Ross Levinsohn, general manager of Foxsports.com, and I
told him I had been looking, for the last three hours.</TE>
<TE>   "There are far worse pictures on the Web of people involved in
sports and entertainment," Levinsohn said. I asked for a detailed
list.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I CALLED two female reporters at Fox, and the one who obviously
doesn't wear a brassiere called back. I'll let you guess who the
other one was.</TE>
<TE>   "The picture is definitely provocative," Guerrero said. "I picked
the picture because I think it shows a strong, sexy, confident woman,
and I'm comfortable with myself. I don't try to be a soccer mom. I
embrace my femininity and I think that sets me apart from the masses
in the locker room."</TE>
<TE>   I'll have to be honest, I've been in a lot of locker rooms, and
she's right--I have yet to see anyone else embrace their femininity.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Lisa is putting herself out there like she's
Madeline Albright or Janet Reno," said Levinsohn, and this guy sure
knows how to kill the mood. "She has creative control of the Web
site, and feels like the Web is a good place to express herself, and
we're here to support her."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't appear to me she needed any support. "I'm not doing this
for my fellow journalists--my dad is extremely proud of me and that's
all that matters," she said. "He told me, 'Don't catch a chest cold,'
so he has a sense of humor about it."</TE>
<TE>   I know I was feeling warm, so I told her there was no reason to
cover up. I think it's the responsibility of all journalists to help
each other like that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GUERRERO IS the main news anchor for "The Best Damn Sports Show
Period" on Fox Sports Net, so you know how talented she is.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping the lasting image goes beyond the cleavage," she said,
"and people look at me like I'm actually a sportscaster." Just like
Tom Arnold.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Lisa is having fun with this," Levinsohn said. "Frankly
she brings a more interesting perspective than most people who work
at Fox, because she's a female, and an attractive female in sports."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure if Levinsohn was telling me all the men who work at
Fox are dull, and she's more interesting than the unattractive women
there, but I'm sure that will make for interesting talk around the
Fox water cooler this morning.</TE>
<TE>   There's no question for some time Guerrero has caught the
attention of Larry Stewart, our sports TV critic, who wrote long
before she unbuttoned her blouse for Foxsports.com: "Lisa Guerrero is
more than just a pretty face." Somehow he knew.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero told me she's on the air more than most anybody in the
country what with all the national updates she does for Fox Sports
Net, and I think I can say I've seen more of her than any other
female journalist I know.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Guerrero, Fox's journalistic-minded site is now
flashing a series of come-hither looks from Anna Kournikova with this
invite: "Win a trip to see Anna K pose in paradise." This might
explain why "The SIMERS Show" is about to go off the air, because
contestants are not eligible to spend time with Anna in paradise if
they are presently employed by Fox.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN.com and CBS.sportsline.com might give you facts and scores,
but Foxsports.com offers something called "Lisa's Links," with a
picture of hard-hitting reporter Lisa Dergan wearing a very nice
white sweater that apparently shrank the last time she washed it. I
would think she'd have trouble breathing.... I know I did.</TE>
<TE>   You can click on Dergan's photo gallery, which I'm told includes
the only seven pictures of her on the Internet wearing clothes.
Apparently Playboy's Miss July 1998 appears everywhere else on the
Internet without tape recorder, notebook or anything else.</TE>
<TE>   When I asked Levinsohn if we would be seeing more of journalist
Dergan on Foxsports.com, he told me her appearance on the site was no
different than the space dedicated to John Madden.</TE>
<TE>   I asked Levinsohn if Madden had a photo gallery, and whether it
included Albright and Reno, because you just don't know with Fox
these days.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from David Pragasam:</TE>
<TE>   "How dare someone be so dismissive of players with so much talent.
Have you ever hit a golf ball, Mr. Simers?"</TE>
<TE>   I played with a pro the other day, and let me tell you, I hit the
ball more often than he did.</TE>

<HD>Charissis Has a Broken Ankle</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>X-rays taken Tuesday morning showed that Trojan center Kostas
Charissis has a broken bone in  his left ankle. The 6-foot-11,
250-pound junior, who had started  18 consecutive  games, is expected
to be sidelined  at least four weeks, though USC officials are hoping
to have him back in time for the postseason.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been frustrating," said Charissis, who injured himself
during pregame warmups Saturday when he went up for a rebound and
came down on a wayward basketball. He played only the first four
minutes of the Trojans' 94-89 victory over Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   Charissis has battled ankle and Achilles' heel problems this
season.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not a stress fracture which occurs over time of a repeated
[pounding]," USC athletic trainer Thomas Mallete said, calling it a
nondisplaced fracture. "It's an acute injury.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got some bone stimulation [working] and the goal is to get
him back by the [NCAA] tournament, but it will be a tight squeeze."</TE>
<TE>   Charissis, who  served a three-game suspension at the beginning of
the season  after it was discovered he had played on a team with
professionals in his native Greece, is averaging 2.3 points in 10.4
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   With Charissis out, it would seem natural for the No. 20 Trojans
to start 6-foot-11, 220-pound freshman Rory O'Neil at center Thursday
at No. 10 Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   But Coach Henry Bibby wasn't so sure.</TE>
<TE>   "He's better for us right now coming off the bench, giving us that
spark," Bibby said of O'Neil, who had a career-high 14 points on
seven-of-nine shooting with two blocks in 24 minutes of USC's 90-82
victory  over the Cardinal on Jan. 26.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably our best offensive player coming off the bench at
that size so, more than likely, to rule people out from starting, he
would probably be the one guy that I would rule out if I was playing
today."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neil said he's comfortable either starting or coming off the
bench, as did 6-foot-8 freshman Nick Curtis, who started three of
USC's first five games and may start at Stanford.</TE>

<HD>Jones' Role as Official, Campaigner Entwine</HD>
<DH>Profile: Foe of big spending got farm subsidies of $400,000. He is
praised for job as secretary of state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The three lives of Secretary of State Bill Jones--as family farmer,
as public official and now as candidate for governor--have intertwined in
complex and at times unexpected ways.</LD>
<LD>   Jones, the only Republican statewide officeholder, is a conservative
when it comes to government spending and social programs, but he has
received about $400,000 in federal agricultural subsidies during the past
five years.</LD>
<LD>   Jones prides himself as a campaign finance reformer. But, struggling
to raise money beyond his Central Valley base, his campaign has resorted
to some unusual gambits to reach potential supporters. In one, his
campaign used a mailing list of donors provided by a museum that has
close ties to Jones' office--a move that drew fire from political
opponents.</LD>
<TE>   Aggressively using the power of incumbency, Jones also has enhanced
his name recognition and won endorsements through his office's voter
outreach. At taxpayer expense he sends out 18th birthday cards with voter
registration forms to 30,000 Californians each month. And he recently
launched a high-profile patriotic program to increase turnout in the
March 5 primary, when Jones faces two better-funded GOP rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Any political benefit from his official duties is incidental and
unintended, Jones said in an interview. "Exposure of any type from
someone in political office is always useful to them if they are seeking
to run for another office," he said. "But . . . my record on outreach
goes back to the first year we were on this job and . . . I was not
intending necessarily to run for governor."</TE>
<TE>   Now that he is running, Jones said he has one major advantage over his
Republican opponents--former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and Los
Angeles businessman Bill Simon Jr. That's his statehouse experience,
first as an assemblyman for 12 years, then as secretary for two terms.</TE>
<TE>Sowing the Seeds for Higher Office</TE>
<TE>   He withdrew from day-to-day stewardship of his family's farms two
decades ago, and has forged ahead as an elected official, working
farmer's hours, tending his agricultural constituency and achieving
political milestones.</TE>
<TE>   He lost his first campaign for the Assembly, but won a seat in 1982,
despite a gun accident that left him with a leg wound and prompted jokes
about "the politician who shot himself in the foot."</TE>
<TE>   He became leader of the GOP Assembly caucus and led a reapportionment
effort, only to step down a year later after Republicans did not pick up
anticipated seats in the 1992 election.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, a tall, sturdy man of 52 with a stern demeanor, perhaps is best
known as author of the 1994 three-strikes law that toughened sentencing
for repeat offenders. The law was inspired by the shooting death of the
daughter of Mike Reynolds, a Fresno wedding photographer.</TE>
<TE>   What stands out about Jones, according to Reynolds, is that he is so
direct and forthcoming. "People who know him say he's too nice to get
into a dirty business like politics," Reynolds said. "Politicians have a
dark side to them. But he really is the caliber of person you wouldn't
mind having as a neighbor."</TE>
<TE>   Jones prefers free enterprise over big government, personal initiative
over social welfare. He voted in the mid-1990s against Assembly bills
increasing meals for students in summer school and expanding eligibility
for the school breakfast program. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he
cast pro-business votes against legislation requiring employers to
provide unpaid family and medical leave of up to four months.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, however, has accepted federal money available to him.</TE>
<TE>   For three generations, Jones' family has worked land where they now
operate a cattle feed lot and raise crops such as tomatoes, asparagus,
alfalfa and cotton.</TE>
<TE>   His most recent financial disclosure statement shows he holds an
interest in Llanada Farms, Jones-Villere Farms and Sarek Farms in
Firebaugh near Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Figures obtained through the Freedom of Information Act show that the
farms owned by Jones and several relatives operate almost 5,000 acres.
Since 1996, Jones' share of U.S. Department of Agriculture subsidies to
them amounted to about $400,000--roughly a sixth of about $2.5 million
paid to the farms. That collectively would make the farms one of the
largest recipients in the state, according to the nonprofit Environmental
Working Group in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said his share went back into the farm operations, not to him
personally. (His disclosure forms for 2000 place the value of his stake
in the farms at $300,000 to $3 million, and his farm-related annual
income and consulting fees at $60,000 to $600,000.)</TE>
<TE>   Jones said there is no inconsistency between his acceptance of funds
from such programs--long criticized by some as welfare for agricultural
interests--and his rejection of some social programs. "Farm policies," he
said, "were designed to keep agriculture competitive [with foreign
products] and viable."</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture has been a mainstay of Jones' political, as well as
personal, life. His father was a member of the state water commission
under Gov. Ronald Reagan. His agricultural fraternity drafted Jones for a
successful run for student senate at Cal State Fresno, where he later was
elected student body president.</TE>
<TE>   Water policy and agricultural trade were key elements in his
legislative agenda, and financial support from the farming interests
remains an important part of his war chest for governor. JG Boswell Co.
donated more than $17,000 and the California Farm Bureau Federation
political action committee gave $25,000. When the 95,000-member bureau
endorsed him, its president called him "one of us."</TE>
<TE>   Unveiling his agricultural plank in October, Jones warned that
California's next crisis will be over water, and he called for improved
water supply and storage networks. And he said excessively stringent
labor, employer and environmental laws are harming farm production. "Far
too often, politically motivated laws and regulations aimed at special
interests are fully enforced," he said.</TE>
<TE>Bipartisan Praise Along With Criticism</TE>
<TE>   Jones came into statewide office riding a GOP landslide and his
three-strikes momentum, in the process proving wrong pundits who said no
one outside an urban center could win statewide office. And he was
reelected secretary of state--though narrowly--in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has critics, Jones has won praise from many people for
helping bring the office into the 21st century by instituting on-line
voter registration and improving electronic vote results, the Web site
and access to campaign contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Democrat Tony Miller, who almost beat Jones in 1994 and is now running
former longtime secretary of state March Fong Eu's campaign to retake the
office, said he thinks Jones "has done a credible job as secretary."</TE>
<TE>   But Miller criticizes him for not moving more quickly to eliminate
punch card ballots like those involved in the Florida presidential voting
fiasco. Jones wanted punch cards in California to be phased out by July
2005. However, a federal judge last week ruled that they have to be
replaced by the 2004 presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said it would have been "premature" to make the transition years
ago because the new machinery was untested and much more expensive than
today.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Knox, the executive director of Common Cause, said Jones has
generally favored weaker campaign contribution limits than the watchdog
group would like to see. But he said Jones overall has been a "very
strong" secretary of state, despite some kinks in his office's
implementation of campaign contribution reporting systems.</TE>
<TE>   Some fault him for placing too much emphasis on voter fraud and not
enough on registration and turnout. Jones said he has tried to balance
the two in pursuing his motto: 100% participation and zero fraud. His
fraud unit has seven employees, his outreach unit eight, plus student
assistants.</TE>
<TE>   A number of registrars credit Jones with providing support and
leadership in eliminating "deadwood" on the local rolls, such as people
who have died or moved and reregistered elsewhere. His office said the
removal of more than 2 million ineligible voters saves up to $10 million
each election on printing and administrative costs.</TE>
<TE>   "He instituted a number of reforms and improved the integrity of the
process because he's vigilant about pursuing and prosecuting fraud
cases," said Mischelle Townsend, Riverside County's registrar and a board
member of the California Assn. of Clerks and Elections Officials.</TE>
<TE>   The fraud unit formed by Jones has referred more than 190 cases to
prosecutors since 1995. Thirty-two investigations have resulted in
convictions since 1998, the vast majority involving individuals who
forged names on petitions or voter registration cards they were being
paid to collect.</TE>
<TE>   Detractors say relatively few cases of vote fraud have been
proven--Jones' office reports two convictions for fraudulent or double
voting in the past three years.</TE>
<TE>   "His emphasis is on fraud, and there's just not much of it," said Ken
Pettit, Santa Barbara County registrar. "He should spend money on getting
people to the polls and . . . find out why people do not vote."</TE>
<TE>   Jones said the integrity of the election process starts with valid
registrations, so bogus ones made by "bounty hunters" who are paid to
collect them constitute more than an economic crime. "Deadwood decreases
voter turnout [percentages] and increases the cost of the elections and
increases the potential for fraud," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of fraud gained prominence early in Jones' tenure. After
Democrat Loretta Sanchez narrowly unseated Republican Rep. Robert K.
Dornan in 1996, allegations of illegal voting by immigrants exploded in
Orange County. Jones said his office documented that hundreds of
noncitizens were registered to vote, but there were no criminal
indictments. Congress conducted a separate investigation, but the
election results stood.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was caught between the Latino community and some in his own
party who wanted to crack down to boost Dornan's chances of challenging
the results. "We were conscious of not inflaming the rhetoric," said
Jones spokeswoman Beth Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Vaquerano, executive director of the Salvadoran American
Leadership and Educational Fund in Los Angeles, is on Jones' official
advisory board. "He's been very good in reaching out to Latino voters,"
he said. "Definitely voter registration has increased dramatically."</TE>
<TE>   Voter outreach, which often includes personal appearances by Jones,
helped win him the endorsement of the Spanish-language daily newspaper La
Opinion when he ran for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   His office distributed registration cards at grocery stores and
citizenship swearing-in ceremonies. It launched an online registration
card before the November 2000 election. And it reached out to specific
voter targets: shoppers, students, athletic club members, even pet
owners.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Jones' efforts, turnout that year was about 70%, or 10% short
of his goal.</TE>
<TE>   This election cycle, Jones tried to tap into the patriotic fervor
following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks by launching a voter
registration effort called Vote America with Senate President Pro Tem
John Burton (D-San Francisco).</TE>
<TE>   Coming as his gubernatorial campaign accelerated, the effort served a
dual purpose for Jones, said San Mateo County Registrar of Voters Warren
Slocum, a Democrat. "We would be naive to think it was based on one idea
or purpose. One was to promote the idea of getting more people
registered. I think part was to promote Bill Jones."</TE>
<TE>   The program, Jones' idea, illustrates how closely entwined his
official duties and a campaign can become. He sent Beth Miller, who had
left the secretary of state's office to handle media for the campaign,
back to the state office to run Vote America. She also was promoted to
Jones' chief assistant.</TE>
<TE>   "Beth was the best one to do that [job]," said Jones, adding that it
is not uncommon for public officials to shuttle state employees to their
campaigns and back.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid the appearance of capitalizing on the outreach campaign,
Jones said, he has taken pains to keep his name off flags and billboards.
"I have tried to be very judicious about making those calls," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Voter outreach can be good for the state and good for the public
official, according to Robert M. Stern, president of the Center for
Governmental Studies in Los Angeles and former general counsel for the
state's political watchdog agency.</TE>
<TE>Going for Broke Amid Fund-Raising Problems</TE>
<TE>   Stern praises Jones' job performance, especially his technological
advances, but says he is troubled by one of his outreach methods--sending
birthday cards with voter registration forms to 18-year-olds at public
expense. While the activity appears to be legal, he said, Jones
unnecessarily promoted himself by using his name prominently on the cards
designed by the nonprofit Rock the Vote, which is dedicated to increasing
the youth vote.</TE>
<TE>   Jones dismisses the criticism: "Why doesn't he want to take my name
off the front of the ballot pamphlet? It just went out to 8.5 million or
however many households. What about the governor? Is his name not on
everything?"</TE>
<TE>   Free public exposure is particularly important to Jones because of the
difficulties faced by his gubernatorial campaign. He is lagging his two
top Republican rivals in fund-raising, campaign reports show. As of Jan.
19, Jones had on hand $1.1 million, compared to Simon's $1.28 million and
Riordan's $2.3 million. Between then and this week, Jones raised more
than $343,000, while Riordan added $2 million and Simon $2.38 million.</TE>
<TE>   Donation records show about three-quarters of Jones' top 20 corporate
and individual benefactors come from the Central Valley and other
agricultural regions. He loaned his campaign $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' fund-raising, consultants say, probably has been hurt by his
decision to switch his endorsement from George W. Bush to Arizona Sen.
John McCain, a campaign finance reformer, in the last GOP presidential
primary.</TE>
<TE>   "He's fighting an uphill battle, no question," said Dan Schnur, a
former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson and Riordan. "His biggest obstacle in the
campaign is self-imposed. . . . He ran the secretary of state's office
the way it is supposed to be run--as a nonpartisan, above-the-fray
decision-maker. . . . That's not a very good way to develop political
support within your own party."</TE>
<TE>   Jones has been criticized during the gubernatorial campaign over how
he has handled his job. He took a leading role in alleging conflicts of
interest by Gov. Gray Davis' advisors during the energy crisis. But
Davis' aides countered with allegations that Jones was using his office
staff and resources improperly to collect the political ammunition
against the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said the role was a proper one because as secretary of state, he
has a seat on the Fair Political Practices Commission, which enforces
campaign laws, and his office oversees campaign finance reporting. "If he
wants to compare his debacle on the energy crisis . . . versus who I use
for research, I'll take that question to the voters," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But questions have also been raised about other Jones campaign
tactics.</TE>
<TE>   In November, the San Jose Mercury News reported that the Golden State
Museum, adjoining the secretary of state's office building, gave its
fund-raising list to a campaign consultant for Jones, who oversees the
state archives and serves on the museum board.</TE>
<TE>   Former Jones campaign consultant Carla Eudy of Washington told The
Times recently that she recalls that campaign manager Rob Lapsley told
her about the list, containing about 400 names. She said she then asked
the museum for the list and the campaign used it for one Jones mailer
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Lapsley, the secretary's former chief of staff, denied telling Eudy
about the list. Both he and Jones said there was no favoritism involved
because any candidate could have received the donor list.</TE>
<TE>   The museum denied that it violated its nonprofit, tax-exempt status by
helping a political campaign. However, after consulting with attorneys,
museum officials retroactively charged the Jones campaign $100 for the
list and offered it to other gubernatorial candidates at the same price.
There were no takers among the major candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairman Michael Livingston defended Jones. "Bill has done a
tremendous amount of fund-raising on behalf of the museum as secretary of
state, and part of it is that you share a list of potential donors with
Bill," he said. "We're probably not politically astute about all the
regulations out there."</TE>
<TE>   The Jones campaign came under criticism again in December, when it
sent out uninvited e-mails to drum up contributions. "I'm Bill Jones and
I need your support for governor," said the e-mail, which was first
reported on MSNBC's Web site. Then it listed some accomplishments and
invited recipients to visit Jones' campaign Web site.</TE>
<TE>   One recipient was Tom Geller, executive director of a San Francisco
nonprofit called SpamCon Foundation that is dedicated to stamping out
unwanted e-mail. The political message, he told The Times, is probably
legal because California's anti-spam laws focus on commercial messages.
But he added, "There is no question it's improper" and violates the
spirit of the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Jones referred questions to Lapsley, who said that out of 30,000
e-mails, there were only two complaints but thousands of visits to the
campaign Web site. The advantage of using e-mail, he said, is that it
costs much less than a traditional paper mailer.</TE>
<TE>   "If we thought we were doing something inappropriate, we would not
have sent them," Lapsley said.</TE>

<HD>It's Like Getting Fleeced</HD>
<DH>Cotton mill workers at a Martinsville, Va., firm will soon be
joining the thousands of U.S. textile workers left behind in a landscape
of plants closed by globalization.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MARTINSVILLE, Va.
</DL>
<LD>Some people climb mountains. Margaret Blankenship has sewn one--out
of sweatpants, 21,565,440 pairs of them, to be exact.</LD>
<LD>   Every single workday for the last 36 years, the bundles of fuzzy
cotton kept coming and Blankenship kept stitching, making more sweatpants
along the line at the VF Imagewear factory than anybody in company
history.</LD>
<LD>   But recently she got laid off. VF is ceasing operations here, the
latest in a long list of Southern textile mills to succumb to the pull of
globalization. And Martinsville, once the sweatshirt and sweatpants
capital of the world, is fast approaching its last batch of fleece.</LD>
<TE>   For years, these mills had eluded obsolescence with an iron-hard work
ethic and investments in technology that kept production costs
competitive. No more. Just as the textile industry left New England for
the South 80 years ago, it's now shipping off for Mexico, Honduras, even
Pakistan, thanks to looser trade laws.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of middle-aged, minimally educated American textile workers
have been left behind in a landscape of shuttered plants and cool
smokestacks.</TE>
<TE>   The lintheads, as they were once called, have few prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "Dreams? Ambitions? Goals?" Blankenship asked, as if she were talking
about foreign lands. "It's funny, but I've never thought about them. I
always figured I'd be sewing."</TE>
<TE>   It's the same old story, one that many American steel workers or toy
makers could tell.</TE>
<TE>   But the last decade has been especially harsh on the textile industry,
which includes both cloth manufacturing and garment making, with 441,000
jobs disappearing, a loss of 44%. Last year, 110 mills shut (most of them
in the South), 68,000 workers were laid off and several of the largest
companies filed for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so sad," said Judy Brooks, a bank manager in Andrews, N.C.,
where a Lee jeans plant just closed. "I got people calling up, telling
me, 'Just come and get it. I can't pay for my car no more.' "</TE>
<TE>   Few places have been as hard hit as Martinsville and surrounding Henry
County, along the Virginia-North Carolina border. In the last eight
years, the area has lost 9,360 jobs, forcing county leaders to consider
closing four schools because tax revenues are plummeting and folks are
leaving.</TE>
<TE>   From red-brick factories looming over the hilltops and along the
churning rivers, Martinsville used to produce wooden furniture, auto
parts, grandfather clocks and more sweatshirts and nylon than anywhere
else in the world. Its neighborhoods are lined with graceful Tudor
homes--mill manager homes--and downtown there's an arts center and
history museum, symbols of a grander day.</TE>
<TE>   Now, abandoned trailers sulk outside the old Tultex plant, the DuPont
factory is essentially a bulldozer practice pit and Bassett Chair Co.,
once home to the Chateau Marseille dinette set, is roped off with yellow
police tape.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Martinsville was the first place Virginia's new governor,
Democrat Mark Warner, mentioned in his commonwealth address when he got
to the part about towns "getting left behind."</TE>
<TE>   But people here are trying to catch up, at least as best they can.
Thick-handed mill workers are learning to type, others commute miles to
new jobs and a big new Mexican restaurant--a sign of the changing
times--is going up on Memorial Boulevard, the main strip through town.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it was the end of the world when tobacco left," said town
historian Carl DeHart. "But then we got textiles. Who knows what's next?"</TE>
<TE>   Drawn by plentiful labor, few unions, low taxes and abundant
hydroelectric power, Yankee firms began relocating to Virginia in the
1920s. Martinsville's first mill, Pannill Knitting Co., opened in 1925.
It made sweatshirts.</TE>
<TE>'Sweatshirt Capital' Relinquishes Title</TE>
<TE>   The textile industry peaked during World War II, when 1.3 million
workers, mostly women, were swept into factories to sew parachutes,
sweats, combat fatigues and other goods. They were called lintheads,
because the fabric fibers that swirled in the air dusted their clothes,
skin and hair.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, someone in the Martinsville Chamber of Commerce
realized the town of 20,000 was producing more sweatshirts than anywhere
else and coined the motto, "Martinsville, Va.-- Sweatshirt Capital of the
World."</TE>
<TE>   It stuck. In 1989, civic leaders celebrated the opening of a new mall
by printing banners with that motto.</TE>
<TE>   Up until the early 1990s, the town's five major mills produced 75% of
the world's sweatshirts. VF, the largest employer for miles, had its best
year as late as 1996 when it made 70 million pounds of sweatshirt and
T-shirt cloth for companies such as Nike, Sears and J.C. Penney.</TE>
<TE>   American companies had kept themselves relevant by specializing in
products such as nylon and fleece wear and developing high-tech machines
such as the "napper," a computer-controlled contraption that whips
sweatshirt fabric with wire brushes to make it fuzzy. VF, a $5.8-billion
international corporation, invested $25 million in the last five years
for new machines in Martinsville.</TE>
<TE>   But starting in the mid-1990s, with the passage of the North American
Free Trade Agreement, these companies began to suffer from foreign
competition and falling prices. The more labor-intensive apparel work
went first, with sewing shops moving to Mexico. The textile industry has
two components: textiles, the business of knitting, dying and cutting
cloth; and apparel, the assembly or sewing stage. Many companies do both
and labor statistics tend to group textiles and apparel together.</TE>
<TE>   After the Asian financial crisis of 1997, which devalued currencies,
overseas textiles became even cheaper.</TE>
<TE>   The final blow was the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, according to
textile lobbyists, which left the industry with the bleakest outlook
since the Great Depression. Since 9/11, 42 mills have closed or announced
closings, including VF, the last of the sweatshirt makers in
Martinsville.</TE>
<TE>   Also, President Bush is under pressure to lift textile tariffs on
Pakistan, the third largest cloth maker in the world, as a way to say
thanks for the country's help in fighting terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry is doomed," said Wayne Hill, VF's vice president of
textiles. "We used to compete against the mill down the street. Now we're
up against the world."</TE>
<TE>   Today, 85% of VF's manufacturing jobs are offshore, compared to 20%
just six years ago. Since 1997, VF has added 13,000 employees in Mexico
and Honduras, while cutting 24,000 jobs in the United States. The company
is paring its domestic operations to a handful of mills in the South.</TE>
<TE>   "It's four to five times cheaper to make sweatshirts offshore," said
Cindy Knoebel, a VF spokeswoman. "We don't have a choice."</TE>
<TE>   These business realities leave huge holes in communities like
Martinsville.</TE>
<TE>   Blankenship had built a life around the yellow-brick sweatpants
factory where she labored from March 9, 1966, before graduating high
school, to Dec. 12, 2001, when she was laid off.</TE>
<TE>   She played third base for the factory softball squad, won "pace
setter" awards for speedy stitching and spent hours kibitzing with other
women--as cloth raced through their hands--about husbands, children,
hopes and fears. Sometimes, when she was feeling inspired, she averaged
as much as $11.39 an hour. (Like most textile workers, she was paid by
the piece, explaining how she knows the number of sweatpants she made.)</TE>
<TE>   Her eyes glow when she thinks of these days.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked real good there," said Blankenship, who's 53 years old. Then
she began to cry.</TE>
<TE>   Her employment officer, Pat Gusler, tried to cheer her up during a
recent advisory session.</TE>
<TE>   "Miss Margaret, I'm not sure what we're going to do with you, but
we'll find something."</TE>
<TE>Advisor Seeks Industry, Industry, Industry</TE>
<TE>   Across town in a new office in the Henry County government center,
Wayne Sterling is looking for that something.</TE>
<TE>   The county hired him in November as an economic development advisor
for $200,000 a year, more than twice the next-highest paid official and
about 10 times the earnings of a veteran mill worker.</TE>
<TE>   Sterling is best known for leading the team that persuaded BMW to
locate its first North American production plant in Spartanburg, S.C.,
which provided 4,000 jobs. He also helped attract $6.2 billion in
investment capital in the five years he headed the Virginia Economic
Development Partnership.</TE>
<TE>   His philosophy is industry, industry and more industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we chasing the wrong thing?" Sterling asked. "I don't think so.
Our people have worked with their hands for generations. They understand
the culture of shift work."</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to talk about jobs in Martinsville without Sterling's name
coming up, whether in the halls of the county center, at the employment
office or during lunch at the D &amp; A cafe, where a plate of chicken and
taters costs $3.90 and people who don't know each other cram into booths
and swap stories about getting laid off.</TE>
<TE>   "Wayne better produce," DeHart said, "unless he thinks he looks good
in tar and feathers."</TE>
<TE>   Martinsville's leaders are bracing themselves for the summer, when the
last of VF's 2,300 textile workers are let go and the jobless rate is
expected to hit 20%.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's be honest," said Tim Hall, Henry County spokesman. "Most of our
people are not ready to step into some new economy gig."</TE>
<TE>   There are other problems too. Martinsville's population is beginning
to slip, from 21,000 in the 1960s to 16,162 in 1990 and 15,416 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see people deciding: Do I stay or do I go?" said Sharon
Dodson, superintendent of schools.</TE>
<TE>   The school population is falling even faster, a 37% drop in the last
25 years. After VF announced it was closing, taking with it $1.3 million
in tax revenue, county officials said they need to shut one special
education and three elementary schools and consolidate two high schools.</TE>
<TE>   Many parents and teachers say the proposal is premature, and they're
trying to block it.</TE>
<TE>   "We like our schools, our sense of community," said Jody Dalton, a
Martinsville schoolteacher. "We don't want to become a retirement town."</TE>
<TE>Race Issues Provide Uncomfortable Subtext</TE>
<TE>   Dodson said the unspoken issue is race. The county is 74% white, 23%
black, with a small but growing Latino population. The textile industry
used to be all white but that changed in the last 30 years, bringing more
people of color to the area.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember, this is still the South, and we're trying to combine a
majority black high school with a majority white one," Dodson said.
"There's apprehension on both sides."</TE>
<TE>   Few in Martinsville ever imagined it would come down to this: silent,
padlocked mills and the town contemplating life without them.</TE>
<TE>   Many can't let go. Blankenship's mother still pulls a 10-hour shift in
a furniture factory, sanding chair backs. She's 75 years old.</TE>
<TE>   "And when I asked her if I could take her job," Blankenship said, "she
looked me straight in the eye and said, 'I love you, honey. But no way.'

<HD>U.S. Polishes Off Its 21st Medal</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Two golds, including speed skater Derek Parra's, set a
U.S. record.</DH>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>U.S. athletes won two more gold medals in speed skating and
bobsledding Tuesday, easily setting a U.S. record haul for the Winter
Olympics and positioning the U.S. to far surpass its wildest golden
dreams.</LD>
<LD>   The unprecedented success of U.S. athletes at these Winter
Olympics--reaching 21 medals here Tuesday with gold medals by Derek Parra
in speed skating and an unexpected win by U.S. women bobsledders Vonetta
Flowers and Jill Bakken--was born out of U.S. failure and embarrassment
at the '88 Games in Calgary.</LD>
<LD>   It was there that U.S. winter athletes won just six medals and only
one gold. And it was there that the United States Olympic Committee vowed
to move quickly, establishing a special advisory board that became known
immediately as the Steinbrenner Commission, named after the flamboyant,
no-nonsense owner of the New York Yankees who became its chairman.</LD>
<TE>   Its mission was to do what its chairman was known for doing best: Play
hardball. It was no longer enough for athletes to make the Olympic teams,
Steinbrenner intoned in February 1989, they needed to bring home the
gold.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 14 years and with many millions of dollars plunged into
training, developing a diverse talent pool and financially supporting its
athletes, the USOC watched the progress: 11 medals at Albertville in
1992, 13 each in Lillehammer in '94 and Nagano in '98.</TE>
<TE>   They became so confident that they predicted "at least 20 medals"
here.</TE>
<TE>   "Doggone if it hasn't happened," USOC spokesman Mike Moran said
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   A healthy measure of the U.S. success has come in sports added in
recent years to the Olympic program. Seven of the 21 U.S. medals, for
instance, were won in snowboarding events; snowboarding debuted at the
1998 Nagano Games.</TE>
<TE>   Three more medals were won in freestyle skiing--either moguls or
aerials. Aerials have been part of the program since 1994, moguls since
1992.</TE>
<TE>   Parra, who won the gold in the 1,500 meters in world record time to go
with a silver medal last week in the 5,000 meters--the first Latino to
medal for the U.S. during a Winter Games--is a poster child for the new
U.S. Olympic athlete.</TE>
<TE>   He grew up in San Bernardino, now lives in Orlando, Fla., and was a
world-class in-line skater. But he wanted a shot at the Olympics, so he
switched to long track speed skating. That transition was eased by a job
with Olympic sponsor Home Depot that allowed him to create a work
schedule that fit his training schedule and gave him the kind of
financial security that most of his U.S. athlete predecessors never had.</TE>
<TE>   When Bakken and Flowers--who organizers said became the first black to
win a gold at a Winter Olympics--surprised the competition with their
first-place run Tuesday, they brought the ultimate success to a program
that was enhanced by $4.6 million in the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   And it all began with the Steinbrenner Commission, which released its
report 11 months after it had been given the mandate to figure out a way
to fix things. The document, presented to the USOC Executive Board on
Feb. 20, 1989, was short and to the point. Its summary said: "A committee
recommends tighter management, creative marketing and financial help to
athletes."</TE>
<TE>   The last phrase became the password. Like so many things,
Steinbrenner's group told the USOC that it was all about the money.</TE>
<TE>   Before the new measures pushed by the Steinbrenner Commission, the
most any U.S. athlete could make from the USOC was $2,500 a year.</TE>
<TE>   But another poster child for the U.S. success, Clay Ives, is an
example of how much has changed.</TE>
<TE>   Born and raised Canadian and a veteran of Canada's luge teams, Ives
carried a U.S. passport--his mother was born in Gila Bend, Ariz.--and
didn't think much about ever using it until he realized he could no
longer continue to train and eat on the $7,500 a year he was getting from
the Canadian Luge Federation. In desperation, he switched to the U.S.
team, where his annual stipend went to about $25,000. Last week, he and
teammate Chris Thorp won a bronze medal in doubles luge. For the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1998, U.S. speed skaters have been funded to the tune of $5.4
million, and that's less than half of the $11.4 million that went to the
alpine skiers.</TE>
<TE>   Of the $5.4 million for the speed skaters, $675,600 went in stipends
directly to athletes--to help them pay the rent or buy groceries.</TE>
<TE>   The other part of the Steinbrenner document that received the most
attention at the time, and is worth revisiting in the wake of 21 medals,
was the section that read: "Winning medals is, and should be, a prime
goal. It's important to this country to be among the best."</TE>
<TE>   So the tone was set in 1989, and it hasn't slowed. Before the '96
Summer Games in Atlanta, the USOC made a special allotment to athletes
for the year before the Games. They called it Home Team '96 and earmarked
the money for such things as coaches for athletes, equipment or travel
expenses to extra competitions.</TE>
<TE>   One of the leaders of that effort was Sandy Baldwin, then the USOC
treasurer, now USOC president and recently elected member of the
International Olympic Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The funding of the athletes for '96 was followed by a commitment of
$40 million to fund U.S. athletes heading to Sydney for the 2000 Summer
Games and for Salt Lake city in 2002. And out of that $40 million, which
ended up to be exactly $40,622,955, an $18-million program just for the
Salt Lake athletes was created and called Podium 2002.</TE>
<TE>   With that outlay came expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "These were the 'no excuses' Games," said Jim Page, the USOC's
managing director for sport, while he watched yet another U.S. success
Tuesday, Joe Pack's silver in the men's aerial freestyle skiing
competition.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court announced Tuesday that it will hear a major
challenge to Congress' power to extend the copyrights of films, books and
songs that first appeared in the 1920s and 1930s--a move that could
result in hundreds of thousands of classic and forgotten works becoming
freely available via the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Films such as "Gone with the Wind" and "The Wizard of Oz," the music
of the jazz era and the compositions of George and Ira Gershwin, novels
such as "The Great Gatsby" and "The Sun Also Rises," even Mickey Mouse
and Donald Duck--all would have passed into the public domain had
Congress in 1998 not extended their legal shield by 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   But this challenge to the copyright extension is not just about the
classic books, music and movies that are well-loved today. Opponents of
the extension say that if all the works published decades ago--and then
forgotten--were in the public domain, many would have a second chance at
popularity, thanks to Internet archivists who would make them easily
accessible.</LD>
<TE>   Under pressure from Hollywood studios and music publishers, Congress
has extended the period of copyright protection 11 times over the last 40
years.</TE>
<TE>   The result, say scholars and librarians, is "to transform a limited
monopoly into a virtually limitless one."</TE>
<TE>   The copyright laws are intended to encourage creativity by allowing
authors, composers and filmmakers to profit from their works. But under
the recent extension, the legal monopoly continues for 70 years after an
individual author's or composer's death.</TE>
<TE>   "How can you say you are creating incentives for authors who are long
dead?" asked Jessica Litman, a law professor at Wayne State University in
Detroit, one of 21 copyright law experts who urged the Supreme Court to
take up the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Without some check on congressional power, it is unlikely that any of
the cultural and historical works of the first half of the 20th century
will ever enter the public domain," added UC Berkeley law professor Mark
Lemley.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued by his office, Jack Valenti, the president of
the Motion Picture Assn. of America, said he had "absolute confidence
that the Supreme Court will uphold the decision" of a lower court and
"the wisdom of the Congress . . . in extending the term of copyright
protection by 20 years to maintain parity with the European Union and
other nations."</TE>
<TE>   In their appeals, the scholars and Internet entrepreneurs said the
copyright extensions have the unfortunate and unintended effect of
burying works that could be resurrected.</TE>
<TE>   The Gershwin tunes and "The Great Gatsby" will live on, they noted,
and the copyright laws will determine only who profits from their
existence.</TE>
<TE>   But the same is not true of most original works. "Millions of
copyrighted works are created every year; yet after 75 years, few remain
in circulation," the copyright scholars said. In 1930, for example,
10,027 books were published in the United States. Only 174 remain in
print today.</TE>
<TE>   "Thousands of old movies sit in shelves deteriorating because the
companies that hold the copyright make no efforts to restore them or make
them available, while their copyright status prevents others from
preserving these works," according to a brief filed on behalf of
librarians and archivists.</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate their point, they cited Frank Capra's 1946 film "It's a
Wonderful Life," which had a second life when its copyright was allowed
to lapse because of an oversight. This forgotten movie "lay gathering
dust in a movie studio until the early 1970s," when its copyright
expired.</TE>
<TE>   Once it passed into the public domain, several public broadcasting
stations aired it during the Christmas season. Within a few years, the
forgotten film became a classic and a Christmas tradition.</TE>
<TE>   And now, thanks to digital technology and the Internet, millions of
such works can be restored and made available to the public, the
librarians and archivists told the court.</TE>
<TE>   The justices considered the appeals for several weeks before voting to
grant the case, known as Eldred vs. Ashcroft, 01-618.</TE>
<TE>   Its lead plaintiff, Eric Eldred, runs an Internet library that posts
works in the public domain. But perhaps more important, his appeal was
filed by Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig, one of the foremost
legal experts on the Internet and the law.</TE>
<TE>   His appeal challenges the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of
1998, which added 20 years to most copyrights. Because of that law, "an
extraordinary range of creative invention will be blocked from falling
into the public domain at least until 2019--or longer if Congress extends
the copyright term again," Lessig said.</TE>
<TE>   This, he argues, is unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   First, he says, the Constitution gives Congress a limited power to
protect copyrights. It says Congress can "promote the Progress of
Science" by granting "exclusive rights" to authors for "limited times."</TE>
<TE>   Lessig argues that Congress has violated this clause by "creating in
practice an unlimited term" for copyrights.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's Copyright Act in 1790 protected written works for 14
years, after which authors could seek a renewal for 14 more years. This
28-year limit continued until 1909, when Congress doubled the limit to a
possible 56 years.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1962, Congress has repeatedly extended the maximum term, usually
under pressure from movie producers and the music industry.</TE>
<TE>   "The real beneficiaries of this are big media companies, because they
own the copyrights," said Washington lawyer Daniel H. Bromberg. "The 1998
bill was snidely referred to as 'The Mickey Mouse Extension Act' because
it was seen as protecting Disney's characters."</TE>
<TE>   Before Congress, proponents of the extension argued that creators of
works that remain valuable deserve to profit from them.</TE>
<TE>   And Tuesday, underscoring the importance of traditional characters,
Walt Disney Co. executives trotted out Mickey Mouse, Peter Pan and
"Beauty and the Beast's" Belle at the company's shareholder meeting in
Hartford, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   These Disney characters are "extraordinary assets," Disney President
Bob Iger said. "They are among the reasons the Disney brand is so
incredibly strong by any measure."</TE>
<TE>   Under the law being challenged, works for hire, including films, are
protected for 95 years after their release. Works by individual authors
or composers are protected for 70 years after their deaths.</TE>
<TE>   In their appeal, Lessig and his colleagues also say the extended
copyright monopolies violate the 1st Amendment's guarantee of freedom of
speech. Usually, the government should not limit free speech more than
necessary, and a 95-year shield for some works is well more than
necessary, Lessig argues.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington rejected a
challenge to the copyright extension on a 2-1 vote. Its judges said only
Congress could determine a reasonable time period for a copyright.
Moreover, the appeals court said old films and books are more likely to
survive if their copyright value is preserved.</TE>
<TE>   "Extending the duration of copyrights on existing works would, among
other things, give copyright holders an incentive to preserve older
works, particularly motion pictures in need of restoration," the judges
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Solicitor Gen. Theodore B. Olson said he agreed and urged the
court to reject the challenges to the law. There is "no 1st Amendment
right to exploit the work that Congress has purported to protect," Olson
said.</TE>
<TE>   The American Library Assn., the Internet Archive and dozens of legal
experts filed briefs in recent months urging the high court to rethink
that presumption.</TE>
<TE>   So far, however, the Supreme Court has heard only from those groups
that oppose the copyright extension. They will file their legal briefs in
several months, and the case will not be heard before the high court
until the fall.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Won't Invade N. Korea, Bush Assures Worried South</HD>
<DH>Asia: In a speech at the DMZ, the president says he backs Kim's
vision of a united peninsula.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>DORASAN STATION, South Korea
</DL>
<LD>In a blunt speech delivered at the last frontier of the Cold War,
President Bush today endorsed South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's
vision of a united Korean peninsula and called on the isolated Communist
regime in North Korea to embrace freedom.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier in the day, Bush stated unequivocally that the United States
has no plans to attack North Korea and that it supports Kim's acclaimed
"sunshine policy" of engaging the North in dialogue.</LD>
<LD>   "Make no mistake about it," Bush said at a joint news conference with
Kim. "We have no intention of invading North Korea."</LD>
<TE>   The comments marked a deliberate shift away from the bellicose to the
humanitarian, as the president--mindful of accusations that he is a
warmonger--spoke movingly of his concerns for the North Korean people. He
described the powerful image of a nighttime satellite photograph of the
peninsula showing the South "awash with light" and the impoverished North
completely dark.</TE>
<TE>   "We want all Koreans to live in the light," Bush declared in the
speech at a newly built train station at the edge of the demilitarized
zone that has separated North and South Korea for half a century.</TE>
<TE>   "My vision is clear. I see a peninsula that is one day united in
commerce and cooperation, instead of divided by barbed wire and fear.
Korean grandparents should be free to spend their final years with those
they love. Korean children should never starve while a massive army is
fed. No nation should be a prison for its own people," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   During the second leg of his six-day Asia trip, Bush was under heavy
pressure to defuse the controversy over his inclusion of North Korea in
an "axis of evil" along with Iraq and Iran. His Jan. 29 State of the
Union speech offended and unnerved many South Koreans, who feared that
the United States would extend its anti-terrorism campaign in Afghanistan
into North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   During the joint news conference, Bush seemed mindful of a South
Korean audience that today considers the North Koreans more worthy of
pity than fear, and he repeatedly stressed his sympathy.</TE>
<TE>   And offering his most detailed explanation of the "axis" remark, Bush
said: "I love freedom. . . . I am troubled about a regime that tolerates
starvation. I am deeply concerned about the people of North Korea, and
that is exactly why I said what I said."</TE>
<TE>   The president also said he fully supports Kim's efforts to continue
the dialogue with the North, although he is disappointed that North
Korean leader Kim Jong Il "will not accept the spirit of the sunshine
policy." He complained that out of 10 million people who have been
separated since the 1950-53 Korean War, only 3,600 families have been
able to participate in reunions that were agreed to in a landmark visit
by South Korea's Kim to the North Korean capital of Pyongyang in June
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Despite gloomy expectations for the meeting, Kim appeared to be
pleased with his discussion with Bush. He said that American and South
Korean positions on North Korea are "fundamentally similar" and that he
appreciates Bush's "staunch support for our sunshine policy."</TE>
<TE>   After meeting with Kim this morning, Bush took a 20-minute helicopter
ride to the DMZ, a 2 1/2-mile-wide strip fortified by land mines and
razor wire. He rolled up to Panmunjon in an armored truck and viewed a
North Korean village through binoculars. He then visited U.S. troops at
Camp Boniface, named for one of two American soldiers who were hacked to
death by North Koreans in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you hear that? No wonder I think they're evil," Bush called out
to reporters after hearing the story.</TE>
<TE>   Bush arrived in Seoul on Tuesday afternoon amid a storm of indignation
over the "axis of evil" speech, which many South Koreans believe
undermined years of painstaking diplomatic progress. South Korea's Kim
won a Nobel peace prize in 2000 for the sunshine policy and has enjoyed
international acclaim for his diplomatic skills. But the Bush
administration's tough posture toward North Korea put Kim in a
bind--caught between loyalty to South Korea's most important ally, the
United States, and dialogue with the North.</TE>
<TE>   "North Korea is like a brother and an enemy at the same time for South
Koreans," said Scott Snyder, Seoul representative of the Asia Foundation,
a San Francisco organization that watches Asia-U.S. relations. "There is
an ambivalence, but that 'axis of evil' comment was very black and white.
It was like somebody criticizing your family."</TE>
<TE>   Going into the summit, the South Korean government was hoping to learn
what specific policy the White House has in mind for North Korea. Bush
has at various times demanded not only that North Korea stop making
weapons of mass destruction and exporting missiles, but also that it
withdraw its conventional forces deployed at the DMZ. The administration
has also seemed to imply at times that reduction of conventional weapons
is a precondition for negotiations, not an item on the table.</TE>
<TE>   "First we need to find out what the United States really wants in
terms of North Korean relations, because the remarks Mr. Bush has made
seem confusing and contradictory," an aide to Kim said Tuesday, speaking
on condition of anonymity. "At one point, he implied an attack without
prior notice, and then there were remarks that the U.S. is ready to talk
to North Korea at any time, any place," the aide said.</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving Seoul for Beijing on Thursday morning, the final stop
on his Asia tour, Bush and Kim will have met seven times--ample
opportunity, presumably, for the leaders to scope out each other's
positions.</TE>
<TE>   Their first meeting, last March in Washington, was widely considered a
diplomatic fiasco because Bush embarrassed Kim by publicly disparaging
his efforts to negotiate with the North Korean leader. A second meeting
in Shanghai in October went only slightly better.</TE>
<TE>   The White House was anxious to smooth over the relationship with South
Korea in this meeting, and the speech today seemed designed to be
compared to Ronald Reagan's famous 1987 speech in Berlin in which he
demanded, "Tear down this Wall!"</TE>
<TE>   In the symbolic highlight of the visit, he appeared jointly with Kim
at the Dorasan railway station, which is intended to one day carry
passengers between the Koreas. The South Korean government opened the
station just last week as part of a $150-million project to reconnect the
destroyed rail link between the countries. Bush is scheduled to sign a
rail tie as a gesture of support for Kim's sunshine policy. The two Kims
agreed to connecting the railroad at their 2000 summit. The leaders also
had agreed to build a highway linking two cities on either side of the
DMZ, but only the South has completed its portion of the work.</TE>
<TE>   During their Wednesday afternoon visit here, Kim showed Bush the road.</TE>
<TE>   "That road has the potential to bring the peoples on both sides of
this divided land together," Bush said shortly afterward. "And for the
good of all the Korean people, the North should finish it."</TE>
<TE>   "Traveling south on that road, the people of the North would see not a
threat but a miracle of peaceful development: Asia's third-largest
economy, risen from the ruins of war. . . . They would see a great,
hopeful alternative to stagnation and starvation. And they would find
friends and partners in the rebuilding of their country."</TE>
<TE>   In Seoul, meanwhile, a North Korean soldier defected to the South near
the Dorasan station. The defection took place at 11:18 p.m. Tuesday, but
the announcement was delayed at the request of the U.S. Embassy because
of security concerns over the president's visit.</TE>

<HD>Court Rejects FCC's Limits on TV Ownership</HD>
<DH>Media: An appeals panel says agency's cap on how many U.S.
households a firm can reach is 'contrary to law.' More mergers may
result.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court Tuesday raised the likelihood of a major
new wave of takeovers in the media industry, ruling that regulators
wrongly blocked companies from expanding their hold on the nation's TV
audience.</LD>
<LD>   For decades, the government has limited corporate ownership of
television stations. Currently, the Federal Communications Commission
says companies can reach no more than 35% of U.S. households. This
standard was challenged, and Tuesday the U.S. Court of Appeals called it
"arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law." The Washington court sent
the matter back to the regulatory agency and gave it two choices: justify
retaining the ownership limit or modify it.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, the three justices overturned an FCC ban on companies
owning a cable TV system in a market where they own broadcast stations.</LD>
<TE>   If the TV ownership rules were dropped or significantly relaxed, it
would represent the biggest change since the rules were first imposed in
the 1940s. The media landscape has changed drastically in recent years
with a wave of consolidations, including the merger of America Online
Inc. and Time Warner Inc. In its early days, the regulations covered the
three TV networks at the time; today there are more than half a dozen TV
networks plus scores of cable channels.</TE>
<TE>   The court's actions will intensify the debate over whether rampant
consolidations are undermining competition and thus limiting the sources
of information. In essence, the ruling cracks open the door for an
acceleration of the merger trend.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision is likely to lead to a dramatic change in the
underlying economics and structure of the traditional mass media, with
the large broadcast television networks and cable operators the primary
beneficiaries," said Blair Levin, an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker
Inc. and a former FCC chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the FCC said Chairman Michael Powell had no comment on
the rulings, but said the agency would "study the decision." Powell, the
son of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, was appointed FCC chairman a
year ago by President Bush and has urged modifying or repealing ownership
limits.</TE>
<TE>   The current case stemmed from a split decision in May 2000 by the FCC
to retain the ownership limits. Powell cast one of the dissenting votes,
urging further study of the 35% cap.</TE>
<TE>   A suit was filed by Viacom Inc., which owns the CBS and UPN television
networks, and News Corp.'s Fox Television unit, which are both above the
35% limit, and General Electric Co.'s NBC. The broadcasters protested the
FCC's ownership limit, arguing it was no longer needed to protect the
public interest because cable television and the Internet have
dramatically broadened consumer choices.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pleased that the court of appeals agreed that the FCC had
failed to justify the national ownership cap. . . . We hope that now the
commission takes a fresh look at this antiquated rule," said NBC
spokesman Cory Shields.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer and media watchdog groups voiced outrage at the court ruling
and vowed to appeal it, saying media ownership limits encourage
democratic discourse and a variety of viewpoints in the media.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a radical effort by the court of appeals to . . . expand
corporate free-speech rights at the expense of the public's 1st Amendment
rights," said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of
Consumers Union. "We will definitely try to seek Supreme Court review of
this decision."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1940s, owning three stations was the limit. In 1984 that was
lifted to 12 stations, with a limit of 25% of the national audience. The
passage of the Telecommunications Act in 1996 eliminated the station
ownership limit and raised the limit on national audience reach to 35%.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, Powell had bided his time on the TV audience cap,
hoping the court would resolve the controversial issue.</TE>
<TE>   In throwing the case back into Powell's lap, the court placed no time
limit on how quickly the FCC must act. But legal experts said it would
probably take months before any new ownership rule is in place, and
Powell could choose to not write a new rule at all, although a former
federal official close to him said that was unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   With smaller TV station companies struggling financially amid an
advertising slowdown, experts predict that as many as 100 TV stations
could change hands if the audience cap is lifted or significantly
relaxed.</TE>
<TE>   Tribune Co., which acquired the Los Angeles Times two years ago, is
one of the major media companies that could add stations to its
broadcasting operations.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago-based company now holds a minority stake in WB television
network and owns several WB stations in major markets, including Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Cable giants like AOL Time Warner Inc., would be able to buy stations
in markets where they already own cable TV systems. AOL, which owns the
WB network, has expressed interest in acquiring NBC.</TE>
<TE>   "If [cable companies] can find the synergy, they will likely buy the
local television station" and combine news and advertising staffs to save
money, said Mark R. Fratrik, an industry analyst at broadcast research
firm BIA Financial in Chantilly, Va. He speculated that cable companies,
already heavily into all news channels like MSNBC, Fox News and CNN, may
extend the concept to local TV markets.</TE>
<TE>   Fratrik also said that if the TV audience cap is eliminated or eased
by the FCC, the TV networks probably will buy smaller TV stations already
affiliated with the networks.</TE>
<TE>   For example, he predicts Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC, might try to
acquire Albritton Communications Co., which owns seven ABC Television
affiliates. McGraw-Hill Cos., which owns four ABC affiliates, similarly
might attract network attention, Fratrik said. Bigger TV broadcasters
that own a mix of network affiliates, like Hearst-Argyle Television Inc.
and Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc., may be less likely targets for the
networks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't sense there's this tidal wave of demand out there. There's
focused demand," said Frank Biondi, former chief executive of Viacom. "If
you can buy [TV properties] at the right price, and if you get economies
of scale. But the big guys are already big. On an absolute basis, this is
not going to make or break the parent companies."</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court decision means News Corp. and Viacom will not have
to immediately sell some of the television stations they acquired in
separate deals.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom purchased CBS Corp. two years ago for $50 billion and News
Corp. acquired 33 TV stations last year in a $4.4-billion deal with
Chris-Craft Industries Inc. Today, both companies reach about 40% of the
nation's 100 million TV households.</TE>
<TE>   But the appeals court left the door open for the FCC to retain its
controversial ownership regulation and to force News Corp. and Viacom to
sell TV properties to comply.</TE>
<TE>   The court ruling represents a vindication of the Bush administration's
efforts to undo decades of regulations aimed at promoting diversity of
media ownership.</TE>
<TE>   "The court gave a clear refutation of the [Clinton administration's]
approach to media ownership restrictions," said Harold Furchltgott-Roth,
a Republican and former FCC commissioner who served with Powell. "The
court said the commission can't simply come up with an arbitrary
[audience] number. . . . There's a certain legal standard that applies."</TE>
<TE>   Consumers are unlikely to see any immediate on-the-air changes because
it will take a while for ownerships to change hands.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller TV station owners have long sided with consumer watchdog
groups in saying the cap promotes diverse local programming.</TE>
<TE>   Edward O. Fritts, CEO of the National Assn. of Broadcasters, said he
was disappointed by the court's decision. "The 35% television ownership
cap has been critically important in preserving the network-affiliate
relationship that has made the U.S. system of free, over-the-air
broadcasting the envy of the world," Fritts said.</TE>

<TE>Media Ownership</TE>
<TE>A U.S. appeals court ruling that sets aside a government rule that
bars a company from owning television stations that reach more than
35% of U.S. homes could lead to a new wave of media consolidation. A
history of regulations on media ownership:</TE>
<TE>Rules limiting the ownership of television stations date back to the
1940s, when the government prohibited broadcasters from owning more
than three outlets.</TE>
<TE>In 1984, the limit was raised to 12 stations and set a national cap
on the reach of broadcasters to 25% of the audience.</TE>
<TE>In 1996, Congress passed a landmark telecommunications bill that

<HD>Fastow Spoke of 'Gray Area' for Enron's Partnerships</HD>
<DH>Probe: Ex-finance chief told investigating lawyers in August that
Lay, Skilling OKd deals.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Former Enron Corp. Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, who
engineered the company's off-the-books partnerships, acknowledged last
summer that its financial practices "may be in a gray area," but insisted
that they had been approved by the company's leadership.</LD>
<LD>   Fastow's comments, which came in an interview with Enron's outside law
firm Aug. 27, suggest he and other insiders were aware that Enron's
financial practices could come under attack. Along with other documents
released Tuesday, they raise new questions about how much former Chairman
Kenneth L. Lay and former Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling knew about
the company's problems and its off-the-books partnerships.</LD>
<LD>   According to an internal report by law firm Vinson &amp; Elkins, Fastow
told attorneys that Enron's accounting measures had been approved by the
"office of the chairman," which consisted of Lay and Skilling.</LD>
<TE>   Both Lay and Skilling have contended they had only a dim awareness of
the financial maneuvers that triggered Enron's filing for bankruptcy
protection Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the interviews conducted by Vinson &amp; Elkins don't jibe with
all of the testimony that we've received before the committee so far,"
said Ken Johnson, spokesman for House Energy and Commerce Committee
Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.). He declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow also said that Enron executives were worried that the
partnership deals would be publicly exposed.</TE>
<TE>   "The primary issue discussed was the potential 'Wall Street Journal
risk'--i.e., the bad cosmetics being aired publicly," according to notes
from the interview with Fastow by attorneys at Vinson &amp; Elkins.</TE>
<TE>   A summary of the interview--part of the law firm's investigation into
allegations raised in August by Enron Vice President Sherron S. Watkins
in a memo to Lay--was released Tuesday by a congressional committee. The
investigation was ordered by Lay in response to the Watkins memo.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Fastow, Lay and other key figures called to
testify before Congress invoked their 5th Amendment right against
self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow told attorneys that Enron's board and its outside auditor,
Andersen, signed off on the partnership transactions, according to the
documents. These deals, Fastow said, enabled Enron to avoid write-downs
on its assets and served as a "buffer" for its profit-and-loss statement.
Investigators say that potentially is an improper use of the
partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the structure may be in a gray area, it is fully approved by
[Andersen] and is fully disclosed," the law firm quoted Fastow as saying.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate document, Lay is quoted as telling the Enron board's
internal investigating committee that Skilling was deeply troubled by
Enron's falling stock price before he resigned Aug. 14 and that he broke
into tears when he delivered his resignation to the board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling, who served just six months as chief executive, has
maintained that he resigned for personal reasons and had no inkling of
the company's impending collapse.</TE>
<TE>   A Lay spokeswoman declined to comment Tuesday; Skilling's spokeswoman
could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   But nearly six weeks before Enron publicly disclosed its problems, the
company's chief accounting officer, Richard A. Causey, said Lay and
Skilling had been warned about the potential risks created by the
partnerships, according to a summary of his Aug. 31 interview with Vinson
&amp; Elkins released Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Causey also said that an "unfortunate error" in accounting would
require Enron to take a $1-billion charge against shareholder equity, but
he characterized the issue as a "simple mistake that now requires
correction," according to the summary of his interview.</TE>
<TE>   Causey's comments indicate that some high-ranking Enron executives
knew about the company's accounting problems more than a month before
they were publicly disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 16, Enron announced a $1.2-billion charge against shareholder
equity related to the Fastow-run partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the comments by Fastow and Causey, Vinson &amp; Elkins eventually
concluded that Enron did nothing improper and said the matter did not
warrant further investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The law firm has been criticized by lawmakers and the Enron board
investigating committee for failing to conduct a more thorough probe of
issues raised in the interviews.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the law firm declined to comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Causey, who has refused to comment publicly since Enron's collapse and
was fired last week, said that Lay and Skilling both knew that the
so-called Raptor partnerships were sinking under heavy losses and would
need to be supported by issuing more Enron stock.</TE>
<TE>   "Raptor was created to withstand volatility," Causey told the law
firm. "It was not created to withstand declining asset values of the
magnitude that have been experienced. . . . All these consequences were
known to Jeff Skilling and Ken Lay through discussions of this
structure."</TE>
<TE>   Congressional staffers said the documents raise new questions about
what Lay and Skilling knew and when they knew it. But ultimately,
lawmakers--who are beginning to turn their focus to legislative
reforms--said such questions would be left to criminal investigators.</TE>
<TE>   "The whodunit is ultimately of interest more to the FBI and SEC," said
Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for Fastow and Causey declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   In his interview with Vinson &amp; Elkins, Fastow expressed "irritation"
with the Watkins memo, in which she warned that Enron could "implode in a
wave of accounting scandals." Watkins testified last week that Fastow
tried to fire her for complaining to Lay.</TE>
<TE>   A separate document released Tuesday revealed that Enron officials did
seek legal advice on Aug. 24 from Vinson &amp; Elkins about the "risks
associated with discharging (or constructively discharging) employees who
report allegations of improper accounting practices."</TE>
<TE>   The firm advised Enron that firing such an employee might leave the
company vulnerable to a wrongful termination lawsuit and would increase
the risk of a complaint to government regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Watkins was transferred, at her request, to another job
within the company.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow dismissed Watkins' concerns, saying she was "second-guessing"
Andersen's professional opinion and insisting that Enron's use of stock
to support the off-the-books partnerships had been fully disclosed in its
public filings.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton said the firm was offering advice
only on whether the transactions complied with generally accepted
accounting principles.</TE>
<TE>   "These represent business decisions made by the Enron board and
management," Dorton said.</TE>
<TE>   Another document released Tuesday was a 17-page memorandum of a Jan.
16 interview with Lay, conducted by law firm Wilmer, Cutler &amp; Pickering
and accounting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche, which assisted in the internal
investigation of the company's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Lay said that Skilling told him last year that he wanted to spend more
time with his family, but that he was also taking Enron's stock decline
personally and could not sleep at night.</TE>
<TE>   Another document released by congressional investigators Tuesday shows
that Lay signed at least one of the approval sheets authorizing a
transaction by one of Fastow's partnerships to purchase access to Enron's
fiber-optic network. Earlier this year, Lay told the internal
investigating committee that he was unaware of the partnership details.</TE>

<DH>Conflict: Israel strikes Arafat compounds in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip after militants kill six soldiers in a roadblock attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israel attacked Yasser Arafat's headquarters in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip this morning and killed at least 12 Palestinians after
militants shot dead six soldiers in one of the bloodiest spates of
violence since fighting erupted nearly 17 months ago.</LD>
<LD>   The Palestinian Authority president, who has been confined to the West
Bank city of Ramallah for more than two months by Israeli tanks, was
unharmed when a gunship fired a missile into the headquarters of his
military intelligence service. But Israel has never come closer to
harming him.</LD>
<LD>   The army reacted with rage to the attack on the soldiers, which
military analysts described as a well-planned assault, at a roadblock
northwest of Ramallah on Tuesday night. Officials vowed that revenge
would be swift and on a different scale from past retaliations.</LD>
<TE>   Before dawn today, the Israelis unleashed an air and naval bombardment
in Gaza City. Palestinians said at least five guards were killed there.
In a separate strike, soldiers entered the West Bank city of Nablus and
killed at least seven Palestinians, six of them security officers, in gun
battles, Palestinians said. The army had no immediate comment on the
Nablus operation, but officials confirmed that troops had struck Arafat's
Gaza headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   In a 24-hour period, 26 people have been killed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have suffered 11 dead in 48 hours," said Raanan Gissin, spokesman
for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. "This looks more like a premeditated
guerrilla war than sporadic terrorism. This cannot continue. There has to
be a harsher response."</TE>
<TE>Blockades Tightened</TE>
<TE>   The roadblock attack came as the army was already stepping up
retaliatory strikes against Palestinian targets and tightening blockades
of Palestinian towns and villages in response to a wave of killings that
has left Israelis reeling.</TE>
<TE>   Israel Television broke into a nightly news broadcast largely devoted
to the funerals of four Israelis killed in two attacks Monday to report
Tuesday night's deaths.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia linked to Arafat's Fatah
faction, and the militant movement Islamic Hamas both claimed
responsibility. The two groups said they planned to focus their efforts
on soldiers and Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli military intelligence officers said last week that Palestinian
factions, encouraged by signs of dissent within Israeli society over the
Sharon government's policies, had decided to concentrate their attacks
inside the West Bank and Gaza. The groups apparently hope to strengthen
calls inside Israel for the army to pull out of those areas.</TE>
<TE>   In January, a group of reserve combat officers and soldiers publicly
declared its refusal to serve in the West Bank and Gaza because it
considered the army's behavior there immoral.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, 300 reserve officers from the army and intelligence
services, calling themselves the Council for Peace and Security,
announced that they would campaign for the government to immediately
withdraw from all of the Gaza Strip and abandon 40 to 50 Jewish
settlements to better defend Israel from Palestinian attacks and pave the
way to a negotiated settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The growing debate here over the army's tactics and Sharon's policies
is sure to be deepened by what commentators said was the deadliest
Palestinian assault on Israeli soldiers since 1987, when a gunman flying
a hang glider from Lebanon killed six troops in northern Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The army was already under fire from military analysts who accuse it
of responding sluggishly to rapidly changing Palestinian tactics and
making too many mistakes in the field recently.</TE>
<TE>   Facing increasing criticism from the right and left for failing to
achieve the security or the peace he promised voters when they swept him
into office a year ago, Sharon on Monday gave the army a green light to
intensify its retaliations.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's dizzying succession of attacks and counterattacks began
before dawn as the army began carrying out Sharon's instructions.</TE>
<TE>   In Gaza, soldiers fired tank shells into the Khan Yunis refugee camp
after a Palestinian militant tried to infiltrate the nearby Jewish
settlement of Morag. Three Palestinians, including a woman and her
10-year-old daughter, were killed when the shells hit their homes,
Palestinians said.</TE>
<TE>Hamas Office Hit</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, Israeli helicopters hit a Hamas office in the
Jabaliya refugee camp near Gaza City, killing two Hamas members and
critically wounding a 9-year-old girl, according to Palestinians.
Warplanes struck a building belonging to Arafat's presidential guard,
Force 17, and another building housing Palestinian military intelligence
in Rafah in southern Gaza, injuring three Palestinian police officers.</TE>
<TE>   In Ramallah, F-16s hit a building of the Palestinian police. No
injuries were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the West Bank, two Palestinians were shot to death when
Israeli troops raided the Balata refugee camp in Nablus, and in Gaza,
troops killed a Palestinian gunman near the Netzer Hazani settlement, the
army said.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli raids failed to deter Palestinian attacks. In the early
evening, a Palestinian suicide bomber tried to board an Israeli bus
traveling through the Jordan Valley, in the West Bank, but was pushed out
the door by the suspicious bus driver. The Palestinian, who police said
was wearing a belt packed with explosives, blew up in the street. No one
else was injured in that incident. The attack on the roadblock followed
soon after.</TE>
<TE>   Israel Radio reported that the Tuesday night attack began when an
unknown number of Palestinian gunmen opened fire on a prefabricated
building sheltering soldiers at a roadblock outside the village of Ein
Arik, northwest of Ramallah, about 8 p.m. Of the eight soldiers inside
the structure, six were killed, one was wounded and another escaped
unharmed. All the gunmen escaped.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Tuesday night, Hamas said three of its militants
attacked the army roadblock post in retaliation for the Israeli airstrike
on the Hamas office in the Jabaliya camp.</TE>
<TE>   In a phone call to Al Manar, the television station of the militant
Islamic Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, a spokesman for the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade also claimed responsibility for the attack on the
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters in Ramallah, Marwan Barghouti, leader of Fatah's
Tanzim militia in the West Bank, praised the raid on the roadblock and
promised that more such attacks would soon follow.</TE>

<HD>Fear Clouds Zimbabwe Election</HD>
<DH>Africa: Violence and repressive laws have dashed hopes for a free
vote next month, as Mugabe faces his biggest challenge in 22 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>Anxiety, fear and lawlessness characterize the countdown to
Zimbabwe's decisive presidential election next month, government
opponents, human rights activists and political analysts in neighboring
South Africa said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   A series of repressive laws stifling civil liberties, a seemingly
state-sponsored campaign of violence and intimidation, and the failure of
international arbitration to ease the country's political crisis have
dashed hopes of a peaceful, free and fair vote.</LD>
<LD>   President Robert Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe for 22 years, since it
won independence from Britain, faces his most formidable challenge yet
next month from Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the opposition Movement for
Democratic Change.</LD>
<TE>   Mugabe's actions and rhetoric indicate a fierce unwillingness to give
up the country's top job, observers say, and the fight for political
power threatens to push Zimbabwe to the brink of anarchy.</TE>
<TE>   "The more the ruling party sees it cannot get what it wants, the more
desperate it becomes," said Roy Bennett, an MDC lawmaker from the
country's southeast.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the Zimbabwean government condemned the European Union's
decision to impose economic and diplomatic sanctions on Mugabe and
several ministers after the southern African nation refused to let EU
observers freely monitor the vote. The team of observers was ordered
home, two days after Zimbabwe expelled the head of the monitoring
mission.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no amount of hostile action through sanctions or otherwise
that will make us move from our principle to defend our independence,"
Information Minister Jonathan Moyo told the state-run Herald newspaper.
"We will never allow a situation where our sovereign rights are hijacked
under the guise of elections observation."</TE>
<TE>   The sanctions include cutting off $110 million in development aid,
banning travel to EU nations for Mugabe and 20 of his Cabinet ministers,
and freezing their assets in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   But human rights activists, opposition politicians and church leaders
say the sanctions have come too late to counter the violence,
intimidation and draconian laws that have already done much to help the
ruling party manipulate the election.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum, a coalition of local
rights groups, eight people have been killed in politically motivated
attacks in Zimbabwe this month, bringing the number of dead since the
start of the year to 25. Four of the recent victims were identified as
opposition supporters, two as backers of the ruling party and two of no
determined political affiliation. Cases of torture, rape and kidnappings
have also surged, the forum said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, new laws have curbed political gatherings, free
speech and the right to strike. Criticizing Mugabe is punishable by a
hefty jail sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Garfield Todd, a former prime minister of Southern
Rhodesia--the forerunner to Zimbabwe--was stripped of his Zimbabwean
citizenship. A celebrated champion of black majority rule who helped
Mugabe come to power, the 93-year-old Todd had become one of the
president's strongest critics.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Todd, who was born in New Zealand, was informed that he
had ceased to be a citizen of Zimbabwe, was not permitted to travel and
had lost his right to vote. Like most white Zimbabweans born elsewhere,
he had been carrying dual citizenship and had failed to comply with the
government's demand last year to renounce one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Todd, who lives in the southwestern city of Bulawayo, has vowed to
vote anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Todd is just one of thousands of Zimbabweans facing the prospect of
disenfranchisement.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Zimbabwe's parliament took away the right to vote from
hundreds of thousands of its citizens living abroad by scrapping absentee
balloting and making it a prerequisite for voters to have lived for more
than a year in their constituencies. The regulation excludes military
forces serving in Congo and staff members at diplomatic missions abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of citizens are being disenfranchised through the use of
other underhanded tactics, human rights officials say. In rural areas,
gangs of thugs, under the banner of youth brigades, have reportedly been
confiscating the identity cards of suspected opposition supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't have your ID, you cannot vote," said David Jamali,
programs coordinator at ZimRights, a rights group based in Harare, the
Zimbabwean capital. "So there is some silent rigging going on."</TE>
<TE>   Jamali said his organization had also received reports that residents
in high-density areas were being forced to attend ruling party meetings
or risk having their identification documents seized.</TE>
<TE>   "ZANU-PF does not have much support in the urban areas," opposition
lawmaker Edwin Mushoriwa said, referring to Mugabe's Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front. "So this is a desperation tactic to try
to instill fear into residents."</TE>
<TE>   Violence is proving to be an effective weapon in rural Zimbabwe, which
has spiraled into chaos since ruling party militants began occupying
white-owned farms two years ago, demanding that they be handed over to
landless blacks.</TE>
<TE>   Whites own about 70% of Zimbabwe's best farmland. The government has
targeted about 5,000 white-owned farms, on land it says was stolen by
British settlers, in a plan to redistribute it to blacks.</TE>
<TE>   Nine white farmers have been killed in the violence, and thousands of
black laborers are jobless after militants forced them from farms.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition officials accuse Mugabe of using land seizures as a
preelection ploy to garner support.</TE>
<TE>   The president argues that he is correcting a great injustice, and he
has vowed to continue with the land reform program to ensure that whites
are removed and most landless black families are resettled.</TE>
<TE>   "The time has now come to address the land imbalance and crush the
head of the snake once and for all," Mugabe told supporters at a rally
last week.</TE>
<TE>   Viewed by his supporters as the father of the liberation struggle,
Mugabe commands deep respect, particularly in rural Zimbabwe.</TE>
<TE>   "Before independence, there was only one university, but we are now
happy that our children now have opportunities to be educated," Solomon
Tawengwa, a ZANU-PF deputy secretary for finance, recently told a
pro-Mugabe rally. Mugabe often urges his supporters not to forget the
revolution that brought the country to independence and has warned
Zimbabweans against selling out and becoming puppets of the country's
former "white oppressors."</TE>

<HD>Hong Kong's Leader Assured New Term</HD>
<DH>Asia: Beijing and electors' support means that the unpopular chief
executive has virtually won the upcoming vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG
</DL>
<LD>Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's unpopular chief executive, in effect won
his bid for a second five-year term Tuesday, but the manner of his
victory left many disheartened about the potential for democracy in this
quasi-autonomous Chinese region.</LD>
<LD>   The electoral process proved so lopsided that Tung all but wrapped up
his triumph merely by filing his nomination papers Tuesday at Hong Kong's
Registration and Electoral Office. Tung, running unopposed in a poll
scheduled for late March, provided signatures of support from 706 of the
territory's 794 electors.</LD>
<LD>   Because any candidate opposing him requires the backing of at least
100 electors, only the withdrawal of some Tung supporters could prevent
him from being declared the winner immediately after the Feb. 28 deadline
for filing nominations. With the names of each supporter public
knowledge, any erosion is considered highly unlikely given Beijing's
support for Tung.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm pleased to receive more than 700 nominations," Tung, 64, said at
the election office. "I hope we will be more united."</TE>
<TE>   Prominent political opponents immediately dismissed the entire
electoral process as a farce.</TE>
<TE>   "A sham," declared Martin Lee, head of Hong Kong's Democratic Party.
Audrey Eu, an independent member of the region's Legislative Council and
one of the 88 electors who chose not to back Tung's nomination, called
Tuesday's development "a tragedy of our electoral system."</TE>
<TE>   "Considering that Hong Kong is an advanced international city of 7
million people, it is unacceptable that the chief executive is elected by
just 800," she said. "This means he is not accountable to the public."</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong is free to choose its chief executive under the terms of the
de facto constitution that established the former British colony as a
special administrative region of China nearly five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Under present rules, however, the voting is done indirectly by the
select group of 794 residents, mainly well-connected professionals and
other establishment figures.</TE>
<TE>   The frustration of many critics stems from the belief that Tung won
not because he is popular or has performed well in his first term but
because of a very visible--and intimidating--endorsement from Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   The nature of that backing from China's Communist leadership, critics
argue, gave the electors little choice but to support Tung.</TE>
<TE>   When Tung announced in December that he intended to run for a second
term, Hong Kong's economy was sagging. One poll indicated recently that
his public backing was 16%.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his unpopularity, Tung's opponents decided against putting up
a candidate to challenge him, fearing that it would lend legitimacy to
what they argue is a deeply flawed process. Because of this, several
hot-button issues, including unemployment and education reform, aren't
likely to be addressed during the election period.</TE>
<TE>   "The end result is that the gap between the ruling elites and the
masses will widen," Hong Kong University political scientist Sonny Lo
predicted. "Tung now has to take urgent steps to improve his performance.
Otherwise, this gap will only continue to widen."</TE>

<HD>Students Aim to Give Bush a Lesson in Diplomacy</HD>
<DH>Asia: South Korean protesters want the president to know his
remarks were unwelcome. Rally is set for today.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>As President Bush settled in for the night Tuesday at the U.S.
ambassador's residence here, Chung Jong Sung and Kim Gyong Joo emerged
from under the plastic sheeting that has been their temporary home on the
grounds of Myongdong Cathedral to explain their 11-day hunger strike.</LD>
<LD>   It was their way of greeting the American leader.</LD>
<LD>   "President Bush is preparing, step by step, to create a mood for war
in the Korean peninsula. We are living on only water and salt to protest
this action," said Kim, the president of the student government at
Chonnam University.</LD>
<TE>   "The fate of the Koreas should be left in the hands of Koreans."</TE>
<TE>   The hunger strike is one of the growing signs of anger, anxiety and
frustration with the United States since Bush declared North Korea a
member of an "axis of evil" in his State of the Union address last month.
Whatever the U.S. intent, South Koreans view it as serious meddling that
will undermine President Kim Dae Jung's effort to reunify the divided
peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush is set on breaking off the mood of reconciliation created in the
Korean peninsula since the June 15 summit [between the leaders of North
and South Korea] two years ago. The United States is considering the
worst possible action," said Chung, president of the student government
at Kwangwoon University.</TE>
<TE>   As the hunger strikers spoke, Hong Keun Soo, an activist carrying a
bullhorn, led several hundred students who were huddled together in the
bitter cold on the steps of the cathedral as they chanted: "Let's stop
Bush's visit to Korea. Bush is a cheap gangster."</TE>
<TE>   Myongdong Cathedral, in downtown Seoul, was the rallying place in the
1980s for pro-democracy demonstrators who often opposed U.S. support for
South Korea's then-authoritarian regime, but in recent years,
anti-American actions had been minimal.</TE>
<TE>   But Tuesday night, the steps leading up to the cathedral were
decorated with banners proclaiming, "No War, No Bush" and "American
Arrogance Is Inviting Isolation."</TE>
<TE>   To condemn the tough U.S. language--and to back the hunger
strikers--about 1 million students will join the two student presidents
in a one-day fast during Bush's talks with President Kim today, hunger
striker Kim said.</TE>
<TE>   The students at the rally also plan to hold shadow protests "to follow
Bush wherever he goes," Chung said.</TE>
<TE>   Of Bush's three stops on his six-day Asia tour, the South Korean leg
is the most sensitive--and susceptible to trouble, despite strong ties
between the two countries over the last half a century and the presence
of 37,000 U.S. troops in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Students, labor unions and left-wing political activists have staged
demonstrations against Bush for several days leading up to the visit. The
student demonstrators have been playing cat-and-mouse games with police,
using surprise tactics to keep officers off-guard. The uproar has spread
into the South Korean parliament, where a senior politician from the
ruling party called Bush "evil incarnate" Monday, setting off a shoving
match.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials discount the scope and importance of the
demonstrations. "That's a celebration of freedom itself--in a place where
there is freedom, there is also free speech and the right for people to
disagree," Karen Hughes, the president's counselor, told reporters aboard
Air Force One en route to Seoul from Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   "We are celebrating their freedom to speak out, even if they
disagree--unlike the citizens of North Korea," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But polls show that a solid majority of the South Korean public
disagrees with the Bush administration's position on North Korea. A
survey published Monday in the Munhwa Ilbo newspaper reported that nearly
three-quarters of South Koreans objected to his use of the phrase "axis
of evil."</TE>
<TE>   A local television poll indicated that the majority believed that the
tough U.S. talk carries an ulterior motive: to sell more U.S. arms and
warplanes to South Korea. The most popular of several conspiracy theories
circulating in Seoul contends that the Bush administration used the
threatening language against North Korea to heighten the fear of
conflict--and convince Seoul to buy F-15 fighter jets.</TE>
<TE>   To prevent disruptions, the South Korean government has deployed
12,000 riot police to guard the U.S. Embassy and other sites. In
addition, the U.S. military is investigating as a possible terrorism
attempt an incident Tuesday morning in which two men, one with a Nigerian
passport and the other of undetermined nationality, tried to enter a U.S.
military base in a stolen car.</TE>
<TE>   As Bush arrived Tuesday night, the embassy was surrounded by hundreds
of riot police carrying shields and long sticks. The embassy's high stone
fence was reinforced with a row of buses with steel grates over their
windows.</TE>
<TE>   To counter the protests, pro-American demonstrators held welcoming
ceremonies in front of the U.S. military base in Seoul to show respect.
The crowd of nearly 800 included elderly Korean War veterans, some in
their uniforms, waving small American and South Korean flags.</TE>
<TE>   "George Bush is the new MacArthur," declared Jee Man Won, a
conservative military historian, referring to Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who
led the U.S. troops who came to South Korea's defense in 1950 against
Communist North Korea. "Bush is the only one with the courage to stand up
to North Korea."</TE>
<TE>   But many political pundits in Seoul are calling the Bush visit an
exercise in damage control. The best-case scenario is that nothing new
goes wrong to further complicate U.S.-Korean relations, they contend.</TE>
<TE>   Moon Chung In, a political scientist at Yonsei University in Seoul,
said Tuesday that some progress could be made if Bush and Kim
acknowledged their differences rather than trying to paper them over.</TE>
<TE>   "These men have different world views, and they need to acknowledge
that in order to negotiate. Let different views prevail. President Kim
should not try to get George W. Bush to endorse his 'sunshine policy,' "
Moon said, referring to the South Korean's efforts at rapprochement with
the North. "That is a futile diplomatic effort."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Urged to Preserve Coalition</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: European Union officials say Washington should avoid a
unilateral response to terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BRUSSELS
</DL>
<LD>Top European Union officials sought to defuse transatlantic
tensions Tuesday but remained firm in their warning that the U.S. would
be making a mistake to go it alone in its campaign against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   In comments that reflect growing fears here of U.S. imperialism, EU
External Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten and Javier Solana, the EU's
foreign policy chief, said the fight against evil forces can succeed only
if it combines the military might of the world's leading superpower with
the nation-building skills of U.S. allies in Europe, particularly in the
19-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization. NATO has declared the Sept.
11 attacks against the United States an attack against the alliance.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a coalition here," Solana told a forum on transatlantic
affairs organized by the Washington-based German Marshall Fund. "NATO has
to prevail."</LD>
<TE>   European unease has risen dramatically since President Bush last month
said that Iraq, Iran and North Korea constituted an "axis of evil" that
threatens other countries. Reports that the U.S. is contemplating a
military strike against Iraq have stoked criticism among key European
allies.</TE>
<TE>   The president's speech triggered a volley of emotion across the
Atlantic, with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine calling it
simplistic and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell retorting that Vedrine
was "getting the vapors."</TE>
<TE>   Then Patten, a former chairman of Britain's Conservative Party and a
strong ally of Washington, turned up the heat last week by declaring the
apparent "unilateralist urge" in Washington "profoundly misguided." He
said the U.S. and its allies should redouble efforts to get weapons
inspectors back into Iraq, support reformists in Iran and urge increased
dialogue with North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   At the forum in the Belgian capital, both Patten and Solana expressed
horror at the events of Sept. 11 and stressed their deep personal ties to
the U.S. Europeans have suffered the deadly toll of terrorism for
decades, they noted, and understand the fear it creates among a civilian
populace caught in the cross-fire.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had two friends killed by terrorists, and I've gone through a
period of my life when every time I turned on the ignition of my car I
slightly wondered what was going to happen," said Patten, referring to
the death threats he received as a British Cabinet minister during the
height of the sectarian bloodshed in Northern Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomats insisted that the best way to undermine terrorism is to
build a multilateral coalition that could wage war on the diplomatic and
humanitarian fronts as well as the battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not so naive as to think that if you drop 20 million EuroAid
packages on Sudan or Somalia, or multiply that by 10 on Afghanistan, that
terrorism is going to disappear tomorrow," Patten said. "But I do think
there is a relationship between global inequity and state breakdown and
violence and instability."</TE>

<HD>Farmer Bets on Age-Old Irrigation System</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Desperate Afghan borrows against his crop one more
time in hopes of fixing tunnel that could bring water to drought-stricken
land.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KHALA, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>For Abdul Majid, desperation has become a way of life.</LD>
<LD>   With a fourth straight crop failure looming and a wife and five small
children to feed, he has quite literally bet the farm on a last hope:
reviving the karez, an age-old irrigation system that just might get
enough water to his dying vineyard and almond orchard.</LD>
<LD>   "If this fails, I'm finished," he said. A hint of defeat was already
in Majid's voice, and his tired eyes carried the bitter sense of tragedy
that occurs when good, hard-working people near the end of their
strength. He's already borrowed over $1,100--more than his crop fetched
last year.</LD>
<TE>   Now he has breathed deeply again, borrowing one more time against his
next crop to fix the damaged karez, or water tunnel system that taps into
a spring under a large hill about three miles away. With only a few
hundred yards' extension, the tunnel could bring water to his land and
assure a decent crop next fall.</TE>
<TE>   His 8,000 grapevines, 700 almond trees and small wheat field make up
only one of many water-starved farms in a small, arid valley here in the
heart of Zabol province, about 220 miles southwest of the capital, Kabul.
The province is among the worst-hit areas in a nation that is suffering
its most severe drought in living memory.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of Majid's gamble--and similar efforts by thousands of
other destitute farmers--will say much about the ability of Afghanistan's
rural population to survive in areas where this clever and ancient
irrigation method exists.</TE>
<TE>   The karez system, often appearing from the air as a string of mole
hills, is especially valuable in the withering heat of an Afghan summer
because of its unique efficiency. Being underground, it loses hardly any
water to evaporation. Designed before the time of Christ, it is
constructed at a gradually descending slope so no pumps or electricity
are needed.</TE>
<TE>   Though maintenance can be expensive and arduous--most tunnels are 15
to 30 feet below the surface, and some are even deeper--the overall
benefit of the karez has been undisputed for centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Although the karezes account for only about 10% of the country's
irrigation systems, here in water-starved Zabol they are plentiful--a
decisive factor in efforts to revive the fortunes of men such as Majid.</TE>
<TE>   "They are an important part of the irrigation structure in southern
and eastern parts of the country," noted Stephanie Bunker, spokeswoman
for the Office of the United Nations Coordinator for Afghanistan. "They
are traditional and they work."</TE>
<TE>   Getting these old systems going again is viewed by development experts
as an urgent priority. A growing number of rural dwellers are coming to
the end of their resources.</TE>
<TE>   In Zabol's eastern district of Shamulzai, for example, many residents
have already given up and moved. Those who remain struggle to stay alive.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people reduced to eating alfalfa roots," said U.N.
Development Program officer Sitikula, who, like many Afghans, goes by one
name.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike more prosperous provinces such as Kabul and Kandahar, Zabol has
no significant commercial activity other than agriculture. And with all
but a few thousand of Zabol's 1 million inhabitants living off the land,
the rhythm of life in the province has been devastated.</TE>
<TE>   Here, repeated seasons of no rain have brought more grief than decades
of war and years of Taliban rule. And though war and the Taliban are
largely gone, Zabol remains a dust bowl.</TE>
<TE>   More than two months into this year's rainy season, the 200-mile-long
Tarnak River, which furnishes much of the region's irrigation water, is
at a fraction of its normal level. Survival requires drastic, often
heartbreaking choices.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Malansafai, a project officer for the Afghan Development
Assn., said that last year many farmers were forced to sacrifice what
little their orchards and vineyards yielded by harvesting prematurely.
Allowing the fruit to ripen would have sucked the trees dry, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even that step didn't prevent disaster. "We estimate about one-third
of all trees have been destroyed," said Malansafai, whose European
Union-backed group is working with Zabol farmers.</TE>
<TE>   In part because the province's climate is harsh and water is scarce
even in the best of years, Zabol has a large number of karezes. But most
are in disrepair.</TE>
<TE>   Many were destroyed by Soviet forces in the 1980s in an attempt to
depopulate the villages and thus deprive moujahedeen warriors of support
and supplies. The tunnels also were used by Afghan civilians as shelter
during bombings and by fighters to move men and materiel.</TE>
<TE>   Other tunnels gradually filled with silt as farmers, exhausted by
years of war and poverty, abandoned their land. Now drought threatens to
finish the job.</TE>
<TE>   Majid is just one of many Khala residents at risk of going under. He
has been forced to cut down almond trees he bought and nurtured only a
few years ago, selling them as firewood at one-twentieth the original
cost. The 30-year-old farmer says he uses the money to buy food.</TE>
<TE>   Last winter he sold 100 trees that way. This year, he's already cut
down 300. To avoid defeat, Majid said, he has been working for months to
repair a karez on his land that hasn't delivered enough water since the
Soviets bombed it in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   To guarantee his next crop, Majid said, he's ready to mortgage still
more of his future so he can hire help to complete the repairs by spring.
But a crew specializing in such work recently told him the job would cost
more than the $1,600 he said he could afford to pay. Majid is looking for
a cheaper offer.</TE>
<TE>   The cost reflects the difficulty and danger involved in repairing a
karez. Workers climb down entry shafts to reach the tunnel, then clean
out and stabilize weaker sections with ceramic hoops. The work is done by
lantern light, usually in extremely cramped conditions--most tunnels are
barely large enough for an adult to crawl through.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Hamidullah Tokhi of Zabol estimates that only one of every 100
karezes in the province is functioning.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to repair them, but I can't even pay the police and
civil servants," he said. "How can we afford that?"</TE>
<TE>   As drinking water continues to disappear in the worst-hit areas,
villages have emptied. Residents seek shelter with relatives in other
areas or flee to Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Much like the trees and vines in the fields nearby, part of Khala
itself has begun to die. Majid said seven of the roughly 50 families in
the village have left, their homes empty shells, as if the village too is
suffering from blight.</TE>
<TE>   Tokhi recalled that less than two months ago locals threw flowers on
his car when he returned to the province from exile. There was an
expectation that he could bring help to ease the impact of the drought.
So far, he says, he has managed little.</TE>
<TE>   "People are demanding a lot of things, but we have nothing to give,"
he said during a recent interview at his offices in Qalat, the provincial
capital. "We have no income, no finance, no economy."</TE>
<TE>   He paused briefly before adding, "We have nothing."</TE>

<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>A crowded passenger train caught fire as it headed south early
today, killing at least 100 people and trapping another 100, police said.
Some died as they jumped from the blazing, moving train and others died
on board.</LD>
<LD>   The death toll rose as rescuers searched charred train cars hours
after the fire broke out. Egypt's Middle East New Agency reported that
the cause of the fire was a ruptured gas cylinder used for cooking in the
train cafe.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the fire erupted in one of the 11 cars of the morning
train from the capital, Cairo, to Luxor, about 310 miles south.</LD>
<TE>   Several other cars caught fire, and the train traveled in flames for
four miles before finally stopping at Ayyat, 46 miles south of Cairo.</TE>
<TE>   Rescuers continued to battle flames this morning.</TE>
<TE>   Between 100 and 150 people were believed trapped on the train, and 65
others were being treated for injuries, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Police and villagers taking part in rescue efforts found cars burned
to their steel frames. One officer described the scene as "hell."</TE>
<TE>   Thirty ambulances and 25 fire trucks from Cairo were dispatched to the
scene, the news agency reported.</TE>
<TE>   Mosques were opened to the survivors, and villagers supplied blankets,
food and drinks to the stranded passengers.</TE>
<TE>   The rail line linking Cairo with southern Egypt was closed
indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   Each car designed to accommodate about 150 passengers was reportedly
crammed with about 300 passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Many of them were traveling to their home villages to spend the
upcoming holiday of Eid al-Adha, or the Feast of the Sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   Eid al-Adha, one of Islam's major holidays, commemorates Abraham's
willingness to sacrifice his son to God. The four-day holiday begins
Friday.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a four-hour verbal battle, former Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic dismissed the first witness at his war crimes trial as a liar
and defended Serbian police actions in Kosovo as a fight against
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   During cross-examination at the tribunal in The Hague, Milosevic
sought to discredit Mahmut Bakali, an ethnic Albanian and former head of
Kosovo's Communist Party, who claimed the ex-leader destroyed Kosovo and
was responsible for thousands of deaths in the province.</LD>
<LD>   Milosevic is on trial on 66 counts of war crimes during the 1991-99
Balkan wars.</LD>

<LD>U.S. and Russian negotiators are working "under pressure" to solve
their differences and make a nuclear arms deal ready by a presidential
summit in May, but they remain at odds over Russian cooperation with
Iran, a U.S. diplomat said.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. and Russian negotiators face "a number of difficult issues,
questions of how exactly to account for the offensive strategic warheads,
measures of transparency, verification," U.S. Undersecretary of State
John R. Bolton said after two days of talks in Moscow.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. has strongly urged Russia to stop leaks of ballistic missile
technology to Iran and abandon its deal to build a nuclear reactor there.
Russia has dismissed the concerns.</LD>

<HD>Signs of More Discarded Bodies</HD>
<DH>Crime: Officials rush to beat rainstorm as search warrant helps
turn up remains near crematory owner's home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH FRAMMOLINO</AU>
<AU>EDITH STANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NOBLE, Ga.
</DL>
<LD>As scores of law enforcement agents scrambled to beat an expected
rainstorm, authorities Tuesday discovered what they believe to be yet
another cache of discarded bodies next to the grounds of the Tri-State
Crematory.</LD>
<LD>   Walker County Sheriff Steve Wilson said police, executing a search
warrant for business records, found a coffin containing human remains and
signs that other bodies are buried within a few yards of the home of
Tri-State operator Brent Marsh, who faces felony theft charges in the
unfolding cremation scandal.</LD>
<LD>   "There are mounds of dirt . . . and it appears that there may be other
coffins buried there," Wilson said. "This is located directly behind his
home."</LD>
<TE>   The discovery is the latest development in a gruesome investigation
that began just down the road, near the home of Marsh's parents, Ray and
Clara Marsh. There, police discovered scores of bodies--some dead 10 to
20 years--stacked in pits and crammed into steel vaults at the crematory,
about 25 miles south of Chattanooga, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>Positive Identification Made in Some Remains</TE>
<TE>   Some remains were mummified, others fresh, still dressed in their
funeral clothes or hospital gowns.</TE>
<TE>   As of Tuesday, authorities have recovered 191 remains, positively
identified 29 and expect to find many more before they are through.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Kris Sperry, Georgia's medical examiner, said Tuesday that
forensic experts haven't even started cataloging the bodies found in six
vaults. "I would not be surprised that as many as 20 people may be in one
of those vaults. . . . It could be well over 100" in all, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said he was still at a loss to explain why the bodies were
tossed aside rather than cremated, especially since it cost the crematory
only $25 to perform a service for which the families paid $200 to $1,500.</TE>
<TE>   "It could not be that costly to just fire it up to cremate the
bodies," said Wilson. "That's the million-dollar question, I guess, as to
why did this happen over this period of years when it would seem that to
cremate the body would be very minimal."</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff added that he inspected the cremation furnace and it
appeared to be inoperative, as Brent Marsh reportedly told officials when
he was arrested last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson also said his department was investigating reports that the
Marshes bought "many 1,000-gallon septic tanks" over the years, but have
not substantiated that claim and found the family pulled only permits for
four tanks on their property.</TE>
<TE>   The medical examiner said that after examining more than 150 urns
supposedly filled by the crematory, 15 were found to contain cement dust
and one had potting soil.</TE>
<TE>   Sperry said tests have revealed that one family took home the ashes of
an unidentified person while its loved one remained discarded on the
Marsh property.</TE>
<TE>   The effort to piece together what happened at Tri-State intensified
Tuesday, with more than 125 agents from the Georgia Bureau of
Investigation, the Walker County Sheriff's Department and federal
agencies fanned out over the 16-acre crematory site.</TE>
<TE>Crime Area Could Become a 'Mud Bowl'</TE>
<TE>   Police also flew over about six other nearby parcels the Marshes
owned, looking for more cadavers.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities concentrated the search on the surrounding woods and other
outside areas, hoping to beat an expected rainstorm that would turn their
denuded crime scene into what Sperry called a "mud bowl."</TE>
<TE>   Officials say they intend to search a large lake next to the Marsh
property and have advised nearby residents not to drink well water as a
precaution.</TE>
<TE>   The macabre saga has shocked residents of this Christian
fundamentalist bastion, where the notion of cremation is relatively new.
The headline of the Walker County Messenger on Tuesday summed it up:
"Horrified, outraged, saddened."</TE>
<TE>Federal Forensic Team on the Scene</TE>
<TE>   Brent Marsh, 28, remained in the county jail Tuesday, facing 16 felony
theft counts tied to the earlier identification of bodies found at the
crematory.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say he may face even more as they continue to identify
remains, a process that is being expedited with the help of a federal
forensic task force that worked the scene of the World Trade Center
attacks. The elder Marshes haven't been charged.</TE>
<TE>   The Marshes' name, however, was invoked during a candlelight church
service Tuesday night at the Oakwood Baptist Church in Chickamagua, eight
miles north of here, to comfort the families of loved ones sent to the
crematory. About 100 people attended. The sermon's theme: Lazarus, rising
from the dead.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the service started, five women entered the church and
slipped quietly into a row of pews, faces drawn and wearing white
T-shirts with the photo of a gray-haired woman over red lettering that
said "Victim of Marsh's Crematory."</TE>
<TE>   One of the women, Veronica Lively, said the woman depicted on the
shirts was her grandmother, who the family thought had been cremated
until her body was taken off the crematory grounds this week.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we're not the only ones going through this," said Lively. "We
have something to be thankful for. She was the second one found and
brought out."</TE>

<HD>Study Finds Utah Leads Nation in Antidepressant Use</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Some point to the pressures of Mormonism, especially for
women, to explain the surprising findings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>Doctors here have for years talked about the widespread use of
antidepressants in the state. But there was no hard evidence until a
national study that tracked drug prescriptions came to an unexpected
conclusion:</LD>
<LD>   Antidepressant drugs are prescribed in Utah more often than in any
other state, at a rate nearly twice the national average.</LD>
<LD>   Utah's high usage was cited by one of the study's authors as the most
surprising finding to emerge from the data. The study was released last
summer and updated in January.</LD>
<TE>   Other states with high antidepressant use were Maine and Oregon.
Utah's rate of antidepressant use was twice the rate of California and
nearly three times the rates in New York and New Jersey, the study
showed.</TE>
<TE>   Few here question the veracity of the study, which was a tabulation of
prescription orders, said Dr. Curtis Canning, president of the Utah
Psychiatric Assn. But trying to understand the "why" has puzzled many, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The one true answer is we don't know," said Canning, who has a
private practice in Logan. "I have some hunches.</TE>
<TE>   "In Mormondom, there is a social expectation--particularly among the
females--to put on a mask, say 'Yes' to everything that comes at her and
hide the misery and pain. I call it the 'Mother of Zion' syndrome. You
are supposed to be perfect because Mrs. Smith across the street can do it
and she has three more kids than you and her hair is always in place. I
think the cultural issue is very real. There is the expectation that you
should be happy, and if you're not happy, you're failing."</TE>
<TE>   The study did not break down drug use by sex. But according to
statistics from the National Institute of Mental Health, about twice as
many women as men suffer from depressive disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Discussion of the issue inevitably falls along Utah's traditional
fault lines. Some suggest that Utah's unique Mormon culture--70% of the
state's population belongs to the church--requires perfection and the
public presentation of a happy face, whatever may be happening privately.
The argument goes that women in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints are beset by particular pressures and are not encouraged to
acknowledge their struggles.</TE>
<TE>   Helen Wright, 71, of Taylorsville, Utah, has been using various
antidepressant drugs for 20 years and says she's never had problems
getting prescriptions.</TE>
<TE>   "Look around, you can easily find people who take them. I think it's
the cultural environment," said Wright, whose three grown children also
take antidepressants. "Most men here would just as soon their wives take
pills than bother to delve into the problems, and maybe find out they
might have something to do with the problems."</TE>
<TE>   Not so, says Fred M. Riley, commissioner of LDS Family Services. The
church maintains 10 offices in Utah staffed with licensed counselors.
Riley said he has heard the various explanations of the study but he
dismisses suggestions that the Mormon religion imposes any expectation of
perfection.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the church has established family services shows they
care about the emotional side of members," Riley said. "In fact, the LDS
population is more open to getting help and getting things fixed."</TE>
<TE>   Utah's large families--the biggest in the nation according to the 2000
Census--are often cited as a contributing factor to depression, again,
largely among women. Others call the "harried housewife" explanation the
stuff of urban legend.</TE>
<TE>   "The question I would raise is whether there is any evidence that a
high level of social demand predicts depression," said Amanda Barusch, a
professor in the graduate school of social work at the University of
Utah. "Who says that having six kids will make you depressed? There's no
evidence in the literature that shows that. Stress is not the same as
depression."</TE>
<TE>   The study was conducted by Express Scripts Inc., a St. Louis-based
pharmacy benefits management company, which tracked prescriptions of 24
drug types in about 2 million people selected at random from its 48
million members. Those studied were enrolled in privately managed
health-care programs, and the information gleaned from the study is
intended for use by HMOs. Medicare and Medicaid recipients were not
included in the study.</TE>
<TE>   Utah also leads the nation in the use of narcotic painkillers such as
codeine and morphine-based drugs, the study found, and is ranked seventh
in total prescriptions overall. Kentucky ranked first.</TE>
<TE>   The study was the first national survey that examined regional trends
in drug use. The information in the "Prescription Atlas," as the study is
called, has made little impact here since its publication.</TE>
<TE>   No official interviewed in Utah's mental health or substance abuse
agencies had much notion as to what the study says about Utah's mental
health.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest with you, I don't have a clue," said Randy Bachman,
director of the Utah Division of Mental Health. Bachman was not in his
current job when the study was released. While the results speak for
themselves, he added, interpreting why antidepressants are in high use is
a thorny matter.</TE>
<TE>   State officials say the study's results could indicate that this is an
enlightened society in which depression and mental illness are
destigmatized. In such a social climate, they say, more people are
willing to seek help and, eventually, are prescribed drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "That's certainly a plausible explanation," said Emily Cox of Express
Scripts, one of the five authors of the study. "There's a lot of
inferences being drawn from this. We can't say if there is a higher
probability for depression or depressive symptoms. You may have a
population that seeks care for less severe symptoms. You may have a
medical community that prescribes more readily."</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Mann, who lives in Logan, said after 15 years of taking
antidepressants and not feeling better, she finally quit in July. Today
she encourages others to do likewise, but she's pessimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like Happy Valley here," she said, describing the Salt Lake
Valley. "It's a scary place sometimes. People don't talk about their
problems. Everything is always rosy. That's how we got ourselves into
this mess--we're good at ignoring things."</TE>

<HD>Religion Is Key as Voucher Case Reaches Supreme Court</HD>
<DH>Education: Nearly all of the students using Cleveland's system go
to parochial schools, raising constitutional issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD LEE COLVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND
</DL>
<LD>Growing up among Irish and Eastern European immigrants on this
city's Westside, Christine Suma attended only Catholic schools. As a
mother she never even considered sending her 12 children to public
school. The 46-year-old homemaker now has four children enrolled at Our
Lady of Good Counsel, the same school she attended.</LD>
<LD>   But there's a difference. Back then, her parents paid all of her
tuition. Now, the state of Ohio foots almost all of the bill for her
children under the controversial "voucher" program. Those subsidies are
the subject of a lawsuit with broad public policy implications to be
argued before the U.S. Supreme Court today.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of the 6-year-old program say vouchers for religious
education cross the line the Constitution draws between the government
and private acts of faith, and threaten the very notion of pluralistic
public education.</LD>
<TE>   The proponents say vouchers, worth as much as $2,250 yearly for each
child, do not force recipients to choose any particular school.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my money and I want to spend it the way I want," asserted Suma,
who today will be among a group of parents from Ohio and elsewhere
demonstrating outside the Supreme Court building in Washington on behalf
of the program. "We're not asking for anything abnormal. This is what
should be normal."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides expect that the decision on the Cleveland voucher case
later this year will mark a turning point in the nation's ongoing
discussion over ways to give families education choices beyond their
neighborhood public schools. Eight states now encourage such alternatives
through tax credits, and many others finance charter schools that operate
independently of school districts. Publicly financed voucher programs,
which help pay for private tuition directly, operate in Florida and
Milwaukee in addition to Cleveland, but they have failed to take root
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, voters in California and Michigan overwhelmingly rejected
voucher proposals. Proponents say that's in part because of the legal
cloud they hope the Supreme Court will lift.</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland program stands out because more than 99% of its 4,474
beneficiaries attend religious schools. And voucher opponents--a
coalition of teacher unions, education groups and free speech and civil
rights groups--say that's because the Cleveland program is tilted in
favor of church-subsidized schools and helps many students who would
attend them even without vouchers.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics gathered by Policy Matters, a Ohio research group largely
funded by a voucher opponent, show that only 1 in 5 voucher students this
year previously attended the public schools; 1 in 3 attended private
school the year before securing a voucher. And the rest entered the
program as kindergartners.</TE>
<TE>   When the Cleveland program was set up by the state Legislature, it was
billed as an escape from financially and educationally bankrupt schools
for low-income children from the predominantly African American district.
Parents who won a lottery would have a voucher issued in their name that
could be redeemed at a school of their choice. The school was to admit
students without regard to their religion or race and agree to charge no
more than $2,500.</TE>
<TE>   Secular schools tend to charge more. Affluent suburban public schools
with largely white enrollments did not allow the Cleveland students to
transfer in. So of the 50 schools that now accept vouchers, all but one
are religious.</TE>
<TE>   Although 70% of the district's students are black, only 50% of the
voucher recipients are. Three-quarters of the recipients are considered
low-income.</TE>
<TE>   The pro-voucher Bush administration has weighed in on the state's
behalf with a brief by U.S. Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson.
"Government aid to education that is provided on neutral terms without
regard to religion and that . . . reaches a religious school only as a
result of the truly private choices of individual parents" is
constitutional, he said.</TE>
<TE>   During a two-hour dinner discussion the other day with Suma and four
other mothers who use public money to send their children to religious
schools, they stressed morals and education, not religion, as their
motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "In the public schools, there are no values," said Aventura Rodriguez,
59, as she stroked the hair of Elizabeth, a first-grader she is adopting.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley Dunn, 50, drives her seventh-grade daughter Tenise across town
to Luther Memorial, a Westside school operated by Lutheran churches. "The
key issue is that I want the best possible education for my child," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   A former aide to disabled people who herself is now disabled by heart
problems, Dunn said she could not have afforded the $2,000 tuition at her
daughter's school without a voucher. Tenise attended public schools until
the fifth grade, but then Dunn grew dissatisfied, worried that the
curriculum was too lax.</TE>
<TE>   "Tenise told me she wants to be a basketball player and when that's
over, a prosecuting attorney, and I'm trying to put her in a position
where she can do that," Dunn said.</TE>
<TE>   But religion is hard to avoid in the classroom. Tenise and her
classmates the other day gathered under a portrait of Jesus as they and
their teacher discussed a speech they had heard by a noted African
American neurosurgeon.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a man of faith and he shared that this morning with no
apologies," noted Margaret Stunkel, the 70-student school's principal and
part-time teacher. "He said you have to work hard to use everything God
has given you, but also that you should care."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Stunkel said, religion is not the main motivator for the
parents of her students, 83% of whom receive the vouchers and 27% of whom
do not attend any church. "People tell me they choose Luther Memorial
because it's safe and they want their kids to get an education and not be
diverted from it." To maintain the proper atmosphere for learning, she
said, students with behavior problems "can go elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Public school educators say they don't have the option of sending
difficult children away. As they talked about the vouchers, Suma, Dunn
and the others shared horror stories--most of them second-hand--about the
77,000-student Cleveland public schools. They said they worried that the
public schools were unsafe and too impersonal and uncaring in comparison
to the private schools.</TE>
<TE>   But, of the five, only two had had children in the public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, there is wide agreement that conditions in the public
schools and test scores have improved, which may be why taxpayers
recently approved the first increase in their school taxes in 25 years.
It also may be one reason why almost half of the money allocated for the
program this year will go unclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   An independent evaluation of the educational outcome of the program
found that while voucher students enter kindergarten well ahead of their
public school counterparts, the public school students nearly catch up
within three years. National evaluations of charter schools and voucher
programs have shown similarly mixed results, with no clear academic
winner.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Byrd-Bennett, the chief executive of the Cleveland Public
Schools, said the voucher program posed a "moral crisis" for her. "Our
kids, who have the least, have the most taken away from them," she said.
She estimated that the voucher program has diverted at least $50 million
from programs for low-income children during its existence.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the Supreme Court has permitted a limited flow of
public aid to parochial schools. Two years ago, the justices, on a 6-3
vote, upheld the use of federal funds to buy computers for religious as
well as public schools. The key issue is "neutrality," wrote Justice
Clarence Thomas. Because the education aid program neither favored nor
disfavored religion, it was constitutional, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A federal appeals court declared Cleveland's vouchers
unconstitutional. The case's outcome in the Supreme Court probably
depends on Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the swing vote on most religion
cases.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, she voted to uphold the computer aid program but
refused to sign Thomas' opinion. If a state aid program results in "an
actual diversion" of public money for "religious indoctrination," it is
unconstitutional, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The upcoming legal battle was very much on the minds of teachers and
students the other morning at Forest Hill Parkway, a public school in the
Glenville area on the Eastside.</TE>
<TE>   In Robert Bernetich's bright and lively fifth-grade classroom, things
quickly got into high gear after he reminded them that "our first
priority as always is learning."</TE>
<TE>   Bernetich reviewed the elements of poetry and then asked his students
to recite ones they'd brought in. They did so, reading poems by Adrienne
Rich, Langston Hughes and others. Then the veteran teacher of 22 years
asked the class to write poems of their own. He gave them a moment of
silence to collect their thoughts, put on some soothing music and they
began.</TE>
<TE>   Deonte Richardson crafted a funny ditty about kids who play all day
and was the first to volunteer to read his work aloud. But his thoughts
also drifted toward the meaning of the sweatshirt he wore, which on the
front said, "Every Child Counts" and on the back said "Say No to
Vouchers."</TE>
<TE>   "The vouchers are so people can go to different schools . . . but when
I found out they're taking other people's tax money, I didn't like it,"
said Deonte, an honor student who plays saxophone and drums and loves to
write.</TE>
<TE>   But Shirley Dunn, who lives nearby even though she sends her daughter
across town to Luther Memorial, rejects that idea.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should there be a problem here?" she asked. "I don't feel my
daughter and I are taking anything away from the public. Why are we such
a threat? I really, really, really want to know?"</TE>

<HD>Supreme Court to Take Up Sex Offender Web Postings</HD>
<DH>Internet: Publishing names and addresses can amount to illegal
punishment, lawyers say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking up an appeal from state prosecutors, the Supreme Court said
it would decide whether officials can put on the Internet the names,
addresses and photos of sex offenders who have been released from prison.</LD>
<LD>   All 50 states require these offenders to register with the police, and
most states take steps to alert the community of their presence. At least
28 states put this information on the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said the state was considering
legislation that allows Californians with a valid driver's license to
check information on sex offenders who reside in their county.</LD>
<TE>   The case to be heard before the high court comes from Alaska. It
concerns whether states can post information about sex offenders whose
crimes predated the adoption of the law that permitted posting such
information.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Alaska adopted its Sex Offender Registration Act. Last year,
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in an opinion by Judge Stephen
Reinhart in Los Angeles, said it cannot be applied to offenders whose
crimes took place before 1994.</TE>
<TE>   To do so would impose an after-the-fact punishment and therefore,
violate the Constitution's ban on "ex post facto" laws.</TE>
<TE>   But Alaska prosecutors, joined by Lockyer and the attorneys general
from 22 other states, urged the high court to uphold these laws and rule
that they do not impose true punishment on offenders who have been
released.</TE>
<TE>   "The public safety interest is in knowing who is in your neighborhood,
who poses a danger to you or someone in your family," said California
Deputy Atty. Gen. Janet Neeley.</TE>
<TE>   Men identified as John Doe I and John Doe II, along with one man's
wife, challenged Alaska's retroactive law as unconstitutional punishment
after the fact. Their attorney, Verne E. Rupright, told the appellate
court that the registry was "nothing more than a penal measure dressed in
civil clothing."</TE>
<TE>   The case is Otte vs. Doe, 01-729, and will be heard in the fall.</TE>

<HD>High Court Rules Against Student Privacy Case</HD>
<DH>Education: Teachers are not violating the law by allowing pupils to
grade peers' papers, the justices decide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Schoolteachers who have students grade their fellow pupils' papers
in class need not fear they are violating federal privacy laws, the
Supreme Court said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In a 9-0 ruling, the justices said the privacy law was intended to
protect the kind of education records that are "kept in a filing cabinet
in a records room or on a permanent secure database," not the grades on a
classroom paper.</LD>
<LD>   It would make for a shocking change in the law, said Justice Anthony
M. Kennedy, if thousands of ordinary classroom teachers were subject to
being sued by children or their parents simply because they put "a happy
face, a gold star or a disapproving remark on a classroom assignment."</LD>
<TE>   The justices said they were surprised that such a case ever made it to
the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   It did so, however, because an Oklahoma mother won a favorable ruling
in her lawsuit against her children's school district.</TE>
<TE>   Krista Falvo, who lives in a Tulsa suburb, objected because her
children's teachers had the pupils grade each other's homework and tests
in class. They went over correct and incorrect answers, and the teachers
often had pupils call out the grade of the paper they were grading.</TE>
<TE>   She claimed that her children were at times "severely embarrassed" by
the comments made by others. She complained to the school board and urged
it to adopt a policy forbidding this peer grading, or at least to take
steps to protect the privacy of individual students.</TE>
<TE>   When the board refused, she filed a lawsuit under the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, a measure that shields
"education records, files and documents" relating to individual students.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear precisely what this law was intended to protect, or
indeed whether anyone has a right to sue schools or colleges over alleged
violations.</TE>
<TE>   In Tuesday's opinion, Kennedy said he and his colleagues were not
deciding whether parents such as Falvo have a right to sue. That question
will be considered in April in a university case.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the issue reached the high court because the U.S. Court
of Appeals in Denver sided with Falvo and ruled that because classroom
grades are a type of educational record, the privacy law forbids their
disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   Without spending a long time on this assignment, Kennedy said he was
quite confident that Congress did not mean to regulate the handling of
classroom assignments.</TE>
<TE>   The law seems to say that "education records are institutional records
kept by a single central custodian, such as a registrar, not individual
assignments handled by many student graders in their separate
classrooms," he wrote in the case of Owasso Independent School District
vs. Falvo, 00-1073.</TE>
<TE>   The National School Boards Assn. applauded the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "This opinion is clearly based on a common-sense reading of the
statute," said Julie Underwood, the association's general counsel. "A
contrary ruling would have turned a widely used practice into a legal
nightmare."</TE>

could mark a turning point that signals increasing political consequences
from the surge of American families into the stock market.</LD>
<LD>   Since the early 1980s, the share of American households that own stock
has soared from about 1 in 5 to 1 in 2 today, with many of those
investments concentrated in 401(k) retirement savings plans. And as Main
Street's stake in Wall Street has increased, so has the political
system's sensitivity to issues surrounding investor and pension
protection--as Enron is graphically demonstrating in waves of hearings,
denunciations and reform proposals.</LD>
<LD>   "Because of this change, there is extreme sensitivity among members of
Congress to these issues," says Rep. Richard H. Baker (R-La.), who chairs
the House Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets. "It is no
longer a few well-heeled investors losing a couple of hundred thousand
dollars. Now it is the pensioner losing her retirement. As a result,
there's an environment that did not previously exist in Congress."</LD>
<TE>   This new environment is confounding expectations of how the widening
market participation might affect politics.</TE>
<TE>   For years, many conservative strategists have hoped that as more
workers own shares they would absorb the predominantly small-government
attitudes of business owners. That hasn't happened to any significant
extent; in the 2000 presidential race, stock owners were only slightly
more likely to support George W. Bush, the more conservative candidate,
than voters who didn't own stock, exit polls found.</TE>
<TE>   But the Enron furor suggests that the most immediate effect of
widening stock ownership may be to increase the constituency for
government action to safeguard investments and pensions from fraud. A
recent Times poll found that Americans who own 401(k) plans, though
broadly pro-business in attitude, were much more likely than
non-investors to support new government regulations aimed at accountants
and the managers of pension plans.</TE>
<TE>   "As you have more people invest in capitalism, the theory was that
that would lead to a hands-off view toward government," said Democratic
pollster Stanley B. Greenberg. "In fact the opposite may be true
post-Enron. That stake in capitalism has been put in jeopardy by reckless
behavior and we are back at the old-time question of 'Who can arbitrate
for ordinary people?' It turns out to be government."</TE>
<TE>'It Is Clear the Stakes Have Risen'</TE>
<TE>   The mass public move into the stock market has been one of the most
powerful economic and demographic changes of the last quarter-century.
New figures from the Investment Company Institute show that about half of
all American households own stock mutual funds.</TE>
<TE>   "Just to put this in historical terms, when the stock market crashed
in 1929, 1.2% of the American public owned stocks, yet it was remembered
as a historical calamity," said Joel Seligman, dean of the Washington
University School of Law in St. Louis and a historian of securities law.
"When you see a situation like Enron, and you are dealing with about half
the households, it is clear the stakes have risen."</TE>
<TE>   Broadly speaking, both political parties have supported this migration
into the markets and both want to reinforce the trend.</TE>
<TE>   The most dramatic manifestation of that is President Bush's call to
partially privatize Social Security by allowing workers to divert part of
their payroll tax into an investment account they could invest in stocks
or mutual funds.</TE>
<TE>   But the most popular Democratic alternative would also encourage more
workers into the market by creating "add-on" Social Security accounts
that could be invested in stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) offered
another variation, proposing to establish a $500 investment account for
all Americans at birth, with tax subsidies for additional contributions
from their parents until they turn 18. Last year, both parties supported
a tax credit to encourage more low-income workers to participate in
401(k) plans.</TE>
<TE>   All of these ideas envision--indeed encourage--a future in which the
market's performance would directly affect the finances of an
ever-growing proportion of American families.</TE>
<TE>   Already the rising stake of ordinary Americans in the markets may be
measured by the extraordinary interest in the Enron story.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy may be attracting so much attention because so many
more Americans than a generation ago can imagine themselves in the shoes
of the Enron employees, decimated after the company stock in their 401(k)
plans cratered. In the recent Times survey, about half of adults said
they have 401(k) plans and a head-turning 71% of those said they are
closely following the Enron story.</TE>
<TE>   "With the crossover into [401(k)] plans and the movement of so many
people into the market in the high-tech boom of the 1990s, people have a
sense of investment as owners they didn't have before," says Sarah
Teslik, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, an
alliance of pension plans that manages about $2 trillion in assets. "So
they are paying more attention to the details."</TE>
<TE>   In the Times poll, that attention translated into nuanced attitudes
that showed clear evidence of investors seeing a common interest in new
public protections after Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Like other studies, the poll found that more affluent and
better-educated families were the most likely to be invested in the
market. Nearly 3 in 5 Republicans said they owned a 401(k) plan; nearly 3
in 5 Democrats said they didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, given those demographics, those who owned 401(k)
plans were considerably more likely than those who didn't to express
confidence in business generally and somewhat more likely to support the
Bush administration's handling of the Enron controversy.</TE>
<TE>   But the investors were also more likely to support a ban on accounting
firms providing other consulting services for the companies they audit
(as former President Clinton's administration proposed), and a limit on
the share of company stock that can be held in a retirement plan (as
congressional Democrats have proposed over Bush's objections).</TE>
<TE>Many Ideas Put Forth on Investor Reforms</TE>
<TE>   This post-Enron public concern has been powerful enough to at least
force onto the table a much broader corporate and investor reform agenda
than seemed imaginable in recent years. In the last few weeks, Congress
and the Bush administration have disgorged a torrent of ideas to reform
the accounting industry, corporate financial disclosures and the
safeguards for pension plans; by early next month, a high-level
administration working group is planning to release proposals aimed at
improving the way corporations are governed.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking at the incentive structures that get corporations to
disclose information and put it out," said one senior administration
official. "I think there is a consensus that some greater accountability
of corporate leaders is desirable and now we are into the fine points."</TE>
<TE>   What's not clear is whether the interest in reform among the new
investing class will be broad and sustained enough to force through
significant changes, analysts say. Though both parties are advancing
reform proposals, they are separated by a familiar divide, with Democrats
across the board arguing for more intensive government intervention than
Republicans.</TE>

<HD>Killer Seeking Electrocution Death Executed by Injection</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>LUCASVILLE, Ohio
</DL>
<LD>A convicted killer who once chose the electric chair for his death
to protest capital punishment was executed by injection Tuesday despite
his claim that an accomplice committed the stabbing for which he was
condemned.</LD>
<LD>   John W. Byrd, 38, was sentenced to die for the 1983 murder of Monte
Tewksbury, 40, who was stabbed during a robbery at a convenience store
outside Cincinnati where he was moonlighting to pay for his daughter's
education.</LD>
<LD>   "He said the state shall fall and the rest of you, you know where you
can go," television newswoman Teri Barr, a media witness to the
execution, quoted Byrd as saying.</LD>
<TE>   "Monte is at a place where he could speak of forgiveness and mercy to
the man who took his life. I cannot," said Tewksbury's widow, Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd insisted he could not remember what happened because he was under
the influence of drugs and alcohol. An accomplice, John Brewer, confessed
to stabbing Tewksbury.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors said Brewer was lying to protect Byrd. Brewer was
already serving a life sentence and could not be retried.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd chose the electric chair as his method of execution, first
scheduled for last September, to demonstrate the brutality of the method,
which has not been used in Ohio since 1963. But Ohio banned the chair in
November, leaving lethal injection as the sole means of execution.</TE>
<TE>   The last electrocution in the United States, of Michael Claggett in
Virginia July 6, 2000, was one of five that year. All 108 U.S. executions
since have been by lethal injection.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Robert A. Taft denied clemency for Byrd last week.</TE>
<TE>   A federal appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his
last-minute appeals.</TE>
<TE>   His fight to avoid execution exposed an unusual rancor among judges in
the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, who accused each other of holding
secret meetings and engaging in questionable tactics to spare Byrd.</TE>

<HD>Teens Killed Professors for Money, Indictment Says</HD>
<DH>Crime: The suspects, seeking ATM cards, posed as survey-taking
students, prosecutors in New Hampshire allege.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>An indictment unsealed in New Hampshire on Tuesday alleges that two
Dartmouth College professors were fatally stabbed at their home a year
ago by a pair of teenagers who hatched a plot to steal their ATM cards
and PINs by posing as students conducting a survey.</LD>
<LD>   According to the indictment, Robert Tulloch, 18, and his 17-year-old
accomplice, James Parker, were unable to gain entry to four other
randomly chosen homes in the six months before they managed to talk
themselves into Half and Susanne Zantop's residence on Jan. 27, 2001.</LD>
<LD>   On the very day the Zantops were killed, the two youths from Vermont
tried their ruse at another house on the same street but were foiled
because no one was home, the indictment says.</LD>
<TE>   Internationally renowned as academics, the Zantops were also known for
their open-door policy to students around Hanover, N.H. The indictment
says Tulloch and Parker unwittingly took advantage of the couple's
friendliness by telling Half Zantop they were students conducting an
environmental survey.</TE>
<TE>   The 62-year-old Earth scientist and his 54-year-old wife, the head of
Dartmouth's German department, were found slain in their study when a
fellow faculty member arrived for a dinner engagement later in the day.</TE>
<TE>   The details contained in the indictment brought some sense of
resolution to a college town so peaceful that many residents fail to lock
their front doors. The Zantops' slayings were only the third case of
homicide in Hanover in 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Still, said Dartmouth College spokesperson Laurel Stavis, the nature
of the material contained in the indictment was unsettling.</TE>
<TE>   "All the developments in this story are troubling in one way or
another," Stavis said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The two teenagers charged in the killings were high school students
from Chelsea, Vt., a poor and isolated village about 40 miles from
Hanover. Tulloch was an honor student; Parker was the class clown. Both
boys had had minor skirmishes with local law enforcement, including
instances of entering homes in Chelsea when the owners were absent.</TE>
<TE>   The two best friends apparently dreamed up their robbery-murder scheme
in June 2000, the indictment says.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment did not specify whether the information about the plan
to steal automated teller machine cards and personal identification
numbers was provided by Parker, who has pleaded guilty to second-degree
murder in the death of Susanne Zantop, and who has agreed to testify
against Tulloch.</TE>
<TE>   Tulloch, charged with first-degree murder, has indicated he will use
an insanity defense at his trial in April. The new indictment also
charges Tulloch with murder conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   The penalty for each of the multiple murder indictments he still faces
is mandatory life in prison without parole.</TE>
<TE>   The document unveiled Tuesday shows that Tulloch and Parker made their
first attempt to put their plan into action in July 2000. Before knocking
on the door of a home in Vershire, Vt., the pair cut the telephone line.
Parker hid in the bushes while Tulloch told the person who answered the
door that his car had broken down. He was refused entry and the two left,
the indictment relates.</TE>
<TE>   By Jan. 19, 2001, Tulloch and Parker were using the fake environmental
survey as their ruse when they went to a home in Rochester, Vt. Again,
they were turned away.</TE>
<TE>   Next they directed their attention to Etna, N.H., a pocket of homes
next to Hanover occupied largely by Dartmouth faculty. The indictment
reveals they tried at least one other home on the secluded road where the
Zantops lived--again, with no success.</TE>
<TE>   On the day the Zantops were killed, they again tried a home "located
in close proximity" to the residence of the two professors, according to
the indictment. Again, no one was home.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the indictment says, Half Zantop opened the door and led the
pair to the study. Tulloch allegedly asked questions, the indictment
says, and Parker took notes.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear from the indictment where Susanne Zantop was at the
time of the mock interview.</TE>
<TE>   Although the indictment does not describe the stabbings, authorities
said at the time that both professors died from multiple wounds to their
heads and chests.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment confirms that Tulloch and Parker bought two unusual,
military-style knives over the Internet in early January 2001.
Authorities said at the time that Tulloch allegedly sold a prized
snowboard to help finance the purchase.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet transaction, as well as the uncommon nature of the
weapons, helped lead police to the two young suspects.</TE>
<TE>   On the way back to Chelsea after the murder, the indictment says
Tulloch and Parker stopped to wash blood off the knives and a floor mat
in their car. Realizing they had left knife sheaths at the Zantop home,
the pair drove back--but turned away when they saw a police car in the
driveway, the indictment says.</TE>
<TE>   The document says the teenagers burned Half Zantop's wallet and some
bloody clothes.</TE>

<HD>Petition Assails U.S. on Prisoners</HD>
<DH>Law: Attorneys for British and Australian citizens held at Camp
X-Ray say international laws are being violated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is facing increased challenges on legal and
diplomatic fronts to its policy of holding about 300 war detainees in
Guantanamo Bay, as critics insist the United States has violated basic
rights accorded prisoners.</LD>
<LD>   The latest salvo in the debate came Tuesday when lawyers for three
Muslims captured in Afghanistan--two British men and an Australian--asked
a federal court here to declare illegal a White House order allowing the
military to hold the detainees "virtually incommunicado" in Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   "The question here is, can the president of the United States detain
people indefinitely without charge and without trial?" asked Stephen
Kenny, a lawyer for 26-year-old David Hicks, an Australian who went to
Pakistan to study Islam and joined the Taliban.</LD>
<TE>   "If he's not a prisoner of war, on what basis is he being held? What
has he done wrong, and what charges does he face?" Kenny asked in an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   The debate hinges on whether the extraordinary events of Sept. 11
justify the government's use of extraordinary means against people
captured in Afghanistan, including suspected Taliban supporters who may
not have direct ties to terrorist activities.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Bush administration has defended its Guantanamo Bay
prison operation as humane, the policy has provoked civil liberties
concerns from some European leaders, along with dissension within the
administration over whether detainees should be considered prisoners of
war.</TE>
<TE>   After Secretary of State Colin L. Powell voiced concerns about some
aspects of U.S. detention policy, President Bush last month modified the
U.S. position in declaring that the military would apply the rules of the
Geneva Conventions to Taliban soldiers in custody, but not to suspected
members of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   But civil rights advocates maintain that the new stance does not go
far enough.</TE>
<TE>   The petition filed Tuesday in federal court by the Center for
Constitutional Rights maintains that an order signed by Bush on Nov.
13--giving the military the authority to detain terrorist suspects and
establish tribunals for trying them--flies in the face of established
U.S. and international law.</TE>
<TE>   The petition marks the second to challenge the Guantanamo Bay prison
operation, following a claim brought in Los Angeles last month by clergy,
lawyers and academicians. A hearing in the Los Angeles case is set for
Thursday after the district court Tuesday rejected claims that Judge A.
Howard Matz, who is hearing the case, had a conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   But Matz has already expressed "grave doubts" about his authority to
intervene from Los Angeles, and legal analysts said Tuesday that the new
Washington claim appears to stand a stronger chance of success because it
provides a more logical forum for hearing the case, and also specifies
individual prisoners whose rights were allegedly violated.</TE>
<TE>   The Center for Constitutional Rights and other lawyers involved in the
case alleged that Bush's order allows the military to hold detainees at
Camp X-Ray at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station without charging them,
without notifying them of their legal rights and without giving them
access to lawyers. For those prisoners who are not brought before a
military tribunal, detention is "indefinite and unreviewable," the
petition alleges. And Bush allegedly has overly broad discretion to
decide who is locked up and for how long.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the Pentagon and the Justice Department refused to
comment Tuesday on the allegations. Capt. Riccho Player, a spokesman for
the Pentagon, said that while he could not discuss the legal issues
raised in the petition, the 300 prisoners at Guantanamo Bay were being
treated "absolutely" fairly in accordance with U.S. and international
law.</TE>
<TE>   The detainees "are able to pray, they're getting ethnically
appropriate meals three times a day, they're gaining weight," Player
said. "You have to remember these are dangerous individuals we're dealing
with, and they're being treated humanely even though they'd probably meet
you and slit your throat as quickly as they'd shake your hand."</TE>
<TE>   Hicks, the Australian named in Tuesday's filing, allegedly threatened
his American captors and had to be subdued by military guards en route to
Cuba. But his father, Terry Hicks of Adelaide, Australia, said in an
interview that his son deserves better treatment from his American
captors.</TE>
<TE>   The Australian government has tried to get Hicks' family in to the
naval base to see him but was turned down. According to the petition, the
Australian government told the Hicks family in a Feb. 9 letter that "the
United States has advised that, at this stage, no family access be
allowed any of the detainees held at Guantanamo Bay," according to the
petition.</TE>
<TE>   Intervention by a court "is the only way we can get any movement,"
Hicks' father said. 'He's being held under a law that, to me, doesn't
sound right."</TE>
<TE>   Terry Hicks said that although he does not support his son's decision
to join the Taliban after converting to Islam, "I do support my son, and
I want him to have a fair go of it."</TE>
<TE>   The petition maintains that detained British Muslims Asif Iqbal and
Shafiqu Rasul, like Hicks, are "not enemy aliens" of the United States.
The two young men, neighbors in the English town of Tipton, were
reportedly swayed by the hard-line teachings of a radical Islamic cleric
in Great Britain and then traveled to Afghanistan to fight alongside
Taliban and Al Qaeda troops. According to British media reports, they
were allegedly taught that Islamic teachings allowed them to kill
non-Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   But the petition maintains that neither man had any direct or indirect
involvement in terrorist activities or the events of Sept. 11 and that
their detention is "unlawful."</TE>

<HD>'Creator' Is Freedom's Source, Ashcroft Says</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE
</DL>
<LD>Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft portrayed the battle against terrorism in
starkly religious tones of good versus evil at a sermon-style speech
Tuesday, saying that "civilized" people respect freedoms granted by the
Creator.</LD>
<LD>   "The call to defend civilization from terrorism resonates from a
deeper source than our legal or even our political institutions.
Civilized individuals--Christians, Jews and Muslims--all understand that
the source of freedom and human dignity is the Creator," Ashcroft told
the annual convention of the National Religious Broadcasters Assn.</LD>
<LD>   "All people are called to the defense of the grantor of freedom, and
the framework of freedom he created," said Ashcroft, the devout son of a
Pentecostal minister. "And this is our responsibility: the guarding of
freedom that God grants is the noble charge of the Department of Justice.
It is a cause in which all people may participate."</LD>
<TE>   Ashcroft's 25-minute speech, laced with biblical quotations, took on
the feel of a Sunday morning sermon, as the attorney general's comments
drew "amens" and frequent applause from a crowd of more than 6,000. But
his comments could revive questions that have dogged Ashcroft since his
heated nomination battle last year--namely, whether his deeply held
religious beliefs color his actions as the nation's chief law enforcement
official.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft was already thrown on the defensive earlier this month when
Muslim groups called for Bush to fire Ashcroft because he allegedly said
that while Christianity is a faith in which God "sends his son to die for
you," Islam is "a religion in which God requires you to send your son to
die for him." Ashcroft said the remark, attributed to him by a
conservative columnist, did not "accurately reflect what I believe I
said."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft has never shied away from his religious beliefs as a public
figure. He holds devotional sessions with prayers and readings nearly
every day at the Justice Department. His speech Tuesday appeared to mark
his most expansive public comments on the subject as attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said that although they weren't surprised by Ashcroft's
continued focus on issues of religion and morality, some elements of the
speech made them uncomfortable. Robert Boston, a spokesman for Americans
United for the Separation of Church and State, a nonprofit group in
Washington, said he was particularly bothered by Ashcroft's focus on
"civilized" people respecting freedoms granted by "the Creator."</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things he's never understood is that true pluralism in our
society includes those who would choose not to believe, and there are
millions of Americans who fall under that umbrella," Boston said.</TE>
<TE>   But his remarks clearly struck a sympathetic chord with the audience
in the ballroom of the Opryland Hotel, as many bowed their heads in
prayer afterward.</TE>

<LD>Crime, violence and child abuse dominate the news media's coverage
of children, while stories related to the care and health of young people
receive less attention, according to a study released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, news stories about youth crime and violence toward children
often fail to place events in the context of broader trends and contain
less information about social policy than do stories about children,
according to a University of Maryland study.</LD>
<LD>   "The issues that we covered the most frequently are the ones about
which journalists provided the least context," said Beth Frerking, the
center's director.</LD>
<TE>   "Context doesn't have to be pages long. It can be a sentence,"
Frerking said. "But without it, [the media] fail in our mission to help
educate our audience and contribute to a more informed public debate."</TE>
<TE>   The study found that stories on child health insurance contained the
most information about the current state of public policy. Stories on
teen parenting and child care had the most analytical focus.</TE>

<HD>Tax Suits Against Tobacco Rejected</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tobacco companies scored a legal victory Tuesday when a federal
judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., dismissed a pair of lawsuits that accused them
of cheating governments in Europe and Colombia out of hundreds of
millions of dollars in taxes through cigarette smuggling operations.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by U.S. District Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis did not absolve
the cigarette makers of charges they took part in a global smuggling
conspiracy. Rather, it was based narrowly on a finding that they are
immune to being pursued by foreign governments for unpaid taxes in U.S.
courts.</LD>
<LD>   One of the cases dismissed Tuesday was filed in November 2000 by the
European Economic Community and 10 of its member nations against Philip
Morris Cos. Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and Japan Tobacco Inc. The
other was filed in May 2000 by 22 Colombian states against Philip Morris
and British American Tobacco.</LD>
<TE>   "We are pleased that the court . . . agreed that these lawsuits should
be dismissed," said William S. Ohlemeyer, vice president and associate
general counsel of Philip Morris, after Tuesday's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling brings to three the number of major anti-smuggling cases to
founder because of the "revenue rule"--a common-law doctrine crafted in
18th century England that prevents foreign plaintiffs from using U.S.
courts to enforce their tax laws.</TE>
<TE>   The revenue rule also caused a $1-billion suit by Canada against R.J.
Reynolds to be dismissed in July 2000. The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of
Appeals upheld the dismissal last fall.</TE>
<TE>   But in his ruling Tuesday, Garaufis left the door ajar for the
European and Colombian plaintiffs to pursue some of their claims. In both
cases, he dismissed racketeering charges "with prejudice," meaning the
charges cannot be refiled. But he said it might be possible for the
plaintiffs to amend their money laundering charges and other claims to
avoid colliding with the revenue rule.</TE>
<TE>   The judge "has given us leave to replead" the money laundering portion
of the suit, "and that is what we're going to do," said Carlos Acevedo, a
lawyer for the Colombian states. A lawyer for the EEC declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits accused cigarette makers of knowingly dealing with
narcotic traffickers, money launderers and organized crime figures in
smuggling their brands. The litigation has been fueled by disclosure of
hundreds of British American documents suggesting that the cigarette
maker relied on smuggling to compete with rivals, such as Philip Morris,
who it assumed was doing the same.</TE>
<TE>   According to some estimates, about 15 billion packs of cigarettes a
year--nearly one-third of those in international commerce--get smuggled
across national borders without duties or taxes being paid.</TE>
<TE>   Health authorities say that smuggling increases the worldwide burden
of smoking-related disease by keeping supplies of cheap cigarettes on the
market.</TE>
<TE>   Cigarette makers say they do not condone cigarette smuggling but
cannot control the illegal cross-border trade.</TE>
<TE>   In his order Tuesday, Garaufis said that while arguably obsolete, the
revenue rule has not been supplanted by treaties or legislation by
Congress. Thus, "while times have changed greatly, the revenue rule has
not."</TE>
<TE>   Garaufis, who is under the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, several times
cited its reasoning last fall when it upheld the dismissal of Canada's
anti-smuggling lawsuit against R.J. Reynolds.</TE>

<HD>Ga. Board Stays Killer's Execution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles issued a stay of execution
Tuesday to a man who is so delusional, according to prison records, that
he believes actress Sigourney Weaver is God and talks to him.</LD>
<LD>   The board acted just a day before the state was going to execute
Alexander E. Williams IV for the 1986 murder of Aleta Carol Bunch, a high
school student and teenage model.</LD>
<LD>   Williams has been diagnosed as a "chronic paranoid schizophrenic" and
has been forcibly medicated. The five-member board acted after hearing
from supporters of his, including the president of the National Mental
Health Assn., as well as from the victim's mother, who said, "I don't
think he deserves to live anymore."</LD>
<TE>   The board issued a stay until Monday night, saying that "additional
time is required . . . to consider and pass on the substance of the
claims offered" in support of Williams' bid for clemency.</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Browning, a spokeswoman for the board, said the stay could be
dissolved, clearing the way for execution, or extended up to a total of
90 days. The board also could grant clemency.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' lead lawyer, Mark E. Olive, said he was pleased with the
board's action but quickly added, "We have no intention of letting the
attention die down." Williams' attorneys also have asked the Supreme
Court to review the case again. In addition to Williams' severe mental
illness, they have stressed the fact that Williams was 17 when he
murdered Bunch. Most nations in the world have banned executions for
juvenile offenders such as Williams.</TE>
<TE>   The Williams case has become a rallying point outside the United
States for opponents of capital punishment, with appeals to stop the
execution coming from top officials of the European Union and the United
Nations, as well as from international human rights groups, including
Amnesty International.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Mary
Robinson, joined the calls for commutation. The former Irish president
said in a statement at U.N. headquarters that there is "compelling
evidence" that Williams suffers from severe mental illness and noted that
the U.N. Commission on Human Rights recently asked governments not to
apply the death penalty to "anyone suffering from any form of mental
disorder."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Black Panther Is Deliberate Killer, Jury Told</HD>
<DH>Courts: The former H. Rap Brown shot a dying Georgia deputy in the
groin, prosecutor says at start of murder trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A prosecutor in opening arguments charged Tuesday that Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin, who was known in the turbulent 1960s as H. Rap Brown,
deliberately stood over a sheriff's deputy he had just shot and fired
three more bullets into the dying man's body.</LD>
<LD>   The bullets, prosecutor Kellie Stevens told the jury in Atlanta at the
start of Al-Amin's murder trial, were fired into the deputy's groin to
show that the shooting was intentional.</LD>
<LD>   Al-Amin, 58, who became a Muslim cleric after a past which included
several arrests and a conviction for armed robbery for which he served
time in New York state's Attica Correctional Institution, is charged with
killing Ricky Kinchen, a Fulton County deputy sheriff, and seriously
wounding Aldranon English, his partner.</LD>
<TE>   The two officers allegedly were trying to arrest Al-Amin on March 16,
2000, after a judge issued a bench warrant when Al-Amin failed to appear
for a hearing on charges of theft and impersonating a police officer.</TE>
<TE>   After the shooting, Al-Amin, who once served as minister of justice
for the Black Panther Party, was captured near Montgomery, Ala., by
police and federal agents who pursued him into the woods.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he proclaimed his innocence, stating: "It's a government
conspiracy."</TE>
<TE>   The trial was initially postponed after the terrorist attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Superior Court Judge Stephanie
Manis, who ordered the delay, ruled that anti-Muslim sentiment could make
it difficult to seat a jury.</TE>
<TE>   The jury, which includes nine blacks, was selected from a pool of
1,500 people.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens told the jurors that Al-Amin first opened fire with a .223
assault rifle when the deputies approached him. English returned fire and
sought cover while Kinchen also began shooting as he tried to protect his
partner.</TE>
<TE>   She said that when Al-Amin's rifle was empty, he retrieved a
9-millimeter pistol from his Mercedes-Benz and shot Kinchen, who already
was wounded, three times in the groin.</TE>
<TE>   English survived and identified Al-Amin from a photo lineup, the
prosecutor added. He also identified the Mercedes-Benz, which contained
bullet holes.</TE>
<TE>   The assault rifle and the pistol were found in the woods, Stevens
said. She told the jury that ballistic tests showed the weapons were used
in the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   In his opening statement, Jack Martin, a lawyer for Al-Amin, charged
that English was coerced by other police officers to select Al-Amin.</TE>
<TE>   The defense lawyer told the jury that other officers asked English if
he knew Al-Amin--perhaps hinting that Al-Amin's photograph would appear
in a photo lineup book English was shown in the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   English later selected Al-Amin's photograph from the mug book.</TE>
<TE>   Martin said that English, on the night of the shooting, reported that
he had wounded his assailant who had gray eyes.</TE>
<TE>   The defense lawyer said Al-Amin has brown eyes and was uninjured when
he was seized four days later.</TE>
<TE>   "The authorities made a mistake in this case," Martin charged, "They
assumed that Jamil Al-Amin must be guilty."</TE>
<TE>   Few activists in the 1960s were as controversial as Brown, who served
as a leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and later
joined the Black Panther Party. He urged blacks to arm themselves and
declared: "Violence is as American as cherry pie."</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, the FBI put him on its most wanted list after he failed to
appear to answer charges of inciting a riot after a speech he gave in
Cambridge, Md. He was arrested in New York in 1972, convicted of the
attempted robbery of a bar and was sentenced to five to 15 years in
prison. Brown served four years before being paroled.</TE>
<TE>   While in prison, Brown converted to Islam and changed his name to
Al-Amin. Later, he opened a grocery store in Atlanta and established a
mosque, where over almost a quarter of a century he developed the
reputation as a charismatic figure, whose supporters have been raising
funds for his defense.</TE>
<TE>   English, who like his slain partner is African American, is expected
to be a key prosecution witness who will testify about the attempted
arrest of Al-Amin and the deadly shootout that ensued.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>More than two-thirds of Americans with diabetes do not realize they
have a much higher than normal risk of heart disease and stroke, a survey
released Tuesday shows.</LD>
<LD>   People with diabetes also seem not to know that they can reduce their
risk by exercising, eating more healthy foods and taking medications to
lower blood pressure and cholesterol, says the survey, commissioned by
the American Diabetes Assn. and the American College of Cardiology.</LD>
<LD>   "So many people just do not make the connection between diabetes and
heart disease," Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson
said.</LD>
<TE>   "More than 16 million Americans have diabetes and that figure is
growing at an alarming rate," he added, citing Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention projections that the number will grow by 165% over
the next 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, who has taken on diabetes as a pet project, said he wants to
encourage exercise and a healthier lifestyle among all Americans.</TE>

<HD>Jurors Convict Physician in OxyContin Deaths</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI
</DL>
<LD>The potent mix of pills including the controversial drug OxyContin
became known as "Graves' cocktails." The parking lot at the doctor's
office was jammed by patients awaiting their turn for a prescription.</LD>
<LD>   "You've got to realize something's wrong when outside your office,
people are having tailgate parties," Assistant State Atty. Russell Edgar
said.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, a jury in the Florida Panhandle town of Milton agreed,
finding Dr. James Graves guilty of manslaughter in the deaths of four of
his patients from overdoses. The 55-year-old's conviction was believed to
be the first for a physician in deaths linked to abuse of OxyContin, a
synthetic opiate.</LD>
<TE>   Graves, who had been Florida's No. 1 prescriber of the powerful
painkiller, was also convicted of racketeering and unlawful delivery of a
controlled substance. He now faces up to 30 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Graves had maintained under oath that he had no idea his patients were
abusing drugs and that no one would have died if his patients had taken
their medication as he prescribed.</TE>
<TE>   "OxyContin is a good drug if taken properly," H.E. Ellis Jr., the
doctor's defense attorney, said. "Pharmacy companies don't spend billions
of dollars developing drugs if they are going to kill people."</TE>
<TE>   But the prosecution claimed Graves was desperate for money after he
lost jobs in the Navy, a Pensacola clinic and a state prison. When word
got around that the physician allegedly was indiscriminately prescribing
drugs, the patients--and money--began rolling in. Among addicts, "word
spread that he was the go-to doctor," Edgar told the jury in his
summation Monday. "He is no different than a drug dealer."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor estimated that Graves had been grossing $500,000 a year
from patients he saw at his pain management offices in his hometown of
Pace, Fla., north of Pensacola, and Brewton, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   According to drug abuse experts, addicts can obtain a heroin-like high
by chewing OxyContin pills or crushing them to make a solution for
intravenous injection.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicious of Graves' motives, more than 20 area pharmacists testified
that they had stopped filling prescriptions for what they dubbed "Graves'
cocktails"--a mix of OxyContin, painkillers, tranquilizers and muscle
relaxants.</TE>
<TE>   In his three days on the witness stand, Graves said that he was bound
to take his patients at their word when they said they were suffering and
needed drugs to alleviate the pain. "'It is a risk you have to accept
when treating these patients," the doctor said. "They are deserving of
treatment of their pain."</TE>

<HD>Sales of Homes Soar in Southland</HD>
<DH>Real estate:  January spike, which boosted prices, is
unlikely to be sustained, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buyers in the Southland snapped up homes last month at the most
hectic rate for a January in 13 years, triggering a steep run-up in
prices, according to a report released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles County, 8,087 new and existing condos and houses
were sold last month, up more than 22% from a year earlier and the
biggest volume for a January since the frenzied market of 1989. The
median price of homes sold advanced 17.5%, to a record $235,000,
according to DataQuick Information Systems Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Orange and Ventura counties also saw double-digit sales increases
last month, as consumers moved to lock in on low interest rates. More
renters have been driven to buy homes as rising apartment rents
approach the cost of homeownership.</LD>
<TE>   Although the January spike in sales was unusual and not likely to
be sustained, analysts said the DataQuick report reaffirmed the
enduring strength of the housing market, which has cushioned the
blows of an otherwise sluggish economy.</TE>
<TE>   A separate national report Tuesday said that construction of new
homes and apartments in January far exceeded expectations, partly
helped by the milder winter weather. And some home builders said
orders early this year were running at a brisk pace, indicating
consumers are becoming more confident about the economy.</TE>
<TE>   At Westwood-based KB Home, the nation's third-largest home
builder, orders for new homes in California jumped almost 27% last
month from a year earlier, Chief Executive Bruce Karatz said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a growing consensus that the economy has seen its worst
days, and while [consumers are] unsure about how quickly it will
recover, they're no longer concerned that we're in a downward
spiral," Karatz said.  "That puts a floor on prices and gives people
confidence they can buy without making a bad choice in timing."</TE>
<TE>   Many buyers in the Southland felt January was the right time.</TE>
<TE>   DataQuick's report showed that sales in Los Angeles County climbed
more than 20% in every category--existing houses and condos as well
as new homes. John Karevoll, the analyst who prepared the report,
said the January figures were somewhat inflated by sales carried over
from December, when lenders were slowed by the refinancing boom.
DataQuick's report is based on escrow closings.</TE>
<TE>   Karevoll cautioned against reading too much into one month's data.
In fact, when combining sales in November, December and January, the
total is up a more modest 3.3% from the three-month period a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Los Angeles County home sales in recent months have been
outpacing those in more expensive markets such as Orange County,
largely because of its more abundant supply of lower-priced homes.
But the strong demand and sales are reducing inventory levels, and
that is triggering a surge in prices.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the 17.5% jump in the median price last
month was the strongest since August 1989, when prices rose 19.5%,
according to DataQuick.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frightening to see prices going up like this," said Wendy
Furth, a Coldwell Banker agent in Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   More-affordable homes are moving especially fast.</TE>
<TE>   At the present sales pace, the current supply of resale homes on
the market would be depleted in 2.9 months in Los Angeles County and
in 2.3 months in Orange County, according to the California Assn. of
Realtors</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times before something comes on the market there's
already an offer on it," said Ian Medina, president of SIM Real
Estate in Los Angeles. He said the number of renters looking to
become purchasers in the $230,000 range or lower has increased
rapidly in recent months because of expanding programs that help
first-time buyers. "There's a lack of inventory in our market, and
that translates into a seller's market."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said that pricier homes--those costing $500,000 or
more--in Los Angeles and Orange counties are generally showing
minimal rates of appreciation, compared with those in communities
such as Compton, South-Central Los Angeles, Palmdale and Inglewood,
which are showing double-digit price gains.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, which also experienced the best January in 13
years, sales jumped 14% from a year earlier, to 3,134 houses and
condos. The median price of those sales was $308,000, or nearly 12%
ahead of last year, but was down from the $332,000 mark in December
largely because fewer expensive new homes were sold.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County also saw steep growth, as the median price rose 10%
to $284,000 from a year ago. Sales jumped 28% from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Data for Riverside and San Bernardino counties were not  available
Tuesday.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Newport Corp. said Tuesday that it completed its acquisition of
privately held Micro Robotics Systems Inc. for $65 million in cash,
stock and options.</LD>
<LD>   Newport, an Irvine maker of components used in industries ranging
from fiber-optic telecommunications to aerospace, said the
transaction should slightly boost yearly results, which analysts are
estimating at 7 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   Micro Robotics, a privately held maker of high-precision systems
for fiber-optic communications, microwave and semiconductor equipment
markets, is expected to generate sales of $13 million to $16 million
for the full year, down from about $26 million last, year because of
the sluggish fiber-optic market, Newport said.</LD>
<TE>   Micro Robotics is based in North Billerica, Mass.</TE>

<HD>Must They 'Tremble Before G-d'?</HD>
<DH>Documentary * The film describes the anguish of men and
women trying to reconcile their homosexuality and Orthodox Jewish
religion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH HANANIA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sandi Simcha DuBowski's slight frame slumps, his face and shoulders
barely registering over the tabletop at a Santa Monica restaurant.
His fingers shred a piece of bread until only a mound of crumbs
remains. Catching himself, he apologizes in a voice so soft that a
reporter must lean forward to hear him.</LD>
<LD>   Not exactly the image of a man who just directed a film that's
stirring controversy in his own religious community. And yet that's
what DuBowski, 31, has done with his film about gays in the Orthodox
Jewish community, a film that's tested his faith. "Trembling Before
G-d," (Orthodox Jews believe that writing out God's name is a sin),
is an 84-minute documentary opening today in Los Angeles and over the
next two weeks in San Francisco, San Diego and Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Since debuting in New York in October, then opening in Boston,
Philadelphia, Washington and Baltimore, the film has lighted one fire
after another. A New York Times review said, "DuBowski latches on to
a provocative subject and invests it with a compelling tenderness ...
unforgettable," and Newsday called it "Haunted. Eloquent.
Devastating."</LD>
<TE>   The negative reaction has been equally strong. Mexico City's
Jewish Federation banned it from its film festival, the international
ultra-Orthodox group Agudath Israel denounced it as "Dissembling
Before G-d" and protesters stormed the lobby of Baltimore's Charles
Theater when it opened there.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, Rabbi Yosef Kanefsky of Congregation B'nai David-Judea
plans to screen the film for select members of his Orthodox Westside
congregation.</TE>
<TE>   Before viewing an early version of the film, Kanefsky said, "I had
never really thought about the issue." Now, after seeing it, he says,
"The film is potentially very important. Hopefully, it will trigger
thoughtful discussion in our community, which is behind the rest of
American society" in acknowledging gay lives.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kanefsky would discourage any gay member from coming out to
his congregation. "It's nonproductive," he said. "I'm not sure that
the larger community would react constructively." And like Rabbi
Steve Weil of Congregation Beth Jacob in Beverly Hills, the West's
largest Orthodox synagogue, Kanefsky believes that Jewish law
prohibits gay sex under all circumstances. (The Conservative and
Reform branches of Judaism largely accept gay sexuality).</TE>
<TE>   This, in a nutshell, is the windmill against which DuBowski has
tilted. Not that this only son of a Brooklyn syrup manufacturer who
came out to his parents at age 18 with only minor discomfort--his
parents were Conservative Jews--would seem the most likely candidate
for this job.  It started six years ago, when DuBowski, fresh out of
Harvard, met Mark Silas, a rabbi's son turned drag queen in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark and I became brothers," says DuBowski, a New York filmmaker.
Which was fortunate because DuBowski, by then interested in making a
film about the subject, found it "virtually impossible" to find other
gay Orthodox Jews willing to go on record.</TE>
<TE>   DuBowski filmed Silas visiting the rabbis under whom he had
studied and eventually found other candidates for his film. One is
Israel Fishman, a 58-year-old Manhattan printer who had written to
his 98-year-old father requesting a meeting to end their 20-year
estrangement. Fishman's father wrote back that he could not yet see
his son but would talk with him on the phone.</TE>
<TE>   The film listens in on the approximately 90-second call, nearly
all of it Fishman's father telling how busy he is with
synagogue-oriented tasks and so still has no time to see his son.
What comes through is the father's dread, his high-pitched tone and
frantic pace forming a verbal wall. We witness the younger Fishman's
slumped reaction but cannot miss hearing his father's terror. The
father died a year later, never reconciling with his son, says
DuBowski.</TE>
<TE>   Also profiled is a woman married 20 years who has borne her
husband seven children. She can no longer stand her husband's sexual
touch. In shadow, she tells how she proposed that she and her husband
forgo sex, an idea he has vetoed.</TE>
<TE>   Coming apart before our eyes, she admits feeling guilty that she
can't satisfy her husband. Nor can she bear to leave the Orthodox
community she considers her home. And so she continues to live as a
conventional Orthodox Jewish wife.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to witness this and not be moved by her conflict, which
in a sense became a problem for DuBowski as a filmmaker. With 450
hours of film, he found it increasingly difficult to maintain a
proper distance from his subjects, even as he repeatedly traveled to
Israel to interview the country's top rabbis. Some of them refused to
meet with him; others hung up on him in mid-conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, as is traditional, he arrived at 4 a.m. to line up for an
audience in Jerusalem with Israel's chief Sephardic rabbi. Hours
later, DuBowski asked the rabbi for guidance on the matter. "The
rabbi replied that homosexuality is an animalistic abomination," says
DuBowski. "What could I say?"</TE>
<TE>   The rabbi's reaction deeply troubled DuBowski. Was he, he
wondered, somehow damaging his own religion by being gay and
challenging Orthodox values? (DuBowski now considers himself an
Orthodox Jew). Should he marry even though he feels no attraction to
women? Is abstinence or a contrived heterosexuality the path to the
Orthodox holy life he craves? It could not be, he decided.</TE>
<TE>   "The film made me appreciate my parents more," he said. "They
always honored me, no matter what."</TE>
<TE>   DuBowski sees his film as a rite of passage. "Before, I kept many
parts of my life separate. This film brought it all together. Now I'm
a man for all the right reasons."</TE>
<TE>   The film, initially scheduled for a two-week run after its Oct. 24
opening in New York, is still playing there. Likewise, it's still
running strong four weeks after opening at the Charles Theater in
Baltimore, where it had been booked for just one week.</TE>
<TE>   "We took a chance on it and have done very well," says Charles
Theater owner Buzz Cusack. "It's a beautiful film."</TE>

<HD>Exhibit Reveals Themes Common to O'Keeffe, Kahlo and Carr</HD>
<DH>Art* The three North Americans, each from a different
country, shared a passion for the natural world and an interest in
surrounding cultures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JO ANN LEWIS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>If ever a show was ideal for the National Museum of Women in the
Arts, "Places of Their Own: Emily Carr, Georgia O'Keeffe and Frida
Kahlo" is it. The first exhibition to combine these three important
20th century artists, it has already broken attendance records in
Toronto and Santa Fe.</LD>
<LD>   The National Museum of Women in the Arts is hoping for big crowds
here as well until the show closes May 12.</LD>
<LD>   The 62 works on view, most of them rarely seen in the United
States, explore the artistic and biographical links among these North
American artists, all of whom blossomed between the two world wars:
Carr (1871-1945) in Canada, O'Keeffe (1887-1986) in the United States
and Kahlo (1907-1954) in Mexico. The most refreshing surprise here is
that O'Keeffe is not the star of this show--in part because of
relatively weak representation. The exhibition belongs to Carr, who
is far too little known in the United States. Carr's powerful,
passionate paintings of lush Canadian rain forests will astound
audiences unfamiliar with her work.</LD>
<TE>   Kahlo is also revealed in unusual depth with 15 significant works,
including rare, sometimes surreal still lifes.</TE>
<TE>   The three shared a passion for the natural world, as well as an
interest in and concern for the surrounding cultures. Carr's earliest
paintings are of indigenous Indian villages, totem poles and mythical
beings in her native British Columbia. O'Keeffe painted Penitente
crosses and kachina dolls, the most poetic of which, "Kokopelli With
Snow" from 1942, hangs in this show.</TE>
<TE>   College of Santa Fe art historian Sharyn Udall conceived the idea
for this exhibition seven years ago, when she first noticed the
remarkable resonance between O'Keeffe and Carr. Both had defined,
through their art, the look of the places where they lived: "What
O'Keeffe did for the colorful hills and high desert of Santa Fe, Carr
had done for the west coast of Canada," Udall says. Their interest in
expressing a national identity through their art prompted Udall to
add Kahlo to the mix.</TE>
<TE>   "Kahlo was working with the same kind of idea," Udall says,
"trying to express what she called her Mexicanidad, or Mexican
essence, roots and spirit." Kahlo herself was a living example of the
blended culture of Mexico: her mother was half indigenous Indian,
half Spanish. With her husband, the famous Mexican muralist Diego
Rivera, Kahlo was also deeply involved with the left-wing
revolutionary politics that helped shape modern Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Udall's subsequent research resulted in the recent book "Carr,
O'Keeffe, Kahlo: Places of Their Own" (Yale University Press), as
well as this traveling exhibition, which is organized according to
the book's three basic themes: nature, culture and public self.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers accustomed to seeing an artist's work separately, and in
chronological sequence, may be frustrated by this show, which is
meant to underscore the artists' common ground.</TE>
<TE>   So if you're caught in the thrall of Carr's glorious "Western
Forest" (1931) and eager to learn more about her, you may instead
find yourself rerouted to the nature-based paintings of O'Keeffe. And
then to those of Kahlo, for whom nature served mainly as metaphorical
connective tissue in her mostly autobiographical paintings.</TE>
<TE>   Moving on to the "Culture" section, you pick up Carr's trail in
masterpieces like 1931's "Big Raven," produced, like "Western
Forest," once Carr had summoned the courage to paint again after a
long hiatus. In these works, she returns to her earlier
subjects--totems in particular--but with a newly mature and
impassioned style that shows a thorough understanding of modernism.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these later works rival and recall the landscapes of
Marsden Hartley and the German Expressionists.</TE>
<TE>   O'Keeffe and Kahlo both married famous, much older artists
(respectively, photographer Alfred Stieglitz and Rivera) who vastly
advanced their celebrity. Carr, who went it alone, had a much tougher
time and attained modest recognition only 10 years before her death,
as a result of a show of Canadian painters at the Tate Gallery in
London. Soon thereafter, her paintings entered the National Gallery
and the Art Gallery of Toronto. But she sounded a lot like O'Keeffe
when she said: "I don't care what people think of my work. Lots of
people hate it. I can't help that. I am trying to express something I
feel, to satisfy myself."</TE>
<TE>   The final section of this show, "The Public Self," sets out to
demonstrate how these artists revealed themselves through their work.
But it really says more about their private selves. There are some
silly O'Keeffes, including "Dark Tree Trunks" (1946), which would be
utterly meaningless here without the accompanying O'Keeffe quote:
"When I paint trees I am trees." But there are also some very good
pictures here, including Carr's unforgiving 1938 "Self-Portrait" with
its riveting gaze. Carr paints herself as a mountain of a woman,
which she apparently saw herself to be. The work hangs provocatively
next to Carr's darkly mysterious 1933 painting "The Mountain," which
Carr described as an "uncorseted woman."</TE>
<TE>   Kahlo's striking 1946 portrait of herself as a wounded deer
punctured by arrows is also telling. Like nearly everything she
painted, "The Little Deer" is a metaphor for her physical suffering,
which was apparently endless: A victim of childhood polio, she was
then badly hurt in a bus accident that left her crippled for life.
This painting, made shortly before her gangrenous foot had to be
amputated, connects her suffering to that of the Christian martyr St.
Sebastian, who was shot through with arrows. Just a few years later
Kahlo was dead at age 47.</TE>
<TE>   At some point in this show, you can't help wondering what these
three eccentric, highly independent thinkers would say about being
lumped together in one exhibition. "O'Keeffe probably wouldn't like
it because she didn't like showing with anyone but herself," Udall
says.</TE>
<TE>   And Kahlo, unfortunately, might be too ill to know or care. As for
Carr, Udall agreed that she'd probably be thrilled to be in the
company of such legendary artists, wholly unaware that she had become
one of them.</TE>

<HD>NBC's Promos a Sport in Themselves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you've watched any of the Winter Olympics (and ratings data
indicate that more than 170 million U.S. residents have tuned in for
at least a while), odds are you've seen more than a few promos for
Julia Louis-Dreyfus' new NBC series, "Watching Ellie," which
premieres next week. The question is, did those promos make you want
to watch the show or toss eggs at the sets where it's being filmed?</LD>
<LD>   There's a fine line when it comes to promotion, and networks
appear increasingly tempted to cross it, as NBC did a few weeks ago
by singling out a small subplot on "The West Wing" about a journalist
missing abroad, clearly trying to tap into the life-mirrors-art
abduction of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.</LD>
<LD>   When NBC agreed to pay billions for rights to the Olympics through
2008, one big rationale was that the Games provide an unparalleled
platform to promote the network's programming, an extended version of
what the Super Bowl, Academy Awards and other major events reliably
do. Even "Friends," to which NBC recently committed more than $150
million to renew for a final year, justifies that price tag in part
because the series offers a similar promotional showcase on a weekly
basis.</LD>
<TE>   Because network ratings have become fragmented by an explosion of
viewing options, a single channel seldom draws that sort of sprawling
crowd into the tent simultaneously anymore, making programmers ever
more desperate to capitalize on such opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   But do television's old promotional tricks really work on jaded,
media-savvy viewers as well as they once did? And even if they do,
what exactly are broadcasters telling us with the messages they send?</TE>
<TE>   Consider local TV news, where the long-standing strategy has been
simply to try to scare people into watching. Just last week, for
example, KNBC-TV teased a story before the network's Olympic coverage
began as follows: "It could be in your child's playground. A silent
killer. What is it? Find out at 11." Sorry, but if there is a silent
killer in their child's playground, one suspects most people would
want to know about it right now.</TE>
<TE>   Picking up where it left off with restaurants during an earlier
sweeps period, KCBS-TV has also sought to alarm people with shrieking
ads about pedophiles who might be living in your neighborhood and
about valet parking attendants. Based on KCBS' promos, you
half-expect that parking attendants (just the mere words invoke
terror) will be this year's most popular Halloween costume.</TE>
<TE>   Network news is only slightly more restrained on this score,
regularly teasing "what you need to know" about some potential--and,
on closer inspection, often colossally remote--danger.</TE>
<TE>   Lacking the means to frighten you into watching "The Job" or
"Titus," entertainment programs tend to rely upon a steady dose of
hype, lies and videotape, a point that hasn't been lost on reader
Brian Magnuson, whose observational skills doubtless have something
to do with his first name. Magnuson wrote in, wanting to know how
Fox, for starters, could tout the since-canceled "The Chamber" as a
show "all of America is talking about" when, as he put it, "Nobody I
know even knows it's on."</TE>
<TE>   He was just warming up. "ABC says the final five minutes of 'The
Practice' is 'the most shocking five minutes you'll ever witness.'
Uh, no, it wasn't. And NBC implores viewers to stick around for 'the
last two minutes' of 'Scrubs'? What does that say about the first
28?"</TE>
<TE>   If these sleight-of-hand tricks occur at every network, NBC--whose
promotional gurus take a back seat to no one--has elevated the craft
to near-legendary heights. Indeed, it was only a few years ago that
producers of "Frasier" were so annoyed by NBC's giving away jokes
during promos that they withheld footage from an episode, prompting
the network to cobble together ads saying the show's opening that
week was so funny, "We can't show it to you."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the back story to NBC's Olympic promos, minus the maudlin
piano music that historically accompanies these back stories, is that
the corporate clock is clearly ticking in terms of establishing some
new hits.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, NBC managed to renew "Friends" for another year, but that
show is near its end, and the network is paying millions for the
privilege of keeping that program, "Frasier" and "ER" on its
schedule, with another expensive negotiation for "The West Wing"
still to come.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, "Will &amp; Grace" doesn't appear to be the sort of
mass-appeal hit to prop up a night as have those venerable
franchises, which, despite their enduring popularity, yield
diminishing financial returns because of the huge fees the network is
shelling out. In other words, NBC needs to establish some worthy
successors soon, or "Must-See TV" will be "Musty TV" faster than you
can say "Inside Schwartz."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the Olympics, moreover, NBC has largely bowed out of the
expensive TV rights bidding for major sports, relinquishing NFL
football to CBS in 1998 and NBA basketball next season to desperate
ABC. Although NBC is losing gobs of money on the NBA, televising the
championship series in June has traditionally attracted a vast
audience--and especially hard-to-reach males--to which the network
can promote new offerings, last summer helping spawn the bug-munching
"Fear Factor."</TE>
<TE>   All told, then, NBC's downhill run through the Olympics is only
the preliminary event in its uphill battle to inspire you--yes,
you--to hang around long enough to sample its shows after the luge
screeches to a halt.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, of course, some enterprising Silicon Valley wizard
will perfect technology to literally reach through the set and grab
you, but until then, squeezing promos for "Watching Ellie" and new
"Friends" tag-along "Leap of Faith" into every nook and cranny of
Olympic coverage is the next best thing. Because rest assured, this
race for the gold has begun, the finish line is approaching and the
plan to win the judges' hearts, apparently, is a double axel with a
twist that lands on just this side of begging and pleading.</TE>

<HD>'Sophisticated Ladies' Is More About Mary</HD>
<DH>In a touring production of the song-and-dance revue, the
focus is more on ex-Supreme Mary Wilson than on Duke Ellington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sophistication has always been a quality associated with Duke
Ellington.</LD>
<LD>   It begins right there in his nickname. Born Edward Kennedy
Ellington, he was called Duke by a boyhood friend who admired his
regal air. He fully grew into the name by writing music that combined
ragtime piano, call-and-response technique, classical symphonic
devices and other forms into a lush, propulsive sound.</LD>
<LD>   In 1981, much of the best-known of this music was played on
Broadway in a music and tap-dance extravaganza called "Sophisticated
Ladies." Though the show proved to be curiously uninvolving there and
in Los Angeles in 1982, it was, at least, a classy, flashy affair.</LD>
<TE>   The same cannot be said of a production that has begun a national
tour with a stop through tonight at the Cerritos Center for the
Performing Arts. What was once an ensemble show has been so
resolutely focused on original Supremes member Mary Wilson that
Ellington fades into the background.</TE>
<TE>   Originally announced as a lavish production, staged by Ellington's
talented granddaughter, Mercedes, the show arrives instead with a
cast of just 14 singers and dancers, directed and choreographed by
Roger Spivy. The under-rehearsed show was plagued Monday night by bad
miking, botched lighting and overall bad timing.</TE>
<TE>   On a more fundamental level, Wilson wasn't always suited to the
music. Her dusky, sometimes gritty voice is quite capable of
generating electricity, but her musical temperament is another
matter.</TE>
<TE>   She connects most instinctively with the up-tempo numbers, as when
she breaks into scat in "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That
Swing)" or when she infuses a playful sexiness into the Billy
Strayhorn classic "Take the 'A' Train," complete with breathy
"ooh-ooh" train sounds. She struggles through most of the torch
songs, however, showing effort where there should be none in the
cascading sighs of such tunes as "Solitude" and "Something to Live
For."</TE>
<TE>   The other female vocalists outshine Wilson, which even the
Wilson-loving Monday night audience betrayed in its more spontaneous
response to them. In tempos ranging from the sassy "Hit Me With a Hot
Note and Watch Me Bounce" to the sultry "Mood Indigo," Luci Lucil
displays one of those rich, honeyed voices that comes from somewhere
so deep inside that it seems to be rising from all the way down in
her toes. And Jen Mize lends a big, '40s band-singer style to
"Caravan."</TE>
<TE>   The production contains far less tap than the original, which was
presided over by Gregory Hines and Hinton Battle. Still, the group
dance numbers are its most polished aspect, especially a
jungle-themed Cotton Club-style number that puts the women dancers
(Mize, Lisa Beasley, Crystal Eden and Rachael Sellars-Montoya) in
bikinis sprouting palm fronds and sends them undulating through "The
Mooche."</TE>
<TE>   The instrumentals are handled by a horn-heavy 14-member ensemble
that, as of Monday, wasn't playing cohesively under
trumpeter-bandleader Barrie Lee Hall Jr. What's more, the sound
levels had them drowning out the vocalists, who too often found
themselves singing in the dark or into either overactive or dead
mikes.</TE>
<TE>   With so many problems, sophistication is the least of this show's
attributes.</TE>

<HD>Petersen Seeks More Space to Park Collection</HD>
<DH>Museums* It wants to add 65,000 square feet to its 200,000
by early 2004. The board will screen architects today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Looking for more space in which to display its collection of 275
vehicles, the Petersen Automotive Museum is making plans for a
$20-million to $30-million expansion of its building on Wilshire
Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   Museum Director Dick Messer said he expects the museum to unveil a
capital campaign in September or October, aiming to begin
construction about a year from now and to complete the addition in
early 2004.</LD>
<LD>   The Petersen Museum, founded in 1994 under the aegis of the
Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, stepped up to full
independence in 2000, when founding benefactors Robert E. and Margie
Petersen contributed $24.8 million to pay off the fledgling
institution's debts and give it outright ownership of its building. A
funding shortfall before that had threatened the museum's future.</LD>
<TE>   Messer said the museum is hoping to add 65,000 square feet to its
current 200,000-square-foot space by adding to the existing museum's
third and fourth floors. He noted that the building, constructed 40
years ago as a department store, was designed with such an expansion
in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "The infrastructure is there," Messer said. "It's always been a
plan to do something with the building. We'd like to have the
architect chosen by June."</TE>
<TE>   The museum foundation's six board members will hear presentations
today from six prospective architects. Board Chairman Bruce Meyer
said the competitors are Jerde Partnership International, based in
Venice; Keating/Khang, based in Los Angeles; AC Martin Partners,
which has offices in Los Angeles, Irvine and Sacramento; Ellerbe
Becket, a global firm with its largest office in Minneapolis and a
California office in San Francisco; Gensler, another global firm with
offices in Los Angeles; and Mark Whipple of Russell Group.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's existing space allows for display of about 150
vehicles at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem we've got with the Petersen is that when you drive
by, you have no idea what's inside. It's not just a bunch of cars
lined up against a wall," Messer said. The addition, he said, would
not only make room for more vehicles and creative presentations, but
would allow space for a special-event room seating up to 700, and
perhaps a smaller theatrical space.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get all the money before we start," said Messer. He
declined to say how much the museum's backers have committed to the
effort so far, but said he had secured "pledges from some very
substantial people."</TE>
<TE>   Messer said the museum counts 1,800 members (who each contribute
$50 yearly or more) and an annual budget of about $3 million, which
supports 28 employees. Meyer, the board chairman, said he expected
the project's first phase, including the drafting of a master plan
and basic construction, would probably cost $13 million to $15
million. Meyer said the next phase, dependent on programming
decisions yet to be made, is likely to bring the total tab to $20
million to $30 million.</TE>

<HD>Small Stages, SCR Lead Circle Nominations</HD>

<LD>Small theaters dominate the nominations for the 2001 Los Angeles
Drama Critics Circle Awards. But the larger South Coast Repertory led
the pack in total nominations for a single company (nine) and in the
special awards that were announced with the nominations Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Four productions that were in sub-100-seat theaters garnered the
most nominations for individual shows. "They Shoot Horses, Don't
They?" received eight, followed by "Big River" and "Orson's Shadow"
with six each, and "The Birthday Party" with five.</LD>
<LD>   South Coast Rep, however, won the Margaret Harford Award for
sustained excellence--an honor usually given to a smaller theater.

script for "The Beard of Avon," which played at South Coast Rep last
summer.</LD>

<HD>Solace for Gays Who Are Orthodox Jews</HD>
<DH>'Trembling Before G-d,' a documentary by Sandi Simcha
DuBowski, looks at the conflict between honoring one's religion and
sexual orientation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sandi Simcha DuBowski's wonderful documentary, "Trembling Before
G-d," extends a warm embrace to those struggling to reconcile sexual
orientation with the teachings of the religion in which they were
raised and which they cherish.</LD>
<LD>   Many, perhaps most, gay people in the name of their sanity and
self-respect, either turn their backs on the traditional organized
religions that reject or condemn them or create their own religious
organizations. But there are those who hunger to participate in the
religion of their families.</LD>
<LD>   While DuBowski explores the plight of Orthodox Jews, both in
America and abroad, what he discovers applies to gay Catholics,
Mormons and members of other religions worldwide.</LD>
<TE>   In its most extreme forms, Orthodox Jewry holds that acts of
homosexuality are punishable by death. A more moderate stance holds
that homosexuality is evil or, at the very least, a sickness.</TE>
<TE>   Even the kindest, most caring of the Orthodox rabbis DuBowski
interviews believe that gay men and women must remain celibate and
devote their lives trying to pray away their orientation.</TE>
<TE>   DuBowski has cast admirably far and wide for his interviews,
giving the work global scope. In some instances, DuBowski is pretty
clearly a proactive documentarian, inspiring some of his interviewees
to dare to take steps that are risky and revealing.</TE>
<TE>   Among those we meet is David, an Angeleno in his 30s who struggled
for years to change his sexual orientation. Concluding that Judaism
does not mean people to endure such suffering, he confronts the rabbi
who 20 years earlier advised him to seek "reparative" therapy.</TE>
<TE>   We then meet Michelle, who grew up in Boro Park, Brooklyn,
believing she must be the only Hasidic lesbian in the world and
allowing herself to be pressured into marriage. Largely disowned by
her family, Michelle is a woman of resilient good humor and
self-acceptance. "Malka" and "Leah," who, like several other
interviewees, feel they dare not reveal their names or faces on
camera, run a hotline for desperate Orthodox gays. They find strength
in their love for each other but continue to suffer family rejection.
They also fear that their love may prevent them from entering heaven.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most colorful of DuBowski's people is Israel, a
58-year-old New Yorker who long ago decided that to be Orthodox and
to be gay was impossible and who therefore turned his back on his
religion, but not before his family had coerced him into submitting
to electro-shock treatment.</TE>
<TE>   He finds therapy in conducting "Big Knish" tours of Brooklyn's
Hasidic neighborhoods. As he prepares to celebrate 25 years with his
life partner, he telephones his 98-year-old father, whom he has not
seen in some 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   In Israel, DuBowski meets "Devorah," a long-married mother and
grandmother who sees no way out of her predicament as a lesbian yet
is persuaded to attend a public gay and lesbian gathering. Although
she says she does not favor gay rights, she does feel exhilarated by
being out for a few hours.</TE>
<TE>   Among others DuBowski interviews are Shlomo Ashkinazy, a
psychotherapist who has run a confidential support group for Orthodox
gay men for nearly 20 years, and Rabbi Steven Greenberg, who DuBowski
says is the world's first openly gay Orthodox rabbi. He is a key
figure in the movement to end the isolation of gay Orthodox men and
women, to encourage them to organize and debate a 1,000-year-old
tradition that condemns them.</TE>
<TE>   The hope of Greenberg and others is that the more awareness
Orthodox Judaism has of gays and lesbians, the less inclined it will
be to demonize them.</TE>
<TE>   For his participation in this documentary, DuBowski rewarded
Greenberg uniquely: He played matchmaker, bringing together the rabbi
and the man he's been with for the last two years.</TE>

<LD>Nick Pugh has found what he believes is the automotive future:
Looking a bit like a golden-carapaced beetle crossbred with a lunar
rover, it is gloriously noisy, highly interactive and, if Pugh ever
gets it tuned just right, would move like a thoroughbred racing
machine.</LD>
<LD>   It seats two, but barely has storage space for one headed out on a
short day trip. It won't keep you dry in the rain or warm in the
snow, and it runs on compressed natural gas rather than exotic fuels
such as hydrogen or nuclear energy.</LD>
<LD>   It cost Pugh and his sponsors almost $100,000--plus easily three
times that in Pugh's labor. The odds of it ever serving as more than
a visual demonstration of one dreamer's ideas are long indeed.</LD>
<TE>   But Pugh doesn't mind. In fact, it is to demonstrate his dream
that he's spent the last 12 years immersed in creating what he calls
the personal concept car.</TE>
<TE>   It now has a formal name, Xeno III (there was no Xeno I or II),
and a biographer, Mark Christensen, who has just published a 380-page
book, "Build the Perfect Beast," that chronicles Pugh's quest.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, this is just Pugh's vision--other dreamers of things
automotive have conjured sleek rocket-ship designs, swoopy open
roadsters with silent electric motors, roaring super cars with
carbon-fiber skins and titanium skeletons, even wheel-less pods that
float on cushions of air along electromagnetically-defined roadways.</TE>
<TE>   Pugh figures there's room for everyone in the future he foresees.
"A car is a robotic skin that you wear," he insisted. "It should
represent your personality and style, just as jewelry and clothes
do."</TE>
<TE>   That's what Xeno is all about.</TE>
<TE>   Pugh trained as a car designer at Pasadena's Art Center College of
Design but supports himself and his automotive pursuits by doing
computer graphics for Hollywood movie makers and Madison Avenue
product pushers. He turned to the entertainment industry to practice
his art because he believed that working for a car company would be
too confining.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be able to design the car I wanted, not the cars the
marketing executives wanted," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pugh is more futurist than pragmatist: His concept is meant to
show what cars could look like if a futuristic "personal product
manufacturing process" that he's imagined could be made real.</TE>
<TE>   Xeno has a skin of flat aluminum panels and clear glass,
representative of carbon-based crystalline shapes that could be
grown, he said, in a small hydrocarbon processing plant to fit the
specifications of any vehicle design a customer wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the enormous and unimaginably expensive mainframe
computers of the 1950s becoming the cheap, almost disposable PCs we
all use today," Pugh said.</TE>
<TE>   To "grow" the first organic car in the first personal product
manufacturing system might cost $2 million, but widespread use and
development of the concepts, he said, could get the cost down to
$1,000 or $1,500 per car. "Cheap enough so you could keep the same
frame and running gear and change body styles with the seasons, like
you change wardrobes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pugh's manufacturing process . may never become reality, but Xeno
is real, and it runs, although a tuning bug kept it from running well
in all speed ranges the day we went for a drive.</TE>
<TE>   Pugh used a 502-cubic-inch marine engine from General Motors,
beefed it up with a supercharger, and linked it to the tires through
a Corvette rear end and a dragster transmission powerful enough to
handle the 500-plus horsepower output.</TE>
<TE>   For fuel, he chose compressed natural gas (CNG) because it is more
environmentally friendly than gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   His patented chassis design incorporates a pair of carbon-fiber
CNG storage tanks big enough to give Xeno the cruising range of a
"normal" car, Pugh said. The chassis is made of chromolly steel and
aluminum and incorporates race-derived independent front and rear
suspension systems.</TE>
<TE>   The car is open to the air because Pugh sees it as a "reduction
design," a distillate of what a car should be. "I wanted to do the
first one in a way that would connect the driver to the road and to
display the function of the vehicle, not cover it with styling
elements," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So Xeno is skeletal by purpose. Clear glass panels in the nose and
alongside the cabin enable driver and passenger to watch the road, to
follow the ups and downs of the suspension members, to see cables
stretch as the brakes are applied, to watch the longitudinally
mounted shock absorbers compress and extend with each bump in the
asphalt.</TE>
<TE>   The design theme--organic, environmentally friendly,
performance-oriented and interactive--holds together, and even if
Xeno isn't every car-lover's dream, the fact that it runs establishes
it as proof that dreams can come true.</TE>
<TE>   "This car is about learning," Pugh said. "It is about engineering
and learning to understand how a car works."</TE>
<TE>   So he can realize his next dream. And the one after that.</TE>
<TE>   As car makers from Henry Ford to Carroll Shelby and Steve Saleen
attest, that's what being a car dreamer is all about--turning the
ephemeral into metal and rubber, cranking up the engine and hitting
the road.</TE>

<HD>Auto Makers Take Steps to Protect Pedestrians</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The rising incidence of car versus pedestrian accidents in Los
Angeles (Your Wheels, Feb. 6) prompted reader Charles Hiigel of San
Luis Obispo to wonder what, if anything, auto makers are doing to
improve the chances of those on foot surviving a collision with a car
or truck.</LD>
<LD>   Auto makers long have been researching ways to make vehicles more
pedestrian-friendly, and a few have added features to help reduce
injuries to the pedestrian in a vehicle versus walker collision.</LD>
<LD>   But overall, making cars safer for pedestrians has not been a high
priority, especially in the United States, auto industry officials
and safety advocates agree.</LD>
<TE>   The auto industry has been talking for years about items like
exterior air bags and redesigned hoods that would reduce pedestrian
injuries, but there's been very little initiative to incorporate the
technology in today's vehicles, said Clarence Ditlow, executive
director of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that the technology isn't there. These safety features
are known lifesavers," Ditlow said. "[But] unless government is
willing to set regulations, auto makers are not likely to voluntarily
offer them," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Though pedestrian fatalities and injuries are of concern in the
United States, the problem is much more serious in other countries.</TE>
<TE>   There were 5,000 pedestrian fatalities in the U.S. in 1999. Nearly
7,000 pedestrians were killed the same year in Western Europe, while
Japan reported 3,000 pedestrian deaths.</TE>
<TE>   To help curb deaths and injuries, auto makers have given the
European Union a voluntary commitment to improve vehicle designs for
pedestrian safety.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, auto makers will implement new safety
measures this year that will include redesigning vehicle front ends,
abolishing so-called cow bars (brush guards in the U.S.) and
introducing anti-lock braking systems on all cars.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., Honda has introduced a redesigned hood on some
late-model Civics and CRVs to provide a softer crumple zone--the
sheet metal isn't as rigid--to reduce pedestrian head injuries during
an accident. The auto maker also has readjusted window wipers to make
the windshield area less dangerous to pedestrians if they are hit and
thrown onto the hood, according to Greg Thomas, a senior engineer
with Honda's research and development department.</TE>
<TE>   And Ford Motor Co. has been testing the use of exterior air bags
as a way to reduce pedestrian injuries, said Sara Tatchio, a Ford
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   In a concept pedestrian safety car developed in 2000, Ford
outfitted an Explorer SUV with a pair of exterior air bags designed
to protect pedestrians in an accident.</TE>
<TE>   The system is designed to provide head protection when a
pedestrian is thrown over the hood toward the base of the windshield.
The air bags extend along the windshield base from the center line to
the A-pillars and are triggered by a sensor that detects when a
pedestrian is hit by the bumper.</TE>
<TE>   When inflated, the bags would cover the full width of the vehicle
along the windshield base, protecting a pedestrian from being injured
by hard windshield wiper spindles, hood mounts and the lower part of
the windshield glass.</TE>
<TE>   Ford also tested an over-the-hood air bag that deploys from just
above the bumper and is activated just before impact by a sensor. The
inflated airbag is about 54 inches wide, 22 inches high and 5 inches
thick and spans the area between the headlamps and extends from the
top of the bumper to several inches above the hood surface.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the research, there are no current plans to install these
air-bag systems in Ford vehicles in the U.S., Tatchio said. And
although pedestrian-friendly safety features will be implemented in
coming years, European consumers will see them first, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ford and other car makers also have been working on
pedestrian-sensing and warning technologies aimed at helping to
prevent vehicles from hitting pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   In December, General Motors petitioned the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration to require that all domestically
manufactured vehicles be equipped with daylight running lights
(DRLs).</TE>
<TE>   They are reduced-intensity lights on the front of vehicles that
automatically illuminate when the vehicle is started. They make the
vehicles easier to see by both other drivers and pedestrians, says GM
spokesman Jay Cooney.</TE>
<TE>   "They make a vehicle look closer than it actually is," he says.
"Pedestrians, consequently, have more time to react."</TE>
<TE>   GM started phasing-in DRLs in 1996 and now all of its vehicles
have them--they are, Cooney says, a "very cost-effective
crash-avoidance system." A study by NHTSA, released in 2000, found
that DRLs reduced fatal car-pedestrian crashes by 28%, Cooney says.</TE>
<TE>   GM also has begun using a night-vision system--so far available
only on Cadillacs--enhances the driver's ability to see in the dark.
With it, drivers get an early warning that a pedestrian is in the
road up ahead, Cooney says.</TE>
<TE>   There are many critical safety issues that face auto makers today.
But any technology that can protect pedestrians from serious injuries
and death will be welcomed--especially when you consider the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's finding that children under
16 are the pedestrians most likely to be struck by motor vehicles.</TE>

<DH>Pierre Cardin, whose innovative designs pepper the globe,
says he answers to no one and creates for everyone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With his name on everything from frying pans to rental tuxes and a
global empire that brings in a reported $1 billion in annual
revenues, Pierre Cardin may be the world's richest fashion designer.
He has also spent a half-century in French couture, dressing everyone
from France's first lady Bernadette Chirac to Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the style cognoscenti have relegated him to the role of
McFashion designer--too much mass, not enough class, with his 900
licenses in 140 countries. In the words of Rodney Dangerfield, he
don't get no respect.</LD>
<LD>   Not that it matters. At 79, the designer is beyond caring what
people think. "I don't have to answer to anybody," he said in broken
English during an interview last week in Beverly Hills in which he
selectively answered questions.</LD>
<TE>   Like Dangerfield, Cardin is headlining Las Vegas. Tonight, he'll
present a retrospective runway show at the Hard Rock Cafe &amp; Casino,
as part of the MAGIC apparel trade show. The haberdashery haven of
hip-hoppers and skate rats is hardly the place one would expect to
find a rumpled, white-haired couturier. But as usual, Cardin knows
what he is doing. He's reaching out to the young, vintage-obsessed
set. And it looks like his innovative 1950s coats and 1960s Space Age
styles are poised for a second moment.</TE>
<TE>   The interest started last year, when actress-fashion plate Lisa
Marie was photographed wearing a cream Cardin coat with oversized
black buttons she picked up at Decades on Melrose Avenue. This month,
his clothes were featured at the annual Valentine's Day luncheon of
the Colleagues, a Beverly Hills charity group whose members include
Nancy Reagan and Betsy Bloomingdale. And just last week, designer
Jeremy Scott sent futuristic, pointy-shouldered suits and sharp,
angular dresses down the runway in New York. His references to
Cardin's 1970s collections were unmistakable.</TE>
<TE>   "He left a legacy of amazing design and innovation," Scott said.
"He was constantly evolving, compared to [Andre] Courreges, who did
one thing and did it forever. Cardin had a huge vocabulary."</TE>
<TE>   To a certain degree, he has also been a victim of his own success.
"Cardin contributed in a major way to late 20th century design," said
Valerie Steele, chief curator for the museum at New York's Fashion
Institute of Technology. "But his licensing has overshadowed the
creative contribution." Cardin himself is fond of saying, "I managed
to turn a label into a name."</TE>
<TE>   His clothes didn't reflect social trends; they predicted them. In
the 1950s, he followed Cristobal Balenciaga in pushing the chemise.
He updated slender coats with dramatic cape-shaped, fluted or pleated
collars. In the early 1960s, Cardin created galactic gowns with hoop
skirts radiating out like satellites, and nylon "cosmonaut" suits for
men. By the 1970s, he had softened his silhouette, draping women in
tunic and pant ensembles.</TE>
<TE>   But his true genius was anticipating lifestyle marketing years
before Ralph, Calvin and Donna came along. Today, Cardin is known in
France more as a cultural icon than as a creative force in fashion
like newly retired Yves Saint Laurent. He designs furniture, supports
the arts by sponsoring productions at his theater in Paris and is a
peace ambassador for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a wine merchant, he was born Pietro Cardin near Venice,
Italy. During his childhood, he and his family moved around factory
towns in southern France after their hometown was decimated by war.
Cardin spent World War II apprenticed to tailors in Vichy and
Saint-Etienne before moving to Paris, where he began work as an
assistant to Christian Dior in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   It was Cardin who did the actual sewing on the famous 1947 New
Look collection, which would put women the world over in
cinched-waist jackets and trumpet skirts. Dior was the first fashion
designer to set up a licensing agreement, with a U.S. hosiery
company, so it's no surprise that Cardin took the concept to a new
level.</TE>
<TE>   He founded his own house in 1949 and spent his early years
designing costumes for Europe's grand postwar parties, including 30
for the famous 1951 ball given by Mexican millionaire Don Carlos de
Beistegui at his palazzo in Venice. The experience left Cardin with a
rich and loyal clientele of international socialites. He also
designed costumes for Jean Cocteau's 1946 French film, "La Belle et
la Bete."</TE>
<TE>   Despite auspicious creations such as the "bubble dress," with a
balloon-shaped skirt, Cardin's early collections were often
overshadowed by Dior, Balenciaga and newcomer Saint Laurent.</TE>
<TE>   "The press always had a hard time with him," said Pamela Golbin,
curator of Paris' Musee de la Mode et du Textile and author of
"Fashion Designers: Fifty Years of Fashion," (Watson and Guptill,
2002). His designs for couture ironically never quite fit with what
was going on at the time; and "all of his details were really wacky.
The sleeves, the colors, the buttons were all completely wacky," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1950s, Cardin and others were facing financial ruin
from a changed couture market. Few women could afford $10,000
dresses, and designs were routinely being copied, often by in-house
designers at American department stores. So Cardin launched a
ready-to-wear line in 1959, and later became the first couturier to
open a boutique inside a department store, Paris' Le Printemps.</TE>
<TE>   His creative breakthrough came in 1960, when he introduced his
first men's collection, modeled by Sorbonne students. Corduroy
lapel-less jackets as well as a French version of London's Edwardian
look--long coats and cigarette pants--were hailed as the "new look
for men," according to Richard Morais' "Pierre Cardin: The Man Who
Became A Label'' (Bantam, 1991).</TE>
<TE>   "He introduced the notion of comfort in men's attire," Golbin
said.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1960s, street fashion had taken hold. In Paris,
Courreges and Cardin took their inspiration from outer space, using
the new synthetic fibers to realize their vision.</TE>
<TE>   "The English had the youth subculture driven by rock 'n' roll
bands like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones," Steele said. "But the
French didn't have that. The Space Age look became a metaphor for
youth and the future in France. It was an optimistic message about
how you could transform yourself into a modern person by wearing
miniskirts, trousers with stretch and other clothes that let you
move."</TE>
<TE>   Cardin produced some of his most fanciful designs during this
period, using holograms, plastic and vinyl in explosive colors to
their full futuristic effect. A 1968 orange minidress is fitted with
plastic bubbles on the breasts that pop out like headlights. A series
of black stretch fabric gowns are held up by halters sculpted from
hammered metal. "At the time, it was almost vulgar," Cardin said.</TE>
<TE>   He also tinkered with cutouts--panels on coats and dresses that
lift to expose bare skin. "Air-conditioning," he joked.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1970s, Cardin was licensing himself across the globe. In
1979, he became the first Western designer to present a fashion show
in China, just blocks away from Mao Tse-tung's mausoleum.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a symbolic moment," Steele said. "Nowadays, the fashion
industry depends so much on Asia not only to produce clothes but also
as a major consumer market. It was far-sighted of Cardin to see that
back then."</TE>
<TE>   He continued to present couture collections through the 1980s and
'90s. But like Halston, the more he spread his name, the less he was
taken seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Cardin, who lives in a circular Palais Bulles (bubble palace) near
Cannes and 31 other houses across the globe, defends his choices
vigorously: "Why should I work only for the rich people? I want to
work for the people on the street," he said. Far from being rattled
by being relegated to the dark hole of mass merchandising, he is
proud of his career. "It is what I wanted," he said. "I want to die
the richest man in the world."</TE>

<HD>More Brits Find Monarchy Isn't Their Cup of Tea</HD>
<DH>Don't expect L.A.'s expatriates to get stirred up about the
queen's Jubilee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER WHITTLE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just before he was forced to abdicate the throne of Egypt in 1952,
King Farouk I said, "Soon there will be only five kings left in the
world--of England, Diamonds, Spades, Clubs and Hearts."</LD>
<LD>   He was partially right. Half a century later, there are still a
fair number of crowned heads dotting the world, but few have the
preeminence of the British monarchy--an institution that over the
years has inspired fascination, revulsion, respect, amusement,
slavish loyalty and unwavering hostility, and that for 50 years has
been represented in the figure of a small, staid, rather
middle-class-looking woman, Queen Elizabeth II.</LD>
<LD>   This year marks her Golden Jubilee. Although the date of her
accession to the throne fell earlier this month, the celebrations, as
is the tradition in Britain's unreliable climate, are planned for the
summer, despite the recent death of her sister, Princess Margaret.
These include a ceremonial procession through the streets of London,
the usual flow of commemorative memorabilia, and the lighting of
nationwide bonfires. Also, in Prime Minister Tony Blair's new
populist "people's Britain," a massive open-air pop concert is
planned for one of the royal parks.</LD>
<TE>   Among the people, however, the mood in Britain has been one of
indifference, prompting one of the country's main tabloid papers to
launch a "Save the Jubilee" campaign. The hoped-for organization of
street parties--a peculiarly British form of celebrating, whereby
residential streets are closed for a communal party festooned with
flags and balloons--shows little sign of materializing.</TE>
<TE>   But what about British expats? There are something like 450,000 of
us living in Southern California, the largest such concentration in
the world. Aren't we meant to become ever more British, the longer
we're away? Will we be toasting the queen, a figure who is meant to
act as a focus for our patriotism, a kind of president and Stars and
Stripes rolled into one?</TE>
<TE>   Official bodies in Los Angeles are planning to do their bit. For
the black tie and medals types, the British consulate with the
British American Business Council and a number of other British
organizations are holding a Grand Queen's Ball on June 15 at the
Regent Beverly Wilshire in Beverly Hills. The Los Angeles branch of
the British Academy of Film &amp; Television Arts will mark the event in
May and June by screening a British film from each decade of the
queen's reign. The thousand or so members will vote on exactly which
films will be shown.</TE>
<TE>   Less official, but just as traditional perhaps, the best-known
British pub in L.A., the King's Head in Santa Monica, will hold a
special all-comers welcome party in June to celebrate the event,
rather like it did 11/2 years ago for the queen mother's 100th
birthday.</TE>
<TE>   King's Head manager Nicola Coleman, a royalist who's been here 10
years, keeps in touch with what's happening in the home country and
follows the activities of the royal family. "The Americans have
celebrities; we have the royals." She expects that the King's Head
party will prove a big success. "Our regular expat customers are, I
would say, very patriotic." Next door to the pub, the gift shop is
already selling the traditional mugs, tea towels and trinkets
emblazoned with the queen's image. "We find they sell very well to
both British and American customers," says manager Ruth Elwell.</TE>
<TE>   Such enthusiasm, however, is far from universal among the British
here. During the three years I've been in L.A. I've found a certain
nostalgic attachment for the monarchy has reasserted itself, but the
reactions among my British friends and colleagues are varied, though
primarily negative.</TE>
<TE>   In some part, the British are more reticent than Americans when it
comes to expressing national pride. Even so, for many, the royals
seem to play no part in any sense of nationality, and the thought of
celebrating the queen's milestone has barely occurred to them.</TE>
<TE>   "In the U.K., I just accepted them as part of life," says Frances
Anderton, a radio producer who's been in L.A. for a decade. "But now,
I've come to see the royal family as a complete anachronism. I can
understand the argument that it maybe creates a certain stability in
society, but I find that since being in America, it's increasingly
hard for me to take a royal family whose position is based solely on
accident of birth. Its presence sustains the class system."</TE>
<TE>   Anderton retains "a devotion of sorts" to her homeland, but, she
says, "it's nothing to do with the existence of the royal family. I
see the queen as representing the U.K. as Big Historical Theme Park."</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not Elizabeth II is simply the head of a heritage
industry, her face is recognizable all over the world. The
institution she represents fascinates many Americans who otherwise
consider themselves fiercely democratic, and countless thousands of
U.S. tourists have stood outside Buckingham Palace, gazing through
the railings, hoping for a sighting.</TE>
<TE>   Yet she has no political power and has made no public
pronouncements of any consequence. And, as a person, she is virtually
unknown, a mystery even to the British. But her symbolic importance
is potent. Her decision to fly the American flag outside the palace
after Sept. 11 struck just as much of a chord among Americans as did
Blair's endless globe-trotting on behalf of President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   But finding a place in the hearts of Americans won't keep her in
the hearts of her subjects. "She is at the pinnacle of a class
system, which I'm glad I've escaped," says journalist Mike Goodridge,
who came to California four years ago. In L.A., he finds that the
royals have disappeared from his life. "I even find it jarring to see
headlines about them here, such as Prince Harry in trouble over
drinks and drugs or whatever. It's intrusive, and I'm happy to be
away from all that."</TE>
<TE>   The last such royal celebration--excluding weddings--was the
Silver Jubilee marking the 25th year of Elizabeth II's reign in 1977.
Taking place during a time of recession and social upheaval in
England, the occasion nevertheless saw an enormous and unexpected
outpouring of royalist enthusiasm. But Britain has changed profoundly
since then. In today's harsh tabloid world, every move of the royals
makes headlines, stripping away the reverence surrounding the
monarchy.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, there has been a decline in Britain's confidence
in its traditional view of itself. There is no longer a widespread
value put on the characteristics for which Britain was known--the
stiff upper lip, the tightly controlled emotions--characteristics
with which Elizabeth II is still identified. This was never better
illustrated than at the time of Princess Diana's death, when the
queen, for the first time in her reign, was ridiculed for her
supposed lack of the correct emotional response. British actress and
producer Barbara Steele, who has lived in L.A. for more than 20
years, says for the royals to have meaning, they should retain a
theatrical, iconic quality. "The monarchy's been demystified," she
says. "The monarch should somehow be a larger-than-life figure that
transcends the institution."</TE>
<TE>   This is difficult in contemporary Britain, where the brilliant,
almost seductive ceremony traditionally associated with royalty seems
increasingly peripheral. "She [Queen Elizabeth] has the most
appalling job, a life sentence of officialdom, endlessly cutting
ribbons in the rain," Steele says. "The fact that she hasn't cracked
is phenomenal."</TE>
<TE>   It's hard for younger people who've grown up during the almost
ceaseless and largely critical media coverage of the monarchy during
the past decade to appreciate that older generations may feel a
personal connection, even sympathy, for the queen.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a great respect for this woman," says Vanessa Mitchell,
who's lived between London and L.A. for the past 40 years and will
certainly be raising a glass of champagne to celebrate the Jubilee.
"She behaves in a way that gives other people an example, though
unfortunately her children haven't."</TE>
<TE>   The queen, she thinks, has suffered from a "boring public image,
which is really not her fault. One doesn't warm to her, as a persona.
She doesn't appear interesting, and, physically, she's an awkward
woman. But I have a great deal of respect for her, for what she's
been through. I'd fight tooth and nail for the monarchy to survive.
It's all we've got."</TE>
<TE>   This sentiment is echoed in the conservative press in Britain, as
the country continues to argue with itself about further assimilation
into a greater Europe. Even as the first Queen Elizabeth reigned over
a period of great expansion, with England emerging as a superpower,
the second has presided over economic decline and the gradual
devolution of a once-united kingdom, all of which adds to a growing
sense of loss of identity.</TE>
<TE>   To many, the queen increasingly resembles an elaborate figure atop
a decaying wedding cake. But even those Brits, thousands of miles
away in L.A., who feel little sense of allegiance toward the
monarchy, would not necessarily campaign for its abolition.</TE>
<TE>   Tina Jenkins, a screenwriter who has lived here for 41/2 years,
typifies a more middle-of-the-road attitude toward the royals. "I
wouldn't do anything proactively to celebrate the Jubilee," she says.
"Their mystery is gone, and they have too much wealth. They are
unimpressive. But they have a value to the state. Living here in
L.A., I see their purpose more clearly. They act as a target for
criticism without there being any important ramifications."</TE>
<TE>   More than such lukewarm support is needed for the monarchy to
flourish. It's possible support might build in Britain nearer to
June, and expat Brits might find that a residual sentimentality gets
the better of them, spurring spontaneous Jubilee house parties. But
if the whole affair is truly lackluster, then it could be that
Elizabeth II will go down in history with an unexpected importance:
as the Last British Monarch.</TE>

<DH>A Pasadena middle school is the first in L.A. County to be
certified by rigorous International Baccalaureate program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Room 213 at Pasadena's Wilson Middle School, Patti Schindler's
seventh-graders are discussing the trans-Saharan trade during the
14th century. How did North African merchants, Schindler asks her
students, change the societies of West Africa?</LD>
<LD>   A high-level discussion of Islam and economics ensues. Although
the subject of the lesson is prescribed by the state's content
standards, Schindler actually pays closer attention to a set of
guidelines posted on the wall. They are issued not by the California
Department of Education or the Pasadena Unified School District, but
by a Swiss educational foundation best known for granting special
diplomas to the college-bound.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday, Wilson became the first middle school in Los Angeles
County to receive full authorization from the International
Baccalaureate Organization. The rigorous--and prestigious--program,
founded to provide standardized instruction to the children of
diplomats, emphasizes cultural exchange and international
perspectives.</LD>
<TE>   Its arrival at Wilson represents a departure both for the school
and International Baccalaureate. The authorization gives an
overcrowded urban school with test scores below the state average a
high gloss. Even before Tuesday's approval, word of the school's
association with International Baccalaureate was drawing students to
Wilson who might otherwise attend private schools.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, schools such as Wilson have slowly been embraced
by International Baccalaureate. The nonprofit educational foundation
is known for its demanding two-year honors program for high school
students. But over the last decade, International Baccalaureate has
quietly adopted a "Middle Years" version of its program for sixth-
through 10th-graders. So far, 25 U.S. middle schools--in partnership
with high schools--have received International Baccalaureate
authorization, including five in California.</TE>
<TE>   Such programs have proved attractive to districts such as
Pasadena. There, the public schools, under a new superintendent, are
seeking to develop distinguishing programs to keep promising students
from leaving for nearby private institutions. And though some critics
argue that the group's Middle Years Program lacks the focus and rigor
of its high school diploma curriculum, the public relations value of
the International Baccalaureate name is undeniable.</TE>
<TE>   At Wilson, the student population has risen by nearly a quarter
since International Baccalaureate methods were first introduced three
years ago. Interest in attending the school is so high that Principal
Meg Abrahamson conducts a weekly campus tour for parents and
prospective students. Last fall, Wilson had to turn away students
from other neighborhoods whose parents had sought permits to get
their children into the school.</TE>
<TE>   "It has clearly changed the image of the school," says Abrahamson,
who is in her first year as principal. "A lot of people want to come
to Wilson now, and because they've heard of International
Baccalaureate, that's the primary focus of their interest."</TE>
<TE>   In Pasadena, a handful of parents with children approaching
middle-school age first discovered the Middle Years Program on the
Internet four years ago. Intrigued, they talked with district
officials and shopped the idea to middle schools. At Wilson, Rich
Boccia, who was then principal, expressed interest.</TE>
<TE>   The Middle Years Program has the same emphasis on international
perspectives and cultural exchange as its better-known diploma
counterpart. But it is less a curriculum than a set of themes and
guidelines. Students work in teams. They must study eight academic
fields--English, Spanish, humanities, mathematics, sciences, art,
physical education and technology--with an emphasis on developing
themselves in five areas. Those are study skills, community service,
social education, the environment and "homo faber": literally "man
the toolmaker," or how the creativity of people shapes society.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a more global perspective, where you try to show
relationships between different fields," says Marilee France, a
Wilson teacher who coordinates the program.</TE>
<TE>   Some educators have derided the International Baccalaureate
guidelines as vague. But at Wilson, parents and administrators saw
the program's requirements as a tool to enforce improvement in
teaching and curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   To meet guidelines in academic areas, for example, foreign
language instruction had to be boosted. International Baccalaureate
guidelines on equipment and instruction also have prompted an
upgrading of the school library and extensive new training for
teachers. And the program's insistence that each student complete an
extensive personal project has raised expectations for students.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a vehicle for change," says school board member Peter
Soelter, the father of a Wilson eighth-grader.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson launched the program in the fall of 1999 with its
sixth-grade class. Each year since, Wilson has extended the program
forward an additional grade--eighth is new this year. Next fall,
Blair High School, as Wilson's partner in the program, will bring its
ninth-graders under International Baccalaureate.</TE>
<TE>   School officials call the schools' certification cause for
celebration, though some Pasadena parents are not so sure.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had the opportunity to go from extremely hot to slightly
more cool," says Rene Amy, a general contractor and local education
gadfly, who was an early backer of International Baccalaureate. In
the state's latest Academic Performing Index rankings, Wilson rated
below overall averages for the state, but between the 70th and 80th
percentile for schools of similar demographics. "For standards
stalwarts, it's definitely a little bit fuzzy ... but it's certainly
a popular program that has attracted people."</TE>
<TE>   At the least, Wilson seems to have succeeded in creating an
attraction that slows the number of defections to private and
parochial campuses. In the fall of 1999, more than 100 students from
outside the school's neighborhood borders transferred in. In the fall
of 2000, 80 more did. Last fall, with more neighborhood children
choosing to attend Wilson and enrollment growing, new transfers were
not allowed. The school now has 1,500 students--making it the
second-largest in the Pasadena system.</TE>
<TE>   Abrahamson is frustrated by the crowding that comes with success.
On a recent tour she conducted for prospective parents, the Wilson
principal led a conversation that shifted between the luster of
International Baccalaureate and the difficulties inherent in a large
urban school. In particular, she fielded several inquiries about
growing class sizes, which reach the high 30s in the sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Suzanne Lawrence, a small business consultant who was on the tour,
is considering whether to take her seventh-grade son out of private
school and put him in Wilson next year.</TE>
<TE>   "[International Baccalaureate] is a major draw, and I believe the
school has picked up a notch," says Lawrence. "But at the same time,
not everything is better as a result of it."</TE>
<TE>   On the tours, conducted Wednesday mornings, Abrahamson often drops
by Schindler's classroom. Schindler's seventh-graders study world
history, as the state requires. But the class is clearly influenced
by International Baccalaureate.</TE>
<TE>   Students sit in groups of four and complete written work together.
Schindler grades on a 1-10 numerical scale suggested by the program.
She shares students with an English teacher across the hall, so the
subject matter and reading in history and English are related.</TE>
<TE>   Halfway through the lesson, she talks about the homework
assignment. The students must write out a travel guide for those
crossing the Sahara in the 14th century.</TE>
<TE>   "The format and specifics are up to you," she says. "It doesn't
matter how--it just matters that you get there."</TE>

<HD>This Measure Is One for the Roads</HD>
<DH>Election: Prop. 42 would funnel all state gasoline sales
taxes to transit. Parks, voting bonds also on ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The state's gasoline sales tax would be permanently dedicated to
fixing roads and addressing other transportation needs under a
proposal on next month's ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, which has put school, health-care and certain labor
advocates on edge, would shift an estimated $1.4 billion to
transportation projects starting in July 2008. The money would
normally go into the state's general fund and pay for a variety of
services ranging from prisons to social programs to education, with
only a small portion going to transportation.</LD>
<LD>   It's one of six measures on the March 5 ballot. Only a proposal to
weaken legislative term limits, Proposition 45, has attracted more
interest this year.</LD>
<TE>   Voters also will decide whether they want to dig into their
pockets to the tune of $2.6 billion for a parks bond issue and $200
million for new voting equipment. The voter bond is a response to the
Florida debacle in the last presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   Another measure stemming from the 2000 election would amend the
state Constitution to say that all legally cast votes shall be
counted.</TE>
<TE>   The final ballot item would make rules and penalties for
chiropractors the same as those for doctors.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals will compete for voters' attention along with the
contest among Republican gubernatorial candidates hoping to face Gov.
Gray Davis in November, and with a long list of statewide,
congressional, legislative and local primary races.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed the "Transportation Congestion Improvement Act,"
Proposition 42 would earmark the state's 6% sales tax on gasoline to
transportation projects.</TE>
<TE>   Backers, who include the engineering firms, contractors and
construction and equipment companies that build roads and transit
systems, have poured more than $3million into the campaign. The
measure also is supported by the California Chamber of Commerce, a
variety of tax watchdog groups and Davis.</TE>
<TE>   They contend that the proposition would relieve congested streets
and thus improve public safety without raising taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Most drivers believe that gas sales tax revenue gets funneled to
transportation projects, as money from the state's
18-cents-per-gallon excise tax does, backers add. Proposition 42
would simply make it official, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "The need is great in California," said Al Lundeen, a spokesman
for the Yes on 42 campaign. "We have what are considered to be the
worst roads in the nation, and we spend the least per person to fix
them."</TE>
<TE>   At a recent legislative hearing, Bill Hauck, president of the
California Business Roundtable, pegged the state's transportation
backlog at $100 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, including the California Teachers Assn., the Service
Employees International Union and the California State Firefighters'
Assn., say the measure would bolster transportation funding at the
expense of education, health care and local governments. They have
yet to launch a formal campaign, however.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Sedivec, president of the firefighters association, took
issue with supporters' contention that fixing roads would improve
public safety by allowing emergency workers to respond faster.</TE>
<TE>   "Respond with what?" he asked. "We can have beautiful roadways,
but if you allocate that much money to transit, you could take away
money from local governments to pay for fire equipment."</TE>
<TE>   "By making transportation sacrosanct it could essentially cause
cuts to other services," said Anthony Wright of Health Access
California, a coalition of more than 200 consumer, community and
labor groups.</TE>
<TE>   Under current law, gas sales taxes collected from July 2003 to
June 2008 are earmarked for a specific plan to relieve urban
congestion. But at the end of that period, the revenue would revert
to the general fund. Proposition 42 would permanently dedicate those
taxes to transportation projects, beginning in July 2008.</TE>
<TE>   The funds would be divvied up with 20% for public transit, 40%
split between cities and counties to fix potholes and make other
local road improvements and 40% for projects funded in the State
Transportation Improvement Program, California's long-term
construction blueprint. The Legislature could suspend or modify the
funding plan with a two-thirds vote.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the transportation measure, the Legislature placed
two bond measures on the March 5 ballot. Proposition 40 would provide
$2.6 billion to purchase property for and improve state and local
parks, conserve land, air and water and preserve historical and
cultural resources.</TE>
<TE>   Voters have approved about $7.6billion in bonds for similar
purposes since 1980, and of that amount about $1.2 billion is left,
according to the state's legislative analyst.</TE>
<TE>   The $2.6 billion in bonds would be paid back over 25 years,
costing the state $4.3 billion, including interest, the analyst's
office said. State and local officials would face additional expenses
to maintain parks purchased with the bond money.</TE>
<TE>   So far proponents have raised nearly $3 million for their
campaign, which is backed by a variety of environmental groups and
the Congress of California Seniors, among others.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe Californians do want to see land protected as an
important resource," said Trudy Schafer, program director for the
League of Women Voters of California, another supporter.</TE>
<TE>   Fiscal watchdogs say the proposal would result in billions of
taxpayer dollars wasted on a new round of pork projects at a time
when the state can't afford to take on new debt.</TE>
<TE>   "I am irked to death by the incessant bonds referred to as clean
air and clean water and all the rest being put on the ballot by these
self-anointed environmental organizations," said Lew Uhler, president
of the conservative National Tax Limitation Committee. "This is how
these organizations fund themselves ... in the name of doing good for
nature."</TE>
<TE>   Measure Would Help Buy Voting Equipment</TE>
<TE>   Uhler also opposes Proposition 41, which would raise $200 million
through bond sales to help California counties purchase new voting
equipment. Counties would be required to put up $1 for every $3 they
receive in bond money.</TE>
<TE>   By one estimate, the state could pay $55 million in interest to
pay off the $200-million bonds, and counties could expect to spend
$66million more in matching funds and tens of millions of dollars
more in operating costs.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents say the measure is a crucial step toward helping
cash-strapped counties replace punch-card voting systems with faster,
more accurate technology. Backers include the League of Women Voters
of California, Secretary of State Bill Jones and Assemblyman Kevin
Shelley, the San Francisco Democrat vying to replace Jones, who is
being forced out of office by term limits and is a Republican
candidate for governor.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley described Proposition 41 as crucial in light of a federal
judge's ruling last week that California has to replace its
punch-card voting machines by the 2004 presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   "What was important before is essential today," Shelley said.
"Nine counties comprising 72% of the electorate in the state of
California use punch cards, including Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   If the need is so pressing, asks Uhler, then why didn't state
officials use billions of dollars in surplus money that materialized
over the last few years to purchase the equipment?</TE>
<TE>   "This is spending bond money for depreciable equipment," he said.
"I think it's bad business.'</TE>
<TE>   Florida's "hanging chad" mess also has given rise to Proposition
43, which would amend the state Constitution to say that all votes
legally cast in an election shall be counted. The measure also would
allow county elections officials to petition the courts for an
extension of any deadlines so votes may be tallied or recounted.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 43 is backed by California Common Cause and
Assemblyman John Longville, the Rialto Democrat who chairs the
Assembly Committee on Elections, Reapportionment and Constitutional
Amendments.</TE>
<TE>   Longville said the measure would prevent a repeat of the showdown
in Florida, where the need to meet a postelection deadline for
certifying the state's vote was given greater priority than counting
ballots.</TE>
<TE>   "The sole purpose of this amendment is to make explicit in the
future that even if it takes longer than some deadline, we want to
finish counting ballots," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Gary B. Wesley said the measure would invite needless
postelection litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We think Prop. 43 will do more harm than good because it will
require that all votes be counted even if the ballots cannot be
located and even if the missing ballots could not mathematically make
any difference in the outcome of an election," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, voters will decide whether the state's 15,000 licensed
chiropractors should be subject to the same penalties as doctors,
including the possibility of having their licenses revoked for 10
years for second or multiple offenses.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of Proposition 44, including state Sen. Jackie Speier
(D-Hillsborough) and the California District Attorneys Assn., say the
measure would help prevent insurance fraud. Opponents from the
insurance industry and the Libertarian Party say chiropractors who
commit insurance fraud should have to pay restitution but not have
their licenses revoked.</TE>

<HD>Millions Extra Go to Power Buyers</HD>
<DH>Finances: They earn consultant fees as red tape bars them
from state employment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Contract workers who are trading electricity for California have
earned millions of extra dollars because of a bureaucratic delay that
keeps them off the state payroll.</LD>
<LD>   The Legislature confirmed this month that the state Department of
Water Resources, which has been purchasing electricity for 27 million
utility customers since January 2001, must spend $3.4 million more
than expected because about 40 workers have not been classified as
state employees.</LD>
<LD>   "What it comes down to is paying somebody $30 an hour or paying a
consultant a minimum of $105 an hour," said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman
for the state Department of Water Resources.</LD>
<TE>   The additional cost will be borne by customers of the state's
largest private utilities, not California's over-tapped general fund.</TE>
<TE>   Last June the Water Resources sought authorization from another
state agency, the Department of Personnel Administration, to create a
new class of state worker called a "utility systems operator." The
personnel department rejected the proposal, saying that the job
description was too broad.</TE>
<TE>   Water Resources has been working since then to break down the job
into several categories that will satisfy the personnel department.
Meanwhile, about 40 department workers who trade electricity,
schedule its flow, finalize power deals and coordinate with
transmission grid operators have been employed as private
contractors.</TE>
<TE>   They get paid, according to a Feb. 1 report by the legislative
analyst's office, "salaries that are on average 60% above those in
comparable positions at municipal utilities around the state."</TE>
<TE>   Department officials said they based the contractors' pay on a
survey of private utilities and energy companies. Many of the
contractors have said that they would like to become state employees,
even at a lower pay rate, Hidalgo said. But without a new job
classification, that is not possible.</TE>
<TE>   He said the legislation that thrust the department into the
emergency task of buying electricity last winter specified that the
Personnel Administration should help Water Resources expedite the
hiring of staff.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not experts on classification," Hidalgo said. "It would
have helped all of us if we'd gotten more support and guidance and
expertise in this area."</TE>
<TE>   Michael T. Navarro, chief of the Personnel Administration's
classification and compensation division, said Water Resources is "on
its own to the degree that they're defining the jobs."</TE>
<TE>   "But if at any time they want to sit down with us," he said,
"we're there."</TE>
<TE>   A simple request for a new job classification--there are
officially more than 4,500 types of jobs in state
government--typically can be processed within three months, Navarro
said.</TE>
<TE>   "In all fairness to the DWR," he said, "this is kind of a new
function for state government. You're looking at energy traders,
you're looking at technicians, you're looking at engineers. These are
not easy packages to put together."</TE>
<TE>   The additional money to pay power-buying contractors is among $40
million in operational costs Water Resources officials hadn't
expected when they projected last February how much money they would
need. The department's costs are paid with money collected from the
monthly bills of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Southern California Edison
and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric customers.</TE>
<TE>   The department began buying billions of dollars worth of
electricity for those customers after a haywire electricity market,
set up under a 1996 deregulation scheme, stripped the utilities of
cash and ruined their good credit.</TE>
<TE>   The department blames its higher-than-expected costs on lawsuits,
extensive audits, a long delay in the sale of bonds to cover power
costs, and the sheer complexity of becoming overnight the largest
buyer of electricity in the West.</TE>
<TE>   Those factors have forced the department to rely much more heavily
on private consultants and attorneys than anticipated, according to
the agency's report to the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Among the consultants with expanded roles is the accounting firm
Deloitte &amp; Touche.</TE>
<TE>   The department expects to pay the company $8.6 million--more than
twice the original estimate--for analyzing risk, advising on computer
software and providing 14 consultants to finalize power purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Navigant Consulting Inc. is expected to earn $13 million by next
summer--not the $367,000 estimated in February 2001--for helping to
negotiate power contracts and prepare financial documents.</TE>
<TE>   Computer software to manage the department's long-term contracts
has cost $10 million, much more than the $2 million expected.</TE>
<TE>   And Hawkins, Delafield and Wood, a New York law firm hired to help
the state sell bonds to cover past and future power costs, has been
paid $7.4 million, a cost the department had not anticipated a year
ago.</TE>
<TE>   California officials had expected to borrow as much as $13.4
billion by last June to cover past and future electricity costs, but
the bonds have yet to be sold.</TE>

<HD>Idec the Winner in Drug Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Idec Pharmaceuticals Corp. emerged as the winner in a race to develop
the first radioactive drug, as the government Tuesday approved its
treatment for advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</LD>
<LD>   The drug, called Zevalin, is Idec's second product and expands its
franchise in treatments for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the fifth most
common type of cancer. Sales of Rituxan, which Idec markets in the
United States with Genentech Inc., are expected to near $1 billion
this year.</LD>
<LD>   Idec moved decisively ahead of rival Corixa Corp. last fall when a
Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended Zevalin's
approval. The FDA typically follows its experts' advice.</LD>
<TE>   Corixa's Bexxar, meanwhile, has not been scheduled for an advisory
panel review.</TE>
<TE>   Zevalin and Corixa's experimental non-Hodgkin's lymphoma drug,
Bexxar, target tumor cells and bathe them in radioactivity. The
competing drugs use different radioactive materials.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect sales of Zevalin to reach $45 million this year.
Idec said the drug is aimed at the sickest 25% of patients who don't
respond to existing medications, or about 75,000 patients annually.</TE>
<TE>   Idec, based in San Diego, didn't announce a price for the drug.
Chief Executive William H. Rastetter said its price would be
"modestly higher" than Rituxan, which costs about $15,000 annually.
Because the drug is radioactive, it must be administered at
facilities with nuclear medicine units. But Idec does not expect that
to limit use.</TE>
<TE>   Rastetter said Zevalin, as the first drug to market, would have a
sustainable advantage over Bexxar, though a representative of Corixa
disputed that.</TE>
<TE>   Corixa and its marketing partner, GlaxoSmithKline, have accused
Idec of infringing their patents. Idec is seeking a court ruling that
Zevalin does not use others' patents.</TE>
<TE>   Idec shares, down $2.98 to $56.01 in regular Nasdaq trading, rose
to $59.72 after-hours, following the news.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Settles 7 Rampart Cases for $2.8 Million</HD>
<DH>LAPD: The City Council agrees to payouts, raising
police-framing scandal's cost to about $35 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council agreed Tuesday to pay $2.8 million to
settle lawsuits filed by seven victims of the Rampart police
corruption scandal, including two who were allegedly framed by
Officer Rafael Perez, who admitted to misconduct.</LD>
<LD>   Council members said it is hard to pay out such large sums when
the city faces a potential $200-million budget deficit, but they said
the cases demanded payment and attorneys for the city were able to
negotiate reductions with the victims.</LD>
<LD>   "These are the most difficult cases to deal with because they
involve police abuse," Councilman Nick Pacheco said. "These cases are
very painful in terms of the fact that people had their civil rights
violated."</LD>
<TE>   Settlements approved by the council included $475,000 to William
Zepeda, who pleaded guilty in 1998 to selling cocaine and was
sentenced to two years in prison. The conviction was dismissed after
Perez came forward with information.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar Ochoa, who was allegedly framed by Perez and another
officer, will receive $475,000 as well. He pleaded guilty to cocaine
possession and was sentenced to three years in prison. His conviction
was later dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel Bailey, whom Perez admitted framing for the crime of being
an ex-felon with a gun, received $475,000. Bailey's trial was
disrupted when the defendant yelled that Perez was a liar. He later
pleaded guilty in return for a lighter sentence of two years, eight
months in prison. The conviction was later overturned.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the payments went to four others whose convictions
were also overturned.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski said the city has so far paid
out about $35 million to resolve about 75 cases stemming from the
Rampart scandal. "It's always hard to approve settlement payments,
but given the evidence and the facts of these cases, we had little
choice," Miscikowski said.</TE>

<HD>J. D. Clark, 85; Archeologist Was Expert on Early Africa</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>J. Desmond Clark, a UC Berkeley archeologist and anthropologist who
wrote the book and became a living textbook on the prehistory of
Africa, has died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Clark died Feb. 14 of pneumonia at an Oakland care facility.</LD>
<LD>   With his Berkeley colleague, paleontologist Tim White, Clark led
expeditions to Ethiopia's Middle Awash River Valley and other African
excavation sites for more than 20 years.</LD>
<TE>   In 1981, the team discovered skull and femur fragments of a
4-foot-tall, two-legged hominid 4 million years old. They determined
that it proved that bipedalism and brain size evolved independently
of each other--counter to the prevailing view at the time that big
brains developed first and that walking on two legs followed.</TE>
<TE>   Another of their major finds was the 1996 discovery of the world's
earliest large mammal butchery, again in Ethiopia.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, credited as one of the first archeologists to involve
Africans in studying their own territory by teaching them modern
excavation and research methods, also helped reopen Chinese
archeological digs to foreigners. In 1991, he obtained permission to
dig for fossils in the Nihewan Basin near Beijing--the first permit
granted to a foreigner in 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   The best-known of Clark's more than 18 books is "Prehistory of
Africa," published in 1970. A close second is his 1967 compilation,
"Atlas of African Prehistory."</TE>
<TE>   But beyond his books and 300 scholarly papers, Clark became a
walking resource on how our ancestors lived 4 million to 6 million
years ago. While White and other colleagues concentrated on hominids,
Clark dug for stone tools and other evidence of how life was
maintained.</TE>
<TE>   "His lifelong quest," White said, "was to elucidate the very
beginnings of human culture and technology and its development
through time in Africa. He was not only an expert in the oldest stone
tools, but he knew the Iron Age and the late Stone Age and which
colleague was digging at what cave, and where it was and how old it
was.</TE>
<TE>   "The knowledge and understanding this one man had of African
archeology," he said, "will never be surpassed."</TE>
<TE>   John Desmond Clark was born in London on April 10, 1916, grew up
in the English countryside and earned bachelor's, master's and
doctoral degrees in archeology from Cambridge University. With few
jobs available at home, he left England in 1938 with his new bride,
Betty Cable Baume, to accept a position in Northern Rhodesia, which
is now Zambia.</TE>
<TE>   That job, as secretary of the newly formed Rhodes-Livingstone
Institute and curator of the David Livingstone Memorial Museum,
lasted until he moved to Berkeley in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   When Clark served with an ambulance team in Somaliland and
Ethiopia during World War II, his wife, who would later organize his
camps and sketch his discoveries, ran the museum in his absence.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, who taught at Berkeley from 1961 to 1986 and headed its
department of anthropology for many years, continued his research and
writing until his death.</TE>
<TE>   Last year he published his third paper on the prehistoric site of
Kalambo Falls in Zambia.</TE>
<TE>   During his decades with the Livingstone Museum and at Berkeley,
Clark explored sites throughout Africa, including on the Congo Basin,
the Central African Rift Valley, the Sahara, the Nile Valley, Angola,
Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa.</TE>
<TE>   He also led expeditions to India as well as to China, always in
search of evidence of early humans' lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1993, is survived
by his wife of 63 years; a daughter, Elizabeth Winterbottom of
Australia; a son, John Clark of England; a sister, Moira Coulson of
England; and five grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Judge Jerold Krieger, 58; Activist Helped Open Gay-Lesbian
Temple</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerold A. Krieger, a Los Angeles Municipal and Superior Court judge
who championed civil rights for gays, minorities and the
disadvantaged and helped found what is believed to be the world's
first gay-lesbian synagogue, died of cancer Thursday in Los Angeles.
He was 58.</LD>
<LD>   Krieger was the fifth gay lawyer named to the bench by Gov. Jerry
Brown. The appointment came on Brown's last day in office, Dec. 31,
1982. The earlier appointments, beginning with that of Stephen Lachs,
had provoked a furor of public debate.</LD>
<LD>   "The importance of my appointment was in the fact that it did not
make headlines," Krieger told the Daily Journal, a Los Angeles-based
legal newspaper.</LD>
<TE>   During Krieger's nearly two decades on the bench, lawyers
consistently gave him high marks for his legal knowledge, evenhanded
decisions and ability to keep jurors involved and interested, even
through long arcane trials.</TE>
<TE>   He served on the Los Angeles Municipal Court bench from 1983 to
1988, when he successfully ran for an open Los Angeles Superior Court
seat.</TE>
<TE>   In the lower court, he became presiding judge of the Encino
branch, and as a Superior Court judge he heard criminal and civil
cases downtown and in the Norwalk, San Fernando and Van Nuys
branches.</TE>
<TE>   Among his most memorable cases, Krieger said, was "the first time
I imposed the death sentence." By contrast, he quipped, "civil trials
are easy. Heck, it's only about money."</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, he sat, by special temporary appointment, on the 2nd
District Court of Appeal and, before cancer struck a year ago,
expressed an ambition to join the state appellate court permanently.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Krieger had served on the state Judicial
Council's Advisory Committee on Access and Fairness, heading its
sexual orientation committee. The council examines and works to
improve treatment by state courts of women, minorities, gays and
lesbians, senior citizens and the disabled.</TE>
<TE>   The son of an ophthalmologist, Krieger was born and grew up in Los
Angeles. He earned a bachelor's degree in political science at UC
Riverside and a law degree at UCLA. He served as a deputy state
attorney general for eight years, and in 1974 was elected president
of the Assn. of Deputy Attorneys General.</TE>
<TE>   From 1977 until he took the bench, Krieger was in private practice
handling civil cases.</TE>
<TE>   He also was building a reputation as a civil rights activist and
political strategist for Democratic candidates. He helped found Los
Angeles Lawyers for Human Rights in 1979 and later became its
president.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, Krieger was the campaign chairman and treasurer for Mike
Roos' successful run for the state Assembly. Roos, who went on to
become Assembly majority leader, recommended Krieger as a judicial
appointee.</TE>
<TE>   Krieger joined a handful of other gay and lesbian Jews in 1972 to
found Temple Beth Chayim Chadashim--the House of New Life--on Los
Angeles' Westside as a predominantly homosexual synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   Partly through his efforts, the temple won acceptance a year later
by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the official body of
Reform Judaism. Similar temples began to spring up in San Francisco,
Miami and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "In the gay community, you don't feel you can be Jewish, and in
the Jewish community, you don't feel you can be gay," Krieger told
The Times in 1983, explaining why he had worked so hard to establish
the progressive temple. "I'm still a Jew, and I'm also gay. The
temple brings it together."</TE>
<TE>   Krieger is survived by his life partner, Jon Smith; his father, M.
Morton Krieger; a brother, Michael; and a sister, Renee Garrick.</TE>

<HD>Loonis McGlohon, 80; Wrote Hundreds of Songs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Loonis McGlohon, a songwriter and pianist probably best known as the
coauthor of two popular songs recorded by Frank Sinatra--"A Long
Night" and "South to a Warmer Place"--has died. He was 80.</LD>
<LD>   McGlohon died Jan. 26 at his home in Charlotte, N.C., after a
nine-year battle with lymphoma.</LD>
<LD>   The writer of hundreds of jazz and popular songs, including the
cantata "A Child's Christmas," McGlohon also wrote the theme for his
friend Charles Kuralt's "On the Road" segment on television's "CBS
Evening News."</LD>
<TE>   Born in Ayden, N.C., McGlohon was the son of an auto mechanic and
a schoolteacher. As a boy, he was enthralled by the big-band music of
Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman and Woody Herman. He learned to play piano
from the organist at his family's church.</TE>
<TE>   He graduated from East Carolina University but dropped the only
music course he took because he was making low marks. He did,
however, improve his piano playing and embarked on a professional
career, working a variety of local jobs. World War II put his career
on hold when he served several years with the Army Air Forces.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he played briefly with the Jimmy Dorsey and Jack
Teagarden orchestras. Then, from the early 1950s on, he became
heavily involved in radio in the Charlotte area, where he became a
well-known personality.</TE>
<TE>   When he wasn't doing radio, he was writing songs. And he began
finding work as a piano accompanist for some of the leading singers
of the day. Over the next four decades, those singers would include
Helen O'Connell, Judy Garland, Mabel Mercer and Eileen Farrell.</TE>
<TE>   In 1960, McGlohon began an association with composer Alec Wilder.
Planning a local show of Wilder's work, McGlohon contacted the
eccentric composer, who had been living in the Algonquin Hotel in New
York since he was a boy. After a period of correspondence, McGlohon
sent him some original songs.</TE>
<TE>   Wilder was delighted with the music, sparking a partnership that
lasted for the next two decades. They wrote "Blackberry Winter," "Be
a Child" and the two Sinatra songs, which were key elements of
Sinatra's "She Shot Me Down" album.</TE>
<TE>   Some years ago, McGlohon had a regular National Public Radio
program in which he collaborated with Wilder on a series based on
Wilder's book "The American Popular Song." Wilder died in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   McGlohon also wrote "The Wine of May," "Where Is the Child I Used
to Hold" and "Songbird," which was widely recorded by artists such as
jazz pianist George Shearing and cabaret singer Wesla Whitfield.</TE>
<TE>   Active in Presbyterian churches in Charlotte, McGlohon was for
decades a choir director and wrote religious songs such as "Teach Me
Lord."</TE>
<TE>   According to the Charlotte Observer, McGlohon also composed the
occasional ditty for commercial dollars, including one called "I'm a
Super Dooper Pooper," for a firm packaging material on potty
training.</TE>
<TE>   The song became popular with adults, including David Letterman,
who played it occasionally on his late-night television talk show.</TE>
<TE>   McGlohon is survived by his wife, Nan; a son, Reeves; daughters
Fan Smith and Laurie Shouse; and several grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Allan Sachs, 76; Casino Owner in Vegas' Mob Era</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HENDERSON, Nev.</DL>
<LD>Allan D. Sachs, a former hotel-casino owner and prominent gambling
executive when organized crime wielded influence in Las Vegas, has
died. He was 76.</LD>
<LD>   Sachs died late Sunday in a Henderson hospital of complications
from pneumonia. He had been ill for several years, battling cancer
and Parkinson's disease.</LD>
<LD>   During his gambling career dating from the 1950s, Sachs owned the
Stardust and the Fremont hotel-casinos. He and reputed mob leader Moe
Dalitz also opened the Sundance, now Fitzgeralds, in downtown Las
Vegas.</LD>
<TE>   Sachs' business interests led to contentious proceedings with
regulators. The Nevada Gaming Commission, however, licensed Sachs in
1979 to purchase Argent Corp., which owned the Stardust and the
Fremont, from Allen Glick, a suspected front man for the Chicago mob.</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, the licenses were rescinded by the gaming
commission. Sachs and his longtime friend and business partner, Herb
Tobman, were fined $3 million after the commission found the two had
failed to stop skimming by the mob at the Stardust.</TE>
<TE>   In rescinding the gambling licenses, the state said the men failed
to take "appropriate action" to prevent the skim of at least
$1.6million.</TE>
<TE>   Sachs was never proved to be connected with organized crime and
maintained that he had done nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The Stardust and Fremont are now owned by Boyd Gaming Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Sachs was born in Chicago on July 17, 1925, and had lived in Las
Vegas since 1952. He served on a Navy destroyer during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Before becoming a casino executive at the Stardust in 1958, Sachs
had been a partial owner of the Tropicana hotel-casino and worked in
casinos in Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Janice; sons David, Michael and Rudy,
all of Las Vegas, and Dale of Seattle; a sister, Shirley Deland of
Saginaw, Mich.; and a grandson.</TE>

<HD>1.5K Sprint Makes a Dramatic Debut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIDWAY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Julija Tchepalova of Russia gave everything she had at the start. Tor
Arne Hetland of Norway saved a lot for the finish.</LD>
<LD>   It worked for both of them.</LD>
<LD>   Tchepalova and Hetland won gold medals in the women's and men's
1.5-kilometer cross-country sprints Tuesday. Both races helped give
the sport's newest Olympic competition a chaotic debut.</LD>
<TE>   The all-day event had frantic finishes, fallen favorites and
charges of foul play. In the end, Tchepalova and Hetland won their
first gold medals of these Games.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very difficult victory for me," Tchepalova said. "Today
was just my lucky day."</TE>
<TE>   Tchepalova dusted off a pair of skis and rode them to victory for
her second medal of these Olympics. She jumped in front at the start
and pulled away at the end.</TE>
<TE>   "I took a lot of risks," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Evi Sachenbacher of Germany won the silver and Anita Moen of
Norway was the bronze medalist. Americans Tessa Benoit, Kikkan
Randall, Aelin Peterson and Kristina Joder failed to qualify for the
elimination heats.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia Kuenzel of Germany finished fourth and protested the
results, claiming Moen cut her off by illegally changing lanes in the
final stretch. But a competition panel overruled the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Tchepalova covered the Soldier Hollow course in 3 minutes 10.6
seconds--controlling the race from start to finish.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tchepalova won bronze in the 10K classical event. Tuesday's
victory was her second gold medal in two Olympics--she won the 30K
freestyle in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Hetland started his final in third place, patiently waiting to
make a move. He passed Italy's Cristian Zorzi in the final 100
meters. Germany's Peter Schlickenrieder then did the same thing,
edging the Italian by the tip of his skis.</TE>
<TE>   Schlickenrieder won the silver in his final Olympics, and Zorzi
won the bronze.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Swenson, Torin Koos, Lars Flora and Kris Freeman of the U.S.
didn't qualify for elimination heats.</TE>
<TE>   Schlickenrieder protested the results, claiming Hetland cut him
off by illegally changing lanes in the final stretch. He tried to
withdraw his complaint after talking to team members, but the
competition panel already had overruled it.</TE>
<TE>   Hetland covered the course in 2 minutes 56.9 seconds.</TE>

<HD>Valenta Adds a New Twist</HD>
<DH>Czech spins five times--an Olympic first--with three flips
to win gold; hometown favorite Pack takes silver.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Ales Valenta of the Czech Republic did what no one in Olympic history
has ever done in winning the men's aerial freestyle skiing
competition Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   On his second and final run off a high-speed ramp, flying some 50
to 60 feet into the air, he executed three back flips while--at the
same time--spinning through five full twists. No one in Olympic
aerials competition had ever before done five twists. No one else
even tried on Tuesday, sticking with the comparative safety of four.</LD>
<LD>   Defending Olympic champion Eric Bergoust, 32, of Missoula, Mont.,
had registered the highest score on the first of the day's two jumps
and, jumping last in the second round, was in position to overtake
Valenta. But Bergoust, in a stunning mistake for a competitor who
thrives on consistency, took off too fast, never caught up and landed
with a splat. He slid from first to 12th--dead last.</LD>
<TE>   Joe Pack, 23, who lives here in Park City, cleanly sailed through
two quadruple-twisting triple back flips to win the silver medal.
Alexei Grichin, 22, of Belarus, claimed third.</TE>
<TE>   Pack was exuberant throughout and after his jumps. After the
first, he played air guitar on his skis. After the second, walking
past reporters from around the world, he affected the tone and
expression that actor Bill Murray used when playing the golf-course
groundskeeper in "Caddyshack," saying, "Cinderella story. Park City.
Ah, he's got about 160 K2s there," a reference to his ski length and
the brand-name. "Hits it home!"</TE>
<TE>   Pack then gave his beaming girlfriend, Marci Wiser, a big kiss and
got hugs and more kisses from dozens of friends and family members
who had gathered at the base of the hill. He said, "I'm really pumped
I ended up second!"</TE>
<TE>   The double stunner, however, was Valenta's triumph and, just
moments later, Bergoust's failure.</TE>
<TE>   Much as U.S. freestyle skier Jonny Moseley had thrown a new trick
in the men's moguls competition here just a few days ago--a
720-degree off-axis spin dubbed the Dinner Roll--Valenta was intent
on performing the five-twister to push the boundaries of the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't really thinking about doing [the jump] because of
winning," the 29-year-old Valenta said. "I wanted to do it because I
can do it."</TE>
<TE>   He first did the trick in November. He did it again in a contest
last month in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Valenta's first jump Tuesday left him tied for fifth. After
nailing the landing on the five-twister, he collapsed at the bottom
of the hill in the snow, face-up, skis still on, and threw his arms
up in triumph.</TE>
<TE>   Aerials scoring is a combination of height and distance in the air
(20%), execution and precision of the acrobatic tricks while airborne
(50%) and landing (30%).</TE>
<TE>   The five-twister rocketed Valenta into first place, with a total
of 257.02 points. The five-twister was worth 129.98.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Bergoust's first jump--even with only four twists--had
been worth 130.38; he was fluid in the air and stuck his landing. The
degree of difficulty on Bergoust's second jump, again only four
twists, was less than Valenta's, 4.45 to 4.85, but if he nailed the
jump--solid acrobatics and a clean landing--he could still win a
second gold.</TE>
<TE>   Even Pack, watching below, sitting in second place, thought gold
for Bergoust--who already had won this year's World Cup aerials
title--inevitable: "I was thinking bronze, man," adding of Bergoust,
"He's the man, he's kind of my mentor."</TE>
<TE>   Coming through the ramp, however, Bergoust built up too much
speed. He said afterward that he knew as soon as he took off that he
was in trouble: "I'm probably not going to be able to land this no
matter what I do."</TE>
<TE>   As Bergoust landed, his back and then head slapped against the
hill. The crowd gasped.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I had to do a really nice jump, really had to risk
it, and sometimes when you risk it, it doesn't work," Bergoust said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he had no regrets. "Ales Valenta put down a huge
score. I wasn't going for silver. I wanted to go for gold."</TE>

<HD>Eddie 'the Eagle' Still Looking for Respect</HD>

<LD>Eddie Edwards is still "the Eagle," telling people about having an
Olympic dream and following it.</LD>
<LD>   He is a popular speaker on the topic of his quixotic quest to
compete in the 1988 Winter Olympic ski-jumping competition.</LD>
<LD>   You remember Eddie. He was the hapless British ski jumper, the one
with the thick eyeglasses and the penchant for taking dramatic,
dangerous, head-over-heel falls. He went to the Calgary Games as the
first British ski jumper, as a man who trained on dry land with bad
equipment and who left Calgary with two last-place finishes, the
nickname "the Eagle" and folk-hero status.</LD>
<TE>   "People seemed to appreciate how much I wanted to pursue something
I loved," Edwards said. "They seemed to understand how much ski
jumping meant to me."</TE>
<TE>   Not everybody appreciated Edwards. Especially not his country's
Winter Olympics federation. "They were embarrassed by me," Edwards
said. "They seemed to think I was only a big joke and that somehow I
wasn't good for the image."</TE>
<TE>   Edwards was off the slopes from 1989 until 1997, when he began
training with the hopes of making the 1998 Nagano Games. But he was
unable to meet British qualifying standards he felt had been
instituted to keep him out of competition and now is officially
retired from ski jumping.</TE>
<TE>   Besides doing public speaking, Edwards, 38, is a second-year law
student at De Montfort University in Leicester, England. He also does
a weekly radio show on the BBC and is excited about a movie project
on his life.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards said he decided to go to law school after being involved
in a lawsuit over trusteeship of his post-Olympic earnings. Edwards
was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1992 after he said a trusteeship
that was supposed to invest his earnings misused the money.</TE>
<TE>   "It was in going through the legal system that I decided some day
I would like to be a lawyer," Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards still wears glasses, but without the thick lenses that
made the world laugh in 1988. He says he will always enjoy being
"Eddie the Eagle," and that he has no regrets about his Olympic
experience.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were some people who considered me a joke, I'm sorry
about that," Edwards said. "But I did not do it for any other reason
except that I loved to ski jump and I had hopes that by my doing it,
other people in my country would take up the sport."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since 1988, Great Britain had an entry in the
ski-jumping competition at Salt Lake City. Glynn Pedersen, 20, didn't
qualify for the finals in either the 90-meter or 120-meter event. And
Edwards doesn't really consider Pedersen his successor. Pedersen is
from Thunder Bay, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "He may have qualified technically because he has some ties to
England," Edwards said. "But he's not British. My hope is still some
day that Great Britain will have another ski jumper. That's what I
hope my legacy can be."</TE>

<LD>Hayley Wickenheiser and Jayna Hefford scored on breakaways six
seconds apart as Canada rallied from its first deficit of the Salt
Lake Games to defeat Finland, 7-3, Tuesday and advance to the
gold-medal game.</LD>
<LD>   The victory propelled the seven-time world champions into a
rematch with the United States, which defeated Sweden, 4-0, in the
other semifinal. The U.S. women won the gold medal in Nagano and beat
Canada eight consecutive times in exhibitions leading up to the 2002
Games.</LD>
<LD>   Tuula Puputti stopped 47 shots for Finland, which will play the
U.S.-Sweden loser for the bronze. Kim St.-Pierre stopped 15 shots for
Canada.</LD>
<TE>   Finland scored with 25 seconds left in the first period--the first
goal against Canada in four games at the Olympics--when Tiia Reima
beat St.-Pierre after a scramble in front of the net.</TE>
<TE>   Reima made it 2-2 at 2:56 of the second and, less than a minute
later, Reima assisted on Katja Riipi's goal to give Finland a 3-2
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Wickenheiser scored with 3:19 gone in the third to tie the score,
3-3, and Hefford gave the Canadians a the lead for good. Vicky
Sunohara, Cassie Campbell and Therese Brisson scored within 97
seconds to make it 7-3.</TE>
<TE>   Russia 5, Germany 0--Tatiana Burina scored twice in the first
period to lead Russia to victory in the fifth-place game.</TE>
<TE>   China 2, Kazakstan 1--Hongmei Liu scored the game-winning goal
1:39 into overtime in the seventh-place game.</TE>

<HD>D.C. Vote Favors Tyson</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mike Tyson traveling circus has finally found a home.</LD>
<LD>   Or has it?</LD>
<LD>   The D.C. Boxing and Wrestling Commission in the nation's capital
voted 3-0 Tuesday morning to grant Tyson a boxing license, setting
the stage for the former two-time heavyweight champion to fight
current champion Lennox Lewis at the MCI Center on June 8.</LD>
<TE>   But nothing involving Tyson ever seems to happen quickly or with
certainty.</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday afternoon, commission vice chairman Michael Brown was
backtracking, saying, "The first step has been taken. A lot of things
have to be done."</TE>
<TE>   The next step will be a public hearing March 12, followed by
another commission vote, which would seem to minimize the importance
of Tuesday's vote.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Staples Center remain interested in the fight and
Manuel Soto, chairman of the California State Athletic Commission,
has spoken positively about the economic benefits of the fight. But
Tyson's handlers have not yet applied to California, focusing instead
on Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The first wave of protest in D.C. arose at a commission news
conference Tuesday. About 12 members of the National Organization for
Woman showed up, holding up signs that said, "Stop violence against
women."</TE>
<TE>   Tyson, who served three years in an Indiana prison on a rape
conviction, is facing allegations of sexual assault by two women who
claim Tyson attacked them on separate occasions in his Las Vegas
home. Las Vegas police have said there is "credible" evidence on at
least one of the allegations and the investigation continues on the
other. No charges have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a man with an appalling history of violence against
women," NOW president Terry O'Neill told the Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Even if he receives a license, Tyson still needs approval from
another source: his opponent. Lewis has said he won't agree to the
fight, which could pay each man more than $20 million, unless Tyson
first agrees to get psychiatric help.</TE>
<TE>   It was Tyson's behavior at a New York news conference last month
that put this fight in doubt. He threw the first punch in a brawl
that culminated, according to Lewis, with Tyson biting him on the
left thigh. No one outside the Lewis camp has seen the bite marks.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequently, Nevada, New York and Colorado rejected a Tyson
fight. The Georgia commission granted Tyson a license, but Gov. Roy
Barnes has said he's against the fight.</TE>
