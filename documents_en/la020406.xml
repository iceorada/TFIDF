<HD>For Her, the Fight Is Far From Over</HD>
<DH>Singer-songwriter Ely Guerra of Mexico goes against
commercial expectations with her dark artistic vision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ely Guerra is too short for the stool she's supposed to sit on during
her performance for "LATV Live," the Latin music cable program on
KJLA. The diminutive Mexican singer-songwriter perches on the edge of
the seat, holding her big pink acoustic guitar.</LD>
<LD>   Her position looks awkward, legs spread under her long black
dress, one red sandal dangling, the other stretching to reach the
floor. Stagehands bring another chair, but this one has armrests she
considers too confining.</LD>
<LD>   "I move constantly," warns Guerra, in Los Angeles for a series of
appearances that includes a show Sunday night with her four-piece
band at the Key Club. "I try my best not to bang myself up."</LD>
<TE>   So it's back to the stool, which the singer moves to the
precarious edge of a platform. When cameras roll for the live show,
Guerra starts singing softly at first, just a breathy whisper and
fragile falsetto that quiet her rambunctious in-studio fans.</TE>
<TE>   Then the singer seems to fall into a trance, her head held back,
eyes closed, throat wide open. Out pours a husky and deeply wounded
voice. The plaintive lyrics of "No Quiero Hablar" (I Don't Want to
Talk) turn to soulful moans and gypsy wails.</TE>
<TE>   Her torso and guitar twist together, her left leg flailing almost
convulsively. The foot that could barely brace her is now stamping so
hard it thunders through the sound stage as she screams, "No, no, no,
no quiero hablar."</TE>
<TE>   Offstage, members of her staff are at the edge of their seats,
worried that her volcanic emotions might propel her backward off the
platform.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the suspense of Ely Guerra live, more primal experience
than simple performance.</TE>
<TE>   Guerra, 30, is hailed as a heroine of Mexico's rich alternative
music scene. A self-taught guitarist, she's an intense and brooding
composer with a defiantly distinctive sound, blending muted samba
rhythms with trip-hop beats and ethereal electronica. She's been
playing professionally half her life, struggling all the way to stay
true to her admittedly dark artistic vision.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico's male-chauvinist music industry, she says, her beauty
has been her bane. A pretty woman is expected to sing pretty pop
songs.</TE>
<TE>   "My career is not about money," Guerra says during an interview in
eloquent Spanish peppered with saucy slang. "Maybe what I have to
offer through my music is an awakening of new things in other people.
Because I see that for me, day by day, music educates me, transforms
me and makes me strong."</TE>
<TE>   Over and over in her career, Guerra has had to plumb that inner
strength, which she explores in songs of solitude and longing.</TE>
<TE>   More than once, she has stormed out of radio stations during
interviews, infuriated by the sexist tack taken by male radio
personalities. While on the air in Tijuana, she scolded one
disrespectful DJ who kept making sexual insinuations, calling him "a
menace to the nation" for promoting a backward "Third World
mentality."</TE>
<TE>   After the confrontation, Guerra shaved off her long hair and for
two years looked like a Mexican Sinead O'Connor.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sick and tired of being considered a beautiful idiot," she
says, using a Mexican profanity. "Maybe this way they'll want to talk
about something else."</TE>
<TE>   Guerra, her naturally brown hair briefly blond and now dyed black,
has recorded three albums on two labels over 10 years. The first two
are out of print, cherished like relics by her cult following. Her
latest work, 1999's critically acclaimed "Lotofire," was finally
released last month in the United States by Higher Octave. It's the
only one to make it across the border so far.</TE>
<TE>   But Guerra's deeply introspective work, recorded in New York with
top studio musicians, almost didn't see the light of day. At first,
her label in Mexico refused to release it, she says. Executives
simply didn't know what do with such a stubbornly noncommercial work.
For Guerra, the album was too personal to abandon. "Lotofire" was her
life by slices: "Yo No" (Not Me), her demand for respect as a woman;
"Tengo Frio," her admission of fear and hurt twisted into need; "Yo
Prometo" (I Promise), her tender vow of love to a soft bossa beat.</TE>
<TE>   From her first album in 1992, Guerra posed a puzzle for macho
marketing logic, which held that an attractive woman who could play
guitar and write her own songs was too hard a sell.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obnoxious to hear them say, 'Guerra, you're talented, but
since you're pretty I don't know how to sell you,'" says the singer,
who has a pure complexion, high cheekbones and finely chiseled jaw.</TE>
<TE>   "But I can't really blame them so much. The whole process of music
created by women in Mexico is something new. It's barely starting to
grow, and I think I was caught at the beginning of all that. The
labels were not the only ones who were misguided. I was a little lost
myself at first."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Guerra was born in Monterrey and raised in Guadalajara,
the middle of three daughters in a well-to-do family. Her father was
a professional soccer player and coach; her mother a model and
homemaker. She recalls a wholesome, happy upbringing, filled with
ballet classes and swimming meets.</TE>
<TE>   But very little music. The stereo was rarely played at home, and
she never took music lessons. She wasn't even much of a fan. Even
today, she feels intimidated in music stores, she says, mimicking
fingers anxiously flicking through record racks. And she gets nervous
when people insist on sharing their newest musical finds, mocking a
breathless "have you heard this one yet?" excitement.</TE>
<TE>   "I stress out because I'm so abnormal," says Guerra, who recently
ended a five-year relationship with an incurable music fanatic, Tito
of the Mexican rock group Molotov. "I'm 90% Catholic and fully
flagellant, with all the blame. So I feel guilty that I'm not
voracious about music. That's not normal for a musician."</TE>
<TE>   She's casual about identifying musical influences. Brazilian music
her parents played while she was growing up. Depeche Mode albums
shared by a friend. The old standards of Agustin Lara and modern
stuff by Edie Brickell.</TE>
<TE>   And lyrically, the poetic songwriting of Joni Mitchell and Silvio
Rodriguez. "I started writing songs to express myself, because I was
a girl who couldn't talk back to my parents when they committed some
injustice, so to speak," says Guerra, who is much more powerful in
person than on her oddly restrained new record.</TE>
<TE>   "When I would try to say something, I'd get a lump in my throat
and I'd feel like crying."</TE>
<TE>   The first song she wrote for her mother was titled "Perdoname"
(Forgive Me).</TE>
<TE>   During her appearance on "LATV Live," host Giovanny Blanco asks if
she has any advice for her young fans, who chant "Ely, Ely, Ely"
after each song.</TE>
<TE>   No advice really, the singer says sweetly. All she has to offer is
the lesson of her experience: "Quien sabe luchar, sabe ganar."</TE>
<TE>   Whoever knows how to struggle knows how to win.</TE>

<HD>He Came, He Thawed and He Conquered</HD>
<DH>It took a little while, but Harry Connick Jr. and his big
band managed to raise the temperature at the freezing Kodak Theatre.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harry Connick Jr. does so many things so well--from singing to acting
to piano playing to composing--that one sometimes wonders whether
he's found a successful formula for cloning. But of the many
entertainment media in which he functions, none is more convincing
than his appearances in front of the hard-swinging Harry Connick Jr.
Big Band.</LD>
<LD>   His performance at the Kodak Theatre Thursday night, however,
opened on an odd note. Connick's first two songs--"It Might as Well
Be Spring" and "So in Love"--displayed some crisp ensemble work from
the band. But Connick, too captivated by the Sinatra simulation that
is the least appealing aspect of his art, seemed to be starting
slowly, a bit out of focus with the music.</LD>
<LD>   The situation was not particularly enhanced by the fact that the
Kodak, for some incomprehensible reason, was chilled to a temperature
more appropriate for preserving a side of beef. Audience members,
some wearing lightweight garb, had no choice but to hunker down in
their seats in an effort to avoid the gale-force air-conditioner
breezes.</LD>
<TE>   Fortunately, both Connick and the room eventually heated up, the
former much more quickly than the latter. By the time he'd dug into a
darkly inventive piano solo on "Charade," followed by a loosely
swinging "I'll Be Seeing You," Connick was cooking, blending his
singing, his piano playing and the collective skills of his ensemble
(including fiery trumpet work from Leroy Jones) into a rich musical
gumbo.</TE>
<TE>   Humorous and quick-witted, an entertaining raconteur between
songs, Connick warned early on that, with a bunch of jazz musicians
on stage, the evening would probably be unpredictable. And he was
right. Although individual segments were obviously well planned and
rehearsed, the program's most appealing aspect was the spontaneous,
improvisatory fashion in which it was presented.</TE>
<TE>   There was no hesitation on Connick's part, for example, to offer a
slow, densely harmonized (with additional multiphonic sounds from the
saxophones) version of Antonio Carlos Jobim's "Insensitive." Going
against bossa nova type, the rendering emphasized the poignancy of
Norman Gimbel's English lyrics rather than the genre's floating
rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   Shifting gears easily, Connick added a tune from his failed
Broadway musical, "Thou Shalt Not," before dipping into a set of
tunes from "Songs I Heard," his album of music from children's films.
Among the highlights: a New Orleans band version of
"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and a revival of "The
Jitterbug," a song written for, and dropped from, "The Wizard of Oz."</TE>
<TE>   He added an original, "Luscious," featuring the jaunty trombone
playing and singing of Lucien Barbarian, and wrapped the set with a
colorful group of songs in which he dueted with the blues-drenched
guitar playing of Jonathan DuBose Jr. By that time, the Kodak was
very warm indeed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

Terrace Theatre, 300 East Ocean Blvd., Long Beach, 8 p.m. $50-$65.

<HD>A Brush With Pop</HD>
<DH>A MOMA retrospective on Gerhard Richter might make you
wrongly think he's a Conceptual painter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Gerhard Richter's modest 1962 painting "Table" is one of the earliest
works in the German artist's enormous retrospective at the Museum of
Modern Art, and it's also one of the strangest. The canvas might look
odd, but actually it's composed with an astringent logic.</LD>
<LD>   "Table" sets up certain parameters that Richter, 70, has spent the
past 40 years exploring in diverse ways. We don't ordinarily think of
paint and brush strokes as objects, or things that are capable of
being seen and touched. In Richter's paintings, though, their
materiality is always asserted as part of the bargain.</LD>
<LD>   The painting depicts an ordinary metal folding table, the kind of
institutional model you might find in a meeting hall, with a plain
white top and simple black legs. The canvas is split horizontally
into a dark gray floor beneath a light, mottled gray wall. That's all
there is--except for a furious slather of brushy gray paint in
looping arcs that Richter has thinly scribbled across the painting's
surface, as if in a controlled act of artful vandalism.</LD>
<TE>   The scribble is weird. You must look through it to see the table
and the room. The rudimentary illusion of pictorial space gives way
to something material: physical marks of paint on a surface. Paint
becomes objectified.</TE>
<TE>   It's as if you're looking at gestural paint resting on a tabletop.
That's what makes this work so odd. A table is a flat plane on which
you put things. "Table" is a flat plane on which you put brush
strokes.</TE>
<TE>   The subject could be anything. Phantom Interceptor jets. Maria
Callas striding down a staircase in a lame evening dress. An abstract
field of explosive colors. The funeral of a gang of terrorists. A
luminous tangle of dark and silvery hues, dragged across a canvas
with a squeegee. Paint samples from the hardware store. The back of a
woman's head. Whatever he paints, Richter always calls attention to
painting.</TE>
<TE>   He distinguishes images in paintings from those made by cameras,
which are ubiquitous in a modern culture of mass media. Camera
images, like the magazine photographs of metal folding tables Richter
copied in his 1962 painting, have a different aim. They aspire to
transparency. You're meant to look right through them, as if actually
seeing the table (or the jets or the opera star). Photographs, even
great ones, entail a degree of obliviousness to what's right in front
of your eyes. Great paintings don't.</TE>
<TE>   A Richter painting intercepts the phantoms of camera imagery.
Richter is a Pop artist, like Warhol and Lichtenstein, but with a
distinctive edge. For 40 years he has made works that insist on
painting's indelible power in a world awash in mass media.</TE>
<TE>   Richter is a great painter, but unhappily the MOMA retrospective
is not a great exhibition. It's the artist's third--retrospectives
were organized in 1986 and 1988, and they traveled throughout Europe
and North America--it is huge, and the selection includes dozens of
marvelous works. Curator Robert Storr assembled 188 paintings from
every facet of Richter's career. The show has the pomp and
circumstance of a coronation--and given Richter's achievement,
rightly so.</TE>
<TE>   But it also feels lopsided. Richter's work is presented with
partiality. Rather than Pop, the show stresses a connection to
Conceptual art. The Dresden-born artist is also cast in the narrow
role of brooding, sorrowful German--a familiar role that describes
only one limited facet of his work.</TE>
<TE>   American audiences first got to know Richter's art during the
1980s, when his big, glamorous color-abstractions were part of the
hubbub over Neo-Expressionist painting. Some Richter paintings took
large-scale American abstraction of the 1950s and reflected it back
on the country of its origin. (That's one reason Americans loved it.)
The brushy, paint-loaded gestural canvases were finished off with a
squeegee. The peculiar result, akin to 1962's "Table," was paintings
with the look of giant color reproductions of abstract art but with
all the material presence of a traditional painting. These gorgeous
pictures were integral to the return of European (and especially
German) art to international prominence, after 40 years of New York
dominance.</TE>
<TE>   The next big jolt came in 1990, when the St. Louis Art Museum
circulated a show of an astounding 1988 suite of 15 black-and-white
oil paintings, based on documentary photographs of the notorious
Baader-Meinhof gang of German terrorists. (Titled "October 18, 1977,"
the show was seen at the Lannan Foundation, then in West Los
Angeles.) Photo-based representation and abstraction have been
Richter's focus as a painter, ever since the quirky "Table."</TE>
<TE>   "October 18, 1977" is featured in the retrospective (MOMA now owns
the suite), and its bleak eulogy to a sordid episode of rancid
libertarianism is powerful. Yet you can find yourself well into the
1990s rooms of this chronologically installed show before it suddenly
dawns that relatively few color abstractions from the first 30 years
have been included.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s and 1970s Richter also made numerous paintings based
on commercial color charts from the hardware store. Just two are
here. There are beautifully installed rooms devoted to gray or
black-and-white paintings, but not one is devoted to color. Color is
instead scattered about, like accent pillows.</TE>
<TE>   The three monumental diptychs "November," "December" and "January"
(all 1989) are among Richter's most haunting gestural
abstractions--they're each 13 feet tall and 10 feet wide--and they're
exquisitely installed with "Betty" (1988), a small and luminous
picture of the back of a blond woman's head. But these wintry
abstractions are Richter's most dark and brooding, with great slabs
of black, white and gray paint obscuring the color underneath.</TE>
<TE>   "Betty," installed at the end of the room, turns her head away, as
if staring into the grayness that fills the painted space behind her.
It's a pointed echo of what visitors do when standing before the
nearby diptychs.</TE>
<TE>   Richter's gestural abstractions are an important body of work.
Color and gesture signal a visceral immediacy in painting, which he
then purposefully undermines by scraping the image. The effect is
similar to what Richter gets in his photo-based figurative works,
when the finished painting is gone over lightly with a dry brush and
the wet paint is loosely blurred. The result is a nominally
Expressionist painting, which actually looks more like a color slide
of an Expressionist painting. Richter's gestural abstractions are,
oddly enough, as visually photographic as his paintings based on
photographs from magazines, newspapers or his own camera.</TE>
<TE>   The color charts, which faithfully record the neat rows of
rectangular samples, are among the few paintings Richter has made
that are not softly blurred or out of focus. They don't need to be.
In a painting of a commercial color chart, pure abstraction and
faithful representation are already simultaneous.</TE>
<TE>   Notably, Richter also tends to avoid charts that feature primary
or secondary colors, choosing instead to show custom colors that
cannot be pinned down. (Melon? Puce? Mocha latte?) The color is as
specific yet elusive--and riveting--as the commingling of
representation and abstraction.</TE>
<TE>   The inclusion of just two color charts in the retrospective (one
installed in a stairwell) has a "seen one, seen 'em all" feeling,
which is disappointing. These pure Pop paintings are reduced to a
conceptual gesture in Richter's career. And that's where this
retrospective goes awry. Coupled with the general suppression of
color, the show's emphasis on black and white, on representational
subject matter and on photographic sources is what aligns Richter's
paintings on the side of Conceptual art.</TE>
<TE>   Important points of connection between Conceptual art and
Richter's work can be seen, but Richter is not a Conceptual artist.
Conceptual art was born of a 1960s conviction that painting was
bankrupt. Richter's has asserted from the start that it's not.</TE>
<TE>   The selection also plays up the dark and brooding Richter--a
Romantic born under the specter of National Socialism and raised to
maturity under Communism, who carries the burden of history on his
sagging shoulders and whose heroic struggle in life is the salvation
of painting, even as it withers on the vine. It turns him into the
latest variation of a pop cliche of the German artist that has been
in place for centuries--a Caspar David Friedrich for our time.</TE>
<TE>   But Richter is as much a dandy, committed to fastidious
stylishness and razor-sharp calculation, as he is a latter-day
moralist. He's a mushy sentimentalist, too--check out all the doting
recent paintings of his baby--not to mention a vulgar voyeur, as
evidenced by lewd paintings of prostitutes. The retrospective
flattens Richter out, making him a dour German painter acceptable to
the Conceptual perspective that is institutionalized in art today.</TE>
<TE>   "Conceptual painter" is a batty oxymoron. For Richter the art
object and its effect are paramount, not the idea and its intention.
Richter is a Pop artist. Camera pictures are treated like found
objects. Painting is asserted for its capacity to manipulate
materials in ways media imagery can't. Color makes a claim to
delirious unruliness.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, two years after he fled East Germany for the West,
Richter and a few colleagues billed themselves as "Capitalist
Realists," a German variant of Pop that had fun with their former
Soviet status as Socialist Realist artists. They didn't get very far
with the gambit, and commentators typically describe this moment as a
passing escapade. In truth, it set Richter on an amazing path--one he
still follows to this day.</TE>

<HD>South Coast Rep Names New Complex for Board President</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa will name its new
78,000-square-foot complex the Folino Theatre Center for board
president Paul Folino, the largest single donor in SCR's 37-year
history. Folino has donated $10 million to the building project.</LD>
<LD>   The expansion includes a renovation of the existing 507-seat
Mainstage; a new 336-seat theater; and the conversion of the existing
Second Stage into the 95-seat studio, a space for play development
workshops and youth performances.</LD>
<LD>   In February, 18 months ahead of schedule, the five-year capital
campaign for the building project had nearly reached its $40-million
goal. That goal was then increased to $50 million. Folino and his
family had donated $2.5 million to the campaign in October last year,
as well as a $7.5-million gift that was previously designated as
anonymous.</LD>
<TE>   Folino, 56, is the president and CEO of Costa Mesa-based Emulex
Corp., a maker of data storage networking equipment. He has served on
the board of SCR since 1996 and became its president for the
2000-2001 season.</TE>
<TE>   He saw his first live theater performance at age 9 when he was
bused from the Seattle housing project where his family lived to see
a professional production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream." Family
fare, he hopes, will be emphasized at the new facility.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always had a soft spot for education and outreach," Folino
said. "Most repertory theaters don't have strong family-oriented
programs. Now's a chance to expand what SCR does best to family
audiences."</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Casting Choices: Color, Talent or Box Office?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I find myself fervently hoping that Ron Howard will respond to Lisa
Navarrete's excellent Counterpunch expose of "A Beautiful Mind" ("Why
the Whitewashing of Alicia Nash?" April 1), but I seriously doubt
that any explanation would suffice.</LD>
<LD>   I am furious and grievously disappointed. I so enjoyed this film
and now cannot get out of my mind the incredible slap in the face
caused by not casting a Latina actress to portray Mrs. Nash.</LD>
<LD>   SAMANTHA S. KIMMEL</LD>
<TE>   North Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The unheralded color swap Navarrete writes about is an outrage,
and it begs the question: "Why?" Contemplating that is really
depressing.</TE>
<TE>   To imagine that the choice was made, at some point, by a bunch of
rich white guys to delete a Latina protagonist from a historical
biography is the stuff of satire. Could it have been casual, as
Navarrete wonders, or was it considered? It was one or the other.
Neither option is any good. A decision was made to tell us a lie. Can
they pretend that all over the world people don't think of Alicia
Nash as a beautiful and faithful Irish Catholic wife?</TE>
<TE>   MICHELE SUTTER</TE>
<TE>   Venice</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In spite of all the information given regarding "A Beautiful Mind"
being a movie inspired by the biography about John Nash, not a
by-the-dot retelling of his life, critics and poison-pen losers alike
have harped on the gay-or-not-gay angle, anti-Semite or not,
accusations of cruelty toward the mentally ill, etc.</TE>
<TE>   Now Navarrete is accusing Ron Howard and Brian Grazer of covering
up the ethnic origin of Alicia Nash by casting a non-Latina actress
(Jennifer Connelly). Never mind that this film is (once again) based
on the life of John and Alicia Nash, or that Mrs. Nash's race was
never a factor in any of the points of this movie, or that colorblind
casting does work both ways.</TE>
<TE>   To use "A Beautiful Mind" as a scapegoat to get attention for a
cause is what is unacceptable, not a casting decision or dramatic
license! La Raza should, for want of a better term, get a life!</TE>
<TE>   JULIE FRIAS BYERS</TE>
<TE>   Temple City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Navarrete's piece brings up a disturbing point about the Hollywood
thought process. I too was bewildered by Ron Howard's choice to
portray Alicia Nash as a WASP woman instead of who she really was. I
do strongly believe that the filmmakers were fully aware of this
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Well, like it or not, the real Alicia Nash is from El Salvador,
not New England. It's about time that Hollywood personalities join
the 21st century and stop longing for those "Happy Days" back in
"Mayberry."</TE>
<TE>   ALEJANDRO J. DIAZ</TE>
<TE>   Panorama City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'm a little confused. In Lorenza Munoz's story, "Casting a Wider
Net for Kids" (April 1), she writes that Nickelodeon changed the lead
role for a show from white to Asian after Asian American actress
Irene Ng clearly proved to be the best person for the part.</TE>
<TE>   Munoz goes on to say that "the way things are usually done--at
least with big studio movies--is the reverse." She cites as an
example that George Clooney got a lead role in the film "Three Kings"
that was originally intended for a black actor.</TE>
<TE>   Funny, that doesn't sound like "the reverse" to me. Quite the
opposite, it sounds exactly the same. A part is originally written
for a person of one race, a person of another race proves to be the
best for the role, and so the part is awarded to that actor. Now
that's progress!</TE>
<TE>   JACK BARIC</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When I go to the movies I don't care if the lead actor is male,
female, black, white, Japanese or whatever. I care about how well the
movie convinces me that I am not sitting in a darkened theater, I am
actually in New York, Dallas, Copenhagen or whatever. I care about
how well I am convinced I am watching real people and not actors. I
care about how well I am moved by a good story.</TE>
<TE>   So let's forget this people-of-color business and get on with
making good movies.</TE>

<LD>Thanks for your review of Kenneth Branagh's Richard III ("Branagh
Excels in 'Richard III,'" March 30). Branagh is a marvelous
Shakespearean actor. The only problem is that, unless I win the
lottery, I won't be making it to Sheffield, England, in time to see
the play.</LD>
<LD>   A much better option is to check out Circus Theatrical's
production of "Richard III" now playing at the Odyssey Theatre in
West L.A. Jack Stehlin's Richard is thrilling, visceral, funny,
frightening, pathetic, chilling and ultimately mesmerizing.</LD>

<LD>Re: "Changed Tunes" (by Agustin Gurza, March 23): It is refreshing to
hear that L.A.'s very own "king of narco-corridos" will now shift his
glorification of drug-peddling songs to more traditional renditions.
This, of course, comes way after Pedro Rivera's (Long Beach-based)
music label generated millions of dollars in revenue by utilizing
that very same genre.</LD>
<LD>   But one question still remains: Will the Rivera family continue to
exploit its fan base by the unrelenting alcohol theme they recycle in
most of their musical interpretations? That prospect is likely since
they are in the business only to make money and not worry about the
prevalent alcoholism problem that exists within the Latino community.</LD>

<LD>Contrary to the review of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young by Randy Lewis
("Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young in Peak Form," April 1), my wife and I
found the band worse with the addition of Neil Young, not better.</LD>
<LD>   Where Lewis saw "ferocious guitar work," we saw repetitious hard
strumming. Where he saw a "firebrand stage manner," we saw a
pathetic, foot-stomping old rocker with wooden movements.</LD>
<LD>   With Young, the group lost the elegance of its trademark
harmonizing. They gave him far too much stage time and put too many
of his stiff songs on the playlist. Graham Nash may as well have
videotaped his contributions.</LD>

<LD>The appointment of Diane Reeves as a "creative chairperson" for the
Hollywood Bowl's jazz programs ("L.A. Phil Names Jazz Leader," by

that L.A. Philharmonic executive vice president and managing director
Deborah Borda allows her some authority.</LD>
<LD>   But the loss of John Clayton as director of jazz programming at
the Bowl is incalculable. Why was his contract not renewed? Merely
because it was negotiated by Borda's controversial predecessor,

<LD>I was extremely disappointed to learn that ABC canceled "Once and
Again" (Morning Report, March 29). I have been an avid viewer of the
show since it first aired in the fall of 1999. I weathered the myriad
time-slot changes, one hiatus after another, and I am still watching
it. The show does what so few shows do on TV: It lifts your heart, it
makes you laugh, it makes you cry, and it deals with real issues.</LD>
<LD>   With the cancellation, I no longer have any reason to tune in to
ABC. While I am saddened with the loss of this great show, I will
definitely smirk with delight each Wednesday when I read the weekly
Nielsen ratings and witness the continued demise of the ABC network.</LD>

<TE>   Let's hope secret back-room negotiations are taking place
somewhere with TV producers Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz
trying to find a new home for their exceptional but newly canceled
drama, "Once and Again."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many other of the show's fans, evidently, I'm not crying
bloody murder at ABC for cutting it loose. Clearly, it's a show
that's too good for ABC--in fact, for network television in general.
Business is business, after all, and if "Once and Again" wasn't
pulling in numbers sufficient to carry its weight, well, I know
there's little else to be done--especially considering ABC's current
jaw-dropping bottom-line difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's a pretty sorry entertainment world where a conduit
can't be found to carry television programming of such outstanding
quality, even if that quality admittedly appeals to a smaller
audience. There are those of us viewers who, after all, are
interested in something other than today's lowest-common-denominator
fare, and we spend money just like the next guy--whether on
TV-advertised products or cable subscription fees.</TE>
<TE>   So how about it, Lifetime or HBO: Either of you care to step up to
the plate? Or, hey, how about Showtime, who not all that long ago
brought us wonderful new episodes of yet another "failed" drama too
good for the broadcast networks, this one originally from CBS: a
little thing called "The Paper Chase."</TE>

<LD>With all the talk about violence on TV, what about simple rudeness?
When I watch "NYPD Blue," "ER" or any other of the popular TV shows,
I am stunned by the unrelentingly rude, humorless and abrasive manner
of the characters. I couldn't spend two minutes with such people.</LD>
<LD>   I am glad I grew up on the television fare of the 1950s such as "I
Love Lucy," "My Little Margie" and "Ozzie and Harriet." The
characters were sweet and gracious, as are most people in real life.</LD>
<LD>   A popular TV psychologist recently talked about the "Never-never
land of Ozzie and Harriet." Well, I grew up in a whole neighborhood
of Ozzies and Harriets, as did millions of other Americans. And the
sweet, well-mannered happy American families are still out there by
the millions, but they have an uphill battle countering the crude and
uncivil manner which is now the norm for TV personages.</LD>

<LD>As a former Navy doctor who treated wounded soldiers, sailors and
Marines during the Vietnam War, even I found it difficult to watch
the new Hollywood realism in movies such as "Black Hawk Down," "We
Were Soldiers" and "Behind Enemy Lines." However, I agree 100% with
your article, "Going Gung-Ho" (by Lynn Smith, March 30), that the
public really needs to see this graphic display to really understand
what horrors our veterans have seen.</LD>
<LD>   It is no wonder that thousands of veterans are mentally disturbed
after living through that kind of hell. Most of us, thank goodness,
will never experience it, yet we need it to place the proper emphasis
on the role of a strong military to maintain the freedoms which we
now enjoy.</LD>

<TE>   Lynn Smith, in her article noting the recent releases of war films
and comparisons to earlier ones, did not include mention of the
superb production "Go Tell the Spartans," script by Wendell Mayes, in
1978. It was as gung-ho as the films she cited, although with fewer
barrels of flaming gasoline and no spurts of tomato sauce from entry
wounds to create unrealistic combat effects.</TE>
<TE>   The film, starring Burt Lancaster, told of an advisory group in a
single combat incident in the early post-Kennedy period in Vietnam,
prior to President Johnson's decision to wage all-out war. It
received strong favorable reviews but was criticized by some because
it indicted the war and its planners.</TE>

<LD>Now that the Philharmonic's Schoenberg Prism is completed ("Oh, So
Close to Being Transfigured," by Mark Swed, March 26), I could not
help but compare it to the Philharmonic's Stravinsky Festival in
trying to sum up both seminal composers of the 20th century who lived
here for many years.</LD>
<LD>   Stravinsky in Los Angeles was more like the bright sun and bright
lights of the city, and, like Hollywood, attracted a great deal of
celebrity. He does have a star on the Walk of Fame at Hollywood and
Wilcox.</LD>
<LD>   Schoenberg, on the other hand, was more like a large-magnitude
earthquake. When it strikes, it seizes everyone's attention, it
wreaks havoc with the existing order and its repercussions are felt
for a long time afterward.</LD>

<HD>Between Lines Troupe Makes Daring Return</HD>
<DH>Winifred Harris' company returns at Highways with two
provocative premieres that are true to the choreographer's vision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the abundance of major dance performances in town this week,
choreographer Winifred R. Harris, speaking to the audience at
Highways Performance Space on Thursday night, graciously thanked them
for choosing to support her troupe, the Los Angeles-based Between
Lines.</LD>
<LD>   And why not? Harris, an eloquent, passionate artist with a
singular vision, and her company hadn't been seen for the last year.
But she's back--along with six dynamic dancers, including four
newcomers, and two provocative premieres.</LD>
<LD>   The first of those premieres, "Things Under and Above," explored
the notion of human responsibilities. Set to the gentle African
musical sounds of Oumon Sangare, Youson N'dour, Baaba Maal and
Anjelique Kidjo, the 20-minute work embraced an old-fashioned Cecil
B. DeMille epic sensibility: Linda Broughs' neo-harem costumes (with
jaunty head coverings and diaphanous veils) adorned the troupe's six
women as they moved fluidly from pure balletic leaps to Martha
Graham-like sculptural posings.</LD>
<TE>   The exquisite veteran, Myshia Moten (a company member since 1996),
set the tone with a supple back-bending solo to greet the day. Lilian
Chow followed suit with an athletically infused, energetic entrance,
after which Emily Jackson, Shannon Harris, Laura Laser and the
seasoned Philein Wang twirled in unison, all brandishing poles as if
fording a stream.</TE>
<TE>   Harris' attention to detail is rigorous--the splaying of fingers,
the bending of an elbow, the precise pointing of a toe--and her
dancers are fiercely determined in their executions. Moten can
deliver a limbo-esque shimmy; Laser, wearing her heart on well-toned
arms, is a mass of pulsating emotions. Indeed, Laser is fearless,
whether pushing an arabesque to the limit, reveling in the joy of
pure movement or appearing wide-eyed with angst. The work, which
traverses terrain from elegant to gnarly, feral to winsome, is also a
treatise on dance as dreamscape.</TE>
<TE>   The evening's other premiere, "Suite Contemplations," finds Harris
in a more cerebral mode, focusing on the decision-making process.
Making use of an odd pastiche of music (a melancholy cello riff,
Enya, the Vienna Boys Choir and Sarah Brightman singing a bizarre
rendition of Albinoni's Adagio), this suite of five dances features
solo and group works, interspersed with Harris' taped ruminations.
"At what point do you stop fighting?" "Decision, direction,
determination ... "</TE>
<TE>   In the wrong hands, this didacticism could backfire. Happily, the
only nod to literalism here is the constant motif of thumb-twiddling,
which Harris elevates to a mini art form. A quartet (Harris, Jackson,
Chow and Laser) sallies forth with a new age-y minuet, expanding into
backward somersaulting; Moten regales with a barrage of bare-footed
flamenco-like steps and crisp plies in her solo; a trio rocks gently
in silence. Showy yet simple, the suite comes alive with unfettered,
seamlessly flowing technique.</TE>
<TE>   Cris Capp's lighting enhanced the evening, as previously reviewed
works completed a program that marked the return of a fine dance
maker.</TE>

<LD>   Oprah Scaling Back Book Club Segment</LD>
<LD>   Oprah Winfrey, whose monthly book club feature has been a boon to
the publishing world and to reading nationwide, announced on her show
Friday that she's scaling back the segment.</LD>
<TE>   "It has become harder and harder to find books on a monthly basis
that I feel absolutely compelled to share," Winfrey said in a
statement. "I will continue featuring books on the 'Oprah Winfrey
Show' when I feel they merit my heartfelt recommendation."</TE>
<TE>   The last monthly selection, revealed on Friday's show, is Toni
Morrison's "Sula." The book, published in 1974, is the fourth by
Morrison to be singled out by Winfrey.</TE>

<TE>   ABC Cancels New TV-Themed Sitcom</TE>
<TE>   So much for inside Hollywood jokes.</TE>
<TE>   ABC, the real-life struggling television network, has pulled
"Wednesday 9:30 (8:30 Central)," its sitcom about a fictional
struggling TV network, after just two telecasts. "The Job," starring
Denis Leary, will return to the schedule in its place next week.</TE>
<TE>   ABC said the remaining episodes of "Wednesday" will be televised
at a later date.</TE>

<TE>   Crowe May Testify in Extortion Trial</TE>
<TE>   The ever-controversial Russell Crowe may soon be called to give
evidence in an extortion trial getting underway Monday in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Cropper and Malcolm Mercer are accused of trying to
blackmail the Oscar-winning actor, threatening to release a tape to
the media unless Crowe forked over $106,000. The footage, said to
have come from a Sydney nightclub's surveillance camera, purportedly
shows the actor and others in a brawl outside the venue in November
1999. Crowe, who wasn't charged in the incident, owns a ranch about
280 miles north of the city.</TE>
<TE>   The duo--along with another defendant, Mark Potts--are also
charged with perverting the course of justice by not giving the tape
to police. Prosecutors have not revealed how they got hold of the
video.</TE>
<TE>   Blackmail carries a maximum 10-year sentence in New South Wales
province, and perverting the course of justice a maximum of 14 years.</TE>

<TE>   R.E.M.'s Buck Acquitted of Air Rage Charges</TE>
<TE>   R.E.M.'s Peter Buck was acquitted Friday of all charges that he
misbehaved on a transatlantic flight last April. The singer had been
heading to a South Africa Freedom Day Concert, where he was due to
perform with his band.</TE>
<TE>   According to MTV.com, an Isleworth Crown Court in London found the
guitarist not guilty of assault, being drunk on an aircraft and
damaging meal-service items. At the trial, the prosecution accused
him of drinking 15 glasses of wine, getting stuck between seats,
dumping yogurt on himself and a crew member, tearing up a warning
from the captain, and choking a flight attendant with a necktie.</TE>
<TE>   Bandmate Michael Stipe and U2's Bono were character witnesses,
testifying in Buck's defense.</TE>

<TE>   After Hip-Hop Musical, Dre Will Avoid the Mic</TE>
<TE>   Convinced that he needs to explore new turf, rapper-producer Dr.
Dre has decided to make his third album, "Detox," a hip-hop musical.</TE>
<TE>   The project, which he expects to start recording this summer and
release a year later, will be his final outing in front of the
microphone, the singer told MTV.com.</TE>
<TE>   The story line chronicles the life of a hit man and his family,
something different but still "hard-core," the singer said.</TE>
<TE>   "What I decided to do was make my album one story about one person
and just do the record through a character's eyes," Dre said.</TE>
<TE>   The rapper also plans to hang up his hat on the movie front, where
he's taken on roles in "Training Day" and "The Wash."</TE>
<TE>   "I had fun doing it, but acting really isn't my thing," he said.
"I am more of a production-director type. I would rather be behind
the scenes and organizing and putting things together like that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Now that a lawsuit with producer Scott Rudin has been settled,
"Gold," the Stephen Sondheim-John Weidman musical is set to open at
Chicago's Goodman Theater in June 2003, the New York Times reports.
The theater is also planning the world premiere of August Wilson's
"Gem of the Ocean" next April.... New Line Cinema's "The Lord of the
Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" has passed the $800-million mark
worldwide and moved ahead of "Independence Day" as the
fifth-highest-grossing film of all time.... The NBC medical drama
"ER" drew an estimated 28.5 million viewers on Thursday, its
second-largest audience of the year.... According to Variety, CBS is
gathering the cast of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" for a one-hour
reunion show to air next month.... HBO is suspending production of
"Sex and the City" on Wednesday so it can reevaluate the show's
production schedule in light of Sarah Jessica Parker's pregnancy. The
new season, originally due to debut in June, is now tentatively
scheduled for July.... Director Martin Scorsese will join Will Smith,
James Gandolfini, Angelina Jolie and Renee Zellweger in the voice
cast of DreamWorks Pictures' animated "Sharkslayer." He'll play
Sykes, a puffer fish.... The Maze show scheduled at the Greek Theatre
on May 18 will now take place on May 17. Tickets will go on sale
Monday, as planned.... Julio Iglesias, Carlos Santana, Dizzy
Gillespie and Astrud Giberto are among those being inducted into the
International Latin Music Hall of Fame in New York Wednesday ....
Stevie Wonder will be honored with a lifetime achievement award at
the Songwriter Hall of Fame Awards on June 13 in New York. Ashford &amp;
Simpson, Barry Manilow, Michael Jackson, Randy Newman and Sting are
among the inductees.</TE>

<HD>Bursts of Fiery Energy</HD>
<DH>The National Ballet of Spain is alternately ragged and
revelatory in the opening program of its glitch-delayed U.S. tour.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day later than planned, National Ballet of Spain launched a
six-performance engagement, and a three-city U.S. tour, at the
Wilshire Theatre on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   According to Malaica Valiente of NYK Productions, the tour
presenter, the delay was a matter of quality control: There simply
wasn't enough tech time to adequately prepare the six-part program,
including two world premieres, for the original Wednesday opening.</LD>
<LD>   As previously reported, mismatches between Spanish and American
equipment didn't help. However, lighting glitches in the first
section of "Concierto de Aranjuez" on Thursday and sound imbalances
throughout the evening suggested that further adjustments are in
order.</LD>
<TE>   The dancing, too, had its lapses, with artistic director Elvira
Andres continually testing not only the company's flamenco prowess
but its mastery of Spanish classical dance. Performed to live music,
the flamenco pieces reveled in percussive intensity even when some
ensembles grew fleetingly ragged. The classical rep, however,
featured taped accompaniments and often looked inescapably bland.</TE>
<TE>   The courtly final sequence for eight couples in Pilar Lopez's
artful 1952 "Concierto de Aranjuez" made the strongest case for this
traditional idiom. Fusing a sense of majesty with complex,
effervescent heel-and-toe step combinations, the dancers wore their
heritage proudly, linked to Franco-Russian ballet in matters of
placement and certain steps, but distinctively supple and airy.</TE>
<TE>   In the playful first section and in Victoria Eugenia's charming "A
Mi Aire" solo, Kira Gimeno proved well schooled in the use of fan and
castanets, just as Mayte Bajo deftly wielded a mantilla and
skillfully ornamented the score with castanets in the romantic
"Aranjuez" second section.</TE>
<TE>   But both these principals gave one-note performances compared with
their deep, mercurial dancing in "Mujeres," Andres' superb tribute to
Spanish womanhood.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in stifled, Lorca-esque alienation, this plotless,
atmospheric and adroitly structured quintet used moody recorded music
by Emilio de Diego and Victor M. Martin to support statements about
female resilience, companionship and maturity.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast Esther Jurado expanded a spitfire solo to forest-fire
scale in one section of Antonio Canales' exciting flamenco suite
"Grito." Volcanic in her shoulder and hip action, she remained a
mesmerizing force of nature even when just walking.</TE>
<TE>   It took three men to match her power, but in Mariano Bernal,
Christian Lozano and Jesus Cordoba the company fielded artists who
could dance in synchronization at any speed yet maintain the
indomitable individuality flamenco embodies.</TE>
<TE>   Cordoba also shared the spotlight with Jose Merino in one of the
evening's premieres: "Estampio," reconstructed by Pacita Tomas and
Joaquin Villa from a vintage flamenco showpiece by Juan Sanchez. As
adapted by Andres, it may be overly symmetrical, with five men led by
Cordoba relentlessly mirroring five men led by Merino. However, as in
"Grito," don't underestimate the thrill of watching a corps dance at
a technical level that only principals command in other companies.</TE>
<TE>   And in "Entreverao (Farruca)," the other premiere, don't
underestimate the ability of a star to make everything and everyone
else on the program seem an anticlimax. Francisco Velasco shares this
flamenco solo with another dancer during the engagement, but his
Thursday performance set an imposing standard of bravura technique,
dramatic weight and an unpredictable ferocity.</TE>
<TE>   Choreographed by Manuel Santiago Maya "Manolete," to music by Jose
Luis Monton, it alternated sensual and even delicate stretches and
gestural detail with sudden, full out step-assaults, passages of
rapid-fire heel work and sudden-death terminations, often ornamented
with air turns.</TE>
<TE>   Velasco danced it with so much arrogance that you almost wanted
him to fail. Not a chance. This wasn't just a performance, but a
challenge--to every self-infatuated new-style flamenco star who likes
to take off his shirt, shake his hair and pose provocatively but who
can't eat the dust of dancing like this.</TE>

<HD>Lindberg Pinch-Hits for Kirchner in Phil's Lineup</HD>
<DH>Leon Kirchner's violin concerto wasn't ready, so Esa-Pekka
Salonen programmed two works by his friend Magnus Lindberg. Good
choice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Magnus Lindberg's "Parada" begins with a slow parade of chords. They
are somber but colorful. They move with solemn grace, like ghostly
visions floating through a fog. And when you have resonant chords
like these--complex and new, yet somehow familiar-sounding, cloaked
in beautiful sonorities, awash in mystery--you have a pretty good
sense that something special is about to follow in their wake.</LD>
<LD>   That chordal parade opened the Los Angeles Philharmonic program
Thursday night by a fluke. This evening at the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion was to have been a wave goodbye to Schoenberg. The orchestra
had commissioned a new violin concerto from Leon Kirchner--who was a
Schoenberg student in Los Angeles--as a nod to the composer's legacy
in the aftermath of the "Schoenberg Prism" festival it concluded two
weeks ago. But the 83-year-old Kirchner has not yet finished the
concerto, so Esa-Pekka Salonen, fresh from having led a festival of
Lindberg's music in London (and touring it through Europe), turned to
his Finnish colleague and close friend instead.</LD>
<LD>   Kirchner's concerto (which the Philharmonic promises will be
performed when completed) may turn out to be a pinnacle in an
important American composer's career. But "Parada," premiered in
England in February and dedicated to Salonen, proved to be exactly
the right piece for the moment.</LD>
<TE>   As an emerging composer in the early 1980s, Lindberg started out
in a musical environment in which the last vestiges of Schoenberg's
influence had led to music of resolutely complex mathematical
organization. But rather than see this as a dead end, Lindberg forged
a style that uses the mechanics of music and the physics of sound to
create works of astonishing physicality.</TE>
<TE>   "Parada," for instance, seems to define and defy gravity. Salonen
in his helpful remarks to the audience likened the new 12-minute
piece to a river. The chord progression expands and contracts,
continually changes perspective, can be warm or cold, fast or slow,
smooth or bumpy, but it is always there, flowing along. And the
listener bobs along like a cork, sometimes weightless, sometimes
knocked around, thrown into rocks. It is a weighty slow movement,
with lots of fast things happening on the surface and distant hints
of Sibelius.</TE>
<TE>   This little bit of "Related Rocks," as the London Lindberg
festival was called, in Los Angeles also included the 43-year-old
composer's Cello Concerto, which the Philharmonic performed at the
Ojai Festival three years ago. It was written for Anssi Karttunen,
another close friend of Salonen and Lindberg, and he was again the
soloist here.</TE>
<TE>   The concerto, somewhat revised last year, also plays around with
gravity and anti-gravity. On the most basic level, it is music that
seems humanly impossible to play, and it can be enjoyed for the
simple amazement of watching the cellist, one of the world's great
players, skate through contorted figurations with elegant ease.</TE>
<TE>   But the concerto is also a magnificent coming-of-age drama. At
first, the hyperactive, stuttering, chattering cello acts like a
young teenager, full of mischief. As it tries to define itself, its
every gesture is a different and elaborate breakout attempt that gets
stuck on the same few pitches. Slowly, it develops a voice and
personality, as it keeps getting submerged in the orchestra and
finding new ways of asserting itself. The cadenza, which Karttunen
improvised brilliantly, is its bursting onto the scene, and the music
that follows is beautiful, long-limbed, assured, powerful, the voice
of liberation.</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra in the Lindberg pieces, conducted with complete
authority by Salonen, sounded its proudest, and even the acoustically
dull Chandler came to life, as it did not for the two Brahms pieces
also on the program. Still, in the Serenade No. 2 in A and the
"Haydn" Variations, Salonen gave the fast movements an exhilarating
bounce. But balances were not always smooth, and the winds in
particular retained a forceful roughness, more Lindberg than Brahms.</TE>
<TE>   The Serenade, for small orchestra without violins, did, however,
offer one unusual acoustical pleasure. For once, the violas, so often
inaudible from my seats in the Chandler, were given prominence, and
the section, like Lindberg's cello, happily exulted in their moment
of sonic liberation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lindberg/Brahms program repeats tonight at 8 and Sunday at 1
p.m., Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 135 N. Grand Ave. $12-$78, (323)
850-2000.</TE>

<HD>'FolkScene' and Larmans Return to KPFK</HD>
<DH>Radio: The popular husband-and-wife team, archivists of
folk and roots music who left after a dispute with the station, will
be back Sunday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON MATSUMOTO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 17 months in "exile," Roz and Howard Larman are finally
returning home Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   Home in this case is public radio station KPFK-FM (90.7), where
the husband-and-wife radio team hosted a folk- and roots-oriented
music program for more than 30 years. During their long tenure, the
Larmans became an institution in the local folk underground as they
helped expose music and artists usually ignored by commercial radio.</LD>
<LD>   The duo's lengthy relationship with the North Hollywood station
was severed in October 2000 due to a dispute with management. Station
officials claimed the issue was commercial use of material recorded
in or with KPFK facilities. The Larmans insisted it was over
ownership of "FolkScene's" content.</LD>
<TE>   Recently, control of KPFK changed hands, which prompted the
Larmans to approach interim general manager Steven Starr about
reviving "FolkScene" at the station. It will return to its old time
slot on Sundays between 7 and 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing the Larmans back to KPFK "is an indication of our respect
for folk music and our great desire to have the premier proponents of
that on the radio," says Starr. "They are legends in this field.
Their show has been a stopping-off point for just about every single
name in folk music in the last 30 years. They are the folk music
radio equivalent of the Grand Ole Opry."</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be very strange going back to KPFK to do the show,"
says Roz Larman. "I'll try not to cry on the air. I can lose it
pretty easily. There are a lot of listeners out there who have
supported us. Someone said to us that after you've been gone a year,
people forget about you. They didn't. People were always asking us
when we were coming back."</TE>
<TE>   Even though they were never paid to host "FolkScene" and will
continue to be unpaid volunteers upon their return, the Larmans
poured their hearts into the program. When Howard Larman's technician
job with Pacific Bell was moved to Concord, Calif., and Roz's
position as a credit card arbitration consultant was shifted to San
Diego, the couple chose early retirement in the mid-'90s rather than
leave their radio show and the local folk community.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Folk Scene' Has Been Heard on the Internet</TE>
<TE>   The Larmans took "FolkScene" to the Internet several months after
leaving KPFK in 2000. There are three different Internet versions of
the program, which can all be accessed through www.folkscene.com. The
Internet programs, produced at the Larmans' West Hills home, will
continue to exist as separate entities.</TE>
<TE>   Live guest performances have been a trademark of "FolkScene" since
it began in 1970, but when the program found a home on the Internet,
the Larmans began to prerecord these studio performances. They'll
continue with that practice on the new KPFK show (featuring Loudon
Wainwright III this week).</TE>
<TE>   "When we brought in guests to KPFK on Sunday nights, we lost
opportunities to get a lot of artists involved [because of scheduling
conflicts]," Roz Larman explains. "We have much greater flexibility
by recording it whenever we choose. That's why we're going to
continue to [do these segments] outside of the station."</TE>
<TE>   The Larmans have released three "FolkScene" CDs, featuring these
studio performances. As a condition for returning to KPFK, Roz Larman
says the couple signed a contract stipulating that 25% of revenues
from future CDs be allocated to KPFK. In addition, the station's logo
will be included in the CD packaging. She says a quarter of the
profits from previous "Folk- Scene" CDs had gone to KPFK; the only
difference is that the arrangement is now solidified in writing.</TE>
<TE>   After the Larmans left KPFK, Mary Katherine Aldin was brought in
to keep folk music alive during the suddenly vacant 7 to 10 p.m. time
slot on Sunday. She expresses no regret at turning it back to them
now.</TE>
<TE>   "I always understood that I was to be a caretaker until the
difficulties between 'FolkScene' and KPFK were resolved," says Aldin,
a veteran musicologist who has written books and album liner notes in
the folk and blues genres. "It just ended up taking a lot longer than
either the Larmans, the station or I thought would be possible."</TE>

<HD>How Close to the Truth Is His Spoof?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HARRY SHEARER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the wackiest things about making motion pictures that fall
into the wide categorization of "spoofs" is that you often end up
doing the very thing you're making fun of. My colleagues and I in
"Spinal Tap" felt this way when we started touring as, pardon the
expression, an "actual" band. Running into jive promoters and weird
hangers-on backstage, having frustrating sound checks and bounced
paychecks, we would think, "Didn't we already do this movie?"</LD>
<LD>   Similarly, in writing and directing my new independent comedy,
"Teddy Bears' Picnic" (which opened Friday), I was making fun of the
possible exposure of a deep, somewhat dark, secret. In promoting the
picture, I'm helping to expose that secret. The clandestine knowledge
is of a hidden society of movers and shakers, a summertime retreat of
the richest and most powerful white men in our country. It sounds
like a delightful conceit, except that such a secret retreat has
existed for more than a century, about 450 miles north of where
you're sitting right now.</LD>
<TE>   San Franciscans have always--how it pains me to write this!--been
ahead of the rest of us in their awareness of Bohemian Grove. They'd
have to be; the headquarters of the club that sponsors that annual
retreat in redwood country is right in the heart of what they still
insist on calling The City. When a couple of producers came to me
asking if I'd be interested in doing a project about a fictionalized
version of the Grove, my brain contained nothing more than the
factoid most known to non-Northern Californians--isn't that the place
where Kissinger and those guys walk around naked and urinate on
redwood trees?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, as it turns out, it is. Not only Kissinger, but most, if not
all, Republican presidents, heads of major corporations and
universities and a sprinkling of the least Jewish of show folk have
long availed themselves of the Grove's rustically lavish hospitality.
The first thing that lured me into the project was the essential
absurdity of the scene. Here you have grown men, awash in wealth and
power, spending a precious week away from the burdens of care and
commerce, and what's their choice in leisure activities? The
aforementioned irrigation project, along with drinking prodigious
amounts of alcohol and putting on amateur theatricals with many
members in drag.</TE>
<TE>   In short, a regression to the world of the college sophomore,
conducted on an unlimited budget. But there's a subtext to the
adolescent frivolity. Although the real retreat's motto is similar to
the one in my movie, "Have no care, ye who enter here," the
encampment features a few high-minded talks on subjects of
import--sort of a lakeside "Nightline."</TE>
<TE>   And, given the kind of folks who are both members and invited
guests, protesters and conspiracy theorists have insisted for years
that the world is being micro-managed from the lodges and cabins
along the Russian River.</TE>
<TE>   So, even though this fact is well hidden for much of the movie, I
ended up making a political comedy. A senator from Rhode Island
(played by Fred Willard) proposes that "we take the handcuffs off the
nuclear power industry." An Air Force lieutenant general (George
Wendt) sees no limit to the use of force to protect the retreat's
privacy. An industrialist (Kenneth Mars) lobbies the senator for a
tax break for firing workers.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to make a real political comedy in Hollywood. Well, it's
hard to do anything in Hollywood; bringing "Dude, Where's My Car?" to
the screen was probably a wrenching struggle. But the mainstream
entertainment moguls insist that the main characters in their
comedies learn Lessons About Life by the sixth reel.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, politicians along with most of the people I see around
me (as well as in the mirror) refuse to learn lessons about life, or
much else. That's one of the things that makes us humans funny:
Though we've got all the physical equipment to engage in continuous
learning, we'd just rather do something easier, like memorize
baseball stats. People who are as obtuse and self-absorbed at the end
of a story as at the beginning (or even just people who know what
"obtuse" means) are verboten in mainstream comedies.</TE>
<TE>   But it's also hard to make a political comedy, as opposed to a
political satire. In my mind, the latter work often involves the
assigning of "good guys" and "bad guys" labels, based on ideology,
and the audience is expected to root rather than laugh. In a
political comedy, the following assumption is made: These people are
behaving no differently than the way you and I would, if we were
exposed to the same privileges and temptations. You can't turn that
premise into a theme-park ride.</TE>
<TE>   Political pictures (such as "Primary Colors" or "Wag the Dog") of
any genre tend to have a shelf life only slightly longer than that of
fresh shellfish. It's well-nigh impossible to know, with script in
hand, when your finished film will hit the multiplex, let alone what
state of mind the audience may be in by that time. So, although
modern big-budget movies tend to throw around topical pop-cultural
references in an attempt at bargain-basement Letterman-ism, one does
tend to scrub real politics out of film stories in favor of a
blander, more generic variety.</TE>
<TE>   I tried to finesse my way around this problem. There are no
real-life politicos depicted in "Picnic." Kurtwood Smith plays what
was, before 9/11 at least, the most anonymous of Cabinet members, the
secretary of transportation. There's a reference to Gerald Ford not
being invited as a guest for the Final Frolics, inserted only
because, despite a lot of searching, no celebrity look-alike firm had
a Gerald Ford double on their roster ("If you'd called 10 years ago
... " one representative offered helpfully).</TE>
<TE>   But, as I say, the place depicted in the movie is amusingly, or
scarily, close to the real thing. I'm exposing the secret by making
fun of their reaction to the possible exposure of the secret. How
will the real movers and shakers react? I predict that they will
neither move nor shake, since publicity will only bring more
attention to the Cremation of Care and other interesting ceremonies.
My bet is that, this time at least, I won't have to walk a mile in
the shoes of my own spoof.</TE>

<HD>'Andy Dick Show' Returns to MTV</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the Mel Brooks film "The Producers," a get-rich-quick scheme
hinges on developing a Broadway play so awful that it closes on
opening night.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the seemingly success-proof musical "Springtime for
Hitler" is the smash hit of the season.</LD>
<LD>   "The Andy Dick Show," which returns to MTV tonight at 9:30 for
what is billed as its "third cycle," has "Springtime" written all
over it. Train wrecks of this magnitude don't happen by accident. Do
they?</LD>
<TE>   The jaw-dropping half-hour of edgy-to-a-fault comedy takes
guerrilla TV to places actor Tom Green couldn't see with a telescope.
Green even appears as a guest tonight in a sketch in which he and
Dick attempt to trade identities for a meeting with an MTV executive.</TE>
<TE>   The exec isn't fooled and asks why Dick is at the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing more episodes," Dick explains.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow.... Why?" the exec asks earnestly. "I mean, speaking as a
fan, why?"</TE>
<TE>   The answer may be that the subversively savvy Dick knows exactly
what he's doing here, and the comedian is clearly reveling at the
chance to push the envelope so violently at every turn that it's
ultimately ripped into confetti.</TE>
<TE>   Actor Jack Black also appears tonight in his Tenacious D
incarnation, and future guests include actor-writer Luke Wilson and
musicians Dave Grohl and Master P.</TE>
<TE>   It's dark, it's crude, it's borderline lewd. Would anyone expect
anything less of Andy Dick?</TE>

<HD>Alcoa Posts 1st-Quarter Profit as It Trims Costs</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Net income falls 46% from a year earlier as weak
global demand for aluminum keeps prices low.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alcoa Inc., the world's No. 1 aluminum producer, said Friday that it
returned to profitability in its first quarter, although earnings
fell 46% from a year ago as weak global demand for aluminum kept
prices low.</LD>
<LD>   The Pittsburgh-based company, which reported its first quarterly
loss in eight years in its fourth quarter, posted net income of $218
million, or 26 cents a share. It earned $404 million, or 46 cents a
share, in the first quarter last year.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue fell 19% to $4.98 billion. Sales have declined for three
quarters in a row. Alcoa shares closed up $1.12 to $38 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   Although the company reported a profit, Alcoa warned that business
would remain challenging over the coming months.</TE>
<TE>   "Alcoa is a wonderfully virtuous company producing a commodity
that there is just too much of," said John Tumazos, an analyst at
Prudential Securities. His comments came just a day after he cut his
earning estimates for Alcoa because of signs of low demand and prices
in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Aluminum users are beginning to stockpile inventories to meet a
projected improvement in the global economy during the second half of
2002, but analysts are uncertain whether long-term demand growth is
sustainable.</TE>
<TE>   To combat the low prices and slow economy, Alcoa has gone on a
cost-cutting spree. It said by the end of the quarter it had cut
annual costs by $436 million and predicted it would reach its target
of $1 billion in cost savings by 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Alcoa's first-quarter results included a one-time net gain of $34
million, or 4 cents a share, related to the adoption of new
accounting standards. Excluding the accounting change, Alcoa said it
would have earned 22 cents, matching the average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>

<HD>Andersen, U.S. Meet to Resolve Criminal Charge</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Sides talk at audit firm's request in increased
effort to reach a pretrial settlement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU, WALTER HAMILTON and JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After weeks of heated rhetoric between the two warring sides, the
Justice Department and accounting firm Andersen's top attorney met
Friday in a stepped-up effort to resolve a criminal indictment that
has thrown the firm's future into jeopardy.</LD>
<LD>   The meeting, the first between Justice and Andersen lawyers since
the accounting firm was indicted on a charge of obstruction of
justice March 14, signaled the possibility of a settlement even
though sources said no deal is expected imminently.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen "requested the meeting, and we said, 'OK, we'll hear you
out,'" said a Justice Department official who asked not to be
identified.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen was represented by its top defense lawyer, Houston-based
Rusty Hardin, who did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen, indicted for shredding documents related to its audit of
Enron Corp., also is working to settle claims with Enron shareholders
who lost billions of dollars in the company's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, the accounting firm has broached the idea of
paying $300 million to Enron shareholders who sued Andersen for its
role in auditing Enron's books, sources said. About $250 million
would come from Andersen's insurance carrier, and $50 million would
be funded out of Andersen's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed payment is less than half the $750 million that
Andersen offered several months ago. The amount has been slashed as
doubts have grown about Andersen's ability to stay in business.</TE>
<TE>   However, there are several stumbling blocks in reaching a deal,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs worry that an accord with Andersen could limit
their ability to collect large sums from other potential legal
targets, such as investment banks and law firms, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   If Andersen paid only a fraction of shareholders' losses,
deep-pocketed banks and law firms that worked for Enron could argue
that they should not have to pay more than Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   "You lessen what you can threaten the other defendants with," said
one attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The University of California Board of Regents, the lead plaintiff
in a class-action lawsuit against Andersen and Enron's senior
management, is expected Monday to name additional defendants,
including several big investment banks.</TE>
<TE>   Some shareholders also say a settlement at this point could
prevent them from securing a larger amount if Andersen settles its
criminal indictment and improves its chances of staying in business.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the shareholders fear that Andersen might not make
good on the portion to be paid by the insurance carrier. Andersen's
insurer failed to pay $217 million to settle claims arising from the
firm's audit of the Baptist Foundation of Arizona. The insurer said
it could not make the payment because Andersen had missed a
$100-million premium payment.</TE>
<TE>   "There are serious issues with respect to Andersen's insurance,"
one lawyer said. "You saw what happened with the Baptist case."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has called the criminal charge a "death penalty" for the
firm and has mounted an aggressive public relations campaign in its
defense.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department fired back in a court filing last week,
calling Andersen's attack "another in a series of efforts [by
Andersen] to manipulate the pace and timing of the government's
investiga- tion."</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities have maintained for weeks that they are open
to a settlement, so long as the accounting firm meets certain
conditions, including meaningful reforms, cooperation in the Enron
investigation and full acceptance of responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Justice Department has been unwilling to say exactly
what steps Andersen would have to take to meet those criteria, a
representative said Friday that even after the day's meeting between
opposing lawyers, "our position has not changed."</TE>
<TE>   Such meetings between federal prosecutors and criminal defendants
are not unusual, particularly in complex white-collar crime cases,
but legal observers said it could signal that the sides are
increasingly willing to reach a compromise before a May 6 trial.</TE>
<TE>   "I think both sides are thinking of meeting in the center," said
Columbia Law School professor and legal commentator John C. Coffee, a
securities specialist.</TE>
<TE>   Coffee said he thinks the most likely ending in the case will be a
"deferred prosecution," meaning that Andersen would not have to plead
guilty to any criminal charges but would essentially be put on
probation for a number of years with certain restrictions placed on
its conduct. If it meets those conditions, the charges then would be
dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   "The great advantage for Arthur Andersen is that because this is a
deferral and not a conviction, this would not trigger the automatic
disbarment rule" before the Securities and Exchange Commission or
states in which Andersen does business, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For the Justice Department, such a deal would allow it to avoid
going to trial, while at the same time enable it to use Andersen's
admission of responsibility against the firm should Andersen violate
the terms of its probation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Paul Fishman, a former Justice Department prosecutor who now
specializes in white-collar defense, said he doubts the two sides
will be able to work out a deal.</TE>
<TE>   After getting an indictment from a federal grand jury, the Justice
Department may not want to look like it is backing down and risk
sending the wrong message to future corporate defendants, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen wants the criminal charges thrown out, "and the
department has a lot of leverage as to what conditions they could
exact," he said. These could include the imposition of a government
auditor--a more severe step than the rescue plan offered by former
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker--as well as substantial
civil fines and Andersen's commitment to waive attorney-client
privilege and turn over all the information it has in the Enron case,
Fishman said.</TE>
<TE>   Such restrictions could prove onerous for Anderson, Fishman said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still skeptical the department would be willing to do it for
anything less than a fabulous package, but it's possible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In its effort to restructure, Andersen has an agreement to sell
about 50% of its tax practice to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, though
both parties say details still are to be worked out. And it is
unclear how Deloitte can structure the transaction to avoid becoming
a target of Enron investors and employees who are pursuing claims
against Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen also has signed a memorandum to sell some of its business
in the Pacific Northwest to KPMG.</TE>
<TE>   Both accounting firms declined to comment on the KPMG deal, but a
source familiar with the discussions said Andersen's client erosion
in the Pacific Northwest has been heavier than in other regions. The
sale of offices in the region would give partners a chance to
transfer to a new company but to continue to work for their former
clients in some cases, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Other groups of Andersen partners are pursuing different deals
within the United States, a process that is threatening to splinter
the firm and endanger the efforts by Volcker to keep Andersen in
business.</TE>
<TE>   However, many Andersen tax partners, especially those in the tax
practice who believed they would be free to join Deloitte &amp; Touche or
craft their own deals, were frustrated by the recent moves of several
insurers who are plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuits to block any
deals.</TE>
<TE>   Galveston-based American National Insurance Co., and several other
insurers will go to federal court in Houston Monday asking U.S.
District Judge Melinda Harmon to issue a temporary injunction to
prohibit Andersen from selling assets or transferring them to foreign
subsidiaries or affiliates.</TE>
<TE>   The insurers fear these series of transactions will dissipate
Andersen's assets without putting money in a pot to pay claims
resulting from its work for Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney's involved in the class action lawsuits plan to filed an
amended and consolidated complaint in Harmon's court Monday. This new
complaint will expand the case to include other parties who did work
for Enron, including J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., Citigroup's Salomon
Smith Barney and Credit Suisse First Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman for J.P. Morgan and CSFB refused comment. A Salomon
spokesman could not be reached on Friday.</TE>

<HD>Home Prices Drive Buyers to Adjustable-Rate Loans</HD>
<DH>Mortgages: Percentage of borrowers in the Southland using
ARMs is edging up as housing affordability drops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gains in U.S. home prices have spurred consumers to opt for
adjustable-rate mortgage loans, traditionally a popular loan product
in a high-interest-rate environment, at a time when borrowing costs
are near historic lows.</LD>
<LD>   Adjustable-rate mortgage loans, or ARMs, have allowed home buyers
to qualify for larger loans. This ability to buy a house for what
initially is a lower monthly mortgage rate has helped boost home
sales and prop up an economy smarting from the slowdown.</LD>
<LD>   "Rapidly increasing home prices are driving people to
adjustable-rate mortgages for an initially lower monthly payment,"
said David Beadle, a Milford, Mass.-based mortgage lender.</LD>
<TE>   In Southern California, the percentage of borrowers using
adjustable-rate mortgages has edged up over the last year, but
remains far below record-high levels.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, more than 22% of home buyers used
adjustable mortgages, and 24% in Orange County in February, the most
recent data available from DataQuick Information Systems Inc. The
peak, in the mid-60% range, came during 1994 in both counties.</TE>
<TE>   In the Southland, "we're starting to see more of a trend toward
adjustable-rate loans," said Lenny McNeill, a regional sales manager
for lender Washington Mutual Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowers "can qualify for more house because they qualify for a
lower interest rate," said Vijay Lala, who heads product support at
Countrywide Home Loans, a unit of Calabasas-based Countrywide Credit
Industries Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "They do help people afford housing better. It can help you get
into your first home," said Stephen LaDue, president of Affiliated
Mortgage &amp; Financial Corp., a Wauwatosa, Wis.-based lender. "It helps
some people who are marginal borrowers get more house for their
loan."</TE>
<TE>   Mortgage rates for ARMs are initially lower than for their
fixed-rate counterparts. When a borrower gets an ARM, he or she will
pay a lower monthly mortgage rate for a set period.</TE>
<TE>   After this period, the loan rate floats with an extra
margin--usually 2.75%--over a benchmark borrowing rate used by banks
and lenders such as Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate.</TE>
<TE>   After the initial three-to-five-year period, borrowing costs rise
annually because rates on these adjustable loans ratchet above the
loans' benchmark rate. In a rising-rate environment, that means
borrowing costs could rise every year until reaching a preset cap
such as 12%.</TE>
<TE>   In a declining-interest-rate environment, rates for consumers with
ARM loans could fall. But loan agreements often limit the drop in
mortgage rates in such an environment.</TE>
<TE>   For a home buyer looking to borrow $100,000, the monthly cost
associated with a 30-year fixed-rate loan on which a borrower pays
two points at 6.75% is $648.60.</TE>
<TE>   If someone opts for a one-year ARM with 2% of the loan amount paid
upfront to get a 5.50% monthly rate, the monthly cost would total
$567.79.</TE>
<TE>   The cost savings become more meaningful when the loan amounts
increase, as they have recently because of gains in home prices.</TE>
<TE>   This is particularly true in California, where housing
affordability is dropping as home prices climb. Only 31% of the
state's residents can afford a median-price home, which costs
$267,000 in Los Angeles County. Nationwide, the rate is 57%.</TE>
<TE>   Bond traders expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates later this
year. With the economy expected to be sluggish in the near term,
short-term Treasury rates are low.</TE>
<TE>   But long-term rates have risen on expectations the Fed will
eventually raise rates and the U.S. economy will pick up steam.</TE>
<TE>   "Short-term rates have not moved much. Fixed-rate mortgages have
jumped, while ARMs haven't moved much. Therefore ARMs look
attractive," said Beadle, the Massachusetts mortgage lender.</TE>
<TE>   Weighing these short- and long-term borrowing costs becomes more
important when one considers that home buyers are more peripatetic
than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a mobile society. We constantly move. The majority of
30-year loans are paid off by five years or seven years," said
Affiliated Mortgage's LaDue.</TE>
<TE>   "The ARM loan is a better deal to get a lower interest rate. I do
that analysis every day for customers."</TE>

<HD>CalPERS Will Invest in Vineyards</HD>
<DH>Pensions: Fund will spend $100 million to develop
properties with Premier Pacific, then sell them to wine producers.</DH>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Public Employees' Retirement System will invest $100
million to develop vineyards in California, Oregon and Washington
with closely held Premier Pacific Vineyards Inc., the companies said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The investment, part of CalPERS' $13.3-billion real estate
portfolio, is the largest U.S. pension fund's first investment in
agriculture.</LD>
<LD>   The joint venture will acquire land, plant, harvest and sell
grapes, then sell the developed parcels to wine producers within five
to seven years.</LD>
<TE>   CalPERS and Napa, Calif.-based Premier Pacific said they plan to
invest 80% of the joint venture's capital in California and the
remainder in Washington and Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "The principals of PPV are experienced developers of vineyards
with a successful history of selling to notable wine producers," said
Michael McCook, CalPERS' senior investment officer and head of real
estate investment.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS will provide 90% of the capital for the venture, with 10%
from Premier Pacific. CalPERS said it expects to earn a 15%
annualized return on the investment.</TE>
<TE>   Premier Pacific was founded by William Hill and Richard Wollack in
1998 to develop vineyards with institutional investors. The company
said it owns a 72-acre Cabernet vineyard in Napa, a 200-acre Pinot
Noir vineyard in Oregon and a 100-acre parcel in Mendocino, Calif.,
that's slated for the development of Merlot vineyards.</TE>

<HD>Self-Serve Cosmetics Stores Outshining Counters</HD>
<DH>Retail: Free-standing makeup meccas are booming--and
threatening a bedrock of department stores.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The department store saleswoman with a trigger finger on the perfume
bottle may be a dying breed.</LD>
<LD>   Cosmetics sellers, like businesses including toys to sporting
goods to casual clothes, have moved to homes of their own.</LD>
<LD>   Specialty cosmetics stores--including Estee Lauder Cos.' Origins,
M.A.C. and Aveda--have boomed in recent years, threatening one of the
bedrocks of department stores, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   Shoppers in a heightened pursuit for miracle anti-wrinkle creams
and lipsticks are more than willing to trade big-store cosmetics
counters for the self-service makeup meccas, which offer more choices
without the insistent sales pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "They are encroaching upon one of the more profitable segments of
department stores," said Jeff Stinson, an analyst for Midwest
Research.</TE>
<TE>   The free-standing format, seen as an alternative to department
stores where cosmetics are kept under lock and key, has mushroomed to
about a $4-billion business from $800 million in 1991 and is the
fastest-growing area in cosmetics retailing, according to Market
View, which tracks the U.S. cosmetics industry.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers such as Federated Department Stores, May Department
Stores Co. and Saks Inc. count on cosmetics for 10% to 15% of their
annual sales, and a slightly higher percentage of profits, Stinson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts resisted blaming lackluster department store results on
cosmetics stores over the last year--soft apparel sales have dragged
heaviest on results--but they didn't discount the stores' role
either.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly not a benefit for department store foot traffic as
specialty stores pop up throughout North America," said Banc of
America Securities analyst Bill Steele.</TE>
<TE>   Cosmetics are displayed at the front of department store entrances
for a reason, he said. Pricey skin creams--a 1 oz. bottle of Estee
Lauder's Resilience Lift sells for $45--carry high profit margins and
consumers use them quickly and come back for more.</TE>
<TE>   But as shoppers continue flocking to stores such as Sephora, a
400-store chain that is owned by French luxury giant LVMH, it forces
department stores to come up with other ways to drive foot traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big issue for retailers to grapple with," Steele said.</TE>
<TE>   Christina Horvath-Simonits, a self-described cosmetics buff who
lives in New York, said she often chooses Sephora over a nearby Saks
Fifth Avenue if she is looking for funky colors and private-label
products it sells for less than similar department store goods.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with department stores is the hard sell for [certain]
products and the attitude from counter people," she said. "I've had
the experience that I was overlooked for 10 minutes so that older,
more well-off clients perhaps, could be attended to first," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At stores like Sephora, she said, "No one tries to sell you
anything. You can try on colors as long as you like with no hassle."</TE>
<TE>   More retailers are taking such sentiments seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, women's clothing retailer Limited Inc. announced a
joint venture with Japan's leading cosmetics firm, Shiseido Co., to
launch the beauty chain Aura Science.</TE>
<TE>   The first Aura Science store will open next week in Columbus,
Ohio, and it plans on adding nine more stores in major U.S. cities
this year, the companies said.</TE>
<TE>   "It all adds up," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail
Trend Report, commenting on free-standing cosmetics retailers' role
in the strained results of department stores, particularly over the
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Specialty cosmetics stores are thriving at their expense," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the specialty stores tend to attract a younger
clientele, who seek out a hipper, edgier array of goods.</TE>

<HD>Two CSFB Bankers Were on Board of Enron Partnership</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Wall Street firm CS First Boston, a unit of Swiss bank Credit Suisse
Group Inc., said Friday that two of its bankers were directors of one
of the complex off-balance-sheet vehicles energy trader Enron Corp.
used before its collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Enron allegedly used thousands of these intricate, special-purpose
vehicles to shift debt off its balance sheet, mask growing losses and
artificially inflate profits. The energy trader filed for bankruptcy
protection in December.</LD>
<LD>   The bankers sat on the board of the entity, Atlantic Water Trust,
for a short period of time at Enron's request and in keeping with
their fiduciary responsibility, a fact that was fully disclosed to
investors and in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, a CS First Boston spokeswoman in New York said.</LD>
<TE>   The Wall Street Journal first reported the story Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Major Wall Street firms are under fire for services they provided
to Enron, such as lending it money, helping it with mergers and
acquisition deals and touting its shares to investors. In their
defense, Enron was one of the biggest companies in the United States
before its bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   The bankers, Laurence Nath and Dominic Capolongo, joined the
Atlantic Water Trust board around November 2000 and left it 10 months
later, a source familiar with the matter said.</TE>
<TE>   Atlantic Water was part of a complex web of Enron entities
involving water companies. It was jointly owned by Enron and another
vehicle called Marlin, which owned British water company Wessex
Water, originally purchased by Enron.</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Loses Contract</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The multiyear, $450-million defense deal, which
was pulled back amid protests, is awarded to WorldCom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Troubled Global Crossing Ltd. on Friday lost a prestigious and
valuable defense contract initially awarded to the company last year
and then pulled back for further review amid protests from
competitors.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, the Defense Department instead awarded the contract to
WorldCom Inc. The multiyear contract is worth up to $450 million and
calls for WorldCom to provide critical communications and data
network services to the agency.</LD>
<LD>   Losing the contract adds to the mounting woes at Global Crossing,
which filed for bankruptcy protection in January and has been
fighting to hold on to customers ever since.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Global Crossing renegotiated and scaled back
its showcase contract with SWIFT, a cooperative venture that provides
data links to 7,000 financial institutions in 196 countries.
Executives at the Bermuda-based telecommunications company had often
cited the SWIFT contract as proof that Global Crossing's network
could provide reliable services on a worldwide scale.</TE>
<TE>   In recent interviews, Global Crossing Chief Executive John Legere
has said the company's customers were standing by the firm and that
there had been fewer defectors than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Global Crossing could not be reached for comment on
the defense contract that until Friday had been one of the firm's
hardest-fought victories.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Global Crossing announced that it had won the contract
and that it would provide $137 million in services to the Defense
Department over three years and up to $400 million in services over
the life of the contract.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Research and Engineering Network project was to
provide vital links to more than 6,000 scientists and engineers in
far-flung defense facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Company insiders say Global Crossing executives were so thrilled
with the win that they planned a lavish party to celebrate. The plans
were hastily dropped, though, "because some people thought it was not
appropriate to have a party before the contract was signed,"
according to a person familiar with the plans.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, the defense agency decided to rebid the job, a
decision that sent Global Crossing's stock plummeting. Company
executives tried to calm investors, saying the agency just wanted to
"address procedural issues" related to the procurement process.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the losing bidders, thought at the time to be AT&amp;T Corp.,
Sprint Corp. and WorldCom, had protested Global Crossing's win. And
some critics implied that Global Crossing had lobbied its way into
the job by employing such heavyweights as former Defense Secretary
William S. Cohen, who had become a board member.</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials were stung by accusations that they chose Global
Crossing for political reasons. But they had good reason to look
elsewhere after the company filed for bankruptcy protection and its
potential buyers' list included companies with ties to the Chinese
government.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Friday, New York and Ohio state pension funds revealed
that they each hope to become the lead plaintiff in shareholder
lawsuits filed against Global Crossing in the wake of its financial
meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   New York's $110-billion fund lost more than $75 million through
investments in the company. Two Ohio funds have said they lost a
combined $115 million. Typically, as judges seek to consolidate many
shareholder suits, they select a "lead plaintiff" to choose attorneys
and direct the case. Often, judges pick the plaintiff with the
largest financial stake.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American Golf Corp., the largest manager of golf course properties
which defaulted on its debt, said co-Chief Executive Joe Guerra is
leaving the company.</LD>
<LD>   Guerra, a 15-year veteran, is leaving "to pursue other interests,"
the Santa Monica company said in a memo to employees, a copy of which
was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   David Pillsbury, the other co-chief executive, is staying, the
company said.</LD>
<TE>   The departure comes after closely held American Golf had an
operating loss of $58.8 million in 2001, contrasted with income of
$3.21 million in 2000, leading the company to default on its debt.
American Golf blamed bad weather, a slowing economy and a glut of new
courses for the decline in its business.</TE>

<HD>Overture Files Suit Against Google</HD>
<DH>Internet: Search-engine company says rival's recently
launched service infringes its patent on paid listings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Overture Services Inc. sued Google Inc., claiming the rival Internet
search engine stole its patented method for letting businesses pay to
have their Web sites listed in the results of queries.</LD>
<LD>   Pasadena-based Overture said Google was aware of its patent when
it introduced a similar system this year.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, is similar
to a complaint Overture brought against another search engine,
FindWhat.com, in January and asks the court to stop Google from using
the technology. It seeks unspecified damages.</LD>
<TE>   "Google is directly infringing, inducing infringement by others
and contributorily infringing one or more of the claims" of the
patent, the three-page complaint says.</TE>
<TE>   Overture lets businesses pay to have their Web sites prominently
listed in the results of search queries. Google announced in February
that it would offer a similar service, sending Overture's shares down
9.6% on concern it would lose customers. Overtures shares fell 88
cents on Friday to $26.82.</TE>
<TE>   Closely held Google was the sixth-most popular Web site in the
U.S. in February, according to a report by Comscore Networks.</TE>
<TE>   Overture, previously called GoTo.com, ranked 43rd for the month.
Overture has agreements to feature its search engine on AOL Time
Warner Inc.'s America Online and Microsoft Corp.'s MSN Internet
access services.</TE>
<TE>   Overture's shares fell 41% on Feb. 6 after EarthLink Inc. said it
ended an agreement to use Overture's search engine in favor of
Google. Google's investors include Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers
and Sequoia Capital.</TE>

<HD>A Weapon That Will Turn Heads</HD>
<DH>Defense: Helmets that allow pilots to aim their missiles
simply by looking at targets could revolutionize combat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE</DL>
<LD>F-16 fighter jet pilots testing a futuristic weapon system are
discovering that looks can indeed kill.</LD>
<LD>   Test pilots here are flying with sophisticated helmets, resembling
a bug's eye, that allow them to aim their weapons and sensors simply
by looking at potential targets on the ground or in the air.</LD>
<LD>   The helmets, when coupled with a highly maneuverable new missile
that is close to deployment, would enable fighter pilots to look over
their shoulders and fire instantly at targets, a feat that until now
has been matched only in science fiction movies.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to revolutionize close-in dogfights," said Lt. Col.
Troy Fontaine, operational officer for the 416th Flight Test
Squadron, which recently began flying the helmets on F-16 fighter
jets. "It'll give us air superiority because we'll be able to see
first and shoot first."</TE>
<TE>   Despite significant advances in combat aircraft, the way fighter
pilots have engaged their targets has changed little since the birth
of air combat using biplanes during World War I. Though missiles have
replaced machine guns, the basics of a dogfight have not changed: A
pilot must find the enemy, turn the plane toward it and fire before
flying away.</TE>
<TE>   With the new system, success in combat may no longer depend on how
well pilots can maneuver their aircraft but on how fast they can turn
their heads.</TE>
<TE>   The headgear, formally the Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System,
recently completed initial tests on F-15 and F-18 fighters. More
tests are planned for the F-16 before deployment in about three
years, Air Force officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon envisions buying as many as 2,000 helmets, and an
advanced system already is under development for the F-22 and the
F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the next generation of fighter jets.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing Co.'s military aircraft and missiles unit in St. Louis is
the prime contractor for the helmet system, but much of the
development was done by San Jose-based Vision Systems International,
a joint venture of defense electronics maker Rockwell Collins Inc.
and an Israeli firm, Elbit. The helmets will be manufactured by
Vision Systems International.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has spent about $100million to develop the helmets
and expects to spend about $672million to acquire 1,880 of them,
along with accessories and modification kits to integrate the
headgear into the various fighter jets. The helmet itself will cost
about $190,000 when full production begins, Pentagon officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Helmet-mounted display visors are not new. In the 1970s, F-4
Phantom pilots used headgear with a visual target acquisition system,
which transferred information from the cockpit to the visor. But such
rudimentary systems still required the plane to be oriented toward a
target.</TE>
<TE>   The latest system, which has been in development for more than a
decade, uses a magnetic device to track head movement to determine
where the pilot is looking and then projects information about the
target to the pilot's visor.</TE>
<TE>   Though seemingly simple, the technology represents a breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   A pilot wearing the helmet can look out the side of the cockpit,
spot an enemy plane and then lock the missile's guidance system on
the target before launching the weapon--all within a few seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The coordinates of the target are transmitted instantly to the
missile, which upon launch uses its own infrared and optic sensors to
make the kill.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the targeting information that the pilot sees is displayed
on the right side of the visor as small green-tinted circles, squares
and numbers. When a target is in the display's bull's-eye, the pilot
pushes a button to launch the missile.</TE>
<TE>   But the ability to see and mark a target at extreme angles, known
as high off-bore sighting, is only as effective as the
maneuverability of the missile, defense officials say. And the
Pentagon has been developing a generation of missiles that can make
sharp turns with very small radiuses.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. had decided not to develop a simple helmet-mounted
display a decade ago when the Soviet Union did, precisely because
there were no weapons that could take full advantage of the system.</TE>
<TE>   The AIM-9X missile, under development by Raytheon Co. in Tucson,
is designed with a sophisticated rocket engine that can change
directions using its thrusters, making it the most maneuverable
missile to date. Information about how sharply and quickly it can
turn is classified.</TE>
<TE>   Last year the Pentagon awarded Raytheon an 18-year contract valued
at $3 billion to produce more than 10,000 missiles for both the Navy
and the Air Force. Full production is expected to begin next year.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Jason Clemens, an F-16 pilot who used the helmet for the
first time recently, says he also foresees the system dramatically
improving air-to-ground attacks. A pilot using the helmet, he notes,
would be able to mark a target on the ground for either a laser or a
satellite-guided bomb.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of having to turn my [plane's] nose, I can visually make
out the target and drop a bomb, just like that," Clemens said. "I can
be quicker and more precise."</TE>
<TE>   Pilots in the test program also appreciate that the technology has
the advantage of giving them the ability to see crucial aircraft
information on their helmets--such as speed, altitude and
attitude--so they don't have to look down at the cockpit instruments
during an intense dogfight or bombing mission.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives us a lot more situational awareness," said Capt. L.
Najeeb Ahmed, chief flight test engineer for the F-16. "We can keep
our eyes on the enemy."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest challenge is not technological, pilots and engineers
say, but retraining the pilots to understand they don't necessarily
have to maneuver their planes into position for attack.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, pilots may no longer have to use their hands to explain how
they yanked and banked to get behind an enemy plane before shooting
it down, a tactic that has changed little in more than 80 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It literally changes the rules of engagement," said Bill West,
Raytheon's development director for air-to-air missile programs.
"It's going to take some time for pilots to realize they are going to
fight differently."</TE>

<HD>Payrolls Show 1st Gain Since July</HD>
<DH>Economy: Employers created 58,000 jobs in March, but
jobless rate still rose to 5.7%. Analysts say data suggest a slow
recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For the first time in nearly a year, U.S. employers created more jobs
last month than they cut, but it was not enough to keep the
unemployment rate from rising slightly, the Labor Department reported
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The number of payroll jobs increased by 58,000 in March. It was
the first increase since the summer and another sign that the economy
is beginning to bounce back slowly from the recession that began in
March 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The jobless rate moved in the other direction, rising to 5.7% in
March from 5.5% in February. But it remained below the 5.8% peak
reached in December after the Sept. 11 attacks aborted what appeared
to be a tentative recovery.</LD>
<TE>   "What you're seeing is kind of classic. The labor market is
lagging the business cycle, which is very normal as the economy
emerges from recession," said Jay Feldman, an economist with Credit
Suisse First Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Government statisticians attributed the divergence between the job
creation and unemployment figures to different survey methodologies
and other technical factors. The unemployment rate, for example,
includes agricultural, household and self-employed workers who are
left out of the payroll head count. If a self-employed person takes a
newly created factory job, payroll employment goes up, but the
unemployment rate is unaffected.</TE>
<TE>   The important thing, analysts said, is that the March figures
suggest the economy may have stopped hemorrhaging jobs after 12
months of contraction that reduced private-sector payrolls by 1.8
million.</TE>
<TE>   Still, last month's turnaround does not constitute a rollicking
recovery. For that reason, analysts said, the Federal Reserve seems
increasingly unlikely to raise interest rates until later this year.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of a slow-paced recovery caused bond prices to rise
and yields to fall in Friday trading. Stock prices ended mixed, with
the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
posting small gains and the Nasdaq composite index falling.</TE>
<TE>   UBS Warburg chief economist Maury Harris said the pace of job
creation last month was only about one-third of what would be
required to stabilize the unemployment rate.</TE>
<TE>   The jobless rate probably will remain within a narrow range for
several months, moving "up and down a little bit, but not down enough
to get you Fed tightening before the election," Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   "This may not be a jobless recovery, but it's going to be a low
job-formation recovery," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It is not unusual for the unemployment rate to continue rising for
several months after a recovery begins.</TE>
<TE>   Employers tend to respond to initial signs of improvement by
making their existing employees work longer hours and often delay
hiring people until they have solid evidence the rebound is real.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the average manufacturing workweek increased to 41.1
hours from 40.7 hours in February, while factory overtime rose to 4.2
hours from 3.9. The average wages of private-sector production
workers went up 4 cents to $14.67 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Many economists predict that the jobless rate may rise as high as
6% in coming months before businesses begin bringing on new workers
to satisfy increased demand for their products.</TE>
<TE>   Government analysts characterized last month's uptick in
unemployment as relatively insignificant, noting that the jobless
rate has remained within two-tenths of a percentage point of 5.6%
since October.</TE>
<TE>   But for some categories of workers, joblessness is an increasing
problem. The unemployment rate for African Americans jumped to 10.7%
in March from 9.6% the previous month. Among African American teens,
the jobless rate was 31%, up from 27.9%.</TE>
<TE>   Latino unemployment rose to 7.3% from 7.1%, while the rate for
whites edged up to 5% from 4.9%.</TE>
<TE>   Much of last month's job growth was in the government sector,
which added 37,000 employees. Of those, 27,000 were local school
employees.</TE>
<TE>   Total private-sector employment increased by 21,000 for the month.</TE>
<TE>   Employment in service industries jumped by 118,000, the biggest
monthly gain since the fall of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Temporary-help services added 69,000 people, health services
32,000, and engineering and management services 12,000.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers continued to shrink their work forces, eliminating
38,000 payroll slots after paring 54,000 the previous month. But the
job cutting has slowed sharply. Last year, factory employment fell by
an average of 111,000 per month.</TE>
<TE>   Electronic equipment makers cut 10,000 people in March, and
industrial machinery manufacturers trimmed 7,000, much smaller
reductions than in previous months. Small increases were reported by
firms that make products from stone, clay, glass, primary metals,
rubber and plastics.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers of transportation equipment eliminated 12,000 jobs.
Of those, 9,000 were in the aircraft industry. The number of
construction jobs fell by 37,000, while mining employment dropped by
14,000.</TE>

<HD>Technology Stocks Slump, but Blue Chips Hold Higher Ground</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Major indexes are down for the week. Bond yields
drop after jobs report. Oil prices fall for a third day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An upbeat outlook from 3M and lower stock prices brought tentative
buyers to Wall Street on Friday and gave blue chips a moderate boost.
But investors again traded cautiously in the tech sector, sending
shares down on a rumor of a profit warning from IBM.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow closed up 36.47 points, or 0.4%, at 10,271.64. Friday was
the Dow's second straight winning day following a four-session,
228-point losing streak. However, the Dow closed down 1.3% for the
week--the average's third consecutive weekly decline.</LD>
<LD>   The market's broader indexes finished both Friday and the week
lower. The tech-dominated Nasdaq composite index fell 19.72 points,
or 1.1%, to 1,770.03, ending the week with a loss of 4.1%. The Nasdaq
has fallen four weeks in a row and eight of the last 10.</LD>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index declined 3.61 points, or 0.3%, to
1,122.73. For the week, the S&amp;P fell 2.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Volume continued to be unusually light, with the New York Stock
Exchange having one of its slowest days of the year. Winners
outnumbered losers by 3 to 2 on the Big Board. On Nasdaq, six stocks
fell for every five that rose.</TE>
<TE>   There was no profit warning from IBM after the market closed,
although the company announced an unspecified number of layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Also Salomon Smith Barney downgraded shares of IBM on a technical
basis Friday afternoon because the stock price slipped below $100.</TE>
<TE>   IBM's sharp decline--it lost $3.59 to $97.25--illustrated
investors' jitters over the health of corporate earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Investors' nervousness increased as tensions rose in the Mideast,
sparking fears of higher oil prices that would threaten the economic
recovery. Prudential Securities analyst Larry Wachtel suspected
Mideast worries were the biggest factor in Friday's session.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, it is a defensive day ahead of a weekend when anything
can happen in the Middle East," Wachtel said.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow's biggest gainer was 3M, which soared $7.81 to $121.93
after saying its first-quarter profit will beat analysts'
expectations. Also, Salomon Smith Barney and Credit Suisse First
Boston each raised their ratings on 3M.</TE>
<TE>   The beleaguered technology sector, pegged by analysts to be the
last to eventually emerge from recession, declined again. Other tech
losers included Microsoft, down 58 cents at $55.87, and Intel, which
declined 54 cents to $30.05.</TE>
<TE>   A mildly disappointing jobless report had little effect on the
session.</TE>
<TE>   Bond yields fell for a fourth day as the jobs report dampened
fears of an imminent Federal Reserve rate hike. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 5.21% from 5.26% on Thursday.
It closed at 5.43% on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights Friday:</TE>
<TE>   * Oil prices fell for a third day as President Bush sought an
Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian-controlled territory. Crude for
May delivery fell 37 cents to $26.21 a barrel in New York--although
it recovered from an earlier decline of $1.53 a barrel. There is
mounting skepticism that Middle East oil producers will be able to
organize an embargo as a show of support for the Palestinians in
their fight against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   * Oil stocks retreated in lock step with the pullback in oil
prices. The Philadelphia oil services index fell 1%, reflecting
losses by firms such as Schlumberger, off $1.65 to $54.39. ExxonMobil
lost 52 cents to $42.63 and Phillips Petroleum fell $1.21 to $60.64.</TE>
<TE>   * Adelphia Communications Corp. rose 42 cents to $10.42 on news it
has hired banks to advise on possible asset sales to help pay down
debt.* Enterasys Networks fell $2.80, or 68%, to $1.34 after three
top executives resigned because sales have plunged in the last two
quarters.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a major push to help low- and moderate-income families buy homes,
CitiMortgage Inc., in partnership with Fannie Mae, will provide $1
billion in flexible mortgage products for qualified buyers in Los
Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties over the next five years, the
lending giants said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Targeting new immigrants, minorities and other underserved
households, Fannie Mae, the nation's largest source of financing for
home mortgages, and CitiMortgage, a unit of Citigroup Inc., will
provide the funding through partnerships with a network of local
realty boards, municipalities and other housing entities.</LD>
<LD>   "With a strong partner like CitiMortgage at the table, [Fannie
Mae] can push the lending envelope, allowing a more credit-challenged
borrower to the table," said Barbara Zeidman, Fannie Mae's director
of the Los Angeles Partnership office.</LD>
<TE>   Under the new program, Fannie Mae has committed to purchase all of
the eligible affordable mortgage loans that CitiMortgage originates
in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowers with past credit difficulties may qualify for loans with
down payments as low as $500.</TE>
<TE>   Working, nonpermanent resident immigrants may use income from
boarders or part-time employment to qualify for a loan.
Nontraditional sources of credit also are allowed under the program's
guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the bank's neighborhood outreach program, CitiMortgage
opened a new loan center in Montebello in November, where lending
consultants speak both Spanish and English.</TE>

<HD>6 Women Win Suit Against Employer Ralphs</HD>
<DH>Courts: The plaintiffs' attorney says the $30.6-million
jury verdict is the largest in a sexual harassment case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury in Vista, Calif., awarded $30.6 million Friday to six women
who alleged they had been subjected to sexual harassment in their
jobs at several San Diego County Ralphs supermarkets, lawyers said.</LD>
<LD>   The women accused the store chain of engaging in a cover-up of
offensive and violent behavior by a store director by transferring
his accusers out of the stores where he worked, said Philip Kay, a
San Francisco attorney who represented the women.</LD>
<LD>   Kay said the jury verdict is the largest in the nation in a sexual
harassment case.</LD>
<TE>   "The message [jurors] sent was corporations have to exhibit
responsibility," Kay said. "This type of absolutely vile conduct that
was covered up should never be tolerated by anybody or any
corporation."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Ralphs Grocery Co. could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The six women--four cashiers, one bookkeeper and one bakery
department manager--were awarded $5 million each in punitive damages,
plus a total of $550,000 for pain and suffering. They also may seek
to have Ralphs pay their attorney fees.</TE>
<TE>   The women, four of whom still work for Ralphs, alleged a Ralphs
store director berated them with misogynistic slurs and threw
shopping carts, 40-pound mailbags and telephones at them, a pattern
of harassment that began in 1985, Kay said.</TE>
<TE>   Ralphs was accused of helping to cover up the actions of the store
director, who worked in several locations, because he was good at
boosting sales, Kay said. The store director resigned two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The trial was the second in the case. The first trial four years
ago resulted in a $3.8-million verdict that was thrown out because of
jury misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Two other women, a current and a former employee, have similar
sexual harassment lawsuits pending against Ralphs in Los Angeles,
said Jason Oliver, their lawyer. That case is scheduled to go to
trial in May.</TE>
<TE>   Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America Inc. settled a sexual
harassment suit in 1998 for $34 million, a record out-of-court
adjudication of such a case.</TE>
<TE>   Ralphs operates more than 450 stores under Ralphs, Food4Less and
other brands from its headquarters in Los Angeles. The company is a
unit of Cincinnati-based Kroger Co., the nation's largest supermarket
operator. Kroger acquired Ralphs in 1999 when it purchased Fred Meyer
Inc. Fred Meyer had acquired Ralphs just a year before.</TE>

<HD>Xoma, Genentech Say Psoriasis Drug Delayed</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Xoma Ltd. and Genentech Inc. fell after the biotechnology
partners said their experimental psoriasis drug Xanelim will be
delayed.</LD>
<LD>   An application for U.S. regulatory approval of Xanelim will be
held up because a study failed to prove the companies could make
consistent batches of the drug, Xoma and Genentech said. The partners
previously had expected approval next year.</LD>
<LD>   The setback leaves Xoma and Genentech behind Biogen Inc., which
filed an application for a competing drug, Amevive, in August. Biogen
has said it expects to win approval this year, gaining an edge in the
estimated $2-billion market to treat psoriasis, a chronic skin
condition. Approval of Xanelim, which would be Xoma's first product,
may not happen until 2004.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Berkeley-based Xoma, which is relying on Xanelim to
generate its first profits, fell $3.21, or 42%, to $4.42 on Nasdaq.
Genentech shares fell $4.29, or 8.8%, to $44.70 on the NYSE.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The man who masterminded the theft of $24 million in winning
McDonald's game tickets pleaded guilty and was ordered to repay at
least $13.4 million.</LD>
<LD>   Jerome Jacobson, 59, of Lawrenceville, Ga., could get up to 15
years in prison for conspiracy and mail fraud. No sentencing date was
set.</LD>
<LD>   He was among 51 people indicted in the scam that went undetected
for a dozen years and involved McDonald's games such as Monopoly and
Who Wants to be a Millionaire? No McDonald's employees were involved.</LD>
<TE>   Jacobson was director of security for Simon Marketing Inc., which
had been hired by the fast-food chain to run its popular Monopoly
games. Prosecutors said Jacobson stole winning game pieces worth up
to $1 million and distributed them to others, who then redeemed the
prizes.</TE>

<LD>U.S. consumer debt rose in February at the same pace as a month

<LD>   Consumer borrowing rose at 5.1% annual rates in both February and
January compared with an 8.5% pace of increase in the fourth quarter
of last year.</LD>
<LD>   Borrowing through credit cards and other types of loans increased
by $7 billion in February, the Fed said. Credit card debt and other
revolving loans rose by half the pace of a month earlier, while
borrowing for the purchases of automobiles increased at a faster
rate.</LD>
<TE>   Spending on goods other than automobiles slowed in February as
some retailers offered fewer discounts. Auto sales increased as
General Motors Corp. and other car makers offered rebates or
no-interest financing.</TE>

<LD>Tyson Foods Inc. has lost its appetite for some of the specialty

IBP and is shopping those brands to prospective buyers, industry

appetizers, such as frozen meatballs and snacks.</LD>
<LD>   The assets may be worth $100million to $200 million, with annual
revenue of roughly $300 million, but they have not been strong profit
drivers for IBP, the sources said.</LD>

will pay base commissions to North American travel agents on certain
car rentals. The move, which will mostly affect U.S. and Canadian
corporate and government accounts with individually negotiated rate
agreements, comes two days after similar action by Ford Motor Co.'s
Hertz.</LD>
<LD>   * A man fired from Global Crossing was indicted on federal charges
of identity theft and for allegedly posting threats against former
co-workers on the Internet. A grand jury returned a nine-count
indictment against Steven William Sutcliffe, 41. The indictment
alleges Sutcliffe, who worked in the company's Beverly Hills office
for about a month, created a Web site and posted photographs and
threats on it. The four threat charges each carry a maximum penalty
of five years in federal prison. Identity theft carries a maximum
15-year sentence.</LD>
<LD>   * Dell Computer Corp. Chief Financial Officer James Schneider is
urging employees to hold fewer Dell shares in their retirement
accounts, after Enron Corp. workers lost millions when the energy
trader collapsed. About 58%, or $623 million, of the 401(k)
retirement plan for workers at the world's largest personal computer
maker is invested in the Dell Computer Corp. Stock Fund.</LD>

<LD>Local television broadcasters asked a federal appeals court to
reconsider its decision to strike down a regulation barring a company
from owning a television station and a cable system in the same
market.</LD>
<LD>   The National Assn. of Broadcasters challenged a February order by
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that
the Federal Communications Commission must rewrite a rule that limits
companies to reaching 35% of TV homes with their own TV stations.</LD>
<LD>   Companies such as News Corp. and Viacom Inc., each reaching about
39% of TV homes, sued to overturn the cap, arguing it was obsolete
amid choices provided by cable TV and the Internet. Smaller station
groups joined consumer advocates in arguing that keeping the limit
would boost diversity and competition.</LD>

<HD>SEC Says Investment Scam Shut Down</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge issued emergency orders shutting down an $88-million
nationwide investment scam, the Securities and Exchange Commission
said.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC alleged defendants operating from Phoenix, Chicago and
Houston sold several bogus investments, including "prime" bank
investments and certificates of deposit from a bogus Native American
chartered bank.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC said the scam was a classic fraud in which investors are
promised their money will be used to buy and trade "prime bank"
financial instruments that supposedly trade on clandestine overseas
markets to generate huge returns. Neither the instruments nor the
markets on which they allegedly trade exist, the SEC warns on its Web
site.</LD>
<TE>   In this case, the SEC alleged that a bogus bank granted business
charters by the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Rosebud Sioux tribe which
worked with a Houston-based company to sell $78-million bogus
investments, including the prime bank investments and certificates of
deposit in the bank.</TE>

<HD>New World, Reliant and KeySpan in SEC Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New World Restaurant Group Inc., Reliant Resources Inc. and KeySpan
Corp. are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, it was disclosed Friday, and the agency brought charges
against a mutual fund director for allegedly defrauding investors.</LD>
<LD>   The probes are the latest by the SEC since the collapse of Enron
Corp. Most have focused on accounting concerns such as misreported
earnings and hidden debt.</LD>
<LD>   New World, operator of Noah's New York Bagels and Einstein Bros.
stores and franchiser of Manhattan Bagel and Chesapeake Bagel Bakery
stores, said the SEC began an informal investigation into the firing
this week of the company's chief financial officer, the resignation
of its chairman and a delay in filing its annual report.</LD>
<TE>   New Jersey-based New World said it is cooperating with the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   New World's shares were delisted by the Nasdaq Stock Market in
November, which cited shareholder violations and public interest
concerns. Its shares were placed on the OTC's Bulletin Board in
January. New World's shares fell 5 cents to 37 cents Friday. They
have dropped 70% in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   KeySpan, the Northeast's largest natural gas distributor,
disclosed in a regulatory filing that company executives are being
investigated by the SEC for trades they made before Key- Span
disclosed accounting mistakes and a $30-million earnings reduction
last July.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC is reviewing trades by officials such as Chief Financial
Officer Gerald Luterman, according to a proxy filed by a KeySpan
unit. Investigators also are reviewing KeySpan's compliance with
reporting rules after buying a contracting business in 2000. KeySpan
said it is cooperating with the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   KeySpan shares fell 83 cents Friday to $36.27 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant Resources said it is being investigated by the SEC in
connection with the company's restatement of earnings for the second
and third quarters last year. The company said it will cooperate
fully in the informal inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant Resources, 82% owned by Reliant Energy Inc., restated
second- and third-quarter results, adding $134 million to net income
from January to September, the company said. The news was released
after the market closed.</TE>
<TE>   Dreyfus Corp. mutual fund director Martin Fife was charged by the
SEC with participating in a $52-million fraud in which investors were
promised unrealistically high returns on Treasury bills. Fife
couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Siege Can't Halt Life and Death in Ramallah</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Lubna Ramadeen felt the labor pains coming on, and she knew she
couldn't reach the hospital. Israeli tanks ruled the roads, and venturing
out in the middle of the night could prove fatal.</LD>
<LD>   But military siege and necessity breed ingenuity. She telephoned her
obstetrician, and by long-distance he guided the birth of Rania, a
wrinkly red-faced baby girl who on Friday came into a world seized by
war.</LD>
<LD>   With the Israeli occupation of Ramallah entering a second week Friday,
Palestinians are experiencing both life and death under siege. Babies
have been born, some languishing in maternity wards, unable to go home.
People have died, or been killed, their corpses forced to await mass
burial in a hospital parking lot because the trip to a cemetery was
deemed too dangerous.</LD>
<TE>   Food and basic services such as medical care, electricity and water
are in short, spotty supply.</TE>
<TE>   Except for two brief interludes when Israeli forces allowed
Palestinians out of their homes, families have remained hunkered down,
unable to go to work or school, struggling to conserve precious water, to
distract terrified children and to pass the time.</TE>
<TE>   Israel, which says it is trying to stop a wave of suicide bombers, has
occupied every major Palestinian city except one, Jericho, placing an
estimated 1.5 million Palestinians under virtual house arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Every time the Israeli tanks roar down Abeer Bahour's street, day or
night, the house shakes. She braces for the jolt, then for the screams of
her 2-year-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Like many Ramallah families, the Bahours spend long hours watching
television news, when there is electricity, following the events taking
place a few feet or miles outside their doors.</TE>
<TE>   They sleep and play or do homework with the children. Bahour, whose
husband is a prominent Palestinian American businessman, said her
8-year-old daughter has become clingy and afraid to go anywhere in the
house by herself. The 2-year-old is agitated and nervous.</TE>
<TE>   "The electricity comes and goes, and we hardly have any water left,"
she said. "I wash a few dishes, but we're not washing clothes and not
taking baths. We use the water just for drinking and making coffee and
tea. It's too hard to collect rainwater. To tell you the truth, I'm too
scared to go outside to try."</TE>
<TE>   In many parts of the city, electricity has been lost because Israeli
armor slammed through utility poles, smashed transformers and ripped down
power lines. Water is usually supplied by electrical pumps: No
electricity, no water. And in some cases, the water tanks that most
Palestinians have on their roofs have been shot, the water lost.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian engineering crews trying to repair utilities have come
under fire or been chased away by Israeli soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the sheer fright that comes with having tanks, soldiers
and snipers on many a street corner, being confined indefinitely to a
small space takes a psychological toll. People are bored and depressed.
Some Palestinians said they try to read books, but can't. They obsess
over housework or surfing the Internet or mindless tasks.</TE>
<TE>   "There is fear and terror and humiliation, and then you kind of
organize yourself," said Adila Laidi-Hanieh, a politically active
director of a cultural center whose husband edits a Palestinian
newspaper. "We make ourselves busy." It's the only way, she said, to keep
up morale.</TE>
<TE>   Laidi-Hanieh copes by keeping a "siege diary" that she e-mails to
friends and associates the world over.</TE>
<TE>   Medical services have been especially impaired. In Ramallah alone,
Israeli soldiers have invaded hospitals three times, searching patients'
rooms, ransacking medicine cabinets and, at the Red Crescent Maternity
Hospital, rousting new mothers from their beds during a two-hour search
of the premises, doctors and witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were dragged, us and the patients, down into reception,"
anesthesiologist Nadir Aiyesh said, recounting the Thursday raid. "There
were newborn babies--I'm talking 3 hours old. Then they started
searching, centimeter by centimeter, from the fourth floor to the first
floor."</TE>
<TE>   Two doctors, two male nurses and a custodian were handcuffed,
blindfolded and taken away by the troops, Aiyesh said.</TE>
<TE>   The International Committee of the Red Cross announced Friday that it
was reducing its operations in the West Bank to "a strict minimum" after
its staff was threatened at gunpoint in Bethlehem and shot at in Nablus
and Ramallah, and its vehicles were run over by tanks in Tulkarm.
Ambulances have repeatedly been blocked from reaching victims; the
Israeli army says it's afraid the vehicles might be transporting weapons
or fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "This behavior is totally unacceptable, for it jeopardizes not only
the lifesaving work of emergency medical services, but also the ICRC's
humanitarian mission," the Red Cross said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   At government-run Ramallah Hospital, six mothers are sleeping on the
floor of the room where their children have been patients. The children
are well now, but no one can go home.</TE>
<TE>   In the ward for premature babies, head nurse Sabha Rabia says she's
running out of clean diapers and blankets because there is no water to do
the laundry. Masoud Awad, 24 days old, is ready to go home, having
recovered from respiratory weakness at birth. But his parents can't reach
the hospital. "They call every day, asking how he is and saying that as
soon as the road is clear they'll be here," she said. "They cry and cry."</TE>
<TE>   Shawki Harb, one of the region's prominent cardiac surgeons, reads by
old candles and wraps himself in blankets to keep warm. His house has
been without electricity for 48 hours.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not Sarajevo yet," he said, referring to the Bosnian capital
that was besieged by Bosnian Serb forces for years. "I hope it doesn't
get that bad."</TE>
<TE>   The siege initially trapped Harb inside his medical center, the Arab
Care Hospital, which Israeli soldiers raided twice. He said they used him
as a human shield during one operation, when they forced him to lead them
from room to room.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, during one of the brief moments when restrictions were
eased, Harb went home. Now he is unable to return to the hospital, where
delicate operations await him. He telephones instructions and hopes the
staff can follow through.</TE>
<TE>   That's how Salwa Najab manages to deliver babies. She is helping to
train a network of doctors and nurses to coach telephone births. Earlier
this week, she helped a couple deliver their son.</TE>
<TE>   "The husband was terrified and the woman was crying," she said. "I
tried to calm them down and to tell them in the old days all women used
to deliver at home. But it didn't help much."</TE>
<TE>   Ramadeen, the woman who gave birth Friday, was fortunate to have her
65-year-old mother-in-law, Turfa, at her side. Turfa delivered two babies
at home in the first intifada against Israeli rule 13 years ago, and she
took this delivery in stride. She got on the phone with the obstetrician,
dutifully followed instructions to sanitize a pair of scissors, tie the
umbilical cord, clear the baby's air passages.</TE>
<TE>   Lying in the bed where she had given birth, Ramadeen, 23, was clearly
relieved. "I got really scared," she recalled of the moment the labor
pains became intense, around midnight. "The tanks were surrounding us and
there was no way out. I was really worried about the baby."</TE>
<TE>   She gave birth four times before, but always with difficulties. This
birth went smoothly, under the circumstances. Her husband, a truck
driver, wasn't home. He's been arrested before by the Israelis, so now
he's in hiding.</TE>
<TE>   The sound Ramadeen recalls hearing as Rania came into being was the
rumble of the tanks, back and forth.</TE>

<HD>White House Will Leave Job Safety to Employers</HD>
<DH>Workplace: Bush plan urges firms to adopt OSHA guidelines. Sites in
California already are under stricter state rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration announced Friday that it would issue
voluntary guidelines to reduce the risk of repetitive stress injuries on
the job rather than force employers to take corrective action.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, coming after strong lobbying from businesses opposed to
mandatory regulations, will have little effect in California, where
workplaces already are subject to compulsory ergonomic rules. But in most
other states, employers will be encouraged--not required--to protect
workers from such risks as carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis and back
injuries.</LD>
<LD>   Under the new procedures, which reflect the administration's
commitment to voluntary regulation, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration will craft safety guidelines for particular industries and
jobs. It will urge companies to adopt them or devise their own plans.</LD>
<TE>   Labor groups, which have been at odds with businesses over the issue,
criticized the strategy Friday as ineffective in helping workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Today we've got an announcement that contains no enforceable
regulations, relies totally on voluntary actions and does not even
identify the industries that OSHA will focus on," said Peg Seminario,
director of the AFL-CIO's safety and health department. "What it
demonstrates once again is the Bush administration's allegiance to its
corporate supporters and contributors and its disregard for workers."</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials said their approach would provide the
flexibility that employers need to take the right action for their
businesses. "We know one size does not fit all," said John Henshaw,
OSHA's administrator.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration opted not to pursue mandatory regulations,
Henshaw added, because there is "a lot of uncertainty" about the science
of musculoskeletal disorders and what work functions trigger them.</TE>
<TE>   Occupational musculoskeletal disorders can affect muscles, tendons,
joints, nerves and related soft tissues anywhere in the body but most
often in the lower back and arms.</TE>
<TE>   Repeated use of the same muscle or tendon may result in injury or
inflammation. The results have been called cumulative trauma disorder,
repetitive motion injury, repetition strain injury and occupational
overuse syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   These disorders affect a wide array of employees: construction workers
and secretaries, farm workers and meatpackers, postal sorters and
deliverers. They result from a variety of activities, including hand
harvesting, sewing, typing, lifting heaving objects and operating
machinery in factories.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's voluntary approach will replace the mandatory one
adopted by the Clinton administration but overturned by the
Republican-controlled Congress shortly after President Bush took office
last year.</TE>
<TE>   The workplace rules will test the administration's claim that
voluntary regulation works best in a wide range of arenas.</TE>
<TE>   For example, rather than regulating emissions, Bush's new
global-warming plan asks businesses to reduce emissions of carbon
dioxide, the major greenhouse gas produced from human activity. On
Friday, the administration announced that the Boston Housing Authority
had voluntarily committed to make nearly 700 fully accessible public
housing units available to residents with disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Business groups, which feared the high costs of complying with the
Clinton rules, applauded the Bush administration for giving employers
flexibility to develop their own approaches to curb workplace injuries.</TE>
<TE>   But labor unions blasted the administration for leaving workers
defenseless from injuries that force at least 600,000 of them off the job
each year and cause pain to a million more.</TE>
<TE>   When Congress overturned the Clinton workplace safety regulations last
year, the Bush administration said it would come up with a
substitute--possibly including some mandatory regulations. Bush's father,
former President Bush, promised during his term in office to implement
mandatory regulations, but business groups lobbied so hard against them
that it took until the end of the Clinton administration before any were
adopted.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its new plan to reduce workplace injuries, OSHA, which is
part of the Labor Department, also intends to crack down on employers
that break existing laws regarding workplace hazards. Employers
implementing ergonomic guidelines will not be targeted in these
enforcement efforts, Henshaw said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, California adopted the nation's first ergonomic standards,
which require all employers to evaluate work sites and make sure they do
not present risks of injury. Employers also must train employees and
control their exposure to activities that could cause repetitive motion
injuries. If two workers doing the same task are injured within a
12-month period, state officials inspect the workplace and can issue
citations.</TE>
<TE>   The state already provides information to employers to help them
reduce risks. "But the [federal] guidelines would probably add to the
understanding of what employers must do to prevent injury," said Dean
Fryer, spokesman for California's version of OSHA, the Division of
Occupational Safety and Health.</TE>
<TE>   Even the California program has been criticized by labor groups as too
weak. From 1998 through 2001, the state made only 109 inspections and
issued fines for less than $200,000, according to Fryer.</TE>
<TE>   Maggie Robbins, a health and safety expert with the Hesperian
Foundation in Berkeley and a former consultant with the California Labor
Federation, said she did not expect the federal plan to do much to boost
California's program.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I can see, [the new federal rules] will not have any impact
on the state aside from possibly more information," she said. "And it's
not because we have such a fabulous standard here. We don't."</TE>
<TE>   Businesses whose employees face high risk of musculoskeletal injuries
lobbied hard to defeat the Clinton rules and donated generously,
primarily to Republican candidates and party committees, to make their
point with politicians.</TE>
<TE>   For example, United Parcel Service, which counts ergonomics among its
top issues, was a top donor in the last election cycle, contributing
almost $3 million to candidates and party committees--71% to Republicans,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based
independent watchdog group.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce spent millions on issue ads and gave more
than $514,000 to candidates and party committees during the 2000
campaign--94% to Republicans, according to the group.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.), who has introduced legislation requiring
the Labor Department to make new ergonomic rules, said he would study the
Bush initiative before deciding whether to push that legislation.</TE>
<TE>   But some of his colleagues criticized the Bush plan. Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy (D-Mass.) said it was particularly callous toward women, who
suffer two-thirds of job-related carpal tunnel and tendinitis injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "Once again the administration handed a win to big business at the
expense of millions of average workers--especially women--who risk
workplace injuries every single day," Kennedy said.</TE>

<HD>A Retail Spying Spree</HD>
<DH>Known as mystery shoppers and gaining use, they act like typical
customers. But what they find can bring a worker praise--or dismissal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clad in gray sweats and a warmup jacket, Debbie Palty walks into a
Taco Bell in Costa Mesa. She looks at her watch and makes a mental note
of the long line ahead of her and the debris on the counter--seven straw
wrappers, a couple of loose napkins.</LD>
<LD>   She orders three tacos and a drink, listening for the cashier to
repeat the order. When her food arrives, Palty grabs it and dashes for
her car, where she jabs a thermometer into the tacos. Then she weighs the
food on a digital scale. She checks the freshness of the tomatoes and
finally bangs out a report on a laptop.</LD>
<LD>   "They did pretty good," she says.</LD>
<TE>   Palty is a mystery shopper, and she has never been busier. Her main
clients are fast-food restaurants, but requests are pouring in from
virtually every type of business. Mystery shoppers are checking into
hotels and cruise lines, posing as potential renters at apartments, even
going undercover as patients in doctors' offices.</TE>
<TE>   She is part of an unprecedented boom in the ages-old practice of
snooping on workers. An estimated 500 mystery shopping firms operate
today--a 25% increase from three years ago--and weekly send out as many
as 500,000 freelancers who work as amateur sleuths. Palty earns $10 to
$20 a report, but she had enough volume last year to gross more than
$50,000.</TE>
<TE>   The driving force behind this growth is corporate America's heightened
attention to customer service, which has slipped in recent years amid the
nation's tight labor market, high worker turnover and layoffs of middle
managers, who traditionally have played an important role in overseeing
service.</TE>
<TE>   The problem may be most severe at fast-food counters. Since the
University of Michigan began compiling consumer surveys on service in
1994, fast food has consistently scored the lowest among several
industries. At the bottom of the heap: McDonald's, which this year
launched its systemwide use of undercover shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   Other chains, such as Del Taco and El Pollo Loco, are returning to
mystery shopping after abandoning it years ago because of the cost.</TE>
<TE>   "If you manage a restaurant, after a while you might stop noticing
that cashiers aren't smiling, tiles are missing and napkin and straw
[dispensers] aren't filled," said El Pollo Loco Chief Executive Steve
Carley, who has mandated a monthly inspection of each of the 136
company-owned stores. "That's why you need a fresh pair of eyes."</TE>
<TE>   The Mystery Shopping Providers Assn. in Dallas estimates that 75% of
the 95 biggest fast-food chains use mystery shoppers, up from 45% five
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Palty, 40, is so busy that she frequently turns down work. She keeps a
grueling schedule, working most weekends and routinely putting in 60
hours a week.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent drizzly morning, she left her south Orange County home at
6:30 and over the next 11 hours circled Los Angeles County, visiting 17
restaurants in six cities. Much of the work was the same: ordering,
observing, weighing and taking the temperature of food with electronic
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "Hardly glamorous," she said, digging through a bean burrito with her
fingers to make sure her order for no onions had been met.</TE>
<TE>   But the occasional actress (she once had a small part on the soap
opera "Days of Our Lives") likes the pay--she expects to earn $60,000
this year--and the freedom of being an independent contractor. The work
appears to come naturally to her.</TE>
<TE>   "I love to shop," Palty said.</TE>
<TE>   Palty has an ironclad memory, so she can record details without the
aid of notes. Over the years, her work has become more varied and
high-tech.</TE>
<TE>   One of her most unusual assignments, she said, was posing as a
prospective buyer of a $3.8-million house to tape the sales pitch of the
real estate agent. She used a microphone hidden in her bra. (The agent
did a bang-up job touting the wine cellar, mountain view and large
entertainment room and received a positive review.)</TE>
<TE>   As mystery shopping has proliferated, so has the debate over its use,
which in the United States dates back to the early 1900s, when businesses
first hired undercover customers to watch for employee theft. Ever since
then, workers have complained that the practice puts undue pressure on
them, breeds mistrust and often fails to give an accurate or complete
picture of what's going on.</TE>
<TE>   That's precisely what worries Michael Muntzel, a McDonald's franchisee
in Little Rock, Ark. Earlier this year, he said, the corporate office
sent a mystery shopper to one of his four restaurants during the busy
lunch hour. Because it took so long to fill orders, Muntzel recalls one
of his employees giving that customer a free bag of fries and apologizing
for the delay.</TE>
<TE>   To Muntzel, the worker had turned a negative situation into a positive
one. But to that mystery shopper, the service was slow, the order was
improperly filled, and the worker who gave away free food had violated
company policy. Muntzel said his restaurant received a critical review.
He and some other McDonald's franchise owners worry that the corporation
could use the results of mystery shopping to weed out outlets it doesn't
want.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's officials would not comment on the review of Muntzel's
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Such customer-service reviews are relatively new to the mystery
shopping industry.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Doomanis co-founded Commercial Service Systems in Van Nuys in
1947 to run so-called integrity shops to expose dishonest workers.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, the practice evolved into a management tool to critique
customer service. The term "mystery shopping" came into use then,
reflecting the mysterious nature of the shopper, according to
TrendSource, a San Diego-based mystery shopping firm. Doomanis, 80, said
his business has grown into a $3 million-a-year enterprise. The last few
months have been particularly strong.</TE>
<TE>   Owners such as Doomanis said it's now common for undercover shoppers
to give strong-performing employees small rewards on the spot, such as
$10 gift certificates for groceries or video rentals. Those who receive
low marks are likely to be candidates for more training instead of
dismissal, they contend.</TE>
<TE>   But Kim Wirshing, an attorney for the Hotel and Restaurant Employees
Local 2 in San Francisco, said he still often hears about workers getting
reprimanded after a visit by a mystery shopper. And in the last four
years, he said, at least six have been fired. One of them has stuck in
his mind: a Bay Area hotel bartender who was terminated after being
spotted giving a free drink to a high-paying customer. Wirshing said he
contested the firing to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   "To have someone who knows relatively nothing about an individual
workplace go in and take a cold analysis is a recipe for disaster,"
Wirshing said. "In the real world, there can be innocent explanations for
all sorts of things."</TE>
<TE>   Debate also rages about the effectiveness of mystery shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Gould, director of mystery shopping for Taco Bell, credits the
program for helping speed up the chain's drive-through service. He said
reports from secret shoppers highlighted delays caused by workers pushing
promotions and repeating simple orders to customers. Ultimately, he said,
Taco Bell slashed drive-through wait times from an average of 5 minutes
to 3 1/2 minutes--a huge achievement in an industry obsessed with peeling
seconds off the process.</TE>
<TE>   But others question why mystery shoppers are needed to uncover such
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "If companies want to know what customers want, they should ask them
directly," said Claes Fornell, a University of Michigan marketing
professor and critic of mystery shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Mystery shoppers often don't know how clients will use their reports,
and sometimes the result is surprising.</TE>
<TE>   Palty remembers one visit to a post office in Orange County. In her
report, she wrote that a manager who waited on her inquired about Palty's
religious beliefs and then asked her for a date. She filed a negative
report and thought the manager might be disciplined or even dismissed,
but later found out he was promoted.</TE>
<TE>   "When I walked [back] into the post office, there he was. I couldn't
believe it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   One of Palty's toughest challenges is to maintain her cover. She
figures that only her family and a few other people know what she does
for a living. When people press her about her job, she tells them that
she's a retail consultant. She's left her neighbors guessing and
sometimes gossiping about the life of a single woman who often comes home
with shopping bags full of new clothes.</TE>
<TE>   In her seven years as a mystery shopper, Palty said she's been
unveiled twice. The first was when an employee at a Tustin bistro spotted
her taking notes at the table. (Since then, Palty jots down observations
only after she enters the bathroom or her car.)</TE>
<TE>   On an assignment about six months ago, Palty went into a Huntington
Beach supermarket, where she encountered her brother, who, unbeknownst to
her, had recently been transferred there as store manager.</TE>
<TE>   Palty doesn't see herself as out to nab someone. But like many real
shoppers, she expects good service and has no hesitation to submit a
critical report when it falls short. Palty firmly believes in the value
of mystery shopping, saying it keeps people on their toes.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Schlosser, author of the best-selling book "Fast Food Nation,"
isn't so keen on the practice. He believes that if companies treat
workers well, they'll be more motivated and happy.</TE>
<TE>   "And you don't need to check up on them in this way," Schlosser said.</TE>
<TE>   Many workers in fast food and other industries, however, appear to
have accepted the undercover shoppers as part of the workplace. They know
that they don't have much choice if they want to stay in their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   For the last eight months, Dave &amp; Buster's Inc. restaurants have been
using mystery shoppers to videotape employees at work with digital
cameras hidden in purses, jackets and shirts. Employees must first sign a
waiver allowing the contracting firm, Video Eyes, to do so. Dave &amp;
Buster's said no worker has refused to sign, but the company wouldn't say
what would happen if someone did.</TE>
<TE>   The practice has drawn fire from labor groups and privacy advocates,
even from the industry itself.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very negative," said Laura Livers, president of Atlanta-based
Shop 'N Chek Inc., the nation's largest mystery shopping firm. 'Would you
want to work for a company that puts a camera on you?"</TE>
<TE>   But Video Eyes said it has signed up three major hotel chains and 40
other businesses in its first nine months of operations.</TE>
<TE>   "We like to think of this as the next generation of mystery shopping,"
said Chief Executive Mike Bare.</TE>

<HD>Arafat, U.S. Envoy Meet; Fighting Rages</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Israel allows Zinni into Palestinian leader's compound
for cease-fire talks. Despite Bush's plea, the army steps up its
offensive.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>On a bloody day of fierce fighting, the diplomatic isolation of
Yasser Arafat was broken Friday when the United States' special Mideast
envoy walked past Israeli tanks and into the Palestinian Authority
president's besieged headquarters here.</LD>
<LD>   Despite President Bush's appeal for a halt to the bloodshed, Israel
accelerated its massive offensive in the West Bank, entering yet another
Palestinian town. More than two dozen Palestinians and one Israeli
soldier were killed.</LD>
<LD>   The Palestinian dead, according to Israeli officials, included the
alleged mastermind of last month's Passover suicide bombing that killed
26 people and a top commander of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia
linked to Arafat's Fatah movement. Both killings represent a coup for
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who has been under pressure to
produce results in the 8-day-old campaign.</LD>
<TE>   Here in Ramallah, where tanks and snipers have turned the once
prosperous de facto Palestinian capital into a battered ghost town, U.S.
envoy Anthony C. Zinni met with Arafat for about 90 minutes to discuss
the prospects for a cease-fire ahead of the arrival next week of
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Zinni, flanked by well-armed bodyguards, stepped from his armored car
into the building where Arafat has been confined for more than a week as
Israeli forces chopped away at the compound. Much of the headquarters
lies in ruins, and Arafat has been holed up inside with close aides and
bodyguards.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, who has publicly voiced his desire to see Arafat exiled or
dead, only begrudgingly allowed the visit to take place. The Israeli
government was so opposed to the meeting that it continued to ban
journalists from the area. At close range, Israeli soldiers fired stun
grenades and rubber-coated steel bullets at reporters who were waiting
outside Arafat's compound for Zinni's arrival. One group of soldiers
rammed its jeep into a CNN vehicle, and the journalists were forced to
flee.</TE>
<TE>   An unapologetic government spokesman, Daniel Seaman, later told CNN
that journalists must obey Israel's laws and stay clear of areas that are
declared "military zones." And Sharon's spokesman made it clear that the
government simply doesn't want coverage of Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "Zinni is not going there for a photo op for hugging and kissing like
[with] the European Union, and that is precisely the point," Sharon
spokesman Raanan Gissin said. On Thursday, Israel refused to let an EU
delegation meet with Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials were embarrassed when, in the first days of the
siege on Ramallah, Arafat telephoned countless television stations to
offer interviews and then received a visit from foreign peace activists.
Rather than isolation, he suddenly gained a martyr's status that only a
publicity director could dream of.</TE>
<TE>   In a shift that placed a rare onus on Israel, President Bush on
Thursday demanded that the government end the incursions into Palestinian
cities and towns and begin withdrawing troops. He announced that he was
dispatching Powell to the region next week.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials chose to interpret Bush's statement not as a red
light to cease operations but as a green light to speed up its massive
operation before Powell's arrival.</TE>
<TE>   Powell sought to clarify the U.S. position Friday and told Israel to
withdraw military forces from Palestinian areas "without delay" and not
use the days before his arrival to continue incursions that have fed an
explosion of violence.</TE>
<TE>Rights Group Alleges Torture of Detainees</TE>
<TE>   After an unprecedented spate of suicide bombings, Israel has occupied
every major Palestinian city in the West Bank save one, in what it
described as a hunt for terrorists and the infrastructure that supports
them. Army operations chief Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland said about 1,200
Palestinians have been rounded up, of which about 200 are serious
criminals, and numerous weapons confiscated.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem on Friday accused the army of
torturing Palestinian detainees at the Ofer military camp just outside
Ramallah. Interrogation methods include the breaking of detainees' toes,
B'Tselem said in a statement. The extent of the practice was not known,
B'Tselem said, but attorneys will petition the Israeli Supreme Court to
demand a halt to the practice and gain access to the prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   One Palestinian released from Ofer said in an interview Friday that
detainees who are Palestinian policemen received the worst treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Kamal abu Khadijeh, a finance manager for Coca-Cola in Ramallah, was
grabbed from his home by soldiers last Saturday, handcuffed, blindfolded
and taken to Ofer. He said he was never questioned beyond basic
biographical data, was held in crude conditions in a tent with hundreds
of other men and finally released Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate comment from the army on the B'Tselem
accusation.</TE>
<TE>   The deadliest violence Friday was in Nablus and Jenin, cities where
few journalists have been able to gain access.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli attack helicopters launched repeated rocket assaults on the
cramped old city center of Nablus, known as the casbah, where hundreds of
Palestinian fighters are entrenched. They are hiding in the winding
alleyways and tunnels, where they have set booby traps and land mines for
the soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The battle escalated in the evening and continued into the night.
Black smoke from burning vehicles could be seen over the center of Nablus
as gunfire and blasts echoed through the hills. Houses in the casbah and
in the teeming Balata refugee camp were peppered with heavy machine-gun
fire.</TE>
<TE>Militia Commander Reportedly Killed</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials and Palestinian militia sources said the dozen or
more dead in Nablus included Nasser Awais, a regional commander and
founder of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade. The militia has claimed
responsibility for scores of shooting and bombing attacks against
Israelis over the last 18 months of conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops in 14 armored personnel carriers stormed the house of
Nablus Mayor Ghassan Shaka around 3 a.m. Friday. They strip-searched all
eight men and three women who were present before taking the men away
blindfolded. The mayor was in Amman, Jordan, at the time, but his wife,
daughter and two sons were at home.</TE>
<TE>   "They were yelling: 'Get out! Get out! Don't wear any clothes,' " the
mayor's wife, Halimeh, said in an interview, her hands still shaking
hours after the incident as she fingered a cigarette. "They were kicking
us in our backs. They made us kneel down on the ground with our faces to
the wall and our hands behind our heads, and they kicked us."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, phoning from Jordan to check on his family, said the
destruction brought by the Israeli invasion was excessive and
unnecessary. "We've lived here for 30 years," he said. "They [Israeli
soldiers] came during the first intifada, but not this way."</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers ransacked the large two-story house, looking for
documents, upending chairs and beds and emptying closets. They took
important papers and $2,000, Halimeh Shaka said.</TE>
<TE>   Two Palestinian men wounded in the fighting in Nablus were brought to
the Nablus Specialty Hospital on Friday, after they lay wounded and
bleeding for several hours in the city center. Nasser Chabara, 26, had
multiple gunshot wounds to the stomach and shoulder. His left arm had to
be amputated below the elbow. He lost his right eye when a bomb exploded
in his face.</TE>
<TE>   Early Friday, Israeli forces stormed into Tubas, a village near Jenin.
Helicopter gunships attacked a house, killing six militants from the
Hamas group. One was identified by Israeli officials as Qeis Odwan, a
regional commander of Hamas' military wing who allegedly masterminded the
March 27 suicide bombing of a Passover Seder at a hotel in the coastal
Israeli city of Netanya.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas on Friday night vowed "harsh and cruel" retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   Two other people were killed in Tubas, including a 13-year-old girl
who stepped onto her balcony to see what was going on.</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, where a standoff continued between Israeli troops and
Palestinian gunmen in the Church of the Nativity, the site revered as the
birthplace of Jesus, the bodies of six men were reported discovered. They
were presumed to have been collaborators.</TE>
<TE>   And in another move certain to inflame tempers, Palestinian
Information Minister Yasser Abed-Rabbo said Israeli troops forced their
way into his Ramallah home Friday on the pretext of conducting a search.
The army had no comment.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>To avoid the fatal flaw of the Camp David peace process under
President Clinton, the Bush administration is mapping a strategy to bring
in the Arab world as a junior partner in Washington's new diplomatic
gamble in the Middle East, U.S. officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell will reach out to Saudi Crown
Prince Abdullah, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's King Abdullah
II and other Arab leaders in stops before he travels to Israel later next
week, U.S. and Mideast officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "The goal is to get the Arabs involved in everything Powell is going
to do," said a Mideast diplomat who asked to remain anonymous.</LD>
<TE>   The United States hopes to use Arab leverage to pressure Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat to finally rein in extremists, and it
hopes to use a recent Arab League peace initiative as an incentive to win
Israel's compliance with a political settlement, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a vital role for these Arab allies to play," White House
Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said in Crawford, Texas, where President
Bush is playing host to British Prime Minister Tony Blair. "Many of these
nations represent traditions that have broken with the past in the Middle
East. . . . They can play a very constructive role. And the president
will work with those leaders who have already shown a great desire to
achieve peace in the region."</TE>
<TE>   The new tactic is in sharp contrast with the Clinton administration's
strategy. During its last-ditch Camp David peace talks in 2000 between
Arafat and Israel's then-prime minister, Ehud Barak, the United States
didn't bring the Arab nations into the effort until the process was
already on the verge of failure, Clinton administration officials now
acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   When Arafat balked at the terms Barak had offered, Clinton telephoned
Arab leaders and asked them to pressure the Palestinians to accept the
package. But he didn't outline the terms of the deal, and the Arabs
wouldn't sign on to the effort, which then collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   "The game plan now is to bring them in from the start," the Mideast
diplomat said.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview after talks with Powell on Friday, Jordanian Foreign
Minister Marwan Muasher said America's top diplomat is asking the Arab
world to "have a vested interest" in the effort.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Arab world had already contributed by offering an
initiative to end the conflict and make peace with Israel. Now, "to
translate this into a tangible mechanism, we must work with the United
States, and we are willing to do our part," Muasher said.</TE>
<TE>   But Washington is also asking the Arab world for cooperation in ending
the violence, U.S. officials said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We embraced the Arab League resolution, but we noticed that nobody at
the summit in Beirut said a word about suicide bombings, and they have to
do more too to stop the violence," a senior State Department official
said.</TE>
<TE>   The overall U.S. goal is to launch a process that blends a new
cease-fire and security arrangement with a political process, rather than
taking up the former and then the latter.</TE>
<TE>   While the administration is reaching out to the Arab world, Bush is
increasingly showing his anger at Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought a couple of months ago that we had an agreement. The next
thing we know, he's ordered a shipment of arms from Iran," Bush said in
an interview with Britain's ITV network, according to a transcript
released Friday. "Now, he's got a long way to go, and it starts with him
proving that he can lead.</TE>
<TE>   "He has let his people down. And there are others in the region who
can lead."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he wasn't suggesting that Palestinians should look for a new
leader, but added: "It's up to them. Far be it from the American
president to get to decide who leads what country. I'm just telling you
[that] since I've been the president, the man hasn't performed."</TE>
<TE>   Bush made it clear that, although his foreign policy team has focused
on the Mideast violence, it hasn't forgotten another pressing issue in
the region: the security threat posed by Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "I made up my mind that Saddam [Hussein] needs to go. That's about all
I'm willing to share with you," he said in the interview, which was
conducted Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Powell is scheduled to leave late Sunday and begin his tour Monday in
Morocco, where he will meet with Saudi Arabia's Abdullah and Moroccan
King Mohammed VI.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi leader is critical to the U.S. effort because he crafted the
proposal that the Arab League passed last week that offers "normal
relations" with Israel in exchange for withdrawal from territories
occupied in the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia has been a strong financial supporter of Palestinian
groups, mainly Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization but also the
militant Islamic group Hamas, according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   Powell will also go to Egypt and Jordan before arriving in Israel at
week's end, Mideast envoys and U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, U.S. officials privately expressed alarm that Israel had
moved to heighten its incursion into the West Bank, where more than two
dozen Palestinians were killed Friday in the bloodiest round of clashes
since Israel began to reoccupy territory last week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty shocking," said the senior State Department official, who
asked to remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush's speech Thursday on the Mideast crisis was notable in
that it did not call for an immediate withdrawal, Powell on Friday called
for a pullout of Israeli forces "without delay."</TE>
<TE>   "The expectation is that the incursions will stop and a withdrawal
process will begin as soon as possible or without delay--whichever
formulation you would choose," Powell told reporters after his session
with Muasher.</TE>

<HD>Mahony E-Mails Cite Fears Over Scandals</HD>
<DH>Abuse: In another development, a Fresno woman alleges the L.A.
archbishop molested her in 1970.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A series of confidential e-mails written by Cardinal Roger M.
Mahony show how pervasively the nationwide child-abuse scandal in the
Catholic Church has affected the Los Angeles Archdiocese.</LD>
<LD>   The e-mails, leaked to radio station KFI, which provided copies to The
Times, paint a picture of a sometimes-agitated archbishop alarmed that he
is losing public relations ground.</LD>
<LD>   The memos, written during the past three weeks, capture an archdiocese
confronting political, legal and moral challenges: where to place a
priest newly accused of molesting children; whether the church should
start a victims support group; how to anticipate and counteract media
accusations; how to give "instruction" in child-abuse law to Los Angeles
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, and how to measure the number of weeks or
months before a "healing" process begins in the church.</LD>
<TE>   The e-mail also reveals that a Fresno woman made a 32-year-old
unspecified "claim" against Mahony. Questions by reporters prompted the
cardinal Friday night to issue a categorical denial of "ever having
molested anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Fresno police Lt. Keith Foster confirmed Friday that an investigation
is underway. The Fresno Diocese turned over a recent two-hour taped
interview with the woman to police, an e-mail says.</TE>
<TE>   The woman told The Times on Friday that Mahony molested her in 1970
when he visited the San Joaquin Memorial Catholic High School, where she
was a student. She provided few other details, saying police asked her
not to talk.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, who was then a priest in Fresno and rose to the position of
auxiliary bishop, "categorically" denied "ever having molested anyone."</TE>
<TE>   In a March 28 e-mail, Mahony expressed willingness to be interviewed
by Fresno detectives and wrote his advisors that he did not need an
attorney because he had no recollection of the woman making the complaint
and informed the LAPD the same day he was told of the accusation.</TE>
<TE>   Other e-mails focus on the growing demands that Mahony fully disclose
the names of the eight priests he had fired in February for molesting
minors. The archdiocese subsequently turned the information over to
police but has yet to disclose it to the public.</TE>
<TE>   In one e-mail, a top Mahony advisor recommends that the cardinal
remain deliberately vague about where the eight priests served before
Mahony fired them. While Mahony told The Times in a separate interview
that none of the priests were in parish ministries, the e-mail from Msgr.
Craig Cox, vicar for clergy, says that some did serve on a part-time
basis in parishes--a fact that implies they had were around children.</TE>
<TE>   At times, Mahony and his inner circle are shown attempting to promptly
cooperate with police on new allegations of sexual abuse. In other
e-mails, there is a clear determination to protect the institution.</TE>
<TE>   The communications also reveal that:</TE>
<TE>   * Mahony was so upset by the archdiocese's failure to turn over some
names of several dismissed priests to police that he warned his general
counsel he might be subpoenaed by a grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't, today, "consult" with the [detective] about those three
names, I can guarantee you that I will get hauled into a Grand Jury
proceeding and I will be forced to give all the names, etc.," Mahony
wrote to his top lawyer, Sister Judith Murphy.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, March 27, the archdiocese had not turned over to police
the names of three of eight priests he dismissed in February. The names
were subsequently turned over to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   * Mahony wrote Murphy in that same e-mail that the archdiocese had
made a "huge mistake" by withholding the names of the three priests.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure you grasp the gravity of the situation and where this is
heading--not only with the media, but with the law enforcement and legal
folks," Mahony wrote Murphy.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't take immediate, aggressive action here--the consequences
for the AD [archdiocese] are going to be incredible: charges of cover-up,
concealing criminals, etc., etc.," Mahony wrote.</TE>
<TE>   * In another e-mail, Mahony says he wants to step up outreach to
sexual abuse victims. While the archdiocese already provides counseling
and cash settlements, Mahony said he wanted to start a victims support
group that would be "almost entirely spiritual."</TE>
<TE>   * Archdiocesan attorney John McNicholas in another e-mail recounts
debate over whether a well known and highly regarded gay priest should
continue to teach a course at Crespi Carmelite High School in Encino,
whose president was recently removed because of an allegation of sexual
abuse in his past. Sister Murphy, in a separate e-mail, notes that a
critical "off-the-wall right wing throw-away newspaper has been gunning
for him [the gay priest] for years."</TE>
<TE>   * Sister Murphy in another e-mail invokes the slogan of television's
Sgt. Joe Friday--"only the facts, sir, only the facts"--in advising
church officials about a pending visit from two police detectives. The
police were coming in response to an alert by church officials of
possible abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen to their questions and take your time answering," Murphy
wrote. "Do not volunteer information. This is not a session to be
chatty."</TE>
<TE>   * Outside attorney L. Martin Nussbaum worries on another day that "the
next wave of this press feeding frenzy" about pedophile priests may focus
on priests who have had adult "romantic or sexual liaisons." Nussbaum
advises Mahony to comb through the files of every priest ever disciplined
to "assess the scope of any such problem."</TE>
<TE>   * Mahony in another missive wrestles with his decision to release one
priest's name to police. "His case troubles me." Mahony writes to Msgr.
Cox. "I am leaning toward giving it to the LAPD to review. We could be
very vulnerable on any case where there is a dispute between folks, and
we have not referred it out."</TE>
<TE>   * Mahony's aides confront the problem of a priest who last month was
reassigned after being accused of molesting youths at his Azusa church.
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is investigating. Cox writes
that the priest "denied forcefully any misconduct."</TE>
<TE>   "If there is something to the allegations, then we want to be sure he
is removed from ministry," Sister Murphy writes. "But if the allegations
are unfounded, the sooner that can be established and he restored to
ministry, the better. If he is innocent, I am most concerned that his
reputation not be damaged more than it will already be by having things
drag on and on and on."</TE>
<TE>FBI Investigating Who Leaked E-Mails</TE>
<TE>   The FBI on Friday launched a criminal investigation to uncover whether
a computer hacker broke into the e-mail system or a church insider leaked
the information.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Bosley, an FBI spokeswoman in Los Angeles, said the bureau is
investigating whether Mahony's e-mail was "compromised and leaked."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said he was
prepared to launch his own investigation into the "illegal access" of the
e-mails. He also served notice that Mahony's written statements in the
communications are "of grave concern." Cooley said he wants to find out
if the archdiocese illegally withheld information about child abuse from
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   At the first banquet held at the archdiocese's downtown Cathedral
Conference Center on Friday, Mahony stepped quickly through a door to
avoid reporters following a speech to the downtown Rotary Club.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony confined his remarks before 500 Rotarians and guests to the new
$193-million Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, which opens Sept. 2. An
aide cautioned reporters before the speech that Mahony would refuse to
take any questions about the sexual abuse scandal rocking the Roman
Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony did respond Thursday night to an e-mail from The Times with a
no comment. "I cannot and will not comment on privileged client-attorney
communication that was criminally stolen," Mahony wrote in a return
e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   At the archdiocese's administrative headquarters in the Mid-Wilshire
district, employees said many were on edge. "It's getting tense," said
one.</TE>
<TE>Cardinal Asked Judge to Block Publication</TE>
<TE>   The tension began to build Thursday when KFI disclosed that it had
obtained leaked copies of scores of e-mails which were written late last
month and early this month by Mahony and trusted confidants.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Lopez, KFI producer, said he received the e-mails from an
"anonymous individual." He said the person called him and offered to fax
him the e-mails, then sent them via computer.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the station's talk show hosts, John Kobylt and Ken Champou,
began reading portions of the e-mails on their show Thursday afternoon in
a remote broadcast from outside the cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   As word reached the archdiocese of the disclosures, Mahony moved
forcibly Thursday night to block publication of the e-mails by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers who anticipate filing a late-night motion usually contact the
writs courtroom's clerk during business hours. But a lawyer for the
archdiocese obtained their hearing by telephoning a retired presiding
judge of the Superior Court, Richard Byrne. Byrne called a judge who
specializes in writs. That judge provided a referral to a senior
colleague who set a highly unusual 10:30 p.m. hearing.</TE>
<TE>   In a ruling delivered just before midnight, Judge David Yaffe held
that the U.S. Constitution prevented him from preventing publication of
the documents.</TE>
<TE>   In denying the Fresno molestation allegation Friday, Mahony saidin a
written statement, "Such false allegations are hurtful and troubling to
me, yet I continue to pray fervently for those who make them.</TE>
<TE>   Reached by telephone Friday night at her home in Fresno, the woman
said she reported her allegation recently to the school and that school
officials informed Fresno police.</TE>
<TE>   "It kept eating away at me," she told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   In a March 28 e-mail, Mahony expressed willingness to be interviewed
by Fresno detectives and wrote his advisors that he did not need an
attorney because he had no recollection of the woman making the
complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fresno PD can call me any time for a telephone interview; they
can tape-record the interview, and I don't need an attorney on the line.
Since I have no recollection of ever meeting the lady, I welcome the
interview. Please give them my home number if they wish to call during
these days of Holy Week or over the weekend," the cardinal wrote. He sent
the message to Msgr. Richard Loomis, who heads the administrative
services secretariat of the archdiocese, and to media relations director
Tod Tamberg.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said in his Friday night statement that he was informed of the
allegation March 22 by Fresno Bishop John Steinbock.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails shed new light on a debate that began March 4 when The
Times reported that Mahony had dismissed six to 12 priests.</TE>
<TE>   Alerted by the story, LAPD Chief Parks wrote Mahony on March 25 and
pressed him for the names. He said a criminal investigation was underway.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Michael Krikorian contributed to this story</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>'Our Big Mistake'</TE>
<TE>   This is the text of an e-mail, titled "Our Big Mistake," that Cardinal
Roger M. Mahony sent on the morning of March 27 to Sister Judith Murphy,
the archdiocese's general counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Two days earlier, Police Chief Bernard C. Parks pressed Mahony for the
names of all priests Mahony had recently dismissed for past cases of
sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Those dismissals had first been publicized March 4 in a Los Angeles
Times story. However, the archdiocese refused to confirm or deny that the
dismissals had occurred. Church sources told the newspaper that six to 12
priests had been dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Sr. Judy</TE>
<TE>   As the drum beats continue from every side for us to release the
"names," I must still point to what I consider our greatest tactical
mistake of the past few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   If I recall, of the 8 priests involved, 5 had already been reported to
local law enforcement agencies. That leaves 3.</TE>
<TE>   Recall also that I pressed for you to meet with [LAPD sex crimes] Det.
Barraclough and "consult" him about the other 3 so that we could state
without hesitation that all priests no longer in service had been
reported to various law enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   You resisted quite strongly that suggestion.</TE>
<TE>   I hope you have changed your mind by now! By doing it back then, we
would not appear to be crumbling under public pressure. It was a huge
mistake on our part.</TE>
<TE>   If we don't, today, "consult" with the Det. about those 3 names, I can
guarantee you that I will get hauled into a Grand Jury proceeding and I
will be forced to give all the names, etc.</TE>
<TE>   I must now insist that this matter is no longer open for discussion.
You must consult with the Det. about those 3 cases.</TE>
<TE>   In my response to Parks, I want to state that every single case of the
few priests was reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency over
the years.</TE>
<TE>   I must be able to state that--even publicly. And soon.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure you grasp the gravity of the situation and where this is
heading--not only with the media, but with the law enforcement and legal
folks.</TE>
<TE>   The best place to state it would be in my letter to Parks, and then in
a follow-up letter to [Dist. Atty. Steve] Cooley.</TE>
<TE>   If we don't take immediate, aggressive action here--the consequences
for the AD are going to be incredible: charges of cover-up, concealing
criminals, etc., etc.</TE>
<TE>   PLEASE make this task your highest priority this morning! I have
reached the point where if I cannot guarantee that all 8 have been
appropriately reported, then I will have to call the Det. and do it
myself--today.</TE>
<TE>   There is no middle ground on this one; we are losing the battle
because we are somehow "hiding" those 3. The best way is to "consult"
with the Det. about them, and let them decide what needs to be done next.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks for listening. This public media pressure will never stop until
we can announce that those few priests have all been reported to the
appropriate authorities over the years.</TE>

<DH>Balkans: Belgrade stalls and risks losing millions in U.S. aid
because of the public's opposition to the war crimes tribunal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>The increasingly troubled face of Yugoslavia came into full view
this week as a crucial deadline for detaining war crimes suspects passed
with no action from government leaders, who risk losing millions of
dollars in U.S. aid.</LD>
<LD>   Yugoslav officials, who had suggested that the hand-over would come
just a day or two after the March 31 deadline, later in the week again
put off action, saying that they first wanted to pass a law regulating
transfer of war crimes suspects to an international tribunal in The
Hague.</LD>
<LD>   "Simply, I wouldn't like the extraditions to take place before the law
is passed, and I want to be an optimist that a law will be passed,"
Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica said.</LD>
<TE>   More than $40 million in U.S. aid was frozen Monday, but Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell left the door open for a continuation of funding as
soon as Yugoslavia complies with the extradition requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be very disappointed, however, if the transfers do not occur
in the next day or two," a Western diplomat said.</TE>
<TE>   Although no one in this Balkan nation doubts that more indicted war
crimes suspects eventually will be transferred to the tribunal, the
delays point to the country's deeper problems in facing its violent past.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts, and government officials in Serbia, the main Yugoslav
republic, cite increasing frustration that U.S. policy focuses so much on
compliance with the Hague tribunal. The government, they say, has taken
widely acclaimed steps to remake its ravaged and corrupt economy.</TE>
<TE>   "What I would hope is that the United States will notice the enormous
progress made in the last 14 months since we came to power," said Serbian
Finance Minister Bozidar Djelic, a Western-trained businessman who is
widely viewed as one of the most progressive members of the new
government.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see the point in America having a values-based foreign policy,
and I don't want to condone the countries who might be performing well
economically but are not espousing those values . . . but America has to
understand we too have public opinion to work with, we too have people
who are just waiting for this reformist government to be put in a light
that would make people think we are hopeless Western puppets," Djelic
said.</TE>
<TE>   A key problem for government leaders is that Serbs believe that the
Hague tribunal is attempting to tar them with the blame for all of the
war crimes committed as the former Yugoslav federation crumbled in the
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Although a number of Croats and some Bosnian Muslims have been
indicted, the majority of those facing war crimes charges are Serbs.</TE>
<TE>   Few Serbs believe that the court's focus on charging high-level
officials such as former Yugoslav strongman Slobodan Milosevic is
intended to avoid blaming the entire society.</TE>
<TE>   "People are aware that the extraditions are something that have to be
done, but it is not pleasant," said Ljiljana Bacevic, director of the
Center for Political Studies and Public Opinion Research, a local think
tank and polling organization.</TE>
<TE>   Most repugnant to many Serbs is the link between the hand-over of
suspected war criminals and financial aid, Bacevic said. "Nobody is happy
with these conditions . . . with the idea that we have to sell somebody.
It's humiliating."</TE>
<TE>   As distrust has grown in recent months, the transfer of war crimes
suspects has become a major political issue tearing the fragile ruling
coalition. With the Serbian presidential election due in the fall,
political leaders are scrambling to use the tribunal issue to gain an
edge.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever is seen as responsible for the transfer of war crimes
suspects will be regarded as doing a dirty job and will suffer in the
next elections," said Bratislav Grubacic, a political analyst in
Belgrade, the Yugoslav and Serbian capital.</TE>
<TE>   The two key players are Kostunica, a nationalist whose constituency
consists primarily of poorer, older and more rural voters, and Serbian
Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, who represents the reformist political
wing but has never won broad popular support.</TE>
<TE>   Kostunica has distanced himself from the Hague tribunal. He said on
Serbian state television in late March that it "turns my stomach."</TE>
<TE>   Djindjic, who masterminded the transfer of Milosevic to The Hague last
summer, has been trying to force Kostunica to take some of the
responsibility this time.</TE>
<TE>   The volatility of the issue makes it that much more difficult for
government officials to apprehend and transfer more-popular figures from
the Milosevic era such as Bosnian Serb Gen. Ratko Mladic, who has been
charged with genocide for his role in Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the
slaughter of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys after the surrender of
the eastern town of Srebrenica in July 1995. Reports have suggested that
Mladic has spent much of his time in Serbia since Bosnia's 1992-95 war.</TE>
<TE>   The alternative to using the tribunal issue as a political tool would
be to talk about war crimes openly, and in a way that helps the country
to examine its recent history. That approach does not seem to be on
anybody's agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "This could have been a moment when our politicians opened up the war
crimes issue and helped us to get back our self-respect," lamented Sonja
Biserko, director of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia, a
nonprofit human rights group in Belgrade.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead they somehow encouraged this anti-tribunal, anti-Western
sentiment, and people watch Milosevic's trial as if it's a football
match," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Even some intellectuals are saying little--in part because they
profited from the old regime, obtaining appointments in universities and
institutes that ensured them a place in Serbian society and an income.
The result is a culture of silence.</TE>
<TE>   "People here don't want to look at the reality of the past, they want
to say the real past doesn't exist, they only want to believe in the myth
of the past," said Borka Pavicevic, who runs the Center for Cultural
Decontamination, a nonprofit arts group focused on political issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is hesitating to say things, everyone is afraid that if they
speak out, it will hurt either their personal situation or the new
government, which they feel is so much better than the old government
that they don't want to hurt it in any way."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Aid Figured in Kingpin's Capture</HD>
<DH>Drugs: Surveillance helped Mexican police seize the head of the
Tijuana cartel. A judge drops some charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. government Friday acknowledged playing an important role
in last month's capture of Benjamin Arellano Felix, an arrest that
authorities on both sides of the border have hailed as crucial to efforts
to dismantle the notorious Tijuana cartel.</LD>
<LD>   A high-ranking U.S. official who spoke on the condition he not be
named said the March 9 arrest of the cartel's leader was facilitated by
U.S. surveillance of cash couriers who move tens of thousands of dollars
from Tijuana to the cartel's safe houses in Mexico City and Puebla.</LD>
<LD>   Until now, U.S. officials had credited the Mexicans with Arellano
Felix's capture, the biggest coup so far in President Vicente Fox's
offensive on major drug lords. Officials in both governments are hailing
a renewed spirit of cross-border cooperation and intelligence-sharing.</LD>
<TE>   "The good news is that the Mexican government acted on the tip, that
it didn't sit there for six months with no action being taken on it," as
might have been the case in the past, the high-ranking official said.</TE>
<TE>   A big break in the case came when U.S. surveillance helped track
Arellano Felix's wife, Ruth, to a house in Puebla where her husband was
believed to be holed up, the official said. That prompted Mexican army
units to storm the house, arresting Arellano Felix in a 1 a.m. raid.</TE>
<TE>   No shots were fired, although Ruth Arellano Felix pulled a gun and
threatened authorities, the U.S. official said. She was not arrested. At
least one of the couple's three children was in the house at the time.</TE>
<TE>   While applauding progress in the campaign against drug cartels, both
U.S. and Mexican officials expressed concern about a judge's dismissal
Thursday of some of the charges filed against Arellano Felix, related to
weapons possession and the 1993 killing of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas
Ocampo.</TE>
<TE>   In explaining the dismissals, Judge Leopoldo Ceron said that evidence
linking Arellano Felix to the killing was insufficient and that the
weapons charges arose from a police raid conducted without a proper
search warrant.</TE>
<TE>   Arellano Felix's brother Francisco was convicted of having
participated in the cardinal's killing, in the western city of
Guadalajara, and is serving a prison sentence, as are two hit men who
worked for the family. The cardinal apparently was an accidental victim
of an attack by the Tijuana cartel on a rival gang leader.</TE>
<TE>   The dismissals raised fears Friday among U.S. and Mexican law
enforcement officials that the Mexican judiciary is intimidated by the
cartel's violent reputation and that Arellano Felix would somehow elude
justice.</TE>
<TE>   Two federal judges were slain in Mazatlan in November in what some
Mexican officials think were vengeance killings ordered by the cartel.</TE>
<TE>   One top Mexican prosecutor, who asked that his name not be used,
derided Ceron's action in an interview Friday, saying federal prosecutors
in the Arellano Felix case had "20 years of experience and know what they
are doing."</TE>
<TE>   Said the U.S. official: "I'm concerned any time that charges are
dismissed, but I've been assured that the remaining three charges
[against Arellano Felix] are very strong."</TE>
<TE>   The United States has said it will seek to extradite Arellano Felix to
face drug-trafficking charges. A $2-million reward was on his head at the
time of his arrest. The drug chieftain is in the process of being
"re-indicted" on U.S. charges that would not require a life sentence. The
Mexican Supreme Court has ruled that Mexicans cannot be extradited to
face life in prison or the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   The new spirit of U.S.-Mexico cooperation has come about because,
though corruption remains rampant among Mexican law enforcement agencies,
the U.S. has "found a handful of people who we can be confident about,"
the official said.</TE>
<TE>   He credited the courageous "snake eaters" in the Mexican army for
arresting cartel leaders who, through intimidation or bribes, have
enjoyed impunity in the past.</TE>

<HD>Musharraf Outlines Referendum</HD>
<DH>Asia: The Pakistani president's bid to extend his rule is opposed
by those who say the vote defies the constitution and who favor
elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Portraying himself as a savior of Pakistani democracy, not an
enemy, President Pervez Musharraf on Friday called a referendum for early
next month that he hopes will give him five more years in power.</LD>
<LD>   Musharraf, dressed in his army general's khaki uniform, announced the
referendum on national television during a speech that lasted more than
90 minutes. The president, who seized power in a bloodless 1999 coup,
appeared mindful of opposition charges that he is violating the
constitution.</LD>
<LD>   "Those who want me to continue my reform should be on my side,"
Musharraf said. "I want the entire world to know that the 140 million
people of Pakistan are behind me."</LD>
<TE>   Musharraf said the referendum will be held in May but that he's
leaving it up to the country's Electoral Commission to decide the exact
date and wording of the question that will decide if he stays in power.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that exiled prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir
Bhutto won't be allowed to return to Pakistan to "plunder the national
wealth."</TE>
<TE>   But a spokesman for Bhutto insisted that she will come back before
parliamentary elections scheduled for October and fight for votes from
inside a jail cell, if necessary. Bhutto fled the country in 1999 to
escape corruption charges leveled by Sharif's government.</TE>
<TE>   "Benazir Bhutto will return to Pakistan and take part in the [October]
elections, and lead the people in their democratic struggle, whether it
pleases or displeases anyone," her spokesman, Farhatullah Babar, said
here after Musharraf's speech.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if she is sent to prison," Babar said, "she will contest the
elections from prison."</TE>
<TE>   Bhutto's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was deposed and
hanged by military dictator Zia ul-Haq in 1979. Zia's government received
massive U.S. aid for its role in supporting the war against the Soviet
occupation of neighboring Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   By becoming a front-line ally in the Bush administration's war against
terrorism, Musharraf has won essential support from the U.S. and other
Western governments that once pressured him to hand over power to a
democratically elected leader.</TE>
<TE>   Bhutto apparently hopes that history will continue to repeat itself
and return her to power. She made a defiant return from exile in 1988
after Zia died in a mysterious air crash, leading her party to a massive
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition parties and powerful Islamic groups have all condemned
Musharraf's effort to legitimize his hold on power through a referendum
instead of standing against other candidates in a normal election.</TE>
<TE>   "The constitution does not provide for the election of a president
through referendum," Babar said. "So this is unconstitutional, illegal
and immoral. The way he has interpreted the constitution is an insult to
the constitution."</TE>
<TE>   Babar's party and others have vowed to boycott the referendum, and
some moderates here fear that religious extremists could use the
referendum campaign to stir up anti-American passions, especially if the
violence continues in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Like Musharraf, Zia held a referendum to seek a democratic mandate. He
claimed more than 62% support after the 1984 vote, which few accepted as
credible because there was a widespread boycott and charges of vote
fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Zia also posed a referendum question so complicated that his opponents
accused him of trickery.</TE>
<TE>   That referendum's 78-word question, posed in a single sentence, asked
in part whether voters supported Zia's process of "bringing the laws of
Pakistan in conformity with the injunctions of Islam."</TE>
<TE>   That strategy, known as "Islamicization," is blamed for the secret
links between the military and Islamic extremists that created the
terrorist and militant groups that Musharraf now says he is determined to
dismantle.</TE>
<TE>   Although Pakistani authorities have arrested more than 2,000 suspected
Islamic radicals since Musharraf joined the war against terrorism last
fall, his government has released hundreds of them and the military is
accused of protecting terrorist leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Some Pakistani analysts have suggested that Musharraf is letting the
radicals go free in order to improve relations with Islamic hard-liners,
just as Zia did when he consolidated his power in the 1980s by
encouraging religious extremism.</TE>
<TE>   Babar said that it isn't clear yet whether Musharraf's public
commitment to the war against terrorism is sincere but that there is
already evidence of "a disconnect" between what the president says and
what he does.</TE>
<TE>   He cited the case of Maulana Masood Azhar, leader of the banned
militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed, which the U.S. and India have accused of
terrorism. Azhar was moved from jail to house arrest, Babar said, instead
of being charged and tried for his alleged crimes.</TE>
<TE>   In Pakistan's parliamentary democracy, the legislature is supposed to
choose the head of state. But polls suggest that Musharraf has won a lot
of support by taking power away from traditional, and deeply corrupt,
political parties.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not necessary that we have the same democracy as in Britain,
that we just copy them," Musharraf said. "Every country needs to have
democracy according to their own environment."</TE>
<TE>   Babar called Musharraf arrogant for suggesting that "a handful of
generals" can clean up corruption in Pakistan's government when, Babar
maintained, defense contracts are rife with corruption.</TE>

burial is scheduled for Tuesday.</DH>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>Thousands of people formed a mile-long line to pay their respects
to Britain's beloved queen mother on Friday, filing past her coffin as
she lay in state after a grand funeral procession that matched that of
British wartime leader Winston Churchill.</LD>
<LD>   The line of well-wishers snaked along the banks of the River Thames,
and police said the imposing Westminster Hall, where the coffin will
remain until burial Tuesday, would stay open until all mourners had filed
past.</LD>
<LD>   Up to 250,000 people had earlier packed the route of the procession,
straining to see the casket borne slowly on a horse-drawn gun carriage.
Such a large procession had not been seen since Churchill's death in
1965.</LD>
<TE>   Draped over the coffin was the queen mother's standard. On top was her
diamond-encrusted crown. On the coffin lay a white bouquet with the
simple inscription "In Loving Memory." It was signed "Lilibet," the Queen
Mother's pet name for her daughter Queen Elizabeth.</TE>
<TE>   The teenage princes William and Harry bowed their heads in grief, arms
straight at their sides.</TE>
<TE>   Prince Charles, their father and the 101-year-old "queen mum's"
favorite grandson, mourned a "gloriously unstoppable and magical" woman
who became a wartime symbol of British defiance.</TE>
<TE>   The queen mother was a bastion of support as the House of Windsor
juggled scandal and divorce, its popularity punctured as the age of
deference passed into history.</TE>

<HD>Militant's Case Casts Doubt on Pakistan's Resolve</HD>
<DH>Asia: Authorities have allowed a Bin Laden ally to go underground,
critics contend, saying a government crackdown is mostly tough talk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>One of the four men who added their signatures to Osama bin Laden's
1998 edict declaring it a Muslim's duty to kill Americans has
mysteriously gone underground in Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   Officially, the government says it doesn't know the whereabouts of
Maulana Fazlur Rehman Khalil. However, a senior military officer said
privately that the longtime Bin Laden ally is "in the custody of the
government" at a military intelligence safe house.</LD>
<LD>   Khalil has not been charged with any crime, or interviewed by any of
the FBI agents tracking suspected terrorists here, according to army
Brig. Javed Iqbal Cheema, coordinator of a crackdown on Islamic radicals
announced by President Pervez Musharraf in a Jan. 12 speech.</LD>
<TE>   A leading Pakistani human rights activist says cases such as Khalil's
illustrate the hollowness of Musharraf's tough rhetoric against Islamic
militants. The Pakistani president refuses to challenge army generals who
still support and protect key radicals, said Afrasiab Khattak, head of
the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is, unfortunately, turning a blind eye because even in
his so-called historical speech, which was also praised by President
Bush, Musharraf blamed misguided clerics," Khattak said. "But he failed
to mention misguided military officers, so there has been a kind of
impunity. There have been 'holy cows.' It is a taboo subject."</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's government has detained more than 2,000 suspected
militants. But police have released hundreds of them on promises of good
behavior, and some of their leaders are held in what authorities call
protective custody in comfortable government guest houses.</TE>
<TE>   "The protection is not for society. It is for the person who is in
custody," Khattak said.</TE>
<TE>   The human rights advocate says he in unsure whether Musharraf is
unable to move more forcefully against the radicals, or whether the
president has secretly approved a policy that contradicts his public
commitment to bring all terrorists to justice.</TE>
<TE>   Khattak said there had been irresponsible conduct by "certain
elements," a common euphemism in Pakistan for the military's powerful
Inter-Services Intelligence agency, or ISI. Musharraf, an army general
who seized power in a 1999 coup, insists that the ISI is fully under his
control.</TE>
<TE>   Khalil is secretary-general of the outlawed Harkat Moujahedeen, or
Movement of the Holy Warriors, guerrilla army, which has been described
by the State Department as a terrorist organization.</TE>
<TE>Branching Out After Fight Against Soviets</TE>
<TE>   Like many of the groups linked to Bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, Harkat
has its roots in the 1980s war against the Soviet occupation of
neighboring Afghanistan. But by the early 1990s, Harkat also claimed to
have militants in countries ranging from Egypt to Bosnia-Herzegovina and
Myanmar.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, the group merged with another Afghan guerrilla faction to
form Harkat Ansar with the aim of driving Indian troops from the disputed
territory of Jammu and Kashmir. When the State Department put Harkat
Ansar on its list of terrorist organizations, the group simply reverted
to its previous name.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft noted in January that a federal indictment
against Californian John Walker Lindh alleges that he "joined a
paramilitary training camp run by the terrorist group Harkat Moujahedeen"
in May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said that after Lindh finished his training, he was given a
choice of fighting with Harkat in Kashmir or joining the Taliban forces
in Afghanistan. Lindh chose the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Indian investigators suspect that a faction of Harkat was
behind the July 1995 kidnapping and killing of Western hikers--an
American, two Britons, a German and a Norwegian--in Kashmir. Another
American escaped.</TE>
<TE>   In another case, Pakistani militant Maulana Masood Azhar told Indian
police after his arrest in Kashmir in 1994 that Khalil had instructed him
to travel to Kenya in 1993 to support Somalis organizing attacks against
U.S. and other international forces in Somalia.</TE>
<TE>   The Kenya-based terror organization was identified in U.S. court last
year as the cell responsible for the 1998 bombings of the U.S. Embassy in
Nairobi, the capital, and in Tanzania that killed 224 people, including
12 Americans.</TE>
<TE>   India released Azhar from jail in December 1999 along with Ahmad Saeed
Omar Sheikh in order to free the passengers of an Indian airliner that
was hijacked to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh appeared Friday in a court in Karachi to stand trial as the
chief suspect in the kidnapping and killing of Wall Street Journal
reporter Daniel Pearl this year. But the closed trial in Karachi's
central jail was adjourned until April 12.</TE>
<TE>   Khalil signed Bin Laden's February 1998 fatwa, or religious edict,
that called on Muslims everywhere to kill Americans and their allies,
whether military or civilian. It was declared under the banner of the
"World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders," with the goal
of driving the U.S. and its allies from the Arabian Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   "The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies--civilians and
military--is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any
country in which it is possible to do it," the fatwa declared.</TE>
<TE>   Khalil signed it along with Bin Laden and his chief lieutenant,
Egyptian Ayman Zawahiri; another Egyptian militant, Ahmed Taha; and
Pakistani religious scholar Sheikh Mir Hamza.</TE>
<TE>   Like Bin Laden, Zawahiri is on the run after the fall of the Taliban
regime in Afghanistan, and it is unclear where he is.</TE>
<TE>   Hamza has not been accused of direct involvement in terrorism. Taha,
wanted in connection with terrorist attacks in Egypt, reportedly was
extradited from Syria last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Last Oct. 3, Pakistani military intelligence officers detained Khalil
but released him a week later after he insisted that he had no links to
Bin Laden or Afghanistan's Taliban rulers, according a report in the
Urdu-language Ausaf newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   When Musharraf made his speech in January vowing to end all forms of
terrorism in Pakistan, police raided Khalil's home in Rawalpindi, a
suburb of Islamabad, the capital, but news reports said they couldn't
find him.</TE>
<TE>   Cheema, who heads Pakistan's national crisis management center, said
that he didn't know where Khalil was but that he was certain U.S.
authorities hadn't asked to interrogate the Harkat leader. Cheema denied
that military intelligence was protecting suspected terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I would not be wrong if I said that we have the confidence of
the government of the United States with regard to what we are doing in
Pakistan," Cheema said.</TE>
<TE>U.S. Upset by Release of Suspects</TE>
<TE>   Washington is grateful for Pakistan's help last week in the arrest of
Abu Zubeida, believed to be a Saudi with ties to Palestinians, who is
suspected of running Al Qaeda's recruitment and training operations. He
is the highest-ranking Al Qaeda member captured since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks on the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Zubeida was caught in raids in three Pakistani cities that were
carried out with the assistance of FBI agents. More than two dozen other
foreigners, all suspected Al Qaeda militants, also were detained.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. diplomats were dismayed when police released at least 16
Pakistanis rounded up in the raids, including suspected members of the
Lashkar-e-Taiba, a banned guerrilla group accused of terrorist attacks in
India and its Jammu and Kashmir state.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani police Wednesday arrested 21 more men who allegedly belong
to Harkat Moujahedeen in North-West Frontier Province, which borders
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Harkat is the military wing of the Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Islam, whose
political leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman was held in a government rest
house for more than five months until his release March 17.</TE>
<TE>   Rehman, who said he used to be a friend of Khalil, insisted that he
doesn't know where his namesake is now.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to contact Khalil this week included a meeting in an Islamabad
restaurant with a member of Jaish-e-Mohamed, a banned Harkat offshoot
with ties to the ISI.</TE>
<TE>   The man claimed that Khalil was living under a false name in
Rawalpindi. Khalil was unlikely to speak to a reporter because military
intelligence officers were keeping a close eye on militant leaders after
Pearl's slaying, the Jaish member said. The U.S. military fired several
cruise missiles at a Harkat camp near the eastern Afghan town of Khowst
on Aug. 20, 1998, in attacks on training bases affiliated with Bin Laden
to retaliate for the embassy bombings in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Two days after the attack, Khalil told reporters in Islamabad that 50
people were killed and 60 others injured in six minutes of airstrikes.</TE>
<TE>   "The USA has struck us with Tomahawk cruise missiles at only two
places, but we will hit back at them everywhere in the world, wherever we
find them," Khalil reportedly said. "We have started a holy war against
the U.S., and they will hardly find a tree to take shelter beneath it."</TE>

<HD>Sharon's Missteps, U.S. Opposition Undermine Israeli Plans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>A week ago, when Prime Minister Ariel Sharon launched Israel's
biggest military operation in the West Bank since 1967, he envisioned an
open-ended assault on Palestinian gunmen and suicide bombers--one that
might run as long as America's post-Sept. 11 campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Now the retired general's plan has been undermined--in part by his own
miscalculations, in part by opposition from President Bush, an ally whose
anti-terrorist crusade he identifies with his own.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's call Thursday for Israel to withdraw from Palestinian-ruled
areas of the West Bank and his decision to dispatch Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell to the region next week has put Sharon under pressure to
bring the operation to a halt.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli officials acknowledge that Sharon has little choice but to
abandon, for now, his strategy of isolating Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat and trying to crush Arafat's militant supporters.
But suspending an offensive that has broad support among Israelis will be
politically risky.</TE>
<TE>   After Bush's speech, which set no deadline for withdrawal, Sharon's
office issued a terse announcement that the assault would continue. On
Friday, Israeli troops moved into another West Bank town, Tubas, and
apparently killed the alleged mastermind of the Passover suicide bombing
that left 26 Israelis dead and triggered the offensive.</TE>
<TE>   But Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland, a member of the army general staff,
acknowledged that "we might have to stop this operation a little sooner"
than planned because of Powell's peace mission. Other Israeli officials
said they expected a partial withdrawal to be underway by the time Powell
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "The slow-sinking sands in the hourglass of Operation Defensive Shield
have been replaced by a clicking stopwatch," military analyst Hemi Shalev
wrote Friday in the Israeli newspaper Maariv. "Instead of an orderly,
planned military operation, the [army] will have to hurry to do what it
can."</TE>
<TE>   Previous incursions into the West Bank lasted a few days and failed to
stem a wave of suicide bombings. Sharon's impatience with half-measures
was shared by most Israelis. A poll, taken as the latest offensive got
underway and published Friday in the Yediot Aharonot newspaper, gave him
a 62% approval rating.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last week, Israel has called up 33,000 reservists and sent
armored vehicles into nearly every major West Bank city. Israeli troops
have killed more than 70 Palestinian militants and seized piles of
weapons, including 50 antitank grenades, nine bombs and nearly 2,000
guns. More than 1,200 Palestinians are being detained.</TE>
<TE>   Measured against Sharon's professed aim to destroy the Palestinians'
"terrorist infrastructure," these gains are modest. Israeli newspapers
say no more than 110 of the detainees can be linked to terrorist acts,
only about a dozen are prominent militants, and hundreds more remain at
large.</TE>
<TE>   "We are reaching into the infrastructure and disrupting it," said
Danny Ayalon, Sharon's senior foreign policy advisor. "But if we stop
halfway, the terrorists will bounce back at us as soon as we pull out.
This will be detrimental to any kind of peace effort. If we don't uproot
the terror, we'll have no chance for a real cease-fire."</TE>
<TE>   Bush has voiced sympathy for Israel's efforts to go after terrorists.
But he intervened Thursday, U.S. officials said, because the conflict was
threatening to spill beyond Israel's borders, undermine friendly
governments in Egypt and Jordan, and thwart Washington's effort to build
consensus for a military attack on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>'Sharon Can Blame Only Himself'</TE>
<TE>   The American leader faulted both sides for contributing to the growing
violence.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli critics say Sharon brought the pressure on himself by inciting
angry protests throughout the Arab world and Europe, prompting America's
allies to lean on Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The images of Israeli tanks rolling through Palestinian cities and of
soldiers keeping ordinary people locked inside for days were bad enough.
But Sharon might have weathered the storm, his critics say, had he not
made two blunders. He sent tanks to Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity,
revered by Christians as Jesus' birthplace, after Palestinian gunmen took
refuge inside. And his troops seized Arafat's headquarters, confined the
Palestinian leader to a few rooms and cut him off from visitors. Sharon
then threatened to send his nemesis away with "a one-way ticket."</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon can blame only himself for shortening the [army's] window of
time," columnist Nahum Barnea wrote Friday in Yediot Aharonot. "He tried
to humiliate and disgrace Arafat and ended up turning him into a world
martyr. He ended up portraying Israel as a desecrator of holy sites.
These two issues show how large the gap is between being right and being
smart."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon ended Arafat's isolation Friday, at least temporarily, by
letting U.S. special envoy Anthony C. Zinni into the Palestinian leader's
compound for a 90-minute meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Powell's mission next week is to boost efforts begun by Zinni to win
approval for a cease-fire plan developed in June by CIA Director George
J. Tenet and then broaden it to include political steps. The Tenet plan
would restore cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian security
services, leading to an Israeli pullback of its forces and the arrest of
terrorist suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Many Israeli officials and commentators said such an agreement no
longer sounded workable.</TE>
<TE>   "On the one hand, Bush says that Arafat has failed; on the other hand,
he says Israeli troops should leave the West Bank," said Gerald
Steinberg, a political scientist at Israel's Bar-Ilan University. "But
how can we pull out until we have a responsible partner on the West Bank?
How do we ensure that 12 hours later there's not another suicide bombing?
That might mean the end of Sharon's government."</TE>
<TE>Powell Visit Will Put Pressure on Arafat</TE>
<TE>   Powell's visit will also put Arafat on the spot. Moderate advisors
have been urging him to call off the violence and force the Israeli
leader to confront such Palestinian political demands as a rollback of
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Sharon has been courting the National Religious
Party, a right-wing bloc representing Jewish settlers. The party has said
it will join Sharon's government and has named a new leader, former Brig.
Gen. Effi Eitam, who wants a purely Jewish state and says he wouldn't
mind seeing Arafat hanged.</TE>
<TE>   The new alliance could stiffen Sharon's opposition to a U.S. peace
plan.</TE>
<TE>   But many Israeli officials and commentators doubt it will get that
far. They say Arafat has neither the will nor the ability to rein in the
militants.</TE>
<TE>   Even if he were to turn against Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two extremist
groups opposed to any peace deal, Arafat might have trouble enforcing a
cease-fire. His Palestinian Authority, set up in 1994 under the Oslo
peace accords, is in a shambles. Government and police offices have been
bombed to rubble, prisons torn down, courthouses flattened.</TE>
<TE>   And yet Bush has prodded Sharon into giving his enemy one more chance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's deja vu all over again," said Mark Heller, a senior research
fellow at Israel's Jaffee Center. "Arafat always gets one more chance.
And no matter what happens, he always will."</TE>

<HD>Israelis Dig In for Standoff at Church</HD>
<DH>Bethlehem: Military commanders accuse Palestinian gunmen of holding
nearly 80 clerics hostage, and vow to wait.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HAR GILO, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Israeli commanders of the troops surrounding the Church of the
Nativity in Bethlehem said Friday that they will wait as long as it takes
to capture more than 140 Palestinians holed up inside, while protecting
the ancient compound and its clergy.</LD>
<LD>   At a temporary Israeli military base atop Gilo hill, a biblical site
overlooking the war-torn landscape of Bethlehem, the commanders gave new
details about a standoff that entered its fourth day as four Franciscan
monks left the church compound under unclear circumstances.</LD>
<LD>   The besieged 4th century church, revered as being on the site where
Jesus was born, is one of Christianity's most hallowed places and has
become an international focal point in Israel's all-out offensive in the
West Bank.</LD>
<TE>   Almost 80 clerics are in the compound, along with dozens of wanted
terrorists and Palestinian Authority officials, including Bethlehem's
governor and intelligence chief, according to Col. Marcel Aviv, the chief
of the military operation at the church. Four nuns are also inside, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Aviv said the presence of Gov. Mohammed Madani shows that he is in
cahoots with the gunmen. The Israeli commanders accused the Palestinians
of holding the clergy hostage and making a mockery of a religious
institution in hopes of provoking an Israeli attack.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that these Palestinian Authority heads in Bethlehem are
leading a gang of terrorists that took over the church," Aviv declared.
"We can say that the PA heads have stormed the Church of the Nativity and
are preventing others from leaving and themselves refuse to leave. It is
a great disgrace to the Palestinian Authority."</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis said their troops worked with Vatican diplomats,
apparently by telephone, to help the Franciscan monks slip out of the
compound Friday without the knowledge of the gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the monks, who served in the adjacent St. Catherine's church,
were elderly, and another was in a state of panic, according to military
officers. Once outside, the monks told Israeli soldiers that the
Palestinian gunmen had forced their way into the church Tuesday as
Israeli tanks and troops rolled into town, Aviv said.</TE>
<TE>   "The priests are under terrible pressure," Aviv said. "They are
hostages."</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, the Palestinian side gave an entirely different version.
Palestinians have said they were granted sanctuary in the church by the
clerics. Reached by telephone inside the compound Friday night, Madani
said he was there to ensure the safety of the holy site and its
occupants.</TE>
<TE>   "We are staying as guests of the Franciscan priests," Madani said. "I
am not with the fighters. I came into the church . . . to ensure the
safety of the church and the priests. It's my duty as the governor of
Bethlehem."</TE>
<TE>   And a Franciscan priest who has made pro-Palestinian comments during
the siege rejected the Israeli account that his fellow clerics had
escaped. In a telephone interview, the Rev. Ibrahim Faltas said two of
the monks left because they are elderly and infirm and weren't up to the
ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   "They did not run away," Faltas said. "They were not hostages. They
shook hands with the governor before leaving."</TE>
<TE>   Painting the Israeli military as the villains of the drama,
Palestinians condemned the troops for gunning down a mentally impaired
bell ringer when he emerged from the church Thursday morning.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Israeli commanders gave their version of the death of Samir
Abraham Salman, a former altar boy and longtime employee at the church,
calling it a tragic misunderstanding. When Salman came out of the church,
he was shouting and running and refused orders to stop, the commanders
said. After firing in the air and then near him, soldiers shot him
because they feared he could be an attacker or a suicide bomber, Aviv
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was killed, and I am sorry about it," Aviv said.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen Palestinians have died in fighting with Israelis in the
Bethlehem area since Tuesday and 34 have been wounded, according to
Israeli officials. Four Israeli soldiers have been wounded during the
operation.</TE>
<TE>   Five more Palestinian deaths were added to the casualty list in
Bethlehem on Friday. Israeli military officers said they found the
brutalized corpses of five Palestinians slain by fellow Palestinians
because they were suspected collaborators with the Israel Defense Forces.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, 10 to 14 of the Palestinians inside the Church of the
Nativity are wounded, Aviv said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the barricaded Palestinians warn periodically that the
Israelis are preparing a commando raid on the compound, the Israelis seem
painfully aware of their thorny challenge. Their enemy has attracted
worldwide attention by taking refuge at a historic crossroads of
religious faiths where bloodshed would cause an uproar. The compound also
houses Roman Catholic and Armenian houses of worship.</TE>
<TE>   And the Israeli military, despite its well-known talent for daring
rescues, appears handcuffed by its professed determination to avoid any
damage to the church. If a rescue is needed, carrying it out without
spilling blood or causing any damage would be extremely difficult.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, the Israelis said they will continue to wait and
negotiate with their enemies inside.</TE>
<TE>   "We do negotiate with them," Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland, the planning
chief for the Israeli army, said at a briefing earlier in the day. "It is
not a continuous negotiation, but we do manage to speak with them
directly. And we are patient enough to solve this problem without causing
any damage to the building and of course any harm to the [religious]
community."</TE>

<HD>N. Korea to Allow Visit by U.S. Envoy</HD>
<DH>Asia: Other concessions include more family reunions and resumption
of joint road and rail projects, the South's diplomat says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>North Korean leader Kim Jong Il will reportedly allow an American
envoy to visit Pyongyang to address the Bush administration's concerns
that the Communist nation is developing weapons of mass destruction, a
South Korean presidential envoy said today.</LD>
<LD>   Envoy Lim Dong Won, returning triumphantly from a three-day summit in
Pyongyang, the North's capital, announced a broad package of concessions
from the North Koreans, including another round of reunions for separated
families and the resumption of work on severed North-South roads and
railroad lines.</LD>
<LD>   Lim said the North had accepted a proposal by South Korean President
Kim Dae Jung, a Nobel Peace laureate who has been trying to mediate the
stalemate between the United States and North Korea, to invite Bush
administration special envoy Jack Pritchard to Pyongyang for talks.</LD>
<TE>   "Chairman Kim Jong Il agreed with the . . . advice that dialogue with
the United States is necessary to prevent tensions from rising on the
Korean peninsula," Lim told reporters in Seoul. The North Koreans, he
said, "seem well aware of the seriousness of the international
situation."</TE>
<TE>   There was no word on when such a visit would occur, although Lim said
that Donald P. Gregg, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, would
visit Pyongyang this weekend to pave the way for reopening a dialogue
with North Korea. Pritchard met twice last month in New York with Pak Gil
Yon, North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   Relations between the United States and North Korea have been
spiraling downward since President Bush took office last year. They
plunged to a new low in January, when Bush named North Korea as part of
an "axis of evil," along with Iran and Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Although there are no credible allegations linking North Korea to the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Bush administration is concerned that the
country is developing nuclear, biological and chemical warheads, as well
as missiles that could reach as far as Hawaii and Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   The impoverished regime also supplies missile technology to Iran,
Libya, Pakistan and Egypt to raise hard currency, according to a recently
declassified CIA report.</TE>
<TE>   North and South Korea released a six-point statement today announcing
the family reunions and agreement on the road and railroad construction.
There was no mention in the North Korean media of any meetings planned
with the United States, although earlier in the week North Korea said it
would continue meeting with a U.S.-led consortium building nuclear power
plants in North Korea to address power shortages that affect most of the
country.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, North Korea let loose a fresh barrage of colorful
anti-American rhetoric, condemning the "brigandish and barbaric nature of
the U.S. imperialists who regard aggression and terrorism against other
nations as a mode of their existence."</TE>
<TE>   Among North Korea-watchers, there was some cynicism that the North's
supposed concessions were designed to obscure the controversy over its
development of weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course we welcome reunions of separated families and the building
of the railroad. This is fine and nice. But it doesn't solve the real
problem, which is weapons of mass destruction," said Paik Jin Hyun, a
North Korea specialist at Seoul National University. He suggested that
the North Korean government was trying to be on its best behavior to
distract the international community from the weapons issues.</TE>
<TE>   "They have seen what has happened in Afghanistan, what happened in the
past to Iraq. Although they talk bravely, they are scared of the Bush
administration," Paik said.</TE>
<TE>   The family reunions agreed to this week will take place April 28 at
Mt. Kumgang, a resort on North Korea's east coast. Additionally, economic
cooperation meetings will be held in early May in Seoul, as well as
working-level talks over the road and rail connections, the development
of an industrial park near the nations' demilitarized zone and flood
protection measures.</TE>
<TE>   For many Koreans, the most important achievement of the summit is the
resumption of family reunions after more than a year. South Korean
President Kim's landmark visit to the North two years ago paved the way
for three rounds of reunions that involved about 4,800 participants, but
squabbling over timing and venues brought things to a standstill.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea has a waiting list of 117,576 people who have applied to
participate in the reunions, although about 12% are said to have died
since putting their names on the list. Kim Chong Ro, a spokesman for the
Unification Ministry, which organizes such events, said applicants are
selected for reunions by a lottery, although priority is given to those
older than 65.</TE>
<TE>   The spokesman said it is hoped that this round of reunions will be
larger than the previous ones.</TE>

<HD>Maverick Lawmaker Rests His Case in Corruption Trial</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ohio Rep. James Traficant's unorthodox self-defense
highlights a legal saga as unusual as the man himself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND
</DL>
<LD>In the last week of his trial on federal corruption charges,
Congressman James A. Traficant Jr. has angrily dropped things on the
floor, stormed from the courtroom, mocked the prosecutors and proudly
proclaimed that he never opened the box of evidence they turned over to
him.</LD>
<LD>   Still, Friday morning he managed the seemingly impossible in his
tangled, unpredictable, unlawyerly self-defense. The first words out of
his mouth surprised even veterans of this nine-week trial who said they
had come to expect almost anything.</LD>
<LD>   "The defense rests," said Traficant, who chose to represent himself
despite his lack of a law degree.</LD>
<TE>   With that, he drew gasps from those watching the courtroom theatrics
of the nine-term Democratic representative from a working-class district
in northeast Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   The day before, the self-described "son of a truck driver" seemed
poised for a legal filibuster of sorts. He had run out of witnesses in
five of the last eight days. Those he did call in his two-week-long
defense were asked repetitious questions between long pauses. Some of his
witnesses seemed to buttress the government's case, not his. By Thursday,
even longtime supporters such as Bill Allen, a constituent and neighbor
who drove an hour and a half to attend the trial, grimaced.</TE>
<TE>   "He's stalling, sure he is," said Allen, shaking his head. "But he
don't want to face the music on this one."</TE>
<TE>   Traficant faces up to 63 years in prison and more than $2 million in
fines if convicted on 10 counts of an indictment that includes charges of
racketeering, tax evasion and accepting bribes and kickbacks. He is the
latest target of a Mahoning Valley corruption probe that has led to the
convictions of more than 70 people, including a now-deceased top aide to
Traficant.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations against Traficant include kickbacks involving a member
of his congressional staff. Prosecutors say the staffer gave back to his
boss half of his $2,500 salary in cash each month. There are charges that
other staffers shoveled horse manure and baled hay at his Ohio farm on
government time and that Mafiosi offered services in exchange for
government contracts.</TE>
<TE>   In his own way, Traficant has acknowledged the seriousness of the
charges. "They're not trying to find out whether Ronald McDonald ate at
Burger King here!" he said.</TE>
<TE>   But that hasn't stopped him from raising a wide range of odd matters:
his broken-down houseboat that has no working toilet, the anatomy of a
horse, and this demand of nearly everyone he questioned or
cross-examined: "Did I ever hug you?"</TE>
<TE>   This week, U.S. District Judge Lesley Brooks Wells appeared to have
had enough. She warned the 60-year-old congressman Wednesday that the
next time he had no one to put on the stand he would either have to call
himself or rest his case.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility that the flamboyant congressman might question himself
Thursday (the rules would have required him to begin each query with
"Question:") had not only packed the ornate gilded courtroom where the
trial is being held but also left people standing in the hallway outside
the overflow room.</TE>
<TE>   This, after all, is the same man who often closes his soliloquies on
the floor of the House of Representatives with the words, "Beam me up,
Mr. Speaker."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Traficant cobbled together another day of defense witnesses.
Old acquaintances, who stopped in to wish him well, found themselves
instantly subpoenaed and called to testify on behalf of Traficant's
character.</TE>
<TE>   They included Edward W. Nishnic, the son-in-law of John Demjanjuk, a
man whom Traficant helped bring back to the U.S. in 1993 after the
Israeli Supreme Court dismissed charges that he should be brought to
trial for being the Nazi prison guard "Ivan the Terrible."</TE>
<TE>   Nishnic offered kind words about the congressman, gamely trying to
find new adjectives to describe the congressman's character after he was
asked virtually the same question at least a dozen times.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't stop," Traficant urged, as his witness looked to the judge for
guidance once he had run out of things to say. "Keep going."</TE>
<TE>   Traficant's amateur lawyering led him to base nearly every objection
on the "Constitution of the United States" and throw legal jargon such as
"double jeopardy" out at irrelevant moments.</TE>
<TE>   Observers say he has been given far more leeway by Wells than would
have been accorded any hired lawyer. Traficant, however, berated her
repeatedly for siding with the prosecution. After resting his case
Friday, he moved that the charges be dismissed on the grounds that she
had violated his rights. Among other complaints, Traficant said she had
erred by not allowing his "vendetta theory" defense that government
prosecutors and law enforcement officials have been out to get him for 20
years.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a bull's-eye on my back and vise on my chest," he said before
offering a lukewarm apology for his "unusual" behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant, who worked without any formal legal assistance, seemed to
be betting that the jury will see him as the little guy battling a
powerful government.</TE>
<TE>   The same strategy earned him an acquittal when, as an elected Mahoning
County sheriff, he defended himself in 1983 against federal bribery
charges. Then the government had him on tape taking more than $100,000
from known mob members--a fact he explained by saying that he was
conducting his own undercover sting operation.</TE>
<TE>   As late as Thursday he had held out the possibility that he would take
the stand. Speaking just off the courthouse steps after the close of the
day's session, a single strand of hair flapping loose from the shellacked
salt-and-pepper concoction piled high on his head like a bird's plumage,
Traficant had vowed to call at least five character witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, he said, he could not be sure what he would do next.</TE>
<TE>   Closing arguments are scheduled for Monday.</TE>

<HD>GOP to Press for Tax Relief</HD>
<DH>Legislation: House leaders will seek to make the Bush cuts
permanent and push new safeguards for taxpayers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As taxpayers approach their annual day of reckoning, House
Republicans plan to act on two bills in the next two weeks that would
bolster taxpayer rights and make permanent last year's major tax cuts.</LD>
<LD>   The votes, on either side of April 15, will enable the GOP to
spotlight its stance on taxes in an election year when many voters are
worried about a still-fragile economy.</LD>
<LD>   Both bills are favored to win approval in the Republican-led House,
though the vote on tax cuts could be close. But while the taxpayer-rights
bill attracts broad bipartisan support with such provisions as a 15-day
deadline extension for taxpayers who file electronically, the tax cut
bill is likely to hit a brick wall in the Democrat-controlled Senate.</LD>
<TE>   Most congressional Democrats contend that the federal budget should
not sustain any more significant losses of revenue after last year's
10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut championed by President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the partisan conflict over taxes, Congress faces
debates over energy, trade, election reform and other bills when it
returns next week from spring break.</TE>
<TE>   With both chambers narrowly divided and lawmakers increasingly
distracted by the congressional elections in November, many substantial
bills face a steep climb to win enactment.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has passed two major bills this year that won Bush's
signature. One extended unemployment benefits and widened business tax
breaks; the second overhauled federal campaign law for the first time in
a generation.</TE>
<TE>   Others could break through. The Senate is close to passing legislation
to revamp voting systems nationwide, a response to the 2000 election
controversies. The House passed a similar bill late last year, and Bush
is pushing for accord.</TE>
<TE>   Trade legislation is also nearing Senate action. But at least two
obstacles confront a bill Bush wants to enhance his trade negotiating
power. First, Senate Democrats want to expand aid to workers in domestic
industries harmed by international trade. And second, two House
Republicans--Reps. Dana Rohrabacher of Huntington Beach and Duncan Hunter
of Alpine--who supported Bush in a narrow one-vote victory on the trade
bill in December are signaling that they would probably vote against his
position if the question comes up again.</TE>
<TE>   On energy, the Senate has nearly exhausted itself after weeks of
debate. Republicans may push for a vote on a controversial oil-drilling
proposal in Alaska, but the effort is expected to fail. It also remains
unclear whether the Senate and the House will be able to reconcile key
differences on energy production and conservation.</TE>
<TE>   Other issues likely to get congressional scrutiny in coming weeks
include pension reform, wartime spending, immigration, domestic security
and human cloning.</TE>
<TE>   For Republicans, the coming tax deadline provides a platform to
promote their vision of taxpayer relief.</TE>
<TE>   The taxpayer-rights bill, approved by the House Ways and Means
Committee on a bipartisan 34-6 vote, is expected to come to the floor by
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would give taxpayers new safeguards against what critics of
the IRS call unfair collection procedures, take steps to protect the
privacy of tax records and authorize new funding for low-income tax
assistance clinics.</TE>
<TE>   It also would encourage more taxpayers to file returns and pay bills
electronically instead of through paper mail, by extending the deadline
for "e-filers" to April 30, from next year onward.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield), chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, said the revision was not expected to cost the government any
money and would promote its goal of paperless tax filing. Currently,
about 45 million federal income tax returns are filed electronically out
of a total of 132 million returns. "You've got to get them to try it once
to see if they'll do it again," Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also would ease reporting requirements for some tax-exempt
state and local political groups, changing a 2000 law that aimed to shine
a light on certain political entities perceived as "stealth" operators.
Some proponents of that law are criticizing the new move as a rollback of
campaign reform, but Thomas said his proposal would ensure disclosure at
the federal, state or local levels.</TE>
<TE>   In the following week, Republican leaders plan to move another bill to
make the Bush tax cut permanent, said Terry Holt, spokesman for House
Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   That cut included across-the-board reductions in income tax rates, tax
reductions for married couples, a phaseout of the estate tax and other
breaks. But under the law, crafted to meet congressional rules that
allowed a simple majority Senate vote for passage, all of the cuts expire
Dec. 31, 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Now Republicans aim to kill that sunset clause. "It's a big issue for
Republicans and the president," Holt said, "and an even bigger issue for
the economy overall."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats protest that extending the cuts will force the government to
use funds meant for Social Security and Medicare. "It's a 'pay-me-now or
pay-me-later' scenario," said Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), a
member of the Ways and Means Committee. "We don't have the money. We're
in deficit. It's a matter of fiscal prudence."</TE>

<HD>Detainee Who May Be American Flown to U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Yasser Esam Hamdi, who officials believe may be a second American
Taliban fighter, was flown Friday to the United States as the military
continued to review whether he was born here and should be handed over to
federal law enforcement for prosecution.</LD>
<LD>   The 22-year-old was taken under heavy guard from the U.S. naval base
at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to a naval base at Norfolk, Va. Authorities have
found a birth certificate that appears to verify his claim that he was
born in Baton Rouge, La.</LD>
<LD>   Military officials have not determined conclusively that Hamdi is an
American citizen. He may carry Saudi Arabian citizenship, since he was
virtually raised there after his parents returned to their home country
upon his birth.</LD>
<TE>   The possibility also exists that he has dual citizenship, and it is
unclear how that would affect his fate, since President Bush has mandated
that no war detainees who are Americans will stand trial before a
military tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   Hamdi was captured in Afghanistan after a late November prison riot
there and soon began protesting to the U.S. military that he is an
American native. He was then brought to Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Hamdi will remain in isolation at the base in Virginia
because it may take some time to sort out his background.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the likelihood that Hamdi is an American citizen, it was deemed
appropriate to move him to the United States as a captured enemy
combatant," said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. "He
remains in the control of the Department of Defense."</TE>
<TE>   But Army Gen. Tommy Franks, who is running the Afghan war, said "we
don't know for sure" about Hamdi's nationality.</TE>
<TE>   "When we historically, going back several months, have detained
people, in many cases they lie to us--oh, perish the thought," he said.
"In some cases they're simply not willing . . . to tell us much at all.</TE>
<TE>   "And so if you were to ask me, 'Are there any who speak English?' I
would probably say there are some who speak English. Are there any that I
believe are Americans? I will tell you, not that I know of right now."</TE>
<TE>   Regarding Hamdi, the general said that his status "will unfold in the
days ahead as judgments are made in Washington about what the correct
handling of this detainee is.</TE>
<TE>   "I've read the reports, but I am not on the inside of the thinking
about what the next step should be with this man," Franks said. He noted
that, though Hamdi speaks English, many unanswered questions remain about
his claim.</TE>
<TE>   Hamdi's situation is different, though, from that of John Walker Lindh
of Northern California, who was captured with Hamdi after the prison
uprising at Mazar-i-Sharif. Lindh's U.S. citizenship is not in question,
and he has been indicted on murder conspiracy charges and will go to
trial in federal court this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Hamdi was one of 300 detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Franks said an
additional 236 detainees are at several U.S. military locations in
Afghanistan.</TE>

complaining that the last three years "have just been a living hell."</LD>
<LD>   "It was Columbine, basically. You've got a tar baby that no matter who

<LD>It's just a squeegee, but it's going to the Smithsonian
Institution. And what a story goes with it.</LD>
<LD>   Window washer Jan Demczur was on a break when the first hijacked plane
slammed into the north tower of the World Trade Center, trapping him and
five other men in an elevator on the 50th floor.</LD>
<LD>   When they managed to pry open the elevator doors, instead of an exit
they found a wall. Demczur used the blade of his squeegee to carve a hole
through which they could crawl. It took 45 minutes, then the men raced
down a stairwell to safety before the tower collapsed.</LD>

<LD>William Gray, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State

major.</LD>
<LD>   Typically during the June-through-October hurricane season, there are
about 10 named storms, with six hurricanes, two of them major. A major
hurricane has sustained winds of at least 111 mph.</LD>
<LD>   Gray also told the 2002 National Hurricane Conference in Orlando,

<HD>Governor Sues Ethics Panel Over Gift Rules</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Mike Huckabee sued the state Ethics Commission, seeking to
halt its investigation into whether he illegally accepted $9,000 in gifts
last year.</LD>
<LD>   Huckabee, a Republican who is running for his second full term, asked
the court to declare the state law regulating gifts to public servants
unconstitutionally vague.</LD>
<LD>   Although there are exceptions, the commission said the law prohibits
gifts worth more than $100 to public servants.</LD>
<TE>   Huckabee's lawyer, Kevin Crass, accused the commission of interpreting
the gift rules arbitrarily, claiming it did not pursue the case of state
Land Commissioner Charlie Daniels, who reported receiving a gift worth
$700 from his staff in 2000.</TE>

<HD>Plan to Mine Clay for Litter Boxes Stirs Cat Fight in Desert</HD>
<DH>Land use: Indians, environmentalists are teaming up to fight
proposal for two mines and a processing plant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HUNGRY VALLEY, Nev.
</DL>
<LD>On this powdery brown expanse of Nevada desert, an Indian tribe, a
Chicago mining company and environmentalists are struggling over a mother
lode of kitty litter.</LD>
<LD>   Led by Indians who have spent $200,000 to block two clay mines and a
cat litter processing plant, opponents say the operation will mar the
landscape, generating truck traffic, noise and dust.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest maker of cat litter, which secured a permit to
mine on federal land, says it can solve those problems and believes it
has hit pay dirt--clay that offers the ideal density, color and
absorption needed to keep cats and their owners content.</LD>
<TE>   But the Sierra Club and other environmental groups, enlisted by the
Reno Sparks Indian Colony, believe they have struck pay dirt too: The
mine has become the ideal target for their years-long campaign against a
19th century mining law.</TE>
<TE>   Signed by President Ulysses S. Grant, the 1872 Mining Act was
originally meant to encourage development of the West. But the law, which
didn't levy mineral royalties or impose environmental responsibilities,
is today considered by some a giveaway of valuable resources to the big
mining companies that came to replace the lone prospectors of the Old
West.</TE>
<TE>   The law allows for mining on federal land if the mineral in question
can be proved "uncommon."</TE>
<TE>   And the clay of Hungry Valley was so deemed.</TE>
<TE>   "If this were some metal needed for national security, that would be
one thing," said John Singlaub, Carson City field office manager for the
Bureau of Land Management, which is responsible for approving mining
claims.</TE>
<TE>   "But cat litter so our cats can poop in the house? That's the thing I
think is really odd about this whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   Odd, but not necessarily surprising, because cat litter is big
business. Each year the 67 million American households with cats spend
nearly $1 billion on it. Litter boxes, litter box liners--even
self-cleaning litter boxes--have become part of the pet business. Even
kitty litter, technically the trade name Kitty Litter, has become part of
the American vocabulary.</TE>
<TE>   The point man for the Oil-Dri Corp., which has proposed the mines,
admits it sometimes sounds absurd to think such a brouhaha could be
caused by cat litter. And telling your son you make cat litter, he said,
is not the same as being a doctor or firefighter.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to have a pretty thick skin, a sense of humor, in this
business," said Bob Vetere, Oil-Dri's vice president and general counsel.
"And especially after three years with this project."</TE>
<TE>   The land from which the clay would be mined is owned by the BLM, which
issues a permit. But it generally does so only after local and state
governments with jurisdiction over related matters sign off.</TE>
<TE>   Hungry Valley, about 10 miles outside Reno, consists of thousands of
acres of treeless cocoa-brown dirt covered with a stubble of scruffy
brush. On the tribe's 1,960 acres live about half the tribe's 1,000
residents. The proposed mines are about a mile away from houses.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the federally owned acreage neighboring the tribe's land will
remain unmined. And for that, members of the tiny Reno Sparks Indian
Colony say they are thankful. But they are scanning the horizon, they
say, knowing they have a tough fight ahead.</TE>
<TE>   In late February, the Washoe County Board of Commissioners denied
Oil-Dri Corp. a special-use permit for a processing plant it wants to
build on 60 acres it bought next to the federal land. The BLM then
withdrew its permit, because the company would need to propose a
different way to process the litter.</TE>
<TE>   One option would be building the processing plant on federal land
beside one of the mines, which the law allows, Singlaub said. The other
option would be to truck out the raw ore to an off-site processing plant.</TE>
<TE>   Next week, the company will meet with BLM officials to discuss yet
more studies. A new environmental impact report is needed to assess the
effects of processing the litter on BLM land or trucking it away. The
study is expected to take at least a year.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the Reno Sparks Indian Colony--which originally formed in
Reno but in the late 1980s spread to 1,960 acres it bought in Hungry
Valley--feel triumphant.</TE>
<TE>   They said they are protecting the way of life of their people, who
have lived in the Nevada desert for thousands of years.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning, we were on the outskirts of Reno, and the city
encroached right up to our edge," said Diana Coffey, 42, among four
generations living in the colony, which was formed around 1916. (A colony
is a Nevada term for what would elsewhere be called a reservation.)</TE>
<TE>   "I want my grandbabies to have this land, and a lot of this has
remained untouched for thousands of years," Coffey said, a soft breeze
blowing through the valley. "Our people never had written language, so
everything was handed down from showing and telling in stories. That
means it needs to be quiet."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists dispute the volumes of government studies and
assessments that found the impact on air quality, water quality and
traffic would not justify denying the mining permit, Singlaub said. Ellen
Pillard, president of the Sierra Club's Nevada chapter most involved in
the mining fight, said the tribe has led the drive against the operation.
But she and tribal council leaders say both groups realized they could
help each other.</TE>
<TE>   The supporting cast of this ongoing drama has also included discount
giant Wal-Mart and Clorox, Oil-Dri's Vetere said. The corporations are
driving the search for a Western source of coveted clay to cut the cost
of shipping 280 million pounds of litter annually from mines in the East.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based Oil-Dri, founded by the man who claims to have invented
cat litter, reported $170 million in litter sales last year.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, such a company would favor mining rights. But others, even
the Bureau of Land Management's Singlaub, wonder whether modern times
have rendered the Mining Act outdated.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, you have to question why we have a law on the books that
would allow nondiscretionary mining," Singlaub said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>One juror and several relatives of victims were overcome by emotion
and left the courtroom Friday after seeing graphic photographs and a
police video of seven people gunned down in an office massacre.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors presented the images on the first day of testimony in the
trial of Michael McDermott, accused of shooting seven colleagues at
Edgewater Technology Inc. because he was angry over the company's plan to
withhold some of his wages to pay back taxes.</LD>
<LD>   McDermott, 43, admits he went on the shooting rampage at the Wakefield
office the day after Christmas 2000 but says he's not criminally
responsible because he suffers from schizophrenia and was insane.</LD>
<TE>   The video showed a hole McDermott blasted in the door of Edgewater's
accounting office. Inside, he killed payroll manager Rose Manfredi, who
would have been the one to withhold his wages, and another employee, Paul
Marceau.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Bohrer, the company's former chief financial officer, was
nearby in her office when she heard the first shots. She said she hid
beneath her desk as the shots grew louder and she heard a woman scream.</TE>
<TE>   She emerged and saw co-worker Jennifer Capobianco slumped at her desk
"like she was sleeping." There was blood on her tan slacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept thinking they were gunshots, but then I thought it couldn't
be," she said, her voice cracking.</TE>
<TE>   She hid under her desk again and emerged only when she heard police.
She saw Linda Tessier come out of the accounting office, the scene of
most of the carnage.</TE>
<TE>   "Her face was white as a ghost. She looked like a zombie," Bohrer
testified. "I started to cry and I said, 'Where's Rose? Where's Rose?'
She said, 'He shot her. The bastard shot her. It was Michael McDermott.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Bohrer also testified that she and Cheryl Troy had met two weeks
earlier with McDermott and offered to help mediate his tax problems with
the Internal Revenue Service. She said he was visibly upset about the IRS
lien and asked them to prove that the company had to comply. He would
take home $276 every other week of his $55,000 annual salary until the
$5,586 was paid off.</TE>
<TE>   "He was still not satisfied that we had to do this," Bohrer said.</TE>
<TE>   McDermott, in a prison jumpsuit with unkempt, shoulder-length hair and
a massive beard, read a Bible through much of the testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say McDermott systematically killed his victims with an
AK-47 and a pump-action shotgun.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Thomas O'Reilly told jurors in his opening statements that
McDermott spent Christmas Day with his family, then brought a stockpile
of guns and ammunition to his office that night. The next day, he chatted
amiably with several co-workers, then pulled two guns out of a large
black bag and began shooting, O'Reilly said.</TE>

<HD>Clippers Must Put Up or Players Won't Shut Up</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers' biggest challenge is more difficult to deal with than
Shaq in the low post or Stockton to Malone on the pick-and-roll.
They're battling their own history, their culture, the stigma of the
franchise.</LD>
<LD>   They haven't won anything. They haven't done anything to make a
long-term commitment to the future. And until they do they'll be
susceptible to the type of external criticisms they get on a daily
basis and even the internal blast they received from Michael
Olowokandi this week.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe the Clippers' reaction--they hit Olowokandi with a $50,000
fine Friday--shows that they're ready to change. But unless they step
up and spend some money of their own, the only precedent they've set
is that players now will have to pay for their remarks ... because
the shots will keep on coming.</LD>
<TE>   Agents doubt that owner Donald Sterling will come up with the loot
to keep this team together. Players around the league doubt it. And,
apparently, so do the players within the team's locker room.</TE>
<TE>   Don't underestimate the role a good reputation plays in the world
of free agency. It helped the Lakers attract and retain the right
complementary pieces to help Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant win two
championships (not to mention Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's
five titles before them). It's helped the San Antonio Spurs remain in
the upper echelon of the league despite their small-market location.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers--a team players always seem to leave, with hope
following them out the door--don't get that credit. Olowokandi hit on
that when the Clippers lost at Utah Wednesday, a game that threw the
dirt on their season after a home loss to Utah four days earlier
lowered their coffin into the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "Players are playing for themselves because they're very uncertain
of their future with this team," Olowokandi said. "That's a fact.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever you have a group of guys that are very uncertain of
their futures on the team that will always happen. Whenever you have
that situation, you will never have a basketball team. Not this year,
not next year, not 10 years from now."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi will be a restricted free agent this summer, point
guard Jeff McInnis will be an unrestricted free agent, and Elton
Brand, Lamar Odom and Corey Maggette are eligible for contract
extensions.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers and Washington Wizards are
the only teams that will be far enough below the projected salary cap
of $42 million to offer significant money to Olowokandi. The Clippers
can retain him if they match the offer, which they're expected to do.</TE>
<TE>   The only automatic is to offer Brand the maximum contract
extension, more than $80 million for six years. If they can't do that
for a guy who can give them a steady 18 and 10, hold his own with all
the great power forwards in the Western Conference and match up with
any player in the character department, they'll never do it.</TE>
<TE>   I'd make trading Maggette the top priority this summer. If he
shoots almost every time he touches the ball now, imagine how he'd be
in a contract year.</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't be in such a rush to move Odom, but I also wouldn't max
him out after a season in which he battled injuries and his continued
off-court troubles.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis has clashed with Coach Alvin Gentry and he's not always
the best teammate. But he's given the Clippers what they need at the
point this season and come through in the clutch for a couple of
games. He's done it all on the $590,850 salary the Clippers picked up
when they could have let him become a free agent and renegotiated
with him.</TE>
<TE>   It's such account-friendly, goodwill-lacking moves that created
this environment. Olowokandi merely commented on it.</TE>
<TE>   However, he wasn't the best spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have had Olowokandi's back from the giddy-up. They
said they believed in him even when he was derided as one of the
worst No. 1 picks ever.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't hang him out there when he was arrested on domestic
violence charges in December, a case that was later dropped after the
accuser recanted the charges.</TE>
<TE>   He's finally rewarded them with real NBA center play the past
three months. He's aggressive and he's developed into their best
low-post option. When he shoots, you actually believe the ball has a
good chance to go in.</TE>
<TE>   But it's interesting that this didn't happen until he was in his
contract year. And now he's authorized to call out the organization?
And then follow it up by missing a team meeting the next morning?</TE>
<TE>   What Olowokandi and the other Clipper players have to realize is
that they'll never get anything they seek if they don't play their
best wherever they happen to be.</TE>
<TE>   "The free agents that become valuable are the guys that play on
winning teams," Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Elgin Baylor wanted to make a statement. The fine
was his call.</TE>
<TE>   If this signals a new era, that the Clippers are tired of people
trashing the organization, then good for Baylor. Now he and Sterling
have to get it right at the negotiating table.</TE>
<TE>   As Gentry said, "We will be judged by what happens between July
and August."</TE>
<TE>   That's how we'll remember this season.</TE>
<TE>   Even though they won't make the playoffs, 2001-02 wasn't a
failure. It was disappointing, a letdown even--kind of like the
episodes of E! network's "Wild On" when Jules Asner hosts instead of
Brooke Burke--but it still marked progress.</TE>
<TE>   Simply splitting their last six games would give them a nine-game
improvement over last year--and would mark a jump from 15 victories
to 40 in two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Letting the core of this team move on would take them back to the
same old spot, leaving them as the same old Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   They insist things are different now. Fining players who open
their mouths can't be the only change.</TE>

<HD>Even Bronx Cheers Missing for Giambi</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Cone might have been the only fan in Yankee Stadium not booing
Jason Giambi.</LD>
<LD>   Andy Pettitte put Tampa Bay in its place, pitching six scoreless
innings and leading New York to a 4-0 victory Friday in the Yankees'
100th home opener.</LD>
<LD>   There was plenty of pomp and pageantry as Yogi Berra, Phil Rizzuto
and Rudy Giuliani raised the American League championship banner. The
sellout crowd of 55,771 seemed to enjoy the entire show, except
Giambi's performance.</LD>
<TE>   "I just had a rough day," Giambi said.</TE>
<TE>   Giambi, signed in December for $120 million over seven years, was
razzed as he went 0 for 5, dropping to two for 16 with no runs batted
in.</TE>
<TE>   After he missed a scoop in his first game in pinstripes, there
were even chants of "Tino! Tino!"--a reference to the popular first
baseman he replaced, Tino Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to give them something to cheer about," Giambi said.
"Trust me, I'm getting on myself inside too."</TE>
<TE>   Giambi insisted the boos did not bother him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's OK, it's OK. It's part of the game," he said. "I'm the new
guy in town, and I expect great things from myself. It'll get going."</TE>
<TE>   Cone had a much more relaxing time. The one-time Yankee ace, still
looking for a team to sign him, sat in right-center field bleachers
with the fans who used to cheer him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty stress-free out here right now. It's a lot easier out
here than on that mound on opening day," he said in the middle of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has been really appreciative that a former player would
come out here and spend some times with the creatures," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays were trying to join the 1906 Brooklyn Dodgers and
the 1952 St. Louis Browns as the only teams to open at 4-0 after
losing 100 games the previous season.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 3, Baltimore 0--Derek Lowe fell six outs short of a
no-hitter, leaving after Tony Batista beat out a roller down the
third-base line in the Red Sox's victory at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   A former closer making only the 23rd start of his career, Lowe
walked Jay Gibbons to open the eighth. Batista then topped a ball
down the line that third baseman Shea Hillenbrand decided to grab
instead of allowing to roll any farther. But his throw was too late
to nail Batista at first.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, Toronto 3--David Ortiz and Torii Hunter hit
consecutive homers in the first inning at Toronto, and Rick Reed
combined with three relievers on a four-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Reed gave up a homer to Shannon Stewart on his first pitch but
would up giving up only one more run--Carlos Delgado's homer in the
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 5, Chicago 2--Mike Sweeney and Raul Ibanez drove in
two runs apiece and Paul Byrd pitched six innings as the Royals won
at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd gave up two runs and nine hits for his first victory since
Aug. 16 at Baltimore. It was only the second victory for the Royals
in their last 10 games against the White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 10, Detroit 1--Matt Lawton homered on the first pitch of
the game and Danys Baez pitched effectively despite walking six in
his first career start as the Indians won at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   A blustery, snowy day quickly became even more miserable for a
record crowd of 41,248 at Comerica Park when Detroit center fielder
Jose Macias misplayed Eddie Perez's double in the second, which
cleared the bases in a five-run inning that put the Indians ahead
6-0.</TE>

<HD>Angels Throw a Change at Texas</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Schoeneweis uses new pitch, different approach to
shut down Rangers in 3-1 win. Glaus hits two-run homer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>Attention, American League hitters: Before your team faces Scott
Schoeneweis for the first time this season, your batting coach will
haul out a video of the Angel starter from last season so you can be
prepared.</LD>
<LD>   Don't bother. It will be a waste of time.</LD>
<LD>   Schoeneweis is a different pitcher this season, and apparently a
much better one, as the Texas Rangers discovered to their dismay
Friday. Schoeneweis stifled one of the most potent lineups in
baseball, giving up five hits and coming within two outs of a
complete game.</LD>
<TE>   With the timely assistance of Troy Glaus, who delivered the
game-winning home run in the seventh inning, Schoeneweis and the
Angels posted a 3-1 victory before a sellout crowd of 49,617 at the
Rangers' home opener.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels almost suffered the indignity of losing to Ismael
Valdes, the talented but blister-prone pitcher they discarded after
last season. Although the Angels' heralded newcomers, Kevin Appier
and Aaron Sele, struggled in their first starts, Valdes carried a
two-hit shutout into the seventh. But Tim Salmon doubled and, one out
later, Glaus hit the Angels' first home run of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the first pitch he threw me that wasn't on a corner
somewhere," Glaus said.</TE>
<TE>   Angel catcher Bengie Molina, who singled home an insurance run in
the ninth inning, said Valdes pitched with the same sharp fastball he
had last season. "Probably the only different thing," Molina said
with a smile, "might be the [lack of] blisters."</TE>
<TE>   As Valdes fed the Angels a steady diet of fastballs--"His fastball
command was as good as I've ever seen it," Angel Manager Mike
Scioscia said--Schoeneweis confounded the Rangers by making a mockery
of their scouting reports.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Schoeneweis did not pitch inside or throw his
changeup effectively. He vowed to do both this season, worked
diligently on both in spring training, and followed through on his
promise Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis very nearly threw a shutout. The Rangers scored their
run in the second inning, on a sacrifice fly, with center fielder
Darin Erstad's throw arriving in time, but it was a few feet too far
up the third-base line to get Juan Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis very nearly threw a complete game. He made 92 pitches
through eight innings. Gabe Kapler doubled to start the ninth. With
the tying run at the plate, Scioscia allowed Schoeneweis to pitch to
Alex Rodriguez--and strike him out for the third time--and then
replaced him with Al Levine.</TE>
<TE>   Levine got Gonzalez to ground out, then Rafael Palmeiro flied out.
Levine had his first save, in place of injured Troy Percival.
Schoeneweis had his first victory, in his first start of a season he
has dedicated to developing beyond a .500 pitcher with a 5.00
earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers Friday were far more impressive--81/3 innings, five
hits, one walk, six strikeouts, 99 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "He can be that good every time he goes out," Molina said.</TE>
<TE>   That is because of another impressive number: 20. That's how many
changeups he threw Friday. Last season, he abandoned the pitch as
soon as it got hit. This season, he intends to stay the course, so
that opposing hitters have to worry about something besides a
fastball away and a sinker.</TE>
<TE>   And the Angels appeared tickled that Schoeneweis stuck to his game
plan--and succeeded--against a lineup that included Carl Everett
batting seventh. There's no room for him in the heart of this order,
not with Alex Rodriguez and Gonzalez and Palmeiro and Ivan Rodriguez
there.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys are hall of famers," Schoeneweis said. "To have them
back-to-back-to-back-to-back is a chore."</TE>
<TE>   The quartet went two for 14, with four strikeouts. With results
such as those, the change is a welcome pitch indeed.</TE>
<TE>   "I want it someday to be my second-best pitch," he said, "if not
my best pitch."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Percival, Gil Added to the Disabled List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>The Angels put closer Troy Percival and infielder Benji Gil on the
disabled list Friday, giving them four players on the disabled list
four games into the season.</LD>
<LD>   Gil suffered a sprained left ankle in the first inning Friday.
Percival, hampered by a strained rib cage since March 14, made his
season debut Tuesday and earned the save, but his velocity was down.
The Angels originally planned to postpone a decision to put Percival
on the disabled list until after he rested this weekend and tried
throwing again Monday, but Manager Mike Scioscia said the team
decided that timetable was too optimistic for an injury that can
linger for months.</LD>
<LD>   "The down side is too risky," Scioscia said. "This thing is going
to take a little more time than three to four days."</LD>
<TE>   The decision means that as the Angels play 19 consecutive games
against American League West opponents, their all-star closer will be
unavailable for at least the first 13 games of that stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Al Levine, who retired Juan Gonzalez and Rafael Palmeiro to earn
the save Friday, will be the primary closer in Percival's absence.
The Angels replenished their roster by promoting reliever Brendan
Donnelly and infielder Clay Bellinger from triple-A Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mo Vaughn apparently cursed the Angels on his way out of town,
muttering about the Angels' desire to make him a designated hitter.
If the Angels didn't want him to play first base for them, then no
one else would either.</TE>
<TE>   Got a better explanation? The Angels planned for Shawn Wooten and
Scott Spiezio to share first base, but Wooten is injured and Spiezio
is suspended. Now Gil, the interim first baseman, is injured too, and
the Angels could not even call up triple-A first baseman Larry Barnes
because he has a back injury.</TE>
<TE>   "It's crazy," Spiezio said.</TE>
<TE>   Gil got hurt after fielding a ground ball hit by the Rangers'
leadoff batter, Rusty Greer, then colliding with Greer while tagging
him out. Gil remained in the game as Gabe Kapler flied out, then
hobbled off the field with a 1-2 count to Gonzalez. Jose Nieves
replaced Gil at first base, and on the next pitch Gonzalez struck out
to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I kidded him--'Hey, man, don't be afraid to stay out there for
one more pitch,'" Angel pitcher Scott Schoeneweis said.</TE>

<HD>Maddux Goes on Disabled List</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Atlanta Brave right-hander Greg Maddux was put on the 15-day disabled
list for the first time in his career Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Maddux, who missed his opening-day assignment on Monday because of
an inflamed nerve in his lower back, received a cortisone shot on
Wednesday and had been expected to start on Sunday against the Mets.</LD>
<LD>   He threw in the bullpen on Thursday and said he felt he was ready
to go. But the Braves announced after their 9-3 loss to the New York
Mets on Friday night that Maddux would be sidelined.</LD>
<TE>   The four-time NL Cy Young Award winner is eligible to be activated
on April 10.</TE>

<TE>   Pedro Martinez thinks Toronto Manager Buck Martinez was uninformed
and out of line for criticizing the pitcher's brief appearance in the
Blue Jays' clubhouse Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Buck Martinez was angry that the Boston pitcher dropped by the
Toronto locker room during a rain delay at Fenway Park.</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Martinez explained that Fenway Park security ushered him
through the visitor's clubhouse to avoid a crush of people after the
pitcher greeted fans during pregame ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baseball's top labor lawyer called Forbes' analysis of the sport's
finances, which shows a $75-million operating profit instead of a
$232-million operating loss, "the type of journalism one expects from
a supermarket tabloid."</TE>
<TE>   Forbes responded by saying the sport's accounting "simply did not
make sense in some cases" and said the magazine "stands firmly behind
its figures."</TE>
<TE>   "Not only does the article contain wildly inaccurate financial
information, but more important it was written in total disregard of
actual audited financial information that we provided to the
authors," management lawyer Rob Manfred wrote in a letter to Forbes.</TE>

<TE>   Washington Redskin owner Dan Snyder and Black Entertainment
Television founder Robert Johnson have joined forces to try to buy a
team to bring to the Washington area.... Moises Alou, the Chicago
Cubs' major off-season acquisition, was put on the 15-day disabled
list with a strained right calf. It is the third consecutive season
that Alou has gone to the DL with an injury to his right calf.... The
New York Mets acquired Montreal closer Scott Strickland, sending
Bruce Chen to the Expos. The teams also traded two minor leaguers.</TE>

<LD>The baseball collectibles market is getting a bit sticky. A wad of
bubble gum supposedly chewed and spit out by Luis Gonzalez of the
Arizona Diamondbacks has been up for bid on the Web site
www.nocontraction.com.</LD>
<LD>   On March 7, Gonzalez singled in the first inning of a spring
training game against the Oakland A's at Tucson Electric Park, then
promptly discarded the gum. Jason Gabbert, sitting in the first row
behind first base, asked a security guard to retrieve the used gum,
then put it in a golf ball collector's case, where it currently
resides.</LD>
<LD>   Gabbert said the auction started a week ago at $20 and, thanks to
radio talk shows, the top bid Friday was $600. But a Tucson disc
jockey said an unidentified bidder promised to cough up $2,000 for
the gum on Monday. Proceeds from the auction benefit the athletics
program at Lakeview High School in Cottonwood, Minn.</LD>
<TE>   More on gum: In 1993, Gabbert was convicted of forgery in North
Dakota after opening a bank account in major league pitcher Aaron
Sele's name.</TE>
<TE>   Gabbert said he hopes his mistake years ago doesn't create doubt
of the gum's connection to Gonzalez, who said: "People are crazy, or
at least a little weird. I'm scared to go to a restaurant now and
take a napkin or something."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the Laker playoff leader in three-point shots?</TE>
<TE>   Music meanie: John Fay of the Cincinnati Enquirer reports that
Reds' Manager Bob Boone has instituted a no-music policy in the
clubhouse before games.</TE>
<TE>   "For one thing, it bothers me," Boone said. "Some players like it.
It helps them get ready for the game. Others don't. I say that's why
God invented headphones."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Nice Guy: Seattle Seahawk Coach Mike Holmgren says he's
changing his image this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm no longer a bully or a control freak," he said. "I'm going to
be a touchy-feely kind of guy."</TE>
<TE>   Touchy-feely? Uh, oh.</TE>
<TE>   Slow down, Mo: From Michael Ventre of MSNBC.com: "In a New York
Post story, Mo Vaughn of the Mets ripped former teammate Troy
Percival and his former team, the Angels, in a tirade that included
35 expletives. The Mets looked on the bright side, however, pointing
out that the more time Mo spends spewing four-letter words, the less
time he spends eating."</TE>
<TE>   Arise, robots! PGA Tour player Frank Lickliter, commenting after
tour officials issued a statement expressing concern that recent
public displays of temper by players during tournaments could harm
golf's reputation: "If I wanted to be a robot, I'd sit behind a desk
for a living."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1973, the American League began using
the designated hitter when the New York Yankees' Ron Bloomberg drew a
first-inning walk in a game at Fenway Park.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Michael Cooper, with 124. Byron Scott is second
with 116.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bob Knight will be back in Indiana this weekend,
signing copies of his new book at bookstores in Bloomington and
Indianapolis. Bookstore staff will wear striped referee shirts and
extra security has been ordered to handle the thousands of fans
expected.</TE>
<TE>   Said Nick Stark, a clerk in the Indianapolis store: "People are
stoked about it. They've been asking, 'Is he going to throw chairs at
us?'"</TE>

<HD>Hearn Hints About Retiring in 2003</HD>

<LD>Chick Hearn says that for the first time he is seriously thinking
about retirement, hinting Friday that he might call it a career after
next season.</LD>
<LD>   "I hope to go one more year," he said, "and then we'll see what
happens."</LD>
<LD>   Hearn, off the air since heart surgery Dec. 19 and now recovering
from hip surgery, intends to return to his announcing duties Tuesday,
when the Lakers play host to the Utah Jazz.</LD>
<TE>   Hearn said he will not take calls from fans on KLAC's "Laker Line"
call-in show.</TE>
<TE>   "At least not for the remainder of this year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn's thinking regarding retirement came to light during taping
of an in-depth interview with KLAC's Larry Burnett for his "Laker
Zone" pregame show. The first segment aired Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn, 85, had worked 3,338 consecutive Laker games, dating to
1965, before the streak was broken by the heart surgery.</TE>
<TE>   He suffered a broken hip when he fell at a service station Feb.
17.</TE>

<HD>All Is Not Fine for Clippers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Team docks Olowokandi $50,000 for his
critical comments about contract situation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Center Michael Olowokandi was fined $50,000 by the Clippers on Friday
after criticizing his lack of a contract for next season and calling
his uncertain future a distraction. Now, it seems Olowokandi may be
the distraction.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Elgin Baylor said the fine was warranted for
Olowokandi's "recent counterproductive and selfish public comments,
which we consider to be detrimental to our team's best interests."</LD>
<LD>   Baylor, who was scouting collegiate players at a tournament in
Portsmouth, Va., declined further comment.</LD>
<TE>   Olowokandi's comments came as the Clippers were all but eliminated
from the Western Conference playoff race. Among other things,
Olowokandi said after Wednesday's loss to the Utah Jazz:</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't play well together. Whenever you have a group of guys
that are very uncertain of their futures on the team, that will
always happen. Whenever you have that situation, you will never have
a basketball team. Not this year, not next year, not 10 years from
now. We had a situation tonight where everyone was just going on
their own. It wasn't good."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi said that after the Clippers fell behind the Jazz,
22-9, he didn't want to play anymore. He said he was frustrated by
teammates' freelancing style of play. He missed 13 of 15 shots during
the game and had seven points.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't the first time Olowokandi spoke out about his contract
situation. In recent weeks, he made similar comments to two national
magazines. He was more cautious during a recent interview with The
Times, but said the last time he spoke with his agent, Bill Duffy,
"[Duffy] said, not in so many words, that I'm pretty much out of here
after the season."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi went on to say, "Right now, I'm focusing on the playoff
race. I'd hate to be distracted by talk [of a new contract]. It's for
the team and my agent to talk about" during the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Thursday's 25-point loss to the Dallas Mavericks, a
nationally televised game. After Olowokandi missed a free throw,
guard Quentin Richardson approached him to offer encouragement before
the second one. But Olowokandi shoved him away.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier that day, he skipped the team's mandatory breakfast and
Coach Alvin Gentry benched him to start the game against the
Mavericks. Olowokandi, who said he missed the meal because he wished
to sleep late, scored a team-leading 19 points in 34 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   During a March 26 game against the Sacramento Kings, which also
was on national TV, Olowokandi became so angry about a referee's
ruling against him that he kicked the ball the length of the court,
drawing a technical foul.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the Clippers' loss March 15 to the Lakers, Olowokandi and
Shaquille O'Neal almost came to blows after a confrontation along the
free-throw lane. Each player received his second technical foul of
the game and was ejected. Later, Olowokandi suggested it was time for
O'Neal "to grow up."</TE>
<TE>   There have been off-court troubles, too. Olowokandi was arrested
Dec. 1 after a scuffle with a former girlfriend at his Manhattan
Beach home. The Los Angeles County District Attorney later declined
to file charges against him.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his recent on-court displays of anger, or perhaps because
of them, Olowokandi has showed vast improvement. In March, he
averaged 16.8 points and 10.7 rebounds--the best month in four NBA
seasons for the former No. 1 overall pick in the draft.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor said last week that he hoped to retain Olowokandi's
services for next season and beyond because the 7-foot center is
"vital to the future of this franchise."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi's contract talks are likely to be viewed as an
indication of just how serious the franchise is about building a
competitive club after years of losing.</TE>

<HD>Motorcyclist Dies at California Speedway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Motorcyclist Ricky Lundgren of La Mesa was killed Friday after he
crashed midway through a late afternoon qualifying session for this
weekend's Yamaha Superbike Challenge at California Speedway in
Fontana.</LD>
<LD>   Lundgren, 40, was airlifted to Loma Linda University Medical
Center. The flight takes less than eight minutes. He arrived at the
hospital at 6:05 p.m. and was pronounced dead at 6:25 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   According to Dr. Jeff Grange, medical director of the Speedway,
Lundgren suffered blunt trauma to the head and chest.</LD>
<TE>   Lundgren is the second fatality at the speedway. Canadian driver
Greg Moore died in 1999 after his car smashed cockpit-first into a
retaining wall during the Marlboro 500 CART race. The speedway opened
in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Lundgren's accident occurred during qualifying for this
afternoon's scheduled 17-lap Genuine Suzuki Accessories Superstock
Race, about 3 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   This is one of five American Motorcyclist Assn. classes racing
during the weekend on the new infield road course. The course has 21
turns over 2.3 miles.</TE>
<TE>   There were 36 riders attempting to qualify during the session,
with their best lap determining their starting position. Lundgren was
on his fourth lap of the session when he crashed. His best lap speed
was on Lap 3, when he averaged 83.152 mph, the 31st best time
overall.</TE>
<TE>   The motorcycles are capable of speeds up to 160 mph on the front
straightaway of the speedway's two-mile oval, but Lundgren was not
going nearly that fast after he had pulled off the oval and begun
negotiating its series of turns.</TE>
<TE>   He had gone through a sharp left-right combination in Turns 3 and
4, and was accelerating out of one of the slowest areas on the track.
Although details were sketchy, Lundgren, riding a 750cc Suzuki,
apparently made contact with Jeff Tigert, also on a Suzuki. Tigert
was unhurt.</TE>
<TE>   Lundgren's family was not in attendance but had been notified,
track officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Final qualifying Friday didn't begin until 5:30 because moisture
on the track had delayed earlier qualifying by 90 minutes. But track
officials said darkness was not a factor in Lundgren's crash.</TE>
<TE>   "From a safety standpoint, we would have stopped qualifying if we
thought [darkness] was an issue," track spokesman Dennis Bickmeier
said. "We're still collecting information at this point. I'm at a
loss for words."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bill Miller, president of the track: "Our thoughts and
prayers are with the Lundgren family and our sincerest condolences go
out to the entire racing community.</TE>
<TE>   "We will observe a moment of silence during the invocation prior
to [today's] superbike race."</TE>
<TE>   Lundgren was sponsored by Yahoo Sports, MotoworldRacing.com and
Advanced Motorsports.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Gobert was first in qualifying Friday at Fontana at 97.124
mph; second-round qualifying is scheduled for this morning.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Roberts, son of former world champion Kenny Roberts,
suffered knee and ankle injuries and was flown to Loma Linda
University Hospital for X-rays.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers See Big Picture at Last, 9-0</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After scoring two runs in three games, they
overpower Rockies as Karros, Green drive in six runs with two swings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This whole little-ball approach was producing Lilliputian results, so
Eric Karros and Shawn Green took matters into their own hands Friday
night.</LD>
<LD>   With one extra-large swing of the bat in the second inning and
another in the fourth, the Dodgers' first baseman and right fielder
each produced more runs than the team scored in its first three games
combined.</LD>
<LD>   Karros cranked a three-run home run to left-center field in the
second, ending the Dodgers' 25-inning scoreless streak. Green ripped
a three-run double to right in the fourth, and the Dodgers found
their way to the win column for the first time this season with a 9-0
pasting of the Colorado Rockies before 25,091 in Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Right-hander Andy Ashby, making his first start since last April
12, was also triumphant in his return from season-ending elbow
surgery, blanking the Rockies on one hit and striking out five in
seven innings to provide a much-needed boost for a rotation that took
some lumps this week.</TE>
<TE>   Ashby, who spent eight long months rehabilitating his elbow, was
masterful, mixing his sinking fastballs with curves and
cut-fastballs, and he even hit 92 mph on a strike-three fastball to
Ben Petrick in the third inning. The only hit Ashby gave up was a
lined single to right by Todd Zeile in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   When Ashby returned to the locker room after the game, he found a
1972 bottle of Dom Perignon champagne, courtesy of Dodger clubhouse
attendants, on ice in his cubicle.</TE>
<TE>   "I might drink it [today], or I might just hang onto it, I don't
know," Ashby said, his voice filling with emotion as he stared at the
bottle. "That means a lot to me. It's really neat. Maybe I should
give it to the offense and let them drink it. That's what I should
do."</TE>
<TE>   It would be well deserved. The Dodgers had 11 hits, including five
doubles, a triple and a home run, falling one hit short of the
combined hit total in their first three games. Karros added a double
in the fourth inning and a single in the fifth, and shortstop Cesar
Izturis tripled, doubled and singled.</TE>
<TE>   After getting swept by San Francisco and outscored, 24-2, in a
season-opening three-game series, the Dodgers needed a breakout game
like Laker center Shaquille O'Neal needs a good podiatrist. The
season was a mere three games old, and already the offense appeared
to have gaping holes.</TE>
<TE>   But Karros and Green, with the help of a few tasty offerings from
Colorado pitcher Shawn Chacon, filled in a few gaps.</TE>
<TE>   Green led off the second with a walk and took third on Chacon's
wild pickoff attempt. Adrian Beltre walked, and up stepped Karros,
whose power was sapped by a lower-back injury that limited him to a
career-low .235 average, 15 home runs and 63 runs batted in last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Chacon fell behind, 3 and 1, and grooved a fastball over the
middle, just above the knees. Karros launched it over the wall in
left-center for a 3-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "When E.K. hit that home run, there was a sigh of relief in the
dugout," catcher Paul Lo Duca said. "That was something we needed,
and we took off from there. We needed something to get us going after
getting our butts kicked for three straight games."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers added a run in the third on Dave Roberts' walk and
Izturis' RBI double, and they blew the game open with a five-run
fourth, a rally ignited by Karros' double to left.</TE>
<TE>   Karros took third on Mark Grudzielanek's fly ball to center and
slid home just before Chacon's flip to the plate on Ashby's
suicide-squeeze bunt. Roberts walked and Izturis singled to load the
bases, and after Lo Duca fouled out, Colorado Manager Buddy Bell
summoned left-hander Dennys Reyes to face Green, who greeted the
former Dodger with a bases-clearing double into the right-field
corner for an 8-0 lead. Brian Jordan capped the rally with an RBI
double.</TE>
<TE>   The huge early lead allowed Ashby to relax. The right-hander
walked two and allowed only one runner to reach third base.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a sense of relief," said Ashby, who struggled in
his attempt to clear the mental hurdle of overcoming surgery earlier
this spring. "It's a great feeling to be out there on the mound
again.... It's a great feeling to be a part of this again."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Sign 16-Year-Old Pitcher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers continued to bolster their prospect-thin farm system
through the international free-agent market Friday, signing a
16-year-old pitcher from the Dominican Republic after a month-long
background check to verify his age.</LD>
<LD>   The club outbid several teams for Jonathan Corporan--a 6-foot-2
right-hander whose fastball has been clocked consistently at 93
mph--giving the native of Santo Domingo a $930,000 signing bonus. He
turns 17 April 21.</LD>
<LD>   Corporan, whose agent, Don Nomura, also represents Dodger
right-hander Hideo Nomo, is the latest in a long line of
international players to receive big bonuses from the club recently
because of its poor performance in the amateur draft for more than a
decade.</LD>
<TE>   But he is the first to undergo an extensive age-verifying process
since the federal government crackdown on immigration documentation
in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. More than two dozen
Latin-born major leaguers aged overnight when documentation they
submitted for visas was proven to be false.</TE>
<TE>   "We did that for the very simple reason that we think very highly
of this kid--and we think even more highly of him if he's 16,"
General Manager Dan Evans said. "There were rumblings from different
sources that he may be older, so [Dodger scouting officials] went to
work verifying his age.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very comfortable saying this is a 16-year-old kid. Because
of that, we think we got a really good player."</TE>
<TE>   Players in the Dominican and other impoverished countries are
often encouraged to lie about their age by intermediaries who arrange
tryouts with teams and their families to increase their marketability
to teams seeking young players with "high ceilings."</TE>
<TE>   Clubs have long struggled to obtain official records to document
players' ages, but they accepted the risks as part of doing business
in the key foreign-player market. Now, executives are leery of making
multimillion-dollar commitments to players who might be much older
than they claim.</TE>
<TE>   Evans instructed Jeff Schugel, director of international scouting,
and Luchy Guerra, senior manager of Latin American operations, to
confirm Corporan's age. They researched public records, but also
relied on numerous contacts in government and baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to make sure we're as thorough as we can be," Evans
said, "simply because a kid who they rave about at age 16, who
suddenly turns 19 or 20, you don't look for as much upside.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the equivalent of a high school junior right now. If he were
that age in the states, we'd be drooling about him."</TE>

<HD>Ishii Hopes to Resolve Control Issues Tonight</HD>

<LD>Kazuhisa Ishii will make his long-awaited major league debut tonight
against the Rockies, a start that seemed in jeopardy because of his
ongoing confidence and control problems.</LD>
<LD>   But as jittery as the left-hander from Japan has been in recent
weeks--the worst of it was his 22/3-inning, five-run, seven-walk
performance in Seattle last Sunday--Manager Jim Tracy said he never
considered demoting Ishii to the bullpen or the minor leagues.</LD>
<LD>   "A decision like that could have been even more detrimental,"
Tracy said. "We're showing him confidence, telling him we respect
what he's done, and we're going to give him the opportunity to show
us that spring training for him is like spring training for everyone
else, a time to prepare for the season."</LD>
<TE>   Ishii was spectacular in his spring debut, throwing two shutout
innings with four strikeouts and no walks against Atlanta on March 8,
but he has struggled since, finishing the spring with a 1-2 record,
12.96 earned-run average and 10 walks in 81/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   He has spent countless hours in the bullpen the past two weeks
trying to find a consistent rhythm to his delivery.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not so much concerned with technique as I am with the mental
aspects of pitching, of concentration," Ishii said through an
interpreter. "In order to succeed I have to have confidence, and I've
been working in the bullpen to rebuild some of that confidence that
may have been lost."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers invested $23.46 million in Ishii this winter, an
$11.26-million posting fee paid to Ishii's former Japanese team, the
Yakult Swallows, and a four-year, $12.2-million deal to sign him, so
he will have every opportunity to succeed. Ishii also has an
impressive pedigree--he went 78-46 with a 3.38 ERA the last 10 years
and pitched in six Japan Series.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like he's brand new to pitching in important games,"
Tracy said. "He's pitched in six Japan World Series games, and I know
what those are like, how significant they are.... You're allowed to
have concerns [about Ishii], but I think [starting him tonight] is
the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   A Dodger hitting a towering home run?</TE>
<TE>   That might seem like fiction given the club's problems on offense,
but it's definitely science fiction as Shawn Green accomplishes the
feat in a move titled "The Core." The right fielder has a bit part in
the big-budget Paramount production produced by David Foster and
directed by Jon Amiel, but said he's not considering quitting his day
job.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just going to be for fun," Green said. "It's going to be an
hour or so to just do a couple of shots at home plate. It's not
something that I ever want to pursue [as a career]. It's really just
to try something new and have some fun." Asked if he'd consider
pursuing an acting career, Green said, "No. Never."</TE>
<TE>   In the movie, which is still being filmed, a team of scientists
goes underground to reactivate the Earth's mysteriously stilled inner
core with a nuclear device. Green is scheduled to shoot his scene
today at Dodger Stadium, hitting his homer as a space shuttle flies
low over the stadium. A computer-generated shuttle will be added
later.</TE>
<TE>   Green was reluctant to film the scene today because the team is
struggling, so Foster arranged with Jeff Moorad, Green's agent, to
complete the work in about two hours in the afternoon.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Showing Signs of Life, 2-0</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Giguere stops 26 shots as Anaheim ends Edmonton's
nine-game unbeaten streak with victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the Edmonton Oilers end up missing the playoffs, they will be able
to blame the Mighty Ducks and goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere for
their early summer vacation.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks played the role of spoiler to perfection as they stopped
the Oilers' nine-game unbeaten streak with a 2-0 victory Friday night
in front of a crowd of 13,369 at the Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<LD>   Edmonton, in eighth place in the Western Conference with 87
points, had not lost since an overtime defeat to Detroit on March 13.
But the Oilers did not have an answer for Giguere, who was as good as
he needed to be in making 26 saves.</LD>
<TE>   With the loss, the Oilers blew an opportunity to move into a tie
with the Kings and Phoenix for sixth place in the West.</TE>
<TE>   With Dallas and Vancouver winning, the Oilers' hold on the final
playoff spot is down to one point.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton, which lost to the Ducks for the first time this season,
will play the Kings tonight at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Captain Paul Kariya scored the first goal on a first-period power
play and German Titov added an insurance goal in the third for
Anaheim, which is 3-3-1 in its last seven games.</TE>
<TE>   "We've played hard for a long time," Coach Bryan Murray said about
the Ducks, who finished with 30 shots on goal. "It's just been so
difficult for us to get that third goal every night."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to Giguere, who recorded his fourth shutout, Anaheim needed
only two.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere was at his best early in the third period with the Oilers
pressing to tie the score. He made several impressive stops, which
set the stage for Titov and John Leclerc, who teamed for the final
goal.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Matt] Cullen line has been good with Titov and Leclerc
stepping up their games [over the last two weeks]," Murray said. "I
don't have a lot of complaints as far as effort. The players are
learning how to play together and I think they are more respectful of
the team philosophy versus doing things by themselves."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who have sat near the basement of the Western
Conference most of the season, benefited from some rare production
from their power play.</TE>
<TE>   Entering Friday's game, Anaheim ranked last in the league when
playing with a man advantage, scoring only 42 goals in 358 attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "We've just haven't played well together. We've tried every
possible setup and line combinations," Kariya said. "We just haven't
made smart plays out there. We make bad decisions with the puck. When
you look at a team like Detroit, everyone knows who's on the ice and
where they are without looking.</TE>
<TE>   "On our power play, no one wants the puck and then we don't make
plays with it."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bryan Murray agreed, saying the Ducks are lacking a
quarterback on the power play.</TE>
<TE>   "We've needed a guy who can really take charge," Murray said. "A
playmaker. [Steve] Rucchin could be the guy or we may have the guy in
the system. But that's something we'll have to find for next season."</TE>

<HD>Galaxy's Lineup Is Unsettled</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Schmid will have decisions to make when Marshall is
ready to start.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the first week of Major League Soccer's seventh season, the Galaxy
defeated D.C. United, 2-1. In the second week, Los Angeles was idle,
but D.C. United rebounded to shut out the Chicago Fire, 2-0. Tonight,
the Galaxy plays host to the Fire and, based on the above results,
logic suggests that the Galaxy should win.</LD>
<LD>   "You can never go by that," Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said Friday,
laughing at the idea. "If it worked like that, there'd be a lot of
results we could predict and bet on and we could make a lot of money.
But it never works like that."</LD>
<LD>   Schmid was in good spirits after using the brief break in Los
Angeles' schedule to make a quick trip to England and Germany to
scout players. He returned empty-handed but upbeat.</LD>
<TE>   "Like I said before I left, [adding new players] is something
we're going to be patient about. We want to get Tyrone [Marshall]
back [in the starting defense] and see how it looks."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall, acquired by the Galaxy in the off-season, played 45
minutes at El Paso Tuesday night in a 2-0 Los Angeles victory over
the El Paso Patriots, the Galaxy's A-League affiliate.</TE>
<TE>   He was expected to start tonight, but Schmid said the Jamaican
national team player has not fully recovered from a right ankle
sprain.</TE>
<TE>   "He's able to play, but he's not able to start," Schmid said.
"Fitness-wise, I think he's probably [good for] 30 minutes or so."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall was acquired when the Miami Fusion folded.</TE>
<TE>   He was supposed to replace Paul Caligiuri, who retired, but became
even more valuable once Greg Vanney decided to pack his bags and move
to the French league.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy's starting back four in the season opener featured Ezra
Hendrickson, Alexi Lalas, Danny Califf and Adam Frye, and the same
four will start tonight, with Marshall and Craig Waibel as backups.</TE>
<TE>   Once Marshall is fit, Schmid will have to make some tough choices
about whom to start on defense.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have to see how people are playing," he said. "We have
different options. Tyrone and Craig are able to play any of the [back
four] positions."</TE>
<TE>   Hendrickson is a fixture at right back, and Lalas has not only
raised his game but is the vocal leader on defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Alexi has played well this season, much better than he played
last year," Schmid said.</TE>
<TE>   That would seem to indicate that it will be Califf or Frye who
might be bumped, but it could be that both remain starters--Califf
staying alongside Lalas in the center and Frye moving upfield to make
room for Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   "Adam has been an invaluable player for us because he's been able
to fill in for us up front when we've needed it and also in the
back," Schmid said. "He always brings a good energy level to the
game. He's never going to hurt your team in terms of effort."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall said Friday that his ankle "is feeling better and better
every day," adding that he hoped to play a few minutes tonight.</TE>

<HD>Another Jog in Park for Bonds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Once the baseball left his bat and cleared the right-field stands and
he broke into his home-run trot, Barry Bonds had this odd blank look
on his face. So what if his 10th-inning home run Friday, his fifth in
four games, had just given the San Francisco Giants a 3-1 victory
over San Diego in their home opener at Pacific Bell Park?</LD>
<LD>   There are other factors to consider, Bonds said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's early, and baseball is a long-distance run," he said. "I
don't get too excited in the first quarter-lap. I get excited on the
last lap when I'm ahead."</LD>
<TE>   The way Bonds has begun, you cannot shake an eerie feeling that
last season hasn't really ended for him and has instead folded neatly
into this one. Home run-wise, you have to say he's picked up where he
left off last year, when he set the major league record of 73.</TE>
<TE>   In four games, Bonds has come to the plate 11 times and has seven
hits, five of them home runs. He is hitting .636. He also has a
slugging percentage of 2.091, which is pretty good when you consider
Bonds broke Babe Ruth's record with a slugging percentage of .863
last year. Giant Manager Dusty Baker watched Bonds' 572nd career home
run clear the wall and then said he almost knew it was going to
happen.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of expect it of him," Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if his manager feels that way, Bonds doesn't. His home runs
may be routine to others, but not to him.</TE>
<TE>   "Surprised?" Bonds said. "Shock is more like it. I'm as shocked as
anybody."</TE>
<TE>   The latest blast by Bonds was on a one-strike pitch from
left-hander Alan Embree, a former Giant, who hung a curveball over
the plate. Embree said it probably wouldn't have mattered if he had
thrown a fastball at the knees on the corner.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everything looks in slow motion to Barry right now," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds said the hardest ball he hit all day was an out. On his
first trip to the plate, he hit a drive to the deepest part of
Pacific Bell Park, just to the left of the 421-foot sign, where Mark
Kotsay leaped to snag the ball in front of the wall. Bonds walked on
four pitches in the third, flied out tamely to left in the sixth and
walked on five pitches in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   In the 10th, with Rich Aurilia on first after a walk, Bonds
unloaded. While he circled the bases, the stunned Padre players
slowly left the field. It was the first walk-off home run by Bonds
since he hit one against the Philadelphia Phillies on Aug. 30, 1999.
He crossed the plate and was mobbed by teammates, then he retreated
to the dugout. After a few moments, he walked to the top step and
waved to the sellout crowd of 41,714.</TE>
<TE>   It was the end of a long day for Bonds and the Giants, who didn't
get back into town until 2 a.m. after playing the Dodgers Thursday
night in Los Angeles. But that didn't stop Bonds from enjoying the
opening day ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   "On opening day, you can probably sleep one hour and still do a
good job," Bonds said.</TE>
<TE>   To the surprise of absolutely no one, the pregame ceremony turned
out to be a virtual Bonds love fest. Before the first trays of garlic
fries from the concession stands could get cold, eight former winners
of the most valuable player award honored Bonds as he received his
fourth MVP award. Ernie Banks, Willie Mays, Reggie Jackson, Willie
McCovey, Orlando Cepeda, Jeff Kent, Vida Blue and Kevin Mitchell sat
with Bonds in folding chairs arranged in a semicircle between the
pitcher's mound and home plate.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds turned to acknowledge a new flag on display beyond the
center-field wall. Black with orange trim, it had the number 73 in a
white circle. He cradled the MVP plaque and thanked the fans of San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "Those 73 were for you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The fans must have believed him. When his name was announced
during the player introductions, the cheering was so loud, no one
could hear anything after "Batting third, left field ... "</TE>
<TE>   But if he has fans in the seats, Bonds also has plenty in other
places. Banks said Bonds' swing is the best he has ever seen by a
left-handed hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "Ted Williams had a great swing, Rod Carew had a great swing, but
this kid, he is so powerful, the ball just goes off his bat," Banks
said. "The sound of it is so different. It's a loud sound. He's just
remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   "Gosh, what a player. If they had pitched to him last year, he
might have hit 90 home runs. What a player."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, who says he doesn't feel any pressure to hit home runs and
has no idea if he has a flair for the dramatic, denied it when asked
if he uses steroids. He also said he isn't sure if he's in the same
zone as he was last year. All he was certain of late Friday afternoon
is that he was tired.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to play extra innings," he said. "We don't get paid
for overtime. All I was really trying to do was get the hell out of
here."</TE>

<HD>Elkington, Mickelson All Tied Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whatever happened to Steve Elkington? You know, the Aussie who won 10
tournaments during the 1990s, then dropped out of sight?</LD>
<LD>   Well, he's not washed up yet.</LD>
<LD>   Elkington is in position for his first PGA Tour victory since
1999, reaching the midway point of the BellSouth Classic in Duluth,
Ga., on Friday tied for the lead with Phil Mickelson at 11 under par.</LD>
<TE>   "I like winning," Elkington said. "I haven't had many
opportunities, but I do appreciate them when I get them."</TE>
<TE>   Elkington was a top contender through most of the 1990s; his
victories included the '95 PGA Championship and The Players
Championship twice.</TE>
<TE>   Injuries slowed Elkington the past two seasons, knocking him out
of the top 100 on the money list. He has made the cut in only four of
eight tournaments this year.</TE>
<TE>   Elkington regained his old form on the grueling TPC at Sugarloaf
course. After opening with a 64, he shot a three-under 69 to maintain
a share of the top spot at 133.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm only 39," Elkington said. "I have plenty of time. I feel fit
now, and I feel I have a lot of good golf in me. I am strong. I am
big. I hit it plenty far ... and I've got all that experience now."</TE>
<TE>   Starting on the back side, Elkington birdied three of his first
four holes. He blasted out of the sand for a short putt at 10, the
longest hole on the course at 608 yards. He made a 20-foot putt at
12, followed by a 15-footer at the 13th.</TE>
<TE>   Elkington had only one birdie and one bogey the rest of the round,
settling into a par groove.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson, who opened with a 65, played the first 32 holes of the
tournament without a bogey. He got to 12 under, then three-putted
back-to-back greens before finishing with a 68.</TE>
<TE>   The most interesting group included Retief Goosen and Jesper
Parnevik.</TE>
<TE>   Both had a pair of eagles, which included Parnevik making a
hole-in-one at No. 8 with a five-iron from 217 yards. That shot, he
quipped, wasn't as memorable as the hole-in-one he made in a 1995
tournament in China.</TE>
<TE>   "Heineken was sponsoring the tournament and gave me free beer for
a year," Parnevik said. "Today, I didn't even get a car."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ed Dougherty birdied the final two holes for a six-under 66 and a
one-stroke lead over Hale Irwin after the first round of the Legends
of Golf at St. Augustine, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament is an official Senior PGA Tour event for the first
time, with the Legends Division switching from a team format to
individual play.</TE>
<TE>   Dougherty, battling a cold and dizziness, was two under through 12
holes and added birdies on Nos. 13, 15, 17 and 18 on The King &amp; Bear
Course at the World Golf Village.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt dizzy out there, my eyes hurt, I'm sure I've got a cold,"
he said. "I had my caddie read all my putts today. He did a good job.</TE>
<TE>   That included a 50-foot birdie putt on the second hole that got
Dougherty off to a good start. He birdied the par-five 13th and
closed with 20- and 25-foot birdie putts on Nos. 17 and 18.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin, who has a senior-record 34 victories, had his only bogey of
the round on No. 17, but rebounded with a birdie on No. 18.</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Swept by the Celtics, just like the old days.</LD>
<LD>   Phil Jackson insisted Friday night that the rest of the season
still had meaning, although it was sure hard to tell by the game that
followed, when his overmatched Lakers lost by 18 to the Celtics, who
even in their revived state bear little resemblance to the teams that
hung the 16 banners they play beneath.</LD>
<LD>   Now there's a new meaning, which has less to do with catching
Sacramento--now 31/2 games ahead with six Laker games to play--than
securing home-court advantage over everyone else.</LD>
<TE>   To that end, Jackson is considering shaking up his lineup for the
next game at Miami, and starting Shaquille O'Neal over Samaki Walker
at center.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal sat out again, resting his sore wrist along with his
arthritic toe and, as in New Jersey, there weren't many fans, players
or coaches anguishing over his absence.</TE>
<TE>   Said Celtic Coach Jim O'Brien of his center, Tony Battie: "I think
he was the happiest man in the world to find out Shaq wasn't going to
play. I was second."</TE>
<TE>   Talk about your non-events in your former rivalries.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers and Celtics, who met in nine NBA finals in the 1950s,
'60s, '70s and '80s, have little in common these days. The Lakers are
twice-defending champions. The Celtics haven't even been in the
playoffs since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   This was supposed to be the night the Celtics clinched their
postseason berth, but even that didn't work out. Before they arrived
at the FleetCenter, someone figured out Thursday's loss by Indiana
meant the Celts were already in.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the Celtics are sufficiently humble--a word never
applied to them in the old days--to refrain from talking about being
a rival to the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers seem to think the Celtics are kind of a cute little
bunch, if they think of them at all.</TE>
<TE>   Or as Jackson said of Boston's spread-the-floor offense: "It's a
different style of ball that will play here in the East [read: home
of dwarfs]. I don't know if it would play in the West [read: where
the men live.]"</TE>
<TE>   Once the Celtics played in a house of horrors called Boston
Garden, where visitors swore Red Auerbach had trained the rats to spy
on them. During one finals in the '80s, Laker Coach Pat Riley had the
drinking water provided by the home team thrown out, to make sure Red
didn't poison them.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Celtics have the FleetCenter, a venue almost as cavernous
as the Staples Center, with atmosphere that is no more electric.</TE>
<TE>   Once Celtic fans hated the Lakers with a passion that was scary to
behold but more has been lost in the last seven years than some
playoff dates.</TE>
<TE>   As the franchise went from M.L. Carr to Rick Pitino and bad became
worse, then pathetic and seemingly hopeless, Celtic fans simply
turned away and they aren't all the way back yet. If it weren't for
those 16 banners, carried over from the Garden, it would be hard to
tell there was ever a dynasty here.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, the scoreboard TV screen did show a couple of 8-year-olds
in matching "I Hate L.A." T-shirts, but there were lots of kids in
the stands wearing Laker gold. Paul Pierce, the current Celtic star,
arrived four seasons ago from, of all places, Inglewood, Calif.,
where he had grown up as a die-hard Laker fan. He's over it, he says,
even if he did wear a black-and-white Dodger cap Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's pretty much all over," Pierce said. "It was one of
those things, as a little kid, growing up in Los Angeles. But now,
the role is reversed. I'm a Celtic now and I'm trying to beat the Los
Angeles Lakers any chance I get.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a great year for that. We swept 'em and who knows, maybe
we can see 'em in the finals."</TE>
<TE>   Well, it's possible. Someone has to make it from the East.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers and Celtics have played some great games, but this
wasn't one.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant was cold and, with O'Neal out, there was no Plan B
they could go to.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant spent the game trading jibes with New England Patriot
safety Lawyer Milloy, who was sitting courtside with a friend. Of
course, when the friend started pouring it on Bryant at the end of
the first half, and Bryant managed to make a couple of shots, Milloy
cautioned his buddy that a fired-up Kobe might go for 50.</TE>
<TE>   That was as good as it got, however.</TE>
<TE>   It may not have been much of a game, but it was appropriate for
the Lakers right now, a no-show in a non-event in a former rivalry,
in an ever-less-meaningful regular season.</TE>

<HD>Cautionary Note to Speed Record</HD>
<DH>Auto racing: Drivers say they feel G-forces they haven't
felt before as Texas Speedway becomes fastest in NASCAR.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ED HINTON</AU>
<BD>ORLANDO SENTINEL</BD>
<DL>FORT WORTH</DL>
<LD>Texas Motor Speedway on Friday became the fastest track on the
Winston Cup tour--not as fast as NASCAR officials had feared, but
enough to make the drivers tense.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Elliott won the pole for Sunday's Samsung/Radio Shack 500
with a lap at 194.224 mph in a Dodge. That topped Elliott's 191.542
mph at Atlanta on March 8 as the highest qualifying speed of the
season.</LD>
<LD>   NASCAR had brought carburetor restrictor plates to the speedway,
just in case speeds got too close to 200 mph on the 1.5-mile oval,
where new pavement escalated speeds from last year because of
improved grip through the turns. But plates won't be mandated for
Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Drivers said they were feeling stresses through the corners that
they'd never felt before, anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no track like this racetrack," said Elliott Sadler, who
qualified second in a Ford at 193.071.</TE>
<TE>   Added 25-year veteran Ricky Rudd, third fastest at 193.016 in a
Ford: "There's as much stress on the cars and tires as I've ever felt
since I've been racing."</TE>
<TE>   As one of only a few active drivers who raced in the
pre-restrictor plate days at Daytona and Talladega before 1988, Rudd
said that "running around here at 193 or 194 feels faster than 210 or
212 did back then at Daytona."</TE>
<TE>   Elliott, who holds the all-time NASCAR qualifying record of
212.809, set in 1987 at Talladega, reemerged as the laid-back maestro
of skyrocketing speeds. "I can't remember that far back," he cracked
about the sensation of 212 vs. 194. "I don't know if I feel the speed
any differently than I did 15 years ago. These cars are stuck [grip
the track] so much better."</TE>
<TE>   It's the grip, Rudd said, creating extraordinary G-forces that
threaten to be extremely taxing on both cars and drivers come Sunday.
Drivers noted that their crews' data retrieval systems showed 3-G
loading through the corners--more than they experience anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago here, CART drivers refused to race after they
experienced dizziness and blackouts through the corners, at more than
220 mph in their lighter, open-wheel cars.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they were pulling up to 6 Gs in the corners," Rudd said.
"We're nowhere near that extreme, but it's very, very physical inside
the race car.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine the baddest, meanest roller coaster you've ever ridden in
your life. Imagine the corner load that you took in that roller
coaster where you slid to the other side of the car you're riding in.
That's probably the best way to describe it. When you go into the
corner, if you didn't have your seat fixed up with the right-side
head rest, it would probably snap your neck."</TE>
<TE>   The dazzling, $250-million facility in Texas--called "that big
monster" even by the man who built it, owner Bruton Smith--has been
star-crossed since the day it opened in 1997, to a storm of driver
protests over the weird, dipsy-doodle configuration of the track.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, nearly $7 million has been spent, trying to get the
track right.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers have grumbled all along that amid all the opulence--nearly
a mile-long span of luxury sky boxes, a nine-story "Speedway Club"
and a 10-story condominium complex overlooking the track, plus five
helicopter pads in the infield for VIP transport--Texas officials
forgot to build a viable racetrack. Originally, the "transitions"
from flat straightaways to banked turns were too abrupt, and the
exits to the corners--especially the fourth turn--were so narrow the
drivers felt as if they were hurtling into funnels.</TE>
<TE>   "You come through that fourth turn thinking, 'I'm OK, I'm OK, I'm
ohhh!'" Sterling Marlin said, succinctly for all concerned, in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Then in '98, water began seeping through the track surface in the
turns, unpredictably, so that drivers found themselves slipping and
sliding without warning. So, later that year, Smith spent $4.5
million reconfiguring the track nearer to drivers' liking and
revamping the drainage system.</TE>
<TE>   After that, dips developed beneath both sets of turns, because of
settling of the earth around the two tunnels that allow traffic
access to the infield. So last summer, $2.5 million was spent to put
down steel and concrete bedding between the track surface and the
underlying tunnels, then the whole track was repaved.</TE>
<TE>   It's now so fast it's harrowing, but "they've done an excellent
job resurfacing," Rudd said. "The cars like the racetrack a lot
better than they did.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess the third or fourth time they got it right," Rudd
concluded. "Now we just have to wait and see if we can race on it."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's heavy in irony that the arcs in the careers of trainer Patrick
Biancone and jockey Pat Valenzuela should cross in today's Santa
Anita Derby. Biancone is still recovering from his bitter clash with
Hong Kong racing authorities three years ago, and Valenzuela, as he
did through most of the 1990s, is once more trying to convince
horsemen that his many lapses into drug and alcohol abuse will not
reoccur.</LD>
<LD>   The horse that has brought these two troubled Pats together is
Mayakovsky. Named after a Russian poet from the early 1900s, the fast
Florida-bred colt has made the most of a three-race career that will
send him off as the second choice, behind Came Home, in today's
$750,000 race. It is a race that Valenzuela has won twice, at 17 with
Codex in 1980 and nine years later with Sunday Silence, who also gave
the jockey a Kentucky Derby victory during one of the times when the
cobwebs of cocaine had temporarily shifted from his life.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody knows who Patrick is and how good he can be," said
Biancone, who could just as easily been describing himself. "Five
years ago, I wouldn't have even considered him for this. But what is
important to me is the Patrick of today. He is riding at the top of
his game and he has the experience in these kinds of races. There is
not a jockey at Santa Anita who works more horses in the mornings
than he does. You can see that the fire is back in his eyes."</TE>
<TE>   After 22 months on the sidelines, Valenzuela, 39, was relicensed
under strict monitoring conditions in December and about two weeks
later he scored his first win in almost two years. He has won 27 more
races since then, to become one of the leaders in the Santa Anita
standings, and today will ride in the track's premier 3-year-old race
for the first time since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just happy to be back and have a chance to get in this
position," said Valenzuela, who got on Mayakovsky's back for the
first time when the colt worked a half-mile in 481/5 seconds Tuesday.
"The horse hasn't done anything wrong and he's a very good prospect."</TE>
<TE>   The door at Santa Anita's barn 76 opened to Valenzuela when Edgar
Prado, the only jockey to have ridden Mayakovsky in the afternoon,
chose to ride the longshot Bowman's Band in Arkansas today in the
$500,000 Oaklawn Handicap. More to the point, Prado also rides
Harlan's Holiday, the Florida Derby winner and, after a final prep in
the Blue Grass at Keeneland a week from today, his Kentucky Derby
mount at Churchill Downs on May 4.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I've ever rooted for a horse harder than when I
watched the Florida Derby on TV," Valenzuela said. "I was rooting for
Harlan's Holiday to keep going, because I knew I was sitting behind
Prado on Mayakovsky."</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Michael Tabor of Monte Carlo, who won the Kentucky Derby
with Thunder Gulch in 1995, Mayakovsky returns Biancone to a
limelight that the third-generation French trainer basked in
regularly during the 1980s. He twice won the Arc de Triomphe,
France's signature race, with the filly All Along and Sagace, and
trained other champions. After her Arc triumph, All Along crossed the
Atlantic with Biancone and in a matter of 28 days she blew the doors
off North America's best grass runners, winning major races in
Maryland, New York and Canada by a combined 16 lengths. All Along was
voted the Eclipse Award for horse of the year, the first female
national titlist in 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, a restless Biancone moved his operation to Hong Kong,
where some early successes were marred by a series of positive drug
tests for horses that by 1999 resulted in a 10-month suspension.</TE>
<TE>   "My divorce [he's now married to a former Miss Hong Kong] was
bloody, but this was even worse," Biancone said. "I'm the only
trainer in the world who got [that length of suspension] for a Class
4 drug [an anabolic steroid]. I was not allowed to bring in witnesses
that might have argued my side. There was no right of appeal. It was
a dirty way to handle things."</TE>
<TE>   Biancone, 49, credits Frank Stronach, the owner of Santa Anita as
well as a formidable racing and breeding operation, with resurrecting
his career. He said that Stronach signed him on as a racing advisor
in December 1999 and helped him get his U.S. work visa six months
later. Biancone wound up training some Stronach horses in California,
but they were of no consequence and now, still friends with Stronach,
he is a public trainer who will move his headquarters to Belmont Park
next week as he tries to develop a stable. Most of his clients are in
Europe and consider New York handier than California.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Biancone has won only two races, one at Santa Anita
(ridden by Valenzuela) and the Gotham Stakes with Mayakovsky on March
17. That was the colt's first start since Sept. 1, when he ran second
to Came Home in the Hopeful at Saratoga. In his first start,
Mayakovsky ran 51/2 furlongs in 1:031/5, breaking a Saratoga record
that was set in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   His 2-year-old campaign ended abruptly on Sept. 25, when a
hairline fracture was discovered in his rear left leg.</TE>
<TE>   "No surgery was required," Biancone said, "and the prognosis was
that with rest he would be back within 60 to 90 days.</TE>
<TE>   "If it had been 90 days, we would have had little chance to be
where we are now. But it was 60 days when I got him back and the
injury had healed perfectly. He has to be a good horse to overcome
what he's been through."</TE>
<TE>   In the 11/8-mile Santa Anita Derby, Biancone said, Mayakovsky must
not only run well but show that he might like the extra furlong that
comes with the Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gotham, other horsemen pointed out that the colt drifted
out badly through the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "He did that in his first race too," Biancone said. "I would have
been more concerned had he drifted in, but we were still concerned.
We checked him out completely after the race and could find nothing
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Should Mayakovsky make the Kentucky Derby, he would be running at
Churchill Downs off just four career races.</TE>
<TE>   The last Derby winner to be that lightly raced was Exterminator in
1918.</TE>
<TE>   Blindfolded before he would enter the starting gate, Flying Dash
turned his U.S. debut into a 21/2-length victory in the $100,000
Transylvania as Keeneland opened its spring meet.</TE>
<TE>   Flying Dash, ridden by Jerry Bailey, is owned by Fusao Sekiguchi
and trained by Neil Drysdale, who combined to win the Kentucky Derby
with Fusaichi Pegasus in 2000.</TE>

<LD>Forget the Santa Anita Derby or the Repent Invitational, better known
as the Illinois Derby. The two best races in the country today are
for females.</LD>
<LD>   Azeri, Miss Linda, Affluent, Fleet Renee and Spain--Grade I
winners all--will get together in the $500,000 Apple Blossom Handicap
at Oaklawn Park. In Kentucky, Take Charge Lady and Belterra head a
field of eight 3-year-old fillies in the $500,000 Ashland Stakes at
Keeneland.</LD>
<LD>   The Apple Blossom will have a decided California feel. Azeri has
won four of five at Santa Anita and Hollywood Park and stepped up to
the big leagues with a decisive victory in the Santa Margarita last
month for the Allen Paulson Living Trust and trainer Laura De Seroux.</LD>
<TE>   Affluent has already won on the road. Owner Janis Whitham's
homebred took the Queen Elizabeth II Cup at Keeneland last fall and
has since added the La Brea and El Encino Stakes to her resume. Eddie
Delahoussaye is in Arkansas to ride Affluent.</TE>
<TE>   Destined for an engagement with You and Habibti in the Kentucky
Oaks on May 3, Take Charge Lady has won five of seven for trainer Ken
McPeek and has dominated her class at the Fair Grounds this winter.
Belterra is three for four in her career; she defeated Take Charge
Lady in the Golden Rod last Nov. 24 at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The sixth is a wide-open sprint at about 61/2
furlongs on the turf. Contention runs deep in the full field; it is a
great beginning to the pick six.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Kids To The Cup. Started by Trudy McCaffery in 1999,
the nonprofit, charitable organization's aim is to attract, educate
and develop racing fans between the ages of 8-16. Twenty of the
group's 400 nationwide members are visiting Santa Anita this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Pouring Down Rain. The 9-year-old gelding is winless in
19 races since the beginning of last year and is overmatched in
today's fourth at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Trackofthecat in the
first, using Ninetenthsofthelaw, Chiselling, Box Office Event and
Atticus Forever in the second and Bosque Redondo and Freedom Crest in
the third.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/202. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $10/$1,179.80. Total money bet: $1,250.</TE>

<LD>In his attempts to rally the troops over an 82-game schedule, King
Coach Andy Murray sometimes seems to overreach.</LD>
<LD>   For instance:</LD>
<LD>   "As I told the players," he said this week, "it's not good enough
at this time of year to come back into the dressing room and say, 'I
played pretty good.' Pretty good just doesn't cut it now. I don't
want to hear the pretty anymore; I want to hear the good. And if you
think you can be good by playing pretty, you're making a mistake too,
so let's get pretty out of the equation altogether.</LD>
<TE>   "If you want to come in and say, 'I played gritty good tonight,'
I'll accept that. But I don't want anyone saying, 'I played pretty
good.'"</TE>
<TE>   Say what?</TE>
<TE>   Felix Potvin made 15 of his 31 saves in the last 20 minutes of
Thursday night's 3-0 victory over the Detroit Red Wings, a
disappointment to his coach.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a meeting with our team," Murray said Friday, "because we
don't want Felix to have to be as good as he was in the third
period."</TE>
<TE>   Potvin, with a 2.30 goals-against average in 3,833 minutes played
spread across 67 appearances, is closing in on Rogie Vachon's club
records for goals-against average, games and minutes played.</TE>
<TE>   Vachon played 4,107 minutes in 70 games during the 1977-78 season.
His club-record goals-against average of 2.24 was set in the 1974-75
season.</TE>
<TE>   Murray, on Jason Allison's three-point effort against the Red
Wings: "I think for $7 million, or whatever he's going to get next
year, you should expect that every night. That's a responsibility he
wants." ... The Kings have established a club high of 275 points over
the last three seasons, one more than they collected from 1990-91
through 1992-93, but it should be noted that 11 points were the
result of overtime losses. Before the 1999-2000 season, no points
were awarded for overtime losses.</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Coach Phil Jackson said he expected Shaquille O'Neal, who has a
sprained right wrist, to play Sunday, when the Lakers' four-game road
trip concludes in Miami.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal missed his second consecutive game Friday night, when the
Lakers lost to the Boston Celtics 99-81, at the FleetCenter.</LD>
<LD>   An hour before game time, O'Neal sat on a table in the Lakers'
tiny locker room, two sets of electrical wires running from a
stimulation device to his wrist.</LD>
<TE>   He declined to talk about his new injury then, but after the game,
after gruffly attempting to shoo away reporters, O'Neal said, "If
Phil says Sunday, then I'll be back Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, in a conversation with Kobe Bryant, O'Neal
apparently expressed optimism about his wrist and right big toe.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me he's going to be ready," Bryant said. "I think there's
pain there. But, when we need a big basket, or we need a big sequence
of plays, he's going to be there. I'm not concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson almost never misses a practice, and Friday he tersely
offered no explanation for his absence from Thursday's. "It's all
right," he said. "I felt OK."</TE>
<TE>   Several players said they were unsure of the reason, but that he
joked about it during a team meeting Friday morning. One said he
believed Jackson experienced swelling in a foot or ankle, but that
was not confirmed. Jackson has had previous back, hip and knee
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Rambis, who needed stitches to repair a laceration on his
lower leg on Wednesday, returned to the bench Friday.</TE>
<TE>   That, along with Jackson's mystery ailment and Tex Winter's
occasional health issues, prompted General Manager Mitch Kupchak to
joke that O'Neal was the least of his worries. "I'm more concerned
about our coaching staff making it to the playoffs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kupchak and Jerry West are at the Portsmouth Invitational
tournament. The Lakers have a first-round pick in the NBA draft.</TE>

<HD>Lakers' April Cower</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Walker accuses them of quitting in
lethargic 99-81 loss at Boston. Shaq sits out again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Lakers lost another game on Friday night, meaning April won't be
so gaudy this time around.</LD>
<LD>   They lost it badly, with Shaquille O'Neal on the bench, with Kobe
Bryant missing jump shots, with Samaki Walker charging that they quit
in the face of the healthy and rallying Boston Celtics, and this sure
doesn't feel like a team roaring toward the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, it wouldn't with O'Neal hurting anyway. But, in the
aftermath of a 99-81 defeat at FleetCenter, Walker, nearly shaking
from the virus that wracked him for the previous 48 hours, said it
all felt very wrong.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought we gave up," he said. "I thought we felt for a minute
we could compete. But, once we saw we couldn't compete, we gave up.</TE>
<TE>   "[Without O'Neal] it's hard. At the same time, we have to take it
upon ourselves to group together."</TE>
<TE>   While there seemed to be valor in Wednesday night's defeat in New
Jersey, where they rallied from 19 down only to lose at the buzzer as
O'Neal rested his sprained wrist, the Lakers left no one with that
sense here. They flung jump shots that did not fall, they were
overrun by Paul Pierce (33 points) and Tony Battie (15 rebounds in 26
minutes), and they finally trudged off the parquet with season lows
for points, field goals (28) and assists (11).</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, who typically finds inspiration in such Shaq-less
dilemmas, was five for 25 from the floor, the worst shooting of his
career with at least 20 attempts. He scored 26 points, 16 of them
from the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had worse shooting nights," Bryant insisted. "It's been a
while. I'm glad it's out of my system now."</TE>
<TE>   As a result of these two defeats in three days, the Lakers have
all but lost their chance to win a third consecutive Pacific Division
title or to take home-court advantage through the postseason. The
Sacramento Kings have four fewer losses, and the Lakers have only six
games remaining. The Lakers also have one more loss than the Dallas
Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   "Not worried," Coach Phil Jackson said curtly, though he admitted
the Kings "would have to falter quite a bit" for the Lakers to catch
them.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the Lakers won their last eight regular-season games,
a streak they said helped drive them to a 15-1 postseason and their
second consecutive championship. Now they've got O'Neal to heal and a
defense to settle and at least a few late losses to forget about.
Only the part about O'Neal seems critical, however, and Jackson said
he expected O'Neal to play Sunday against the Miami Heat.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, O'Neal's return would help their interior defense
and eliminate the urge to jack up 19 three-point attempts, as the
Lakers did against the Celtics, missing all but three. The Celtics
made 10 of 25, five of nine in the fourth quarter, when they
outscored the Lakers, 33-23. They had clinched a place in the
playoffs the night before, when Indiana lost, and then they put out a
press release.</TE>
<TE>   "We've played some good games without the big fella," said Walker,
who sipped chicken broth and Gatorade for a day and a half and then
had six points and eight rebounds in 21 minutes. "We just didn't come
prepared."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox considered Walker's charge and then raised his head.</TE>
<TE>   "Thought we gave up?" he said. "I guess that's one teammate's
opinion. I don't begrudge him his opinion. I don't know if he speaks
for all of us.</TE>
<TE>   "We got outplayed, flat-out outplayed. The score may look like we
gave up. Sometimes you get beat. We got beat tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not quitting. That's not playing smart."</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally the Lakers are sound of game and cranky of mood when
O'Neal does not play, because there is a broad assumption they are
not very good without him.</TE>
<TE>   It makes them edgy, Bryant in particular. This time, however, the
Lakers looked resigned to the loss against the Celtics, and that
perhaps was what Walker was talking about.</TE>
<TE>   Funny thing, it had been only three days since they had routed
Washington, when O'Neal looked spry and Bryant looked dynamic and
everyone looked together.</TE>
<TE>   "You talk about feeling good about ourselves, and clicking," Fox
said. "We figured we'd go out on this trip and run the table."</TE>
<TE>   It changed when O'Neal's wrist began to ache, and when their game
did, and maybe their psyches too.</TE>
<TE>   "Now," Fox said, "it's a matter of how healthy we can be."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Simply Don't Have the Necessities</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If anyone still believes the Dodgers are a major league franchise
after the first three days at the stadium, then I can come to only
one conclusion: The Giants made a deal with the devil; all the
hitters are perfect, and their pitching rotation is, to a man, a
combination of Cy Young and Babe Ruth.</LD>
<LD>   Will Barry Bonds hit 300 home runs? Will the Giant starting
pitchers continue to throw shutouts, while going two for four at the
plate? Will Dusty Baker make all the right moves and win the World
Series? The answer is yes, if they continue to play the hapless
Dodgers all season.</LD>
<LD>   All I can say is the Dodgers have not had a real front office
since that fateful night with Ted Koppel and Al Campanis. Without
Kirk Gibson, Fred Claire would not have lucked into the 1988 World
Series victory. Walter O'Malley is turning over in his grave.</LD>

<TE>   Hope everyone got a chance to watch Dave Roberts single, steal
second and score in the bottom half of the first inning on opening
day--it's probably the last perfectly executed offensive move we'll
see from the Dodgers in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   After all, "little ball" makes little sense when your pitching
staff serves up an average of 10 runs a game. But hey, at least
there's peace in the clubhouse, right?</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adjective-challenged Tommy Lasorda summed up Kevin Brown's first
start of the year, saying, "Brownie wanted to pitch on opening day
very, very bad." Did anybody tell Jim Tracy about this before the
game?</TE>
<TE>   Even worse than Lasorda's grammar is the fact that Brown's
37-year-old right arm isn't even halfway through a seven-year
contract that pays $15 million each season. So on opening day 2005,
Brown, 40, will have yet another opportunity to pitch very, very bad.</TE>

<TE>   Having just returned from opening day at beautiful Dodger Stadium,
I couldn't help but smile through my tears at the prophetic name of

"trouble!"</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I don't know what has happened to my once-beloved Dodgers. The
franchise has become a shell of its former self.</TE>
<TE>   I learned that they started the sixth different shortstop in the
last six openers. Yes, shortstop, the single most important position
on the field.</TE>
<TE>   That they even pitch to Barry Bonds when he blasts every pitch he
sees into the bleachers shows they don't have a clue.</TE>
<TE>   Oh well, it's gonna be another long, lost season for Dodger fans.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Mouradian</TE>

<TE>   Through three games, the Dodgers are batting .136 (12 for 88) with
two runs scored, one RBI and no home runs. The Giants' pitchers are
batting .455 (five for 11) with three runs scored, three RBIs and one
home run.</TE>
<TE>   I dropped my season tickets after the '97 season, a decision that
looks better every year. Baseball's a mess, and the Dodgers are a
mess within a mess.</TE>
<TE>   When does college basketball start again?</TE>

Angeles this year.</TE>

<TE>   Brentwood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I guess the Dodgers think it's good public relations to have fans
here in Bakersfield not be able to see Dodger games on non-cable TV.
Those fans without cable will just have to listen to the radio. Maybe
this is the Dodgers' way of "reaching out" to their fans.</TE>

<TE>   Ah yes, baseball in the spring. How does the old saying go? The
pitchers will be ahead of the hitters? Or is it the hitters will be
ahead of the pitchers? I can't remember. I can't figure it out from
the Dodgers either, because they can't hit or pitch. Ah yes, baseball
and Dodger bashing. Sure signs of spring. Play ball!</TE>

<LD>Indiana learned something in the NCAA championship game. No matter
how many times you watch the movie "Hoosiers," it always turns out
the same way. Real life doesn't always behave like a movie script.</LD>
<LD>   Maryland might have learned something too. There is no such thing
as a jinx.</LD>

<TE>   The Times' Robyn Norwood had it right (March 29), when she noted,
"If [Bobby Knight] doesn't congratulate his former players next week,
any future talk of loyalty should be met with skepticism."</TE>
<TE>   Although Knight has tried to take credit for Indiana reaching this
year's championship game (he recruited most of the players), his
recent coaching record belies such a claim. In five of his last seven
tournament appearances, Knight has failed to get past the first game,
losing to such non-powerhouses as Colorado, Boston College and
Pepperdine.</TE>
<TE>   And even with a new school and a fresh mandate, this season was no
different. Knight's Texas Tech team lost in the opening round to
underdog Southern Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   So, Bobby, before you try to diminish what Mike Davis has
accomplished with his Indiana squad, you might want to go back to the
drawing board and figure out how to reach the Sweet 16.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe ask Steve Lavin. He's done it five of his last six tries.</TE>

<TE>   I held an impromptu survey while at Dodger Stadium on opening day,
asking approximately 20 people what they'd like during the
seventh-inning stretch. The unanimous results were not surprising.
While the fans clearly do not want to forget Sept. 11, they dearly
miss singing "Take Me Out To The Ballgame."</TE>

the game, while we will never forget, it is time to move on.</TE>

supposedly were in Indian Wells a year ago when Venus defaulted her
semifinal match against Serena?</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In all this talk about Mo Vaughn winning the MVP award, something
seems to have been forgotten: the fact that Mo did not deserve to win
the award--1995 was the year that Albert Belle tore up the American
League.</LD>
<LD>   Statistics bear out the fact that Belle had a better year than Mo,
and it would be hard to argue that anyone was more important to his
team than Belle was to the Indians.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately for Belle, he was discourteous to reporters (and
practically everyone else). While some sports writers voted
objectively, enough of them could not put their personal distaste of
Belle aside.</LD>
<TE>   If ever baseball needed an asterisk, it should be after the line
reading: "Mo Vaughn--MVP."</TE>

<TE>   Woodland Hills</TE>

<TE>   That was a fascinating picture on page two in Friday's sports page

wrestler. Honest mistake.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thirty years. Thirty years after the institution of Title IX, society
is still not able to support female athletes solely on their athletic
prowess.</LD>
<LD>   The perception by those marketing women's golf (and other women's
sports) is that women need to be attractive in order to draw fan
support, which is utterly false.</LD>
<LD>   If fans are telling Ty Votaw that women need more than their golf
game to gain support, get new fans! Ty can take a hint from the
Sacramento Kings: They certainly have been able to procure support
with appearance deficits.</LD>

<TE>   Diane Pucin asks rhetorically (April 5) whether Tiger Woods could
look like Craig Stadler and still be an "international icon." If
Tiger continued to tear up the tour, it wouldn't matter if he looked
like Godzilla and behaved like Hulk Hogan; he'd still be famous for
his achievements. Mark McGwire is revered because of his spectacular
home-run season, not because he's willing to drop his shorts for
Playgirl.</TE>
<TE>   Advising women athletes to pander to pop culture by marketing
themselves as sex objects will only cement their unequal status in
the sports world. Why should women be encouraged to play a game
that's set up for them to lose?</TE>

<LD>When it comes to Chick Hearn's possible comeback to Laker TV, let's
call it right: Give it up.</LD>
<LD>   Here's to keeping Paul Sunderland as the permanent Laker TV guy.
He's quick, accurate, current, melodic--simply a terrific talent.</LD>
<LD>   If Sunderland has a flaw, it's the score. He rarely gives it. No
big deal on TV, but on radio it's maddening.</LD>
<TE>   So here's a compromise: Bring Chick back to Laker radio only. He's
a stickler on the score, which when you're driving is the main event.</TE>
<TE>   Then if TV viewers want their familiar pal, they can turn down
Sunderland's sound and flip on the radio.</TE>

<LD>The millionaire Dashing Knud will make his first start as a
4-year-old in tonight's $26,400 Kaweah Bar Handicap at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Gordon Knudsen and Vessels Stallion Farm and trained by
Danny Cardoza, the gray will be making his first start since he
finished sixth in the Golden State Derby July 27.</LD>
<LD>   A winner of 10 of 16 lifetime and $1,010,846 in purses, Dashing
Knud won the Golden State Futurity and the Los Alamitos Million as a
2-year-old. Kenny Hart will ride the gelding, the 5-2 third choice in
the field of five, for the first time.</LD>
<TE>   Just Down The Lane, a 6-year-old gelding bred in Utah who has won
two in a row, is the 9-5 favorite in the 350-yard contest.</TE>
<TE>   The field is completed by Classic First, A Secret Account and All
American Jewel.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Good Presentation. 2. Du East. 3. Nunish. 4. E.R.
Nurse. 5. Orthopod. 6. Robert's Legend. 7. Great Tip. 8. Chicks
Charger Easy. 9. Dashing Knud. 10. Strawfly Te.</TE>
<TE>   Four!  In the opener, let's use Good Presentation and Admiral
Challenge, single Du East in the second, use Nunish, Mighty Smooth
Dash and Hot Saki in the third and E.R. Nurse, Santa Rosa Glory and
Sythingaboutmerry in the fourth. Total cost: $18.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Hot Saki is dropped to a career low in the
third by a winning stable (Adan Farias) and Quick Royal Smith is the
second of two entrants for trainer Jaime Gomez in the seventh, one of
two 2-year-old races.</TE>

<HD>After a Fashion, It's Pak</HD>
<DH>Golf: Her first-round 68 gives her one-stroke lead at
Tarzana, while attention is on LPGA marketing strategy.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Poor Se Ri Pak.</LD>
<LD>   One of the top three players on the LPGA Tour, coming off a
career-high five victories last year and winner of three major
championships in her career, Pak somehow keeps finding a way to be
overshadowed.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, when Pak won her third major at the British Open, it
was Annika Sorenstam stealing the spotlight with an eight-victory
season that included a tour single-round record 59 and a 10-stroke
comeback victory.</LD>
<TE>   Friday, when Pak shot four-under-par 68 and took the first-round
lead at the Office Depot Championship Hosted by Amy Alcott at El
Caballero Country Club in Tarzana, Pak took a back seat to a fashion
show, and all the talk about sex appeal and a new marketing strategy
for the tour.</TE>
<TE>   But while tour players Cindy Rarick, Sally Dee and Heather
Daly-Donofrio donned evening gowns and high heels for a promotional
fashion show designed to show LPGA players in a more attractive
light, Pak was busy fashioning a one-shot lead over little-known
Tonya Gill and Wendy Doolan. Dawn Coe-Jones and Kristal Parker-Manzo
are two behind Pak. Sorenstam, the defending champion, is joined by
Laura Diaz, Lorie Kane, Kellie Kuehne, Michelle Estill and Karen
Stupples three strokes back at 71.</TE>
<TE>   Pak, who has played third fiddle to Sorenstam and Karrie Webb in
what has evolved as the tour's big three, had seven birdies in a
round spoiled only by a fifth-hole bogey and a splashdown in a lake
near the par-five 17th hole that led to a double bogey. Afterward,
she discussed her status among fans and the media.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm pretty much at the same level as [Sorenstam and
Webb], but I'm a little behind [with the media]," Pak said. "I think
some day there will be newspapers and TV everywhere, but I have to
get consistent like Annika."</TE>
<TE>   In the new-look era of the LPGA Tour, a short skirt might help.
LPGA Tour Commissioner Ty Votaw revealed a plan at the beginning of
this year to improve the marketability of LPGA Tour players. The plan
has five steps, but improving physical appearance has drawn much of
the attention.</TE>
<TE>   "We need more TV and media exposure and that's one way to do it,"
said Alcott, an LPGA Tour Hall of Fame member. "Playing good golf is
not good enough out here. You have to roll over and do cartwheels and
bite yourself to get attention."</TE>
<TE>   A fashion show had to suffice Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The show--which will be used in television advertising to promote
the tour--was a prelude to the Fashion of the Fairway show that will
take place from noon to 2 p.m. today. The idea is to give fans an
aside to the golf tournament, much the way that fast-pitch radar guns
are used at baseball games and pop-a-shot games are used at
basketball arenas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot more fun than beating balls at the range after a
round," said Rarick, who shot 75 Friday before getting decked out in
her formal gown. It also happened to work. The show, held near a
heavy foot-traffic area of the ninth green, was too much for many of
the spectators to resist.</TE>
<TE>   What they missed, other than Pak's impressive round on a course
that yielded only 11 rounds under par, was a breakthrough round from
Gill. Gill, 31, played the tour as a conditional member in 1994,
traveling from tournament to tournament attempting on Mondays to
qualify for events. She earned only $13,558 then quit professional
golf and went into sports marketing.</TE>
<TE>   "Being conditional, I don't think there is a harder job out
there," Gill said. "It's such a grind."</TE>
<TE>   She helped organize celebrity golf tournaments in her hometown of
Nashville for three years before the itch to compete returned. She
qualified for the futures tour last year, then finished 15th at
Q-school to earn exempt status for this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a long way to go until Sunday afternoon," said Gill,
who played bogey-free for only the third time as a professional. "I
don't know if I've found the great secret to keeping my card out
here, but I'm working real hard to keep my exempt status."</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam, the hottest player in golf with two wins, a second and
a seventh already this year, is coming off a victory at the Kraft
Nabisco Championship last week and came from 10 strokes behind in the
final round to win this tournament last year.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam's score could easily have been a lot lower had some of
her putt on El Caballero's tricky greens dropped into the hole. She
made a birdie putt on the first hole, but had little luck after that.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, they didn't go in," Sorenstam said. "These greens are
quite tough, but they're on the edges so hopefully they'll drop the
next few days."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Wie, the youngest player to earn a spot in an LPGA Tour
event through a Monday qualifier, received a sponsor's exemption
Friday to play in the Asahi Ryokuken International at North Augusta,
S.C., May 16-19.</TE>
<TE>   The 12-year-old star from Honolulu qualified for the
season-opening Takefuji Classic at Kailua-Lona Hawaii, where she was
six over for two rounds and missed the cut.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's the most remarkable thing about Sacramento going unbeaten on a
six-game trip? To Chris Webber, it wasn't that the Kings won all six.</LD>
<LD>   "It's that we were able to win five of them without that guy over
there," he said, nodding toward Peja Stojakovic.</LD>
<LD>   Webber scored 28 points and Stojakovic had 23 in his return from
an eight-game absence as the Sacramento Kings defeated the Utah Jazz,
117-109, on Friday night at Salt Lake City.</LD>
<TE>   The Kings won their seventh in a row and capped a 6-0 trip,
extending their lead over the Lakers to three games in the Pacific
Division. They also set franchise records with their 56th victory and
23rd road victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sign of maturity," Webber said. "We're really coming
together. Having [Stojakovic] back, it's the first time in a while
we've had our whole team together."</TE>
<TE>   It was just the opposite for the Jazz. Perennial All-Star Karl
Malone went home before tipoff with a swollen right knee, only the
fifth game he missed because of injury in his 17-year career.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 97, Phoenix 87--Jermaine O'Neal scored 32 points and
grabbed 10 rebounds and Brad Miller had 25 points to lead the Pacers
at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacers desperately needed the victory after dropping five of
their last six to fall into a tie with Toronto for the eighth and
final playoff spot in the East.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 92, Philadelphia 88--Jerry Stackhouse had 34 points,
including two crucial free throws with 13 seconds left at
Philadelphia, as the Pistons won on the road for the 16th time in 19
games.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Barry scored 17 points, Chucky Atkins had 15 and Ben Wallace,
the NBA's leading rebounder, grabbed 10 despite spraining his right
ankle in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 110, Orlando 85--Keith Van Horn rebounded from a poor
game to score 20 points and grab 15 rebounds to lead the Nets at East
Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd had 14 points and 10 assists as the Nets extended their
franchise-record home winning streak to 13 games. Only Sacramento
(33-4) has a better home mark than the Nets (32-6).</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 98, Chicago 96--Antonio Davis scored 27 points and Alvin
Williams had 18 at Chicago as the Raptors won their seventh in a row,
tying a franchise record.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 97, Washington 91--Jamal Mashburn scored 27 points and
Elden Campbell had 21 to lead the Hornets at Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 102, Milwaukee 97--Eddie House scored 22 points, including
10 in the fourth quarter at Miami as the Heat ended a three-game
losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   New York 86, Seattle 83--Allan Houston scored 14 of his 28 points
in the fourth quarter at Seattle as the Knicks kept the SuperSoincs
from clinching a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis 99, Houston 81--Rookie Pau Gasol scored a career-high 32
points and grabbed 14 rebounds as the Grizzlies won at Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State 108, Denver 104--Gilbert Arenas scored 25 points at
Oakland and made the go-ahead basket with 1:02 left to lead the
Warriors.</TE>

<HD>Sampras Lets U.S. Slip on the Grass</HD>
<DH>Davis Cup: After a two-set lead, he stunningly loses in
five sets to leave Americans tied with Spain, 1-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The metaphor was within easy reach and almost inescapable, given the
way seven-time Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras was struggling in the
fifth set on his favorite grass-court surface against a Spanish
clay-courter.</LD>
<LD>   As Sampras went down a break in the fifth, the sun was going down
behind the Westside Tennis Club here on Friday during the United
States' Davis Cup quarterfinal against Spain. After Sampras lost to
Alex Corretja in a five-set stunner that lasted nearly four hours,
the metaphorical question hung in the air.</LD>
<LD>   Was the sun setting on Sampras' legendary career?</LD>
<TE>   It certainly appeared that way after Corretja defeated him, 4-6,
4-6, 7-6 (4), 7-5, 6-4, winning it with a 119-mph ace. That shocking
result evened the quarterfinal matchup, 1-1, after Andy Roddick beat
Spain's Tommy Robredo, 6-3, 7-5, 7-6 (7), in the opening singles
match.</TE>
<TE>   Because Sampras had never lost on grass after winning the first
two sets and Corretja possessed limited grass-court credentials--this
was merely his 10th career appearance on the surface--doubts about
Sampras' future were bound to surface.</TE>
<TE>   A Spanish journalist raised the point, asking the 30-year-old
Sampras: "One thing like this today, does it make you think your
career is coming to an end?"</TE>
<TE>   Though it was a valid line of questioning, the interview room grew
silent; amazingly, not even the squeal of a cell phone could be
heard.</TE>
<TE>   "That's your opinion, isn't it?" said Sampras, who has not won a
tournament in almost two years. The questioner chuckled, nervously.</TE>
<TE>   "Wait, is something funny? Do you think that's funny?" Sampras
said, sharply.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't supposed to turn out this way. Nearly everything
possible was done to make Sampras comfortable, short of moving this
Davis Cup quarterfinal to the All England Club at Wimbledon. The USTA
even passed on the chance to make more money by staging this event at
a smaller club on grass to accommodate him.</TE>
<TE>   The plan was running smoothly as Sampras easily took the first two
sets, breaking Corretja in the fifth game of the first and the
opening game of the second. But as often happens on grass, the crisis
for Sampras unfolded quickly, in the third-set tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   Corretja opened up a 6-0 lead, which included a service winner, a
double fault from Sampras and two volleying errors from Sampras.
Sampras fought off four set points, but Corretja won it on his fifth,
ripping a forehand cross-court return winner.</TE>
<TE>   It became clear that Corretja's success would not be a one-set
aberration in the first game of the fourth set. Sampras fought off a
break point and needed four deuces to hold serve. "I think he started
to slow down his second serve probably in the beginning of the third
set," Corretja said. "I was feeling like I have a nice moment to
break him every time."</TE>
<TE>   Corretja broke him at 15 in the ninth game of the fourth when
Sampras double-faulted. Sampras had 28 aces and 16 double faults, and
oddly, was called for five foot faults. Corretja had 12 aces and 18
double faults. In the next game, Sampras got the break back to pull
to 5-5 but lost his serve at 30 in the next game, and Corretja held
to push it to a fifth set.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of his career, Sampras had lost only twice after
winning the first two sets. But in the fifth set, Sampras hardly had
the body language of a confident champion and lost his serve in the
fifth game by double-faulting, missing long, on break point.</TE>
<TE>   Corretja, the two-time French Open finalist, was the one with the
fight and fire, and the one who went tumbling to the grass with a
Boris Becker-type plunge on the first point of the final game, and
held at love to finish off the memorable match.</TE>
<TE>   "My first-time highlight," Corretja said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Sampras: "I'm kind of kicking myself a little bit. Just can't
afford to take your foot off the pedal on grass. Just for a moment.
You know, it could change in a couple of minutes out there. And
anything can happen, and it did."</TE>
<TE>   The small band of Spanish supporters was ecstatic. This had been
designed as a form of American revenge on grass after the U.S. lost,
5-0, on clay in Santander in July 2000 in the Davis Cup semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Said one female reporter from Barcelona: "Now we can die. To win
the Davis Cup and beat Sampras on grass. That's all you can ask for."</TE>

<HD>Draft Rules on NCAA's Agenda</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NCAA will consider changing its rules to allow college football
and basketball underclassmen to be drafted by professional teams,
then change their minds and return to school.</LD>
<LD>   The changes are part of a series of proposals that will be
considered by the NCAA's Division I Management Council when it meets
in Denver starting Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal might affect decisions by NFL and NBA teams that
draft underclassmen knowing that returning to school is an option for
them. Under current NCAA rules, once a player is drafted, he can't
play his sport in college again.</LD>
<TE>   A key issue is whether an NBA team would retain rights to a player
if he returns to school, said Ryan Blake, the NBA's assistant
director of scouting.</TE>
<TE>   "Teams will be saying, 'Why would I pick an underclassman in the
second round or the low first round?' because you don't know if he's
going to come out," Blake said.</TE>
<TE>   Under current rules, underclassmen have the option of making
themselves available for the NBA draft and withdrawing a week before
the event. Underclassmen can also return to school after the draft if
they're not selected.</TE>
<TE>   The change would allow a player to be selected by a team, then
change his mind within 30 days of the draft and return to school with
his eligibility intact.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA's rules with the NFL are more strict. An underclassman
loses his college eligibility if he makes himself available for the
draft. The football proposal would give underclassmen the same
options as basketball players.</TE>
<TE>   Pro Football</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia Eagles withdrew the franchise tag on Jeremiah
Trotter, allowing the all-pro linebacker to become an unrestricted
free agent.</TE>
<TE>   Under the franchise tag, Trotter would have been forced to accept
a one-year contract believed to be worth about $5.5 million--based on
an average of the league's five highest paid linebackers.</TE>
<TE>   Trotter had said he wasn't pleased to have the franchise tag and
that he would rather be traded.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Bears released left tackle Blake Brockermeyer in a
cost-cutting move, but plan to continue negotiations with the
seven-year veteran.... Linebacker Earl Holmes, who led the Pittsburgh
Steelers in tackles last season, signed a five-year contract worth a
reported $17.5 million with the Cleveland Browns.... Offensive tackle
Jumbo Elliott re-signed with the New York Jets after sitting out last
season.... Linebacker James Farrior, who led the Jets in tackles last
season, agreed to terms with the Steelers on a three-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Dee Brown was hired as coach and general manager of the WNBA's
Orlando Miracle after recently finishing his NBA career with the
Orlando Magic.</TE>
<TE>   Brown left his job as a special assistant for the Magic. He played
seven games for Orlando this season, filling in when the team needed
backcourt depth.</TE>
<TE>   Meghann Shaughnessy overcame a match point in the second set to
defeat Russia's Anastasia Myskina, 3-6, 7-6 (6), 6-4, in the

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The St. Louis Blues didn't miss Chris Pronger one bit.</LD>
<LD>   Keith Tkachuk had two goals and an assist as the St. Louis Blues,
without their suspended captain, defeated the Chicago Blackhawks,
5-1, Friday night at St. Louis to gain some breathing room in a tight
playoff race.</LD>
<LD>   "That was a great two points," Coach Joel Quenneville said.
"Certainly, we did what we had to do and took care of business."</LD>
<TE>   Pavol Demitra scored twice for the Blues, who outshot the
Blackhawks 20-5 in the first 20 minutes. St. Louis has 90 points and
vaulted from seventh to fifth in the Western Conference, one point
ahead of the Kings and the Coyotes and only one point behind Chicago.
The Blues have five games left, all but one at home, where they're
24-11-1-1.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis outshot Chicago, 40-21, overall and won for the fourth
time in five games without two of its top three defensemen. Pronger
served the first game of a two-game suspension for cross-checking the
Brenden Morrow of Dallas in a 2-1 overtime victory on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 5, Minnesota 4--Brendan Morrison scored 2:23 into
overtime as the Canucks came from behind twice to keep their playoff
hopes alive with a win over the Wild at Vancouver, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Morrison broke in on a two on one with Todd Bertuzzi, kept the
puck, and snapped a wrist shot just past Dwayne Roloson's glove on
the short side.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver is unbeaten in its last five games and 9-2-1 in its last
12.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 3, Colorado 1--Jere Lehtinen, back in the lineup after
missing eight games with an ankle problem, scored twice and Jason
Arnott scored the 200th goal of his career as the Stars won at
Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Lehtinen is still in pain but returned because Dallas is in
desperation mode. The Stars are on the verge of missing the playoffs
after five consecutive division titles.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo 3, Florida 1--Taylor Pyatt had a goal and an assist to
keep the surging Sabres in the playoff hunt with a victory at
Buffalo, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   With four games left, the Sabres jumped into 10th place--a point
ahead of the New York Rangers--and moved within four points of eighth
place in the East.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 0, Washington 0--The Capitals, chasing Montreal and
Carolina for a playoff berth, played the first home scoreless tie in
the team's 28-year history</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 3, Atlanta 1--Sergei Brylin scored his third goal in
three games and Joe Nieuwendyk had his second goal for New Jersey to
lift the Devils at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Saku Koivu will not return to the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday
when the Columbus Blue Jackets visit the Molson Centre, a team
spokesman said. Koivu, who has missed the entire season recovering
from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, practiced with his teammates Friday, but
did not speak with reporters. It is still possible Koivu will make
his return in Tuesday night's game against Ottawa.</TE>

<HD>Home Opener a Real Rusch for Brewers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Glendon Rusch can't remember ever having such good control of his
pitches, but the one he'll never forget was a hanging, 77-mph
curveball from Rick Helling.</LD>
<LD>   Rusch sent it out of the ballpark for his first career homer,
putting an exclamation point on his three-hitter and Milwaukee's 6-2
victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks in the Brewers' home opener
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "I really didn't know what to do. I had never hit one before,"
Rusch said after his spectacular Brewer debut. "I probably made it
around the bases faster than I ever will." Rusch became the first
Milwaukee pitcher to homer since Paul Rigdon connected off Rob Bell
on Sept. 27, 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Rusch's two-run shot off Helling (0-1) in the fifth gave Milwaukee
a 3-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't make mistakes like that, especially against the
pitcher," Helling said. "The energy of the crowd, the energy of their
team, you could tell changed. When the pitcher hits a home run, it's
a pretty rare occurrence, so I think that kind of energized them a
little bit and deflated us a little bit.</TE>
<TE>   "From there, the game was pretty much over. He pitched great the
rest of the way."</TE>
<TE>   The last Brewer pitcher to throw a complete game in the home
opener was Mike Caldwell in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Rusch did it with uncanny control of his changeup, fastball and
curve.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I've got the best command of my changeup that I've
ever had," said Rusch, who attributed his control to job security in
spring training, which allowed him to work on the pitch without
fearing repercussions.</TE>
<TE>   New York 9, Atlanta 3--Jeromy Burnitz hit a three-run homer and
drove in four runs, Mike Piazza had a solo homer and Pedro Astacio
won in his Met debut, giving up three runs and seven hits in 62/3
innings at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Piazza scored four runs and Edgardo Alfonzo had three of the Mets'
13 hits.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 8, Cincinnati 7--Masato Yoshii gave up one run and seven
hits in six innings at Cincinnati as the Expos built an 8-0 lead and
held off the Reds.</TE>
<TE>   Vladimir Guerrero and Brian Schneider each drove in a pair of runs
as the Expos had 12 hits off Jimmy Haynes and four relievers.
Montreal scored five runs in the second, helped by three errors.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 5, Houston 1--Jim Edmonds hit a two-run homer and went
three for four to lead the Cardinals at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonds, five for 10 with three home runs and seven runs batted it
against Dave Mlicki, homered in the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 2, Chicago 1--Dave Williams gave up a homer to Sammy
Sosa--his third of the season--but the Cubs only had three other in
their home opener.</TE>
<TE>   Williams pitched six strong innings as the Pirates won for the
third time in four games--their best start since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 6, Florida 2--Bobby Abreu went four for four with a
homer and three RBIs, and Brandon Duckworth had a career-high 10
strikeouts to lead the Phillies in their home opener.</TE>
<TE>   Julian Tavarez gave up six runs and six hits in three innings in
his first start for the Marlins since being traded from Chicago.</TE>

<HD>Baldwin Strong for Mariners</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The Seattle Mariners think James Baldwin is going to fit in nicely as
Aaron Sele's replacement in their rotation.</LD>
<LD>   Baldwin pitched seven strong innings in his Seattle debut and the
Mariners defeated the Oakland Athletics, 7-1, Friday night behind
homers by Bret Boone and John Olerud.</LD>
<LD>   "Baldwin pitched awfully well," Manager Lou Piniella said. "He
stayed ahead of most of the hitters and mixed his pitches very, very
well. He stayed strong throughout the ball game."</LD>
<TE>   Baldwin gave up five hits, including a sixth-inning homer to
rookie Carlos Pena. He walked one and struck out six.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a beautiful start," Baldwin said. "It was just good to get
that first one out of the way."</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin went 10-11 for the Chicago White Sox and Dodgers last
season and then signed with the Mariners for $1.25 million. He
underwent shoulder surgery after the 2000 season when he won 14 games
for the White Sox and helped them reach the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin took a one-hopper off the bat of Miguel Tejada off his
left foot for a hit in the fifth, but was OK. He waved off trainer
Rick Griffin before Griffin could reach the mound.</TE>
<TE>   "He told the trainer to get the heck out of there," Piniella said.
"He competes very well. We've known that."</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin said there was no way he was going to come out.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want nobody out there," he said. "I wanted to stay out
there. Actually, it didn't hurt. When you're out there, you don't
feel any pain."</TE>
<TE>   Winning their third in a row after an opening-day loss to the
White Sox, the Mariners staked Baldwin to a 3-0 lead in the first.</TE>
<TE>   After a one-out single by Mark McLemore, Boone hit his first homer
of the season. Olerud followed one out later with his first homer of
2002.</TE>
<TE>   Erik Hiljus walked Boone and Edgar Martinez to open the third
before Olerud doubled in Boone for his second run batted in. Olerud
went three for four with a homer and two doubles.</TE>
<TE>   For Pena of the A's, he hit his third home run in his fifth major
league game.</TE>

<HD>Athens Picking Up the Pace for 2004</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATHENS, Greece</DL>
<LD>Staggered two years ago by mismanagement and missed deadlines,
preparations for the 2004 Olympics have undergone a dramatic
turnaround.</LD>
<LD>   International Olympic Committee executive Denis Oswald ended a
three-day inspection of facilities Friday with an encouraging update,
citing improvements in construction projects and hotel space.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very happy to report today that the situation has changed
tremendously," Oswald said.</LD>
<TE>   But he warned against complacency.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everything is still feasible," he said. "We just have a
tight schedule and have to follow very closely the progress of the
work."</TE>
<TE>   One of Oswald's concerns during his previous visit, in January,
was a shortage of 2,800 hotel rooms. Athens Olympics organizers said
they have booked half that number of rooms for sports federations
officials and sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   Oswald said intense work must continue at delayed venues such as
the sailing center and a complex that will house boxing, taekwondo
and handball. The sailing center is scheduled to have the first
Olympic test event in August.</TE>
<TE>   He praised Premier Costas Simitis for taking control and
pressuring often disorganized government officials to slash through
bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   "The progress in construction is both obvious and encouraging, as
is the new level of collaboration achieved among the organizers,"
Oswald said.</TE>
<TE>   In a document obtained by the Associated Press, Athens organizers
told the IOC there has been an "intensification of cooperation" with
the government.</TE>
<TE>   The organizers also expressed "overall satisfaction" with
transportation projects to ease traffic in Athens, where a rush-hour
trip of six miles can take an hour.</TE>
<TE>   But security and Athens' notorious traffic "will be a concern till
the end," Oswald told reporters, and he appealed for the government
not to scale back roadwork.</TE>

<HD>Actions of Jim Brown Convey This Message Too</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the last two weeks Jim Brown, the football icon, a proud,
outspoken man who has been relentless with his efforts to make a
difference to young men of color, who works hard with gang members to
help them change their young lives for the better, a 66-year-old with
the strong body of an athlete and the strong will of an educated man
confident in his worth and his ideas, has become something of a media
darling.</LD>
<LD>   In the last 10 days, Brown has been on ESPN with Bob Ley, on HBO
with Bob Costas and interviewed for a column in the New York Times.
With Ley, Brown mentioned his name and Nelson Mandela's in the same
breath, though Brown did have the sense not to equate his six-month
jail term with Mandela's 27 years spent in an island prison.</LD>
<LD>   A New York Times writer wrote: "Every superhero or
larger-than-life figure has a gross flaw."</LD>
<TE>   A flaw. That's what it is now to be jailed for aggressive behavior
toward women.</TE>
<TE>   Brown is in Ventura County jail, serving a six-month sentence for
smashing the windows of the car belonging to his wife, Monique.
Offered a chance to avoid prison by, among other things, doing
community service and undergoing counseling and making a contribution
to a battered women's shelter, Brown refused and chose to serve out
his jail sentence for misdemeanor vandalism. Brown was acquitted of
the charge of making a terrorist threat during an argument with his
wife.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble had begun in 1999 when Monique made a frantic 911
call. She was "frightened," according to the transcript of that call,
made from the home of a neighbor. Brown was breaking the windows of
her car with a shovel and Monique told the 911 operator that Brown
had threatened to kill her and that there had been a history of
domestic abuse.</TE>
<TE>   A day later, Monique said those had been false statements and that
Brown had not threatened her, a recanting that is not an uncommon
occurrence, according to domestic abuse experts. This was the fifth
time Brown had been accused of domestic violence since the 1960s. All
of the women ultimately refused to testify against Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Ley says that whatever you want to think of Brown, "he is willing
to sacrifice six months of his life to stand up for a principle."</TE>
<TE>   One woman accused Brown of throwing her off an apartment balcony.
Brown said the woman jumped. Monique Brown said she told the 911
operator Brown had threatened to kill her to draw police to the
house. Really, Monique Brown said, she only wanted her husband not to
leave on a planned trip and to talk to her about her fears he was
having an affair. Brown smashed the car with a shovel out of
"frustration," Brown has said to Ley, to Costas, and on "Larry King
Live" two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   While he was handling all of his media chores from prison, Brown
was also fasting. Not to protest his jail treatment, he said, but to
clarify his mind and body. After more than two weeks of fasting,
Brown began eating again Easter Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   We haven't heard much about Brown eating. We heard all about the
fast.</TE>
<TE>   Doing his interviews from jail, explaining his principled stand
and his empowering fast, it was as if we were watching Martin Luther
King Jr. from the Birmingham, Ala., jail.</TE>
<TE>   Brown told Ley he was "picked out as a political example." Brown
said, "There is something always that we, as black men, have known is
that if you are a strong, upstanding black man, that isn't very
acceptable in this country."</TE>
<TE>   He even told Ley: "I have been charged with many things that have
nothing to do with women." And finally, about his being in prison:
"It's almost like destiny, it's almost like I had to come here
because if I come here and do my time, then those enemies will have
to say that he's done his time.... So it's been almost
inspirational."</TE>
<TE>   Is this what we've come to?</TE>
<TE>   Our flawed heroes do inspirational jail time and become mythic
figures of great principle after a series of threatening run-ins with
women who have charged physical abuse?</TE>
<TE>   Brown always has been a man of substance and one willing to take a
stand with his actions and his words.</TE>
<TE>   As a future Hall of Fame player in Cleveland, Brown founded the
Black Economic Union to help professional athletes establish
businesses, youth programs and athletic clubs. He also formed
Amer-I-Can, a program to help gang members and prison inmates learn
the life skills to help them become successful adults. Brown brings
these troubled young men into his home.</TE>
<TE>   The sad part of this is that these men, who learn so much good
from Brown, also see him refuse to admit he might have a problem with
the way he treats women, refuse to give his aid to an abused women's
shelter or even try to understand what it is inside him that is so
clearly a serious problem with serious consequences to Brown and to
the women in his life.</TE>
<TE>   If a man with the moral standing Brown has brought to the minority
male community refuses to accept his "flaw" and deal with it and fix
it, how do we expect things to get better?</TE>
<TE>   In his Costas interview on HBO's "On the Record," Brown said, "I
will never again raise my hand to anyone regardless of what they do
to me. It's such a weak gesture. I regret any physical acts against
anyone."</TE>
<TE>   That sounds a little like a confession. A small step, maybe. A
larger step would be for Brown to step out of prison and onto the
pulpit he is so eagerly offered by television, radio and newspapers
and to speak about evil of violence against women, about how
difficult it might be to acknowledge the problem when it's personal
and how necessary it is to stop such behavior. Then Brown can be a
hero without a flaw.</TE>

<HD>Baseball Part of Family Fun for Fisher</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Not so long ago, on a Little League field in Riverside, the Fisher
brothers were engaged in a strange duel.</LD>
<LD>   Erik, 12, was on the mound. Kiel, 9, was catching. Erik became
frustrated and upset. Their father, Mac, walked to the mound and
tried to figure out what was wrong.</LD>
<LD>   "Dad, Kiel's making faces at me underneath his mask," Erik said.
"Tell him to stop."</LD>
<TE>   So ended the days of one Fisher brother catching for the other.
There are no hard feelings.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Erik, 21, is getting married after graduating from
the Air Force Academy. Kiel, 18, will be the best man. He's supposed
to say a few words in a toast.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm working on it," Kiel said.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone is holding his breath because having fun is part of
Kiel's personality and making people laugh is his life's mission,
next to hitting a baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Kiel, pronounced Kyle, is a 6-foot-4, 195-pound senior third
baseman at Riverside Poly High. He has spent nearly as much time
wearing a baseball uniform as pajamas.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball has definitely shaped me," he said. "It's part of what I
am. When you've been doing it your whole life, it almost becomes
second nature."</TE>
<TE>   He signed with Cal Poly San Luis Obispo last November. He has a
4.0 grade-point average and scored 1250 on the SAT. He hit six home
runs and drove in 39 runs as a junior. This season, he has seven home
runs and is batting .438.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been able to hit the ball," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside Poly begins play in the Babe Herman tournament today at
Arcadia High. Crescenta Valley, Palos Verdes Peninsula, West Torrance
and La Habra Sonora are the other top teams competing through
Wednesday at Arcadia and Stengel Field in Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   As devoted as Fisher is to baseball, he has never lost perspective
on why he plays the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't be playing if it wasn't fun," he said. "Myself and all
my teammates, we play because we love it."</TE>
<TE>   But Fisher isn't consumed by baseball. He's perfectly comfortable
acting like a kid.</TE>
<TE>   That's why he came home last month all excited, not because he hit
two home runs against Valencia, but because he learned that the
brother of shortstop Eric Harryman is friends with the drummer from
Blink-182.</TE>
<TE>   While his parents were gushing over his home runs, Fisher kept
changing the subject.</TE>
<TE>   "This is more important," he said. "He's going to get us backstage
passes for Blink-182."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Aaron Moore of Riverside Poly has difficulty not smiling
when the subject turns to Fisher.</TE>
<TE>   "He's smarter than I'll ever be," he said. "I can't even spell
some of the classes he's taking. He's got a great personality. He's
very outgoing. He knows when to joke, when to work hard. I wish I had
nine of him."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher's mother is a schoolteacher. His father is a lawyer. His
brother pitches for Air Force. Fisher plans to major in political
science in college.</TE>
<TE>   He just might follow his father into the legal field because he's
good with dramatic closing arguments.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm pretty persuasive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His mother supposedly named him after one of the actors from the
television series, "Hill Street Blues."</TE>
<TE>   He's good at practical jokes, such as sending a freshman junior
varsity player on a search for things he'd never find--a left-handed
fungo, a key to the batter's box, a box of curveballs and a fence
drill.</TE>
<TE>   "It went on for about an hour," Fisher said. "He thought we were
serious. He'd go back down to the JV field and ask the JV coach."</TE>
<TE>   Playing baseball is what Fisher wants to do for as long as he can.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the tools," he said. "I just have to continue to improve."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher knows first hand that baseball is a game of hits and
misses. As a sophomore against Santa Ana Mater Dei, he went four for
four. As a senior against the Monarchs, he went hitless in six
at-bats of a doubleheader and made three errors.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty upset," he said. "I played pretty bad."</TE>
<TE>   When he got home, his father greeted him.</TE>
<TE>   "He treated me the same as if we won the game," he said. "He
patted me on the back and said, 'You'll get 'em tomorrow.' "</TE>
<TE>   Such is life in the Fisher house, where everyone has a clear
understanding what's important and having fun is near the top of the
list.</TE>

<HD>Trabuco Hills Boys Not at a Loss Anymore</HD>

<LD>Good things come to those who wait. Just ask the Trabuco Hills boys'
volleyball team.</LD>
<LD>   The Mustangs have won more matches this season than they had in
the past four years combined. En route to their 7-1 record, the
Mustangs defeated Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley and Lake Forest El
Toro for the first time in school history.</LD>
<LD>   "Before this year, we were something like 6-50. We just really
struggled," Coach Craig Moothart said. "We used to go into games just
hoping that nobody would get hurt. Now, we step on the court and know
we can beat anybody."</LD>
<TE>   Why the big turnaround? One word: leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Players John Kupper and Tyler Whalen honed their volleyball and
leadership skills by playing club volleyball in the off-season."John
has really pushed everyone to win," Whalen said. "He has been on
varsity two years before this, and he was tired of losing. Last year,
we'd be losing and he'd be giving up on us. But this year, he always
knows we can come back at any time."</TE>
<TE>   Moothart, a former 10-year member of the Assn. of Volleyball
Professionals tour, encouraged the players to make a bigger
commitment to volleyball in the off-season through strength training,
lifting weights daily in the fall and practicing plyometrics to
improve their jumping ability. During the season, he has emphasized
mental preparedness by having the players go through visualizations
before games.</TE>
<TE>   Going into the season, the Mustangs knew they had a chance to win
more matches this year, with key players in their second and third
years on varsity. They won the Division II title at the Orange County
Championships by defeating Santa Ana Foothill, 15-1, 16-14, 15-13.
Only days earlier, the Knights had handed the Mustangs their first
and only loss of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "That win really made us believe in ourselves," Whalen said. "We
showed them that we're better, and we showed people we're a good
team."</TE>
<TE>   No one is more excited about the Mustangs' success than Joe Ochoa
and Nate Cruz, former Trabuco Hills volleyball players who coach the
school's freshman team.</TE>
<TE>   "[The coaches are] so happy for these guys," Moothart said. "They
were here when the team couldn't win a game, and now they're living
vicariously through this year's team."</TE>
<TE>   A South Coast League title had never been a realistic goal for
Trabuco Hills before this season, but that's no longer out of reach.</TE>
<TE>   All for one: Even without its best player, Santa Ynez (10-0)
finished tied for fifth in the Dos Pueblos tournament at UC Santa
Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   While his teammates took the floor in Santa Barbara, Matt
McKinney, who signed with UCLA and was the 2001 CIF player of the
year, was in Atlanta watching the NCAA men's basketball Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   In McKinney's absence, Aaron Richman, Jeff Urtonis and Nate Alker
stepped up to lead the Pirates past Mission Hills Alemany, Los
Angeles University and Oxnard. Urtonis' play earned him
all-tournament honors.</TE>
<TE>   "To get fifth at Dos Pueblos with that group is a big finish,"
Coach Chip Fenenga said.</TE>
<TE>   "The younger kids who came in were real competitive, and with the
seniors pushing them, we just really did well."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ynez is no stranger to success. The Pirates have won
Southern Section titles in six of the last seven years, including the
last three in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Their next big test will be April 26-27 at the Santa Barbara
Tournament of Champions.</TE>

<LD>A month after he lost the contest for the 2nd District City Council
seat, Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama City) said Friday he has
filed to raise funds to run for the 6th District seat next year.</LD>
<LD>   Under a redistricting plan recommended by a citizen's panel to the
City Council, the 6th District would be moved from West Los Angeles
to the east San Fernando Valley, including the neighborhood where
Cardenas lives.</LD>
<LD>   Cardenas noted that his Assembly district includes 60% of the
proposed 6th Council District.</LD>
<TE>   Two other people--Michael Bonin and Sheila Bernard--filed in the
6th District, but did so before the new boundaries were proposed.</TE>

<LD>Rocker Marilyn Manson defended himself against a wrongful-death
lawsuit filed against him by the mother of a Los Angeles woman killed
in a car accident a year ago after an all-night party at Manson's
house.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement through his Posthuman Records Management label,
Manson said the April 1, 2001, accident that killed Jennifer Syme, a
Los Angeles record executive, was a tragedy, and that the lawsuit
filed this week by her mother, Maria St. John, was a surprise.</LD>
<LD>   "After Jennifer was sent home safely with a designated driver, she
later got behind the wheel of her own car for reasons known only to
her," said the controversial rocker, whose real name is Brian Warner.</LD>
<TE>   After leaving Manson's house at about 6 a.m., Syme crashed her
1998 Jeep Cherokee into some parked cars in the 2100 block of North
Cahuenga Boulevard. The 29-year-old was ejected from the car and died
at the scene.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura woman accused of helping two skinheads kill a teenage girl
pleaded not guilty Friday to murder charges as her defense lawyer
demanded access to documents he contends support claims of misconduct
by law enforcement.</LD>
<LD>   State prosecutors last month dismissed the murder indictment
against Bridget Callahan, 30, to avoid a possible legal challenge and
filed a new criminal complaint.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Callahan pleaded not guilty to the October 1998 slaying
of Nichole Hendrix, 17, of Ventura. A preliminary hearing was set for
July 9, and she remains in custody without bail.</LD>
<TE>   During the arraignment, Ventura County Superior Court Judge
Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. expressed frustration with the slow pace of
the case and a three-month delay before the preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Atty. Gen. Michael Katz and defense lawyer Joseph
O'Neill, who is not related to the judge, said they need time to pore
over 20,000 pages of new documents provided by the Ventura County
Sheriff's Department and the Ventura County district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "We have information that we didn't have before," said Joseph
O'Neill, who is demanding even more information be turned over.</TE>
<TE>   The defense attorney contends that investigators and prosecutors
deceived his client in late 1999 with false promises of immunity in
exchange for information about the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   After she cooperated, Callahan was indicted for murder under a
theory that she served as a lookout for two skinhead gang members who
allegedly stabbed Hendrix to death at the City Center Motel in
Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, O'Neill accused prosecutors of withholding evidence
potentially relevant to his claims that they misled his client. He
told the judge that he believes undisclosed materials exist that
could be important.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, he said he wants to know more about a misconduct
investigation into a "rogue deputy" and any inducements offered to
Roy Ashlock, an accomplice who served a year in jail after admitting
to helping the two skinheads dispose of Hendrix's body.</TE>
<TE>   A motion filed by the defense seeks audiotapes and reports
concerning any complaints made by Ashlock about his dealings with law
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill also wants all records concerning any internal
investigation into the actions of Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron
Bamieh and investigator Mark Volpei.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh and Volpei worked on the Hendrix investigation
intermittently for three years and were recently removed from the
case. They have denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Judge O'Neill did not rule on the motion, but asked the defense
lawyer to put a more specific request in writing.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan was originally scheduled to stand trial this month, but
the case has been set back by a string of legal disputes. The first
delay came when the attorney general agreed to take over the case
from the district attorney's office amid O'Neill's misconduct claims.</TE>

<HD>Church, Costco at Odds Over Site</HD>
<DH>Land: Cypress officials recommend that retail project, not
Cottonwood Christian Center, be built near Los Alamitos track.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not exactly a Solomon's choice, but Cypress redevelopment
officials are recommending the city back plans for a Costco near the
storied Los Alamitos horse track, and turn down a prior bid for a
4,700-seat mega church.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council will consider the recommendation Monday despite a
lawsuit Cottonwood Christian Center filed in January that accuses
Cypress officials of violating federal law by hindering its efforts
to build a church within the Los Alamitos Race Track and Golf Course
Redevelopment Project.</LD>
<LD>   City officials could not be reached for comment Friday. The
recommendation is on Monday's council agenda.</LD>
<TE>   Church officials, who have been planning a $50-million complex on
the 18-acre site for 21/2 years, said they learned about the
recommendation when they checked the meeting agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood spent $13 million for six contiguous land parcels at
Katella Avenue and Walker Street in 1999 and petitioned the city in
2000 to let it build a church complex. City officials, instead,
declared a two-year moratorium on developing the site, which lies
within the Los Alamitos redevelopment area.</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood and city officials have been negotiating a land swap in
recent months that would move the church to an adjacent site and make
way for a Costco on the vacant prime corner location the church owns.</TE>
<TE>   It was not clear what the city's recommendation would do to those
efforts, but church officials were openly frustrated Friday."It
appears their goal is to drive the owners off and put retail there,"
said Mike Wilson, Cottonwood's project director.</TE>
<TE>   A church attorney said Cottonwood officials would consider legal
options, including seeking an injunction, if the city presses ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "It brings into question whether the city has ever negotiated in
good faith," said Jon Curtis of Los Angeles, the church's attorney.
"Their conduct is just outrageous to me."</TE>
<TE>   Retail use would bring in tax revenue. City officials have said
they prefer shops, which they feel would complement the racetrack,
which is adjacent to the Cypress Golf Club.</TE>
<TE>   The 4,000-member church hopes to build a house of worship,
conference rooms, youth center, licensed preschool, bookstore and
coffee shop.</TE>

<HD>'Cutters' Learn How to Heal Their Scars</HD>
<DH>Health: Nation's first residential self-injury treatment
program helps teens overcome a dangerous obsession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The teenager tugs at the sleeves of her oversized sweatshirt and
pulls them over her hands. She wants to make certain that the scars
on her arms do not show.</LD>
<LD>   "You don't want people to know," said 14-year-old Danielle
Opremcak. "People who cut themselves feel really guilty and ashamed
afterward. You're not proud of it."</LD>
<LD>   Danielle knows. For three years, she has repeatedly sliced her
arms and legs with razor blades and pieces of glass.</LD>
<TE>   The ritual of self-injury began as an attempt to gain the
attention of her parents, Danielle said. Later it became an
addiction. Now, however, she is sitting in the dimly lighted office
of a therapist, learning all over again how to live.</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't realize it, but she is a pioneer in a crash-course
effort to help teens overcome a habit that for decades has puzzled
parents and experts alike.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle is participating in the nation's first residential
self-injury treatment program--a year-and-a-half-old effort to assist
emotionally disturbed youngsters at the Vista del Mar children's home
in West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Physically injuring oneself is emotionally satisfying to some
youngsters--most often girls--who say they feel cleansed and in
control when they cut their skin and bleed. Many liken the euphoria
they feel to that created by drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The self-injurer is often left feeling worthless and ashamed when
that feeling wears off, however. So the cutter repeatedly reaches for
a knife or shard of glass. Short-term psychological counseling for
adolescent "cutters" has been offered for years at psychiatric
hospitals and clinics.</TE>
<TE>   But treatment has not been available at children's homes that
cater over a period of months to troubled youngsters sent by court
order--or by frantic parents who no longer can handle their
teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, we've thought these kids were self-destructive,
suicidal. As soon as a kid experienced self-mutilation, we would
hospitalize them. It would be interpreted as a suicide attempt," said
Gerald Zaslaw, president of Vista del Mar Child and Family Services.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Behavior Not Suicidal or to Get Attention</TE>
<TE>   But that was before studies in the late 1990s suggested that
adolescents who cut themselves are not trying to kill themselves.
Instead, experts concluded, cutters are teens caught up in a habit
that to them is alternately a crutch and a curse.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been seeing these self-injuring kids for 30 years," Zaslaw
said. "It wasn't until 18 months ago that someone sat me down and
identified to me this is a specific type of behavior that needs
specific treatment. It's not suicidal, it's not an attention-getting
gesture."</TE>
<TE>   Vista del Mar residential counselor Andrew Levander agrees. He has
spent 41/2 years working with the home's 30 teenage girls. The
private, nonprofit center, with 114 beds, also serves troubled boys
elsewhere on its 17-acre campus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Counselor Gets New Insights</TE>
<TE>   "Before, the first thing I'd think when I saw a girl cut herself
was that it was a suicide gesture or it was poor impulse control or
attention-seeking," Levander said. "The girls would tell me, 'You
have it wrong: I'm not trying to kill myself. It's what I do to stay
alive.' They'd say it angrily. I felt completely ineffective."</TE>
<TE>   Vista del Mar administrators launched their treatment program by
dispatching Levander to Chicago to study a self-injury treatment
regimen devised by experts at a psychiatric hospital. Back in West
Los Angeles, he organized a program designed to teach alternatives to
cutting for the teenage girls.</TE>
<TE>   The 45-hour curriculum treats self-injurers with respect as they
are encouraged to replace their impulse to harm themselves with
better ways of feeling they are in control. Levander has a list of 58
alternatives, ranging from listening to music to planting flowers.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the teens are taught to recognize the roots of
their obsession. Typically, previous sexual or physical abuse or
continuing parental or school problems have led to a loss of
self-esteem that is to blame. Experts believe the habit is reinforced
by the euphoric effects of endorphins released in the brain as a
reaction to the injury.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-seven girls have participated so far in the program, which
is voluntary for Vista del Mar residents. Mandatory treatment would
not work, Levander and other experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle, an Agoura Hills resident who has lived at Vista del Mar
for six months, is one of five girls now taking part. With permission
from her mother, she freely discussed how she was introduced to
cutting.</TE>
<TE>   "I was 11 and in the hospital for depression when I saw my
roommate do it," she said. "My parents had divorced, we had moved
away from my dad and I was failing at school. My roommate in the
hospital cut herself. I thought I'd see if it worked with me.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning, I wanted mom or dad's attention. I wanted to
talk about why I was doing cutting. But nobody caught me doing it
until weeks afterward. After a while, I was doing it as an everyday
thing. I'd have sharp things in my backpack in school and go to the
restroom and do it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Low-Key Approach Is Nonjudgmental</TE>
<TE>   Danielle said Levander's low-key, nonjudgmental approach to
dealing with self-injuries keeps her coming to hourlong therapy
sessions on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.</TE>
<TE>   "Years from now, I really don't want to be a 20-year-old going
into the bathroom and cutting myself," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Another participant, Jamie Valade, 16, also began cutting herself
at age 11. She said she tried it after seeing it depicted in a movie.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Depressed Over Sexual Abuse</TE>
<TE>   Jamie said she was depressed, in part, because of past incidents
involving sexual abuse by nonfamily members. Soon, she was regularly
slicing her arms and legs with razor blades, glass and knives.</TE>
<TE>   "I was mad at myself. I blamed myself--I was punishing myself,"
she said. "I'd feel better for about 15 minutes afterward. I probably
went 50 times to the hospital. The guy at the emergency room knew my
name. He'd ask, 'Is there anything we can do? No? OK, goodbye.'"</TE>
<TE>   San Dimas resident Rikki Valade said it was heart-wrenching to see
her daughter harm herself. "Her therapist said to be supportive and
not make a big deal out of it. It was very frustrating watching her
do it," said Valade, who placed her daughter at Vista del Mar in part
because of the self-injury therapy program.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Plans to Expand Program for Boys</TE>
<TE>   Vista del Mar officials say they hope to expand the program to
boys' units. Although most self-injurers are girls, some experts feel
that up to 40% of those who harm themselves are boys.</TE>
<TE>   Operators of other children's residential homes, meantime, are
closely watching the West Los Angeles project. Six months ago,
Levander presented a paper outlining the program at an Atlanta
conference for professional therapists. He made a similar
presentation to California therapists last month in San Rafael.</TE>
<TE>   So far, operators of nearly 300 residential treatment centers
across the country have contacted Vista del Mar officials seeking
more information. They, too, may have mistakenly been labeling
self-injurers as suicidal and shipping them off to hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "We're thinking," Zaslaw said, "that there are a lot of kids all
over the country who are being treated for something they don't
have."</TE>

<HD>In L.A. Unified's Pilot Nutrition Program, Chefs and
Students Cook Up Curriculum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE STASSEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A high school senior who had never eaten an authentic Cobb salad was
the first to notice the missing ingredient: hard-boiled eggs.</LD>
<LD>   Retired chef Richard L. Morgan was so engrossed in his culinary
lesson at North Hollywood High School that he forgot to include the
eggs until Jayson Quinones reminded him.</LD>
<LD>   Morgan quickly chopped them up and added them to a three-gallon
stainless steel bowl containing a massive portion of the salad, which
originated at the famed Brown Derby restaurant where Morgan worked
for five years of his 60-year career.</LD>
<TE>   "Very few places make it right," said Morgan, 83, who recently
sent back a Cobb salad at a local restaurant because it contained
beets. "That's not a Cobb salad. That's false advertising."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan was at North Hollywood High as part of the Los Angeles
Unified School District's Chefs in the Schools program, which aims to
get students to make and eat more healthy food.</TE>
<TE>   About 500 youths at 25 schools are involved in the pilot chefs
program, in which they learn from professionals how to make
nutritious foods, including fruit smoothies, potato leek soup and
Belgian vegetable stew.</TE>
<TE>   Quinones, 18, said he liked chopping up lettuce, tomatoes and
avocado and enjoyed tasting his first Cobb salad.</TE>
<TE>   "I think kids will really get into it," he said. "When it comes
out well, they will have more incentive to cook something else."</TE>
<TE>   Some students in the school's Nutrition Advisory Council will
demonstrate the salad-making lesson to their peers and, program
organizers hope, to their parents. Others will paint murals about
healthy food or hand out samples of nutritious food during
mid-morning snack time.</TE>
<TE>   At Anatola Avenue Elementary School in Van Nuys, students dress up
as the "Singing Salad Sisters" for assemblies and croon about eating
more fruits and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   The district launched Nutrition Network, which oversees the chef
program, two years ago at 219 schools. It is part of a $4.8-million
program funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to instill good
eating habits among children.</TE>
<TE>   Some schools have developed on-campus gardens or added salad bars
to the cafeteria fare. Others receive a four-page Harvest of the
Month newsletter, which features a particular fruit or vegetable that
students can study as well as eat.</TE>
<TE>   The hands-on Chefs in the Schools program fulfills an important
need, educators say.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the time we're involved with reading and math, so health
and nutrition get pushed to the back," said Judy Franks, principal of
Van Nuys' Valerio Elementary School, where a chef recently visited.
"This is important, especially with what we're hearing about obesity
in children."</TE>
<TE>   According to a 1999 surgeon general's report, 13% of U.S. children
ages 6 to 11, and 14% of those 12 to 19, were overweight, putting
them at higher risk to develop heart disease and Type 2 diabetes.
Overweight children have a 70% chance of being obese as adults, the
study showed.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the problem of childhood obesity appears to be
worse than the national average. More than 40% of children were found
to be obese when UCLA surveyed roughly 900 students at 14 L.A.
Unified elementary schools in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Francine Kaufman, division head of endocrinology at Childrens
Hospital Los Angeles, called Chefs in the Schools a "baby step" in
the effort to reverse the trend of childhood obesity.</TE>
<TE>   "I applaud LAUSD and I don't want to diminish what they are doing,
but this is a very small piece to a huge solution," said Kaufman, who
is also president-elect of the American Diabetes Assn. "Schools need
to have a minimum [nutritional] requirement for every item sold on
campus, meaningful physical education for all students and
nutritional education, if we're going to turn back the tide."</TE>
<TE>   Johanna Anderson, nutrition program director for the Los Angeles
County Public Health Office, said the district has a "model program."</TE>
<TE>   "It's wonderful to have a connection with chefs in the community
who are doing very tasty recipes with nutritious food," said
Anderson, a registered dietitian.</TE>
<TE>   In August, UCLA's School of Public Health will release a study
evaluating the effectiveness of the Chefs in the Schools program.</TE>

<HD>Contract for Food at LAX Is Extended</HD>
<DH>Airport: Council approves deal through June 2008, after
workers say concessionaire is trying to fix problems raised earlier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council voted Friday to approve a controversial
2 1/2-year contract extension for Los Angeles International Airport's
major food and beverage provider, with lawmakers saying the company
had moved decisively to resolve complaints about poor working
conditions for employees.</LD>
<LD>   The council voted 10 to 1 to extend the city's agreement with HMS
Host Corp., despite earlier concerns by some officials that a single
city commissioner negotiated the deal, and complaints from union
groups that employees were being underpaid and denied breaks.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Nate Holden cast the lone vote against the contract. He
said the city had not bothered to confirm Host's assertions that it
lost money because of the remodeling of two terminals. Holden called
the validity of the deal into question, saying the city's chief
administrative officer forwarded the issue to the council without any
recommendation.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't have accountability for their loss of funds," Holden
said. "You're cutting a deal that's already been cut. It's not clean.
It's dirty."</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported in February that Airport Commission President
Ted Stein had bypassed normal channels by personally negotiating the
contract extension with HMS Host, a significant campaign contributor
to Mayor James K. Hahn. The mayor appoints commission members.</TE>
<TE>   The full Airport Commission approved the contract, although
Stein's exclusive handling of negotiations caused a rift with some of
his colleagues, who said they felt shut out of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   City Controller Laura Chick asked for a review of the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Although the city attorney's office advised that it is appropriate
for a single commissioner to negotiate with a contractor, that
opinion did not entirely settle the matter.</TE>
<TE>   At this week's meeting of the airport panel, commission Vice
President Warren Valdry asked for another opinion--on whether it is
appropriate for a commissioner to direct city staff without the full
commission's authorization.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Company Says It Lost $4.5 Million</TE>
<TE>   The new deal means the firm's contract to operate many of the
airport's restaurants will continue until at least June 2008. HMS
Host manages California Pizza Kitchen, Pizza Hut, Burger King and
Starbucks outlets there, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Host contends that the contract extension was fair because the
company lost $4.5 million when it was unable to open several
concessions in Terminal No. 7 and Terminal No. 4 while the facilities
were being remodeled by United Airlines and American Airlines,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   In his report, William T. Fujioka, the city's administrative
officer, said these financial losses "have not been verified/audited
by the [airport] department."</TE>
<TE>   Host agreed not to ask for compensation for the losses if its
contract was extended.</TE>
<TE>   The deal ran into another hurdle last week, when union members
complained to the City Council's Commerce, Energy and Natural
Resources Committee about their treatment by the concessionaire. The
workers said they were underpaid and denied breaks by HMS Host.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Employees Tell Council of Progress</TE>
<TE>   When workers returned Friday to address the same council
committee, they said they had begun to resolve their grievances with
the company.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here today to tell you that HMS Host made an effort to work
out these problems," said Ernesto Lara, a cook for Chili's restaurant
in Terminal No. 4. "They've promised to pay me money for unpaid wages
and breaks."</TE>
<TE>   The committee unanimously recommended the extension, sending it on
to the full council for the final vote.</TE>

<HD>Federal Housing Program on Hold</HD>
<DH>HUD: Officials cite violations in other cities. L.A.
nonprofit fears drop in homes fixed up and sold to the poor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A program that was supposed to sell as many as 1,700 rehabilitated
homes in Los Angeles to low-income buyers is being threatened by the
federal government's decision to suspend a nationwide initiative to
restore foreclosed properties for sale to the poor.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has suspended
the national pilot program, which allowed nonprofit organizations and
local governments to buy foreclosed properties at a discount and then
sell them to low-income buyers at affordable prices.</LD>
<LD>   HUD decided to suspend the program after a report by the agency's
inspector general found that three cities--San Bernardino,
Washington, D.C., and Rochester, N.Y.--had violated various
guidelines.</LD>
<TE>   Among violations cited were failing to rehabilitate homes and
selling properties for excessive prices.</TE>
<TE>   Local housing officials said the suspension will reduce the
availability of inexpensive, subsidized homes in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "What this is going to mean is that there will be the same level
of interest [by low-income home buyers] with very few homes," said
Ann Sewill, director of California programs for the Enterprise
Foundation, which administers the program in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of residents have expressed interest in the cut-rate
homes, and scores more have been attending home-buyer classes--a
requirement for participation in the program, Sewill said.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation, which has earmarked $32 million to purchase and
substantially rehabilitate the nearly 1,700 properties, had already
bought 235 homes in the city of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In San Bernardino County, which also operated under contract with
HUD, the program is credited with revitalizing neighborhoods. As of
February, the county had purchased 572 properties, with 406
rehabilitated and sold.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, HUD has made such agreements with 16 agencies or local
governments.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HUD Is Assessing Program's Efficacy</TE>
<TE>   But the department has formed a task force to assess the national
program's effectiveness and to develop program regulations. Its
inspector general's report cited a host of problems, including the
department's failure to implement regulations and establish
monitoring procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Those poor controls reportedly allowed some homes to be sold at
high prices and others without being rehabilitated.</TE>
<TE>   In some instances, the local nonprofits had turned their
operations over to for-profit developers, a HUD spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to insist on accountability and results," HUD
Secretary Mel Martinez said in a statement Friday. "This program
review will continue until there is no doubt it produces positive
results for communities."</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, San Bernardino County purchased
low-priced HUD homes and then sold them to the city of San Bernardino
at a discount.</TE>
<TE>   The reports said the city, however, resold the homes to for-profit
developers, who sold them to homebuyers at market price--in violation
of program rules.</TE>
<TE>   The county no longer sells homes to the city of San Bernardino,
the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Laurin, director of the Department of Economic and Community
Development for San Bernardino County, said all the problems raised
in the report have been corrected.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the county's contract with HUD has been "extended
indefinitely," he said, and the county continues to purchase HUD
homes.</TE>
<TE>   The HUD task force is scheduled to study the program for six
months. No agreements will be renewed with local agencies during this
period, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Suspension a Tough Blow for Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   The news is a tough blow for Los Angeles, where Enterprise Home
Ownership Partners has been welcomed as a much-needed player in the
move to increase homeownership among the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is home to more renters than any other city except New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement with HUD, Enterprise was a preferred buyer of
homes in an "asset control area" that included Watts, Canoga Park,
Boyle Heights, Highland Park, Pacoima and parts of South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The contract allowed the Enterprise Foundation to purchase homes
at a 50% discount. The foundation then worked with other
organizations to rehabilitate the homes.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Los Angeles Housing Department assists low-income
buyers by providing additional financing.</TE>
<TE>   Enterprise celebrated the sale of its first home to a Boyle
Heights family in February, and elected officials praised the
collaboration for increasing homeownership while at the same time
relieving neighborhoods of blighted HUD properties.</TE>
<TE>   Residents in some neighborhoods have long complained that HUD
properties often become magnets for gang members and drug users.</TE>
<TE>   The program is also a key element of the Los Angeles Housing
Authority's plan to boost homeownership among the poor.</TE>
<TE>   The agency planned to debut a program later this month to allow
some people with federal housing subsidies to use the so-called
Section 8 vouchers for mortgage payments on homes instead of for
rent.</TE>
<TE>   The Enterprise Foundation is one of two local sources of
affordable, subsidized homes in good condition, said Steve Renahan of
the city's Section 8 program.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of recycled homes will make it "very difficult" to find
low-cost homes in Los Angeles for people with federal housing
vouchers, Renahan said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Reps. Lucille Roybal-Allard and Xavier Becerra, both
Los Angeles Democrats, urged Martinez to extend HUD's agreement with
Enterprise, arguing that the Los Angeles program "has not suffered
from any of the issues identified by the HUD inspector general's
report."</TE>
<TE>   "It is helping low-income people achieve the American Dream,
strengthening the local tax base and economy, and ending the
devastating cycle of foreclosure in our neighborhoods," the lawmakers
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Homes Already Bought Unaffected, HUD Says</TE>
<TE>   HUD officials said the suspension should not affect local
organizations and governments, suggesting that they can continue to
rehabilitate and sell properties that they have already purchased.</TE>
<TE>   But Enterprise collaborates with 53 other agencies, Sewill said.</TE>
<TE>   And the program, 18 months in the making, relies on the constant
supply of homes that only HUD can provide.</TE>
<TE>   "If we interrupt that pipeline," Sewill said, "we will have to
rebuild that whole system."</TE>

<HD>Anaheim Man Is Driven to Promote Peace by Family's
Sufferings in Middle East War</HD>
<DH>Awards: Ra'id Faraj is among 20 who will be honored by the
Orange County Human Relations Commission for helping bridge gaps.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The irony is not lost on Ra'id Faraj.</LD>
<LD>   Half a world away, in his native town of Bethlehem, his family is
cowering under the advance of Israeli tanks in a perennial conflict
that has escalated recently in a vicious cycle of suicide bombings
and retaliations.</LD>
<LD>   Here in Orange County, Faraj, a spokesman for the Southern
California chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, will
be honored Sunday for seeking peace.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the very thing I hope we will never see in America," the
33-year-old Anaheim resident said of the tensions roiling his native
land. "I suffered so much from it. My family continues to suffer.
That is why I work so hard here."</TE>
<TE>   Faraj is among 20 people being recognized by the Orange County
Human Relations Commission for their work in bridging gaps among
diverse communities.</TE>
<TE>   The annual awards banquet will be at Garden Grove's Community
Meeting Center.</TE>
<TE>   For Faraj, Sunday will mark the highlight of a still-budding
career in community relations. He was hired by the Council on
American-Islamic Relations as its public relations director two years
ago, fresh out of Chapman University with degrees in peace studies
and organizational leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "I had hoped to go back" to the Middle East, Faraj said, "and help
make things work there. But I'm glad to be here and doing the work I
am doing."</TE>
<TE>   That work has become even more pertinent since the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11 and the ensuing backlash against Arab and Muslim
Americans, Faraj said.</TE>
<TE>   "We must avoid the propagation of myths and talk to one another,"
Faraj said. "That doesn't benefit just our group but society as a
whole."</TE>
<TE>   Faraj, the oldest of seven children, moved to Orange County in
1994 to pursue an education that was denied under the constant unrest
in the region, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in the occupied territories, he could go to class only
intermittently, when not prevented by roadblocks and school closures.</TE>
<TE>   Faraj's parents and four siblings live in Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   "They are scared," said Faraj, who keeps in touch with his family
by telephone. "They haven't left the house in a number of days."</TE>
<TE>   Faraj is critical of the Israeli government and its policy in the
occupied territories, but he intends to focus on unity, not
divisions, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Growing up, I knew nothing about Israeli society. I only saw the
soldiers and their M-16s.... There are more similarities among people
than differences."</TE>
<TE>   Among others being recognized are Allen Baldwin, executive
director of the Orange County Community Housing Corp., for working to
increase low-income housing in the county; Terry Anne Barman, a
Laguna Beach teacher and founder of a preschool program for the poor;
and Sid Gardner, an advocate of diversity and children's issues.</TE>
<TE>   Waleska Hernandez of Anaheim is being honored for organizing
children and their parents in her daughter's elementary school.
Phoebe Kassenoff and Fred Provencher will receive awards for their
volunteer work with the Huntington Beach Human Relations Task Force.</TE>
<TE>   Nahla Kayali, founder of Care "R" Us, will be recognized for her
work helping poor minority families find medical care.</TE>
<TE>   Frank P. Lobo, a member of the Acjachemem tribe of Orange County,
teaches young members of his tribe and others about Native American
culture and history.</TE>
<TE>   Roslyn Manley, a transgender woman, founded the Orange County
Transgender Taskforce last year, the first of its kind in the county.</TE>
<TE>   The commission will also recognize Ron Minekime, a member of its
Community Partners Advisory Board; Rick Mojarro, principal of Santa
Ana's Kennedy Elementary School; Joseph Pak, a Korean American
community leader; and Gwyn P. Parry, a doctor who founded a community
outreach program at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Rosalia Pinon of Costa Mesa volunteers at several organizations
and most recently helped save the city's day laborer job center.</TE>
<TE>   Elvia Ruiz survived an abusive relationship and is now director of
the Latina program at Interval House, a battered women's home in Seal
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Thies of Fullerton is an advocate for people with
disabilities, and Guadalupe Tinajero is a Santa Ana community leader.</TE>
<TE>   Also being honored are Ruth and Theodore Shapin of Orange, who
volunteer their time with several nonprofits, including Cousins Club
of Orange County, which promotes dialogue between Palestinians and
Jews.</TE>

<HD>Airline Faces Fines for Ferrying Illegals</HD>
<DH>Immigration: The INS had urged Qantas not to allow 17
Chinese nationals to board a flight to LAX. Airline may have to pay
$56,100.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qantas Airlines faces a federal fine of more than $50,000 after
failing to heed a U.S. law enforcement warning and allowing a group
of 17 undocumented Chinese passengers to fly to Los Angeles this week
from Australia, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The 17 Chinese nationals, who arrived Wednesday aboard Qantas
Flight 93 from Melbourne, were among the largest groups smuggled into
Los Angeles International Airport in recent years, officials said.
All were taken into INS custody but are expected to apply for
political asylum.</LD>
<LD>   Their presence alarmed federal authorities as the migrants landed
amid tightened airline security imposed after Sept. 11. The case also
occurred at a time when concern is mounting that Asian-based
smuggling syndicates may be turning anew to LAX and other major U.S.
airports to try to bring in groups of illegal immigrants.</LD>
<TE>   "That's both unusual and high these days," Michael Cronin, the
agency's assistant commissioner for inspections in Washington, said
of the 17 smuggled Chinese.</TE>
<TE>   Also dismaying, several officials said, is the likelihood that the
suspected smuggler--a U.S. passport-holder who is believed to have
accompanied the group from Melbourne--managed to escape. Authorities
said the group is likely part of a larger trafficking ring bringing
in people from southern China's Fujian province, a major source of
illegal immigrants. The 17 may have been in Australia for two weeks
before heading to Los Angeles, one official said.</TE>
<TE>   Smuggled Chinese often pay $35,000 or more to be slipped into the
United States, officials say. Once here, they often spend years
working off the debt in virtual bondage, as factory hands, cooks,
prostitutes or in other jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines are required to review the documentation of all
U.S.-bound passengers. Federal law subjects carriers to fines of
$3,300 for each arriving passenger lacking visas or other required
paperwork. The INS has moved to fine Qantas the maximum, $56,100,
said Francisco Arcaute, an INS spokesman in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In the Qantas case, the INS said officers examining airline
passenger data became suspicious a week before the flight left
Australia, in part because of the size of the group. U.S. authorities
alerted the airline and gave a "strong recommendation" that the group
not be allowed to board, said the INS spokesman. The passengers are
believed to have destroyed or hidden their passports after checking
in for the flight.</TE>
<TE>   Airline officials deny any wrongdoing and plan to appeal, said
Steve Kernaghan, a spokesman for Qantas, which has four nonstop
flights daily from Australia to LAX, its principal U.S. port of
arrival.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Bryan Banston, a Qantas senior vice president,
said that all paperwork is verified closely and that the airline
"adheres to rigorous security and procedural protocols in checking
and boarding passengers."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials worry about a return of the large-scale smuggling
of Chinese and other Asians--especially via LAX and New York's John
F. Kennedy International Airport--that prompted a major crackdown a
decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, smuggled passengers destroyed their passports after
boarding U.S.-bound aircraft, thus erasing evidence of phony
documents that could subject them to criminal prosecution. Many
applied for political asylum upon arriving in the United States,
posted bonds to get out of detention and then disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   In response, federal authorities tightened asylum rules, expanded
detention space and began holding suspected fraudulent asylum
applicants until they could be deported. In addition, the INS began
to work closely with airlines to identify smuggled groups before they
boarded aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, officials say, the number of foreign nationals
arriving at U.S. airports lacking proper documents has dropped
substantially.</TE>

<CX>   INS and Qantas--A story in the April 6 California section
incorrectly stated that the Immigration and Naturalization Service
notified Qantas Airlines a week in advance that 17 Chinese passengers
lacking proper paperwork to enter the United States might be arriving on
a flight to Los Angeles International Airport. The INS says it was
mistaken and that the airline was actually notified only one day in
advance, on April 2. Qantas denies wrongdoing in the case and is fighting
a proposed federal fine of $56,100.</CX>

<HD>Police Seek 6th Suspect in Kidnap of Man, 37</HD>
<DH>Crime: Huntington Beach officials have already arrested
five in the case of a businessman held for ransom 12 days.</DH>

<LD>Huntington Beach police are looking for a sixth suspect in the recent
kidnapping of a 37-year-old businessman held for nearly two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Five men have already been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping for
ransom. They are accused of seizing Sohiel B. Daliri on March 18 and
holding him until he was freed by police detectives and FBI agents
March 30 at a Long Beach motel.</LD>
<LD>   Daliri was found tied to a bed, blindfolded and gagged with duct
tape, police said.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, police Sgt. Gary Meza said further investigation has
led them to the sixth suspect, who remains at large. They are looking
for Scott Douglas Burns, 42, who last lived in Vista, Meza said. He
is 6 foot 2, 200 pounds and has brown hair and hazel eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Police have arrested Erick Velasquez, 20, of Rancho Santa
Margarita, who was found inside the motel room; Brian D. Dumas, 28,
of Huntington Beach; Esau Abrajan, 18, of Rancho Santa Margarita;
Nasir B. Shamsi, 40, of Placentia; and Brian D. Good, 27, of
Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Daliri was uninjured but was treated at a hospital for
dehydration.</TE>
<TE>   Police have not disclosed the link between Daliri and the
suspects. Daliri owns heating and air-conditioning shops in Fullerton
and Orange.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators asked Friday that anyone with information about
Burns' whereabouts call the Huntington Beach Police Department
hotline, (714) 375-5066.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There is talk of telling police as little as possible about priests
who were known sex offenders.</LD>
<LD>   There is the crafting of statements to avoid being caught in a lie
down the road.</LD>
<LD>   The truth is framed, needled and massaged in the name of
protecting the church.</LD>
<TE>   All this from those who hold themselves up as paragons of morality
and virtue, with God as their guide.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, having been told by a Los Angeles Archdiocese source
about a possible abuse allegation against Cardinal Roger Mahony that
dated back to his days in Fresno, I e-mailed the cardinal a question.</TE>
<TE>   Had he ever been accused? I asked.</TE>
<TE>   No interviews, he wrote back.</TE>
<TE>   And then Friday, Fresno police acknowledged an investigation, but
gave only the sketchiest of details.</TE>
<TE>   At midafternoon Thursday, I sent Mahony another e-mail asking to
discuss his internal memo titled "Our Biggest Mistake."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what memo you could be referring to," Mahony
responded.</TE>
<TE>   To help refresh the cardinal's memory, I sent it to him. Of the
several memos between him and his inner circle that had landed in my
hands regarding sex-abuse cases, I thought "Our Biggest Mistake" was
perhaps his best work in protecting the church's image.</TE>
<TE>   So I hit the "send" button and zipped Mahony his very own words
about three priests whom the archdiocese had not yet reported to
police. In the memo, Mahony expresses concerns about being dragged
before a grand jury, and possible "charges of cover-up, concealing
criminals, etc., etc."</TE>
<TE>   The "biggest mistake," as Mahony described it, was to avoid
notifying the police earlier. "By doing it back then, we would not
appear to have been crumbling under public pressure."</TE>
<TE>   With all due respect, I can think of several other nominations for
the church's biggest mistake. At the top of the list would be the
penchant for treating sex abuse like a threat to the church's public
image rather than the moral, ethical and criminal abomination that it
is.</TE>
<TE>   Everything is crisis management and damage control with this crew.
In dozens of memos, archdiocesan officials come off like Nixonian and
Clintonian operatives. They deliberate over the most effective ways
to couch explanations and tinker with definitions.</TE>
<TE>   In one memo, Mahony takes glee in reporting that he has not
divulged the total number of priests dismissed for abuse. In another,
one of Mahony's attorneys has this advice for two church officials
about to be interviewed by police:</TE>
<TE>   "Listen to their questions and take your time answering. Do not
volunteer information."</TE>
<TE>   A reasonable person might wonder if such advice approaches
obstruction.</TE>
<TE>   In another memo, a diocese attorney appears to be cautioning that
a planned public statement might be too truthful.</TE>
<TE>   "As written," the attorney says in a memo to Mahony and others in
the inner circle, "it gives the impression that for years we gave
names over to law enforcement contemporaneously with the time we
learned of the events. If an example of even one case comes out where
we didn't pass on the name then, but only more recently, it will blow
up."</TE>
<TE>   Guess what, counselor. It has blown up.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Mahony never did answer my e-mail Thursday about his "Our
Biggest Mistake" memo. But it didn't take long before I had one of
his attorneys barking in my ear.</TE>
<TE>   Before the day was done, the archdiocese had used its considerable
influence to arrange an extraordinary hearing in court near midnight,
trying desperately to put the kibosh on any publication or airing of
the memos by The Times or radio station KFI-AM (640).</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese lost, but in the process, acknowledged that indeed
those were Mahony's words in the "Our Biggest Mistake" memo.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the memos haven't been authenticated by the diocese,
which was too busy calling the FBI to see how certain members of the
media got their hands on them.</TE>
<TE>   Too bad they weren't that quick in notifying authorities about
predators within the church.</TE>
<TE>   If the archdiocese had been half as aggressive in making sure sex
offenders were removed from the ministry as they were in rushing
attorneys into court to hide unflattering secrets, it might not be in
the middle of this mess.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, Mahony said of Boston's scandal-rocked Cardinal
Bernard Law:</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how I could face people."</TE>
<TE>   It may be time to wonder the same thing about Mahony.</TE>

<HD>FBI Says 4 Jailed After Entering Marine Base</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four men who said they were trying to expose lax military security
were arrested for trespassing on the Camp Pendleton Marine base and
destroying more than 400 pounds of produce, meat and cheese in a
late-night food fight.</LD>
<LD>   The four, including two former Marines, videotaped their exploits,
intending to provide the tape to the news media as proof of
inadequate military security, Special Agent Jan Caldwell, a
spokeswoman for the FBI, said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The men, all self-employed alarm salesmen from the Los Angeles
area, were charged Friday with misdemeanor counts of trespassing,
malicious mischief, destruction of government property and false use
of a military pass, Caldwell said. They have not yet entered pleas.</LD>
<TE>   Late Wednesday night, the four drove onto the base after Brett
Jensen, 24, and Travis Delgadillo, 24, showed expired Marine ID
cards. The four allegedly drove to a mess hall, but a worker told
them the building was closed. Later, they forced their way in through
a rear window and picked the lock on a refrigerator, Caldwell said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say the men destroyed 12 pounds of cheese, 12 loaves
of bread, 75 pounds of honeydew melon, 198 pounds of watermelon, 20
pounds of mushrooms, 20 pounds of beef, 15 pounds of bacon, and 64
pounds of tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   The mess hall employee returned to the area, saw their car and
called military police.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen and Delgadillo were arrested along with Steve Esteves, 24,
and Peter Marshall, 35, about 2a.m. Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The men were turned over to the FBI and the Naval Criminal
Investigative Service, and booked into the federal jail in downtown
San Diego.</TE>

<LD>Police are investigating an apparent homicide after a tip led them to
a decomposed body near San Juan Creek on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Sheriff's detectives found a man's body about 1:30
p.m. under the Interstate 5 freeway overpass near San Juan Creek
Road, sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said.</LD>
<LD>   The man, between age 25 and 40, had not been identified late
Friday, and the cause of death had not been determined, Amormino
said, but investigators suspect homicide because they received three
anonymous calls in the last week about the body. An autopsy will be
conducted today.</LD>

<HD>Returning a Verdant Land to Its Roots</HD>
<DH>By leaving its patch of San Joaquin Valley forest and
fields to nature, a trust gives new life to the region's native
species.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1983, a conservation group paid $1 million for a small plot of San
Joaquin Valley oak forest and prairie just east of Visalia. It was
the kind of deal that raised eyebrows, because no one at the time
sank that kind of money into valley land unless the intent was to
farm, graze, drill or subdivide it.</LD>
<LD>   But there was something special about this place. In a region
spanning millions of acres, the 324-acre plot was one of the last,
best examples of how the San Joaquin Valley once looked.</LD>
<LD>   "When you talk about preserving open space, a lot of people in the
valley just sort of roll their eyes," said Scott Spear, president of
the Sierra Los Tulares Land Trust, the nonprofit group that runs the
preserve. "But protecting open space is not the same as protecting a
native landscape."</LD>
<TE>   After the land was acquired, trails were cut and signs posted
inviting hikers to visit. With dogeared field guides and clipboards,
volunteers combed the newly dubbed Kaweah Oaks Preserve, cataloging
every plant, animal and insect they could find, and trying to figure
out which species should be there but weren't.</TE>
<TE>   "We know so little about what these valley environments were like
because they were hit hard so early," said Kevin Rice, an ecologist
at UC Davis. "That's what makes it so hard to re-create. We know the
species that were there, but we don't know the structure--the
relationship between those species--because there just aren't many
remnant sites."</TE>
<TE>   Although researchers believe less than 5% of the native landscape
is left, most also agree the San Joaquin Valley was once one of the
continent's richest and most diverse ecosystems. Tens of thousands of
tule elk and antelope grazed expansive grasslands, and tens of
millions of waterfowl visited vast lakes and wetlands. Grizzly bears
prowled oak forests that surrounded the rivers, feasting on acorns
and berries.</TE>
<TE>   It began to disappear with the arrival of Spanish missionaries in
the 1770s. Domestic livestock brought weeds that corrupted native
grasslands, turning them into fields of exotics. Later, a maze of
irrigation ditches and aqueducts reworked the valley's natural
plumbing for the benefit of agriculture. The land was leveled, the
oaks cleared. By the time the word "ecology" was coined in the 1930s,
the valley's landscape had been transformed.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, the land that was to become the Kaweah Oaks Preserve
survived. The longtime owners never planted on the land because it
flooded frequently until the Kaweah River was dammed in 1962. But
cattle had the run of the place for decades and had nearly munched
many native plants out of existence.</TE>
<TE>   A simple, fateful decision was made by preserve volunteers. Other
than pulling a few weeds, the preserve would be left alone. A few
cows would be allowed to graze in the meadow, but they would be
removed from the woods. And that was all it took, said Rob Hansen, a
biologist and vice president of the land trust who in the past 18
years has watched the preserve spring back to life.</TE>
<TE>   Walking through the preserve on a recent afternoon, Hansen ticked
off a long list of native species, many of which could barely be
found in 1983. There's the California blackberry. Its small thorns
couldn't stop cattle from eating it. But cows wouldn't touch the
Himalayan blackberry, an exotic shrub with huge thorns that settlers
planted in 1909. Without constantly being pruned by cows, the
California blackberry has reasserted itself and taken back some
ground from its exotic competitor.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen pointed out sedges that some Native Americans still use to
make traditional baskets, and spoke of the huge crop of wild grapes
draping the oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "The vines eventually kill the trees, but we don't do anything,"
Hansen said. "They produce a huge amount of food for wildlife."</TE>
<TE>   He zeroed in on two chirps coming from opposite sides of a field.
Two male oak titmice were marking their territory. "We've counted 130
different species of birds in here, and I can hear five of them right
now."</TE>
<TE>   Hansen pointed out mice burrows, a fungus called turkey tail and
shrubs where the endangered valley elderberry beetle lives. And he
named a long list of species that will never come back, including the
grizzly bear. He talked about the surprisingly lush stand of trees,
mostly valley oaks, which live only in California and are the largest
of the oak species in North America.</TE>
<TE>   Thick groves of oaks once covered 400 square miles of the valley
floor. "The trees here aren't the monsters," Hansen said. "They'd be
bigger, but streams aren't flowing here where they used to, and
they're not flowing as long as they used to."</TE>
<TE>   Although amazed that such a wide variety of life exists on the
preserve--perhaps three times the number of species found in an
adjacent plum orchard--Hansen said there's much more at stake than
biodiversity.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of finding out who you are is developing a sense of place,"
he said. "A lot of kids who grow up here are ashamed of the valley.
It's not a 'cool' place like San Diego, L.A. and the Bay Area. But
the kids don't know what was here, what made it special."</TE>
<TE>   The late UC Berkeley geographer James Parsons made much the same
point in a 1987 lecture. He said there are three ways of looking at
the San Joaquin Valley. The first is to simply pass through it or
ignore it. The second is to hold it up as an example of capitalism
run rampant. Or, Parsons suggested, you can pull off the highway and
decide to look at it.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One man died early Friday and another was wounded after a gunman
opened fire on a parked car in Pico Rivera.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Michael Rodriguez of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department said William Rocha, 26, and Louie Soto, 18, were sitting
with another man and a woman in a car outside a home in the 4700
block of Orange Street around 11:30 p.m. Thursday when a white
vehicle stopped next to them.</LD>
<LD>   According to authorities, one of the occupants of the white car
asked the men where they were from, and when they replied that they
were "from nowhere," he opened fire, striking Rocha and Soto.</LD>
<TE>   Rocha was taken to County-USC Medical Center, where he was
pronounced dead at 12:24 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Soto was taken to Beverly Hospital, where he was released after
being treated for bullet wounds in the leg and arm. The occupants of
the white car escaped.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez said detectives are investigating the possibility that
the shooting was gang-related but added that they do not believe that
either Rocha or Soto was a gang member.</TE>

<CX>   Shooting victim--A story in Saturday's California section
incorrectly identified a man who had been fatally wounded in a shooting

<HD>Camarillo Teacher in Sex Case Returns to Jail</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Judge finds instructor, accused of crimes
involving 11 teens, violated terms of a previous release. Defense
argues 'letter or spirit' of order was not broken.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chad Pridgen, a Camarillo High School teacher and coach charged with
sexually abusing 11 male students, was returned to jail Friday in
lieu of $500,000 bail after a judge ruled Pridgen had violated terms
of a previous release and posed a threat to public safety.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Superior Court Judge Vincent O'Neill Jr. also
issued strict orders for Pridgen not to contact any minors, current
or former Camarillo High students, and barred him from using the
Internet except to communicate with his attorney.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe Mr. Pridgen is a danger and is unable to control
himself in his desire to have access to minors," O'Neill said in
court.</LD>
<TE>   "I find his behavior ... just scary to the point where the
public's safety becomes an issue," O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen is accused of having oral sex with or trying to seduce 11
teenage boys, all but two of whom are Camarillo High students.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say the alleged sex acts occurred at Pridgen's home,
where he frequently had students over for after-school and weekend
parties.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's hearing, attended by several alleged victims and their
families as well as supporters of Pridgen, stemmed from a motion to
increase bail filed by Deputy Dist. Atty. Douglas Ridley.</TE>
<TE>   On the previous release, after Pridgen had paid $250,000 bail,
Ridley said Pridgen got a job at a Sherman Oaks talent agency working
with children and teens and had planned an unrelated trip to
Washington, D.C. This was despite previous orders that Pridgen stay
away from minors and remain in California until the case is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen had also communicated via the Internet with a former
student who later was included as a victim in the prosecution's
complaint, Ridley said in court.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extremely disturbing that Mr. Pridgen would have applied for
a job where he would have to contact children and teens," Ridley
said. "This is exactly where he should not have been."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Takakjian, Pridgen's attorney, argued the evidence was
insufficient to suggest his client had violated the "letter or
spirit" of the terms of his release. Those terms, he said, stipulated
that Pridgen could talk to minors when they had their parents' direct
supervision.</TE>
<TE>   One woman from the talent agency told authorities she saw Pridgen
alone with a child. But Takakjian said at least three others said
they did not observe Pridgen alone with minors.</TE>
<TE>   On the witness stand Friday, Pridgen said he thought his job at
Options Talent was an ideal fit, because the agency requires all
children under age 18 be accompanied by a parent or guardian.</TE>
<TE>   While the position also required him to approach people he thought
could be potential models and actors, Pridgen said he chose not to
approach anyone under 18.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no opportunity for me to contact minors in this job,"
he said in court. "That's why it seemed like a safe opportunity
within the constraints of the restraining order."</TE>
<TE>   Takakjian also opposed the more strict probation terms Ridley had
suggested, saying the prohibition on computer use borders on a
civil-rights violation.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a point beyond which reasonableness must control, and I
think we are at that point," he said. "Let him live his life and help
me defend this case."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill, however, granted all of Ridley's requests. Because bail
hearings require a judge to assume all charges are true, O'Neill said
Pridgen should not be given much leeway.</TE>
<TE>   "The charges would suggest there was a gross violation of his
trust as a teacher," he said. "Bail is a condition of trust, as are
restraining orders."</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, Brenda Andrade, a Ventura attorney hired by one of
the alleged victims in the case, praised O'Neill's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the court recognized the danger Pridgen poses to the
public and correctly increased the bail," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The father of one of the alleged teen victims said he also was
pleased with the outcome of the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "My son is feeling much safer now," he said.</TE>

<HD>Valley Democrats Say No to Secession Plan</HD>
<DH>Politics: Municipal workers' union says it would deny
support for candidates who run in breakup election.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Democratic Party of the San Fernando Valley on Friday came out
strongly against the Valley secession plan and a large municipal
union said it would withhold support from any candidates who seek
office in a breakup election.</LD>
<LD>   The Valley party organization announced its position a day after
state Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar) said he is exploring a run for
mayor of a Valley city, providing the secession proposal makes the
November ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Alarcon's move also prompted Los Angeles' largest municipal labor
union to threaten any candidates on the secession ballot with a loss
of support in that election and future ones. The Service Employees
International Union has long opposed secession.</LD>
<TE>   "Any candidate who runs for office in a city that does not yet
exist, this local will consider them forever not to be our friend,"
said Julie Butcher, head of the union's 8,500-member Local 347, which
contends that secession could lead to job losses.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Daar, who heads the Valley's Democratic organization, said
his group would not make a secession candidacy a litmus test for
future support. But he said would-be candidates who are neutral on
secession itself, as Alarcon says he is, should not run.</TE>
<TE>   "Running for office in the proposed Valley city is supporting the
breakup of the City of Los Angeles," said Daar, who is also a board
member of the anti-secession group One Los Angeles. "Anyone that is
either neutral or opposed to secession should not run for mayor or
city council of the proposed Valley city."</TE>
<TE>   Javier Flores, vice president for the Mexican American Political
Assn., which opposes secession, said Friday that his group also was
disheartened with Alarcon's actions.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that the timing was wrong and wished he would have
waited a bit," Flores said. "By asking people to support his
candidacy, his run for Valley mayor will inadvertently cause Latinos
to support secession."</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon said his candidacy would ensure Latinos had a voice in the
campaign. He also said he has been an ally of Local 347 his whole
political career and had relatives in the union.</TE>
<TE>   "I realize my friends in labor are very opposed to secession, but
I didn't create this situation," Alarcon said. "I would feel horrible
if Valley secession succeeded and I had not offered my candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only could the Valley secede, but you could end up with
someone with no interest [in] civil rights and labor" as mayor.</TE>
<TE>   The Local Agency Formation Commission is set to decide next month
whether to place secession questions for the Valley, Hollywood and
the harbor area on the November ballot. The Valley Democratic Party
and the union also oppose the Hollywood and harbor measures.</TE>
<TE>   A Valley secession election would include races for mayor and 14
city council seats.</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon is the first prospective candidate for a Valley election.
He is also seeking reelection to the Senate in November. If secession
passes and he wins both the mayoral race and his Senate race, Alarcon
said he would resign from the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Los Angeles County Democratic Party, Vince
Roncone, said it would endorse secession candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "If secession qualifies for the ballot, I am sure that many highly
qualified Democrats will seek election to the new city council," he
said. "And, as always, we will conduct a thorough endorsement
process."</TE>

<HD>Ventura Police Defend Fatal Shooting of Teen</HD>
<DH>Crime: The officer 'had no time for talking' after the
19-year-old car theft suspect pulled a knife during a struggle in a
parking lot, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura police said one of their detectives had no choice but to
fatally shoot a teenager suspected of car theft once he pulled a
knife during a fight with the officer in the parking lot of a
downtown motel.</LD>
<LD>   "There was just no time for talking. They were less than 3 feet
away" from each other, Police Sgt. Brock Avery said Friday. "The
officer was close and the threat was immediate."</LD>
<LD>   The suspect, 19-year-old Randy Reeves of Ventura, was dead when
the ambulance reached Ventura County Medical Center Thursday shortly
after the 7 p.m. shooting.</LD>
<TE>   An autopsy Friday revealed that Reeves died from a gunshot wound
to the chest, said Senior Deputy Medical Examiner James Baroni.
Reeves was also shot in his left leg, Baroni said.</TE>
<TE>   The officer who fired his automatic pistol outside Topper Motel &amp;
Liquor Store on Thompson Boulevard was placed on paid leave, a
standard procedure.</TE>
<TE>   The names of the detective and his partner are expected to be
released today, Avery said.</TE>
<TE>   The two uniformed detectives had been investigating Reeves for two
weeks in connection with the theft of a vehicle and possessing stolen
mail and personal checks, Avery said.</TE>
<TE>   The stolen car was recovered before the shooting, and its owner
had identified Reeves as the suspect.</TE>
<TE>   The detectives were tipped off that Reeves had frequented the
motel recently and were waiting to arrest him when he pulled into the
parking lot driving a friend's Ford Bronco, Avery said.</TE>
<TE>   An unidentified female passenger was taken to the police station
for questioning and then released</TE>
<TE>   Avery said the officers approached the SUV from each side and
demanded that Reeves get out. Reeves tried to start the Bronco; then
one officer attempted to open the driver's side door as Reeves pulled
it shut.</TE>
<TE>   The detective forced the door open and the two briefly struggled
in the front seat before Reeves was shot, Avery said, adding that a
knife was found inside the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were still waiting Friday afternoon to get a search
warrant to recover the knife from the vehicle, Avery said.</TE>
<TE>   Court records indicate that Reeves served 10 days in Ventura
County Jail for misdemeanor forgery in December and two days in
February for misdemeanor petty theft.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves, a Ventura High School graduate, recently worked as a
telemarketer after earning an accounting certificate from Santa
Barbara Business College, said his stepfather, Scott Allen of
Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   Reeves, whom Allen said loved soccer and earned a brown belt in
karate, had lived with his grandparents in Ventura until recently.</TE>
<TE>   "After the dust settles and we get over the shock of what
happened, we will be able to evaluate the situation," said Allen, who
lives with Reeves' mother and 3-year-old half brother.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't see why he had to have been shot. If he was in some kind
of trouble and they pulled a gun on Randy, he would have frozen."</TE>
<TE>   This was the first officer-involved shooting by Ventura police
since May 13, 2001, when a SWAT officer shot and killed a robbery
suspect who was carrying an assault rifle.</TE>
<TE>   It also was Ventura County's first fatal shooting involving law
enforcement officers this year. The last one occurred on Oct. 14,
when a Thousand Oaks man who had threatened to kill his wife was shot
to death by county sheriff's deputies as he stood in his doorway
holding a large kitchen knife.</TE>

<HD>South Gate Treasurer Arrested</HD>
<DH>Politics: Albert Robles is held on $500,000 bail for
allegedly threatening rivals in long-running feud.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities descended on the home of South Gate Treasurer Albert
Robles on Friday and arrested the politician for allegedly
threatening other public officials.</LD>
<LD>   Among those Robles allegedly made threats against were Assemblyman
Marco Antonio Firebaugh, state Sen. Martha Escutia and a South Gate
police officer, according to sources close to the investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the threats involved murder, they said.</LD>
<TE>   Robles was arrested without incident outside his townhouse and
taken to the Men's Central Jail in Los Angeles, where he was booked
on criminal threat charges and on suspicion of possessing illegal
weapons. His bail was set at $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest is the latest in a series of cases launched against
Robles or his allies that appear aimed at dismantling what critics
have called a political machine in the city of 96,000.</TE>
<TE>   Both Escutia and Firebaugh have been at odds with Robles, the
city's perceived political boss. They have backed opposing candidates
and asked state officials to intervene in the city's notoriously ugly
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors would not provide details about the nature of the
threats; formal charges won't be filed until Monday. But Dist. Atty.
Steve Cooley said Robles' arrest "symbolizes that public corruption
will no longer be tolerated in this county."</TE>
<TE>   "We mean business.... Democracy and good government cannot succeed
in an atmosphere of intimidation, threats and violence," said Cooley
in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Robles' attorney, Tom Brown, accused Cooley of political meddling,
and said the district attorney was being used as a tool by Robles'
enemies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's politics. For many years Albert has known that he's had some
very powerful political enemies, including Firebaugh and Escutia.
This is their way at getting back at Albert," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest sent shock waves throughout the working-class city in
southeast Los Angeles County, where Robles has long been a
controversial and volatile figure.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Albert is the kind of person who would make threats
on another person's life," said City Atty. Salvador Alva. "He's a
person who chooses his words very carefully."</TE>
<TE>   But critics were not surprised, saying Robles' threats were long a
part of his hardball political style.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good day," said Councilman Hector De La Torre. "It shows
that you can't go around berating people, intimidating people,
bullying people. That's what this guy has been doing for several
years in this city."</TE>
<TE>   Robles, 37, has long been at odds with Firebaugh and Escutia,
Democrats who represent state legislative districts that include
South Gate. But tensions heated up in recent years as Robles emerged
as a political force in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most public feud emerged last year when Escutia and
Robles battled over a plan to build a power plant in South Gate.
Escutia backed the construction of the plant while Robles led a
successful citywide effort to sink the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Robles often used strong language in denouncing Escutia during the
months-long standoff, and in one television interview called her a
"pig at the trough."</TE>
<TE>   The allegation regarding the police officer is believed to stem
from the city's attempts last year to install a new deputy chief. In
retaliation, the police unions helped launch a recall drive against
Robles, saying he was scheming to gain control of the force.</TE>
<TE>   Several union officials have been outspoken critics of Robles, who
has said city police are paid too much for too little service.</TE>
<TE>   His tough talk was in keeping with a brash persona and his
willingness to take on the political establishment.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been the most tactful person in dealing with powerful
politicians that I think are trying to do harm to our community," he
said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   But Robles also said that, despite his history of using strong
language, he has never crossed the line. Strong language, he said,
merely reflects his passion.</TE>
<TE>   "How do I paint a picture with the full palette of colors, so that
as many people as possible can see what the problem is?" said Robles.</TE>
<TE>   "If I just paint the picture in gray with a little black, it's an
empty picture. But if I put my heart, my soul, my reputation, my
career on the line, those are all the different colors that paint a
fuller picture."</TE>
<TE>   Robles' arrest comes three months after authorities raided his
home in a search for illegal weapons, including a silencer. Numerous
weapons were confiscated during the raid, including assault rifles.
Brown, Robles' attorney, said Robles has registered all the weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The charges could provide a knockout punch to the political career
of one of the county's most controversial politicians. His career
peaked in 1998, when he placed second in the Democratic primary for
state treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   But since then, allegations of corruption and self-dealing have
dogged him. His 10-year career has paralleled the city's descent into
political chaos, in which candidates have been viciously attacked in
hit-piece mailers and occasional violence has marred campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Henry Gonzalez, a Robles opponent, was shot in the head
in a 1999 case that has not been solved. Gonzalez suffered minor
injuries and remains one of Robles' harshest critics.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the organizer of the recall drive against Robles saw
his business firebombed. That crime has also never been solved.</TE>
<TE>   Robles has denied being behind the hit-piece mailers and the
attacks, but many in the city suspect his involvement. Robles has
long been known for his hot temper and sometimes disruptive behavior
at council meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Former Vice Mayor Maryann Buckles, in a 1997 memo to city
officials, described his behavior as "frightening."</TE>
<TE>   "His continual threats, tirades, screaming fits, interruptions and
general obnoxious, irrational and improper behavior is creating
havoc," she said in the memo. "His behavior is not only frightening
to me but also harassing."</TE>
<TE>   Robles was sued for sexual harassment by an administrative
assistant in a 1999 case that was settled out of court. During a
deposition, then-City Manager Andy Pasmant said several women in City
Hall had complained of harassment by Robles.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Bill Jones said Robles' arrest would signal
authorities' resolve to crack down on corruption in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "'Today's arrest should serve as a wake-up call for the remaining
city officials in South Gate who have attempted to thwart the voters'
access to the recall process," said Jones.</TE>
<TE>   City officials, however, remained defiant. Mayor Xochilt
Ruvalcaba, a staunch Robles ally, called Robles' arrest part of a
conspiracy to meddle in city politics.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all because Firebaugh and Escutia were not able to
construct the power plant in South Gate," she said. "That's what
she's sore about. She needs to grow up about it. If it didn't happen,
live with it."</TE>

<DH>Election: Transcript of Walnut council candidate, a high
school senior, is mistakenly released.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Brannan says he was just a concerned citizen doing research on a
candidate running for the Walnut City Council, in this case an
18-year-old high school senior.</LD>
<LD>   The student, Robert Lung, says that Brannan, a supporter of two
other candidates, was attempting to thwart Lung's campaign when he
obtained a copy of the student's transcript.</LD>
<LD>   Ken Gunn, the principal of Walnut High School, admits that the
school made a mistake when an employee in the registrar's office gave
Lung's transcript to Brannan without permission, in violation of
state law.</LD>
<TE>   It's all part of politics in Walnut, a city of 30,000 that will
elect two candidates to the City Council on Tuesday from a group of
seven contenders.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 18, a week after the filing deadline for the City Council
race, Brannan, 61, who calls himself a concerned citizen, went to
Walnut High School looking for information about Lung.</TE>
<TE>   Lung had qualified to run in the election a few days earlier,
Brannan said, and he was curious about whether Lung had taken a
civics class. "I wondered what that civics class would consist of,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to school officials, Elizabeth Lopez, a school employee,
printed out a copy of Lung's transcript and gave it to him.</TE>
<TE>   Gunn, who was out of the office at the time of the incident, said
he found out about Lopez's actions after she alerted the vice
principal to what she had done.</TE>
<TE>   Gunn declined to say whether Lopez had been reprimanded, but did
say he "had talked to everyone who has access to confidential
records."</TE>
<TE>   Lung--who said he is classified as a special education student but
was mainstreamed long ago into regular classes--was not told about
the breach until Jan. 26, when he was called out of an English class
to meet with a vice principal and Gunn.</TE>
<TE>   "They apologized and said they messed up," Lung said. Gunn
attributed the delay in informing Lung to a combination of
circumstances, including a three-day weekend, the fact that the
school superintendent was ill, and a need to consult school lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make sure that we did everything from then on very
correctly," Gunn said. "This is going to sound stupid in hindsight,
but there was a question of whether we had to notify him or the
parents."</TE>
<TE>   State law limits access to a student's transcript, and because
Lung is 18 and therefore considered an adult, even his parents cannot
obtain his transcript without his permission.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Valerie Hill, called the delay in notifying her son
inexcusable. She said that when the school, with Lung's permission,
told her what had happened, she insisted upon filing a report with
the local sheriff's station, which polices Walnut.</TE>
<TE>   Brannan turned in the transcript, which was never published, to
the sheriff's station as evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The report was forwarded to the public integrity unit of the Los
Angeles County district attorney's office, which declined to file
charges.</TE>
<TE>   "To allow someone to break the law and violate someone's civil
rights is unacceptable," Hill said. "These people want to break the
law for an 18-year-old kid."</TE>
<TE>   "These people," she said, include Gunn and Brannan, both of whom
are listed in campaign materials as supporters of one of Lung's
opponents, Dan Marostica.</TE>
<TE>   "There are too many connections," she said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rival Candidate Denies Connection to Incident</TE>
<TE>   But when contacted Friday, Marostica denied any connection with
the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "I have absolutely nothing to do with this," he said. "Jim Brannan
is the kind of person who you don't tell what to do; he does what he
does for his own reasons.... There isn't any reason for me to be
involved."</TE>
<TE>   Brannan, a supporter of Marostica and of June Wentworth, another
candidate, said that to make his actions into a political issue, as
Lung has done, is "a bunch of hogwash."</TE>
<TE>   Brannan said he did not become a member of the committee working
for Marostica's election until after the transcript incident.</TE>
<TE>   Lung, whose uncle, Frank Hill, was a state assemblyman, spent his
recent spring break campaigning, walking Walnut neighborhoods door to
door.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is running for City Council partly because he feels
that politics in his city need reform.</TE>
<TE>   "There are problems going on that aren't getting dealt with," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Jumping the Gun on Kindergarten</HD>
<DH>It can be a disaster to send children to school before they
are ready.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PEGGY CONSTANTINE</AU>
<BD> Peggy Constantine teaches kindergarten at Tomas
Rivera Elementary School in Riverside.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today's kindergarten is yesterday's first grade. If your 4- or
5-year-old child is not ready to write sentences and begin reading,
give that child a year to develop before starting school. The Gesell
Institute of Child Development calls this "the gift of time," and
that's exactly what it is. To send children to kindergarten before
they are ready spells disaster in the new educational climate.</LD>
<LD>   When I began teaching in 1979, there was no curriculum guide for
kindergarten. I taught my students how to write their first and last
names, and we learned the numbers 1 to 10, alphabet letters and
sounds. Eventually, I would have a group of five or six who were
ready for reading.</LD>
<LD>   Here is my kindergarten room today: There is a number line made of
adding machine tape that stretches along the ceiling. We write a
number on the number line each day, beginning with "1" on the first
day. There is a huge celebration for "100 Day." It's hoped that my
students will learn to count to 100 with this incentive.</LD>
<TE>   Students learn about place values. They are expected to be able to
write numbers 1 to 30 when they leave kindergarten, as well as to
interpret graphs. Toward the end of the year, we will learn how to
add and subtract.</TE>
<TE>   Then we do the "Daily News," an interactive writing exercise.
Children report their "news," which I write with the help of the
class. We look for words such as "a," "and" and "the," which students
take turns circling. We listen for beginning, middle and ending
sounds of words, and practice spelling.</TE>
<TE>   Most of my students love the Daily News and they are active
participants. But there are those who are simply not developmentally
ready for this. During small-group writing time, they don't
understand for many months what I want them to do. And as they notice
that other children do understand, they begin to think there is
something wrong with them. There isn't. They're just not ready to be
there.</TE>
<TE>   These are the same children who find guided reading groups
difficult. These children try to read, but it is difficult for them
to sound out unknown words because they are still not secure in their
knowledge of alphabet letters and sounds.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard for parents to take a stand and keep their child at home
or in preschool for an extra year. Family and friends question the
wisdom of giving a child an extra year to develop when the
Legislature says it's time for them to go. I once had a student named
James who struggled with everything we did. He had a late birthday,
and he just wasn't ready. His parents decided to give him another
year in kindergarten. But then, James' mother changed her mind and
sent him on to first grade because, she said, "the grandparents
aren't happy." James was the one who paid for this decision. He
became a behavior problem in the middle grades and was eventually
retained in fourth or fifth grade. How much easier it would have been
for James had he "been retained" at home one more year before going
to school.</TE>
<TE>   What many parents don't know is that school standards have been
raised so drastically that even children who are ready for the new
curriculum find it challenging. Chronological readiness is not the
same as developmental readiness. Ask yourself if your child has the
social and emotional maturity and the small motor (hand) development
to succeed in today's accelerated kindergarten program. If not, give
him or her that precious gift of time. Then watch that youngster grow
and learn with joy, rather than stress. It is never a mistake to
wait.</TE>

<HD>Ours Is a Land of Many Languages</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOMENICO MACERI</AU>
<BD> Domenico Maceri teaches foreign languages at Allan
Hancock College in Santa Maria.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the mid-1700s Benjamin Franklin complained about German-English
bilingual street signs in Philadelphia. Not much has changed in the
U.S. about language worries.</LD>
<LD>   These days though, it's mainly Spanish that raises concerns.
Letters to the editors of American newspapers about the importance of
the English language are commonplace. One recent one stated that we
should keep the heritage language alive at home; but when we go to
the bank, shopping or work, we should speak English.</LD>
<LD>   To a large extent the reader was absolutely right. The U.S. is
primarily an English-speaking country. Yet throughout its history, it
has been a multilingual country too. Spanish, Italian, French,
Apache, Cherokee and other languages have all been part of the
linguistic landscape.</LD>
<TE>   According to U.S. English, an organization created to protect the
English language in the United States, 329 foreign languages are
spoken in the U.S. But Spanish is without a doubt the main
"competitor" to English these days.</TE>
<TE>   Major American companies use Spanish to attract customers. AT&amp;T
and other phone companies ask you to choose between English and
Spanish when you use a phone card. ATMs ask the same question.
Commercials in Spanish are ubiquitous.</TE>
<TE>   And just as American companies make the sensible choice to address
potential customers in their languages, educators use Spanish and
other languages to reach immigrant children who don't know English.
The government also uses foreign languages to provide services to
those who have limited English skills.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians have discovered that a language other then English may
provide an entree to voters' hearts and minds.</TE>
<TE>   The most visible example of using Spanish for political gain is
President Bush. In the 2000 campaign, Bush often sprinkled his
speeches with Spanish phrases. Rival Al Gore eventually adopted a
similar tactic.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, some view the existence of languages other than
English as a cancer that needs to be excised. That explains the 27
states that have passed English-only laws. It also explains the
virtual elimination of bilingual education programs in several
states, including California.</TE>
<TE>   These attacks on foreign languages produce very little. Rather
than pass English-only laws, which make immigrants feel unwelcome, we
should look at the linguistic abilities newcomers possess and make
use of them.</TE>

<LD>A PELICAN IN THE WILDERNESS</LD>
<LD>   Hermits, Solitaries and Recluses</LD>
<LD>   By Isabel Colegate</LD>
<TE>   Counterpoint: 284 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "A man that Studies Happiness must sit alone like a Sparrow upon
the Hous[e] Top," wrote Thomas Traherne, a 17th-century English
vicar, "and like a Pelican in the Wilderness."</TE>
<TE>   What men and women seek in the solitary life of a spiritual
hermit, however, is not happiness in the ordinary sense. "[T]he
flight to the desert seems to have been rather a flight of the mind
to God," explains Isabel Colegate in "A Pelican in the Wilderness," a
bright and highly literate study of asceticism in both the East and
West. Nor do the rigors of life in a cave or on a hilltop always
reward the hermit with ecstasy or enlightenment. "Despondency," she
observes, "is the big beast that stalks the solitary."</TE>
<TE>   Colegate, best known as a novelist ("Agatha," "The Shooting Party"
and "Winter Journey," among others), places herself squarely within
the rich literary traditions of English travel writing while, at the
same time, plumbing the spiritual depths of the hermit's life. She
moves deftly through several thousand years of history, always
keeping an eye on the curious role of the recluse. But she concedes
from the start that the idea of the hermit's life is one that few of
us will ever fully understand, much less act on.</TE>
<TE>   "The holy hermit has been there since time immemorial, somewhere
up in the misty Chungsan hills of China, or wrapped in yak-skins in a
cave among the Himalayan snows, or wandering through the crowds by
the Ganges at Benares, or quiet in his hut in the deepest Russian
forests," writes Colegate.</TE>
<TE>   "[T]he idea so beautifully expressed by Bellini or Durer or any
other of the many painters who have depicted St Francis in the
wilderness or St Jerome in his cave ... gives rise to notions of
solitude, closeness to nature, a life of study and contemplation,
which have an immediate appeal even to those who know that the
nostalgia they feel is for a life they would never in reality choose
for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   "A Pelican in the Wilderness" has less to say about the daunting
and often dreary reality of the hermit's life than the way the very
idea of the hermit has impressed itself on the Western imagination,
including her own. Thus, along with famous hermits ranging from the
Desert Fathers to Thomas Merton, she invokes Kipling and Keats,
Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, even J.D. Salinger, who inspires her to muse
on "the modern phenomenon of [the] celebrity hermit."</TE>
<TE>   Colegate sees Salinger not merely as an eccentric recluse but as
an earnest spiritual seeker. The clue is the so-called Jesus Prayer,
a meditative prayer from Orthodox Christianity that figures
importantly in Salinger's "Franny and Zooey" and suggests to Colegate
that Salinger "was trying to find a system of thought which would
make him dislike the world less than he did." She expresses her
solidarity with her fellow novelist by protesting the "indignation
and outrage" that have been heaped on Salinger.</TE>
<TE>   "The reasoning behind this must be the thought that no one would
be a writer or an actor or a musician--or indeed prominent in any
way--unless their chief object was to be famous," writes Colegate,
"and that therefore they should lay themselves down gladly as a
sacrifice on the altar of human curiosity."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Colegate allows that the "celebrity hermit" is nothing
new--St. Simeon, who lived atop a column in the Syrian desert for
some 36 years, apparently succumbed to what Colegate calls "the lure
of fame, perhaps the holy man's most subtle temptation." Indeed, the
5th century anchorite would not have been out of place in an era of
TV evangelism: "He seems to have provided a more or less continuous
show," she writes. "He remained standing from sunrise to sunset,
shouting sermons; he was famous for the number of genuflections he
could do; an observer counted up to 1,244 before giving up. The crowd
would cheer him on."</TE>
<TE>   Colegate insists that modernity has not been kind to hermits.
"[I]n the modern Western world solitude is undervalued," she argues.
"To wish to be alone is thought odd, a sign of failure or neurosis."
Then, too, the hermits who have long sought refuge in various idyllic
places around the world have been ousted by drug-runners, guerrilla
fighters and urban sprawl. And even those who succeed in finding a
place of refuge suffer from "the age-old problem of the hermit who
leaves the world only to find that the world follows him."</TE>
<TE>   Still, "A Pelican in the Wilderness" demonstrates that the primal
impulse to get away from it all is too durable to be wholly
eradicated. After surveying the sites where Celtic mystics sought
solitude during the Middle Ages, Colegate pauses to point out that
one can still see the 7th century structure that once housed a
monastery on an island off the coast of Scotland--"but it now belongs
to Tibetan Buddhists."</TE>

<HD>Secession--a Risk for All</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Think of San Fernando Valley secession as surgery to separate twins
conjoined at the chest--not impossible but not without risk to either
a new Valley city or what would be left of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   State Controller Kathleen Connell used that metaphor Monday after
releasing her audit of the Valley and harbor area secession
proposals. It's the most useful analogy we've heard for what Los
Angeles voters will, in all likelihood, be asked to decide in
November.</LD>
<LD>   According to Connell, the main risk to the proposed Valley city is
that it may lack enough money to function well. California cities
similar in size to the 1.4-million-resident Valley typically set
aside about 4% of their budgets for unexpected expenses and
emergencies. The private consultants who prepared the secession
proposal allowed for just over 1%, tops, and Connell's audit found
miscalculations elsewhere that would wipe out those cash reserves.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, the consultants were "fundamentally mistaken" in
predicting that future reserves would grow steadily, Connell said,
adding, "Any change in the economic climate could render that city
financially without any reserves or without any resources to provide
the level of services that I would imagine the Valley residents would
be expecting."</TE>
<TE>   Secession backers tout a more efficient government that would
offer better services for less money. But the proposal Connell
reviewed doesn't give a new city many opportunities to innovate, at
least for the first few years. It calls for Los Angeles to continue
providing all services through a three-year transition period and
allocates virtually all of the new city's budget to pay for those
services. Cutting services is the only way we can see for a Valley
city to achieve savings.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to the conjoined twins and the risk that
separation poses to Los Angeles. The state requires that for three
years secession not financially hurt what remains of Los Angeles. To
meet that requirement the consultants came up with the three-year
transition: The Valley would continue to pay for all the same
services. But Connell's audit, by exposing the would-be Valley city's
cash reserve problem, shows just how fragile that promise is.</TE>
<TE>   Money is the lifeblood of any city, and during the three-year-long
secession operation these twins would still share a circulation
system. "Any cuts on one side," said Connell, "affect revenues on the
other side."</TE>
<TE>   As for what happens after three years, secession advocates,
reasonably enough, want their city to start providing its own
services or contract with the county. The report the consultants
wrote did not have to address what would happen then, but the
separation's impact on L.A. could be severe, Connell said.</TE>
<TE>   A second audit found that a proposed breakaway city in the harbor
area would not bring in enough revenues to pay for even basic fire
and police protection, a shortcoming that might well kill that
secession effort. But nothing Connell found is likely to keep a
Valley measure off the ballot. Indeed, the operation she describes
could well succeed. But before voters wield the scalpel, they need to
know that this surgery would be extraordinarily complex and that full
recovery could take years, during which new risks would emerge for
the old city and the new. Secession advocates call this
fear-mongering. We call it informed consent.</TE>

<LD>There must have been a judgment-clouding fog in the air Thursday.
Something made a San Bernardino judge and lawyers who should have
known better think they could kiss off the Constitution and keep the
public in the dark about information it has a right to evaluate. The
legal name for what they attempted is "prior restraint," and this
nation's courts have repeatedly ruled that it should be allowed only
in the most extraordinary circumstances, if at all. Neither of these
latest efforts to impose secrecy comes close to meeting that
standard.</LD>
<LD>   These slaps at the 1st Amendment involve this newspaper and other
Southern California news outlets. Late Thursday night, a lawyer for
the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese tried to persuade Los Angeles
Superior Court Judge David Yaffe to prevent the publication of
e-mails in which Cardinal Roger M. Mahony discussed with his attorney
the alleged sexual misconduct of priests. The attorney argued that
the e-mails were protected by attorney-client privilege and had been
obtained illegally and therefore their publication should be stopped.
Just before midnight, the judge refused, saying "that's what I don't
think the Constitution permits me to do."</LD>
<TE>   Another judge that day issued a ruling that was not nearly so
sage. Last week, San Bernardino County Judge Robert Fawke allowed
photographers from The Times and the Press-Enterprise of Riverside to
take courtroom pictures of a police officer charged with 27 counts of
kidnapping, rape and battery. On Thursday, after defense and
prosecution attorneys complained that printing the photos would
interfere with the case, the judge barred publication, citing the
defendant's right to a fair trial.</TE>
<TE>   Bad call. The newspapers are appealing. Court rulings have
established that the 1st Amendment takes precedence over the 6th
Amendment. Cases going back to 1971 and President Richard Nixon's
efforts to prevent the New York Times and the Washington Post from
publishing the Pentagon Papers make it clear that the public's right
to receive information is virtually sacred. The first case may have
been an effort by the archdiocese to cover up a cover-up. The San
Bernardino case is a matter of a judge who got his constitutional
priorities confused. Together they suggest that representatives of
the church and state alike need refresher courses in the meaning of a
"free press" and its significance in a democracy.</TE>

<LD>There ought to be a law against spam, irritating, unsolicited e-mail
pushing porn, offering "miracle cures" and promising riches at the
click of a mouse. Actually, there are lots of state laws. But they
are rarely enforced. That's why Congress should protect consumers by
passing tough legislation that would allow those who abhor spam--and
who doesn't?--to opt out of getting unwanted e-mail.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Rep. Heather Wilson (R-N.M.) has introduced a bill that would
require spammers to honor requests to remove names from their lists.
The legislation got out of committee and was scheduled for a floor
vote shortly after Sept. 11. The attack shifted priorities and that
vote never happened. But it's not too late. Although the bill has not
been scheduled, Congress, led by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.),
chairman of the Commerce Committee, is taking a closer look at
Internet legislation.</LD>
<LD>   Washington should crack down on spammers, especially those that
offer an "unsubscribe" option to e-mail recipients but use the
confirmation of a live address to send even more unwanted e-mail. The
size, expense and difficulty of the problem make this a job for
Washington. Federal prosecutors have plenty of experience with cases
that involve interstate commerce, fraud and computers. The feds could
also prevent spammers from sending e-mail to every state.</LD>
<TE>   As many as one of three e-mail messages comes from a spammer who
gets paid for getting the ad to a live address. The senders hide
behind false return addresses, sneak through loopholes in Internet
service provider systems or quickly change identities after
broadcasting millions of unwanted ads touting everything from
mortgages to child pornography and images of bestiality. Their
messages clog e-mail inboxes, create time-consuming hassles and even
crash systems.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty states, including California, have set reasonable
restrictions, but these laws are rarely enforced, according to a
study by Times staff writer David Colker. The reasons for the lax
enforcement range from lengthy legal challenges to the time and
expense involved in tracking down illegal senders.</TE>
<TE>   In January, a California appeals court panel upheld the state law
that regulates businesses that send unsolicited e-mail ads. That law
requires spammers to clearly indicate that their messages are ads,
include real return addresses and provide ways for recipients to get
off their e-mail lists. The law was passed in 1998, yet spammers
still do business freely.</TE>
<TE>   In the free-wheeling early days of the Internet, spam amounted to
a small annoyance easily handled by hitting the delete key. Not
anymore. As e-mail grows exponentially, spammers get ever more
sophisticated. For the Internet to reach its full potential, e-mail
users need help from lawmakers in blocking the daily avalanche of
spam.</TE>

<LD>In "It's Economics, Stupid: U.S. Could Hold the Key to Mideast Peace"
(April 1), Ronald Brownstein makes the point that U.S. trade with the
Mideast region has fallen in the last 20 years, which raises the
question, "Why should Americans care about Mideast peace?" Why is
this region more important than the unending civil wars in Africa or
Asia, where trade is just as dismal?</LD>
<LD>   Doesn't the U.S. give $3 billion a year to Israel? And for that
investment what do we get, other than rehashed, 20-year-old headline
news of another car bomb exploding and Israeli soldiers shooting
children throwing rocks? What else does the U.S. get for its money,
besides the justified animosity of the Muslim world for supporting
the killing of more Muslims via Israel?</LD>
<LD>   I believe the only reason American politicians become involved in
the endless peace/war process is because they feel guilty for giving
money to support more killings. I would rather the money went to
support Americans than to support Israel's war on terrorism. Let us
cut off the free money to Israel and then see what happens.</LD>

<TE>   As a former advisor on Middle Eastern affairs to the U.S. State
Department, I am afraid that Ariel Sharon may create a large war in
the Middle East. Having seen the television coverage, it is apparent
that he has taken his campaign against Yasser Arafat too far; not
only that, he has done it with weapons we gave him. We will also be a
pariah in the Middle East, no longer a broker for peace; no longer
will we be able to rely on our allies in the region.</TE>
<TE>   It is imperative we rein Sharon in, lest the whole region explode.
If that happens, our Arab friends in the Middle East and in the
Muslim world--and our economy--will be wiped out, because the flow of
oil will have stopped.</TE>

<TE>   "President Bush is under pressure to do something . . . to diffuse

in this never-ending conflict you and I pay through the nose. Thanks
to the Camp David peace accords we fork over $3 billion to Israel and
another $2 billion to Egypt--well over half of our entire foreign aid
budget. Year in, year out. Does this cash buy us, or anyone, peace?
No, only the terrorists' enmity.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to think differently about the Middle East. No more
negotiations, no more arms, no more money. Cut off the tap--cold
turkey. We must immediately disentangle ourselves from this black
hole of religious, familial and tribal warfare. We don't understand

<TE>   Now that the dust is settling in Afghanistan, Dubya is being
looked at to deal with a violently escalating and ever-more-complex

National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski called "strategic
incoherence." His most definitive action in March was to dispatch
Dick Cheney to drum up support for another "war." How long will--or

They only minimally supported the U.S. in our fight against Al Qaeda

eliminate weapons of mass destruction. They do not condemn the
Palestinians as they slaughter dozens of innocent Jewish civilians
and are only concerned with the safekeeping of Arafat and his
Palestinian Authority.</TE>

<TE>   I wonder why the international community, namely the United
Nations, has not made the use of suicide bombings against
international law. It should be outlawed as a weapon of mass terror.
As for the "outrage" of neighboring Arab nations, why is it that they
support the cause of the Palestinians' fighting but not the people
themselves. What have they done for the Palestinians for the past 50
years economically? Do they offer any hope, money, jobs or training?
It's hypocritical and insulting to hear Arab leaders say they support
the cause.</TE>
<TE>   It also seems that Jerusalem is a sticking point for peace.
Neither side wants to relinquish control, so make it an international
city--something like Vatican City. It would have a seat at the U.N.,
and it could have a multi-party system allowing smaller groups seats
in the government based on a percentage of votes received.</TE>

<LD>Arianna Huffington's April 2 commentary, "1 Strike, You're Out on the
Street," should make readers question the justice in not only drug
laws and punishment but all laws upheld (sometimes) in our country.
Like many governing principles in this country, the choice to obey or
not to obey is ambiguous--and often depends on the status of the
person and/or family that is being judged.</LD>
<LD>   Huffington's roll call of politicians' children who may have made
a "mistake" makes a very clear statement that punishment for breaking
the law is based more on who you are than what you did. My kids grew
up with the realization that what they might do in La Mirada could
carry a much heavier penalty than the same action carried out by some
young person living in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   But whoever said it's a level playing field?</LD>

<TE>   La Mirada</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Is Huffington the only person with the courage to criticize the
hypocrisy and the dangerous injustices that grow out of America's
misconceived war on drugs? Why won't our senators and representatives
stand up and say throwing grandmothers out of their apartments for
the alleged drug use of their daughters is an application of
collective guilt that has been repudiated by most civilized
countries? Unfortunately, the reason our representatives have not
spoken out against the war on drugs is that no politician has ever
lost a vote pandering to the rhetoric of the drug war. It is time for
the public to vote against any politician who mouths the platitudes
of the drug war and begin steering our country toward a rational and
humane drug policy.</TE>

<LD>Re "Put Bite Into Reining In Dogs," Voices, March 30: I was outraged
by David Harvey's opening statement: "Before her death, many of
[Diane] Whipple's neighbors had complained about [Robert] Noel and
[Marjorie] Knoller's dogs. Now people wonder why the authorities did
not act sooner. If San Francisco's animal control department is
anything like Los Angeles', I can see how such a tragedy can happen."</LD>
<LD>   Harvey should get his facts straight before casting aspersions on
other agencies. Prior to Whipple's mauling, no complaints about the
dogs were ever received by San Francisco Animal Care and Control or
the San Francisco Police Department. I would like to think that if we
were notified, maybe this tragedy would not have occurred.</LD>
<LD>   I can't speak to the problem Harvey seems to have with his local
animal control department. As an editor for a textbook company,
however, he should know the importance of accuracy.</LD>

<LD>The liberal U.S. media continue to meddle in Yugoslavia's (i.e.,
Serbia and Montenegro's) business. "Pragmatism Wins in Serbia"
(editorial, March 28) is a good example. At a time when the U.S. is
finally conducting a "war on terrorism" in Afghanistan, it seems that
the media are trying to prove to the Muslims of the world that our
war does not have anything to do with Muslims and fundamentalism.</LD>
<LD>   Your focus continues to be upon former Republika Srpska President
Radovan Karadzic, Gen. Ratko Mladic, Slobodan Milosevic and other
internal Serbian happenings. Even Sept. 11 did not help you to
realize that we all, Serbs and other non-Islamic societies, have the
same enemies. They are identified as Muslim fundamentalists. The
sooner you realize that, we'll all be better off. The war on
terrorism may then be setting off in the right direction.</LD>
<LD>   The same terrorists cannot be considered "the good guys" while
killing Serbs and "the bad guys" when killing Americans.</LD>

<HD>Tax on Soda Is a Finger in the Dike</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So now we have the proposal to tax soda because we have a number of
overweight teens. Well, this Californian is tired of paying for
others' lack of responsibility. "New Soda Tax Idea Reignites an Old
Debate" (March 30) states that 30% of California teens are overweight
or at risk of being so. If I read your article correctly, state Sen.
Deborah Ortiz of Sacramento thinks we can remedy this by putting a
tax on soda.</LD>
<LD>   It's time to put the blame on the lack of personal responsibility
of these teens and their parents. I have kids, and when they reach
for a soda, I say no. I've also said things to them like, "Turn off
the TV, we're going to the park." Apparently the parents of the 70%
of California teens who are not overweight are doing something along
those lines. Let's not tax the rest of the people of this state who
are making sure that their kids are getting exercise and eating well.</LD>
<LD>   Just as with the issues of violence on TV and in video games,
legislators and the media should focus on the real problem: Parents
need to get involved. They need to learn to say no and mean it.
Children need to be taught good nutrition and the importance of
exercise and have it enforced in the home.</LD>
<TE>   This is not like fixing holes in our roads or building schools, in
which the state must find ways to generate revenues for such
projects. Overweight teens are an easily preventable problem. Taxing
the rest of us is a lazy solution to a problem born out of laziness.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Iacofano</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A tax on soda to fight childhood obesity? Are we ready to tax
Nintendo games next? How about considering putting back physical
education in schools? How about funding after-school physical
activity programs?</TE>
<TE>   As a registered dietitian, I have read the statistics on the
growing problem of childhood obesity for a long time. According to
the National Institutes of Health, one in five children is
overweight, and children have been getting fatter, according to
almost every survey that is published. But anyone can look around and
see that. Food is not the sole culprit. The issue is much larger than
that:</TE>
<TE>   1. A decrease in physical activity.</TE>
<TE>   2. More meals that consist of fatty fast food.</TE>
<TE>   3. Children and teenagers don't care about making healthy food
choices; they just want food that tastes good.</TE>
<TE>   4. Parents don't have time to care about what their kids eat or
their activity level.</TE>
<TE>   5. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
the prevalence of adult obesity grew 61% between 1991 and 2000. (Who
are the role models for these children?)</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has worked seriously in weight management knows that in
order to lose weight you have to be in the proper mind-set to do so.
Losing weight and maintaining a healthy weight are vastly different
concepts. Taxing soda and candy bars is tantamount to putting a
finger in the dike. The solution to this problem demands a more
comprehensive approach.</TE>
<TE>   I agree that childhood obesity is a problem that needs attention.
A depressing fact for those of us involved in diabetes care is that
Type 2 diabetes in children is growing rapidly. Twenty years ago no
one thought of children having this chronic illness. With diabetes
comes cardiac problems, neurological problems and a host of costly
treatments. Senators, I plead with you to look at the real problems
here, talk with experts and your constituents and look for a better
way to address this problem.</TE>

<HD>Guards' Clout With Gov. Davis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I never thought I would become a single-issue voter. However, Gov.
Gray Davis' granting an indefensible pay increase to correctional
officers after their union gave him the largest single check he has
received since taking office pushes me to the edge. I am a retired
employee of the Department of Corrections with over 30 years of
service, so I should be glad for my former brothers. But this is too
much. As a taxpayer I object to giving such a gigantic increase to a
single group of employees when the rest of the state departments are
being asked to take cuts. I am angered at the denial by the governor
that there is any connection between the pay raise and the political
contribution. Of course there is a connection. The only question is
how much of a connection.</LD>
<LD>   Don't try to clean this one up, governor. It can only get worse
for you. I can imagine how you and your staff must have laughed when
the Republicans elected Bill Simon to run against you. Now I bet they
are laughing about the big hammer you just gave them to use against
you. My innocence about politics was lost a long time ago, but this
one is so blatant that I may have sit on my hands this election.</LD>
<LD>   Howard McGarry</LD>
<TE>   Upland</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It might be true, as you suggested in your April 1 editorial, that
Davis is motivated by political payback in giving raises to our
state's prison guards. But whatever the reason, the guards should be
well paid for their work. I cannot imagine a more stressful or more
necessary job than keeping order in prison. The prison guards deserve
every penny they receive.</TE>
<TE>   Michael David Smith</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Times was correct when it wrote "follow the political clout
and the campaign money" of the prison guards union and you'll see the
reasoning behind the governor's actions. This maxim also applies to
the governor's plan to build a $335-million (plus interest),
unneeded, unwanted prison in Delano.</TE>
<TE>   A statewide coalition has been fighting plans to build this prison
since 1999 when Davis made the Delano prison his first of a series of
"thank you" presents to the guards for their 1998 endorsement and
$2.3 million in contributions. The governor has boasted, "There is
not a major supporter of mine who has not had at least one or two of
their measures vetoed." The Delano prison gives him another
opportunity to apply his axiom.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "It's Right on the Tip of Their Tongues," April 3: After all the
shadowy power plays over even the most rudimentary Valley secession
issues, it's no wonder that Valley VOTE has moved on to the
more-evocative "name game." Market a name that catches the voters'
fancy and presumably adoption from negligent foster mother Los
Angeles is in the ballot box.</LD>
<LD>   Too bad they forgot that the Valley isn't an adorable baby born
from a developer's bulldozer but a decidedly middle-aged woman who
thinks the best day of her life was being voted prom queen. Instead
of a municipal education, she chose subdivision augmentation and
another layer of stucco--and now wants to be called something
precious, like "Camelot." Honey, the world has enjoyed your many
delusions, but you're scaring us now. It's time to dump those spin
doctors at Valley VOTE and get your meds adjusted.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If the San Fernando Valley should secede, I feel it would be
appropriate to retain the name "San Fernando Valley." If people wish
to shorten it, they could refer to it as "the Valley" or even "SFV,"
just as Los Angeles is referred to as "L.A." As far as using the name
on the mail, the present method could be continued. Mail now is
addressed to Encino, Sherman Oaks, Canoga Park, Woodland Hills, Van
Nuys, etc., along with the proper ZIP Code numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Richard W. Weinberg</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The San Fernando Valley secession movement is gaining momentum,
but the secessionists can't even agree on a name for their new city.
That doesn't bode well at all for their ability to run a municipality
of well over a million souls. Proposed names have even included such
absurd juxtapositions as Los Fernando and San Angeles, neither of
which makes any sense at all in Spanish. To assist in selecting an
appropriate name, I have independently conducted an extensive
nationwide survey of city-naming experts. The following are among the
most frequently mentioned suggestions:</TE>
<TE>   The Over the Hill Gang</TE>
<TE>   Valley of the Dulls</TE>
<TE>   South Bakersfield</TE>
<TE>   North Carjacking</TE>
<TE>   Dudesville</TE>
<TE>   West Oklahoma</TE>
<TE>   La-La Land, la, la--where am I?</TE>
<TE>   Holmby Hills Adjacent</TE>
<TE>   The managers of the secessionist movement obviously need to devote
more time to their campaign, so the above is offered as an attempt to
free them from the demands of selecting a name for their new domain.
In return I would expect nothing less than a grant of honorary
citizenship when they secede from the United States.</TE>

<LD>"Viet Lesson: Make Trade, Not War," by Pete Peterson (Commentary,
March 31) opens with some rousing rhetoric about free nations
requiring individual rights, democratic principles and a "robust free
market economy." It doesn't take long to realize, however, that the
third member of this holy trinity is the only one that Peterson cares
to speak further on.</LD>
<LD>   Nor was I surprised to find that the focus of the article soon
degenerated from saving the people of Vietnam and Afghanistan to
saving American business. But, of course, complete integration into
the global market just happens to help out everyone in those
countries too.</LD>
<LD>   Peterson proves this logic beyond any doubt when he explains why
Vietnam's economy is so safe and promising now: "Because Vietnam was
not completely integrated into the global market, it did not greatly
suffer the effects of the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s."
Perhaps, just perhaps, this contradiction suggests that unflinching,
unreflective free trade is not always the best policy for all
concerned.</LD>

<LD>California's ridiculous speed limit and lane restriction for trucks
also apply to cars pulling trailers ("Big Rig Drivers Chafe at Life
in the Slow Lane," March 26). This greatly inconveniences those of us
who tow recreational vehicles on the way to the desert or other
recreational sites.</LD>
<LD>   Modern cars and motor homes can easily and safely cruise at 60 to
70 mph, even when towing. Being forced into the right lanes means we
have to tangle with on/off-ramp traffic and truly slow vehicles. This
is more dangerous than being allowed to keep up with traffic and
avoiding the right lane.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding your April 3 story on Latino job seekers, am I really
supposed to feel for Angel Casas in his plight? Let's see, 18 years
old, unmarried but with a kid, living off his parents, and yet he has
a $700 monthly truck payment? Is this the best example of the Latino
population The Times could find?</LD>
<LD>   This story has little to do with being Latino and more to do with
being irresponsible. I would expect anyone to be having trouble in
life with the decisions he has made.</LD>
<LD>   This story also illustrates the problem of expecting minimum-wage
jobs to support entire families. Now it's hard for young people--the
ones whom minimum-wage jobs are made for--to get these jobs, because
40-year-olds are raising their kids on them.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe next time you could do a story on the many success stories
out there of people who did things the right way, and did so without
excuses.</TE>
<TE>   Erik Rose</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As the saying goes: "What goes around, comes around." Casas is
being displaced from the job market by illegal aliens who keep on
pouring over our border and grabbing the jobs at cheaper wages. When
they arrived years ago, his parents took jobs from high school
graduates like their son. This will go on until young Americans of
Mexican descent realize that illegal immigrants take jobs away from
them as well.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe then something will finally be done about illegal
immigration.</TE>
<TE>   Haydee Pavia</TE>
<TE>   West Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I read with some trepidation about the problem of inexperienced or
unskilled second-generation Latinos, as I had a similar experience in
my youth.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, I feel, lies in a Latin American culture that
relinquishes all responsibility to the state for the parental
supervision of the education of their children. The state also bears
responsibility by placing concern, for the most part, on black and
Latino feelings and self-esteem above basic, hard academic work.</TE>
<TE>   How is it possible that an immigrant from a poor Latin American
country could be better at adding and subtracting than the supposedly
better-educated and advantaged American youth? If Los Angeles is
truly a bellwether for the rest of the nation, then this problem must
surely be of national security importance.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Airlines Fight for Space at Long Beach Airport," April 2: As an
air traffic controller at Long Beach Airport, I was stunned to
discover your reporters twice describing the airport as "tiny." In
2001, Long Beach Airport was ranked 30th in the country in total air
traffic with more than 737,000 operations, which turns out to be more
traffic than some of the other "tiny" airports, such as Honolulu
International and JFK. Tiny Long Beach has five runways, one a
10,000-foot runway (longer than any runway at Orange County, Burbank
or Van Nuys) that handles the heavy cargo jets of the UPS, FedEx and
Airborne Express facilities based here.</LD>
<LD>   Tiny Long Beach is a major aircraft manufacturing facility, the
home of every Air Force C-17 ever built. The former McDonnell Douglas
factory, now owned by Boeing, is still building the C-17 and is still
delivering the new B-717 passenger jet. The Boeing facility is the
largest employer in the city of Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The tiny airport houses major West Coast maintenance facilities
for Gulfstream and Cessna Citation business jets. Tiny Long Beach is
a favorite destination for dozens of private jets that load and
offload big league sports teams and movie stars at two, huge
fixed-base operators.</LD>
<TE>   Tiny Long Beach Airport is home to over 500 general aviation
aircraft and the dozens of businesses that support and maintain them.
Tiny it ain't.</TE>

<HD>INS Backpedals on Closing Bike Lane at Border</HD>
<DH>Crossing: Officials accede to public outcry, find another,
safer way to speed hundreds of northbound cyclists through the San
Ysidro checkpoint.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>After a public outcry, officials of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service on Friday reversed a decision to close a
bicycle lane used by Tijuana residents to avoid lengthy delays at the
San Ysidro border crossing.</LD>
<LD>   Starting at 6 a.m. Monday, a "bikes only" lane will be created in
the pedestrian inspection area, replacing a bicycle lane adjacent to
the vehicle lanes that officials believe is unsafe.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this week, the INS and U.S. Customs Service had announced
the imminent closure of the bicycle lane, which has become enormously
popular for border-crossers eager to avoid the hours-long waits
caused by a crackdown in security after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks in the East. No mention was made of a bike lane in the
pedestrian area.</LD>
<TE>   But on Friday, just hours after Rep. Bob Filner (D-San Diego), who
represents the border area, held a news conference blasting the bike
lane closure, INS district director Adele Fasano issued a statement
about a new lane in the pedestrian section.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe this approach continues to give bikers a convenient
and expedient way to enter the United States without putting their
lives in harm's way," Fasano said.</TE>
<TE>   Fasano also announced that the INS will meet next week with
officials from customs and the California Department of
Transportation to discuss possible long-term solutions, including a
permanent bicycle lane--a suggestion made by Filner and others a day
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "This is fantastic," said San Diego City Councilman Ralph Inzunza,
who represents San Ysidro. "Every now and then, you can turn around a
bad decision. Clearly, they heard the voices of the community."</TE>
<TE>   INS officials said the lane in the pedestrian section had always
been part of the plan. However, it had not been mentioned before
Friday, and signs posted in Spanish and English at the border
mentioned only the closure of the lane adjacent to the vehicle lanes.</TE>
<TE>   By using the special lane next to the 24 lanes open to cars,
trucks and other motor vehicles, bicyclists had been able to cross
the border in minutes. Crossing in a motor vehicle often takes two
hours and sometimes longer.</TE>
<TE>   If bicyclists, as originally suggested, had been required to stand
in line with pedestrians, they could have faced waits of up to
several hours. A bicycle lane in the pedestrian area, while not as
fast as the special lane they once enjoyed, will still represent a
relatively speedy way to cross the border.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, the number of bicyclists rose dramatically as
Tijuana residents looked for ways to reduce the wait needed to get to
jobs, stores and other destinations north of the border.</TE>
<TE>   On some days, the number of bicyclists approached 2,000, up from a
daily average of 100 before Sept. 11. As the vehicle and pedestrian
crossing waits gradually eased, the number of bicyclists declined to
between 800 and 1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said that the sight of bicyclists weaving in and out of
vehicle lanes prompted them to decide to close the lane before
someone was hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The busiest border crossing in the world, the San Ysidro port of
entry averages 42,000 vehicles and 32,000 pedestrians a day. Although
most of the concern has been for bicycle riders from Tijuana, some
San Diego County residents also use bikes to cross into Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "Without bicycles, we'd be in deep trouble," said Chris Nelson, a
Spring Valley teacher who went to Tijuana on Friday on a rented
bicycle to meet friends. "We understand the need for security, but we
also need to continue relations between the two countries."</TE>

<HD>Talks to End Bus Drivers' Strike Fail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Negotiations broke down Friday between striking school bus drivers
and the Los Angeles Unified School District's biggest transportation
contractor. As a result, schedule disruptions affecting 20,000
students are expected to continue into a second week.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, Teamsters Local 572 and the bus company, Laidlaw
Education Services, said they had made progress in their federally
mediated talks. But after two hours of negotiations on a union
counterproposal Friday afternoon, Laidlaw representatives walked out
of the meeting in Glendale.</LD>
<LD>   "Talks have broken off, and we have no new scheduled date that
we'll be going back to the negotiating table ... ," said Laidlaw Vice
President Jim Ferraro.</LD>
<TE>   Teamster officials declined to comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The 700 drivers employed by Laidlaw walked out on Tuesday,
launching the first such strike in the district in more than three
decades.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified Supt. Roy Romer said that he was disappointed by the
breakdown in the talks. "They need to settle this strike, and I urge
both sides to reconvene as soon as possible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Romer has said, however, that the district will provide
alternative bus service indefinitely by using district-employed
supervisors as drivers and doubling routes served by other bus
contractors during the strike. Still, schoolchildren on the Laidlaw
routes--fewer than a quarter of all students bused within the
district--had to wait an hour on average each way this week and
missed early classes. The district canceled most athletic events and
field trips.</TE>
<TE>   The striking Laidlaw drivers, who earn between $8.25 and $14.25 an
hour, are seeking a 15% raise over three years and improved benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Laidlaw executives say the Teamsters' demands are unrealistic
within the financial bounds of the bus company's contract with L.A.
Unified.</TE>
<TE>   The union's leaders say part of their strategy is to get the
district to increase its payments to Laidlaw, an option that the
financially strapped school district says is unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   The Teamsters will probably enter their second week on strike
without any fund to assist their drivers' families or any other labor
organizations joining their protest. Local 572 leaders failed to
persuade 250 of the union's own members who drive for a different
district bus contractor, Atlantic Express, to join the picket line.</TE>

<HD>Tortoise Can Endure Project, Agency Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moving the controversial project a step closer to approval, the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service has concluded that a water storage and
retrieval project in the Mojave Desert would not imperil the desert
tortoise, a federally protected species.</LD>
<LD>   After reviewing plans by the Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California and the Santa Monica based-Cadiz Land Co., the
Fish and Wildlife Service said the estimated $1-billion, 50-year
project "is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence" of the
tortoise or its habitat.</LD>
<LD>   The opinion does not mean tortoises wouldn't be harmed, but that
the project would not drive the reptiles--classified as threatened
under the Endangered Species Act--out of existence.</LD>
<TE>   Among other things, the water district has pledged to ban
tortoise-eating dogs from the project, keep tortoise-eating birds
such as ravens from congregating, and order workers to drive
cautiously and watch for the slow-moving herbivorous reptiles.</TE>
<TE>   If a tortoise is run over or otherwise harmed, the water district
has agreed to notify federal and state agencies so that an immediate
investigation can be launched.</TE>
<TE>   Cadiz Vice President Marv Shaw said the decision confirms the
company's view that the project is "environmentally sensitive."</TE>
<TE>   But Jane Kelly, director of the California office of Public
Citizen, a group founded by Ralph Nader, called the review
"inadequate."</TE>
<TE>   Among other concerns, Kelly said that the number of ravens that
will be attracted to the holding ponds has been greatly
underestimated.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to draw more than they can shoo away," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The MWD would store water from the Colorado River in an aquifer
beneath land in eastern San Bernardino County controlled by Cadiz, an
agriculture and water development company whose chief executive and
board chairman is Keith Brackpool, a water advisor to Gov. Gray
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   In dry years, water from the aquifer would be used in the six
counties that depend on the MWD. Although the district has two
similar aquifer projects in the California desert, the Cadiz project
has become controversial in large measure because it represents an
unparalleled opportunity for a private firm to profit by storing and
selling water.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups oppose the project on numerous grounds, and
have alleged that pumping water from the aquifer will harm the
fragile desert ecology and that the MWD and Cadiz have overestimated
the amount of water in the aquifer.</TE>
<TE>   The Fish and Wildlife Service ruling is the forerunner to a more
significant ruling by the Department of the Interior, which is
expected within a month. The department is evaluating a series of
land-use and environmental questions.</TE>
<TE>   If the Interior Department finds the project a suitable use for
the property, much of which is owned by the federal government and
leased to Cadiz, the project will then be considered by the MWD
governing board.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the board voted tentatively to approve the project but
withheld final approval until a further review of environmental and
financial terms was undertaken.</TE>

<HD>Girl, 4, Taken in Carjacking Is Found</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 4-year-old girl was reunited with her parents late Friday, seven
hours after she was taken by two men who carjacked her mother's sport
utility vehicle outside a Northridge store.</LD>
<LD>   Komal Surani was found safe shortly before 11 p.m., still strapped
in her car seat in an industrial section of North Hollywood, by a Los
Angeles police car theft unit. She had been missing since 3:45 p.m.
when two men assaulted her mother with a screwdriver in the parking
lot of Costco at 8810 Tampa Ave. in Northridge and drove off in with
the little girl still in the back seat of her mother's 1999 Lexus LX
470.</LD>
<LD>   The suspects were still at large late Friday.</LD>
<TE>   At least 60 volunteers and Los Angeles Police Department personnel
had searched a 4-square-mile area of the San Fernando Valley by
helicopter, car and on foot, for the 3-foot, 34-pound girl,
broadening their search as the night wore on.</TE>
<TE>   The searchers were aided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
and the California Highway Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Breeze of Reseda had just entered the Costco when she
heard the mother's screams over the crackle of a security guard's
walkie-talkie.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard a bloodcurdling scream, then the store alarm went off,"
she said. "People said someone stole something. But I knew it was
something else when I heard that scream."</TE>
<TE>   The man who took the Lexus is described as 5-foot-8, 20 to 30
years old with a light mustache. He was wearing a yellow baseball
cap, a white sweatshirt and dark pants.</TE>
<TE>   Another man, who police believe is an accomplice, picked up the
woman's purse after the attack and was last seen driving out of the
Costco parking lot in a white SUV following the Lexus.</TE>
<TE>   The mother was walking beside her car when the first man came up
behind her and attacked her with a screwdriver, Los Angeles police
Cmdr. Michel Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   "The mother had just placed the daughter in the car and was moving
around to get into the car when the attack ensued," Moore said. "The
suspect was able to get control of the car and drove away with the
4-year-old inside."</TE>
<TE>   Police said they had hoped that the thieves would abandon the
vehicle once they realized that they had the child or that they would
take her to a safe place such as a hospital and drop her off.</TE>

<HD>Mother Gets Death in Slayings of 3 Sons</HD>
<DH>Sentencing: Ventura County judge upholds jury's
recommendation in the case of Socorro Caro, who shot the young boys
as they lay in their beds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura County judge sentenced child-killer Socorro Caro to death
Friday, upholding the recommendation made by the jurors who convicted
her of first-degree murder last year.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Donald D. Coleman said the 45-year-old
woman's execution is warranted by her "mass murder of innocent
children."</LD>
<LD>   Caro dabbed at her eyes with a tissue as the judge handed down the
sentence.</LD>
<TE>   Caro was convicted of shooting three of her four young sons as
they lay in bed in the family's posh Santa Rosa Valley home. During
her four-month trial, her children's teachers and family friends
testified that Caro was a loving mother. But that reputation did not
diminish the brutality of her crime, Coleman ruled.</TE>
<TE>   Under California law, judges must review cases in which juries opt
for the death penalty, independently deciding whether that
recommendation is better justified than life without parole. Jury
decisions have been changed in only a handful of cases, and in at
least one the death sentence was reinstated by a higher court.</TE>
<TE>   In the Caro case the aggravating circumstances were overwhelming,
Coleman told a packed courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   He offered a quick outline of the Nov. 22, 1999, slayings: Drunk
and convinced her physician husband, Xavier Caro, was leaving her,
Caro placed her .38-caliber revolver against the temple of her
sleeping 11-year-old, Joey, and pulled the trigger. She then went
into the bedroom shared by 8-year-old Michael and 5-year-old
Christopher. Michael died instantly after a bullet pierced his brain.
Christopher received two rounds, apparently sitting up and facing his
mother after the first shot.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman echoed a point made repeatedly by prosecutors during the
trial: Before attempting to kill herself, Caro turned Joey's body
over so his face would be seen immediately by his father.</TE>
<TE>   She used her children as "symbolic, sacrificial pawns in a failed
marital relationship," Coleman said.</TE>
<TE>   A defense psychiatrist had theorized that Caro's main intent was
suicide but felt that the children would be better off dead than
without her.</TE>
<TE>   That portrayal, however, didn't sway the judge. "It shows her lack
of acknowledgment of the independent rights of her children to have
their lives," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As she was being led away for a lunch break, Caro paused before
her husband, who was sitting in a front row. "How could you do this
to us?" she yelled. "How could you? Look at him, he's smirking...."</TE>
<TE>   Xavier Caro did not respond.</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, however, he had a spokesman distribute a
written statement.</TE>
<TE>   "There can be no joy in this decision, only some measure of
resolution," he wrote. "My heart goes out to members of the jury. As
a physician and as a Catholic, I understand the issues they had to
balance in their decision-making and will always be grateful to them
for their service."</TE>
<TE>   Xavier Caro said his surviving son, Gabriel, "is my reason for
being and has kept me focused on a better future." He was 13 months
old when his brothers were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Half a dozen jurors were among the observers in the courtroom
Friday. They declined comment, as did members of Caro's family.</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, prosecutor Cheryl Temple said Coleman made the
right decision, calling Caro "selfish and vindictive."</TE>
<TE>   Irene Zavala, a volunteer jail chaplain, disagreed and said Caro
had been railroaded. "A great injustice has been done here," said
Zavala, who showed up to support Caro throughout the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Coleman denied a request for a new trial from Caro's lead
attorney, Assistant Public Defender Jean Farley, who based her motion
largely on an affidavit from C. Anthony Anderson, a juror tossed off
the panel for discussing the case outside the jury room with another
juror.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman ruled that Anderson's complaints were not substantial
enough to prove Caro did not get a fair trial.</TE>

<HD>Pastoral Tax Break Faces Legal Test</HD>
<DH>In an Orange County case, an appeals court will decide the
constitutionality of a housing allowance widely used by churches to
help their clergy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ed Salas works in the house of God. But when the Santa Ana pastor
goes home at night, the roof over his head is made possible, at least
in part, because of a generous tax shelter courtesy of Uncle Sam.</LD>
<LD>   About two-thirds of the $35,000 Salas draws from evangelical
Tapestry Covenant Church comes as a housing allowance--a form of
compensation that hasn't been subject to federal income tax since
Congress approved it in 1954.</LD>
<LD>   "I probably couldn't be a pastor here without it," said Salas, a
father of three whose 120 congregants worship each Sunday in a rented
middle school. He also works a second job as a salesman. "The church
isn't large enough to give me a salary increase.... Right now, we
scramble to make ends meet."</LD>
<TE>   A little-noticed case now before the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals could make that scramble more difficult for ministers and
churches nationwide. It challenges the way churches like Tapestry
Covenant rely on an obscure provision in the federal tax code to
stretch tight budgets.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is whether the Internal Revenue Service's "parsonage
allowance," which creates an estimated $400-million-a-year tax break
for churches, is constitutional. Opponents contend that the provision
violates the 1st Amendment's "establishment clause," which deals with
the separation of church from state.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts and church officials said the case could redefine
the often uneasy relationship between government and religion, as
well as profoundly change the way churches do business. Briefs in the
case are due to be filed later this month.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 850,000 clergy in the United States--everything from
rabbis to pastors to priests--who are qualified for this housing
allowance," said Frank Sommerville, a Dallas accountant and tax
lawyer who represents churches and was asked by the appeals court to
file a brief in the case. "It's an issue about where religion and
society" should intersect.</TE>
<TE>   The case has its roots in a routine IRS audit of one of the
nation's wealthier religious figures: the Rev. Richard Warren, senior
pastor of Saddleback Church, a mega-church in the Orange County
community of Lake Forest. In 1996, auditors said Warren's housing
allowance for the previous three years exceeded the IRS-calculated
rental value of the Trabuco Canyon home he and his wife bought for
$360,000. In 1995, Warren claimed $79,999 as a housing allowance--80%
of his compensation from Saddleback. Auditors said the exclusion was
$20,000 more than he was entitled to.</TE>
<TE>   Warren was in a position to spend that much on housing because his
side business is so lucrative. In 1995, according to court records,
Warren earned $221,401 from the sale of his religious audiotapes and
books.</TE>
<TE>   Warren appealed his case to a federal tax court and, by a vote of
14 to 3, the judges ruled that although IRS rules cap the amount a
minister can claim as a housing allowance, the law doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   The government appealed the case to the San Francisco-based 9th
Circuit--and there Warren's case took on an entirely different cast.</TE>
<TE>   In November, one of the appeals court judges, Stephen Reinhardt,
stunned both parties in the case by asking that the constitutionality
of the parsonage allowance be examined.</TE>
<TE>   "It's morphed into a whole different critter," said Saddleback
Pastor Forrest Reinhardt, a colleague of Warren's and no relation to
the judge.</TE>
<TE>   The 1st Amendment's establishment clause has been tested in a
dizzying array of legal issues--from tax cases to the Americans With
Disabilities Act to local zoning debates. The U.S. Supreme Court is
now weighing how the establishment clause applies to a Cleveland
program that uses public money to allow students to attend private
religious schools.</TE>
<TE>   To Erwin Chemerinsky, a USC law professor appointed by the 9th
Circuit to write a brief on the Warren case, the issue is clear:
Because the parsonage allowance is available only to ministers, it is
an indirect subsidy of religion and therefore unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   "Government can't subsidize religion," he said. "Religion is
treated differently by the Constitution. If the government wants to
subsidize journalists because it feels they aren't paid enough, I
don't have any problem with that. But if they want to do the same
thing with regards to religion, they can't."</TE>
<TE>   John Eastman, Warren's attorney, said he will argue that the
parsonage allowance is not a subsidy, but rather an "accommodation of
religion" not unlike the tax-free status of church property,</TE>
<TE>   "Exempting somebody from a tax simply allows them to keep more of
their money," Eastman said. "It's the difference between a direct
payment by the government and the government not taking money away
from a church.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what this fight is all about: How much of an accommodation
of religion can we make before we violate the establishment clause?"</TE>
<TE>   Warren declined to be interviewed. But in an e-mail, he said his
legal fees so far are more than twice what the IRS offered to settle
for. "We were fighting for a principle," Warren wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, as news of his case has spread via e-mail and
word of mouth through religious communities nationwide, concern has
grown--especially at smaller churches with lean budgets.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing all we can to pay our rent and have a couple of
pastors on the payroll," said Bill Faris, pastor of the 100-member
Crown Valley Christian Fellowship in south Orange County. "We can't
afford offices. We work out of our homes, and our Sunday meetings are
at the school we rent. We operate the rest of our ministries on
leftovers."</TE>
<TE>   Faris and a second pastor take $2,400 a month each as a housing
allowance--a majority of their compensation. Without the tax benefit,
Faris said, "we would have to let something go."</TE>
<TE>   "Either my assistant and I would have to take [a pay cut] and go
back and find another job, or we would have to lose one of us," he
said. "Either way, it would impact the level of our pastoral care a
lot."</TE>
<TE>   The International Church of the Foursquare Gospel oversees 1,834
affiliated churches nationwide from its Los Angeles headquarters. A
majority of its 5,844 ministers receive a housing allowance, said the
Rev. Ron Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of our churches survive on a thin financial margin and may
be forced to close" if the tax benefit is deemed unconstitutional,
Williams said. "Some of our ministers would have to leave the
ministry and find other employment. The work that we do feeding the
hungry, sheltering the homeless and evangelizing" would be curtailed.</TE>
<TE>   To Chemerinsky, such grim predictions are further evidence that
the wall between church and state is being breached by the parsonage
allowance.</TE>
<TE>   "The more someone says that getting rid of this will affect them,"
he said, "the more proof there is that the government is subsidizing
them."</TE>

<HD>'81 Murder Is Solved, LAPD Says</HD>

<LD>The Los Angeles Police Department's new Cold Case Homicide Unit has
solved a 20-year-old murder, Police Chief Bernard C. Parks announced
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The killing is the first one solved by the unit since it was
established in November.</LD>
<LD>   Parks said Friday that a man who recently died in an Arizona jail
killed 52-year-old Leo Betancourt, the owner of an auto body repair
shop then at Sunset Boulevard and Vendome Street.</LD>
<TE>   Dets. Rick Jackson and Phil Vannatter identified the suspect as
Alfredo Agrelo, 55, who died of natural causes. Agrelo was awaiting
trial on several charges, including burglary and selling stolen guns.
He also was waiting for extradition to New Jersey in a robbery case,
Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said the Betancourt case is one of hundreds that the
nine-person unit is examining. He said homicides in which DNA and
fingerprints are the key evidence are the most promising cases.</TE>
<TE>   Such technology played no role in the Betancourt case. The killing
occurred Oct. 13, 1981, during a holdup by two men who pretended to
be interested in buying a car from the victim, police said. When
Betancourt took them on a test drive, they drove into an alley where
one of them pulled a gun and shot him. Detectives said Agrelo fled on
foot and his accomplice, who was never caught, escaped in
Betancourt's vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The lead to Agrelo came from an inmate Jackson had arrested on
suspicion of several murders in the early 1980s. Jackson said he
decided to interview the prisoner because he suspected the inmate
would know about some of the murders from those years. The prisoner
knew the suspect as Alfredo Rodriguez, Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Vannatter and Jackson found a booking photograph of Agrelo that
strongly resembled a composite drawing that was compiled from
witnesses who saw the assailants flee the alley, Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Betancourt's widow told the detectives that the photo resembled
one of two men who had been looking for her husband the day before he
was killed. An original witness also identified the photo of Agrelo.</TE>

<HD>Burglary Ring Hit Unlocked Cars in Laguna Beach</HD>
<DH>Crime: Residents in 'safe' areas left vehicles unsecured,
and thieves targeted them. Officers had to rent a storage unit to
hold all the recovered loot.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Residents in affluent coastal enclaves around Laguna Beach thought
their neighborhoods were so safe they didn't need to lock their car
doors or set their alarms.</LD>
<LD>   This proved a perfect opening, police said Friday, for a crime
ring allegedly responsible for dozens of burglaries over the last few
months.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities are still trying to determine how many burglaries can
be linked to the ring. So far, officials said, hundreds of thousands
of dollars in property has been recovered from burglaries in as many
as 11 communities.</LD>
<TE>   Police said a group of young people roamed the coastal streets,
checking for unlocked cars. Some of the burglaries occurred in a
gated community.</TE>
<TE>   "There was definitely a pattern here," said Laguna Beach Det. Paul
Litchenberg. "They had a definite style of going after only unlocked
cars."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Persistent Problem in the Region</TE>
<TE>   Unlocked cars have been a persistent problem in recent years in
affluent south Orange County cities.</TE>
<TE>   A study two years ago in Newport Beach found that 20% to 25% of
car-related theft involved unlocked vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach police arrested five people between Feb. 19 and April
2 in connection with dozens of burglaries.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, garage-door openers in the cars were used to gain
access to homes, police said. Two of the suspects allegedly spent the
night of Feb. 24 in a stolen vehicle parked on a residential street
scouting targets, said Laguna Beach Det. Chris Heuberger.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Sprague and Andrea Hilliard allegedly broke into 15 cars in
the Arch Beach Heights neighborhood that night and stole about
$35,000 in property, plus a 1998 BMW, Heuberger said.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives later recovered more stolen cars, auto parts, cellular
phones and other items. allegedly held by two other suspects. Also
arrested in connection with the string of burglaries are Eric Mack
and Christopher Crawford. Their hometowns were not given. Police have
not released the name of a fifth arrestee.</TE>
<TE>   There was so much stolen property that the Laguna Beach Police
Department had to rent a storage unit to house it.</TE>
<TE>   "We tend to be overly optimistic about our safety because we are
such a safe community," said Laguna Beach Councilwoman Cheryl
Kinsman. "We tend to forget that there are criminals out there who
can figure that out."</TE>
<TE>   People who want to see whether police hold their property should
call the Laguna Beach Police Department at (949) 497-0377.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and the City Council on Friday
ordered a review of whether low-level radioactive waste was dumped at
a Sun Valley landfill and if it is now a health hazard.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn and the council cited a report by the California Integrated
Waste Management Board that Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Field
Laboratory disposed of waste at the Bradley Landfill without the
knowledge of state regulators or local officials. "There were
hearings in Sacramento and it was brought to light that through a
possible loophole, low levels of radioactive waste were possibly
dumped," said Council President Alex Padilla. "How much and to what
extent we don't know, but it was [dumped] in Sun Valley."</LD>
<LD>   The review will be conducted by the city's Environmental Affairs
Department.</LD>
<TE>   Gary Gero, assistant general manager for the department, said
local rules prohibit dumping radioactive waste at the landfill. He
said the department has no evidence any rules were broken.</TE>
<TE>   Rocketdyne officials have said the materials disposed at the
landfill met federal safety standards.</TE>

<HD>A.T. Goins, 87; One of Few to Survive White Mob's 1923
Rosewood Massacre</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A.T. Goins, one of the few survivors of the 1923 massacre by a white
mob in the small Florida town of Rosewood that left the predominantly
black community in ruins, has died. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Goins, who was awarded $150,000 in compensation by the Florida
Legislature in a highly publicized fight in 1994, died March 24 in
St. Petersburg. The cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   The massacre, documented in the 1997 movie "Rosewood" from
director John Singleton, began on Jan. 1, 1923, when a white mill
worker's wife in the nearby town of Sumner claimed that she had been
attacked by a black man.</LD>
<TE>   A posse was formed to search for the assailant and went straight
to Rosewood, a community of perhaps 200 residents.</TE>
<TE>   When no suspect was found, the posse turned into a vigilante mob,
pulling blacks from their homes and burning structures. The siege
went on for six days and the mob grew in size, eventually numbering
as many as 300 people.</TE>
<TE>   While the official death toll was six blacks and two whites, black
descendants of Rosewood have alleged that many more were killed and
their bodies hidden in mass graves.</TE>
<TE>   Three days into the siege, the mob came to the home of Sarah
Carrier, one of Rosewood's leading residents. The mob had called for
Carrier to come out of her house and she refused. Goins, Carrier's
grandson, was 8. He was hiding upstairs with several other children.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony to the Legislature, Goins recalled the assault on the
house.</TE>
<TE>   "Grandma didn't want to go out, so the mob just started shooting
in the house," Goins said. "Grandma got hit in the head with a
bullet."</TE>
<TE>   Goins' grandmother was killed. So were two members of the mob, who
were shot by Sylvester Carrier, Sarah Carrier's son, as they tried to
enter the house.</TE>
<TE>   "They bust right in that front room and came right into the
hallway," Goins said.</TE>
<TE>   Goins and several other children escaped from the house and were
led by an adult to safety in the nearby woods.</TE>
<TE>   A train eventually came and took the survivors of the
attack--mostly women and children--to Gainesville. Goins said that he
believed the train was sent by a white businessman who had dealings
with the people of Rosewood.</TE>
<TE>   Black descendants of Rosewood maintained that the attack on the
mill worker's wife was carried out by the woman's white lover, a
railroad worker, and that she made up the story of the racial attack
in an attempt to save her marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Goins said that his sister told him she had seen the woman's
attacker. "My sister said she seen this man go out and step across
the fence," Goins said. "She said it was a white man."</TE>
<TE>   The survivors of the Rosewood massacre fled to various parts of
the state. Goins returned briefly to the area as a teenager when he
was playing for a baseball team.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the last time I've been to Rosewood," he told the St.
Petersburg Times some years ago. "I don't want no part of Rosewood."</TE>
<TE>   All the survivors kept quiet about the events, fearing
repercussions.</TE>
<TE>   That silence lasted until the early 1980s when a reporter for the
St. Petersburg Times happened upon the area near Rosewood and asked
residents why the area was all white. Shocked and intrigued by the
answer, reporter Gary Moore spent the next two years searching for
survivors and piecing together the Rosewood story. A segment of CBS'
"60 Minutes" later explored the massacre and the long-buried secret.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1990s, there were calls to provide survivors of the
massacre and their descendants with restitution for their suffering.</TE>
<TE>   The state Legislature appointed a team of scholars from several
Florida universities to investigate the claims. The scholars
determined that police in Rosewood "failed to control local events"
and failed to contact the state government for help. Despite some
legislators' reservations, administrative analysts recommended that
damages be paid.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the eight known survivors was awarded $150,000. Another
$500,000 was designated for families that lost property in the
massacre and a $100,000 fund was established for minority
scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   Goins is survived by his wife, Anna Maude, a sister and nine
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Isn't Welcome, Black Leaders Say</HD>
<DH>Politics: Angered at the mayor's opposition to a new term
for Police Chief Parks, they vow to exclude him from events.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angry at Mayor James K. Hahn over his opposition to a second term for
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, Los Angeles black leaders revoked an
invitation for Hahn to speak at the Urban League's annual awards
dinner Thursday in Century City.</LD>
<LD>   And that was just a start, said John W. Mack, president of the Los
Angeles Urban League.</LD>
<LD>   Unless the mayor changes his position on Parks, some Los Angeles
black leaders, including many who backed him during his campaign,
have vowed to continue to exclude Hahn from their parties, political
rallies and Sunday pulpits, according to a letter sent to Hahn by a
coalition of black leaders.</LD>
<TE>   "This is some big-time stuff and it is not to be taken lightly,"
Mack said. "He has burned a major political bridge that will come
back to haunt him."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, like his late father, Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth
Hahn, has been a frequent visitor at black churches in South Los
Angeles. But since the mayor came out against Parks' bid for a second
term as chief in February, black leaders have looked upon him with
anger and betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Commission is set to decide Parks' fate
next week.</TE>
<TE>   In a March 12 letter, black leaders, including Cecil Murray and
Charles Blake, warned the mayor that he was no longer welcome "in
pulpits, at annual dinners and other events." Matt Middlebrook, a
Hahn spokesman, said the letter had not shaken the mayor's resolve to

<TE>   "It's unfortunate that these community leaders express this view
based upon a single decision," Middlebrook said. "Regardless of their
views, the mayor will continue to fight to ensure the public safety
for the entire community."</TE>

<HD>R. Huggins, 87; Created 'Maverick,' 'Fugitive'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roy Huggins, the prolific writer-producer whose name is associated
with many of television's biggest hits, including "Maverick," "The
Fugitive" and "The Rockford Files," has died. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Huggins, whose long television career was marked by a flair for
creating series concepts and characters that defied convention, died
of natural causes Wednesday in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll be forever in his debt," said James Garner, who became a
star playing the wisecracking gambler who wasn't afraid to back out
of a fight in the Huggins-created "Maverick" and later played offbeat
private detective Jim Rockford in "The Rockford Files," which Huggins
co-created.</LD>
<TE>   "Roy was a giant in the television industry," said producer Jo
Swerling Jr. "He was brilliant. He had a very fertile mind and was a
great storyteller. I think he had a sort of natural sense of popular
art of the time."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in the mid-1950s at Warner Bros., where he helped the
movie studio make its transition into television production, Huggins
produced "Cheyenne," a Western starring Clint Walker. The show, which
debuted in 1955, was television's first filmed hourlong series.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to "Maverick," Huggins created the Western "Colt 45"
and the hit detective show "77 Sunset Strip," which spawned a raft of
other hourlong television detective shows.</TE>
<TE>   In 1962, after serving briefly as vice president of 20th Century
Fox Television, Huggins joined Universal Television, where he served
as executive producer of "The Virginian" in its first year. He also
created "Run for Your Life" and served as executive producer of
"Alias Smith and Jones."</TE>
<TE>   While at Universal in the 1970s, Huggins began his association
with Stephen J. Cannell and together they created "The Rockford
Files" and "City of Angels," a short-lived detective series starring
Wayne Rogers. Huggins also served as executive producer for the
Cannell-created "Baretta," starring Robert Blake.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, after Cannell formed his own studio, he lured Huggins out
of retirement to produce "Hunter."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coming Up With Idea for 'The Fugitive'</TE>
<TE>   The most successful Huggins-created series was "The Fugitive,"
starring David Janssen as Dr. Richard Kimble, a man who is falsely
accused of murdering his wife and then escapes from the authorities
to pursue the real killer--a one-armed man.</TE>
<TE>   Huggins came up with the idea for "The Fugitive" in 1960 after
leaving Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   "Westerns were tremendously popular at the time," he told The
Times in 1993, "and I was trying to figure out how to put that kind
of genre into a contemporary environment.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to have a hero who behaved like a Western hero--who was
totally free, had no permanent residence or commitments or
responsibilities."</TE>
<TE>   But Huggins found no one who shared his enthusiasm. For two years,
everyone from his close friends to his agent told him the idea would
ruin his career.</TE>
<TE>   "They thought it was distasteful, glorified lawlessness and seemed
pointless," he recalled. "I was so upset I decided to enter graduate
school at UCLA to study political theory; I was through with
television."</TE>
<TE>   Only after reluctantly agreeing to pitch a series idea in a
meeting with ABC President Leonard Goldenson did Huggins find someone
who agreed that "The Fugitive" was a great idea for a TV series.</TE>
<TE>   The show ran from 1963 to 1967, its last episode scoring the
largest audience in history at that time.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fugitive" spawned a hit feature film in 1993 starring
Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, a feature sequel and a revival TV
series in 2000 for which Huggins again came out of retirement to
serve as executive producer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Roy was very drawn to unconventional heroes," Cannell
said Friday. "The easy and safe thing to do is what you've seen
before--to do a show that you've seen before or characters that
you've seen before in circumstances you've seen before.</TE>
<TE>   "Roy never did that. Roy always came to things with a unique
perspective, and that allowed him to create shows like 'Run for Your
Life' and 'Maverick.' He didn't just follow the normal trend of what
television was. What a unique program 'Run for Your Life' was--a guy
told he's only got a year left to live and decides to pack all his
life into one year. Nobody had done a show like that."</TE>
<TE>   And "The Fugitive," Cannell said, "was a very offbeat idea at the
time. A guy falsely accused of murdering his wife and on the run from
the police. In those days, people said the police would never make a
mistake. It was a bold concept. But that was Roy. Roy was a guy who'd
take a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Huggins was born in Littell, Wash. In 1914, he graduated Phi Beta
Kappa, summa cum laude from UCLA. At the outbreak of World War II, he
was working on his doctorate in political science. While working as a
civilian employee of the U.S. government during the war, he was
inspired by Raymond Chandler and spent his spare time writing
hard-boiled crime fiction.</TE>
<TE>   His first novel, "The Double Take," was published in 1946. He
published two more novels, "Too Late for Tears" and "Lovely Lady,
Pity Me," on which he later loosely based "77 Sunset Strip."</TE>
<TE>   Huggins' publishing success led to a writing contract with
Columbia Pictures, which released "Too Late for Tears" in 1949. He
worked as a contract writer for Columbia and RKO and in 1952, he
wrote and directed "Hangman's Knot," a Western starring Randolph
Scott.</TE>
<TE>   Then came television.</TE>
<TE>   "He taught me everything that I used through my career on how to
create and write and produce a television show," said Cannell, who
first met Huggins in the mid-'70s when Huggins was executive producer
of "Toma," a police drama, and Cannell was the producer.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't have been luckier," said Cannell, who remembers
Huggins' great sense of humor and ageless quality.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when he was in his 80s he was like a guy 30 years old,"
Cannell said. "He was always hip, current. He talked the talk of
young people. He wasn't an old man in his head at all." During his
long career, Huggins wrote some 350 scripts and stories, many of them
credited under the pseudonym "John Thomas James," after his three
sons.</TE>
<TE>   John Thomas James even had his own parking space at Universal,
said Swerling, adding that agents were so impressed by the prolific
John Thomas James that they often called to see if he had
representation.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to have a lot of fun with that," said Swerling, adding
that one other thing Huggins didn't get recognition for was coming up
with the idea of the Movie of the Week in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Huggins is survived by his wife of 50 years, former actress Adele
Mara; three sons, Thomas, John and James; his son and daughter from
his first marriage, Bret Huggins and Katherine Huggins Price; and
five grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. April 13 at St. Martin
of Tours, 11967 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Public to Open Irvine Co. Gift Today</HD>
<DH>Land: Tours of the vast wilderness donated by the company
begin. The expanse is home to rare flora and fauna.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hikers, mountain bikers and horseback riders will get their first
peek at 11,000 pristine acres of northern Orange County's back
country beginning today when the Irvine Co. opens its North Ranch
conservation area to the public.</LD>
<LD>   The land is studded with sheer canyons, striking ridgelines,
majestic oak woodlands and expanses of coastal sage and chaparral.
Bats, rattlesnakes, bobcats, hawks and even an occasional mountain
lion roam these unspoiled lands.</LD>
<LD>   The Nature Conservancy, which currently is managing the land, is
guiding small tours every weekend. However, if your interest is
piqued, you're out of luck until May.</LD>
<TE>   "The tours ... are booked up through the end of April," said Trish
Smith, a Nature Conservancy senior project ecologist at the Irvine
Ranch Land Reserve. "This is the first time public access has been
allowed on these lands."</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Co. and the Nature Conservancy will be working over the
next 18 months to fashion a comprehensive management plan for the
land, which could include guided tours and unsupervised access.
Eventually the Irvine Co. will hand over the land to a public agency
or nonprofit group.</TE>
<TE>   "There's such a rich diversity out there, and the goal of our
program is to try to allow people to see that and enjoy at least a
taste of it as we are doing our planning," said Monica Florian, a
senior vice president at the Irvine Co.</TE>
<TE>   Florian is one of a select group of people who has seen the land
many times, and she can't pick a favorite spot.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many unique places, from deep canyons to fern
grottoes to really beautiful rolling hills. There's sage country
which is open and fresh, yet there's areas that are more riverine,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   She added that the area's proximity to city life is forgotten once
inside the vast wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   "You would not think that over the hill or right around the bend
is the urban center of Orange County, which I think makes it double
special for people," Florian said.</TE>
<TE>   On the hiking, biking and riding trips, people will see rocky
outcroppings, caves and rare flora, including one of the world's
three locations of Tecate cypress trees. The tours also will take
visitors to up to three canyons, including Fremont Canyon, called the
"Yosemite of Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   The trips are vigorous and designed for the physically fit.
Mountain bike and equestrian tours will be 11 to 15 miles, and hikes
will range from four to 14 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Claire Schlotterbeck, founder of Brea-based Hills for Everyone,
said the tours are wonderful, but not just for recreation.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're talking about places like this, you're not just
talking about fun and games," she said. "You're talking about places
where people can go to heal themselves and reconnect to the land and
each other, and we all need that. There's something in the human
spirit that needs open space."</TE>
<TE>   To make reservations for an upcoming tour, call the Nature
Conservancy at (714) 832-7478.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Wolfgang F. Stolper, 89, an economist whose work included a theory
used to explain the effect of international trade on wages, died
Monday in Ann Arbor, Mich., during surgery to clear a blood clot.</LD>
<LD>   Stolper was perhaps best known for the 1941 Stolper-Samuelson
theorem, done in collaboration with Paul Samuelson, which changed
existing notions about the effect of open trade on the economies of
trading nations.</LD>
<LD>   Stolper's contribution said that while trade stimulates economic
growth, it's not always beneficial to all workers.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Vienna, Stolper's family moved to Berlin after World War I
but later fled the rise of Nazism in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Stolper attended Harvard, where he received his master's degree
and doctorate in economics. He also taught at Harvard, as well as at
Radcliffe and Swarthmore, before joining the University of Michigan,
where he was a professor from 1949-82.</TE>

<LD>The jury of the first Rachmaninoff International Competition and
Festival stunned spectators Friday night by eliminating audience
favorite Alessio Cioni from the finals of the competition because of
his "lack of preparation in his performances in the final round."</LD>
<LD>   By unanimous decision, first place in the Pasadena competition
went to Evgeni Mikhailov, 29, of Russia, who won $30,000, a Kawai
concert grand piano valued at $28,000 and a concert date with the
Mexico City Philharmonic. Second place and $20,000 were awarded to
Mizuka Kano, 23, of Japan.</LD>
<LD>   Cioni, 23, of Italy, will remain "designated a formal
semi-finalist," however. There was no third place awarded. The three
other finalists will receive $10,00 each.</LD>
<TE>   The competition, organized by the Russian Ministry of Culture,
Master Classes International of Pasadena and the city of Pasadena,
began March 16 with 30 contestants from 15 countries.</TE>

<HD>Pomona College Head to Retire</HD>
<DH>Education: After 11 years as president of the Claremont
school, Peter Stanley says he'll step down next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Stanley, a historian who has served as president of Pomona
College since 1991, announced Friday that he will retire next year
from the prestigious liberal arts school.</LD>
<LD>   Stanley, 62, said he chose to step down because he is reaching a
natural break in his presidency as the college approaches the end of
a five-year fund-raising campaign expected to collect $180 million.</LD>
<LD>   "It just seems like the right time for the college to take a fresh
look," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Before arriving at Pomona, a school in Claremont with 1,550
students, Stanley had already enjoyed a wide-ranging career. He began
as an assistant professor of history at the University of Illinois,
where he founded the Committee on Asian Studies. He then moved to
Harvard University, serving as an associate professor and coordinator
of the Henry Luce Program in American-East Asian History.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley later was chief academic officer at Carleton College in
Minnesota before heading the Ford Foundation's education and culture
program, the position he held immediately before taking the Pomona
job.</TE>
<TE>   Among his accomplishments at Pomona, Stanley cited the growth of
the college's endowment from $364 million to the current $1.1
billion. That level gives Pomona what the school describes as the
highest endowment per student of any college in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley also cited Pomona's continuing academic improvement. It is
among the top schools in the country in the percentage of enrolling
freshman who go on to graduate school: 90%. It also ranks high in the
portion of graduates who later earn PhDs: 11%.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Stanley said, the school's faculty has become more
diverse. The percentage of minority faculty members has risen from
14% in 1991 to 22% today, while the portion of faculty positions held
by women has climbed from 33% to 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Stanley cited a new program in cognitive science, a new
on-campus institute promoting understanding of East Asia and the
United States, and the continuing renovation of the school's science
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart R. Smith, an investment manager and lawyer who is chairman
of the Pomona College Board of Trustees, said a search committee will
be established later this spring to find a successor. Stanley's
retirement takes effect in June 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The college, Smith said, "has never been in better shape."</TE>
<TE>   Smith said Stanley indicated he planned to hold the job for 10
years when hired in 1991, and that the board is pleased that "we
actually got a couple of extra years out of him."</TE>
<TE>   Jake Oken-Berg, student body president, said Stanley's "level of
involvement and care for student issues has been exceptional."</TE>
<TE>   Oken-Berg said that early in his freshman year, when he was
playing Frisbee with classmates, Stanley joined in. The Frisbee,
Oken-Berg recalled, "didn't go that far" but his willingness to try
left an impression. "I don't think there are too many presidents who
would do that in their business suits."</TE>
<TE>   Following his retirement, Stanley, a pianist, plans "to read,
write and recover my ability to make music." He said he and his wife,
Mary-Jane Stanley, a former teacher, have not decided where they will
make their main residence but will continue to live at least
part-time in Connecticut, where they have a home. Their daughter,
Laura, attends Smith College in Massachusetts.</TE>

<LD>Police are investigating an apparent homicide after a tip led them to
a decomposed body near San Juan Creek on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County sheriff's detectives found a man's body about 1:30
p.m. under the Interstate 5 Freeway overpass near San Juan Creek
Road, sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said.</LD>
<LD>   The man had not been identified late Friday, and the cause of
death had not been determined, Amormino said.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators suspect homicide because they received three
anonymous calls in the last week about the body.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives searched the area but did not find anything until
Friday, when the third call led them to the body, Amormino said.</TE>

<LD>A Ventura woman accused of helping two skinheads kill a teenage girl
pleaded not guilty Friday to murder charges as her defense lawyer
demanded access to documents he contends support claims of misconduct
by law enforcement.</LD>
<LD>   State prosecutors last month dismissed a murder indictment against
Bridget Callahan, 30, to avoid a possible legal challenge and filed a
new criminal complaint.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Callahan pleaded not guilty in the October 1998 slaying
of Nichole Hendrix, 17, of Ventura. A preliminary hearing was set for
July 9. She remains in custody without bail.</LD>

<LD>Ventura police said one of their detectives had no choice but to
fatally shoot a teenager suspected of car theft after the youth
pulled a knife during a fight with the officer in the parking lot of
a downtown motel.</LD>
<LD>   "There was just no time for talking. They were less than three
feet away" from each other, Ventura Police Sgt. Brock Avery said
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "The officer was close and the threat was immediate."</LD>
<TE>   The suspect, Randy Reeves, 19, of Ventura, was dead when the
ambulance reached Ventura County Medical Center on Thursday shortly
after the 7 p.m. shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The officer, whose name was not released, shot the suspect in the
confrontation outside the Topper Motel &amp; Liquor store in the 1600
block of Thompson Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   The detective was placed on paid leave, a standard procedure in
such cases.</TE>

<LD>Muslim leaders met with Secretary of State Colin Powell this week to
press for increased U.S. involvement in the continuing crisis in the

<LD>   The Arab American Institute's chairman, George R. Salem, and
president, James J. Zogby, gave a list of recommendations to Powell,
who was ordered to the region on Thursday by President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   The Arab American leaders urged the implementation of a U.N.
Security Council resolution that would end Israel's military action,
called for the placement of an international peacekeeping force to
bring security to the region, and requested that a date be set for
continuing security and political talks aimed at achieving a lasting
resolution to the crisis.</LD>

<DL>ANNAPOLIS, Md</DL>
<LD>ANNAPOLIS, Md.--Mealtime prayers at the U.S. Naval Academy might
cease if the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond upholds a
lower court's ban on saying grace at Virginia Military Institute.</LD>
<LD>   In light of the VMI case, Naval Academy officials are reviewing
the legality of traditional prayers at lunch, which probably date
from the school's founding 157 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   A judge ruled in January that grace before meals at VMI is
unconstitutional, supporting an American Civil Liberties Union claim
based on separation of church and state. The Virginia case could set
a precedent covering religious practices at military schools and
other public colleges.</LD>

<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II has invited the world's 1 billion Roman Catholics
to join in prayer Sunday for an end to the "inhumane brutality"
between Israelis and Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   Only the power of prayer can change the "stubborn determination of
those on both sides [who] continue to advance on the road of
retaliation and vendetta," the Roman Catholic pontiff said.</LD>
<LD>   The pope, 81, who made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land two years
ago, said the "ever more tragic news" from the Middle East gives "the
impression of an unstoppable drift of inhumane brutality."</LD>

<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>In an unprecedented court verdict, Christian actress Hala Sidqi has
won a 10-year court battle to divorce her husband, an outcome
previously obtained in Egypt only by Muslims.</LD>
<LD>   She is the first Christian woman granted divorce under a law,
known as Khula'a, which has made it easier for a Muslim woman in
Egypt to get a divorce without her husband's consent.</LD>
<LD>   The law allows immediate divorce if three months of attempted
reconciliation fails to bring the couple back together, or six months
if the woman has children. Under Islamic law, men may divorce wives
promptly, without court authority.</LD>

<HD>Suspended Priest Will Ask Anglicans for Help</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A leading conservative Episcopal priest barred from his Pennsylvania
pulpit is planning to seek help from Anglican bishops when they meet
in London this month.</LD>
<LD>   The Rev. David Moyer, who was suspended from his suburban
Philadelphia parish on March 4 after a long-running feud with Bishop
Charles Bennison, told the Washington Times he was not going to
London to "cause trouble."</LD>
<LD>   "I am going to seek their counsel and their intervention," said
Moyer, who is also president of Forward in Faith, a group of
conservative and evangelical Episcopalians.</LD>
<TE>   Moyer, rector of the Church of the Good Shepherd in Rosemont, has
denied Bennison communion and refused his pastoral visits because of
the bishop's liberal theology. The diocese's standing committee voted
to "inhibit" Moyer for six months, and Bennison approved the move
soon after.</TE>

<DL>LINCOLN, Neb.</DL>
<LD>The Nebraska Supreme Court is being asked to decide what defines a
church in a case stemming from a liquor license granted to an Omaha
store that was challenged by a nearby church.</LD>
<LD>   The city denied the Kum &amp; Go store a liquor license because it is
within 150 feet of the House of Faith. The store then got the state
Liquor Control Commission to grant the license, claiming the House of
Faith doesn't meet criteria for a church.</LD>
<LD>   The commission says a church is "a building owned by a religious
organization used primarily for religious purposes," but House of
Faith rents space in its building.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After evangelist Billy Graham apologized for anti-Jewish remarks made
to President Nixon 30 years ago, his son said his remarks were taken
out of context and were not aimed at all Jews.</LD>
<LD>   Franklin Graham, the handpicked successor to his father's
evangelism empire, told the Charlotte Observer this week that the
1972 Oval Office conversation was private and never should have been
made public.</LD>
<LD>   "Any time you have a private conversation with anybody and it's
taped and released, your confidence has been broken," the younger
Graham said.</LD>
<TE>   Billy Graham, a confidant and spiritual advisor to several
presidents, reportedly told Nixon that Jews controlled the American
media. "This stranglehold has got to be broken or the country's going
down the drain," the evangelist said at the time.</TE>

<LD>   Brown said the legislation sent the wrong message to businesses
seeking to locate in the city. He called the measure anti-job and
said it would be bad for the city's tax base.</LD>
<LD>   The measure would have required all large retailers except grocers
to get a special permit from the city Planning Commission and even
the Board of Supervisors in some cases.</LD>

<DH>Violence: Four lives are snuffed out in a murder-suicide,
leaving neighbors and police to grope for answers.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Out along the tidy lawns of Santa Clara's Madrone Avenue, most
neighbors hardly knew the Schiefer family, except to say hello.</LD>
<LD>   That quiet seclusion in the heart of Silicon Valley came to a
tragic end, Santa Clara police said Friday, with a murder-suicide
that left all four members of the family dead and detectives
scrambling to answer why.</LD>
<LD>   Police suspect that Tae Young Schiefer, a 41-year-old native of
South Korea, used a .38-caliber pistol to kill her estranged husband,
Ulrich, and her two children, Elsa, 12, and Jessica, 5. She then
apparently turned the gun, purchased a few weeks earlier, on herself,
investigators said.</LD>
<TE>   "No one knew them too well, but they seemed like a normal family,
well adjusted," said Albert Orozco, a neighbor who lives two doors
down.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were having problems, they sure kept it to themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Detectives suspect the killings occurred Monday evening.</TE>
<TE>   Police say the Schiefers had been having marital difficulties.
Ulrich, a 38-year-old native of Germany, had moved out two months
ago, taking the youngest daughter. Tae Young had remained in the
family home with Elsa, her eldest daughter from a previous marriage.</TE>
<TE>   The couple met in Germany and had been married for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   When Ulrich Schiefer did not show up for work for three days, his
boss at a Mountain View software firm drove to the house about noon
Thursday, peeked through a glass door and saw a body.</TE>
<TE>   Police later entered the house to find Ulrich Schiefer sprawled on
the floor inside the front door, dead of multiple gunshot wounds.
Elsa, also dead of a gunshot wound, was on a couch.</TE>
<TE>   The mother and 5-year-old Jessica were discovered upstairs. Tae
Young Schiefer still held the pistol, detectives said. The girl's
tiny body was in a bed next to her, wrapped in a blanket.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very disturbing crime scene for me," said Det. Kurt
Clarke. "I have kids. There's a lot of blood."</TE>
<TE>   Police say that, judging from the number of rounds fired, they
believe Tae Young reloaded the weapon during the shootings. While it
appeared that a struggle had taken place inside the home, there were
no signs of forced entry, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators on Friday were trying to contact relatives in
Germany and South Korea to get more information about the Schiefers'
relationship, police said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman at Peregrin Systems, the Mountain View software firm
where Ulrich Schiefer worked, declined to discuss anything about him,
other than to confirm that he worked for the company and to offer
condolences to surviving family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said the family members attended the annual block party
on the street, but otherwise mostly kept to themselves. Jessica, the
5-year-old, played soccer, and Elsa was active in the Girl Scouts and
ran track at school.</TE>
<TE>   Nora Love, 80, would exchange greetings with Tae Young Schiefer
when the mother took walks with her younger daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "Their youngest was a cutie, and her mother seemed to take such
pride in her," Love said. "The mother was very friendly, nice
looking. She seemed to enjoy her children.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine what brought them to this," she said.</TE>

<HD>Program on E-Mails Is Latest Bid to Carve a Niche in the Airwaves</HD>
<DH>Radio: The hosts broadcast church officials' missives on
molestation allegations against some priests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are a provocative talk radio duo whose exploits have included
broadcasting lurid excerpts from the purported diary of a judge accused
of child molestation and questioning women in Rep. Gary Condit's office
on whether they slept with their boss.</LD>
<LD>   Now the hosts of "The John and Ken Show" on KFI-AM (640) have grabbed
a piece of another national scandal, broadcasting a string of e-mail by
Los Angeles Archdiocese officials struggling to contain child molestation
allegations against some priests.</LD>
<LD>   The electronic dispatches between Cardinal Roger M. Mahony and others
were obtained by the show's producer from an anonymous source earlier
this week.</LD>
<TE>   In broadcasting the e-mail, John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou, hosts of
"The John and Ken Show," are seeking to pull apart from the talk radio
pack by placing themselves in the middle of developing news. While
American talk radio is filled with high-decibel personalities, the KFI
hosts' crusade to influence the outcome of public controversies pushes
beyond the traditional scope of the genre.</TE>
<TE>   "They are the burr under the saddle of whomever they happen to
target," said Al Peterson, an editor specializing in news talk radio for
the national trade publication Radio and Records. "They're a pair who
appear to be pretty confident and not at all shy about identifying what
they believe to be wrongdoing, especially among public officials."</TE>
<TE>   They are also, according to Kobylt, starting to attract a younger and
increasingly more female demographic, which is exactly what advertisers
want to see.</TE>
<TE>   Kobylt and Chiampou say they are not activists. They are
ratings-seeking personalities who are unapologetic about trying to find a
niche in a market dominated by conservatives catering to an older, white
male audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Most talk radio shows are still obsessed with bashing Bill Clinton,"
Kobylt said Friday. "We're going after people in authority that are
covering up horrible scandals."</TE>
<TE>   The talk show hosts read some of the e-mail on the air Thursday
afternoon, but stopped when an attorney for the archdiocese called to say
it had obtained a cease-and-desist order. "We wanted to be safe rather
than sorry, so we pulled back," said the show's producer, Ray Lopez.
After a Superior Court judge ruled that the missives could be made
public, Kobylt and Chiampou read the e-mail in its entirety Friday
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office dispatched an
investigator to KFI during the broadcast to obtain copies of the e-mail,
which the station also provided to The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said in a statement that he is prepared to
pursue an investigation into "illegal access of private confidential and
perhaps privileged information." His spokesman said the station was
cooperative and said there were "no suspects at this time."</TE>
<TE>   "The John and Ken Show" strategy is an evolving mix of guts, stunts
and populist outrage. Last spring, they took on Orange County Superior
Court Judge Ronald C. Kline, who was campaigning to retain his post while
under house arrest on child molestation charges.</TE>
<TE>   Kobylt and Chiampou broadcast from the cul-de-sac outside Kline's home
and read excerpts from a diary alleged to be Kline's in which he
rhapsodized about the players of Little League baseball. Kline is trying
to get his name off the ballot for the general election in November.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, they offered actor Robert Blake, whose wife's killing
remains unsolved, $64,000 in exchange for him answering direct questions
about her execution-style murder.</TE>
<TE>   "Our pressure on Kline convinced someone to turn over his diaries. Our
pressure on the archdiocese convinced someone to hand over the e-mail,"
Kobylt said. "That's something new for us. We're starting to get stuff
leaked to us."</TE>
<TE>   Kobylt and Chiampou have been partners for nearly 15 years. Kobylt is
from New Jersey, and got his first radio job in 1983 at a station in
Canton, Pa., WKAD. A year later he met Chiampou, and by 1988 they got a
chance to work together at a low-wattage oldies station in Atlantic City,
N.J. Their first campaign began in 1990 when they were anchoring an
afternoon show at WKXW-FM, a station in northern New Jersey. Gov. Jim
Florio, who had raised taxes, was running for reelection. Kobylt and
Chiampou introduced each legislative roundup with the sound of pigs, and
added a new song to its mix: "Florio Has Got to Go."</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1990s, they had moved to KFI in Southern California, and
listeners grew accustomed to their show, which is conservative but not
predictable in its politics.</TE>
<TE>   Although KFI is the top-rated local talk station, with such
personalities as Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura Schlessinger, "John and Ken"
trails its principal rival, KABC-AM (790), in the afternoon-drive
competition.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent data from ratings service Arbitron for listeners 12
and older, KABC's Larry Elder came in ahead of Kobylt and Chiampou,
although they still attract a large audience.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, they were dumped by KFI after five years, and were
immediately picked up by KABC, which placed them in the morning
drive-time slot. Fourteen months later they were fired again, and
rejoined KFI.</TE>

<HD>FDA OKs Secretin in Pancreas Care</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Doctors struggling to diagnose pancreatic illnesses will soon get a
new aid. The government approved the first synthetic version of the
hormone secretin Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Secretin is a digestive enzyme best known as a controversial, unproved
treatment for autism. But the substance, derived from pig intestines,
long was used to help diagnose serious pancreatic dysfunction or a
pancreatic tumor called a gastrinoma. Then in 1999, the sole secretin
producer quit selling; dwindling leftover supplies have been available
since then only in clinical trials.</LD>
<LD>   The Food and Drug Administration gave approval Friday to SecreFlo, the
first synthetic secretin, for pancreatic diagnosis. It was classified an
orphan product because only about 15,000 patients a year may need it--but
for them, it is an important diagnostic tool.</LD>
<TE>   "Secretin is still the best way" to diagnose pancreas illnesses, said
Dr. Lilia Talarico, the FDA's gastrointestinal drugs chief.</TE>
<TE>   The drug's effect on gastrointestinal secretions helps diagnose
pancreatic dysfunction, where thick mucus prevents essential enzymes from
breaking down food. Secretin's effects on another hormone in the
bloodstream can help doctors spot a gastrinoma earlier than with other
tests.</TE>
<TE>   A synthetic version carries less risk of allergic reactions, Talarico
said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the new secretin is 99.6% pure, while the pig-derived product
was only 60% pure, said Edward D. Purich of ChiRhoClin Inc., a
five-person company in Silver Spring, Md., that came up with the
synthetic idea and hired a mix of other companies to help make it
reality.</TE>
<TE>   The drug will be marketed by RepliGen Corp., which is conducting
clinical trials of secretin and autism.</TE>
<TE>   A price has not yet been set, Purich said.</TE>
<TE>   The first batches should begin selling this summer, although he said
doctors can contact ChiRhoClin to get doses sooner for possible
gastrinoma patients.</TE>

<HD>Religion Page Blocks Florida Education Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>A special legislative session called by Gov. Jeb Bush to pass a
sweeping education measure ended in chaos Friday over a provision
allowing students to pray and speak about religion in schools.</LD>
<LD>   An angry Bush said he would call lawmakers back to Tallahassee next
week to try again.</LD>
<LD>   The fight erupted in the Senate, which refused for the second time in
two weeks to pass the bill that would rewrite the school code, because of
the religion provision.</LD>
<TE>   "It's one page out of an 1,800-page document," said the Republican
governor, who supports the provision.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats opposed the provision and some Senate Republicans
joined them.</TE>
<TE>   "The opposition spread like wildfire," said Senate President John
McKay, a Republican.</TE>
<TE>   The House already had approved the bill, worked on for months by the
Florida Board of Education and legislative staffers. It reflects changes
made to education in the last three years, such as creation of a board to
oversee public schools, community colleges and state universities.</TE>
<TE>   The religion provision would give students the right to pray, express
their religious beliefs in homework, distribute religious literature and
speak to other students about religion.</TE>
<TE>   Those are constitutional rights students already enjoy. The provision
is based on guidelines that the American Jewish Congress, the American
Civil Liberties Union and the Anti-Defamation League have prepared to
help school administrators across the country understand what courts have
said can be done in schools.</TE>
<TE>   Some senators voiced concern about the effect of the language.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have the church of devil worship or we could have the church
of witchcraft or we could have the church of the Taliban," said Sen.
Ginny Brown-Waite, a Republican.</TE>

<HD>Panel Seeks to Even Scales on Cocaine Sentencing</HD>
<DH>Crime: Disparities in powder, crack penalties are cited. The
Justice Department opposes any lesser punishments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Sentencing Commission indicated Friday that it will ask
Congress to change drug laws to reduce differences in punishments
involving crack cocaine and powder cocaine, a change the Justice
Department believes is unnecessary.</LD>
<LD>   The sentencing commission, in a statement, said it was concerned not
only about whether cocaine punishments were fair but also "whether the
penalties are perceived as fair."</LD>
<LD>   The commission cited figures showing that a person must possess 100
times more powder cocaine than crack cocaine to receive a comparable
sentence.</LD>
<TE>   To address the situation, the Justice Department would prefer that
Congress increase sentences for powder cocaine crimes, not lower
sentences for those involving crack. Reducing crack sentences would
signal "a retreat in our nation's fight against illegal drugs," Deputy
U.S. Atty. Gen. Larry Thompson told the sentencing commission last month.</TE>
<TE>   Under U.S. law, a defendant is sentenced to at least five years for
trafficking in 500 grams of powder cocaine or 5 grams of crack.</TE>
<TE>   The commission said its members concluded unanimously that the
punishment differences were "not appropriate," even while acknowledging
that sentences in crack cocaine cases ought to be tougher than in cases
involving powder cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   "The sentencing commission chooses to bring light rather than heat to
this subject," the commission's statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Gen. Viet Dinh has described the 100-to-1 figures
as misleading. A recent Justice Department study found that crack
defendants convicted of trafficking in cases involving fewer than 25
grams of cocaine received sentences roughly five times longer than the
same defendants in powder cocaine cases.</TE>
<TE>   "The department opposes any legislative proposal to lower the
penalties for trafficking in crack cocaine," Dinh said. "The crack
epidemic has had a devastating effect on its victims, and the law needs
to continue to protect those victims in our most vulnerable communities."</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department said the sentencing commission rejected a
measure that would have automatically lessened penalties for some crack
defendants, unless Congress objected. Instead, the commission recommended
that Congress consider reducing penalties for crack cocaine, the
department said.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who plans to cut city aid to museums,
theaters and other cultural institutions, quietly dipped into his
personal fortune to help them out, donating $10 million just before he
took office.</LD>
<LD>   The billionaire media executive gave the money to the Carnegie Corp.
in December, a source knowledgeable with the contribution said Friday.
The story was first reported by the New York Post.</LD>
<LD>   A Bloomberg spokesman declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   When the Carnegie Corp. announced awards Feb. 11 created by the
donation, it said an anonymous benefactor had specified that the money
help institutions "struggling in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Carnegie President Vartan Gregorian selected 137 arts and cultural
organizations in the city for gifts. The awards ranged from $25,000 to
$100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg, who speaks frequently about the importance of arts and
cultural institutions, amassed his estimated $4-billion fortune from a
media and financial information company that bears his name.</TE>
<TE>   The donation was made after Bloomberg won election but before he took
office Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Publicly, Bloomberg has insisted that he would not dip into his
personal fortune to bail out the city, which is facing its worst fiscal
crisis in years.</TE>
<TE>   To help bridge the city's $4.76-billion budget deficit, Bloomberg has
proposed deep cuts in aid to cultural institutions and has delayed
projects, including a major refurbishment of Lincoln Center.</TE>
<TE>   The budget for the cultural affairs department would see cuts of $9.7
million next fiscal year and as much as $19 million in ensuing years.</TE>
<TE>   Arts and cultural organizations are suffering their worst economic
woes in 30 years, as attendance and private contributions dropped in the
aftermath of the terrorist attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center
in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg's $10 million has gone to an array of organizations.</TE>

<HD>Romney's Run for Governor Hits a Sour Note</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEWTON, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>Republican Mitt Romney, who entered the race for governor last
month in a blaze of Salt Lake City Olympic glory, is facing a GOP
backlash heading into the party's convention this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Some Republicans are angry and disappointed that Romney chose a
running mate, state party chairwoman Kerry Murphy Healey, instead of
letting convention delegates decide, as he had pledged to do.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't crown kings!" said John Wragg, a delegate who supports
Healey's opponent, businessman James Rappaport. "It's not 'One person
chooses.' The people choose. That's what democracy is all about."</LD>
<TE>   Rappaport, for his part, called Romney's choice of Healey "a cold,
political calculation" that a woman would help him on the ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Some Rappaport supporters were so incensed that they proposed during a
conference call this week to disrupt the convention by holding a
candlelight vigil outside Romney's reception, by abstaining from the vote
to endorse Romney or by walking out of the convention altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few weeks ago, support for Romney's then-undeclared candidacy
seemed at a fever pitch. A March 14 poll showed that three-quarters of
Republicans favored the chief organizer of the 2002 Winter Olympics over
GOP acting Gov. Jane Swift. Five days later, Swift tearfully quit.</TE>
<TE>   Romney, 55, said he is not surprised at the criticism.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my high-water mark in popularity was the day I announced,"
said Romney. "I expect a decline until election day, when I hope it will
be at least a point or two above my opponents."</TE>
<TE>   Romney said the choice of Healey, a 41-year-old professor and criminal
justice expert, gives balance to the Republican ticket.</TE>

evening "Tickling Adam's Rib," at the University of Judaism in Bel-Air
today, Sunday and Tuesday, can be made by calling (310) 476-9777, Ext.
201. The extension is necessary because the university's switchboard is
closed for the Passover holidays. The reservation number ran without the
extension in Thursday's Calendar Weekend and will appear that way again
in Sunday Calendar, which was printed before the error was caught.
Reservations may also be made by calling the show's producer, Jeannine
Frank, at (310) 471-3979.</LD>

et al, at the group's concert Saturday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre.
Which is not to say that they couldn't do it with violinists Darol Anger,
Michael Doucet and Bruce Molsky and cellist Rashad Eggleston on the
roster.</LD>
<LD>   "Nobody knew how this was going to turn out when we first got
together," says Doucet, best known for his work as the leader of the
Cajun supergroup, Beausoleil. "Somebody said, "Oh, four fiddle. players,
they'll just play 10,000 notes! But our approach has been just the
opposite--to get the feeling down and let the notes follow. I know that I
played differently than I ever had."</LD>
<TE>   The product of that first encounter was a debut album, "Fiddlers 4"
(Compass Records)--an eclectic assemblage of Americana ranging from Duke
Ellington's "East St. Louis Toodle-oo", to Doucet's Cajun fiddle tune,
"Atchafalaya Pipeline." The group's first tour begins with the Barclay
appearance Saturday, followed by a Da Camera Society concert at Union
Station on Sunday, and winds up in Somerville, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   "We made the record in November," Doucet recalls, "and it was so much
fun, just learning the songs--all of which came out different from the
way they started. You knew what the song was, you knew what the melody
was, but you didn't know what everybody else was going to do, which is
what was neat--it kind of created a synthesis of sounds that you can't
get by just playing music that's completely written."</TE>
<TE>   That's not surprising, given the players' diverse backgrounds. Doucet
is a Cajun music legend. Anger, a prominent member of the Dave Grisman
Quintet (among numerous other groups), is also a founding member of the
Turtle Island Quartet and a trailblazer in blending jazz and bluegrass.</TE>
<TE>   Molsky has been dubbed "The Rembrandt of Appalachian Fiddling"; name a
regional style and he can not only play it, he can describe its
historical sources.</TE>
<TE>   Eggleston, the newcomer in the group, was the first string player
admitted to the Berklee School of Music on a full scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   "Rashad's just a kid," says Doucet recalling a time when he invited
him along for a jog. "And he said, "Let me go with you. I ran the Boston
Marathon once." And I said, "What? How did you prepare?" And he said, "I
didn't; I just thought about doing it a half hour before the race. But I
was really sore afterward." That's the kind of guy he is--filled with
totally spontaneous energy."</TE>
<TE>   That energy extends throughout the quartet and throughout the songs on
their album, most of which will be performed in their two Southland
programs. The version of Ellington's "East St. Louis Toodle-oo," for
example, captures both the period jazz rhythms and the "jungle" qualities
present in the Duke's music of the early '30s.</TE>
<TE>   Doucet's vocals on pieces such as "You Little Wild Thing (La
Be-taille)" and "Danse Caribe" add character and atmosphere. And offbeat
selections add spice to their repertoire, such as the melody
"Hidirassirifo," and "African Solstice," in which the fiddles simulate
the sound of an African balaphon, or xylophone.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea" says Doucet, "was to do the kind of Americana quartet that
had never really been done before, in which we could each play our own
songs, our own sounds, while at the same time accompanying and supporting
the various styles of the others. In doing so, we were hoping to create a
whole new style."</TE>
<TE>   The question of what that style would be is a bit uncertain. Not that
it really matters, whether the quartet is playing laid-back Cajun style
or the hard-swinging, improvisatory blend that Anger calls "jazzgrass."</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line with us," says Doucet, "is that--as different as we
are--we all play dance music, in one way or another. And that's a pulse
that has its own mind.</TE>
<TE>   "It's infectious. Once you start it, it's just there, and it's hard to
stop it. And that's what Fiddlers 4 is all about."</TE>
