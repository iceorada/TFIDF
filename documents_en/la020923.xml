<HD>Sexual Blackmail Persists Despite Change in Mores</HD>
<DH>Society has become more tolerant of affairs and
homosexuality, yet the market for those who would profit from
titillating revelations still exists. An upcoming book examines the
subject.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1997, a woman named Autumn Jackson, who claimed to be Bill Cosby's
daughter from a brief affair 20 years earlier, threatened to go
public with the allegation unless the comedian paid her $40 million.
Instead of delivering the money, Cosby, who had given Jackson about
$100,000 in "loans" and paid for her college education, reported the
blackmail threat to the FBI.</LD>
<LD>   The case was a classic example of sexual blackmail, said Angus
McLaren, a professor of history at the University of Victoria in
British Columbia, Canada, and author of "Sexual Blackmail: A Modern
History," due next month from Harvard University Press.</LD>
<LD>   "Blackmail is a form of robbery that usually involves the use of
threats to a person's reputation and an effort to extort money," said
McLaren, whose book explores sexual blackmail through the last two
centuries in the United States and England. The practice expanded,
said McLaren, as the idea of middle-class respectability flourished.
"Reputations are very important in a society where there are
professionals because you cannot move on with a destroyed reputation.
Some judges ruling on blackmail cases have said that if you destroy a
man's house, he can rebuild it, but if you destroy a reputation, you
can't rebuild it. That's why some judges referred to blackmail as
being worse than murder."</LD>
<TE>   Sexual blackmail occurs when a person attempts to profit from the
threat to sell sexual secrets, criminal or illicit, McLaren said. The
accuser often uses the threat to extract hush money from the victim
and, in some cases, this launches a cycle of extortion.</TE>
<TE>   But the less legal, common usage of the term "sexual blackmail"
has come to mean disclosure of sexual secrets to hurt someone or to
mete out revenge, McLaren said. Former Miss North Carolina Rebekah
Revels, for instance, dropped out of this year's Miss America pageant
because an ex-boyfriend threatened to sell topless photos of her.
After Revels changed her mind and asked a court to reinstate her in
the contest, the judge determined that pageant officials should make
the call. The officials refused to allow her to compete.</TE>
<TE>   Sexual blackmail occurs much less frequently today than it has in
the past. "Interest in the classic sexual blackmail scenario has
diminished in part because of the pervasiveness of tabloid television
and tabloid journalism," McLaren said. "And after the 1960s sexual
revolution, laws about abortion, marital infidelity, homosexuality
and divorce changed along with modern attitudes about sex, putting
sexual blackmail in decline."</TE>
<TE>   A related scenario today, he said, is a tabloid paying someone to
entice a politician or celebrity--preferably one who espouses
conservative values--into a compromising sexual situation for photos
and a story. (Frank Gifford and Dick Morris come to mind.)</TE>
<TE>   McLaren, whose book examines the way sexual blackmail cases have
played out in the courts, the press and society, said that
historically, sexual blackmail narratives have been one of the few
legitimate ways sexual behavior could be discussed publicly during
sexually repressive times. Sexual blackmail also played an important
role in shoring up class, racial and gender lines, provided people a
venue to air anxieties about sexual temptation and tacitly regulated
sexual behavior. The stories were cautionary tales about what happens
when socially transgressive sexual urges are not kept in check.</TE>
<TE>   "Sexual blackmail stories legitimized discussion of subjects that
were taboo--like marital infidelity, abortion, prostitution,
homosexuality and the question of sexual bartering, such as to what
extent does a man owe something to a woman he had seduced," McLaren
said. "The presumption was that the man was the seducer and the
question was, did the woman have any legitimate demands?"</TE>
<TE>   Modern sexual blackmail emerged in the 18th century when criminals
realized laws against sodomy and the social disapproval of certain
sexual behaviors afforded ways to extort money from men who could be
entrapped, McLaren writes. Homosexuals were the dominant victims of
sexual blackmail and the criminalization of blackmail was first used
to protect 18th century Englishmen from accusations of sodomy. In the
last half of the 19th century and the 20th century, laws outlawing
sodomy allowed sexual blackmail to proliferate. "When you had a
certain law that outlawed a sex act, the law itself provided the
blackmailers with a weapon," McLaren said. "Blackmailers were like
the morality police, levying fines against people who they thought
were fair game because they were viewed as social pariahs."</TE>
<TE>   There was a lull in sexual blackmail stories during World War II,
when the war diverted attention. What ultimately reversed the tide
for blackmailers soon after WW II was reform of the laws
criminalizing certain sexual acts and a 1948 report on the sexual
behavior of men by Alfred Kinsey (45% of men surveyed said they had
had at least one homosexual experience in their lives) and Kinsey's
later report on female sexual behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "People came to understand sexuality better," McLaren said.
"Kinsey said that normal sexual behavior was a myth. Many women
weren't virgins at marriage. His reports revealed that almost
everyone had had an affair before or after marriage. Women revealed
they'd had abortions and many men reported that at one time in their
life they had had a homosexual experience."</TE>
<TE>   The gay rights movement's attack on victimization and the women's
movement also contributed to the rise in modern sexual tolerance for
a wide variety of sexual practices.</TE>
<TE>   This sexual tolerance, McLaren argues, is part of the reason Bill
Clinton was not removed from office. People were not that upset by
sexual activity between two consenting adults even if one was an
extraordinarily powerful married man and the other a young, naive
intern, McLaren said.</TE>
<TE>   But even now, when there is a less moralistic take on sex and an
increasing social tolerance for sexual foibles, sexual secrets still
have the power to titillate if not destroy.</TE>
<TE>   "There appears to be no abatement," McLaren said.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean the other night on television Saddam Hussein's ex-mistress
told the audience that he took Viagra. It is amazing how secrets
never fail to fascinate people despite all the liberalization of
sexual mores."</TE>

<LD>DESOLATION</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   by Yasmina Reza</LD>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf</TE>
<TE>   144 pages, $19</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yasmina Reza is best known in this country as the author of the
Tony Award-winning play "Art." The Paris-based former actress is also
the author of several other plays produced over the last decade or
so, including "Conversations After a Burial," "Winter Crossing," "The
Unexpected Man" and "Life x 3." Given the rather dispiriting state
into which the theater has fallen, to say that Reza is one of our
more gifted contemporary dramatists may not sound like all that
ringing an endorsement, but her work has been one of the brighter
spots on a less than lustrous theatrical scene.</TE>
<TE>   Freshly translated from the French by Carol Brown Janeway,
"Desolation" is being billed as Reza's first novel, although her
autobiographical novel "Hammerklavier" was published in France in
1997. "Desolation," however, is not all that far from being a play.
It is a dramatic monologue: the cantankerous, funny and fierce
rantings of a vociferously discontented old man who sees
discontentment as a true sign of vitality.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel Perlman, as we discover in the course of his outpourings,
is a businessman in the clothing trade, married twice, the father of
two adult children, whom he finds disappointing. Much of what he says
is addressed to his absent son, a laid-back, 38-year-old,
island-hopping layabout whose cheerfully lackadaisical approach to
life is sheer anathema to his relentlessly questing old parent:</TE>
<TE>   "Hats off, my boy, one generation and you've wiped out the only
credo by which I've lived. I, whose only terror is the daily
monotony, who would swing open the gates of Hell to escape that
mortal enemy, I have a son who samples exotic fruits with the
savages.... I'm not even sure you understand why I'm concerned about
you. That I can worry about your lack of worry must strike you as a
new phase of my monomania, no? You wonder why I don't relax, you say
to yourself what does he do with his days, in a state of perpetual
metamorphosis, what's the sense of it, never sated, never appeased.
Appeased! Don't know the word. My son, any man who has tasted action
dreads fulfillment, because there's nothing sadder or more washed out
than the accomplished act."</TE>
<TE>   Samuel's claim that he'd rather his son were a criminal or a
terrorist than a happy-go-lucky idler is a typical specimen of Reza's
effective, if perhaps overwrought, efforts at dramatizing her hero's
state of being.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel is just as dismayed by wife Nancy's constructive attitude
toward life and her newfound interest in humanitarian causes: "She
loves people, she wants the best for all humanity. Starting at dawn.
The woman is so upbeat, it's a nightmare, from the moment she gets
out of bed." He much preferred her when he first met her, and she was
mildly apathetic and melancholy, free from thoughts that ran contrary
to his.</TE>
<TE>   Rambling about his various male friends, his daughter and
son-in-law, his incompetent cleaning woman and his exceptionally
stupid--hence in his eyes, desirable--former mistress, Samuel sets
forth his anti-philosophical philosophy of life: "Life is our
impatient desires. Reality is what has to give way. That's my theory.
The rest is women's nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   War and strife, he insists, are preferable to comfort. The idea
that we can--or should--be cognizant of reality is an affront to
man's essential state of solitude. And since, as he believes, we
can't get outside our own minds, the "real world" is not "real" to
us. "The world is not outside us," he declares. And as we grow old,
our inner world--the only one that matters--shrivels. Samuel seems to
embrace this state of "desolation" with a kind of stoical equanimity.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through his perorations, there's a ray of light: an
encounter with a woman, Genevieve Abramowitz, who seems to be very
much on our monologist's wavelength. Given their shared worldview,
only a certain measure of communion is possible, but however limited,
it is at least existentially authentic.</TE>
<TE>   "Desolation" is not a long book, objectively considered. Nor,
despite its repetition and narrow range of focus, does it seem unduly
long. Reza manages to hold our attention, draw us into her
protagonist's consciousness and keep us interested and agitated. But
one feels, in some respects, that it is still more a stage piece than
a novel: Its repetition, for example, might be more effective in the
mouth of a compelling actor than on the printed page. And even
considered as drama, it seems rather thin and strained compared, say,
with Eugene O'Neill's treatment of a similarly bleak existential
theme in "The Iceman Cometh."</TE>
<TE>   But failure to measure up to O'Neill is not the same as failure
per se. "Desolation" provides a stark yet bleakly comic look at the
limitations and solitude inherent in the human condition. In Samuel
Perlman, Reza has created a character who may disdain the human
capacity for sympathy yet somehow manages to enlist ours.</TE>

<KH>Spring 2003 New York  Collections</KH>
<HD>Brits, by Fashion</HD>
<DH>Many of London's designers are bypassing their hometown and
bringing their flamboyant and dramatic lines straight to New York</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It's been more than 200 years since we sent them packing, but the
Brits managed to colonize a corner of fashion week here this season.
Animal lover Stella McCartney opened her first store, in the Meat
Packing District, oddly enough, with a party that boasted the week's
longest stretch of red carpet. At an art gallery on West 27th Street,
London interior-turned-fashion designer Allegra Hicks hosted an
informal show of her upmarket caftans for the uptown social set,
while handbag designer Lulu Guinness held court at a Seventh Avenue
showroom. And was that really Joanna Lumley and Jennifer Saunders
clinking champagne glasses with Graham Norton at the Harper's Bazaar
party? Indeed, the Brit wits were in town filming scenes for a new
season of the BBC fashion spoof "Absolutely Fabulous."</LD>
<LD>   At the Bryant Park tents, designers Matthew Williamson and Luella
Bartley were the Brits to watch--both are at the stage in their
careers when they are ready for a large, international backer.
Bartley's collection married the casual sensibility of American
sportswear with the color and energy of the London street, while
Williamson showed Miami-inspired muumuus to an audience that included
none other than Britney Spears and her entourage of eight security
guards.</LD>
<TE>   London has long been a farming ground for fashion designers
including Vivienne Westwood, Alexander McQueen, John Galliano and
McCartney, all of whom moved on to Paris as soon as they got a whiff
of international recognition. But lately, British designers have been
bucking that trend, choosing to build their businesses by showing in
New York instead.</TE>
<TE>   "It's money, money, money," said Edward Aydin, who develops
fashion-related TV programming in Britain. "New York is where the
business is. London and Paris are not trading cities. You can't even
set up a bagel store on the street in London. They'd arrest you. In
New York, people are working everywhere, all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Williamson, 30, launched his line five years ago in London. He
presented in New York for the first time last season, and the show
more than paid for itself when his Guatemalan-stripe jackets and pink
paisley velvet coats (in stores now) were a hit with buyers from
Henri Bendel and Fred Segal, as well as with American magazine
editors.</TE>
<TE>   "London is a nurturing city where talent is born, but in New York,
people take fashion more seriously.... Commercialism is not a bad
word here like it is in the U.K.," said Williamson, who knew he
wanted to be a fashion designer at age 11 and who now counts Sophie
Dahl and Jade Jagger among his muses.</TE>
<TE>   Bartley, 29, a former fashion journalist, has been showing here
for three seasons now. "I feel very looked-after here. People treat
me the same as they would a really big designer," said the freshly
scrubbed blond, whose collection was inspired by a newfound love
(fashion photographer David Sims) and a newfound love of sports. Chic
athletic wear came in the form of a pink denim motocross-inspired
jumpsuit, a black knit tank top and boy short ensemble trimmed in
pale pink that resembled a man's 1930s bathing costume, and an
ice-cream stripe jacket of the sort cricket players sport, all worn
by models made up to look like they had a post-workout flush.</TE>
<TE>   While it's difficult to define any one British aesthetic, many
fashion watchers agree that despite their reputation for being plain
and dowdy, the English are really quite flamboyant dressers. After
all, London was the birthplace of the dandies, mods and punks. And
Mary Quant, Zandra Rhodes, Westwood, McQueen and Galliano are all
known for their dramatic, if sometimes over-the-top, clothing. Many
of them also graduated from Central Saint Martins College of Art and
Design, which has what is regarded as one of the world's best fashion
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "All eccentrics come from England," said Hicks, who is married to
Ashley Hicks, also an interior designer. "Nothing is too much. You
can walk around in strange attire and no one looks at you."</TE>
<TE>   For spring, many American fashion designers responded to the shaky
economy by filling their collections with basics. But they may have
done better with more peacockish pieces, according to Glenda Bailey,
British expat and editor in chief of American Harper's Bazaar. "Now,
women want things that are special and unique to complement their
existing wardrobe, pieces they can grow old with. And that's what
British designers excel at," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Williamson does well enough to pay for another New York
trip remains to be seen. There's a fine line in fashion design
between being provocative and being salable. L.A. boutique owner
Tracey Ross was unsure about the collection of muumuus (on Britney?),
halter dresses and wrap blouses trimmed in a pastel-colored Aztec
pattern that looked as if they had been lifted straight from the
curtain rod of a low-budget Miami Beach motel room.</TE>
<TE>   She thought the pieces might be a tad too colorful for her
customers. "I liked the black halter dress, but I'm still trying to
figure out if there's anything else I can buy," said Ross, who
skipped the London shows in favor of New York and Paris.</TE>
<TE>   With so much design talent leaving Britain, it's no wonder that
London Fashion Week continues to have difficulty attracting the usual
corps of press and buyers who make the seasonal rounds to New York,
Paris and Milan, even when organizers swapped dates with New York
Fashion Week to accommodate Sept. 11 memorials here.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a chicken-and-egg thing. Editors don't go to London because
all the big designers have left to show in other places. At the same
time, the big designers leave because so many buyers and editors
don't come to London," said Alice Sykes, a British import who works
for Lulu Guinness in New York and who is one-third of the Sykes
fashion trifecta. Her sisters are American Vogue writer Plum Sykes
and American Marie Claire fashion editor Lucy Sykes, who also live in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Bartley and Williamson may be the latest big names to have
abandoned London Fashion Week, but there didn't seem to be many hard
feelings among Brits who attended the shows in New York last week.
Outside Williamson's Bryant Park show Friday night, London Sunday
Mirror reporter Alan Greenhalgh, wore a rhinestone Union Jack cuff
bracelet and snapped souvenir photos of his friend Louise Mancini,
founder of the London-based fashion Web site BeautyandtheDirt.co.uk.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to see your friends do well," said Mancini, who works
across the hall from Williamson's studio in London's Fitzrovia
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "And you want to see Brits do well."</TE>

<LD>Meet Corita Kent</LD>
<LD>   Think of a line from a song or the name of a product. What do the
words mean? Does the meaning change if you rearrange the words? This
is exactly what artist Corita Kent did. She took names we have all
heard, such as "Wonder Bread," and gave them new meaning in her works
of art.</LD>
<LD>   Corita's style was called "Pop Art" because she borrowed words and
images from popular culture (newspapers, advertisements, songs and
stories) to make new works of art.</LD>
<TE>   In the 1960s, Corita took words and pictures from newspapers to
make art about the Vietnam War, Martin Luther King Jr., President
Kennedy and labor leader Cesar Chavez. To remind people to be kind to
each other, she used words from "Peanuts" cartoons, from stories such
as "The Velveteen Rabbit" and from Beatles songs.</TE>
<TE>   Corita also painted billboards with messages of peace. She even
painted a huge rainbow for the Boston Gas Co. on one of its giant gas
tanks near Boston Harbor. It is the largest painting in the world.</TE>
<TE>   You can try making Pop Art. Pick a favorite story. What makes it
special? Cut out words and pictures from magazines that show your
feelings about it and arrange them on a piece of paper. Use crayons
to add color. You will have made a new work of art.</TE>
<TE>   Corita Kent died in 1986, but her colorful art lives on at the
Corita Art Center. To learn more, call (323) 466-2157 or visit

<LD>"Welcome to Kindergarten"</LD>
<LD>   by Anne Rockwell</LD>
<LD>   This story is about a boy named Tim and his first day at
kindergarten. He was scared of the bigger kids at the school.</LD>
<TE>   I was also scared and I cried, but after I read this book and
learned about all the fun things at school, I was not scared any
more.</TE>

<TE>   "Holes"</TE>
<TE>   by Louis Sachar</TE>
<TE>   "Holes" is about Stanley Yelnats, who is convicted of stealing a
famous baseball player's ("Sweet Feet's") shoes. When Stanley gets
sent to Camp Green Lake, he is forced to dig holes 5 feet deep, 5
feet wide and 5 feet long--to build good character!</TE>
<TE>   They're also digging for another reason: to find "Kissin' Kate"
Barlow's (a western outlaw's) treasure!</TE>
<TE>   This book also tells about Stanley's great-great-grandfather, whom
Stanley calls "my
no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather."</TE>
<TE>   I enjoyed reading this book because it was interesting and I
couldn't put it down.</TE>

<DH>New Yorker's Anthony Lane marks a decade of criticism with
an anthology</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whatever gives people the idea that Anthony Lane is a senior citizen?
The dashing movie critic for the New Yorker magazine turns 40 in
December. But his reputation as a brainy expert with a writing style
as graceful as Fred Astaire's dance steps has piled the years onto
his image. He was lining up for tickets to the popcorn movie
"Rollercoaster" during an age when "Chinatown" was making film
history. But people still expect him to be a silver-haired literary
lion.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe it's because they think you shouldn't make pronouncements
unless you've lived a full and useful life," he says about the
misconception. Just to prove them wrong, 10 years' worth of
pronouncements pepper his new anthology, "Nobody's Perfect, Writings
From the New Yorker" (Knopf).</LD>
<LD>   The book brings together several hundred of Lane's essays and
reviews on books and movies, literary figures, pop culture icons and
film stars. (The Los Angeles Times praised Lane "for writing
extraordinarily well and for wearing his erudition so lightly," the
New York Times compared his movie reviews to "a tray of delicious
candies.")</LD>
<TE>   He turns his sharp intuition and comic wit toward everything from
home cooking with Martha Stewart and Julia Child to the literary
lives of T.S. Eliot and A.E. Housman. Not to mention the fame of
Julia Roberts, as well as Buster Keaton. "I like to traffic back and
forth between the movies' ability to represent the world and other
ways there are to represent the world," he says. "It keeps me on my
toes."</TE>
<TE>   Born in England, educated at Cambridge University, Lane lives in
London with his wife, newspaper columnist Allison Pearson, and their
two children. He says he is a hopeless square who never hangs out
with movie stars or spends more than a few hours at a time in
Hollywood. "Taking a new route to my children's school in the morning
makes it a wild and crazy day," he says.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles on his book tour, he began his first day by filing
a movie review that was due to his editor before breakfast. That and
jet lag could explain his pale complexion, but he blames it on his
years spent in dark screening rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly crisp for a journalist, Lane's polished loafers and
pressed navy jacket suggest that he may never fit the rumpled image
of a writer. But, as he often points out in reviews, things are not
usually as they appear.</TE>
<TE>   He started his career as deputy literary editor for the London
Independent and he reviewed books as well as movies there for several
years before he joined the New Yorker in 1993. He still screens films
in London at least as often as in New York. "Do you think most people
know I live in London?" he wonders a bit uncomfortably. His
British-ness does raise a question about whether a critic who lives
on a separate continent can get a grip on American culture--the stuff
U.S. movies are made of.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't go into a movie review thinking of American culture," he
says. "How do you even define such a thing? Hopefully, a review will
suggest fresh ideas of what that culture might be."</TE>
<TE>   Bumping into Harrison Ford, who was working on a movie across from
Lane's Beverly Hills hotel, made him think not of Hollywood, but of
France. "It's like waking up in Paris to see a man on a bicycle
carrying croissants," he says. "It's just what you'd expect."</TE>
<TE>   His reviews twist and turn in the same unpredictable way. When he
wrote about a revival of "The Sound of Music" two years ago, he began
his review outside the movie theater where ticket holders dressed as
nuns were smoking cigarettes and others were outfitted as "brown
paper packages tied up with string," inspired by the musical's
lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   In a graceful glide, he steered the piece into a serious essay
about the unsettling effects of the movie by comparing "The Sound of
Music," which was set during the World War II, with "Meet Me in St.
Louis," which was made during that war. "Why does 'Meet Me in St.
Louis' maintain the status of a nimble masterpiece while 'The Sound
of Music' limps along behind?" he wrote. "Then again, how come
Vincente Minnelli's ['St. Louis'] of 1944 was reckoned merely a
success, while Robert Wise's ['Sound of Music'], made 20 years later,
is a gold-plated phenomenon? The answer to both questions is the
same: because Minnelli showed happiness to be the most fragile of
possessions, whereas Wise backed it as a sure thing." Today and
forever, he concluded of Wise's choice, "that is what moviegoers want
to hear."</TE>
<TE>   Like any critic worth reading, Lane always inserts himself into
his writing, sometimes physically. When he reviewed a batch of
cookbooks in a pre-Christmas roundup of 1995, he added a sketch of
himself at home in the kitchen. There he was, making dinner for
friends, "holding onto the sink, finishing off the Cote du Rhone that
was supposed to go in the stew." Had he been following Martha
Stewart's menu correctly, he confessed, he would have been handing
around phyllo triangles with lobster filling by this point, not
getting sloshed in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   That review taught him that cookbooks, not movies, are the way to
win the most admirers. "I had more response from that article than
anything else I'd written," he says. "Cooking is something that
everybody does, for better or worse. Food is like sex. Both things
that most of us try and aren't very good at."</TE>
<TE>   Reading Stewart's cookbooks reminds him of Margaret Thatcher, who
was Prime Minister of England when Lane was growing up. "I recognized
the type," he says. "Martha runs the kitchen the way Lady Thatcher
ran the kingdom. It seemed quite clear the level of control going on
in Martha's world."</TE>
<TE>   Connections like this make perfect sense coming from Lane. At the
Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills, where he was interviewed
recently by New York magazine film critic Peter Rainer as part of the
"Writers Bloc" literary series, Lane talked about movies, of course,
but also about authors and actors and obituary columns. In his mind,
they all relate.</TE>
<TE>   What does he remember about his favorite actors? The way some of
them walk. "There is the Cary Grant walk, the Gary Cooper walk. And
Fred Astaire running up a flight of stairs in the movie 'Funny Face.'
Who runs up stairs like that?"</TE>
<TE>   Can a bigot make great art? Rainer asks. Lane dived into the
debate in an essay about the British poet T.S. Eliot in a review of
"Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909-1917," a 1997 anthology
edited by Christopher Ricks. In that review he traced Eliot's rise to
genius stature, but also pointed out the poet's severe limits.</TE>
<TE>   "The anti-Semitism of Eliot can't be excused," Lane told his
Writers Bloc audience. "We can't excuse him by saying he was a man of
his time." But, he also argued that imperfect men and women do make
great art. Separate the art from the artist or you will miss the most
brilliant works of history.</TE>
<TE>   Flaws and contradictions fascinate Lane. He gets more interested
in actors if their movie image doesn't fit their private life. Winona
Ryder, accused of shoplifting this summer, plays a pinnacle of virtue
in Martin Scorsese's "The Age of Innocence." "She may be a troubled
soul in some ways," Lane says. "I'm interested in people's feeble
nature if it feeds into their image on screen."</TE>
<TE>   The late Claude Rains intrigues him for the same reason. Cool and
gallant in Alfred Hitchcock's "Notorious," he was married at least
six times in real life. "After wife No. 3 or so, you have to think
Rains must have had something to do with it," Lane says.</TE>
<TE>   It is these quirks of human nature, of human lives not quite
adding up that might explain his obsession with obituaries. He reads
them faithfully and wonders if the subject of the article would agree
with what was written. "The truth is, in the end we're not likely to
say, 'Wasn't I smart to trade in my stock options at just that moment
and make a fortune,' " Lane suggests. "We're more likely to say,
'God, I wish I'd kissed her.' "</TE>
<TE>   One of his more surprising essays for the New Yorker is a review
of several collections of obituaries from the New York Times and the
London Daily Telegraph. "The art of the obituary is a minor one, but
an art," he says. "The pro will hunt down lives that might not at
first seem interesting and find ways to bring out comedy without
being insulting. Novelists would see it as second nature. They are
always looking at the life of the guy who cleans the rafters." James
Joyce, for example, in "Ulysses," Lane suggests. "Leopold Bloom
making breakfast is far more interesting than a man running a
country."</TE>
<TE>   He imagines himself at his funeral, correcting the eulogizers from
somewhere out of sight. "No, I wasn't that way," he warns them in a
stage whisper. "I wasn't kind, not really. And I didn't like animals
at all."</TE>

<DH>When her son, 4, wears toenail polish, he learns how hard
it is to flout peer pressure</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In my mind, it will remain the summer of the painted toenails. Other
things happened, good and bad, but none quite as unexpected as the
toenails and all the alarm and furor they kicked up.</LD>
<LD>   It started sometime in late spring, when Danny Mac, a few months
past his fourth birthday, noticed that his best friend's toenails had
the ability to change colors. Sometimes they were pink. Sometimes
they were red. Sometimes they were reddish pink. Danny Mac thought
his toenails should have this capability as well, so he turned in a
request to the head of acquisitions and distribution--Mama. Which is
to say he announced one day: "I want rainbow toes just like Bailey."</LD>
<LD>   Obstacles presented themselves immediately. The chances of my
being in possession of a non-petrified bottle of nail polish were
pretty slim; of my having the manual dexterity to apply it to such
small surfaces, almost nil. I popped the old "next time we're at the
store" CD into the maternal hard drive. "You always say that," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   It occurred to me that, at 4, his concept of "always" was a bit
limited, but there was a germ of truth in what he said. So I rummaged
and discovered in the medicine cabinet a miraculous bottle of
metallic blue polish, the presence of which I could not explain under
oath. With strains of "Scarlet Ribbons" wandering through my head, I
bent over my son's feet and did my level best not to go outside the
lines.</TE>
<TE>   I had to admit the blue toenails looked quite fabulous, and of
course his little sister, Fiona, had to have hers done too. Then I
did mine. My husband declined--he is a bit outside the
toenail-painting-male demographic--but he swallowed once, twice and
dutifully admired his son's feet. Soon we were all dancing around the
house with glittering rainbow toes, and I wondered why I hadn't
thought of this before--so much joy from such a little thing.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Danny Mac went to school. Not unexpectedly, he took
his toes with him. And when he came home, he had learned many things,
including that some people thought nail polish was for girls, and
that boys who wore it were sissies.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose I should have seen this coming, but I really hadn't. For
one thing, he was wearing shoes and socks. For another, he is 4.
Which isn't to say that the mini-gender police weren't already
issuing citations; they had been for about six months--about clothes
and games and colors. But nail polish? I figured most kids were just
getting acquainted with its existence, and there hadn't been time to
do a gender-breakdown study.</TE>
<TE>   And then, there we were stuck with that word "sissy." Why is this
word still in the vernacular? What exactly does it mean, anyway?
Effeminate? Skinny? Smart? Kind? Artistic? Weakly? Gay? I am almost
40 and I still don't know precisely what this word means. All I know
is that it has probably started more wars than organized religion,
and if I weren't trapped by my own anti-censorship bias, I would
request that it be banned from the English language.</TE>
<TE>   So I had to explain this word to our son. I said there are very
few things in this world that are just for girls or boys and that
nail polish is not one of them. I told him that there is nothing
wrong with liking things that girls like, with doing things that
girls do.</TE>
<TE>   I told him the word "sissy" doesn't mean anything and that if
someone calls him that, he should just ask them what they mean and he
will see that they don't even know. "Just tell them they're being
ridiculous," I said.</TE>
<TE>   Later, I overheard my husband telling Danny Mac that if the kids
don't stop teasing him when he asks them to, he should hit them. Just
once. Hard enough so he doesn't have to do it again. Deep down inside
me burned a tiny spark of gratitude and glee.</TE>
<TE>   You see what the word "sissy" does to people.</TE>
<TE>   At bath time that night, I reminded Danny Mac that he didn't have
to have painted toenails if he didn't want to, that I could take the
color off right now. "But I like it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So the next day he tried his new word--" 'diculous"--and that
worked for a while. He asked for green toes next, and then gold. We
went to the store and bought lots of colors. His favorite was a
bright red with sparkles in it. Before we got it, I warned him that a
lot of people would say that only girls wear red, and he said he
didn't care.</TE>
<TE>   But the kids still teased him, and he did so care. He had his
allies--his best friend, Bailey, is his stouthearted supporter in all
things, and they have been through this before. When they were 3 or
so, some of the older girls told Bailey it was "yucky" to play with
boys, and some of the boys told Danny the same thing about girls.</TE>
<TE>   Friends since infancy, they didn't even need a parental pep talk
for that one. "You're just wrong," Bailey told those girls, with a
Susan Sarandon shrug.</TE>
<TE>   At swim class, the instructor, a young man, took one look at Danny
Mac's feet and said "Cool toes, dude." I could have kissed him. When
Danny Mac came home the next day, head hanging because of the sissy
thing, I tried to explain to him that when you're really cool, the
people who are not at all cool sometimes say mean things.</TE>
<TE>   Again I offered to take off the paint. Again he said, "But I
really like my toes." And so we painted a rainbow, a different color
on each toe. Kneeling on the bathroom floor, I tried not to lean into
the future, tried not to see all the battles that lie ahead over
haircuts and friends and clothing, over music and sports and wanting
to do and be and see things that are different. I tried not to
remember how hard it all seems for so many years, how hard it is
still, even at 40, even at 50, even forever.</TE>
<TE>   By this time the weather was warm enough for sandals, and watching
Danny Mac walk into the schoolyard with his resolutely different boy
feet closed my throat with pride. Here he was, at 4, taking on peer
pressure, taking it on and shrugging it off. I punched my husband in
the shoulder--that's our son.</TE>
<TE>   Then one evening he barged into the bathroom and asked me to take
the polish off. Two kids kept teasing him and teasing him, and he was
tired of it. "They won't stop, Mama," he said. "No matter what I do.
Take the colors off."</TE>
<TE>   For a minute I wanted to refuse. I didn't want him to fold just
because two kids had nothing better to do than watch his feet and
criticize. Who were these kids, anyway? Point them out, I wanted to
say, and I'll give their parents a call and have a little
conversation about bigotry and tolerance and what life in an urban
setting, what life in America, is supposed to be about. Ignore them,
I wanted to say, what they say doesn't matter. They don't matter.</TE>
<TE>   But I couldn't do any of those things, and neither could he. It's
hard to ignore what other people think, especially when you've just
discovered that other people think at all and that sometimes they
think about you.</TE>
<TE>   I took off the polish, and he smiled at me and ran out into the
yard.</TE>
<TE>   Over the phone, I told a friend the story of the summer of the
toenails and how hard it was to realize that peer pressure and gender
pressure start so young. "Look," said my friend, who is a fairly free
spirit herself, "we're constantly pushing ourselves against the
boundaries, figuring out what is worth fighting for and what isn't.
Danny Mac didn't cave, he made a decision. He decided toenails
weren't worth the grief. Someday he'll find something that is, and
he'll know exactly how to fight for it."</TE>
<TE>   I hope she's right. We all need to choose our own battles. Even at
4. Someday, with any luck, he'll be able to ignore what other people
say about him. Someday, with any luck, those "other people" will
include me.</TE>

<HD>A Valet? There Goes the Neighborhood</HD>
<DH>A parking service in Silver Lake signals another shift away
from its bohemian self</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't the fancy coffeehouse. Not the froufrou boutique or the
fussy cheese shop. Silver Lake has always had those.</LD>
<LD>   It was something else that tipped the balance--something so
incongruous it packed a fright. And like most things unnerving that
arrive in the night, it was difficult to square in one's mind.</LD>
<LD>   "Well, get a load of that!" said my dinner companion as he rounded
the corner, stunned by what greeted him.</LD>
<TE>   It was a valet service--stand, umbrella and quick attendant in
black pants and vest. And it was installed along a stretch of Sunset
Boulevard that is home to a leather fetish shop, a cluster of
antiques stores, a coffee shop and a motley mini-mall, the mismatched
boutiques that for some time now have made Silver Lake Silver Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Gentrification arrives in different guises. It might slip in as an
imperious bistro or 15 varieties of mustard on the corner market's
shelves. But in this neighborhood one might be hard-pressed to
identify any particular sign that firmly suggested a shift in the
winds, a selling out, a full-scale renunciation of the area's former
rebel self. This is, after all, a place where punk and post-punk grew
up alongside ex-hippies turned yuppies, and you could buy Doc Martens
right down the street from royal blue Stilton. Gay-friendly,
artist-tolerant, multicultural, old money--somehow a whole range of
"we are the new world" adjectives settled, more or less, on a way to
coexist in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   So when a sexy Indian restaurant and lounge threw open its fairy
tale-huge copper doors, its arrival wasn't surprising, and no
eyebrows were raised. The post-Spaceland club scene had begat night
crawlers of a different sort, those looking for down-tempo places to
linger before and after a show, when smoking and drinking on the
neighbors' lawns grew tired and predictable. The neighborhood knew
how to absorb them and their new haunt. It was adding a valet to the
mix that somehow cast this careful chemistry into a different realm.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A 'Destination' Spot</TE>
<TE>   Part of the neighborhood's allure has long been that it's off the
radar. Not only does one not blatantly advertise here. (Signage?
Lighting? Obvious bouncer? Heavens, no.) A true Silver Lake denizen
certainly doesn't need the help of someone ferrying his or her
vehicle into the night.</TE>
<TE>   Many residents pride themselves on knowing how to negotiate the
neighborhood's tangled hills and perplexing passes. They know the way
the streets flit in and out, repeat themselves. They know the
difference between a dead-end and a wide-open challenge. A valet,
however, suggests that you don't know. Valets cater to an outsider's
floating fear or impatience. And what their presence telegraphs to
the long-timer is that, yes, the neighborhood has officially moved
into the ranks of "destination" spots--and there may very well be no
way back off the map.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, over the last 10 years or so, many a eulogy for Silver
Lake has been exchanged over a muddy brew or a bottle of Bud,
lamenting the area's shift from hidden anachronism to hip curio. For
some, the tipping point came when some unspoken decree deemed that
one tattoo parlor wasn't enough--we'd try five. Or when corporate
coffee sneaked in under the cover of night. Or when boutiques selling
only halter tops and halter dresses not only opened up but thrived.
Or when new bars tried to pass as "old bars"--adding a touch of
Naugahyde and cigarette musk where there once was none.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first valet to set up a post in Silver Lake. A bar
and a restaurant or two have offered courtesy parking services within
the confines of their own lots. There are other valets that hire out
for special evenings. But there is something about this new one's
placement. It seems a bit pretentious--like a ball gown at a
rave--installed on a ragtag corner across the street from a medical
clinic and around the bend from a plain-wrap video mart.</TE>
<TE>   But then, perhaps it will remain and become part of the mix, even
as residents will it from consciousness. Over time, hill-dwelling
philosophers have turned a blind eye to eccentric silent-movie stars
as they moved in. Psychiatrists have ignored the jazz musicians. The
burlesque dancers, tattoo artists, garage bands and Hollywood
caterers have coexisted by applying equal measures of  "casting a
blind eye" and "extending the benefit of the doubt." The same
prescription, too, could be applied to the new valet, with all the
connotations of loss or change those responses might hold.</TE>
<TE>   " 'I think it's just great that we have an un-Silver Lake place in
Silver Lake!' enthuses a longtime resident/night crawler, as high on
the aroma of curry and coriander as he is entranced by the swank, dim
lounge and the trance mix. It makes him think Silver Lake has
arrived. "We need this place," he says, using the language of a city
where fine shades of distinction are expected: "It's kind of chic ...
as opposed to hip."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not so Good for Tips</TE>
<TE>   The valet himself might disagree. From his vantage, there probably
seems to be a chasm to cross. In this land of artistes, bohos and
drummers, the $3.50 service charge is taken literally: The first-date
chivalrous dig deep, counting the fee--"47 ... 48 ... 50! ... "--to
the penny.</TE>
<TE>   Others don't stop at all: Old American beaters covered with primer
circle the block again and again, trying their luck up in the hills.
Slipping neatly into the last parallel spot in the maze of hills is
like deep-sea fishing--Hemingway style, they'll tell you. It's as
grand and awe-inspiring as any fish tale.</TE>
<TE>   So until word-of-mouth and impatience with parking roulette seep
out across the region, some nights this valet will sit idly for long
patches. A five for his trouble buys a surprised and buoyant "Thank
you!" Six bills? A flirty, wooing invitation,  "Come back soon!" He
sees us in our hip thrift-store glory. Under his big umbrella,
perhaps he's a ferryman, luring us over to the generous land of the
chic.</TE>

<HD>Most Older Workers Plan to Keep Jobs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A large majority of workers over 45 plan to stay on the job into
their retirement years, with 80% saying most people can't afford to
quit work altogether, according to a survey by the AARP.</LD>
<LD>   The survey, to be released today along with the organization's
list of best companies for older employees, found that 69% of workers
said they would keep working in retirement.</LD>
<LD>   About three-quarters of those surveyed said money is one of the
major reasons they plan to continue working. But about the same
number said they enjoyed working and 84% said they would continue to
hold jobs even if they were financially set for life.</LD>
<TE>   "We're finding there's a lot more going on here than just the need
for money," said John Rother, AARP's policy director.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the figures gathered in the survey are similar to those
AARP has seen in earlier studies. But in one notable difference, 56%
of those surveyed say they needed to work to pay for health-care
costs for themselves and their families, up 15% from a survey done in
1985.</TE>
<TE>   The survey, conducted in May and June, is based on a national
sample of 1,500 people between the ages of 45 and 74.</TE>
<TE>   The survey, AARP officials said, points to the need for employers
to do more to attract and retain older workers. Such efforts are
highlighted in the group's awards to 15 employers.</TE>
<TE>   The employers receiving awards are ABN Amro North America,
Chicago; Baptist Health South Florida, Coral Gables, Fla.; Prudential
Financial Inc., Newark, N.J.; Howard University, Washington; Qualcomm
Inc., San Diego; Calibre Systems, Alexandria, Va.; Stanley Group,
Muscatine, Iowa; New York Life Insurance Co., New York; Hartford
Financial Services Group, Hartford, Conn.; Adecco Employment Service,
Melville, N.Y.; DaVita Inc., Torrance; Ultratech Stepper, San Jose;
Mitretek Systems, Falls Church, Va.; Aerospace Corp., El Segundo;
Principal Financial Group, Des Moines.</TE>

<HD>Deal Ends Boeing Workers' Walkout</HD>
<DH>Labor: Employees at the Pennsylvania plant are expected to
ratify the contract within a week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>About 1,400 striking Boeing Co. production workers were due to return
to work at a helicopter plant near Philadelphia on Sunday, after
their union and company management reached a tentative agreement,
both sides said.</LD>
<LD>   The breakthrough after an eight-day walkout at the facility in
Ridley Township, Pa., came Saturday after negotiators for the
Chicago-based aerospace company withdrew a proposal on work-rule
flexibility that workers said threatened their seniority rights,
union officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Members of United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement
Workers of America (UAW) Local 1069 were expected to hold a contract
ratification vote within a week.</LD>
<TE>   "I think this is as close to a fair and equitable contract as we
could have gotten," UAW Local 1069 President John DeFrancisco told
reporters after nearly five hours of negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   A Boeing hotline said UAW members would begin returning to work
for a Sunday night shift at the facility, which manufactures the
CH-47 Chinook helicopter and the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The plant, which employs 4,900 people, also is slated to produce
the RAH-66 Comanche helicopter, currently in the engineering and
design phase.</TE>
<TE>   UAW workers walked off their jobs early Sept. 14 after talks
deadlocked over seniority rights and Boeing demands for employee
contributions to rising health insurance premiums.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides met briefly with a federal mediator last week.</TE>
<TE>   But officials said progress came at the urging of two Pennsylvania
congressmen, Democratic Rep. Robert A. Brady and Republican Rep. Curt
Weldon, who warned that the strike could jeopardize government
contracts that were already vulnerable to cuts.</TE>

<HD>Deliberations Begin in Closely Watched Tobacco Suit</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ex-smoker's case against Philip Morris is the first
since a state Supreme Court ruling barred industry memos from
1988-'98 as evidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court jury is set to start deliberations today
in a closely watched case brought against tobacco giant Philip Morris
Cos. by an ex-smoker suffering from lung cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Closing arguments were delivered Friday in the suit filed by Betty
Bullock of Newport Beach, who began smoking in the 1950s at the age
of 17, and was diagnosed with cancer in February 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Bullock, who turns 64 today, primarily smoked Philip Morris'
Benson &amp; Hedges brand. She has accused Philip Morris of negligence,
fraud and making a defective product.</LD>
<TE>   The monthlong case is the first to be tried in California since a
state Supreme Court ruling that said that smokers cannot present
evidence of alleged deception based on industry documents created
between 1988 and 1998, when a legislative ban on product liability
suits against cigarette makers was in place. The ruling reduced only
slightly plaintiffs' arsenal of incriminating industry documents,
most of which were generated in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, legal and financial analysts are waiting to see if the
new ground rules can help cigarette makers end their losing streak in
California, where the three cases tried since the lawsuit ban was
lifted all ended in multimillion-dollar damage awards for for sick
smokers.</TE>
<TE>   Damages in the three cases, all now on appeal, totaled $153
million. One of the three cases produced the largest jury award ever
won by an individual smoker. Michael Piuze, the lawyer representing
Bullock, was attorney for former Marlboro smoker Richard Boeken in
June 2001, when a jury in Los Angeles County Superior Court ordered
Philip Morris to pay him $3 billion in punitive damages and $5
million in compensatory. The trial judge later pared the punitive
damages to $100 million, and Boeken, who suffered from lung cancer,
has since died.</TE>
<TE>   In his closing argument Friday in the Bullock case, Piuze
displayed blow-ups of internal memos that he said showed Philip
Morris had concealed the addictiveness of smoking, and had conspired
with its rivals to give addicted smokers such as Bullock "a
psychological crutch" to keep on smoking.</TE>
<TE>   One of the memos, written in 1969 by a Philip Morris researcher,
said: "Do we really want to tout cigarette smoke as a drug? It is, of
course ... "</TE>
<TE>   Another, written in 1972 by an official with the Tobacco
Institute, an industry group, boasted that cigarette makers had used
a "brilliantly conceived and executed" strategy of "creating doubt
about the health charge without actually denying it."</TE>
<TE>   "I represent the plaintiff is a drug addict. There's no two ways
about it," Piuze said. "The defendant is a drug dealer. And there's
no two ways about it."</TE>
<TE>   All addicted smokers like Bullock needed "was a little rationale,
a little psychological crutch," Piuze said. So "with lives in the
balance, they decided to create doubts about the health charge
without actually denying it." This, he said, is "the most classic
example of fraud" there is.</TE>
<TE>   But Philip Morris lawyer Peter Bleakley said that nothing the
company did induced Bullock to start or keep on smoking.</TE>
<TE>   "I acknowledge that Philip Morris made a lot of mistakes,"
Bleakley said. "I don't think there's any doubt about that now."</TE>
<TE>   But he called the company's dubious conduct a distraction from the
real issue of whether "this particular smoker in this case ... [is]
entitled to recover money."</TE>
<TE>   Even when Bullock took up smoking, "it was widely publicized ...
that cigarette smoking could cause lung cancer and other diseases,"
Bleakley said.</TE>
<TE>   She "knew that smoking was risky" but for years made no serious
effort to quit, "and when she did make a decision to quit, she did
quit even before" her cancer was diagnosed, Bleakley said.</TE>
<TE>   The jurors first will decide whether to award compensatory
damages. If they award damages and also find that Philip Morris
engaged in malicious conduct, a second phase of the trial to
determine punitive damages would follow.</TE>

<HD>Armor Maker to Face Complaint</HD>
<DH>Workplace: Labor board says DHB Industries may have fired
employees for considering a union.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The National Labor Relations Board plans to file a complaint against
DHB Industries Inc., which makes the body armor worn by U.S. soldiers
in Afghanistan, for firing employees who considered joining a union.</LD>
<LD>   "We made a determination that a substantial number of the charges
filed against the company were meritorious," said Jennifer
Burgess-Solomon, supervisory attorney at the Miami office of the
NLRB, an independent federal agency created in 1935 to investigate
and remedy unfair labor practices.</LD>
<LD>   A two-month probe of DHB's factory in Oakland Park, Fla., found
that the company illegally retaliated against union supporters by
firing three workers and threatening lower wages, a loss of benefits
and a plant shutdown, Burgess-Solomon said. The agency dismissed
company allegations that the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and
Textile Employees picketed illegally and threatened employee
representatives.</LD>
<TE>   The filing of a complaint against the company, whose shares have
lost half their value this year amid accusations by workers that
defective vests were sold, would prompt a hearing by an
administrative law judge. The judge could reinstate the workers with
back pay, order the company to halt illegal practices and require
signs be posted to explain workers' rights.</TE>
<TE>   Dawn Schlegel, DHB's chief financial officer, said the company
would prevail against any NLRB action. "We feel the complaint is
unfounded," she said.</TE>
<TE>   DHB, which was informed of the NLRB's decision last week, said in
a statement Friday that the union stopped a plan to have employees
vote on representation. The announcement helped spur a 24% surge in
shares to $2.55 on American Stock Exchange trading of 741,700 shares,
triple their three-month daily trading average.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pleased that the union has recognized what we have always
known: that our employees do not want this union," the company
statement said on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Cooper, an organizer with the union, said the group hasn't
canceled a vote on representation. The union asked the NLRB to delay
a vote because of concerns it wouldn't be fair. He said about 180 of
the 400 workers at the company's Point Blank Armor unit in Florida
have approached the union about joining.</TE>
<TE>   "It's understandable that a union wouldn't want to go forward with
an election where the idea of a free choice for the workers has been
eroded," said William Gould, chairman of the NLRB from 1994 to 1998
and now a professor of labor law at Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   DHB, founded by Chief Executive David H. Brooks, could avert an
administrative law judge hearing by reaching a settlement with the
union. Cooper, the union representative, said "the chances are slim
to none" for such a settlement. He said no talks have taken place and
none are scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   The union, which brought the case to the attention of the labor
board, also asked U.S. lawmakers to investigate working conditions
that it said included limited access to drinking water inside the
plant, temperatures of more than 100 degrees, two toilets for almost
400 employees, one sick day per year and limited health-care
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Ten members of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee signed a
letter to the company in July expressing concern about the working
conditions at the factory, which is part of DHB's Point Blank unit.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which values its contract to make body armor for the
U.S. military at more than $350 million, last week settled a dispute
with the New York City Police Department over the reliability of the
company's vests.</TE>
<TE>   The department commissioned tests of the bulletproof vests after a
complaint, alleging defective ones were issued, was filed with a
state labor agency by the Patrolmen's Benevolent Assn. in February.</TE>

<HD>Eisner to Assure Board That Disney Is on Track</HD>
<DH>Media: CEO is under pressure as stock price sags. Directors
also are expected to consider governance changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Michael Eisner has traveled from
coast to coast in recent days trying to reassure edgy investors and
skeptical analysts that his company is on the mend.</LD>
<LD>   Now Eisner must take that same message to his most important
audience: the company's board of directors, some of whom have grown
increasingly restless over the slide in Disney's stock price and its
lackluster earnings performance.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Disney's directors will meet at the company's Burbank
headquarters to consider a number of issues, including the company's
long-range goals, its governance and responsiveness to shareholder
concerns.</LD>
<TE>   At the top of the agenda is how the board should be structured and
who should serve. Disney's board has been criticized by investors
over the years as an undemanding group unwilling to challenge Eisner.</TE>
<TE>   The directors are expected to consider proposals to change the
composition of key board committees, redefine what constitutes an
"independent" board member and shrink the size of the 16-member
board, according to sources close to the board. Several long-serving
board members may step down as a result of the changes, including
Oscar-winning actor Sidney Poitier.</TE>
<TE>   The board also will review a detailed five-year plan for
rejuvenating some of Disney's struggling businesses, including its
ABC television network, the sources said. The plan will outline
financial targets the company hopes to achieve at its various
divisions.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting comes at a delicate juncture for Eisner, who has led
Disney since 1984. Although the 60-year-old executive appears secure
in his job, his performance has come under fire in recent months as
the company's stock has sagged to levels not seen since the
mid-1990s. Disney's stock rose 43 cents Friday to $15.24 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The stock price has heightened tension between Eisner and key
board members Stanley Gold and Roy Disney, one of the company's
largest individual shareholders. They are pressuring Eisner to move
more decisively to turn around key divisions, such as ABC, and to
finally clarify his succession plans--a topic that also could surface
at Tuesday's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Additional pressure has come from some institutional investors,
who have complained openly about Disney's performance and its board.</TE>
<TE>   Disney disclosed last month that four of its independent board
members had relatives who were employed by Disney or a related
company in the last year. The practice might not be allowed under
rules proposed by the NYSE. To comply with the new rules, Disney
would be required to change the makeup of key committees to ensure
that only independent directors serve on a board's nominating,
compensation and audit committees.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner has taken several steps this year to improve the image of
Disney's board, including hiring respected corporate-governance
expert Ira Millstein and adopting a new policy of barring its auditor
from doing consulting work. Last month, Eisner vowed to shrink the
size of the board.</TE>
<TE>   Similar reforms are occurring across corporate America as
shareholders push for boards to become more accountable after
corporate scandals at such companies as Tyco International Ltd.,
WorldCom Inc. and Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Some institutional shareholders are pressing Disney to do more.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting last week in New York, Providence Capital, a New York
investment banking firm headed by corporate-governance activist
Herbert Denton, called on Disney's board to detail a succession plan
for Eisner, separate the office of chairman and CEO and solicit
director nominees from major institutional shareholders, among other
proposals.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear, however, how much weight the recommendations carry.
Providence Capital is said to own fewer than 2,000 shares of Disney
and did not say who attended the meeting or disclose how many shares
were represented. Prudential Securities analyst Katherine Styponias,
who was at the meeting, said about 60 people attended in person or by
phone.</TE>
<TE>   "We view the recommendations that came out of this meeting as
reasonable and could help significantly improve sentiment in the
stock," Styponias wrote in a report.</TE>
<TE>   Disney said it welcomed input from all shareholders and had no
comment on the upcoming meeting.</TE>
<TE>   In its cross-country meetings, Disney management has emphasized
that the company will rebound when the economy improves and will
benefit from its long-term investments in its core businesses, such
as the Disney Channel, ESPN and theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   Disney executives have pointed to some encouraging signs of late.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's fall lineup, for example, got off to a good start last week
when two new sitcoms easily won their time slots in overall viewing
and among adults ages 18 to 49, the key demographic for advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   The shows, however, were mainly up against reruns on other
networks that will debut their schedules this week.</TE>
<TE>   The Disney film studio also had a strong opening for the Mel
Gibson movie "Signs," which has produced more than $214 million at
the box office. And the Disney/Pixar Animation Studios film
"Monsters, Inc." set a one-day sales record of 5 million DVDs and
videos on its first day of release, the studios reported Wednesday.
The one-day figure breaks the previous record of 4.5 million units
set by Disney's "The Lion King."</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts say any full recovery could take time.</TE>
<TE>   "They are in a rebuilding mode," said Tom Wolzien of Sanford C.
Bernstein &amp; Co. "They were dealt a bad hand in terms of the
economy....On the other hand, they dealt themselves a difficult hand
with ABC."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Jim Bates contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Branches Still Core of Bank of America</HD>
<DH>Q&amp;A: Chief Financial Officer James Hance says the company
plans to defend and expand key consumer franchises.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes, it pays to be a bit old-fashioned.</LD>
<LD>   Deregulation of the financial services industry allowed Bank of
America Corp. to take on the likes of Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan
Chase &amp; Co. in areas such as securities underwriting and brokerage
services. But the core business of the Charlotte, N.C., bank remains
plain old branch banking.</LD>
<LD>   That retail business has been a bulwark in these tricky times,
generating two-thirds of BofA's revenue. As Americans flee the
crumbling stock market, money has flowed from risky investments to
the safety of bank accounts. And as interest rates have plunged to
40-year lows, mortgage lending has boomed.</LD>
<TE>   To be sure, BofA--formed by the 1998 merger of NationsBank Corp.
and San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corp.--has lost big on loans to
telecommunications and cable companies, as well as to Latin American
governments. But the recent woes of other mega-banks are worse.</TE>
<TE>   In the crucial California market, meanwhile, BofA faces stiff
competition both from old rivals such as Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and new
ones such as Citigroup, which is buying California Federal Bank
parent Golden State Bancorp Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, BofA's chief financial officer, James H. Hance, talked
about the state of the banking industry in an interview with The
Times. Here are some excerpts:</TE>
<TE>   Question: For some time you have been cutting back on the number
of big corporate loans on your books and emphasizing that you prefer
borrowers who also used your investment banking and other services.
Now regulators are taking a tough look at banks for improperly tying
these services together. Is this going to be a problem?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: The regulators are very sensitive to tying, but Bank of
America is legally complying with the rules, no question about it.
The market is moving toward the universal bank model, but
interestingly it's customer-driven, where a customer is looking for a
better value across a whole range of services--treasury services,
lending, underwriting, whatever. What you can't do is go to a
customer--and I'm simplifying it--and say: "I will give you a loan if
you give me X amount of fee business and investment banking," or
something like that.</TE>
<TE>   If a customer comes to you and says, "I'm going to give you all
this business and we'll think about credit and all the rest of this
stuff," then you can respond to him. But you've made no demands on
them, so there's a big difference there.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You say you'll defend and expand key consumer franchises like
California with a "laser-like" refocusing to offer customers more
convenience and service. How much have you grown recently and what
are your growth plans?</TE>
<TE>   A: One of the easy statistics we talk about is that in the first
six months of this year, we added 240,000 net new checking accounts
nationwide. Last year, all year, we added 191,000. This year, we're
on pace for a goal of 550,000. Today we have 4,300 U.S. banking
centers, more or less, and we're going to add to that by 600 over
three years. And they're going to be primarily, almost entirely, in
our top 25 markets, L.A. of course being one of the biggest. And
that's a commitment of about $450 million a year, about $2
million-plus per branch. So it's a sizable commitment to expand our
retail franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Back in 1999, fewer than 1% of your loans were nonperforming,
or bad, loans. But nonperformers reached 1.45% of your total loans
last quarter. Meanwhile, we keep hearing about new problems at
companies and the economic recovery looks shaky. When's it going to
turn around?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think the nonperforming loans are going to go up a little bit
[because companies are continuing to struggle]. The loss rates,
though, are coming down. And the reason is that the really highly
leveraged problem companies have more or less worked through the
system. If it weren't for the fact that it's still not clear the
economy is recovering--and incidentally we think it has all the signs
of recovery with the exception of the equity markets--we would be
more comfortable in believing that our credit losses have peaked.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Sub-prime lending has been back in the news in a negative way,
with First Alliance Corp. and Citigroup settling big FTC predatory
lending cases. Last year, Bank of America sold off its business that
catered to these risky borrowers, saying it was too unpredictable.
Can you explain what that meant?</TE>
<TE>   A: We predominantly were buying sub-prime real estate loans from
someone else who was originating them--the borrowers really weren't
our customers and we didn't have a direct relationship with them. So
you leave yourself susceptible to who the originator is ... and in
the sub-prime world that's dangerous, because you don't know what
[the loan originator] is committing to. Second, the profit margin is
inherently reduced because the originator gets some of it. And third,
the loss rates on sub-prime in general are very volatile and very
subject to the economy. That business was profitable for us when we
sold it. But the return wasn't at the level we wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What's your view of the housing markets and the current high
prices?</TE>
<TE>   A: Here in Los Angeles, as I understand it, there's a woeful
shortage of houses. That what they tell me--a huge housing shortage
to the point where it's inhibiting growth. What would make us
concerned about mortgage loss rates would be a double-dip recession
or a consumer meltdown, and that could potentially lead to lower real
estate prices and certainly lead to stress on payment of principal
and interest.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How serious is the prospect of another slowdown?</TE>
<TE>   A: We actually don't think we're going to see a double-dip
recession. We don't think the consumer will spend a whole lot more,
but we think spending will just continue [at an steady pace]. And
sooner or later that demand will carry over into the middle-size
businesses, and you'll start to see some growth. Because right now
they're not building inventories, and their demand for loans is very
low. And we need that as a leading indicator before the economy picks
up some.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Anyone ever tell you they find the video ads on your ATMs
annoying?</TE>
<TE>   A: We have had that feedback indeed. I think [the advertising
program] is going to be modified. It's not a [significant] revenue
stream--it was supposed to be a customer convenience. We'll see.</TE>

<HD>Security Problems</HD>
<DH>For many firms in the industry, heightened interest has not
translated to financial gains</DH>

<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the stock markets reopened after terrorists struck America's
financial center on Sept. 11, a few investors showed their patriotism
by buying shares in such hard-hit companies as airlines and hotel
firms.</LD>
<LD>   Others demonstrated a more opportunistic approach: They snapped up
stocks in firms selling airport bomb-detection gear, data-recovery
services and biometric systems used to verify identities through
fingerprints or facial characteristics.</LD>
<LD>   A year later, only the most obvious morning-after plays proved
lucrative. The stock price of InVision Technologies Inc., the biggest
maker of government-certified bomb scanners, has multiplied tenfold,
from $3.04 the week before the attacks to $30.85 on Friday. That jump
made Newark, Calif.-based InVision one of the biggest Nasdaq market
gainers over the last 12 months.</LD>
<TE>   L-3 Communications Holdings Inc., whose vast product line includes
similar bomb-detection equipment, has nearly doubled in market value.
Its stock price has soared from $31.50 to $54.95 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   But the rest of the security technology field has performed
surprisingly poorly in sales, profits and stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   Industry executives and analysts cite a host of reasons for the
divergence. Chief among them are the lingering economic doldrums and
the stutter-step of getting new mandates and funding from government
bureaucracies.</TE>
<TE>   Some of today's laggards still may reap benefits, said InVision
Chief Executive Sergio Magistri, who knows as well as anyone the
benefits of patience.</TE>
<TE>   "From a business point of view, Sept. 11 opened up the door for a
new space called homeland security," Magistri said. "Over the next
two to four years, we will define this new industry, and we will sort
out who is performing and who is not. There will be a constant
adjustment, where the market will reward winners."</TE>
<TE>   For InVision, the aviation-security bills passed by Congress and
orders from the federal government have rewarded more than a decade
of work.</TE>
<TE>   InVision spun off from a medical equipment maker in 1990 after
terrorists bombed Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw a need for a better explosive-detection technology, and we
saw the right legislative framework in Washington," Magistri said.</TE>
<TE>   It took four years and a $30-million investment before InVision
won federal certification for its car-size computer tomography
machines, which use a process similar to hospital CT scanners to
check for the outlines and density of all types of explosives inside
luggage.</TE>
<TE>   Even after that, the deployment moved in fits and starts. Although
the government demanded seven years ago that checked luggage be
screened, little money was appropriated and most luggage continued to
go unchecked.</TE>
<TE>   Before the attacks, InVision's biggest challenge was holding on to
staff members who were tempted to join technology start-ups during
the dot-com boom. That was even tougher as InVision's sales lost
ground after rival L-3 won certification for its machine.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, when Congress demanded that airports get more of
the machines made by InVision and L-3, the challenge has been keeping
up with orders.</TE>
<TE>   InVision has more than doubled its full-time and temporary work
force to 478 from 204 and hired a manufacturing contractor as its
sales nearly quadrupled in the most recent quarter, to $68.4 million.
Profit in the April-to-June period ballooned to $9.6 million from
$144,000 a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Still, InVision's dealings with the government haven't been ideal.</TE>
<TE>   "The delay between the legislation and our first round of orders
was two to three months," Magistri said. "It took another two to
three months until we could get to a level where we could push
forward with our supply chain."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, some airports asked for more time to install and
incorporate InVision and L-3 machines into their operations. A Senate
panel voted Thursday to extend the deadline on luggage screening by a
year, until the end of 2003. That sent InVision shares down 12% in a
day, to $29.85.</TE>
<TE>   Only slightly less apparent than the need for tighter airport
security after the Sept. 11 attacks was the need for better systems
to preserve business records in the event of a catastrophe.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, the leaders in the field were IBM Corp., SunGard Data
Systems Inc. and Comdisco Inc., which was in bankruptcy proceedings.
The anticipated spike in business prompted a bidding war for
Comdisco's assets between SunGard and Hewlett-Packard Co. SunGard
won.</TE>
<TE>   Yet total revenue at the combined business was virtually the same
in the first half of 2002 as it had been a year earlier. SunGard
shares rose above $35 this spring, but since then they have tumbled,
closing Friday at $20.93 on the New York Stock Exchange, about where
they were before the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   After a disaster, "there's almost always a rise in interest and
awareness," said SunGard spokeswoman Judith Eckles. "But that doesn't
always translate into increased business."</TE>
<TE>   IBM declined to comment on its sales since the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Prudential Securities analyst Bryan Keane said disaster-recovery
spending will recover. He believes that, in the long term, the
business will grow 8% to 10% annually.</TE>
<TE>   If so, that would be a substantial improvement over this last
year.</TE>
<TE>   As a percentage of total information technology spending by big
companies, disaster expenditures have declined since Sept. 11,
according to a Gartner Inc. research study this month that blamed the
sour economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Few enterprises have significantly increased their budgets for
business continuity," the Gartner analysts wrote. "An expected
increase in spending hasn't occurred."</TE>
<TE>   Spending on electronic security also has changed little, and the
federal office of cyberspace security imposed no new requirements
last week in a long-awaited report.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the greatest expectations--and biggest
disappointments--have been at biometrics firms.</TE>
<TE>   Fingerprint reading, the most accepted of the techniques, has made
some headway. Identix Inc., a leader in the industry, has more than
100 readers installed at airports that check employees against a law
enforcement database. Before the attacks, it had fewer than 20.</TE>
<TE>   But facial recognition systems haven't been deployed much beyond
some controversial airport trials.</TE>
<TE>   Identix bought facial recognition firm Visionics Corp. this year
to expand its offerings, but sales have been slipping. Last month,
Identix said it expects to lose money at least until next summer.</TE>
<TE>   Identix stock jumped from $3.80 before the terrorist attacks to
above $15 but has sunk back to close at $5.77 on Friday in Nasdaq
trading.</TE>
<TE>   Company spokesman Meir Kahtan said that deploying biometric
technology takes longer than investors expect. First, policymakers
must learn about the possibilities and write the laws. Then there are
requests for the trials that must be conducted before machines are
permanently installed.</TE>
<TE>   "The general population only sees the final implementation,"
Kahtan said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said there have been important early steps, including a
requirement that visas include biometric information starting in 2004
and a test project at the Defense Department that uses biometrics to
restrict access to buildings and computerized information.</TE>
<TE>   After the government programs get more momentum, private companies
will adopt similar policies, said International Biometric Group
partner Raj Nanavati, whose consulting firm sees industry revenue
increasing to $603 million this year from $524 million in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But more dramatic changes will be spurred only by another crisis,
many fear.</TE>
<TE>   "It amazes me how the federal government prepares for the last
threat," said analyst Brian Ruttenbur of Morgan Keegan. "We throw all
this money at airports, and we're checking less than 2% of the cargo
and trucks coming into the country. We haven't done anything but
study that problem."</TE>
<TE>   Even L-3 Communications CEO Frank Lanza, whose company has
benefited substantially from the focus on aviation, calls the current
system a mess.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no central funding or strategy in this country yet for
what we have to protect," Lanza said. "Until we get a homeland
security department with someone competent to run it and a budget to
go with, you're not going to get much happening except fragmented
little things. I think it will happen eventually, but it's going to
take a wake-up call again."</TE>

<HD>Junk Bond Buyouts Reemerging as Deals Get Bigger</HD>
<DH>Acquisitions: A financing strategy that was dominant in the
1980s could be making a comeback.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENA AUBIN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>As the trademark deal of the 1980s, the junk bond buyout was the
weapon used for raids on corporate giants. Now, it looks poised to
make a comeback as financiers seek funding for bigger, costlier
targets.</LD>
<LD>   A $268-million junk bond sale last week by ConAgra Foods Inc. unit
Swift &amp; Co., part of the financing for a $1.4-billion leveraged
buyout of the company, could be the harbinger of a raft of such deals
to tap the recovering junk bond market, experts say.</LD>
<LD>   "The 'leverage' in leveraged buyouts has been fairly nonexistent,"
said Jesse Reyes, vice president for research firm Venture Economics.</LD>
<TE>   "As the high-yield market tends to open up," he said, "I think
you'll be seeing a lot more of these transactions."</TE>
<TE>   In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors buy a company with
borrowed money--a mix of loans and bonds--using the company's assets
as collateral. The use of debt allows investors to take over a
company with little of their own capital, with the potential for
stunning returns.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, however, high share prices kept leveraged buyouts
out of the biggest corporate acquisitions, which were financed with
stock rather than debt.</TE>
<TE>   "Prices were too high for leveraged-buyout sponsors to put money
to work in large transactions involving publicly held companies,"
said Chris Donnelly, a director at Standard &amp; Poor's PMD, which
tracks leveraged lending. LBO sponsors instead targeted small
companies or divisions, and those deals were not large enough to
justify a bond sale, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "Deals were small enough so they would be financed in the bank
loan market," Donnelly said. "You're seeing some extraordinarily
large transactions announced again."</TE>
<TE>   Qwest Communications International Inc.'s phone book unit QwestDex
plans to sell up to $1 billion in junk bonds to help pay for its
$7.05-billion takeover by two buyout firms. That deal would be the
largest since Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s $31.4-billion buyout of
RJR Nabisco in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   As leveraged buyout sponsors circle bigger targets, the dollar
volume of deals has surged. Some 109 deals totaling $15.7 billion
have been completed or announced this year, compared with 138 deals
totaling $9.3 billion in the same period last year, according to
Thomson Financial.</TE>
<TE>   Leveraged buyout activity was muted last year partly because of
the recession, said Morton Pierce, head of the mergers and
acquisitions group at Dewey Ballantine in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Banks are very reluctant to lend money when the economic climate
is not very good and subordinated-debt buyers are more reluctant to
buy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lean times recently have helped leveraged buyout sponsors get back
in the game for large deals. Financially strapped companies are
putting assets on the block, sometimes at knockdown prices, while
conglomerates are selling off their weaker pieces. Leveraged buyout
firms also are working together so they can do bigger deals.</TE>
<TE>   British-based drinks firm Diageo in July sold its U.S. hamburger
chain Burger King for $2.26 billion to Texas Pacific Group, Bain
Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners. Burger King is expected
to issue high-yield bonds to help pay for the buyout.</TE>
<TE>   This type of deal uses far less debt than in the no-holds-barred
1980s. LBO firms on average fund their deals with about 62% debt,
compared with 93% in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   At first blush, conditions in the high-yield market do not appear
favorable for LBO financings. Investors have become edgier about
taking on risk after a summer of accounting scandals and bankruptcies
such as those of telecom giant WorldCom Inc. and cable firm Adelphia
Communications Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Yet junk bonds are showing some signs of a turnaround. Yields on
the bonds, which move in the opposite direction of price, have fallen
to an average of 13% from 13.5% a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   Investors also are returning to the sector, pumping a net $2
billion into junk bond mutual funds over the last three weeks,
according to AMG Data Services.</TE>
<TE>   "The [LBO] deals we see in market are the first indication that
once again sponsored transactions do have access to the capital
markets," said Edward Mally, head of high-yield research at CIBC
World Markets.</TE>
<TE>   LBOs could trigger significant bond issuance, experts say, if the
high-yield market regains strength. "If it's healthy," S&amp;P's Donnelly
said, "the sky's the limit."</TE>

<HD>Kazaa Being Upgraded by Sharman Networks</HD>
<DH>File-sharing: Changes would hinder attempts by labels and
studios to introduce bogus versions of songs and films.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In its first major upgrade, the Kazaa online file-sharing network is
taking steps to blunt some of the tactics that record companies and
Hollywood studios have used to deter Kazaa users from copying songs
and movies.</LD>
<LD>   Sharman Networks, a privately held firm based on the South Pacific
island of Vanuatu that develops the Kazaa software, is expected to
begin distributing a new version of the program today. The changes
include a new set of protections against bogus or corrupted files and
viruses.</LD>
<LD>   File-sharing networks let users search for and copy files on one
another's computers for free, typically without the permission of the
copyright owner. In lawsuits against two early file-sharing systems,
federal courts have ruled that this type of large-scale copying
violates copyrights.</LD>
<TE>   The major Hollywood studios, record companies and music publishers
have sued Sharman Networks, along with the companies behind the
Morpheus and Grokster networks, in federal court in Los Angeles,
arguing that they contribute to the same kind of wholesale copyright
infringement.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to suing, some entertainment companies have tried to
discourage piracy by flooding Kazaa and other file-sharing networks
with bogus versions of popular songs and films.</TE>
<TE>   The new version of Kazaa would undermine that practice by letting
users rate the integrity of the files made available for copying,
enabling the first people to download a file to vouch for its quality
or declare it a spoof.</TE>
<TE>   The upgrade also offers to scan for viruses when users sign on or
download files, addressing another major concern among users. In
addition, it rewards users who rate files and actively offer material
for copying by enabling them to download popular songs, movies, games
and software more rapidly than other users.</TE>
<TE>   Like other file-sharing networks, Kazaa has added several features
that don't involve copyright infringement, such as links to
authorized downloads and a Web browser. The moves add weight to the
companies' claims that their technology has substantial legitimate
use, a potential defense in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Spokeswoman Kelly Larabee said these improvements were in the
works before Sharman Networks was sued, adding that the company is
"fortifying the software because we believe we'll be victorious in
the end." But Russell Frackman, a Los Angeles attorney representing
the record companies against Sharman, said no amount of tweaking
could save "a system that's infringing and is mostly used for
infringing."</TE>

<HD>Debtors Hide Millions in Homes</HD>
<DH>Bankruptcy: Lawmakers seek legislation to curb alleged
abuses of the 'homestead exemption.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOCA RATON, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Executives and celebrities have long poured millions into magnificent
estates in Florida and a few other states, knowing that if they file
for bankruptcy their grand homes can't be touched.</LD>
<LD>   But with the recent string of corporate scandals, some disgraced
executives might not be able to take advantage of such provisions
much longer.</LD>
<LD>   Tired of millionaires taking advantage of liberal bankruptcy laws,
U.S. lawmakers are pursuing legislation to curb alleged abuses of the
so-called homestead exemption. One provision would require a person
to live in a home for 40 months to claim the exemption.</LD>
<TE>   "The goal is if some famous person moves to Florida and buys a
huge home, you can force them involuntarily into bankruptcy and they
won't get to keep the house," said University of Florida law
professor Jeffrey Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Under the legislation, if someone such as ousted WorldCom Inc.
Chief Financial Officer Scott D. Sullivan were to declare bankruptcy,
he could not keep the lavish $15-million estate, complete with movie
theater and six Jacuzzis, that he is building in Boca Raton. Sullivan
was arrested last month on charges of falsifying the books by more
than $3.8 billion; he used the home as collateral for his $10-million
bail.</TE>
<TE>   Florida, Texas, Iowa, Kansas and South Dakota have unlimited
homestead exemptions that allow people who declare bankruptcy to keep
their homes while creditors scramble to seize everything else.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said the vast majority of the nearly 1.5 million people
who file for personal bankruptcy each year have homes valued at less
than $125,000. Attorney Stuart Young said new restrictions could hurt
people who need protection, such as retirees who become overwhelmed
with medical bills or college students who run up too much credit
card debt.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.) who has been pushing for reforms, said
that though people have been abusing the system for years, the Enron
Corp. debacle has heightened the concerns. Authorities are trying to
seize millions in assets from Enron executives.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's rules were derived from its past as a Spanish possession
and were designed about a century ago to lure people to its
mosquito-infested, steamy climate.</TE>
<TE>   "The concept was even if you owe debts, it wasn't responsible to
make you homeless, so the family was protected even if the dad was a
drunkard or a gambler," said G. Ray Warner, resident scholar at the
American Bankruptcy Institute and a law professor at the University
of Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   With Florida's population booming, the rules long ago lost their
original purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate raider Paul Bilzerian walked away from $300 million in
debts while keeping a $5-million Florida mansion, despite a
conviction on fraud charges and a 13-month prison sentence in the
1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Actor Burt Reynolds declared bankruptcy in 1996, but creditors
could not touch Valhalla, his $2.5-million estate in Hobe Sound. O.J.
Simpson used the rules to exempt his home from the $33.5-million
civil verdict against him over the slayings of his ex-wife and her
friend.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin Warner, a one-time ambassador to Switzerland, bought a
Florida horse farm while seeking protection from $300 million in debt
after his Ohio-based bank failed in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Other disgraced executives have homes in Florida and Texas but
have not filed for bankruptcy. They include former Tyco International
Chief Executive L. Dennis Kozlowski, who is accused of using a
$19-million no-interest loan from his firm to pay for his personal
palace in Boca Raton.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even if the laws are amended, experts said the wealthy will
find ways to protect their assets.</TE>
<TE>   "The sophisticated debtors are going to move it out of the
country, to an account in the Caymans, for example, or hide it in
some other way," Warner, the law professor, said.</TE>

<HD>Peregrine Systems Files for Chapter 11</HD>
<DH>Software: The maker of business management programs says it
will also sue Arthur Andersen over its accounting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of struggling to shed its financial and legal woes, San
Diego-based software company Peregrine Systems Inc. filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection Sunday and said it would sue accounting firm
Arthur Andersen for more than $250 million.</LD>
<LD>   Peregrine--whose chairman is John J. Moores, owner of the San
Diego Padres--blames its failure on Arthur Andersen, which it accuses
of engaging in fraud, corporate negligence and failure in its
auditing and accounting duties.</LD>
<LD>   In a bid for help, Peregrine also said it would turn to Moores'
former company, Houston-based BMC Software Inc., which has agreed to
buy Peregrine's Remedy unit for $350 million. Remedy is a leading
maker of software that identifies and fixes glitches in corporate
computer networks.</LD>
<TE>   Peregrine said it expected to file the suit against Arthur
Andersen LLP, Arthur Andersen Germany, Arthur Andersen Worldwide and
Daniel Stulac, the auditor on the account, in San Diego Superior
Court today.</TE>
<TE>   Stulac could not be reached for comment. Arthur Andersen officials
scoffed at the news Sunday, claiming that Peregrine's claims lacked
merit.</TE>
<TE>   "This looks, smells and tastes like a hysterical board of
directors looking for a scapegoat to cover up their failures and the
failures of their handpicked executives," said Patrick Dorton,
spokesman for Arthur Andersen. "This is really outrageous, even in
this season of blaming the auditors."</TE>
<TE>   Dorton said the auditing firm, which had not seen a copy of the
pending lawsuit as of late Sunday, would "respond accordingly" after
the litigation was filed.</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine's bankruptcy filing, which was filed in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Delaware, is the latest chapter in the saga of a software
company that has ridden both the highs and lows of the dot-com boom.</TE>
<TE>   The once-aggressive e-commerce business started out by making
software that tracks a company's technical infrastructure. By 1998,
Peregrine had begun to branch out and went on a buying spree,
snapping up 12 companies over four years and spending billions of
dollars in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine's downhill slide started as far back as 2000--the year,
executives said Sunday, that its financial statements could no longer
be relied upon.</TE>
<TE>   That year, signs emerged that the technology bubble could not be
sustained and that the economy was headed for a slowdown. Dot-com
companies began to go under, unable to attract enough paying
consumers to its Web-based businesses. That dragged down sales of
everything from computers that serve up Web pages to Internet
infrastructure gear such as routers and switches.</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine is "in the same crunch as everybody else," said Tim
Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a technology consulting
firm in Silicon Valley. "The industry itself has been hit hard."</TE>
<TE>   But Peregrine has had an added problem, Bajarin noted: its
accounting.</TE>
<TE>   This past spring, the company acknowledged that it had launched an
internal investigation into "potential accounting inaccuracies" and
fired Arthur Andersen as its auditor.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting firm KPMG, hired to fill the spot, later discovered
that Peregrine's revenue had been inflated, and the company said it
would erase nearly $100 million in sales from the previous three
years--much of it generated from software deals made through
partners, consultants and retailers when products were returned.</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine eventually fired KPMG, saying that $35 million in
revenue that had to be restated was drawn from sales through KPMG's
former consulting unit. Peregrine said keeping KPMG, which had spun
off its consulting arm in 2001, would clash with U.S. auditor
independence rules. KPMG, which insisted it didn't know about the
sales until after it was hired, sent a letter to the Securities and
Exchange Commission alleging that Peregrine may have committed fraud.</TE>
<TE>   In late May, the SEC launched a formal probe into the company's
accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of the turmoil, Steve Gardner stepped down as
chairman and chief executive of Peregrine, and Matt Gless resigned as
chief financial officer and executive vice president of finance. Gary
Greenfield, formerly president and CEO of the e-business development
company Merant, replaced Gardner as chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Explaining the need to file for Chapter 11 protection, Greenfield
said Sunday: "We have recognized a big responsibility to our
creditors, and we wanted to find the best way to fulfill our
obligations."</TE>
<TE>   Moores, Peregrine's chairman, couldn't be reached for comment
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   One of America's wealthiest men, Moores is a software guru who
made much of his initial wealth in real estate and as founder of BMC
Software, a document-management firm. He left BMC's board in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   A longtime baseball fan, Moores bought the Padres in December
1994, amid what club officials had described as the triple whammy of
baseball's labor dispute, the Southern California recession and the
community perception that the previous owners had not been fully
committed to the franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone gets a historical footnote, and I suspect mine will be
that I was the only person ever to buy a baseball team in the middle
of a strike," Moores told The Times in an earlier interview.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1980s, Moores had become a well-known figure among San
Diego's tech community. He joined Peregrine's board in March 1989 and
held the position of chairman from March 1990 to July 2000. He
rejoined the company when Gardner stepped down.</TE>
<TE>   Since joining Peregrine, Moores and Greenfield have tried to
curtail the company's troubles by spinning off or selling many of its
businesses. Its core focus is to remain its tracking software, which
customers use to manage technology resources and other assets.</TE>

<HD>Software to Channel Films From PCs to TVs</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: BroadQ product will use Sony's PlayStation 2
to show downloaded files via digital home network.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY and ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As media companies start piping music and movies through the
Internet, their wares reach millions of personal computers--but few
of the living room stereos and TV sets most people turn to for
entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   Those companies--including Vivendi Universal and Warner
Bros.--count on the Internet to be the next-generation conduit for
digital entertainment on demand. But without a simple path to the
living room, music and movies from the Web may never find their way
to mainstream audiences.</LD>
<LD>   Some computer and electronics companies have tried to bridge that
gap with specialized devices that connect computers to home
entertainment gear, but consumers have shown little interest. Nor has
there been much demand for TVs and receivers that hook directly to
the Net.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the single biggest technical issue facing Hollywood:
Moving the content off the PC and into the living room, where people
are used to having their entertainment," said P.J. McNealy, an
analyst with GartnerG2.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest effort, an Austin, Texas, company is trying to
bridge the gap by piggy-backing on Sony Corp.'s popular PlayStation 2
game console, which is plugged into 40 million TV sets worldwide. New
software by BroadQ connects a PS2 console to a PC through a digital
home network, enabling the box to play MP3 files, digital movies and
TV shows stored on the PC.</TE>
<TE>   This approach may not fare any better with consumers than previous
attempts to unlock entertainment from the PC, but it's a harbinger of
things to come as Sony and Microsoft Corp. tinker with ways to expand
their game consoles into digital media centers. It's also a preview
of the kinds of products that several large consumer-electronics
companies plan to roll out--devices that can ferry all kinds of
entertainment around the home through high-speed wireless digital
networks.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is a home where music, games and movies travel freely
from room to room, letting consumers enjoy them on whatever screen
and speakers are nearby. Microsoft, for example, added storage and
Internet capability to its Xbox game console with the idea that
consumers eventually will want to use it for all sorts of
entertainment both inside and out of the home.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say BroadQ is jumping the gun. Most consumers aren't
interested in such a complicated solution, they say, and the next
generation of game machines will be better equipped for the job.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something the average consumer isn't going to do,"
McNealy said. "This requires a high level of computer
sophistication."</TE>
<TE>   The same hurdle has tripped up previous efforts to integrate PCs
into home entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway Inc., Dell Computer Corp., Compaq Computer Corp. and
Hewlett-Packard Co., among others, have tried in recent years to sell
audio-visual gear that piped programming from a computer or the
Internet to TV sets and stereos. But these devices worked only in
homes with digital networks--typically, the kind that required
consumers to run high-capacity wires from room to room.</TE>
<TE>   Only about 6% of U.S. homes have any kind of digital network,
according to Parks Associates, a Dallas market research and
consulting company. With too many competing technologies and not
enough compelling programming, consumer electronics companies have
been reluctant to push home networking, said Kurt Scherf, vice
president of research at Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Many consumers have come up with a simple alternative to home
networks: They record digital music or movies onto CDs or DVDs, then
carry the discs from their computers to their living-room stereos and
DVD players. In fact, many new disc players come with the ability to
play homemade CDs with MP3 files, the most popular form of
downloadable music, and many DVD players are adding support for
digital video in formats developed by Microsoft and DivXNetworks Inc.</TE>
<TE>   BroadQ's software also requires a home network, but its approach
is different from its predecessors' in that it takes advantage of a
device that's already sitting in one out of 10 U.S. homes--the PS2.
BroadQ's solution requires PS2 owners to buy Sony's broadband adapter
and network the PS2 by connecting the box to a hub via Ethernet
cable. Users then would pop a disc into their PS2 and another into
their PC. The software would let the two machines talk to each other
and share movie and music files. In this fashion, the PS2 becomes a
conduit to the television or home stereo.</TE>
<TE>   But today's console owners have demonstrated little desire to do
anything more with their boxes than play games, much less buy
peripherals for their machines and hook them up to a network. Sony,
knowing this, plans to ship just 400,000 of the adapters needed to
connect the PS2 to the Internet or a home network over the next seven
months.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, BroadQ has lined up a few allies to help convince
PS2 owners to buy its technology: MoodLogic automatically generates
playlists for the digital music files on a computer, SnapStream
enables computers with built-in TV tuners to record shows digitally,
and DivXNetworks makes one of the most popular formats for
downloadable movies.</TE>
<TE>   With these partners, a BroadQ-equipped PS2 can function as a
jukebox, personal video recorder and digital video player. The
consumers most likely to benefit are those who've filled their
computers with movies and music from online file-sharing services,
the richest sources of free--and unauthorized--copies of media on the
Net.</TE>
<TE>   Noticeably missing from the list of partners, however, is Sony.</TE>
<TE>   A Sony spokeswoman declined to comment, other than to say BroadQ
is not an officially sanctioned PlayStation technology.</TE>
<TE>   Sony's desire to distance itself from BroadQ is hardly surprising,
analysts say, given BroadQ's support for the DivX format popular with
online movie pirates. Aside from making games, Sony also produces
movies and music, and like other major studios and labels, Sony is
struggling against piracy.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese consumer-electronics giant also is working to develop
its own solutions for distributing entertainment over the Internet.
One such effort is PlayStation 3, which is not expected out until
2005 or later. Sony is working with IBM Corp. and Toshiba to develop
a 16-chip microprocessor architecture capable of processing
photo-realistic digital data for games and movies. Sony also expects
the machine to have the ability to connect to high-speed Internet
services.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Internet becomes a mainstream source of home
entertainment, consumers will need simple, wireless home networking,
fast Internet connections with guaranteed high capacity, and standard
approaches to blocking piracy, Gartner's McNealy said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have any of those things today," he said. "Since home
networking isn't mature enough yet, we'll continue to see patchwork
solutions like this in the interim."</TE>

<HD>Union, Shipping Lines to Resume Talks</HD>
<DH>Labor: West Coast ports experience minor work delays over
the weekend as they enter one of the year's busiest periods.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Minor work delays at three West Coast ports over the weekend were
likely to set the tone for another tense week between dockworkers and
their employers who are attempting to hammer out a labor contract
during one of the busiest periods of the year for cargo shipments.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiations between the workers' union and the group representing
port operators and shippers were to resume today. The two sides met
Friday and Saturday after a dockworker lockout was narrowly averted
late last week. No discussions were held Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping lines and
terminal operators, said that the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union slowed work at Port Hueneme and Tacoma, Wash., sites
on Saturday when it failed to send enough workers to cover shifts.</LD>
<TE>   "We experienced three work actions this weekend," said shippers
spokesman Steve Sugerman. "They didn't rise to the level of what
happened last week in Long Beach, but they were notable."</TE>
<TE>   The union denied intentionally causing any slowdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just so busy right now that we don't have enough people to
cover all the jobs," said Steve Stallone, spokesman for the ILWU.
"That's all that's going on."</TE>
<TE>   West Coast ports, particularly Long Beach and Los Angeles, have
entered one of the busiest periods of the year, as the nation's
retailers stock up on imported goods for the Christmas shopping
season. Long Beach and Los Angeles ports handle roughly 8 million
cargo containers each year. The PMA also accused the union of
vandalizing a facility in Portland, Ore., Friday when a crane
operator hoisting steel crashed into a catwalk, damaging property.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the result of the frustration of an individual member.
This is not a work action," Stallone said.</TE>
<TE>   Contract talks began four months ago and the key issue has been
the introduction of new technology. The union maintains that such
changes could threaten union jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking for a guarantee that the remaining jobs and
whatever new jobs created by the technology will be union jobs,"
Stallone said. "If they agreed, we could work out the rest of the
contract without much difficulty."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the PMA threatened to lock out workers after shippers
accused the union of intentionally causing delays and sending fewer
workers than needed to fill shifts at the Stevedoring Services of
America terminal in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The lockout was averted after the ILWU sent full crews to the SSA
terminal.</TE>
<TE>   The contract being negotiated covers 10,500 dockworkers from San
Diego to Seattle. One UC Berkeley study estimated that a coast-wide
shutdown would cost the U.S. economy $1 billion a day.</TE>
<TE>   PMA's Sugerman said that as long as crews were dispatched equally
among terminal operators, the association would not deem the shortage
to be an orchestrated job action. However, he added that the PMA
would consider a lockout again if it saw evidence of a slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   The port's leading imports include such products as Asia-produced
clothing, toys, shoes, handbags and consumer electronics.</TE>

<HD>Big Asbestos Trial to Begin in West Virginia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Reuters</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A massive asbestos trial against some of the world's largest
companies, including ExxonMobil and Honeywell International, begins
in West Virginia this week, even as the case is being challenged
before the U.S. Supreme Court.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit in Kanawha County Circuit Court comprises the cases of
8,000 people who say they were exposed to the deadly agent. But about
half of the 259 defendants have appealed to the high court, saying
the cases are so dissimilar that consolidating them infringes on
their constitutional rights.</LD>
<LD>   Defendants range from manufacturers to groups of employers and
building owners, and cases are so numerous the trial was to be split
into separate but simultaneous proceedings--one for firms sued over
product liability claims and the other for those sued for on-premises
exposure to asbestos.</LD>
<TE>   Jury selection is due to begin Tuesday, with oral arguments
starting as early as Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Asbestos is a mineral that was widely used for fireproofing and
insulation until the 1970s, when its use was curtailed after
scientists concluded that inhaled asbestos fibers could be linked to
lung cancer and other diseases.</TE>
<TE>   But asbestos-related sicknesses take years to materialize. And in
the last three years, the number of asbestos lawsuits has been
increasing, forcing about 50 U.S. corporations into bankruptcy
because of related liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, there are some 200,000 pending asbestos claims.</TE>

<HD>Fed Expected to Keep Interest Rates Level</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal Reserve officials are expected to hold interest rates steady
at 40-year lows when they meet this week as concerns linger over the
health of the U.S. recovery despite signs of solid economic growth.</LD>
<LD>   Many economists believe that the U.S. economy will post a
respectable annual growth rate of well over 3% for the quarter ending
this month. But that growth reflects a burst of consumer spending
that some worry may not last.</LD>
<LD>   Though consumers have been spending freely, businesses show no
signs of loosening their belts.</LD>
<TE>   "Whatever kick you get from the consumer side doesn't seem to
create any momentum in the economy because businesses are just not
responding," said Ethan Harris, chief economist at Lehman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Fed chief Alan Greenspan and his fellow policymakers on the
central bank's Federal Open Market Committee are expected to hold
interest rates steady when policymakers meet Tuesday, although Harris
thinks they eventually will be forced to lower them again.</TE>
<TE>   The benchmark overnight lending rate has remained at 1.75% since
December, a level reached after 11 Fed rate cuts.</TE>
<TE>   None of the 22 large Wall Street firms that deal directly with the
Fed in the markets expect a rate change at Tuesday's meeting. But a
Reuters survey found six of the so-called primary dealers clinging to
predictions of a rate cut by the end of the year.</TE>

<LD>Leading U.S. airline executives will detail the industry's sorry
financial condition to Congress this week and ask lawmakers for more
help to stem mounting losses.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executives Leo Mullin of Delta Air Lines, Donald Carty of
American Airlines parent AMR Corp. and Richard Anderson of Northwest
Airlines will appear before the House aviation subcommittee Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The industry has stepped up lobbying this month as airlines
prepare to report another quarter of staggering losses.</LD>
<TE>   Major airlines posted $7.7 billion in red ink last year even after
receiving billions in a government bailout. Wall Street estimates
show that the nine biggest U.S. airlines will lose $5.7 billion to $7
billion in 2002 and as much as $3.3 billion in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John Mica (R-Fla.) is considering legislation to help the
airlines, but no plan has emerged.</TE>

<HD>Earnings Warnings, Economic Data Expected</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Reuters; Bloomberg News</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street walks a tightrope this week as investors focus on
Tuesday's Fed meeting while deciphering economic tea leaves and
bracing for more corporate warnings.</LD>
<LD>   The earnings warning season this week moves into high gear as many
companies announce that their third-quarter earnings will land shy of
analysts' consensus estimates.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts expect third-quarter earnings at companies in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 to rise 8.5% from the year-ago period,
according to market researcher Thomson First Call. That's down from
expectations of 10.9% growth just one week ago.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Wall Street will seek more cues on where the economy is
headed from this week's hefty helping of reports.</TE>
<TE>   Two measures of consumer confidence to be released this week are
expected to show that sentiment flagged in September.</TE>
<TE>   An index from the Conference Board on Tuesday probably will show a
drop to 92.4 from 93.5 in August. A University of Michigan index, for
release Friday, probably will fall to 86 from 87.6, analysts predict.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street gets two reports on the housing sector midweek:
Wednesday's existing-homes figures for August, seen edging up 5.4
million from 5.33 million, and Thursday's new-home sales for last
month, seen falling to 981,000 from 1.017 million.</TE>
<TE>   Durable-goods orders, another important report, for August will be
released Thursday and were seen falling 2.6%, from a rise of 9.2% in
July.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's final reading on economic growth as measured by gross
domestic product is expected to show a rise of 1.2% compared with a
preliminary reading of 1.1%.</TE>

<HD>Qwest May Retract $1 Billion in Revenue</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International expects to announce this week that
it plans to retract about $1 billion in revenue booked from swaps of
capacity on its fiber-optic network, sources told Associated Press.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement, initially reported in Saturday editions of the
Rocky Mountain News, probably would come before the House Energy and
Commerce Committee begins hearings on the deals Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Qwest spokesman Tyler Gronbach said the committee and full board
of directors met last week but would not say what they discussed.</LD>
<TE>   Regulatory filings show that Qwest recognized $953 million in
revenue from so-called swaps in 2000 and 2001 in which it nearly
simultaneously bought and sold network capacity with another
telecommunications company.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether
the deals helped Qwest artificially boost revenues. Qwest also is the
subject of a Justice Department investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Two Qwest executives were scheduled to testify in congressional
hearings Tuesday, and former Chief Executive Joe Nacchio is expected
to testify in October.</TE>

<HD>Religious Mutual Fund to Charge Fee for Small Shareholders</HD>
<DH>Investing: Though MMA Praxis may be gaining in popularity
with scandal-weary investors, it is experiencing the same downturn as
its secular rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES PATON</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Religious mutual funds may be gaining in popularity among
scandal-weary investors as their secular rivals struggle to lure
money in a tough stock market.</LD>
<LD>   But Christian money manager MMA Praxis showed this week that it is
experiencing some of the same problems the rest of the industry
faces.</LD>
<LD>   The firm is slapping extra fees on small investors as the company
and its rivals cope with the long stock slide, which has chipped away
at the fees they earn from managing money.</LD>
<TE>   An investor in an MMA Praxis fund whose assets fall below the
$2,000 mark will be charged an annual fee of $14, beginning in
December. The firm, which avoids casino, nuclear energy, pornography
and defense stocks and other companies its managers see as unethical,
disclosed the changes in a filing last week with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Most boards probably would have passed this without a lot of
discussion," said John Liechty, president of MMA Praxis, which
adheres to Mennonite principles. "But given the fact of who we are,
there was some lively discussion among some of our trustees about
whether this was the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   But in the end it made sense, he said. Small shareholder accounts
sometimes cost more to maintain than they generate in fees, and big
investors end up subsidizing the small ones.</TE>
<TE>   About 40% of MMA Praxis shareholders, Liechty said, have an
account balance of less than $2,500.</TE>
<TE>   A number of firms, hungry for assets with their stock funds
depressed, have stuck investors with new or higher fees in recent
months. Fidelity Investments and American Century are among the firms
that have levied charges to try to weed out small investors who don't
generate much money for the firms.</TE>
<TE>   The trend has upset investors, whose accounts often fall below
minimum levels because their funds' stock picks went sour, not
because they withdrew their money.</TE>
<TE>   The $17-million MMA Praxis Value Index Fund, which has lost about
21% over the last 12 months, is one of the latest funds to add the
fees.</TE>
<TE>   The firm said investors who have $10,000 invested across the
firm's portfolio would not face the extra charges. Investors who
don't meet the $2,000 threshold also can avoid the fee if they opt to
make monthly deposits of $50 into their accounts, Liechty said.</TE>
<TE>   The firm noted that, unlike many other companies, it is not
raising the minimum investment it takes to get into one of its funds.
That remains at $500.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to do anything to turn away the small investor,"
Liechty said, adding that the firm is sending out detailed
explanations of the changes to investors.</TE>
<TE>   The change comes as the firm reported that religious mutual funds
are more popular than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   MMA Praxis said U.S. assets in those funds rose to $4.42 billion
in March from $3.65 billion in March 1999, a climb of 21%, according
to a survey by Thomson Financial's Wealth Management Group.</TE>
<TE>   Assets for all U.S. mutual funds, meanwhile, increased 11% in that
three-year period, the data showed.</TE>
<TE>   Religious funds make up only a tiny portion of the overall
industry. Other portfolios in the group include the $59-million Ave
Maria Catholic Values fund and the $9-million Noah Fund, which is
guided by biblical principles.</TE>
<TE>   MMA Praxis, meanwhile, has recorded gross sales of $47 million for
the year, Liechty said, fairly high considering that the firm has
only $300 million or so in total mutual fund assets. He declined to
provide a number for net inflows, but said the money streaming in has
easily exceeded redemptions this year.</TE>

<HD>Sempra Adds Coffee to Portfolio, Sources Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sempra Energy, an energy services holding company based in San Diego
that also has trading operations, apparently has branched out in the
commodity arena to include coffee in its portfolio, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   David Messer, president of Sempra Energy Trading, was not
available for comment, and a company spokesman did not confirm or
deny the firm's activities outside of energy and metals.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a policy of not commenting on our individual trading
positions. Nearly all our business is in energy and metals. From time
to time we may also have business in other commodities.</LD>
<TE>   These other commodities comprise a small portion of our overall
trading activities," said Doug Kline, spokesman for Sempra Energy
Trading, which is based in Stamford, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Baum, chief executive of Sempra Energy, told Reuters in an
interview last month that the company was looking at new businesses
that fit its mix and returned three times their costs.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra pushed into metals trading after acquiring Enron Corp.'s
metals business this year.</TE>
<TE>   A source at one commission house said he understood that Sempra
was holding a sizable long position in coffee futures.</TE>
<TE>   Coffee is the second most traded commodity after oil and has been
in a prolonged bear market, with futures prices touching an all-time
low of 41.50 cents a pound in December 2001 as global production
outweighed consumption.</TE>
<TE>   Bean prices have improved in recent months to about 56 cents a
pound, but prices remain below the cost of production for many
Central American farmers, and most analysts expect prices to remain
depressed until production comes into better balance with demand.</TE>

<HD>Recovery Elusive for Tech Sector</HD>
<DH>Economy: Analysts see few signs of a rebound in the
industry before next year, although there are a few bright spots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk of war, consumer anxiety and a swooning stock market have pushed
prospects of a technology sector recovery deep into next year as
analysts see little lined up this holiday season to rescue the
industry from a lackluster year.</LD>
<LD>   "Technology has yet to emerge from its slump," said Richard
DeKaser, chief economist at National City Corp., a Cleveland-based
financial institution. "Telecommunications continues to reel.
Computer makers are barely getting on their feet. Same thing for
semiconductors."</LD>
<LD>   Only six months ago, economists widely projected a technology
rebound by the end of the year. But recent signs suggest that it's
going to take a lot longer for the sector to stage a comeback.</LD>
<TE>   On Sunday, San Diego-based Peregrine Systems Inc. filed for
Bankruptcy Court protection, becoming the latest victim of the
technology meltdown. The move followed a rash of technology stock
selling that forced several issues to multiyear lows on Friday,
including Texas Instruments Inc., IBM Corp., Intel Corp. and Micron
Technology Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Also last week, database software maker Oracle Corp. posted a 33%
drop in its first-quarter profit and projected that its full-year
earnings could stagnate, portending continued weakness in software
spending. Among hardware makers, North American semiconductor
equipment suppliers saw orders fall in August from July as chip
companies throttled back capital spending.</TE>
<TE>   Even computer services, an area that seemed rock steady as more
companies hand over the care of their computer systems to specialized
firms, is starting to flag. Electronics Data Systems Corp., the
largest provider of technology services, on Wednesday said a paucity
of orders from existing and new customers would erase more than 60
cents a share off its third-quarter earnings forecast of 74 cents.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, capital spending booms and busts are mirror images of
each other," said Fred Breimyer, chief economist at State Street
Corp. in Boston. "They take awhile to develop, and they take awhile
to correct. We just aren't used to seeing this in our lifetimes. It's
a 19th century phenomenon, where there were many such booms and busts
in such industries as steel and railroads."</TE>
<TE>   Not all is grim, to be sure. Many large corporations continue to
invest in technology, albeit at a much slower pace than during the
late 1990s. Intel two weeks ago said it is buying 28,000 computers
for its employees this year after purchasing none last year. Laptops
also continue to move briskly, and sales are projected to rise 11%
this year, according to Framingham, Mass., research firm IDC.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment has also been a boon. Film and television studios
are expanding their use of digital equipment to shoot a growing
number of TV shows and movies. And video game companies are
projecting record sales this coming holiday period, thanks in large
part to new game consoles.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the overall picture for tech remains decidedly weak.</TE>
<TE>   The glare of corporate accounting scandals, analysts say, is
making many companies afraid to take new risks. And that, in turn,
has caused them to postpone purchases for such items as new PCs,
which were last replaced en masse in 1999 in preparation for the Y2K
conversion.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the rush to build Web-based businesses has cooled, with
established brick-and-mortar companies making do with existing
equipment and many pure-play e-commerce companies going under
entirely.</TE>
<TE>   The upshot: Sales of more expensive and more powerful server
computers have fallen for six straight quarters, according to IDC.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, consumers have propped up sales of everything from
cell phones and DVD players to personal computers and laptops. "The
consumer held up surprisingly well against all economic odds," said
Fred Hickey, editor of the High Tech Strategist newsletter in Nashua,
N.H.</TE>
<TE>   But they, too, may be running out of steam. "That's because lower
interest rates have led people to take on as much debt as they could
possibly gorge," Hickey said. "Unfortunately, they may be stuffed so
full with debt that they'll now sink to the bottom of the ocean. They
can't just keep consuming because it's all debt spending."</TE>
<TE>   One sign of a slowdown among consumers came last month when
electronics retail giant Best Buy Co. reported across-the-board
weakness in sales. The company projected that as a result, profits
could drop by about a third in the current quarter from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, PC makers typically enjoy a boost from
back-to-school sales. But this year, it was barely perceptible. PC
shipments worldwide are now expected to increase an anemic 1.1% for
all of 2002, according to IDC, not the 4.7% projected in June.</TE>
<TE>   Many technology companies also look to the holiday season for a
lift. Expectations are more subdued this year, however.</TE>
<TE>   "The holidays have been a clear bump for the tech sector the past
15 years or more," said Michael Murphy, editor of the California
Technology Stock Letter in Half Moon Bay, Calif. "This year, it's not
going to be a boomer, because nobody's building inventory. That's
because no one wants to end up with a lot of unsold goods on their
hands. So we expect it to be up this holiday, but only moderately
so."</TE>
<TE>   Further tempering both business and consumer spending, say
analysts, is the possibility of a war between the United States and
Iraq. "Iraq increases uncertainty across the board," State Street's
Breimyer said, "and not just from a potential spike in oil prices. It
also causes corporations and individuals to put things on hold.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes planning difficult. And that alone will retard even
further whatever recovery might be out there."</TE>
<TE>   Times reporters David Colker, Jon Healey, P.J. Huffstutter and
Joseph Menn contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Yahoo to Launch Video Game Rental Service</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In its latest move to generate revenue outside online advertising,
Internet portal Yahoo Inc. is launching a rental service that allows
users to download and play video games on demand.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike other Internet gaming sites, the Yahoo service offers
well-known titles that run as if the CD-ROM were bought at a store
and popped into the personal computer, said Daniel Hart, Yahoo's
senior director of games and entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the data required to run each game are streamed to the PC
over the Internet before the game is started for the first time. The
program then runs off the hard drive, downloading additional files as
needed. It expires at the end of the rental period.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a full-screen, rich audiovisual experience--exactly like a
CD from a store," Hart said.</TE>
<TE>   The service is scheduled to launch early today.</TE>
<TE>   Prices range from $4.95 for the rental of one game for three days
to $14.95 for the rental of 10 games for 30 days, with other options
in between. About 40 games--including Grand Theft Auto 2, Skate Park
Tycoon, Tomb Raider Chronicles and Backyard Basketball--are
available.</TE>
<TE>   Once a game is selected, users must download a large file--up to
200 megabytes. The so-called pre-caching file remains on the
computer, so subsequent starts of the same title are faster.</TE>
<TE>   The new service works only on Windows-based PCs with high-speed
Internet connections. The files can be played only through Yahoo's
launch program, developed by Exent Technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Yahoo has been launching numerous
fee-based services since the collapse of the ad market that supported
most dot-coms in the boom years.</TE>
<TE>   Other Internet gaming sites typically offer programs that were
developed in the Java programming language or that run through the
Flash multimedia player.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Yahoo stock closed at $9.75, down 24 cents, on Nasdaq.
The stock is down 5% this year.</TE>

<HD>Marketers Bypass the Brain, Go Right for the Emotions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The human brain is an amazing thing, able to instantly recognize
faces, invent wondrous tools, memorize epic poems--and be hoodwinked
into acquiring all kinds of stuff it doesn't need.</LD>
<LD>   No wonder marketers have been interested in psychology for at
least as long as psychologists have. The same impulses that drew our
ancestors to linger for hours while foraging for nuts and fruits may
today give us the stamina and desire to endlessly trudge the malls.
The same science that can assess and treat our mental health can
impact, too, the health of our wallets.</LD>
<LD>   And, if psychologists can figure out the cognitive processes that
render us suggestible (to pluck that berry! to favor nut No. 1 over
nut No. 2!) then marketers can insert some of that science in their
ads, rendering us that much more likely to buy, buy, buy.</LD>
<TE>   Even 100 years ago, this approach was bearing fruit, at a time
when this country's first psychologists had only recently set up
their labs. Most were choosing to study highfalutin basic science
(such as how long it took a person to react to a stimulus), but some
of them--such as Walter Dill Scott--turned his attention to more
earthly matters. Scott's 1908 book, "The Psychology of Advertising,"
turned marketing theory on its head.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, most advertising executives believed that a calm appeal
to the rational mind was the best way to go. A minority had this
notion that it was better not to get people thinking. To render
people most suggestible, one should appeal instead to emotions, hopes
and desires.</TE>
<TE>   Scott amassed data on human decision-making and convinced
marketers that the minority view was the correct one.</TE>
<TE>   "He supported the notion that reasoning, if anything, makes
someone less likely to buy a product--it stops them from acting, from
picking up that Cosmo magazine at the checkout stand and putting it
on the belt," says Robert Wozniak, a psychology professor at Bryn
Mawr College in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   Scott, in other words, may be why we don't tend to see ads for a
Paris getaway focusing on the current percentages in the monetary
exchange rate. Or ads for a Ferrari touting its ergonomically
designed seats. Or why Obsession perfume isn't called "Effective Yet
Economical Mate Attractor."</TE>
<TE>   Books on Psychology</TE>
<TE>   Scott's text was just one of many that helped lay the foundations
of modern psychology. If you're interested in this history, check out
www.thoemmes.com/ psych/contents.htm, where Wosniak reviews 50
classic books (including Scott's).</TE>
<TE>   Here, among much pondering by great thinkers on the nature of
consciousness, memory, intelligence and emotion, are these two
intriguing texts:</TE>
<TE>   * "Clever Hans (The Horse of Mr. von Osten)," by Oskar Pfungst,
1907. "Hans" was a brilliant horse supposedly capable of adding
subtracting, multiplying and more. When asked to solve a problem,
he'd tap out the answers to problems with his hoofs.</TE>
<TE>   Pfungst and a colleague showed that the horse was actually
responding to very subtle posture changes and movements provided by
the person posing the question. When the horse couldn't see the
questioner--or when the questioner didn't know the answers
himself--Hans was stumped.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the inadvertent imparting of such cues is referred to as a
"Clever Hans effect." It's a crucial thing for psychologists to
consider when, for instance, they're studying the intelligence of
babies, young children and animals or when they're conducting
psychological experiments with adults</TE>
<TE>   * "Psychology and Industrial Efficiency," by Hugo Munsterberg,
1913. Before Munsterberg, experts had argued that factories could be
made far more scientific and efficient if workers were taught to
execute every movement in the most streamlined fashion possible.</TE>
<TE>   Munsterberg stressed that it was also important to take the
worker's psychological satisfaction into account. To get a good fit
between task and worker, he devised early psychological tests to
ascertain whether individuals were well-suited to their professions.
These included simulated driving tests to weed out accident-prone
trolley car drivers and reaction-time and memory tests for would-be
switchboard operators.</TE>
<TE>   Such fits were crucial, he argued, if one wished to achieve
"overflowing joy and perfect inner harmony" in the workplace--a
laudable (if ambitious) goal indeed.</TE>

<HD>Benefit of Defibrillators in Public Places Downplayed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANNE PARTIE LANGE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Making defibrillators widely available in public places would seem to
improve the chances of saving the lives of people having heart
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   But a new study done in Scotland concludes that wide distribution
of the devices, which shock the heart back into normal rhythm,
wouldn't make much of a dent in cardiac arrest fatalities. The main
reason, report the researchers, is that most cardiac arrests occur at
home. Among the 15,000 people in their study, only 3% had cardiac
arrests in sites that are considered suitable for public-access
defibrillators, such as sports centers, bus terminals and hotels.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers predicted that putting defibrillators in these
"suitable sites" would increase the number of cardiac arrest
survivors from the present 5% to only 6.3%. If the devices were also
available in "possibly suitable" sites, such as on buses and in
parking garages, the survival rate would increase slightly to 6.5%.</LD>
<TE>   "It's important to realize that wide availability [of
defibrillators] is but one tool to improve ... survival," says Dr.
Vinay Nadkarni, the chairman of the American Heart Assn.'s Emergency
Cardiovascular Care Committee. "We can make a small impact with the
technology, but a large impact will require training people on the
whole chain of survival." That chain includes recognizing signs of a
heart problem, using the defibrillator or performing CPR and, of
course, prompt arrival of the paramedics.  British Medical Journal
325: 503-504, 515-520.</TE>
<TE>   An Alternative to Tamoxifen Wins Approval From FDA</TE>
<TE>   Post-menopausal women with breast cancer often take tamoxifen,
which blocks the tumor-fueling effects of female hormones but can
raise the risk of uterine cancer. Now they have another choice.</TE>
<TE>   Early this month, the Food and Drug Administration approved the
drug Arimidex (anastrozole) for treatment of early-stage,
hormone-sensitive cancer in such women. The drug, which blocks the
production of estrogen, had previously been approved for more
advanced cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The new approval was based on a trial involving 9,300 women in 21
countries. That study found that Arimidex alone was slightly more
effective than tamoxifen in preventing recurrence in early-stage
cancer patients who had undergone surgery. Although the study
followed women for just 31 months, the results indicate that Arimidex
had fewer side effects, such as vaginal bleeding and hot flashes, and
was safer than tamoxifen, says Dr. Aman Buzdar, professor of breast
medical oncology at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   However, an American Society of Clinical Oncology panel raised
cautions in May about the lack of long-term follow-up. One
disadvantage of Arimidex is that it doesn't prevent bone loss as
tamoxifen does. Dr. Jennifer Malin, assistant professor of medicine
at UCLA and a researcher at the UCLA Jonsson Cancer Center, says,
"It's too early to say that Arimidex will replace tamoxifen.... It
looks like it has a slightly lower risk of uterine cancer, but we
don't know what the long-term side effects might be."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Malin says, "The only role I see [for Arimidex] is for
post-menopausal women who for some reason can't tolerate tamoxifen."</TE>
<TE>   Avoiding Milk Has Major Impact on Children's Bone Growth</TE>
<TE>   Countless studies have shown that calcium is essential for healthy
bone growth, and every parent knows that milk is an excellent source
of the mineral. Now the first study of bone development in healthy
children who have avoided milk has shown the impact of that
deficiency.</TE>
<TE>   New Zealand researchers at Otago University found that children
who didn't drink milk were shorter and their bones were smaller and
more fragile than those who drank it regularly. The bone mineral
density of those who avoided milk was 7% lower than that of children
in the control group, and some children were 20% below normal. A high
proportion of the boys and girls, ages 3 to 10, had already
experienced broken bones. On average, the milk avoiders were about
2.4 inches shorter than the milk drinkers.</TE>
<TE>   Although past research had shown that children who are allergic to
milk or lactose intolerant have low calcium levels, no studies had
evaluated as many bone measurements in healthy children who
deliberately avoid milk.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers also discovered that few of the chronic milk
avoiders drank calcium-rich substitute drinks or took supplements.</TE>

<TE>   High 'Empty Calorie' Consumption May Predict Weight Gain</TE>
<TE>   While many of us are counting calories and fat grams to control
our weight, new research shows that the overall pattern of what you
eat is an important predictor of weight trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Using detailed food questionnaires, Boston University researchers
categorized the eating behavior of about 700 normal-weight women. Of
the five categories, the women who were most likely to be overweight
in the following decade or so were those who tended to eat more empty
calories, foods with a lot of calories but little nutrition.</TE>
<TE>   The "heart healthy" group were the least likely to become
overweight over the next 12 years. They ate plenty of fruits and
vegetables, low-fat dairy foods and other lower-fat, fiber-rich
foods.</TE>
<TE>   The "high-fat" group consumed the highest amount of fats, mostly
in foods such as mayonnaise, dressings and spreads. The "light
eating" group appeared to be the dieters. They ate fewer calories by
cutting out certain foods, but they didn't substitute healthier
alternatives from the produce aisle. They were most likely to see
their weight yo-yo over the years. The "wine and moderate eating"
group consumed notably more alcohol than the other four groups. Their
eating behavior was otherwise average.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve years later, about a third of the women were overweight.
The "empty calorie" group's diet was associated with a 40% increase
in risk compared with "heart healthy" eaters.</TE>
<TE>   "The 'heart healthy' eating behavior can serve as a model to other
women.... Intentionally trying to adopt a lower-fat, more
nutritionally varied diet will help to protect women from weight gain
over time," says Paula A. Quatromoni, a coauthor of the study.</TE>

<TE>   Large-Volume Liposuction Still Thought Risky for Diabetics</TE>
<TE>   Overweight people with type 2 diabetes can improve their condition
with weight loss. Of course, diet and exercise are the preferred ways
to accomplish that loss, but when those attempts fail, could
liposuction be the solution?</TE>
<TE>   Anecdotal reports, news stories and the occasional small study
indicate that it's time for some serious scientific scrutiny, some
doctors say, particularly with regard to the metabolic effects of
large-volume liposuction, in which about 8 to 10 pounds of fat are
removed at one time.</TE>
<TE>   "Large-volume liposuction may have a role, but there's no
long-term data to suggest that it has a lasting beneficial effect,"
says Dr. Michael A. Bush, clinical chief of endocrinology at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He points out that there
are two kinds of fat: the kind under the skin that you can pinch and
fat deep within the abdomen. That deep fat lining the abdominal
cavity, the intestines and other body organs has a significant effect
on diabetes and cannot be removed with liposuction.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles plastic surgeon Dr. Peter Fodor, vice president of the
American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, agrees that
intra-abdominal fat affects insulin requirements but says more
studies are needed on the role of the fat under the skin. "When we
remove subcutaneous fat, we see an improvement ... and
endocrinologists, to my knowledge, aren't paying enough attention to
this."</TE>
<TE>   But safety is a concern. Large-volume liposuction is more risky
than small-or medium-volume liposuction, Fodor says, and a diabetic
is not an ideal candidate for the procedure.</TE>

<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Within days of last fall's anthrax scare, fly-by-night Web sites
hawking the antibiotic Cipro sprang up over the Internet, exploiting
the nation's sudden--and justifiable--fear of bioterror, medical
investigators reported recently.</LD>
<LD>   Writing in the Sept. 13 American Journal of Medicine, researchers
found 59 shady pharmacies that sold the potent and potentially
dangerous antibiotic. Most of the virtual pharmacies, the study
showed, did not require a prescription as mandated by federal law.
"The American Medical Assn. considers this practice very dangerous
because there is no doctor-patient relationship," said Alexander
Tsai, a member of the research team and a medical student at Case
Western Reserve University in Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   For the handful of pharmacies that did require a prescription,
Cipro purchasers needed only to fill out an online questionnaire and
have a "virtual doctor" dispense the drugs, researchers said.</LD>
<TE>   "We found that within two weeks of the first anthrax attack that a
spate of these Web sites popped up," Tsai added. "Having this
high-profile event gave people the opportunity to show there was a
lack of regulation in this area."</TE>
<TE>   Tsai worked with Dr. Ashwini Sehgal, a professor at Case's medical
school, and Dr. Peter Lurie, deputy director of Public Citizen's
Health Research Group, a consumer watchdog group.</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration recently chose not to issue
guidelines requiring special labeling of drugs sold over the
Internet. Critics have complained that prescriptions sold online
leave patients vulnerable to powerful drugs, and that pharmacists
cannot explain the dangers. With proper labeling, patients would be
better informed, critics say.</TE>
<TE>   Patients taking Cipro should be monitored by a doctor. Side
effects can include heart damage, increased intracranial pressure and
convulsions.</TE>
<TE>   Web sites that provide prescriptions can join the National Assn.
of Boards of Pharmacy, which requires virtual sellers to abide by
inspection criteria and state-licensing requirements. None of the
sites in the study had joined the program. "We analyzed them [the
virtual pharmacies] and found they were of poor quality, had no
safeguards and charged high prices," Tsai said. Most of the sites
charged a markup of 50% over the wholesale cost, the study found.
Cipro is manufactured by the Bayer Corp., which was not the supplier
of the Internet sites, and had reported difficulty ramping up
production last year.</TE>
<TE>   Anthrax attacks killed five people in the U.S. When the assaults
stopped, the Cipro-selling sites vanished, Tsai added.</TE>

<HD>Pain Clinic Suit Can Proceed</HD>
<DH>Consumers* Judge denies motion to dismiss case in which
doctors are accused of misleading and deceptive advertising for
Diskcure treatment.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state Superior Court judge in Los Angeles last week cleared the way
for a lawsuit that accuses several Los Angeles doctors and a back
pain clinic of misleading and deceptive advertising related to claims
for a treatment known as Diskcure.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Anthony Bohan, a Newport Beach rheumatologist, alleges that
doctors at the Institute of Neurological Research have falsely
advertised that the Diskcure program can cure chronic back pain and
"have not performed scientific research" to support those claims.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, Superior Court Judge David A. Workman denied a motion
by the defendants to dismiss the case. Initially filed in May, the
suit also names as defendants Drs. Edward L. Tobinick, Ronesh Sinha
and Susan Davoodifar.</LD>
<TE>   Tobinick, the clinic's founder, said Friday that the suit is
"meritless."</TE>
<TE>   The suit also alleges that the back pain clinic's advertisements
mislead consumers into thinking that the institute, located in an
office building on the UCLA Medical School campus, is affiliated with
the university, when it is not.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first heard the ads on the radio, I thought that some
neurologists at UCLA had really found a breakthrough treatment for
back pain," Bohan said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   He later concluded otherwise. "I brought the lawsuit on behalf of
consumers, some of whom are the most vulnerable patients."</TE>
<TE>   Tobinick, a dermatologist who in 1996 founded the Institute,
located at UCLA Medical Plaza, denied the allegations. He said there
is scientific evidence that Diskcure works.</TE>
<TE>   "A business competitor can sue a competitor without any grounds to
do it, and that's what's happening in this case," he said. "Because
of scientific evidence in support of Diskcure, I feel certain that
this suit will not be allowed to proceed."</TE>
<TE>   The Diskcure treatment is heavily advertised on the radio and in
newspapers. Tobinick has said that the clinic has treated about 2,000
patients with Diskcure during the past two years.</TE>
<TE>   The treatment includes a single shot of the arthritis drug Enbrel,
usually given in the lower back near the source of the pain, the
lawsuit alleges.</TE>
<TE>   Enbrel is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis but not for back pain, said Jeff
Richardson, a spokesman for Amgen, which makes the drug. Enbrel is
associated with rare but serious side effects including tuberculosis
infection, multiple sclerosis symptoms and blood abnormalities.
Richardson said Amgen had heard that Tobinick may be using Enbrel for
back pain but has no way to verify the information. If true,
Richardson said, the company would be concerned, because Enbrel is in
short supply and thousands of arthritis patients are on waiting
lists. "Certainly we do not condone the off-label use of any of our
products," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Off-label use of drugs is common in medicine, however, and often
leads to new treatments, Tobinick said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever you have innovations in medicine, there has been
reluctance to accept them," he said.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unless you've been living underground for the last few years, you
know that the fat-versus-carbohydrate controversy has refused to die.</LD>
<LD>   Although a lot of people have made money promoting fad diets of
one sort or another, the bottom line is that calories do count and
the only way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you take
in. The theory behind the high-fat diet is that foods high in
saturated fat fill you up more quickly, and thus you consume fewer
calories.</LD>
<LD>   In the short term, that may actually work. However, if you do
manage to lose some weight, what about your long-term risk of heart
disease and cancer when your diet is routinely high in saturated fat?</LD>
<TE>   According to the American Institute for Cancer Research, which
supports research in cancer prevention and treatment, effective
weight loss and control are all about proportion and portion size.
About two years ago, the institute began a campaign, called "The New
American Plate," to urge people to change the proportion of food on
their plates to two-thirds (or more) vegetables, fruit, whole grains
and beans and to one-third (or less) meat, chicken or fish.</TE>
<TE>   According to the institute, "the higher percentage of plant food
is intended to crowd the animal protein and fat to the periphery of
the plate."</TE>
<TE>   The logic here, of course, is that plant foods tend to be rich in
vitamins, minerals and other phytochemicals that help our bodies
fight cancer and other chronic diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, healthy eating is only one part of the equation.
Regular exercise not only helps burn extra calories but also is a
wonderful gift to your body.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't take much exercise to lower your risk of heart disease,
certain cancers and even depression, and it makes the job of losing
weight and keeping it off much easier.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I saw the attending physician and a junior resident coming down the
hall at the end of a long day. I asked where they were going. "To
make tea" was the answer. Intrigued, I followed. Was the resident
feeling ill? Was this a social visit? It didn't feel like the 9 a.m.
coffee run.</LD>
<LD>   I joined them in the small staff room. The attending physician was
heating water, gathering a cup and a tea bag. The resident physician
looked resigned and tired. They both looked discouraged. Clearly,
these two physicians weren't going home for a while.</LD>
<LD>   "What happened?" I asked. Although I was ready to head out the
door to dinner, as the director of the family practice residency
program, I am always on the lookout for problems.</LD>
<TE>   Resident physicians in family practice spend three years after
medical school learning the art and science of family medicine.
Attending physicians are their teachers and mentors. Seventeen years
in medical education has taught me to look for interactions like this
one, where the lives of the physicians touch the lives of their
patients in unique ways. Our specialty encourages physicians to use
the latest in medical technology, but often the warmth of a personal
relationship is where the real healing starts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the woman who wanted the iron shot," the resident said with
a sigh. I remembered hearing about her the week before. The emergency
room doctor wanted to bring this young woman into the hospital for
treatment for low blood count (anemia) from heavy menstrual periods.
Instead, we opted to care for her in our office. She wasn't sick
enough for hospitalization; she just needed iron. She didn't like (or
couldn't take) iron pills and demanded iron shots. She said her past
doctors had given them to her. Why wouldn't we?</TE>
<TE>   The attending and resident had agonized over this patient and her
medical problems. They weighed her anemia, her fatigue, her family
problems, her many children and her clear dislike of iron pills. She
seemed sick and sad, not just from her anemia. A recent immigrant
with many responsibilities, she radiated helplessness.</TE>
<TE>   The physicians knew that iron was just a small part of her
treatment, but it was what she focused on at present. They realized
that a slightly more expensive version of iron might be easier on her
stomach, but it wouldn't be covered by her state-funded health plan.
She demanded the shots. Why wouldn't the doctors give them to her?</TE>
<TE>   Requests for shots are common from patients originally from other
countries. In many countries injections are used often, presumably
making it easier to ensure that people get the medicine. The resident
looked up iron injections in the medical literature, wondering why
almost no one uses them here anymore.</TE>
<TE>   The list of problems was staggering, especially the one about an
immediate, possibly fatal allergic reaction. In addition, the patient
must be observed for at least an hour and must have daily injections,
not just one. It seems that the woman had never followed through with
the full therapy. No wonder she was still anemic.</TE>
<TE>   After finding medical records to prove she had no past allergies
to the shots, they decided to give the iron injections a try. At
least her health plan covered them. The physicians knew she needed
iron somehow.</TE>
<TE>   That brings us back to the hot tea. The patient had just received
her first iron shot, and after all the warnings and discussions, she
felt immediately sick. The resident and attending physician evaluated
her extensively. Ultimately, they determined this was not an allergic
reaction but, rather, the sickness that comes of being tired and
frightened.</TE>
<TE>   Patients want the best that medicine has to offer, but physicians
and patients need to learn that often the best is a kind word, a
gentle hand and a listening ear. Too often, in our highly
technologized medical care system, both parties feel the answer to
all problems lies in a test or pill.</TE>
<TE>   This patient was so focused on her diagnosis that she wasn't aware
of her own exhaustion and need for someone to care about her. The
senior physician knew that although her blood count was low, her
spirit was lower. Seeing the patient's reaction to the shot and
knowing her resistance to discussing her feelings, the senior
physician offered another direction. She directed the resident
physician to leave the patient with the nurse while they proceeded to
find a more suitable treatment. "What she needs is hot tea," the
senior physician said.</TE>
<TE>   "Something warm, soothing, to help her feel better." They returned
to care for their patient in the best way they knew, carrying a
steaming cup of tea.</TE>

<HD>Nursing Support Found Not to Change C-Section Rate</HD>
<DH>Childbirth* Contradicting earlier studies, research shows
that presence of a specially trained labor nurse does not reduce
incidence of the surgery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Women who have a specially trained nurse at their side throughout
labor appear to be just as likely to have a caesarean section as
women with typical nursing care.</LD>
<LD>   The finding contradicts previous studies suggesting that C-section
rates--which have soared in recent years to almost 25% of all U.S.
births--might be lower if women were attended by nurses providing
ample social and emotional support, advice and information.</LD>
<LD>   Many hospitals have adopted policies to provide such support
because caesarean births are associated with higher risks of medical
complications, longer hospital stays, longer recovery time and higher
costs.</LD>
<TE>   The new study, published last week in the Journal of the American
Medical Assn., was directed by Ellen D. Hodnett, a nursing professor
and researcher at the University of Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Hodnett in 1999 published an analysis of 14 studies and concluded
that there were several advantages to having continuous labor
support, including shorter labors, reduced use of pain medication and
fewer C-sections.</TE>
<TE>   However, the new study, a randomized controlled trial of almost
7,000 women in 13 U.S. and Canadian hospitals, found C-section rates
of around 12.5% both for women who had specially trained labor nurses
providing continuous care and for women who had nurses who were not
specially trained and may not have provided continuous care.</TE>
<TE>   While continuous support may be helpful, its benefits are likely
"overpowered" by routine medical interventions that increase the
chances of caesarean section, Hodnett said.</TE>
<TE>   These interventions include the use of labor-inducing drugs (which
62% of the women in the study received), continuous electronic fetal
monitoring (77%) and regional anesthesia, such as an epidural (75%).</TE>
<TE>   Instead of adopting policies of one-on-one labor support, Hodnett
suggested that hospitals view birth as a natural event and then
monitor medical practices, such as the use of labor-inducing drugs,
that increase C-section rates.</TE>
<TE>   "The effectiveness of labor support may depend on the setting in
which it is provided," Hodnett said. "However, reducing U.S. and
Canadian caesarean delivery rates cannot be accomplished solely
through a policy of continuous nursing support."</TE>
<TE>   The study found no differences between the two groups in
complications during labor, length of labor, length of hospital stay
or health outcomes of the babies. However, more women in the
continuous support group expressed strong satisfaction with their
birth experiences.</TE>
<TE>   Further studies should focus on whether doulas, women trained to
be labor assistants, have more effect at lowering C-section rates,
says Carol Sakala, director of programs at Maternity Center Assn., a
New York City-based organization devoted to maternity care.</TE>
<TE>   The nurses in the study, she noted, were part of the hospital
staff and had had only two days of labor support training.</TE>
<TE>   "A doula coming in from the outside and with different approaches
might have a different effect," Sakala said. "Doulas have tricks of
the trade, different ways of thinking about [labor] situations."</TE>

<LD>OVERVIEW: PBS and Rodale Press, the publishers of Prevention Inc.,
have teamed up to shine a light on the tremendous struggles of the 30
million caregivers across America who are risking their own health
and livelihoods while tending to elderly and sick relatives. They're
releasing the documentary along with a companion book and have set up
a Web site, www.thoushalthonor.org, to draw attention to the problem
and direct people to sources of help.</LD>
<LD>   WHAT WORKS: The documentary is a bit preachy, hammering home
points about the inadequacy of current health care services for the
elderly and disabled, as well as the lack of support services for
their caregivers. However, it presents compelling stories of families
struggling because the caregivers feel they have no choice morally or
financially but to tend to their loved ones themselves.</LD>
<LD>   The companion book is more useful, offering good, practical help
for those in such straits, including legal pointers, illustrations of
hands-on care and suggestions for preventing caregiver burnout.</LD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's in a name? Plenty, if you ask Albert Cialis, a retired
accountant in southern England. When he discovered that a new
impotence drug from Eli Lilly &amp; Co. shared his surname, he was
mortified. If the drug became well-known, wouldn't being Mr. Cialis
be the equivalent of having the name "Mr. Viagra?"</LD>
<LD>   "It's an unfortunate coincidence," said Nicole Hebert, a
spokeswoman for Eli Lilly, which makes Cialis, a soon-to-be rival to
the blockbuster drug Viagra. Lilly is considering Cialis' request to
rename the drug, she said. The brand name Cialis was derived from the
"ciel," the French word for sky, and is a play on the idea of "the
sky's the limit." The drug is expected to debut in more than 50
countries next year.</LD>
<LD>   While it's doubtful that Lilly would rename a drug this late in
the game, the Cialis incident raises the question: Just how do
pharmaceutical companies come up with the names for their new
therapies?</LD>
<TE>   Product names must not only be unique but capture the essence of
the product in a few short syllables, drug-marketing experts say.
"Names must be easy to remember and easy to say," said Daniel E.
Plaisance, director of the pharmaceutical branding group at Addison
Whitney in Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   The trend is for names that relate closely to the drug's function
or that evoke quality-of-life images that resonate with consumers.
"Older drug names are derived from Latin and medical roots, while the
newer ones are patient-friendly and have more personality," said
James Dettore, chief executive of Brand Institute, a Miami firm that
has developed names for the cholesterol drug Lipitor and Relenza, an
anti-flu medication.</TE>
<TE>   Lipitor, for instance, was derived from the word lipids, the
organic compounds that the drug controls. Relenza hints at relief and
reliability, with a nod to the illness it combats, influenza.
Similarly, Allegra, an allergy medication, combines the root word,
allergy, with a softer suffix, "gra," to create a name with a
soothing symmetry. Xenical, an anti-obesity drug, practically spells
out what it does: X's out calories.</TE>
<TE>   Other popular names "don't have a functional tie to the drug,"
Plaisance said. Viagra, for instance, evokes feelings of vigor, and
virility, and an association with the force of Niagara Falls. Then
there's Vantin, a new antibiotic whose name suggests benefit or
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "Every little sound carries with it a lot of symbolism," said Jim
Singer, president and creative director of NameBase/Medibrand in
Cardiff-by-the-Sea.</TE>
<TE>   After a drug company settles on a name, the firms check with
doctors, nurses and pharmacists to determine if the name might be
confused with other drugs. They typically hire linguists to make sure
the name has no negative or obscene meanings or connotations in other
languages. Lawyers check global trademark registries to prevent
copyright problems.</TE>
<TE>   The final step is getting clearance from the Food and Drug
Administration, which rejects about a third of the roughly 300 drug
name proposals submitted to the regulatory agency each year, said
Jerry Phillips, associate director of the FDA's Office of Drug
Safety. Common reasons for rejecting a new drug's name are that it is
too similar to another drug or that it overstates a product's
effectiveness, Phillips said.</TE>

<DH>Fiercely competing with each other and the Internet,
newsletters focus on specialized topics such as aging and women's
medicine</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today's consumers have a seemingly insatiable appetite for health
information. They find it via the Internet, television, radio,
newspapers, magazines and, in one of the most convenient forms,
newsletters.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of paid subscription newsletters, generally running eight
to 12 pages, are mailed directly to homes from hospitals,
universities and prominent doctors. Hundreds more are sent free by
organizations such as health plans as a promotional tool.</LD>
<LD>   Competition has been fierce. Over the past decade, as the
newsletters have multiplied, the primary players--usually those
published by major medical centers--have segued into more specialized
information, bringing their reputation for reliability to the hot
issues of aging, women's health and men's health.</LD>
<TE>   Not only have these publications helped fill the growing demand
for more specific information, they've managed to stay relevant as
consumers have become more savvy at extracting news from various
sources. The publications have benefited, editors and publishers say,
but so have consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "We realized you couldn't spend enough time talking about breast
cancer in a general health publication to meet the needs of some
women," said Ed Coburn, publishing director for Harvard Health
Publications. "In an eight-page monthly newsletter, you couldn't take
three pages talking about breast cancer, because you're not doing a
service for the other readers."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Anthony L. Komaroff, editor-in-chief of the Harvard Health
Publications, a division of the Harvard Medical School, said that in
launching the Harvard Women's Health Watch and other special
newsletters, the editors calculated that there were audiences for
generalized publications and more focused newsletters.</TE>
<TE>   They wagered, correctly, that while the more specialized
publications "would to some extent cannibalize" the general one, the
total number of subscribers would grow.</TE>
<TE>   The top circulation of the Harvard Health Letter was 432,000 in
the early 1990s. Today it's down to 150,000, but combined circulation
of all the publications stands at nearly 700,000, Komaroff said.</TE>
<TE>   There are now 125,000 subscriptions to the Harvard Heart Letter,
launched in 1990; 225,000 subscriptions to the Harvard Women's Health
Watch, launched in 1993; and the 125,000 subscriptions to the Harvard
Men's Health Watch, which premiered in 1996. The Harvard Mental
Health Letter, founded in 1984, has just under 60,000 subscribers,
mostly mental health professionals.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumer interests have become more focused over time," said
Andrew Thorne, of Englander Publications in Greenwich, Conn. The
for-profit publisher has teamed with noted hospitals in recent years,
launching several health newsletters.</TE>
<TE>   Informing Consumers</TE>
<TE>   About 20 years ago, Americans had few places to turn for general
health information besides their doctors. And doctors didn't always
want to share information with their patients, believing that they
were ill-equipped to understand the complexities of medicine. In the
1980s, organizations like the People's Medical Society began
encouraging consumers to become active participants in their
health-care decisions.</TE>
<TE>   That's when a flurry of newsletters made their debuts, bringing
valuable information directly into the mailboxes of consumers who
could read them at their leisure. The world-renowned Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., began its Mayo Health Letter in 1983; Tufts
University's Health &amp; Nutrition Letter debuted the same year. The
Wellness Letter followed from UC Berkeley's School of Public Health
in 1984; the Johns Hopkins Medical Letter Health After 50 in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   With the material vetted either by the institutions' faculty or
advisory boards, the newsletters gave subscribers paying about $30 a
year confidence they were getting solid information. At the same
time, the newsletters gave the institutions higher profiles. For
example, the Cleveland Clinic, a major center for cardiac care,
launched Heart Advisor in late 1997 and Men's Heart Advisor in
December 1998, boosting its name ID among consumers nationally and
internationally.</TE>
<TE>   Today, consumers might receive newsletters from their health plan,
their doctors or dentists, and nearby hospitals. Because "99.9% of
people get their medical care locally" and never get to a Mayo Clinic
or Cleveland Clinic, the local newsletters build brand recognition,
said Charles Inlander, president of the People's Medical Society, a
consumer health advocacy organization in Allentown, Pa. "When people
read that their local hospital is offering a new procedure or
treatment, they may think, 'This must be a good hospital because they
put out a newsletter.' "</TE>
<TE>   The information is helpful, Inlander says, but doesn't reflect
that "these are the same hospitals that are making medication errors,
giving you infections you shouldn't be getting and doing the wrong
diagnosis."</TE>
<TE>   Patients should be wary of newsletters created as a commercial
marketing ploy, warned Dr. Edward Hill, a family physician in Tupelo,
Miss., and chairman of the American Medical Assn. board. As an
example, he cited those designed to drum up business for bone-density
measuring technologies. "The science of bone density is all over the
board right now," Hill said. "The question is who needs to be checked
and who doesn't, and I don't think a newsletter can answer that for a
patient."</TE>
<TE>   However, newsletters can provide valuable general awareness about
conditions such as osteoporosis, doctors agree. When a patient asks a
doctor about something he or she has read in a newsletter and that
leads to a diagnosis, "there's a very positive health aspect," said
Dr. Martin Shapiro, chief of general internal medicine and health
services research at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Educated Readership</TE>
<TE>   The newsletters in general serve an affluent, educated population,
although many editors constantly re-evaluate the reading level of
their publications and some are considering ways to reach non-English
speaking consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the newsletters are provided by organizations that don't
provide direct patient care, but see themselves as having an
educational mission. One of them is the Massachusetts Medical
Society, which publishes the peer-reviewed New England Journal of
Medicine, one of medicine's most prestigious journals. For eight
years, the society has been putting out Health News, published
through Englander Publications with a circulation of about 85,000,
said executive editor Lloyd D. Resnick.</TE>
<TE>   Since the late 1990s, Englander has been publishing Cleveland
Clinic's Heart Advisor and the Cleveland Clinic's Men's Heart
Advisor, each with a circulation of 75,000. With Weill-Cornell
Medical College in New York, it launched Women's Health Advisor,
circulation 60,000, and the Food and Fitness Advisor, circulation
55,000. It also puts out Mount Sinai School of Medicine: Focus on
Healthy Aging, which has 85,000 subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Device and Drug Recalls</TE>
<TE>   Special interest groups also send newsletters, such as Public
Citizen Health Research Group's Health Letter, edited by Dr. Sidney
M. Wolfe, which takes strong positions on federal agency policies and
lists medical device and drug recalls in each issue, and Consumer
Reports' On Health, which provides a broad array of information and
guidance on self-care, medical tests and doctor visits. Many of the
newsletters initially feared competition when Internet sites began
delivering more consumer health information, Lindner said. "What
ended up happening was the Internet made it so easy, there were
really lots of junky sources out there, and many of those persist on
the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   According to Harvard's Komaroff, in about 1996-97, the free
information on the Internet cut into circulation not only of health
newsletters, but of competing publications, such as health reference
books. If free Internet information dries up, he said, it's possible
that newsletters and books will again be the vehicle by which more
people get comprehensive health information.</TE>
<TE>   In general, newsletter subscribers tend to be relatively affluent
older folks whose Internet use lags behind that of other age groups
and who are more comfortable with something they can hold in their
hand. "When all is said and done, a paper newsletter is wonderfully
portable and convenient to stick in your pocket and read wherever you
are," Coburn said.</TE>

<LD>Of the dozens of health-related newsletters, these are among the
oldest and most widely circulated:</LD>
<LD>   * Mayo Clinic Health Letter: This remains the biggest newsletter
from a major medical center and features full-color illustrations. It
has 750,000 subscribers, down from about 1 million at its peak.</LD>
<LD>   Mayo also publishes Women's Health Source, with a circulation of
280,000. A subscription is $27.</LD>
<TE>   Contact: Mayo Clinic Health Letter, Subscription Services, P.O.

<TE>   * The UC Berkeley Wellness Letter, from UC Berkeley's School of
Public Health, focuses on nutrition, fitness and preventive health.
Circulation has fallen from a peak of more than 1 million to 480,000
subscribers today. Readers are mostly female and older than 50, said
the editor, Dr. John Swartzberg.</TE>
<TE>   Swartzberg said the publication also helps readers navigate

300,000 subscribers, down from a peak of more than 400,000, said
Joann Rodgers, a spokeswoman for Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore.
The newsletter has spun off many other publications, including
quarterly bulletins on specific disorders and guides to drugs and
medical tests. A subscription is $28. Contact: Subscription
Department, Health After 50, P.O. Box 420179, Palm Coast, FL 32142,

subscribers. While other publications have narrowed their focus to
specialty areas, it has broadened its scope, said executive editor
Larry Lindner.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997 the Tufts University Diet &amp; Nutrition Letter changed its
name to the Tufts Health &amp; Nutrition Letter. "Readers wanted more
than nutrition from us. We always talked about exercise; fitness was
always a piece of it. Today I'm editing a piece on hearing aids."</TE>
<TE>   The newsletter aims to "translate the science from the lab so you
can use it in the kitchen, in the supermarket and in your life." A
subscription is $28 a year. Contact: Tufts Health &amp; Nutrition Letter,

<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Women 65 and older should be regularly screened for osteoporosis by
getting bone density tests, a government panel recommended on
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The recommendation, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine,
was issued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a panel of
health experts.</LD>
<LD>   The task force's 1996 report on bone-weakening osteoporosis said
there was not enough evidence to say whether routine screening is an
effective prevention tool. Since then, additional research has shown
there is a benefit, said Janet Allen, task force vice chairwoman.</LD>
<TE>   Low-dose X-rays of the hip to measure bone density generally cost
between $125 and $200, according to the task force. Many insurance
companies will not pay for the screening, though Medicare will cover
the hip test every two years for post-menopausal women if ordered by
a doctor. The task force said getting the test every five years is
probably adequate for women with normal bone density.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Food labels are supposed to make healthful choices easier, showing
the differences among products on supermarket shelves. In reality,
they can sometimes add to your confusion.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires most foods to carry
a "Nutrition Facts" label, which not only tells you how many calories
the food has per serving, but also the amount of fat, proteins,
carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins and minerals. Typically, this label is
printed on the back or side of the package.</LD>
<LD>   The agency also imposes strict limitations on the marketing claims
that manufacturers can place anywhere on their packages. Even the
meaning of specific words is controlled. For example, when a
manufacturer uses the words "no" or "free" on a package--as in "no
fat" or "cholesterol-free"--the food must contain none, or only a
trivial amount, of the nutrient described. By law, a fat-free product
must contain less than half a gram of fat per serving; "calorie-free"
products must contain fewer than 5 calories in a serving.</LD>
<TE>   In spite of these regulations, many claims on food packages seem,
at best, confusing and, at worst, downright misleading. What's the
harm? Someone who is trying to lower his or her cholesterol could end
up with a high-fat product despite a "reduced fat" label; a person
attempting to lose weight might end up with a "light" product that is
highly caloric. The problem is well illustrated by the following
examples, which we found during a recent trip through a Los Angeles
supermarket.</TE>
<TE>   Under the regulations, a "light" product must contain at least
one-third fewer calories or half the fat of the product with which it
is being compared. When we compared one brand of "light" chocolate
ice cream to its "regular" counterpart, the "light" product did
contain 50% less fat than the "regular" (3 grams compared with 6).
However, the two products didn't differ much calorically: A serving
of "light" ice cream was only 10 calories lighter than a portion of
the regular (140 compared with 150). The same was true of Jolly Time
"Butter-Licious" popcorn. The "original" version contains 140
calories and 9 grams of fat per unpopped serving; the "light" popcorn
delivers 120 calories and 6 grams of fat. And a tablespoon of Blue
Bonnet "light" margarine is indeed lower in calories than Blue Bonnet
"regular" (50 versus 80), but nonetheless, 100% of the calories are
from fat--and there's nothing light about that.</TE>
<TE>   "Reduced" is another term that can be misleading. "Reduced-fat,"
for example, does not necessarily mean low in fat, and
"reduced-calorie" does not guarantee that a food is low in calories.
For example: Skippy Reduced-Fat Peanut Butter does have 25% less fat
than regular Skippy but still derives more than half its total
calories from fat (one serving--just two tablespoons--contains 12
grams fat, or almost 20% of the average recommended daily intake). A
serving of Reduced-Fat Kraft Singles gets 60% of its calories from
fat.</TE>
<TE>   Other terms to be cautious about include "fewer" or "less." These
are relative terms and should always lead you to ask: "Fewer or less
than what?" Farmer John sells sausage patties that are 30% less fat
than regular sausages: However, just one serving still contains 100
calories, 70 of which come from fat.</TE>
<TE>   Even seemingly absolute terms such as "free" or "no" can be
deceiving. A product that is "sugar-free" may still be highly
caloric: One serving of Mothers Sugar-Free Shortbread Cookies, for
example, contains 160 calories, half of which come from fat. And a
food that contains "no cholesterol" could still be high in fat if
it's made with lots of vegetable oil.</TE>
<TE>   Also, standardized terms are sometimes used in unorthodox ways on
food packaging. For example, meat labeled as "lean" is restricted in
the amount of fat and cholesterol it can contain; meat described as
"70% lean" may contain significantly more. (One package of ground
beef we saw in the supermarket was labeled as 70% lean; it contained
34 grams of total fat per serving and derived almost 80% of total
calories from fat.)</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes it's not the claims on the box you need to worry about;
it's the names of the products themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Based solely on the name, a consumer might assume that Nabisco's
"Vegetable Thins" Baked Snack Crackers were relatively low in fat and
vitamin-rich. Not so. These crackers may be baked, but half their
calories come from fat. And, although they do contain carrots,
cabbage, peppers, and tomatoes, a review of the nutrition label shows
that there is more shortening than vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   So, how do you keep from falling for these legal--but
misleading--claims and names? The simple answer: Don't put anything
into your shopping cart before reading the "Nutrition Facts" food
label on the package. Use this label to help you select foods that
are reasonably low in calories and fat. Also, use the label to find
foods that are rich in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber and low
in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium.</TE>
<TE>   Reading these labels may prolong your shopping by a few minutes
but will help you make better decisions about the foods you put in
your body.</TE>

<HD>Reeve's Progress Brings Hope, Reminders of Tough Realities</HD>
<DH>Disability* Actor's partial recovery renews dilemma-- focus
on a far-off cure, or help typical spinal injury patients make it
through the day?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He's a real-life hero, a compelling advocate, an inspiration. Yet
some say his dramatic story could distract us from the realities of
ordinary people living with a disability.</LD>
<LD>   Christopher Reeve's partial recovery from a severe 1995 spinal
injury, the subject of a television special and a new book released
last week, prompted a range of responses, from glee to caution, among
the community of spinal cord injury advocates and patients. It has
also helped to reignite debate about how best to treat paralysis and
recovery.</LD>
<LD>   "Most people are very excited, but some are skeptical and feel the
story is being oversold," said Dr. Wise Young, a neuroscientist at
Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., who hosts a popular
Internet site for spinal injury patients. Hundreds of e-mails about
the Reeve story have been posted on his Web site, Carecure
(http://carecure.rutgers.edu/Spinewire/index.html), and his clinic
has received a flood of phone calls.</LD>
<TE>   For years, there has been debate among the disabled about how best
to spend precious resources: Should more be spent on finding a cure
for spinal injury, which most researchers say is still many years
away, or on easing the daily hardships of the estimated 200,000
Americans disabled by injuries? Since Reeve's accident, suffered when
he was thrown from a horse at an equestrian event, he has focused
much of his efforts on advocating for a cure.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's TV special "Christopher Reeve: Courageous
Steps"--detailing  how the actor, with years of assisted exercise and
the help of specialist doctors and nurses, regained some movement and
sensation--threatens to overshadow the daily reality for many people,
some with spinal injuries said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to understand that 99.9% of the people with spinal cord
injuries have no way to do what he did," said Royce Hamrick, 61, of
San Diego, an advocate for the disabled who lost feeling from his
chest down after a gunshot injury 15 years ago. "We don't have the
resources; we don't have the connections. What Chris has done is
wonderful. I just think that for a lot of us, we need help living as
we are, dealing with chronic pain, with unemployment. Many people
disabled by spinal cord injuries are living below the poverty level."</TE>
<TE>   Wes Combs, a spokesman for Reeve, said the actor is committed both
to finding a cure and improving daily care. "He believes the issues
of care and cure are not mutually exclusive," Combs said. "Just
because he has focused some attention on research for a cure does not
mean he doesn't believe the here and now is not a priority.... He
can't control how the media handles his story."</TE>
<TE>   Spinal cord injuries often strike people in their prime, between
ages 16 and 30, in car accidents or violence, leaving them
able-minded but often suddenly unable to remain on their jobs or find
new employment. Only about 30% of paraplegics are employed, and many
rely on Medicaid and other federal programs to meet basic needs,
researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   In a media conference call last week, Reeve acknowledged that his
treatment regimen was beyond the means of most patients. "The problem
that we still have yet is that insurance companies are very reluctant
to pay" for these therapies, he said. Combs said the cost of Reeve's
care, including physical therapy and all other expenses, is about
$400,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The actor suffered what's called a C-2 injury, designating the
spinal vertebrae that Reeve damaged; a C-2 injury interferes with
breathing and is often fatal. He had no substantial recovery in the
five years after the accident, and there was no evidence suggesting
he could improve, according to one of Reeve's physicians, Dr. John
McDonald, a spinal rehabilitation specialist at Washington University
in St. Louis. The physical therapy program, designed by McDonald and
which Reeve has participated in since 1999, is considered
experimental.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, insurers will pay for one to two months of hospital
time, which includes rehabilitation therapy but not experimental
treatments. A person's odds for recovery are difficult to predict,
but they drop dramatically if there is no return of feeling or
movement after the first few months, doctors said. Some people
recover sensation and movement of arms and fingers as long as two
years after their injury, Rutgers' Young said, but it does not happen
often. Recovery is more likely to occur in people whose spinal nerves
have been damaged but not ripped apart and entirely severed from the
brain.</TE>
<TE>   Because it's often impossible to tell whether patients retain
intact nerves, doctors have no reliable way to predict who will
recover sensation. Some people may rehab and exercise for years and
see no improvement, while others can get some feeling back for no
apparent reason, Young said. If, after a month or two, there is no
functional improvement--in movement of the hands or legs, for
instance--the patient is said to "plateau."</TE>
<TE>   "This is the point at which we have to make a decision about how
much more a patient is going to recover, and how much time and effort
that's going to take," said Claire Beekman, manager of spinal cord
physical therapy at Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in Downey, one
of the country's leading rehab centers.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point we need to prepare people for what their life is
going to be like, and try to set things up so they can work to
recover on their own."</TE>
<TE>   Reeve pays for his own treatment, he said, which includes 24-hour
nursing care; a special exercise bicycle he uses regularly to
stimulate leg muscles and nerves; and visits to several of the top
spinal rehabilitation doctors in the country. By all accounts, the
actor has worked like an Olympian, never relenting even two years
after his injury, when recovery of sensation or movement is extremely
rare. The stimulation and exercise regimen is based on the
observation, in animal and human studies, that even a broken spinal
cord can somehow learn or remember patterned motions, such as
walking.</TE>
<TE>   Although the brain gives the command to begin walking, the spinal
cord coordinates the motion, said Dr. V. Reggie Edgerton, a professor
of physiological science and neurobiology at UCLA, who has
demonstrated the phenomenon in animals. Repeating the motion
artificially somehow jump-starts the spine's ability to execute the
motion, apparently without the help of the brain. "I don't think
anyone would pretend to know exactly how this happens," he said. "
... I sometimes refer to it as the smart spine."</TE>
<TE>   Some with spine injuries wonder about the implications of exercise
treatment. Some people "think the news [about Reeve] means that
patients just need to quit being lazy and do the same therapies he's
involved in. I don't have the money or manpower," wrote one
subscriber to Young's Internet site.</TE>
<TE>   "Is the therapy worth paying for? Is it effective for everyone?"
asked Edgerton. "These are good questions. But they are only being
raised as a result of knowing that this is possible, by seeing what
Mr. Reeve has done. That in itself is very significant."</TE>

<HD>Treat Driver's Licenses as What They Are: Domestic
Passports</HD>
<DH>Impose federal card standards to boost security.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMITAI ETZIONI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California Gov. Gray Davis is weighing whether to sign a bill that
would allow illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses. But
Washington, not Sacramento, should set the rules. While we hate to
admit it, the driver's license has become a de facto national ID
card. As such, we must make it more reliable by setting a federal
standard for its issuance.</LD>
<LD>   Without an ID, it is impossible to board an airplane or enter many
public buildings and private places of commerce. Most of the time,
that ID is a driver's license.</LD>
<LD>   There are two ways we avoid acknowledging the true nature of
driver's licenses. We can claim that they are not state-imposed
because there are no penalties for refusing to get one. If you
believe this, either your city has a terrific public transportation
system or you're rich, retired or homebound. Or, we can claim that a
driver's license is not a national document because licenses are
issued by the 50 states and the District of Columbia. But licenses
issued by one state are honored by all others, so they are, like it
or not, domestic passports.</LD>
<TE>   And just as well. If Sept. 11 has taught us anything, it is that
we must be able to identify people. All the watch lists of suspected
terrorists that the FBI, CIA and Immigration and Naturalization
Service are developing are of little use if we cannot tell who is
whom.</TE>
<TE>   The INS has introduced a program under which U.S. colleges and
other schools are required to report to the federal government
whether enrolled foreign students have shown up. But if these young
men and women do not show up, and perhaps are taking flying lessons
instead of studying English literature, how are we to find them if no
one is required to carry a national ID card?</TE>
<TE>   Here's the main rub: Each state makes its own rules for issuing
licenses; each decides how much or how little documentation is
required to verify that the person receiving one of these de facto
national ID cards really is whom he or she claims to be.</TE>
<TE>   The situation is akin to that of the early 18th century, when many
jurisdictions were free to issue their own currency and the people
who traded in it had to trust that various tenders were worth the
paper on which they were printed.</TE>
<TE>   Accepting the idea of a national ID card and implementing it would
do more than help catch those on a terrorist watch list. For example,
it could help find criminals on the lam, keep sex offenders who had
served their sentences from working at child-care centers and prevent
people from collecting benefits at multiple government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   As on the new 25-cent coins, each state can depict its own
traditions and symbols, but the licenses' reliability and
authenticity would be guaranteed by the same federal standard.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, put a bear on mine and an orange on Jeb Bush's, but enact
the bill introduced by Reps. James P. Moran (D-Va.) and Thomas M.
Davis (R-Va.) that would require that all driver's licenses and other
state-issued identification cards have computer chips containing
biometric data, encryption and other tamper-resistant security
measures.</TE>
<TE>   We could keep 50 databases to please civil libertarians and
states-rights die-hards, as long as federal law enforcement
authorities were allowed ready access to them. However, if we have
outgrown such games, we must acknowledge that we need a national
database if these IDs are to do their essential job. After all, if
one state grants an illegal immigrant a license, all the others will
have to live with the consequences.</TE>

<HD>Filling Societies With Informers Won't Stop Terror</HD>
<DH>Government-fed paranoia could hurt Colombia-- and the U.S.
too.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>Something new and disturbing is taking place in a nation where
disturbing news is tragically common. The government of Colombian
President Alvaro Uribe has instituted a national program called
"Reward Mondays." Every Monday, Colombians who provided authorities
with information that helped prevent acts of violence the previous
week go to the local town hall, military post or police precinct to
collect their reward. They are members of Uribe's new army of
informants, part of the president's plan to help bring an end to
decades of relentless bloodshed.</LD>
<LD>   After just a few weeks, Uribe's government has handed out millions
of pesos--tens of thousands of dollars--to people who reportedly
provided information about dozens of unspecified operations by
leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and common criminals.</LD>
<LD>   As the United States has its first unsettling experiences with
citizens reporting suspicious activities, such as the case of the
three medical students allegedly overheard in a Georgia restaurant
making remarks about possible terrorist violence, Colombia is
offering an example of the wrong way to involve the public in the war
against terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Although citizens must and should report suspicious acts, civilian
participation in the war on terror could end up tearing the fabric of
society.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe, who was elected with a powerful popular mandate to end the
nation's 38-year guerrilla war, is keeping one of his campaign
promises: to develop a network of as many as a million informants to
help the army's cause. Civilians make up an integral part of
Colombia's many-sided war and have become the frequent targets of
paramilitary forces and guerrilla groups, who routinely go after
civilians who they claim have provided aid and comfort to their
enemies.</TE>
<TE>   The urgent need is to protect civilians, not to provide more
reasons for the combatants to target them.</TE>
<TE>   Last year some 4,000 civilians were killed and an additional 3,000
were kidnapped. In the last decade, at least 30,000 noncombatants
have been killed. Uribe has survived four assassination attempts, and
his father was murdered by guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   In a country with such a blood-soaked history, with no shortage of
grudges and feuds, offering money to anonymous tipsters provides the
perfect vehicle for personal revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Just ask the people of the old Soviet Union and its former
communist satellites. Millions of them lived in a world where
snitching was a way of life. Neighbors were spying on neighbors,
relatives telling on relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia is far from that, and the U.S. has not yet entered the
danger zone. But both countries are trying to utilize the  public to
stop terror. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft raised the ire of concerned
Americans with a plan to enlist a million mail carriers, cable
installers and others to spy on the rest of us.</TE>
<TE>   In Colombia, the mayor of Bogota, Antanas Mockus, announced that
the capital city would not join in Reward Mondays. Mockus said the
plan was a bad idea that would make civilians even more vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he pointed out, good citizens don't need money to do
their duty. "Every citizen," he said, "has the constitutional, moral
and patriotic responsibility to contact authorities if he has
information that a crime will be committed."</TE>
<TE>   Terrorism poses heart-wrenching dilemmas for the societies it
attacks. The question is how to best use the vigilance of the public
without spawning vigilantism or opening the gates to the most
destructive forms of prejudice. The answer is definitely not a system
like Reward Mondays.</TE>
<TE>   The answer lies in providing more information to the public about
what sorts of signs we should look for.</TE>
<TE>   A certain degree of profiling--ethnic or otherwise--will come into
play, but we should learn to go well beyond that. Seeing swarthy,
bearded men is not reason enough to call the police. In Israel, where
citizens have foiled scores of terrorist attacks, the police have
offered guidelines on how to spot terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Handing all citizens the ability to sic the police on anyone they
please would overwhelm the police and could leave us with a different
kind of country, one not much worth defending.</TE>

<HD>Iraq's a Loose Cannon, So U.S. Must Fire First</HD>
<DH>Western ideas of deterrence don't apply to Hussein.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AVIGDOR HASELKORN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Look for the agendas behind the words of those who came out in praise
of Saddam Hussein's agreement to readmit the United Nations arms
inspectors into Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, for example, sees reaffirmation
of the role of the United Nations and the principle of collective
security. Amr Moussa, the secretary-general of the Arab League, seeks
to spare Iraq a crushing military defeat that could tip the regional
strategic balance toward Israel. China, Russia and France have their
own political, diplomatic and economic motives.</LD>
<LD>   But all have one thing in common: Stopping Hussein is secondary to
their prime interest, which is controlling the Bush administration.
All are afraid that a resounding American military victory in Iraq
would encourage additional such moves to consolidate U.S. global
supremacy.</LD>
<TE>   And yet the bottom line is that there is no way to deal with the
likes of Hussein other than a preemptive strike. Here is why:</TE>
<TE>   First, Hussein's actions cannot be explained using Western
strategic concepts such as deterrence. For example, during the 1991
Gulf War, Hussein repeatedly attacked Israeli population centers
despite grave and ominous warnings from Israel.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Lt. Gen. Charles A. Horner, commander of the U.S. Air
Force in the Persian Gulf, wrote that "Saddam Hussein, in many ways,
was indifferent to nuclear weapons. In fact, sometimes I wonder if he
really was not looking for Israel to throw a nuclear weapon at him."</TE>
<TE>   Further, months before he went into Kuwait, precipitating the Gulf
crisis, Hussein declared publicly that he had delegated to his
military commanders the authority to launch weapons of mass
destruction against Israel. Accordingly, they were authorized to fire
such weapons at Israel if they suspected an atomic attack on Iraq and
could not communicate with their superiors.</TE>
<TE>   While many analysts questioned the veracity of this extraordinary
claim, given Hussein's notorious distrust of his military and the
impact of this posture on Israel's incentive to preempt, it is now
known that the Iraqi leader did indeed do this. One shudders to think
what could have happened during Desert Storm, when Iraqi command and
control links were systematically severed, if an Iraqi commander had
misunderstood his situation.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in 1991, two weeks before the launching of the ground war
by the coalition forces, Hussein started targeting the Israeli
nuclear reactor in Dimona. This was not an act of last resort but one
of deliberate escalation. And while Iraq's Scud missiles were too
crude to hit any specific target in Israel, Hussein's actions cannot
be viewed as entirely rational under the circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Little wonder that Israeli authorities have begun distributing
potassium iodide pills to people residing in the vicinity of the
country's two nuclear reactors, to provide some protection against
radiation fallout in the event of a new Iraqi attack.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the Sept. 11 attacks must be seen as shattering our
traditional strategic concepts. The launching of devastating attacks
from long distances using only primitive tactics and weapons and the
zeal of martyrdom seekers puts into question our ability to rely on
sophisticated militaries to defend ourselves. In contrast to Western
beliefs in restraint and strategic deterrence, both Hussein and Osama
bin Laden have shown that power is what one is willing to use.</TE>
<TE>   And consider this about the critics of President Bush's lonely
insistence on a preemptive doctrine: None faces the threat of
determined zealots armed with weapons of mass destruction to the
extent that the United States does. Thus the alternate diplomatic and
political "solutions" advanced so far are simply irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   A strategy of preemption might be militarily risky and politically
costly. Yet it is the only strategy that addresses directly the new
threats facing the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   While, for political reasons, the U.S. may want to be seen as
acting on the basis of the collective will of the international
community, this is not the best choice from a strategic perspective.
The more the U.S. acts unilaterally and the greater the perception
that the U.S. is an unchecked and unpredictable power, the better it
is for U.S. security and for world peace.</TE>

<HD>Don't Be Cruel</HD>
<DH>Give Elvis a break: No image can stand up to 35,000 fat
wannabes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOBBI MURRAY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Tuesday, a compilation of 30 No. 1 Elvis Presley hits will be
released, thus marketing him to another generation of listeners, the
same way "The Beatles 1" was aimed at people who thought the group
was Paul McCartney's backup band.</LD>
<LD>   Elvis has plenty of image baggage to overcome with the folks in
his new target market. But Lord knows it's not all his fault. The
real trouble is those Elvis impersonators. This may infuriate what
we'll call here "the Elvis impersonator community," but they make
Elvis look like a geek and give the rest of us the creeps. There are
an estimated 35,000 Elvis impersonators worldwide and, sad to say,
they seem to overwhelmingly skew toward the dumpy. Just because there
was once such a thing as a chunky Elvis doesn't mean that any
sideburned pudgy guy wedged into a white jumpsuit should feel like he
can be the King.</LD>
<LD>   Poor Elvis didn't balloon like that until the very last few years
of his life. It caused him such consternation that he once ditched
his regular doctor for a quack in Las Vegas who put him under for a
week as a weight-loss scheme. Imagine the chagrin of the once
visually stunning Elvis if he knew now that 35,000 chubby guys insist
on imitating him at his physical nadir.</LD>
<TE>   Now you are thinking: "Uh-oh, another deranged Elvis fan." Elvis
fans do creep people out. Those guys who are not full-fledged
impersonators but still affect a weird ducktail?--unnerving. And I
will admit that recently at Graceland I talked with a guy from
Illinois about his plans to stay over in his uncle's double-wide
trailer.</TE>
<TE>   I can claim some authority on the issue of Elvis fans after, I'm
sorry to report, standing with 35,000 of them in a gusting, driving,
hourlong thunderstorm outside Graceland on Aug. 15 for the vigil that
marked the 25th anniversary of Elvis' death. So here's the bulletin:
Most Elvis fans don't believe that he is still alive and buying
Little Debbie cakes at the 7-Eleven in Akron, Ohio. They know and
regret that he shuffled off this mortal coil in a sudden and
undignified manner.</TE>
<TE>   Fan factoid No. 2: Many, many Elvis fans are not from
Westbyjeeminy, Miss. Vigil participants included Swedes for Elvis,
Danes for Elvis and, like everywhere else, herds of French with no
discernible alliance. I admit it crossed my mind, as I approached my
seventh hour in line, that there's no annual vigil of this scale for
Martin Luther King Jr. or Cesar Chavez, or probably even Gandhi. Not
to mention that I've never waited in line so long to see a guy who
was still alive.</TE>
<TE>   You remember when Chris Rock made endless fun of Jennifer Lopez's
rear end? Girlfriend ran right out and whittled it to such enviable
proportions that women now ask their plastic surgeons for a J.Lo
butt.</TE>
<TE>   Elvis happened before all that star self-awareness. As the first
huge multimedia star, he didn't know to hide when he looked unseemly.
These days, Elvis would know what to do; hell, even "Colonel" Tom
Parker would get himself a little lipo.</TE>
<TE>   Why rehab Elvis' image? It's not that I care about Elvis CD sales;
it's just annoying when so many writers take cheap shots at him, as
creative as making fun of the fat kid in class. I rejected Elvis for
years because of the way he made hits covering black artists' music.
The story of how black artists were used up and discarded is an old
and ugly one; Elvis' early Sun Records recordings certainly owe a
debt to Little Junior Parker, Smiley Lewis and Willie Mae "Big Mama"
Thornton. Elvis owes them, but he also owes Bill Monroe and Hank
Williams--"Blue Moon of Kentucky," "Good Rockin' Tonight," even
"That's All Right, Mama" are all loaded with the sound once snidely
called hillbilly.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Guralnick, Elvis' biographer, calls the mix "vernacular
music," the music of the scorned, and points out that without Elvis,
the American mainstream would never have heard the genius of either
Muddy Waters or Hank Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Elvis took American music, made it something different, made us
appreciate it. So let him speak for himself and give him a listen.
Don't worry, it doesn't mean that you'll suddenly become a ducktailed
sucker for Elvis. If you do, book your flight to the next vigil now;
it's cheaper that way.</TE>

<HD>A Seashore for the Rich Few</HD>
<DH>A study that could lead to greater access deserves
good-faith consideration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This week, like last, surf crashes onto the public sand in front of
the private homes along the Malibu coast. But many of the
public-access pathways through this exclusive real estate remain
padlocked, leaving would-be beachcombers and families in boogie
board-laden minivans staring through chain link at the seashore that,
under California law, is theirs to enjoy.</LD>
<LD>   Two recent changes should eventually get beachgoers past those
Malibu gates, allowing planners to turn their attention to problems
facing an even more critical stretch of coast north of Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   SB 1962 by Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) requires the state
to start taking title to some of hundreds of possible right-of-way
paths before they revert to landowners. And the Coastal Commission
has OKd a land-use plan for Malibu that will force open more pathways
to the sea as well as protect some of the few remaining patches of
open space along that stretch of coast.</LD>
<TE>   Now federal and state resource agencies should turn their
attention immediately to Gaviota and one of the last undeveloped
stretches of Southern California shore.</TE>
<TE>   There, the bulldozers that have chewed big chunks of the state's
1,100-mile coastline into so many home parcels are idle for the
moment. Pelicans dive and fog crawls through the
oak-and-chaparral-covered hills that rise steeply from U.S. Highway
101. But landowners have big plans.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Congress ordered the National Park Service to
study the creation of a national seashore on the 200,000 acres that
spread northward from UC Santa Barbara to Vandenberg Air Force Base.
The magic words "national seashore" would protect the 46 miles of
remote beaches, cliffs and grasslands by limiting development and
making it easier for public agencies to buy land for permanent
conservation.</TE>
<TE>   Property owners in gated Hollister Ranch, a community of large
estates in the coastal zone, have tried three times to scuttle this
study in court. When litigation failed, many Hollister homeowners
chipped in to hire a Washington lobbyist to badmouth the study.
Meanwhile, some ranchette owners reportedly patrol "their" eight
miles of beachfront, driving off at gunpoint surfers who arrived by
boat to ride waves to the shore.</TE>
<TE>   What seems to incense Gaviota's landowners is that folks who
aren't rich or lucky think they have a right to feel waves slosh on
their ankles and breathe the scent of salt air and sage. So far
(surprise!) the rich and powerful few are getting their way.</TE>
<TE>   A first draft of the national seashore study won't be ready until
January. But already the Bush administration seems to have dismissed
any such plan. "Land acquisition," an Interior Department official
said last month, "is not a priority of this administration."</TE>
<TE>   Sad. The amount of beachfront on which the average Californian can
toss a Frisbee, build a sand castle or simply seek solace is
shrinking, even as the state's population explodes.</TE>
<TE>   After years of coastal warfare in Malibu, Californians deserve a
good-faith look at the seashore proposal, not another dispiriting
demonstration that money trumps the public's rights down by the sea.</TE>

<LD>As scheduled, Los Angeles County shuttered nine of its 18 health-care
clinics this month. Two more will close at the end of September in
what will probably be an increasingly painful series of cuts intended
to ease the county's health department deficit. Ever-rising costs and
an ever-increasing population without insurance have profoundly
strained the county's safety-net service, which provides health care
for the poor as well as emergency and trauma care for all county
residents.</LD>
<LD>   Into such a bleak situation a joint effort by California teachers
and a statewide insurance trade group injects a rare ray of relief.
The California Teachers Assn. and the California Assn. of Health
Plans, with a grant from the nonprofit California Endowment, are
mounting a campaign to enroll eligible children in government health
plans.</LD>
<LD>   Statewide, 1 million children have no medical insurance, according
to a UCLA survey released in June. More than half--650,000--are
eligible for Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, or another
low-income plan called Healthy Families, but their parents don't
realize it. In Los Angeles County alone, 242,000 out of more than
300,000 uninsured children qualify but are not enrolled.</LD>
<TE>   With Medi-Cal or Healthy Families coverage, these kids would be
able to receive private care rather than being left to seek help at
the dwindling number of county clinics--or getting no care at all.
Even if they continued to go to one of the seven county clinics still
open or to another nonprofit clinic, their coverage would contribute
to keeping these crucial community assets solvent.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, teachers already are overburdened with requests to deliver
social services that go beyond teaching reading and arithmetic. Focus
groups showed that they wanted to get involved, though, because they
recognized the link between good health and learning. They won't be
expected to recite the regulations or walk parents through the
application process but will pass out information and offer
referrals.</TE>
<TE>   Their effort alone isn't going to save the troubled health-care
system. Nor will it relieve state and federal agencies from dealing
with the huge number of adults and the remaining children without
medical insurance, a crisis that government has for too long left to
underfunded counties. But it is the kind of involvement and
innovation that that public and the private sectors alike must show
to keep the safety net from collapsing entirely.</TE>

<LD>Lawyers must remember that shareholders, not the corporate executives
who sign their paychecks, own the company. It's a distinction that
some lawyers have forgotten and one that the Securities and Exchange
Commission must heed as it creates standards of professional conduct
for securities lawyers.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers were in the room when corporate executives, board members
and accountants created the unsavory environment that led to Enron's
implosion and the subsequent wave of corporate scandals. Some of the
nation's most prestigious law firms played a role in destroying the
credibility of the financial markets by looking the other way or by
signing off on dubious, at best, legal opinions.</LD>
<LD>   Some lawyers argue that federal standards would jeopardize
attorney-client privilege. Others cite the potential for conflicts of
interest. But it's doubtful that conflicts of interest will arise or
that attorney-client privilege will be breached if lawyers remember
whom their clients are. As Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) has said, it's
time to confront lawyers who "get to thinking that playing squash
with the CEO every week is more important than keeping faith with the
shareholders every day."</LD>
<TE>   Lawyers long have maintained that the profession can police its
ranks with voluntary standards. But simply hoping that lawyers will
do the right thing isn't enough. Federal prosecutors this month
alleged that Tyco International's chief corporate counsel falsified
business records to conceal $14 million in company loans used to buy
homes.</TE>
<TE>   Allegations of criminal activity by lawyers are just part of the
problem. Investors also must be confident that lawyers are not using
their legal acumen to craft opinions that fill the letter of
securities law but hide potentially damaging information.</TE>
<TE>   The American Bar Assn. maintains that its voluntary rules, which
form the foundation for most state bar review panels, will do the
job. The SEC has for years referred questionable activity by lawyers
to state bar committees for review and sanctions. But during a recent
speech, SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt told the ABA he was "not
impressed or pleased" by the response when disciplinary cases are
referred to state bar groups.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC owes shareholders a tough set of standards that focuses on
ethical behavior. Simply meeting minimum legal requirements is no
longer enough.</TE>

<LD>Your Sept. 19 editorial about helping the homeless off the streets
and a related front-page story ("Skid Row Hotels Stack Deck With
'Shuffle' ") were (ironically?) complemented by another article on a
luxury kennel for cats ("Activist Sees New City as Fresh Start for
Pets"). How sad that we live in a city--nay, a country--with such a
disheartening disparity of income distribution. Am I the only one who
finds it sickening that many animals enjoy better lives than humans
do?</LD>

<TE>   A commendation is in order for Sheriff Lee Baca for hosting a
summit on homelessness at the Central Library in downtown Los Angeles
(Sept. 18). It is shocking to discover that L.A. County has the
highest number of people without shelter, according to several
studies. In a Sept. 15 letter, Cardinal Roger Mahony asked that
readers come up with suggested topics that might be discussed at the
new conference center at Our Lady of the Angels Cathedral. May I
respectfully suggest that Mahony and his benefactors take a stroll
down Los Angeles Street--starting at about 1st Street and extending
to 6th Street. I think anyone who does that will get the point that
this is a problem that should have the highest priority.</TE>

<LD>"Palestinian Blast Kills Israeli, Ends a Lull in Suicide Bombings"
(Sept. 19) correctly points out that there was a big gap prior to the
Sept. 18 suicide bombing in Israel. What is overlooked is that during
that gap, many potential bombers were caught before anyone was
killed. Either Israel is getting better at prevention or is getting
luckier. Either way, the terror is not winding down.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In calling for mercy for Stanley "Tookie" Williams, one of the
co-founders of the Crips, Lewis Yablonsky writes that the former L.A.
gangster could be a force for good (Commentary, Sept. 19). He also
writes that the man has "totally changed his attitude about gang
violence."</LD>
<LD>   Williams is not on death row because of his attitudes about gang
violence. He's on death row because he murdered four people in
robberies. I also have no doubt that his being a co-founder of the
Crips and thus having the blood of many thousands of men, women and
children on his hands might also have influenced the jury that
sentenced him to death. Williams will be a far greater force for good
by the example his execution demonstrates than he ever could be by
writing children's stories or preaching to wayward youth about the
perils of gang membership.</LD>
<LD>   I also found Yablonsky's arguments for mercy to be disingenuous,
like most of the arguments the anti-death penalty people make when
they almost always fail to mention the hideous crimes these people
perpetrated.</LD>
<TE>   For me, when someone blows a woman's brains out or mocks the death
sounds a completely innocent person makes when being fatally shot,
well, that person needs a lethal injection. I hope California has the
good sense and decency to do just that, as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Bright</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Conspicuous by its absence in Yablonsky's plea for mercy for
Williams is any mention of why he's facing the death chamber. Did
Tookie get the death penalty for insider trading? Running a red
light? Smoking in the middle of the Mojave Desert? If it's for any of
these felonies, I'm jumping on the Tookie bandwagon. If, however,
it's for a quadruple homicide or something of that nature, then,
well, adios, Tookie.</TE>

<LD>In "Crisis of '62 Calls to Bush" (Commentary, Sept. 19), Lawrence
Korb compares the current Iraqi crisis to the Cuban missile crisis in
1962. But there is a big difference between these two events. In 1962
Fidel Castro was capable of and could fire ballistic missiles with
nuclear warheads supplied by the Soviet Union into most of our
cities. A subsequent all-out nuclear war with the Soviet Union was
also a possibility.</LD>
<LD>   Today, even if the mad Saddam Hussein wants to commit suicide by
attacking the U.S., he has not even developed a single nuclear bomb.
Besides, he has no long-range missiles to deliver them. The real
reason the Bush administration wants a war with Iraq may well be to
take voters' minds off the bad economy and get President Bush
reelected as the beneficiary of being a wartime president.</LD>
<LD>   Bing Feng</LD>
<TE>   Rowland Heights</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oh, the whining! Those who are more concerned about Bush
alienating potential allies on Iraq than leading them should remember
the forcefulness of a former president, who, with equal bravado,
ended the Cold War and set in motion the forces that ridded the world
of the threat of communism. While politeness has its place and time,
it sometimes takes a heavy hand to get a job done.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I agree, "We Need Answers, Mr. Bush" (editorial, Sept. 20). I hope
Congress asks these important questions before it passes the
administration's resolution for action on Iraq. I would add one more:
What will this war cost in human life? What is an acceptable number
of casualities, both American and innocent civilians, to make a
regime change in Iraq? More than 50,000 Americans and countless
civilians died in Vietnam and the only regime change that occurred
was in South Vietnam. Questions need to be asked and answered.</TE>
<TE>   Robert T. Dalton</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Among the many points in his thoughtful Sept. 15 Opinion piece,
Jay Taylor carefully charts the path we, as Americans, must take
between restraint and retaliation in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy.
His even-tempered evaluation that there is, as yet, little concrete
evidence supporting Iraqi involvement in the tragedy underscores the
need for caution when considering a military option against Hussein.
When even our strongest allies have suggested that 9/11 may have
occurred partly, if not largely, as a result of a dysfunctional U.S.
foreign policy toward the Arab world, then how will such a policy be
improved by engaging in "preemptive" war with Iraq without just
cause?</TE>
<TE>   We cannot afford to be hasty with our response to terrorist
threats. As a Muslim, I try to remind myself of this by reflecting
upon the beautiful verse from the Old Testament: "Every purpose is
established by counsel: and with good advice make war" (Proverbs
20:18).</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To oppose war with Iraq based upon a fear that it will result in a
large-scale increase in the number of people willing to participate
in terrorism is tantamount to giving in to blackmail. It's safer to
assume that a nation with the particular atrocity-filled history that
Iraq has is secretly building a nuclear bomb. The risk of assuming
otherwise is just plain foolish.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Simon Lends $4 Million to Campaign," Sept. 19: Republican
gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon calling Gov. Gray Davis "shameless"
gives new meaning to the word "hypocritical." Could Simon be any more
self-serving? His campaign's mortality was just demonstrated in the
form of a $4-million "loan" by Simon to his own campaign.</LD>
<LD>   If he were so confident in his chances to reach Sacramento, the $4
million would have been a donation rather than a loan. Instead, Simon
fronted the money to buy TV air time in a last-ditch effort to sway
some urgently needed votes. Given this latest move, if Simon does not
win the November election, I'd say his welcome with the Republican
Party will be as warm and fuzzy as the embrace currently enjoyed by
Dan Quayle.</LD>

<TE>   After the verdict against Simon, I was near depression. I could
not fathom living under the Davis regime for four more years. The
entire state would have to endure his higher taxes, his crushing
anti-business, anti-job, anti-growth regulations and his pay-to-play
scandals. So don't think me melodramatic when I tell you that I was
screaming and jumping in the air when I heard the great news about
Simon.</TE>
<TE>   The verdict against his family investment firm was thrown out of
court (Sept. 13). The judge actually applauded Simon's business
decisions. I'm a lawyer and have never seen a decision so clear and
so positive. I guess the facts really were as Simon said. Simon
surprised everyone in the primary and he will do it again.</TE>

<HD>Island's Pig Problem: Hunt for Better Solution</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Hunters to Trap and Shoot Pigs on Santa Cruz Island," Sept. 17:
The National Park Service's plan proposes to pay professional hunters
$4 million to $5 million to shoot the wild pigs after spending $2
million to erect fences to prevent the pigs from re-inhabiting
previously cleared areas. Tens of thousands of hunters purchased tags
to hunt wild pigs in California during 2001-02. Many of these hunters
pay $300 to $600 to hunt wild pigs with guides on private ranches.</LD>
<LD>   Why doesn't the National Park Service collaborate with the
California Department of Fish and Game and offer public wild pig
hunting on Santa Cruz Island? A few experienced guides could be hired
to scout the island and identify water sources, trails and bedding
areas the pigs use. This information could be printed on maps and
provided to Californians eager to hunt pigs on Santa Cruz Island.</LD>
<LD>   A fee of $100 and a turnout of 5,000 hunters would not only
eradicate wild pigs on Santa Cruz Island but would generate revenues
of $500,000. This is in comparison with the $7-million expense
entailed in the National Park Service's plan. It is also an
alternative that provides 5,000 California hunters an opportunity to
hunt one of the most beautiful places on Earth.</LD>

<TE>   Thank you for running the article about the proposed slaughtering
of feral pigs. I think this method of solving the problem is
deplorable and uncivilized. There are other ways to deal with this
environmental difficulty without people "jumping the gun" to wipe out
the pigs. I appreciate your newspaper making the public aware of this
cop-out that has been proposed in lieu of any real attempt at
thinking out a viable and less violent solution.</TE>

<HD>Karl Brown, 76; Developer of Cancer Treatment Equipment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Karl L. Brown, a pioneer in the development of compact linear
accelerators used in cancer treatment and the developer of a computer
code used worldwide for spectrometers, beam lines and accelerators,
died Aug. 29 of heart failure. He was 76.</LD>
<LD>   More than 100,000 people around the globe are treated each day
using the machines Brown helped create. They aim precise beams of
radiation at tumors while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy
tissues.</LD>
<LD>   Although Brown's international reputation stemmed from his
expertise in beam optics for nuclear spectrometers and high-energy
particle accelerators, he was proudest of his work to aid cancer
patients.</LD>
<TE>   In the 1950s, Brown was part of a team of Stanford University
researchers that designed the first linear accelerator in the United
States used to treat a cancer patient, said Dr. Gregory Loew, deputy
director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.</TE>
<TE>   Brown worked with Varian Associates over the next decade to
develop the first commercial line of small accelerators for
radiotherapy, called the Clinac series.</TE>
<TE>   From 1966 to 1968, he took a leave from Stanford to serve full
time as Varian's research director, and remained a consultant after
returning to the university.</TE>
<TE>   Brown also was one of the first scientists to use matrix algebra
for calculations involving charged particle spectrometers, which
scientists use to analyze atomic particles. He designed a computer
code called Transport that could manipulate the size and shape of a
beam to ensure it would travel through Stanford's 2-mile-long
accelerator. The code became a basic international tool.</TE>
<TE>   "His main contribution was to develop the scientific and
mathematical concepts for magnetic-optical systems for charged
particle transport," said experimental physicist Vera Luth, Brown's
wife for 25 years, "and to make them widely accessible for practical
use by scientists and engineers."</TE>
<TE>   During the early 1960s, Brown began using magnets with six poles,
which improved the resolution of spectrometers at the Stanford
accelerator's terminus, where scientists experimented with beams of
high-energy electrons that struck stationary atoms. The six-pole
magnets now are used in many accelerators to keep particles tightly
packed within beams.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Coalville, Utah, Brown attended the University of Utah
majoring in electrical engineering, but transferred to Stanford in
1946 to work on particle accelerators.</TE>
<TE>   Except for sabbaticals to work for Varian and help design
spectrometers and accelerators in Europe and Texas, he remained at
Stanford for the rest of his life.</TE>
<TE>   Brown earned his bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees at the
university, taught applied research there, and became a mainstay of
the linear accelerator center he helped create.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Brown is survived by five children from
his earlier marriage to Anadel Smith-Law and 14 grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is scheduled for 10 a.m. Friday at Valley
Presbyterian Church in Portola Valley. The family has asked that,
instead of flowers, donations be made to the Karl L. Brown Memorial
Young Scholars Fund. Information about the fund is available on the
Web site www.karlbrown.info.</TE>

<HD>William Rosenberg, 86; Dunkin' Donuts Founder Pioneered
Franchising Businesses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William Rosenberg, the tireless entrepreneur who founded Dunkin'
Donuts and set it on its path to become what is now the world's
largest coffee and baked goods chain, founded the International
Franchise Assn. when "franchise" was a derogatory word and also
became New England's largest breeder of standardbred horses, has
died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Rosenberg, who had survived cancer of the lung, blood and skin and
many years of diabetes, died Friday of bladder cancer at his home in
Mashpee, Mass., on Cape Cod.</LD>
<LD>   He turned day-to-day operations of Dunkin' Donuts over to his son
Robert in 1963, and the company was sold to British food conglomerate
Allied Domecq in 1990. But Rosenberg, "consultant for life," remained
active in management and on the board until the sale and passionately
supported his brainchild until his death.</LD>
<TE>   By 2000, when Dunkin' Donuts celebrated its 50th anniversary and
opened its 5,000th outlet in a chain spanning the U.S. and 37 other
countries, Rosenberg was curtailing his own intake of its baked
products because of weight problems and diabetes. But he continued to
have a cup of the chain's fresh coffee every morning, and he served
the doughnuts in his home, joking that, when nobody was looking, he
could inhale two dozen.</TE>
<TE>   A self-effacing eighth-grade dropout who always said he was "too
dumb to make things complicated," Rosenberg had an innate knack for
making money. Whatever made the customer buy was acceptable, and he
never insisted on personal credit for the ideas that worked.</TE>
<TE>   When he wrote his autobiography (with the help of Jessica
Brilliant Keener) in 2001, he wanted to title it "Worth the Trip."
But when his publisher decided "Time to Make the Donuts" would
attract more attention, Rosenberg agreed, saying, typically, "Call it
whatever you want if it will sell more copies."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg didn't even coin "Dunkin' Donuts," which became a
household name, wreaked havoc with elementary school spelling tests
and now serves more than 1.6 billion doughnuts a year. When he
started the business in a single shop in Quincy, Mass., in 1948, he
called it the Open Kettle. Two years later, sure a better name could
sell more doughnuts and coffee, he put his executives in a room with
a tape recorder and told them to brainstorm. He later credited his
architect with the trademark "Dunkin' Donuts."</TE>
<TE>   Even when Rosenberg decided to raise standardbred horses on his
Wilrose Farm in New Hampshire, he candidly admitted he knew nothing
about horses. But he did know enough to hire horse-breeding experts
and to learn from them.</TE>
<TE>   "I once coined a phrase: 'A person does not build a business; a
person builds an organization. An organization builds a business,' "
Rosenberg said last year when he received the Nation's Restaurant
News Innovator Award. In 2000, he was named by Nation's Restaurant
News as one of 100 people who "changed retailing and food service in
the 20th century."</TE>
<TE>   Another homily Rosenberg espoused was, "The boss is the customer."
It was a lesson he said he learned early, delivering groceries from
his father's store and then, after the store was lost in the
Depression, dropping out of school to work.</TE>
<TE>   Young Rosenberg shined shoes, shoveled snow and, at 14, became a
full-time telegram delivery boy for Western Union. He earned $22 a
week plus tips and learned quickly that the better he served the
customer, the bigger tip he got.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg would invent ways to please customers to make more
money--holding onto the back of a truck to make his delivery bike go
faster or carting a block of ice to a racetrack on a hot summer day
and selling ice chips at 10 cents each.</TE>
<TE>   At 17, he went to work for Simco, an ice cream vending company,
where he remained more than a decade, rising from delivery boy to
supervisor of production, shipping, cold storage and manufacturing
and managing 40 to 100 trucks.</TE>
<TE>   With a wife and children to support, he aided the World War II
effort by working as an electrician at Bethlehem Steel, where he
became the first Jewish union representative, and by buying war
bonds. He used the $1,500 bond proceeds and $3,500 borrowed from
relatives to start a catering company, Industrial Luncheon Services,
with a single truck. Unable to buy more trucks after the war, he
bought 10 taxicabs and created his own catering vehicles, with sides
that rose to reveal stainless steel shelves stocked with sandwiches
and snacks--a prototype for today's mobile catering vans. Rosenberg
built a multi-state fleet of 200 trucks that served major industrial
companies. Soon, he added in-plant cafeterias and a vending
operation.</TE>
<TE>   But the ever-watchful Rosenberg noticed that 40% of his revenue
came from just two products--coffee and pastries. So on Memorial Day
of 1948, he began the Open Kettle, selling doughnuts for a nickel and
a cup of coffee for a dime.</TE>
<TE>   As the company grew under its improved name in the early 1950s,
the innovative Rosenberg followed the example of Howard Johnson and
decided to franchise. Now ubiquitous, franchising was so disreputable
in those years that it was borderline illegal in some states, and no
company mentioning "franchise" could be advertised in the Wall Street
Journal or the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg, who launched his empire a couple of years ahead of
Colonel Sanders and McDonald's, believed in franchising and decided
to make the practice respectable. In 1959, at a Start Your Own
Business convention, he invited 16 friends to lunch and founded the
International Franchise Assn. to uphold standards.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of anything that fosters and nurtures innovation
better than the overwhelmingly successful concept of franchising,"
Rosenberg said when he accepted the Innovator Award last year.
"Franchising supports the great American dream of allowing multitudes
to own and succeed in their own businesses."</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, after he was diagnosed with lung cancer, Rosenberg
decided to step back somewhat from Dunkin' Donuts and devote time to
his Wilrose Farm. By decade's end, he had become the largest
standardbred breeder in New England and was inducted into the New
England Hall of Fame of the Standardbred Industry.</TE>
<TE>   He had also contracted a cancer of the blood, so in 1980, he
donated the farm to the University of New Hampshire for use in
teaching franchising and entrepreneurship.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg next threw himself into philanthropy, supporting
hospitals in Boston and elsewhere, seeking cures for cancer and
diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, despite two hip replacements, the dapper, bow-tied
octogenarian continued to walk three or four miles a day and advise
businessmen on the value of determination, persistence, a positive
attitude and passion for the customer as the formula for success.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, two sons, one daughter and one
stepdaughter.</TE>
<TE>   As for those Dunkin' Donuts that, by his edict, must be replaced
with fresh ones if not sold within five hours? Asked a few months ago
whether he still liked them, Rosenberg said with a twinkle, "Is the
Pope Polish?"</TE>

<LD>The man who pulled down a cool 8% of the vote to come in second in
the Democratic primary for governor back in March now says there is
no such person as Gray Davis, and he by default is the party's
nominee.</LD>
<LD>   Anselmo A. Chavez filed suit in Sutter County, alleging that,
among other things, the name on the incumbent's declaration of intent
to run was typed in as Joseph Graham Davis Jr. but signed as "Gray
Davis." Ominously, he says, the L.A. County registrar's office has
neither such person registered to vote.</LD>
<LD>   Therefore, the suit asks that "the nomination of Gray Davis be set
aside; that [Chavez] be adjudged nominated."</LD>
<TE>   Secretary of State Bill Jones' office says it will, according to
procedure, duly forward the suit to the attorney general's office. An
attorney in Jones' office said the key is the code Chavez cited,
which requires intent to falsify.</TE>
<TE>   And Gray Davis doesn't pretend to be anybody but Gray Davis
(really, how could he, hair-wise?). In any case, the matter is
probably moot, because the suit's first court date is set for June 2,
nearly seven months after the election.</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't Call That a Ringing Endorsement</TE>
<TE>   Just like a 1950s horror movie--no one is safe ... from cell phone
terrors.</TE>
<TE>   The voicemail message on the cell phone went like this:</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, this is Loretta Lynch. Because of Verizon Wireless'
absolutely terrible service quality and billing practices, I have
reluctantly decided to give up this phone number, so please call me
at my office ... or at my new cell phone number."</TE>
<TE>   Who is Loretta Lynch? She's the head of the Public Utilities
Commission, which regulates cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   Just a Libertarian Taking Liberties</TE>
<TE>   Put this one under the title "Great Expectorations." Gary Copeland
says he'll still be campaigning for governor, even though his
Libertarian Party has yanked its endorsement of him for spitting on a
radio talk-show host.</TE>
<TE>   Copeland swore that Brian Whitman of KABC radio had it coming. The
"spit spat" followed an on-air shouting match, and what followed the
saliva trajectory was, in the way of these things, more publicity and
more donations to Copeland's campaign. Hey, they're Libertarians.</TE>
<TE>   But late last week, Copeland apologized: "I stepped over an
unwritten line in public decorum. Brian was doing his job and I, in a
fleeting moment, had forgotten mine."</TE>
<TE>   This is turning into a scold-of-the-month campaign for Copeland.
In July, the party's leader chastised him for wandering around the
party's state convention in luau shirt and sandals, and for blurting
out "stupid comments" during other people's speeches. Unfair!
retorted Copeland. The party was out to get him because he'd listed
himself on the ballot as a Libertarian Druid Existentialist.</TE>
<TE>   And, just like Miss America, when the winner can't serve, the
runner-up steps in.</TE>
<TE>   Party Web sites now show the nominee--write-ins only, please--to
be former Bellflower Mayor Art Oliver, who like Copeland isn't within
spitting distance of winning the job. Will this change after
Copeland's apology? You'll read it here.</TE>
<TE>   Does This Qualify as a Trojan Horse?</TE>
<TE>   Ted Stein, the head of Los Angeles' Airport Commission and an FOJ
(Friend of Jim's, Mayor Hahn), was throwing a little gala to raise
money for Hahn's anti-Valley secession campaign. It was at Stein's
house, which happens to be in Encino, which happens to be in the San
Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   And Bruce Boyer, who's running for mayor of the new Valley city,
if there ever is one, intended to be right out in front there,
protesting. So why were the only signs in front of Stein's home the
ones for valet parking?</TE>
<TE>   Boyer's press release had the address wrong by about a block, but
he says now that he would have found the place anyway if it hadn't
been for all the traffic. And he couldn't spend an hour trying to
find the place and then park, or he would have been late for his next
meeting, at the Winnetka Chamber of Commerce, so he bailed on the
protest. He did wonder, he admits, about driving up in his car with
"Bruce for Mayor" signs on it and demanding, "You gonna valet-park
me?"</TE>
<TE>   Secession social notes: Stein and his wife are vacationing in
France and Spain with Richard Close and his wife, Close being the
head of the pro-secession Valley Vote.</TE>
<TE>   It's their second vacation a quatre in two years, and given how
good Stein has shown himself to be at raising money against secession
(about a half-million right there at his own house), Close figures
that "if I take him out of the country, it will give our people a
chance to catch up on fund-raising."</TE>
<TE>   When Embarrassed, Correct It Three Times</TE>
<TE>   Judge not, lest ye be Jose.</TE>
<TE>   At a rally with Latino law enforcement groups at the East L.A.
Community Center, Gray Davis heralded his own performance in
appointing Latinos to state positions. That includes his only
appointment to date to the state Supreme Court, the first Latino on
the state's high court in a dozen years, "a very distinguished
jurist, who is the only one of four judges that I submitted to the
state bar ... who got unanimously 'extremely well qualified' ... Jose
Moreno, and he's now associate justice of the Supreme Court."</TE>
<TE>   Applause, applause. Stop the presses. Davis corrected himself.
"Carlos Moreno," he said, three times, to make sure people knew he
knew.</TE>
<TE>   Keep Talking, There's a Pattern Here ...</TE>
<TE>   Simon says, and says, and says....</TE>
<TE>   A bit of chronology from the switchback statements on gay rights
matters--in this case hospital visitation privileges for gay couples.</TE>
<TE>   Aug. 9: The Log Cabin Republicans' questionnaire shows Simon's
signature at the bottom (the one that Simon says someone at his
campaign signed without his permission, a computer-generated
version): "I fully support hospital visitation, and other rights, for
domestic partners."</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 3: At a Sacramento campaign stop, Simon offered his first
public explanation for why he disavowed the campaign's response to
the Log Cabin questionnaire after he was asked whether he supports
hospital visitation and other legal rights for gay couples: "If it's
premised on sexual orientation, I do not."</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 17: In a radio interview on KLAC-AM in Los Angeles, host Gil
Gross asked Simon whether he supports hospital visitation rights for
gay couples. "You know," Simon responded, "I'd be OK with that."</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * From the people who brought you Proposition 103 and the like,
the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights: the gala dinner for
the "Rage for Justice Awards," which topped its list of honorees with
state Sen. John Burton. "Rage for Justice" is from the title of a
biography of John Burton's brother, the incendiary Rep. Philip
Burton. The Philip Burton Public Service Award was presented by
Warren Beatty. State Sen. Martha Escutia got Legislator of the Year
honors for going after the junk-food trade for targeting
schoolchildren. Big Macs were not served.</TE>
<TE>   * Bad blood between the top two Dems? Two days in a row last week,
Gray Davis made a point of inviting Republican Bruce McPherson to
ceremonies where Davis signed a number of crime and security bills,
including two by McPherson. Davis signs a lot of bills, most of them
not in public, with no invitations extended to their sponsors,
especially not a Republican who happens to be running for lieutenant
governor against the state's No. 2 elected Democrat, Cruz Bustamante.</TE>
<TE>   * The California Organization of Police and Sheriffs, a big
supporter of Bill Simon's, is playing literal-minded over a metaphor,
demanding that Gray Davis repudiate and apologize for "condoning gun
violence against Bill Simon." What did Davis say? Apropos of the
overturning of a huge fraud verdict against a Simon family firm but
other legal concerns on the Simon horizon, Davis remarked, "Mr. Simon
may have dodged one bullet, but he has a few more coming his
direction."</TE>
<TE>   * Happy anniversary! Today is the 50th anniversary of Richard
Nixon's Checkers Speech; Nixon, struggling to stay on the GOP ticket
after accusations of a "slush fund" from fat-cat friends, never
actually said "I'm sorry" but offered a list of his financial
obligations and possessions, including his wife's "respectable
Republican cloth coat," and the gift of "a little cocker spaniel dog"
named Checkers, which his daughters loved and he wasn't giving back.
Nixon's daughter Julie said last year she'd like to exhume Checkers
from a Long Island pet cemetery and rebury her near her old master at
the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "We know the Amber Alert worked like a charm when those two
teenagers were kidnapped in Lancaster. I had the honor of being with
the two deputies who had to track down this predator and did us all a
favor by killing him."</TE>
<TE>   Gray Davis, speaking to an applauding crowd of about 200 union
members in Riverside. All part of a candidate's edging toward the
center as the election draws nearer. In a debate four years ago (you
remember when candidates debated) against conservative Dan Lungren,
Davis made jaws drop with his observation that "Singapore"--where an
American teenager had been controversially caned for spray-painting
cars--"is a good starting point, in terms of law and order."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleanup: According to this billboard on the Long Beach Freeway,
the PAX network, partly owned by the family of gubernatorial hopeful
Bill Simon Jr., presents a new TV series, "Just Cause," about crooked
CEOs. "Cleaning up America ... one crooked CEO at a time." Simon's
family was recently slapped with a $78-million jury verdict in a
business fraud case, overturned this month by an L.A. judge.</TE>

<HD>Family of 4 Killed in 1-Car Freeway Crash</HD>
<DH>Deaths: Marine, his wife and young children die in
early-morning wreck near Bel-Air. Speed may have been a factor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Marine Corps sergeant from Camp Pendleton and his family, including
a newborn daughter and toddler son, were killed Sunday morning when
their car spun out of control on the San Diego Freeway near Bel-Air
Estates, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Sgt. Gabriel Otero, 23, was driving home from a visit to relatives
in Central California when his 1988 Honda Accord struck a guardrail
and a concrete pillar then flipped, causing the roof to cave in.</LD>
<LD>   Police said speeding may have caused the 2:42 a.m. accident, which
killed Otero; his 21-year-old wife, Heather; and their children,
20-month-old Andrew and 6-week-old Caitlyn.</LD>
<TE>   The children were found secure in their car seats, and their
parents were wearing seat belts, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and family spoke fondly of the Oteros, who lived in the
San Onofre Mobile Home Park in Camp Pendleton.</TE>
<TE>   Gabriel and Heather Otero were high school sweethearts in Tracy,
Calif., and eloped while he was in the service and she was a student.</TE>
<TE>   He became an expert marksman who instructed Marines at a rifle
range.</TE>
<TE>   She was a young mother who hoped to become a teacher once her
children grew older.</TE>
<TE>   "Heather was a beautiful young woman," said Stacie Chapman, 26, a
family friend and neighbor. "Everybody kind of thought of her as
'Mrs. Cleaver.' She was just a homebody who loved to bake all kinds
of things from scratch. She was a very good wife."</TE>
<TE>   Chapman said the couple decided on a whim to take their family
north in their new car to see relatives in the middle of last week.</TE>
<TE>   The couple met while Heather was at Tracy High School and Gabriel
was at another school but taking classes at Tracy. They soon eloped
and moved to Twentynine Palms, where Gabriel was stationed upon
returning from a stint in Okinawa, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd been in the service six years," Chapman said. "He was a
really good Marine."</TE>
<TE>   Gabriel won medals in shooting competitions across the country.</TE>
<TE>   When not perfecting his aim at the range, he had to work hard at
making ends meet by delivering pizzas on the side.</TE>
<TE>   Just before his death, he had used several of his vacation days
doing just that, Chapman said.</TE>
<TE>   "He contributed a lot to a lot of people," said Gabriel's mother,
Carmen Orfiano, 53. When Gabriel met Heather, she was a champion pole
vaulter who broke records at her large high school.</TE>
<TE>   "Her brothers followed in her footsteps," said Heather's mother,
Lori Mehrer, 42, who said her sons went on to break men's pole
vaulting records at the school.</TE>
<TE>   Heather left Tracy High early to be with Gabriel, but completed
the classes she needed to graduate in Twentynine Palms.</TE>
<TE>   "She really wanted to be a teacher," Mehrer said. "She missed
going to school. She missed reading the books."</TE>
<TE>   Mehrer said that her daughter's focus of late, however, was
entirely on her children.</TE>
<TE>   There was Andrew, with his straight hair always sticking up and
with a constant smile, and Caitlyn, who just seemed to love light,
and would always crawl toward it.</TE>
<TE>   "Andrew's daddy had two dimples, but he just had one," Mehrer
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It would only show up when he smiled. So you always wanted to do
something that would make him smile again."</TE>
<TE>   "Caitlyn was so little," she said. "She didn't even have a chance
to live."</TE>

<HD>Deputy Dies of Crash Injuries</HD>
<DH>Accident: The sergeant's motorcycle had collided with a car
Friday in Mission Viejo. The 16-year veteran leaves a wife and three
children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County sheriff's deputy died Sunday morning of injuries
suffered when his motorcycle collided with a car in a Mission Viejo
intersection on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Sgt. Matthew Davis, 38, had been in grave condition since the
crash, and family members and sheriff's deputies were standing vigil
at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo when he
died, said sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino.</LD>
<LD>   Davis was a 16-year law enforcement veteran, and a husband and
father of three children.</LD>
<TE>   "I think he was first and foremost a family man," said Wayne
Quint, president of the Assn. of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs, who
has known Davis since his rookie year. "He was a Christian who put
his family first. He was a professional deputy."</TE>
<TE>   Davis is survived by his wife, Tammy; a 13-year-old son; and
daughters ages 11 and 7, Quint said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Davis was a skilled motorcycle rider who promoted safety.</TE>
<TE>   The collision occurred as Davis was southbound on Marguerite
Parkway at La Sierra Drive about 12:30 p.m. He collided with a Saturn
turning left from eastbound La Sierra onto northbound Marguerite.</TE>
<TE>   The impact threw Davis about 20 feet into a traffic sign.
Authorities said Davis was wearing a helmet.</TE>
<TE>   The 17-year-old female driver of the Saturn had stopped at a stop
sign before starting her left turn. Davis did not have a stop sign.
The accident remains under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Our thoughts and prayers go out to [the Saturn driver]," Quint
said. "This was an accident. This young lady must feel horrible.
Tammy, Matt's wife, would want everyone's prayers to go out to her."</TE>
<TE>   Davis was the third sheriff's deputy killed in the line of duty in
as many years, all in south Orange County, Quint said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge blow because it's back to back, and it's all the
Sheriff's Department," Quint said. "Emotionally and spiritually, for
the department, it is a real tough one."</TE>
<TE>   In June 1999, Deputy Brad Riches was gunned down by a man with an
assault rifle outside a Lake Forest convenience store.</TE>
<TE>   In June 2000, Steven Parsons, 36, died after his motorcycle was
struck by a car that allegedly had run a red light in Aliso Viejo.
Parsons was the department's first motorcycle officer killed in the
line of duty.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Davis and Parsons, at least six motorcycle officers from
other police agencies in Orange County have been killed on the job,
dating to the 1930s. According to the FBI, 50 law enforcement
officers died in motorcycle accidents nationwide between 1990 and
1999. During that same period, 343 officers died in automobile
accidents, and 58 in aircraft accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' funeral will be Thursday at Saddleback Church in Lake
Forest, Quint said.</TE>

<HD>From Page to Screen in 48 Hours</HD>
<DH>Cinema: Dozens of teams of aspiring filmmakers participate
in a project to produce a short movie in one weekend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aspiring director Gina Levy had a few problems putting together her
latest movie.</LD>
<LD>   The screenplay required a major last-minute overhaul. Some of her
editing software broke down. And her sole shooting location--a
relative's North Hollywood plastics factory--suffered a busted pipe
that was threatening to flood the place.</LD>
<LD>   Compared with the gold standard of Hollywood production
nightmares--Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now"--Levy's travails
were minimal. There were no monsoons, no Ferdinand Marcos, no
mumbling Marlon Brando.</LD>
<TE>   Then again, nobody asked Coppola to do it all in two days. Levy
and her crew were among 44 teams of Los Angeles filmmakers over the
weekend who answered the challenge of the 48 Hour Film Project.
Organizers are sponsoring the project in cities throughout the
country, promising to screen just about anyone's short movie--as long
as it is written, shot and edited between Friday and Sunday nights.</TE>
<TE>   It's an idea that guarantees stress, if not full-blown hearts of
darkness. But as of midnight Saturday, Levy--an unemployed victim of
the San Francisco dot-com bust--was keeping her wits about her.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not freaking out at all," the 37-year-old said, even though
she really didn't have a plot to work with. "You know, at the end of
the day, it's just a movie."</TE>
<TE>   The project is the brainchild of Washington, D.C., independent
filmmakers Liz Langston and Mark Ruppert. Inspired by a similar New
York City theater project called 24 Hour Plays, the pair tested the
idea in their hometown last year with a small group of filmmaker
friends.</TE>
<TE>   They set a few ground rules: All the participants had to be unpaid
volunteers. Directors would pick their film genres out of a hat. And
all the movies had to include a common character, prop and line of
dialogue chosen by the festival organizers.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to just level the playing field," Langston said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For Gina Levy, the project gave her another opportunity to show
that she is capable of reinventing herself as a director. Since
March, the Harvard graduate has been living in Calabasas with her
aunt and uncle, taking film classes and trying to crank out one short
film per month.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to learn the craft, you make movies," Levy said.</TE>
<TE>   Levy and her director of photography, Lise Kearney, spent two
weeks assembling a cast and crew, advertising on Hollywood Internet
sites and holding auditions. Their final group of about 20 included
curious Tinseltown professionals, other laid-off dot-commers, and an
enthusiastic handful of struggling semi-pros.</TE>
<TE>   At 7 p.m. Friday night--the official start of the project--the
group had convened at Levy's uncle's house, where a flowery living
room would serve as the evening's makeshift drama lab. If they were
going to begin shooting by Saturday morning, they needed a story by
sunrise.</TE>
<TE>   By 8 p.m., Kearney had returned from the Film Project's opening
event in a Fairfax Avenue bar, where the 44 teams--a predictable
gaggle of Hollywood extroverts, hipsters and young auteurs in
black-rimmed glasses--had picked their genres at random.</TE>
<TE>   Levy's crew members were pleased with what they had drawn: film
noir, the melancholy province of gumshoes and urban corruption. They
could do noir parody easily, shooting on digital video and converting
to black and white on a computer. What's more, noir was complemented
by fog, and Levy had rented a fog machine earlier in the week.</TE>
<TE>   Noir, it was agreed, generally works best when there are lots of
hats. The group had hats. Thanks to a Levy family connection, it also
had access to the plastics factory, as a shooting location.</TE>
<TE>   Led by comedy writer Peter Crabbe, the group began riffing
scenarios immediately: There would be an evil plastics factory
magnate. He would be guarding a secret invention--plastic surgery!
There would be sly references to "The Graduate," with its famous
promise that there's a great future in plastics.</TE>
<TE>   This was getting good, they thought. Someone mentioned David
Lynch's "Mulholland Drive," which featured a lesbian love tryst. They
threw a pair of double-crossing lesbians into the mix.</TE>
<TE>   The actors began improvising scenes. Levy slurped on a Diet Coke
and jotted a few notes, furrowing her eyebrows when the improv--or
the rapid-fire pop-culture references--spiraled out of control.</TE>
<TE>   "What was that Vonnegut book where everybody lived in a cage?"
someone asked. "Huh?" came a reply. "The Hanukkah book?"</TE>
<TE>   In another corner of the room, screenwriter Chris Mancini tapped
out some of the choicest bits on his laptop. By 10:30 p.m. Friday, he
was ready to put something together; the crew left him alone in the
living room. Mancini's work was complicated by the mandatory elements
that Ruppert and Langston had assigned back at the bar: an ex-Marine
for a character, swim flippers as a prop, and a line of dialogue: "I
think I've tapped into something here."</TE>
<TE>   Mancini, 33, has worked full time as a writer since college. He
learned to write fast during a stint on a daytime soap opera. He
delivered his 10-page script to Levy at 12:20 a.m. Saturday. "I fit
in a lot of stuff," he told Levy. "But I couldn't fit in the
lesbians."</TE>
<TE>   "Ten pages in two hours," Levy said. "That is un-be-lievable."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Langston said the films from other cities have been surprisingly
entertaining--for the most part. "Well, I'd say they're all watchable
the first time, because they're only five to 12 minutes long," she
said. "I'd say about 50% are actually good."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Ruppert and Langston took their idea on the road. It
has already played in New York, Washington and Atlanta. Early next
year, a panel will choose the best 48-hour film of 2002. Today and
Tuesday, the films that met the deadline in Los Angeles will be shown
at the Laemmle Fairfax Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The more ambitious goal, Ruppert said, is to get the nation's
do-it-yourself filmmakers off their sofas and behind the camera.
Though digital video equipment and home editing software have never
been cheaper, Ruppert said, potential directors often lack the free
time to put the technology to use. The 48-hour deadline solves that
dilemma.</TE>
<TE>   They estimate that as many as 650 people were working on films
over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Writer Crabbe, who also starred in Levy's movie, said the idea was
particularly alluring in Hollywood, where young creative types can
grow old taking lunches at trendy restaurants, chatting up projects
that never seem to get made.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a town of development hell--and trust me, as a
screenwriter, I've been in development hell," he said. "This is more
like instant gratification."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday morning, Levy was stuck in traffic on the Ventura
Freeway, late for her own film shoot. It turns out she hadn't been
crazy about the script. She, Kearney and crew member Kevin Chesley
had been up all night, e-mailing new dialogue back and forth. "His
script had too much going on in terms of who was dying, and how many
people were disappearing--it felt a little too kitchen-sinky," Levy
said. "I was so tired. We just had to make a judgment call."</TE>
<TE>   The cast assembled in the boardroom of the plastics factory to run
through the new script at 2 p.m. It had a distinct beginning, middle
and end, and the bald and burly Crabbe--a perfect fit as the
ex-Marine plastics magnate--had written some strange, strong lines
for his character: "I took on the chancellor of Germany," he barked.
"I took on the mustard gases, the ketchup and relish gases--all of
the basic condiment gases, really!"</TE>
<TE>   By 4 p.m., Levy's cousin had fixed the gushing pipe. The crew
began filming, working strategically around the recreational lake
that now dominated the factory floor. Fueled on Chinese takeout and
coffee, the crew rolled through the script without a hitch, wrapping
at 2 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The project's founders had set a strict deadline of 7:30 p.m.
Sunday. Some teams were confident they would make it. Others were not
so sure.</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood writer/actor Alec Nemser's director quit early in
the process, but Nemser, 28, was pressing ahead with a hip-hop
musical about a couple who fall in love over the Internet: "In high
school, I took typing as an elective," his protagonist raps. "When it
comes to women I date I'm selective!"</TE>
<TE>   The editor of Lisa Gold's film--a "mockumentary" about a guerrilla
poster artist--could not get her computer to work. Gold was able to
get hold of a distant cousin about 9:30 a.m. Sunday. She had only met
him three or four times, but she knew he was an editor for "The
Sopranos." He agreed to bail her out.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really touch and go if we make the deadline at this point,"
Gold said just before noon.</TE>
<TE>   Levy awoke at 6:30 a.m. Sunday in Kearney's cluttered West
Hollywood apartment, with the goal of slicing more than two hours of
footage into a 10-minute short film. Because Kearney's computer
processor needed about three hours to transfer each frame of film
from color to black and white, the rough cut needed to be finished by
about 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "We will get a rough edit in," Levy said. "It will not be
wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, the editing program on Levy's Power Mac began
acting up. There was a hailstorm of expletives. Levy had slept for
fewer than five of the last 48 hours.</TE>
<TE>   "Lise!" she cried. "This is not working!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The seventh short film in the budding oeuvre of director Gina Levy
is titled "A Touch of Plastic"--a title partly stolen from that
patron saint of put-upon filmmakers, Orson Welles.</TE>
<TE>   It has romance. It has Nazi spies. It has a number of clever jokes
about surgically enhanced breasts. It even has flippers, and an
ex-Marine who says, "I think I've tapped into something here."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, it is finished: Levy and Kearney dropped
their print off at the bar on Fairfax with four minutes to go.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it sounds corny, but we were just so lucky to create
something over one weekend," Levy said. "And it doesn't stink."</TE>

<HD>Officials Driven to Reform County's Fleet</HD>
<DH>Environment: Supervisor plans a motion to gradually replace
most of the 1,500 vehicles with already popular hybrids.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While driving this summer from his Ventura home to an Oregon forest
on vacation, county Supervisor Steve Bennett felt guilty about
chugging down the road in his 1988 Mazda sedan.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, he was still getting his money's worth out of a car with
a whopping 250,000 miles on it, but how much carbon monoxide was the
old beater spewing into the mountain air?</LD>
<LD>   "It occurred to me that I needed to do something," Bennett said.</LD>
<TE>   Although he will drive the Mazda "until it dies," Bennett plans to
make a motion Tuesday that would authorize the purchase of several
more low-emission vehicles, called hybrids, for the county. It
already owns eight.</TE>
<TE>   A hybrid vehicle has an electric motor that handles normal
stop-and-go travel and initial highway acceleration and a gasoline-
or diesel-powered internal combustion engine that kicks in when the
vehicle gets to higher speeds. A computer system decides when to make
the switch.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett also hopes his colleagues will commit to a long-term goal
of eventually replacing most of the county's 1,500-vehicle fleet with
hybrids.</TE>
<TE>   "They make a lot of sense here because Ventura County does not
meet the federal standard for air quality," said Stan Cowen, an
engineer at the county's Air Pollution Control District. "We're not
as bad as L.A., but it's bad."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the federal Environmental Protection Agency rated Ventura
County the 16th-smoggiest region in the nation--a little better than
Dallas but slightly worse than Washington, D.C.--between 1997 and
1999.</TE>
<TE>   In the two years since those figures were released, the county has
improved its air quality with more stringent regulations and industry
cleanup efforts, but vehicle emissions continue to be the leading
cause of the area's bad air.</TE>
<TE>   Tailpipes on trucks, cars, buses and motorcycles send about 13 1/2
tons of contaminants into the air daily, officials said. In contrast,
the county's industrial facilities emit a combined total of 1 ton of
toxic fumes a day.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be a desire to at least explore any technology out
there that can help us reduce emissions," said Dennis Scamardo, the
county's transportation manager. "It's just the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Bennett's plan has the support of County Executive Officer Johnny
Johnston. Johnston and his wife own a Toyota Prius hybrid, and
Johnston's county-issued car is also a hybrid. And at least two
supervisors also drive county-issued hybrids, Bennett said.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you could say it's sort of a nerd-mobile," Johnston said
with a laugh. "But it's really worth it in terms of performance and
efficiency and the reduction in air pollution."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every city in the county uses an alternative vehicle,
whether hybrid or powered by electricity, natural gas or a
combination of natural gas and regular gasoline or diesel fuel,
called a dual-fuel vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the size of the county's entire transportation fleet,
which includes 116 compact cars and dozens of sedans, utility trucks
and vans, Bennett's plan would make Ventura County the area's leader
in the use of "greener" energy sources for transportation.</TE>
<TE>   "We've enjoyed a lot of success with our program," said Paul
Starr, who handles the city of Oxnard's 600-vehicle fleet. "It's
surprising that vehicles that are so energy-efficient can ride so
nice."</TE>
<TE>   The city started with two Prius hybrids two years ago. Now it has
14 such vehicles, most of which are used by fire chiefs, traffic
enforcement officers and engineers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the city has six dual-fuel cars and trucks. These
vehicles, though, have proven somewhat disappointing because of the
high cost of natural gas, which can equal the price of regular
gasoline, and lack of efficiency, Starr said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a regular gasoline-powered car or truck might go 400
miles on 20 gallons, while an equivalent amount of natural gas might
last only 200 miles.</TE>
<TE>   In Camarillo, fleet services spokesman Steve Miller said the city
has seven hybrid cars but future purchases were being debated because
several nonhybrids are equally eco-friendly.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura, the city has one hybrid car and one electric vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula has no alternative vehicles; but over the mountains in
Ojai, the city offers four propane-fueled public trolleys, and city
workers have access to several electric vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   In Simi Valley, the city bus system and Dial-a-Ride vans all run
on natural gas, but the city recently returned two leased electric
vehicles after determining they were too costly and inconvenient to
recharge.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks officials haven't felt the same inconvenience. The
city offers employees access to two electric vehicles, with five more
on the way in the next few weeks. There are nine free recharging
stations around town.</TE>
<TE>   If Bennett's proposal passes, the county would start by replacing
its nine Chevy Cavaliers with hybrids. The cost of a hybrid will be
about $3,000 more than a Chevy, but officials expect to make up that
difference with the hybrid's gas mileage--often more than 50 miles
per gallon.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, Bennett would like to see the county's entire compact
car fleet traded in for hybrids. In addition to the eight hybrids, it
has 39 natural gas cars and trucks and two electric vehicles.</TE>

<HD>'New' Simon Effort Looks Lot Like Old</HD>
<DH>Politics: Despite his family firm's court victory, GOP
donors continue a wait-and-see approach. But signs of weak Davis
support still offer hope.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly two weeks after a court victory gave his campaign new life,
Republican Bill Simon Jr. is still struggling in the race for
California governor, trying to turn an uptick of optimism into a more
tangible boost in money and momentum.</LD>
<LD>   His best ally--in a manner of speaking--may be Gov. Gray Davis,
whose own tepid support keeps the race a contest.</LD>
<LD>   Simon's campaign headquarters is split into hostile camps. Major
GOP donors remain deeply skeptical of the candidate and his campaign
team. Perhaps most significant, Simon has shown little sign of
expanding his support beyond the roughly 33% of the California
electorate that comprises the rock-ribbed Republican base--and he has
made little effort to do so.</LD>
<TE>   For all of that, Democrat Davis has yet to run away with the
contest, which gives even the most dour Republican some grounds for
faith. "There's a roiling undercurrent here that spells trouble for
Davis," said Ken Khachigian, a political veteran of 30 years who is
one of the more bullish about Simon's chances. "Assuming he can
gather the resources ... yeah, I think it's doable."</TE>
<TE>   With just over six weeks left in the campaign, each passing day
gains import, as voters increasingly focus on their choices and, more
crucially, GOP donors decide whether to commit the money Simon needs
to stay financially competitive with the richly endowed Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Next weekend's state party convention in Anaheim will give Simon a
chance to rally Republican ground troops. A week after that, Simon
and Davis are scheduled to meet in Los Angeles in their first--and so
far only--debate of the general election campaign.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, Davis continues to blitz the television airwaves
with campaign ads, many of them now positive in an attempt to lift
his sagging approval ratings and engage dispirited Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, who also seem uninspired, would love to summon some
enthusiasm for Simon, said one party strategist in Sacramento. The
reversal of a multimillion-dollar fraud verdict against his
family-owned investment firm was an enormous relief. But before major
GOP donors commit to the party nominee and open their checkbooks, the
strategist said, "They want to see the Simon campaign have two or
three weeks of looking like it has its act together, putting together
successful press events, staying on message and avoiding negative
stories as much as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Even that wait-and-see attitude is "different from two or three
weeks ago," the party insider said, "when there was a growing sense
the race was over."</TE>
<TE>   Sentiments shifted when a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge
tossed out a $78-million verdict against Simon's family investment
firm. The elated candidate and his staff called the day a new start
to the governor's race and predicted that fence-sitting Republicans
would soon swamp the campaign with contributions.</TE>
<TE>   That has not happened. In the week after the verdict was tossed
out, Simon raised about $270,000, enough for little more than a day
of statewide television ads. Of that amount, $50,000 came from the
campaign's own finance director and another $52,000 from the state
Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Davis collected $651,000 over the same period. The
money, however, comes at a price, giving Simon new ammunition for his
running critique of the governor's aggressive money-gathering
techniques.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the governor abruptly canceled a Santa Clara
fund-raiser put on by boosters of a state high-speed rail system
after Simon and others questioned the timing. The event was scheduled
a day after the governor signed legislation asking voters to approve
a $9.9-billion bond for the project.</TE>
<TE>   "Just when we think we've seen the worst from this governor, we
find a new bottom," Simon said, assailing "a pattern we have seen
from Davis and his cronies throughout his career."</TE>
<TE>   Yet it was a rare day on the offense for Simon, who has spent the
better part of the last several months dealing with assorted campaign
missteps and controversies. The latest arose on Wednesday after he
disclosed that he had loaned $4 million to the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The infusion was desperately needed. Simon was forced off the
television airwaves at the start of last week after a brief ad run,
and some campaign staffers have recently been grounded, to save on
travel expenses.</TE>
<TE>   However, by ignoring some advisors and lending his campaign the
money, rather than giving it outright, Simon did little to assuage
the concern of many in the GOP donor community, according to one
prominent Republican Party giver. Simon, the co-chairman of an
investment banking firm, has lent his campaign roughly $9 million
since launching his candidacy last year.</TE>
<TE>   "People question why it was a loan rather than a direct
contribution," said the donor, who has raised millions of dollars
over the years for GOP candidates and causes. "The feeling is,
'You're asking me to put in my money, why isn't your money in?' "</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Simon drew criticism from campaign-finance
watchdogs who noted that, if elected, California's new governor would
be taking contributions and putting them directly into his pocket to
pay himself back. On Thursday, Simon pledged to donate any repayments
to charity.</TE>
<TE>   When he announced his candidacy last November, aides boasted of a
$60-million campaign budget and implied much of it could be covered
by the candidate himself. But more recently, the campaign has been
operating on a far more modest budget, with the bulk of money being
sought from outside contributors. So far, Davis has raised more than
$62 million toward his reelection, none of it from his own pocket.</TE>
<TE>   Sal Russo, a Simon strategist, said the meager flow of
contributions over the last week or so is deceiving because the
campaign has received numerous pledges for upcoming fund-raising
events. "The commitments are certainly real," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But promises and hard currency are two different things, as
campaign veterans will attest. In 1995, then-Gov. Pete Wilson
reported $8 million in pledges for his ill-starred presidential
campaign in just one day of fund-raising. He ultimately collected
less than that--$5 million--over the entire course of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "A pledge is an easy way to get off the phone," said one longtime
Republican fund-raiser, who has snubbed the Simon campaign. "It's a
long way from a pledge to a check."</TE>
<TE>   Apart from money worries, Simon strategists continue to fight
internally over the tone of the campaign and the content of TV
advertising. A recent spot featuring footage of Simon and President
Bush was broadcast without a review by the campaign's full complement
of strategists, sources said, resulting in bruised feelings and
renewed bickering.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon camp remains split between advocates of a pugnacious
approach and strategists who believe that being well-liked is more
important when facing an opponent as personally unpopular as Davis.
The candidate himself is caught in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   But for all Simon's difficulties, the incumbent Democrat has
political problems of his own. Along with continued questions about
his fund-raising tactics, the governor faces several tough decisions
between now and the Sept. 30 deadline for signing or vetoing
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is expected to sign a controversial family leave bill today.
But two others await his verdict--one on farm worker rights and
another on whether the state should issue driver's licenses to
illegal immigrants. Whatever he decides, Davis is almost certain to
alienate one or more of his constituencies, whether it is the
business interests he has carefully cultivated, Latino activists or
key allies in the labor movement.</TE>
<TE>   All of that, along with Davis' stubbornly tepid popularity
ratings, leaves Republicans with a sense of measured optimism they
might otherwise lack, given Simon's persistent troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "We see this as a winnable race, primarily because the Democrat is
in such poor shape," said Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the
Republican National Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "Simon is a candidate with a great message," she continued, adding
pointedly that "the key for him between now and Nov. 5 is execution:
getting that message out and turning his voters out."</TE>

<HD>It's Amazing, It's a Miracle, and Hey, It's Just $19.95</HD>
<DH>County Fair: The hawkers sell just what you never knew you
really needed. Step up and take a look.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It would be easy to make fun of a guy like "Chino," a guy who skipped
college to spend his days squatting on a stool, eyes fixed on the
floor, a guy whose 21-year-old existence thrives on dirty sneakers.</LD>
<LD>   "Hey, Miss? Miss? Your shoes are dirty." He calls to a girl and
her mother, beckoning them with a sudsy wet brush. "Come here, come
here."</LD>
<LD>   The girl stops. She looks down. She looks at her mom, and they
both look down at her shoes. Chino is right. The 12-year-old plops
her dirty-shoed foot on Chino's stool.</LD>
<TE>   Soon, mom will line his pocket with about a $5 commission. Mother
and daughter walk away amazed that their family future includes
bright white sneakers.</TE>
<TE>   This transaction is why you have to respect a guy like Chino--and
the window guy and the lotion lady and the chamois guy. They are the
hawkers of the Los Angeles County Fair, a vendor force that is 2,000
strong, standing in booths and beneath tents in every nook capable of
containing a demonstration table.</TE>
<TE>   They wear microphones wrapped around their heads like rock stars,
and some even stand on mini-stages. Some shout, others smile and
wave. They hard-sell, they soft-peddle. Some are professional
traveling salesmen. Others are in it for the quick summer bucks. They
are characters whose presence is as traditional to the fair
experience as Ferris wheels and hot dogs on a stick.</TE>
<TE>   Within arm's reach, the L.A. County Fair offers them an American
merchants' dream: tens of thousands of passersby in good moods with
wallets full of disposable income.</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Thompson, 38, of Wilmington had about $100 to spend at the
fair with her daughter, Danielle. Chino manages to get $18.99 of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, you know, I hate it when my kids have dirty shoes,
especially the girls," says Thompson as she explains her "Shoe Magik"
purchase. "There they are in their nice white (sports) uniforms and
their shoes are all dirty. I just don't like it."</TE>
<TE>   Or is it that Thompson and fairgoers like her can't resist an
amazing magic miracle with a lifetime guarantee that unfolds before
their eyes? The fair operators have named it "shopper-tainment" and
encourage vendors to ham up their live acts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's entertainment. Yes it is," says Kathleen Proffer, 47, of
South Pasadena, who stops in her tracks when the chamois guy catches
her eye. There stands Rob Carnes, 30, on his 2-foot high stage,
simulating a pet accident by pouring diet Coke on a carpet remnant.</TE>
<TE>   "Accidents happen folks. You know it," he says, placing the yellow
chamois over the spill like a magician. "It's a synthetic towel
folks, four times more absorbent than an animal cloth, machine
washable, absorbs 27 times its weight in liquid."</TE>
<TE>   He swiftly lifts the cloth and wrings out the spill. Proffer and
her sister, Linda Ehlig, are transfixed by the two-minute show, brows
furrowed in skepticism at first. But the wringing finale sells Ehlig,
who buys into the "two-for-the-price-of-one" $20 special.</TE>
<TE>   "The fair is only place I would take the time to look at a thing
like this," says Ehlig, emphasizing that she is no Home Shopping
Network junkie.</TE>
<TE>   Carnes is a professional salesman and is on the road hawking his
"Supertex" chamois "four days a week, 35 shows a year" at car shows,
fairs, electronic conventions, never veering from his credo: "You
gotta stay pumped up."</TE>
<TE>   Carnes and "Speed Cleaner" Ben Loughlin on the next aisle over
have the pricey real estate advantage of a corner booth. Like home
values, fair booths are all about location, location, location. Fair
operators capitalize on this by charging as much as $6,500 for the
largest corner booths in one of their five air-conditioned exhibition
halls. By contrast, a tent outside in the Pomona heat costs $1,700
for the 17-day event.</TE>
<TE>   Loughlin stands on a platform swooshing a squeegee-like
contraption back and forth over a window, wiping away handprints,
hairspray and grease. For now, this is his only chance to perform.
He'd rather be back at home in Lansing, Mich., playing bass with his
punk rock band "Uncle Robert."</TE>
<TE>   "But if your band isn't making any money, this is the closest I
can get to stage, lights and audience," he says, instantly kicking
into character as a couple slowly passes.</TE>
<TE>   "Sir? Sir? Ever see a window washer on a high-rise building with
paper towels and Windex?" Loughlin asks urgently. He make contact
with Frank Cornell, 64, walking through the shopping pavilion as a
favor to his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Cornell stops.</TE>
<TE>   "You see my condo at the beach is all windows and mirrors. It just
gets me sick, the way they have all these smears," he says of his
Santa Monica place. "And then I have this Palm Desert place with a
golf course picture window. I've tried painter poles, buckets of
water, squeegees, garden hose attachments. And I'm STILL looking out
at the golf course with streaks."</TE>
<TE>   Sold for $29.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkers have this knack for creating instant needs.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Heine, 45, extends his hand as if for a handshake to
passersby. Heine is on three weeks' vacation, working the fair. He'll
go back to his real job as a Las Vegas police officer Sept. 30, about
$10,000 richer.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I clean your ring for free?" he asks a couple.</TE>
<TE>   Up steps Louie Munoz, 44, of Montebello. Munoz likes to wear four
diamond bands on each of his pinkie and ring fingers. He came to the
fair for ribs and corn on the cob and walks out of Building No. 4
with a $20 jar of jewelry cleaner.</TE>
<TE>   "I really need this," he says, comparing his clean diamonds with
his dirty ones. "I can't wait to get home and clean them all."</TE>
<TE>   County fair spokeswoman Wendy Talarico explains that the fair
likes to extend booth rentals to vendors with unique products. No
guns, "even guns with rubber bands," no sexually oriented products,
she says. But it's buyer beware when it comes to vendors and their
goods.</TE>
<TE>   When approaching Juan Platero's unusual booth, passersby aren't
sure what kind of show they are in for. Platero and partner Ray
Quevedo use an old-fashioned call to attract their customers:</TE>
<TE>   "Get your bidet today folks, come and get your bidet today!"</TE>
<TE>   Now, it would be easy to make fun of the bidet guys, who sell a
$29 toilet attachment that turns an everyday toilet into a bidet with
a hand-held sprayer. But they are seniors at UCLA majoring in
business economics.</TE>
<TE>   They consider this commission-only job a true test of their
salesmanship and communication skills. On a decent day Platero will
make $140 to $160--more on the busy weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Says Platero: "The way I look at it, if I can sell a bidet, I can
sell anything."</TE>

<HD>Secession Theme Striking No Chords</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: Those on both sides of debate pitch to a populace
that's not interested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the Hollywood Farmers Market on Sunday, the choice of information
about Hollywood secession was nearly as plentiful and varied as the
choice of heirloom tomatoes--green ones and pink ones and gnarled
ones bigger than a boxer's fist.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Perner, a North Hollywood resident, walked up and down past
the produce stalls, holding a homemade sign that read "No Secession"
on one side, and "Hollywood/Valley Secession Is Smug, Vain and
Selfish" on the other.</LD>
<LD>   He brought with him copies of his Valley anti-secession manifesto,
which proclaims, "We will not retreat behind the hills."</LD>
<TE>   At the market's information booth, Neal Jano, a longtime market
volunteer who is running for a Hollywood city council seat that will
exist only if Hollywood secession is successful, put a stack of
pro-secession materials out on a table crowded with recipes and food
safety tips.</TE>
<TE>   His partially handwritten, photocopied campaign material included
a letter he had written to a neighborhood paper about broken parking
meters that the city doesn't fix and abandoned furniture that sits on
the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   An independent Hollywood city would stretch over 15 square miles.
It would have a population of about 183,000 and a part-time city
council with five at-large members.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secessionists argue that Los Angeles is too big and that
an independent Hollywood could be spiffier and safer, like
neighboring West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-secessionists say a breakaway Hollywood would lose access to
a vast array of Los Angeles programs and might wind up having to cut
services that the area--with its many needy residents--could ill
afford to lose.</TE>
<TE>   With only about five weeks to go before Nov. 5, when Los Angeles
voters will decide whether to let the San Fernando Valley and
Hollywood secede, secessionists and anti-secessionists are trying
hard to get the attention of voters, many of whom--at least at the
market--seemed distinctly disinclined to hear them out.</TE>
<TE>   At the booth set up by the Hollywood secession campaign,
31-year-old Tad Davis, a film director and a Hollywood city council
candidate, reached out a hand to just about every person who walked
by him. But Davis, who was dressed for business in a white
button-down shirt, a red tie and beige trousers, said the market
crowd was tougher than at Runyon Canyon, a nearby hiking area where
secessionists set out water and dog biscuits to lure the many dogs
and lemonade and Oreo cookies to win over the dogs' owners.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi Ma'am! Do you live in Los Angeles?" Davis said to a young
woman in a midriff-baring tank top, who walked languidly past him,
clutching a fat bouquet of sunflowers wrapped in newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," she said, without raising her eyes to look at him or
stopping.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Davis said, when people do stop and talk, "they see the
logic."</TE>
<TE>   Half a dozen stalls away, sitting under an umbrella at the table
of the anti-secession group Hollywood and Los Angeles as One, HALO
co-chairman Andrew Glazier was also having trouble getting people to
hear his pitch. Granted, he said, it was Sunday morning. A lot of
people were not in the mood for politics. Granted, too, there was so
much else to focus on, from the pupusa and paella stands to the beat
of the steel drum two booths down.</TE>
<TE>   "But one of the things that sort of astounds me is all the people
who just don't care, and then there's a lot of people who don't even
know what's going on," he said. "Anyway, a lot of people who walk by,
they'll just give a thumbs up and keep walking. I feel like most
people are with us."</TE>
<TE>   Around the corner from the HALO booth, past the fish truck and a
grape stall, Los Angeles City Councilman Eric Garcetti, whose
district includes part of Hollywood, was holding his biweekly office
hours, talking to residents about their problems.</TE>
<TE>   An hour or so into his session, he'd heard from people who wanted
more preferential parking and others who wanted to make sure kids ate
enough fruits and vegetables. He'd tried to diplomatically wade his
way through a discussion with another Hollywood resident who started
out talking about an unkempt median and a beehive near his home and
ended up decrying the number of shop signs in foreign languages he
saw around the city.</TE>
<TE>   Secession hadn't even come up once, Garcetti said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the heart of Hollywood, I find very few people begging to talk
about secession," said Garcetti, who opposes it.</TE>
<TE>   "When people come to see me, 90% of the time, it's about bread and
butter issues. They want their streets fixed. They don't even care
who does it."</TE>
<TE>   At the market, some residents said they did indeed care about
secession, but were finding it difficult to ferret out facts.</TE>
<TE>   Perre DiCarlo, 31, who designs Web sites for feature films and
lives in a Hollywood apartment, said he visited the anti-secession
booth, where he was told that secession could mean the end of rent
control. That was news to him, he said, and it made him nervous. Then
he stopped at the pro-secession booth, where he was told that rent
control, far from being threatened, might be strengthened in an
independent Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   When Davis and other secessionists told him that rent control
would be safe and to trust them, DiCarlo, dressed all in black,
stared at them skeptically and replied, "I'm not sure I'd even trust
myself if I was running for office."</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely feel like I'm going to need more information,"
DiCarlo said.</TE>

<HD>Seal Beach Fears Meters Mean Charm Is Expiring</HD>
<DH>Revenue: Facing a budget crunch, the city voted to install
301 of the devices it long spurned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seal Beach thinks of itself as the small coastal town that never grew
up, and residents have long been proud that their city has no parking
meters.</LD>
<LD>   For decades, residents and merchants fought attempts to install
them along Main Street, making Seal Beach the only beach city in
Orange County and one of only three in Southern California without
meters.</LD>
<LD>   But the days of free parking are coming to an end.</LD>
<TE>   Faced with a budget crunch, a divided City Council this month
voted to install meters on the city's main drag.</TE>
<TE>   The decision has sparked a familiar debate: Is Seal Beach losing
its much-protected charm?</TE>
<TE>   "Seal Beach is special," said Councilman Paul Yost, who voted
against the parking meter proposal. "People feel like it's the last
little beach town, and they want to keep it that way. And every time
something comes across that people feel is a threat to that, they get
very emotional."</TE>
<TE>   The city plans to install 301 meters. Most will be in the Main
Street shopping district, a four-block stretch between Pacific Coast
Highway and the Seal Beach Pier that's lined with restaurants, gift
shops, bars and coffeehouses. Officials expect the meters to generate
$500,000 a year, which they say is needed for increased costs of
police and fire department pensions.</TE>
<TE>   Parking meters have a long history in Seal Beach.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first battles was in the late 1960s, when the city
installed some meters along Main Street to pay for a parking lot near
the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Stan Anderson, then the mayor, pushed the measure through only
after the city promised to remove the meters after five years.
Friends said Anderson always regretted removing the meters when the
time came, depriving the cash-strapped town of 26,000 of a constant
source of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me it was the biggest mistake he ever made," said Ron
Bennett, who chaired a task force on Main Street parking in the
1970s.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the parking problem is the fact that there are not
enough spaces, especially on weekends. Some merchants fear meters
will drive away customers, who would go to nearby shopping centers
with free parking. Residents worry that the meters don't fit the
small-town character they've tried hard to maintain.</TE>
<TE>   This is the city, after all, that wouldn't allow Starbucks to move
to Main Street because residents believed the coffeehouse would sully
the town's charms.</TE>
<TE>   A walk down Main Street is in some ways a walk into the past and
away from the modern world of malls. The street has a mom-and-pop
grocery, a small hardware store and a one-screen movie house, the Bay
Theater.</TE>
<TE>   Some landmarks are enduring, including Walt's Wharf restaurant and
Clancy's bar. Some residents waited for years to find the right house
for sale in town, and once they arrive, they rarely move away.</TE>
<TE>   While most beach cities seem to blend into one another, Seal Beach
is set apart by the San Gabriel River and Alamitos Bay to the north
and the sprawling Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station to the south.</TE>
<TE>   Preserving this hometown atmosphere has for decades been the
central issue in Seal Beach, from fights over chain stores on Main
Street to the perennial debate over free parking.</TE>
<TE>   "Main Street is a charming place because it's a place where the
people of Seal Beach congregate," Yost said. "It's the center of
town, their home, and I'm concerned that meters will change that."</TE>
<TE>   Other attempts over the past three decades to place meters on Main
Street failed. But this time, the city's finances left officials with
no choice. Even council members who voted for the parking meters did
so reluctantly.</TE>
<TE>   The vote leaves three Southland beach towns without street
meters--Malibu, Palos Verdes Estates and Rancho Palos Verdes.</TE>
<TE>   Along Main Street, merchants and residents had different
perspectives about the milestone.</TE>
<TE>   Woody Woodruff, who owns Woody's beauty salon, said he hopes the
meters will prevent beachgoers from parking all day along the street.
He doesn't think it will hurt Main Street's image.</TE>
<TE>   "When I came here [in 1981], I thought it was a quaint town, but
not because it didn't have meters," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several stores away, however, Tammi Madelin, owner of a gift shop,
said the city may do more harm than good if it installs meters.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is a good chance it will hurt my business, and
right now we don't need anything else hindering the success of our
business," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents believe the city has taken the easy way out.</TE>

<HD>1 Man's War on Vietnam</HD>
<DH>Prisoner: Held in L.A. for alleged terrorism against his
homeland, he's a hero to expatriates for his anti-Communist role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few things define Southern California's Vietnamese American community
more than its passionate brand of anti-Communism, on display in
heated discussions along the sidewalk cafes of Little Saigon and in
frequent demonstrations.</LD>
<LD>   That's what makes the case of Van Duc Vo different. His activism
went beyond words to action, making him a folk hero to many in Little
Saigon and a wanted terrorist in Vietnam.</LD>
<LD>   Vo, 42, of Baldwin Park, is being held in a Los Angeles jail,
accused by the U.S. attorney's office of trying to blow up the
Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok. His brother, 49-year-old Vinh Tan
Nguyen, sits in a Manila jail, accused of a similar bombing plot
against the Vietnamese Embassy in the Philippines.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities call the brothers terrorists. But to California's
Vietnamese American community, they've emerged as heroes. Last month,
the brothers' detainment was the subject of a two-day protest and
hunger strike in Santa Ana that drew hundreds of protesters who
hailed them for trying to "liberate" Vietnam. Van Vo has received the
most attention because of his years of activism in the community.</TE>
<TE>   "He has done something we can't do," said protester Thanh Le, 66,
of Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-Communist activist Chanh Huu Nguyen added: "We want to stand
behind him. He's a freedom fighter."</TE>
<TE>   Both brothers were members of a Little Saigon-based group that
bills itself as the exiled "Free Government of Vietnam." From its
offices in Garden Grove, the group's leaders try to foment opposition
to the Vietnamese government.</TE>
<TE>   Van Vo faces possible extradition to Thailand, but the Vietnamese
government also wants him to face charges in Hanoi. The Vietnamese
have cited the U.S. government's war on terrorism in urging American
authorities to turn him over.</TE>
<TE>   Vo denies he is a terrorist. In an interview, he said he planned a
bomb attack in the embassy but decided at the last minute not to go
through with it.</TE>
<TE>   Vo's story is at once familiar and different from that of many
Vietnamese emigres. He escaped the oppression of the Communist
government of his homeland on an overcrowded boat and established a
successful life in Southern California. But he also turned his back
on this success to dedicate his life to the overthrow of the
Communists.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Tim Nguyen of Baldwin Park, said of her sons: "I think
back on what happened to our family [in Vietnam], and I cannot blame
them. I do not want or need anything in my life. I just want my sons
back."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even at the height of the Vietnam War, the family felt like they
had it good.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Nguyen sold duck eggs in Saigon, and her husband was a
decorated police officer. Their six children--five sons and a
daughter--were good students and most attended universities.</TE>
<TE>   It all changed with the fall of South Vietnam in 1975. Government
officials barged into their home and arrested Vo's father. Nguyen
said she couldn't afford to feed her children, so she dispersed them
to relatives in various regions of Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom cried day and night," Vo recalled in a jailhouse interview
at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Vo said he spent the next few years in jail or begged on the
streets of Saigon for food. He and a dozen friends eventually
organized an escape. In 1978, they squeezed onto a 6-foot boat in the
middle of the night and pushed out to sea.</TE>
<TE>   Vo arrived a week later at a refugee camp in the Philippines.
After a year at the camp, he moved to Indiana to live with a
sponsoring family and studied English. He eventually moved to El
Monte, which had a growing Vietnamese immigrant community. He went to
school at Rio Hondo College, studying architecture. He was voted
president of Rio Hondo's Vietnamese Student Assn. and helped form a
regional Vietnamese American student group.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1980s, he felt his life was falling into place. He
married and had four children. He opened his own construction
business, hiring his older brother, Vinh, to work with him. He also
taught Vietnamese to elementary school students on weekends. He
slowly brought his siblings over from Vietnam along with his mother
and father, who had finally been released from jail.</TE>
<TE>   But after work, his obsession with Vietnam grew. He began
organizing protests each April 30, the anniversary of the fall of
Saigon, and organizing petition drives and cultural events such as
the Tet Festival. He frequently spoke out on late-night
Vietnamese-language radio shows, criticizing the Communist government
and urging expatriates in Southern California to organize.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept thinking about my own escape and my family's pain," Vo
said. "How could the regime do this to every family, not just mine,
and get away with it?"</TE>
<TE>   The activism was taking a toll on his work and marriage. In 1991,
his wife filed for divorce, saying he was seldom home. Vo barely
showed up at his company, too, and decided to shut it down.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, when Vietnam eased immigration restrictions, Vo visited
his homeland.</TE>
<TE>   Spending three years in the country, he took notes as he traveled
from north to south. He described the effort as part fact-finding,
part missionary work. When he could, he told villagers he met along
the way about the United States and the benefits of opening markets.</TE>
<TE>   "My work was the hardest during these years," Vo said. "I had to
explain to them that Americans were not evil. I wanted to make a
subtle influence," Vo said.</TE>
<TE>   Vo was held for six months after he wrote articles for Vietnamese
newspapers, which were restricted to homeland writers. He was
deported in 1996 and returned to his parent's home in Baldwin Park.</TE>
<TE>   He heard about the anti-Communist group Government of Free
Vietnam, an organization that seeks to overthrow the Hanoi regime.
Along with his brother Vinh, he met with the group's leader, Chanh
Huu Nguyen.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers quickly became involved in the group and within a
year, Vo returned to countries along the Vietnam border in search of
villagers whose homes were taken by the Communist government. He
recruited them for the Government of Free Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to give them hope that they can do something about the
situation," Vo said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In June 2001, Vo was in Thailand with another member of the
organization, Pan Vian Pun Tian See, a Vietnamese national living in
Thailand. Authorities there allege that the two men packed explosives
into a pair of cellular phones that See planted outside the
Vietnamese Embassy. But the explosives did not detonate as planned
when the men allegedly dialed the phones.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the bomb malfunctioned. Vo, however, says he
aborted the plan once he realized the U.S. Embassy was nearby. "We
want revenge but we didn't want to kill innocent Americans," he said.
"We were upset and we wanted to start something in Thailand to send a
message to the Vietnam government and ring a bell as an international
warning.... To call me a terrorist is an exaggeration."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities immediately began to look at anti-Vietnam activists as
suspects in the bombing attempt. They eventually linked See and later
Vo to the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Vo fled Thailand, going to Seattle to visit his younger brother.
Orange County sheriff's deputies, alerted by Thai authorities,
arrested him in October when he returned to John Wayne Airport. Vo
was charged with use of a weapon of mass destruction by a U.S.
citizen in a foreign country and is awaiting word on extradition to
Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   His brother, Vinh, faces similar charges in Manila. A few months
after the alleged Thailand incident, he was arrested in another
alleged bombing attempt using cell phones at the Vietnamese embassy
there. In this case, too, a bomb never exploded.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials in Manila have released few details
about the case. But according to Filipino press reports, police
arrested Vinh and three alleged conspirators at a townhouse where
officials allegedly found bomb-making materials.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities charged that Vinh and the men tried to set up the
bombs to explode Sept. 2, the national day of the Republic of
Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Vo said he has no regrets about his activism--even the time behind
bars. He is willing to face trial in Thailand but worries that
government officials there would then extradite him to Vietnam.
Officials in Bangkok law enforcement could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was saddened to leave behind his family, but "they're
grown and taken care of, so I can try to accomplish my goals now and
do what makes me happy."</TE>
<TE>   As he sat in a Los Angeles jail, his future uncertain, Vo said
he's realized one thing: "I know I can't change the country by
myself."</TE>

<LD>Stalking past a farmhouse near Ojai, Ron Fischer spies his quarry
through a row of orange trees.</LD>
<LD>   A few paces to the left, a near tumble into a mudhole, a quick
recovery, a steely eyed gaze through a viewfinder at the broad side
of a barn--and bam! No. 107 is officially bagged.</LD>
<LD>   "That's some gorgeous building," Fischer says in a booming,
nice-to-meet-you, Midwestern voice. "Turn of the century, probably."</LD>
<TE>   If barns were movie stars, Fischer, a 69-year-old retired
mechanical engineer, would be selling their photos to the tabloids.
He is crazy about barns. In the last 18 months, he has photographed
barn after falling-down barn, with at least 108 now under his belt.
One day, he hopes, he will reach his goal of photographing every barn
in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Why?</TE>
<TE>   Because the smell of horse manure and hay can lift the spirit in a
way that most city dwellers will never know. Because old wooden barns
are disappearing, tumbling with age or giving way to shopping malls
and subdivisions. Because, reminding us of a golden time that will
never return, barns ennoble.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to make sure they weren't lost forever," says Fischer,
who has a photo exhibit at the Oxnard Public Library and recently
displayed his work at the Ventura County Museum of History and Art's
Yesteryear Festival. "Who knows, maybe 50 years from now, people will
look at these pictures and say: 'Remember when there were barns in
Ventura County?' "</TE>
<TE>   That isn't a question the National Trust for Historic Preservation
wants to hear. About two-thirds of the 6 million or so barns that
dotted the American landscape in 1920 have toppled, and the
Denver-based group is trying to persuade farmers and communities to
save the rest.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never had a person regret saving an old barn," said John
Olson, a spokesman for the trust's Barn Again! preservation program.
"But I've had plenty of letters from people who regret tearing them
down."</TE>
<TE>   Some local governments have made a point of counting the old barns
on their turf, but preservation efforts often begin with enthusiastic
amateurs like Fischer. "They're our grass-roots people," Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   A man with a mission, Fischer hasn't been thwarted by "No
Trespassing" signs.</TE>
<TE>   "I knock on the door to see if someone's home," he says. "If not,
I just take the picture. I haven't been shot at yet."</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, he says, growers have welcomed him, chewing the fat about
their land's history and sometimes opening up the barn doors for a
view of the old tractors, rusty tools, strawberry crates, horse tack,
burlap sacks and assorted what-nots within.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how many times they've said, 'Why haven't I
taken any pictures of the barn?' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer, who is thinking of putting out a Ventura County
barn-of-the-month calendar, finds his subjects mainly through
word-of-mouth. At the recent museum festival, he heard about a barn
tucked between an automotive shop and a 1910 Craftsman bungalow on
Ventura's gritty Thompson Boulevard. He snapped it on the way home.</TE>
<TE>   One recent morning, he set out with his wife, Beverly, to track
down a barn he heard about from a couple of customers at the
wholesale popcorn business he runs in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   When they finally found it outside Ojai, Beverly stayed in the
car, trying her luck on a hand-held poker machine. She accompanies
Ron on most of his forays--"I have a cell phone in case we have to
call the cops," she said--but she retains a genial detachment from
the job at hand. "A barn is a barn is a barn," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In search of yet another barn, they cruised in their Chevy van to
Upper Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   "No barns here," said a man on the rambling grounds of the Ojai
Foundation spiritual retreat. "Just alternative structures."</TE>
<TE>   Just how many barns exist in Ventura County is something of a
mystery. The U.S. Department of Agriculture counted 2,214 farms in
1997, but that figure is open to question, said Rex Laird, executive
director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. Besides, he points out,
some farms have no barns while others have more than one.</TE>
<TE>   A volunteer photographer at official ribbon-cuttings and other
Oxnard civic events, Fischer has combed the farm-rich Oxnard Plain
for historic barns. He has penetrated the Santa Clara Valley and the
Ojai area, but his inroads in the east county have been more limited.</TE>
<TE>   He was welcomed at the Scholle family's ranch in Somis, where two
old barns have been used for hay, horses and, over the last 15 years
or so, for humongous, country-themed Halloween parties.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer photographed them and a painter captured them in
watercolors.</TE>
<TE>   Looking out her kitchen window on a red barn that is at least 75
years old, Pat Scholle contemplates its place in her family's life.</TE>
<TE>   "We've painted it, we've put a new roof on it, and we've shored it
up because it was leaning," she said. "When it goes, it'll be like
the passing of an old friend."</TE>

<HD>Frankly, My Dear Politician, California's Voters Just Don't
Care</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Democratic candidates in California have political power and sacks of
money. But they don't have the voters' attention, let alone their
enthusiasm. And the party's worried.</LD>
<LD>   People are numb to politics, analysts observe. They don't even
want to think about politicians. In fact, many people are repelled.</LD>
<LD>   To paraphrase former President Jimmy Carter from 23 years ago,
there's a malaise across the land.</LD>
<TE>   It affects the Republican party too, of course. "There's
absolutely no enthusiasm for either candidate for governor," notes
Tony Quinn, who co-edits the Target Book, which analyzes legislative
and congressional races.</TE>
<TE>   It's widely assumed that the Nov. 5 election will produce the
lowest turnout for a gubernatorial race in California history--maybe
55% of registered voters. A record-low 34.6% turned out for the March
primary.</TE>
<TE>   By the nature of politics, the lower the turnout, the worse it is
for Democratic candidates. They depend on broad voter participation,
especially among the working classes, to win competitive races.</TE>
<TE>   Republican voters are less likely than Democrats to boycott the
ballot and are more loyal to their party's nominees.</TE>
<TE>   At least that's the conventional wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   One dissenter from this consensus view is veteran Democratic
consultant Bill Carrick. "In recent elections, it's been pretty
balanced," he insists. "There's no evidence low turnout hurts
Democrats more than Republicans."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Carrick adds, Gov. Gray Davis should be "really
worried about turnout. It's the biggest danger he has--some quirky
turnout."</TE>
<TE>   Carrick says Davis especially should worry about Democrats'
casting protest votes for a third-party candidate, like Green nominee
Peter M. Camejo.</TE>
<TE>   Davis seems particularly concerned about potential Latino
defections. He has been agonizing over whether to sign bills pushed
by Latino and labor activists to allow illegal immigrants to obtain
driver's licenses and to improve collective bargaining for farm
workers.</TE>
<TE>   If Davis vetoes the farm labor bill, he'll be "shunned" by many
Latino voters and politicians, proclaims Richie Ross, a Democratic
consultant and longtime advisor to the United Farm Workers Union. One
"shunner" will be Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, says Ross, his
consultant. "We're absolutely dead serious."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, Davis began airing commercials on Spanish-language TV
declaring that he has "worked side by side" with Bustamante--a real
stretch--and "Latinos have a friend in the governor's office."</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts now perceive a scenario in which Davis wins a
closer-than-expected race against Republican Bill Simon Jr., but a
low vote turnout hurts "down ticket" Democratic candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than heavily bankrolled Democrats sweeping all statewide
offices, as many pundits have speculated, perhaps Republicans will
win two or three. Maybe the GOP cuts into the Democrats' dominance of
the Assembly. Even picks up the Central Valley congressional seat of
scandal-tainted Rep. Gary Condit, beaten in the Democratic primary.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very worried," concedes Democratic state chairman Art Torres.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic party has budgeted $6 million to get out the vote
through mail, phone and door-to-door walking. But the party spent $20
million on its "ground" effort in the last gubernatorial election,
Torres notes. It's hoping for a big infusion of dollars from
fund-raising champ Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, Democrats will have a lot more money than Republicans
do to coax out their voters. They'll need it.</TE>
<TE>   Says Barbara O'Connor, a political communications professor at Cal
State Sacramento: "We're in a period, not just of boredom and
disinterest. It's beyond dislike. There's a climate of disdain....</TE>
<TE>   "There's no respect for either the [political] process or the
participants. The whole process is getting corrupted by money.
There's an unrelenting drumbeat of negative ads."</TE>
<TE>   It's not only in this state. In recent primary elections across
the country, turnouts have been lower than California's.</TE>
<TE>   Political pros say people are preoccupied with and depressed by
the slumping economy, their deteriorating 401(k)s, corporate
scandals, the terrorist threat, Iraq, pedophile priests.... And in
California they're still grumpy about energy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's scary out there," says Democratic consultant Darry Sragow.
"Voters are sour. We've tried in focus groups to see if there's some
issue that gets their juices going, and there isn't. They're like,
'Leave me alone.' "</TE>
<TE>   Once people realize in focus groups that "they're going to be
talking about politics for a whole two hours," consultant Gale
Kaufman says, "it's hard to keep them in the room."</TE>
<TE>   The only races that currently interest Californians are the
baseball pennant races.</TE>

<HD>4 Bills Curbing HMOs Signed</HD>
<DH>Health: The regulations approved by Davis, which largely
fine-tune earlier reforms, address drugs, quality of care, coverage
and grievances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis signed four bills Sunday aimed at strengthening HMO
reforms enacted earlier in his administration.</LD>
<LD>   The laws ensure that health maintenance organizations will not
deny drugs to patients with serious illnesses; give the state
Department of Managed Health Care authority to regulate HMOs' quality
of care; provide health coverage through a state insurance program
for those with existing conditions; and require HMOs to accept
patient grievances over the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   "The days when an HMO could deny patients drugs they needed to
stay alive are over," said Daniel Zingale, director of the Department
of Managed Health Care. "The days are over when they could make
patients wait and wait for health care."</LD>
<TE>   Much of the new legislation was aimed at fine-tuning laws to
restore their original intent after the industry had fought them in
court.</TE>
<TE>   A bill by Assemblywoman Rebecca Cohn (D-Saratoga), for example,
would put into law the health-care department's authority over
quality of care, not just the financial stability of HMOs.</TE>
<TE>   Cohn pointed to the case of Margaret Utterback, 74, of San Leandro
in Northern California, who suffered a fatal aneurysm in January 1996
after waiting hours to see a doctor at Kaiser Permanente.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Kaiser, the state's largest HMO, was fined $1.1
million. An administrative law judge earlier this year struck down
the fine, saying state law did not give Zingale's department
oversight over the quality of medical care. But Zingale, who has the
power to reject the judge's decision, reinstated the fine. Kaiser can
appeal to the Department of Managed Health Care and then sue in
Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Cohn's bill also requires the department to adopt regulations for
timely access to care by January 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Cohn said the HMO industry opposed the bills Davis signed Sunday.
"There will always be resistance to change because they don't want to
be held accountable," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of HMOs could not be reached Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Another bill, sponsored by Assemblywoman Helen Thomson (D-Davis),
a nurse, would provide insurance for about 4,000 people who could not
get health insurance because of existing medical conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Beth Capell of Health Access California, a coalition of community,
consumer and labor groups, said the majority of those affected are 50
to 65, most of them women, who had lost their health coverage because
a spouse had died or had lost a job.</TE>

<DH>Trends: During the downturn in a region known for

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>It was Yom Kippur, Judaism's most holy day of the year, and the
message from the pulpit at Congregation Kol Emeth in Silicon Valley
last week included this startling and unusual appeal: Your fellow
congregants need job leads.</LD>
<LD>   At Congregation Beth Am, another synagogue in nearby Los Altos
Hills, Rabbi Janet Marder's sermon on the eve of Rosh Hashana, the
Jewish new year, included an urgent plea on behalf of a family in the
congregation who desperately needed housing.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, at the height of the high-tech boom, Silicon
Valley's houses of worship were focused on helping their congregants
maintain moral values in light of unprecedented financial successes.
Today, the mission is strikingly different.</LD>
<TE>   "People would come to me and tell me about layoffs even before
they were in financial distress. They were in emotional distress,
absolute shock," Marder said. "Then, as their job searches wore on, I
began to be aware of the magnitude of what impact this was having on
our families, financially as well as emotionally."</TE>
<TE>   "These are very highly educated, highly accomplished people.
People who have never been unemployed before," said Marder, who
estimates the unemployment rate among her adult congregants at about
8%, on par with the figures for Santa Clara County. "This is about
reevaluating our definition of success. The first question people get
asked when they meet a stranger is, 'What do you do?' The perception
is that you are judged by what you do, and that is not the Jewish way
at all. You are judged by your character."</TE>
<TE>   For about a year, laypeople from the conservative synagogue Kol
Emeth and its reform neighbor Congregation Beth Am have teamed up to
provide networking opportunities, informational meetings and
emotional support for unemployed members of the Jewish community. A
similar group stemming from two congregations in Oakland started
meeting in the East Bay in early May.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to regular meetings at the two synagogues, there is an
e-mail group for job leads and inquiries that has attracted about 350
members.</TE>
<TE>   And at Calvary Church in Los Gatos, a Baptist congregation, the
weekly job support group that began in November with eight people now
draws 90 to 100 per meeting. The meetings include networking time, a
guest speaker--and a recently added basket for prayer requests. One
of the church's lay leaders has offered to pray for anybody who is
out of work.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some people finding jobs, but every week we find there
are a number of new people that come as well. It's discouraging, but
it's good for them to come together," said Calvary's pastor, Lamar
Allen.</TE>
<TE>   Betty Fellows, 52, founded the group at Kol Emeth a year ago and
maintains the popular e-mail job listings. She lost her software
support job at a law firm in June 2001 when it was consolidated with
another position at a different office. "The longest I'd ever been
unemployed before is two months, and now it's 15 months. It seems to
be a different world at the moment," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Fellows was among the 25 job seekers who showed up on a recent
Thursday night for a presentation by synagogue member David Meir
Levi, a financial consultant, on health insurance alternatives for
the unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   Irene Lefton of Santa Clara makes a point of attending three
networking events and an informational interview every week. She says
she's optimistic because a friend recently landed a job after Lefton
helped her prepare for the interview. Now, she's hoping her friend
will use her new position to get Lefton's resume into the right
hands.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Gordon, who started the spinoff group at Temple Sinai in
Oakland, said he turned to the synagogue because of his experience in
the devastating Oakland Hills fire of 1991, in which Gordon's family
and 39 others in his congregation lost their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "From that personal experience, I had seen and experienced the
congregation come together in ways that enabled it to be a very
valuable resource for many families who were going through very
difficult times. It felt right that this would be another
opportunity," Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Holden Graber, 59, a single mother of two, said attending
the meetings at her own synagogue, Congregation Beth Am, provides an
extra level of comfort. "I think it's helpful to have it be part of
my synagogue because you feel like you can be more candid with
people. You have more familiarity, a basis of understanding. It's
more of a family. If it were just a job group, it might not be that
way."</TE>
<TE>   Graber, a systems analyst from Cupertino, had been in information
technology for about 35 years. Although she was laid off once before
in the early 1990s, she always found plenty of choices in her field.
"I always had interviews. There were a lot of people interested in
me, and now there's nothing out there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than fight to land a job she no longer believes exists,
Graber has been working as a substitute teacher and plans to pursue a
master's degree in special education. She has rented out rooms in her
three-bedroom house and her finished garage, and even taken
dog-walking jobs to make ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   Congregation Beth Am's president, Rick Rudman, says this is the
worst economic situation he's seen in his nearly 30 years in Silicon
Valley. "What's going on in our congregation right now with members
of our community needs to be addressed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After a year of informational sessions and informal networking,
the group at Beth Am is now shifting its focus to bring unemployed
congregants face to face with fellow synagogue members who might
actually be in a position to help. Rudman, the executive vice
president and chief operating officer of the Electric Power Research
Institute in Palo Alto, is hosting a reception for congregants this
week to do just that.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've been really successful in giving people
emotional and spiritual support, but I don't think we've been as
successful as we would have hoped in helping people find jobs," said
Cindy Anderson, a co-founder of the group at Beth Am and an unemployed
mother of three in Los Altos. "I think the reality is there are very
few jobs out there. It is really hard."</TE>

<DH>Remembrance: FDNY's Stephen Ceraulo will speak during

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A New York City Fire Department paramedic who aided in Sept. 11
emergency relief efforts will speak at a pair of commemorative forums
this week in Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   The forums will be hosted by the national Cops 'n' Jocks mentoring
program based in Santa Paula.</LD>
<LD>   Stephen Ceraulo, 33, will speak Wednesday at Oxnard High School
and Thursday at Moorpark High School. Both events are free, open to
the public and begin at 7 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   The forums--part of the Cops 'n' Jocks awareness project
"Together, We Can All Make a Difference"--were conceived by the
program's high school student governors.</TE>
<TE>   The programs will open with a video montage set to music, with
photo images of the hundreds of law enforcement and fire department
personnel who died in the aftermath of the World Trade Center attacks
last year. "It's going to be pretty emotional," said Cops 'n' Jocks
founder Rich Randolph, 29, a reserve officer with the Santa Paula
Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   A retrospective of the 9-year-old mentoring program will be
presented before Ceraulo shares his observations from Sept 11.
"Stephen told me that what we all saw on TV was nothing compared to
what he and others actually experienced," Randolph said.</TE>
<TE>   Ceraulo also helped with funeral arrangements and family
notifications for many of the victims. He continues to work full time
out of the New York mayor's office, handling similar support duties,
Randolph said.</TE>
<TE>   "He will talk about his own experiences on that day and what
followed," Randolph said. He said the paramedic's presentation will
include the positive experiences he has seen since the attacks, such
as the outpouring of support in New York City and around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Ceraulo will take questions from the audience.</TE>
<TE>   He also is scheduled to visit elementary and high schools in
Camarillo, Oak Park and Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1991, Cops 'n' Jocks, an award-winning crime-prevention
program that works with high school athletes in seven states, has
matched officers with school teams to build relationships between
teens and law enforcement.</TE>

<LD>Forget about what's in the secret sauce that has enticed beach bums

success of selling hot dogs, hamburgers and soft ice cream on the
Huntington Beach boardwalk is knowing when not to try.</LD>
<LD>   For Jack Clapp, that time of year is nearing--the off season when
the coastal fog lingers past noon, the ocean serves up a nippy breeze
and the beach is so empty you could land a jumbo jet on it.</LD>
<LD>   "You're kind of wasting your time spending the day down here just
to make a hundred dollars," said Clapp, who in the fall begins to
scan the weather report to decide whether he wants to go to work that
day.</LD>
<TE>   Clapp, 72, ought to know. He owns Dwight's, a Huntington Beach
landmark where his family has been dishing up food and renting
umbrellas and beach gear for 70 years.</TE>
<TE>   Clapp was 2 when his father, Dwight, set up shop in 1932 during
the Great Depression. Dwight Clapp was a man ahead of his time, an
oil field roustabout convinced that tourism--not oil--was Huntington
Beach's future.</TE>
<TE>   "This was an oil town in those days," Jack Clapp said. "This whole
area was a sea of oil wells. They looked like Christmas trees all the
way down the coast. My father didn't want to spend his whole future
in the oil business. It was tough, hard, dirty work."</TE>
<TE>   His father persuaded the City Council to build a lifeguard tower
on newly acquired land south of the pier, and to rent him a corner of
the tower for $100 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Before surfing became big in Surf City, Dwight Clapp was there.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife, Fae, worked seven days a week and late into the
night, forming ground beef patties by hand and chopping potatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Hamburgers and hot dogs cost a dime; ice cream bars, candy and
soda in glass bottles a nickel. Much of the Clapps' income came from
umbrella rentals. In its first year, Dwight's rang up $624 in sales.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Clapp began working at Dwight's when he was 10, reclaiming
soda bottles for their deposit. Growth spurred by Southern
California's postwar boom boosted business at Dwight's, so much so
that Dwight Clapp opened a drive-in.</TE>
<TE>   Jack took over managing Dwight's. He was 17.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just something you get used to, and it gets hard to leave,"
he said. "I like the people. I like the challenge of running the
place. It's a great environment. You're at the beach, working in the
open air. It's not like being stuck in an office all day."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Clapp opened his own concession. Taking a marketing
cue from his father, he named the place Jack's. He moved back to
Dwight's when his father retired. Today, his son Dave runs Jack's.</TE>
<TE>   Much has changed at Dwight's over seven decades. A new building
went up in 1939; it was replaced in 1967. The beach itself is four
times as wide. An hour of parking costs as much as 15 hamburgers once
did. And downtown Huntington Beach--once renowned as a scruffy
surfer's hangout--has gone upscale with a luxury resort and
beach-view mansions.</TE>
<TE>   "My father said he watched bikinis change from bloomers to
Band-Aids," said Clapp.</TE>
<TE>   The menu at Dwight's has changed too. Hamburgers don't sell like
they used to, so Clapp added chicken sandwiches 10 years ago,
breakfast burritos and fish and chips five years later.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest seller by far has been cheese strips with Dwight's
original sauce--tortilla chips, cheddar cheese and a hot sauce the
Clapp family has been making for 42 years. Dwight Clapp got the idea
from a taco stand, and the spicy red sauce he created tastes a lot
like, well, taco sauce--although his son says it's much more
complicated than that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you what's in it," Clapp said. The secret concoction
includes tomato puree, brown sugar, vinegar, chili powder and garlic.
"But I won't tell you how to make it."</TE>
<TE>   He sells the stuff by the quart and gallon, a lot of it to aging
beach-goers nostalgic for a taste of their youth. Last year, a
Florida woman who had lived in Huntington Beach 25 years ago called
seeking sauce.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pregnant," she told Clapp. "I'm just dying to have strip
sauce."</TE>
<TE>   He froze some and Fed-Ex'd it to her.</TE>
<TE>   Clapp has made a good living with Dwight's, although it has by no
means made him rich. When his four children were growing up, he
supplemented his income with winter jobs. In summer, he still works
at Dwight's eight or nine hours a day, nearly every day.</TE>

<LD>Forget about what's in the secret sauce that has enticed beach bums
for generations. Perhaps the most important ingredient in making a
success of selling hot dogs, hamburgers and soft ice cream on the
Huntington Beach boardwalk is knowing when not to try.</LD>
<LD>   For Jack Clapp, that time of year is nearing--the off season when
the coastal fog lingers past noon, the ocean serves up a nippy breeze
and the beach is so empty you could land a jumbo jet on it.</LD>
<LD>   "You're kind of wasting your time spending the day down here just
to make a hundred dollars," said Clapp, who in the fall begins to
scan the weather report to decide whether he wants to go to work that
day.</LD>
<TE>   "When you have a blustery day, there's not many people who want to
lay on the beach and eat a hot dog."</TE>
<TE>   Clapp, 72, ought to know. He owns Dwight's, a Huntington Beach
landmark where his family has been dishing up food and renting out
umbrellas and beach gear for 70 years.</TE>
<TE>   Clapp was 2 when his father, Dwight, set up shop in 1932 during
the Great Depression.</TE>
<TE>   Dwight Clapp was a man ahead of his time, an oil field roustabout
convinced that tourism--not oil--was Huntington Beach's future.</TE>

<TE>   His father persuaded the City Council to build a lifeguard tower
on newly acquired land south of the pier, and to rent him a corner of
the tower for $100 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Before surfing became big in Surf City, Dwight Clapp was there.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife, Fae, worked seven days a week and late into the
night, forming ground beef patties by hand and chopping potatoes into
French fries.</TE>
<TE>   Hamburgers and hot dogs cost a dime; ice cream bars, candy and
soda in glass bottles a nickel. Much of the Clapps' income came from
umbrella rentals --this, of course, being before sunscreen. In its
first year, Dwight's rang up $624 in sales.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Clapp began working at Dwight's when he was 10, reclaiming
discarded soda bottles for their deposit. Growth spurred by Southern

<TE>   Eventually, Clapp moved down the beach and opened his own
concession. Taking a marketing cue from his father, he named the
place Jack's. He moved back to Dwight's when his father retired.
Today, his son Dave runs Jack's.</TE>
<TE>   Much has changed at Dwight's over seven decades. A new building
went up in 1939; it was replaced in 1967. The beach itself is four
times as wide. An hour of parking costs as much as 15 hamburgers once
did.</TE>
<TE>   And downtown Huntington Beach--once renowned as a scruffy surfer's
hangout--has gone upscale with a luxury resort and beach-view
mansions, popping up the way oil rigs once did.</TE>
<TE>   "My father said he watched bikinis change from bloomers to
Band-Aids," said Clapp, who has the easygoing manner of a man who,
like a smooth stone, has spent plenty of time around the surf.</TE>
<TE>   The menu at Dwight's has changed too--although you might need
time-lapse photography to detect it. Hamburgers don't sell like they
used to, so Clapp added chicken sandwiches 10 years ago, breakfast
burritos and fish and chips five years later.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest seller by far has been cheese strips with Dwight's
original sauce--tortilla chips, cheddar cheese and a hot sauce the
Clapp family has been making for 42 years. Dwight Clapp got the idea
from a taco stand, and the spicy red sauce he created tastes a lot

years ago called seeking sauce.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pregnant," she told Clapp. "I'm just dying to have strip
sauce."</TE>
<TE>   He froze some and Fed-Ex'd it to her.</TE>
<TE>   Clapp has made a good living with Dwight's, although it has by no
means made him rich. When his four children were growing up, he
supplemented his income with winter jobs--working at Sears, as a high
school bus driver and a driver's education instructor. In summer, he
still works at Dwight's eight or nine hours a day, nearly every day.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, I could be at home, sitting in front of the TV, but I'm
here. People need to be served," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad was 86 years old when he died. And until the end, he still
came down here and helped by renting umbrellas and boogie boards for
me.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife gets on me and says, 'Why do you spend all that time down
there?' I'm finding it difficult to relax, to take it easy and let
somebody else take responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   That somebody is Clapp's daughter. Laurie Knight and her husband,
Brandon, a high school teacher, manage the small gift shop attached
to Dwight's.</TE>
<TE>   She is prepared to take over the place once her father steps
aside.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost in our blood," said Knight, 43, who, like all of
Clapp's children, began working at Dwight's as a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   Her two girls, ages 14 and 10, already have spent time behind the
counter.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't fully appreciate what it's all about until you're an
adult," Knight said.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't until I was in my 30s and started having kids of my own
that I realized, 'Wow, this is really something.' "</TE>

<HD>Vietnamese Trade Meeting Disrupted</HD>
<DH>Activism: Protesters harass Communist delegation and
prevent Costa Mesa conference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAY F. HERNDON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Led by a former South Vietnamese army ranger, slogan-chanting
Vietnamese American protesters dogged the first trade delegation to
visit California from Communist Vietnam over the weekend, forcing the
delegates to abandon their Orange County hotel Saturday night and to
cancel a Sunday event designed to boost bilateral trade.</LD>
<LD>   The delegation, led by Nguyen Thien Nhan, the deputy mayor of Ho
Chi Minh City, was turned away from the Whittier Law School campus in
Costa Mesa, when its members arrived for a Sunday afternoon
conference. They had expected to meet chain-store buyers and
importers interested in distributing Vietnamese products.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of being greeted by business people invited to the event,
the delegates encountered an angry but orderly crowd of about 500
protesters, who waved flags of the former Republic of South Vietnam,
and chanted slogans such as "The Viet Cong are terrorists" and "Human
rights for Vietnam."</LD>
<TE>   Do Thu Van, the former South Vietnamese army ranger who helped
organize the protest, said that his followers had dogged the
delegation ever since its Saturday arrival at Los Angeles
International Airport. He said they prevented the delegates from
checking into the Hyatt Regency in Garden Grove, where they had
reservations.</TE>
<TE>   One of the event's organizers said the visitors had to go to
several hotels before they found accommodations.</TE>
<TE>   Only one of the delegates, a businesswoman who runs the world's
third-largest manufacturing plant for melamine housewares, managed to
make her way into the law school's conference center. Instead of
staying with the other delegates, she had spent the night with
relatives in Little Saigon in Westminster.</TE>
<TE>   A disappointed official of the Washington-based Vietnamese
American Business Council, which was hosting the visit, told the
small number of conference attendees who had made their way past the
protesters that it was being canceled.</TE>
<TE>   The official said that he himself was a refugee from Vietnam, and
that he understood the protesters' sentiments but their efforts were
misguided.</TE>
<TE>   "The best way to improve the lot of the people in Vietnam is
through increased trade, not political isolation," he said, speaking
on the condition that he not be quoted by name.</TE>
<TE>   "When U.S. manufacturers go there today, they ask about adherence
to labor laws and pay scales for the workers," he said. "That's a
better way to improve the lot of the people in Vietnam than waving
flags and shouting slogans."</TE>

<HD>30,000 Put Their Foot Down on Cancer</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 2,000 breast cancer survivors held their red roses high in an
emotional ceremony Sunday morning that capped the 11th annual Komen
Orange County Race for the Cure.</LD>
<LD>   Wearing pink T-shirts and choking back tears, they embraced as
speakers honored their bravery. The survivors were among some 30,000
people who participated in the 5K run and walk, a health and fitness
expo and a survivor tribute Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "These women had to fight for their lives," said Cathleen Brier,
an event organizer and survivor. "These women are ... champions,
warriors and lovers of life."</LD>
<TE>   Organizers say the Orange County event will raise up to $1.6
million for cancer research. Exact figures were not available Sunday.
The event is held in 115 other locations during the year and has
raised $450 million since its inception in 1982. It is named after
Susan G. Komen, a mother of two in Peoria, Ill., who died of breast
cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Among the 5K race winners were Carlien Cornelissen, 30, with a
time of 16 minutes, 58 seconds. In the cancer-survivor category,
Caroline McAndrews was the fastest, with a time of 20 minutes, 42
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the runners and walkers in the Orange County event were
members of large teams, including 648 people from Albertsons and
Sav-On Drugs, 610 from Hoag Cancer Center and about 560 each from the
U.S. Postal Service and Garden Grove Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Survivor Julie Weldon, 39, of Toluca Lake was among 100 people on
the Audrey's Angels team, organized by fellow survivor Audrey
Bierman.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad to be here with my own hair," said Weldon, who regrew
hers after six months of chemotherapy and two months of radiation.
"It's encouraging. Sometimes you feel like you're on an island, and
here there's comfort knowing you are not alone."</TE>
<TE>   Four Orange County artists allowed survivors to add to their
half-completed paintings. The images will be made into cards and sold
to raise money for organizing other events during next year's race.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Lee, 51, of San Juan Capistrano was diagnosed with breast
cancer in June 2001 and began feeling better only two weeks ago. On
Sunday, she walked in the event and also took a whirl at painting.</TE>
<TE>   "The event makes survivors feel so special," Lee said. "Now we get
to [paint] and leave something special behind."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden Grove) was on hand to show support.</TE>
<TE>   "One person with breast cancer is one too many," Sanchez said.
"Breast cancer, if detected, is one of the easiest cancers to
rescind. It's all about getting the information out."</TE>
<TE>   This year in Orange County, about 1,785 cases of breast cancer
will be diagnosed and 350 people will die of it, according to event
organizers. A woman's chance of getting breast cancer is about 1 in
200 by age 40, 1 in 50 by age 50 and 1 in 25 by age 60.</TE>
<TE>   Several survivors said they learned of their cancers only after
badgering doctors about unusual changes they had noticed during
breast self-exams.</TE>
<TE>   Janine McMillion of Huntington Beach was diagnosed when she was
29, just as she was getting married and finishing law school.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like someone put a brick wall in front of me and said,
'Get through it,' " she said. She passed the bar exam despite the
debilitating effects of chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   But McMillion, now 35, says that, had she not insisted that
doctors order more tests, "I'd be dead right now."</TE>

<LD>Alexander Mosich Miller careens around the playground at A.E. Wright
Middle School in Calabasas, skateboarding off stairs, riding rails
and grinding metal against asphalt.</LD>
<LD>   The wide-open pavement, staircases and ramps are perfect for the
13-year-old boy's high-flying antics. He hustles to get in a few
stunts before a maintenance worker chases him off the school grounds.</LD>
<LD>   Alexander and his skating buddies tried the Calabasas temporary
skate park when it opened two years ago but soon grew bored with its
beginner equipment set up on a basketball court at Gates Canyon Park.</LD>
<TE>   "The park was kind of small," Alexander said, shrugging his broad
shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other communities where skate parks are thriving, Calabasas
saw attendance plummet, prompting the City Council last week to shut
it down.</TE>
<TE>   It was an inauspicious end to a park launched with much fanfare in
October 2000, in response to the death of 16-year-old Jason Lewin,
who was hit by a car in June 1997 while roller skating in Calabasas.
A group of youths and parents, called Save Our Skaters, pushed the
city to create a safe place to skate.</TE>
<TE>   The city spent $17,373 to buy equipment, pay staff salaries and
lease a storage unit for equipment. The skate park was open four
hours a day about three times a week. Skaters, required to wear
helmets and pads, paid a $2 user fee.</TE>
<TE>   About 600 skaters signed waivers to skate at the park when it
opened, but now it is deserted.</TE>
<TE>   "I would drive around town and see kids skating, and I told them
about the skate park," said Jeff Rubin, the city's community service
director. "They said they didn't want to wear helmets and pads. They
said it was too small. They wanted bowls built into concrete."</TE>
<TE>   Rubin's department offered discounted admission passes, skating
lessons and private parties to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas Mayor James Bozajian said a permanent skate park is out
of reach for the community of 20,000 residents because of exorbitant
land prices, lack of suitable locations and neighborhood resistance
to the noise.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a small city and we can't afford to spend millions on a
venture and have it fail," he said, adding that with a temporary park
the city was "spending minimally to offer a service."</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't enough for Calabasas skaters who would rather travel
to skate parks in Ventura and Simi Valley that feature half-pipes,
quarter-pipes, bowls, ramps, humps and rails.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Calabasas, many communities across Southern California are
spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on large, challenging
courses that draw thousands of kids. Communities with flourishing
skate parks include Diamond Bar, San Dimas, La Verne, Compton,
Lynwood and Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Since 2001, Los Angeles has opened skate parks in Van Nuys,
Sunland, Boyle Heights, East Los Angeles and South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a voyage of discovery, because we didn't know if it was
a fad or not," said Tony Coroalles, who oversees the parks for the
city's recreation and parks department. "But it looks like it's going
to be around for a while."</TE>

over smooth concrete from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily at the free park,
near a high school, teen center and a public bus line.</TE>

<HD>Man Killed With Ax in Oceanside</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A pickax slaying and a fatal stabbing occurred Sunday within about an
hour of each other in San Diego County, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   In Oceanside, a sheriff's deputy shot and wounded a man who
allegedly killed another man using a pickax.</LD>
<LD>   Alberto Hernandez, 28, of Oceanside was arrested on suspicion of
murder. He was being held without bail.</LD>
<TE>   Deputies found an unidentified man on a sidewalk with severe head
wounds. A pickax in the backyard of a nearby residence was believed
to be the weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Police found the victim about 1:05 a.m. and said they spotted
Hernandez hiding in the bushes about a mile from where the killing
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   After being ordered out, Hernandez allegedly lunged at Deputy Jon
Coppedge, a five-year veteran. Coppedge fired one shot and hit
Hernandez in the upper torso. Hernandez was taken to Palomar Hospital
and underwent surgery.</TE>
<TE>   At 2:15 a.m., San Diego police found a woman with numerous stab
wounds in an apartment. The unidentified victim died at Mercy
Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Officers also found a man with stab wounds to his arms and a
second man with a stab wound to his hand. The second man, whose name
wasn't immediately released, told police he tried to disarm the first
man who had just stabbed a woman and was trying to cut his own
wrists.</TE>
<TE>   The stabbing suspect was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center. His
name was not immediately released.</TE>
<TE>   In nearby El Cajon, police Sunday were investigating an apparent
murder-suicide after finding a man and a woman shot in their
apartment Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Two teenage daughters of the woman were in the apartment and one
witnessed the shooting, police said. The daughters have been placed
with relatives as police continue their investigation.</TE>

<HD>Ventura County Turns to Alternative Energy</HD>
<DH>Environment: Its fire stations are getting solar panels,
and the official fleet now includes 'hybrid' vehicles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a major bid to plug into cheaper, "greener" energy sources,
Ventura County has begun installing solar panels on fire stations and
buying hybrid vehicles powered by gas and electricity.</LD>
<LD>   Twelve of the county's 31 fire stations are at least partly run on
solar energy, and another dozen may join them soon.</LD>
<LD>   "As a result of the ongoing electrical crisis in California, the
county looked at ways it can be both self-reliant and also be a good
citizen by reducing its load on the grid in general," said county
Energy Manager David Inger. "The California Energy Commission offers
a very large incentive for solar, which basically cut the cost in
half."</LD>
<TE>   With rebates and state grants, it costs about $7,000 to install
each solar system on a firehouse. They reduce a station's daily
electricity use by up to 25%.</TE>
<TE>   The stations were chosen because they are large, are open 24 hours
a day and consume a lot of electricity.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, most are in neighborhoods where people can see them
and perhaps be inspired to buy a system, said Abbe Berns,
administrative manager for the county Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   Libraries, jails, police departments or community centers may be
future candidates, depending on funding availability.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County joins other communities around the country moving
toward cheaper, cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels and nuclear
energy.</TE>
<TE>   City and county buildings in San Francisco, San Diego, Oakland,
Chicago and Los Angeles are being either totally or partly powered by
solar energy, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the county has purchased eight hybrid Toyota Priuses
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We will explore any technology that will reduce emissions and
enhance fuel economy," said Ventura County transportation manager
Dennis Scamardo.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Steve Bennett, a strong supporter of alternative
energy, will ask the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday to buy several
more hybrid cars to replace the Chevy Cavaliers in the county fleet.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have a conflict in the Middle East, who knows what will
happen to the price of oil?" Bennett said. "Energy use will be a
security issue, not just an environmental and conservation issue."</TE>
<TE>   The county's solar systems were built by BP, the British oil
company that is also one of the world's leading manufacturers of
solar panels.</TE>
<TE>   "We do a lot of work in California because of the electricity
situation," said BP spokesman Todd Foley. "Last year, our sales were
up 35% in California. With solar, there is virtually no maintenance,
no fueling and you can do it with almost no emissions."</TE>
<TE>   Some 380 BP service stations around the world are powered by solar
energy, and BP-owned ARCO stations are outfitting many of their 1,700
facilities with solar systems, Foley said.</TE>
<TE>   The solar cells atop the county fire stations generate up to 25%
of their daily electricity and are expected to save each facility an
average of $1,000 a year on utility bills, Inger said.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have put them all in one place or spread them around,"
he said. "We decided to parcel them out. Our target is to install
another 12 systems."</TE>
<TE>   Stations in Camarillo, Simi Valley and Ventura have received solar
panels over the last four months.</TE>
<TE>   The systems are unobtrusive, installed on areas of roof where the
sun shines longest.</TE>
<TE>   A fire station on Pacific Coast Highway just north of Ventura has
16 panels on its roof, producing about 2,500 watts a day.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be nice to see every station have them," said Capt.
Richard Lajoie, looking up at the cells.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Irwin, president of Advanced Solar Electric of Agoura Hills,
which installed the panels, said his company has focused on homes,
but he is now seeing increased interest from cities and counties.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really gaining momentum," he said. "The buzz is on that
solar is a great thing and it's getting bigger."</TE>

<DL>OCOTILLO WELLS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>A magnitude 4.1 earthquake rattled eastern San Diego County on
Saturday, but apparently caused no injuries or damage.</LD>
<LD>   The quake struck at 2:26 p.m. and was centered six miles north of
Ocotillo Wells, near the Imperial County line, according to the U.S.
Geological Survey. The area is 80 miles south of Palm Springs.</LD>
<LD>   There were no reports of damage or injury, said a San Diego County
sheriff's dispatcher.</LD>

<HD>Fire Officials Lead Attack on Wooden Roofs</HD>
<DH>Safety: County seeks funds to take aerial photos of
high-risk homes, and to pay subsidies for replacing shake shingles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a brush fire raged in the Verdugo Mountains above Glendale and
Burbank earlier this month, San Gabriel Fire Department Capt. John
Hostetter pointed to the principal source of worry on the evacuated
street he had come to protect.</LD>
<LD>   It was a wood-shingled roof--tasteful, a tad rustic, and perhaps,
if untreated with modern fire retardants, the riskiest feature for a
home in a fire hazard area.</LD>
<LD>   "If the wind sends the flames over this ridge," said Hostetter,
nodding to the top of a cream-colored ranch house, "that one's in
trouble."</LD>
<TE>   Firefighters are not fans of wooden roofs. Unless treated with
flame retardants, the roofs easily catch fire and help spread a
fast-moving blaze. And though high insurance rates and recent
government policies attempt to dissuade homeowners from keeping wood
roofs, fire officials say there are still thousands of them in the
paths of future brush fires in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   County Fire Department officials recently requested $25,000 in
federal funds for aerial photographs to help identify every wooden
roof in the riskiest fire areas. Officials say the photographs could
provide crucial information to firefighters, who could use the photos
to determine the most vulnerable spots in fire-threatened
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The county also requested $500,000 from the National Park Service
for a pilot program to offer subsidies to homeowners in the Santa
Monica Mountains who replace wood roofs with safer materials.
Replacing a roof on an average house can cost roughly $5,000 to
$15,000, industry officials said.</TE>
<TE>   If successful, the program could be expanded throughout the
county, said Frank Vidales, a forester with the County Fire
Department's Fire Plan Unit, who helped write the grant requests. He
said the county would know within a month if it received the funds.</TE>
<TE>   "[Wood roofing] is one of the biggest reasons we lose structures
to fire," said Vidales. "It's kindling on a rooftop."</TE>
<TE>   Typically made of western red cedars--the same soft, light wood
used for totem poles--wooden roofs were popular in California and the
Pacific Northwest until recent decades. Their popularity declined as
development crept into more fire-prone areas and as high-profile
disasters, such as the 1991 Oakland Hills blaze, which destroyed
3,000 homes, were blamed in part on wooden roofing.</TE>
<TE>   The wood roof industry, however, bristles at suggestions that its
products are unsafe. Treated wood shingles were developed to meet
most low-level safety ratings in the 1970s, said Tom Melum, director
of governmental affairs for Chemco, a Washington-based wood treatment
company. And since the late 1990s, wood roofs have been available
with Class-A fire-safety ratings, the federal government's highest,
Melum said.</TE>
<TE>   California law requires that all wood roofs sold in the state be
treated with fire retardant and pass a natural weathering test. Some
cities and municipalities have enacted stricter laws. The city of Los
Angeles bans wood roofs on new homes, as well as the replacement of
existing ones, despite advances in flame retardants.</TE>
<TE>   "We have too many mountainous areas in the city, and we've had
such bad luck with those types of roofs that the powers that be have
decided not to allow them," said Bob Steinbach, the chief inspector
with the city's Building and Safety Department.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Cerritos instituted a similar ban after a jet crashed
into a subdivision in August 1986, sparking a devastating fire that
was fueled in part by wood-shake roofs. Last year, however, the city
reversed the ban, allowing new roofs with a Class-A rating, Assistant
City Manager Dennis Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Fire Department considered creating maps
identifying wood roofs in some neighborhoods in the late 1990s. But
the idea led to public outrage when a firefighter suggested that
those homes would be "written off" in a major fire. Fire Chief Bob
Franco said the mapping plan was abandoned due to the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   County officials suggest that owners of wood-roofed houses pay
extra attention to brush clearance and other fire prevention
measures.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Davis, the owner of the home in the Verdugo Mountains that
Hostetter thought could be in trouble during the brush fire, said his
home was fine. But the blaze made him realize it was time to replace
his roof, which has not had flame retardant applied for more than 20
years. If the county would kick in a few thousand dollars to help him
buy a new roof, Davis said, he'd take it.</TE>
<TE>   "But I do love the way these look," he said, nodding toward his
cascade of dark brown shingles. "It's stupid ... but I'm into
aesthetics."</TE>

<HD>'Idol' Goes to Vegas, and Everywhere Else</HD>
<DH>A Fox special is one in a long line of appearances by Kelly
Clarkson</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Debbie Allen keeps getting in Kelly Clarkson's face.</LD>
<LD>   Wherever the newly crowned "American Idol" goes, Allen is right
behind her, insisting, "You want fame? Well, fame costs. And here is
where you start paying. In sweat."</LD>
<LD>   Well, not exactly.</LD>
<TE>   Clarkson has never met Allen or seen the TV series "Fame," in
which Allen, who played a demanding dance teacher at New York's High
School of the Performing Arts, makes the declaration that opened each
episode.</TE>
<TE>   But Allen's words certainly fit with the grueling schedule
Clarkson has faced in the almost three weeks since she beat hundreds
of hopefuls to win Fox's hit "American Idol" talent competition.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, only a few days after her first single hit stores, she
said she is more interested in artistry than celebrity. "I'm not
seeking fame," Clarkson said Thursday, the day after taping "American
Idol in Vegas," a Fox special airing tonight spotlighting the 30
"American Idol" finalists performing at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las
Vegas. "I'm glad that I have a job I really enjoy. I love singing."</TE>
<TE>   But if Clarkson says being a celebrity is not her top priority,
the forces behind "American Idol" have put their star-making
machinery in overdrive, putting her on the fast track to fame.</TE>
<TE>   In their design to transform the former cocktail waitress into a
true American idol, her new managers--the Britain-based 19
Entertainment--have put her on a dizzying, seemingly nonstop schedule
of talk-show and public appearances, with the goal of making her
fresh face and voice an unavoidable beacon on the pop culture
landscape.</TE>
<TE>   "She is going to be very busy," said Tom Ennis, who runs 19
Entertainment in the U.S. "There's pressure any time you have to
stick to a tremendous schedule. The amount of attention thrust
suddenly on her is a tremendous burden to bear. But Kelly is
completely and totally a pro, and she's handling it."</TE>
<TE>   Clarkson's "Idol" triumph scored her a record contract with RCA
Records, and her first single, with the songs "Before Your Love" and
"A Moment Like This," is already a huge seller after its release last
week. RCA Records is preparing to get Clarkson into the studio for
work on her debut album, which 19 Entertainment executives would like
to get into stores by Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   Today, in addition to appearing on the Las Vegas special, Clarkson
is scheduled to appear on "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno," which
tapes in the afternoon (she first appeared on the show Sept. 5, the
day after winning the competition). Later tonight, she is slated to
sing at a big charity event on Rodeo Drive.</TE>
<TE>   Other appearances this week to promote the single include the
syndicated "Live With Regis and Kelly," NBC's "The Today Show," MTV's
"Total Request Live" and other gigs. Meanwhile, preparations are
continuing for the national 28-city tour starting in early October
that will feature Clarkson, "Idol" runner-up Justin Guarini and the
other top 10 finalists.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone will have a solo, but there will be more of an emphasis
on Kelly because she is the 'American Idol,' " Ennis said. "She will
have more solos."</TE>
<TE>   There's also the shooting of the "American Idol" Christmas special
in Aspen, Colo., also with Clarkson and the 10 finalists. And
starting early next year, Clarkson and Guarini will begin shooting a
musical film produced by 19 Entertainment for release in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the relentless schedule, Clarkson will hold up well, Ennis
believes."She is already a seasoned professional. We got reports back
from her first video shoot, which turned out to be a 20-hour day. She
never flagged."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the experience for Clarkson is likely to be overwhelming,
said Lou Pearlman, the Orlando entertainment mogul behind the
creation of popular boy bands the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync.
Pearlman also created the group O-Town for the ABC unscripted series
"Making the Band." O-Town briefly flirted with fame but has not been
heard from much lately.</TE>
<TE>   "With O-Town, all the guys had each other," Pearlman said. "But
Kelly is a solo artist, and there is no one else to lean on at the
end of the day. She has all the pressure and all the expectations. It
can get very overwhelming. There will be a lot of long days. It's
what she has to do to become a big star."</TE>
<TE>   Simon Fuller, the founder of 19 Entertainment and the key creative
force behind hit phenoms the Spice Girls and S Club 7, has
established an infrastructure that will keep Clarkson sane and
focused during the next several months, Ennis said. One 19 executive
will be with Clarkson at all times, assisting her and coordinating
her schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "We put our artists with the right people that will be their
friends," Ennis said.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Sanders, executive vice president and general manager of
RCA Records, said he is impressed with Clarkson's stamina.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as stardom goes, she's been on a real accelerated
program," Sanders said. "In the beginning, the same kinds of things
were happening with Britney Spears and 'N Sync, but they had nowhere
near the kind of exposure that Kelly has. No one has ever been
through this rigorous a schedule. And she has come through it great."</TE>
<TE>   But now Clarkson really has to prove she has the goods to make it
as a star, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The record is pivotal," Sanders said. "There are very few
long-term careers. Kelly didn't win just because she could sing well.
She has gone through the wringer to get to this point. She is very
competitive, and she has the will to succeed. We don't want her
record to be a souvenir of 'American Idol.' We want it to be a
meaningful showcase for her."</TE>
<TE>   Which means that despite the ideal scenario, there might not be a
Kelly Clarkson album by Christmas, although a note on the back cover
of her new single promises that her album will be in stores Nov. 26.</TE>
<TE>   "From a marketing perspective, yes, that would be ideal," Sanders
said. "But we won't put out a record that isn't a strong statement
for her. The record isn't even on our release schedule this year."</TE>
<TE>   Sanders added, "It would be easy to slap together 10 covers, two
original songs and just put a record out there. But if we can find 12
great songs and get it in the stores by Christmas, it would be great
and we would look like geniuses. However, it has to be a record
she'll be proud of."</TE>
<TE>   Sanders said that Clarkson's current high profile and the desire
to strike while she is surrounded by media attention will not detour
plans to put out the best possible album.</TE>
<TE>   "We've worked with 19 before, and we have a great relationship,"
he said. "This is a forced marriage, but we're here to work together.
This will not be a concern. They will want the best record for her."</TE>
<TE>   He is also eager to start putting the album together, which has
been difficult with Clarkson's frantic schedule: "We've had very
little time to talk. We've just grabbed bits and pieces. None of our
marketing people have met her."</TE>
<TE>   The first step, Sanders said, is for RCA's artists and repertoire
staff to sit down with Clarkson and determine a musical reference
point for her. "On 'American Idol,' the contestants sang cover songs
that were not relevant to them emotionally," he said. "We want to ask
Kelly what she wants to do musically."</TE>
<TE>   One worry that Sanders doesn't have is finding talent to work with
Clarkson: "There are no shortage of A and A-plus producers and
writers who want to be involved: People who have worked with Whitney
Houston, Jennifer Lopez, Mariah Carey. Everyone recognizes her talent
and visibility. They're not giving a song to a nameless, faceless
novice. This is an opportunity to hook up with someone who was loved
by 20 million people."</TE>
<TE>   Clarkson is also eager to get to the album, and a little fatigue
is just a minor inconvenience at this point.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been busy, and this is just a different kind of busy.
I don't feel that much pressure," Clarkson said. "They prepared all
of us for a lot of this stuff in the beginning. This is fun."</TE>
<TE>   "American Idol in Vegas" will be shown from 8 to 10 tonight on
Fox.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fox's "John Doe" made the biggest name for itself among new programs
premiering over the weekend, while ABC's telecast of the Miss America
Pageant walked off with the ratings crown Saturday but came up short
compared with last year, based on preliminary estimates from Nielsen
Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Fox got a jump on competitors by launching a pair of new dramas
Friday: "John Doe"--about a man who knows everything, except his own
identity--and "Firefly," an expensive sci-fi premise from "Buffy the
Vampire Slayer" producer Joss Whedon.</LD>
<LD>   "Doe" was the clear standout of the night, averaging 9.6 million
viewers, Fox's best Friday premiere since "Millennium" in 1996.
"Firefly" was less impressive, with an audience of 6.3 million.</LD>
<TE>   "Miss America," meanwhile, easily won Saturday night for ABC with
just under 12 million viewers, down about 13% compared with last
year. The audience grew from 8 million at 8 p.m. to over 16 million
at the end three hours later.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Is it mere coincidence or do The Times' TV critics feel so
self-conscious about their own corporate cross-promotion and de facto
journalistic limitations that readers got not one but two
hypocritical homilies on media ethics the same week?</LD>
<LD>   First came Brian Lowry's take on the popularity (and scam
potential) of lucrative TV talk shows starring psychics who claim to
contact the dead ("Room for Doubt?," Sept. 4). Lowry dutifully
recited the by-now perfunctory Calendar mantra/disclaimer: that one
of the programs in his piece ("Beyond With James Van Praagh") will
appear on KTLA, which is owned by Tribune, which owns the Los Angeles
Times.</LD>
<LD>   Upon quoting a professional debunker of the paranormal, Tribune
employee Lowry is told by Tribune executive Donna Harrison that
although there are rip-offs and fakes, she'll "control the integrity
of 'Beyond With James Van Praagh.' " Still skeptical, Lowry laments
that readers should not expect "equal time" for those--like him--with
doubts.</LD>
<TE>   The ethical and institutional quandary Lowry found himself in was
evident in his sarcastic apology, wherein he confessed that
dollars--not truth--seem to be the primary motivation behind such
programming, and that "as a Tribune employee and stockholder, I
couldn't be prouder."</TE>
<TE>   I could have sworn I felt the rumble of the late Fred
Friendly--CBS News producer, executive, journalism professor and
Socratic conscience of American news media--turning over in his
grave.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later arrived Howard Rosenberg's homily on the ethics of
journalism ("A Journalist Breaks the Golden Rule," Sept. 6).
Rosenberg tellingly introduced the piece by saying that "many of us
in the media are potentially compromised ... because we work for
conglomerates whose sprawling interests cut across our news beats."</TE>
<TE>   I thought at first that he was apologizing for Lowry's recent
predicament, but Rosenberg's lament centered on the alleged sins of
reporter Anna Song at KATU-TV in Oregon City, Ore., whom Rosenberg
zapped for creating a "conflict of interest" when she gave a eulogy
for two girls whose murders she had been covering for the station.</TE>
<TE>   "Reporters," wrote Rosenberg, "are not hired to write columns or
commentaries. They report stories, which are meant to exclude
opinion. Commentaries (like this one) are written by columnists and
labeled as opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Really? Then why go to all the trouble of making a long-distance
phone call to KATU? Rosenberg could have made a local call or taken a
Tribune-provided car over to Tribune-owned KTLA and asked why
millions of viewers have to listen to news anchor-windbag Hal Fishman
morph from purported "objective" newsman to passionate
commentator--not occasionally, but five nights a week--on our
publicly owned airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   At least KATU's journalistic faux pas had an element of heartfelt
community sentiment, whereas Fishman's blustering commentaries
reflect personal piques and sweeping pronouncements on everything
from local politics to international diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly Rosenberg knows that at newspapers, including The Times,
editorial and freelance opinion writers work independently of news
managers. But Fishman wears both hats at KTLA. And unlike a
newspaper's daily letters/opinion forum, KTLA--a TV station with
millions of viewers--affords no rebuttal time for viewers who
disagree with Fishman.</TE>
<TE>   Since there is no journalistic fire wall between Hal Fishman the
news editor and his opinionated doppelganger, one would think that
professional media critics like Lowry and Rosenberg might pontificate
on this blatant conflict of interest going on loudly next door under
the same corporate roof.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the only entity with the power to criticize or challenge
KTLA in print is The Times--which itself has become a nightly feature
on KTLA wherein Times reporters preview their print stories.</TE>
<TE>   If that's not a potential conflict of interest, then try to
imagine KTLA reporter Ron Olsen bellowing: "And now an exclusive
preview of a scandal uncovered here at KTLA by the L.A. Times."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg eloquently expressed concern about "something dangerous
that is edging forward nationally: a blurring of lines separating
news media from newsmakers in television. It's a growing trend that
threatens to erode the independence of journalists working on the
small screen."</TE>
<TE>   That fuzziness also threatens to erode the objectivity of those
once considered the best watchdogs of public interest: journalists at
newspapers not hamstrung by incestuous corporate relationships.</TE>

<HD>Luckman Orchestra Delivers Ellington's Work With Flair</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Duke Ellington's attraction to sacred music played a powerful role in
the last decade of his life. His first full-fledged program of sacred
compositions, commissioned by San Francisco's Grace Cathedral in
1965, was largely--with the exception of "In the Beginning, God"--a
compilation of previous selections from works such as "Black, Brown
and Beige." His second concert of sacred music, premiered at
Manhattan's Cathedral of St. John the Divine, included virtually
all-new efforts, as did the third sacred music concert, at London's
Westminster Abbey in 1973.</LD>
<LD>   Although Ellington's sacred works have never quite received the
public attention allocated to his songs or, for that matter, to his
jazz orchestral pieces, they have been recorded and performed, in
bits and pieces, by a wide range of artists.</LD>
<LD>   None, however, has matched either the authenticity or the
enthusiasm of the Luckman Jazz Orchestra's presentation of selections
from all of Ellington's three sacred concerts on Saturday night at
the Faithful Central Bible Church in Inglewood.</LD>
<TE>   Aided by a choir and soloists from five churches, the orchestra,
conducted with great flair by James Newton, offered a full evening of
the superb Ellington music that the ensemble had minimally offered in
the festival's opening event on Sept. 14.</TE>
<TE>   In that performance, the orchestra's sound was badly damaged by a
distorted audio mix. No such problem at Faithful Central's huge,
warehouse-like hall, however, with its state-of-the-art sound and
careful reproduction.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the sheer beauty of the Ellington score, from the
stunning spirituality of "In the Beginning, God" to the climactic
rhythms of "David Danced Before the Lord With All His Might," emerged
with pristine musical clarity.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, the orchestra reaffirmed its growing importance as
one of the Southland's premiere musical ensembles. Blessed with a
hugely talented array of soloists--saxophonists Bennie Maupin, Jack
Nimitz, Keith Fiddmont and Charles Owens, trumpeters Nolan Shaheed,
Bobby Rodriguez and Bijon Watson, trombonists George Bohannon and
Isaac Smith, pianist Lanny Hartley--and driven by the propulsive
drumming of Leon "Ndugu" Chancler, the orchestra brilliantly captured
Ellington's remarkable blending of musical joy and spiritual
devotion.</TE>
<TE>   The highlights came in profusion: Nimitz's baritone soloing on
"Praise God," so reminiscent of Ellington's longtime sideman, Harry
Carney; the congregation-rousing musical preaching of trumpeter
Shaheed on "The Shepherd Who Watches Over the Night Flock";
trombonist Bohanon leading the musical charge of the orchestra and
chorus in "It's Freedom"; the fleet tap-dancing of young Landry Barb
II on "David Danced Before the Lord With All His Might"; and the
sweet soprano voice of Aladrian Elmore on "My Love."</TE>
<TE>   Add to that the overall interaction between orchestra and chorus
and the vocal contributions of bass Cedric Berry (especially on "In
the Beginning, God") and Henrietta Davis (who is the conductor of
Faithful Central's Heritage Chorale) and the result was an evening to
remember--a rare, wonderful opportunity to experience the creative
powers of one of jazz's (and, perhaps, the 20th century's) most
important composers, at the service of spiritual universality.</TE>

<HD>To Most U.S. Architecture Critics, New L.A. Cathedral Is a
Triumph</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE DUTKA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three weeks after its opening, Los Angeles' Cathedral of Our Lady of
the Angels, designed by Spanish architect Jose Rafael Moneo, is
enjoying, with few exceptions, critical thumbs up.</LD>
<LD>   The Wall Street Journal's David Littlejohn called the structure
"the most impressive large interior space ever built in Los
Angeles"--a building that has "nothing to do with the entertainment
industry and very little to do with the wealthy Anglo businessmen and
politicians who have decided since the 1920s what this sprawl of a
city would look like." The architect, he wrote, created an exterior
that's "intentionally blank and introspective," encouraging people to
penetrate the enclosure to discover the "wondrous, light-filled world
inside."</LD>
<LD>   John King of the San Francisco Chronicle observed that the
structure won't single-handedly "bring life to a moribund downtown,
as boosters claim, or serve as the town square for this formless city
of 3.7 million people." Still, the cathedral, is "a triumph that
conveys the essence of both religious faith and great architecture,"
he said, and possibly "the most significant building to open in the
United States this year."</LD>
<TE>   Richard Lacayo of Time magazine labeled the cathedral, the first
built in the United States in 25 years, a "signal event ... with
roots simultaneously in the here and now and in the sunlit antiquity
of the Mediterranean rim." The ground-level church "lacks the
imposing central portal that has signified a great church from the
time of Gothic cathedrals," he lamented, "but when the light falls
across the great central space ... it provides exactly the great
climax that [Moneo's] long, hushed corridor promised."</TE>
<TE>   Alan Hess of the San Jose Mercury News wrote that Moneo has
designed a "landmark-class building" distinguished by "clean,
sharp-edged abstraction." The "most riveting" piece of artwork, says
Hess: "Robert Graham's two 25-ton bronze doors that depict a variety
of multicultural images and contrast well with the entryway's
concrete walls."</TE>
<TE>   The New Yorker, however, was less impressed. Observing how
difficult it is to make a landmark in Los Angeles--a city that is
"relentlessly horizontal"--Paul Goldberger compared the cathedral ("a
big, horizontal mass") to the Beverly Center or that blue glass
whale, the Pacific Design Center. Frank Gehry's "swooping forms" at
the Walt Disney Concert Hall nearby are more "conventionally
cathedral-like," he maintained.</TE>
<TE>   If anything about the building's exterior stirs the emotions,
Goldberger suggested, it's the 2 1/2-acre plaza, which "manages to be
a true public place--the poor man's Getty Center, which is not an
insignificant achievement." And, despite "dreary representational
art" and "fussy chandeliers," the interior is "a sumptuous modern
space."</TE>
<TE>   All in all, he concluded Moneo has made a "valiant effort to
render sacred space on a large scale, and he has done it without
tricks or gimmicks."</TE>

<HD>HBO, NBC Duel to Standoff</HD>
<DH>TV: Each network ends up with 24 awards. 'West Wing' is
best drama for a third year; 'Friends' is finally recognized as best
comedy series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC's "The West Wing" pulled off a rare three-peat as outstanding
drama series while "Friends" was recognized as best comedy for the
first time in its storied eight-year run at the 54th annual Emmy
Awards, which honored the best in prime-time and late-night
television programming Sunday night at the Shrine Auditorium.</LD>
<LD>   The evening boiled down to a back-and-forth duel that went down to
the final award between NBC, the top-rated broadcast network, which
televised the ceremony; and Home Box Office, the pay-cable channel
that earned the most nominations this year. All other networks were
left far behind them.</LD>
<LD>   For the year, NBC and HBO each finished with 24 awards--including
more than 60 categories devoted primarily to technical areas such as
editing and sound, which were presented Sept. 14. The next closest
networks, CBS and Fox, totaled seven apiece.</LD>
<TE>   By contrast, ABC--a network that struggled for ratings this past
season--was shut out in the categories awarded Sunday, receiving just
five awards for the past season.</TE>
<TE>   "Friends" is television's top-rated program and is heading into
what could be the hit NBC comedy's final year. Although hugely
popular, the program had never previously been named best comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Aniston was also chosen as best actress for the show.
Until last season, the show's six co-stars mutually agreed to submit
themselves in the supporting actor categories. Lisa Kudrow, who plays
Phoebe, was the only one among them to have won an Emmy.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Allison Janney of "The West Wing" promoted herself to
lead actress and earned her third consecutive Emmy, having taken home
supporting honors in the show's first two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   In what was clearly an upset, Michael Chiklis--star of the gritty
police drama "The Shield," carried on the little-seen FX cable
network--was named best actor in a drama, beating out "The West
Wing's" Martin Sheen and the two stars of HBO's "Six Feet Under."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, "Six Feet Under," a quirky drama that focuses on how
people deal with death through the eyes of a family that runs a
mortuary, was largely overlooked Sunday. Series creator Alan Ball--an
Oscar winner for writing the Academy Award-winning film "American
Beauty"--was chosen as best director of a drama series for the first
episode.</TE>
<TE>   "Six Feet Under" garnered five awards at the earlier event,
including honors for casting, music, makeup and main title design, as
well as guest actress Patricia Clarkson.</TE>
<TE>   Before "The West Wing," the last program to earn three consecutive
dramatic Emmys was NBC's "L.A. Law," which ended its three-year reign
in 1991. The political drama totaled five Emmys, having established a
new plateau in its first season with nine and equaled the previous
record of eight for its second term.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Romano was named best actor in a comedy for "Everybody Loves
Raymond," completing a near-acting sweep for the CBS program, as
Doris Roberts claimed her second Emmy in a row as the overbearing
mother and Brad Garrett won his first as the title character's
set-upon brother.</TE>
<TE>   Garrett--who started his career as a stand-up comedian--drew big
laughs with his acceptance speech, saying, "I just hope that this
award breaks down the door for Jewish people who are trying to get
into show business."</TE>
<TE>   Given that last year's Emmys were postponed twice due to events
related to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, this year's telecast
marked what organizers saw as a welcome return to normality, as host
Conan O'Brien kept the emphasis on comedy; still, the events of last
year were hardly forgotten, including dual honors Sunday related to
the special "America: A Tribute to Heroes"--one of them presented by
former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani--staged to benefit its
victims.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, HBO's success in the field of movies and miniseries--a
discipline in which the broadcast networks have dramatically scaled
back production in recent years--contributed mightily to its final
tally.</TE>
<TE>   The subscription service's victory roster included six awards for
"Band of Brothers," the epic 10-hour miniseries based on a real-life
World War II unit. The $120-million production was named best
miniseries and drew a standing ovation for the surviving members of
the much-decorated outfit, Easy Company, some of whom were in
attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Another HBO project tied to that period--"The Gathering Storm,"
which documented Winston Churchill's life before World War II--was
voted best movie, with additional honors for star Albert Finney and
the movie's screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   HBO has now won the award for best movie nine times in the last
decade--a streak only interrupted two years ago by ABC's "Tuesdays
With Morrie."</TE>
<TE>   Awards are voted on and presented by members of the Academy of
Television Arts &amp; Sciences, a nonprofit television industry
organization, and cover the period from June 1, 2001, through May 31
this year.</TE>
<TE>   HBO's popular Mafia drama "The Sopranos" did not air during that
period and thus was not eligible this year for consideration.
However, during the show O'Brien at one point joked about switching a
bank of TV sets in the background to the series, which aired opposite
the Emmy telecast.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting the repetition that has come to characterize some Emmy
categories, CBS' "Late Show With David Letterman" gathered its fifth
consecutive victory as outstanding music, comedy or variety series.</TE>
<TE>   Although shut out in awards presented Sunday, "Frasier" also
claimed three Emmys at the earlier ceremony to pass "The Mary Tyler
Moore Show" as the most-honored series, having amassed 30 awards in
nine seasons. Preparing to enter its 10th season, the NBC comedy
amassed an all-time record five straight best comedy Emmys during the
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Like "Raymond," "The West Wing" swept its supporting actor
categories. John Spencer became the drama's third straight co-star to
win, following fellow nominees Richard Schiff and Bradley Whitford.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Stockard Channing was honored for her role as the
first lady after Janney bowed out of the supporting actress category.
Nominated seven times previously without winning, Channing also
picked up a second statuette for co-starring in the fact-based NBC
movie "The Matthew Shepard Story."</TE>
<TE>   Two first-year Fox programs took the comedy and drama writing
awards. Larry Wilmore won for "The Bernie Mac Show," while the
co-creators of Fox's serialized drama "24"--a critically acclaimed
program that only barely earned renewal for a second season because
of its modest ratings--were recognized on the dramatic side.</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony also featured a new Bob Hope Humanitarian Award,
following a $1-million donation by Hope to the academy. The honor was
presented to talk-show host Oprah Winfrey, whom actress Julia Roberts
called in a taped tribute "a girlfriend to the world."</TE>
<TE>   "I will continue to strive to give back to the world what it has
given to me," said Winfrey, who received a rousing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   The Governors Award, another special honor bestowed to an
achievement deemed especially worthy that year, was shared by the
major networks for their cooperation in mounting the charity concert
"America: A Tribute to Heroes." The special was also named
outstanding variety, music or comedy special.</TE>
<TE>   Rock star Ozzy Osbourne and his family--who star in MTV's hit
series "The Osbournes," named best nonfiction program, or so-called
reality series, at the earlier presentation--also appeared Sunday
night. Osbourne's wife Sharon, who is being treated for cancer,
thanked those in the audience for their prayers and good wishes.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The calendar said it was the first day of fall, but the stars on the
red carpet at Sunday's Emmy Awards turned out dressed for spring in
colorful, billowing gowns. That was a good--and cool--thing
considering the sweltering heat outside the Shrine Auditorium.</LD>
<LD>   Talk about working up a sweat. As television's biggest stars
strolled into the Shrine, many were glad they weren't wrapped in
heat-magnet black while others who chose the color were happy their
outfits somehow compensated for being at the mercy of the mercury.</LD>
<LD>   "I am so thrilled to be wearing this dress. Look, it's got built
in air-conditioning," said singer and "American Idol" judge Paula
Abdul about her black jersey Nicole Bakti gown with triangular
cutouts. Her eyelids lined with gold glitter, Abdul said she mostly
wanted a gown that "was understated and classic--but with an edge.
And AC."</LD>
<TE>   She wasn't the only one. Many actresses, such as Angela Bassett,
chose gowns that were more about beautiful eye-popping prints, color
and comfort than heavy mega-wattage dazzle. Sequined sheaths were
practically no-shows as were overly made-up faces and outrageous
coifs. Instead, the look was simple elegance, maybe a lesson learned
from last year's Emmys when the marching orders were to dress
down--respectable instead of spectacle--in a post-Sept. 11 world.</TE>
<TE>   While the women bragged about finding their comfort zones in their
ensembles, the men, mostly dressed in black Giorgio Armani, Hugo Boss
and Gucci, could hardly wait to get inside the chilled auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really happy I'm not wearing black," said Mary-Louise Parker
in a long yellow flower print, spaghetti-strap Carolina Herrera gown
with a dangerously high left-side slit. "Mrs. Herrera had made a
dress for me before which is why I'm wearing her again. I had the
designer picked out before the dress. It's perfect for this weather."</TE>
<TE>   Penny Johnson Jerald of the show "24," selected her pink Badgley
Mischka gown guessing that "it would be a hot day" and struck a pose
in the unfussy but striking spaghetti-strap number. Also lighting up
the red carpet in color was Cloris Leachman in an orange-satin
Sevilla gown. "Hurray, it's sleeveless!" Leachman shouted happily.
"Otherwise I'd be sweating it out right now."</TE>
<TE>   An obviously pregnant Jane Kaczmarek in a black chantilly lace
Heidi Kaczenski creation, said she was holding up OK in the heat.
Standing by her side was husband Bradley Whitford in a Ralph Lauren
tuxedo.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby was another mother-to-be, Cynthia Nixon, who thanked her
designer, Chaiken, for dressing her in an airy red column gown with a
slight train. "Plus this gown matches my hair," she said about her
red spiky do. Lauren Ambrose, another red-head, selected a purple
Halston gown, knotted in the front "because I thought it looked good
with my hair."</TE>
<TE>   Kim Cattrall thought the skintight Herve Leger dress on her svelte
body just looked good. It did. "This is pretty subdued for Samantha,
don't you think?" said Cattrall about her "Sex and the City"
character. "But it's very me."</TE>

<LD>Behind the scenes: Host Conan O'Brien wanted a gag--in which he
welcomes the accountants who tabulate the Emmy ballots, then
introduces the FBI agents charged with taking them away for cooking
the books--to be a surprise to the vote counters. TV academy Chairman
Bryce Zabel suggested that the accountants needed to be let in on the
joke. When they were, they discussed it with their lawyers, who
weren't amused. Two days before the telecast, it still wasn't clear
whether O'Brien's sense of humor would rule. It did.</LD>

<HD>'Images From Within,' Deep in Thought</HD>
<DH>The American Repertory troupe combines vintage works and
new choreography to capture scenes in the mind's eye.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a day when the world is too much with you, what would your
thoughts look like if they were a dance? The American Repertory Dance
Company had a few answers Saturday night at Glendale's Alex Theatre
in vintage works and new choreography called collectively "Images
From Within."</LD>
<LD>   In the 1940s, it seems, you might have punched at demons and
collapsed like a house of cards, without thinking once that naked
emotions need more complexity. Today, you might add more nuance and
perhaps a lot of enigmatic gestures, but it seems no one can escape
the idea of embodied contrast, which was everywhere on this program.</LD>
<LD>   And whether a dance spoke obliquely or directly, the finely etched
talents of the performers put the past and the present within reach
with sheer concentration and skill. Watching eloquent Rachel Berman,
for instance, was a delight in the rarely seen Eleanor King solos
"Envy" and "Wrath," from the 1941 "Roads to Hell," even if she was
tied up in knots, jabbing the air, swinging at phantoms or pounding
the floor.</LD>
<TE>   The same movement qualities did not entirely come "from within"
but from an offstage lynching in Pearl Primus' 1943 solo "Strange
Fruit." Unseen, choreographer Donald McKayle combined passion and
clear tones while reading Lewis Allen's eponymous poem, while
Lorraine Fields struggled to fathom a "pastoral scene of the gallant
South."</TE>
<TE>   Primus' work stood in stark contrast to the opening solo,
"Incense," the Ruth St. Denis museum piece about walking and smoke.
At least that's what it seems to be about without any context--an odd
opener for this program. It might help an audience to know that St.
Denis' cool, faux Indian rituals were one reason a new generation
started pouring out emotions and dancing about more familiar subject
matter.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, all the arched angst of modern dance eventually led
choreographers to diversify enormously, but ARDC, while following its
relatively new mandate to include contemporary work, sticks with
strongly constructed pieces in the modernist vein. Among them
Saturday were two from 2000: Colin Connor's touching "Vestiges,"
stunningly danced by Connor and Debra Noble to dynamically rhapsodic
recorded music by Michael Nyman; and "The Visit," a self-consciously
brooding thing by Mark Denby in collaboration with ARDC artistic
director Bonnie Oda Homsey, performed by Homsey and Laurence Blake.</TE>
<TE>   "Of Grace and Courage" was the evening's four-part,
four-choreographer premiere, with a commissioned score by Allan
Terriciano, played at the piano by the composer (Terriciano also
played for "Incense"), alongside musicians Monica Nguyen, Michael
Wall and Gene Wie. Serving each dance well, the score seemed to
provide the only link between the short works. For Connor's trio,
"Falling Sky," piano notes seemed to weave among the dancers, who
wheeled around each other, stopping short from time to time, as if
frozen in sudden realizations.</TE>
<TE>   Rhythms drawn from world music supported Berman, looking florid
and fierce in Robert Battle's "Exiled," and Nancy Colahan, portraying
Frida Kahlo, as she found that small physical limitations inhibited
her attempts to soar in "Alas Pa' Volar" (Wings to Fly), by Andrea E.
Woods.</TE>
<TE>   McKayle's final segment, "Vow," featured Homsey, Connor, Noble and
Fields, perhaps releasing more energy in more sustained phrases than
earlier in the evening. Or, at least it seemed that way, as they
swung and swayed, noodled a bit, and then gathered in a tight circle
where closed fists exploded upward into small starbursts. Why not?
Modernists like closure, and everyone likes to think there's hope.</TE>

<HD>Politics Threaten to Upstage Films at Morocco's
International Festival</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>MARRAKECH, Morocco--Just about the last thing the world needs, one
might think, is yet another film festival. And, in truth, last year's
inaugural International Film Festival here got off to a faltering
start, scheduled as it was only days after Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Many visitors and delegates either canceled plans to visit or were
simply unable to arrange flights to Morocco. Yet the awful events of
that day have unexpectedly provided the Marrakech festival with a
reason to exist.</LD>
<LD>   The implications of Sept. 11 were the main talking point at the
second festival, which ended Sunday night. The troubling events of
the last year have allowed Marrakech to position itself as a
different kind of gathering, one that offers a clear alternative
worldview to established European festivals like Cannes, Berlin and
Venice, all of which keep at least one eye firmly fixed on Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   As one might expect of a festival in an Arabic-speaking country
with a huge Muslim population, Marrakech wants to assert the value of
films and filmmakers from non-Western countries. One press conference
after another last week was marked by hand-wringing, mostly from
European and American liberals, about the negative portrayal of Arab
characters in Western films.</TE>
<TE>   Marrakech jury member Anna Thomson, an American actress who often
works in France and is best known for her roles in "The Crow" and
"Unforgiven," set the tone by declaring, "I'm embarrassed to be
American." She added that she believes Americans were "the victims of
bizarre propaganda" in their media, which took the form of "ghastly
lies about Arab people that are just not true." Her comments were
widely applauded.</TE>
<TE>   Another jury member, Moroccan poet and philosopher Abdellatif
Laabi, said he believes the festival has huge significance.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not [a film festival] in Marrakech, or Tehran or any other
city of that sort?" he asked. "It's the end of a logic that says
there should be only one cultural value for one time and place."
Non-Western nations, he added, must be regarded not only as potential
consumer markets but also countries that can create. "This festival,"
said Laabi, "is about the end of preconceptions."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush was not popular among those who attended the
festival, and he came under attack repeatedly during a six-hour
symposium dominated largely by French intellectuals titled "The Power
and Responsibility of Film." For long passages, this symposium seemed
merely an excuse to castigate U.S. foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   Francis Ford Coppola, who received an award from the festival's
foundation, was in a somber mood; at a press conference, he launched
into a long history of the differences between Israelis and
Palestinians. He also bemoaned the tendency in the West to stereotype
Arab characters.</TE>
<TE>   "For years, movies needed bad guys," Coppola said. "International
distributors need films with action and conflict. You could make
beautiful films about [Arab life and culture], but I don't know any
[American filmmaker] who knows anything about it."</TE>
<TE>   Another American director, David Lynch, who was in Marrakech to
receive an award for his work from French actress Catherine Deneuve,
took a different tack. Asked what he thought of his country's
post-Sept. 11 behavior, Lynch replied, "This is a film festival. It
might be better to focus on film." And that sentiment, too, received
applause.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it hasn't been all solemnity in this vibrant and sometimes
chaotic Moroccan city, in which almost every building is painted
ochre or salmon pink. No film festival is immune to the charisma of
visiting celebrities; apart from Coppola, Deneuve and Lynch, the
presence of the formidable veteran French actress Jeanne Moreau, here
as president of the jury, caused a buzz. Matt Dillon arrived to show
his first film as a director, "City of Ghosts," which is set in
Cambodia. Reactions were mixed.</TE>
<TE>   More excitement surrounded the appearance of veteran French pop
star Johnny Hallyday (Morocco, until 1956 a French colony, remains
largely Francophone). Hallyday made a surprisingly strong debut as a
taciturn bank robber in Patrice Lecomte's affecting French film
"L'Homme du Train."</TE>
<TE>   Marrakech has another trump card: one of the world's most
spectacular outdoor locations in which to show a film. This is a
large space among the ruins of the 16th century sandstone El Badi
Palace, just inside the walls of the Medina, or old city.</TE>
<TE>   Bleachers were built in front of a huge screen, and watching films
there on a balmy night under a full moon in a cloudless sky, with the
old palace ramparts dramatically illuminated, was an unforgettable
experience.</TE>
<TE>   The festival did suffer setbacks. Martin Scorsese had been
expected in Marrakech to receive an honor from Morocco's king,
Mohammed VI. The king, patron of the festival and considered a movie
buff, refuses to watch dubbed films; he insists on subtitled
versions, according to courtiers.</TE>
<TE>   Scorsese withdrew at the last minute, citing the need to finish
editing his long-awaited epic, "The Gangs of New York." It looked
like a snub, but one of the festival's organizers, French film
industry leader Daniel Toscan du Plantier, expressed disappointment
on the king's behalf but stopped short of showing anger. "We are
frustrated, but we understand," he said. Scorsese's "problems are in
America, not with us."</TE>
<TE>   More controversy attended the nonappearance of Spain's leading
director, Pedro Almodovar, who was also expected in Marrakech. His
absence was initially connected to the frosty political relations
between Spain and Morocco; these came to a head in July, with the
temporary invasion by a handful of Moroccan troops of a tiny
Mediterranean island, Perejil, which belongs to Spain.</TE>
<TE>   But though Almodovar and his producer brother Agustin denied that
politics had anything to do with their decision to stay in Madrid,
the reasons they offered were even more stinging: They cited the
absurdity of staying in expensive hotels to attend a film festival in
a poverty-stricken country like Morocco that has no real film
culture.</TE>
<TE>   The Almodovars have a point. One need only stroll around the
Medina to see hardship, and the hotels housing visitors to the
Marrakech festival (including the press) are luxurious by any
measure. On Thursday the king hosted a long seven-course dinner in
the enormous courtyard of his royal palace for some 1,200 people to
celebrate the festival; although the event was a spectacular piece of
theater, the dauntingly huge portions of food inevitably turned one's
mind to thoughts of cruel inequity.</TE>
<TE>   The Marrakech festival is peculiar in another sense. Despite its
pretensions to being an alternative to European festivals and in an
uneasy echo of Morocco's colonial past, from an operational
standpoint, it is a truly French-run affair, from the administrators
who organized it to the French business community that has sponsored
and financed it. One wag, surveying the list of visitors and
delegates, described it as "the French film industry on vacation in
the sun."</TE>
<TE>   It is true that most Moroccans do not go to the movies. In a
country where the average annual income is $3,500, there are higher
priorities than a $2 cinema ticket. Multichannel television is a more
affordable option for most people. According to Souheil Ben Barka,
director-general of Morocco's film industry, there are just 150
cinema screens in the country.</TE>
<TE>   But film can be helpful to Morocco and, ironically, that help is
coming from Hollywood. Big-budget epics are in vogue since the
success of "Gladiator," and Morocco, with its dramatic mountains and
wide-open spaces, is an ideal place to film them.</TE>
<TE>   It is also cheap; horses and soldiers, provided with the king's
encouragement, come at a fraction of prices charged in other
countries. Moroccan extras will work for wages that would seem
absurdly low in Western countries. Ben Barka noted that Scorsese had
shot many exterior scenes of his 1997 Tibetan epic "Kundun" in
Morocco. "It cost $17 million, but had he gone elsewhere, like Italy,
the budget would have been $37 million."</TE>
<TE>   A huge studio complex stands outside the Moroccan city of
Ouarzazate, and Fox is building a second; next year two
Hollywood-backed epics will be shot there. One is Baz Luhrmann's
biopic, "Alexander the Great," starring Leonardo DiCaprio, which is
expected to cost $150 million, of which 40% will be spent in Morocco.
Ridley Scott's new film "Tripoli," starring Russell Crowe, is also
set for a start early next year.</TE>
<TE>   "We can handle three big epics a year," boasts Ben Barka. "Film
can be a huge source of revenue here, just like tourism. It is cheap
here, and the light is beautiful. In the south of the country, it is
sunny for 300 days a year." Of course, Hollywood became the world's
film capital because of exactly that same climatic consistency.</TE>
<TE>   Morocco may have its problems, but these initiatives to make the
country synonymous with film may yet pay off.</TE>

<HD>A Human Twist on Circus as Spectacle</HD>
<DH>Cirque Eloize strips away the elaborate costumes, masks and
staging of that other cirque to create a more intimate experience for
the audience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Montreal's Cirque du Soleil, founded in 1984, has developed into a
hydra-headed monster that eats nothing but talented young acrobats.
With permanent shows in Las Vegas and Disney World, five Cirque
productions touring the globe and even its own Imax movie, it would
seem that Cirque du Soleil has cornered the market on surreal fantasy
played out on ropes, trapezes and high wires--and probably exhausted
the world supply of lithe bodies able to perform such fantastical
feats.</LD>
<LD>   So there is a tendency to walk into a performance by Montreal's
9-year-old Cirque Eloize thinking: "Yeah, OK, Cirque du whatever."
You expect it to be delicious but probably the same French-Canadian
meal you've already enjoyed at one of Cirque du Soleil's numerous
incarnations.</LD>
<LD>   But even with their undeniable similarities in tone, title and
nationality, Cirque Eloize--which presented the United States
premiere of its newest creation, "Nomade," at UCLA's Royce Hall on
Friday--is a different sort of Cirque than, well, Cirque. The
intimate, low-tech charm of Cirque Eloize--so named for the flashes
of heat-lightning common to the company's native Magdalen Islands off
the coast of Quebec--and the glossy, ready-for-Vegas Cirque du Soleil
are as unlike as sunshine and storm.</LD>
<TE>   Through elaborate costumes and masks, Cirque du Soleil productions
create an alien world of dazzling life forms from new planets
invented for the occasion. Some Cirque shows even invent their own
mysterious languages. "Nomade," which closed Sunday, is very much
about humans--very peculiar humans, but humans all the same.</TE>
<TE>   "Nomade" is performed on a proscenium stage, rather than under a
circus tent, with minimal costumes and a live band of minstrels on
hand to play composer Lucie Cauchon's accordion-laced music--part
French cabaret, part klezmer, part New Orleans funeral jazz. The
show, directed by Finzi Pasca, loosely follows the story of two gypsy
bands of circus performers as they make their way to a wedding.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, they converse with one another, argue with one
another and challenge one another through feats of juggling, dancing,
singing, tumbling, ax-throwing, levitation, trapeze-riding, balancing
and contortion (tall, dark-haired Genevieve Gauthier most assuredly
wins the prize in this category).</TE>
<TE>   The multi-talented cast members move easily through the various
forms of acrobatics. Humor--mostly the responsibility of the two
clowns, Bartlomiej Soroczynski and Nicholas Leresche--is amiably
slapstick and corny, with both of these agile performers able to jump
into the acrobatic sequences without missing a step.</TE>
<TE>   The troupe offers fine solo performances--standouts are Stefan
Wepfer in an elegant balletic routine on the Chinese pole and chatty
Suzanne Soler offering a breathless monologue about awaiting her
dream suitor while swinging on her trapeze.</TE>
<TE>   But it is as an ensemble that the troupe shines brightest. The
cast of 20-odd artists becomes one as it juggles dozens of flying
pins, forms intricate sculptures in a remarkable hand-to-hand
balancing act or collectively holds its breath as petite Ewelina
Fijolek climbs up to execute a handstand on a precariously tall stack
of chairs. By the end, you feel like you know them all. People like
you--just a little more flexible.</TE>

<LD>The heat hung heavy over the 54th annual Emmy Awards. Roses wilted on
the red carpet, celebrities wilted on the red carpet--everything from
limos to security officers overheated as television executives,
actors and the industry's creative elite made their way into the
Shrine Auditorium on a day when temperatures soared into the 90s.</LD>
<LD>   Fans in the bleachers, many of them dressed in shorts and tank
tops, came prepared. Others dealt with the heat by peeling away
clothes, unbuttoning shirts, even removing socks and shoes. "Hey,
throw some water up here," shouted a fan as others joined in
chanting, "Water! Water! Water!"</LD>
<LD>   "It was 104 degrees in the Valley," said "Access Hollywood" anchor
Tony Potts, who spent the morning in the Valley with Michael Chiklis,
who won an Emmy for best actor for his work in FX's drama series "The
Shield." "I came here to what seemed like 130 degrees on the carpet,"
he added.</LD>
<TE>   Dozens of roses in tall pots along the walkway wilted, petals that
were once pointing upright were now headed south. Usually at the end
of the red carpet parade, the paparazzi and media help themselves to
the flowers, but not this time. Many actresses were carrying tissues
to dab at melting makeup and perspiration. The men in head-to-toe
tuxedo wear began removing their coats, unbuttoning the tops of
shirts and loosening bow ties.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sweating in places I never knew I could," said Simon Baker
from "The Guardian" in a Gucci suit and silver tie. Wendie Malick
from "Just Shoot Me" professed to be cool in her champagne-colored
cocktail dress inspired by Audrey Hepburn. "I'm so glad not to be
sweating in a long black gown. It's just too, too hot for something
like that today," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The heat also took its toll on at least one limousine--the one
carrying actress Jennifer Garner from "Alias" and her date, Scott
Foley. The couple arrived an hour late after their limo overheated on
the 101 Freeway, and another had to be dispatched. As the show began
taping, the couple--the last to arrive--quickly worked their way down
the red carpet before rushing into the Shrine.</TE>
<TE>   Denise Crew, who spent the afternoon on the red carpet snapping
celebrity shots from Nokia's new cell phone that allows you to take
pictures, said, "It's not very becoming for a lady to say, but beads
of sweat were bubbling over my skin and makeup. Usually everybody's
complaining about their feet, now everyone's complaining about the
heat."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the heat seemed to eclipse even the stars as the main
topic of conversation. When asked about how things were going, one
academy publicist just groaned: "The heat's a nightmare. A nightmare
... everybody's roasting.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to bring in water by the bucket loads. Tons and tons of
water bottles, especially for the police and security here," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 550 security personnel, Los Angeles Police Department
officers and other law enforcement officials were at the Shrine,
keeping a sharp eye on those maneuvering through long traffic lines
and metal detectors to get into the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Moses, the gala's head of security, said the heavy level of
security was mainly precautionary, and that there had been no
threats.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Louise Roug and Michael Quintanilla
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Duo Uses Coltrane Tribute to Enter Improvisational Space</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Coltrane created "Interstellar Space" in 1967, six months before
his death at age 40. The recorded duet performance with drummer
Rashied Ali is a remarkable musical document, the chronicle of one of
the final creative journeys of an improviser who spent virtually his
entire life in search of ultimate expressiveness. And the title
accurately reflects the real nature of that inner quest.</LD>
<LD>   As an extraordinary expression of personal spirituality,
Coltrane's "Interstellar Space" would have made an understandable
inclusion in the World Festival of Sacred Music. Somewhat more
problematic was the presentation of "Interstellar Space Revisited"--a
reexamination of the Coltrane work performed by guitarist Nels Cline
and drummer Gregg Bendian on Friday and Saturday nights at the
Schindler House in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   When Cline introduced the program on Friday, he was quick to
insist that the duo's effort was intended as a respectful tribute to
Coltrane. One can hardly argue with that sentiment, and it's
important to note that Cline and Bendian had already recorded their
own version of this historic work three years ago in a critically
praised CD.</LD>
<TE>   But a question remained. Although "Interstellar Space" was a
remarkable musical statement, it was hardly a substantial composition
as such--and certainly not one affording resources for new
interpretative versions. Its individual segments, named after planets
("Mars," "Venus," "Jupiter" and "Saturn" in the original LP version,
with "Leo" and "Jupiter Variation" added for the CD release), come
across as spontaneous improvisations rather than scored works. Most
are based upon minimal thematic material, with the real essence of
the work tracing to the brilliantly creative soloing of Coltrane,
seamlessly surrounded by Ali's galvanized drumming.</TE>
<TE>   So what are two other players, from different backgrounds, with
differing goals, at another time and place, to make of such an
intensely personal, inherently impromptu musical expression? For
Cline and Bendian, the answer was to use the minimal elements of
"Interstellar Space" as the springboard for their own flights of
improvisational fancy.</TE>
<TE>   From a musical point of view, that decision--although it had
little to do with Coltrane's inner journey--offered plenty of purely
musical wiggle room.</TE>
<TE>   Cline's free-flying solos used his electric guitar as an
all-purpose sound-generating device. Stroking it with various
implements, tossing in feedback sounds and using his impressive
technique to generate torrents of notes, his reference point seemed
to have more with Jimi Hendrix than Coltrane (not surprising,
perhaps, given the impact that Coltrane clearly had upon the rock
guitarist). Bendian's contributions were less torrential, especially
in comparison to Ali's original performance, but more intriguing in
the smaller moments in which he reached into the subtle,
texture-producing qualities of his drum kit.</TE>

<HD>After 75 Years, 'Father of TV' Gets His Due</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even Hollywood's brightest scribes couldn't have conceived a story
more amazing and inspiring than Philo T. Farnsworth's. A deeply
religious farm boy, he arrives at the idea for transmitting sound and
pictures--in other words, television--at 14 while tilling a field in
Idaho. Then at age 21, he transmits the first image on a picture tube
in his little laboratory in San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   It's a story of the underdog who made good, the little guy who
took on big business and proved in 1935 that it was he and not David
Sarnoff and RCA who was the real "Father of Television." And it's
also an epic love story.</LD>
<LD>   And finally, on the 75th anniversary of his remarkable discovery,
the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences celebrated Farnsworth's
legacy Sunday night during the 54th annual Emmy Awards. The
recognition is long overdue considering that there may not have been
an Emmy Award without Farnsworth's invention.</LD>
<TE>   Farnsworth died in 1971, but his 94-year-old widow and
collaborator, Elma "Pem" Farnsworth, has been keeping his legacy
alive and well. She flew to Los Angeles on Saturday--with her nurse,
Kathy Stump--from her home in Fort Wayne, Ind., to attend Sunday's
festivities.</TE>
<TE>   Pem Farnsworth, who penned the memoir "Distant Vision: Romance and
Discovery on an Invisible Frontier" 20 years ago, joked that she
won't be wearing anything low-cut to the Emmy Awards, just a
black-lace blouse and skirt. The mother of four, grandmother of eight
and great-grandmother of nine, was set to attend the Emmys with her
longtime friend Georja Skinner, who is also her manager and
publicist.</TE>
<TE>   During her visit to Los Angeles, Pem Farnsworth also planned to
visit the site of the couple's original "lab"--actually their
apartment--in Los Angeles, accompanied by television historian Paul
Schatzin. His biography of Farnsworth, "The Boy That Invented
Television," was published on Sept. 7--the 75th anniversary of the
first television transmission.</TE>
<TE>   Skinner said that she and her family have been trying to get more
recognition for Philo Farnsworth for the last two decades. "I have
been in touch with the family off and on for a long time, and it
really seemed things were heating up around the 75th anniversary."
Through the help of her friend, former Directors Guild of America
President Jack Shea, Skinner contacted the television academy this
year and convinced them that a Farnsworth tribute was long overdue.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, Pem Farnsworth is excited about the tribute. She says
it is God's will that she attend.</TE>
<TE>   "I belong to a religion commonly known as Mormon, and [we] are
taught when we are prompted to do something, we don't ask why. We
just do it. I got prompted and I am going."</TE>
<TE>   In 1926, she says, her husband told his backers that if they would
give him $25,000 he would have a picture transmission in one year.
"Anyone who has any technical experience or read about it knows that
was a foolish thing to say, but he used to say to me, 'We are on a
guided tour [in life],' so he didn't question it, he just did it."</TE>
<TE>   Other inventors were also working on television models, but they
were attempting a "mechanical spinning disc-type thing," Farnsworth
says. "But he had just learned what made electricity, and he was
fascinated by the electron. That was the only thing fast enough to
use in television."</TE>
<TE>   The first picture tube was about the size of a postage stamp. "It
was only one dimension because, well, he had promised a picture in a
year and he hadn't promised anything more than a picture," Farnsworth
says. "He realized that he was up against a lot of money by other
people who were working on television. He just had to go by the
inspiration because otherwise he was not going to be able to do
this."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to several biographies on Farnsworth, the inventor and
Pem play an important part in the acclaimed 2001 historical novel
"Carter Beats the Devil," by Glen David Gold.</TE>
<TE>   Skinner says several Hollywood producers are interested in
Farnsworth's story. "Pem wants one feature film about this story,"
Skinner says. "That would be her dream. She has been waiting a really
long time."</TE>

<LD>Garth Brooks reinvented the model of the male country singer,
concocting a formula since adopted by Tim McGraw, Kenny Chesney and
others that's equal parts rock star and aerobics instructor.</LD>
<LD>   As if to prove that Aesop's fable about the hare and the tortoise
applies to country music as much as any other part of life, along
ambles George Strait to remind us that there's still room for a guy
who just stands there and sings.</LD>
<LD>   Where Garth and his disciples race, bound and swing about the
stage like so many Tennessee Tarzans, Strait exhibited his Zen-like
dedication to the fine art of moseying throughout his 95-minute set
Saturday at the Forum in Inglewood.</LD>
<TE>   He was outfitted as usual in a starched white shirt and denim
jeans that looked straight out of the box. But even after singing
more than two dozen songs spanning his two-decade-plus career, Strait
could have put that wardrobe straight back into the box and sent it
back to the store and nobody'd be the wiser.</TE>
<TE>   That this Texan of few words can get through an entire concert
without breaking a sweat testifies to the faith he puts in the songs
he chooses, and he's proved adept over the years at selecting
material that's consistently catchy, occasionally moving.</TE>
<TE>   The set list Saturday included several from his latest album, "The
Road Less Traveled," among them songs from such esteemed writers as
Rodney Crowell and Merle Haggard. He's not a singer like Emmylou
Harris who consistently bowls you over with the musical gems he
unearths or with his interpretative prowess. Yet Strait injects even
his more conventional material, which never insults the listener's
intelligence, with a no-frills honesty that has kept him as one of
the few pre-Garth-era stars who still has any kind of a presence in
mainstream country.</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts-reared singer Jo Dee Messina got a generous opening
slot of nearly an hour, a chunk of which she wasted demonstrating her
love for the '70s and '80s arena rock she grew up with. But when she
sang her own hits, she showed off her appealingly soulful, steely
voice in the Tammy Wynette tradition.</TE>

<HD>Folklorico de Mexico Marks 50th Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not for nothing has the venerable institution Ballet Folklorico de
Mexico de Amalia Hernandez been going strong for 50 years. With
unbridled artistry, rampant enthusiasm and a high-kicking technique,
this troupe has raised the bar for folklorico around the globe. To
commemorate its golden anniversary, the 75-member company, under the
artistic direction of Norma Lopez (daughter of the late Hernandez),
landed at the Universal Amphi- theatre on Saturday as part of a
22-city United States tour.</LD>
<LD>   Overflowing with a psychedelic-like cornucopia of costumes--from
hot-pink stockings paired with chartreuse leggings to virginal white
lace gowns and your garden-variety silver-studded toreador
pants--Folklorico's nine-part "greatest hits" program also delivered
virtuosic brio with its scorching mariachi band, albeit an overamped
one.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, none of these accouterments would mean much without
exceptional choreography, which Folklorico has in spades.
Jump-starting the evening was "Los Matachines," a thundering
stomp-fest a la "Riverdance" intended for Christian gods. Regional
suites from Michoacan and Tixtla followed, the former characterized
by buoyant hopping and skipping turns, the latter featuring
shoulder-shimmying women and agile, tongue-darting iguanas.</LD>
<TE>   "Revolution" saw 14 rifle-brandishing gals (think Annie Oakley)
execute sharp turns in multitiered dresses, with the same suite
showcasing the tireless twirling of lariat ace Lorenzo Escamilla.
Another crowd-pleaser: "Festival in Tlacotalpan," in which giant
puppets--"Mojigangas"--moved to Caribbean rhythms and fandango
dancers pounded out lively beats on special platform boxes in a work
celebrating the Virgin of Candelaria.</TE>
<TE>   No Folklorico concert would be complete without the Yaqui deer
dance, here given feral life by Jorge Torres Chavez, and a
confetti-strewn "Jalisco," the jubilant finale that includes the
traditional Mexican Hat Dance. With its fervent kineticism, the
company offers a kind of MTV folklorico that had the crowd
continually hooting in appreciation.</TE>

<LD>"Diamond Men" is proving to be no diamond in the rough.</LD>
<LD>   The small, indie film starring Robert Forster as a salesman who
must mentor a young replacement when his company downsizes was
originally released last September on the East Coast. Who would have
dreamed that one year later it would still be humming along in
limited release in city after city, building strong word of mouth
wherever it screens with virtually no advertising?</LD>
<LD>   "It's like a little snowball," said writer-director-producer
Daniel M Cohen. "It's truly amazing."</LD>
<TE>   "Diamond Men" had the misfortune of opening in Washington, D.C.,
just before Sept. 11. Since then, however, the film has hopscotched
the country, taking in about $750,000 in limited release, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have generally raved over the drama. Roger Ebert gave it 3
1/2 stars in the Chicago Sun-Times and called it "a treasure." The
San Francisco Examiner said it was a "little gem" with an O.
Henry-style ending. And The Times' Kenneth Turan praised Forster's
"excellent performance."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen said the film screened in the Los Angeles area late last
year for Academy Award consideration--notably Forster's
performance--but because major studios were pushing their own
Oscar-worthy pictures, "we were effectively frozen out of the Los
Angeles market."</TE>
<TE>   Now, the film is back in L.A. Panorama Entertainment is scheduled
to release "Diamond Men" Friday at the Pacific ArcLight in Hollywood,
the Pacific Galleria in Sherman Oaks and the Pacific Paseo in
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   "We never in a million years thought we would be here a year later
with a movie we can't get out of theaters," Cohen said.</TE>

<HD>For Moviegoers, 'Barbershop' Still a Cut Above</HD>
<DH>Box office* 'The Banger Sisters,' another specialty film,
is No. 2. 'The Four Feathers' fails to attract its hoped-for young
market, putting it in fourth place.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This weekend's specialty films proved stronger at the box office than
big-budget epics, with MGM's "Barbershop" once again coming in at No.
1, followed by Fox Searchlight's "The Banger Sisters."</LD>
<LD>   "Barbershop," which stars Ice Cube and was marketed mainly to an
African American audience, grossed an estimated $13.3 million,
dropping a respectable 36% in its second weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The movie, which cost from $10 million to $12 million to make and
about as much to market, has grossed $38.9 million so far. (Studios
usually receive roughly half of what a movie earns at the box office;
theater operators keep the other half.)</LD>
<TE>   Like "Barbershop," "The Banger Sisters" also played to a
specialized audience--mainly women over age 25, said Steve Gilula,
head of distribution for Fox Searchlight. The film, which also cost
about $10 million to make and about $12 million to market, stars
Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn as friends who reunite to reminisce
about their days as rock groupies.</TE>
<TE>   It was extremely difficult to find a home for the film because no
studio wanted to make a movie about two middle-aged women, according
to the producer, Mark Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Once it was made, Fox Searchlight began test-screening it and
found that audiences' response was extremely positive. Based on those
results, the studio gambled on a wide release--2,737 screens
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a good season for Fox Searchlight, the specialty arm
of 20th Century Fox. In addition to "The Banger Sisters," the studio
has done well with such films as "One Hour Photo," a creepy thriller
starring Robin Williams that came in this weekend at No. 5 with an
estimated $4.7 million (and $21.8 million through its fifth weekend),
and "The Good Girl," a drama starring Jennifer Aniston, which did not
make it into the top 10 but has grossed $12.8 million through its
seventh weekend and has brought Aniston critical kudos.</TE>
<TE>   Still going strong at No. 3 was the summer's biggest independent
hit, "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," which grossed $10 million over the
weekend for a total of $124.3 million since its opening in May.</TE>
<TE>   Paramount's costly epic "The Four Feathers" came in fourth,
grossing only $7.1 million in its first weekend. The film, which cost
from $40 million to $60 million to make, was not well-reviewed--in
contrast to director Shekhar Kapur's last film, "Elizabeth," which
garnered star Cate Blanchett an Oscar nomination. It also failed to
bring in the hordes of younger moviegoers who might have been drawn
to a historical picture only because of its stars, Heath Ledger, Wes
Bentley and Kate Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros.' spy/action film "Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,"
starring Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu, tied with "Four Feathers" at
No. 4, also grossing $7.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Buena Vista's "Signs" and Sony's "Stealing Harvard" tied at No. 6,
each grossing an estimated $3.5 million. "Signs," which has been in
release since August, has brought in a total of $217.9 million,
compared with $10.8 million for "Stealing Harvard," which has been
out for two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Teen thriller "Swimfan" dropped to seventh, grossing $3.45 million
in its third week, for a total of $24.4 million. Sony's "Trapped," a
kidnapping thriller the studio released with a subdued ad campaign
and no other publicity, debuted at No. 8 with $3.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The weekend's third pair of tied films, for ninth place, were
Sony's "XXX" and Warner Bros.' "City by the Sea" with an estimated $2
million apiece. "XXX" has grossed $138.3 million to date. "City by
the Sea" has taken in $20.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Box office tracking firm Nielsen EDI reported that business was
down about 7% from last weekend but was 32% ahead of last year, when
the nation was still reeling from the Sept. 11 attacks and no major
movies debuted.</TE>

<HD>... And Then They Partied</HD>
<DH>After the ceremony, it was jazz bands, chandeliers dripping

<DL></DL>
<LD>After Sunday's 54th annual Emmy Awards, hundreds of guests filed into
an enormous two-story ballroom next to the Shrine Auditorium for the
Governors Ball, hosted by the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences.</LD>
<LD>   A jazz band played television show theme songs from a balcony as
the crowd moved through the palatial room decorated in navy and
silver. Scores of tables were set with lobster salads. Giant
glittering silver chandeliers hung from the ceiling to the tabletops.</LD>
<LD>   At the table for the cast of HBO's Emmy-nominated "Curb Your
Enthusiasm," which lost to NBC's "Friends," the mood was quiet; one
of the stars was overhead saying, "I didn't want to go up there
anyway."</LD>
<TE>   Ellen DeGeneres, who hosted the Emmys last year, made her way
through the crowd, chatting with friends and fans along the way. One
man shouted out to her, "Will you have my children?" Her response: "I
have to think about that."</TE>
<TE>   At a table near the entrance, the very pregnant Cynthia Nixon from
HBO's "Sex and the City" stopped to nibble on salad before cutting
out for another party. Camera crews made their way through the tables
looking for stars, but at 9 p.m. most of the A-listers were still
doing interviews. The Osbourne teens were spotted and Oprah Winfrey
was reportedly somewhere inside the party.</TE>
<TE>   While some made the Governors Ball their destination, others--in
lines of limos and chauffeured cars--made their way to the half-dozen
celebrations across town.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the award show was rescheduled twice in response to
Sept. 11, and most networks decided to forgo throwing the usual
parties. Award winners and nominees instead attended a subdued
celebration at the Century Plaza Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   This year, however, the network parties, like black tie and slinky
dresses, were back.</TE>
<TE>   It was an art nouveau dream at the HBO party at Spago in Beverly
Hills, where early guests watched the East Coast feed of the awards
show. Inside a massive tent set up behind the restaurant, 200 waiters
were ready to serve drinks in gold-rimmed glasses to the 1,400
expected guests.</TE>
<TE>   Party planner Billy Butchkavitz spent six months organizing the
event--his interpretation of Park Guell, the spectacularly tiled park
in Barcelona, Spain, designed and built in the early 20th century by
Spanish architect Antonio Gaudi.</TE>
<TE>   The tent was awash in roses and fountains and gold velvet. Tables
were decorated with sheer embroidered fabrics from India. Guests sat
on serpentine couches covered in gold ultra-suede. Guests stepped
onto a yellow carpet instead of the traditional red one.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Spielberg and Larry King were among the first to arrive
after the show. "Spago's got great food, probably the best place for
a party," King said in what could have been a plug for Wolfgang Puck.
The talk show host added conspiratorially, "I live five minutes away.
It's been a long day."</TE>
<TE>   Twentieth Century Fox Television, which last year did not throw a
party, this year took over Morton's restaurant in West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   About 50 valets lined Robertson Boulevard, ready to take cars from
arriving stars, who then made their way on the red carpet past
reporters; inside, executives and stars lounged on suede couches
around the mirrored bar. Snacks and appetizers--strips of sirloin on
mashed potatoes served in martini glasses--were handed out by
waiters.</TE>
<TE>   "Entertainment Tonight" and the "Frasier" crew commandeered the
Mondrian Hotel in West Hollywood. At "E.T.'s" party, sponsored by
Glamour magazine, a 360-degree camera projected shots of guests onto
giant screens around the hotel's SkyBar.</TE>

<HD>Musical 'Buffy' Finally Lands in Stores</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" fans will have double reason to celebrate
Tuesday. The series not only launches its seventh season at 8 p.m. on
UPN, the soundtrack from last year's Emmy-nominated musical episode
"Once More, With Feeling" finally arrives in record stores.</LD>
<LD>   The album includes all the songs from the episode, in which all
residents of the fictional town of Sunnydale find themselves under a
spell that causes them to frequently break out in song.</LD>
<LD>   Series creator Joss Whedon, who composed the music and lyrics,
says he'd long harbored the fantasy of telling a story almost
entirely in song. Star Sarah Michelle Gellar and her co-stars did all
their own singing. Whedon, series regular Amber Benson and others
from the show will be at Tower Records in West Hollywood on Saturday
for a record release party.</LD>
<TE>   It took nearly a year, however, for Whedon to work out the release
of the soundtrack for the episode, which first aired last October and
received an Emmy nomination for best musical direction.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a huge bunch of actors and a bunch of companies,
you run into all sorts of legal foofaraw," Whedon says. "But everyone
came through eventually, and the album is coming out, although it's a
little bit later than the [episode's] premiere."</TE>
<TE>   The 38-year-old creator of "Buffy," its spinoff, "Angel," and the
new "Firefly" is a lifelong musical-theater junkie who took part in
high school productions of such musicals as "West Side Story" and
"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying," and said he
"listened to 'Hair' all the time when I was a tiny baby."</TE>
<TE>   In the album's liner notes, which Whedon also wrote, he calls the
"Once More, With Feeling" episode and album "the hardest and most
rewarding work I've ever done."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a big fan of the show," says John Virant, president and chief
executive of Rounder Records, which is handling the soundtrack's
release in North America. "I remember watching the episode when it
aired last October, and after it was over, I said to my wife, 'That's
the best hour of TV I've ever seen. Someone should put that
[soundtrack] out.' I inquired at Fox, just following up, and they
said, 'Well, we tried, it didn't happen. If you want to take a run at
it, feel free.' "</TE>
<TE>   Rounder is initially shipping 100,000 copies. How it will fare at
retail "is a tough call," says Wherehouse senior rock buyer Bob Bell,
especially in a week that brings new albums by Beck, Peter Gabriel
and the Elvis Presley compilation "30 No. 1 Hits."</TE>
<TE>   "The show's hard-core fans are going to buy it no matter what,"
Bell says. "That dedication is going to guarantee a certain level of
support. The good thing about it is that the music was really
involved in the show, as opposed to lot of TV soundtracks where the
music is not that prominent, or maybe was heard briefly in the
background."</TE>
<TE>   Whedon says he'll be paying attention to the album's sales
figures, but they won't make or break his day.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be lovely if hundreds and thousands of people buy it,"
he says. "But my expectations are pretty simple. I'm just glad that
people now have access to it. It if happens to sell lots and lots ...
well, nothing would surprise me at this point."</TE>

<LD>The cleaning crew, security guards and parking lot attendants were
overwhelming favorites to win this honor at The Times. So I can't
tell you how blown away I was to learn that of all those nominated to
write this review of the Jiminy Glick of TV awards shows--otherwise
known as the 54th annual Emmys on NBC--this paper chose...</LD>
<LD>   Moi? Get out! Words fail me.</LD>
<LD>   However, I want to thank:</LD>
<TE>   * Tux-wearing Larry David, creator and star of HBO's grand,
Emmy-nominated "Curb Your Enthusiasm," for setting the proper tone by
arriving at the Shrine Auditorium with his tie at a tilt, epitomizing
the "social-anxiety disorder" he applies to the Larry David he plays
in his series.</TE>
<TE>   * Executive producer Gary Smith for a smoothly executed, crisply
paced, well-conceived telecast, the exceptions being those forays
into windblown oratory. That included little vignettes with stars and
producers of comedy nominees praising (surprise!) their own shows.</TE>
<TE>   That goes especially for the florid buildup for Oprah Winfrey, who
received the first Bob Hope Humanitarian Award. It began with the
industry's Ari Fleischer--Bryce Zabel, chairman of the Academy of
Television Arts &amp; Sciences--throwing it to Tom Hanks, who cut loose
with his own flowery tribute ("She teaches us with her intellect ...
") before introducing a slew of gaseous testimonials from such
industry heavies as Tom Cruise ("You inspire me ... "). Then Oprah
herself beamed down from the clouds.</TE>
<TE>   Look, maybe she deserved it. She runs a nice show. But what's
wrong with Ricki Lake?</TE>
<TE>   * Conan O'Brien, under-sung for his work on NBC's "Late Night With
Conan O'Brian," for his easy, effortless wit in his new role as Emmys
host, with an enormous assist from those who wrote one of the
funniest opening monologues in Emmys history. It had him following
NBC's orders to develop a "love interest" during the telecast. The
initial object of his lust was Jennifer Aniston of NBC's "Friends."
Then he got the hots for Garry Shandling.</TE>
<TE>   Here's an order: Invite O'Brien back. And the writers too.</TE>
<TE>   * The few Emmy voters who agreed with me, especially those giving
the miniseries Emmy to HBO's extraordinary World War II tome, "Band
of Brothers." Then came a moving acceptance by real-life protagonist
Richard Winters, with other surviving members of the Easy Company he
commanded looking on from a Los Angeles hotel.</TE>
<TE>   * Larry Wilmore, creator of Fox's "The Bernie Mac Show," whose
comedy Emmy affirms that a fairly stock premise--kids upsetting the
routine of surrogate parents, a la the insipid new remake of "Family
Affair"--can soar when executed with originality.</TE>
<TE>   * Winners who delivered terse acceptances. Take Stockard Channing
(I'll take her anytime), who in receiving one of two Emmys managed to
say something meaningful about humanity in a few short sentences.</TE>
<TE>   * Moments of irony typified by "24" justifiably earning a writing
Emmy for its pilot, even though writing ultimately became its biggest
flaw as it progressed through its first season on Fox.</TE>
<TE>   And irony, too, in NBC's promos for some of its worst new series
invading a telecast meant to celebrate TV's best: " 'Hidden Hills' is
just like your life, only funnier." If the raunchy "Hidden Hills" is
like your life, then you watched the Emmy telecast while pursuing
cybersex.</TE>
<TE>   * For affirming that the terrorist attacks of 9/11 remain a
benchmark for everything Americana, including even awards telecasts.
That vivid reminder came when former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani
presented the TV academy's Governors Award.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, the award went to ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC for
simultaneously airing the celebrated 9/11-themed special, "America:
Tribute to Heroes." Granting them this honor reminded us that the TV
industry's arms are never too short to pat itself on the back.</TE>
<TE>   * Joan Rivers for coming through again in her flub-laden annual
pre-telecast orgy that she hosts with her daughter, Melissa, on E!
Entertainment. There she was with "Sex and the City" nominee Kim
Cattrall.</TE>
<TE>   Rivers: "And you're gonna be in off-Broadway."</TE>
<TE>   Cattrall: "No, my husband and I are writing another book."</TE>
<TE>   Well, whatever.</TE>

<HD>'CSI: Miami' as Taut, Tantalizing as Parent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" got famous being a perfectly
calibrated hybrid of mystery and forensic science. Expect that, also,
from its tropical offspring, "CSI: Miami," whose debut tonight
extends a CBS franchise that may prove as deep and mint as many
spinoffs as Dick Wolf's "Law &amp; Order" mother lode on NBC.</LD>
<LD>   In other Monday premieres, meanwhile, "Half and Half" is a humdrum
(when not flat-out dopey) addition to the night's ghetto of black
comedies on UPN.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike their Las Vegas progenitors, Miami's crime-scene snoops are
full-blown cops, led by hunch-driven Horatio Caine (David Caruso) and
Megan Donner (Kim Delaney), a sucker for science. This convenient
clash of attitudes is a bit artificial.</LD>
<TE>   When it comes to storytelling technique, however, the new series
packs as much weight as the original.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that elections aren't the only funny business in
Florida, nor gators the fiercest predators, as Caine's unit is all
over a jet crash in the Everglades that may overlap corporate fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "We got the story right here," he says, surveying the strewn
puzzle pieces before him as someone drops an arm into a plastic bag.</TE>
<TE>   That story has many layers, of course, and "CSI: Miami" peels them
back as tantalizingly as the original "CSI" has done for two seasons,
deploying dramatic lighting, extreme close-ups and taut dialogue that
has you focusing on clues instead of words.</TE>
<TE>   "Any doubts, bag it," Caine orders his unit, which the widowed
Donner headed until six months ago in a back story yet to be
explained. Not that backgrounders are a priority here.</TE>
<TE>   "She was on Prozac," someone observes about a body.</TE>
<TE>   "Who isn't?" Donner says.</TE>
<TE>   That's about it for character development.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Caine wonders why a seatbelt is unbuckled and
undamaged, why a briefcase is empty, why the body of one passenger
turns up five miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Step by step, it's all very fascinating and as well-produced as
television gets, bolstered by the understated, capable work of "NYPD
Blue" alums Caruso and Delaney. The ensemble cast also has Khandi
Alexander, so extraordinary in HBO's "The Corner," as a coroner who
talks to cadavers.</TE>
<TE>   By all logic, "CSI: Miami" should be a big hit, even though Monday
night also has fetching Jill Hennessy's competing forensics in NBC's
"Crossing Jordan." Remember, bag it. And stuff UPN's "Half and Half."</TE>
<TE>   Mona (Rachel True) says potato, Dee Dee (Essence Atkins) says
potahto in this undistinguished comedy about competing half sisters
who are both as vacant as spuds.</TE>
<TE>   They share a father. Mona's mother, Phyllis (Telma Hopkins), is
his former wife, and Dee Dee's mother, Big Dee Dee (Valarie
Pettiford), his present wife. Mona's life was full of hard knocks;
Dee was pampered. Mona is earthy and plain-spoken, Dee Dee full of
pretensions.</TE>
<TE>   They don't get along at all. Yet circumstances (a script) require
them to live near one another in an apartment house owned by their
father. That means they now bicker about men, including Mona's
platonic best friend, Spencer (Theron "Chico" Benymon).</TE>
<TE>   Much of "Half and Half" is about having sex, much of it infantile,
and the parents, Spencer and Dee Dee, are cliches and complete
idiots. Only Mona appears to have an IQ that would allow her to
function in society, even moderately, and only True demonstrates any
flair.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, the sisters fight, they bond. That's why they call it
television.</TE>
<TE>   "CSI: Miami" will be shown at 10 p.m. Mondays on CBS. The network
has rated it TV-14 (may be unsuitable for children under age 14).</TE>
<TE>   "Half and Half" will be shown at 8:30 p.m. Mondays on UPN. The
network has rated it TV-PGDL (may be unsuitable for young children
due to suggestive dialogue and coarse language).</TE>
<TE>   Howard Rosenberg's column appears Mondays and Fridays. He can be
contacted at howard.rosenberg @latimes.com</TE>

<HD>A Harvest Moon Illuminates Kosaka's Work</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If anyone understands and trusts the power of art, it ought to be the
people who put together the World Festival of Sacred Music. However,
the haunting, visionary conclusion to Hirokazu Kosaka's performance
art spectacle "Mare Tranquillitatis" was all but wrecked Saturday by
the sponsors' self-congratulatory speechmaking immediately afterward.</LD>
<LD>   Staged on a large platform outside the Japan America Theatre, the
performance drew its concept and multidisciplinary content from
tributes to the harvest moon, with the moon itself appearing over the
roof of the theater exactly at 9 p.m., as if on cue.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, the use of minimal stage lighting on a dark plaza left
the moon the brightest object on view, outshining the braziers of
burning, fragrant wood adjacent to the platform and just about
everything else except the pesky camera-flashing that some
ticket-holders inflicted on the event.</LD>
<TE>   Initially, Kosaka seemed to be merely ritualizing a collection of
moon-related world music and dance performances: the Okinawan
classical "Moon-Viewing Dance," for instance, by five women of the
Majikina Honryu ensemble. Here hands rising symmetrically into
overhead arcs or held out, as if the dancers were peering through
them, ornamented spare walking steps and discreet extensions of a
single foot.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawaiian "Ka Mahina Malama" (The Moon That Cares) segment
featured chanting by Clarice Wahineali'i Nuhi and dancing by
Kapuakahi Abulon, with Abulon's detailed gestural reinforcement of
the text superimposed on graceful swaying hips.</TE>
<TE>   Equally artful: the rich tone and embellishment in Karen Han's
solo on the classical Chinese mini-lute, the er hu. Or the unearthly
wheezing pipes dominating antique Japanese court music played by the
Kinnara Gagaku ensemble. Kosaka knew how to give our own moon viewing
variety of effect without disturbing his deeply contemplative mood.</TE>
<TE>   But it turned out that he had a more complex agenda than just
staging a tasteful lunar revue--an agenda involving pieces of paper
sculpted by the wind. Early on, as Kyokkaku Kawamoto played the
chikuzen biwa or Japanese lute and sang passages from the epic "Heike
Monogatari," Kosaka shot an arrow across the stage into a large
drum-like canister, releasing a spurt of silver and gray confetti.</TE>
<TE>   Later, chanting priests of the Los Angeles Buddhist Church
Federation cast into the air paper ovals printed with blossoms--and
these "falling leaves" not only symbolized autumn but also the
impermanence that Kosaka reiterated in his program notes.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, a fertility rite performed by members of Kosaka's
Ikkyu ensemble used the web-like explosion of rice-paper streamers
normally associated with Noh and Kabuki spider-monsters to symbolize
the procreative surge connecting two isolated beings and beginning a
new life cycle.</TE>
<TE>   The atmospheric accompaniment by Takeo Takahashi (shamisen) and
Masakazu Yoshizawa (shakuhachi) invoked tradition, but Kosaka's
gymnastic people-towers created a dreamlike fusion of past and
present.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, as Keiko Takeshita sang an aria from Bach's St.
Matthew Passion, accompanied by violinist Mary Kay Tsuji, Kosaka shot
another arrow into the night sky.</TE>
<TE>   This time, a huge cascade of white paper discs floated down from
the top of the five-story Japan America Gallery building and, while
they fell, you could almost believe that Kosaka's arrow had shattered
the moon into this shower of gleaming fragments.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, celebrations of the harvest moon enrich many cultures
with thanksgiving for abundance--and the hedge it offers against the
cruelties of winter. But there's sadness, too, in the knowledge that
the year has turned and the dying part has begun.</TE>
<TE>   By reminding us of this sadness, "Mare Tranquillitatis" invited
the audience to reconsider its own place in the cycle of time: what
part of the year our lives belong to and how soon we, too, will join
the falling leaves.</TE>

<HD>Lessons at the Piano Offer Insight About Life</HD>
<DH>The characters in '2 Pianos, 4 Hands' struggle with the
realization that their discipline and musical talent won't bring them
success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first, "2 Pianos, 4 Hands" looks like nothing more than a playful
account of two boys who are learning to play the piano.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, however, the production resonates beyond the world of
music. It explores the feelings that arise after the awful discovery
that you're not going to make it in the career for which you've
prepared for years. There are plenty of aspiring actors in Los
Angeles to whom this play would speak.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe the actors should take up the piano. It appears that
pianists Ted Dykstra and Richard Greenblatt took up acting, and the
theater, after concluding they wouldn't be Horowitzes.</LD>
<TE>   Dykstra and Greenblatt--both Canadians--not only wrote "2 Pianos,
4 Hands," but they named the leading characters Ted and Richard, and
first played the roles themselves. Dykstra's program bio says he
performed the play 701 times.</TE>
<TE>   The authors aren't on stage at La Mirada Theatre, but their
substitutes, Mark Anders as Ted and Carl J. Danielsen as Richard,
bring ample conviction and polish--musical as well as dramatic--to
the roles.</TE>
<TE>   Two grand pianos face one another across the stage. Busts of Bach
and Beethoven look down upon a formal rehearsal studio. Richard is on
one side and Ted on the other, and we see glimpses of each, as they
progress through their pianistic educations, from the ages of 8 to
18.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever the focus is on one of the boys, the other actor assumes
the role of an adult in the boy's life--a parade of piano teachers,
parents, adjudicators for competitions and conservatories. The varied
styles of the teachers provide much of the play's comedy.</TE>
<TE>   The contrasting attitudes of the boys' fathers may well lead to
serious discussions among theatergoers about the perpetual parental
question of how far to guide a child in any one direction.</TE>
<TE>   Are the rewards of intensive piano study worth the lack of
development in other areas that might prove even more important to
the child's growth?</TE>
<TE>   As the boys age, they're tempted by various forms of popular
music. Richard decides to pursue jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Later, in the most painfully funny scenes of the play, the
almost-grown boys try to earn some money. Ted starts teaching piano,
but a middle-aged matron (Danielsen) prefers to spend her lesson time
talking about her personal life.</TE>
<TE>   Richard is reduced to playing endless versions of "Piano Man" in a
cocktail lounge, where Anders plays an inebriated customer.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally we see the two boys together--as wary rivals, as
competitive duet performers and finally as friends in their 30s who
still carry a torch for the piano, even though they've now moved on
to other, largely undefined, careers.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Bruce J. Sevy, Anders and Danielsen whip through their
sketches and a wide range of musical excerpts, adept at both kinds of
"playing."</TE>
<TE>   They open and close with a more extended performance of the first
movement of a Bach concerto.</TE>

<LD>Although the television year began with much of the country watching
round the clock, commercial-free coverage of a national tragedy that
would have been unbelievable, had TV not witnessed it, the 54th
annual nighttime Emmy Awards focused on the medium's ability to tap
into emotions and provide escape.</LD>
<LD>   Television's role in holding the country's metaphorical hand in
the weeks after the terrorist attacks was acknowledged when "America:
A Tribute to Heroes," the celebrity-studded fund-raiser that was
shown on every channel, was awarded outstanding comedy, music or
variety special. Rudolph Giuliani presented the Governors Award for
extraordinary achievement to the four major networks, whose
cooperation made that program possible.</LD>
<LD>   It takes nothing away from the quality of "The West Wing" and
"Friends," winners for outstanding dramatic and comedy series,
respectively, to note that they offered views of life in a fictional
White House and a make-believe New York that were a soothing contrast
to a reality that had never been more harsh. "West Wing" cast members
John Spencer and Allison Janney also took home acting awards. The
show itself won as best drama series last year and the year before.</LD>
<TE>   "Friends' " first win as outstanding comedy series was a
reflection of the show's popularity, which grew in the past year as
it benefited from strong story lines (the pregnancy of Jennifer
Aniston's character) and the sense of comfort the audience seemed to
derive from spending time with likable, familiar characters. Aniston,
who had never before received an acting award for her role as spunky
princess Rachel Green, managed to thank a craft service person, even
in a brief speech, when accepting as outstanding actress in a comedy
series.</TE>
<TE>   Arguably, the evening's biggest upset was Michael Chiklis' win as
outstanding actor in a drama series for "The Shield," a gritty drama
that has brought controversy to FX. Chiklis' first starring role was
as John Belushi in "Wired," a 1989 movie based on Bob Woodward's
biography of the comedian. At the time, it was considered a risky
career choice to portray the dark side of the popular actor.</TE>
<TE>   The night was supposed to belong to "Six Feet Under," since the
HBO series set in the wacky world of bereavement services had
received 23 nominations. But halfway through the more than three-hour
broadcast (which uncharacteristically ran past its scheduled ending),
only two nominees from the show to take the stage were Patricia
Clarkson, who was named outstanding guest actress in an earlier
ceremony, and creator Alan Ball, whose outstanding direction of a
dramatic series was honored.</TE>
<TE>   There was still cause for toasting later at the HBO party at
Spago. The 10-part World War II epic based on the Stephen Ambrose
book "Band of Brothers" won best miniseries and best directing in a
miniseries or movie. Another HBO WWII story, "The Gathering Storm,"
won three, including one for Albert Finney for his turn as Winston
Churchill.</TE>
<TE>   Ball said he was glad "Six Feet Under," with all its tragedies and
troubled characters, is on HBO. "No matter what we do on our show,
something worse has already happened on 'Oz.' " As for adding an Emmy
to the Oscar he previously won for "American Beauty," he held up the
statue and said, "This is a lot more dangerous. You can bop someone
with the Oscar. But you can put someone's eye out with this."</TE>
<TE>   The conventions of televised award shows are as ritualized as
Kabuki. The host strives to balance a snarky wit with some respect
and sincerity. Presenters parade onstage, then share banter. The
camera lingers on nominees in the audience as their names are
announced. Winners thank everyone but their publicists, and the
proceedings are punctuated with plangent clips. Even a visit from the
Osbournes, this year's "it" family, didn't stray from the formula.</TE>
<TE>   Oprah Winfrey was the first recipient of the Bob Hope Humanitarian
Award, bestowed by a reliable Tom Hanks, a movie star now active in
television production.</TE>
<TE>   Visibly moved by a standing ovation, Winfrey thanked the people
who shared their stories on her talk show.</TE>
<TE>   She said, "This award means, to me, that I will continue to strive
to give back to the world what it has given to me, so that I may be
even more worthy of tonight's honor."</TE>
<TE>   TV creators and performers who died in the last year were
remembered with photographs. A clip of Larry King with Milton Berle,
known as Mr. Television, preceded a King tribute that established
Berle as, clearly, first among equals.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, none of the people television lost was called a hero.
Two weeks after the airwaves were filled with a flood of electronic
memories of Sept. 11, the Emmys had a sadder and wiser quality but in
the end managed to do what a grieving nation has only talked
about--move on.</TE>

<HD>Venue Was Ready for Prime Time</HD>

cast of hundreds and a sleepless night or two for the facility's
harried special projects manager.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The leggy starlets and chiseled leading men who came to the 54th
annual Emmy Awards on Sunday had a lot riding on the ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   But whether they walked away with a statuette or not, no one's
kicking them off the celebrity circuit. For the staff that runs the
Shrine Auditorium, the stakes are higher, if less glamorous.</LD>
<LD>   The Emmy Awards is the Shrine's biggest gig, and if the hall's
staff blows it--if the right door doesn't open, the wrong sink blocks
up--well, there are plenty of other venues in town.</LD>
<TE>   The Shrine staff has a policy of not running down rival halls--a
joking reference to "Building X" is about as far as it will go--but
the staff is all too aware of the Kodak Theatre and Staples Center,
which have recently landed the Oscars and Grammy Awards,
respectively. There's pressure to do it right.</TE>
<TE>   Much of this pressure comes down on one man, special projects
manager Andy Stamatin. If something goes wrong, it's his neck. A
short, intense, bald guy built like a wrestler, Stamatin, 54, has
been working at the Shrine for 12 years. He knows the building and
its history inside out, but this is his first time in charge.</TE>
<TE>   Early Sunday, the area around the auditorium, which covers almost
three acres, looks like occupied territory, jammed with trailers, NBC
production staff toting walkie-talkies, plainclothes cops, and a
small army of Pinkerton guards in black-and-white uniforms. Security
alone is several hundred people. Inside the hall, there are hundreds
of cooks, dishwashers and waiters to handle the food. There's a
maintenance staff and platoons of production staffers. Stamatin is in
charge only of the Shrine itself, but he's got to make sure all these
gears mesh smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   "What might seem to be minor to some people becomes extremely
important," he says early Sunday, sitting at a desk with three
different walkie-talkies, a TV tuned to security cameras, and in
front of the closet where he keeps more than 100 sets of keys.
Outside his office, host Conan O'Brien paces past in faded jeans and
a sweatshirt. "The trash bins, for heaven's sake--if it's filled up,
where do we put the garbage? In a place this big it could turn into a
monster. And parking--important people need a place to park. It's all
these logistics."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Stamatin woke up from a couch backstage at the Shrine
at about 1:30 a.m., to make sure the Shrine's new exterior lights,
rigged in palm trees and on pillars, were working so "The Today Show"
could tape a pre-show at 4 a.m. "I went to bed thinking about the
lights," Stamatin says. "Will they stay on? They're new; you know you
worry when something's new. 'Did somebody trip over a plug?' "</TE>
<TE>   No crisis evident, Stamatin stole a few more hours of sleep before
rolling off the couch about 5. "It was beautiful, it was peaceful,"
he says. "That's a good sign."</TE>
<TE>   It's not peaceful now. He's racing through the lobby and up some
stairs to open an extra kitchen. An elevator is stuck on the second
floor; he fixes it. With two radios stuffed in his pants pocket, his
body buzzes and hisses with static, strange voices.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later he's in an alcove making sure 4,000 programs
are hauled to the right place near the door. Then he's running back
through the lobby to check with security and make sure everything's
OK. A few hundred ushers are due any minute. He's called emergency
medical services, been handed bills for tuxedo rentals, lined up
passes and access for all his people, with special badges to get the
maintenance crew into bathrooms near the Governors Ball awards
dinner. "It gets a little wild," he says. "It's a controlled
wild--everybody knows what they're doing."</TE>
<TE>   When Stamatin's not worrying about the show, he worries about the
building, especially since it's just been though a $10-million face
lift. Stamatin loves historic buildings and takes pleasure in seeing
them restored and preserved: He's hoping the new tile outside the
lobby doesn't get torn up, that the newly polished wooden floors
don't get scratched. "You're hanging lights and speakers that are
thousands of pounds," he says. "If you don't protect the seats, they
can get destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   (As if to underscore the pressure of the night for Stamatin and
the Shrine, Bryce Zabel, president of the Academy of Television Arts
&amp; Sciences, spoke backstage about the possibility of moving the Emmy
Awards to a new theater across the street from Staples Center.)</TE>
<TE>   Stamatin came to the Shrine after moving from job to job in
Alaska, Washington and Hawaii. The highlight of his past life was a
stab at stand-up comedy and acting in the early 1980s that didn't
quite work out. "It's like a lot of people in this town: If they tell
you they're a writer or an actor, you ask them what restaurant they
work at." He did props comedy, coming on stage with a shoe in the
lapel pocket of his suit, ending it lighted up like a robot.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to end my act as an android comedian--with a tape recorder
under my shirt that would speak for me," with smoke and lights like a
magician would use. "In the end I would explode." His career never
quite did.</TE>
<TE>   Stamatin has far been more successful on the other side of the
camera. But he still gets a kick out of the red carpet, which he saw
put down Friday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "The adrenaline starts to flow, it's really cool, he said. "I'm
not jaded. I love to sneak near the red carpet with the hope that
I'll get on camera."</TE>
<TE>   He still gets a thrill hearing stars entertaining the staff, or
overhearing a teasing inside joke between, say, David Letterman and
Paul Newman. "I don't get to hang out with them," he says of the
celebs who fill his hall. "Being the staff, you don't want to throw
yourself on them. But I got my picture taken once with Stevie Wonder.
I see many a big star walk by me. I say hi, they say hi."</TE>
<TE>   Stamatin was to work until about midnight, watching the Governors
Ball unfold after the broadcast. It takes weeks to set up for the
Emmys; within three days it's all down.</TE>
<TE>   "When it's all over," he says, "it's a little sad."</TE>

<HD>UPN Hoping It Can Revive the Magic of 'Twilight Zone'
Series</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is
another dimension ... a dimension of sound ... a dimension of sight
... a dimension of mind.... You're moving into a land of both shadow
and substance ... of things and ideas.... You've just crossed over
... into the twilight zone.</LD>
<LD>   The big question is "why."</LD>
<LD>   Why would anybody want to re-create "The Twilight Zone," Rod
Serling's seminal 1959-64 CBS anthology series? The brilliantly
crafted sci-fi series, in repeats on the Sci-Fi Channel, was as close
to perfection as one could get. Previous attempts to revive the magic
and mystery of the series have failed--first as a 1983 movie and then
as a series from 1985 to '86 on CBS.</LD>
<TE>   But UPN has decided to unlock the door to "The Twilight Zone." The
hourlong series, which premiered Wednesday, is from Trilogy
Entertainment, the producing entity that successfully revived another
classic anthology series, "The Outer Limits."</TE>
<TE>   Executive producer Pen Densham has been trying for three years to
bring "Twilight Zone" back to the small screen. But it has been an
uphill battle. "Anthologies are such an anathema to television," says
Densham. "It's like trying to sell the plague."</TE>
<TE>   Densham became interested in doing a new version of the series
after he read that CBS owned the rights to "The Twilight Zone."
"Normally rights to these shows are totally tied up like they are
spaghetti," he says.</TE>
<TE>   So he approached CBS chief Les Moonves about doing the series. "In
1999, I pitched him the idea of 'The Twilight Zone' as a 40th
anniversary series. He gave it a lot of thought. We actually wrote a
bible and 22 episodes of ideas, all on spec. I really believed this
series deserved to be on the air."</TE>
<TE>   Moonves turned down the idea, but Densham didn't take no for an
answer and called him about once a year. "It was always given
consideration, but he just didn't see how this particular show would
work."</TE>
<TE>   Then when CBS took over operation of UPN earlier this year,
Densham called Moonves again, pitching "Twilight Zone" as a companion
piece to the UPN series "Star Trek: Enterprise." This time, Moonves
gave Densham the green light.</TE>
<TE>   Achieving the same caliber of storytelling as the original has
been daunting to the creative staff. "I am humbled," Densham says.
"You read the list of the number of shows that Rod wrote, and you go,
'How could he do all of this?' He was a man of biting intelligence, a
man who was using this medium to speak to humanity. I really respect
that."</TE>
<TE>   Actor-director Forest Whitaker is the host and consulting producer
on "The Twilight Zone." Whitaker had worked before for Trilogy, on
the film "Blown Away."</TE>
<TE>   "We went through a list of potential candidates, and when Forest's
name came up, we went, 'Wow, this is really cooking,' " says Densham.
"This is a man who understands storytelling, a man who has been both
behind and in front of the cameras. He is a man who has never come
out of the feature world to stand up for a TV show. We believe that
Forest spiritually was the person who could say, 'I am not Rod
Serling, but I believe in these stories.' "</TE>
<TE>   Like Densham, Whitaker is a big fan of the original "Twilight
Zone." He signed on because he felt Trilogy could do justice to the
old series. "I decided that if we could make the shows the kind of
quality they were before, then I would feel proud," the new host
said.</TE>
<TE>   As consulting producer, Whitaker reads all the scripts, gives
notes to the writers and discusses casting. He also plans to direct
at least one episode.</TE>
<TE>   While Serling was a dour but ironic host, Whitaker is upbeat and
friendly. The actor says he is playing himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I am trying to ask the audience to come with me. I can guarantee
there will be interesting shows and good shows, and let's watch these
together and let's deal with these together. The big difference is
that Rod and I have very different personalties. I am not trying to
assume his personality," Whitaker said.</TE>
<TE>   The special visual effects in the series are important but subtle.
"We call them invisible special effects," says special-effects
supervisor Sam Nicholson of Stargate Effects. "They always complement
the dramatic intent of each story rather than overshadow it."</TE>
<TE>   Densham says UPN hasn't asked him to fashion the series for young
audiences, though he acknowledges, "There is a sensibility at UPN
where they want the audience to understand where they are when they
tune into the network. But at the same time, we follow 'Star Trek,'
which has this incredibly blended audience. We are not locked into
youth mode. We are basically locked into how we can fascinate and
hold an audience."</TE>
<TE>   "The Twilight Zone" can be seen Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on UPN. The
network rated the first episode TV PG-L (may be unsuitable for young
audiences, with an advisory for language).</TE>

<HD>For a New Beginning, a Glorious 'Creation'</HD>
<DH>Conductor Franz Welser-Most opens his first season with the
great Cleveland Orchestra on a stirring note.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CLEVELAND--With so much attention going to Simon Rattle's anticipated
musical revolution in Berlin and Lorin Maazel's provocative move to
New York, a new musical era in Cleveland may not seem quite so
momentous. Certainly, the fact that Franz Welser-Most became music
director of the Cleveland Orchestra last week attracted less
attention than the outrage in some quarters over a senior, often
eccentric conductor such as Maazel taking over the helm of the New
York Philharmonic at the same time or the excitement that the feisty
Rattle generated as he assumed the helm at the Berlin Philharmonic
earlier in the month.</LD>
<LD>   But while Cleveland may not be New York or Berlin, there should be
no underestimating the importance of its great symphony orchestra.
The most memorable orchestral performance in my experience was by the
Cleveland Orchestra of Debussy's "La Mer," conducted nine years ago
by Pierre Boulez at Carnegie Hall in New York. The intoxicating
vibrancy of the playing transcended perfection, transcended the
virtuosity and brilliance typical of the New York and Berlin bands.
So compelling was the Clevelanders' identification with every note
they played that it was as if listening was no longer listening, as
if music incorporated all five senses.</LD>
<TE>   That may have been a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but at least
the memory of it came back to me at Severance Hall on Saturday night
when Welser-Most conducted a warm, lustrous, numinous performance of
Haydn's "The Creation," the oratorio he chose to begin his first
season with the orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   When the announcement of Welser-Most's appointment was made in
1999, it was a surprise. Having now just turned 42, he is thought of
as still young and perhaps not yet ready for such a prestigious post,
even though he is the same age Maazel was when he began his 10-year
term as music director in Cleveland 30 years ago. The rocky time
Welser-Most had as music director of the London Philharmonic, which
he led from 1990 to 1996 when he really was young, was not forgotten,
though it should be. Since then he has had a successful tenure at the
Zurich Opera and has become an international guest conductor in great
demand.</TE>
<TE>   There is, in fact, little fear of Welser-Most repeating his
youthful problems in London, where he was perceived as too
inexperienced and a too-provincial young Austrian. He has grown
impressively as a conductor and his musical interests have also
widened broadly, now including cutting-edge American and European
work. Programming for his first season in Cleveland is admirable, and
particularly noteworthy is his bravery in including the kind of
challenging new European work--from the likes of Hanspeter Kyburz,
Matthias Pintscher, Kaija Saariaho, George Benjamin and Mark-Anthony
Turnage--that typically scares away other American orchestras, and
certainly in such large doses.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the New York Philharmonic staged a preseason opening
gala on Wednesday for Maazel with only Beethoven. Meanwhile,
Welser-Most led a gala in Cleveland a week ago that included, along
with a Haydn symphony and some bonbons, the world premiere of a
Modernist work by the exciting young French composer Marc-Andre
Dalbavie, which was commissioned to celebrate the opening of a Frank
Gehry Case Western Reserve University building that is a new
Severance Hall neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland, moreover, has done a splendid job paving the way for
Welser-Most. The orchestra, made famous by George Szell in the '50s
and '60s, couldn't be in better shape after some two decades under
Christoph von Dohnanyi, now music director laureate. Severance Hall
underwent a renovation two years ago that not only added a welcome
new bloom to its already fine acoustics but also enhanced the natural
beauty of its ornate interior to a breathtaking new level.</TE>
<TE>   The mood for "The Creation" Saturday, the third and final night
for this first program, was uplifting. The soloists--soprano Malin
Hartelius, tenor James Taylor and, especially, baritone Thomas
Quasthoff--were ideal; the large Cleveland Orchestra, very solid. The
performance was sleek and sure, giving the sensation of not so much
interpreting this powerfully descriptive work as illuminating it.</TE>
<TE>   There was one intriguing problem in playing "The Creation" in
Cleveland, which Welser-Most did not completely solve. Haydn's score
begins famously with the depiction of chaos, with a remarkably
musical description of "the Earth without form and void" through a
blurry musical structure and striking dissonances. Perhaps it was
simply unreasonable to expect an orchestra that plays with such a
unified sound to appear dramatically chaotic.</TE>
<TE>   Still, who can complain about an extraordinary ensemble making an
extraordinary effort for its new music director? Welser-Most still
must grow to fill the role of music director of the Cleveland
Orchestra, and this ultimately stirring first performance provided
encouraging first signs that he will. But his fresh and sophisticated
programming should have its beneficial effect on keeping this secure
orchestra on its toes as well.</TE>

<LD>Michael Romei, the unflappable concierge at New York's
Waldorf-Astoria hotel, can get you more than just theater tickets.</LD>
<LD>   One guest is looking for a vegetarian restaurant that serves meat,
which only sounds like a joke. When another wants an obscure lotion,
Romei darts about midtown like a cat on the prowl, returning with jar
in hand. When another wants a table at a packed nightspot, he tells
the club the guest is from London. "If you reference a major city,
they think it's somebody important," he explains later.</LD>
<LD>   Romei is among about a dozen workers featured in A&amp;E's "It's a
Living" (9 p.m.), a "docu-tainment" special that peeks behind the
scenes of the American workplace. Unfortunately, few of the others
are as fun to watch as Romei--and there's nothing he can do about
that.</LD>
<TE>   The program, directed by Daniel Elias in quick-cutting,
freewheeling style, starts with a look at contrasting sales crews:
the gung-ho guys at a Las Vegas car dealership and the perky gals who
sell Mary Kay cosmetics in Dallas. The second half explores the "back
of the house" at the mammoth Waldorf.</TE>
<TE>   The car salesmen, led by a rap artist known as "The Chopper,"
share some insights without spilling any trade secrets. They quickly
size up which half of a couple controls the checkbook, for example.
The sparkly Mary Kay saleswomen, meanwhile, dazzle potential recruits
at their monthly "rally night" with tales of riches.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the Waldorf crew, which includes a chef, a wedding
planner and a chambermaid, comes off as efficient and pleasant.</TE>
<TE>   Soon enough, though, you may wish the producers had delved into
the seamier aspects of these jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a Living" has its moments, but not enough of them to keep it
from becoming a chore at times. Hey, whatever. It's a viewing.</TE>

<HD>'Trapped': That's Exactly How You'll Feel</HD>
<DH>Film is a slick but sadistic creep show. How this came to
be entertainment is anybody's guess.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Trapped," which opened Friday, is not the kind of unwatchable mess
you might assume a film withheld from reviewers' scrutiny would be.
It is, however, something equally unfortunate: a mess you'd rather
not be watching.</LD>
<LD>   "Trapped" is directed by Luis Mandoki in a style far from his
previous syrupy "When a Man Loves a Woman" and "Message in a Bottle."
Starring Kevin Bacon and Charlize Theron in a creep show about
vulnerable parents and sadistic kidnappers, it's slickly made and
even has a performance or two worth mentioning.</LD>
<LD>   But, true to its title, it traps audiences in a series of
relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom
not to be looking at. How torture like this came to be entertainment
is anybody's guess.</LD>
<TE>   According to a Los Angeles Times story by Anita M. Busch,
"Trapped" (adapted by Greg Iles from his own novel) was released
without benefit of media attention because the studio felt queasy
that the film's theme of child kidnapping was hitting a little too
close to reality. As Busch wrote, the film was opening at the end of
"what seemed like an endless summer of child kidnappings and
murders."</TE>
<TE>   While Sony's attempt to act with social responsibility, if that's
what it is, is well and good, the bigger question is why the studio
put a film this questionable and unsavory into production in the
first place. It would be nice if something less pressing than today's
headlines could wake a studio's ever-slumbering sense of morality and
appropriateness, but we all know that's not going to happen.</TE>
<TE>   After a prelude that gives a taste of the bad guys' modus
operandi, "Trapped" introduces us to perfect couple Karen and Will
Jennings. She (Theron) is an up-and-coming textile designer and
mother of irresistible 8-year-old Abby ("I Am Sam's" Dakota Fanning)
while he (Irish actor Stuart Townsend) is a handsome doctor who's
just invented a lucrative wonder drug.</TE>
<TE>   Into these lives comes a trio of kidnappers, each of whom focuses
on one family member. The hulking Marvin (an effective Pruitt Taylor
Vince) gets to baby-sit the little girl, the blowsy Cheryl (Courtney
Love) is assigned to vamp Will, conveniently out of town at a medical
convention, while mastermind Joe (Bacon) gets wife detail.</TE>
<TE>   This is fine by him because Joe considers himself something of a
mind-games expert. Using a nervy charisma and pop-psychology lines
like "I'm going to help you through this thing" and "I give parents
the power to keep them alive," he feels more than able to manipulate
any woman any way he wants.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of smug and nasty manipulator is ready-made for Bacon to
play, and he makes the most of the opportunity. The actor's clearly
the most accomplished of the four leads and it's a shame you'd have
to endure this film to experience his performance.</TE>
<TE>   Making the film even more unpleasant than its severely
asthmatic-child-in-constant-danger-of-death plot would indicate is a
smarmy subplot that involves the kidnapper's constant attempts to
seduce the wife as a way for her to ensure the child's safety.</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say, as Joe eventually discovers, Karen is "not like
the other moms," and this would-be perfect crime hits any number of
speed bumps. In fact, the Jenningses are so intrepid that Sony
apparently considers "Trapped" to be an empowerment movie. Sitting
though endless misogynistic torture scenes to witness a few brief
moments of revenge is no sane person's idea of empowerment, parental
or otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for violence, language, sexual content. Times
guidelines: wall to wall with unsavory situations.</TE>

<DL>VLADIKAVKAZ, Russia</DL>
<LD>Rescuers evacuated a southern Russian village threatened by meltwater
from a collapsed glacier Sunday, amid fears that hot weather could
cause flooding in areas where the search for 80 missing people
continues.</LD>
<LD>   Local officials said 24 bodies had been recovered, although
authorities in Moscow said only six had been retrieved from the area
around the village of Karmadon, North Ossetia, a region near Russia's
border with Georgia.</LD>
<LD>   Late Sunday, 84 people were moved from the nearby village of
Gornaya Saniba, which faced inundation by 1.4 billion cubic feet of
melted ice that has collected in two large new lakes, Itar-Tass news
agency reported. The lakes formed on the millions of tons of ice, mud
and debris that thundered down a valley Friday when a huge chunk of
the Maili glacier broke free.</LD>
<TE>   Emergency officials believe that at least 100 people were killed.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounded like a train was coming, but there are no trains here.
We saw an enormous mass coming in our direction, and we ran," said
Dmitri Podalyakin, 18, who was sitting with friends in a cafe when
the avalanche roared down.</TE>
<TE>   "When we came back, we saw that some of the cabins were covered by
the mass. There were cries of 'Save us!' but we could do nothing
except stand there," he said. "Soon the cries stopped."</TE>

<LD>Swaziland's King Mswati III has chosen an 18-year-old student as his

king picked out his bride-to-be, Nolichwa Ntenteza, during a
traditional reed dance festival in southern Swaziland.</LD>
<LD>   Mswati can choose a new wife every year from among thousands of
virgins who parade at annual dance ceremonies. He chose a 17-year-old
as his ninth wife last year.</LD>
<LD>   Official biographers say Mswati's father, King Sobhuza, had more

the air and prompted the state oil company to evacuate 8,000 workers
from drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Yucatan state Gov. Patricio Patron ordered 70,000 people to
evacuate and said "the worst of scenarios" was happening as Isidore
marched along the state's coast with 125-mph winds, then edged inland
toward the capital.</LD>

<HD>Rural Protest Draws 400,000 to London</HD>
<DH>Britain: Marchers' concerns range from official neglect to
decline in income.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET STOBART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>In one of the biggest anti-government demonstrations ever held here,
more than 400,000 rural Britons marched Sunday to protest what they
called official neglect and misunderstanding of country life.</LD>
<LD>   Labeled "Liberty and Livelihood," the march was organized by the
Countryside Alliance, an umbrella movement representing myriad groups
of rural protesters. It focused on a string of problems that country
dwellers say have been eroding their way of life.</LD>
<LD>   Although the catalyst for the rally was a proposed ban on fox
hunting, already announced by Prime Minister Tony Blair, the
demonstrators' complaints ranged from the steep decline in many
farmers' income since the outbreaks of "mad cow" and foot-and-mouth
disease in Britain to a lack of social services in the countryside.
Some said the confluence of rising housing prices and government
building projects threatens to destroy rural communities.</LD>
<TE>   The demonstrators, who came from throughout Britain, were joined
by supporters from the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere in
Europe to form a dense throng that snaked through central London
toward Whitehall, the street lined with government buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Participants wound up in Parliament Square, where an electronic
counting system had clocked a total of more than 407,000 by 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Many protesters arrived after overnight journeys by road and rail,
and there was a predominance of the sludge-green weatherproof jackets
and tweedy garments worn in the British countryside as marchers
strode down Piccadilly, normally the reserve of tourists and
shoppers. They tended to represent the "Liberty" quota of the march,
and most had the air of landed gentry.</TE>
<TE>   Among the "Livelihood" contingent, by contrast, work clothes or
jeans and sneakers marked the farmers, gamekeepers, independent
country dwellers and workers from cottage and rural industries.</TE>
<TE>   One of them, Paul Larby, said he has been a professional huntsman
for 28 years but foresees his livelihood disappearing.</TE>
<TE>   "My house goes with the job. I have two sons. I've watched the
erosion of the countryside under successive governments who have
never understood it or how it works," he said.</TE>
<TE>   William and Ann Brown, who have three young children, farm 1,000
acres in Wiltshire in the west of England.</TE>
<TE>   "The prices we get for our produce--beef, lamb, cereals--are
totally unrelated to what it is sold for to the consumer," Ann Brown
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We sell barley for 50 pounds [about $75] a ton now instead of 101
pounds of two years ago," said Jenny Higgins of her family farm's
produce in Shropshire, to the north.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, figures distributed by the Countryside Alliance show farm
incomes 71% lower than in 1995, with arable farm incomes down by more
than 90%. To this, the organization adds the stark reality that the
average age of Britain's farmers is now 58.</TE>
<TE>   A number of city dwellers, or townies, also turned out Sunday in
sympathy with their rural brethren. Bearing the banner "City of
Westminster" was John Ong, a banker from Ohio and a Londoner for the
last 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's catastrophic that English country life should feel
so threatened," he said. "For Americans, England is the country that
epitomizes rural life."</TE>
<TE>   Another American, Russell Clarke, who chairs the U.S. chapter of
the Countryside Alliance, was "totally in agreement with everything
that is being protested about today. We [hunters] are trying to keep
a balance, not trying to annihilate a species."</TE>
<TE>   The right of rural people to live their lives in the way they
choose, and respect for the values and customs of rural
communities--which would include safeguards against prejudiced
attacks on hunting and field sports--were among five points the
Countryside Alliance listed as matters to be pursued with the
government after the protest.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not so much a protest between town and country. It's the
countryside against parliamentary indifference," Countryside Alliance
chief executive Richard Burge said before the march.</TE>
<TE>   Rural Britons, he said, are "a minority community that feels
disenfranchised, unloved and fearful. It doesn't feel that democracy
through the ballot box is representing country interests."</TE>
<TE>   A slew of new regulations since Britain's bouts of "mad cow" and
foot-and-mouth disease has meant that farmers are not only underpaid
but overburdened by bureaucracy, Burge said.</TE>
<TE>   John Jackson, the movement's chairman and author of the march's
slogan, said Sunday evening: "Anybody who thinks this is just about
hunting must be living on another planet."</TE>

<HD>Chilling 'Chatter' of Jihad</HD>
<DH>Wiretaps of an Al Qaeda cell in Italy reveal not only
possible missed signals of attacks but a glimpse at a world of angry,
adrift extremists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILAN, Italy</DL>
<LD>They knew the police were spying on them, but they needed to talk. So
the members of the Al Qaeda cell often met in a car. They thought the
police were unlikely to bug the car.</LD>
<LD>   They were wrong.</LD>
<LD>   The Citroen sedan rolled over trolley tracks and under viaducts on
the graffiti-smeared outskirts of Milan. It cruised past old
trattorias and new Islamic butcher shops, past wavy-haired Italians
on motorcycles and hooded immigrant women lugging groceries.</LD>
<TE>   At the wheel was the top Al Qaeda operative in Italy, Abdelkader
Mahmoud Es Sayed, whose car served as a headquarters, a refuge, a
kind of confessional for aspiring holy warriors.</TE>
<TE>   "Sheik, if someone wants to go fight, why don't you let him?" a
tormented 31-year-old Tunisian named Adel ben Soltane asked while
riding in the Citroen on Dec. 7, 2000, according to transcripts of
intercepts by Italian police.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing is that you dream about it," Es Sayed
answered paternally. "When the moment comes, you never know if you'll
be a martyr in Algeria, Tunisia, America or in Central Asia. You
won't know."</TE>
<TE>   "I want to eliminate these pigs, these swine," Ben Soltane said.
He told Es Sayed that he despised everything about Italy: "I hate the
people, I hate the documents .... I want to go anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   In countless hours of wiretaps over two years, members of the
Milan cell schemed, threatened and told war stories, their voices
full of hate and despair. Many were extremists from North African
countries who fled to Italy to escape prosecution. But they were
alienated in their adopted land as well; they sounded like men who
felt permanently and dangerously adrift.</TE>
<TE>   The law enforcement slang for such intercepted conversations is
"chatter," a term that has become widely used in U.S. media and
public discussion of terrorism. The main significance of chatter has
been in detecting future attacks, reconstructing past ones and
mapping Al Qaeda's far-flung networks.</TE>
<TE>   There has been great scrutiny of scraps of dialogue intercepted
around the world before the Sept. 11 attacks, comments that now seem
portentous, possible missed signs. Italian and U.S. agents, for
instance, are investigating a fugitive Yemeni who visited the
suspects in Italy in August 2000 and talked about plans for a big
attack involving airplanes and airports, indicating he may have had
knowledge of the Sept. 11 plot.</TE>
<TE>   But chatter also helps investigators understand the motives and
personalities of Islamic extremists. Although Al Qaeda has been hurt
by an international crackdown, the events of the last year have left
an angry new generation of extremists eager for action, according to
law enforcement experts in Italy, France and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "The young men are agitated," an Italian investigator said. "They
want to go out and do something. The imams have to calm them down."</TE>
<TE>   The reality of Al Qaeda is elusive because of the organization's
stealth and anarchic culture. More than court testimony or
confessions, the chatter on wiretaps comes close to capturing the
truth.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, barriers of culture and language still interfere.
Defendants in Milan have complained about the quality of official
interpreters. In an Al Qaeda case in Madrid, defense lawyers accused
police of mistaking innocent references to buying fruit and
vegetables as code words for terrorist activities.</TE>
<TE>   The Milan transcripts contain a fly-on-the-wall account of the
daily life of these men, building on wiretaps of the Citroen, phones,
apartments and a mosque. The documents became public in court cases;
some suspects have been convicted, others are on trial, and at least
one is presumed dead.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects spent much of their time discussing fraudulent
documents, devoting such energy and secrecy to the deals that at
first police thought they were talking about explosives. The
intercepts also recorded strategy sessions, furtive trips, and
monologues praising Osama bin Laden and radical clerics.</TE>
<TE>   The young men saw themselves as warrior-monks assailed by the
temptations of a prosperous, fun-loving society.</TE>
<TE>   The way other men might watch pornography, they sat in a seedy
apartment chortling at videos of moujahedeen slaughtering Russian
soldiers in the snows of Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, look how they cut his throat," a suspect named Khaled
exclaimed, according to the transcript of an intercept March 22,
2001, in an apartment in suburban Gallarate.</TE>
<TE>   "Why's the other one alive?" a man named Farid said as gunfire
from the television echoed in the background.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they are getting ready to burn," Khaled said. He started
reminiscing about his own combat experiences in Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "When the order from the emir came, it was beautiful," he
recalled, "because first we studied the structure and then, with the
plastic [explosive], boom! ... And right afterward the building
collapsed and then dust.... And then a fire started, and this way the
enemies of God were buried and burned."</TE>
<TE>   Turning back to the video, Farid marveled: "This cassette is
really scary.... You can see the [Russian] commandos realize they are
having their throats cut by real soldiers.... The best commandos in
the world would tremble if they saw this."</TE>
<TE>   The voices caught on tape seem alternately vicious, philosophical
and lonely. Their talk was essential to keeping up morale, according
to prosecutor Stefano Dambruoso.</TE>
<TE>   "These are people with a lot of problems," Dambruoso said.
"Adapting to this country is devastating to them. In radical
religious activity they found rules, a structure. It's not just
religious, it's psychological and personal. The talk helps them stay
fanaticized, to maintain their mind and never relent. Because in
Europe, it would be easy to get out. To get a job, form a family,
live normally. But they are angry at life in general."</TE>
<TE>   The anger trapped them in a doomed existence, although they had
alternatives, judging from another exchange in the Citroen.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't like this nice life? You want to die?" Es Sayed asked
Ben Soltane.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen, sheik, if I liked this life, I would go to my cousin who
is in Germany and wants to marry me," Ben Soltane answered. "In five
years, I would have a German passport and live in peace."</TE>
<TE>   The Milan cell was one of Al Qaeda's busiest logistics operations
in Europe before Sept. 11. A Tunisian-dominated network used Milan as
a hub for recruits traveling via Iran to training camps in
Afghanistan. With connections to cells in Britain, Germany, Belgium,
Spain and France, the Milan cell provided services to terrorists
passing through.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to work with me, this is the job," Es Sayed told his
underlings. "If the brothers want to hide, we hide them. If the
brothers want documents, we take care of their documents .... If they
need a gun, you give them a gun."</TE>
<TE>   Es Sayed, the central figure in the Milan investigation, fled
Italy for Afghanistan with police on his tail in July of last year.
He comes across in the transcripts as smooth, manipulative and
enigmatic.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Tunisian suspects clearly revered Es Sayed, an
Egyptian in his late 30s. A veteran of Islamic movements in Egypt, Es
Sayed was an imam, or prayer leader, an expert document forger and
trusted associate of Ayman Zawahiri, the Egyptian right-hand man of
Bin Laden, and other senior figures in Al Qaeda, according to court
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Es Sayed liked to reminisce about the time he met Bin Laden. He
preached patience to his restless acolytes. During the conversation
Dec. 7, he told them a parable.</TE>
<TE>   "You say you want to be a martyr," he said. "Even if you die at
this moment, you will be a martyr.... Once I met a brother, he was
Egyptian.... He didn't go out to fight or do attacks. When the groups
came back and he noticed that the brothers were tired, he would help
them take off their shoes and wash their feet. He came and helped me
take off my shoes and wash my feet.... One day at dawn, we got word
that he had been discovered and killed. You see, he was a martyr. The
jihad has changed. Today, everybody does the jihad. One way or
another."</TE>
<TE>   Despite a conviction on terrorism charges in Egypt, Es Sayed was
granted political refugee status by the Italian government in 1997,
causing speculation that he had secret ties to an intelligence
service that helped him gain refuge.</TE>
<TE>   Es Sayed's deputy in Milan was Essid Sami ben Khemais, a Tunisian
who ran a small maintenance firm as a cover. Ben Khemais was
convicted here in February along with three confederates and
sentenced to five years in prison for document fraud, criminal
association with intent to obtain arms and explosives and
immigration-related charges. Ben Soltane and two others were
convicted in a later trial.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys have insisted that the suspects are not
terrorists but low-level criminals and radical wannabes.</TE>
<TE>   It seems hard, however, to explain away the detailed evidence. The
intercepts and surveillance revealed contact between the Milan cell
and top Al Qaeda figures in Europe and Afghanistan. The suspects
talked about attacks, training camps, fake documents and other
activities that sound very much like terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The wiretaps helped connect the group to specific plots, such as
an aborted attack on a cathedral in France in December 2000. But
police have not yet deciphered other sinister but vague references,
such as an exchange during which Es Sayed told Ben Soltane: "Don't
forget the project of the Jew."</TE>
<TE>   To which Ben Soltane answered, according to the transcript: "I
told you that I'm ready for anything: If you want me to bring him to
you in a box [translator's note: dead], I'll bring him to you in a
box." [Es Sayed can be heard laughing.]</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes it is difficult to separate menacing bluster from bona
fide conspiracy, especially when conversations are in code. Es Sayed
changed phones or phone numbers 30 times in about six months to
further thwart surveillance, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   Although fully aware of the risks, the suspects kept talking. A
visiting Libyan brandished a portable phone as he warned his friends
that technology had been the downfall of a cell in Frankfurt,
Germany, according to a transcript from the Gallarate apartment March
10, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "You see this?" the Libyan said. "This was created by an enemy of
God. This has blown many operations and has caused more arrests than
you can imagine. Why do you think the brothers in Germany got
arrested? With this. When they were talking, the others were
listening.... It's nice, you can communicate. It's fast, but it
causes big problems. They made it, and they know how to intercept
it."</TE>
<TE>   Prophetic words. Anti-terrorist investigators were adept at
planting interception devices, even rigging a video camera in a
flowerpot outside a mosque on Viale Jenner in Milan. The extremists
eventually found the camera, but despite their suspicions, they did
not find the microphones concealed inside the mosque.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a spy in the mosque," muttered a suspect named Yassine in
the Citroen. "There are two possibilities. Either there are spy
microphones inside to listen, or there are, and this is for sure,
informants who bring them the information ... and I'll bet it's full
of cameras."</TE>
<TE>   The audiotapes recorded in the mosque posed a challenge to police
interpreters, who had to distinguish among multiple simultaneous
conversations.</TE>
<TE>   Other voices appeared only briefly in the intercepts but became
important as the investigation advanced in cooperation with U.S. law
enforcement. An arrest in Afghanistan bolstered the case pending
against Abdelhalim Remadna, an alleged recruiter who worked at the
Islamic Cultural Center adjacent to the mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors accuse Remadna of arranging sojourns by extremists in
a training camp in Afghanistan. The recruits in Italy allegedly
included Mohamed Aouzar, a skinny 21-year-old Moroccan who glowers
behind oversized black glasses in his mug shot.</TE>
<TE>   The two men can be heard in a series of short, urgent phone
conversations as Aouzar prepared for his trip with two older men in
late June 2001, according to the transcript. Aouzar sounded
breathless and apologetic as he called the mosque to say he was
running late and asked his companions not to leave without him.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, we are going to be late, very, very," he exclaimed. "He has
to wait there for me!"</TE>
<TE>   "Fine, fine," Remadna responded.</TE>
<TE>   "Make him wait," Aouzar said.</TE>
<TE>   The young Moroccan made it to Afghanistan. He survived a ferocious
battle in a prison outside Mazar-i-Sharif and was captured by
U.S.-led troops in December, according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Es Sayed was not so lucky. Authorities say the Egyptian was killed
in combat in Afghanistan last winter. Remadna and two other suspects
are on trial in Milan.</TE>
<TE>   And Aouzar and seven others from Italy are now prisoners at the
U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba--a place far from home where they
can find solace in talk.</TE>

<HD>Soccer Chief Seeks Highest Goal for Himself</HD>
<DH>Asia: Still shining in South Korea's World Cup glory,
presidential candidate wows crowds and gives some kick to an
otherwise dull race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>With chants thundering through the auditorium and many in the crowd
wearing scarves in the color of their national team, you might be
forgiven for thinking you had stumbled into a pep rally for a soccer
match.</LD>
<LD>   But no, this was purely politics.</LD>
<LD>   The crowd had packed an auditorium in the South Korean National
Assembly building last week to watch Chung Mong Jun declare his
candidacy. Chung, the head of the country's soccer association, is
trying to parlay the euphoria from South Korea's shining moment in
the 2002 World Cup into a bid for the presidency.</LD>
<TE>   Handsome, rich, glib, athletic and youthful by the somewhat
geriatric standards of Korean politics--some even call him
Kennedyesque--the 50-year-old Chung looks like he just might have a
fighting chance in the Dec. 19 contest.</TE>
<TE>   Chung, a scion of the Hyundai dynasty, has the money to compensate
for his lack of an established political party. And the public's
disgust with politics-as-usual might make the timing right for a
candidate whose most notable achievement has been bringing the
world's most prestigious soccer event to South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "To be in politics is like football. You have to be smart enough
to understand the game, but dumb enough to think it's important,"
said Chung, opening a recent speech with a characteristically
self-deprecating style of humor borrowed from U.S. politics.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Chung seems more American than Korean in his political
mannerisms. He did his graduate studies at MIT and Johns Hopkins
University, speaks fluent English and deftly drops quotes from the
Bible, Eugene McCarthy and Martin Luther King Jr. No rank political
novice, he has served 15 years in the South Korean national
legislature.</TE>
<TE>   But his claim to fame is as a vice president of FIFA, world
soccer's governing body, and as head of the Korean association.</TE>
<TE>   "If not for the World Cup, he would be just another rich guy
dabbling in politics," said Hahm Sung Deuk, a political scientist at
Korea University in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   The tattered state of the political parties in South Korea has
created a window of opportunity for an independent such as Chung.
South Korea's lame-duck president, Kim Dae Jung, has been hit by a
series of corruption scandals involving his sons, and public anger
over the scandals has spilled over to undermine the standing of Kim's
protege, human rights lawyer Roh Moo Hyun. Opposition leader Lee Hoi
Chang has been hurt among his core conservative constituency by
questions over why his sons did not serve in the army.</TE>
<TE>   How Chung would run South Korea remains a mystery. His campaign
rhetoric so far has focused almost entirely on reforming the
political system, fighting the traditional ways of party politics and
diminishing regionalism. But a few offhand comments suggest that he
would pursue rapprochement with North Korea even more aggressively
than President Kim, the architect of the "sunshine policy" of better
relations with the North.</TE>
<TE>   Chung says he was intrigued by a recent suggestion by one of the
newspapers here that South Korea dedicate 1% of its national budget
to helping North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a hundred times larger than the current government is
providing," he said. "Maybe we can expand humanitarian assistance if
it is within the limit of our ability."</TE>
<TE>   When asked by a South Korean journalist if he would not demand
more reciprocity from North Korea--a favorite criticism by
conservatives of the current government--Chung retorted: "If it's
humanitarian aid, you shouldn't be asking them to reciprocate."</TE>
<TE>   To a large extent, Chung's comments about North Korea appear to
mirror a passion of his late father's. Chung Ju Yung, who died last
year, was born to a peasant family in North Korea and later fled
south, where he established the huge Hyundai conglomerate. In his
final years, he devoted a large portion of his enormous wealth to
helping North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Under his helm, Hyundai started the first guided tours by South
Koreans into the Northern resort of Mt. Kumgang. At one point, he
personally delivered hundreds of cows across the DMZ to make amends
for a cow he stole when he fled the North at 16.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Chung also made a bid for the presidency--one that ended
calamitously for him and for Hyundai. Not only did Chung come in
third in the 1992 race, but he was charged and convicted of
embezzling $80 million from a unit of Hyundai to fund his campaign.
Only by dint of his advanced age and ill health did he avoid going to
prison.</TE>
<TE>   The senior Chung's campaign so angered the South Korean
establishment that for years afterward Hyundai companies faced
difficulties getting bank loans and government contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the legacy of the elder Chung's failed presidential race
hangs heavily over his son's bid and may be his biggest political
liability. Mindful of what happened in 1992, some unions at Hyundai
are threatening to actively oppose the younger Chung's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "In the case of his father, he promised not to use company money
for the campaign, but that was a lie.... Hyundai Group companies were
driven to the point of bankruptcy," said Chang Gyu Ho, a spokesman
for the Hyundai Motors company union.</TE>
<TE>   Chung has said that for the duration of the campaign, he is
removing himself from any active role with Hyundai Group and putting
his stock holdings into a trust. He is the largest stockholder of
Hyundai Heavy Industries, owning 11% and serving as an advisor to the
giant shipbuilder.</TE>
<TE>   "My father was a businessman. His understanding and exposure to
politics was somewhat limited," Chung said. "Maybe his presidential
campaign could have been done differently."</TE>
<TE>   Another potential liability for Chung in what remains an
essentially conservative society is an unusual family history. The
youngest of six sons, Chung is reported in the press to be the
tycoon's illegitimate child by a mistress who gave the boy up as a
baby to be raised with the rest of the family. Chung has not denied
the story, but he hasn't elaborated, either.</TE>
<TE>   So far, however, Chung is enjoying something of a honeymoon as the
newest contender in the pack. Polls show him running close behind
opposition leader Lee, but potentially winning if he teams up with
Roh--as many predict will happen in the final weeks of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Political scientist Hahm said that at the very least, Chung's
presence will add some spark to an otherwise dull election season.</TE>
<TE>   "I see him as a figure like H. Ross Perot," he said. "Chung Mong
Jun's presence will increase voter turnout and interest. And his
agenda will surely play a role in the race."</TE>

<HD>Forger's Fakes Are a Real Steal</HD>
<DH>Fraud: John Myatt spent years illegally copying and selling
masterpieces. Now he adds his name to them, and art lovers are
snapping up the works.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET STOBART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WARWICK, England</DL>
<LD>A small gallery here in Warwick, a town known more for its 14th
century castle than for 20th century masterpieces, is drawing art
lovers to an exhibit with some landmark signatures--Picasso, Matisse,
Dubuffet, Chagall.</LD>
<LD>   The artworks represent the new, "honest" career of John Myatt, a
master forger whose cleverly marketed fakes fooled experts for years
in one of the art world's longest-running scams.</LD>
<LD>   The paintings in Warwick are fakes too--but everyone knows it.</LD>
<TE>   And buyers are willing to shell out thousands of pounds for them.
Every one of the paintings in the show--Myatt's first since leaving
prison three years ago after serving a four-month sentence for his
infamous career--has already sold.</TE>
<TE>   The two-room gallery swarms with local art lovers putting in bids
for a seascape by Raoul Dufy or a Giacometti sketch or a cubist
canvas by Braque. They mingle with television crews and the bemused
gallery's owner, Alan Elkin.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought this would happen," Elkin says. "We had German TV
in yesterday, and Mexican TV is coming tomorrow." He says he's
looking forward to the usual quiet life of a country art gallery
owner once he's delivered the 70-plus paintings to their new homes.</TE>
<TE>   Myatt, congenial, unassuming and relieved to have put his life of
fraud behind him, now signs his name on the back of each painting.</TE>
<TE>   "There'll be a chip or something in them as well," he says,
sitting in a corner of the gallery. Myatt speaks matter-of-factly
about his life as a forger.</TE>
<TE>   For more than seven years beginning in 1987, Myatt worked with a
consummate con man and art dealer, John Drewe. "He'd say, 'We could
do with another [Ben] Nicholson or something,' " is how Myatt
describes the casual way business was done.</TE>
<TE>   Myatt would paint and deliver his forgeries to Drewe, who, after
careful research and doctoring of records, would offer the works to
respected institutions of fine art--Christie's, Sotheby's, even
London's hallowed Tate Gallery, as well as private art houses. Then
Drewe would hand Myatt a check for his part of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Their aesthetic life of crime began when Myatt, an art teacher
from the Midlands of England, was working in London as a songwriter.
He painted imitations of Old Masters for friends and, to make more
money, he says, "I put an ad in [the satirical magazine] Private Eye
offering 'Genuine Fakes.' "</TE>
<TE>   It brought him enjoyable, if not profitable, success--like the
time a man "wanted a Joshua Reynolds of a British admiral looking out
to sea with medals and sash."</TE>
<TE>   "I changed the face to his own," Myatt says, "so he could say to
dinner party guests: 'That's my great-great-great-uncle--don't you
see the resemblance?' "</TE>
<TE>   Myatt charged a modest 250 pounds (about $375) per painting--often
less than the framing costs.</TE>
<TE>   Then Drewe answered the ad. "He said, 'Can you paint me a Matisse
for my wife?' " Myatt says. They met and exchanged painting for
payment on a London train station platform. Drewe and his wife liked
the painting and asked for another.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the unusual thing about him," Myatt remembers. "He then
said, 'Can you do a Dutch marine painting?' He just kept coming
back."</TE>
<TE>   The turning point was "Portrait of an Army Doctor" by French
artist Albert Gleizes. "It wasn't a copy--I found a drawing by him
and developed it into what I thought he would have done if he'd
turned his drawing into a painting," Myatt says.</TE>
<TE>   Drewe reframed the painting, and two weeks later, "he said: 'You
know that Gleizes? I've just taken it into Christie's, and they say
it's probably worth about 25,000 pounds--how would you like 12 1/2
thousand?' "</TE>
<TE>   As Myatt recalls with rueful hindsight, "this is where the train
veered off to the left of the track instead of going straight
on--that was the fatal moment."</TE>
<TE>   Myatt's wife had recently left him with two toddlers. He was
living back in Staffordshire, in an old, unheated farmhouse, juggling
a teaching career and the children. Drewe's offer seemed like one he
couldn't afford to refuse.</TE>
<TE>   For Myatt, it was less a question of morality, he says, and "more
a question of survival."</TE>
<TE>   The pair chose deceased painters, and mostly British artists
because Drewe found he could get into archives "and give the painting
a history that will verify it," as he told Myatt.</TE>
<TE>   One recipient of Myatt's paintings, Peter Nahum, an art gallery
owner in central London, remembers seeing Drewe's offerings. Nahum
took a Nicholson and a Graham Sutherland and sent them to Christie's
to be auctioned--"but only after they [had been] authenticated by
Christie's and Sotheby's," he emphasizes. "The Nicholson was not very
good, but the artist's son-in-law also gave it his blessing." He
remembers it being sold at auction in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Is Myatt a good artist? No. Without John Drewe, his pictures
wouldn't have gone anywhere," Nahum says. In his view, Drewe's
ability to fake the records regarding the provenance of
paintings--rather than Myatt's skill--gave them their seal of
authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   Despite, or perhaps because of, the embarrassment the scandal
brought upon the art world, Nahum judges it "a very important case
for the art business."</TE>
<TE>   Art, like any creative profession, is wide open to fraud, he says,
and big names do not offer security. "Private people going to
Christie's and Sotheby's is a bit like going on the stock exchange as
a private person--it's not a safe place to buy unless you have access
to due diligence," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Nahum believes that at least 70 forged Myatts were sold on the
international market to unsuspecting buyers. He says he was offered
other works that he later learned were by Myatt. He turned them down
and eventually gave evidence to the police.</TE>
<TE>   Several years into his partnership with Drewe, Myatt became
sickened by his fraud, he says.</TE>
<TE>   He told Drewe--who was himself in turmoil over a broken
marriage--to sell any paintings he still had, but at auction, not as
original masterpieces, and to keep the money. Their relationship
ended.</TE>
<TE>   Drewe apparently didn't do as Myatt had asked. A year later, Myatt
says, Scotland Yard police came to his farmhouse with a search
warrant. Drewe's estranged wife had gone through his papers, found
incriminating correspondence and reported him.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Drewe, who police estimated had made about 2.5 million
pounds from the fraud, went on trial. He defended himself and was
sentenced to six years in prison. He was released after two years but
last year was ordered to pay a 125,000-pound fine, despite his pleas
of penury and innocence.</TE>
<TE>   Myatt pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one year, which was
reduced to four months, at Brixton prison, one of London's least
modernized facilities. There he sketched prisoners' portraits.</TE>
<TE>   When Myatt was freed in June 1999, he had "pretty much decided to
pack up painting," he says. But friends asked for a Monet or another
Nicholson. "I said no, but if you're prepared to have something that
looks like one ... " was his answer. Gradually he built up a
collection.</TE>
<TE>   Several London galleries apparently eager to cash in on his
notoriety offered to show his work. Then he heard from the Warwick
gallery.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't particularly want to exhibit in London. I come from the
Midlands--so here it is," he says.</TE>
<TE>   His story has aroused interest in the film world--media reports
talk of Michael Douglas' interest--but Myatt isn't holding his
breath.</TE>
<TE>   "They sent a scriptwriter over. If they do something, it will
probably be loosely based on my story," Myatt says. "I'll go and see
the film if it comes out."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he can afford the luxury of painting what or whom he
likes, an enviable position for a genuine forger.</TE>

<HD>Schroeder Hangs On in Germany</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS and JEFFREY FLEISHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder hung on to the German leadership by the
slimmest of margins in a cliffhanger election Sunday, after rising in
voters' esteem at the campaign's eleventh hour for his steadfast
refusal to commit German troops to a war against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Overcoming his failure to reform the shackled economy or put more
people back to work, Schroeder weathered accusations of
anti-Americanism as he tapped into Germans' wellspring of resentment
about U.S. bullying and Washington's desire to topple Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   The photo finish between Schroeder's Social Democrats and their
conservative opponents, led by the Christian Social Union's Edmund
Stoiber, reflected the deep divisions in German society over both
domestic and foreign policy. The Bavarian governor had accused the
incumbent chancellor of damaging cherished ties with U.S. allies and
instilling fear among Germans.</LD>
<TE>   In the closest election result in modern German history, the
conservatives gained ground on the incumbents by making the 10%
jobless rate and a stagnant economy the main issues, while Schroeder
pulled up in the last leg by promoting a more independent and
self-assured foreign policy for this NATO member nation.</TE>
<TE>   Complete official results today showed that Schroeder's party and
his allies in the Greens environmentalist movement won a combined
47.1% of the vote to continue their coalition for another four years.
The opposition Christian Democratic Union in alliance with the
Bavaria-only Christian Social Union and the pro-business Free
Democrats had a total of 45.9%.</TE>
<TE>   Before the complete results were announced, a beaming Schroeder
waited until well after midnight to appear before supporters in what
served as a turn in the winner's circle. But mindful of the U.S.
postelection fiasco two years ago, he refrained from declaring a
categorical victory. He was accompanied by Greens Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer, hoarse from weeks of frantic campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   "A majority is a majority, and if we have it, we will use it,"
Schroeder said, alluding to the narrowness of his coalition's lead.
The Social Democrats and Stoiber's CDU-CSU alliance polled about
38.5% each, with the Greens' 8.6% giving the incumbents the edge over
the conservatives and the Free Democrats, who polled a disappointing
7.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Stoiber, who had leaped on exit poll projections to proclaim his
party the winner, conceded at 1 a.m. that his opponents appeared to
have clung to a majority. But he predicted that the government would
be in crisis "inside of a year" and claimed a "strategic victory" for
his side in erasing the nearly 6-percentage-point lag his party
suffered behind the Social Democrats in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Under Germany's complicated election system, voters choose parties
rather than an individual chancellor candidate, leaving the
appointment of a government leader up to a majority coalition. Though
neither pair of allied parties posted an outright majority, the
failure of the former Communists to clear a 5% threshold to take a
share of the proportional vote meant that the seats would be
redistributed to give the incumbent coalition an estimated 306 to the
opposition's 295. The ex-Communists, the Party of Democratic
Socialism, won only two directly elected seats in what will be a
603-member Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   In a postelection talk show, Stoiber accused his opponent of
playing "the politics of fear" by labeling U.S. policy toward Iraq
military adventurism. He reiterated campaign claims that Schroeder
had damaged relations with U.S. allies with his electioneering. But
voters tended to see the chancellor's position as defending them
against American bullying.</TE>
<TE>   "Schroeder caught the feelings of Germans opposed to war," said
Alexander Marczewski, a political science student from Konstanz, near
the border with Switzerland. "The opposition to Iraq is not about
anti-Americanism. The U.S. has to accept that we are our own country.
It must accept the fact that other countries can disagree with it but
still be its partner."</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Steiner, a Social Democrat for decades, put it this way:
"Yes, the economy is bad. Yes, people are angry. But Stoiber can't
fix it. The Social Democrats can. Iraq was a huge issue.... Germans
don't want to be dragged into any more wars. [President] Bush wants
war too quickly for us. I think he wants one to fix his own economy."</TE>
<TE>   Outside party headquarters, hundreds of Social Democrats huddled
under umbrellas as a steady rain fell on crowds gathered around
outdoor TV screens. Party workers inside leaned over glass railings
and tried to stay confident as predictions showed Schroeder and the
Social Democrats creeping toward victory.</TE>
<TE>   The clear winners of the evening were the Greens, whose push for
greater environmental protection gained credence this summer when
devastating floods swept along the 700-mile length of the Elbe River,
inflicting at least $15 billion in damage. The weeks of deluge wiped
out much of the post-reunification improvements in eastern Germany,
hitting the baroque monuments of Dresden so hard that many likened
the destruction to the city's flattening under World War II Allied
bombing. The Greens' 8.6% of the vote was nearly 2 percentage points
higher than their 1998 showing.</TE>
<TE>   Stoiber's hopes for gaining the leadership in coalition with the
liberal Free Democrats collapsed with the smaller party's
disappointing results. Party Vice Chairman Juergen Moellemann had
reignited a strident debate over Israeli policy toward Palestinians
in the last few days of campaigning, provoking accusations from
Jewish leaders of anti-Semitism.</TE>
<TE>   Free Democratic leader Guido Westerwelle proclaimed the results "a
great disappointment" and lashed out at Moellemann for having damaged
the party's standing. The party leadership demanded that Moellemann
resign.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder's team also suffered a campaign casualty, with Justice
Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin announcing that she would leave the
Cabinet if the government won reelection to spare it further damage
from a remark she made comparing Bush's Iraq policy to diversionary
tactics used by Adolf Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   The Social Democratic stalwart insisted that she had been
misquoted, but party and government colleagues condemned her comments
as outrageous.</TE>
<TE>   "As a German, I don't like to see the crimes of Hitler trivialized
by such a comparison," Social Democratic lawmaker Volkmar Schultz
said of the justice minister's faux pas.</TE>
<TE>   Stoiber sought to cast the remark, made among a small group of
trade union officials in Daeubler-Gmelin's rural constituency, as
evidence of Schroeder's poor relations with the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   But voters seemed to discount the troubled relationship as the
cause of the Social Democrats' reduced share of the vote. Some
attributed the drop in support since the last election to public
disenchantment with the leadership's handling of domestic affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The Christian Democrats, who ruled for 16 years before Schroeder
defeated Helmut Kohl in 1998 elections, blamed the incumbent for
failing to loosen the chains on German employers so that more jobs
could be created and the economy given a boost by less regulation.
Schroeder made little dent in the more than 4 million unemployed in
Germany, and economic growth has been flat for the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   But the campaign was dominated in the last days by an emotional
clash between Berlin and Washington over Schroeder's reluctance to
back any U.S. attack on Iraq and by Daeubler-Gmelin's widely
publicized Hitler remark.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer called the justice minister's
statement "outrageous and inexplicable."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the recent strife was driven by the election campaign,
said Jackson Janes, head of the American Institute for Contemporary
German Studies at Johns Hopkins University, who was on hand for the
election. "But my sense is that there's going to be more of this
before there is less of it. It's going to be a while before things
settle down."</TE>
<TE>   Conservative voters were still grousing about the anti-American
theme of recent days even after it became clear that they had failed
to force a leadership change.</TE>
<TE>   "Schroeder has used Iraq for political reasons. He's played on
fear, and he did it very skillfully," said Jana Rosenmann, an
aerospace worker from Munich who was watching the results come in at
the conservatives' headquarters while sipping wine. "I was hoping
Stoiber would have hit Schroeder harder about damaging 50 years'
worth of American-German relations."</TE>
<TE>   Halfway through his beer and deep into his opinion on the
election, Gerhard Handke, managing director of the Federation of
German Wholesale and Foreign Trade, said he worried that Schroeder's
position on Iraq might have severe economic consequences. "The U.S.
is a very important trading partner. Why kick them?" Handke said.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Attack Would Focus on Leaders, Rumsfeld Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WARSAW</DL>
<LD>U.S. military forces are seeking to minimize the impact of a
potential war with Iraq on its citizens and would focus on the
country's leaders, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "The small group of people that run Iraq and have run it for a
good many years have repressed the people--and, in a very real sense,
the people of that country are hostages to a small group of
dictatorial, repressive government officials," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Rumsfeld arrived in Warsaw late Sunday for a meeting of defense
ministers from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He intended to
present his colleagues with classified intelligence information that,
he said, indicates that Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction
pose a threat both to neighboring countries and to NATO members,
including the United States.</LD>
<TE>   The threats are said to include either direct action by the Iraqi
leader or acts carried out by terrorist proxies; the White House has
repeatedly emphasized in recent weeks that there are Al Qaeda cells
in Iraq. Administration officials are seeking to craft a plan that
gives Iraqi civilians and even soldiers the chance to switch sides or
at least stand down if U.S. forces begin a military campaign, defense
officials have said.</TE>
<TE>   Former Iraqi military officials suggest that the tactic of trying
to enlist the Iraqi military might work. Najib Salhi, a former
general who left Iraq in 1995, said in a recent interview that if
U.S. forces encircled Iraq, regular army forces would abandon
Hussein--and even the elite Republican Guard would eventually stand
down.</TE>
<TE>   "They will not defend Saddam," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Consistent with that strategy, Rumsfeld said, any conflict would
not target Iraqi citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States hasn't and never had a problem or issue with
the Iraqi people. The Iraqi people have been punished on a daily
basis, just as their neighbors have been punished by the behavior of
their country," Rumsfeld told reporters on his plane en route to
Warsaw. "Obviously, no one would want to harm the people of that
country. We favor the people of that country."</TE>
<TE>   A White House spokesman acknowledged over the weekend that the
Pentagon has delivered to President Bush at least one plan for a
potential invasion of Iraq, crafted by U.S. Central Command chief
Gen. Tommy Franks. Invasion plans have drawn especially close
scrutiny since Bush sought the backing of both the United Nations and
Congress for measures that would clear the way for a military attack
on Iraq, although Rumsfeld has emphasized that such plans are drawn
up routinely.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's comments Sunday were consistent with weekend news
reports outlining U.S. war plans against Iraq, including quick
strikes against political and military centers of power in lieu of a
broader attack against the military rank and file.</TE>
<TE>   However, the secretary angrily dismissed those reports, saying:
"Anyone who knows anything isn't talking, and anyone with any sense
isn't talking. Therefore, the people that are talking to the media
are by definition people who don't know anything."</TE>
<TE>   Questioned about the reported plans on NBC's "Meet the Press,"
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said he concurred with the "quick strike" thinking but
urged that Iraqi opposition groups, including "the Kurds in the north
[and] the Shiites in the south," be "involved more significantly ...
because they're the ones that are going to, over time, have to take
over Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Other lawmakers suggested that the draft resolution sent by the
White House to Congress last week be restricted to cover just an
invasion of Iraq, instead of mandating the restoration of
"international peace and security in the region."</TE>
<TE>   "It's much too broad. There's no limit at all on presidential
powers," Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said on "Fox News Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles Hagel (R-Neb.), a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, predicted that the resolution would be approved
but agreed that there could be some changes in the language.</TE>
<TE>   "These are very, very important definitions, because [the
resolution] will guide the president and the nation, probably, into
war," Hagel said.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be tinkering around the edges, but the substance of it
will pass," Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), vice chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee, said on CBS' "Face the Nation."</TE>
<TE>   The resolution is expected to pass easily in the
Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Democrats control the
Senate by one vote. The Bush administration wants Congress to approve
the resolution before taking a break for the Nov. 5 midterm
elections.</TE>
<TE>   At the Warsaw meeting, U.S. officials plan to update a briefing
they gave NATO ambassadors in June on the connection among
terrorists, national governments and weapons of mass destruction,
Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be discussing the nexus between weapons of mass
destruction and terrorists and terrorist states and networks,
including Iraq, at this meeting," he said. "There is no question but
that we'll be giving a brief and the United States will be giving a
briefing ... that will focus very much on Iraq." But he added that he
will not be seeking support for the United Nations resolution while
in Warsaw.</TE>
<TE>   The American delegation also plans to propose a rapid-strike force
of up to 20,000 NATO soldiers who could deploy on a mission of
virtually any size--from a hostage rescue to full-scale war with a
well-equipped adversary such as North Korea--in one week to one
month. But asked if NATO might play a role in a war with Iraq,
Rumsfeld said: "I have no idea. It hasn't crossed my mind. We've not
proposed it."</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials' experience in crafting war plans for Iraq and
elsewhere has led them to redraw rules for contingencies, with a new
emphasis on speed.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines affect a broad range of plans that envision U.S.
military forces in conflicts in every region of the globe. Defense
officials did not disclose the classified details of contingency
guidelines but said they were designed to produce plans more rapidly
and to make them better reflect the conditions of a potential
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "We are significantly changing the process for contingency
planning," Rumsfeld told reporters. "The speed of the cycle for
contingency planning is going to be accelerated, and they are going
to be less stale and more current than they have been in the past,
which I think is critically important for this country."</TE>
<TE>   NATO members are also expected to talk about whether to alter the
group's command structure, how to follow through on a broad consensus
to expand their membership and how to deal with what alliance leaders
say is a decline in the group's ability to carry out its mission due
to shrinking defense budgets among many of its members.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BOUAKE, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>More than 100 American and other foreign children were trapped in
this rebel-held central city Sunday as government forces tried to
retake northern areas seized by renegade soldiers last week.</LD>
<LD>   The children, ranging from infants to 12-year-olds, attend a
boarding school in the city. They are the sons and daughters of
missionaries working across West Africa.</LD>
<LD>   "There has been artillery and mortar fire close to the school,
coming from a military camp," Michel Cousineau, business manager and
security officer at the International Christian Academy, said by
phone.</LD>
<TE>   A battle had been looming in the Bouake area, 220 miles north of
the commercial capital, Abidjan, since a coup attempt failed Thursday
and former soldiers seized the city. Thousands of angry civilians in
Bouake marched Sunday in support of coup forces.</TE>
<TE>   "We are armed to the teeth, and there is no going back," a rebel
commander known as Samsara 110 declared in another rebel-held city,
Korhogo, in the predominantly Muslim north.</TE>
<TE>   Ivory Coast's former colonial power, France, has about 500 troops
based in Abidjan and flew in two planeloads of reinforcements Sunday,
saying the move was a precaution to ensure the security of its
citizens and other Westerners. Ivory Coast said it had not asked for
French help to put down the uprising.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. urged Americans not to travel to Ivory Coast.</TE>

<HD>Indonesian Dies in Bomb Attempt at U.S. Facility</HD>

<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>An Indonesian man died early today while apparently trying to attack
an unoccupied U.S. Embassy warehouse with a hand grenade, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the grenade exploded in the man's car before he was
able to throw it out the window. The car veered off the street and
crashed into a utility pole outside the building in a residential
neighborhood, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The driver of the car, identified as Yusuf Hartual, was captured
with the help of local residents. A subsequent search of one of the
men's houses turned up two drums of TNT, pistols and ammunition,
authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   The attempted drive-by assault followed nearly two weeks of
warnings by U.S. officials of "specific and credible" terrorist
threats against the U.S. Embassy and American citizens in Indonesia.
It was unclear, however, whether the incident was connected to those
threats; police said both men were from Indonesia's Molucca Islands,
which have been torn by religious violence for nearly four years.</TE>
<TE>   Embassy officials declined to comment other than to say Indonesian
police were investigating.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta and the U.S. Consulate in the city of
Surabaya were closed for nearly a week this month after a top Al
Qaeda operative captured in Indonesia said terrorist cells planned to
attack U.S. facilities in Southeast Asia around the anniversary of
the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the U.S. government warned Americans not to go to the
central Javan city of Yogyakarta, a popular tourist destination,
because of a new "specific and credible" threat.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S, Singapore and Malaysia allege that Islamic extremists in
Indonesia are at the center of an international terrorist network
that has plotted to bomb U.S. targets in the region. Indonesian
authorities, however, have been slow to act, and some top officials
contend that there are no terrorists operating in the country.</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, the terror cells' actions are marked as much by
incompetence as success.</TE>
<TE>   Several bomb-makers have blown themselves up while making or
transporting explosives intended to destroy churches in Indonesia.
Another blew off his leg while carrying a bomb in a Jakarta shopping
mall. Reported plots to assassinate President Megawati Sukarnoputri
and blow up a U.S. warship in Surabaya's harbor have come to nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Police were unable to say why the grenade exploded in the car
during today's attempted attack about 3:30 a.m. outside the building
in central Jakarta, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Some police officials reported that the car had exploded, but
inspection of the vehicle showed damage consistent with a grenade
going off in the front passenger seat. Most of the damage was to the
door and flooring on the passenger side.</TE>
<TE>   The dead man was identified as Abdul Aziz. Two people riding in
the back seat escaped.</TE>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>The kidney of a Jewish teenager killed in a suicide bombing in Tel
Aviv last week has been transplanted into a Palestinian girl--saving
her life, officials said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Yasmin abu Ramila, 7, received the kidney of Jonathan Jesner, a
19-year-old student from Scotland who was on a Tel Aviv bus Thursday
when a Palestinian militant detonated his explosives.</LD>
<LD>   Five people were killed immediately. Jesner, who had postponed
medical school to attend a religious school in Israel, was critically
wounded and died a day later.</LD>
<TE>   Officials at Schneider Children's Hospital in the central Israeli
town of Petah Tikva said Sunday that Yasmin was in good condition
after Saturday's transplant.</TE>
<TE>   Jesner's family volunteered to donate his organs and placed no
restrictions on the choice of recipients. "We believed it was what he
would have wanted us to do," said his stepmother, who declined to be
named.</TE>
<TE>   His oldest brother, Ari Jesner, said after the transplant that the
recipient's religion or nationality was "unimportant."</TE>
<TE>   "The most important principle here is that life was given to
another human being," he said. "We are happy and delighted that
Yoni's memory will live on."</TE>
<TE>   Yasmin has a genetic disorder that leads to kidney failure and has
been treated in Jerusalem hospitals since she was an infant.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what to say to thank the family of the man killed in
the attack," the Maariv newspaper quoted Yasmin's mother, Rina, as
saying. "I grieve for their loss and thank them for their donation."</TE>

<HD>Assault on Arafat's Complex Halted, but Stalemate Persists</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The Bush administration says the siege won't stop
violence or promote reform. Some Israelis also question its wisdom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON and MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Inside the battered offices of Yasser Arafat, a deafening roar shook
the nerves and kept people awake. Outside, a brigade of armored
bulldozers, towering backhoes and giant jackhammers shoved debris and
reduced buildings to dust and rubble.</LD>
<LD>   With the Israeli siege of the Palestinian Authority president and
his headquarters in its third day Sunday, electricity, water and
phone lines to the building were cut, then partially restored. The
Israeli government and Arafat were locked in a stalemate: Israel
continued to demand the extradition of as many as 50 alleged
Palestinian "terrorists," while Arafat continued to refuse to
consider any such surrender.</LD>
<LD>   After dark Sunday, the army said it had ended its demolition of
Arafat's once-sprawling official compound, "for now." Every building
had been flattened, damaged or occupied, including the three-story
structure where Arafat sleeps and works. He and at least 200 aides,
bodyguards and others were there, all corralled into a few rooms,
according to the Israeli military commander in charge of the
operation.</LD>
<TE>   As Israelis debated the wisdom of the siege, and Palestinians
rallied to Arafat's defense, the Bush administration issued a rare
criticism of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "Israeli actions in and around the Muqata [Arafat's compound] are
not helpful in reducing terrorist violence or promoting Palestinian
reforms," White House spokeswoman Jeanie Mamo said in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "We urge Israel to continue considering the consequences of its
actions," Mamo said, adding that "high-level" contacts between the
White House and Israel had taken place in the days since a
Palestinian suicide bombing killed seven people in Tel Aviv and gave
way to the assault on Arafat's headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Other sources said Washington had succeeded in restraining Israel
from sending forces into Arafat's office; on Saturday, U.S. Secretary
of State Colin L. Powell telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon. But Israeli officials insisted that U.S. reaction had been
mild.</TE>
<TE>   At the compound Sunday afternoon, army officers said they would
keep up the pressure on Arafat and his associates until they handed
over the men wanted by Israel, including the head of Palestinian
intelligence for the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat would be hard pressed to comply. Turning over any
Palestinian fighter would be regarded as treachery by rank-and-file
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   For the 200 or so people inside the compound, life became still
more difficult Sunday when the phone lines and air conditioning were
cut. Running water, which was turned off Saturday, was restored
briefly in the morning, then turned off again. On Sunday afternoon,
two huge Caterpillar tractors with attached cranes lurched toward a
relatively unscathed section of building that adjoined Arafat's
offices. While one jackhammered holes in the walls, the other used a
giant claw as a battering ram, knocking away large chunks of wall and
then scooping up the debris. Within a couple of hours, only skeletal
remains were still standing.</TE>
<TE>   Later Sunday, a senior military officer briefing journalists
inside the compound, about 150 yards from where Arafat was trapped,
said the cutting of water, electricity and telephone lines was an
accident. He said that water and electricity would be restored and
that food packages of pita, yogurt and hummus were to be delivered
overnight.</TE>
<TE>   At least during the journalists' visit, the army had taken down an
Israeli flag that soldiers the day before dramatically hoisted over
the Palestinian Authority headquarters. The officer said that move
had been a "mistake" by an overly excited soldier.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat spent the day, as usual, on the telephone, consulting with
other leaders, mostly from the Arab world. Other Palestinian
officials joined in the diplomatic effort.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very, very dangerous situation," Salam Fayyad, the new
Palestinian finance minister, said by telephone from within the
compound.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing is going to be achieved by it ... ," he went on. "I just
don't see how acting in this fashion will bring us any closer to the
end we would all like to see. This is just not going to yield
anything other than misery--and I mean misery for all."</TE>
<TE>   Fayyad spent hours on his mobile phone talking to officials from
the United States and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   He was not alone in suggesting the futility of the siege. Israelis
too were wondering if this would be the final blow to end Arafat's
reign and Palestinian violence or if it would only fan the flames.</TE>
<TE>   Banner headlines in Israeli newspapers Sunday trumpeted a
purported statement by Sharon: "Arafat is finished."</TE>
<TE>   "We won't harm him, but he won't run the show," Justice Minister
Meir Sheetrit, from Sharon's Likud Party, said.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is no love lost for Arafat among ordinary Israelis,
support was not unanimously behind the military operation in
Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Some commentators said it was aimed at appeasing the hawkish
right, while others said that going after Arafat and not the top
leaders of radical Islamic groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad didn't
make sense.</TE>
<TE>   "How can we explain this bizarre fetish in which Arafat and the
Palestinian Authority serve as a sort of voodoo doll for Islamic
Jihad, Hamas and [the latter's spiritual founder] Sheik Yassin?"
asked satirist Doron Rosenblum in his regular column in the newspaper
Haaretz.</TE>
<TE>   "The latter take explicit responsibility for the attacks yet we
lash out again and again at the Muqata and at the figure we have
already metamorphosed into a scarecrow, because they are there,
because they're accessible and because we're used to doing so. What
will we do when we no longer have Arafat to boot around? Will we send
bulldozers to turn him over in his grave after every attack?"</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli siege has had the presumably unintended consequence of
rallying support for Arafat, even as it aimed to isolate him and,
ultimately, end his career.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's popularity had been ebbing among Palestinians, who saw
him as a largely ineffective figurehead presiding over a corrupt
administration. Less than two weeks ago, his Cabinet was forced to
resign to avoid a no-confidence vote in the Palestinian Legislative
Council.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians now see him once again hoisted onto the world stage,
once again playing the role of embattled freedom fighter refusing to
give in to overwhelming force. Large crowds took to the streets of
both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip late Saturday and again Sunday,
violating Israeli-imposed curfews, to rally in support of Arafat.
Israeli forces shot dead six people, the Palestinians said.</TE>

<HD>With Slim Margin, Slovakia's Premier Looks Set to Return</HD>
<DH>Elections: Four pro-Western coalition parties rally around
Mikulas Dzurinda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BRATISLAVA, Slovakia</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda appeared positioned to remain head of
a strongly pro-Western government after election results Sunday
showed four center-right parties winning a slim majority in
Slovakia's parliament.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders of the four parties, which together won 78 seats in the
150-seat parliament, generally rallied around Dzurinda on Sunday as
the obvious pick to lead the new government after his Slovak
Democratic Coalition did much better than expected.</LD>
<LD>   "You cannot ignore the will of the citizens," television magnate
Pavol Rusko, head of the New Citizen Alliance, one of the likely
coalition partners, said in throwing his support behind Dzurinda.</LD>
<TE>   Slovakia was formed out of the 1993 breakup of Czechoslovakia, and
its governments have generally been authoritarian-populist or
controlled by ideologically mixed coalitions of convenience.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's election results, however, indicate that Slovakia is now
poised to enter the European mainstream in its domestic politics as
it seeks membership in NATO and the European Union. All of that
should contribute to stability in Central Europe and strengthen
democracy in former communist states, observers say.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a greater chance to set up a fully unified government
than ever before," Dzurinda declared Sunday. That comment was seen as
an indication that Dzurinda intends to govern without the support of
Robert Fico's populist SMER party, which if brought into the
coalition would give it a more comfortable majority but also
introduce sharper policy and personality differences.</TE>
<TE>   Fico, who before the voting Friday and Saturday was seen as a
leading candidate for prime minister, appeared to recognize Sunday
that the opportunity had slipped away. "We'll have to decide whether
we'll go into opposition or come to some kind of agreement," Fico
said.</TE>
<TE>   While Fico's disappointment was obvious, he sought to put the best
face on the showing by his relatively new party, which will enter
parliament for the first time. "I think there's an idea we're
crying," Fico said. "But we started several years ago from zero. It's
a good result. I cannot say it's absolute failure. I cannot say it's
a success."</TE>
<TE>   Former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia placed first with 19.5% of the vote and 36 seats. But Meciar
lacks potential coalition allies and is seen as having little chance
of forming part of the government, prompting protests from party
officials. "The winners of the election should not be shunted aside,"
complained Jan Kovarcik, deputy chairman of the party.</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats had warned Slovak voters before the election
that if Meciar were to return to power, Slovakia's bid to enter the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization would be blocked. Meciar's
heavy-handed rule in the mid- 1990s badly strained Slovakia's ties
with both the United States and the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   The election results clear the path for Slovakia to be among as
many as seven nations expected to receive NATO membership invitations
at a November summit in the Czech Republic. Slovakia's chances of
being part of an eastward expansion of the EU in 2004 or 2005 are
also greatly strengthened.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Ambassador to Slovakia Ronald Weiser said Slovakia had voted
for "those who share the democratic values and principles of the
United States and of NATO."</TE>
<TE>   Dzurinda's party placed second to Meciar's party but first among
the expected coalition partners, winning 15.1% of the vote to take 28
seats.</TE>
<TE>   Fico's SMER, which had been expected to battle Meciar's party for
the top spot, placed third overall, with 13.5% of the vote and 25
seats.</TE>
<TE>   Meciar played a key role in promoting the peaceful division of
Czechoslovakia, and in Slovakia he is viewed by supporters as the
father of the country. But critics charge that he ran an
authoritarian political machine based on patronage, corruption and
disrespect for democratic rules.</TE>

<DL>SANA, Yemen</DL>
<LD>A member of Yemen's parliament accused the government Sunday of
illegally holding 104 people on suspicion of links to terrorism and
called for their immediate trial or release.</LD>
<LD>   Sultan Atwani, a member of a parliamentary panel looking into
alleged human rights violations by security forces in the crackdown
on supporters of Osama bin Laden, said a security official reported
that the suspects' continued detention was because of U.S. pressure.</LD>
<LD>   "The commission urged security officials to send the detainees for
trial or release them," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Of the 104 detainees, Atwani said, 15 were arrested in the bombing
of the U.S. destroyer Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden in 2000, which
killed 17 U.S. sailors.</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty International said in July that Yemen had violated human
rights during its anti-terrorism campaign. It said thousands had been
detained, including children, academics and journalists.</TE>

<HD>A New Season, New Drama: ABC's Struggle for Ratings</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Comic Jimmy Kimmel, ABC's anointed late-night answer to David
Letterman and Jay Leno, stood before a packed house of advertisers in
New York, trying to help the network win their dollars.</LD>
<LD>   Squeezed into the orchestra section on that May afternoon were
executives from Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC. Among them: Chairman
and Chief Executive Michael D. Eisner.</LD>
<LD>   Taking aim, Kimmel noted that not only had the bosses given him a
program, but they also were reviving the old cop show "Dragnet."</LD>
<TE>   "This is the plan to resurrect the network? 'Dragnet' and me?"
Kimmel asked. "Are you guys trying to get fired? You'll be out
scalping tickets to 'The Lion King.' "</TE>
<TE>   Sure, he was joking, but not everyone was laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Rarely has a single season meant so much to a company and its top
executives. Television's cliffhanger drama this season, which
officially begins Monday, isn't whether President Josiah Bartlet is
reelected on NBC's "The West Wing" but whether Eisner and his crew
can break ABC's fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously," Disney President Robert Iger said, "this is a huge
priority for the company."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, ABC's prime-time ratings tumbled more than 20%. The
network finished a distant third to NBC and CBS and came in fourth in
viewers ages 18 to 49, the group most coveted by advertisers. Ratings
eroded so badly that the network finished the season with only one
top-20 show, "Monday Night Football." Programming chief Stu Bloomberg
was sacked.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday night, as if to punctuate ABC's dismal season, the
network did not win one Emmy out of the meager eight nominations it
received in the high-profile categories.</TE>
<TE>   If ABC were Disney's only headache, much less would be on the
line. The network accounts for only 15 cents out of every $1 of
revenue taken in by Disney. But investors and analysts see ABC's
struggles as symptomatic of larger problems that Eisner has been
unable to fix.</TE>
<TE>   Its theme parks have suffered from a soft economy and tourism
declines since last year's terrorist attacks. Its animated film
division no longer dominates the genre. Disney merchandise doesn't
sell the way it did a decade ago. Its stock is near an eight-year
low.</TE>
<TE>   Another ABC debacle, media analysts contend, could tarnish
Eisner's 18-year legacy at the company and undermine the confidence
of a board of directors that has long been in his corner. On Tuesday,
those directors are scheduled to meet with Eisner, and ABC probably
will be on their minds.</TE>
<TE>   With so much at stake, virtually every realm of the Disney empire
has been called into action.</TE>
<TE>   "It's basically a pull-out-all-the-stops approach," said Iger, the
point man for the network rescue.</TE>
<TE>   The last few weeks have been like a ride on Disneyland's Space
Mountain for everyone involved in overseeing, marketing, writing and
producing the fall schedule. There's been everything from fine-tuning
to overhauling.</TE>
<TE>   Plot lines have changed, scripts have been rewritten. "The Drew
Carey Show" was told to develop deeper relationships between
characters and dump some of the stunts. ABC executives have jumped in
to help producers of the new medical drama "MDs" strike a lighter
tone.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner, keenly aware of the importance of the network's greatest
hope for ratings success--"8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage
Daughter"--sent a note to the producers recommending that a scene be
shortened. It was.</TE>
<TE>   John Ritter, the show's star and a veteran of previous ABC
regimes, knows the brass is counting on him. "Michael Eisner is in my
dressing room right now, waiting to give me a deep tissue massage,"
Ritter deadpanned during a break in shooting Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, ABC was still calling in reinforcements. A
headhunter for the network tracked down veteran marketing whiz Steve
Sohmer dining with his 9-year-old son in Venice, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "They asked me if I would be interested in a new challenge in
television," said Sohmer, who helped launch "The Cosby Show" and the
revival of NBC in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   When he arrived at Disney's Burbank compound in August, he knew
the vacation was over. "The train hadn't left the station," Sohmer
said of the new season, "but it was certainly in motion."</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, he slashed from 32 to two the number of
executives who get daily reels of promotional spots. So many people
offering suggestions, he said, was "crippling the creative process."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's "Dinotopia," a computer animated/live action
prehistoric drama that costs $3 million per episode. ABC executives
recently leaned on the producers to make the show more hip by
creating Le Sage, a sexy, evil flirt.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm too old for this kind of stuff," sighed "Dinotopia" producer
Robert Halmi Sr., 78. "But it doesn't hurt the series."</TE>
<TE>   Now if it could get on the air.</TE>
<TE>   Although ABC executives told advertisers the show would be ready
for a fall launch, they underestimated the time it would take to
make. Despite a summer scramble, the program's premiere has been
pushed back to Thanksgiving, one day after the end of the
all-important November sweeps.</TE>
<TE>   While all this was unfolding behind the scenes, Disney has turned
its marketing machine loose on the public to snare viewers.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, McDonald's restaurants started featuring placemats with
trivia questions about such ABC shows as "8 Simple Rules." One
sample: "Tonight, Paul [John Ritter] has trouble with A) His dog B)
His teenage daughters C) His mother. (Hint: What's the name of the
show?)"</TE>
<TE>   Ads for ABC programs such as "Alias" appear behind home plate at
Edison International Field as Disney's Anaheim Angels fight for a
playoff spot. Employees sport ABC antenna balls on their cars.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, at Disney's California Adventure theme park, the stars
of ABC's new and returning shows were put on display. There were
question-and-answer sessions with the public, as well as a parade.</TE>
<TE>   "NYPD Blue" star Dennis Franz said he got to ride in the front
seat of the park's roller coaster with co-star Austin Majors, who
plays his son Theo.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can help them, it helps all of us," Franz said. "I've
become an ABC Mouseketeer."</TE>
<TE>   Eisner was on hand too. Sitting in a director's chair near the
park's Paradise Bay, he said he is optimistic about the season but
added: "Whether it actually coalesces to be the major turnaround of
all time or just a slight improvement, we don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Eisner's cautious words stand in contrast to seasons past, when
Disney executives promised success but delivered disappointment. Now
they are using phrases such as "stop the downward trend" and "start
moving the needle upward."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for Disney, remaking a network has never been
harder.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure that you can turn around a network with a couple of
shows," said Grant Tinker, who led NBC from third place to first in
the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, Tinker said, "it was a lot cleaner. There were
essentially three networks and those rules held hard and fast."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the TV universe has expanded vastly beyond NBC, CBS and
ABC.</TE>
<TE>   There are now six sizable broadcast networks, along with dozens of
cable channels and scores of other choices as satellite technology
proliferates. About 40% of all homes have three or more TV sets,
compared with just one in 10 about 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "In this world of shrinking audience, it's a tough game to get
back into it," said Tim Spengler, director of national broadcast for
ad buyer Initiative Media.</TE>
<TE>   Disney came up with a winning strategy last week. The network
began its season early by putting its most promising programs on
Tuesday nights, when the competition was mostly airing reruns. The
results exceeded even its own expectations.</TE>
<TE>   According to Nielsen Media Research, 17.2 million viewers watched
"8 Simple Rules" and more than 16 million tuned in to "Life With
Bonnie."</TE>
<TE>   "There had been so much talk around town that with our lower
audience this summer we wouldn't even get out of the box," ABC
Entertainment President Susan Lyne said. Added her boss, Iger: "We
proved them wrong in one night."</TE>
<TE>   The strategy could have backfired. Had the shows flopped, ABC
risked having its entire season declared dead on arrival.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to give them a lot of credit," NBC Entertainment
President Jeff Zucker said. "ABC had a very good night."</TE>
<TE>   But this week marks the real test, when all of the other networks
weigh in with new shows and fresh episodes of proven hits, such as
"Friends," "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" and the "Law and Order"
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "ABC has a good schedule, but the problem is they have enormous
competition wherever they are," said Jay Sures, co-head of United
Talent Agency's television unit.</TE>
<TE>   ABC has chosen to compete through a novel scheduling gimmick born
of necessity. They call it "Happy Hour"--a Monday-through-Friday
block of comedy and family shows airing from 8 to 9 p.m. That's when
ABC thinks its rivals are most vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone starts on equal footing at 8 p.m.," Lyne said. "We need
to create some chips, some building blocks so that we can launch
midseason shows, shows in the summer and next season's shows."</TE>
<TE>   ABC's strategic choices were limited because the network did not
have any hit series to use as springboards to develop other
successful shows. That has been the key to NBC's success on Thursday
nights with its "Must See TV" lineup of "Friends," "Will &amp; Grace" and
"ER." Meanwhile, CBS used the popular "Survivor" series to launch
"CSI."</TE>
<TE>   Still, with Disney placing every aspect of ABC's prime-time
programming under the microscope, even the name "Happy Hour" had a
rough go. The brainchild of advertising agency Leo Burnett Worldwide
Inc., the moniker stirred up debate because of the cultural
association with cheap drinks. In the end, the scales tipped in favor
of "Happy Hour."</TE>
<TE>   "Happy Hour really spoke to what we were trying to do," Lyne said.
"This is an entertaining hour, where you can just sit back, have
fun--where you don't have to work."</TE>
<TE>   Lyne said Disney also wanted to capitalize on its marketing
partnership with McDonald's, home of the Happy Meal. In fact, the two
companies share the same ad agency.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a long season, and we need to keep up the pressure to
make sure the episodes are really strong, well written, and to make
sure the marketing efforts don't peter out," Lyne said. "We need to
be vigilant."</TE>
<TE>   Any improvement at all for ABC is likely to help Eisner, at least
in the near term.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. projects a $410-million operating loss for the
network this fiscal year. ABC is weighed down by expensive sports
contracts, including the National Basketball Assn. and the National
Football League.</TE>
<TE>   Investors and analysts argue that the company needs to show it is
at least stopping ABC's bleeding in prime time.</TE>
<TE>   Said Prudential Securities analyst Katherine Styponias: "Investors
will be looking for marginal improvement at a minimum."</TE>

<HD>Davis to Sign Bill Allowing Paid Family Leave</HD>
<DH>Benefits: Measure grants most workers time off to care for
a new child or sick family members. Supporters see it as a model for
the nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGG JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis has decided to sign legislation allowing most
California workers to take paid leave after the birth or adoption of
a child or to care for sick family members, administration officials
said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Davis will sign the measure today at UCLA Medical Center in Los
Angeles, officials said, capping one of the most closely watched
issues of the legislative session and making California the first
state to enact a comprehensive paid family leave program. The bill is
seen by supporters as a model for the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Under the measure, which was written by Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa
Monica), most workers will be paid about 55% of their salary for six
weeks of leave for a new child or sick relative. The program will
expand the state fund providing insurance for disabled workers but
will be funded entirely by employee payroll deductions, averaging
about $26 a year. About 13 million of California's 16 million workers
would be eligible.</LD>
<TE>   Labor unions and women's groups across the country hailed the
Democratic governor's decision to make California the first state to
enact a comprehensive paid family leave program.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tremendous victory," said Karen Nussbaum, assistant to
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney in Washington, D.C., and an activist
involved in the fight for paid family leave for more than 20 years.
"It was a huge effort on the part of the labor movement."</TE>
<TE>   Business groups denounced the governor's decision.</TE>
<TE>   The California Chamber of Commerce led a coalition of groups that
tried unsuccessfully to kill the Kuehl bill in the California
Legislature. The groups have described it as one of the most
economically damaging pieces of legislation on the governor's desk.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge disappointment to us that the governor would even
consider signing it," Julianne Broyles, a lobbyist for the California
Chamber of Commerce in Sacramento, said Sunday. "California
businesses will be at a competitive disadvantage because of this, and
[Davis] doesn't seem to care."</TE>
<TE>   In reaching his decision, Davis "weighed all the options of taking
such a great step, but when it came right down to it, he believes in
putting family first," said press secretary Steven Maviglio.</TE>
<TE>   During the final legislative wrangling over SB 1661 in August,
Kuehl said, she agreed to the governor's suggestions to scale back
the bill's impact on businesses. She shortened the leaves to six
weeks from 12 and shifted the expense entirely to workers rather than
have employers and employees split the costs.</TE>
<TE>   Those changes haven't satisfied the California Chamber of Commerce
and other opponents, who contend that any form of paid leave will be
a costly blow to businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "Paid family leave is one of the worst bills for employers in the
2001-02 legislative session," said Broyles. "This bill fails
miserably to address the real cost concerns of employers--the costs
of replacement workers and additional overtime to cover for absent
workers, training costs and loss of productivity."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters, however, said business groups have voiced similar
concerns about virtually every labor benefit on the books today,
ranging from the minimum wage to workers' compensation payments for
job-related injuries. They said paid leave will result in happier,
more focused workers who might otherwise be forced to quit their jobs
because of family emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   "We as a nation love to talk about ourselves as a family-friendly
nation, but when it comes to having the policies in place to live up
to that we often fall short," said Judith Lichtman, president of the
National Partnership for Women and Children, a Washington-based
advocacy group involved in the nationwide battle over paid family
leave. "This is a really powerful statement on behalf of California
workers who need to take time off to care for loved ones but can't
afford to take leave when their families need them the most."</TE>
<TE>   In a legislative year that has seen the California Labor
Federation shepherd more than 20 bills to the governor's desk, paid
family leave was a top priority for the state's largest labor group.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, in terms of family legislation, I think it's far and
away the most significant bill [Davis] has signed," said Tom Rankin,
president of the California Labor Federation. "It's a program whose
time has come. Actually, it came a while back."</TE>
<TE>   Under the Kuehl bill, only workers who pay into the state
disability insurance system would be eligible for the paid family
leaves. State government employees are exempted from that system
because California covers them under a self-insured program. Payroll
deductions for eligible workers--ranging up to $70 a year for people
earning more than $72,000 a year--would begin in January 2004.
Workers would be allowed to start taking paid leaves as of July 1,
2004. The maximum payment will be $728 a week, and the payments will
not be taxed.</TE>
<TE>   Workers will only be allowed to take leaves to bond with a new
child--whether by birth, adoption or foster care--or to take care of
a sick child, spouse or domestic partner, parent or, in some cases,
grandparent.</TE>
<TE>   Financial and administrative details remain to be worked out.
Business groups predict worker deductions will have to be much higher
to support the program.</TE>
<TE>   Pam Haynes, a lobbyist for the California Labor Federation who
worked on the issue in the Legislature, said the benefits for
Californians far outweigh the costs or outstanding questions.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a labor of love," she said. "I'm so excited that
California workers are finally going to be able to take the time they
need to be with their families."</TE>
<TE>   California marks the first victory for the AFL-CIO and its allies
in a growing national campaign for paid family leave, unfolding in
state legislatures nationwide. Measures similar to the California
bill have been introduced in nearly 30 statehouses over the last two
years, but none has been signed into law, supporters say.</TE>
<TE>   Labor and advocacy groups are planning to parlay their California
success into legislative victories in other states.</TE>
<TE>   "Advocates can go to other states and make the case that if a
state as concerned as California was about balancing its budget can
do this, other states can do it as well," said Nussbaum. "The ability
to take time off when your family really needs you is so meaningful
that I never found it easier to ask people to weigh in, to make phone
calls to put this one over the edge. But the employer community
fought this one very, very hard."</TE>
<TE>   The United States is one of the few industrialized nations in the
world that doesn't offer workers paid leave for the birth or adoption
of a child or illness of family members. Labor unions, women's
organizations and other advocacy groups have been pushing for the
proposal for more than 20 years, with little to show for their
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Six states now offer modest paid family leave programs, adopted in
the 1960s and 1970s and funded through unemployment insurance or
temporary disability insurance payroll deductions. A few states allow
employees to use personal sick leave to care for family members, and
some private employers offer paid family leave as an employment
benefit.</TE>
<TE>   The California measure builds on a 1993 law--a Clinton
administration initiative--that guarantees the jobs of workers who
take unpaid leave to bond with a new child or care for a sick family
member. That law exempts companies with 50 or fewer employees by
allowing them to replace a worker who takes a family-related leave.</TE>
<TE>   Not all businesses oppose paid family leave.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott Hoffman, co-founder of Just Desserts in Oakland, said that
his company instituted company-paid family leave after the birth of
his son 22 years ago. The benefit has helped him maintain a loyal and
motivated work force, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If family and family values, if you will, are truly an important
value in this country, to me this is a no-risk bill," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Labor unions and other paid family leave advocates said support
for the idea is growing as more families with two working parents are
torn by their inability to take time off to care for sick children or
parents.</TE>
<TE>   "People are finally seeing the real need to do something about
it," Rankin said. "Obviously the politicians are following the people
here."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Bruce McPherson (R-Santa Cruz) and other opponents of the
California measure said they fear that labor groups will try to shift
paid-leave costs to employers in the future--something they said many
companies can't afford.</TE>
<TE>   That isn't the immediate goal of the California labor movement,
but cost-sharing for paid family leaves is the long-term goal, Rankin
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a crucial program," he said. "It's worth it for employees to
have this kind of insurance, even if we couldn't get employers to put
up their fair share. That's not unusual in our society, but it's
outrageous."</TE>

<HD>Lopez Builds Bridges Between Police and Communities</HD>
<DH>LAPD: The easygoing head of Oxnard's force, a former Los

<LD>As he makes his pitch to head the Los Angeles Police Department, Art
Lopez argues against history: He contends that his affability, his
willingness to listen to civilians and his record of reaching out to
those who distrust the police qualify him best to take over an
organization long renowned for its insularity and independence.</LD>
<LD>   It's time to change that, Lopez says. And making allies, even of
potential enemies, is the forte of the 52-year-old Oxnard police
chief, who last week surprised even himself by making the short list
of finalists for police chief in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez says he knows how to get along with people, and how to
listen to his superiors. And he thinks those characteristics might
work for him when he interviews this morning with Los Angeles Mayor
James K. Hahn.</LD>
<TE>   "When I was hired in Oxnard, the city manager said he chose me
because he felt most comfortable with me," Lopez said. "I think
that's what Mayor Hahn is going to look for too. I'm going to listen
to my civilian bosses. I'm not going to try to steal the limelight
from anybody. We'll share in the success."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the five-member civilian Los Angeles Police
Commission, all mayoral appointees, recommended that Hahn consider
Lopez for police chief, along with higher-profile finalists William
Bratton and John Timoney, former police commissioners in New York
City and Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the dark horse guy," Lopez said in an interview Saturday.
"I came in under the radar for a long time, while the candidates
within the [LAPD] were killing each other off."</TE>
<TE>   The new chief will replace Bernard Parks, whom Hahn earlier this
year denied a second five-year term. And if Parks represents a style
of chief with whom Hahn was uncomfortable, Lopez offers a clear
alternative.</TE>
<TE>   Where Parks was forceful, Lopez is easygoing. Where Parks battled
with some members of the city's civilian leadership, Lopez promises a
gentler approach. And where Parks used to boast of his record for
forcing out bad cops--at the LAPD, he once famously proclaimed,
officials "discipline too many and fire too few"--Lopez in his four
years as Oxnard's chief has not fired a single officer for
misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Oxnard officers, Lopez includes community
activists, some LAPD officers and even some police critics among his
supporters. Skeptics include some longtime LAPD leaders, who question
his depth, and former Mayor Richard Riordan, who passed over Lopez in
favor of Parks.</TE>
<TE>   The low-key Lopez, a calm and orderly executive with a knack for
turning hostile community meetings around, said he is not troubled by
criticism nor by his rivals' credentials.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez added that he planned to arrive for his interview with Hahn
today ready to make his case for how to turn around the department.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine," said Lopez, who worked 28 years as a Los Angeles cop
before moving to Oxnard four years ago, "the reward of being part of
the fix of the LAPD."</TE>
<TE>   One key goal, he said, is putting the department in touch with Los
Angeles' ethnically diverse communities. The Rampart scandal, he
said, revealed not only the crimes some officers will commit to jail
youth gang members, but also how little trust at least one poor
Latino neighborhood, Pico Union, had in its police.</TE>
<TE>   "There had been a total disconnect between the Police Department
and that community," Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so important for the next police chief to rebuild those
bridges. And that's what I do best."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said his steady ascent through the ranks of the
LAPD--starting as a patrolman in 1971 and eventually including the
command of Hollenbeck Station and Central Bureau before ending as a
deputy chief shortly before he left for Oxnard in 1998--prepares him
to run the demoralized department of 9,000 officers.</TE>
<TE>   But others say Lopez is a good guy whose ambitions overreach his
abilities--a lesser light, especially compared with Bratton and
Timoney.</TE>
<TE>   William Rathburn, former deputy chief of the LAPD, said Lopez's
four years atop the 200-officer Oxnard department do not qualify him
to run the far larger and more complicated LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard's entire police department is smaller than a single LAPD
station, of which there are 18, in addition to a host of special
units. LAPD pioneered SWAT teams--which include negotiators and
marksmen--and it fields canine and mounted operations, as well as
gang enforcement, narcotics and other specialized groups of officers.</TE>
<TE>   As the nation's third-largest police force, the LAPD also labors
under complex administrative requirements, including the presence of
a federal judge and monitor who oversee a consent decree adopted
under Riordan and despite Riordan's reservations.</TE>
<TE>   "Art is a nice guy," Rathburn said. "[But] I don't think Art has
the capabilities that are required for the job.... You could be a
success in Oxnard but not a success in Los Angeles. It requires a
different mentality, the ability to recognize problems, very strong
leadership characteristics."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez was not even the strongest candidate available from current
or former LAPD deputy chiefs, Rathburn said.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, who selected Parks as chief in 1997, when Lopez was also
a candidate, said LAPD insiders tell him a vote for Lopez would be a
vote for the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan cautioned against selecting Lopez if the reason is to
please Latino residents, who make up the largest racial or ethnic
share of the city's population. If selected, Lopez would be city's
first Latino police chief.</TE>
<TE>   "Art's a good guy, and a very competent guy," Riordan said. "But
if [Hahn] wants to get reelected, he needs a really good police
chief, and forget the political correctness. That'll get worn thin.
If I had to bet, I'd pick Timoney."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said his selection would be a boost to Latinos, but that his
ethnicity should not be a principal consideration when picking a
chief.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of pride about this," Lopez said Friday, shortly
after a reporter from a third Spanish-language television station
interviewed him. "Believe me, we're going to have a lot of support
out there from the Latino community. And it may be important for some
of the people because I'd become an instant role model. But I agree
with Mayor Hahn that they should be seeking the most qualified
individual."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say that's Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   "What this city needs is a chief of police who is not another
politician or would-be politician," said Ron Frankle, a former LAPD
deputy chief who mentored Lopez before retiring in 1996. "They need a
good, solid, affable general manager, and he fits that description
very well."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's two top law enforcement officers said Lopez is a
worthy finalist.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Mayor Hahn that they can't do any better than Art Lopez,"
said Ventura Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury. He said Lopez had
introduced new crime-fighting ideas to the suburban county. Lopez,
for instance, brought two LAPD experts on the Rampart scandal to
Ventura to share its lessons.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Sheriff Bob Brooks, who met regularly with Lopez on
a police chiefs' panel, said Lopez also distinguished himself by
establishing four community advisory boards for different parts of
Oxnard and a "chief's council" of racial and ethnic leaders, with
which he meets regularly to feel the pulse of the working-class city
of 182,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   Those relations were tested during Lopez's tenure by a string of
police shootings that touched off fear and anger in the community.
Over eight months, Oxnard police shot and killed five men, most of
them mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   The last was the fatal shooting of a distraught, knife-wielding
23-year-old artist killed while cowering in his own bedroom closet
after his mother called police to take him to a hospital for
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   All of the shootings were ruled justified by county prosecutors,
but Lopez ordered more training for his officers on how to calm
emotionally disturbed suspects.</TE>
<TE>   So far, 24 officers have undergone weeklong training classes, and
every officer in the Oxnard department has received an eight-hour
course, Lopez said. Oxnard also is using a new crisis intervention
team and, in the last year, officers have shot just one crime
suspect, and he survived.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney Samuel Paz, who specializes in police
brutality cases, dealt with Lopez in two questionable Los Angeles
police shootings in the 1990s, and represents the mother of the
artist Oxnard police killed last year. Paz said Lopez should have
acted more quickly in response to the Oxnard shootings.</TE>
<TE>   But in general, he said, Lopez has been responsive to residents
and has enacted reforms that will save lives in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Paz recalled a San Pedro case a few years ago in which it appeared
that a young man had been shot in the back by Los Angeles police.
Lopez rolled out to the scene to calm the community, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The public was very upset with the LAPD," Paz said. "Lopez was
very caring in addressing their concerns, but he also protected the
integrity of the department. He comes across as being a sincere
person who demands respect, not based on his size or a scowl, but
because he expresses himself in a very articulate way that doesn't
set people off."</TE>
<TE>   Community leaders say Lopez has brought that same personal
connection to his work in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   "He's responded whenever we've come forward with complaints," said
Hank Lacayo, board president of El Concilio del Condado de Ventura,
the county's biggest Latino advocacy group. "I see a difference in
the demeanor of the Oxnard P.D. There are more attempts to reach
out."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez came to an Oxnard department with a history of excessive
force complaints. Within days, he sat down with Sgt. Steven Moore,
then president of the officers' union, to emphasize discipline.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been strict but fair," Moore said. "He's handed out some
discipline, but I don't know anybody who has found it unjust."</TE>
<TE>   Although police disciplinary records at Oxnard are not public,
Moore said Lopez has not fired any officers, though he has handed
down at least one 30-day suspension. That record would make Lopez a
light touch by recent LAPD standards, but officers in Oxnard view him
as at least as tough as his predecessor there.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said he left the LAPD for Oxnard in 1998 with no intention
of returning. But if he does, Lopez's journey would bring him home to
a city he never really left.</TE>
<TE>   The son of two Lockheed employees--his dad was a plastics
fabricator and his mom a parts sorter--Lopez was raised in a
bilingual middle-class home in Monterey Park, a third-generation
Mexican-American. He's married and has two college-age daughters--a
law school student at USC and a master's degree candidate at
Pepperdine.</TE>
<TE>   He lives in an Oxnard condo weekdays, and commutes home to Porter
Ranch in the San Fernando Valley on weekends, so he's always kept a
foothold in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He says that's not because he was planning a return to the LAPD as
chief--he figured Parks would be there for at least 10 years--but
because he truly likes the city.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I want to be back in the worst way," Lopez said. "Everything
I am today is the result of my experience with the Los Angeles Police
Department. I still bleed blue. I never really left the LAPD."</TE>

<LD>R.H. Donnelley Corp., a yellow page marketer widely acknowledged to
have published the first U.S. telephone directory, returned to its
roots by agreeing to purchase Sprint Corp.'s phone book business for
$2.23 billion in cash.</LD>
<LD>   The transaction would create the largest publicly traded phone
book publisher, with more than 260 white and yellow page directories
distributed to 18 million customers in 18 states.</LD>
<LD>   It also would provide some additional financial breathing room for
Sprint, which placed its directory operation on the auction block
four months ago to help pare down more than $20 billion in debt.</LD>

<LD>In place of protesters' angry shouts, parishioners at Boston's
Cathedral of the Holy Cross were confronted with dozens of pictures
of young children allegedly abused by priests.</LD>
<LD>   About 65 picketers lined up in silence, backs to the cathedral, to
launch a new, more peaceful phase of their campaign meant to drive
Cardinal Bernard Law from his post. It was the largest protest at the
cathedral, the seat of the Archdiocese of Boston, in months.</LD>
<LD>   The silent observance was intended to address concerns that the
weekly demonstrations had become too confrontational.</LD>
<TE>   Picketers have become a weekly sight outside of the cathedral
since January, when published reports revealed the archdiocese had
transferred priests accused of child abuse from parish to parish.</TE>

<LD>A measure on the November ballot would let defendants tell juries
they can disregard a law if they don't like it--a prospect that has
the legal profession aghast.</LD>
<LD>   Amendment A would let people accused of crimes argue that a law
should not apply to their circumstances or that is has no merit.</LD>
<LD>   Jury nullification is not a new concept: Juries refused to convict
people who harbored runaway slaves before the Civil War or resisted
the draft during the Vietnam War. But according to legal experts, no

<LD>Current plans for the nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain do
not include enough space to hold all of the liquid radioactive waste
to be produced by the federal government, according to an Energy
Department official.</LD>
<LD>   New estimates mean that an expansion of the planned site, or
construction of a second Yucca facility, will be needed to hold all
defense and energy wastes to be converted for storage by 2035, Joe

<HD>A Jolt of Java May Help Fund Seattle Child Care</HD>
<DH>Coffee: If voters agree, espresso would cost an extra dime.
Think tank says tax would generate up to $10 million a year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The idea came at the end of a long, frustrating brown-bag session at
a public-policy think tank here.</LD>
<LD>   The challenge was to save the city's child-care programs. Staring
into his empty coffee cup, the meeting coordinator's mind landed on
an unlikely solution: Put a tax--just a "benign" dime a shot--on
espresso.</LD>
<LD>   That led to a petition signed by more than 20,000 Seattle
residents, and next year, voters will decide whether the tax becomes
law, one that taps right into Seattle's legendary addiction to
coffee.</LD>
<TE>   This is, after all, the town where Starbucks was born and where
the $12 pound of beans became a staple. There is one Starbucks for
every 7,000 residents in Seattle, compared to one per 64,000 in New
York. Seattle also has two other major coffee chains, Tully's Coffee
and Seattle's Best Coffee, as well as countless cafes and espresso
carts.</TE>
<TE>   A recent poll showed that 74% of Seattle residents would vote for
the tax. "For people outside of Seattle who don't understand the
consumption of espresso, [the tax proposal] can be seen as crazy,"
said John Burbank, the think tank's executive director, "but it was
common sense."</TE>
<TE>   Research by his nonprofit Economic Opportunity Institute showed
that people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso.
But because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax
on espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million
a year. City Council aides dispute his figures, saying their research
shows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank's institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. The
think tank's mission is to promote public policy in the interests of
low-income people, and it has long championed child-care issues.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child-care programs
made earlier this year by Gov. Gary Locke. He also says it would
provide more low-income families with subsidies for child care,
improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries.</TE>
<TE>   At Bauhaus Books &amp; Coffee, the sidewalk is dotted with tables of
customers for whom coffee is a half-day activity, not just a drink.</TE>
<TE>   Espresso lovers like Chris Altman, who at a dime a day would spend
an extra $36.50 a year, said the investment is worth it. "I'm OK with
it," said the 35-year-old, stirring his iced latte. "The money's got
to come from somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Hope Revuelto, 25, was cooling her regular coffee ($1 because she
brought her own mug) and reading "Zen and the Art of Pottery." She
supports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be
expected of espresso drinkers: They want the most expensive thing on
the menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy.</TE>
<TE>   Some say the tax isn't the issue; they just resent being singled
out.</TE>
<TE>   David Marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos a
day, which means he'd be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. "I,
for one, don't have kids, but I drink espresso," he said, as he sewed
a leather collar onto a chain-mail tunic. "I don't mind paying, but I
think everyone should pay."</TE>
<TE>   Coffeehouses are steamed about it, and they've organized as
JOLT--Joined to Oppose the Latte Tax. Among the members are Seattle's
Chamber of Commerce and the city's two largest coffee franchises,
Starbucks and Tully's.</TE>
<TE>   The tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage
that contains espresso, a task that could be an administrative
nightmare for smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning
rush. If espresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners
could face a city audit.</TE>
<TE>   University of Chicago economics professor Michael Greenstone said
the tax doesn't add up.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this
is neither," he said. "On the efficiency side, it's surely going to
lead to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways
to avoid the tax. For example, Starbucks could claim that they are
using finely ground coffee, [instead of coffee run though an espresso
maker] and that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. Would
they be right? I don't know, but finding out will surely take lots of
legal fees that could have gone to child care.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, from a public-relations perspective, this is an
ingenious idea, and I mean that in a cynical way. They've pitted
espresso drinkers against child-care supporters, and who's going to
side with the espresso drinkers?"</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political
two-step, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their
public stance of political correctness. In a liberal city like
Seattle, corporations continually advertise their commitment to
social activism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, JOLT
members prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child
care.</TE>
<TE>   "Starbucks will continue to support early-learning and
childhood-development programs through the millions of dollars we
contribute annually," the company said. "However, Starbucks does not
understand why the Economic Opportunity Institute would recommend an
additional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other single
consumer product."</TE>
<TE>   The City Council has yet to decide when the initiative will go
before voters next year. The initiative's authors say it is directed
at vendors; critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through
higher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee.
The tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of
espresso, including decaf. Drip coffee would be exempt.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of
consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. So, he's been
pitching it as a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the needy get a
dime every time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso.</TE>
<TE>   It's the kind of political marketing that Fran Beulah, 43, finds
funny. "I drink espresso," she said, laughing, "and I am not rich."</TE>

<HD>Stage Set for Hawaii to Elect 1st Female Governor; Rep.
Mink Wins Primary</HD>

<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>Voters chose Lt. Gov. Mazie Hirono by a razor-thin margin to face
well-financed Republican Linda Lingle in November in a race to become
Hawaii's first female governor.</LD>
<LD>   And Democratic Rep. Patsy T. Mink won by a wide margin in
Saturday's primary to run for her 13th term.</LD>
<LD>   The 74-year-old congresswoman, who received 83% of the vote, had
been expected to coast to victory even though she has been
hospitalized for viral pneumonia caused by a case of chickenpox.</LD>
<TE>   In the final tally Sunday, Hirono won the Democratic nomination
with 76,685 votes, or 41%, followed by state Rep. Ed Case with 74,082
votes, or 40%. Former GOP legislator D.G. "Andy" Anderson was next
with 33,378 votes, or 18%.</TE>
<TE>   Lingle easily won the GOP primary against former legislator John
Carroll, taking 90% of the vote, four years after narrowly losing the
state's top office to incumbent Democrat Ben Cayetano.</TE>
<TE>   Cayetano was barred by law from seeking a third consecutive term.</TE>
<TE>   In November's congressional races, Mink will face 10-year state
House member Bob McDermott, who won the GOP primary for the 2nd
District. Democratic Rep. Neil Abercrombie, who was unopposed
Saturday in the 1st District, will face auto dealer Mark Terry.</TE>

<HD>Still a Few Dots to Connect in Iraq Domino Theory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Behind concern about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction,
there's another force propelling American forces toward combat in
Iraq: A new domino theory.</LD>
<LD>   This version of the theory inverts the original. During the Cold
War, the first domino theory held that if Vietnam fell to the
Communists, neighboring nations all the way to the Philippines might
fall away from us too--toppling like dominoes.</LD>
<LD>   The new domino theorists are arguing that if the United States
overthrows Hussein and creates a pro-Western democratic regime in
Iraq, the example will increase internal pressure to open closed
societies such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Syria. This time the
dominoes would fall in our direction.</LD>
<TE>   This theory has become a central--perhaps the
central--justification for war in conservative circles, especially
among the neoconservative foreign policy intellectuals. The Wall
Street Journal editorial page, the leading bulletin board for
conservatives, summarized the case this year: "If the U.S. removes
Saddam in the right way, advocating a democracy instead of replacing
him with another thug, the lesson will echo through the Arab world."</TE>
<TE>   These arguments have migrated into the administration's own brief
for war. The headlines after Bush's United Nations speech focused on
his demand that Iraq disarm and comply with a long list of other U.N.
resolutions. But Bush also endorsed the neoconservatives' new domino
theory, arguing that democracy in Iraq--as well as in Afghanistan and
an independent Palestinian state--would inspire "reforms throughout
the Muslim world."</TE>
<TE>   This goal has implications the administration hasn't fully
acknowledged, and may explain some of its recent fuzziness on its
ultimate aims in Iraq. For much of the world, an inspection regime
that convincingly disarmed Iraq would be enough to end the crisis.
But to the extent that President Bush has embraced the new domino
theory, that's insufficient. Iraq can't be the first domino unless
Hussein is removed and a new, open political system takes root. For
the domino theorists, the goal isn't just disarmament but
transformation.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two weeks, it's been murky whether that's a
nonnegotiable goal for the administration. Not only Bush but Vice
President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell have
lauded the potential benefits of a democratic Iraq. But by declaring
their immediate aims to be disarmament and enforcement of U.N.
resolutions, they have left it unclear whether the administration
would settle for a convincingly disarmed Iraq with Hussein still in
charge. What's already clear is that Bush will face significant
pressure from domino theorists inside and outside the government not
to accept that outcome.</TE>
<TE>   The believers see three big benefits to replacing Hussein with a
democratic, Western-leaning leader. The first two are utterly
hard-headed. Even more than overthrowing the Taliban in Afghanistan,
they argue, invading Iraq would send a sobering message to other
hostile nations. A new Iraqi government might also pump more oil,
reducing America's dependence on Saudi Arabian crude. That would give
us more freedom to lean on the Saudis to restrain their own
extremists.</TE>
<TE>   The third is at the heart of the new domino theory: The belief
that establishing what Cheney called a "democratic and pluralistic"
Iraq would provide a model that inspires demand for democracy and
change in other Arab states.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to quarrel with the first two elements in this
case. U.S. tanks in Baghdad would surely turn heads in Damascus and
Tehran. And reduced reliance on Saudi oil could give U.S. presidents
more leverage to pressure the kingdom for change.</TE>
<TE>   But it's much more questionable that the United States can build a
democratic Iraq, or that other nations would be drawn to the model if
it did. Iraq isn't exactly fertile soil for democracy. Since it
became an independent country in 1932, its political life has been
defined by military coups, palace intrigue, assassinations and ethnic
strife.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq hasn't had any functioning political alternative to Hussein's
Baath party for more than three decades. The middle class that
provides the basis for democracy has been eroded by the Iraqi
dictator's misrule and the impact of economic sanctions. Tensions
between Kurds, Sunni Muslims (who have ruled under Hussein) and the
majority Shiite Muslims would inevitably erupt if the iron hand is
removed. And other nations such as Iran and Turkey would likely poach
for influence.</TE>
<TE>   "It is going to be incredibly difficult just to achieve a stable,
peaceful and friendly Iraq," says Amy Hawthorne, an associate at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "The prospect of that
entity also taking on a democratic character over time is a challenge
unlike any the U.S. has attempted before."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is it certain that a new Iraqi regime built on the rubble of
war would have the magnetic pull that domino theorists hope. Many
Arabs may recoil from any regime installed at the point of a U.S.
gun. And Hawthorne says reformers in neighboring countries may not
see a transformation imposed by war as much of a model for peacefully
changing their own societies.</TE>
<TE>   These are all reasons to be skeptical about the domino theorists'
dreams of exporting democracy to the desert. But they are not
necessarily reason to shelve those dreams. The odds of a post-Hussein
Iraq becoming the lever to democratize the Middle East are too thin
to justify war on that basis alone. But Bush and a majority of
Congress still could conclude that an invasion is justified on
national security grounds. And if they do, it would be in this
country's interest to follow a war with a concerted effort to build
an open Iraqi society.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if war comes, as seems likely, the demands of the domino
theory could make it an odd one. Going in, the United States will
know that everything it destroys in Iraq it will have to pay to
rebuild--and that it will soon need the allegiance of the society
that will feel the brunt of battle. Meanwhile, other Arab nations we
are trying to enlist, such as Saudi Arabia, would recognize that one
of the invasion's long-term purposes is to erode the legitimacy of
their own regimes. Squaring these political riddles with the military
imperative of ousting Hussein may prove to be an engineering problem
much more complex than toppling dominoes.</TE>

<HD>Federal Officials Seize Cattle in Nevada</HD>
<DH>Dispute: BLM says two Western Shoshones are grazing their
stock illegally on public land.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RENO</DL>
<LD>As more than 30 armed federal agents stood by Sunday, Bureau of Land
Management officials seized 227 head of cattle they say two Western
Shoshone sisters were grazing illegally on public land in
northeastern Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   Mary and Carrie Dann, who have been at odds with federal
authorities for nearly three decades over grazing and land ownership,
sharply criticized the operation in Pine Valley, about 60 miles
southwest of Elko.</LD>
<LD>   They maintain that the Western Shoshone still own much of Nevada
under the 1863 Treaty of Ruby Valley and that the BLM has no
jurisdiction over their operation.</LD>
<TE>   "It's domestic terrorism," Carrie Dann said. "Our homelands are
threatened by the mightiest and most powerful nation in the world. To
do this and take away our livelihood is morally and ethically wrong.
We are trying to make a living off Western Shoshone land."</TE>
<TE>   But BLM spokeswoman Jo Simpson said courts have ruled that the
land in question is owned by the public, not by the tribe.</TE>
<TE>   "The courts have extinguished the treaty and directed BLM to
manage those lands as public lands," she said. "Certainly, an
impoundment is something we don't want to do. But the Danns'
continued trespass has resulted in severe overgrazing and degradation
of the land."</TE>
<TE>   Simpson warned that the BLM would seize about 800 horses in the
same area in the future if the Danns fail to remove them.</TE>
<TE>   Wranglers, aided by a helicopter, began the operation shortly
before 9 a.m. Eight Dann supporters were escorted from the site
without incident for safety reasons before the roundup began, Simpson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Dann supporters and BLM officials later clashed over whether the
agency has the authority to restrict access on a dirt road leading to
the site. Simpson insisted that the BLM never closed the road but
merely managed access to the site for safety reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Eureka County Sheriff Ken Jones disagreed, saying a federal
vehicle blocked the road. He said it was a county road that must
remain open to the public.</TE>

<HD>Doubt, Fear Greet Terror Arrests</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Allegations that six young men from a Buffalo
suburb trained with Al Qaeda have shaken their neighbors. Tensions
are high in the tight-knit community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LACKAWANNA, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>In the blighted neighborhood called Ward One, shopkeeper Andrea
Haxton knows all of her customers--including six young men charged
with aiding Osama bin Laden. The arrests of the "Lackawanna Six,"
Haxton said Sunday, have shifted the focus at her corner store from
the cost of fresh produce to the price of prejudice.</LD>
<LD>   "This is affecting everyone," Haxton said. "This has always been a
place where we watch out for one another. Now some people are looking
at one another differently. It's a shame, a downright shame."</LD>
<LD>   On the streets, in stores, outside homes and in the confines of a
Muslim school, many residents of this decaying former steel town are
prepared to acknowledge that the truth about the American-born
suspects is not yet known. Perhaps they did constitute an Al Qaeda
sleeper cell, some say, helping to finance a worldwide jihad and even
lending their own bodies to the effort. Or maybe, others suggest,
these young men simply were led astray by unchecked spirits of
adventure.</LD>
<TE>   Among this city's Yemeni population, the arrests prompted a sense
of outrage and confusion. On Sunday, hundreds gathered at the
Yemenite Benevolent Assn. for the latest in a series of community
meetings. In Mercedes and minivans, in golf shirts and in flowing
robes, residents poured into a brick storefront for an information
session scheduled to last an hour. Instead, it took up most of the
day.</TE>
<TE>   "People want to ask questions," said Mohamed al-Banna, a candy
company owner who chaired the meeting. "They are concerned that the
general population might prejudge not only these individuals, but our
entire community."</TE>
<TE>   Ranging in age from 22 to 29, the terrorism suspects were jailed
more than a week ago. Authorities contend that along with two others
who are believed to be at large in Yemen, they were involved with Al
Qaeda, Bin Laden's terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   While carefully blending into a community of more than 2,000
Yemenis, the suspects provided support to known terrorists,
prosecutors here argued in bail hearings last week. By attending an
Al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan where Bin Laden addressed recruits,
officials said, the men broke a 1996 federal anti-terrorism law.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Magistrate H. Kenneth Schroeder said Friday that he
expects the hearings to continue for at least two weeks. And, he
said, he has anguished over the responsibility of ensuring the rights
of the suspects while protecting America as well.</TE>
<TE>   "If I look like I have bags under my eyes, I have been having some
sleepless nights," Schroeder said.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Yemeni community here have pledged millions of
dollars in cash and real estate if the suspects are released on bail.</TE>
<TE>   On a street corner in the neighborhood that many Yemeni immigrants
call home, Bill Hakeem said it was possible that the young men posed
a threat to the nation's security. But, stopping to greet a woman in
Arabic, Hakeem added that it was just as likely the suspects saw
their visit to Afghanistan as an adventure. The 58-year-old
motorcycle enthusiast noted that many young Yemeni men from
Lackawanna make religious pilgrimages to Arab nations.</TE>
<TE>   "Are they terrorists? They might be, I don't know," said Hakeem,
raised on Gates Avenue in the heart of Ward One. "But they might not
be."</TE>
<TE>   What he did feel certain of, Hakeem said, is this: "The
government, they're profiling people here. I believe that is what
this is."</TE>
<TE>   At Liberty Food Mart, where international money-grams can be
purchased as readily as lottery tickets, a 25-year-old clerk of
Yemeni descent said he felt like his whole heritage was under
suspicion: "Almost like they are accusing us all, but indirectly."
The clerk identified himself only as Andy, fearing that disclosing
his surname might subject him to hate crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Andy said he knew several of the suspects "and, to my knowledge,
it seems to me they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. But
the authorities put one and one together and they got three."</TE>
<TE>   Ward One is an island of sorts, cut off from the rest of
Lackawanna by a rusty bridge. Elsewhere in town and in neighboring
Buffalo, its pejorative nickname is "the back of the bridge."</TE>
<TE>   Up until the steel mills closed in the 1970s and '80s, the
district bustled. Where empty lots now stand, theaters abounded on
Ridge Avenue, Ward One's thoroughfare. Ingham Street once boasted so
many bars that it earned an entry in the Guinness Book of Records.</TE>
<TE>   Public housing now rings a portion of the 15-square-block area,
where many of the two-story houses built for mill workers still
stand. Conditions vary from decrepit to borderline suburban. Children
from Puerto Rican families play soccer in the streets with children
whose Yemeni parents wear full Muslim attire.</TE>
<TE>   The tight-knit neighborhood could not help but notice the
appearance some months ago of federal agents. Haxton said her first
indication came when she saw a "bureaucratic type" sitting in a car
for hours, reading the Washington Post.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Haxton related, a man showed up at a community center to
donate an air hockey game. The children were delighted until the
scoreboard jammed. A parent attempting to fix the game found a
listening device inside, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Police presence has stepped up to the point where patrol cars now
hover in front of the mosque on WilkesBarre Street when prayer
services are held five times daily.</TE>
<TE>   The day after the names and addresses of the Lackawanna Six were
printed in the Buffalo newspaper, police were needed when people
began throwing stones at the suspects' homes. Edwin Borrero, manager
of Haxton's store, said he put up a flag from his native Puerto Rico
alongside his American flag after "people drove by calling me
'Taliban.' "</TE>
<TE>   Tensions in the neighborhood are running so high, Borrero said,
that "the other day, there was an accident here. A tire blew up and
people thought it was a bomb."</TE>
<TE>   Lackawanna Police Chief Dennis O'Hara has notified FBI officials
and the U.S. attorney's office that if the suspects are released, his
50-person force may not be adequate to protect the area.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not pretty," said Mohamed Ali Saleh, assistant principal at
the Lackawanna Islamic Center School--where students ages 6 to 16
study Yemeni culture and the Arabic language on the weekends.
"Fortunately, truth will prevail."</TE>
<TE>   Saleh--whose relatives came here to work in the steel mills half a
century ago--said the fate of the suspects and the implications for
the community are the overriding topics at the mosque and the school.
Many people, Saleh explained, say "it is a very, very weak case. They
have no evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Outside A&amp;E Goods--a store whose shelf contents give new meaning
to the term "exotic foods"--the 49-year-old Haxton said all six of
the men in custody were regular patrons. To her, they seemed no more
apt to be terrorists than any of her other customers.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood's variety--"Arabic people, black people, Puerto
Rican people"--said the blue-eyed, blond Haxton, makes it "a cool
place to live."</TE>
<TE>   But now, she said, "I'm scared, scared that this negative backlash
is going to affect us deeply." She paused to hand some fresh tomatoes
to an elderly woman in long, black Arabic attire.</TE>
<TE>   "All we can do," Haxton said, "is let due process run its course."</TE>

<CX>   Terrorism case--A story in Monday's Section A said incorrectly that a
detention hearing for six terrorism suspects might last at least two
more weeks. In fact, the hearing ended Friday, though federal
Magistrate H. Kenneth Schroeder said he might not rule until Oct. 3.
In the meantime, he will consider written motions in the case.</CX>

<HD>Dye Plays Long Ball and A's Beat Rangers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After Jermaine Dye's two home runs, David Justice told his teammate
to make sure he keeps swinging that way for another month.</LD>
<LD>   "If Jermaine is hot, he can carry a ballclub," said Justice, whose
locker is next to Dye's in the Oakland clubhouse.</LD>
<LD>   Dye showed signs of it Sunday. He homered twice, including a shot
that first was ruled foul, as the Athletics beat the Texas Rangers,
7-5, at Oakland to increase their lead to three games over the Angels
in the AL West.</LD>
<TE>   Scott Hatteberg also had a two-run homer for the Athletics.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland plays three games in Seattle and three in Texas to finish
the season. The Angels are at Texas for three then home for three
with the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the edge," Oakland Manager Art Howe said. "Every game we
take off the schedule they're going to run out of time."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Mulder (18-7) pitched six strong innings to win his fifth
consecutive decision as the Athletics won their fifth in a row and
eighth of 10. Ricardo Rincon retired the side in the eighth and Billy
Koch worked the ninth for his 43rd save in 49 chances.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 13, Baltimore 2--Pedro Martinez (20-4) joined Derek Lowe
(21-7) to give the Red Sox their first pair of 20-game winners since
1949, when Mel Parnell (25-7) and Ellis Kinder (23-6) accomplished
the feat.</TE>
<TE>   After giving up two runs and four hits in the first inning at
Baltimore, Martinez blanked the Orioles on three hits over the next
five innings before leaving with an 8-2 lead. He struck out six and
walked one. Trot Nixon provided all the support he needed with a
grand slam.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez has won three Cy Young Awards, but this is only his
second 20-win season. It comes after an injury-plagued season in
which he won only seven games while battling a sore shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   New York 4, Detroit 3--A crowd of 23,930 showed up at Comerica
Park for the last home game of retiring Tiger radio announcer Ernie
Harwell, but the Tigers lost their fifth in a row and their 101st of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees, playing a makeshift lineup the day after clinching
the AL East, swept the three-game series and won eight of nine
against the Tigers this season</TE>
<TE>   Rondell White hit three doubles and drove in two runs for the
Yankees. David Wells (18-7) won for the sixth time in his last seven
starts, giving up three runs and seven hits.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 12, Tampa Bay 6--Orlando Hudson homered and drove in a
career-high five runs to help the Blue Jays avoid a three-game sweep
at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson had four hits in six at-bats and came within a triple of
hitting for the cycle. He hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning.
He had run-scoring singles in the first and sixth innings and doubled
home a run in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Grieve hit a three-run homer for the Devil Rays, who were
trying to equal a season-high four-game winning streak. Since losing
their 100th game on Sept. 14, they've gone 5-2.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 6, Kansas City 5--Karim Garcia hit a tiebreaking,
two-run homer with one out in the eighth inning and the Indians went
on to win at Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Berroa hit a run-scoring double in the bottom of the eighth.
Raul Ibanez tried to score the tying run on the hit, but was thrown
out at the plate on a relay from second baseman Brandon Phillips.
Omar Vizquel hit a solo home run in the ninth to give the Indians a
6-4 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City's Mike Sweeney had three hits and took over the league
batting lead at .347.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 8, Minnesota 2--Frank Thomas and D'Angelo Jimenez each
homered and drove in three runs as the White Sox completed a
three-game sweep of the AL Central champions at Chicago. The White
Sox (79-77) moved two games over .500 for the first time since May
31.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Disney Still in a Mood to Sell</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The Angels' kingdom cannot get much more magical than this: Sellout
crowds at Edison Field, fans camping out at the ballpark to buy
playoff tickets, rally monkeys as must-have collectibles and a
probable prime-time playoff series against the New York Yankees.</LD>
<LD>   There is no magic in the bottom line, however. Although Disney
executives are proud of and pleased with the Angels' success this
year, the terrific season has not persuaded the company to hold onto
the team rather than sell.</LD>
<LD>   "One really has nothing to do with the other," Angel President
Paul Pressler said. "It isn't a strategic asset. If the right buyer
came along, we would consider it."</LD>
<TE>   Although the Angels expect this year's excitement to generate
additional season-ticket sales next year, that won't restore the team
to profitability. The team projects an estimated $18-million loss
this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels started this season with a $60-million player payroll,
a figure that probably will increase next season because they have
committed $60 million to only 10 players.</TE>
<TE>   The playoffs will help, but not much. According to major league
rules, participating teams do not retain ticket revenue from the
first three games of the division series and the first four games of
the league championship series and the World Series, so all the
Angels are guaranteed is about $350,000 a game for concessions and
parking.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue sharing increases next season, but the Angels are
projected to gain a modest $2.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   With the adoption of the new labor agreement, Disney is believed
to have accelerated efforts to find a buyer for the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   One highly placed major league source said he believed Disney
might accept $180 million, three years after putting a $300-million
price tag on the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner, is believed to
be interested in buying the team.</TE>
<TE>   Disney has declined to comment about Donald Watkins, the Alabama
businessman who has pursued the purchase of the team for months, but
Watkins remains interested.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After pitching five years for the Angels, Shigetoshi Hasegawa
turned down a slight raise from the Angels to sign a more lucrative
deal with the Seattle Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   His timing is poor--the Mariners are about to miss the playoffs
for the first time in three years, and the Angels are about to make
the playoffs for the first time in 16 years--but he says he is happy
for his former teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sunday's game, knowing that the Angels would clinch a
playoff spot with a victory, he joked about removing his Mariner gear
to sneak into a possible Angel celebration. And, asked whether he was
the bad-luck charm keeping the Angels out of the playoffs all those
years, he couldn't resist another joke.</TE>
<TE>   "No," he said, cracking a wide smile, "it was Mo Vaughn."</TE>

<KH>DENVER 28, BUFFALO 23</KH>
<HD>Griese Becomes Bronco Closer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Brian Griese is changing his reputation of playing poorly in the
clutch.</LD>
<LD>   Griese threw for 211 yards and two touchdowns, and led Denver on a
key scoring drive for the third consecutive week as the Broncos beat
the Buffalo Bills, 28-23, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "It's becoming a trend for us offensively to put a drive together
in the fourth quarter," said Griese, who has won three consecutive
games for the first time in his five-year career. "I would prefer to
put the game away in the first half like we should have, but we'll
take it."</LD>
<TE>   Griese, the worst-rated passer in the fourth quarter last season,
has been the league's best this year.</TE>
<TE>   After leading the Broncos on decisive scoring drives against St.
Louis and San Francisco the first two weeks, Griese took the Broncos
80 yards for a touchdown after the Bills pulled within 21-16 midway
through the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Griese was six for nine for 62 yards on the final drive, capping
it with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Rod Smith with 2:39 left. He also
kept the drive alive with a six-yard pass to Smith on fourth-and-five
from the Buffalo 37-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   Griese was 16 for 20 for 165 yards with three touchdowns and no
interceptions in the fourth quarter this season. He finished 19 of 31
overall against Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what it's all about--stepping up in crunch time when a
play is needed," Denver fullback Mike Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Denver shut down a high-scoring offense for the third consecutive
week to start 3-0 for the first time since 1998, when they won their
second consecutive Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo (1-2) began the game as the NFL leader in yards passing
and points, and was second in total yards, but finished with only 291
yards--39 rushing.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo's Drew Bledsoe, who set a franchise record with 463 yards
passing against Minnesota last week, was sacked four times and
finished 27 for 41 for 283 yards.</TE>

<HD>Couch Shows Critics Why He's the Starter</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>Tim Couch did his best to shut up the critics who thought backup
Kelly Holcomb should be Cleveland's starting quarterback.</LD>
<LD>   Phil Dawson's 33-yard field goal with 10:47 left in overtime
Sunday gave the Browns a 31-28 victory over Tennessee after Couch
rallied the Browns by throwing for three touchdowns, including two in
the final 2:35 of regulation.</LD>
<LD>   Couch was 36 for 50 for 326 yards in what he called his biggest
moment in the NFL.</LD>
<TE>   "There was a lot of talk this week whether I should even be the
quarterback of this team. I've said all along I don't care what a lot
of people on the outside think, but I know these guys in this locker
room believe in me and I believe in myself," Couch said.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, today maybe I proved a point."</TE>
<TE>   Couch, who sat out the first two games after tearing scar tissue
in his right elbow, showed why Coach Butch Davis had no qualms
putting him back in despite Holcomb being the NFL's second-rated
passer.</TE>
<TE>   The 1999 top draft pick picked apart the Titans in helping the
Browns beat Tennessee for the second consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he was proud of Couch for his play and how he ignored
talk by people trying to create a quarterback controversy. He also
loved how his Browns (2-1) overcame four turnovers the Titans turned
into three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is a team in the NFL more deserving to win a
game like this, with the times we've been snake-bitten the last few
years. I talked to the team early in the week, and we brought up the
first game of the year," Davis said of losing to Kansas City when
Dwayne Rudd was penalized for taking off his helmet, giving the
Chiefs the chance to win on a field goal with no time left.</TE>
<TE>   "We said we can let that game do one of two things. It can either
build some character for the team, teach us a lesson to fight the
entire 60 minutes, or we can let it break us. I knew this team
wouldn't want to surrender."</TE>
<TE>   The Titans (1-2) led, 28-14, with 5:06 left and blew a second-half
lead for a second consecutive week.</TE>
<TE>   "We just simply could not make a play," Titan Coach Jeff Fisher
said.</TE>
<TE>   Couch needed 11 plays to go 80 yards to cut Tennessee's lead to
28-21 with a 12-yard touchdown toss to Andre Davis with 2:35 to go.</TE>
<TE>   With Tennessee ready for an onside kick, Dawson pooch-kicked the
ball over the Titans, and Dennis Northcutt recovered it before it
went out of bounds at the Titan 42.</TE>
<TE>   Nine plays later, Couch threw to Northcutt, who avoided rookie
cornerback Mike Echols and scored with 12 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland won the toss, and Couch needed eight plays to set up
Dawson's winning field goal.</TE>

<HD>Chargers' Win Is Theirs for Taking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>San Diego's defense was the difference again--this time with
turnovers and a goal-line stand.</LD>
<LD>   Marcellus Wiley returned an interception 40 yards to set up a
touchdown and Donnie Edwards returned another 20 yards for a score as
the Chargers (3-0) held off the Arizona Cardinals, 23-15, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Cardinals became the first team to score a touchdown--two of
them, in fact--against San Diego. Jake Plummer connected with MarTay
Jenkins for a 65-yard touchdown on Arizona's third play, then threw
31 yards to Marcel Shipp for a fourth-quarter score.</LD>
<TE>   But the two interceptions, a lost fumble by Thomas Jones and
Carlos Polk's blocked punt for a safety doomed Arizona (2-1). "These
kind are the ones that are hard to talk about," Cardinal Coach Dave
McGinnis said, "because we gave them the football game."</TE>
<TE>   With boos echoing from the sparse crowd in the triple-digit heat,
Plummer nearly brought Arizona back, as he has done from a
fourth-quarter tie or deficit 16 times.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Coach Marty Schottenheimer reflected on his decade with
Kansas City. "Of all the things we were able to accomplish [at Kansas
City], the one we take the greatest pride in is, over a 10-year
period, we had plus-90 in giveaways-takeaways. That's what we
stress," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Down by eight points with under two minutes to go, Arizona had
four shots to score from the San Diego nine-yard line, but Leonardo
Carson batted down the first pass and the next three fell incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers' Junior Seau had to be helped to the locker room
after he was hurt on the last play of that stand. Schottenheimer said
it was a mild ankle sprain.</TE>
<TE>   LaDainian Tomlinson scored on runs of four and two yards.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Lucas intercepted Drew Brees' pass at the Arizona 38 with
4:59 to play. Plummer scrambled twice for 17 yards, and threw nine
yards to ex-Charger Freddie Jones, then Thomas Jones ran 26 yards to
the San Diego nine. But Plummer followed with four incomplete passes.</TE>

<HD>Manning Teaches Carr a Lesson or Two</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Peyton Manning threw touchdown passes of 42 and 43 yards and helped
set up three field goals by Mike Vanderjagt to lead Indianapolis to a
23-3 victory Sunday over Houston.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an expansion team, but these are good players," Manning
said.</LD>
<LD>   Manning, who threw three interceptions in last week's loss to
Miami, quieted the Texans' boisterous crowd of 69,204 with a
perfectly lofted 42-yard touchdown pass to Qadry Ismail, who slipped
behind the secondary in the first quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Houston's rookie quarterback David Carr was impressed by Manning.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where I want to be as a quarterback, and that's where the
guys around me want to be," Carr said. "They've been together four or
five years. When he checks off, there is no indecision. They all know
what he's going to do.</TE>
<TE>   Manning completed 21 of 28 passes for 272 yards. He didn't have an
interception and was sacked three times.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a difficult game," Colt Coach Tony Dungy said. "We kind of
had things going the right way, but we couldn't put these guys away.
We made some mistakes that kind of caused us to self-destruct. But,
when you go on the road and get a win, you take it."</TE>
<TE>   Carr was sacked four times and completed 12 of 22 passes for 99
yards as the Texans failed to score a touchdown for the second
consecutive game.</TE>

<KH>DAVIS CUP</KH>
<HD>Grosjean Leaves U.S. in the Dust</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BUD COLLINS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Sebastien Grosjean tumbled into the brick dust in the second set,
spraining his right ankle, and the U.S. team's hopes of extending the
Davis Cup semifinal to a fifth match were still alive.</LD>
<LD>   But Grosjean got up and only got better, the adrenaline flowing
like the champagne sprayed about the court after his 6-4, 3-6, 6-3,
6-4 victory over Andy Roddick on Sunday. France will defend its title
against Russia in the final in November.</LD>
<LD>   "There was a desire factor," Grosjean said. "A desire to win. The
atmosphere, the crowd made me forget the ankle."</LD>
<TE>   After an injury timeout to have it taped, he played cautiously for
a few points, then was back on a fierce, quick prowl to squash any
hopes the Americans had of taking the series to a determining fifth
match between James Blake and Arnaud Clement, the Friday conqueror of
Roddick.</TE>
<TE>   Had that happened, the pandemonium couldn't have increased. It was
already at fever pitch, a horn-blowing, drum-pounding, chanting,
singing, flag-flapping battle in the stands between rival factions of
faithful, 1,500 Americans against 13,700 homebodies, a rare ambience
for tennis. But never disorderly or hostile. The American players
reveled in it as much as the French.</TE>
<TE>   "A fun atmosphere. I didn't want it to end," Blake said Saturday
after he and Todd Martin had won a most excruciating doubles match
over Fabrice Santoro and Michael Llodra, 2-6, 7-6 (2), 2-6, 6-4, 6-4,
in 3 1/4 hours. That kept their side breathing into Sunday after the
0-2 U.S. start Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Blake did beat Clement in the unnecessary closing match, 6-4, 6-3,
so the series result was France 3, U.S. 2.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot-9 Grosjean was once told by French Federation coaches
that he was too small to be a good player, and was denied financial
help. He was big enough to make all the French front pages today,
after playing "my best Cup match."</TE>
<TE>   He and Clement are so fast and resourceful, retrievers supreme,
that they made Roddick look bewildered.</TE>
<TE>   "With my ankle I had trouble moving backward," Grosjean said, so
the young man in the backward cap decided "to move forward more, play
aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   That he did. Usually a baseline grinder, he played some startling
serve-and-volley tennis, made sneak volleys, hit blinding passing
shots and outserved Roddick, placing the ball admirably. He threw
Roddick off by scoring on eight of nine drop shots in the early
going.</TE>
<TE>   "Grosjean stuck around mentally the whole time," said Roddick,
ranked 11th in the world. He also acknowledged, "I'm still learning."</TE>
<TE>   "Both he and James are," U.S. Captain Patrick McEnroe said.
"They're passionate for Davis Cup, and will form a solid nucleus.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure from the crowd, and Clement and Grosjean, was good
for them. They may have lost but they fought well. They just need
consistency in matches like this. They let some big points get away.</TE>
<TE>   "Against Clement, Andy had five set points in the second and was
two points from winning the third-set tiebreaker," McEnroe said of
Roddick's 4-6, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (5), 6-1 loss Friday. "And James had
points to take Grosjean into a fifth set" before losing, 6-4, 6-1,
6-7 (7-9), 7-5.</TE>

<HD>Carrara to Start Wednesday Against Rockies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Rejecting the idea of using Hideo Nomo on Wednesday on three days'
rest and then possibly in Sunday's regular-season finale, again on
three days' rest, Manager Jim Tracy has decided to use middle
reliever Giovanni Carrara in Wednesday's game against the Colorado
Rockies and Nomo in Thursday's series opener against the San Diego
Padres.</LD>
<LD>   Odalis Perez will open the two-game series against the Rockies at
Dodger Stadium on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "With all the work he has done," Tracy said of Nomo, "and all the
pitches he has thrown, I would rather have Nomo ready for a playoff
game than to try to use him twice on three days' rest in one week."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Dave Roberts, suffering from a strained muscle on
his right side, will refrain from physical activity for the next few
days with the hope that he might make it back on the field by next
weekend, the end of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   But, Roberts said, the more likely possibility is that he would be
available for the postseason, should the Dodgers get that far.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts will have an MRI today or Tuesday to validate the
diagnosis.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll first try getting on the treadmill," Roberts said. "If I do
that and show progress, good. If not, I'll pretty much have to shut
it down."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts was hurt leading off Saturday night's game against San
Diego Padre right-hander Brett Tomko.</TE>
<TE>   "On an 0-2 count," Roberts said, "I took a defensive swing at a
pitch that was up and away."</TE>
<TE>   A sharp pain cut through Roberts' right side, a pain so sharp he
considered asking for a pinch-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "But you don't want to do that to someone on 0-2," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So Roberts stepped out of the box, took a deep breath and hoped
the pain would subside.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought maybe, hopefully, it was a cramp," he said.</TE>
<TE>   No such luck.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, someway, Roberts, who had only two home runs this season,
was able to smack a Tomko pitch into the right-field seats, pain and
all.</TE>
<TE>   He took his time circling the bases, the first clue to those in
the dugout that something was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "At first," Tracy said, "I was thinking this is not something we
do [taking one's time going around the bases]. It suggests to the
opponent, 'We got you.' But as soon as he reached home plate and
turned to the dugout, you could tell by his expression, he hurt
something."</TE>
<TE>   Although Roberts platooned as the leadoff batter and center
fielder with Marquis Grissom, it was Roberts, with 100 more at-bats
than Grissom, who provided the ignition switch for the offense,
hitting .277 with 45 stolen bases, 63 runs scored and 34 runs batted
in.</TE>
<TE>   Now that switch may be shut off for the season.</TE>

<HD>It May Be Too Much of a Blast for Cora</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Game-tying home run in seventh puts Dodgers in
gear, but his celebration fuels Padre animosity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Alex Cora got caught up in the moment, Adam Eaton fumed and the
Dodgers may have added to their problems in a 4-3 victory Sunday over
the San Diego Padres at Qualcomm Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Cora pointed his right index finger skyward while tying the score,
3-3, in the seventh inning on a two-out home run to right field,
angering Eaton and igniting an exchange between the players that
prompted umpire Wally Bell to instruct the Dodgers to cool it.</LD>
<LD>   Cora acknowledged he got "a little bit too emotional" and
apologized for posing, and Eaton said he understood the situation
with the Dodgers battling the San Francisco Giants for the National
League wild-card berth.</LD>
<TE>   Understanding and forgiving, though, are not the same thing, and
the last-place Padres don't enjoy being taunted by their wealthy
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodger rotation is in tatters, leadoff batter Dave Roberts is
sidelined because of an injury and the Giants lead the NL wild-card
race by two games with six to play.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres and Dodgers finish the season with four games at Chavez
Ravine beginning Thursday, and it appears the Padres won't forget
Cora's big moment as they try to end the Dodgers' season the same
time as theirs.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't like a Kirk Gibson home run," said Eaton, alluding to
the former Dodger's dramatic two-out, ninth-inning shot that won Game
1 of the 1988 World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "He hit a home run to tie a game. He tied up a ballgame with a
home run, and I think he was pretty proud of himself."</TE>
<TE>   Eaton fell behind Cora, 3 and 1, in the seventh after easily
retiring Adrian Beltre and Mark Grudzielanek. The No. 8 hitter
connected on a fastball, sending it over the right-field wall and
beginning his celebration by extending the bat before dropping it and
pointing.</TE>
<TE>   "Just the emotions took over," Cora said. "When you're in that
situation, you get a little bit too emotional. Just watching it on
replay, I think I did, and I've got to apologize for that. At the
same time, people have to realize we're playing for our lives here.
It's all heart right now.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, when you get a big hit, you react that way. It
happens. I just finished my swing, saw the ball was gone and whatever
happened, happened. The emotions took over and people have to
recognize that. I know that's not part of the game, I'm the first one
to accept it. At the same time, we're playing for a lot of things
here."</TE>
<TE>   The smooth-fielding infielder has helped the Dodgers remain in
contention, batting .290 and establishing himself in his third full
season. Cora, whose strong play led to the Aug. 1 benching of
shortstop Cesar Izturis, is one of the most respected players in the
clubhouse, and the Dodgers believe too much was made of his impromptu
gesture.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen Alex Cora say anything to anyone for two years,"
said Manager Jim Tracy, who exchanged words with Bell after he warned
the Dodgers about their comments toward Eaton in the eighth. "He's a
winning baseball player. That's what Alex Cora is."</TE>
<TE>   Eaton is scheduled to make his final start Saturday at Dodger
Stadium, and he's looking forward to the opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "Things were said," Eaton said. "We'll see what happens."</TE>

<KH>PHILADELPHIA 44, DALLAS 13</KH>
<HD>McNabb, Eagles Have Cowboys on the Run</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Donovan McNabb used the Dallas Cowboys' blitz to his advantage.</LD>
<LD>   McNabb completed 24 of 37 passes for 287 yards and three
touchdowns, and ran for 67 yards and one touchdown to lead the
Philadelphia Eagles to a 44-13 victory over the Cowboys Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Pressured, harassed and forced to run in the first quarter, McNabb
kept his poise and picked apart the Cowboys the rest of the game.</LD>
<TE>   His scrambles of 26 and 25 yards in the opening quarter kept
Dallas off-balance and opened up the passing game after a slow start.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I stopped them from blitzing," McNabb said. "I took it
upon myself to get some yards and move the chains."</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles (2-1) didn't allow an offensive touchdown for the
second consecutive game. Reggie Swinton's 100-yard kickoff return was
the only touchdown for Dallas (1-2).</TE>
<TE>   Emmitt Smith ran 11 times for 52 yards, moving within 362 yards of
passing Walter Payton to become the NFL's career rushing leader.
Smith's sixth carry moved him ahead of Payton for No. 1 on the
rushing attempts list. He has 3,844 carries.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb, sacked twice in the first quarter, spent the game's final
9:28 watching from the sideline after the Eagles built a 28-point
lead.</TE>
<TE>   "He takes the game over," Dallas Coach Dave Campo said.</TE>
<TE>   After falling behind, 10-3, in the first quarter, the Eagles
scored the next 31 points on their way to their second consecutive
rout.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia dominated the Washington Redskins in a 37-7 victory
Monday night, a week after wasting a 14-point halftime lead in a
season-opening loss at Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   A 35-yard touchdown pass from McNabb to James Thrash tied the
score, 10-10, early in the second quarter. On their next possession,
the Eagles went ahead to stay on a two-yard touchdown run by McNabb
that made it 17-10.</TE>

<KH>ATLANTA 30, CINCINNATI 3</KH>
<HD>Falcons Have an Easy Time With Overmatched Bengals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The Atlanta Falcons had the perfect opponent after two heartbreaking
losses.</LD>
<LD>   The Cincinnati Bengals haven't come close to beating anybody. They
were out of it by halftime Sunday night, losing to the Falcons, 30-3,
as Michael Vick threw a pair of touchdown passes to Brian Finneran.</LD>
<LD>   "We needed this game," Atlanta's Patrick Kerney said. "We didn't
even want it to be a close game. They're struggling and we needed to
send a message that we're a great team."</LD>
<TE>   The Falcons (1-2) can't make a claim of greatness by beating
Cincinnati, however. If the NFL had relegation, the Bengals (0-3)
would be in the Canadian Football League by now.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati has been outscored, 84-16, and already given up on
quarterback Gus Frerotte, who was benched midway through the second
quarter when he missed his first seven passes.</TE>
<TE>   "We were defeated very decisively and this is a very tough time,"
said Coach Dick LeBeau, who already is facing questions about how
long he'll be on the job.</TE>
<TE>   "I will do my best at this position as long as I am in this
position," he said. "Right now, I want to get us out of this hole
that we are in."</TE>
<TE>   Vick outgained the Bengals all by himself. He completed 16 of 26
passes for 174 yards and pulled off several scintillating runs,
finishing with 56 yards rushing.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt I could basically take over the game," Vick said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bengals? Playing in prime time for the first time in four
years, they drove inside the Atlanta 40 once.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati did have one breakthrough of sorts: For the first time
this season, the Bengals actually scored in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Rackers kicked a 24-yard field goal with three seconds left
in the half, but all that did was cut Atlanta's lead to 20-3.</TE>
<TE>   The Falcons began the season with an overtime loss at Green Bay,
followed by a one-point loss to Chicago when they missed a field goal
in the final minute.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Atlanta didn't have to worry about losing one at the
end.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally," Coach Dan Reeves said. "The guys have really been close
the last two weeks."</TE>
<TE>   After field goals by Jay Feely on their first two possessions, the
Falcons turned Vick loose and blew the game open.</TE>
<TE>   The speedy quarterback scrambled for seven yards to convert a
third-and-six situation. He turned a broken play into a 14-yard gain.
Finally, on third and one at the Cincinnati 20, Vick play-faked the
Bengals and threw a touchdown to Finneran over the middle.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like being back in high school again," Finneran said. "You
can run around and pretty much do whatever you want."</TE>

<KH>NEW YORK GIANTS 9, SEATTLE 6</KH>
<HD>Bryant No Mere Pawn in Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Instead of a record-tying 300-yard passing performance by Kerry
Collins, the New York Giants gladly settled for three field goals
from a former pawnbroker who has turned into a perfect kicker.</LD>
<LD>   Rookie Matt Bryant kicked a game-deciding 47-yard field goal with
2:04 to play and the Giants overcame a subpar effort to beat the
winless Seattle Seahawks, 9-6, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant, waived less than a week before the season and re-signed
two days before the opener, added field goals of 33 and 21 yards as
the Giants (2-1) barely avoided a letdown a week after knocking off
St. Louis on the road. "This is great," said Bryant, who has made all
nine of his field goals attempts. "It's every kicker's dream to win a
game in that situation."</LD>
<TE>   For Bryant, it has been an unbelievable season. After waiting four
years to get to an NFL training camp, the former Baylor kicker is
surprising everyone since getting a chance when Owen Pochman went on
injured reserve because of a knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   Collins, who missed in his effort for a record-tying sixth
consecutive 300-yard passing game, moved the Giants 65 yards in 11
plays to set up Bryant's game-deciding kick.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel more like a part of the team," Bryant said. "They know who
I am now."</TE>
<TE>   William Peterson iced the win for the second straight week with an
interception in the final two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The defense limited Seattle to 145 yards, holding running back
Shaun Alexander to 37 yards rushing.</TE>
<TE>   "We were sleep-walking in the first half and the second half we
kind of woke up," said defensive end Michael Strahan, who picked up
his first sack of the season. "The offense moved the ball and got
enough points on the board to win. The defense held them when we had
to."</TE>
<TE>   Rian Lindell staked Seattle to a 6-0 halftime lead with field
goals of 42 and 27 yards. It wasn't enough to prevent the Seahawks
from losing their third in a row, their worst start since Mike
Holmgren took over as coach in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "We dug ourselves a hole, but we have to dig our way out of it,"
Holmgren said.</TE>
<TE>   Collins connected on pass plays of 20 yards to Amani Toomer, 18 to
Ike Hilliard and 10 to Jeremy Shockey to set up Bryant's longest NFL
field goal.</TE>
<TE>   "The record would have been nice, but I'll take a win any day of
the week," said Collins, who finished 23 for 38 for 282 yards. "This
is a big win to come back."</TE>
<TE>   After failing to score late in the first half on two cracks from
the one-yard line in the closing seconds, Collins got New York going
in the third quarter. He led a 16-play, 69-yard drive that Bryant
capped with his 33-yarder.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant tied the score with his 21-yarder early in the fourth
quarter on a drive that featured Tiki Barber's 33-yard gain on a
screen pass.</TE>

<HD>It Isn't Perfect, but Woods Wins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods got a bigger fight than he expected Sunday, then a real
surprise at the end--his first and only bogey of an otherwise
flawless victory in the American Express Championship at Thomastown,
Ireland.</LD>
<LD>   "That last hole did get me," Woods said.</LD>
<LD>   It was about the only thing that did during a week in which his
worst round was a 67. Woods went 51 consecutive holes with nothing
worse than a four on his scorecard, and he claimed his fifth World
Golf Championship event by one stroke.</LD>
<TE>   Woods had a five-stroke lead going into the final round, closed
with a six-under 66 and still had to hit his best shot of the week--a
wedge from the deep rough--for a birdie on the 17th hole to hold off
a late charge by Retief Goosen.</TE>
<TE>   Goosen played six holes at six under par, including a six-foot
eagle putt on the 17th hole to get within one shot, and he had a
career-best 62 to finish second.</TE>
<TE>   Woods finished at 25-under 263 for a one-stroke victory, matching
his best score in relation to par in a 72-hole tournament. He really
wanted to get his first bogey-free tournament title. With the victory
all but assured, when his tee shot found the fairway on the 18th
hole, it looked as though nothing could stop him.</TE>
<TE>   But a photographer snapped a photo as Woods stood over his
four-iron, facing a 237-yard shot to a green guarded by sand and
water. He backed off, glared at the photographer, then pushed his
approach into right rough. He chipped to three feet but missed the
par putt.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important shot of the entire week, and he gets a happy
finger," Woods said. "It just threw my focus off. I never got it all
the way back to where it should have been. I'm hot at him, yes."</TE>
<TE>   With his fifth PGA Tour victory this year and sixth worldwide,
Woods became the first player since Arnold Palmer (1960-63) to get at
least five tour victories in four consecutive years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   K.J. Choi shot a final-round 68 for a seven-shot victory in the
Tampa Bay Classic at Palm Harbor, Fla., winning for the second time
this season.</TE>
<TE>   Choi, 31st on the tour money list when the entry deadline
qualified the top 30 for a trip to Ireland for the World Golf
Championship event, finished at 17-under-par 267 and won $468,000.
Glen Day, who closed with a 69, finished seven shots back at 10
under. Mark Brooks shot 67 to finish eight back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Lietzke shot a final-round 67, reaching 16 of 18 greens in
regulation to win by four shots over Tom Watson, Sammy Rachels and
Gil Morgan in the SAS Championship at Cary, N.C. It was Lietzke's
third Senior PGA Tour title of the season. He finished the 52-hole
event at 14-under-par 202 and earned $255,000.</TE>

<HD>Taliano Takes Barretts Juvenile</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the 2-year-old colt Taliano worked five furlongs at Fairplex
Park on Sept. 15, the clockers caught him in a sharp one minute flat.</LD>
<LD>   Jack Van Berg, Taliano's trainer timed him even faster, in 59 3/5
seconds.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought there might have been something wrong with my watch,"
Van Berg said. "But then I always felt that this colt had a lot of
talent."</LD>
<TE>   Taliano, ridden by Danny Sorenson, backed up that workout Sunday
at the Pomona track, winning the $100,000 Barretts Juvenile by three
lengths. Elan, the odds-on favorite, couldn't hold the lead in the
stretch and finished second. Charmer Baron was third in the
five-horse field.</TE>
<TE>   Taliano's victory meant that both of the weekend's stakes for
2-year-olds were won by maidens. Saturday's Barretts Debutante
winner, Last Kiss, had not won in two previous starts.</TE>
<TE>   Taliano, who paid $17.80 for $2, had run only once before,
finishing fifth at Del Mar on Aug. 31. Mike Smith rode him that day.</TE>
<TE>   Van Berg's horse gave Sorenson his second consecutive win in the
Juvenile. The 44-year-old jockey, who won three races at Fairplex on
opening day, won last year's stake with Sweet Stepper, who was a 15-1
shot.</TE>
<TE>   The run around the first turn Sunday was marred by Love When You
City, who came out and forced Elan wide. Sorenson was sitting behind
the two troubled horses.</TE>
<TE>   "When that happens on this bullring," Sorenson said, "the best
thing you can do is stay inside, because the horses' centrifugal
force will carry them to the outside."</TE>
<TE>   Paying $52,000, Van Berg bought Taliano at the Barretts sale of
unraced 2-year-olds at Fairplex in May. For the same owners, Joe and
Lola Sample, he also paid $20,000 to buy another colt, You Crack Me
Up, who finished off the board in his debut in Sunday's fourth race.</TE>
<TE>   "We had looked at [Taliano] and liked him," Van Berg said. "But
when the bidding started, I couldn't get a hold of Joe on the phone
to check with him. When I finally reached him and said what we had
paid for the two, he said that I better not buy any more."</TE>
<TE>   Taliano is a Kentucky-bred son of Rubiano, winner of the Eclipse
Award for best sprinter in 1992, and the Clever Trick mare Shes A
Calling. Sunday's win was worth $55,000. The time for 6 1/2 furlongs
was 1:17 1/5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Finality, ridden by John Velazquez, beat Union Place by one length
in the $200,000 Jamaica Handicap at Belmont Park. Finishing third
under Kent Desormeaux was favored Chiselling, who was trapped behind
horses in midstretch. Finality, who has won four of five grass starts
at Belmont and is winless in four turf races at other tracks, paid
$21.... Bonapaw, winner of Saturday's Vosburgh at Belmont, is not
eligible for the $1-million Breeders' Cup Sprint at Arlington Park on
Oct. 26. The owners of the 6-year-old gelding, James and Richard
Dennis, said they might take on a partner for the one race if someone
would be willing to pay the $200,000 supplementary fee that's needed
to run. First place in the race is worth $520,000.</TE>

19  CARSON (1-1, City)                  Very dubious numbers put up

23  VALENCIA  (1-1, SS-Div. II)         Vikings find thrill ride a
                                        stiffer test than Newbury

<LD>BY THE NUMBERS</LD>
<LD>   0 Number of passes attempted in the second half of Sherman Oaks
Notre Dame's 35-21 victory over Westlake Village Westlake, after the
score was tied at halftime, 14-14.</LD>
<LD>   19.4 Rushing average of Woodland Hills El Camino Real's Matthew
Sattler, who gained 350 yards in 18 carries in a 31-26 victory over
Reseda. He scored on runs of 50, 45, 79 and 52 yards.</LD>
<TE>   27 Winning streak by Lancaster Paraclete after its 16-14 victory
over Twentynine Palms. Brian Wilson and Aaron Merlo tackled Dan
Leopoldo on a two-point conversion attempt with 1:09 remaining to
prevent a tie.</TE>
<TE>   30.4 Average yards for each of Ryan Lombardo's 11 completed passes
in Lake Balboa Birmingham's 38-14 victory over San Pedro. Lombardo
was 11 of 14 with touchdown passes of 80, 55 and 18 yards, and also
kicked a 23-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   BIG WINNERS</TE>
<TE>   * Adam Hill, a junior at Anaheim Esperanza, made a school-record
12 receptions for 203 yards in the Aztecs' 35-34 victory over
Fallbrook. Last season, Hill had to play quarterback because
quarterback Rick Taloa sat out most of the season because of a foot
injury and the Aztecs had one of their worst seasons in years.</TE>
<TE>   * Manuel Hurtado had four interceptions in L.A. Roosevelt's 44-7
victory over L.A. Lincoln. Teammate Tony Sanchez had two.</TE>
<TE>   * Perry Martinez, a sophomore running back at La Puente, was in
the lineup against Whittier because of an injury to starter Brian
Porter. Martinez rushed for 167 yards, including a 73-yard touchdown
run, in a 34-14 victory.</TE>
<TE>   * Mojave sophomore Adrian Nunez was called up from the junior
varsity to replace quarterback John Prosesl, who injured his thumb in
last week's game. In his varsity debut, Nunez completed eight of 12
passes for 147 yards and two touchdowns in a 29-7 victory L.A.
Baptist.</TE>
<TE>   UPSETS</TE>
<TE>   * That Taft defeated Carson, 39-0, wasn't so much an upset. That
this was supposed to be a possible preview of the City championship
made the outcome astounding. Last season's quarterfinal meeting
between the schools was won by Taft, 17-14.</TE>
<TE>   * Last season, Lakewood spiraled to a 1-8 record after losing to
rival Lakewood Mayfair, which finished 11-3 and won the Southern
Section Division VI championship. This season, Lakewood scored on its
first five possessions, took a 45-0 lead and won the battle for the
Milk Bucket, 52-9.</TE>
<TE>   COMEBACKS</TE>
<TE>   * Chatsworth trailed host Los Angeles in the third quarter, 14-7,
before scoring 34 points in a row in a 41-14 victory.</TE>
<TE>   * Jesse Reyes kicked a 20-yard field goal with eight seconds
remaining to give Huntington Park a 14-12 victory over L.A. Salesian.</TE>

<LD>Several streaks came to conclusions over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura St. Bonaventure had its 43-game winning streak ended by
Newhall Hart, 31-6. La Quinta had its 27-game unbeaten streak ended
in a 16-0 loss to Murrieta Valley. Brea Olinda had its 14-game
winning streak ended by Los Alamitos, 56-10.</LD>
<LD>   And then there was Malibu's streak.</LD>
<TE>   The Sharks had lost 13 in a row, but ended their frustration with
a 43-0 victory over Los Angeles Ribet Academy.</TE>
<TE>   Lars Edmand and Jeremy Kent, who take turns at fullback and
tailback, are the only holdovers from Malibu's last victory, nearly
two years ago against Santa Clara. Coincidentally, despite a 1-8-1
record that year, Malibu qualified for the playoffs and lost, 69-7,
to St. Bonaventure.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to hand it to the kids," Coach Rich Lawson said. "I have
13 seniors [among the 19 players] and they all got their teeth kicked
in last year."</TE>
<TE>   The victory marked Malibu's first shutout and the first time it
scored more than 35 points in seven seasons, all under Lawson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pivotal in Fontana Kaiser's 24-21 upset of Riverside North, The
Times' then-No. 9 ranked team, was Steve Sturdivant's fourth-and-six
pass completion to Antoine Caton for a first down late in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Sturdivant followed with a 36-yard pass to Caton, and from the
two-yard line, handed off to Allen Wade for the game-winning score
with 55 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   But it almost didn't happen that way. Kaiser Coach Dick Bruich
called for a timeout to pull his punting team off the field on fourth
down.</TE>
<TE>   His decision resulted in an upset of the Southern Section's
defending Division V champion, another notation on a resume that
includes 208 victories and Division I titles at Fontana in 1987 and
'89.</TE>
<TE>   "It means absolutely nothing," Bruich said. "It won't help us get
in the playoffs and it won't help us win league. Hopefully, it makes
us a better team, but our goal is to be a good team in Week 6 [when
league play starts].</TE>
<TE>   "My resume is so old," Bruich said, "it's printed on yellow
paper."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Valencia's 63-28 victory over Newbury Park left people gasping as
they watched the teams score almost at will and combine for nearly
900 yards of offense.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe no one was more short of breath than Valencia's Kevin Crane,
who returned the opening kickoff 91 yards for a touchdown and the
next kickoff 91 yards for another touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen that happen before, a guy returning back-to-back
kickoffs for a touchdown," said Brian Stiman, in his ninth season as
Valencia's coach.</TE>
<TE>   Crane later added a 31-yard touchdown reception from quarterback
Stephen Wright, and a 20-yard interception return for a score.
Teammate Charles Burnley scored three touchdowns, on runs of 25, 25
and 50 yards, and gained 190 yards rushing.</TE>
<TE>   Valencia led at halftime, 42-21, and the combined 63 points in the
first half was the third-best total for a half in Southern Section
history, matching a 1996 game between L.A. Cathedral and Bosco Tech.
The record is 84, set by Bloomington and Artesia in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   In a losing effort, Rudy Carpenter of Newbury Park completed 22 of
43 passes for 378 yards and four touchdowns. He also threw three
interceptions. Justin Cox had eight catches for 170 yards and three
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the game left everyone exhausted because they thought it
was never going to end," Stiman said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robbie Dubois, The Times' 2001 Orange County player of the year,
made the four-hour drive from Fresno on Friday to see his high school
team, Mission Viejo, play Santa Ana Mater Dei at Santa Ana Stadium.
But the running back was running late and caught only the last two
minutes of the Diablos' 21-19 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Judging from the last two minutes," said Dubois, who is a
redshirt at Fresno State, "they looked pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Dubois might not have been so complimentary had he seen all the
game. Mission Viejo recorded its 16th consecutive victory despite
some worrisome developments:</TE>
<TE>   * The Diablos had three extra-point kick attempts blocked, opening
the door for Mater Dei to attempt a late two-point conversion that
would have tied the score had it been successful.</TE>
<TE>   * Starting quarterback Matt Uritis, filling in for injured Josh
Rodarmel, completed one of six passes for one yard and had two passes
intercepted. Uritis also fumbled twice, though he recovered the ball
each time. Rodarmel is expected to return in about a month.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Aaron Ware, who suffered a muscle strain in his hip in
the season opener--albeit after gaining 223 yards in 11 carries--sat
out Westlake Village Oaks Christian's 36-3 victory over Sun Valley
Village Christian on Saturday. He is likely to return to the lineup
Friday against Canoga Park.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Adam Richter took care of the rushing duties, gaining 130
yards and touchdown; he gained 158 in the opener against Santa Ana
Calvary Chapel.</TE>
<TE>   Oaks Christian ran the fumblerooski successfully again Saturday
night, with offensive guard Jordan Drake running 35 yards untouched
for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Redell-coached teams have scored more than 10 touchdowns
using the play, in which the ball is hiked to the quarterback, who
places it on the ground under the center, with the guard coming
around to pick it up.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Corona Centennial's 70-0 victory over Manual Arts, the Huskies
led at halftime, 49-0, scored on every possession except their last,
when they let the clock run out at the Manual Arts 12-yard line, and
played with a running clock in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Terrell Jackson gained 239 yards in 18 carries and scored six
touchdowns, on runs of 18, 10, 42, one, seven and 23 yards.
Centennial has outscored its two opponents, including Rialto
Eisenhower, 119-0.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior inside linebacker Dale Mullins of Murrieta Valley suffered
a broken tibia and fibula when his left leg struck the knee of
teammate David Rippey during their victory over La Quinta. Mullins
was a first-team All-Southwestern League player last season.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping he can come back in eight weeks and be ready for the
playoffs," Coach Wally Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was a tough night for Oak Park quarterbacks Peter Burns and
Nolan McNair, who each left with injuries in a 21-0 loss to
Calabasas. Burns suffered a bruised elbow, and McNair broke his
collarbone after a 22-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   "We really don't have a third-string QB, so we put Burns back in
the game after McNair got hurt," Coach Dick Billingsley said. "But he
got hit again, so we took him out and put two running backs and a
fullback in the backfield and ran the single wing."</TE>
<TE>   Burns should be back for the game Saturday against L.A. Baptist,
and tight end Peter Neff, who was the junior varsity quarterback last
season, will become the backup. McNair will be out six weeks.</TE>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>After 40 years as the godfather of unlimited hydroplane racing,
Bernie Little may be nearing the end of his line.</LD>
<LD>   Even as Little, 76, celebrated winning his 22nd championship
Sunday before an estimated 80,000 boating enthusiasts in the
Classmates.com Thunderboat Regatta on Mission Bay, the signs were
there. A once-robust man who dominated everything and everyone in the
pits for years, Little appeared frail and subdued as his son, Joe
Sr., and team manager/driver Dave Villwock, unveiled a banner
proclaiming Miss Budweiser as the 2002 unlimited hydroplane champion.</LD>
<LD>   That came after Villwock finished second in the second heat of the
Bill Muncey Cup, earning Miss Budweiser enough points to clinch the
series championship. It was Villwock's sixth driver's crown.</LD>
<TE>   As a final tribute to the sport's patriarch, the San Diego County
board of supervisors declared Sunday as Bernie Little Day.</TE>
<TE>   In his first 39 years in the sport, Little missed only two races.
This year he has missed three, half the season. Joe, 45, ran the team
at the ones his father missed.</TE>
<TE>   When the banner was hung, though, it was Bernie's picture front
and center, not Joe.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, he'll get his turn when he earns it," said the elder Little
with a sly grin. "I don't worry, though, because I know Joe is ready
to take over, when--and if--I ever give it up. He's been around the
boats all his life and he knows what to do. It's just a case of me
sticking around. What would I do if I quit? This is my life."</TE>
<TE>   Little was hospitalized by pneumonia in mid-season and more
recently has been troubled with pleurisy.</TE>
<TE>   For the three races Bernie missed, Joe ran the team's operations
and was on the phone giving his dad a lap-by-lap rundown of every
heat and final as Bernie recuperated at his Lakeland, Fla. home.</TE>
<TE>   It was former commissioner Bill Doner who said, "Bernie Little is
the worst thing to happen to unlimited racing, and Bernie Little is
the best thing to happen to unlimited racing."</TE>
<TE>   Without Little and his Budweiser largess--and his passion for the
sport--it would be difficult to run a season. This year his Budweiser
budget sponsored the six-race series and three of the individual
races. He also often helps financially-distressed teams privately to
promote his sport.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Miss Budweiser's domination, which at times borders on
arrogance, almost killed the sport a few years ago when only a few
teams wanted to race with Little. His boats have won 22 championships
since 1963 and the last six in a row. Since his first race, at
Guntersville, Ala., in 1963, Little has entered 354 unlimited races
and his boats won 134 of them.</TE>
<TE>   Villwock and Miss Budweiser never came close to No. 135 in the
five-lap final heat over the 2.5-mile Muncey Memorial course as the
big red boat never challenged the leaders. He finished fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Hanson, who won here in 1993 as the trailer boat, overcame
a fast start by Mitch Evans in the piston-powered Vacationville.com
to win the coveted Muncey Cup. Hanson was driving the white Sun
Harbor Mortgage. Nate Brown, in Miss Elam Plus, also passed Evans to
finish second.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first race this season not won by either Villwock or
Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "About the second or third lap, my brother Larry came on the radio
and said to tighten it up, so I started moving over on Vacationville
and I finally got by him coming off the fourth turn," said Hanson,
41, of Auburn, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Vacationville.com started on the pole after setting an all-time
piston-powered record of 160.370 mph on Saturday morning and for the
better part of two laps, the piston fans in the huge throng almost
drowned out the engines with their cheers.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Hopp gave spectators on East Vacation Isle, in front of the
unlimited pits, a nervous moment in a heat when his Miss American
Pride flipped on its side and rolled over, face down, as Hopp
attempted to negotiate the tight Sea World turn.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going about 200 [mph], trying to catch Mike Hanson when I
hit a wave and the boat teetered a bit. I thought I could save it,
but it just rolled over,'' said Hopp, 34, who climbed out an escape
hatch uninjured.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to say that Fred Leland builds one heck of a safety
cockpit. I guess it took me about 30 seconds to get out. It was an
unnerving feeling."</TE>
<TE>   It was also the second time that Hopp flipped at almost the same
spot. As a rookie unlimited driver, he went upside down in 1999.</TE>

<HD>Deadmarsh Happily Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BAKERSFIELD</DL>
<LD>Adam Deadmarsh is back in the Kings' lineup.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings would have loved to have heard those words last April,
when they were matched against the Colorado Avalanche in the
playoffs, but they'll settle for today after the frightening injury
that took the winger out of the first-round series.</LD>
<LD>   Seconds into the third period of Game 4 at Staples Center,
Deadmarsh suffered a torn disk in his neck when he crashed head first
into the end boards after losing his balance while trying to check
Avalanche defenseman Adam Foote.</LD>
<TE>   Though his status was listed as day to day for the rest of the
series, won by the Avalanche in seven games, Deadmarsh would not have
been able to play again even if the Kings had advanced to the Stanley
Cup finals.</TE>
<TE>   "The next day I knew it was bad, when I couldn't turn my head at
all," said Deadmarsh, who made his exhibition debut Sunday night in
the Kings' penalty-filled 3-2 victory over the Mighty Ducks in front
of about 5,500 at Centennial Garden. "When it first happened, I was a
little concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, going in like I did, I was actually feeling pretty
fortunate that I came out of it as well as I did. But the next day I
could really feel how it had tightened up and I knew that it wasn't
going to be a quick fix."</TE>
<TE>   For the next month, he couldn't turn his head, and it was another
two weeks after that before he could begin rehabilitating.</TE>
<TE>   "The big thing with that was time, to let the disk heal and let
the muscles around it relax so they weren't contracted," he said.
"After that, it was a little bit of strengthening."</TE>
<TE>   And now?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty much 100%," Deadmarsh said. "I don't know if it will
ever be as good as it was. There's always going to be some crackling
and crunching, just from joints riding a little rough in there, but
as far as the disk, it's all healed up."</TE>
<TE>   Deadmarsh's all-out style has made him a fan favorite but has also
led to a litany of injuries. Last season, however, he sat out only
six games while scoring 29 goals and establishing career highs of 33
assists and 62 points.</TE>
<TE>   "There weren't many nights when we were unhappy with him last
year," Coach Andy Murray said. "The reason he does tend to get hurt
is, it's the way he plays the game. But I don't think you can ask him
to play the game any differently.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe what you can ask him to do is to pay a little more
attention to his off-ice conditioning in the summer, and I think he
addressed that this summer."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eric Belanger scored a short-handed goal off a pass from Deadmarsh
with 10:34 to play, improving the Kings' exhibition record to 2-0....
The teams combined for 22 penalties and 66 penalty minutes.... The
game was delayed for nearly 25 minutes in the first period while an
arena crew replaced a shattered glass panel.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Crowe</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The easy observation: Youth is being served, maybe even catered
to, at Mighty Duck training camp. The reality: The team's prospects
just bring more ability to the table than in past seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Timo Parssinen, Jonas Ronnqvist and Antti-Jussi Niemi are all on
extended European vacations. The new models, such as Stanislav
Chistov, Alexei Smirnov and Kurt Sauer, may take up permanent
residency, if not now then in the future.</TE>
<TE>   The influx of young talent has put mid-level veterans on notice.
Left wing Denny Lambert, defenseman Jason York and left wing German
Titov were assigned to the minor league practice group last Monday.
The groups are expected to change for today's practices.</TE>
<TE>   "I did my best this week," said Titov, who scored a goal in the
Ducks' 4-2 exhibition victory over Phoenix on Saturday. "I worked
hard and showed I can play on this team."</TE>
<TE>   Whether that is enough remains to be seen. General Manager Bryan
Murray declined to say whether the three veterans are available to
other teams. But he did make it clear there will be changes.</TE>
<TE>   "We finished out of the playoffs by a lot last season," Murray
said. "We know the players who are going to make this team. But we
need to upgrade talent at the other spots. We are going to evaluate
everyone and we are not going to let salaries lock us in to anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Murray knows how talent-starved the Ducks were last season. He had
to use center Samuel Pahlsson and Parssinen on the first line with
Paul Kariya. Pahlsson may be the fifth center on the depth chart and
Parssinen has returned to Finland. Ronnqvist and Niemi have also
returned to their homelands.</TE>
<TE>   The talent upgrade has been evident with the younger players.
Chistov, Smirnov and Sauer have impressed Coach Mike Babcock.</TE>

<LD>The No. 1-seeded and Western Conference champion Galaxy will meet the

<HD>Williams Starts Slow, but Defeats Clijsters</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Top-seeded Serena Williams rebounded from a shaky start and defeated
Kim Clijsters, 2-6, 6-3, 6-3, Sunday to win the Toyota Princess Cup
at Tokyo.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, the world's No. 1 player, won her seventh title this
year and improved to 5-0 against the third-seeded Clijsters.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel great," Williams said. "It was a great final and I don't
think the tennis could have been any better than it was today.</LD>
<TE>   "Nobody can win every game. Kim played a very good first set and I
knew I just had to pick up my game in the second set. I told myself,
'If you don't start playing better, you're going to lose.' "</TE>
<TE>   Clijsters jumped to a 4-0 lead in the first set, taking advantage
of a series of unforced errors by Williams, who couldn't find her
rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who beat sister Venus earlier this month to win the U.S.
Open, picked up the pace in the second set. She broke Clijsters'
serve to go up, 5-3, and then served out to win the set.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just trying to find a way to get back into the match," said
Clijsters. "Just when you have a break point or something, she serves
an ace and that's what makes her such a great champion."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Elena Bovina of Russia won her second WTA Tour title, beating

<TE>   Jimmie Johnson held off a late rush by points leader Mark Martin
and tied the NASCAR Winston Cup record for victories by a rookie when
he got his third this season, winning the MBNA All-American Heroes
400 at Dover International Speedway in Dover, Del.</TE>
<TE>   The 27-year-old Californian matched Tony Stewart's 1999 mark for
victories by a first-year driver. Although he qualified 19th, Johnson
won the $3.9-million event by half a second over Martin.</TE>
<TE>   "These races are won by teamwork," Johnson said. "The top four
cars were so equal."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson took the lead for the final time on the 245th lap and
Martin closed within a few car lengths, but was never able to get
alongside him.</TE>
<TE>   "We could get to him but we'd lose the front end," Martin said.
"We put ourselves in a pitiful position Friday with a dumb qualifying
effort."</TE>
<TE>   Martin started 32nd in a field of 43. Martin, who claimed the
points lead a week earlier, is 30 points ahead of Johnson with eight
races left.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, the 48 was fast at the end, but our car was pretty good," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the 108th victory for Hendrick Motorsports, a four-car team
led by four-time series champion and four-time Dover winner Jeff
Gordon. He and Rick Hendrick are partners in the ownership of
Johnson's Chevrolet.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning of the year we just wanted to make races,"
Hendrick said. "I had no idea that with eight races to go that we'd
be in this position. He's a heck of a talent."</TE>
<TE>   After Martin's Ford came the Fords of Dale Jarrett and Matt
Kenseth. Stewart was fifth in a Pontiac.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Dixon raced to his eighth NHRA top fuel victory this season,
winning O'Reilly Mid-South Nationals at Memphis Motorsports Park in
Millington, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon beat Tony Schumacher with a quarter-mile run of 4.600
seconds at 318.69 mph. Schumacher finished in 4.798 at 286.64.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Pedregon and Jeg Coughlin also won their divisions.</TE>
<TE>   Pedregon raced to his career-high fifth funny car win this year,
beating Del Worsham at 4.909 and 315.12.</TE>
<TE>   Coughlin won the pro stock event, beating Gene Wilson at 6.849 and
200.80.</TE>
<TE>   College Soccer</TE>
<TE>   Host Loyola Marymount scored two second-half goals to upset No. 3
UCLA, 2-0, dealing the Bruins their first loss this season.</TE>
<TE>   Yugi Teranishi scored in the 53th minute and Michael Erush scored
on a penalty kick in the 82nd minute at Sullivan Field.</TE>

<KH>SAN FRANCISCO 20, WASHINGTON 10</KH>
<HD>49ers' Running Attack Is Fluid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>In the 48 hours before Sunday's game, a stomach virus infected nearly
a third of the San Francisco 49ers. Sparsely attended team meetings
were cut short, and some players wore surgical masks to avoid the
bug.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington Redskins had no such excuses for why their offense
still looks so sickly.</LD>
<LD>   Terrell Owens scored on a spectacular 38-yard run, and the 49ers
played stellar defense and rushed for 252 yards in a grinding 20-10
victory over the Redskins.</LD>
<TE>   Pro Bowl quarterback Jeff Garcia missed most of the second half
with a bad case, while other players were exhausted by halftime. The
49ers went through 20 bags of intravenous fluid before the game, and
more between halves.</TE>
<TE>   But the 49ers had their most prolific rushing game in nearly two
years--and Washington (1-2) gained only 41 yards while going
scoreless in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "When you've got so many guys down and out like we did, you've got
to stick to a simple game plan," said Garrison Hearst, who rushed for
97 yards. "We did the easy stuff. Just run it straight ahead and beat
them head-to-head."</TE>
<TE>   "We were a sick team to start, and became a banged-up team," 49er
Coach Steve Mariucci said. "This was one of the reasons I played it
very conservatively and safely."</TE>
<TE>   Though nobody on the 49ers (2-1) claimed to have thoughts of
revenge, it was a satisfying victory over the team that pounded them,
37-7, in an exhibition game in Japan seven weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Spurrier used his first-stringers longer than San Francisco
did in the exhibition game, but nothing helped the Washington coach
in the rematch.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier again yanked quarterback Shane Matthews for Danny
Wuerffel in the fourth quarter, but neither of his former Florida
stars could get the Redskins going, and Wuerffel had a pass
intercepted on the Redskins' final drive. Washington managed only 217
yards.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the whole team--don't put it all on the quarterbacks,"
Spurrier said.</TE>

<LD>Jeff Kent and Benito Santiago each hit solo home runs in the ninth
inning and the San Francisco Giants kept pushing toward the National
League wild-card slot, beating the Milwaukee Brewers, 3-1, Sunday at
Milwaukee.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants, who swept the three-game series at Miller Park and
have won five of six and 24 of their last 34, have a two-game lead
over the Dodgers for the wild card.</LD>
<LD>   Kirk Rueter limited Milwaukee to one run and three hits in seven
innings. His record remained 13-8, but the Giants are 11-0 in games
in which he starts and gets no decision.</LD>
<TE>   Felix Rodriguez (8-6) got one out for the victory. Robb Nen
pitched the ninth for his 41st save in 49 chances.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants return to Pacific Bell Park for five games, beginning
Tuesday against San Diego. If necessary, they will play a makeup game
at Atlanta on Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 4, Florida 1--Greg Maddux did something that hadn't been
accomplished in nearly 100 years, but it took John Smoltz only one
season to do his thing.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux joined Cy Young as the only pitchers to win 15 or more
games in 15 consecutive seasons, and Smoltz tied the NL record for
saves in a season as the Braves won at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Maddux (15-6) gave up four hits and one run in seven innings to
match the record set by Young from 1891-1905.</TE>
<TE>   Smoltz pitched a perfect ninth for his 53rd save in 57 chances,
tying the record shared by Randy Myers of the Chicago Cubs in 1993
and San Diego's Trevor Hoffman in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 5, New York 1--The Expos (79-77) have won eight of nine
and need three wins in their final six games to guarantee their first
winning season since 1996. The loss assured the Mets (74-81), last in
the NL East, of their worst record since 1996, when Manager Bobby
Valentine took over at the end of a 71-91 season.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 7, Houston 3--The Cardinals, who clinched the NL Central
on Friday, won two of three from the Astros at St. Louis and finished
the season 13-6 against them. In all, they've won 15 of their last
18. Chuck Finley (6-4) got his 199th victory.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, Chicago 4--Sammy Sosa singled in three at-bats at
Pittsburgh and still needs two homers in the Cubs' final six games
for 500 in his career and 50 for a record-setting fifth consecutive
season. Fred McGriff did set a home run record, hitting a two-run
shot that made him the first player with a 30-homer season for five
teams.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 4, Cincinnati 3--The Reds played their final home
game of the season, but couldn't avoid a three-game sweep in the
final series at Cinergy Field, which opened as Riverfront Stadium
with a loss in 1970 and ended the same way.</TE>

<HD>It's Another Defeat for Diamondbacks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Three consecutive losses coupled with three consecutive victories by
San Francisco have the Arizona Diamondbacks looking over their
shoulders.</LD>
<LD>   Todd Helton homered and drove in five runs, and the Colorado
Rockies beat the Diamondbacks, 11-7, Sunday at Coors Field to sweep
their three-game series, keeping Arizona's magic number at three for
clinching the National League West title.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco's third consecutive win, 3-1 over Milwaukee, reduced
the Diamondbacks' division lead to 4 1/2 games.</LD>
<TE>   Arizona's magic number for clinching at least a wild-card spot
remained at one after the Dodgers defeated San Diego, 4-3.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona reliever Mike Myers said he didn't sense any worry in the
Diamondbacks' clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "One win could turn it around for us. As bad as we played in this
series, this could be the best thing that could happen to this team,"
he said. "We're still loose and having fun."</TE>
<TE>   Said first baseman Mark Grace: "We're fine. All we've got to do is
win a couple of games. Hopefully, we'll right the ship in St. Louis
and do some damage."</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks open a three-game series at NL Central champion
St. Louis today, then play their final four games at home against the
Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   "Our magic number is three," Myers noted. "That's not much, not
with seven games left."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Bob Brenly said his team "didn't play well in any aspect
of the game in this series. But we'll be in St. Louis and we'll get
back after it again.</TE>
<TE>   "All you can do is forget about this one and move on. In the past,
we've been pretty good about letting bad games or bad series go and
moving on, and we're going to have to do it again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's Jay Payton went four for four, including a club
record-tying three doubles, and scored four runs, a career high.</TE>

<KH>GREEN BAY 37, DETROIT 31</KH>
<HD>Lions Give Packers a Tussle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The stadium and the quarterback were different. The result was the
same.</LD>
<LD>   For the second consecutive season, the Green Bay Packers built a
comfortable fourth-quarter lead on the road against the Detroit
Lions, but had to hold off a late comeback by a rookie quarterback to
win.</LD>
<LD>   Brett Favre threw for 357 yards and three touchdowns as Green Bay
beat the Lions, 37-31, Sunday, spoiling the first start by rookie
Joey Harrington and the first regular-season game at Ford Field.</LD>
<TE>   "I learned a long time ago: Don't ever pack it in and think it's
over," Favre said. "You just never know."</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay (2-1) led by 17 early in the final quarter, but Detroit
(0-3) scored two touchdowns, including a 52-yard pass play to James
Stewart with 1:37 left to cut the deficit to 34-31.</TE>
<TE>   An offside penalty negated the Lions' recovery of an onside kick,
and they were unable to recover their second attempt. Ryan Longwell's
47-yard field goal with 1:15 left put Green Bay ahead, 37-31.</TE>
<TE>   With the crowd chanting "Jo-ey! Jo-ey!" Harrington tried to direct
his first fourth-quarter comeback in the NFL, after doing so 10 times
at Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit got the ball at the Packer 48 with 1:03 left after two
offside penalties on Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   After throwing a 14-yard pass to Scotty Anderson, Harrington
lofted a pass just past Mikhael Ricks' fingers on what would have
been a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hoping he'd miss that," Favre said. "I didn't want to go
back out. I had enough."</TE>
<TE>   On the next play, Tod McBride intercepted Harrington's overthrown
pass at the Green Bay three with 30 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Last year at the Pontiac Silverdome, Mike McMahon led the Lions to
two touchdowns in the final seven minutes to scare the Packers before
losing, 29-27.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no consolation in this league," said Marty Mornhinweg,
who is 2-17 as Detroit's head coach.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington finished 15 for 35 for 182 yards with two touchdowns
and four interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "I did some good things. I did some bad things," Harrington said.
"It was a chance to grow. It will come."</TE>
<TE>   Favre completed 31 of 47 passes, and on his first of three
touchdown passes, he moved past Warren Moon for fourth on the NFL's
all-time list with 292.</TE>
<TE>   "If they have to lean on me, I don't mind," said Favre, who also
threw an interception and fumbled.</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay played without injured running back Ahman Green, out
with a quadriceps injury. Rookie Najeh Davenport ran for 84 yards in
22 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Bubba Franks caught nine passes--after catching one in the first
two games--for 62 yards and a touchdown. Donald Driver caught five
for 94 yards and a touchdown.</TE>

<KH>CAROLINA 21, MINNESOTA 14</KH>
<HD>They Take Exception to Low Expectations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>It's hard to tell how good Carolina is this early in the season, but
the Panthers are not surprised by their successful start.</LD>
<LD>   Lamar Smith carried 30 times for 154 yards and scored two
fourth-quarter touchdowns Sunday in Carolina's 21-14 victory over the
Minnesota Vikings.</LD>
<LD>   The Panthers are 3-0 for the first time since 1996.</LD>
<TE>   "Nobody really expected it, except for the people in this locker
room," said quarterback Rodney Peete, a surprise choice to be the
starter this year over Chris Weinke.</TE>
<TE>   Peete wasn't perfect, but the veteran from USC did his part,
completing 20 of 30 passes for 221 yards, with a touchdown and two
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers, 1-15 in 2001, played strong defense against a team
that scored 39 points last week. The Vikings, 0-3 for the first time
since 1967, had only 250 yards and turned the ball over four times.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys keep using that word surprised," first-year Coach John
Fox said. "Nothing surprises me. Am I pleased? Am I happy? Am I proud
of where our team is? Yes. But not surprised."</TE>
<TE>   Daunte Culpepper completed 19 of 30 passes for 191 yards, a
touchdown and a career-high four interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't get in sync," Culpepper said. "On offense, you've got
to be in rhythm. It's all about rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   Culpepper's frustrations were visible early in the fourth quarter.
He hopped up and down and yelled at Randy Moss on the sideline after
a third-down overthrow forced another punt.</TE>
<TE>   "Daunte just wants to win, just like any guy in his profession,"
said Moss, who had four catches for 16 yards. "I think he's just very
frustrated that we're sitting right now at 0-3."</TE>
<TE>   Deon Grant had three interceptions, the last coming on a heave by
Culpepper on the game's final play as boos resonated throughout the
emptying Metrodome.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew for a fact we were frustrating him," Grant said. "We were
disguising our coverages early and that got him confused."</TE>
<TE>   The Panthers trailed, 7-0, until late in the third quarter when
Steve Smith slipped behind Greg Biekert for a 14-yard touchdown
reception to tie it.</TE>
<TE>   Lamar Smith burst up the middle for a 12-yard touchdown run to
give the Panthers a 14-7 lead with 13:28 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings' next drive ended after two plays when Michael Bennett
had the ball stripped by Mark Fields, and Reggie Howard recovered it
at the Minnesota 48. Carolina got a touchdown nine plays later on a
24-yard run by Lamar Smith on third and 11.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing by 14, Culpepper drove the Vikings 89 yards in nine
plays--finishing with a four-yard touchdown pass to Chris Walsh in
traffic that cut it to 21-14 with 3:29 left.</TE>

<KH>NEW ENGLAND 41, KANSAS CITY 38 (OT)</KH>
<HD>When in Doubt, the Patriots Turn to Vinatieri</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FOXBORO, Mass.</DL>
<LD>The Patriots won't dominate every opponent. That's when they turn to
Adam Vinatieri.</LD>
<LD>   The Super Bowl hero kicked a 35-yard field goal 4:40 into overtime
Sunday, giving unbeaten New England a 41-38 victory over the Kansas
City Chiefs.</LD>
<LD>   "I go out there with the same mind-set," Vinatieri said, "if it is
the first quarter of the game or if it is the last minute of the
game."</LD>
<TE>   And he usually succeeds. He is eight for eight this season and has
converted his last 11 field-goal attempts, including a 48-yarder that
beat St. Louis in the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Brady was most valuable player in the Super Bowl, and he and
Troy Brown were the MVPs on Sunday before Vinatieri connected. Brady
completed 39 of 54 passes for 410 yards and four touchdowns, all
matching or establishing career highs.</TE>
<TE>   Brown set a Patriot record with 16 catches, totaling 176 yards.
But he watched the winning drive from the sideline because of a sore
knee after he hit it on a helmet. He didn't think he was seriously
hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't good for your heart, but I think it's good because it
builds your team," he said of the wild finish. "It gets you ready for
later in the season. We've got to learn how to win these games, how
to close them out."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots, playing without injured linebackers Tedy Bruschi and
Roman Phifer, gave up two touchdown runs to Priest Holmes in the last
five minutes of the fourth quarter. The Chiefs (1-2) tied the score
as time expired on Holmes' one-yard run and Morten Andersen's extra
point.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't make it much closer," Chief Coach Dick Vermeil said.
"We did enough things to win. We did enough bad things to lose."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots (3-0) won the coin toss in overtime and started at
their 30-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   Brady completed three of four passes, with a 22-yard play to David
Patten giving New England a first down at the Kansas City 22. Three
more plays gained five yards, then Vinatieri connected.</TE>
<TE>   "[He's] got ice in his veins. He's done it for us forever,"
Patriot linebacker Ted Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots didn't need dramatic finishes in their first two
games, beating Pittsburgh, 30-14, and the New York Jets, 44-7.</TE>
<TE>   And it seemed they wouldn't need one as Brady and Brown picked on
the NFL's second-worst pass defense.</TE>
<TE>   However, Kansas City got 180 yards rushing from Holmes, who also
caught one of Trent Green's three touchdown passes.</TE>
<TE>   The others went to Eddie Kennison.</TE>
<TE>   "We proved something to ourselves and to the NFL," Holmes said.
"Other teams can see how we were able to expose" the Patriot
weaknesses.</TE>
<TE>   New England, favored for the first time in six games, won its
first three games for the fifth time in its history.</TE>

<LD>Patience could be the key to finding a winner in today's CTBA Marian
Stakes.</LD>
<LD>   The pace figures to be hot and heavy in this mile-and-a-sixteenth
event, and Shalini and Barely Daylight figure to save their best for
last and battle it out when it counts.</LD>
<LD>   Both of these fillies are coming off the Aug. 29 grass event at
Del Mar, and while Barely Delight won that day and Shalini had to
settle for a close fourth-place finish, the tables could turn under
these conditions. Shalini's biggest advantage may be that she's the
only member of the cast to race around these tight turns, and the
result was a seven-length victory in her debut last season. While she
was trying to make up ground behind a sluggish pace in that last try,
the fractions should be swift here, and the table will be set for
late heroics under Scott Stevens.</LD>
<TE>   Barely Daylight is another who loves to play track-and-attack, and
she arrives razor sharp for Caesar Dominguez. Although her last three
starts have come over the turf, including that dead-heat decision
last month, she broke her maiden over the dirt at Hollywood Park and
looms large with Matt Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   The most interesting jockey angle in the CTBA Marian revolves
around Tyler Baze, who has been the regular rider for Shalini but now
shows up on Ladylore for trainer Bill Spawr. Her last couple of
efforts at Del Mar were poor, but she's the only stakes winner in the
field, having upset the Melair at 30-1 in late April, and she's
another with the preferred closing style.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Whos On Third 2. Twilight Career 3. Larose 4.
Fortifier 5. Chinois 6. Rhythm And Bloom 7. Song Of Bernadette 8.
Osho 9. Shalini 10. Flom N X S.</TE>

<KH>NEW ORLEANS 29, CHICAGO 23</KH>
<HD>Saints Can Play the Hole Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHAMPAIGN, Ill.</DL>
<LD>The New Orleans Saints wouldn't go away, even when it appeared they
would be blown out. That's why they're still unbeaten.</LD>
<LD>   "You never want to put yourself in that kind of a hole, but with
the way we can score, we don't think we're out of it," quarterback
Aaron Brooks said after the Saints rallied from a 20-0 deficit to
beat the Chicago Bears, 29-23, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "It's tough when you're down 20-0, especially in the NFL," Brooks
said. "We were lucky we didn't get blown out. We could have been down
28-0 at the half."</LD>
<TE>   Instead, the Saints (3-0) got back in the game by scoring two
touchdowns in a 58-second span in the second quarter and got the
decisive touchdown when Donte' Stallworth made a great move to score
on a 29-yard pass play from Brooks with 1:11 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Knight then stopped a last-second Bear drive by intercepting
a pass by Jim Miller at the goal line. Chicago (2-1) had won its 12
previous games decided by a touchdown or less.</TE>
<TE>   "It shouldn't have come down to the way it did," Miller said. "The
play didn't develop. If you let it develop any longer the clock runs
out, so either I've got to throw it out of the end zone or throw it
quick."</TE>
<TE>   On the winning drive, Brooks had a 14-yard scramble and 11-yard
completion to Joe Horn to the Bear 31. On second down, Stallworth
caught the pass near the sideline, got around defensive back Reggie
Austin and coasted into the end zone to make it 27-23. Brooks then
ran in for two points.</TE>
<TE>   "They left me one-on-one on the corner and I got past him and then
I wasn't stopping. I kind of knew he was going to miss his tackle
because he jumped way outside," Stallworth said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was my man. He ran an out route and I missed the tackle," said
Austin, who had an interception in his first career start. "I have to
make that tackle. Nine times out of 10, I make that play."</TE>
<TE>   The Bears drove to the Saint 18 when Miller threw to Marty Booker
for a 19-yard gain and, after using his team's final timeout, passed
to Dez White for 18 yards.</TE>
<TE>   After spiking the ball to stop the clock, Miller threw into a
crowd at the front of the end zone and Knight intercepted with two
seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 20-0, after a host of mistakes, the Saints quickly
regrouped with the two touchdowns, the second coming after Chicago's
Leon Johnson fumbled a kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   "We came in at halftime down 20-14 and the guys knew we were going
to win the game," New Orleans Coach Jim Haslett said.</TE>
<TE>   The Saints took the lead with an 84-yard drive to start the second
half. Brooks had a 24-yard completion to Jerome Pathon and capped the
march with a five-yard pass play to Horn.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Edinger's third field goal, a 25-yarder with 8:47 left, gave
Chicago a 23-21 lead before Brooks led the Saints to the decisive
touchdown on the seven-play, 73-yard drive.</TE>

<HD>A Tough Afternoon in Carter's Education</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At halftime of Sunday's Cowboy-Eagle game, Quincy Carter had an
ever-so-slight edge over Donovan McNabb in quarterback rating for the
game: 100.9 to 100.8.</LD>
<LD>   Then came the second half.</LD>
<LD>   Philadelphia turned their 20-10 halftime lead into a 44-13 victory
over the Cowboys, demonstrating that Dallas and its fledgling
quarterback have a long way to go.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought Quincy looked good for most of the day," Emmitt Smith
said. "Until the pressure got to him."</TE>
<TE>   The pressure has been on Carter since he was drafted in the second
round a year ago and was handed the starting quarterback job on a
high-profile team after the retirement of Troy Aikman.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb was the No. 2 overall pick in the 1999 draft and is
arguably the best quarterback in a draft in which five were taken in
the first round.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb sat and watched veteran Doug Pederson quarterback a bad
team, getting in games in dribs and drabs for the first half of the
season. He didn't start until the 10th game of his rookie season on a
team that finished 5-11.</TE>
<TE>   Carter was thrown in from Day One--a message emphasized when Tony
Banks, Dallas' only veteran quarterback on the roster, was cut in
training camp.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my 11th start," Carter said Sunday. "I don't think
Donovan was what he is now after his 11th start."</TE>
<TE>   What McNabb was Sunday was this: 24 for 37 for 287 yards and three
touchdowns, plus six carries for 67 yards. Carter was 11 for 14 for
115 yards in the first half, then self-destructed in the second half,
fumbling twice and throwing an interception when he tried to loft the
ball on a fade route.</TE>
<TE>   "That was on me but it's not something that can't happen to any
quarterback," Carter said. "I was starting to throw, my hand was wet,
I got hit and the ball just slipped out. A lot better guys than I am
have had that happen to them."</TE>
<TE>   McNabb's rating at the end of Sunday's game was 115.5. Carter's
was 64.1.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Key injuries in Week 3:</TE>
<TE>   * Charger linebacker Junior Seau was helped to the locker room
after he sprained his right ankle late in the Chargers' 23-15 win
against Arizona, but Seau does not think the injury is serious.</TE>
<TE>   * Arizona cornerback Duane Starks left the game against San Diego
with a groin injury and San Diego center Cory Raymer left with an
injured left Achilles' tendon.</TE>
<TE>   * Troy Brown left New England's game against Kansas City after
taking a hit to his knee, ending his chance to set the NFL record for
receptions.</TE>
<TE>   * Detroit linebacker Brian Williams injured his right ankle, which
might be broken.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former NFL linebacker Wayne Simmons, who died last month in a
one-car accident at Independence, Mo., had a blood alcohol level more
than twice the state's legal limit at the time of the crash.</TE>
<TE>   The Jackson County Medical Examiner said Simmons had a blood
alcohol level of 0.19 when he was killed Aug. 23. The legal blood
alcohol limit in Missouri is 0.08.</TE>

<KH>SOCCER LISA DILLMAN</KH>
<HD>Some Facts to Kick Around</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It only seemed as though every touch, every corner kick, every
offside call (was it or wasn't it?) was evaluated to the nth degree
at the World Cup, not only on sporting standards, but nationalistic
and societal ones.</LD>
<LD>   But class isn't over.</LD>
<LD>   It never really is in soccer. Fewer than three months after the
completion of the World Cup comes the publication of a soccer bible
for technophiles--the FIFA Technical Report, compiled, in part, by
experts who attended and analyzed all 64 games and evaluated 32
teams.</LD>
<TE>   Each expert, such as former Brazil national coach Carlos Alberto
Parreira, were accompanied by two assistants at every game. Among the
statistical conclusions:</TE>
<TE>   * Twenty percent of the goals came from rapid counter attacks.</TE>
<TE>   * One-fifth of the 161 goals scored were a result of solo runs.</TE>
<TE>   * Thirty percent of the goals came from set pieces, such as corner
kicks and free kicks.</TE>
<TE>   Tactical flexibility was cited as the "decisive factor" in several
games. All good reading, certainly, but among the statistical surveys
and breakdowns remain several lingering questions from certain
countries:</TE>
<TE>   * From Italy: One more time, what was in the mind of that muddled
man, referee Byron Moreno, who disallowed what should have been World
Cup goal No. 162, sent off Italian striker Francesco Totti and sent
South Korea into the quarterfinals?</TE>
<TE>   * From Spain: How about a definition of out of bounds? Does that
include the touchline?</TE>
<TE>   * From the United States: Never mind the German handball in the
box. Does being involved in a soccer controversy mean acceptance?</TE>
<TE>   * From Ireland: Does "tactical flexibility" include tactical
inability to place penalty kicks between the two Spanish goalposts?</TE>
<TE>   * From Saudi Arabia: We thought those German goals we gave up, all
eight of them, came on headers.</TE>
<TE>   Akers Honored</TE>
<TE>   One of the unfortunate aspects about soccer pioneer Michelle
Akers' retirement is that she was not able to play in the fledgling
Women's United Soccer Assn., despite being one of its founding
members.</TE>
<TE>   Akers, however, received medical clearance recently and put her
cleats on again, playing in the first half of an exhibition game
between the Boston Breakers and the Washington Freedom on Sept. 14 at
Boston. The member of two World Cup and one gold-medal winning
national teams wore No. 10 and played for the Breakers.</TE>
<TE>   The testimonial included halftime presentations and a 20-minute
video tribute to Akers.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Akers and University of Portland Coach Clive Charles
were honored by WUSA on Thursday, given Lifetime Achievement Awards
at the league's dinner in Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Camp Heinrichs</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-eight players, most of them with WUSA experience, have been
invited to training camp in Long Island before the opener of the Nike
U.S. Women's Cup Sunday, when the U.S. plays Russia.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Coach April Heinrichs also selected three standouts from the
FIFA Under-19 Women's World Championships in Canada: midfielder Lori
Chalupny and forward Lindsay Tarpley of the University of North
Carolina and Heather O'Reilly, a high school senior from East
Brunswick, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The roster will be trimmed to 18 for the three games against
Russia, Australia (Oct. 2) and Italy (Oct. 6).</TE>
<TE>   Trading Places</TE>
<TE>   Six years of silence, apparently, were too much for a Brazilian
soccer player. Luciano, the man formerly known as Eriberto, came
forward and admitted he shaved four years off his age and used
another identity. He is now 27.</TE>
<TE>   The deception started when he played club football in Brazil and
continued when he moved to the Italian club Bologna and eventually
switched to AC Chievo Verona.</TE>
<TE>   Italian soccer officials suspended him after his admission and
soccer's governing body, FIFA, announced on its Web site that the
player has been suspended, pending an inquiry into the "exact
conditions under which the alleged behavior took place."</TE>
<TE>   He confessed in an interview with an Italian newspaper, admitting
the scheme was hatched out of desperation to start a soccer career.</TE>
<TE>   Go Fish</TE>
<TE>   So much for playing to put food on the table.</TE>
<TE>   In Norway, it is "Will strike for shrimp."</TE>
<TE>   Norwegian striker Kenneth Kristensen will have his weight, and
worth, measured in shrimp. He is being sold from Vindbjart to Floey
for fresh shrimp. No kidding. The weigh-in was Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "No problem. We got enough shrimps," Floey chairman Rolf
Guttormsen told the Norwegian newspaper Faedrelandsvennen.</TE>
<TE>   Notable</TE>
<TE>   Franco Scoglio, the former Libyan national coach, told the Italian
newspaper Corriere dello Sports that he was fired because he refused
to play Al-Saadi Kadafi,  the son of Moammar Kadafi, the Libyan
leader and head of the Libyan Football Federation.</TE>
<TE>   "As a footballer he's worthless," Scoglio told the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Newcastle striker Craig Bellamy faces possible UEFA disciplinary
action after appearing to headbutt Dynamo Kiev's Tiberiu Ghioane near
the end of Wednesday's Group E Champions League game.</TE>
<TE>   There was no call on the play, and a decision on any disciplinary
action, will be made by Wednesday.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Led by Wendy Ward's surprising performance against No. 1-ranked
Annika Sorenstam, the United States came from two matches down to
defeat Europe, 15 1/2-12 1/2, Sunday and win the LPGA Solheim Cup at
Edina, Minn.</LD>
<LD>   When Karine Icher missed a short putt on the 15th hole in her
match against Rosie Jones, the Americans were assured of the 14
points they needed to win the event.</LD>
<LD>   "They put out every single ounce of effort they had today," team
captain Patty Sheehan said. "These ladies have so much heart and
guts."</LD>
<TE>   No one played tougher than Ward. Ranked 56th on the LPGA money
list, she halved her match and could have won had she sunk a
four-foot putt on the 18th hole.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt if we could get Annika's match to turn, we could have
done something," European captain Dale Reid said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. got off to a hot start with wins in the first three
matches by Juli Inkster, Laura Diaz and Emilee Klein.</TE>

<LD>The Angels, right now, are like whiny kids in the back seat,

<LD>   For another day, the champagne bottles were a mirage on the

The Angels flew to Texas after Sunday's 3-2 loss to the Seattle
Mariners, pondering another two days of waiting instead of
celebrating at 35,000 feet.</LD>
<TE>   "We'd all like to get it over with," infielder Scott Spiezio said.</TE>
<TE>   They almost certainly will, and never mind those hardened Angel
fans bracing for another collapse, freaking out about the possibility
of another one-game playoff in Seattle. For the Angels to be forced
into a wild-card playoff, they would have to lose all six remaining
games while the Mariners win all six games or the Boston Red Sox win
all seven.</TE>
<TE>   On paper, the Angels should clinch Tuesday, after a day off. They
face Texas rookie Joaquin Benoit, making his 13th major league start.</TE>
<TE>   But, on paper, the Angels should have clinched Sunday. They faced
Seattle's Ryan Franklin, making his 11th major league start.</TE>
<TE>   They got six hits off Franklin. Seattle rookie Willie Bloomquist
got four by himself--the first four hits of his major league
career--driving in two of the Mariners' runs and scoring the third.</TE>
<TE>   This is not exactly a playoff drive with momentum. The Angels have
lost five of seven games on this trip. They have scored more than
four runs once. Garret Anderson is hitting .208 on the trip, David
Eckstein .207, Troy Glaus .167, Adam Kennedy .150 and Bengie Molina
.118.</TE>
<TE>   The sooner the Angels clinch, the better, so they can give the
guys playing every day a rest. And, suggested hitting coach Mickey
Hatcher, the guys playing every day have hit a wall.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the guys are burned out," Hatcher said. "I think they
really need a day off. They've busted their butts to get us to this
point. This off day is very important.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to get it over with. I know, when I was going through
that, I couldn't sleep. You just want to get it over with."</TE>
<TE>   The players weren't so sure that pennant anticipation translated
into anxiety, though the Angels produced an uncharacteristically
sloppy performance Sunday. Kennedy muffed a ground ball, Spiezio
slipped and fell trying to track a ground ball in the shadows, Brad
Fullmer was trapped off second base and tagged out after a
comebacker, and Jarrod Washburn threw a wild pitch that led to a
Seattle run.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were anxious up to this point, it'll go away now," Kennedy
said. "Maybe we were a little anxious to get it out of the way."</TE>
<TE>   Said Washburn: "I don't think we were pressing. The Mariners are a
great team."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Mariners won their 90th game. In the National League,
they would be tied with the San Francisco Giants for the wild-card
lead. In the American League, they'll become the second team since
the wild-card format was adopted in 1994 to win 90 games and not make
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn (18-6) lost despite holding the Mariners to three runs
over 6 1/3 innings. With one start left, he must wait until next year
to try to become the Angels' first 20-game winner since Nolan Ryan in
1974.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course I'm disappointed," Washburn said. "But I don't care. I
just want to get to the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   They will, almost certainly, as the wild card. Oakland won again
Sunday, so the Angels would have to go 5-1 and the A's 1-5 for the
Angels to win the AL West title.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners consoled themselves with the fact that the Angels did
not clinch here. "Let them do it in Texas," Mariner Manager Lou
Piniella said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels desperately want to win Tuesday, to jump and hug and
scream on the field rather than retreat to the clubhouse television
to see whether the Mariners lose to Oakland. It's a simple task, if
not an easy one.</TE>
<TE>   "All we have to do," Washburn said, "is win one game."</TE>

<LD>Frank Fitzpatrick of the Philadelphia Inquirer on Veterans Stadium,
which is in its final season as the home of the Eagles:</LD>
<LD>   "It's cold and bland. A lot like the millions of overpriced hot
dogs sold there through the years.</LD>
<LD>   "It was built without much imagination or foresight. A lot like
the offenses displayed by some of the bad Eagle teams that called the
place home."</LD>
<TE>   After 32 seasons in Veterans Stadium, the Eagles will move across
the street next season, into the state-of-the-art Lincoln Financial
Field.</TE>
<TE>   The Vet, as the South Philadelphia eyesore is known, will be
demolished after baseball's Phillies complete the 2003 season.</TE>
<TE>   Seat licenses for lower-level tickets in the new stadium will cost
between $1,800 and $3,200 for the right to buy tickets in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Fitzpatrick: "Goodbye, Joe Six-pack."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Name the first manager to guide the Angels into the
postseason.</TE>
<TE>   Divorce court: Texas' 41-11 victory over Houston on Saturday gave
the Longhorns a 142-37 edge in scoring against the Cougars over the
last three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Houston Chronicle columnist Fran Blinebury: "That isn't a
rivalry between former Southwest Conference cousins. It's an abusive
relationship."</TE>
<TE>   Bad team, man: Shaun Powell of Newsday doesn't see a connection
between the New York Mets' shabby play this season and recent
allegations of marijuana use by several players.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mets sit at the bottom of the National League East because
they stink, not because they're stoned," Powell wrote. "If a handful
of Mets did get the munchies this year, they only built an appetite
for making errors.</TE>
<TE>   "My hunch is the rats still outnumber the roaches at Shea
Stadium."</TE>
<TE>   Bad timing: According to recent reports, an unnamed NHL team
offered Teemu Selanne a contract this summer that was $1 million more
than his team, the San Jose Sharks, was offering.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble was, the call came while Selanne was playing in a
celebrity soccer match in his native Finland. Selanne declined the
take-it-or-leave-it offer, hanging up his cell phone and returning to
the soccer game.</TE>
<TE>   Careful what you wish for: Responding to Fernando Vargas'
pre-fight comment that he would "rather die in that ring than lose"
to Oscar De La Hoya, Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, many of the cherished brawlers of boxing history have
ended their careers, and lives, punch drunk, near-broke and in
constant need of medical assistance."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas lost the Sept. 14 fight, suffering a severe cut under his
right eye.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Jim Fregosi, in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Almost every Angel fan recalls Dave Henderson's
two-run homer for the Boston Red Sox with the Angels one strike away
from the 1986 World Series.</TE>
<TE>   But do they remember John Lowenstein's game-winning, three-run
homer in the 11th inning for the Baltimore Orioles in Game 1 of the
1979 American League playoffs?</TE>
<TE>   Lowenstein's homer, against reliever John Montague, propelled the
Orioles to a 6-3 victory and a 3-1 series victory over the Angels.</TE>

<LD>   What: "A Teen's Game Plan for Life"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Lou Holtz</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Sorin Books</TE>
<TE>   Price: $14.95</TE>
<TE>   When Lou Holtz was a teenager in Ohio, he and a group of friends
used to swim in the Ohio River where it crossed into Chester, W.Va.</TE>
<TE>   One day they decided to swim across the river, a distance of one
mile. Holtz's best friend didn't think he could make it, so Holtz
promised he would save him if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, the friend began hollering for help about
three-quarters of the way across. So what did Holtz do?</TE>
<TE>   "I did the same thing you might have done if you were in my
situation," Holtz writes. "I tried to pretend I couldn't hear him."</TE>
<TE>   The friend turned around and swam back.</TE>
<TE>   "He ended up swimming a mile and a half because deep down he
didn't believe that he could swim across the river," Holtz writes.
"He didn't believe strongly enough in himself. He had an excuse not
to succeed."</TE>
<TE>   This is only one of the lessons that Holtz delivers.</TE>
<TE>   Holtz became nationally known for his wit and storytelling ability
after he became Notre Dame's football coach in 1986. Holtz, who is
now at South Carolina, draws on his wit along with his life
experiences and his experiences from coaching young men at six
universities to create a game plan for teens.</TE>
<TE>   The book may be directed at teens but is good reading for all
ages.</TE>

<HD>Fever Stays With Dodgers</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They maintain playoff hopes with 4-3 victory over
Padres. L.A is two games back of Giants with six left.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers hopped and skipped single file into their clubhouse at
Qualcomm Stadium late Sunday afternoon singing "Stayin' Alive!
Stayin' Alive."</LD>
<LD>   First baseman Eric Karros, a wide grin spread across his face,
yelled out, "We live to breathe another day."</LD>
<LD>   The mood was considerably different in that clubhouse 3 1/2 hours
earlier. The Dodgers were watching with deep disappointment as the
San Francisco Giants, two games ahead in the wild-card race, defeated
the Milwaukee Brewers.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodger mood hadn't been much better in their dugout 90 minutes
later when the San Diego Padres surged ahead of them, powered by two
Mark Kotsay home runs.</TE>
<TE>   But as they had done the day before, the Dodgers fought back, this
time with runs in the sixth, seventh and ninth innings to pull out a
4-3 victory and keep pace with the Giants with six games to play.</TE>
<TE>   With Dave Roberts sidelined because of a strained muscle on his
right side and Marquis Grissom in his place in center field, the
crucial at-bat in the ninth came down to Mike Kinkade, who tore up
the Pacific Coast League before being called up in July.</TE>
<TE>   But this is the big leagues, the closing day of a playoff chase
and, suddenly, the season, at least for the moment, was in the hands
of the new kid on the block.</TE>
<TE>   Nerves?</TE>
<TE>   Dodger outfielder Brian Jordan said he has never seen the kid show
any signs of tension.</TE>
<TE>   So what was Kinkade feeling?</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty exciting," he said. "To me, it's like an adrenaline
rush."</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied and one out in the inning, Mark Grudzielanek
singled to center. Even though he had only two stolen bases in 144
games before Sunday, Grudzielanek took off with two strikes on Alex
Cora. Cora struck out but Grudzielanek was safe.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a big play that kind of gets lost," Karros said.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy sent up the Dodgers' premier pinch-hitter, the
left-handed hitting Dave Hansen. San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy
countered by removing right-hander Jonathan Johnson (1-2) and
bringing in left-hander Kevin Walker.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen may be the Dodgers' all-time leading pinch-hitter, but
Tracy didn't hesitate.</TE>
<TE>   Even with a potential season-deciding game on the line, he called
back Hansen and sent in Kinkade.</TE>
<TE>   The count went to 3-and-2.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt with Grissom coming up behind me, they were going to pitch
to me," Kinkade said. "I was just looking for anything I could put a
bat on."</TE>
<TE>   Kinkade got a fastball and lined it into center field. Kotsay
fielded the ball cleanly and threw a one-bounce strike to catcher Wil
Nieves, but as Nieves turned to make the tag, Grudzielanek's left leg
had already swept across the plate.</TE>
<TE>   What made the comeback all the more euphoric was how dismally the
game had begun for the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Kotsay hit the first pitch from Omar Daal into the right-field
seats for his 15th home run. Deivi Cruz followed with a double into
the right-field corner. Phil Nevin then punched a run-scoring single
to center.</TE>
<TE>   Three batters, seven pitches, two runs across and Tracy, with an
injury-ridden pitching staff, having little option but to go with
Daal as far as he could.</TE>
<TE>   In the third inning, the Dodgers got on the scoreboard when Paul
Lo Duca doubled home Cora, who had walked and been sacrificed to
second.</TE>
<TE>   In the bottom of the third, acting more like Mark McGwire than
Mark Kotsay, the Padre center fielder smacked his 16th homer.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers got one run back in the sixth after singles by
Grissom, Shawn Green and Jordan loaded the bases. Karros hit a fly
deep to center to get Grissom home.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers might have gotten more but Green was caught off second
and, after a marathon rundown that included eight Padres--just your
average 2-4-5-6-1-4-2-3 play--he was tagged out.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just hoping to run into somebody," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   Cora's fifth home run in the seventh inning tied the game.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Quantrill (5-4) got the victory and Eric Gagne came on in the
ninth to extend his club record with his 51st save.</TE>
<TE>   "If we lose this game," Karros said, "we are done. Not
mathematically, but it's not looking good."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they are stayin' alive.</TE>

<HD>Dolphins Find Running Mate</HD>
<DH>Pro football: With Williams reviving long-absent ground
game, Miami finally beats Jets and is 3-0.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>The streak is dead, and Ricky Williams couldn't feel more alive.</LD>
<LD>   Miami's reborn running back rushed for 151 yards Sunday--including
a career-long 53-yard touchdown--leading the Dolphins to a 30-3
victory over the New York Jets and ending an eight-game losing streak
to the men in green.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, whose personal and professional life hit the skids in
New Orleans, is now helping to usher in a new era in Dolphin
football. This franchise, which is 3-0 for the first time in five
seasons, finally has a ground game to match its traditionally strong
passing attack and defense.</LD>
<TE>   "He's the complete package--a combination of speed with size and
strength," Jet safety John McGraw said. "That makes him very hard to
tackle. He's a completely new running back from what I remember of
him a few years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Once among the league's most peculiar players--a guy who wouldn't
remove his helmet for interviews--Williams is happier and far more
confident in Miami. He was diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder
last season and now takes medication for that, something he says has
improved his life immeasurably. It doesn't hurt, of course, that he's
treated like royalty in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "In New Orleans they appreciate football, but I didn't get this
kind of treatment," said Williams, the first player in Dolphin
history to record three consecutive 100-yard rushing games. "Here,
I'm treated like a superstar."</TE>
<TE>   He gets the best tables in restaurants and almost never gets stuck
with the tab. He gets the VIP treatment at South Beach nightclubs.
And Sunday, with Jet players falling all around him, he helped
himself to generous gulps of yardage. He's better known for his
quickness and power than his speed, so when he burst up the middle on
his long touchdown run and didn't get caught from behind, it was a
sure sign the Jet defense was done.</TE>
<TE>   Put simply by New York defensive tackle Jason Ferguson: "We were
on the field too long."</TE>
<TE>   Already, it has been an agonizingly long September for the Jets,
who needed overtime to beat Buffalo in the opener, then collapsed in
a 44-7 loss to New England at the Meadowlands. Coach Herman Edwards
tore into his team with a 10-minute tirade Wednesday--using the word
"embarrassed" no fewer than a dozen times--but it clearly didn't do
the trick.</TE>
<TE>   "We're probably a little shaky right now," said Edwards,
straddling football's version of the San Andreas fault. "I told them
after the game we have to hang together. All we have is us."</TE>
<TE>   On this day, "us" was ugly. Vinny Testaverde threw for 125 yards
with two interceptions and was sacked twice. Pro Bowl running back
Curtis Martin gained 43 yards in 16 carries, after coming into the
game averaging 1.4 yards a carry.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say this is the lowest point, but it's a very low
point," said Martin, part of an offense that was outgained 394 yards
to 189. "It's just a storm we have to weather right now.... I don't
know what the problem is. I don't know why we aren't playing the way
we should be playing."</TE>
<TE>   The Jets, who had not lost to the Dolphins since 1997 and had
scored no fewer than 20 points in every game against them since 1995,
could muster only a field goal.</TE>
<TE>   But, through three quarters, the outcome was in question. Olindo
Mare kicked a field goal early in the fourth quarter to give Miami a
16-3 lead, and by that time the Jets were wilting in the sticky heat.
On Miami's next possession, Williams pounded the defense with four
consecutive carries, took a one-play break, then bolted up the middle
for his 53-yard touchdown. His understudy, Travis Minor, finished the
scoring with a five-yard touchdown run with two minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Fiedler, who entered the game with a league-best 123.8
quarterback rating, completed 16 of 30 passes for 185 yards and a
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Randy McMichael had five catches and wide receiver Chris
Chambers had four. But the most spectacular catch of the day was made
by Oronde Gadsden, the onetime arena league player, who made a
leaping, one-handed grab over the middle for a 23-yard gain that
brought the crowd of 73,426 to its feet.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been doing that his whole career," Fiedler said. "You see
that big mitt come out of the sky and just snag it down."</TE>
<TE>   If only the Dolphins could so effortlessly snare the respect of
the NFL world. For so long, their lack of a running game has made
them a two-legged stool, a team that does reasonably well during the
regular season and often makes the playoffs, but doesn't have enough
firepower to compete with the league's best teams.</TE>
<TE>   That's changing. The way Miami guard Jamie Nails sees it, his
undefeated team is long overdue for some national respect.</TE>
<TE>   Said Nails: "I was watching 'Inside the NFL' on HBO last night.
We're 2-0, and they just barely talked about us. So obviously people
haven't noticed yet that we have something special going on. But once
they realize that, things will change."</TE>
<TE>   Things already have changed for Williams. He pulled up at a
stoplight recently, and a man selling flowers recognized him. The man
politely tapped on the car window, Williams rolled it down and was
handed a free flower, a simple gesture of thanks.</TE>
<TE>   Today, a free flower in his hand. Tomorrow, rose petals at his
feet.</TE>

<HD>Zook Gets Off the Hook for Now on Web Site</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sunday, weary after a long haul on the Internet turnpike, I pulled
off the information super highway into the travel plaza at
www.FireRonZook.com.</LD>
<LD>   I was interested in the usual: giant key to the rest room, stick
of beef jerky, maybe a college football column lead.</LD>
<LD>   Shockingly, as of 7 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, the site had not
been updated in the wake of the first-year Florida coach's stunning
30-13 victory against Tennessee at Knoxville, Tenn.</LD>
<TE>   There was no posting of Ron Zook having improved to 3-1 or details
depicting how the win put the Gators back in the national title
chase.</TE>
<TE>   Shoot, there was zilch on Zook becoming the first first-year
Florida coach to defeat a ranked school on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Zook.com on Sunday afternoon was A Wild Web West ghost town, a
"Twilight Zone" episode where time had stopped--the only thing
missing was a tumbleweed blowing across the computer screen.</TE>
<TE>   The page was almost eerily frozen on the date 9-17-2002, four days
before Florida played at Tennessee. Maybe the Web head was hung over
after the Gators' big win?</TE>
<TE>   The Webmaster does not reveal his identity but assures us he is a
Florida alumnus with the program's best interest at heart. He reveals
himself only as a paper bag with holes cut in the eyes and
mouth--remember the Unknown Comic?</TE>
<TE>   "Most Gator fans own shotguns, just in case you were wondering
about the bag," the author states.</TE>
<TE>   In his standing editorial posting, the site operator vows he will
not rest until "the sweet sound of Zook's resignation hits the AP
newswire."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the only thing Associated Press was reporting
Sunday was how Florida had jumped three spots, from No. 10 to No. 7,
in this week's poll.</TE>
<TE>   You know how badly that can screw up a coach-ousting campaign?</TE>
<TE>   The point here is to point out how incredibly over-the-top the
sport has become, fueled by big money, a 12-cylinder Internet engine
and unreal expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone feels it--players, coaches, athletic directors. Gator
Athletic Director Jeremy Foley, the man on the hook for hiring Zook,
might have reacted to the win over Tennessee with the demeanor
befitting a representative of higher education.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he sounded like skateboarder Tony Hawk.</TE>
<TE>   "Freakin' awesome," Foley told reporters. "I'm not going to lie to
you."</TE>
<TE>   It's true that Zook, in attempting to replace the tribal god Steve
Spurrier, had stumbled to a 2-1 start that included a home loss to
Miami, the defending national champion. For what it's worth, on
Saturday, Boston College became the 26th consecutive team to lose to
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, this is the grim, shout-it-out reality of our sports culture;
and there is nothing as bipolar as football mood swings.</TE>
<TE>   You'd think people would give their coach a fighting chance--at
least allow time for the paint to dry on his parking spot--but that's
not how it works. College football Saturdays have become isolated and
independent novellas of terrible or terrific.</TE>
<TE>   Zook, obviously, was a horrible coach against Miami and Knute
Rockne against Tennessee--nothing is taken as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   If not for a few bounces, first-year Notre Dame Coach Tyrone
Willingham might be 2-2 instead of 4-0 and not leading premature talk
of a national title--it is that fine of a line.</TE>
<TE>   California's Jeff Tedford was a genius after leading Cal to 3-0;
no one was chanting "Einstein" after Saturday's loss to Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   How about we give these coaches some time to marinate?</TE>
<TE>   I, for one, am perfectly willing to see how Florida fares next
week against Kentucky before rendering final judgment on Zook.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend Wrap</TE>
<TE>   The experts could have been only a year off in hyping the
Oregon-Oregon State revivals. The Oregons are a combined 8-0 and the
only unbeaten teams remaining in the Pacific 10 Conference. Neither
school has played a ranked team yet, but No. 9 Oregon appears to be
solid despite the departure of Joey Harrington while No. 23 Oregon
State looks ferocious headed toward USC. Memo to USC quarterback
Carson Palmer: The Beavers have intercepted 11 passes. Oregon State
has the swagger of the Miami teams Dennis Erickson used to coach.
Last weekend, Oregon State avenged last year's bitter, season-opening
loss to Fresno State with a 59-19 payback at Corvallis, Ore. "We
really wanted to put a spanking on this team," linebacker Richard
Seigler told The Oregonian.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately add Virginia Tech to the early-season Fiesta Bowl
watch list. Questions about the quarterback notwithstanding--there's
no Michael Vick this year--we're fully on board after the team's
weekend win at Texas A&amp;M. It was Virginia Tech's third victory
against a ranked opponent. The Hokies could easily be undefeated
heading into their Dec. 7 game at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Miami Coach Larry Coker is 17-0 since taking over for Butch Davis
and is only 32 consecutive victories short of going out 49-0, the
record boxer Rocky Marciano amassed before he retired.</TE>
<TE>   Conference of the Week: Big 12. Yeah, Kansas lost to Bowling Green
and Texas A&amp;M came up short against Virginia Tech, but Colorado over
UCLA and Kansas State beating USC restored some dignity to the
so-called super conference.</TE>
<TE>   Conference of the Weak: Ping, ping, ping ... that's the sound of a
hammer against the light-metal league known as the Big Tin. San Jose
State over Illinois? Wake Forest defeats Purdue? Indiana holds on to
beat Central Michigan? Northwestern survives Navy? The Big East
boasts the worst one-two league combo in Temple and Rutgers, but is
there a worse quartet of teams in any major conference than Illinois,
Purdue, Indiana and Northwestern?</TE>
<TE>   Also, only two dropped Cincinnati passes prevented No. 6 Ohio
State from losing, making it tough to figure how the Buckeyes held
their No. 6 ranking in this week's AP poll. Where would Notre Dame be
without the Big Ten? Three of the Irish's four wins have come against
the conference: Purdue, Michigan and Michigan State.</TE>

<HD>Notre Dame Makes Top 10</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Notre Dame moved into the top 10 in the Associated Press poll Sunday,
the first time the team has been ranked that high since a one-week
stay in the 2000 final regular-season top 25.</LD>
<LD>   Checking in at No. 10, the Irish (4-0) moved up two places from
last week after Saturday's 21-17 victory at Michigan State. Notre
Dame is off next week.</LD>
<LD>   The Irish play next on Oct. 5 against Stanford, where Tyrone
Willingham coached for seven years before taking over at Notre Dame
this season.</LD>
<TE>   While Miami remained a near-unanimous No. 1 choice over Oklahoma
and Texas, Tennessee dropped out of the top 10 after its 30-13 loss
to Florida. The Volunteers fell seven places to No. 11, while the
Gators climbed three places to No. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State also made a big move after its 27-20 win over USC,
the Wildcats' first home win against a ranked nonconference opponent.
They moved up 10 places to No. 15, while the Trojans fell seven spots
to No. 18.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina State running back Derek Watson was arrested and
charged with reckless driving early Sunday in Columbia, S.C., the
latest legal problem for the ex-South Carolina player.</TE>
<TE>   Richland County sheriff's deputies also charged Watson with
driving with a suspended license after he was spotted driving left of
the center line, said Sgt. Chris Cowan.</TE>
<TE>   Watson was stopped hours after he scored a touchdown in South
Carolina State's 50-12 victory over Savannah State. He later was
released on bond. The arrest was first reported by Columbia station
WIS-TV.</TE>
<TE>   Watson has gotten into trouble several times since he gained 1,066
yards for South Carolina last season and helped the Gamecocks get to
the Outback Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   He was suspended from the bowl game by Coach Lou Holtz after
wrecking a teammate's car while driving with a suspended license.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame quarterback Carlyle Holiday will be evaluated on a
week-to-week basis after injuring his left shoulder Saturday against
Michigan State, Willingham said.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham declined to say exactly what the injury was and said he
didn't know for sure how long Holiday would be out.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hopeful by the time our next ballgame arises that he will
be in position to play," Willingham said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech tailback Tony Hollings will have an MRI exam on his
injured right knee today, but Coach Chan Gailey already is worried
that his star player is out for the season. Doctors had to wait until
today to run the MRI test so the swelling on Hollings' knee could go
down.</TE>

<HD>After Going Flat on Road to Playoffs, a Struggling Team Is
Still on the Bubble</HD>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>So, this was supposed to be the trip that would put the finishing
touches on the playoff mettle that the Angels had been demonstrating
in preparation for the real thing.</LD>
<LD>   Well, those good intentions are suddenly taking on the appearance
of wishful thinking.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday, the Angels lost for the fifth time in seven games on the
trip, failed for the second straight day to clinch a playoff berth
and dropped three games behind the Oakland A's in the American League
West.</LD>
<TE>   The key question as the cases of Domaine Ste. Michelle were being
loaded on an equipment truck parked outside of their Safeco Field
clubhouse was this:</TE>
<TE>   How well will that champagne travel?</TE>
<TE>   Put another way:</TE>
<TE>   How well will the Angels travel after failing to clinch that
playoff berth here in two games of the type they generally win?</TE>
<TE>   A Troy Glaus throwing error was pivotal in Saturday's 6-4 loss,
and there was a series of less glaring mistakes Sunday as the Angels,
who know how to win games decided by one run, as evidenced by their
23-7 record going in, lost to the Seattle Mariners, 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   With six games to play and still needing only one win, or losses
by Seattle and Boston, to end their 16-year playoff drought, it seems
premature to suggest the Angels are pressing, or that they have
revived memories of 1995, when they blew a 13-game August lead and
eventually lost a one-game division playoff to the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, this is a team, or at least an organization, haunted
by the ghosts of more seasons than just '95, and Jarrod Washburn--far
too young to be familiar with all of them--conceded that today's off
day in Texas (the Angels open a three-game series against the Rangers
Tuesday night) is coming at the right time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very disappointed in our performance the last two days,"
Washburn said, "but it's not life and death. We know it takes one
more win. We'll go to Texas, clear our minds and get back to business
Tuesday."</TE>
<TE>   Said Adam Kennedy: "I'd say that if we were anxious the last
couple days to get [the clinching] out of the way, that anxiousness
will go away now."</TE>
<TE>   Some might say the anxiety will only increase until the Angels
make it happen, but they certainly will have two things going for
them when they return to work.</TE>
<TE>   * The hapless Rangers have lost nine of their last 11 games in a
season of 86 losses.</TE>
<TE>   * The A's will open a three-game series against the Mariners by
sending Barry Zito (22-5), the likely Cy Young Award winner, against
Ismael Valdes (8-11), a seeming mismatch.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the A's-Mariner series is something of a catch-22.</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels can't take care of their business in Texas, they
will need the A's to win at least one game from the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with that, however, is they also need the Mariners to
beat the A's if they have any chance--as unrealistic as it is--to
overtake the A's for the division title.</TE>
<TE>   The A's need only a combination of three wins or Angel losses to
win the West.</TE>
<TE>   The cold reality is that the Angels are headed to New York as the
wild card, if they can ever reduce their magic number--an almost
tantalizing and taunting one--to zero.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want the Angels and A's to celebrate on our field,"
Seattle Manager Lou Piniella said. "We held off the Angels, now we
get the A's.</TE>
<TE>   "We owe it to the Angels to play our regular lineup and play as
hard as we can. The other night I congratulated [Angel Manager] Mike
Scioscia on the great job he's done this year and promised him we'd
give it our best shot against Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, we're still thinking about the playoffs ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Or as Jeff Nelson said after saving Sunday's victory, keeping the
Mariners alive: "The last candle on the mantel hasn't been burned out
yet."</TE>
<TE>   If the flame is still flickering by the time the Mariners come to
Anaheim Friday night for the final three-game series, the Angels'
anxiety level might be off the charts.</TE>
<TE>   The panacea in the meantime would be an offensive awakening of the
type they have found difficult while facing a series of quality
starters on this trip, including Mark Mulder, Tim Hudson and Zito in
Oakland, and Joel Pineiro, Freddy Garcia and Ryan Franklin in
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Eliminating the 8-1 rout of Pineiro Friday night, the Angels have
averaged 2.8 runs in the other six games, not scoring more than four
in any.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia knows that good pitching is the theme in the postseason
and that the Angels will have to deal with Roger Clemens, Andy
Pettitte and Mike Mussina if they face the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "I still believe our offense matches up with some of this better
pitching," he said. "I don't think we're pressing. I think we're
going about it the same way.</TE>
<TE>   "We just couldn't get into our style of baseball the last two
days."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the Angels had only one run and four hits through seven
innings against Franklin, who, Piniella said, has pitched well enough
in what is tantamount to his first full season to earn a spot in next
year's rotation.</TE>
<TE>   When the Angels closed to 3-2 against Franklin and Arthur Rhodes
in the eighth, Nelson came in to strike out Glaus with two runners on
base and then pitched a perfect ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, who pitched well enough to notch his 19th win and keep
alive his now-dead hopes for 20, couldn't prevent rookie second
baseman Willie Bloomquist from getting his first four major league
hits--two doubles and two singles.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels also were betrayed by little things that they have
generally been able to force their way. A Washburn wild pitch that
Bengie Molina blocked but couldn't control set up one of the Seattle
runs. A ground ball that first baseman Scott Spiezio actually lost in
the glare of the sun set up another. Brad Fullmer, on second with one
out in the seventh, misread a grounder to the mound and was nailed in
a rundown.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always believed that good pitching holds off good hitting,
but we should have won some of these games," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels won't face a similar caliber of pitching in Texas,
where they hope their bats get hot and the champagne will still be
cold.</TE>

<KH>WEEK 3 IN THE NFL MIKE PENNER</KH>
<HD>Moss Factor Is Hard to Figure Out</HD>

<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It can't be easy quarterbacking the Minnesota Vikings, never knowing
in advance which plays Randy Moss plans to take off.</LD>
<LD>   "Couldn't you at least send a fax?" Daunte Culpepper may or may
not have yelled at Moss--it was hard to hear over the booing of the
home fans during the Vikings' 21-14 loss to the Carolina Panthers
Sunday at the Metrodome.</LD>
<LD>   Culpepper had just thrown an interception, one of four on the day,
one of two Moss might have prevented had he wanted this victory as
much as the angry mob of Minnesotans, who had paid good money and
wanted something more than half a loaf.</LD>
<TE>   Culpepper hit the sideline hopping and screaming at Moss. He took
off his helmet and threw it. Somewhat surprisingly, it was not
intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   Moss, a model of consistency on and off the playing field, ignored
Culpepper. Too cool to care? Or trying to defuse a situation by
refusing to respond to it? You never can tell with Moss--and therein
lies a reason why Minnesota is 0-3 this morning.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings began this season touting a new offensive strategy
called The Randy Ratio, for reasons that escape at the moment. Let's
see: The Vikings were either going to send 40% of their passes in
Moss' direction, or Moss was going to pay attention 40% of the time,
one or the other.</TE>
<TE>   Four receptions for 16 yards--Moss' motley total against
Carolina--weren't part of any equation, at least any equation
intended to produce a winning record for the Vikings in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   After consecutive home losses to Buffalo and Carolina, two teams
that combined for a 2001 record of 4-28, the Vikings are a mess and
Coach Mike Tice is already at a loss over how to work the mop.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how his team might be able to bounce back from such a start,
Tice frankly replied, "I don't know. I don't know that I have ever
been on a team that had lost three straight games at the beginning of
the season like this.... The reality is that I have a bunch of guys,
players and coaches, giving me everything that they have got."</TE>
<TE>   And at least one who is not, although Tice was quite careful not
to mention any names.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to NFL quick fixes, a certain ratio has already
eclipsed Randy's as the route to success. Introducing The Rodney
Ratio, in which an aging journeyman quarterback takes over a hopeless
team and triples its previous season's victory total in three weeks
because of a helpful quirk in the league schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Rodney Peete and the recently hapless Carolina Panthers are
3-0 after losing their last 15 games of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   No, Peete's Panthers have not beaten a team this season that has
actually won so much as a game.</TE>
<TE>   Week 1: Carolina defeats Baltimore. The Ravens, idle Sunday, are
0-2.</TE>
<TE>   Week 2: Carolina defeats Detroit. The Lions, 37-31 losers to Green
Bay in their Ford Field opener, are 0-3.</TE>
<TE>   Week 3: Carolina defeats Minnesota, also 0-3.</TE>
<TE>   Total 2002 record of Carolina's 2002 opponents so far: 0-8.</TE>
<TE>   Peete, who has been around a while, realizes the legions of
doubters have noticed the numbers and are not yet prepared to bet the
homestead next week on the Panthers at Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody really expected [this], except for the people in this
locker room," Peete said. Easy for him to say. The Panthers have a
very big season schedule posted in a prominent position in their
locker room. Everyone on the team can read it.</TE>
<TE>   That's sacred sanctuary, an NFL locker room. Some teams, given
their druthers, would prefer never having to leave it. (Everyone's
undefeated inside their own locker room. With the possible exception
of the Cincinnati Bengals.) Many more consider the locker room "us"
and the outside world "them," such as the New York Jets, who were
again routed by them, 30-3, Sunday. That's Jets 10, Them 74 over the
last two weekends.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to stick together," Jet quarterback Vinny
Testaverde said after the 27-point loss to Miami, ending New York's
very peculiar eight-game winning streak over the Dolphins. "Because
everybody outside of the locker room is probably going to take shots
at us and tell us how bad we are."</TE>
<TE>   Assuming someone inside the Jet locker room--namely, Coach Herman
Edwards--doesn't beat them to it.</TE>
<TE>   No league turns on itself faster than the NFL, which has watched
St. Louis, Baltimore and New England overdose on the
dregs-to-champions diet the last three seasons. Sunday, San Diego
defeated Arizona, 23-15, and New Orleans rallied from a 20-point
deficit to edge Chicago, 29-23, leaving Denver to share the 3-0 stage
with the following:</TE>
<TE>   * Carolina, which lost its last 15 games of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   * San Diego, which lost its last nine games of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   * New Orleans, which lost its last four games of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego has done it the Panther way--milking a soft schedule
(Cincinnati, Houston, Arizona) until it's dry.</TE>
<TE>   The Saints, however, have fashioned their 3-0 start in a manner
that warrants attention. New Orleans is undefeated against three 2001
playoff teams--winning on the road against Tampa Bay and Chicago and
at home against Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   (Hmm. New Orleans and Carolina are 3-0, San Francisco is 2-1 after
defeating Washington, 20-10, and two plays separate 1-2 Atlanta from
3-0. Do you think the Rams, winless as they head into tonight's game
against the Buccaneers in Tampa, are happy the NFL realigned over the
off-season?)</TE>
<TE>   The Saints rallied to beat the Bears by scoring two touchdowns in
a 58-second span in the second quarter, followed by the go-ahead
touchdown--a 29-yard pass play from Aaron Brooks to Donte'
Stallworth--with 1:11 left in the game.</TE>
<TE>   If that struck Bear fans as oddly familiar, it was. The Bears went
13-3 in 2001 and 2-0 during the first two weeks of 2002 in similar
style--doing just enough to get by, doing it dramatically, doing it
late.</TE>
<TE>   Which might be disappointing to Bear fans, but can't be
surprising. They know, along with everyone else, that the NFL at the
start of the 21st century is nothing more than a copycat league.</TE>

<HD>Success Won't Be Going to Spurrier's Head Soon</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Steve Spurrier, his bright white visor still on his head, is bent
over at the waist, as if he has eaten bad shrimp. The final seconds
are ticking off and the San Francisco 49ers are going to beat his
Washington Redskins, 20-10.</LD>
<LD>   Spurrier very much wants to do an NFL strut, wants to beat
somebody, 49-0, wants to prove on a new and higher level that he is
the most brilliant, innovative, clever, dynamic, interesting and,
yes, most hated coach at the pro level. Just as he had been at
Florida in college football.</LD>
<LD>   What Spurrier doesn't want is to become another David Caruso.</LD>
<TE>   Remember Caruso? He was a hot-shot TV star on "NYPD Blue" until
his head got big, his ego got bigger, his contract demands got
outrageous. So Caruso left to become a movie star. Except, he didn't.
And now, years later, Caruso is back on TV, in a new police drama,
"CSI: Miami," hoping very much to become big again.</TE>
<TE>   Watching Spurrier biting his lower lip as he ran across the field
at 3Com Park to give a limp handshake to 49er Coach Steve Mariucci,
it is not hard to imagine Spurrier back in college again someday,
taking the job at some wannabe big-time program, recreating Florida
in some place like, oh, Westwood, hoping very much to become big
again.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happens sometimes when you overreach. That's what
happens when you can't be content with being great at one thing, when
you can't be happy doing one thing at a very high level for a very
long time. It's hard for the most talented among us to stay content.</TE>
<TE>   And right now there is no sadder sight in football than seeing
Spurrier still wearing his white visor at the end of a game, that
visor free of dirt or fingerprints, having never left Spurrier's
head.</TE>
<TE>   This means the ball coach had no reason to get angry, had no need
to fire up the guys. This means the ball coach never reached a point
where he knew, just knew that a botched play, a dropped ball, a
missed tackle was the difference between winning and losing.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier is doing what he used to do at Florida. He is drawing up
ball plays and trying to poke at the status-quo NFL. He is yanking
quarterbacks (Shane Matthews for Danny Wuerffel), but it doesn't
matter now.</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought I might change something up," Spurrier said.
"[Matthews] got sacked and made some mistakes. So I thought I'd give
[Wuerffel] a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Wuerffel attempted two passes, completing one to the Redskins and
one to the 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier could have given you and me a chance. But we aren't NFL
quarterbacks. And neither are Matthews and Wuerffel. Spurrier must
know that. Spurrier didn't have an NFL arm either. He tried to play
in the NFL. He tried to be the kind of pro quarterback he was in
college.</TE>
<TE>   But Spurrier's quarterback talents didn't transfer well to the
NFL. And there's no guarantee his coaching talents will either, and
no promise that Spurrier will be patient enough to find out.</TE>
<TE>   "San Francisco beat us today," Spurrier said. "They were a better
team today, they really were." He sounded sad. He sounded chastened.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier sounded surprised too, as if he had expected to beat the
49ers, 37-7, again, as he had in an exhibition game. It was that
game, when Spurrier played his first-stringers longer and harder than
Mariucci had used his, that might have made this game somehow
interesting. Mariucci had said he was a little disgusted at Spurrier
running up the score.</TE>
<TE>   But in the NFL revenge isn't a driving force.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee's Phillip Fulmer could try every year to beat the uppity
Spurrier because both coaches were going to be around for a while.
They were winners. They had built programs.</TE>
<TE>   Mariucci has more pressing problems than revenge on Spurrier. The
49er fans are grumbling. There hasn't been a Super Bowl appearance in
a while. The record before Sunday was only 1-1. There were even
plenty of empty seats at 3Com.</TE>
<TE>   Winning was important. Beating Spurrier was not important.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier was made for college. His intense belief in his mind, in
his vision of a game, in his ability to create new plays, worked at
Florida because Spurrier could bring in new players every year who
were recruited specifically to fit his vision.</TE>
<TE>   It is not like that now.</TE>
<TE>   Free agents will come if they want to, if the money is good
enough, if the facilities are nice enough, if the coach fits what the
player wants and not if the player fits what the coach wants. In the
draft, you take what is available, not always what you want or even
what you need.</TE>
<TE>   Watching Spurrier be unable to make Sunday's game interesting in
any way, unable to get a rise out of his team or the opponent, unable
to create a ball play that his own team could carry out in any
reliable way, it was as if Michelangelo had been commissioned to
paint a church facade white. A big job, maybe, and lucrative, and
important to do well, but what was the point of being the best at
painting the outside white when you were already the best at painting
masterpieces on the church ceiling?</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SUTTON COLDFIELD, England</DL>
<LD>Have we missed it? The last time we saw the Ryder Cup was in 1999, an
eternity in the timeline of golf, which is more accurately measured
in other ways, like yards to the green or inches to the hole or
minutes to a tee time, certainly not years between shots.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe the reason those moments seem so long ago is very simple,
our memories of the last Ryder Cup, of Justin Leonard's improbable
45-foot uphill putt on the last day at Brookline Country Club and the
wild celebration by the U.S. team even before Jose Maria Olazabal had
a chance to answer with his putt. It really was a long time ago.</LD>
<LD>   And the problem with that? It's simple too. Three years between
matches, already postponed for a year, no important buildup by the
media, a maze of security issues, a whopping two-thirds of the 24
golfers playing worse than when they were named to the team 13 months
go and no real, let's face it, no real ill will between the players,
and what is shaping up as the 34th Ryder Cup matches might turn out
to be a huge dud in the coming weekend.</LD>
<TE>   Normally, the Ryder Cup is all about the U.S. versus Europe, about
flags, about patriotism and jingoism, about feeling free to step on
the other guys' neck and feel good about it. Someone is going to have
to work up a large case of intensity real soon to rescue this thing.</TE>
<TE>   Said Lee Westwood: "I'll be glad when the Ryder Cup is over."</TE>
<TE>   He may not be the only one. Because the matches were postponed a
year at the Belfry because of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the
Ryder Cup may have lost some of its cachet. The players have learned
to live without them in what has become a very long playing season.
At the same time, players on both sides are probably closer as a
result of the terrorist attacks, a situation that dilutes the
measured antagonism that never fails to liven up the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Strange, the U.S. Ryder Cup captain, senses a lack of
interest, but says it's because of the media.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a little quiet," Strange said. "We haven't had the
tension building of guys trying to make the team, of who the
captain's picks would be. That was exciting. And that hasn't
happened.</TE>
<TE>   "But if you were out there in my shoes, the [players] know what's
going on. I think they are fired up."</TE>
<TE>   We will see if Strange is right once the four ball, or better
ball, matches begin Friday morning on the parkland course, about a
two-hour train ride from London, just outside of Birmingham.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods predicts a different type of Ryder Cup experience as a
result of the unpleasantness at Brookline, where crowd behavior also
was a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the matches will be conducted in the fashion they were
designed, and that is a competitive atmosphere," Woods said. "We are
going out there to compete, we are going to enjoy it, but it's not
going to be more of the same.</TE>
<TE>   "We all understand it's not life or death."</TE>
<TE>   The scene was not always pretty three years ago in Massachusetts.
The worst episodes involved fans heckling Colin Montgomerie and the
unruly charge at the 17th green on the last day during Leonard's
singles match against Olazabal. The Europeans claim some of the U.S.
players and their wives ran across the green while Olazabal waited to
see if he could match Leonard's putt. The U.S. players, who
apologized afterward for their breach of conduct, say they ran behind
the green and not on top of it.</TE>
<TE>   As far as controversy goes, that's about it, with no one sure
whether European fans have long memories about the 14 1/2-13 1/2 U.S.
win and will retaliate accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   Said Woods: "In 1999, I think the fans went over the top, the
players went over the top and the media went over the top."</TE>
<TE>   Strange doesn't want anybody to go over the top this time. He says
that the logos on all the players' apparel and bags read "2001," left
over from the postponement.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to forget why we are moving it to 2002," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither does Ryder Cup Ltd., which is running the event. No one
will comment on security except to state, "security measures are in
place."</TE>
<TE>   However, for the first time at a Ryder Cup match in Europe, there
are extraordinary security measures planned, including banning such
items as cellular phones, cameras, pagers, ladders, picnic baskets,
briefcases, portable televisions, lawn chairs and bicycles. No bags,
backpacks or carryalls larger than eight inches square will be
allowed beyond the ticket and security checkpoints. In addition, all
spectators will pass through metal detectors and X-ray machines.</TE>
<TE>   "These might at first view appear draconian measures, but they are
being implemented not only as part of our security program ... but
also to further enhance the enjoyment for all spectators.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that all spectators will understand [why] this is
being done."</TE>
<TE>   Many security measures are new, but there is another aspect of the
matches that is exactly the same as it was when the matches were
postponed last September. The players are the same, even though they
earned places on their teams with performances that haven't been
measured in 13 months.</TE>
<TE>   If the players were playing well then, they aren't necessarily
now. In fact, 18 of the 24 players have lost ground in the World Golf
Ranking since making their 2001 Ryder Cup teams. The only ones who
haven't been backsliding are Woods, Phil Mickelson, David Toms, Jim
Furyk, Sergio Garcia and Padraig Harrington.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest dropoffs have been by Hal Sutton, down 100 places to
121st, and Westwood, down 124 places to 141st.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, only six of the 24 players have won a tournament in
2002, three players on the U.S. (Woods, Mickelson, Furyk) and three
on the European team (Garcia, Darren Clarke, Thomas Bjorn).</TE>
<TE>   Strange says a player's form won't matter once the matches start
because of the nature of the Ryder Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen it in the past, anything can happen," he said. "It's
such a different animal, 72 holes of stroke play compared to match
play. When you go into an 18-hole match-play format like the Ryder
Cup, the game is on. If anybody thinks the matches won't be
competitive because we do have guys who aren't playing as well, I
think they'd be wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The Ryder Cup could not have been any more competitive since the
1987 matches--the point total since then is 98-98. Once again, the
U.S. enters the matches as a favorite to retain the cup. Even though
the U.S. holds a 24-7-2 margin in the competition, Europe has a 5-3
record in the last eight matchups, beginning with its victory in 1985
at the Belfry.</TE>
<TE>   Toms, Stewart Cink and captain's pick Scott Verplank are playing
in their first Ryder Cup while four European players are Ryder Cup
rookies: Niclas Fasth, Pierre Fulke, Paul McGinley and Phillip Price.</TE>
<TE>   But maybe that's the wrong way to look at it. After all, how can
anybody be a rookie when you've been on the team for 13 months?</TE>

<HD>Go-To Guy Is Missing for Team Used to One</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's deep in the second half, the game is tight, and UCLA desperately
needs to score.</LD>
<LD>   Who's going to get the ball?</LD>
<LD>   A season ago it was DeShaun Foster, at least until NCAA rules
trouble hit.</LD>
<TE>   Before that it was Freddie Mitchell who could break open a game,
or Cade McNown who always seemed to make some last-ditch scramble and
score ... Kevin Jordan ... J.J. Stokes ...</TE>
<TE>   Who now?</TE>
<TE>   Three games into the season, UCLA doesn't have a go-to guy.</TE>
<TE>   "We all have to step up and make plays," receiver Craig Bragg
said.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, that was our theme going into this year. We're not
going to be individuals. We're going to be a team. And whatever the
coaches say, whatever the defense gives us, that's what we're going
to do.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big difference from last year. We're team-oriented. Last
year, we had a superstar: We had De- Shaun. Everybody knew that was
our guy. This year, I guess you could say we are looking for an
identity."</TE>
<TE>   When it's third and five, you never really know who the Bruins
will give the ball to--which is good for keeping defenses guessing,
not so good for building an offense that's confident it can move the
ball when it needs to.</TE>
<TE>   The tailback duo of Akil Harris and Manuel White had been
reasonably effective until Saturday, but the ground game didn't get
much going in the 31-17 loss to Colorado at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Despite an effort to establish the running game, UCLA finished
with 62 net yards rushing, only 31 by Harris and 36 by White, who
doubles as the fullback. The longest run of the day was 13 yards by
White.</TE>
<TE>   "We just didn't run the ball very well today," said Kelly Skipper,
UCLA's running back coach and offensive coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   "We've still got to get a better flow on offense. We were
averaging 400 yards a game coming into this game. Things just didn't
go as we'd like."</TE>
<TE>   Harris and White are more workmanlike than flash-and-dash, and
quarterback Cory Paus and the receiving corps didn't show much of a
deep threat Saturday, either.</TE>
<TE>   Bragg probably comes closest to being UCLA's big-play guy, though
the Bruins would like to see the same thing from Tab Perry.</TE>
<TE>   It was Bragg's 41-yard touchdown reception against Oklahoma State
with the Bruins trailing, 10-0, that turned that game UCLA's way in a
38-24 victory.</TE>
<TE>   In the loss to Colorado, his 33-yard reception on a trick-play
pass from receiver Jon Dubravac gave UCLA its only lead, 7-0.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, during training camp the most consistent deep threat
was tight end Mike Seidman. That hasn't materialized so much during
the season, though he did have a 27-yard touchdown reception against
Oklahoma State.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to be a big-play guy," Seidman said. "Whenever a deep ball
was called to me [against Colorado], Cory was sacked or had to get
rid of it."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the most exciting potential options are freshman tailback
Tyler Ebell, whose darting ability is being used mostly on punt
returns although he has yet to break one, and freshman receiver
Junior Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor showed his ability on an electrifying 49-yard reverse in
the opening victory over Colorado State, but hadn't caught a pass
until Saturday. He finished with two receptions, one of them for 20
yards.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a lot of speed," Skipper said. "Just you know, a
freshman. He's starting to get in the groove, getting some game
experience. He made a nice catch over the middle, and had another
nice reverse [a 10-yarder Saturday.]"</TE>
<TE>   Bragg sees Taylor's talent, but knows the freshman has more to
learn before he can become a big part of the offense.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to be a great player," Bragg said. "The biggest thing
is learning to understand the offense. A reverse is the easiest thing
to do.</TE>
<TE>   "But you have to learn to understand coverages. We might have a
fade on, and if they give us a different coverage you have to change
it to a slant or an in. You've just got to be able to read coverages
on the move, which is not something you have to do in high school.
Once you learn to do that in college, you see how much easier it is
to get open."</TE>
<TE>   Somebody might yet emerge as UCLA's go-to player. Or it might be a
season when the defense has to make most of the big plays and the
offense continues to be an ensemble cast.</TE>
<TE>   "There definitely needs to be more big plays from all of us rather
than one particular guy," said Bragg, not one to mind an
equal-opportunity offense.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how you keep the team unified," Bragg said. "Nobody's
jealous of somebody else getting all the balls. The coaches aren't
hearing players or parents complaining about their son not getting
the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "We like playing this way. It's more fun for the rest of the team,
because everybody gets the ball."</TE>

<LD>A day after its early bid for a perfect season ended, USC on Sunday
dropped seven spots to No. 18 in the Associated Press college
football poll.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans' 27-20 loss to Kansas State on Saturday night caused
the fall.</LD>
<LD>   USC players, however, insisted there was no cause for alarm.</LD>
<TE>   Not after winning two of three nonconference games that were
regarded among the toughest matchups in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   And not with a Pacific 10 Conference opener against No. 23 Oregon
State coming Saturday at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been nice to be 3-0, but we're 2-1 and getting
ready for the Pac-10," senior running back Malaefou MacKenzie said
while packing his gear after the loss. "That's the real deal. That's
what gets you to the Rose Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   USC has not played in Pasadena on New Year's Day since the 1995
season when the Trojans started 6-0, tied Washington for the Pac-10
title and defeated Northwestern in the Rose Bowl to complete a 9-2-1
season.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes after their comeback bid against Kansas State fell short,
several Trojans said they were already thinking about unbeaten Oregon
State (4-0), one of four Pac-10 opponents ranked in the top 25.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Pac-10 time," senior middle linebacker Mike Pollard said.
"The preseason is over. Now we have to go on and win the conference."</TE>
<TE>   To do that, the Trojans must eliminate the dropped passes and
special teams miscues that cost them against Kansas State (4-0),
which vaulted 10 spots to No. 15.</TE>
<TE>   USC also must regroup on defense.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans went into the Kansas State game ranked No. 1 in the
nation in total defense, allowing 171 yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats, with quarterback Ell Roberson at the controls for
the final three quarters, more than doubled that average, amassing
347 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We missed five tackles last week [against Colorado] and we missed
a ton this week," USC Coach Pete Carroll said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   USC trailed by 21 points in the fourth quarter before scoring two
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans were driving again in the final three minutes before
the Wildcats stopped them on downs at the Kansas State 38-yard line
with 26 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to take what we did in the fourth quarter into the next
game," left tackle Jacob Rogers said. "We have to look forward
instead of looking back."</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State moved into the top 25 with a 59-19 victory over
Fresno State that avenged last season's loss to the Bulldogs.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Steven Jackson rushed for 227 yards and two
touchdowns and quarterback Derek Anderson passed for 214 yards and
three touchdowns for the Beavers, who also defeated Eastern Kentucky,
Temple and Nevada Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks very much like the film that we looked at of K-State,"
Carroll said. "They're just ripping. No one has even been able to
slow them down."</TE>
<TE>   USC defensive tackle Shaun Cody is not worried. The Trojans, he
said, will be ready when they play at the Coliseum for the first time
since defeating Auburn in their opener Sept. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll regroup and I think we're going to be hungry now," Cody
said. "We realize what it would mean to win the Pac-10 and go to the
Rose Bowl. We're fine."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Killeen could be the No. 1 kicker for the Oregon State game
after making two extra-point kicks in the fourth quarter against
Kansas State. Killeen replaced David Davis, who missed a 30-yard
field-goal attempt and had a conversion kick blocked and returned for
a two-point play. Freshman punter Tom Malone also struggled on
several kicks. "It's the kicks that have been hurting us," Carroll
said. "We can count on it getting better because I don't think it's
going to get any farther off than we are right now." ... Cornerback
Ronald Nunn, who left the game because of an injured right knee, will
undergo an MRI exam today, Carroll said. If Nunn cannot play
Saturday, William Buchanon, Justin Wyatt or Marcell Allmond could
start in his place.... Walk-on receiver Greig Carlson returned three
punts for 23 yards and Carroll said he might continue in that role.</TE>
