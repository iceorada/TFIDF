<HD>BMW accentuates the positive</HD>
<DH>The new Z4 roadster takes everything that made the Z3 good
and makes it better.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some cognoscenti sniff at BMW's Z3 roadster because of its somewhat
soft lines and an appearance that is closer to cute and cuddly than
to mean and muscular.</LD>
<LD>   Still, next to Mazda's Miata, also sniffed at by some as too
gentle-looking, the road- ster seen most often around Southern
California is the Z3. Someone must like it.</LD>
<LD>   Now, though, the Z3 is gone, replaced by BMW's Z4. And nobody will
be able to stick this nifty two-seater into a gender cubbyhole.</LD>
<TE>   The Z4 is a great car to drive. It's even fun to be a passenger in
it, although roadsters are about driving, not riding. It takes
everything that made the Z3 good and makes it better. When the Z3
arrived in 1996, it provided a step up from the Miata. Then came
Porsche with the Boxster and Honda with the S2000, and the Z3 no
longer sat at the top of the heap.</TE>
<TE>   The Z4, born in BMW's Designworks USA studio near Thousand Oaks,
helps fix that.</TE>
<TE>   Various enthusiast books have called it as close to the Porsche
Boxster in handling and scoot as it could get without being a
Boxster. The base Z4 with a 2.5-liter, 184-horsepower engine starts
at almost $10,000 less than a Boxster, albeit with a manually
operated ragtop versus the Porsche's standard power top. (An
electric-powered convertible adds $750 to the Bimmer, but the top is
so easy to operate, it's almost silly to spend the extra money.)</TE>
<TE>   Price-wise, the Z4's $33,795 base model is just $735 more than the
Honda S2000, and I'd bet there aren't many who will cross-shop the
two.</TE>
<TE>   The four-cylinder, 240-horse Honda is designed by and for those
who love the high-revving, edge-of-seat performance of a racing
motorcycle in sports-car drag. The Z4 is a solid Teutonic road
machine, not quite capable of matching the gutsier Honda's
performance numbers but a lot more fun to drive at lower speeds --
which, after all, is where most people who use their cars as daily
drivers spend most of their time on the road.</TE>
<TE>   For those not satisfied with the 2.5i (for fuel-injected) Z4's
numbers, an extra $7,200 will put you into the 3.0-liter,
225-horsepower version, which also has bigger tires and wheels and a
standard six-speed manual transmission instead of the 2.5i's
five-speed.</TE>
<TE>   A clutch-less six-speed sequential will be available as an option
in both models in April, and right now there's a five-speed automatic
available with the driver-selectable shifting option that BMW calls
Steptronic.</TE>
<TE>   Back to the 3.0i for a moment -- it will beat the Honda S2000 in a
sprint to 60 mph, but $7,000 is a lot of scratch for boasting rights
to that accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   The Z4's fuel economy is estimated at 20 miles per gallon city and
28 highway for the manual transmission 2.5i and 21/28 for the 2.5
with an automatic transmission. The 3.0i is rated at 21/29 with
manual (a benefit of the sixth speed) and 20/28 for the automatic
model.</TE>
<TE>   I drove the 2.5i and 3.0i in both manual and automatic, and
although I have a definite bias toward manuals in sports cars, I
found the 3.0 with automatic to be quite acceptable. The 2.5-liter
with automatic -- well, let's just say the ho-hum factor was pretty
noticeable at higher speeds.</TE>
<TE>   The 2.5-liter with five-speed manual was as quick as the 3.0 with
automatic up through second gear, but the car got a bit sluggish in
fourth at 70-80 mph on the freeway and needed to be downshifted if a
surge of acceleration was needed.</TE>
<TE>   Handling was, well, BMW-like in both models. The Z4 rides on a
modified version of the current-generation 3-Series suspension,
whereas the Z3 used an older 3-Series setup that already was out of
date when the roadster was born.</TE>
<TE>   Though the 2.5i with standard suspension felt a bit light at speed
and could have used wider tires upfront to help anchor it, there was
nothing twitchy or nervous-making about it. The base model rides on
16-inch rubber, the 3.0i on 17-inch tires. BMW's Dynamic Stability
Control, which includes traction and brake-force controls and
anti-lock braking, is standard on both models.</TE>
<TE>   The Z4 has nearly perfect 50-50 front-to-rear weight balance, and
although there are no real mountains to scoot around in South
Carolina, where BMW staged the press introduction, the car hugged the
curves with all the stickiness anyone could ask for.</TE>
<TE>   Acceleration is great in the 2.5i and terrific in the 3.0i,
particularly in models with manual transmissions. While I didn't get
to top speed in either version, I've no doubt the 2.5i will hit BMW's
claim of 146 mph while the 3.0i should have no trouble topping out at
its electronically limited max of 155 mph.</TE>
<TE>   The optional sports suspension ($1,500) is a must for those who
want to push things as far as they will go. It offers stiffer shocks
and springs, a slightly lower ride height and Dynamic Driving
Control, which reduces power assist to the electric power steering,
punches up acceleration response and provides sportier shifting in
models with automatic transmissions.</TE>
<TE>   Styling is where the BMW is likely to be most polarizing: the new
look is love-it-or-hate-it. In pictures, which don't do the car
justice, it looks like bits and pieces of several vehicles grafted
together.</TE>
<TE>   In person, though, the design grew on me quickly. It is not
beautiful, but it is attractive, and the way sunlight and shadow play
off the sheet-metal surfaces is downright captivating.</TE>
<TE>   The Z4 is a tad longer and wider than its predecessor -- about 1.5
inches each way -- and the body is stiffer for improved handling. The
stiffness was achieved with better chassis bracing, but the Z4 gains
just 30 pounds to tip the scales at about 3,000.</TE>
<TE>   The extra width makes the Z4's cabin feel far roomier than the
Z3's, as does the sweeping one-piece dash that eliminates the
claustrophobic feeling in the Z3's divided cockpit. The extra length
is used up mainly by the trunk, leaving legroom in the cabin the same
as in the Z3 but making the trunk nearly twice as big -- now you can
get a couple of suitcases in there.</TE>
<TE>   Seats are nicely cushioned and bolstered. In my more than 300
miles of driving on the highways and byways from coastal Charleston
to BMW's U.S. plant at hilly Spartanburg, comfort never became a
question.</TE>
<TE>   The lined canvas top is amazingly quiet and provides sufficient
headroom for very tall drivers. And now there's a real glass rear
window, instead of scratched and cracking plastic. Another neat
feature is a hard plastic leading edge on the top that doubles as the
tonneau when it is folded away, eliminating the need for a separate
cover.</TE>
<TE>   Knobs, gauges and switches are where they should be and easy
enough to use. The cup holders pull out of the ends of the dash,
keeping liquids close to the doors and close at hand but out of the
way when serious driving business must be done.</TE>
<TE>   My only gripes about the interior are the size and location of the
glove box -- tiny and down low on the passenger side, so that it hit
my shins when I opened it -- and the hideous wood dash option. The
standard brushed aluminum is far more attractive and doesn't hold
fingerprints.</TE>
<TE>   The 2.5i model comes with vinyl as the standard upholstery fabric,
leather optional; the 3.0 has two levels of leather, the optional
"extended" package using upgraded cowhide and taking it up onto the
sun visors, windshield frame and door panels.</TE>
<TE>   Safety features include front air bags, side-impact air bags and
knee air bags, as well as standard twin roll bars and a reinforced
windshield frame.</TE>
<TE>   The base model's audio system is a 10-speaker setup with a
single-CD player. An upgraded system with higher-quality speakers and
a pair of subwoofers comes standard in the 3.0i and is optional in
the 2.5i.</TE>
<TE>   Final words: If you liked the Z3, you'll love the Z4. If you
didn't like the Z3, you still might love the Z4. A worthy addition to
any roadster shopper's list.</TE>

<LD>For those who follow automotive engine technology, the annual release
of Ward's AutoWorld's top 10 list is eagerly awaited.</LD>
<LD>   Though not the only reason to select -- or reject -- a vehicle,
knowing how the technophiles rate an engine can be helpful for
motorists when shopping time rolls around.</LD>
<LD>   For its best-of-2003 list, Ward's has picked four newcomers and
six repeat choices, including a precedent-setting ninth consecutive
appearance by Nissan Motor Co.'s 3.5-liter V-6 (the one that's in the
Altima, the Maxima, the Murano, the 350Z, the Infiniti G35 and
several other models).</LD>
<TE>   Other regulars on the list are the BMW 3.0- and 3.2-liter inline-6
engines, which have rarely missed a year since Ward's started doing
this; General Motors Corp.'s 4.2-liter Vortec inline-6; Honda Motor
Co.'s 2-liter dual-overhead-camshaft four-cylinder engine; and
Volkswagen's 1.8-liter turbocharged four-cylinder diesel engine.</TE>
<TE>   The Ward's picks for the 2003 model year show a move in the
industry toward smaller but more powerful engines. There are just two
V-8 engines in the top 10 this year, whereas muscle-car and truck
motors have sometimes dominated past lists.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, there are three outstanding four-cylinder engines,
which actually outnumbered the winning V-8s," said Bill Visnic,
senior technical editor for the publishing company's flagship
AutoWorld and editor of Ward's Engine &amp; Vehicle Technology Update.</TE>
<TE>   And all five of the six-cylinder engines on the list make as much
horsepower and torque as did many of yesterday's V-8s, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This really is the golden age of engine performance," Visnic
said. The best engines today provide "outstanding performance and
drivability with the lowest emissions ever achieved."</TE>
<TE>   Ward's tested engines from 30 cars, pickup trucks and sport
utility vehicles over a two-month period, evaluating them for power,
torque, use of new technologies and a trio collectively referred to
as NVH: noise, vibration and harshness.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Ward's does not score for dependability. Many times
the engines are new, and there's no reliability record to go by.</TE>
<TE>   But each year AutoWorldpicks two of the top 10 engines and tests
them on the road for both long-term reliability and the cost of
servicing, about 40,000 miles with a variety of drivers and uses,
Visnic said.</TE>
<TE>   So there's an implied durability and reliability in engines that
make Ward's list for several years in a row.</TE>
<TE>   All of the engines tested for the 2003 model year were in vehicles
with a base manufacturer's suggested retail price of $52,500 or less.</TE>
<TE>   Engines in higher-priced luxury vehicles were omitted because they
should be outstanding in any case and because Ward's wants to compile
a list relevant to the typical driver, Visnic said.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the complete list in alphabetical order (Ward's does not
rank them, except as a group):</TE>
<TE>   * BMW 3.0-liter dual-overhead-cam inline-6 (used on the 330i
sedan).</TE>
<TE>   * BMW 3.2-liter DOHC inline-6 (M3 coupe).</TE>
<TE>   * DaimlerChrysler 5.7-liter overhead-valve Hemi Magnum V-8 (Dodge
Ram Heavy Duty pickup).</TE>
<TE>   * Ford Motor Co. 6.0-liter overhead-valve Power Stroke Turbodiesel
V-8 (F-Series Super Duty pickup).</TE>
<TE>   * General Motors 4.2-liter DOHC inline-6 (Chevrolet TrailBlazer
SUV).</TE>
<TE>   * Honda Motor 2-liter DOHC inline-4 (Acura RSX Type S coupe).</TE>
<TE>   * Honda Motor 3-liter single-overhead-cam V-6 (Accord EX).</TE>
<TE>   * Mini 1.6-liter supercharged DOHC inline-4 (Mini Cooper S
two-door hatchback).</TE>
<TE>   * Nissan Motor 3.5-liter DOHC V-6 (Infiniti G35 coupe).</TE>
<TE>   * Volkswagen 1.8-liter DOHC turbocharged inline-4 (Golf GTI 1.8T
two-door hatchback).</TE>
<TE>   More information will be posted at www.wardsauto.com on Jan. 5,
Visnic said.</TE>
<TE>   J.D. Power cranks 'em out</TE>
<TE>   Automotive marketing consultant J.D. Power &amp; Associates is
churning out studies and reports at a frantic pace as the end of the
year approaches.</TE>
<TE>   Many are linked to the company's ever-expanding customer
satisfaction ratings -- Power rates not only automakers and their
individual models but also components such as audio systems,
navigation systems and replacement tires.</TE>
<TE>   The companies that get top ratings and want to brag about them pay
Power for permission to use the marketing firm's rankings in their
ads, a system that spokesman Michael Greywitt says ensures the
company's ability to remain independent.</TE>
<TE>   Power, based in Westlake Village, funds the studies internally,
then recoups its costs -- and turns a profit -- selling the finished
reports and licensing the use of its name in those ads.</TE>
<TE>   It sometimes seems as if J.D. Power has become a report mill, but
if you disallow the product endorsement potential and concentrate on
the survey findings, you can turn up some significant, sometimes
scary, stuff.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a just-issued Power rating of customer satisfaction
with navigation systems in cars turned up this stunner: "Less than 3%
of owners believe their navigation system creates dangerous driving
situations."</TE>
<TE>   The study also found that a majority of those surveyed who have
navigation systems believe they should be allowed to enter
destinations and otherwise fiddle with their systems while they are
driving and are frustrated by those that have the audacity to require
them to stop their cars first.</TE>
<TE>   Safety advocates, start your engines!</TE>
<TE>   Getting used-car lowdown</TE>
<TE>   Another new J.D. Power study released this month could be helpful
for people looking to buy a used car.</TE>
<TE>   The company surveyed 10,000 buyers of late-model used vehicles and
found that that 47% of those who made a purchase this year went
online at some point, up from 26% in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   About 43% of buyers said they used a car dealer's Web site for
research and often found the best selections and most current
inventory data that way.</TE>
<TE>   But 92% said they went to at least one independent site, such as
Kelley Blue Book -- at www .kbb.com -- or AutoTrader.com.</TE>
<TE>   Kelley, which has its owns used-car buying service and links to
others, was favored by those looking for pricing information.
AutoTrader, which has a large classified section, was favored by
those interested in finding and buying a used vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Other online used-car sites, for those in the market, include
Cars.com, CarsDirect.com, Edmunds.com and UsedCars.com. Tribune Co.,
which owns the Los Angeles Times, holds a stake in Cars.com.</TE>

<HD>A sleek 'American' concept from Aston</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Aston Martin is set to tease fans next month with the world debut in
Los Angeles of a two-seat, aluminum, concept car based on the DB7
Vantage Volante and aimed specifically at the American market.</LD>
<LD>   The Volante is a ragtop convertible, but Aston Martin says the
concept car -- dubbed the DB AR1, (for American Roadster) -- will
have a heavily revised aluminum bodywork by Italian design house
Zagato.</LD>
<LD>   A sketch just released by the company shows a smooth, short-tailed
body with a fairing covering the area that houses rudimentary back
seats. The rear end is smoother and less cluttered than the
Volante's, with single round taillights on each side and fat exhaust
tips peeking out from beneath a body-colored integrated rear bumper.</LD>
<TE>   The elegant Aston Martin logo is perched beneath a centered brake
light tucked beneath a small, flipped-up spoiler. The rear fenders
also are fatter and give the car a more muscular stance than the
Volante, and the side panels are smoother.</TE>
<TE>   Aston Martin says the concept car will use the Volante's V-12
engine, but kicked up to 435 horsepower from the standard 420. The
interior, which hasn't been shown yet, will be unique to the car, the
company says.</TE>
<TE>   The unveiling is set for the Los Angeles International Auto Show,
which opens Jan. 4 at the L.A. Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   The company says if there is sufficient interest, it will
hand-build a small number of cars at the Bloxham plant in England
where the DB7 is made.</TE>
<TE>   No pricing information was released, but "hand-build" is a pretty
good sign it will cost a lot more than the $146,000-$156,000 DB7
Vantage Volante.</TE>

<HD>Carpool lane is not a license to speed</HD>

<LD>Question: Why do some people get in the carpool or diamond lane and
act like it's a speedway? When I use that lane, I drive at the posted
speeds, or a little faster if cars are behind me. Invariably, someone
will tailgate and flash their lights. When I'm caught in this
situation, should I cross the solid yellow lines to get out of the
carpool lane or just continue until I can legally exit?</LD>

<TE>   Answer: Motorists who think driving in the carpool lane gives them
a license to speed are on top of my list of pet peeves. But no matter
how obnoxious or reckless a tailgater may become, don't get out of
the way by crossing the double yellow lines. It's illegal and you
could be cited, said California Highway Patrol spokesman Sgt. Troy
Lukkes. If you are driving at the 65-mph speed limit, you are not
obligated to increase your speed or clear the way for a driver who is
exceeding the designated limit in the carpool lane, Lukkes said.</TE>
<TE>   Hold your ground and stay in the lane, or wait until signs
indicate that you can legally exit the lane and merge into general
traffic. Because you don't know how volatile the driver behind you
is, the safest course of action may be to exit at the appropriate
place.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know what kind of road rage could develop," Lukkes
said.</TE>
<TE>   If a speeding motorist in the carpool lane tailgates and flashes
lights in an attempt to intimidate you, he suggests reporting the
incident and the vehicle's license plate number by calling
(800)TELLCHP (835-5247).</TE>
<TE>   However, if the driver's actions are so reckless as to endanger
the lives of others, call 911.</TE>
<TE>   A call to the 800 number could result in the CHP sending a letter
to the owner of the vehicle describing what the driver was spotted
doing, Lukkes said. Sometimes the letters alert parents to their
children's risky driving habits, he said. "We enforce the
carpool-lane speeding violations just like we do all the others,"
Lukkes said.</TE>
<TE>   The one exception that allows you to leave the carpool lane by
legally crossing the double yellow lines is when a police car or
other emergency vehicle is behind you with red lights flashing,
Lukkes said.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, if you're a slowpoke in the carpool lane, be courteous
and make a legal exit when you can. Driving slowly and backing up
traffic can be dangerous because people get impatient and take
chances trying to pass.</TE>
<TE>   Though there is plenty of anecdotal information about drivers
speeding in carpool lanes, neither the CHP nor the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration tracks the number of speeding citations
or accidents that occur in these lanes. In March, a Los Angeles woman
was killed and her 19-year-old passenger injured when she lost
control of her car while traveling in the carpool lane at 100-plus
mph on the Antelope Valley Freeway in Newhall, according to the CHP.</TE>
<TE>   Carpool lanes encourage drivers to share rides and help ease
freeway traffic congestion, said Candysse Miller, executive director
of the Insurance Information Network of California. But driving in
the carpool lane poses risks, particularly where the lanes end and
merge into general traffic, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a great view of the San Bernardino carpool lane as I zip
down the center of the freeway on the Metrolink each day. There's a
lot of carpool lane abuse out there," Miller said. "Aside from all
the illegal merges, only about 1 out of every 5 cars is driving
legally in the lanes."</TE>

<HD>For Christmas, a gift of emeralds in amber</HD>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nut brittle is one of those delicious old standbys at Christmas, but
this recipe takes the familiar and gives it a tweak. First, it uses
pistachios. The translucent amber of the caramelized sugar is studded
with vibrant green nuts, which show reddish skin.</LD>
<LD>   And if your kitchen is equipped with silicone baking mats -- those
handy, rubbery sheets that line baking sheets so well -- use them to
finesse your brittle. (One popular brand is Silpat.) You'll wind up
with a perfectly flat, smooth sheet of candy, wonderful for breaking
into jagged-edged pieces.</LD>
<LD>   The key to great brittle is to cook the sugar carefully to keep it
smooth without any crystallization and then to press it flat. This
brittle keeps for weeks as long as it is kept cool and dry.</LD>
<TE>   Pistachio  Nut brittle</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 10-12 (About 1 pound)</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups raw unsalted pistachios</TE>
<TE>   1 1/3 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup water</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup light corn syrup</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted European-style butter</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon baking soda</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Spread the pistachios on a baking
sheet and toast until lightly browned, about 9 to 10 minutes. Allow
to cool on a rack.</TE>
<TE>   2. Line a jellyroll pan with a silicone baking mat. (Or butter a
jellyroll pan.) Have another jellyroll pan and baking mat ready if
using the baking mats.</TE>
<TE>   3. Mix together the sugar, water, light corn syrup and butter in a
large, heavy saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring
just until the butter is incorporated and the sugar crystals are
dissolved. Remove the spoon and do not stir again. Keep a small bowl
of ice water and a pastry brush handy to brush down the sides of the
pot as any sugar crystals start to form (this prevents the sugar from
crystallizing and producing a grainy brittle). Simmer until the
mixture turns a rich amber color, 12 to 14 minutes. Keep a close
watch as the sugar will begin to turn amber quickly. Remove the pan
from the heat. (It probably will not color evenly, but do not worry
as the next step will mix it thoroughly).</TE>
<TE>   4. Quickly mix in the baking soda, salt, vanilla and pistachios
and pour the mixture onto the baking mat-lined pan. Flatten the
mixture with the other baking mat to make a thin layer of brittle.
(Or, if using the buttered jellyroll pan, use a buttered, offset
spatula to quickly spread the mixture about 1/4-inch thick.) The
mixture will be very hot and you may need to wear a kitchen mitt as
you press on top of the mat to smooth the layer of brittle. Place the
other jellyroll pan on top of the mat and press very hard to form an
even layer. Lift off the pan and peel up the top mat. Place the
bottom jellyroll pan with the brittle on a rack to cool thoroughly.
When cool, break into pieces and store in a parchment-lined airtight
tin.</TE>

<KH>A HOLIDAY SPECIAL ISSUE</KH>
<HD>The one Christmas cookie that's made the world over</HD>
<DH>Is it a Russian tea cake or Mexican wedding cake? A sandy
or snowball? Its origins are mysterious, but whatever you call this
buttery and crumbly confection, its many names are proof of its wide
appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Regina Schrambling</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's easy to describe the ideal Christmas cookie: kid-simple to make,
rich but not really sweet, a good keeper but so buttery-crunchy you
want to eat the whole batch before they cool.</LD>
<LD>   Deciding on a name for this perfection is apparently a little
trickier.</LD>
<LD>   Is it a snowball or a butterball? A sand tart or a sandy? A pecan
ball or an almond melt-away? My de facto mother-in-law, who is
second-generation Polish, says they're Mexican wedding cakes. But
when I was growing up, in a Mexican neighborhood in Arizona, I knew
them as Russian tea cakes.</LD>
<TE>   Everyone agrees on the basic recipe for these powdery white
confections -- always butter, powdered sugar, flour and very finely
chopped nuts -- and on the shape -- round and slightly flat. But the
definitive title for that recipe is still being drafted.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Malgieri, a cookbook author and history-obsessed baking
teacher in New York, admitted to being puzzled about the back story.
Eastern Europe was his guess on the homeland of what he calls a pecan
ball, since Viennese almond crescents are very similar cookies, with
a low-sugar, high-nut ratio for melting texture and taste.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that the cookies do have a Spanish name, polvorones,
Malgieri speculated that they migrated to Mexico with European nuns.
"Convents were places where they did a lot of baking in Mexico," he
said. "These may be a convent sweet that went public."</TE>
<TE>   It's a plausible theory, and it explains why I've found so many
recipes for the cookies made with pecans, which are so common in
Mexico, and flavored with either vanilla (also Mexican) or aniseed or
cinnamon, which are the designated spices in other cookies below the
border.</TE>
<TE>   Still, I came across them in exactly one of my many Mexican
cookbooks, and then only as wedding "cookies" rather than cakes.
Marge Poore, in "1,000 Mexican Recipes" (Hungry Minds, 2001), says
there are several versions of polvorones in different parts of Mexico
that are served at weddings and on special occasions. The name, she
writes, comes from the word for dust, "because of the light, flaky
texture and coating of sugar."</TE>
<TE>   Being partial to the Russian roots, I contacted Darra Goldstein, a
professor at Williams College in Massachusetts who is the leading
authority on Russian cuisine. Her response: "I just took a quick tour
of my Russian-language cookbooks, including some old ones, and didn't
find anything that resembles the tea cakes.</TE>
<TE>   "Just about all of the nut cookies they make are rolled and then
sprinkled with nuts, usually almonds," she said. "Even if the nuts
are mixed in, the dough tends to be rolled out and then cut. My best
guess is that the cookies are called 'Russian' in the U.S. by
association with tea. The image of a hissing samovar and tea cookies
is, in fact, very Russian, so perhaps that's how they got their
name."</TE>
<TE>   By then I was ready to abandon the background check and start
baking. I had not made Russian tea cakes since leaving home in the
last century, so I started by comparing the dozens of recipes in all
my cookbooks. Aside from cooking times and sugar measurements, they
varied surprisingly little, although I did come across a few versions
that called for adding liquids and maple syrup and chilling the dough
and generally defeating the purpose of this high-yield,
minimal-effort cookie.</TE>
<TE>   I also did what any think-globally cook does today: hit the Google
button on my browser. After turning up 964 references to Mexican and
1,030 to Russian, I gave up and called my consort's mother for the
Mexican wedding cake recipe she has been using for nearly 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about sweet and easy: The most tedious part was chopping the
nuts (she uses walnuts; I'm an urban snob who couldn't resist pine
nuts). And I did think they could use just a bit of salt to separate
the creamy overlap of the nuts and the butter. Otherwise, they were a
five-step breeze: cream butter and sugar, add flour and nuts, roll
into fat balls, bake and coat in powdered sugar.</TE>
<TE>   Not willing to leave great enough alone, I tried substituting
grated lime zest for her vanilla and sliced, toasted, crushed almonds
for the nuts. A few dashes of angostura bitters acted the way they do
in a good rum punch, accentuating the citrus flavor and countering
the direct sweetness. (Orange zest without the bitters is apparently
a more common flavoring in Mexican/Russian snowballs.)</TE>
<TE>   Finally, knowing that chocolate is the deal-sealing equivalent of
0% financing in the cookie world, I mixed some really good cocoa
powder into a third batch. (The way this cookie dissolves in your
mouth is key to its bliss quotient, and chunks of chocolate would
have interrupted the meltdown.) Since the ratio of dry to buttery
ingredients is so important, I compensated for the cocoa by cutting
back on the flour and adding more pecans.</TE>
<TE>   By then I had figured out it was easiest to get the nuts really
fine not by slaving with a knife but by putting them in a big Baggie
and running a rolling pin over them, so that they were crushed but
not pulverized into an oily butter.</TE>
<TE>   All three variations yielded perfect cookies that soaked up all
the powdered sugar I could sift onto them. I was actually beginning
to think the name didn't really matter when a friend who grew up in
the Bay Area walked into the cloud of white in the kitchen and said
excitedly: "Russian tea cakes!" Then she added, hesitantly, "Or do
you call them Mexican wedding cakes?"</TE>
<TE>   The answer seems to be: Don't ask, just roll.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Classic Mexican wedding cakes</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 30 minutes, plus 30 minutes chilling</TE>
<TE>   Servings: About 36</TE>
<TE>   Note: To toast nuts, spread them on a baking sheet and toast at
350 degrees until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Use pecans,
walnuts, peeled hazelnuts, almonds or a combination. The cookies also
are good with pine nuts, but they do not need toasting.</TE>
<TE>   1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened, cut into chunks</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup powdered sugar, sifted, plus 1 to 1 1/2 cups for dusting</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   2 cups flour, sifted</TE>
<TE>   1 cup very finely chopped toasted nuts</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 325 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   2. Combine the butter, 3/4 cup powdered sugar, salt and vanilla in
the bowl of an electric mixer and beat until creamy. Beat in the
flour and nuts. Chill the dough 30 to 60 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   3. Shape the dough into balls about 1 inch across (use a 1-inch
scoop, if you have one, to make the balls consistent in size).
Arrange them on ungreased baking sheets about one-half inch apart.
Bake on the center rack of the oven until the cookies are set on top
and deep golden on bottom, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate the baking sheets
halfway through baking.</TE>
<TE>   4. Transfer the cookies to a rack and immediately dust heavily
with powdered sugar. Cool completely, then turn out into a large bowl
and thickly dust with the remaining powdered sugar, coating all
sides. Store airtight.</TE>
<TE>   Each cookie: 102 calories; 17 mg. sodium; 14 mg. cholesterol; 7
grams fat; 3 grams saturated fat; 8 grams carbohydrates; 2 grams
protein; 0.36 gram fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Variations:</TE>
<TE>   Almond-lime wedding cakes: Omit the vanilla and add the grated
zest of 2 large limes and a few dashes of bitters while creaming the
butter. Use sliced almonds, lightly toasted and finely crushed, for
the nuts. Proceed as directed.</TE>
<TE>   Cocoa wedding cakes: Place 3 tablespoons of top-quality
Dutch-process cocoa powder in the bowl before creaming the butter and
powdered sugar. Increase the vanilla to 1 1/2 teaspoons. Cut the
flour by 2 tablespoons. Increase the finely chopped nuts to 1 1/4
cups. Proceed as directed.</TE>

<KH>COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: ETHIOPIA</KH>
<HD></HD>
<DH>Meals by Genet boasts African stews, fish and flatbread,
with a taste of Italy too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Meals by Genet? Would this be based on recipes of a French
existentialist thief/playwright? Intrigued, you stick your head in
and discover a stylish little Ethiopian restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   Not terribly surprising, since we are in Little Addis Ababa -- the
block of Fairfax Avenue south of Olympic Boulevard full of
restaurants serving spicy, buttery Ethiopian stews on a flatbread
that is both plate and eating utensil.</LD>
<LD>   The name actually refers to Genet Agonafer's catering business,
Meals by Genet. Agonafer originally took this location to have a
professional kitchen but has opened it as a restaurant.</LD>
<TE>   It's a smallish storefront, but it boasts a bar, and the decor is
spare and elegant. The chairs have narrow ladder backs; there are
pieces of African art on the walls.</TE>
<TE>   Agonafer specializes in catering for film shoots, and she's
definitely tuned in to Hollywood. One day I was sitting in her
restaurant, minding my business and working through an order of
yebere siga tibs, when a guy came in and asked Agonafer whether his
film could shoot a scene there. Not a bit surprised, she merely
insisted on knowing the name of the production before she would say
yes or no.</TE>
<TE>   The menu is about equally divided between Ethiopian and European
dishes, the latter mostly being Italian (a legacy of Italy's 1935-41
rule of Ethiopia). Some other Ethiopian restaurants have a pasta or
two, but Agonafer is a versatile cook and her Italian dishes are not
mere pasta in marinara sauce. She serves a beautifully grilled salmon
topped with basil and chopped tomatoes along with some linguine in a
lively tomato cream sauce. She's likely to protest if you order
Ethiopian side dishes along with it on the grounds that they don't go
together, but she volunteers a little cup of ground Ethiopian chiles,
surprisingly good with this dish.</TE>
<TE>   Even on the Ethiopian side of the menu, everything is a la carte;
unlike other Ethiopian places around town, Meals by Genet doesn't
automatically give you a couple of vegetable sides with your entree.
For $10 you can add a big selection of them (which can also serve as
a vegetarian dinner by itself). They include collards, a green salad
with bits of hot pepper in it, a jalapeno stuffed with tomatoes, two
kinds of garbanzo puree, a sunflower seed puree, lentils dosed with
horseradish-like Ethiopian mustard and a spicy mush of tomatoes and
tangy Ethiopian flatbread.</TE>
<TE>   With every Ethiopian entree you do get that crepe-like bread,
injera, dark with teff, the iron-rich grain of the Ethiopian
highlands. The food is served on a big injera and you get all the
injeras you need for tearing off swatches to pick up the food.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the best-known Ethiopian dishes are available,
including doro wat, the national stew of chicken with ground red
chiles. Agonafer's version, which she says takes two days to make,
has a very dense, sweetish sauce with a bit of spiciness. It comes
with the traditional addition of a hard-boiled egg.</TE>
<TE>   Kitfo, the dish of raw chopped beef mixed with Ethiopian spiced
butter, is served slightly warmed here, at least in cold weather. It
has a handsome light ruby color and admirable balance, not
ostentatiously buttery or spicy.</TE>
<TE>   Yebere siga tibs is basically a big pile of very tender steak
chunks, sauteed in Ethiopian butter, with an elusive, poetic aroma of
cardamom and other spices. It comes with a little pot of awaze, which
is simply a puree of quite hot chiles.</TE>
<TE>   There's a slightly tart lamb stew, yebeg siga alitcha, flavored
with a mixture of spices in which you can detect ginger as well as
cardamom and hot chile. The meat, which has plenty of the gamy tang
lamb lovers enjoy, is partly mixed with bits of injera to soak up the
juices.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of the list of Ethiopian dishes there's a surprise:
trout. Well, if you live in the Ethiopian highlands, it's freshwater
fish you eat, not red snapper.</TE>
<TE>   Agonafer's way of cooking trout is to deep-fry the whole fish,
much the way people deep-fry a whole turkey. It's quite successful,
the skin crisp and golden brown, the flesh moist and flavorful.</TE>
<TE>   Appetizers aren't part of the Ethiopian tradition, and there
aren't any here. Nor is dessert traditional. If you really feel the
need for dessert, though -- you're already getting a lot of food if
your table has ordered the vegetable side dishes -- the choices are
vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce or cheesecake. I'm just

<KH>MATTERS OF TASTE / David Shaw</KH>
<HD>Keep reds out of saunas, whites out of freezers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Shaw</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MOST Americans drink their white wines too cold. Their attitude is
best summed up by a comment an otherwise sophisticated (and
wine-loving) friend of mine once made over lunch: "White wine is just
supposed to quench your thirst and refresh you."</LD>
<LD>   Sure, some light, crisp whites -- Muscadet, Sauvignon Blanc,
Albarino -- are refreshing. But thirst-quenching? Personally, I
prefer water. White wine -- good white wine, especially Rieslings
from Alsace, Germany and Austria, and the better Chardonnay-based
whites from Burgundy and Napa and Sonoma -- can be lush and
luxurious. They're wines to be sipped and savored, ideal
accompaniments to a wide range of foods.</LD>
<LD>   Chilling these wines too much mutes their flavors and suppresses
their distinctive aromas. I might like a raspberry Popsicle on a hot
day, but if I'm eating dinner, I'd much rather have fresh raspberries
for dessert.</LD>
<TE>   Having said that, I think many restaurants make an even bigger
mistake with their red wines than their customers make with white
wines. Too many red wines are served too warm.</TE>
<TE>   Too warm for red is as bad as too cold for white. You can't really
taste or smell the wine as it was meant to be. At temperatures much
above 68 degrees, the alcohol evaporates quickly, upsetting the
balance in red wine and leaving it flabby-tasting.</TE>
<TE>   When people say red wine should be served at room temperature,
they often forget that when that term was coined, central heating was
not common; rooms in most homes were considerably cooler than they
are today.</TE>
<TE>   When restaurateurs tell me their reds are "room temperature," I
often say, "But the room in question shouldn't be a sauna."</TE>
<TE>   Restaurants don't store their wine in a sauna, of course. They may
even have temperature-controlled cellars. But to avoid forcing the
wait staff to run to the cellar to fill every order, they keep some
bottles at the bar or in another convenient (but not necessarily
cool) location in the restaurant. This is a problem both in the hot
summer months and now, in the winter holiday season, when restaurants
often crank up the thermostat to keep customers comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   I've even seen wine stored, standing up, on a high shelf that
backs up to the kitchen wall -- and in a couple of instances, in the
kitchen itself.</TE>
<TE>   Why go to the trouble of buying good wine if you're not going to
store it -- all of it -- properly? Don't these restaurateurs realize
that if a customer buys a wine and isn't happy with it, he may not
order wine next time -- especially if he's relatively new to wine and
isn't quite sure why he's disappointed in that bottle? Worse yet, he
may decide not to return at all.</TE>
<TE>   The "correct" temperature for red wines (and for whites, for that
matter) varies depending the varietal. Just as sparkling wines and
dessert wines are best when served colder than a full-bodied
Chardonnay, so a Beaujolais should be served cooler than a good
Bordeaux.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Burgundy usually tastes best when served cooler (say, 58
to 62 degrees) than Bordeaux (say, 62 to 66 degrees).</TE>
<TE>   You probably don't carry a wine thermometer to the restaurant with
you. I don't. You may not have one at home either. I have several --
all gifts -- but I never use them. What I do use is common sense or
-- more precisely -- my palate and my nose.</TE>
<TE>   Even experts disagree on the precise temperature at which various
wines best show their true selves. The real issues are: How does the
wine smell? How does it taste? Remember, wine is made from fruit,
from grapes. Can you smell and taste the fruit -- any fruit -- or is
the wine flat or flabby or one-dimensional? Unlike a steak, which
can't be made more rare if it's overcooked, wine can be adjusted to
your palate once served.</TE>
<TE>   When I'm served a red that's too warm, I politely ask the waiter
to put it in an ice bucket for 10 minutes or so. Some of them look at
me as if I'd asked them to put ice cubes in my Corton-Charlemagne.
But I don't want the wine chilled; I just want it cooled slightly to
proper drinking temperature.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, if you order white wine and it arrives ice-cold, ask
the waiter or sommelier to leave the bottle on the table instead of
plunging it into an ice bucket after you've had your first taste. If
you drink a wine that's been chilled to just 54 to 57 degrees,
instead of five or 10 degrees cooler, you might be surprised by the
nuances in taste you'll discover -- and by the way the wine evolves
as you empty the bottle.</TE>

<KH>HOLIDAY COOKING : A SPECIAL ISSUE</KH>
<HD>Mince pie lives!</HD>
<DH>With some modern ideas and great dried fruits, we rescue
the archaic treat from fading into obscurity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IN 1895, at a time when diet reformers had made "pie" a dirty word,
"The Century Cookbook" felt obliged to note that mince pie ("the most
indigestible of all") was still "the one universally accepted as a
treat, and seldom refused by the scoffer."</LD>
<LD>   Half a century earlier, the influential writer Sarah Josepha Hale
made the same point, rather testily: "The custom of eating mince pies
at Christmas was too firmly rooted for the 'Pilgrim Fathers' to
abolish; so it would be vain for me to attempt it. At Thanksgiving
too, they are considered indispensable; but I may be allowed to hope
that during the remainder of the year, this rich, expensive and
exceedingly unhealthy diet will be used very sparingly....[F]or
children they should be forbidden food; so tempting is the taste,
that the only security consists in not tasting."</LD>
<LD>   Mince pie, the irresistible temptation? The addictive menace?
Could this really be mince pie they were talking about? These days
you never see it outside of holiday dinners, and it's fading even
there. The Food section has managed to go eight years now without
publishing a single mincemeat recipe.</LD>
<TE>   The fact is, it's amazing that mince pie has lasted as long as it
has. It's the most archaic dish still being made. It's literally
medieval.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle ages, a pie was something between a feast dish and a
way of canning. Originally the main pie ingredients were meat and
spices, though dried fruits were often thrown in. A 1450 recipe for
"grete pye" calls for beef, chickens, two kinds of duck, a couple of
rabbits and various large birds, such as storks, along with dates,
raisins and prunes. A yard or so across and baked in a thick crust
which nobody expected you to eat, one of these big jobs would keep
for months.</TE>
<TE>   "Mince" means "made small," and in the 16th century people started
making mince pies, meaning smaller ones than great pies. Being
smaller, they had no room for whole chickens, to say nothing of whole
storks. In fact, the ingredients fit the pie pan better if you
chopped them up, making "minced meat." Eventually, people started
thinking that mince pie took its name from the mincemeat filling and
sometimes even called it "shred pie."</TE>
<TE>   You have to remember that sugar was prohibitively expensive until
the 18th century. Apart from honey, which is not a pastry-friendly
ingredient, the only source of sweetness in Europe was fruit, and
dried fruits were generally sweeter than fresh. This explains a lot
of traditional raisin buns and plum puddings. They may not seem
exciting today, but once upon a time they were rare treats.</TE>
<TE>   Raisins also had prestige value in northern Europe because they
were an expensive imported ingredient. But you had to cut raisins
open one by one and remove the seeds, so currants, being seedless,
were better (and, of course, more expensive). Apples were more
reasonably priced but not sweet enough for pie unless mixed with
dried fruit, so the vast majority of mince pies over the centuries
have used some combination of raisins, currants and apples.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing the medieval tradition, mincemeat did contain meat. In
fact, all sorts of meat have shown up in mince pies. A recipe from
Shakespeare's time called for mutton. Over the centuries recipes have
called for beef brisket, beef shank, cow head, oxheart, even tripe.
Boiled tongue was particularly popular in the 18th and 19th
centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes mincemeat was a way of using ham trimmings or bits of
pork left over from sausage-making. In "The Frugal Housewife" (1830),
Lydia Maria Francis Child wrote, "No economical household will
despise (mince pie), for broken bits of meat and vegetables cannot so
well be disposed of by any other method."</TE>
<TE>   But as Europe's sweet tooth grew, people put more and more fruit
into mincemeat, and eventually sugar or molasses too, and the meat
became a secondary ingredient. Or even less than secondary. In the
late 17th century cooks started substituting suet, the fat around the
beef kidneys, for meat. Meat entirely dropped out of the recipe in
19th century England, though it remained a common ingredient in this
country. The suet made the pie richer, but since suet is as hard as
tallow at room temperature, it became essential to serve mince pie
hot -- reheated, if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   But that was part of the plan anyway. Mince pie was a calorie-rich
food for cold weather. You'd make a bunch of mincemeat at the end of
fall and keep it in a crock for mixing with chopped apples whenever
you wanted to make pie during the winter. To preserve the mincemeat,
you added brandy or whiskey to it, just as with fruitcake. The liquor
part rubbed the anti-alcohol crowd wrong, so they invented
liquor-free mincemeat. (Inevitably, liquorless mince pies were
nicknamed "humbug" pies.)</TE>
<TE>   After the Civil War, a wave of diet reform swept the country, and
the reformers' main target was pie -- above all, mince pie. If you
ask people today what dangers a suet-rich pie poses, the answers will
probably be obesity and cholesterol, but neither was on the
reformers' minds; their objection was that mince pie was
indigestible. And the main danger of indigestion was that it caused
nightmares ... an idea that faded away during the last
psychiatry-oriented century.</TE>
<TE>   And so did mince pie. Why? Maybe people decided they didn't like
the suet, and certainly some people feel there's something wrong
about putting meat into a dessert. But I think it's mostly that we
have a lot more food choices during the winter these days. If you
want pie in December, you no longer have to rummage through the apple
cellar and scoop some mincemeat out of a stone crock, you can have
peach or strawberry or boysenberry pie any day of the year, just by
shopping the frozen foods aisle.</TE>
<TE>   So the question is, where does mince pie go these days, now that
the seasons no longer rule our tables and raisins are no longer a
huge thrill?</TE>
<TE>   We decided to explore a new direction for it. In farmers markets
you can find people who are making some positively exciting dried
fruits. We reconceived mince pie as a dessert showcasing them.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, we eliminated the meat and suet. We called a chef or
two for suggestions. And then we started cooking.</TE>
<TE>   The result amazed even die-hard mince haters. In place of all
those musky raisins and the heavy cinnamon-clove-nutmeg range of
spices, there was a mix of sweet and sour dried fruits (plus an
aromatic quince) with a kick of ginger and cardamom. This was no
heavy, chewy pie for cold weather but a platter of individual
mini-tarts full of bright fruit flavors in a delicate buttery crust.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, people started thinking along these lines a century ago.
It was then that mincemeat recipes started showing up that included
dried peaches or cherries, not to mention plum or strawberry
preserves. So we can claim to be working in the mince pie tradition.</TE>
<TE>   It's a worthy tradition. In "The Buckeye Cookbook" (1877), Estelle
Woods Wilcox wrote: "Its preparation should be confined to no
careless or unworthy hands, but every ingredient should be
thoughtfully provided and delicately prepared, and blended with the
skill of an artist, and the precision of a mechanic. Tact, wisdom,
judgment, knowledge and experience all go into the proper
construction of a genuine mince-pie, to say nothing of kindness of
heart and liberality of disposition."</TE>
<TE>   Hear, hear.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Modern mincemeat</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour, 20 minutes, plus 8 hours chilling</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 20-24 (About 6 cups)</TE>
<TE>   Note: In developing this recipe, Times Test Kitchen Director Donna
Deane polled a few local pastry chefs. Nancy Silverton of Campanile,
who gave us the idea for mini-tarts, suggested Scotch to give our
mincemeat a smoky undertone. We added candied ginger, fruit zest and
ground cardamom -- an idea from Kimberly Sklar of Lucques in West
Hollywood. We scoured farmers markets and well-stocked grocery stores
for dried fruits.</TE>
<TE>   5 cups peeled and chopped Granny Smith apples (about 4 apples)</TE>
<TE>   1 quince, peeled and chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 cup dried plums, chopped (about 4 ounces)</TE>
<TE>   1 cup dried sliced persimmons, chopped (about 4 ounces)</TE>
<TE>   1 cup dried sour cherries (about 5 ounces)</TE>
<TE>   1 cup golden raisins</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup chopped pitted dates</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons minced candied ginger</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg</TE>

<TE>   Modern mincemeat tarts</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour, 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 36 mini-tarts</TE>
<TE>   Note: Serve the tarts warm with a small scoop of vanilla or eggnog

<TE>   1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds, roughly chopped</TE>
<TE>   3 cups modern mincemeat</TE>
<TE>   3 cups flour</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons salt</TE>
<TE>   1 cup (2 sticks) cold butter, cut into small pieces</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons ice water</TE>
<TE>   1 egg, beaten</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   2. Stir the almonds into the mincemeat; set aside.</TE>
<TE>   3. Combine the flour and salt in a bowl. Cut in the butter until
evenly blended with the flour. Drizzle the ice water over top and use
a fork to mix the dough until a ball forms. Divide the dough into 3
parts.</TE>
<TE>   4. Roll one portion of dough out on a lightly floured surface.
Using a 3 1/4-inch round cutter, cut out 12 rounds of dough. Press
the rounds of dough into the bottom and sides of a 12-cup mini-muffin
pan. Fill each cup with 1 tablespoon of mincemeat. Fold the edges of
the dough over the filling (the centers will be open). Brush the
edges of the crust with the beaten egg.</TE>
<TE>   5. Bake until the dough is lightly browned, about 20 minutes.
Remove from the oven; let the mini-tarts cool in the pan a few
minutes until they're easy to handle, then remove to a wire rack to
cool. Repeat with each of the remaining two portions of dough and
filling.</TE>

<KH>THE REVIEW</KH>
<HD>It's J. Lo's place, and for fans that's enough</HD>
<DH>Madre's, the latest celebrity restaurant, is in quiet
Pasadena, of all places. It has the look of Old Havana and a
Cuban-fusion menu.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TRY making a reservation at Madre's, mega-star Jennifer Lopez's
Pasadena restaurant. Half the time you get an answering machine that
requests you leave your name and number, but before you can do so, a
robotic voice cuts in with the information that the message box is
full.</LD>
<LD>   After a couple more tries, booking a table at Madre's begins to
seem like a full-time job. And the prospect of joining the mob of
avid fans who are presumably thronging this 7-month-old restaurant
doesn't hold the same thrill. When I finally manage to get someone on
the phone, I get the usual trendy restaurant routine: the choice of a
table at 6:30 p.m. or 9:30 p.m. For J. Lo -- anything.</LD>
<LD>   Quiet Pasadena, though, seems an odd choice for the star's
restaurant. West Hollywood or the Sunset Strip, even Los Feliz makes
more sense. But for whatever reason, the singer, movie star and
former Fly Girl chose to install Madre's on a dark side street
downtown.</LD>
<TE>   As we pull up in front, the valet opens the door for a Latina
woman dressed to kill, her long hair streaming like J. Lo's. Outside
the entrance a trio of young fans, each holding a doggy bag, wait for
their car on a bench sheltered by a stylish white-and-tan striped
awning.</TE>
<TE>   At the immense dark-wood bar where fat ivory candles burn, a
bartender twirls his cocktail shaker like a six-shooter. The drinks
are good. He makes a mean Manhattan and sugary mojitos laced with rum
and sprigs of mint. A trio of strolling musicians playing "Besame
Mucho" adds some life.</TE>
<TE>   The menu cover, a replica of a fanciful cigar box, reads "Madre's,
a Latin restaurant," but for all intents and purposes, it's Cuban
with a few dishes from other Latin countries thrown into the mix.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant, designed by Rachel Ashwell of Shabby Chic, has the
muted look of a vintage photo of Old Havana with dark wood and
high-gloss cream walls. Long, dusty-rose damask velvet curtains
divide the dining room from the bar, and are pulled back in front of
several romantic booths. Velvet banquettes and pale pink chair backs
echo the colors in the roses tucked into silver vases at each table.</TE>
<TE>   The room has a festive, romantic feel and a flea market chic.
Tables are set with antique embroidered linens, cut-glass stemware
and flowered china. The whole effect is very pretty and girly.</TE>
<TE>   Waiter?</TE>
<TE>   Although Ashwell has created a warm and inviting set, Lopez has
failed to pass out a script. Nobody seems to be in charge at Madre's.
The staff sometimes acts as if they wonder what you're doing there.
Yet people just keep coming, drawn by the J. Lo connection.
Eventually they won't. Because the management isn't doing anything to
keep them or to acknowledge the effort fans made to come and check
out their favorite star's restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   No one is expecting to find her greeting people at the door, or
smooching with the sexiest man alive in one of the private booths.
But the restaurant should feel as if someone is at home and taking
care of business.</TE>
<TE>   The major shortcoming is the food. Except for a few dishes, it's
beyond unmemorable. It may be the worst Cuban food in Southern
California. The best things on the menu are the black beans and rice,
which come with entrees. The beans are soft and well-seasoned, served
slightly soupy.</TE>
<TE>   Tostones, smashed green plantains fried to a pale gold, are
delicious, too. Salads, such as ensalada tradicional of romaine,
cucumbers and tomatoes in a citrus-drenched vinaigrette, or a similar
one topped with ripe avocado, are pleasant, though not particularly
distinctive. Black bean soup, usually one of the glories of Cuban
cuisine, is a dark sludge of beans with barely any seasoning.</TE>
<TE>   Other starters include empanadas with a rather tough crust and
either a spiced beef filling or chicken, and a mild and very ordinary
Cuban-style tamale filled with either chicken or pork. Papas
rellenos, potatoes stuffed with ground beef, are best skipped.</TE>
<TE>   A number of the main courses are close to inedible. Ropa vieja,
how bad can it be? This beef has had all the life cooked out of it,
and isn't helped by the limp khaki peppers and carrots thrown on top.
The best thing about arroz con pollo is the rice, and that's not
saying much. One night, a special roast Cornish game hen is so
overcooked, its gummy stuffing of black beans and rice seems more
appealing than the bird. Marinated oxtail slowly stewed in Spanish
wine is marginally better.</TE>
<TE>   But compared with the seafood I tried, they were the highlights of
the menu. "El Volcan," one of the specials of the house, is a tower

from the table nearly intact. A special seafood soup is filled with
sorry fish and shellfish cooked so long none of it has any flavor and
everything has an unappealing, dull cast. None of it tastes that
fresh either and no one at our table takes more than a bite.</TE>
<TE>   Enough</TE>
<TE>   The couple next to us one night pick desultorily at their food.
When plates that are virtually untouched are so common, and no one is
concerned enough to ask if anything is wrong, it can't be a good
sign. I suspect no one wants to hear the answer.</TE>
<TE>   The best thing about Madre's is the crowd. Everyone is out to have
a good time, and they do, despite everything.</TE>

<KH>HOLIDAY COOKING : A SPECIAL ISSUE</KH>
<HD>The essential roast</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A big roast is the very image of a holiday dinner centerpiece. But
lately you've probably been finding that the reality doesn't measure
up. Too often that roast, so monumental in appearance, is nothing but
a giant disappointment. What should be glorious and juicy turns out
to be only tough and dry.</LD>
<LD>   The fault isn't with the cook, but the cooked. Beef and pork are
now raised to have much less fat than before and that can mean a
disappointing dinner. Fortunately, it's a problem that is pretty
easily solved by careful preparation, though it may take some
retraining on your part.</LD>
<LD>   To unravel this particular puzzle, we searched through hundreds of
pages of scientific reports and then cooked about a dozen roasts. We
roasted pork and we roasted beef. We cooked them to medium
temperatures and rarer. We used ovens that were blazing and hot, or
gentle and slow, and some in between -- starting high and finishing
low.</LD>
<TE>   What we found surprised us. Looking at the sliced roasts side by
side, the differences were astonishing. You might never have guessed
that the only thing different about their preparation was the oven
temperature. And the secret to the most successful -- a moist,
delicious holiday roast -- was a low temperature, for the finished
roast and for the oven in which it's cooked.</TE>
<TE>   Don't panic, we're not talking about serving Uncle Bert bloody
rare roast beef. When cooked at the lower oven temperature for a
slightly longer time, a roast cooked to 125 degrees (normally quite
rare) came out looking more like a conservative medium-rare. The meat
was firm and definitely cooked through, but still juicy and
flavorful.</TE>
<TE>   Meat cooked in a hot oven, on the other hand, was still slightly
raw in the center -- even though it had been cooked to the exact same
temperature.</TE>
<TE>   To understand how this works, you need to know a little bit about
meat and heat. Roasts come from tender cuts of meat -- the muscles
that didn't get much exercise. Because they have less connective
tissue than other cuts, they can be cooked rarer and in an oven
instead of a covered pot -- it's the stringy sinewy cuts that need
the long moist cooking of a stew or braise.</TE>
<TE>   Dry cooking -- roasting, grilling and sauteing -- won't make meat
more tender, but it does have one distinct advantage over moist. It
can brown. The chemical reactions that cause browning in meat don't
begin to get going until the temperature on the surface reaches about
300 degrees. Since anything cooked with liquid present will never get
hotter than the boiling point -- 212 degrees -- braised meat will
never brown. That's why you saute stew meat before you add any
liquid. It's also why you should be sure to pat roasts completely dry
before putting them in the oven.</TE>
<TE>   It may sound redundant, but with these dry forms of cooking,
dryness is always a problem. But it isn't dry air that causes the
loss of juiciness, but the effects of the heat. When meat roasts, the
protein strands contract and squeeze out the moisture they hold (as
we'll see, as much as 25%).</TE>
<TE>   When there is fat in the meat -- either on the outside of the cut
or the fine marbling within the muscle -- this isn't such a problem.
The fat renders, too, and that makes them seem juicy even if there is
less actual moisture in the meat.</TE>
<TE>   And therein lies the rub. Responding to what they perceive as the
consumers' demands, the meat industry has been working overtime for
the last 20 years to reduce the amount of fat in their products. The
percentage of fat in the average piece of pork has been cut by a
third since the early 1980s. The percentage of fat in beef fell 27%
from the early '80s to 1990 and, according to a beef industry
spokesman, is "probably well below that now." In fact, some luxury
cuts such as sirloin and tenderloin now meet government standards as
"lean," meaning they are low in fat and cholesterol.</TE>
<TE>   This has been done with the intention of making all of us meat
eaters leaner as well, and someday it may succeed in that. But a more
immediate result has been to reduce the margin of error in roasting.
Today if you overcook meat even a little bit, your guests will know
it immediately.</TE>
<TE>   We found the key to our roasting puzzle in a scientific paper
titled "Effect of Temperature and Method of Cookery on the Retention
of Intramuscular Lipid in Beef and Pork" (now, doesn't that make you
hungry?). Among the findings was that "higher internal temperature
significantly increased shrinkage." What's more, for beef, the leaner
cuts lost more weight than the well-marbled ones cooked to the same
temperature.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, to keep this new lean meat moist and juicy, you
really need to cook it to a lower internal temperature -- rarer --
than you probably did before.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of cooking beef to 145 degrees (on the medium side of
medium-rare), we found that removing it from the oven at 125, then
being sure to let it rest and rise to 135 yielded beef that was still
firm but was far moister. For pork, use 145 degrees instead of 160
(or even, shudder, the previous USDA recommendation of 180!).</TE>
<TE>   Left unanswered was the question of at what temperature you cook
it.</TE>
<TE>   The great debate</TE>
<TE>   Students of the art of roasting are well familiar with the debate
over high-versus-low-heat roasting. It really hit the big-time in
1995 when Barbara Kafka published her book "Roasting," advocating
"hot ovens, short roasting times and rare meat." In this case, "hot"
means 500 degrees (an industrial strength kitchen exhaust fan is
presumed). The advantage of high-heat roasting is a really great
crust as well as, presumably, moister meat due to shorter cooking
time.</TE>
<TE>   The opposing camp is less focused on a single personality, but its
prime spokesman is probably Christopher Kimball of Cook's Illustrated
magazine. Low Heaters argue that a slower oven results in meat that
is moister and more tender. In an article last year, Cook's advocated
cooking roast beef at 250 degrees. Of course, that required first
searing it in a skillet on top of the stove to get any kind of crust
at all.</TE>
<TE>   Some cooks refuse to choose. They try to straddle the middle,
starting the meat at a high temperature and then turning it down
after a period of time ranging from 15 to 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   To get to the bottom of this, we took three beef and three pork
loins of roughly the same sizes and roasted them -- one each at
moderately high heat (450 degrees), one each at moderately low heat
(300 degrees) and one each straddling the fence (450 degrees turned
down to 300 after 15 minutes).</TE>
<TE>   When the roasts were done, we removed them from the oven and set
them aside for 10 to 15 minutes to rest. This is standard practice
for roasting, though it is often overlooked in the cook's rush to get
dinner on the table. It is important because it allows the roast to
finish cooking with the residual heat retained in the meat. The
internal temperature will increase from 5 to 15 degrees during the
rest, depending on the size of the cut (smaller cuts retain less
heat). Equally important, it allows the meat's juices, which have
been driven to the center by the heat of cooking, to redistribute
evenly through the roast.</TE>
<TE>   We cooked the beef to an internal temperature of 125 degrees.
After a 10-minute rest, it was at 135, on the rare side of
medium-rare -- definitely moist and reddish pink, but the muscle
fibers were set, not raw.</TE>
<TE>   The pork we cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees
(rising to 155 after the rest). This is somewhat lower than the
current USDA standard of 160 degrees, but well above the minimum for
safety. Pork needs to be held at 140 degrees for less than a minute
to eliminate any threat of trichinosis.</TE>
<TE>   Because moisture loss is such a problem with the new leaner pork,
many experts call for even lower internal temperatures. Specialty
meat purveyor Niman Ranch, for example, recommends an internal
temperature of 140 degrees rising to 150 for its pork. At that
temperature, pork is definitely pink and moist, but some find the
flavor a bit raw and metallic. At 145 degrees, pork is still moist
and faintly pink, but the flavor is rounder and fuller.</TE>
<TE>   The true test</TE>
<TE>   What we found in our roasts was that high temperature roasting
does develop a marginally better crust, but at a cost. The slight
improvement in the crust is more than offset by a distinct toughening
of the meat. The roasts cooked at 450 degrees were definitely chewy
and a little dry in the outside portions and were still quite rare in
the center. Except for the browning in the crust, the flavor was a
little weak as well.</TE>
<TE>   The meats cooked at low heat were more tender than their cohorts
and moister as well. And, except for the very outer crust, the meat
had better flavor -- it was fuller and meatier. While the exterior
lacked some of the crust of the high-heat roasts, it didn't seem
enough to tip the balance.</TE>
<TE>   The roasts that were cooked first at high heat then at low were
right in the middle. The crusting wasn't as good as the
high-temperature roasts and they weren't as tender as the low.</TE>
<TE>   The differences among cooking methods were particularly profound
with beef. Not only was the high-heat loin not as good; there was
less of it. The high-heat loin weighed 25% less after roasting,
compared with a 15% shrinkage for both low-heat and high-low.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps with fattier cuts, the high-heat equation might have
balanced differently. One thing that was obvious was that there was
hardly any exterior fat on any of the roasts we bought (the beef was
graded Choice, not Prime). This, too, is part of the lean meat
campaign -- an industry spokesman says exterior trim on beef cuts has
shrunk from a solid inch of fat to less than one-eighth of an inch.
This is not enough to develop a crust and it certainly won't render
enough fat to lubricate the hardening protein strands.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to say that high-heat roasting does not work. It is
still the best way to cook unstuffed poultry, where the skin provides
a fatty cover that crisps and crusts well. Birds also have a
thermodynamic advantage in that they are hollow. This provides a
tunnel for the hot oven air to circulate through and means a far
smaller surface-to-volume ratio. Because of this, birds cook fast
enough that at 450 or even 500 degrees overcooking and toughening
aren't a problem.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, if pigs and cows were built more like chickens and
ducks, high-heat roasting might still work. Until they are, low and
slow is the way to go.</TE>

<TE>   Rib roast with tapenade</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 2 1/2 hours</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 8</TE>
<TE>   6 ounces pitted black olives</TE>
<TE>   3 cloves garlic, divided</TE>
<TE>   4 anchovy filets</TE>
<TE>   3 sprigs rosemary, leaves</TE>
<TE>   removed</TE>
<TE>   About 1/4 cup red wine</TE>
<TE>   1 (3 1/2 to 4-pound) standing rib roast</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup fresh bread crumbs</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon minced fresh</TE>
<TE>   rosemary</TE>
<TE>   Olive oil, optional</TE>
<TE>   12 baguette slices, toasted</TE>
<TE>   1. Pulse the olives, 2 cloves of garlic, the anchovies and
rosemary leaves in a food processor. Add just enough red wine to
allow the mixture to form a fairly smooth paste.</TE>
<TE>   2. Score the fatty sides of the rib roast in a diamond pattern,
using a sharp knife to cut through the fat but not into the meat.
Smear the top and both sides of the roast with the olive mixture,
season generously with pepper and let it stand at room temperature 30
to 45 minutes to marinate. Reserve any leftover olive mixture.</TE>
<TE>   3. Heat the oven to 300 degrees. Carefully transfer the rib roast
to a shallow roasting pan, bone-side down. Disturb the olive smear as
little as possible. Roast to an internal temperature of about 115
degrees. This will take about 2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   4. In a food processor, pulse the bread crumbs, remaining clove of
garlic and the 1/2 teaspoon of rosemary until the garlic is minced
fine. Remove the roast from the oven and pat the seasoned bread
crumbs over top. Spoon over some of the fat from the bottom of the
pan and return the roast to the oven. (If there is very little fat,
sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the crumbs.) Continue
roasting to an internal temperature of 125 degrees, about 20 minutes
more.</TE>
<TE>   5. Remove the roast from the oven, cover it loosely with foil and
let it stand an additional 15 minutes before carving. Use the
remaining tapenade to smear on the toasted baguette slices and serve
it alongside the carved roast, dipped in the juices.</TE>

<TE>   Crown roast of pork stuffed with wild rice and dried fruit</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 3 1/2 hours</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 12</TE>
<TE>   1 (8-pound) crown pork roast</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 pound wild rice</TE>
<TE>   10 cups water</TE>
<TE>   2 shallots, minced</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup dried cranberries</TE>
<TE>   1 cup slivered dried pears (about 6 ounces)</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon minced fresh</TE>
<TE>   rosemary</TE>
<TE>   1 cup coarsely chopped</TE>
<TE>   walnuts</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon red wine vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 300 degrees. Season the roast generously with
salt and pepper and place it upside-down in a roasting pan, so it is
supported by the rib bones. Roast 30 minutes, then turn the meat over
and continue cooking to an internal temperature of about 140 degrees,
about 2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   2. While the roast is cooking, combine the wild rice, 1 1/2
teaspoons of salt and the water in a large saucepan and cook
uncovered over medium-high heat until the rice is tender, about 45
minutes. Drain the rice and return to the pan. Add the shallots,
cranberries, pears and rosemary, cover the pan and let stand until
the roast is ready.</TE>
<TE>   3. When the roast is ready, add the walnuts to the wild rice,
season to taste with salt and pepper and stir in the red wine
vinegar. Spoon as much of the rice filling as possible into the
center of the crown roast, spoon some of the fat from the bottom of
the roasting pan over the stuffing, and return the meat to the oven.
(Place the remaining wild rice stuffing in a baking dish alongside
the roast.) Cook the roast to an internal temperature of 145 degrees,
an additional 10 to 15 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   Roast capon with wild mushroom stuffing</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 2 hours</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 6</TE>
<TE>   Note: When you remove this bird from the oven, you may be
dismayed. The skin over the breast will be dark, almost
scorched-looking. Not to worry, that's the mushroom stuffing showing
through. You'll find that the breast meat is incredibly moist and
delicately scented with the flavor of the stuffing.</TE>
<TE>   1/2 ounce dried porcini</TE>
<TE>   mushrooms</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup warm water</TE>
<TE>   1 shallot, peeled</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound white mushrooms</TE>
<TE>   Juice and minced zest</TE>
<TE>   of 1/2 lemon</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons butter</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon minced fresh</TE>
<TE>   rosemary</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup Cognac or other brandy (not fruit-based)</TE>
<TE>   1 (8 to 10-pound) capon or roasting chicken</TE>
<TE>   1. Cover the dried mushrooms with the warm water; set aside to
soften, about 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   2. In a food processor with the motor running, drop the shallot
through the feed tube and chop until finely minced, 10 seconds.
Scrape down the sides of the work bowl, add the white mushrooms and
the lemon zest and pulse to mince them as well. Drain the dried
mushrooms and squeeze dry, reserving the liquid to add to stock or
soup. Add the softened mushrooms to the food processor; pulse to
mince.</TE>
<TE>   3. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When
the butter is sizzling, add the minced mushroom mixture. The
mushrooms will almost instantly absorb all of the butter. Let them
continue to cook, stirring frequently, and after 2 or 3 minutes, they
will begin to release their moisture. Season with 1 teaspoon of salt,
thyme, rosemary and a generous grinding of pepper and continue
cooking until the moisture from the mushrooms has been reabsorbed and
the bottom of the pan is completely dry when you drag a spoon across
it, about 5 minutes. Add the Cognac and lemon juice and cook until
the mushrooms are completely dry again, about 2 minutes. Remove from
the heat and cool. (The recipe can be prepared to this point as much
as a day ahead and refrigerated, tightly sealed.)</TE>
<TE>   4. Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Rinse the chicken inside and out
with cold water and pat dry. Using your fingers, separate the skin
covering the breast from the meat at the main cavity. Work your hand
way underneath the skin until you have completely separated it from
the breast meat up to the wishbone.</TE>
<TE>   5. Carefully spoon the mushroom mixture into the pocket between
the skin and the meat. As you work, press the skin with your hand to
push the mushrooms all the way to the wishbone end of the breast. The
mushrooms should completely cover the breast, forming a layer about
1/2- to 3/4-inch thick.</TE>
<TE>   6. Truss the chicken: Cut a piece of kitchen twine 18 to 24 inches
long. In the center of the twine, form a loop and wrap it around the
knob of one drumstick. Pull the other drumstick tightly alongside,
secure it with another loop and pull it tight. Take the 2 loose ends
of the twine and wrap them snugly around the outside of the chicken
so that they holdthe wing tips to the breast meat. The twine should
not be so tight it cuts into the meat. Tie off the ends and cut any
excess twine.</TE>
<TE>   7. Generously salt and pepper the outside of the chicken and place
it breast-side up on a rack in a low-sided roasting pan. Roast until
a thermometer inserted in the deepest part of the thigh registers 160
degrees, 70 to 80 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven and cover
loosely with foil. Set aside for 10 minutes before carving. Carve as
you would a turkey.</TE>

<LD>Dear SOS: Over the years, on a number of trips to New Orleans, I
always return to Galatoire's for the Crabmeat Yvonne. This has been
on the menu for decades and is beyond delicious. Can you obtain this
recipe?</LD>

<TE>   Dear David: According to the chef, Justin Frey, this is a very
popular dish. It's named after Yvonne Galatoire Wynne. For a quicker
recipe, you might want to use good quality canned artichoke bottoms.
And be sure to use lump crabmeat.</TE>
<TE>   Crabmeat Yvonne</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 6</TE>
<TE>   3 artichokes</TE>
<TE>   1 lemon, cut in half</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) butter</TE>
<TE>   1 pound mushrooms, sliced</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons chopped green onions</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon red wine vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds lump crabmeat</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   6 slices toast, each cut into 4 toast points</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons minced parsley</TE>
<TE>   6 lemon wedges</TE>
<TE>   1. Remove the outer leaves from the artichokes. Cut off the stems
and scoop out the chokes. Rub a lemon half over the cleaned artichoke
bottoms, then place the bottoms in a bowl of cold water with the
juice from the remaining lemon half.</TE>
<TE>   2. Bring a medium pot of water to boil. Add the salt, then the
artichoke bottoms and simmer until fork-tender, about 15 minutes.
Drain and thinly slice.</TE>
<TE>   3. Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium heat until
melted; continue heating until the butter turns golden brown, about
10 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms have
softened and released their moisture, about 10 minutes. Add the
onions and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated from the
skillet, about 5 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and lemon juice. Stir
in the crabmeat and season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in the
sliced artichokes and cook gently until heated through, 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   4. Serve over toast points; garnish the plates with the parsley
and lemon wedges.</TE>

<HD>Make this round for the cook</HD>

<AU>Regina Schrambling</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UP until 1983 I had a problem with alcohol. I thought it was only for
drinking.</LD>
<LD>   Then I got professional help. I went off to school to train as a
chef.</LD>
<LD>   The next few months went by in a high-octane haze as my class
learned to rum-flambe just about anything that would fit into a saute
pan. We also cured salmon with gin, flavored duck with Armagnac,
finished bisques with Pernod and made mayonnaise with Calvados. In
baking, we sweetened pecan pies with Bourbon, moistened genoise with
kirsch and melted pounds of chocolate with Cointreau.</LD>
<TE>   It may be an overstatement to say things always went better with
Cognac, but I did learn there's a reason restaurant sauces taste
headier than what most people make at home: Chefs go straight to the
hard stuff. And it's a lesson that comes in very handy this time of
year.</TE>
<TE>   Not only are the holidays the traditional excuse to pour with
abandon, in that vain effort to juice up fruitcake and plump up plum
pudding. But this is also the season to be excessive, which means the
bottles do add up. You overbuy tequila for parties, guests bring good
Scotch, and to find room for new grappa you have to cull the old from
the liquor cabinet. What better way to get rid of the last half-cup
than in a sauce?</TE>
<TE>   The holiday glut is just a great excuse to experiment, and it's
hard to go wrong with any alcohol in the kitchen. As chefs know,
liquor is a logical alternative not just to wine but also to spices
and sauces as a sophisticated flavoring. All the "normal" liquor
typically used for cooking -- dark brews like rum and Bourbon and
brandy -- is suited to countless dishes. But even some of the less
promising occupants of the top shelf, particularly Scotch and gin,
can actually transform some old standards, whether beef stew or
braised cabbage.</TE>
<TE>   If you like the taste of a particular liquor, the best part of
cooking with it is that you get all the flavor and virtually none of
the proof when you add it to a sauce, or a pie or tart. The heat
burns off almost all of the actual alcohol, leaving only the essence
behind.</TE>
<TE>   Subtle, not socko</TE>
<TE>   When you blend it with complementary flavors, liquor also has the
same effect it does in a well-made cocktail. You know it's there, but
it doesn't sock you in the palate. Half a cup of Bourbon in a glaze
for pecans spiced with cumin and cayenne, for instance, comes through
as a subtle, slightly sweet undertone that makes the nuts mysterious
but still irresistible.</TE>
<TE>   Some liquor has a taste you can almost visualize, which can
inspire other pairings. Scotch to me is smoky and dark, and it brings
out those same traits in wild mushrooms and wild rice. It can be used
just to deglaze the pan that morels have been seared in, or it can be
taken to another level by adding it in the last minutes while a wild
rice-and-mushroom soup is simmering. The effect is haunting but still
perceptible.</TE>
<TE>   Gin is like a juniper tree in a bottle, which makes it a natural
partner for red cabbage, or duck and game, or ingredients that need
an almost piney accent. If you use gin and juniper berries together,
you take the taste to a higher plane.</TE>
<TE>   Bourbon is just a few shades light of molasses and plays well with
pumpkin, in a liberally spiced torte or in a pie. Unlike Scotch, it
can go sweet or savory and is as suited to a sauce for pork as it is
for blending with crushed vanilla wafers to make Bourbon balls that
only get stronger as they age.</TE>
<TE>   And Pernod and ouzo, in all their licorice pungency, bring out an
oceanic intensity in seafood like scallops and lobster.</TE>
<TE>   Think spices too</TE>
<TE>   Most liquors have natural partners in the spice rack as well.
Bourbon likes nutmeg, cinnamon or mace; rum hits high notes with
thyme and allspice or cloves, and tequila has a heat that is only
amplified by dried chilies or fresh jalapenos.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the wet-and-dry combinations I learned in school are still
favorites: Cognac and whole-grain mustard for sauteed chicken or
veal; green peppercorns with any brandy for beef filets; shallots and
Cointreau for pork.</TE>
<TE>   Any of the "fruity" liquors and liqueurs also are naturals for
sweetening whipped cream, of course, but can also be folded into
mascarpone to make a thicker, richer filling for a cake or topping
for warm scones. Pastry cream, which was such a mainstay in cooking
school, soaks up any alcohol and wafts it back into whatever it
accompanies. Even a teetotaler's cake would benefit from close
association. And then there is dark chocolate, which has never met a
liquor it didn't melt right into, from Bourbon and rum to Chambord
and Grand Marnier.</TE>
<TE>   About the only alcohol that seems wasted on the stove is vodka. It
may have had a heyday in pasta sauce, but it really is like the ghost
in the cuisine. To me, there's no there there. Unless, of course,
it's flavored. And then what you taste is not vodka but harsh lemon
or raspberry or orange.</TE>
<TE>   But a cook should think like a careful martini maker and choose
the best liquor possible. Cooking is not like mixing a rum and Coke,
when you can count on the stronger, sweeter component to hide the
roughness of the liquor. The levels of flavor start with the alcohol,
and what is known as sipping alcohol is the best. Old Grand-Dad might
be fine for a mint julep, for instance, but something like Maker's
Mark or Woodford Reserve is more nuanced for cooking.</TE>
<TE>   If that seems extravagant, just remember that less is more with
alcohol. Just a few tablespoons can flavor a whole pie, or a side
dish for six, or a sauce for a whole turkey. You might need a cupful
for a dry old fruitcake, but waving the bottle over a tart is almost
enough.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chocolate framboise tart</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 25 minutes, plus 1 1/2 hours chilling</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 10 to 12</TE>
<TE>   Note: This is adapted from a Joel Robuchon concept. For a more
gentle taste, use a raspberry liqueur, such as Chambord, instead of
the framboise; if so, use 1/3 cup liqueur and 3/4 cup whipping cream.</TE>
<TE>   Pastry</TE>
<TE>   11 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</TE>
<TE>   1/3cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 egg yolk</TE>
<TE>   1 egg</TE>
<TE>   2 cups cake flour</TE>
<TE>   1. Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the yolk
and egg, mixing to incorporate. Add the flour slowly and blend. Form
the dough into a flat disk, wrap in plastic and chill 1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   2. On a lightly floured board, roll out the dough to 1/4 inch
thick. Drape over the rolling pin and fit into a 9-inch tart pan with
removable bottom. Press the dough tightly into the corners and edges.
Pinch off the top edge to be flush with the pan. Set in the freezer
30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   3. Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Line the shell with foil then
fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake in the lower third of the
oven until pale golden, 15 minutes. Remove weights or beans and bake
another 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   7 ounces top-quality bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup framboise</TE>
<TE>   1 egg, lightly beaten</TE>
<TE>   Whipped cream, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   2. Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-low
heat. Remove from the heat and stir in the chocolate, stirring until
the mixture is completely melted. Let cool slightly, then stir in the
framboise and mix until well blended. Stir in the egg and mix again
until well-blended.</TE>
<TE>   3. Pour the chocolate mixture into the prebaked tart shell. Bake
the tart just until the edges are set and the center is still
trembling, 12 to 15 minutes; do not overbake. Transfer to a rack to
cool slightly.</TE>
<TE>   4. To serve, cut the tart into thin wedges and serve with plain
whipped cream.</TE>

<HD>A hot time for tamales</HD>

<AU>Barbara Hansen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It may seem that any day is a good day for tamales. But it's on
Christmas Eve that this Latino specialty shines as brightly as an
ornament. That's when they are the traditional dish, and lucky for us
in Los Angeles, it's possible to find an extraordinary assortment,
from all over the map: banana-leaf- wrapped tamales, tamales made of
ground fresh corn, jumbo tamales, tiny tamales. Just don't wait until
Christmas Eve to buy them: they sell out. And don't microwave. The
texture is fresher and lighter if they are steamed.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Nine more for Christmas</LD>
<TE>   This family-run Yucatecan restaurant makes nine Christmas tamales
in addition to its regular menu of 30. Christmas fillings include
fresh huitlacoche, squash flowers and roasted pasilla chile, each
combined with Jack cheese. The classic Yucatecan banana-leaf tamales
are filled with chicken, beef or pork seasoned with achiote. Dessert
tamales include one with chocolate masa and strawberries.</TE>
<TE>   Christmas tamales are $15 to $47 a dozen at Chichen Itza in the
Mercado La Paloma, 3655 S. Grand Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 741-1075.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Salvadoran style</TE>
<TE>   This bakery and deli specializes in Salvadoran tamales. Some are
on hand for takeout, but you'll need to call in advance for large
orders. Choices include banana-leaf tamales filled with chicken and
potato or black beans, and tamales de elote (fresh corn tamales) made
without filling.</TE>
<TE>   Tamales are $1.15 each at Panaderia Sabor Latino, 2716 W. Pico
Blvd., Los Angeles. (323) 734-1535.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With that Oaxacan touch</TE>
<TE>   This small, well-stocked Oaxacan deli makes delicious black mole
tamales: flat rectangles of silky masa filled with chicken in a
complex sauce that is slightly sweet and spicy, and tamales filled
with mole amarillo (yellow mole) and black beans.</TE>
<TE>   Black mole tamales are $1.75 each at Tortilleria y Antojitos
Expresion Oaxaquena, 3301 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles (323) 766-0721.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Guatemalan assortment</TE>
<TE>   This Guatemalan restaurant makes five tamales: Tamalito de elote,
slightly sweet and wrapped in a corn husk; tamalito de chipilin,
riddled with the leaves of the chipilin plant; the pache quetzalteco,
made with potatoes, chicken and hot green chile; chuchito, with pork
and a strip of mild red pepper in fine, soft masa; and tamal
colorado, with chicken or pork.</TE>
<TE>   Tamalitos de chipilin, elote and chuchito are $1.95 each; tamal
colorado and pache quetzalteco are $3.50 at the restaurant, $2
takeout, at Las Delicias Chapinas, 3731 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles.
(323) 731-6995.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Crossing the borders</TE>
<TE>   Central American and Mexican tamales are available at this cheery
storefront restaurant across from MacArthur Park. The terrific
assortment varies; Salvadoran, Guatemalan and Colombian tamales have
been on recent menus, along with tamales from regions of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Tamales are $1.75 each, or $1.50 for orders of two or more, at
Mama's Hot Tamales Cafe, 2124 W. 7th Street, Los Angeles. (213)
487-7474.</TE>

<HD>Celebrating the oyster</HD>
<DH>This is its big moment. And it cries out for a crisp white.
Take your pick from France, California and Austria.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rod Smith</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SINCE the beginning of time -- or at least since the invention of the
oyster knife -- living, briny oysters have powerfully attracted the
sensual predators among us. And in recent years, that attraction
seems to have grown stronger, especially in the cooler months, with
oysters offered in just about every other restaurant. Here, on the
West Coast -- from Point Reyes to British Columbia -- the oyster beds
produce some of the best eating in the world.</LD>
<LD>   Which raises the question of which wine to drink with them.</LD>
<LD>   Whites are the easy answer, of course. It's hard to go wrong with
a crisp yet full-bodied California Sauvignon Blanc such as Clos du
Bois "Sonoma County" (2001, about $9) or Napa Wine Co. "Napa Valley"
(2001, about $18).</LD>
<TE>   But you have to be careful. Most other seafood can also pair well
with a luscious Chardonnay. Not the briny little oyster. Even the
most intensely oceanic oyster is overpowered by rich fruit and oak.</TE>
<TE>   Oysters are at their best with the crispest, most minerally
whites. A Pouilly-Fuisse, for example. The weathered clays and
gravels in the villages surrounding the mighty limestone monolith
called Solutre, in southern Burgundy, yield brilliantly crisp
Chardonnay with delicate flinty overtones and piercing minerality.
Among my scenarios of heaven would be a frosty bottle of '00 Vincent
Chateau de Fuisse (about $20) and a platter of Hog Island Sweetwater
oysters from Tomales Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Sancerre is another good match. The purity of Sauvignon Blanc
grown on the chalky slopes of the upper Loire Valley makes a striking
foil for sea tang. The '01 Hippolyte Reverdy (about $17) has a
thrilling high-toned Sauvignon flavor with knife-edge acidity. The
'01 Vacheron (about $15) is a little rounder, with a kiss of white
peach in the finish. Both meet the oyster on the common ground of
intense minerality.</TE>
<TE>   Another classic French oyster wine is Muscadet, from the sandy
terrain where the Loire meets the Atlantic Ocean. Unfortunately, the
old saw that Muscadets don't travel well is true. They lose fruit and
zing in transit. But a similar seaboard wine from Portugal, Vino
Verde, travels like a vinous Vasco da Gama. The best are made from
Alvarinho (the same grape as Spain's Albarino), which is quietly
upping its reputation as one of the world's great white varieties.
Quinta da Pedra tastes like its name -- "vineyard of stone" -- with a
honey-like overlay that complements oysters perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   Austria's new-generation Gruner Veltliners, with their
spine-tingling acidity and Alpine spring fruit, are so perfectly
suited to oysters it's hard to believe they come from a landlocked
country. To choose just one example, the brisk citrus-inflected
perfume and stony flavor of the '00 Weingartner Terrasson Thal
"Wachau, Austria" (about $11) is a magic combination with oysters.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is sparkling wine -- the classic matchup. My
Californian choice is the bold, elegant Roederer Estate Brut
"Anderson Valley" (about $18). For a sleek, almost ethereal French
connection, try Taittinger Brut (about $30).</TE>

what a testament to the aristocratic Tuscan grape. Deep red and

lay away for a few years. Some stores still have the '98 vintage but

<HD>The gift rule: Six for me, one for you</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mimi Avins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Life used to be so simple. There were the holiday shopping season and
the end of the year sales, which had the good taste to wait until
after Christmas to begin. Then, clever merchants had the notion to
start offering marked-down merchandise when customers were most
likely to be in the stores. The boundaries blurred, and the road to
gift-giving became a minefield of temptation.</LD>
<LD>   This is not the case for single-minded altruists intent on finding
treasures for their loved ones. But for those of us whose hearts beat
faster in the presence of a great deal, who believe that the best of
Dolce &amp; Gabbana belongs in our closet -- but not at full price -- the
conflict is obvious. Are we sullying the season if we shop for
ourselves and others at the same time?</LD>
<LD>   In a word: No.</LD>
<TE>   Experienced shoppers know the importance of a positive attitude.
The first step toward combining successful bargain-hunting with the
hunt for gifts is to make peace with your inner selfishness.
According to a recent survey by American Express, three out of every
four adults admit to purchasing presents for themselves when shopping
for friends and family. And anything 76% of the public does
automatically moves from the naughty category into the realm of a
societal norm.</TE>
<TE>   A week before Christmas Eve, Patti Berman, who rules the Chanel
accessories department at Saks Fifth Avenue, says, "Shoppers come in
looking for a handbag or a piece of jewelry for a gift and they bump
into something else and say, 'Oh my God. I love this. I wasn't
looking for it, but I have to have it.' That happened several times
yesterday, and the day before. Sometimes, they'll find the gift they
came in searching for, but more often than not they'll walk out with
just something for themselves. And although they sometimes say, 'I
shouldn't be doing this, but ... ,' they don't return it."</TE>
<TE>   Guilt profits neither you nor the economy. Don't you just hate
reading those gloomy reports of disappointing sales figures in
America's stores? Of course you do. Unless your pregnant cousin's
baby turns out to be triplets, there are only so many presents you
can buy your friends and family without spoiling them. But being your
own Santa has infinite variations, and other purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, it's a stress reliever. One of the things that
makes holiday shopping so difficult is agonizing over whether a
gift's recipient will be delighted by your choice. When you buy for
yourself, you know instantly that your purchase is a hit. Finding
fabulous red ankle-straps in your size at 50% off is calming, and it
buttresses your confidence. Of course your father will like the
sweater you've just dropped in your shopping bag. Anyone with an eye
for superlatively sexy shoes can surely pick out a heck of a Perry
Como cardigan.</TE>
<TE>   It helps if those on your list understand you well enough to know
what type of stores you most enjoy cruising. There are people who
hope to receive toys, electronic gadgets, luggage or housewares tied
up with a bow. Housewares! They are anathema to those of us who
consider clothes our drug of choice. The only good thing that can be
said about the housewares department at Bloomingdale's in Century
City is that it's on the same floor as the lingerie.</TE>
<TE>   Dee Lattimore works at the Kiehl's flagship store in Santa Monica,
and she is used to shoppers who choose scented candles, body lotions
and bath gels as gifts while stocking up for themselves as well.
"December is a very expensive month for me," she says. "I only buy
gifts that I would like to receive, so I wind up shopping in stores
full of stuff that I want to buy."</TE>
<TE>   It is possible that not everyone approves of this most efficient
gift-acquiring system. A salesman at the Tommy Hilfiger store at
Beverly Center helps a woman find workout pants in two colors.
(They're not on sale, but they're a steal, even at full price, and
here's the beauty part of this time of year: If she weren't in the
mall looking for gifts, she never would have encountered them.) While
contemplating whether to purchase both the red and the black, she
says, "Well, I don't really know if I need two, but they're so well
cut." He sees her try the pants on, so he must know they're for her.
Yet he slides a gift box into her shopping bag. Is this a silent
reprimand? Does he think "two for me, none for you" is not in the
holiday spirit?</TE>
<TE>   Well, bah humbug to him too.</TE>

<HD>BET's man of the hour, but only briefly</HD>
<DH>Ed Gordon, savoring acclaim for his Trent Lott interview,
hopes to get his canceled news show back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Braxton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a newsman whose show just got canceled, Black Entertainment
Television's Ed Gordon was a pretty popular guy Tuesday morning.</LD>
<LD>   His exclusive interview Monday night with beleaguered Sen. Trent
Lott (R-Miss.) turned him into Tuesday's media man of the hour. "It's
been a busy morning, and I'm operating on only two hours sleep,"
Gordon said after appearances on CBS' "The Early Show," ABC's "Good
Morning America," Don Imus' syndicated radio show and MSNBC.</LD>
<LD>   While professing discomfort at being in the spotlight, he clearly
was savoring a moment of professional acclaim. "This is the reason
why journalists do what they do," he said. "At some point, all eyes
are trained on you, like an athlete in the big game. And you want the
ball. You want to be prepared and professional, because this is a
real opportunity to shine."</LD>
<TE>   His special, "Conversation With Ed Gordon," was seen by 830,000
viewers, about double the network's audience during the 8 p.m. time
slot.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon said he'd been receiving congratulatory calls from
colleagues, news analysts and Washington insiders for his subtle but
probing questioning of Lott, who is under fire for remarks he made at
fellow GOP Sen. Strom Thurmond's 100th birthday party, which were
seen by many as racially divisive.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon insistently pressed Lott not only on his remarks but on his
voting record, which has been blasted by civil rights groups. Some
political observers said the interview was damaging to Lott, and
could accelerate his political downfall.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the impact on Lott, for Gordon the timing couldn't be
better. He has had an uneasy relationship with BET since the cable
channel canceled his nightly news series "BET Tonight With Ed Gordon"
earlier this month to focus more on entertainment programming. "I
don't know what my future is here," he said. "We're in continuous
talks." In addition to canceling "BET Tonight With Ed Gordon," the
cable network also axed its regular news show, "Lead Story." BET
executives said the cancellations will make room for new programming
that would include more news specials and documentaries.</TE>
<TE>   BET spokesman Michael Lewellen said Gordon's interview with Lott
was the kind of programming BET was interested in pursuing, rather
than nightly news shows. "Instead of locking ourselves with the
analytical side of news, we want to centralize and concentrate on
news specials such as this."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Gordon said he hopes BET reverses the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, there is tremendous irony with the timing of this
interview," Gordon said. "I can only hope that this situation is much
like it was earlier this year with ABC when there were whispers that
they were considering canceling 'Nightline.' I hope BET sees the
error of their ways and brings this show back."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon got the call to do the interview after Lott talked with BET
founder Robert Johnson about the controversy. "I don't know what was
discussed there," Gordon said. "I don't involve myself in those
dealings. What I did do after that was contact Sen. Lott's
representatives and make sure they knew there were going to be high
journalistic standards about this, that we wouldn't pull any
punches."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon researched the controversy and Lott's record over the
weekend: "I just sequestered myself, read as much about him as I
could. I also called a couple of people who I trust to bounce some
things off them, and gauge some questions."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon, 42, also was responsible for an earlier scoop at the cable
network: In January 1996, he landed an exclusive interview with O.J.
Simpson just a few months after the former football star was
acquitted in the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson and her
friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman.</TE>
<TE>   Like his interview with Lott, a Simpson interview was the most
sought after "get" for major media outlets, and some news executives
expressed outrage that Simpson bypassed more prominent exposure to
appear on BET, which was more known for airing of music videos.</TE>
<TE>   That interview also raised Gordon's profile. He left BET soon
afterward for a three-year stint at NBC and MSNBC. Although he did
some noteworthy interviews, he was not a high-profile presence there,
according to insiders. The Detroit native returned to BET in 2000
when the network revised its news programming.</TE>
<TE>   Contrasting the two interviews, Gordon said, "There's some deja vu
here, but Simpson was so surreal, and had such huge magnitude on so
many levels," he said. "Our nation was absolutely riveted on him. It
was a national soap opera. The Lott interview is big mostly on a
political level."</TE>

<LD>When the final chapter closes on Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R.
Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings," the whole extravaganza -- three
features, nine hours and a catalog of characters as seemingly
infinite as the films' crew -- may well be heralded as one of the
more heroic ventures in commercial cinema. Launched last December to
enormous success with "The Fellowship of the Ring," the ongoing epic
has now entered an awkward adolescence with its middle feature, "The
Two Towers," on its way to its concluding volume, "The Return of the
King." Slated for completion next year, the entirety of the "Rings"
looks auspicious even if in its present manifestation this once and
future landmark is a bit of a yawn.</LD>
<TE>   Based on the second volume of Tolkien's novel, "The Two Towers"
begins fairly soon after "The Fellowship of the Ring" leaves off with
the hobbits, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Samwise (Sean Astin), warily
traveling toward the Dark Tower of Mordor, the lair of Sauron the
Great. Conquered in an ancient war, Sauron has been gathering his
forces with the intention of obliterating the world of men,
Middle-earth, for which he needs the ring. In the first film, Frodo
had become the ring's reluctant keeper, charged with its destruction
by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), a mission that transported him
out of the idyll of his homeland, the Shire, and into a fellowship
with eight other Middle-earth inhabitants. Splintered at the close of
the first volume, the fellowship has now scattered to fight its
enemies separately.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lord of the Rings," built on a bedrock of mythic archetypes
and sagas such as "Beowulf," is essentially a quest story but one in
which the seeker aims to renounce power, rather than to seize it.
That makes Frodo uncharacteristically humble for a hero and an
unusually appealing seeker no matter what the troubled times, and it
also speaks to why the book was a cult favorite during the 1960s.
(The hobbits' fondness for smoking an herb called pipe-weed likely
appealed to the book's original counterculture fan base, as well.)
Although Frodo hails from the pastoral Shire and is by nature and
inclination gentle, each step of his journey brings him closer to
cataclysmic warfare that rumbles during the first volume, erupts in
the second and rages throughout the third.</TE>
<TE>   Tolkien began writing "The Lord of the Rings" in 1936 and for
years after its publication insisted that it had nothing to do with
the Second World War. Jackson has no such qualms but his inspiration
is cinematic not political. In "The Two Towers," he cribs an iconic
image of massed troops from Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda reverie,
"Triumph of the Will," but the allusion loses its punch when you
realize that another shot of goose-stepping troops has been lifted
from "The Wizard of Oz." Tolkien built his story on foundation myths;
Jackson builds his on movies: The film's most charming new creature,
a mossy shepherd named Treebeard, walks like the heron described by
Tolkien but looks like a relation of the animated trees in "Oz." When
Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis, with goggling computer-generated eyes
and slithering silvery body) returns to the scene to pull the word
"master" from its mouth, it's with the same sinister fawning as
Dracula's helper Renfield.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these cinephile fillips, Jackson and fellow screenwriters
Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Stephen Sinclair have enough to do
just keeping Tolkien's histories and characters in play. To that end,
the new film faithfully opens with the human warrior Aragorn (Viggo
Mortensen), a huntsman with his own impending quest issues, in the
company of the Elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and the Dwarf Gimli (John
Rhys-Davies). Together, the three are hotfooting across green slopes
in search of two other fellowship members, the hobbits Merry (Dominic
Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who have been kidnapped by Orcs,
servants of Sauron's strongest ally, the wizard Saruman (Christopher
Lee).</TE>
<TE>   Tolkien devotes the first half of "The Two Towers" to Aragorn's
exploits and the second to those of Frodo; Jackson instead oscillates
between the questing travelers before getting swept up in a battle
that nearly proves the undoing of Aragorn and the film. While
searching for the hobbits, Aragorn and his companions enter the human
kingdom of Rohan, where they're soon engaged in protecting its people
from Sauron's army. Jackson spends an interminable amount of time in
Rohan, lavishing his attention on a battle that consumes less than a
chapter in the novel. Set at night, the fight unfolds with hordes of
the enemy ("thick as marching ants," in Tolkien's words) descending
in waves. Despite Mortensen's energetic vaults across the set, the
tension slackens precipitously. It isn't only that there's no fun to
be had watching ants get squashed; it's that the battle, designed for
the video-game generation, proceeds in frustrating starts and stops,
as if Jackson couldn't get past the first level.</TE>
<TE>   With "The Fellowship of the Ring," Jackson delivered us into
never-before-seen worlds. The fellowship covers new ground in "The
Two Towers" but the story bogs down in Rohan, a dreary stopover that
fails to capture the imagination; unlike the Shire or Elvish lands,
it doesn't look that different from the back-lot Middle Ages we've
seen elsewhere. During the past few decades, computer technologies
have enhanced (and waylaid) numerous films but it wasn't until
Jackson's first try at Tolkien that we saw the greater possibilities
of those technologies, particularly in the realm of fantasy, where
now everything seems possible. After years of anemic space escapades
in which the blue screen was invariably more important than the
flesh-and-blood actors, digital video technologies were put in the
service of a juicy story and not the reverse.</TE>
<TE>   That more or less holds true in "The Two Towers" even if for
stretches at a time the tools at Jackson's disposal distract him from
what he does best, which is push the story forward with the
enthusiasm of a filmmaker who hasn't put ego before movie love. The
director's great strength is the confidence with which he translates
Tolkien's vision into visual imagery even if he still gets tripped up
converting that vision into dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fellowship of the Ring" was periodically hampered by the
writers' attempts to cut swaths through the narration. There's as
much exposition in "The Two Towers" but because Jackson and his
screenwriter partners don't want to repeat themselves, they lay out
the story even less clearly than they did on their first outing. When
Aragorn consults with Gandalf, it's easy to get lost in a thicket of
names and allegiances.</TE>
<TE>   It was during one such eyelid-drooping moment while watching "The
Two Towers" that I flashed on an old Gary Larson cartoon that pokes
gentle fun at the nomenclature found in books of this sort by
contrasting the names we give dogs with those they give themselves.
"I am known as Vexog," says one dog (a.k.a. Rex), "Destroyer of Cats
and Devourer of Chickens." "I am Zornorph," says another, proudly,
"the One Who Comes by Night to the Neighbor's Yard, and this is
Princess Sheewana, Barker of Great Annoyance and Daughter of Queen
La, Stainer of Persian Rugs."</TE>
<TE>   The absurdity of the dog names was a relief, giving me a momentary
reprieve from the film and its insistent monumentality. At that
instant, I stopped bumming about the second film and began looking
forward to the third. Such is the nature of geek love. As with "The
Fellowship of the Ring," the excitement and pleasure of "The Two
Towers" comes from the feeling that we're doing more than simply
watching a film but have, rather, embarked on an epic journey with
like-minded travelers. If the second film never reaches the highs of
the first -- we have met the players before and there are no new
worlds of wonder -- it nonetheless invests moviegoing with a sense of
adventure. Like Frodo and Aragorn, we have to cover a lot of middling
expository ground in "The Two Towers" -- here, we're just passing
through on our way to the end.</TE>

<HD>She's rehabbing her reputation</HD>
<DH>Paula Poundstone, her kids back at home, is cautiously
trying to resurrect her comedic career.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bettijane Levine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It isn't easy to cozy up to Paula Poundstone. She is not warm,
ingratiating, glib or self-revealing. She has mastered none of the
faux bonding techniques so many celebrities use with interviewers to
make themselves seem worthy of prime time.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, at 10 a.m., she is barely awake and highly nonverbal as
she ushers an invited guest into her home in a manner that suggests
she had little part in issuing the invitation.</LD>
<LD>   Balloons float from the white picket fence and signs drawn by the
three Poundstone children -- ages 4, 8 and 11 -- still decorate the
front door and living room. They read, "Poundstones Together Forever"
-- the theme of a party the night before to celebrate the family's
reunification.</LD>
<TE>   On Dec. 11, after her children had spent 18 months in foster care,
Poundstone regained custody. They were removed from her home after
she pleaded no contest to a felony count of child endangerment and
misdemeanor infliction of injury on a child. The endangerment charge
involved drunk driving with children in the car.</TE>
<TE>   Now her lawyer and manager are on a campaign to put the comedian
back in circulation, to get her face in every magazine, newspaper and
TV show possible -- including People magazine, "Larry King Live," and
now The Times -- in an attempt to refurbish what they consider an
unfairly tarnished image.</TE>
<TE>   Her career is picking up slowly. The bookings are trickling in --
her next is at the Grove of Anaheim on Dec. 27 -- but the campaign is
geared toward picking up the pace.</TE>
<TE>   Poundstone -- yawning, uncombed and with a hacking cough --
obviously isn't thrilled with this new public relations putsch. But
if it will help her family's life get back onto an even financial
keel, she'll put up with it. Within limits.</TE>
<TE>   Poundstone says she has "apologized endlessly to my kids. I have
explained that I made a really bad mistake, that I owned up to it and
had to be punished. I tried to explain it as a sort of lesson, so
they know that when you do something wrong, you should confess and
take the punishment and never do it again."</TE>
<TE>   She says she has not touched alcohol since her arrest and never
would again "because of the terrible toll it inflicted."</TE>
<TE>   A charge of lewd conduct was dropped soon after it was brought
against the comedian, says her attorney, Richard Pfeiffer. A court
gag order prevents them from discussing why the charge was ever made,
and why it was never pressed. Poundstone says: "I can only tell you
that if they could have nailed me, they certainly would have. I
pleaded guilty only to what was true -- which was my alcohol
problem."</TE>
<TE>   On this morning, it seems evident that the children are all
Poundstone cares to discuss -- although only in ways she believes
will not invade their dignity or privacy. This attitude has been
irritating to both her longtime manager, Bonnie Burns, and Pfeiffer,
who asked The Times to meet with the comedian, hoping to reestablish
her image as a caring and responsible -- they might call her
extraordinary -- mother.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney has asked to sit in on the interview, not because
he's afraid Poundstone might say too much, but because he's afraid
she won't say enough. He explains: "In the Larry King interview last
week, King started to ask questions about her children's disabilities
and she stopped him. She said her children are wonderful people, they
aren't defined by disabilities and they weren't castaways that she
rescued.</TE>
<TE>   "But if you meet those children, see what Paula has done with and
for them, see the love in that family -- you will get a totally
different picture than was implied when the charges were brought. She
never got the huge publicity when the [lewd conduct] charges were so
quickly dropped."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas, the 4-year-old, awakens in a back bedroom, runs into the
living room, climbs on Poundstone's lap and remains there to help
with the interview. He is highly verbal about the family's nine cats,
one dog and the constipated lizard who gets a 20-minute massage from
his mommy every day. Not to mention his depth of knowledge on how
firemen dress to fight fires and why Christmas trees need water.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas "is great in school, has lots of friends and he's an
excellent child, aren't you?" Poundstone says, rocking him gently. He
became her foster child when he was 2 days old, and they have been
together ever since. She adopted him when he was 2. The attorney
whispers that he had certain "health problems" the reporter should
know about. Poundstone refuses to continue such a discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Toshia, Poundstone's 11-year-old daughter, has joined the party.
How are you? the visitor asks. "I'm happy," she answers in a soft
voice. What do you want for Christmas? "Whatever I want, my mama will
get me," she replies sweetly. She walks toward her mother, and drops
unsteadily into a chair beside her. "She's just stopped using her
crutches," Poundstone says.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney is aching to explain. When Paula and Toshia leave for
the kitchen, he whispers: "She has cerebral palsy. Paula takes her to
therapy a few times a week, and does exercises with her every night
-- and now she's walking without crutches."</TE>
<TE>   Poundstone, asked later about this and other health issues the
lawyer has mentioned, becomes upset that her daughter may be
misrepresented as "damaged." All three of her children go to the same
Santa Monica public school. Toshia has been mainstreamed. She has
friends. She feels comfortable. "The story is about me and my
problems, not about them," Poundstone says.</TE>
<TE>   Poundstone explains that she's known Toshia since she was 10
months old and became her foster mother when the child was 4. "When I
told her I was going to adopt her, I said, 'I want you to take my
last name so we sound like the family we really are.' But I didn't
want her to lose the middle name she already had, which is Marie. Or
the last name, because that is part of who she is. So I told her we'd
push those names into the middle. And I said since we are going to
see a judge to do this right, you can also choose one more middle
name if you want to. So her full legal name is Toshia Marie
Alice-In-Wonderland Johnson Poundstone." Poundstone's middle child,
Allie, is in bed with the flu.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of her arrest, Poundstone was caring for two foster
children along with her own three. (The foster children were placed
in other homes.) She has fostered eight children through the years,
she says, including the three she has adopted. When asked why she
began fostering children, Poundstone says, "I wanted to do something
important."</TE>
<TE>   How could she juggle a career and such a large family? "I had two
nannies -- it was critical that the children have consistent care,
get to school and gymnastics and all their other appointments when I
was away performing -- which I tried to keep to a minimum."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, at the time her mothering began, Poundstone's career
was on a high note, her financial picture was solid, she owned a
lovely Santa Monica home. She could afford the lessons, the
therapies, the tutors, the nannies. Since her legal problems began,
she says she has gone into "humungous debt." She sold her home to pay
for the army of lawyers and assorted other costs related to the cases
in criminal and family courts.</TE>
<TE>   Her attorney, again perhaps too vocal for Poundstone's liking,
explains her situation. "She has nothing left. She rented this house,
which is expensive, because she wanted to keep the children in the
same school." The house is quite small, reportedly leaks when it
rains and bears no resemblance to the "very nice place" she sold.</TE>
<TE>   "She has had all those lawyers to pay," Pfeiffer continues. But
that was only a part of it, he says. After six months in rehab, she
was allowed unlimited monitored visitations with the children, who
had been placed in foster care. The monitors were to be hired at
Poundstone's expense.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't just hire monitors for a few hours a day to be with
them. She was there when they opened their eyes in the morning."
Poundstone chimes in: "That's true. I took them to school and picked
them up, drove them to appointments, spent the day with them,
scrubbed and tubbed them here at home, then took them a few blocks to
the foster home and stayed with them till they fell asleep."</TE>
<TE>   Poundstone agrees that the astronomical costs of hiring monitors
for a year of 18-hour days, along with lawyers' fees, and the loss of
work have set her in dire financial circumstances. "Oh, and don't
forget the $250 per hour psychotherapists ordered by the court -- 12
therapists in 18 months," Poundstone says.</TE>
<TE>   But in her abrupt way, Poundstone says she is not in any real
sense complaining. She allows as how she understands that she "had to
pay for the really bad thing I did, which was to drink and endanger
my children by doing so." She sounds relieved to have met and coped
with that problem and to have it behind her. Now, she hopes, her
future will be clear. The question is, will she be able to
rehabilitate her reputation, will she get enough gigs to keep her
kids supplied with what they need, and maybe a few extras. She has
just lost her children's health insurance, she says, because she
isn't earning enough to qualify for AFTRA union benefits.</TE>
<TE>   So far, she says, "the bookings aren't coming as fast as I need
them to. And it's difficult to promote them. You gotta do these radio
interviews, where you call the morning DJ, tell a few jokes and tease
your upcoming show. But now, those DJs have all turned into Mike
Wallace." Every time she wants to promote a performance, she says,
she has to "address all this business all over again. It's one step
forward, two steps back."</TE>
<TE>   Some critics have written that her current shows are funnier than
ever. But the clubs are not packed when she plays. What happens if
she never gets back to peak performance? She can't concern herself
with negative thoughts, she says. In fact, she's surrounded by
goodwill. "What's interesting is total strangers come up to me
frequently and say the most supportive things. One woman got out of
her car and asked if she could give me a hug."</TE>

<HD>New 'Inferno' translation weds Irish, Italian souls</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is a mark of our culture's self-imposed poverty that, these days,
the classics are seldom taught and hardly read.</LD>
<LD>   Every now and again, a superstar translator manages to break
through to the bestseller lists, as Seamus Heaney did two years ago
with his stunning "Beowulf" or as the late Ted Hughes once did in
Britain with his wonderful Ovid.</LD>
<LD>   If there were justice in our taste and buying habits, their books
would soon be joined by the Irish poet and novelist Ciaran Carson's
new translation of Dante Alighieri's "The Inferno." Recently
published in Britain and Ireland, it is forthcoming here next month
from Granta Books. Rendered in what one British critic called "a
vivid Hiberno-English idiom," this is a Dante not for the shelf but
for the eye and voice -- addictively readable, virtually demanding to
be recited aloud.</LD>
<TE>   As Carson's colleague and countryman Paul Muldoon puts it, this is
"quite simply the best version of Dante there is, the only one with a
more than passable stab at terza rima" -- the rhyme scheme of the
original.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the odds are long against even so compelling a rendering
finding the audience it deserves. That's a melancholy fact, because
the last half-century has been a golden age of poetic translation, an
era in which the common currency of English has made possible the
globalization of ancient and modern literature.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the examples that come most immediately to mind are
Richard Lattimore's translations from the Greek; Kenneth Rexroth's
renderings from the Japanese and Chinese; W.S. Merwin and Clarence
Brown's translations of the Russian Osip Mandelstam; the
collaborations of Robert Hass, Robert Pinsky and Lillian Vallee with
the Polish writer Czeslaw Milosz; Stanley Kunitz and Max Hayward's
unmatched Anna Akhmatova; and Thomas Kinsella's translations from the
Irish, particularly "The Cattle Raid of Cooley," a European epic
older than "Beowulf."</TE>
<TE>   This is by no means an exhaustive list, but what these examples
have in common is the way in which the sensibility and poetic
inclinations of the translator fall uniquely in sync with that of
their subject.</TE>
<TE>   Unlikely as it seems, that is precisely what has occurred between
the 54-year-old Belfast-born Carson and the wandering Florentine, who
turned his painful and resentful exile into a "Divine Comedy" in
three books, "Inferno," "Purgatorio" and "Paradiso."</TE>
<TE>   As the author of eight books of poetry and five works of prose,
including the widely praised novel "Shamrock Tea," Carson came late
to Dante. He translated his first Canto, XXXI, just two years go, and
as he began work on the other 33 he was aware he was entering a
crowded field. In recent years, there has been a surprising number of
first-rate Dante translations, including the free-verse version of
Robert and Jean Hollander, Allen Mandelbaum's scholarly rendering and
an elegant translation by Pinsky, the former U.S. poet laureate.</TE>
<TE>   Each, to Carson's mind, had something lacking. "I read through
bags of them," he said Tuesday. "I found most of it earnest but very
dull. You hope for a spark, but they're rare. My own Italian was not
fantastic starting off, but I got the feeling of the original and it
was sparky -- half obscene in places and angry all over. It flowed.
It sang to me, and I wanted that sense of urgency to be there in the
English.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted something that could be read in one go. That's the way
it really works."</TE>
<TE>   Carson said he also drew on his experience as an Irish Catholic
born and living in Belfast, a city whose sectarian divisions mirror
in many ways the strife between Guelph and Ghibelline and ultimately
forced Dante into exile from medieval Florence. "As I worked," he
said, "I had in my mind's eye North Belfast, where I live near the
old waterworks. I'd see the city's no-go zones and tattered flags,
the blackened side-streets, cul-de-sacs and bits of wasteland
stitched together by dividing walls, like Florence.</TE>
<TE>   "I live here in my native city as an exile in a sense. When you
don't share the state's ideology -- as I don't and Dante didn't --
you're in exile and language is your path back."</TE>
<TE>   Irish was Carson's first language and that, too, he said, informs
his translation, as it has -- he points out -- Heaney's work. "We
don't consider English finally as our own language. When we write in
English, it's always with an edge that makes a place for Irishness, a
sense that there's another way into the thing, no single manner of
speech."</TE>
<TE>   When it came to Dante, Carson said, it was that distance that
allowed him to appreciate the "learned allusions and the earthy
vigor. I approached him with respect but not awe. Here's a man, I
thought, going through things not unlike what goes on here in
Ireland, who did his job as a poet really well. It's good stuff and
it's alive for us now."</TE>
<TE>   An authority on Irish music, Carson also found himself in thrall
to Dante's melodious Italian, which is why he resolved that the
Hiberno-English ballad would be the model for his verse translation.
"There are songs in both the English and Irish language that move
between formal art and the street, as Dante's Italian does," he
explained.</TE>
<TE>   "At the back of my mind in every line I wrote in this work, I
could hear a song. It was there for me like a long, ongoing ballad, a
song full of yearning and despair and, at the end, hope."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While Kunitz was at work on his great Akhmatova translations, the
Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky -- who, as a very young man, had
known Boris Pasternak -- told his American colleague this story:</TE>
<TE>   Pasternak was once rebuked by a pedant, who came to his door
bearing a long list of the poet's mistakes in translating Hamlet. The
complaint was greeted with laughter and a shrug: "What difference
does it make? Shakespeare and I -- we're both geniuses, aren't we?"</TE>
<TE>   To this day, Pasternak's Hamlet is regarded as one of the jewels
of Russian literature.</TE>
<TE>   Genius is what so many of this era's great translations have in
common, though the best also have, as Carson puts it, "a little luck
and a lot of cheek." And thus these lines of his "Inferno's" final
verse, in which all hell gives way to hope:</TE>
<TE>   we climbed and climbed until we caught a sight,</TE>
<TE>   beyond a rounded opening, of store</TE>
<TE>   on store of things of Heavenly delight;</TE>
<TE>   and we emerged to see the stars once more.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Canto V translations:</TE>
<TE>   Here are the opening verses of Canto V of Dante's "The Inferno,"
translated by:</TE>
<TE>   Ciaran Carson</TE>
<TE>   So I descended from the First into</TE>
<TE>   the tighter Second Circle: here, less space</TE>
<TE>   but greater pain, so louder screams ensue.</TE>
<TE>   Minos the terrible, with grinning face,</TE>
<TE>   squats on the threshold; here he tries the crime,</TE>
<TE>   and girds himself according to each case.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Pinsky</TE>
<TE>   So I descended from first to second circle --</TE>
<TE>   Which girdles a smaller space and greater pain,</TE>
<TE>   Which spurs more lamentation. Minos the dreadful</TE>
<TE>   Snarls at the gate. He examines each one's sin,</TE>
<TE>   Judging and disposing as he curls his tail:</TE>
<TE>   That is, when an ill-gotten soul comes down</TE>
<TE>   Allen Mandelbaum</TE>
<TE>   So I descended from the first enclosure</TE>
<TE>   down to the second circle, that which girdles</TE>
<TE>   less space but grief more great, that goads to weep</TE>
<TE>   There dreadful Minos stands, gnashing his teeth</TE>
<TE>   examining the sins of those who enter,</TE>
<TE>   he judges and assigns as his tail twines</TE>

<HD>Frida Kahlo consumes the heart and soul of a passionate
novelist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kai Maristed</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What can elevate a mere human -- born without fanfare, fated as we
all are to muddle through mortality as best we can -- to cult status?
"Cult" meaning here not the commercially orchestrated mass
prostration before entertainment's idol-of-the-month, but the real
thing: acknowledgment of the power of one iconically perceived life
to cross the boundaries of time, space and culture. The individuals
who fall under a cult figure's influence first experience the joyful
shock of encounter, followed by a shiver, the premonition of deep
personal transformation. Cult status depends on neither virtue nor
its opposite. Think of Mother Teresa, Rasputin, Mao Tse-tung, Che
Guevara, Evita Peron, Elvis Presley. Think too of the painter Frida
Kahlo, to whom novelist Carole Maso's intense prose poem, "Beauty is
Convulsive," is dedicated in every sense of the word.</LD>
<LD>   Communist. Free lover. Flamboyant cripple. Life partner of Diego
Rivera. Kahlo, the artist who has inspired countless articles and
books, not to mention the current eponymous movie, was born Magdalena
Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderon on July 6, 1907, in suburban Mexico
City. Her mother was Mexican and Indian, her father Austrian Jewish.
Frida was an early favorite subject of her father, a portrait
photographer, and later became his coloring assistant.</LD>
<LD>   "And her beloved papa photographs her and she adores -- makes love
to the lens even then.</LD>
<TE>   Live your life.</TE>
<TE>   Embrace the life you've been given.</TE>
<TE>   Your grave image. Even then. All is</TE>
<TE>   Votive: desire....</TE>
<TE>   Listen: the drums. And then you leave the frame."</TE>
<TE>   This early passage portends some of the key themes of Maso's
impressionistic yet painstakingly exact word-painting. "Beauty is
Convulsive" (the title taken from a line by her friend and mentor,
poet Andre Breton) is on one hand an interpretation of Kahlo's life,
riven by the physical trauma of her traffic accident at 19 -- broken
pelvis, damaged organs, initially given up as unsalvageable -- as
essentially a Passion in the Christian meaning of extreme suffering
and sacrifice. In 28 short sections, with titles such as "Because I
wanted you (O Mexico)," "Gringolandia" and "Votive: Oblivion," it
also charts the writer's desire for deepening "communion" with her
biographic subject.</TE>
<TE>   Maso's aim in writing to and for Kahlo is for "the distance ... to
diminish between us." There is the importunate shift into direct
address, as in the passage above. And the foreshadowing ("embrace ...
even then") of the agony awaiting the boisterous child Frida. Finally
we hear Maso's tender, frustrated acknowledgment of her subject's
elusiveness -- how Frida will always escape her father's lens frame,
the biographer's adoring eye, the lies and strictures of bourgeois
morality, the immobilizing braces, traction devices and wheelchairs,
the spiritual impoverishments of chronic pain, of infertility, lost
love.</TE>
<TE>   Something refreshing, and humble, informs Maso's eclectic
approach. Much of "Beauty is Convulsive" involves collage, pastiche,
documentation. Prose, poetry and a good deal of quotation from Kahlo,
her doctors, friends and family, and Rivera. "Look at her work ...
adorable as a beautiful smile and profound and cruel as life's
bitterness." Not all the quotes are attributed, and the effect of
this chorus of eyewitnesses, in which Maso's voice mingles, is to
keep all focus on Kahlo, on filling out the moving, fleeting picture
of her, while dispensing with the conventional stutter of footnotes
or he said/she said. A subsuming of the author's ego.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, however, it is Maso's voice -- beseeching, adoring,
consoling, confirming -- that dominates, eventually to solo. Her
identification with Kahlo grows more explicit and agitated, for
example in the unassuageable bitterness over catty put-downs leveled
by reviewers at Kahlo both during and after her life: "Frida Kahlo's
specialty was suffering, and she adopted it as an artistic theme as
confidently as Mondrian claimed the rectangle...." "Rivera was a
better artist than his wife, but it's she who is now enshrined as a
saint. Her self-portraits sell for the requisite millions.... " In
the next paragraph, with scarcely a moment's transition, we encounter
another reviewer's inexplicably venomous put-down: "An astonishingly
vapid pornographic fantasy, from the Brown/Columbia professor." It's
a bold substitution: Here the poison dart has been aimed not at Kahlo
the painter but at Maso, the writer. These and their ilk are
disturbingly recognizable barbs, delivered in familiar, oleaginous
tones, the kind of criticism the world reserves for "women's" art.</TE>
<TE>   In the final chapter, "World Tonight," the parallel between pen
and brush glows even more explicitly. "And she is sucking the blood
from her brushes, free. And she is looking in the mirror and she is
painting the earth .... And the gringa is sucking on a pen and
writing this: You are walking -- a dirt road -- free of pain." In the
last pages, decorum is torn away as Kahlo's clothes were in the
accident. Maso's incantatory description of her conjured-up subject's
embrace takes on extraordinary power. It is the full shock of
encounter. Hard to read through, and yet -- like Frida Kahlo's
painting -- impossible to look away from.</TE>

<HD>Critics' Choice nominees are ...</HD>
<DH>'About Schmidt,' 'Adaptation' lead with four each,
including best picture; Moore gathers steam for best actress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>R. Kinsey Lowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"About Schmidt" and "Adaptation" led nominations for the Critics'
Choice Awards of the Broadcast Film Critics Assn., announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Each received four nominations, including best picture. The other
nominees in that category were: "Catch Me If You Can," "Chicago,"
"Far From Heaven," "Gangs of New York," "The Hours," "The Lord of the
Rings: The Two Towers," "The Pianist" and "Road to Perdition."</LD>
<LD>   Among those nominated for best actress was Julianne Moore, who is
emerging as a front-runner in that category as the awards season
gathers steam.</LD>
<TE>   Moore, who stars in "Far From Heaven" and the yet-to-be released
"The Hours," also has earned best actress nods from the National
Board of Review and L.A. Film Critics. Although New York critics
favored Diane Lane for her turn in "Unfaithful," Moore came in second
in that group's tally. Tom O'Neill, an author and veteran Oscar
observer, noted that Lane likely benefited from an intense publicity
campaign in the days leading up to the vote, including a Lincoln
Center Film Society tribute and a party thrown by her friends at the
Four Seasons hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Moore and Lane as broadcast critic nominees for best
actress were Salma Hayek for "Frida" and Nicole Kidman for "The
Hours."</TE>
<TE>   In the best actor category were Daniel Day-Lewis, who already has
been singled out for "Gangs of New York," which opens Friday; Jack
Nicholson for "About Schmidt"; and Robin Williams for "One Hour
Photo."</TE>
<TE>   "About Schmidt," about a retired insurance actuary on a road trip
to self-revelation, also earned broadcast critics nominations Tuesday
for supporting actress (Kathy Bates) and writers (Alexander Payne and
Jim Taylor).</TE>
<TE>   "Adaptation," starring Nicolas Cage in dual roles as a neurotic
screenwriter and his twin brother, earned broadcast organization
nominations for supporting actress (Meryl Streep), supporting actor
(Chris Cooper) and writer (Charlie Kaufman, whose nomination also
recognized his screenplay for "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.") Nia
Vardalos, star and writer of the year's runaway indie hit, "My Big
Fat Green Wedding," rounded out the nominations for best writer.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Cooper, the other nominees for supporting actor
were Alfred Molina for "Frida" and Paul Newman for "Road to
Perdition." Catherine Zeta-Jones was the remaining supporting-actress
nominee for "Chicago."</TE>
<TE>   For best director, the nominees were Roman Polanski, "The
Pianist"; Martin Scorsese, "Gangs of New York"; and Steven Spielberg
for "Catch Me If You Can" and "Minority Report."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign language film nominees were "Monsoon Wedding," "Talk to
Her" and "Y Tu Mama Tambien." Best documentary contenders were
"Bowling for Columbine," "The Kid Stays in the Picture" and "Standing
in the Shadows of Motown."</TE>
<TE>   For animated feature, the broadcast group nominated "Ice Age,"
"Lilo &amp; Stitch," "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" and "Spirited
Away."</TE>
<TE>   In a variation on the animated theme, the group came up with a
category for best digital acting performance; the nominees were Dobby
in "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Gollum in "The Lord of
The Rings: The Two Towers" and Yoda: "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of
the Clones." (Although they weren't mentioned in the nominations, the
humans behind those characters were, respectively, Toby Jones, Andy
Serkis and Frank Oz.)</TE>
<TE>   The Critics Choice Awards will be announced Jan. 17 by the group,
made up of television, radio and online reviewers.</TE>

<HD>Heading home, on the road to the rest of his life</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The first mistake most new parents make is to take the baby home,
leaving behind a hospital full of professionals.</LD>
<LD>   "What's the rush?" I ask.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to go home," my wife says.</LD>
<TE>   "But you've been home before," I say. "You know what that's like."</TE>
<TE>   "Let's go," she says.</TE>
<TE>   So I pull away from the curb the way fathers of newborns always
pull away from hospitals, as if driving a load of champagne across
rail tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "Watch that bump," my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   "Got it," I say.</TE>
<TE>   They are in the backseat, mother and son, wrapped in blankets
against the December chill. More blanket than baby, there's almost
nothing to this infant boy. At 3 days old, he's light as a passing
thought.</TE>
<TE>   "You sure this car seat's tight?" my wife asks.</TE>
<TE>   "I double-checked," I tell her.</TE>
<TE>   She double-checks my double-checking. Moments like that make a
long marriage worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   "Told you," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Just checking," she explains.</TE>
<TE>   And off for the rest of his life we go, onto the freeway, where I
drive the speed limit. Ever driven the speed limit in L.A.? Of course
not. It's unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   Little old ladies in Buicks pass us as if we're standing still.
Trucks pass us. Electric cars. Sea gulls. Women pushing strollers.
Squirrels. Virtually everything in L.A. is whooshing past us.</TE>
<TE>   "Not too fast," my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   "See that, a Vega," I tell her. "A Vega just passed us."</TE>
<TE>   "Look, he's blowing bubbles," she says, admiring her second son.</TE>
<TE>   The birth was easy. There were painkillers then. Morphine.
Demerol. And that was just for the fathers. The mothers got a little
help too.</TE>
<TE>   "The doctor said that during the circumcision, his heartbeat
didn't change at all," my wife says proudly.</TE>
<TE>   "The doctor's?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, the baby's," she says.</TE>
<TE>   In a hospital, even a baby senses that things will turn out well.
The people are prepared there. A calm efficiency pervades the place.</TE>
<TE>   Now we're headed home, where calm efficiency disappeared in 1983,
replaced by a sort of martial law intended to keep things orderly.
There are curfews. Chains of command. Constant surveillance. Into
this tender truce, we bring the baby.</TE>
<TE>   "They're home!" the little girl screams.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone get the camera," says the older daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "Cheese!" says the boy.</TE>
<TE>   I bring in the flowers. I stow away the baby gear. I stay clear of
the baby until there's some sort of septic issue that threatens the
public health.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you change him?" my wife asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Into what?"</TE>
<TE>   "His diaper," she says. "Can you change his diaper?"</TE>
<TE>   It's been a good 10 years since I've changed a baby, and when I
say "good" I mean in the sense that I didn't have to change a diaper.
For even back then, I was never very good at it.</TE>
<TE>   So I set this new baby on the changing table, where he looks at me
skeptically. You can almost read his thought balloons.</TE>
<TE>   "Who are you again?" the baby wonders. "Where's the person with
the bosom?" That sort of thing.</TE>
<TE>   "Hold still," I tell him.</TE>
<TE>   He wiggles like a trout.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll fit in fine here," I say.</TE>
<TE>   The baby soon finds that being dressed by his father is akin to
the birth experience, only worse.</TE>
<TE>   For example, I can't seem to thread this kid's tiny hand through a
shirt hole the size of a nostril. I grab and try to guide his hand
through. He pulls away.</TE>
<TE>   I try bringing the hole to the arm instead of the arm to the hole.
No luck. I'd have better luck building a microcircuit with my lips.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's his other sock?" asks the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "What other sock?"</TE>
<TE>   "He's missing a sock," she says.</TE>
<TE>   The world has plenty of socks -- more socks than people, probably.
More socks than attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   But the loss of this one particular sock concerns us all. It's a
symbol of frustrations to come.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, we find the sock. Tiny as a thimble, it had slipped off
the changing table, where the dog sniffed it out of sight. When I
place a fresh one on his foot, it fits him loose. Lord, he's tiny.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had cheeseburgers bigger than you," I tell him softly.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you always think of food?" he wonders.</TE>
<TE>   "Pretty much all the time," I say.</TE>
<TE>   It's 3 in the afternoon. Darkness nears. Long nights. And there
are many hours to go before we sleep.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another generation's question to its elders might have been, "So,
what did you do in the war, Daddy?" The relevant question now might
very well be, "So, Dad, what did you wear to the clubs?"</LD>
<LD>   No better a sensory time-capsule than music or fashion. Together,
they provide a resonant blast of the past in a collection of books
over the last few months. Their pages cast long, fond looks back at
'70s and '80s street style -- from punk to hip-hop to early gangsta
rap. Collectively, they offer a record of just how B-boys and
punkettes and new wavers and beyond all got their groove on.</LD>
<LD>   PowerHouse Books has released two volumes that document vibrant,
zeitgeist-transforming music scenes. The surprise bestseller "Back in
the Days," with photos by Jamel Shabazz and an introduction by one of
hip-hop's architects, Fab 5 Freddy, revisits those crowded Brooklyn
street jams -- a wild style mix of Kangol hats, Adidas shell-top
sneaks, gold chains and screaming primary colors.</LD>
<TE>   Also from PowerHouse, "We're Desperate: The Punk Rock Photography
of Jim Jocoy," takes an unguided tour through the two-flights-down
punk scene in L.A. and San Francisco. With text by Thurston Moore,
Exene Cervenka and Marc Jacobs, the bulk of the book offers page
after page of posed portraits of the famous, near famous and
struggling to never be famous, with subjects shot with a hot flash
against iron grates, graffiti and a variety of other do-it-yourself
backdrops.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not like poseurs, but we liked to pose for pictures,"
recalls Cervenka in her back-of-the-book remembrance. "Because we
knew that there was something about that night that would be
remembered even if we couldn't remember it. We were young and naive
in a way that seems to be a lost art."</TE>
<TE>   "Who Shot Ya? Three Decades of Hiphop Photography" (Amistad
Press), edited by journalist Kevin Powell with photos by Ernie
Paniccioli, rounds up three decades of hip-hop from B-boy antics to
Conscious hip-hop and its message music. The collection is more
coffee table fare, particularly if your coffee table and the room it
sits in was featured on the latest segment of "MTV Cribs."
Paniccioli's portraits focus on the high-power faces behind the
voices.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding them out is Jim Fricke and filmmaker Charlie Ahearn's
"Yes Yes Y'all: The Experience Music Project Oral History of
Hip-Hop's First Decade" (DaCapo Press), a multidisciplinary collage
of first-person voices, photos and advertisements that pieces
together personal accounts of hip-hop's origins.</TE>
<TE>   What becomes clear, as we trace our steps back, is that the visual
elements were as important as the musical and verbal declarations.
They signaled what camp you dug yourself into. They were the battle
that announced the war that ultimately shook awake the '80s.</TE>
<TE>   Journalist Nelson George writes in his "Yes Yes Y'all" intro: "The
lack of employment for minority youth made gang culture and later
hip-hop posses [where kids could be MCs, DJs, dancers, graffiti
artists or security guards] quite attractive. What you'll find in the
personal observations, photos and posters of hip-hop's early days
that make up this book is what Hemingway termed 'grace under
pressure,' a will to survive through strength, self-expression and
plain old fun."</TE>

<DH>The 123-year-old orchestra falls victim to heavy debt and
what its interim board chairman calls 'inconsistent leadership.'</DH>

<LD>The San Jose Symphony, which ceased to present concerts earlier this
year due to longtime financial difficulties, has filed Chapter 7
bankruptcy papers, bringing an end to the 123-year-old institution.</LD>
<LD>   Symphony interim administrator Tim Beswick confirmed Tuesday that
the troubled orchestra filed the papers Monday, ending speculation
that the company might opt to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a move
which would have allowed for a reorganization, as well as the
possibility of saving its music library from liquidation.</LD>
<LD>   In early June, the orchestra, saddled with $3 million in debt and
only $300,000 in assets, announced that it would go dark for six to
18 months, but at that time its leaders had planned to reorganize the
institution.</LD>
<TE>   Jay Harris, the former publisher of the San Jose Mercury News who
has served as interim symphony board chairman since last December,
was traveling and could not be reached for comment Tuesday. But
earlier he told the Mercury News that by October it had become clear
that liquidation under Chapter 7 was inevitable because the orchestra
had begun to lose its credibility with key donors.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very sad that it ended the way it did," Harris said. "The
community has lost an institution that has given a lot to many
generations." Harris blamed the symphony's demise on "inconsistent
leadership" and bad decisions on the part of the board of directors,
such as using capital funds for operations.</TE>
<TE>   In October, with the fate of San Jose Symphony still undecided,
Andrew Bales, executive director of Ballet San Jose Silicon Valley,
announced the formation of a new orchestra, Symphony San Jose Silicon
Valley, to fill the void left when the San Jose Symphony decided to
suspend performances. The new orchestra, which performed its first
concert in October, operates under the same management umbrella as
the dance company. Many of the musicians in the new orchestra have
accompanied the ballet performances and also performed with San Jose
Symphony, which was a part-time employer.</TE>
<TE>   "Effectively what happened yesterday has no real impact on what
we're doing," Bales said Tuesday. "It was already a done deal; this
was just the filing of a piece of paper. We're moving ahead. We're
sad for all that's happened, but we're effectively not part of it at
all."</TE>

<HD>When sound barrier is broken, expect a boom!</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The speed of sound is pretty fast: 750 mph at sea level. But aircraft
such as fighter jets and the space shuttle can go even faster. When
they fly faster than the speed of sound, people on the ground hear a
loud boom that sounds like thunder. It is called a "sonic boom."</LD>
<LD>   To understand a sonic boom, you must know that air is made up of
tiny molecules. Sound comes from small disturbances of air. When a
plane or person or anything else moves through the air, the air
molecules get out of its way and are pushed forward and to the side.</LD>
<LD>   When something like the space shuttle speeds up, the aircraft
begins to move faster than the air molecules can get out of the way.
At the speed of sound or faster, the molecules bunch up around the
plane, creating extremely compressed pockets of air. The compressed
air is released suddenly toward the ground and reaches our ears as a
tremendous boom.</LD>
<TE>   Did you know there are other ways to create a sonic boom? When a
whip is snapped, a wavy loop travels down it. The tapered shape of
the whip causes this wave to go faster than the speed of sound for an
instant. Air molecules bunch up around the wave and are released,
just like what happens around an aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   To learn more about sonic booms and the effects of speed, go to
the California Science Center's exhibit "Speed" before Dec. 31. For
more information, call (323) SCIENCE or visit www.casciencectr.org.</TE>

<HD>Why should anyone settle for 'Fear' when there's family?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yes, Earl Hamner created "The Waltons," but he's quick to stress he's
no prude. After all, his resume also includes creating "Falcon Crest"
and writing eight episodes of the original "The Twilight Zone."</LD>
<LD>   That said, he can't help but sound dispirited by how family
programming is treated these days and by much of what he sees on
television.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a huge audience between Los Angeles and New York, and
people [in the TV industry] don't realize that they're there," said
the 79-year-old Virginia native, in the soothing drawl that became
familiar to millions as he narrated the wholesome drama.</LD>
<TE>   "I get upset when I tune in and, instead of human beings relating
to each other, I see human beings eating a cockroach -- which is
supposed to be entertaining -- because I find that demeaning. I
grieve for television, because it could have been a medium to elevate
and educate and energize and inspire people. There is that element,
but there's an imbalance."</TE>
<TE>   Hamner pondered this from his small Studio City office. The room
has two desks -- one with a computer, the other with an old manual
typewriter, similar to the one he used to plunk out "Spencer's
Mountain" and "The Homecoming," novels that provided the basis for
"The Waltons." Occasionally, he works on the manual, just for the
feel of it.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hollywood has little appetite for the services of a
near-octogenarian, Hamner stays busy. His latest book, "Goodnight,
John-Boy" -- a detailed account of the program and the writer's
family, which inspired it -- was released in the fall. Another book,
based on his "Twilight Zone" scripts (they include the episodes in
which a car drives its owner back to a crime scene and a piano
exposes the thoughts of those who hear it), is due out soon.</TE>
<TE>   Hamner is accustomed to being associated with "soft" shows and the
baggage that entails. He recalls a meeting of Lorimar TV producers in
the 1970s where Leonard Katzman, who was responsible for "Dallas,"
jokingly said, "We're going to talk about 'Dallas' now, so Earl
Hamner has to leave the room."</TE>
<TE>   Because of its homespun quality, "The Waltons" also remains a
political touchstone two decades after ending its initial run.
Conservatives still cite the show in reference to what's missing on
TV, and this fall the Order Sons of Italy in America seized on
Hamner's Italian ancestry with a press release headlined, " 'The
Waltons,' Not 'The Sopranos,' Are Typical Italian American Family."</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Hamner says he is a fan of "The Sopranos,"
apparently able to discern the topography of the Blue Ridge Mountains
from that of the Bada-Bing. Yet he is dismayed by the dearth of
family dramas and the dismissive attitude toward them in too-hip
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   In this environment, it's no surprise to see Entertainment Weekly
quote "Smallville" producer Brian Robbins expressing relief that the
show has passed "7th Heaven" -- a "soft" drama about a minister and
his family -- as the WB's most-watched program.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people watch '7th Heaven,' but I don't know who they
are," Robbins sniffed.</TE>
<TE>   Hamner said he understands that producers and executives want to
impress friends with cutting-edge fare. It's just that in focusing on
their peers in New York and L.A., he thinks they get disconnected
from Cincinnati, much less the little crossroad towns in between.</TE>
<TE>   "So often I tune in, and the vision of the human race that night
is of criminal behavior, or sick behavior, or people in need of a
lawyer," he said. "And I wonder, 'Where is the guy who went to work
this morning, and kissed his wife at the door, and the wife bundled
the kids off to school, and the kids went to school and studied and
learned?' "</TE>
<TE>   Hamner concedes there is less inherent drama in those situations,
making such programs harder to do, and explaining why networks often
shy away from them. Generally, such shows also take time to grow,
which isn't reassuring for executives who might not be around long
enough to participate in the harvest.</TE>
<TE>   Concern about the viability of softer shows is nothing new. When
"The Waltons" premiered in 1972, the Dallas Times Herald predicted
the series would earn positive reviews, "be embraced by a small but
enthusiastic audience, collect a number of awards and vanish from the
air with hardly a ripple."</TE>
<TE>   For all the hand wringing about family entertainment, the pendulum
has swung a bit in that direction. A consortium of advertisers, for
example, underwrites development of family shows to foster a "safe"
environment for their commercials.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, if you've watched NBC's "Fear Factor" lately, you know
it doesn't exactly air un-sponsored. "They talk wholesome, and they
show us people eating cockroaches," Hamner said, adding, "I deplore
the constant feed of grossness and rudeness," fearing that climate
will "numb and degrade the audience."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps nothing underscores how much the landscape has changed
more than the fact that "The Waltons' " time slot now belongs to
"Survivor," which exalts a different golden rule, rewarding those who
"outwit, outlast and outplay" unto others.</TE>
<TE>   Some would say that ethic has something to do with the way the TV
industry itself has been transformed. Consider Lorimar, the company
"The Waltons" helped put on the map, which merged with Tele-</TE>
<TE>   pictures, was acquired by Warner Bros., then merged with Time and
again with AOL.</TE>
<TE>   Hamner has enjoyed a varied career, writing the animated
"Charlotte's Web" and TV version of "Heidi" that NBC infamously
broadcast in 1968, cutting away from a football game when the Raiders
dramatically rallied to beat the Jets.</TE>
<TE>   All that experience has brought him wisdom, he feels, that he'd
like to share with TV's power brokers, though not as gently as
John-Boy might.</TE>
<TE>   "I always said that when I got old, I would be very tolerant of
young people. I find I'm not the least bit tolerant of young people,"
Hamner said, without any acrimony.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to shake them. And I want to tell them we old folks have
gifts too. I would like to meet with all the young people in
television, just sit down and chat. Not to preach to them, but just
to share some of the things that come to you with age."</TE>
<TE>   A lot of young TV executives and producers wouldn't benefit from
that conversation ... but I don't know who they are.</TE>

<HD>Exhibit may leave viewers feeling compromised</HD>
<DH>Photos, both powerfully tough and disturbing, show debased
people and people victimizing other creatures.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roger Ballen's photographs are, at their best and at their worst,
unnerving. They have the general appearance of portraits but function
more like theatrical tableaux or still lifes.</LD>
<LD>   Some become powerful metaphors for victimization, but others seem
like prime examples of it. What makes them problematic is that Ballen
chooses subjects already compromised by poverty and a range of
unstated but apparent ailments and dehumanizes them further by
treating them as curious props.</LD>
<LD>   In the split-second glimpse we have of these individuals, they're
not playing out the drama of their own lives but serving as edgy
character actors in Ballen's. Their lives are clearly already devoid
of beauty. Ballen too often strips them of dignity as well.</LD>
<TE>   Both the failings and the force of Ballen's enterprise come across
most vividly in his recent work, which dominates his exhibition at
the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, his first in a U.S. museum.
Ballen, who hails from New York, started out making conventionally
snappy street photographs in the late '70s.</TE>
<TE>   After earning a doctorate in mineral economics in 1981, he moved
to South Africa to work in the mining industry. His first photographs
there documented poor villages in the style of Walker Evans. The
views of weathered facades and dilapidated interiors are insistently
frontal, full of texture and the found poetry of signs and wall
hangings.</TE>
<TE>   The quiet desperation of these environments gave way to images of
their underclass inhabitants -- scruffy children and men who could be
cousins to Diane Arbus' freaks and the inbred Appalachians of Shelby
Lee Adams. In one jarring picture, two young men, twins with
unnaturally thick necks and protruding ears, stare sternly into the
camera while threads of drool hang from their heavy lower lips.</TE>
<TE>   Wall text tells us that Ballen's publication of these portraits
disturbed the South African government. The year was 1994, and the
white-ruled apartheid regime was in collapse. Ballen's pictures,
predominantly of dispossessed whites, challenged the government's
claim of Afrikaner strength and superiority.</TE>
<TE>   More than half a century earlier, August Sander's diverse
collective portrait of the German people sent a similar ripple of
unrest through his nation's government, bent as it was on
perpetuating the myth of a master race. Sander had to suspend his
project, but it remains an incisive study of identity and class.
Ballen's amounts to much less, focused as it is on the odd and
sensational, the deviant rather than the typical.</TE>
<TE>   Ballen makes it easy to pity his subjects but gives too little
context to provoke the deeper response of compassion. In the new
work, shot on the fringes of Johannesburg, Ballen drops the pretense,
at least, that the images are portraits and might deliver as such. He
regards them instead as "installations," arrangements made to reflect
his own sensibility rather than necessarily depicting any truths
about the subjects' social conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all of the images adhere to a common formula: a wall behind
and people or objects in the shallow foreground, shot frontally in a
neutralizing square format. The wall serves as a canvas of sorts, or
a sheet of paper, a base upon which Ballen's imagery rests. It's
always a rich surface, strung with wires, tattooed with graffiti,
pocked by time, stained with body oils and grime. Figures in front of
the wall assume strange, staged postures. A child raises a wire
contraption over a little white mouse on the floor. Another figure,
seated on the ground, pulls his head down into his sweater like a
turtle retreating into his shell.</TE>
<TE>   A few of the images have a spare, troublesome beauty, like the one
of a man tightly wrapped in thick felt, eyeing a swirl of wires that
hovers overhead like a personal storm cloud.</TE>
<TE>   Animals show up regularly in these tableaux, frequently as victims
of abuse. They are the ultimate innocents here. Their plight carries
great metaphorical weight and further complicates the dynamic within
the frame -- the empowered photographer shooting a powerless subject
victimizing an even more powerless animal. In one photograph, a
grinning security guard presses a puppy up against a wall like a
crime suspect. In another, a young man rests on a couch, holding a
phone to his ear with one hand and with the other gripping the back
legs and tail of a cat desperately trying to escape.</TE>
<TE>   Vulnerability and exploitation are Ballen's tools in trade -- his
subjects, his methods, his themes. He makes some powerfully tough
pictures, but too often they leave us feeling as compromised as his
subjects.</TE>

<HD>A zesty first helping of Bach's 'Christmas Oratorio'</HD>
<DH>It may take the L.A. Master Chorale six Decembers to
present the entire piece. If part one is any indication, it looks
like it could be worth the wait.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grant Gershon opened a festive Los Angeles Master Chorale holiday
program Sunday in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion with a down payment.</LD>
<LD>   He led the first part of Bach's "Christmas Oratorio," delivering
on a pledge he's made to perform the whole on separate occasions, as
Bach intended.</LD>
<LD>   He plans to take six Decembers to complete the series. It could be
worth the wait.</LD>
<TE>   With a core of 40 singers -- at least twice more than Bach ever
heard at any of his churches -- drawn from the chorale's total of
114, Gershon led a honed, bright and spirited performance of the
cantata intended for Christmas Day.</TE>
<TE>   The Master Chorale Orchestra gave rich support.</TE>
<TE>   The three soloists were drawn from the chorale -- alto Amy
Fogerson, tenor Sal Malaki and bass Greg Davies.</TE>
<TE>   This is an egalitarian idea, but it doesn't necessarily serve the
music. Choristers work to blend their sound and not stand out.
Soloists need to.</TE>
<TE>   Both Fogerson and Davies shared an unemphatic profile. In
addition, Fogerson had pitch problems. Malaki, however, did achieve a
dramatic presence as the Evangelist.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the program, which enlisted all the singers, ranged
from Morten Lauridsen's haunting "O Magnum Mysterium," composed for
the Master Chorale eight years ago but already deservedly a modern
classic, to a John Rutter arrangement of "The Twelve Days of
Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   Gershon got the audience to sing along in this carol, and the
Pavilion rang quite brightly and pleasantly with multiple repeats of
"Five golden rings."</TE>
<TE>   It was a warmup, Gershon said, for the Master Chorale-sponsored
"Messiah" sing-along Monday night.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Movie producer Steve Bing has agreed to pay $158,000 a year to
support the son he fathered with actress Elizabeth Hurley, according
to a statement released on his behalf Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   But Hurley quickly turned it down. "I fully appreciate his
generosity toward his son," she said. "However, my position remains
the same. The money is not wanted or welcome. Damian and I are
managing very well by ourselves."</LD>
<LD>   Bing's statement said the money would be paid until Damian Charles
Hurley is 18. The financial plan was agreed to in a court order
issued Tuesday in London.</LD>
<TE>   A Bing spokeswoman said that the money would be paid into a trust,
and that it was not for Hurley to turn away.</TE>

<LD>The PBS series "Frontline" captured the top honor Tuesday in the
annual Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards for excellence in
broadcast journalism, winning the gold baton prize for a series of
seven documentaries that examined the origins and impact of terrorism
by Islamic militants.</LD>
<LD>   The judges applauded the series for its clarity, insight and
balance and said it was important for "validating the role of
television news in a democracy."</LD>
<LD>   Thirteen other radio and TV outlets were given silver baton
prizes, including the first to a non-English language program: CNN en
Espanol and Jorge Gestoso for "La Doble Desaparecida" ("The Twice
Disappeared"), a report about the killing of a young woman by the
Argentinean military dictatorship.</LD>
<TE>   Other silver batons went to ABC News for a five-part report on
"Nightline" about war in the Congo, NBC News and Martin Fletcher for
coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and HBO for its
documentary "In Memoriam: New York City 9/11/01."</TE>

<LD>For midseason, UPN has picked up six episodes of "Platinum," a family
drama that follows two brothers who own and operate a record company
in the competitive world of rap and hip-hop. It was created by John
Ridley and Sofia Coppola, whose father, Francis Ford Coppola, joins
them as one of the show's executive producers.</LD>
<LD>   MTV, which, like UPN, is owned by Viacom Inc., will cross-promote
"Platinum" by airing music videos from the series. It also will
rebroadcast each week's episode eight to 10 days after its original
broadcast on UPN.</LD>

for VH1, MTV Networks and Viacom were unavailable for comment.</LD>

<HD>Condit accuses Dunne of slander</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louise Roug</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rep. Gary Condit (D-Ceres) has sued Dominick Dunne for $11 million,
alleging that the writer slandered him in connection with the
disappearance of Washington intern Chandra Levy. Dunne "made false
and defamatory statements, accusing [Condit] of involvement in the
crimes of kidnapping and murder," according to the lawsuit, filed in
federal court in Manhattan on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "Dunne was one of the major contributors to a media frenzy that
transformed allegations of sexual misconduct into false accusations
of involvement in the crimes of kidnapping and murder," said Condit's
lawyer, L. Lin Wood, in a cell-phone call from Denver. Dunne did not
return calls for comment.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, Condit hired Wood, an Atlanta-based libel lawyer who
also represents John and Patsy Ramsey, the parents of slain child
beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey, to review defamatory statements against
him. The slander suit alleges that in an interview on the nationally
syndicated radio program "The Laura Ingraham Show" last December,
Dunne said that Condit was under suspicion in the Levy case; that
Levy had "stumbled into a noxious ring of prostitution, sex slaves
and Middle Eastern sheiks in Washington, D.C., which may have
contributed to her disappearance"; that "Levy had been dumped out of
[an] airplane over the Atlantic Ocean"; and that "Condit may have
been behind Ms. Levy's abduction."</LD>
<TE>   Dunne repeated the statements in print and on TV and during
several dinner parties, including one at Trader Vic's attended by
writer Gore Vidal and actress Anjelica Huston, among others,
according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the various comments made by Dunne, Condit "has
suffered emotional distress and mental pain," and "permanent
impairment to his ability to obtain or maintain gainful employment,"
according to the suit, which seeks at least $1 million in
compensatory damages and $10 million in punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   Condit lost a primary in March after a year of revelations about
his relationship with Levy. Although he privately acknowledged that
he had had an affair with her, he denied involvement in her
disappearance. He was never named as a suspect.</TE>

<HD>Cracking the code of DVD 'eggs'</HD>
<DH>Unadvertised treats are planted on some popular releases.
To find them, grab the remote control.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marc Saltzman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the Christmas season may have visions of sugarplums dancing in
some heads, determined film fanatics are hunting for Easter eggs on
today's popular DVD movies.</LD>
<LD>   For the uninitiated, Easter eggs are secrets planted on DVDs by
film studios in the hopes fans will find them. Typically, the viewer
must press a series of buttons on the DVD remote (usually involving
the arrow keys) until the "egg" is found.</LD>
<LD>   An Easter egg could be an alternative ending to the movie, a
hidden blooper reel, a secret interview, deleted scenes, video game
or an isolated audio soundtrack to the entire film.</LD>
<TE>   MGM, for instance, began with simple goodies such as a hidden
martini recipe on the Special Edition of "Dr. No," then worked on
more creative eggs in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "We started to use more art, like a loop of Peter Sellers morphing
in his different characters in 'Revenge of The Pink Panther' " says
MGM Home Entertainment's Executive Creative Director Sharon Braun.</TE>
<TE>   If these eggs are secrets -- that is, not listed on the back of
the DVD box -- why do studios take the time to plant them?</TE>
<TE>   "Easter eggs are a treat, like the surprise you get in a box of
Cracker Jacks," answers Michael Stradford, vice president of DVD
content and programming at Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   "Many added-value features may not be strong enough to stand on
their own but do have entertainment value; using that type of content
as eggs serves as an extra treat for fans."</TE>
<TE>   Braun says Easter eggs help to make the DVD experience more
interactive and more personal for the user. "This is especially true
for hard-core fans who will take the extra time to look for a special
treat."</TE>
<TE>   Braun says eggs started as an inside joke among designers, though
consumers and fans caught on.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, marketing was not completely aware of what we were
doing; it was purely an inside thing among creative team members.</TE>
<TE>   "We are always trying to outdo ourselves and make things as fun
and interactive as possible for the consumers."</TE>
<TE>   The following is a small sampling of eggs hiding on DVDs.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring -- Extended
Edition": New Line Home Entertainment has hidden two good eggs on its
four-disc edition of "The Fellowship of the Ring."</TE>
<TE>   Insert the first DVD and choose "Select a Scene" from the main
menu. Scroll to the last page (25-27) and navigate down to the words
"The Council of Elrond."</TE>
<TE>   Press the down arrow button on the DVD remote and a gold ring will
appear on the screen. Press enter (or select on some DVD players) to
watch a humorous "alternative" version of this famous scene, cooked
up by MTV.</TE>
<TE>   Another egg can be found on the second DVD. Pop in the disc and,
from the main menu, choose "Select a Scene" and go to the last page
(Chapter 48). Scroll over to the number 48 and press the down arrow
button on the DVD remote.</TE>
<TE>   Two towers will appear. Press enter to watch a theatrical trailer
to the film, "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," introduced by
director Peter Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "Spider-Man": There are seven eggs hidden on Columbia TriStar's
hit.</TE>
<TE>   Insert the first DVD from this two-disc set and select "Special
Features" from the main menu. Next choose "Commentaries." A photo of
Harry Osborn (James Franco) can be seen on the left-hand side of the

<TE>   "A Fish Called Wanda," MGM's hilarious 1988 romantic comedy about
thievery, trickery and titillation, has a hidden gem as well.</TE>
<TE>   From the DVD's main menu, use the remote to navigate over to the
treasure chest floating above the word "Languages."</TE>
<TE>   The lid of the chest will turn orange; press enter and watch as
the words and music fade, leaving nothing but this soothing aquarium
screensaver.</TE>

<LD>INSIDE the house, the air was heavy with the smell of roast turkey
and baked apple pies. Christmas music played from a CD. A tall tree,
proud with lights, shimmered in one corner of the living room. Jack
shivered with joy, just looking at it. If only he had his special
gift ready, he would be totally happy.</LD>
<LD>   Tables, a mile long, were set up in the family room, one for
grown-ups and one for the Christmas Cousins.</LD>
<LD>   "I need the cousins to bring out the food," Grandma called from
the kitchen.</LD>
<TE>   Jack and the other cousins hurried to help. Big cousins carried
out big bowls of mashed potatoes and platters of green things. Little
cousins carried little bowls of bright red raspberry jelly and jars
of upright celery sticks.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the food was on the tables, everybody sat down. Grandpa
gave thanks, and then they ate. And ate. And ate.</TE>
<TE>   Jack didn't think they'd ever finish eating. But that gave him
more time to think about his special gift. He gazed out the window as
he thought.</TE>
<TE>   The old horse and the cows still stood together by the barn. Maybe
he should sneak out there and stay with them. That way he wouldn't
have to think up a special gift.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner the cousins took leftovers out to Tarzan. It made
Jack happy to see the big brown dog gobble the scraps of turkey meat
and a bite of pie.</TE>
<TE>   Then the cousins washed the dishes in the big, warm kitchen. They
laughed and snapped wet dish towels at one another as they worked.</TE>
<TE>   Jack helped too. But he didn't laugh quite as loud as the other
cousins. He was too worried about the special gift.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: Time is almost up. What will happen if Jack can't think
of a gift?</TE>
<TE>   This story will be on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<HD>A loving look at Venice</HD>
<DH>Documentary relates the community's dream-filled roots,
colorful past and its upbeat hopes for future fulfillment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brad Bemis' engaging documentary "Venice: Lost and Found" takes an
affectionate but balanced and clear-eyed look at the past and present
of Southern California's most colorful beach community through the
eyes of many residents, several of them celebrities.</LD>
<LD>   This all-too-brief -- only 58 minutes -- yet fairly comprehensive
overview opens gracefully with interspersed stills, many of them
postcards, of the community old and new, giving way to moving film,
thus establishing a sense of continuity in an area that in fact has
an ongoing history of wrenching change.</LD>
<LD>   Venice today faces two seemingly contradictory challenges: a high
degree of drug- and gang-related street crime, especially but not
exclusively in the heavily black and Latino Oakwood neighborhood,
coupled with the relentless gentrification that continues to displace
the elderly population.</LD>
<TE>   Bemis takes a cautiously upbeat tone in regard to Venice's future,
content to give voice to a full spectrum of predictions. It's hard
not to agree with a longtime resident, director Tony Bill, who wryly
observes that Los Angeles seems to be tilting toward the sea, with
Venice the narrow end of a funnel, leading to a community even more
congested than now. Indeed, Bemis might well consider expanding his
film at some point to feature length to address the challenges in
preserving Venice's bohemian character and diversity.</TE>
<TE>   In 1904 entrepreneur Abbot Kinney began a swift transformation of
a stretch of beachside swampland into his "Venice of America." He
envisioned it as a cultural community as well as a scaled-down Beaux
Arts emulation of the Italian original, complete with canals, which
were soon lined with Craftsman-style cottages.</TE>
<TE>   What Kinney actually created was a picturesque, if charmingly
kitschy, beach resort of such popularity he had to switch gears to
emphasize the carnival over the cultural. Local historian Elayne
Alexander considers Kinney's death in 1920 the community's greatest
calamity, for it meant the city's annexation by Los Angeles, followed
in the 1930s by the filling in of many of the canals and the pulling
of leases held by Kinney's heirs.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander undeniably has a point, but the decline of Venice,
marked by the demolition of its enchanting fantasy of an
amusement-zone pier in 1946 (an unforgivable loss to all of us old
enough to remember it) did allow it to flourish as a low-rent,
multicultural community for beats, hippies and artists -- and also
for a substantial drug culture.</TE>
<TE>   When artist Billy Al Bengston set up shop on a $30-a-month budget,
he says, "I think I was the only non-drug-dealing artist in the
area." Fellow longtime resident Dennis Hopper provides a witty and
invaluable survey of Venice as a fertile artists' colony. He points
out that 40 years ago, when Andy Warhol came to town for his seminal
exhibition at the Ferus Gallery on La Cienega Boulevard, it was in
Venice that Warhol made his first movie, "Tarzan and Jane Regained
... Sort Of."</TE>
<TE>   It was also in Venice that Charlie Chaplin first tried out his
Tramp character before the camera, with his 1914 "Kid Auto Race,"
which will be screened with "Venice: Lost and Found." Also in Venice,
modern dancer Isadora Duncan took inspiration from the crashing
waves; and Ray Manzarek ran into his old UCLA buddy Jim Morrison, who
sang "Moonlight Drive" for him, giving birth to the Doors then and
there. (Bemis might have also have noted that Duke Ellington
performed the West Coast premiere of his "Far East Suite" in the band
shell back in the '60s.)</TE>
<TE>   Bemis takes notice of the surfer culture, with references to the
skateboarders who followed, and makes a nod to the bodybuilders --
though with no mention of the legendary original Gold's Gym or the
revived Muscle Beach -- and surveys the Ocean Front Walk's homeless
as well as its street merchants and performers.</TE>
<TE>   No one captures the enduring spirit of Venice better than Harry
Perry, who, having traveled over much of the world, asks where else
he could play a guitar while roller-skating and collect money for it.
"Venice: Lost and Found" leaves us wanting more.</TE>

<HD>'Second String' has a few laughs but fumbles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The roster of memorable football movies includes "North Dallas
Forty," "The Longest Yard" and "Brian's Song."</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, "Second String," which premieres tonight at 8 on
TNT, won't make the cut. This story of a washed-up quarterback who
returns to the league at the end of the season and propels his ragtag
team to the Super Bowl has amusing moments, but its silly action
scenes strain credibility, even by the standards of the sports
comedy-fantasy genre.</LD>
<LD>   As the Buffalo Bills prepare for the playoffs, Coach Dichter (Jon
Voight) wants to add another reserve quarterback, simply to help with
practice sessions. To his chagrin, the front office signs Dan Heller
(Gil Bellows), a former Notre Dame star now peddling insurance. The
last time Dichter and Heller teamed up, the season was a debacle and
they both lost their jobs.</LD>
<TE>   Fate intervenes when the Bills' entire first-string offense, led
by veteran quarterback Doug Flutie as himself, is sickened by a tray
of bad oysters at a celebration dinner a week before the playoffs
begin.</TE>
<TE>   The food poisoning turns out to be a rare form that conveniently
lasts at least a month, so the team's Super Bowl hopes are now in the
hands of Heller, whose wife, Connie (Teri Polo), and close friend,
backup receiver Gerry Fullerton (Richard T. Jones), seem to be his
only believers.</TE>
<TE>   Director Robert Lieberman and writers Tom Flynn and Jere
Cunningham aim for "Rocky" meets "The Bad News Bears," failing to
inspire but scoring at times with humor. At one point, Mike Ditka,
ribbing his new career in the announcing booth, fills up the screen
with indecipherable Telestrator scribbles to show how the struggling
Bills got to fourth down and 42 yards to go.</TE>
<TE>   As with many sports films, however, the games play like a series
of unlikely comebacks built on improbable trick plays, all to a
chorus of lethargic crowd noise.</TE>
<TE>   You may know how the coach feels when the Bills are getting beaten
during the Super Bowl and he mutters, "I can't watch this. Tell me
when it's over."</TE>

<HD>Rudolph guides CBS to victory</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Series regulars and holiday specials helped CBS record its ninth
ratings victory in 12 weeks by the narrowest of margins, based on
viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Among programs leading the way were "CSI" -- TV's most-watched
program for the seventh time this season -- and holiday perennial
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," which easily won its Friday slot.</LD>
<LD>   On the flip side, a new animated special, "Robbie the Reindeer,"
couldn't maintain that altitude, and CBS' movie "The Man Who Saved
Christmas," starring Jason Alexander, finished behind NBC's showing
of "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation."</LD>
<TE>   "The Simpsons" continues to post banner ratings in its 14th season
-- helping "King of the Hill," which follows it, record its biggest
audience since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's "According to Jim" also hit a best-ever rating, thanks in
part to feeble competition from Fox's "Andy Richter Controls the
Universe."</TE>
<TE>   NBC's Thursday comedies generated season-low ratings, but the
network's "Fear Factor" delivered its biggest audience since May.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's "The Practice" also slipped to its lowest tune-in this fall,
while CBS' "60 Minutes" received only a modest bump from its Al Gore
interview.</TE>
<TE>   Comparing local and national results, ABC's plastic surgery
program "Extreme Makeover" was the seventh-most-watched telecast in
the Los Angeles area last week, while ranking No. 23 nationally.</TE>

<LD>Separated twins -- An article and headline in Tuesday's California
section incorrectly stated the reason for a delay in the return of
two formerly conjoined twins to Guatemala. The article and headline
said that the recovery from surgery for one of the twins was taking
longer than expected. According to UCLA's Mattel Children's Hospital,
both twins have recovered from the surgery to separate them, but
medical authorities in Guatemala have asked for additional time to
prepare for their return.</LD>

Secretary Ari Fleischer that Iraq would have "no second chance" to
disclose its weapons inventory to the U.N. was incorrectly attributed
to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. Fleischer said that Iraq would
not have a second chance to amend its weapons declaration to avoid
military intervention if U.N. members found it incomplete.</LD>

Bush's smallpox vaccination policy misstated some of the risks. The
story said that between 49 and 935 of every million people vaccinated
could experience such nonserious reactions as muscle aches, fatigue
and fever. That risk is for serious, but not life-threatening
reactions. Up to half of those vaccinated could experience minor
side-effects.</LD>

<HD>Activision Slashes Outlook on Weak Sales of Video Games</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Activision Inc., with weaker- than-expected holiday sales of its
video games, Tuesday cut its revenue and profit projections for the
quarter and full year.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Monica publisher said sales for the fiscal year ending
March 31, 2003, probably will be $823 million, 12% lower than
projections it made in October. It also expected profit to be 32%
lower at 88 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Activision, which added 8 cents to close at $15.73 in
regular Nasdaq trading, dropped after the announcement to a 52-week
low of $13 in after-hours trading. Other game stocks also slid.</LD>
<TE>   "We still expect to grow revenues and net income this fiscal
year," President Ron Doornink said.</TE>
<TE>   Although sales of the latest installment of its "Tony Hawk"
franchise have been strong, other titles have not fared as well.
"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4" sold 422,000 copies, generating $24
million in retail sales last month, but "Minority Report" earned
$400,000, far less than expected, said analyst Michael Pachter,
analyst of Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc. who is re-evaluating his
"buy" rating.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, they're writing off a bunch of games," Pachter said.</TE>

<HD>Auto Club Forms a New Alliance</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Automobile Club of Southern California said Tuesday that it has
aligned with a New England auto club to offer insurance, travel and
other services to that club's 700,000 members in Maine, Vermont and
New Hampshire.</LD>
<LD>   The move, which is not an acquisition, will give the Auto Club
greater scale and its nearly 7 million dues-paying members better
services when traveling to New England, said Thomas V. McKernan Jr.,
president and chief executive of the Auto Club, the largest affiliate
of the American Automobile Assn. in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   McKernan predicts the industry will continue to consolidate in the
next few years, pointing out that 50 smaller auto clubs have been
lost through combinations in the last seven years, leaving just 78
clubs nationwide.</LD>
<TE>   The alliance with AAA Northern New England is the first by the
Auto Club since it acquired the auto clubs of Hawaii, Texas and New
Mexico in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The move will have little effect on the Auto Club's existing
members in Southern California and will not mean higher dues or a
change in services, he said. Instead, the Auto Club promised better
services for Southern California members when they travel to other
states.</TE>
<TE>   The Auto Club of Southern California is a nonprofit organization,
which collects millions of dollars yearly, mostly through its travel
and insurance businesses. The organization also provides research and
independent recommentations, such as the diamond-rating system for
hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the auto club, with its insurance affiliate, reported
nearly $1.7 billion in revenue and about $52.5 million in profit.</TE>

<HD>FCC May Ease Cap on Cable Ownership</HD>
<DH>Flexible approach would allow one firm to control as much
as 45% of the pay-TV market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Federal Communications Commission is considering easing the
national cable ownership cap to permit a single cable company to
control as much as 45% of the national pay-television market, sources
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed rule -- which would replace a fixed 30% national cap
that was ruled unconstitutional in 2001 -- is being drafted by the
FCC's Media Bureau and is expected to be submitted soon to
commissioners. A formal FCC vote is not expected until next month.</LD>
<LD>   Critics fear the cap, if approved, would give cable giants too
much control over what Americans watch on television and how they
connect to the Internet.</LD>
<TE>   "This would turn over the nation's cable industry to two
companies, AT&amp;T Comcast and AOL Time Warner," said Jeffrey Chester,
director of the Center for Digital Democracy.</TE>
<TE>   FCC staffers are leaning toward replacing the fixed 30% cap with a
more flexible rule in which mergers that give a cable company 30% to
45% of the market would be judged on a case-by-case basis, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   That would mark a shift from other FCC rules that rely on fixed
limits. Experts say the flexible cap, if approved by the
commissioners, could provide a hint about how the FCC might approach
broadcast ownership rules that are expected to be revamped next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditionally the FCC has drawn very hard lines," said Blair
Levin, former FCC chief of staff and now an analyst at Legg Mason.
"But this new methodology is a harbinger of things to come. It tells
us how the FCC is going to approach the other rules."</TE>
<TE>   The approach is similar to a commonly used antitrust index, which
Justice Department regulators use to determine which mergers will be
approved and which ones will be subjected to closer scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell, who previously worked in the
Justice Department's antitrust division, is said to support a
case-by-case approach.</TE>
<TE>   Factors in each case would include whether a specific cable deal
hurts competition, either regionally or nationally.</TE>
<TE>   Mergers creating a cable operator serving less than 30% of the
national market would continued to be allowed. Those serving more
than 45% would be banned.</TE>
<TE>   Sources cautioned that Media Bureau Chief W. Kenneth Ferree has
not finalized the review and may make changes.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the National Cable Telecommunications Assn. said
he was not familiar with the FCC proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Adoption of the rule may spur consolidation by removing the
regulatory cloud that has hung over the market. Though the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia tossed out the 30% cap in
March 2001, industry officials expected that the FCC would attempt to
reinstate a limit and have been reluctant to pursue deals until the
new rule is complete, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   A flexible 30% to 45% cap would leave plenty of room for more
cable consolidation.</TE>
<TE>   After completing its merger last month, AT&amp;T Comcast Corp. is the
nation's largest cable operator, with 27 million customers, or 29% of
the pay-television market.</TE>
<TE>   Even a merger between the next two largest cable operators -- AOL
Time Warner Inc., with about 13 million customers, and Charter
Communications Inc., with about 8 million -- would not exceed the
lower end of the proposed range.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner, which plans to spin off its cable operations next
year, has said it would consider additional acquisitions. The New
York-based media company tried to buy AT&amp;T last year.</TE>
<TE>   Spurred by federal courts and his own views that broadcast
ownership rules were outdated, Powell has launched a top-to-bottom
review of the agency's ownership caps.</TE>
<TE>   FCC insiders said the approach on cable ownership, assuming it is
adopted by the commission, would show that Powell is not seeking to
completely reject the old rules -- as some critics have alleged.</TE>
<TE>   "He has no intention of trashing the rules," one FCC official
said.</TE>
<TE>   Content companies, including News Corp., Walt Disney Co. and
Viacom Inc., probably would oppose a higher cable ownership cap,
which they worry would give cable operators more leverage in
purchasing programming.</TE>
<TE>   Cable executives, such as AT&amp;T Comcast Chief Executive Brian
Roberts, have indicated that they hope to use their size and clout to
squeeze costs charged by cable networks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to hurt," said an executive at one entertainment
company.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS May Disclose More Data</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CalPERS, the nation's largest public pension fund, said it is
considering disclosing more information about its private equity
investments.</LD>
<LD>   It would be a policy reversal opposed by the fund's venture
capital partners, which shun such scrutiny.</LD>
<LD>   The 13-member board of the California Public Employees' Retirement
System on Monday accepted a staff recommendation that calls on the
fund to take a leading role in establishing an industry standard for
reporting of private equity data.</LD>
<TE>   Until now, CalPERS -- which has long been a vigorous advocate of
market transparency -- had resisted making public the individual
rates of return on private equity investments, partly on the grounds
that the information contained trade secrets.</TE>
<TE>   That refusal sparked a lawsuit by the San Jose Mercury News to
force the pension giant to make public the returns on its $7-billion
private equity portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a judge ordered CalPERS to disclose its returns on the
portfolio unless it could show that the information in fact contained
trade secrets.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS spokesman Brad Pacheco said the board accepted the staff's
suggestion that it lead other funds in figuring how best to report
data on private equity investments.</TE>
<TE>   Venture capital firms historically have worked in secret, limiting
information on their returns and their fees to investors or potential
investors.</TE>
<TE>   In part, the venture firms fear that their efforts to buy into
promising private companies at good prices could be compromised if
information about their activities is widely disseminated.</TE>

<HD>Carsey-Werner in Film Deal With Paramount</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Meg James</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of Hollywood's last independent television production companies
-- Carsey-Werner-Mandabach -- is shooting for the big screen.</LD>
<LD>   Carsey-Werner and Paramount Pictures said Tuesday that they would
jointly finance feature films under a three-year production deal.
Paramount, a unit of Viacom Inc., has been at the forefront of a
trend among Hollywood studios to lessen risk by seeking financial
partners.</LD>
<LD>   The deal marks the first time Carsey-Werner has ventured into the
volatile motion picture business.</LD>
<TE>   The move comes as the premiere TV producer, which established
itself with such hit comedies as "The Cosby Show" and later
"Roseanne" and "3rd Rock From the Sun," has been struggling on its
home turf.</TE>
<TE>   Carsey-Werner was forced to lay off about 15% of its 130-employee
work force this year after landing only one show on the networks,
"That '70s Show" on Fox.</TE>
<TE>   General Electric Co.'s NBC, Walt Disney Co.'s ABC, Viacom's CBS
and Fox Broadcasting have increasingly turned to their in-house
studios to produce TV dramas and comedies, limiting opportunity for
independent studios.</TE>
<TE>   The Paramount deal allows the 20-year-old independent producer
another outlet, Marcy Carsey said. "We needed to define what it is we
love to do and find other ways to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "We really love being independent, and we want to do it for as
long as possible."</TE>
<TE>   The company hasn't abandoned its TV business, however.
Carsey-Werner has nine projects in development, including three
series planned for ABC -- one of them co-produced by Steve Martin and
another by Tim Allen -- and a series planned for NBC with Whoopi
Goldberg.</TE>

<HD>Exceptions Sought to Copyright Rules</HD>
<DH>Library, educational and digital groups say copy-prevention
devices block legal duplication of many materials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A handful of library organizations, universities and
digital-rights groups plan to ask the U.S. Copyright Office today for
permission to bypass a controversial copy-protection law, but few
hold out hope that the agency will grant their request.</LD>
<LD>   The American Library Assn., the Assn. of American Universities and
the Electronic Frontier Foundation are among those groups planning to
file formal requests with the Copyright Office, the agency
responsible for carving out exceptions to the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act, a 1998 law that made it illegal to circumvent digital
copy-protection devices.</LD>
<LD>   The deadline to submit requests is today.</LD>
<TE>   Renewing many of the same concerns they raised three years ago,
the groups will argue that they need permission to bypass
copy-protection devices to make legally permissible copies of
scholarly articles, to archive materials for safekeeping and
historical purposes, and to make digital products such as DVDs able
to operate on different kinds of platforms. If that exception is not
granted, the groups say they face considerable expense buying
additional copies, or must do without.</TE>
<TE>   But representatives from several groups complained that the
Copyright Office has set such a high standard for making exceptions
to the law that it was unlikely that any of their requests would be
granted. In fact, some groups were so discouraged that they are not
bothering to participate in the DMCA proceeding or are investing less
time and money.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people feel, 'What's the point? Why bother,' " said
Miriam Nisbet, a lobbyist for the American Library Assn. "They fear
the process is still stacked against them and there's not much hope
for change. The standard is too high."</TE>
<TE>   The review occurs every three years. After the last review, the
agency granted only two, narrowly crafted exemptions, one for
Web-filtering software, the other for malfunctioning or obsolete
products.</TE>
<TE>   David Carson, general counsel for the Copyright Office, said the
standards for the review were set by lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "The process is dictated by the law Congress passed," Carson said.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say the Copyright Office, which frequently sides with
authors and content providers, went too far in requiring that those
seeking an exemption prove that the anti-circumvention law is causing
actual harm.</TE>
<TE>   "Our job is to show damage," said John Vaughn, executive vice
president of the Assn. of American Universities. "We haven't been
able to do that, in part because we can't afford to let the damage
happen."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview earlier this year, Copyright Register Marybeth
Peters took issue with the contention that publishers and
entertainment companies would use the DMCA to lock up content. "So
far, from what we've learned, the fears that were expressed have not
become reality. That's music to my ears," Peters said.</TE>

<HD>Murdoch to Discuss a New Bid for DirecTV</HD>
<DH>This time, News Corp. may team up 50-50 with Liberty Media
to buy the satellite TV firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rupert Murdoch and John Malone are gearing up for a second run at
DirecTV, but this time as 50-50 partners, sources said, an unexpected
change that reflects their different agendas as they pursue the
nation's leading satellite TV provider.</LD>
<LD>   Top executives of Murdoch's News Corp. are scheduled to discuss a
new deal in New York today with representatives of General Motors
Corp., which owns DirecTV through its El Segundo-based subsidiary,
Hughes Electronics Corp. Sources close to the companies said the
meeting is a preliminary one and may not cover such details as price
and structure.</LD>
<LD>   But it will be the first since News Corp., with $500 million in
financial backing from Malone's Liberty Media Corp., lost a bidding
war for Hughes a year ago to EchoStar Communications Corp. GM put
DirecTV back on the auction block last week, after the EchoStar
merger was abandoned in the face of opposition by federal regulators.</LD>
<TE>   Murdoch has long craved DirecTV, seeing it as the missing link in
News Corp.'s worldwide satellite operation, which spans from China,
through Asia and continental Europe, to Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the EchoStar-Hughes deal was scrapped, News Corp. had
amassed a war chest this year big enough for a solo bid should
DirecTV become available again. Still, some on Wall Street say the
company's balance sheet would be less strained with Malone's help.</TE>
<TE>   Less clear has been Malone's motivation, especially Liberty
Media's insistence that it would pursue Hughes even without Murdoch.</TE>
<TE>   Liberty is mostly a collection of media investments managed by a
mogul better known for his ruthless opportunism and clever financial
engineering than his operational prowess.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is trying to figure out why Liberty is so adamant about
owning DirecTV ... it's not immediately obvious what strategic
benefits Liberty gets," said Merrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif
Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   But those close to Malone say there is a logical explanation for
his proposed 50-50 structure. Although he was content last time
around to be a silent partner, they say, the Denver mogul is now
being driven by concerns over how Liberty is regulated.</TE>
<TE>   Because so many of Liberty's assets are minority investments
rather than controlling positions in operating companies, Malone is
said to be worried that securities regulators could reclassify it as
a mutual fund, triggering undesirable tax consequences and preventing
it from hedging its positions by using financial instruments such as
derivatives.</TE>
<TE>   "Liberty has always danced close to the edge of being ranked as a
mutual fund," said one executive close to the situation. "It's been
an ongoing concern."</TE>
<TE>   Sources said Malone hopes to free Liberty from the regulatory
uncertainty through two upcoming transactions in which it would have
control powers. Hughes is one of those deals.</TE>
<TE>   The other, word of which first surfaced this summer, would see
Liberty emerge as the single largest stockholder in a new company
that would hold the U.S. entertainment operations of Vivendi
Universal, including its Hollywood studios, theme parks and the
recording label.</TE>
<TE>   Under one scenario being discussed, Liberty would contribute its
100%-owned Starz Encore Group, valued by Wall Street at about $5
billion; its 3% stake in Vivendi; and cash in exchange for an equity
position of about 30% in the new company, sources said. Malone's
partner in such a deal, some say, would be Barry Diller, co-chief
executive of the Universal assets and chairman of USA Interactive
Inc. Malone is a major shareholder of USA Interactive.</TE>
<TE>   However, it's far from certain that Vivendi will be willing to go
along with Malone's plan. Billionaire Marvin Davis has made his own
offer for the entertainment assets, and other bidders also are likely
to surface.</TE>
<TE>   Liberty Chief Executive Robert Bennett has portrayed the DirecTV
deal's merits as financial, arguing that the asset is undervalued and
on the verge of turning cash-flow positive.</TE>
<TE>   As for Liberty's need for joint control with News Corp., company
officials said the strategy is in keeping with a promise to
shareholders in the wake of a spate of disappointing minority
investments since 2000 that have decimated Liberty's stock value.</TE>
<TE>   "Our shareholders are more comfortable if we have control or
significant influence over the outcome," said Liberty spokesman
Michael Erickson. "We want to control our destiny."</TE>
<TE>   Liberty shares have fallen 68% from a peak in early 2000, as media
and technology stocks have plunged and a couple of the companies in
which Liberty invested have come under investigation or filed for
bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   So far, News Corp. seems to be giving Malone what he wants.</TE>
<TE>   The two companies are talking about giving Liberty board
representation and governance powers equal to News Corp.'s, according
to sources close to the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Liberty and News Corp. each would put up half of the estimated $5
billion that Wall Street says it would cost for GM's 30% controlling
stake in Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   Malone, however, is keeping his options open.</TE>
<TE>   One source said he will not be represented at today's meeting
because he wants to retain rights for his company to pursue Hughes on
its own should News Corp. not agree to all his conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Malone nor Murdoch returned calls seeking comment. GM
officials could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Liberty once controlled an enviable array of cable programming.
But since the mid-1990s, it has exchanged many of these holdings for
minority positions in the world's largest media giants. For instance,
Liberty sold its 20% stake in Turner Broadcasting System to Time
Warner and now owns 4% of AOL Time Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Malone sold Murdoch his 50% stake in their sports joint venture as
well as a 22% interest in Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Liberty now owns 18% of News Corp., slightly less than Murdoch's
own 20% in equity.</TE>

<HD>Dollar Skids as Fears of War Rise</HD>
<DH>The buck falls against the euro, the yen and other
currencies. Gold reaches a 51/2-year high.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dollar, not long ago the strongman of world currencies, is
wilting as global investors fret about the potential for war with
Iraq and about the huge U.S. trade deficit.</LD>
<LD>   The dollar closed at nearly a three-year low against the euro on
Tuesday, though it rallied from its worst levels after the White
House said it favors a robust currency.</LD>
<LD>   It also fell against the yen, the Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar
and other key currencies.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, gold hit a 5 1/2-year high, benefiting in part from the
dollar's woes.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the latest downturn in the dollar's value reflects
concern that a conflict with Iraq is inevitable, and that a war would
encourage foreign investors to keep their money home.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. needs to lure about $1.4 billion of foreign capital a day
to fund its trade deficit.</TE>
<TE>   The currency tumbled early Tuesday after Secretary of State Colin
L. Powell said the U.S. is skeptical Iraq has made a full declaration
of its weapons-production programs.</TE>
<TE>   The euro rose as high as $1.033, its strongest since January 2000.
But the dollar clawed back from some of its losses after White House
spokesman Ari Fleischer said the government supports a "strong"
currency.</TE>
<TE>   The euro ended at $1.028 in New York, up from $1.022 Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar eased to 121.24 yen from 121.28 Monday. It fell to
1.428 Swiss francs from 1.443.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer's comments were the first by the Bush administration
since the president ousted Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and
named John W. Snow to replace him. The statement dimmed speculation
that Snow -- a member of the Business Roundtable, an executive group
that has urged the government to weaken the dollar -- would try to
drive down the dollar to bolster U.S. exports.</TE>
<TE>   A cheaper currency makes U.S. exports less expensive abroad. The
flip side is that it makes imports more expensive for American
consumers, threatening higher inflation.</TE>
<TE>   Currency traders pay close attention to government pronouncements
on the dollar, because if the administration chooses it could
intervene to buy dollars in the market to stem any decline.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two decades, investors who believe the dollar's
value is too high have regularly pointed to the U.S. trade deficit.
The deficit in the U.S. current account, the broadest measure of
trade in goods and services, was $127 billion in the third quarter,
near a record high.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, a large deficit undermines an economy and its currency,
over time. But in the late 1990s the dollar benefited as investment
poured into the U.S. from overseas.</TE>
<TE>   However, a war "will lead to a sharp reduction in cross-border
capital flows," said Lee Ferridge, head of global currency strategy
at Rabobank in London. "It'll be bad for the dollar because of the
current account deficit."</TE>
<TE>   Concern that the dollar might continue to slide also is driving
some global investors to buy gold. Near-term gold futures in New York
edged up 40 cents to $337.40 an ounce Tuesday, the highest since June
1997. The price has jumped from $318 at the end of October.</TE>
<TE>   "Gold is the anti-dollar trade," said Robert Sinche, currency
strategist at Citibank in New York.</TE>

<HD>Factory Output Shows Modest Gain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first gain in U.S. industrial output since July and a report
showing that inflation remains tame raised hopes Tuesday that the
U.S. economy may be emerging from its "soft spot."</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Reserve said industrial production eked out a 0.1%
gain in November, boosted by automotive production. It was the first
gain in total output since July's 0.7% advance.</LD>
<LD>   The factory sector has been hard hit by last year's recession.
After showing signs of revival this year, manufacturing again slumped
as the summer ended. November's gain, though small and led by the
volatile auto sector, cheered economists.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported Tuesday that consumer
prices rose only 0.1% in November, and 0.2% excluding food and
energy.</TE>
<TE>   Christine Chmura, chief economist with Chmura Economics &amp;
Analytics in Richmond, Va., said the reports show the economy is not
slipping back into recession.</TE>
<TE>   "The latest reports provide some good evidence that we're
beginning to move out of this soft part of the economic cycle," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Though November's gain in industrial output was seen as a
positive, economists also noted that it was boosted by a sharp 3.9%
gain in auto production. And industries were running at only 75.6% of
potential capacity in November, well off the recent high of 83.6%
seen in May 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "The small 0.1% increase in total and manufacturing production was
not much help to most manufacturers," said Daniel Meckstroth, chief
economist for the Arlington, Va.-based Manufacturers' Alliance/MAPI.</TE>
<TE>   "Industry needs a re-accelerating general economy and more export
opportunities to employ idle capacity and thus stimulate a rebound in
capital spending," he said.</TE>

<HD>No Spark in Sales of Electronics</HD>
<DH>Best Buy cuts outlook and Circuit City posts a loss as
thrifty shoppers focus on bargains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Best Buy Co. cut its profit forecast Tuesday because of disappointing
holiday sales at its music stores, and Circuit City Stores Inc. had a
third-quarter loss as it cut prices and sold fewer higher-profit
items.</LD>
<LD>   Best Buy, the largest U.S. electronics retailer, said profit this
quarter would be 5 cents lower than its previous estimate, sending
its shares down 5.5%. Shares of smaller rival Circuit City fell 11%.</LD>
<LD>   Declining music sales at Best Buy's mall-based stores, including
Sam Goody, will hurt profit this quarter. Sales of
satellite-television systems and wireless telephones slowed at
Circuit City. Both retailers are cutting prices and offering
interest-free financing to keep customers from fleeing to discounters
such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp.</LD>
<TE>   "People are buying, but they are buying the bargains," said Brian
Bruce of PanAgora Asset Management Investors.</TE>
<TE>   Best Buy's third-quarter net income rose to $85 million, or 26
cents a share, as sales increased 16% to $5.5 billion, the company
said. Circuit City had a net loss of $17.8 million, or 9 cents,
compared with a profit of $27.7 million, or 10 cents, a year earlier.
Sales gained 7% to $2.42 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Eden Prairie, Minn.-based Best Buy fell $1.40 to $24 in
New York Stock Exchange trading. They have dropped 52% this year.
Circuit City, based in Richmond, Va., fell 92 cents to $7.27, also on
the NYSE. They had fallen 58% since last December.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at Best Buy stores open at least 14 months fell 0.4% in the
third quarter ended Nov. 30, led by a 12% decline at Sam Goody and
other mall-based stores. Net income was $80 million, or 25 cents, in
the year-earlier quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Best Buy reduced its fourth-quarter forecast to $1 to $1.10 a
share. Profit will be hurt by an $80-million to $85-million operating
loss at its Musicland stores unit, which includes the Sam Goody music
and Suncoast video chains, the company said. Best Buy had net income
of $350 million, or $1.08, in the year-earlier fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at Circuit City stores open at least a year rose 6% from the
year-earlier third quarter. The retailer had costs to remodel and
relocate stores, and said remodeling costs for the year will be less
than the company's estimate of 18 cents a share. Circuit City didn't
provide a forecast for this quarter.</TE>

<HD>UC San Diego Business School Will Get Technical</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The tech sector is in a terrible slump. After a string of
headline-grabbing scandals, the world of high finance has been
reduced to fodder for late-night TV comedy monologues.</LD>
<LD>   So what is UC San Diego doing?</LD>
<LD>   It's starting a business school to prepare students for management
in a technology-based economy.</LD>
<TE>   The timing may seem curious, but UC San Diego is on to something.
Though tech companies are hurting now, the fields of bioscience and
medicine, engineering and computers surely will remain the economic
growth engines for the state -- and indeed the whole nation -- in the
decades ahead.</TE>
<TE>   It is thus essential that students with a background in those
disciplines also learn how to be effective business executives.</TE>
<TE>   "We want young people with a scientific and engineering bent,"
says Robert Sullivan, who will become dean of the Graduate Management
School at UC San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The institution isn't slated to open its doors until 2004. It will
start with a handful of working executives going back for their MBA
degrees and gradually build up to a student body of 300.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan, who has headed business schools at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh, is just starting to hire his faculty at UC San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   But already he is reaching out to San Diego companies, including
diagnostic products maker Biosite Inc. and telecommunications giant
Qualcomm Inc., which are located near campus. His aim is to forge a
symbiotic relationship whereby UC San Diego and the corporate
community can collaborate on research projects, share personnel and
spawn ventures.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last 25 years San Diego has become a community known for
innovation," says professor Mary Walshok, who heads UC San Diego's
extension programs. "It is the perfect place for the development of a
21st century business school, one focused on global technology
companies and entrepreneurship."</TE>
<TE>   The UC San Diego program is the latest entrant in the
ever-expanding arena of business education.</TE>
<TE>   The necessity for MBAs has grown "because managing business today
is much more demanding of analytical skills" than it used to be, says
Bruce Willison, dean of the Anderson business school at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   He cites, for instance, the need to parse reams of computer data
on customers -- "data mining" as it's called -- to put together a
sophisticated marketing strategy. At the same time, mastering
elaborate mathematical models is required to handle a corporation's
finances. On top of such arcane subjects, there also is the
imperative to study ethics and leadership.</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, graduate-level business enrollment in the U.S.
has risen 35% -- there are now 250,000 MBA candidates. Throw on top
of that an additional 750,000 undergraduates taking business courses.
Meanwhile, the numbers abroad are comparable -- and growing even
faster.</TE>
<TE>   In foreign countries, "business is seen as part of the American
success story," notes John Fernandes, president of the Assn. to
Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. The St. Louis-based nonprofit
organization was founded in 1916 by 17 U.S. universities, including
Harvard and UC Berkeley. Today, it has 432 members around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   But not all of these schools take the same approach.</TE>
<TE>   As UC San Diego is showing, California's business programs often
aim at producing entrepreneurs, not the wingtipped corporate managers
churned out by Harvard -- the place where George W. Bush, the first
MBA president, got his degree.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the Marshall School of Business at USC teaches its
students how to run a small company -- and, with some luck, turn it
into a big company. USC graduate Paul Orfalea, the founder of
Kinko's, "thanked us for a strong finance course," Marshall Dean
Randolph Westerfield boasts.</TE>
<TE>   The business school at USC also works closely with the
university's famed School of Cinema-Television to train managers for
the entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   In the same specialized vein, the Keck Graduate Institute of
Applied Life Sciences was set up five years ago at the Claremont
Colleges to train executives to work in the biotechnology and medical
industries.</TE>
<TE>   Now UC San Diego's management school will add innovations of its
own. Its MBA program, for example, will require only one year of
study, in contrast to the standard two-year regimen at other graduate
business schools.</TE>
<TE>   "The heads of many firms, including Goldman Sachs and Charles
Schwab, said make your course shorter," Sullivan explains. Companies
want to bring in "people capable of learning and then spend the first
year training them in the company's systems."</TE>
<TE>   The compressed schedule will impose other demands. Students should
take basic classes such as business statistics "on their own time in
the summer," Sullivan says, "and then come prepared to learn."</TE>
<TE>   Being prepared to learn is precisely what will drive our economy
ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "The business of America is business," President Calvin Coolidge
said in 1925. Today, as UC San Diego is making clear, the business of
America is knowledge.</TE>

<LD>   The legendary company that introduced black lingerie to America

<TE>   The $10-billion market is teeming with competitors, which have
honed to a fine art Frederick's once-innovative recipe of mixing sex
with a touch of sleaze.</TE>
<TE>   So while clinging to its storied heritage, Frederick's is trying
to set itself apart and appeal to a new generation of customers who
might have a need for a French maid costume or a feather-trimmed
teddy, garments that could not be found at rival Victoria's Secret.</TE>
<TE>   Yet squaring off against Victoria's Secret, a unit of Columbus,
Ohio-based Limited Brands Inc., won't be easy. As Frederick's has
struggled through tough financial times, Victoria's Secret has made
sexy lingerie as mainstream as cotton underwear. A Victoria's Secret
fashion show, featuring scantily clad models, aired recently on
prime-time television.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria's Secret "has become very much the standard in the minds
of the consumer," said Dorothy Lakner, an analyst with CIBC World
Markets.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at Victoria's Secret could not be reached for comment
Tuesday about Frederick's plans.</TE>
<TE>   Department stores these days also offer a wide range of sleepwear
and intimate apparel, as do discounters such as Target Corp. and
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Specialty retailers such as San Francisco-based
Gap Inc. and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. have gone after the young
lingerie shopper as well.</TE>
<TE>   Reintroducing itself to younger consumers just in time for the
holidays -- and just in time to battle Victoria's Secret's own
high-profile "Sexy Christmas" advertising campaign -- Frederick's
last month launched a "Tease the Season" ad blitz, erecting
billboards and bus placards throughout Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Next spring, the retailer will have 11 of its products featured in
Seventeen magazine's "prom special" edition.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to go after young teens; we're trying to go
after young women. Young, single, happening, hip women," Chief
Executive Linda LoRe said.</TE>
<TE>   But whether Frederick's will manage to buff an image considered by
some to be more tawdry than hip remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Frederick's has shuttered 44 stores and opened seven since filing
for bankruptcy protection in July 2000. Currently, it operates 177
stores nationwide and has 1,325 employees. LoRe said the retailer
plans to open an undisclosed number of new locations next year.</TE>
<TE>   Frederick's also has been refurbishing stores, including the one
at the Glendale Galleria, with red velvet curtains and leopard-print
carpeting. The idea, LoRe said, is to give each outlet a "boudoir
feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Over the next couple of years, Frederick's will "touch up" every
store in its chain, LoRe added, including the flagship store on
Hollywood Boulevard, which got its last face-lift 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the changes will go only so far. "We did not abandon our
heritage," LoRe said. "We don't do flannel."</TE>
<TE>   But Victoria's Secret does -- and that could be a problem for
Frederick's, industry insiders say, because young women want snuggly
as well as sexy.</TE>
<TE>   "Women don't necessarily wear the sexier items every single day of
the week," analyst Lakner said. "There's cotton underwear and comfort
to be taken into consideration."</TE>
<TE>   Comfort, though, didn't seem to be foremost on customers' minds
Tuesday at the Frederick's store at The Block at Orange.</TE>
<TE>   On display were red Santa teddies and see-through nighties trimmed
with marabou feathers and a "holiday" French maid costume, also in
scarlet.</TE>
<TE>   Shoppers said they liked the ultra-sexy products -- and the low
prices.</TE>
<TE>   Though a rack in a back corner included cotton pajamas and five
no-nonsense terry-cloth robes, most of the apparel was sex-tinged,
including skimpy nighties, thong underwear and padded or water-filled
bras.</TE>
<TE>   A hot seller: a red and black "cherry blossom" corset for $48.</TE>
<TE>   The "Boudoir Cafe" features an "edibles" section, where
his-and-her undies go for $7 each.</TE>
<TE>   Frederick's was founded in 1946 by Fred Mellinger, who was
inspired by a World War II pinup of a scantily clad Betty Grable. A
year later, Frederick's moved to Los Angeles from New York. The
company expanded into mail-order catalogs and opened mall stores, but
its name was somewhat smudged because it sold sex toys along with
undergarments. The company has since backed off the erotic
paraphernalia to focus on lingerie.</TE>
<TE>   Frederick's endured a variety of struggles through the late 1990s,
when it churned through four chief financial officers. It filed for
bankruptcy protection two years ago, weighed down by slipping sales
and $55 million in debt. Of that, $14 million remains on the firm's
books and is being replaced with two notes to be repaid over the next
six years, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   The company now is owned by a group led by Credit Agricole
Indosuez, a French bank.</TE>
<TE>   As of last month, Frederick's same-store sales were up about 6%, a
better record than at many other specialty retailers.</TE>
<TE>   "What you have here is a senior management team and their staff
who are focused on the future," said LoRe, who took over six months
before the bankruptcy filing. "We learn what we do wrong and move
on."</TE>

<HD>Court OKs Global's Plan to Wipe Out Obligations</HD>
<DH>Proposal, which includes selling stock to two Asian firms,
would lift it out of bankruptcy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James S. Granelli</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd., which collapsed under the weight of $12.4
billion in debts, won court approval Tuesday to wipe out its
obligations for pennies on the dollar and to emerge from bankruptcy
protection as a new company -- ready to compete aggressively, some
say, against major long-distance carriers.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert E. Gerber in New York signed off on
Global Crossing's plan to sell 61.5% of its new stock to two Asian
companies for $250 million and allocate remaining shares among four
classes of creditors.</LD>
<LD>   Approval of the plan also marks time for the company's co-founder
and chairman, Los Angeles financier Gary Winnick, who built the
private worldwide fiber-optic network and is expected to be replaced
once the company emerges from Chapter 11 in the next few months.</LD>
<TE>   Winnick has come under intense criticism and investigations for
the company's woeful financial condition, hurt by questionable
accounting, lavish spending and extravagant salaries and bonuses. He
also cashed out more than $575 million in stock during the company's
heyday of the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Even though shareholders receive nothing under the court-approved
plan and the stock is officially worthless, buyers bid up Global's
shares Tuesday by 1.6 cents to 3.1 cents in trading on the electronic
Pink Sheet market.</TE>
<TE>   The only significant hurdle left for Global is approval of the
deal by the Federal Communications Commission. The agency is expected
to decide by the end of March whether it will allow Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd. in Hong Kong and Singapore Technologies Telemedia to control the
operation, which counts the U.S. Defense and State departments among
its 85,000 customers.</TE>
<TE>   The company also faces federal probes into its accounting
practices and possible insider trading, as well as a host of
securities class-action suits. But the company said those issues
should not hinder its emergence from bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   The court's approval makes Global the biggest operation on the
growing list of telecommunications companies that have emerged from
Chapter 11 with little or no debt. Among the others: McLeodUSA Inc.,
360Networks Inc., Williams Communications Group Inc. and Mpower
Holding Corp. Many analysts believe that the revived telecoms will
further drive down prices.</TE>
<TE>   "Global's competitors are not going to be the least bit pleased
about this," said researcher Brownlee Thomas at Giga Information
Group.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Thomas said, Global probably will price its long-distance
services just below those of major competitors such as Sprint Inc.,
financially troubled Qwest Communications International Inc. and
WorldCom Inc., which also is operating under bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst David Neil at research firm Gartner Inc. in Stamford,
Conn., said Global Crossing could provide corporate discounts -- it
doesn't target residential customers -- of up to 20% and still have
enough of a profit margin to make it a successful carrier.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, this puts them in a good position," Neil said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the telecommunications market remains beset by
overcapacity. And Global has its own issues to contend with. "They
still have to overcome the stigma of Chapter 11 and the nervousness
of commercial customers over the telecom industry," Neil noted. "They
have to show they're not going to screw up again and that they can
manage the company."</TE>
<TE>   The bankruptcy filing eliminates $7.8 billion to $8.7 billion in
debts. Remaining liabilities are primarily at its 59%-owned
subsidiary, Asia Global Crossing Ltd., and at subsidiaries that were
not under bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, John Legere will continue as chief executive, a
post he took over 13 months ago as the company was reeling from low
demand in an industry choked with a glut of unused fiber-optic
capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchison and Singapore Technologies will each have 30.75% of the
new company. Banks will take 6%, along with $311 million in cash and
$175 million in new debt securities to recover 22.7 cents on every
dollar of their $2.25 billion in loans.</TE>
<TE>   Other creditors won't fare as well. Those with $3.8 billion in a
subsidiary's notes will get 3.2 cents on the dollar in a package
consisting of nearly $4.6 million in cash, about $19 million in new
notes and a 24.7% stake.</TE>
<TE>   Those with $620 million in another subsidiary's notes also will
get 3.2 cents on the dollar. Their package consists of $739,200 in
cash, $3.08 million in new notes and a 4% stake in the company.</TE>
<TE>   Those with $1 billion to $1.9 billion in unsecured claims were
split into two groups. Large creditors will get 1.4 cents to 1.9
cents on the dollar by sharing $706,800 in cash, $2.9 million in new
notes and 3.83% of new stock. Small creditors, those owed less than
$100,000 each, share in the lesser of $3 million in cash or 5% of
their claims to get 4 cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick is trying to arrange a $25-million personal donation to a
company pension fund by the end of the month to cover losses that
certain employees incurred as the company crashed into bankruptcy in
January, a source close to him said. He made the surprise pledge at a
congressional hearing last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Legere would not comment on the court's ruling or his plans. In a
news release, he called the court's approval a "clear vote of
confidence in our future."</TE>
<TE>   Legere has said that few customers have fled since January, and
monthly financial statements filed with the court show that the
company has $271 million of cash on hand at the end of October.</TE>
<TE>   The company has been burning through more than $60 million a month
from August through October, but should have enough to get out of
bankruptcy protection, analysts and company executives have said. It
lost $150 million in October on sales of $256 million.</TE>
<TE>   The state-of-the-art fiber-optic Global Crossing network
envisioned by Winnick, a former associate of junk bond advocate
Michael Milken at now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert brokerage,
encompasses more than 200 major cities in 27 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Asia Global Crossing also has filed for bankruptcy protection with
a plan to be acquired by China Netcom Communications Group Corp.</TE>

<HD>Russian Firm Cleared in Digital-Piracy Trial</HD>
<DH>A jury finds ElcomSoft didn't intend to violate U.S. law
with software to pick locks on e-books.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a blow to anti-piracy efforts, a federal jury acquitted a Russian
software company Tuesday of violating U.S. law by selling a program
that picked the locks on Adobe Systems Inc.'s electronic books.</LD>
<LD>   ElcomSoft Co. of Moscow was the first company to be tried
criminally under the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which
makes it illegal to break the locks on digital books, music and
movies even for legal purposes. The San Jose jury rejected all five
charges, finding that the company did not intend to violate the law.</LD>
<LD>   Legal analysts said the verdict suggests that prosecutors will
have a tough time using the DMCA against technology developers and
hackers without solid proof that the defendants knew they were
breaking the law.</LD>
<TE>   "That's going to be very hard to prove without a memo saying,
'Gee, this is illegal, but we should do it anyway,' " said copyright
attorney Jonathan Band.</TE>
<TE>   Said ElcomSoft lawyer Joseph Burton: "Companies are going to be a
little bit more careful ... and certainly federal prosecutors will
more carefully consider when they're making decisions about charging
somebody."</TE>
<TE>   Copyright holders still can use the DMCA to bring civil lawsuits
against those who develop circumvention techniques. And unlike
criminal cases, such lawsuits can be won without proving any intent
to break the law.</TE>
<TE>   But Evan Cox, an attorney and copyright expert, said lawsuits
often aren't much of a deterrent. Bringing criminal charges "is an
important tool, and I think it has been weakened by this case," Cox
said.</TE>
<TE>   The DMCA was designed to boost online commerce by addressing
copyright holders' concerns about Internet piracy. Among other
things, the statute outlaws the manufacture, sale or use of any tool
that picks the locks on digital files.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say it leaves consumers unable to make backup copies of
the digital goods they buy, transfer their music to portable devices
or make other "fair uses" of copyrighted material.</TE>
<TE>   Many copyright holders, on the other hand, rely on electronic
locks to protect goods they deliver online. And their greatest
concern, Cox said, is the emergence of simple tools that "consumers
are easily and casually going to use to unlock things and hand them
to all their friends."</TE>
<TE>   Privately held ElcomSoft's main products are designed to help
businesses and law enforcement officials recover damaged files or
break open scrambled documents that were protected by lost software
keys.</TE>
<TE>   According to court documents, ElcomSoft began selling an "Advanced
eBook Processor" on June 20, 2001, that could strip the locks off of
e-books in Adobe's format. Those locks help publishers prevent their
books from being copied to other computers or devices, printed,
edited or excerpted.</TE>
<TE>   The purpose of ElcomSoft's program, according to the company's Web
site, was to let e-book buyers read their purchases wherever they
wanted. The program was on the market less than a week when ElcomSoft
pulled it in response to Adobe's complaints. Nonetheless, Adobe took
the case to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   On July 16, 2001, FBI agents arrested Dmitry Sklyarov, a
programmer for ElcomSoft, after he spoke to a hacker convention in
Las Vegas. A federal grand jury indicted him and ElcomSoft the
following month; prosecutors eventually agreed to drop the charges
against Sklyarov in exchange for his testimony.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte in San Jose made two key rulings
in the case, one favoring the prosecution and the other favoring the
defense.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Whyte ruled that the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions
were constitutional even though they applied to technologies that
helped consumers make fair use of the scrambled files they purchased.
This ruling echoed a decision from a New York appeals court.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, however, Whyte instructed the jury that ElcomSoft could
be acquitted if it honestly but erroneously believed it wasn't
violating the law. And as Burton stressed to the jury, company
executives thought the product was legal because it was designed for
fair uses.</TE>
<TE>   The jury deliberated for less than seven hours over two days.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are bringing good cases under new statutes, sometimes
you are going to lose, and that's what happened here," said Kevin
Ryan, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California.</TE>
<TE>   Fred von Lohmann of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online
civil liberties group that supported ElcomSoft, said jury verdicts
don't have much value as precedents, so it will be hard for other
companies to use the acquittal in their cases. "It's great news, but
I don't think it's going to let other folks in the future off the
hook," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Adobe spokeswoman Holly Campbell said the San Jose-based company
was disappointed by the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "As we increasingly move from a paper-based to a digital society,
we will find more and more instances where laws designed to protect
the rights of authors and publishers will be challenged in light of
the new capabilities technology provides," Campbell said. "These
cases will be an important part of developing appropriate laws and
guidelines that continue to protect the rights and freedoms of
individuals and corporations alike."</TE>

<HD>Home Construction Up in November</HD>
<DH>Housing starts rebound, though the West, aside from
California, shows significant decline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jesus Sanchez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The pace of home and apartment building in the United States
rebounded in November after falling the previous month, as low
mortgage rates continued to boost the housing business and the
nation's fragile economy, according to government figures released
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Construction activity would have been even stronger if not for a
significant decline in the West, where the relatively strong
California real estate market was not enough to offset weakness in
the rest of the region, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Nationwide, housing starts in November rose 2.4% from October's
revised figure, to an annualized rate of 1.697 million units,
according to the Commerce Department. During the previous month new
home construction fell by 8.4%.</LD>
<TE>   The report showed that housing activity strengthened in every part
of the country except for the Northeast -- down 5.6% -- and the West,
where construction starts fell 11.9%.</TE>
<TE>   Although individual state data were not available, analysts said
it was unlikely that California contributed to that decline. And
separate data of home-building permits from the state show that
residential construction in California seems to be doing much better
than the rest of the West.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Meyers of Meyers Group, a real estate industry research firm,
said that Southern California in particular was holding up well. Many
urban areas of California continue to face a housing shortage, which
will continue to spur demand for construction. In terms of home sales
activity, Meyers said, "the best market in the country is the Inland
Empire."</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting another Southern California market where housing demand
has been strong, developer Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. on Tuesday
raised its projected net income for the year by about 8%. The company
said that was partly because it has sold a record 1,269 residential
lots in the Santa Clarita Valley this year.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still strong, deep-down, pent-up demand for housing in
California," said regional economist Steven Cochrane at Economy.com.
"There really is no housing shortage" in many other Western cities.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, analysts viewed the Western region's drop in construction
starts last month as a sign that builders are reacting to a
moderation in home prices and sales activity in once-booming states
such as Arizona, Colorado and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   For the nation as a whole, however, economists said the November
report shows that the housing industry continues to be strong.</TE>
<TE>   "It remains a positive for the economy," said Mary Daly, an
economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Home builders have remained upbeat even as the pace of
construction is projected to slow next year. The National Assn. of
Home Builders' housing market index, a measure of home builder
confidence, rose one point in December to 65 -- the highest level
since November 2000.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks pulled back Tuesday in the face of a profit warning from
McDonald's and more disappointing news about holiday retail sales.</LD>
<LD>   In other trading, oil prices closed unchanged, holding above $30 a
barrel.</LD>
<LD>   On Wall Street, the market early in the day extended Monday's
rally, but selling took its toll as the session progressed.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 193.69 points Monday,
slid 92.01 points, or 1.1%, to 8,535.39.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite eased 8.28 points, or 0.6%, to 1,392.05 after
gaining 37.91 points Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Despite some good news in government economic reports, the
McDonald's warning and downbeat retail sales estimates gave investors
more reason to be suspicious about the strength of the recovery,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's said tough competition would lead to its first
quarterly loss. Its stock tumbled $1.39 to $15.99.</TE>
<TE>   In the retail sector, Target dropped $2.05 to $29.75 after saying
sales so far this month are "well below" expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Some money managers believe that the market may tread water until
the U.S-Iraq situation plays out.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't have a roaring bull market, certainly not until the
Iraqi situation is resolved," said Phil Ferguson, a strategist at AIM
Capital Management Group in Houston. "When we know something like war
is imminent, it makes investors cautious."</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by 20 to 13 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by about the same margin on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks rallied sharply in late October and early November, but
profit taking has knocked prices back in the last two weeks. Buyers
returned Monday, powering a strong rally.</TE>
<TE>   Rising energy prices have weighed on investor sentiment over the
last week. On Tuesday, crude oil futures were unchanged in New York
at $30.10 a barrel, on speculation that the intensifying civil
conflict in Venezuela would continue to limit shipments from the
fifth-largest exporter.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez protested in
Caracas after the army threatened to end a strike by oil workers.
Marchers in the capital planned to shut down major highways and
streets.</TE>
<TE>   "Crude oil doesn't want to give up its recent gains because of the
strike in Venezuela," said Ed Silliere, vice president of risk
management at Energy Merchant in New York, which markets gasoline and
heating oil. "The situation in Venezuela is still grim, and there's
no resolution in sight."</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * In the retail sector, Home Depot lost $1.01 to $25.70, Kohl's
fell $1.86 to $59.24, Wal-Mart dropped $1 to 50.94, and Zale slid 93
cents to $34.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart sank 19 cents to 39 cents. The company said Monday that the
NYSE will delist its shares as of Thursday. The stock then will trade
in the over-the-counter Bulletin Board market.</TE>
<TE>   * Many restaurant stocks declined along with McDonald's.
Cheesecake Factory fell $1.08 to $34.93, Wendy's  dropped 75 cents to
$27.04, and Yum Brands eased 17 cents to $23.20.</TE>
<TE>   * Drug stocks fell after GlaxoSmithKline faced a new delay in
winning U.S. approval for its top-selling asthma drug.
GlaxoSmithKline's shares lost 89 cents to $36.91, Eli Lilly was off
89 cents to $63.96, and Bristol Myers lost 77 cents to $24.13.</TE>
<TE>   But some biotech shares advanced. Amgen added $1.11 to $51.62, and
Genentech rose 70 cents to $34.50.</TE>
<TE>   * The tech sector showed relative strength. Apple Computer gained
23 cents to $15.08, and PeopleSoft edged up 42 cents to $18.46.</TE>

<HD>McDonald's to Post Its First Quarterly Loss</HD>
<DH>The fast-food sector is saturated with restaurant chains
struggling to maintain their market share.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Deborah Cohen</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>McDonald's Corp. said Tuesday that it will post its first quarterly
loss after cutting jobs and closing outlets, as sales at the world's
largest restaurant deteriorated in the saturated U.S. fast-food
market.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of the hamburger maker fell $1.39, or 8%, to $15.99 on the
New York Stock Exchange. The stock was the most actively traded issue
on the NYSE, earlier touching $15.59, its lowest level in nearly
eight years.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. fast-food market has become increasingly competitive as
McDonald's, hamburger rivals Burger King Corp. and Wendy's
International Inc. and Taco Bell parent Yum Brands Inc. struggle to
maintain market share as consumer tastes change and other fast-food
options emerge, such as sandwich chain Panera Bread Co.</LD>
<TE>   McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., has been testing other
concepts, including pizza and Mexican-food chains, while Wendy's has
relied on its Canadian doughnut chain to help drive growth. Yum has
been pushing aggressively into overseas markets such as China.</TE>
<TE>   So far in the fourth quarter, McDonald's sales at stores open at
least 13 months are down 1.6% before the effects of foreign exchange,
the company said in an updated earnings outlook.</TE>
<TE>   Same-store sales in the United States, McDonald's largest market,
fell 1.3% in October and November and 1.5% through the first 11
months of the year, a sign that the company's new discounting
strategy is not meeting expectations, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that the discounting program is not working," said
Bear Stearns analyst Joe Buckley, referring to the "Dollar Menu"
McDonald's recently launched to drive up sales. "To improve service
is very important for them, I think that's kind of the short-term
key."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's, whose chief executive, Jack Greenberg, is retiring at
the end of the year, also indicated that quarterly sales are
worsening, with sales in December showing poorer trends than October
and November. The company has reported lower earnings in seven of the
last eight quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Incoming CEO Jim Cantalupo, former vice chairman and president, is
in the process of "aggressively reviewing" all aspects of the
restaurant company's operations with an eye on improving financial
performance.</TE>
<TE>   The review could result in fourth-quarter charges beyond the $390
million now earmarked for worldwide restructuring, McDonald's said.</TE>
<TE>   In November, McDonald's said it would close about 175 restaurants,
slash up to 600 corporate jobs and pull out of three countries in the
Middle East and Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   The actions signal a pullback for a company with some 30,000
worldwide restaurants that has been criticized for sacrificing
profits in favor of aggressive expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Including charges, McDonald's said it expects to post a
fourth-quarter loss of 5 cents to 6 cents a share, its first loss in
its 47-year history.</TE>
<TE>   Before items, the company said it will earn 25 cents or 26 cents a
share, short of analysts' expectations. Last year the company earned
21 cents a share, or 34 cents before items.</TE>

<HD>Mass., W. Virginia Ask Microsoft to Cover Fees</HD>
<DH>The two states seek $2.3million for legal expenses, but
they want to delay the request until their appeal is decided.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Massachusetts and West Virginia are seeking $2.3 million from
Microsoft Corp. to reimburse their legal expenses for joining the
U.S. government's antitrust suit against the world's largest software
maker.</LD>
<LD>   But the states asked U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly to
delay ruling on the request while they appeal her refusal last month
to impose tougher restrictions than Microsoft accepted in settling
the government's case.</LD>
<LD>   Under federal law, the winning side in a civil case is entitled to
seek reimbursement from the loser, and a judge may determine what are
fair and reasonable expenses.</LD>
<TE>   Shortly after the judge approved the antitrust settlement between
Microsoft and the Department of Justice, the company's top lawyer
approached the California attorney general's office with an offer to
pay the legal fees of the states that agreed not to appeal the
decision, according to people familiar with the conversations.
Microsoft also offered to provide an additional pot of funds for the
states to help enforce the settlement deal, the Washington Post
reported.</TE>
<TE>   After some deliberations, California -- which had agreed to bear
most of the states' legal costs to challenge the agreement -- decided
to accept the offer, along with six other states and the District of
Columbia. Last month, they announced that Microsoft would pay them a
total of $25 million in legal fees, plus $3.6 million for technical
experts and other resources to help enforce the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Under the settlement approved by Kollar-Kotelly, Microsoft must
give computer makers freedom to promote software programs that
compete with Internet Explorer, Windows Media Player and other
products made by the software leader.</TE>
<TE>   Only Massachusetts and West Virginia decided to appeal the judge's
ruling. Microsoft has vowed not only to fight their appeal, but to
challenge the amount the states contend they are entitled to recover
from the long-running litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Massachusetts and West Virginia each is a sovereign entity that
filed suit against Microsoft because of the harm to the citizens and
general economy of their states caused by Microsoft's
anti-competitive practices," the two states said.</TE>
<TE>   They requested reimbursement for 5,953 hours of lawyers' time.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares fell 12 cents to close at $54.36 in Nasdaq
trading Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>MTV's Playlist to Focus More on Popular Acts</HD>
<DH>Network says it altered programming after audience research
showed that viewers want to see top-tier artists more often.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MTV, the dominant purveyor of music videos, is planning once again to
shrink the number of clips on its network.</LD>
<LD>   The Viacom Inc.-owned cable channel -- which already has drifted
away from its trademark videos in favor of staged, unscripted shows
and other programming -- said it was trimming its playlist, while
focusing more heavily on top-tier stars. And the channel's
programmers say acts now must prove that they can generate a buzz
among fans before the channel will air their video clips in heavy
rotation.</LD>
<LD>   The move is the latest bump in the sometimes rocky relationship
between record labels and MTV. Labels, which spend tens of millions
of dollars to produce the mini-movies featuring their artists, once
viewed the cable channel as an extension of their own marketing
departments. Over time, however, MTV has evolved into an independent
force, wielding enormous clout over record executives.</LD>
<TE>   The network said it decided to tweak its video programming after
examining audience research that showed viewers want to see the
channel's biggest stars even more often. This week, for instance, the
change means more exposure for such acts as Avril Lavigne and Busta
Rhymes.</TE>
<TE>   "When our audience asks for something, we have to deliver it to
them," Tom Calderone, MTV's executive vice president for music and
talent programming, said Tuesday. "What we're trying to do is manage
the list a little better, so we're playing things at the right time"
in an act's development, he said.</TE>
<TE>   MTV plans to concentrate on a weekly list of 10 video clips, the
so-called Big 10, each of which will be played more than 30 times a
week -- in some cases doubling the exposure that videos in heavy
rotation had before. Other videos on the channel's playlist will get
at least 10 plays, or "spins," a week.</TE>
<TE>   To make room for the extra plays, the channel will play fewer
videos overall. The idea is to increase ratings by playing popular
videos, while allowing some room to introduce developing acts.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, programmers said they are seeking more evidence of an
act's popularity before its video can receive heavy rotation.
Calderone said he had begun examining artists' concert ticket sales
and Internet activity, for example.</TE>
<TE>   Record executives offer mixed reviews of the strategy shift.</TE>
<TE>   Some say that, for the clips chosen for MTV's "Big 10," the extra
video plays could provide a crucial push among music fans.</TE>
<TE>   But others say tightening the playlist suggests the channel is
abandoning its history as an outlet for developing bands just as
album sales are slumping by an estimated 11% this year and as the
industry is desperate for marketing support.</TE>
<TE>   "For MTV to limit our exposure like that is really bad," said one
label chief who has landed numerous hits on the channel this year.
"For a company that's really built its success on the back of the
record industry, it's ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Calderone insisted that he remains committed to using the
channel's influence to introduce new acts.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the channel included young rock band Good Charlotte
in its first Big 10 under the new policy.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't have baby bands and new bands on our channel, then we
have no future stars," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, MTV has reduced the number of total video plays by about
one-third over the last decade, according to Nielsen Broadcast Data
Systems, which monitors airplay. But MTV programmers and label
executives agree that big blocks of music videos don't draw the same
ratings they once did.</TE>
<TE>   MTV says it continues to market artists through such programs as
"Diary" and by playing videos during key hours.</TE>
<TE>   MTV executives say that serves record marketers better than
blanketing the channel with too many videos or relegating many of
them to low-rated spots in the middle of the night.</TE>
<TE>   Calderone said MTV moved to toughen its requirements for heavy
play on the channel because labels too often had pushed music videos
without any other plans to market their acts.</TE>
<TE>   "You just can't expect us to play a video four or five times [with
no other marketing] and all of a sudden the world comes running,"
Calderone said. "It just doesn't work that way."</TE>

<HD>Cumulus to Leave Liaison Off Payroll</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cumulus Media Inc., one of the nation's biggest radio chains, has
decided not to hire an independent record promoter as an employee,
company officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The move follows a report in The Times on Tuesday that
Atlanta-based Cumulus was considering adding the promoter to its
payroll as an in-house liaison to record labels. The idea troubled
some record executives, who said making the executive a full-time
employee would cross the line in the already controversial
relationship between labels and radio stations.</LD>
<LD>   Federal law prohibits broadcasters from accepting money in
exchange for airplay without disclosing such deals to listeners, a
practice called payola. Labels have sidestepped the law by paying
middlemen to push songs to programmers. These independent promoters
pay broadcasters annual fees that they say are not tied to airplay of
songs, but bill record labels for each song added to a station's
playlist.</LD>
<TE>   Label executives balked, however, at the idea of paying a Cumulus
employee directly each time a song was added. Cumulus executive John
Dickey said Tuesday that after the expiration of his chain's deal
with another promotion firm at year's end, he expected promoter John
Kilgo to establish his own independent business to pitch labels'
songs to Cumulus, instead of joining the firm's payroll.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sales at U.S. retailers such as Target Corp. were less than expected
last week as shoppers watched their wallets in what analysts expect
will be a lackluster holiday season.</LD>
<LD>   Sales at stores open at least a year gained 1.9% from the previous
week, when they fell after snow and ice storms kept shoppers from

Employers Re unit. It also will study whether to sell the

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. said its board was reviewing Chief Executive Michael
Eisner's participation in a 1999 initial public offering following a
shareholder complaint. Eisner purchased 30,000 shares of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. in the investment bank's IPO, and Disney said its
board, following routine corporate governance practices, had formed a
committee of independent directors to review the matter.</LD>
<LD>   The committee is expected to report back to the board in early
2003. Disney said that Eisner who has been a substantial private
client of Goldman Sachs for 10 years, participated in the offering at
the invitation of his personal banker, and he has not participated in
any other IPO.</LD>
<LD>   Disney is a corporate client of Goldman, which was co-lead manager
with Salomon Smith Barney of a $300-million global bond offering by
Disney on Monday.</LD>

<LD>FAO Inc., the owner of FAO Schwarz and Zany Brainy toy stores, said
it will file for bankruptcy protection if its lender doesn't relax

relax recently imposed conditions, the toy retailer said. Rapid
deterioration of its ability to get financing from alternative
sources prompted the request, the company said.</LD>

<HD>State Eases Fine for Deutsche</HD>
<DH>Regulators agree to cut potential penalty in half. The move
could help bring about a 'global' settlement of Wall Street
wrongdoing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>California regulators have backed off a demand that Deutsche Bank pay
a $100-million fine to resolve an investigation of stock analysts,
thus removing a potential stumbling block toward an industrywide
settlement of analyst conflicts.</LD>
<LD>   The state's top securities regulator, Demetrios A. Boutris, agreed
Tuesday to cut his settlement demand in half to $50 million, putting
California more in line with the positions of other states, according
to a source familiar with the matter. Boutris changed his stance
after New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer lobbied him during a phone
call Tuesday morning, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Boutris drew attention late last month when he publicly broke
ranks with other regulators over the size of fines that firms should
pay. He contended that each of the 12 firms should pay a minimum of
$100 million. That was far more than his fellow regulators were
seeking from some firms.</LD>
<TE>   Realizing it lacked support, California recently indicated that it
would sign off on lower penalties for firms other than Deutsche.</TE>
<TE>   It held fast on seeking a bigger penalty against the German
banking firm because California had headed up the probe of the
company and maintained that its conduct warranted the larger fine.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear whether Deutsche would agree even to a fine of $50
million. The firm has offered to pay only $15 million, a source said.
It also is uncertain whether California would accept a lower amount.</TE>
<TE>   Boutris did not return a phone call Tuesday seeking comment. A
Deutsche spokeswoman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   But California's reduced demand could help pave the way for a
so-called global settlement of Wall Street wrongdoing in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal regulators have been negotiating with a dozen
Wall Street firms to end a series of government investigations into
conflicts of interest involving stock analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Some firms, such as Citigroup and Credit Suisse First Boston, have
signaled their willingness to conclude a deal and pay the current
fines asked of them. Citigroup is near a deal to pay $350 million,
and CSFB would shell out $150 million.</TE>
<TE>   However, about half a dozen companies, including Deutsche, UBS
Warburg and Lehman Bros. Holdings, have protested the $50-million
penalties that regulators have sought from each of them in recent
days.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations have been complicated by California's insistence
that Deutsche pay a bigger fine, and the state threatened to withhold
its assent to any deal in which the firm was fined less than $100
million.</TE>
<TE>   California pressed its position with other state regulators during
a conference Monday. But other regulators balked and argued that the
evidence against Deutsche is no worse than against firms from which
regulators are seeking $50-million payments, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   California has mulled over the idea of hiring an outside law firm
to help with its Deutsche investigation but has taken no action in
that direction, a source said.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators held a series of intensive meetings with individual
firms last week and have had follow-up conversations with the
recalcitrant firms this week.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting closer with a number of firms, but others are
farther apart," one regulator said.</TE>
<TE>   The main objection from the firms is not about specific penalty
amounts, another regulator said. Rather, they are concerned with how
they would appear relative to their competitors.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't really care if it's $40 million or $50 million or $60
million," the regulator said. "But it's, 'I don't want to pay more
than [a rival firm]. I'm not worse than them."</TE>
<TE>   Along with fines, the Wall Street companies also would agree to a
series of reforms. One of the biggest is that the firms would
distribute independent research reports to their customers, in
addition to reports prepared by the firms' own analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators and the firms are close to a final agreement on how
that would work. But they have not yet agreed to the specifics.</TE>

<HD>Panel Suggests Perjury by Andersen's Counsel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arthur Andersen's former in-house counsel, Nancy Temple, should be
investigated for lying to a U.S. House committee, members of the
congressional panel said in a letter to Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft on
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The House Energy and Commerce Committee, headed by Rep. W.J.
(Billy) Tauzin (R-La.), suggested Temple committed perjury when she
testified before the panel in January. Temple may have lied by
denying that an Oct. 12, 2001, e-mail to Andersen auditors on
retaining Enron Corp. documents was a veiled order to destroy the
material, the committee said.</LD>
<LD>   "Ms. Temple sought to cloak her Oct. 12 e-mail in a false light of
innocence, while concealing from the subcommittee similar efforts on
her part to encourage the destruction of Enron-related documents by
Andersen personnel," Tauzin wrote in the letter.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen, once the world's fifth-largest audit firm, imploded
after U.S. regulators investigated its oversight of debt-hiding
partnerships that led to Enron's bankruptcy filing. Andersen
employees began shredding Enron documents after Temple sent the
e-mail reminder about the firm's policy for retaining material.
Andersen was convicted of obstructing justice in June.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department will review the committee's information, a
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   When Temple testified before the House committee in January, she
said the Oct. 12 e-mail was a response to questions from Andersen
employees about how to properly document accounting issues.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Hansen, Temple's lawyer, couldn't be reached for comment
Tuesday. Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton declined to comment.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS to Study Tenet Claims Data</HD>
<DH>Pension fund questions whether medical costs have risen
excessively at the company's hospitals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CalPERS, the nation's second-largest purchaser of health insurance,
said Tuesday that it planned to analyze claims data from patients of
Tenet Healthcare Corp.'s hospitals in California to determine whether
medical costs have risen excessively.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Employees' Retirement System, which provides
retirement and health benefit services to more than 1.3 million
members and nearly 2,500 employers, has asked its health plan
administrator, Blue Cross of California, to provide claims data for
the last five years. The pension fund also requested information on
quality of care at each of Tenet's 40 hospitals in California.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet, the nation's second-largest hospital chain, already faces a
Medicare audit from federal regulators and an investigation of the
company's billing practices by California law- makers. In addition,
federal officials are investigating whether two heart doctors
performed numerous unnecessary surgeries at Tenet's Redding Medical
Center.</LD>
<TE>   CalPERS spokesman Clark McKinley said the analysis was expected to
begin in mid-January. It is premature to talk about what actions the
pension fund may take upon completing the review, he said.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS' scrutiny of Tenet was prodded in part by the Service
Employees International Union, which has been organizing at some of
Tenet's hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   In a Dec. 9 letter requesting the data from Blue Cross, Nancy J.
Welsh, chief of CalPERS' Self-Funded Programs Division, made special
reference to several Tenet hospitals that have received large
payments for complicated medical cases. The letter, released Tuesday,
mentioned Tenet hospitals in Modesto and San Luis Obispo and Garfield
Medical Center in Monterey Park.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet spokesman Harry Anderson said the Santa Barbara-based
company was cooperating with CalPERS and Blue Cross. Michael Chee, a
spokesman for Blue Cross, said it was not unusual for self-insured
customers to request such claims data.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS said it had asked Blue Cross for advice on whether
payments or referrals to Redding Medical Center and the two doctors
under investigation should be suspended. Chee said, "That's going to
be a CalPERS decision. It's their money."</TE>

<HD>Tyco Ex-Director Settles Fraud Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeanne King</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Tyco International Ltd. lead director Frank Walsh whipped out
a checkbook in court Tuesday and paid more than $22 million to settle
charges that he defrauded Tyco when it bought CIT Group Inc. last
year.</LD>
<LD>   Walsh, who resigned from Tyco's board this year, pleaded guilty to
charges that he failed to disclose to other board members that he
would be paid a $20-million finder's fee for Tyco's $9.5-billion CIT
acquisition.</LD>
<LD>   Walsh will not serve jail time in a case brought against him by
prosecutors in New York.</LD>
<TE>   Walsh also settled a securities fraud claim filed against him by
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Without admitting or denying
the charges, Walsh agreed to restitution and will be permanently
barred from acting as an officer or director of a publicly held
company.</TE>
<TE>   "His duty was to protect shareholders," said Thomas Newkirk,
associate enforcement director at the SEC. "Instead, Mr. Walsh
himself took secret compensation and kept those same shareholders in
the dark."</TE>
<TE>   For Tyco, the CIT deal turned into a debacle. Tyco sold CIT this
year for less than half of what it paid and took a charge of more
than $6 billion against earnings.</TE>
<TE>   The guilty plea by Walsh marks one of the first times in recent
memory that prosecutors have secured a criminal conviction against a
corporate board member.</TE>
<TE>   After Tyco disclosed the payment to Walsh in January, investors
stampeded to sell the company's stock, erasing more than $16 billion
in shareholder value in one day of trading. Walsh was the head of
Tyco's corporate governance committee at the time, and walked out of
a board meeting when other directors demanded that he return the
money, according to Tyco filings.</TE>
<TE>   The internal dispute at Tyco did not become public until after
former Tyco Chairman Dennis Kozlowski abruptly resigned in June.
Walsh allegedly worked out the fee deal with Kozlowski, according to
the criminal complaint filed by the Manhattan district attorney's
office.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski and former Tyco finance chief Mark Swartz have pleaded
not guilty to charges that they stole more than $170 million from
Tyco and obtained an additional $430 million through fraudulent stock
sales.</TE>
<TE>   At an arraignment in Manhattan Supreme Court, Walsh said he
received $10 million directly and $10 million was donated to the
Community Foundation of New Jersey, a charity he recommended. The
charity will keep the $10 million because Walsh is repaying the
$20-million fee out of his own pocket, according to a statement by
Walsh.</TE>
<TE>   State Supreme Court Judge Michael Odus sentenced Walsh to a
conditional discharge, provided that he repay the $20 million to
Tyco, pay $2.5 million in fines to New York City and state and an
additional $250,000 in fines to prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh wrote the checks on the spot.</TE>

<HD>PaineWebber Ex-Employee Charged With Fraud</HD>
<DH>Firm's former systems administrator is accused of trying
to sabotage its computer network.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors Tuesday charged a disgruntled former employee of
UBS PaineWebber with fraud and accused him of trying to sabotage the
brokerage's computer network with an electronic "logic bomb."</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department's New Jersey district accused Roger
Duronio, 60, of planting the logic bomb in about 1,000 of
PaineWebber's 1,500 networked computers.</LD>
<LD>   So-called logic bombs are pieces of software code buried within
another program that are designed to disrupt computer systems. They
are often delivered by e-mail.</LD>
<TE>   Duronio, a computer systems administrator, resigned Feb. 22 from
PaineWebber after complaining about his salary and bonuses. The logic
bomb he allegedly constructed from November 2001 until February of
this year was activated March 4, U.S. Atty. Christopher Christie said
in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Duronio could not immediately be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Duronio attempted to profit from planting
the logic bomb by betting that the stock of UBS, PaineWebber's parent
company, would fall.</TE>
<TE>   He allegedly bought more than $21,000 of put options, which grants
an investor the right to sell a certain amount of underlying stock at
a certain price. Put options increase in value when the stock price
declines.</TE>
<TE>   UBS' New York-traded shares fell 72 cents to $49.82 on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Duronio is charged with securities fraud and one count of
computer-related fraud. The charges carry combined maximum sentences
of 20 years in prison and fines of more than $1.25 million.</TE>
<TE>   Duronio's logic bomb, the government charged, deleted files and
led to $3 million in costs for PaineWebber to assess and repair the
damage.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mutual fund company Neuberger Berman Inc. has hired fund manager Jon
Brorson and three others from larger rival money management firm
Northern Trust Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Neuberger acquired the growth stock fund team after cutting 2% of
its workforce last quarter.</LD>
<LD>   This month, Neuberger said it would buy the U.S. arbitrage
division of Credit Agricole Group for an undisclosed sum.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Neuberger gained 67 cents to $33.65 on the New York
Stock Exchange. They have declined 23% this year. The New York-based
firm had $53.6 billion in assets under management at the end of
September.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Chicago-based Northern Trust, which have dropped 39%
this year, fell 32 cents to $36.52 on Nasdaq. It manages $293
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Northern Trust's $640-million Growth Equity Fund, previously
managed by the team that included Brorson, has lost 21% so far this
year, better than 62% of similar funds. In the last five years, the
fund has gained an average of 0.4% a year, outpacing 64% of similar
funds, according to Bloomberg data.</TE>
<TE>   Northern Trust said John Leo, a senior investment manager, will
take Brorson's place at the head of the growth team.</TE>

<HD>Belanger Masters This Trick</HD>
<DH>Forward records his first three-goal game and Potvin stops
34 shots in Kings' 6-2 victory over St. Louis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was rookie night for the Kings on Tuesday against the St. Louis
Blues, but it was a group of veterans who stole the show at Staples
Center.</LD>
<LD>   In a 6-2 victory in front of 15,662, Eric Belanger scored three
goals for his first NHL hat trick, Bryan Smolinski, Jaroslav Modry
and Ziggy Palffy each scored one and Felix Potvin stopped 34 shots as
the Kings won for the fourth time in five games.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Allison had three assists, Modry and Ian Laperriere two
each.</LD>
<TE>   "If you call me a veteran, I'll take it," said Belanger, a
third-year pro who last enjoyed a multi-goal game Jan. 5. "We had to
get some shots tonight, and we did. This was a big win for our team.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just an effort from everybody. We have to pull in the same
direction. Tonight it was me; maybe the next game it will be somebody
else."</TE>
<TE>   Because of injuries and illness, the King lineup included four
rookies: defenseman Joe Corvo, 25, and 20-year-old forwards Michael
Cammalleri, Alexander Frolov and Jared Aulin, the last making his NHL
debut.</TE>
<TE>   "We hoped they would all play here during the season," Coach Andy
Murray said before the game. "We wanted to see them play here, but
the fact that they're all here now....</TE>
<TE>   "Our team doesn't resemble much of what we had here last year."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the Kings lost at St. Louis in overtime, 3-2, after
hitting the wall in the third period of the last game of an
eight-game, 17-day trip. The Blues that night outshot the Kings,
23-3, in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought they abused us in the third period," Murray said. "Our
goaltending [by Potvin] was outstanding, but they took advantage of
the fact that our wheels had just about fallen off. They're also a
good team."</TE>
<TE>   The Blues have experienced their own share of injuries -- recently
returned Brent Johnson, torched Tuesday by the Kings, is the sixth
goaltender they've utilized -- but a 9-1-1 start put them in the
thick of the Central Division race.</TE>
<TE>   They're 7-8-3-2 since, however, and they fell behind the Kings in
the 16th minute, Modry scoring the first of three power-play goals by
the Kings on a shot from the high slot with Christian Laflamme in the
penalty box for cross-checking Eric Rasmussen. His ninth goal tied
Modry for the NHL lead among defensemen.</TE>
<TE>   About two minutes later, with Brad Chartrand in the penalty box
for holding Martin Rucinsky, Keith Tkachuk tied the score with a
power-play goal, redirecting a blast from the right faceoff circle by
defenseman Al MacInnis.</TE>
<TE>   Belanger's first goal gave the Kings the lead for good 32 seconds
into the second period, and Smolinski made the score 3-1 at 6:11.</TE>
<TE>   Belanger, who scored his third goal into an empty net, scored his
first on a brilliant bit of marksmanship. From the bottom of the
right circle, he found a tiny opening in the upper right corner of
the goal mouth and flipped the puck off Johnson's right shoulder and
across the goaltender's back into the net.</TE>
<TE>   At 17:58 of the second period, Belanger scored again, this time on
a rebound of a shot by Allison. His eighth goal matched his total
from last season.</TE>
<TE>   He scored his ninth on a 150-foot shot with 2:30 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a player who is taking a lot of weight upon himself,"
Belanger said, "and I want to play hard every night. When things are
not going good, you have to look in the mirror and say, 'Can I play
better? Can I play harder?' "</TE>

<HD>UC Santa Barbara Surprises Purdue</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Mike Terry</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since knocking off Louisiana Tech in last season's NCAA tournament,
UC Santa Barbara has looked for another chance to grab some national
spotlight.</LD>
<LD>   The Gauchos found it Tuesday by stunning sixth-ranked Purdue in
overtime, 83-82, before 2,683 at the Thunderdome.</LD>
<LD>   Lindsay Taylor, with 16 of her 22 points in the second half, was
one of four Santa Barbara players in double figures. The Gauchos
(4-1) also profited from 22 points by Jess Hansen, a career-best 18
points by Lisa Willett, and 13 points and 12 rebounds from Brandy
Richardson.</LD>
<TE>   "We had been working hard in practice on establishing an inside
game and the team was really looking for me," said Taylor, who added
11 rebounds and was 10 of 11 on free throws.</TE>
<TE>   It looked as if the Gauchos, who led, 62-52, with 7:25 left in the
second half and, 72-67, with 36 seconds to play, would pull off the
upset in regulation. But the two-time defending Big 10 champion
Boilermakers tied the game at 73 when forward Lindsey Hicks banked in
a three-point shot with four-tenths of a second left.</TE>
<TE>   Purdue (7-1) had one last chance to force a second overtime, but
Emily Heikes missed the second of two free throws with 1.5 seconds
left.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first regular-season defeat for Purdue to an unranked
nonconference opponent since losing to Stanford, 73-72, on Nov. 21,
1998 -- a stretch of 33 games.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara began the season ranked 25th, but fell out of the
poll with a loss to Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   "Being that we were a ranked team and we had beaten them twice in
our building, we had to figure [Santa Barbara] would be ready to play
tonight," said Shreka Wright, who led Purdue with 26 points. "And
they were ready the whole game."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara also played without leading scorer Kristen Mann,
sidelined because of a hairline fracture in her left wrist.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mike Terry</TE>
<TE>   No. 9 Texas Tech 67, Oregon State 51 -- Plenette Pierson scored 19
points as the Raiders (5-1) held the Beavers (5-3) scoreless for
nearly five minutes in each half at Lubbock, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   No. 13 North Carolina 83, Elon 50 -- La'Tangela Atkinson had 16
points as the Tar Heels (7-1) had a 15-0 run in the second half of a
victory over the Phoenix (2-3) at Chapel Hill, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   No. 20 Georgia 64, Michigan State 61 --Sherill Baker sank two free
throws with 2.5 seconds left to lead the Bulldogs (6-2) past the
Spartans (4-4) at Athens, Ga.</TE>

<HD>Jenner Has Dope Sheet on Status of Olympics</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Shav Glick</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bruce Jenner, former Olympic decathlon champion, believes that
concern about doping is the Achilles' heel of the Olympic Games.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking on "Best Damn Sports Show Period," he said, "They are
doing the right thing to try to control doping in the Olympics. We
are the only sports organization in the world that seriously tests
athletes and all we get out of it is a black eye. That is the big
media issue.</LD>
<LD>   "You have 10,000 athletes there and two or three get caught, but
that two or three are the ones who get all the media attention."</LD>
<TE>   More Jenner: Known as the "World's Greatest Athlete" after setting
a world record in 1976, he said, "The title that goes along with it
does not help your golf game. Being the world's greatest athlete just
does not get it done on the golf course."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: UCLA plays New Mexico on Christmas Day in the Las
Vegas Bowl. What do coaches Ed Kezirian of the Bruins and Rocky Long
of the Lobos have in common?</TE>
<TE>   Happy days: Miami Dolphin defensive standout Jason Taylor has his
reasons for praising teammate running back Ricky Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "We are able to sit around so much now," he said. "In years past,
we were not used to that. We get to sit around and watch him run up
and down the field and eat up the clock."</TE>
<TE>   Social note: Anna Smashnova, who has one of tennis' most
descriptive names, will start the new year with a new one.</TE>
<TE>   According to www.tennisweek.com, the 16th-ranked player has
married her coach, Italian Claudio Pistolesi, and will be known as
Anna Pistolesi when the 2003 WTA rankings are announced.</TE>
<TE>   That's our Roger: "Roger Clemens has only one request if the
Yankees trade him," writes Alan Ray in the San Francisco Chronicle.
"He wants to end his career throwing at American League batters."</TE>
<TE>   That hurts: Here's a joke making the rounds in Phoenix about Jake
Plummer, the beleaguered Cardinal quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Question: "How do you keep Jake Plummer out of your backyard?"</TE>
<TE>   Answer: "Put a goal line around it."</TE>
<TE>   Odd(s) reasoning: Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post thought
Miami's Ken Dorsey should have won the Heisman Trophy. He wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "Dorsey is 38-1 in his career as a starter. Nobody has those kinds
of numbers. That's a higher percentage than Saddam Hussein has in
'elections.' "</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Both played in the short-lived World Football
League.</TE>
<TE>   Kezirian was an offensive lineman for the Southern California Sun
and Long was a safety for the Detroit Wheels.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Otto Graham, who quarterbacked the Cleveland Browns
to seven championships in 10 years, is 80 now and lives on a golf
course in Sarasota, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   But he had to give up the game because of arthritis in his hands.</TE>
<TE>   He told Charean Williams of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that he
quit when his wife Bev started beating him.</TE>
<TE>   "Now she plays golf to get away from me," he said.</TE>

<LD>The spin moves near the basket seemed vaguely familiar, as did the
net-snapping shots launched from behind the three-point arc.</LD>
<LD>   Quentin Richardson certainly looked like his old self while
scoring a season-best 21 points (on six-for-eight shooting) during
the Clippers' 91-79 victory Monday over the San Antonio Spurs.</LD>
<LD>   Two sore knees set him back to start the season, but now
Richardson has regained the explosiveness he needs to take other
shooting guards to the basket and to score over them from the
perimeter.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew it was, basically, going to be a matter of time," said
Richardson, who injured his right knee during training camp and
missed all but one of the eight exhibitions, then banged his left
knee not long after the regular season began.</TE>
<TE>   "After a while, I was thinking it would pass and go away. But I
couldn't do the things I normally do. I didn't think it would be
possible to affect my game, but it did. I'm still not 100%. The right
one is, but not the left one."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eric Piatkowski will not play tonight against the Portland Trail
Blazers, sitting out his fourth game because of a lower abdominal
strain.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those day-to-day things," said Coach Alvin Gentry,
who will replace Piatkowski with Marko Jaric as the starting shooting
guard. "I don't know how serious it is. When the pain goes away, he
can play. That's pretty much it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have won five of their last seven games. They will
play 10 of their next 14 games at Staples Center, where they are 6-7
this season.</TE>
<TE>   "All in all, I think we've played well on the road," Gentry said,
referring to the 5-7 road record. "What we have to do now is play
well at Staples."</TE>

<TE>   Update -- The Trail Blazers defeated the New Orleans Hornets on
Tuesday, a day after Scottie Pippen had told the Chicago Tribune the
continued shuffling of players proves the team "doesn't want to win."
Pippen also said the team lacks chemistry because it has such an
overstocked roster. "How do you think guys respond when you pay them
that kind of money?" he said. "They think they've got to go out and
do something to earn their money. They've got to score. That kills
chemistry."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Second String"</LD>
<TE>   Where: TNT, tonight, 8 and 10</TE>
<TE>   In this fictional two-hour movie, the Buffalo Bills, coming off a
great season, are playing the San Diego Chargers in the first round
of the playoffs. Buffalo Coach Dichter, played by Jon Voight, decides
he needs a strong-armed fourth-string quarterback for the regulars to
beat up on in practice.</TE>
<TE>   The Bills' general manager signs Dan Heller, who was a star at
Notre Dame but a failure in the NFL, where he played for Dichter.
Heller, played by Gil Bellows ("Ally McBeal"), is a struggling
insurance salesman.</TE>
<TE>   The Bills' starting offense, all three quarterbacks and the team's
kicker are taken out to dinner, eat some bad oysters and get a rare
form of food poisoning that sidelines them for a month.</TE>
<TE>   Heller is suddenly the starting quarterback, surrounded by second
stringers, hence the title. You can see where this is going. Yes, the
story is corny and unrealistic. And the script, originally written by
Tom Flynn when the Rams were still in Los Angeles, remains a little
outdated.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Flutie, the real Doug Flutie, is the Bills' starting
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   However, the movie is entertaining, much in the same way "Bad News
Bears" and the original "Rocky" were entertaining. People love
underdogs. And there are enough plot twists in "Second String" to
make it somewhat unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   Voight, who played Howard Cosell in the "Ali" movie, was a guest
last week on Charles Barkley's "Listen Up" program on TNT. Voight was
asked what attracted him to "Second String."</TE>
<TE>   "The movie is fun," he said. "It's a story about a guy who was a
hard-headed coach who was out of line and had to face one of his
athletes telling him he was no good, and had to go through that and
change."</TE>
<TE>   Voight was referring to a halftime scene in which Coach Dichter
and Heller unload on each other. It's a turning point in the movie,
which is well acted, well written and, as Voight says, just plain
fun.</TE>

<HD>Deadline to Sign Floyd Draws Near</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the Dodgers mull options for adding punch to their offense, the
window to sign one of their top targets, free-agent outfielder Cliff
Floyd, is rapidly closing.</LD>
<LD>   Cliff Floyd Sr., the father of the slugger, said Tuesday that if
the Dodgers don't sign Floyd before Thursday, his son will accept an
arbitration offer from the Boston Red Sox.</LD>
<LD>   Dodger General Manager Dan Evans and Floyd's agent, Seth Levinson,
have explored creative ways for the Dodgers to fit Floyd, 30, in
their budget without surpassing the new $117-million luxury tax
threshold.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers have about $4.5 million to spend on a hitter and,
possibly, a left-handed reliever, and Floyd, who would move to first
base if he signs with Los Angeles, is believed to be seeking a
multiyear contract in the $8-million-a-year range.</TE>
<TE>   Evans, who is also negotiating with free-agent first baseman Fred
McGriff, would need to move more payroll to accommodate Floyd, and he
has explored trades involving pitcher Andy Ashby, who will make $8
million next season.</TE>
<TE>   But there has been minimal interest in Ashby, and those willing to
discuss the veteran right-hander have asked the Dodgers to eat as
much as half of Ashby's contract, hardly an appetizing proposition
for Evans.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are also hesitant to trade Ashby because he provides
some rotation protection should injury-plagued starters Kevin Brown
and Darren Dreifort hit snags again next season.</TE>
<TE>   Evans has also explored trades involving infielder Alex Cora and
reliever Giovanni Carrara, arbitration-eligible players who could
command about $2.5 million combined in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   But Cora can't be easily discarded. He hit .291 with 28 runs
batted in in 258 at-bats last season, providing an attractive
alternative to slumping shortstop Cesar Izturis and better defense
than Mark Grudzielanek at second. Cora could win the second base job
outright or platoon with rookie Joe Thurston in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   While Floyd, who hit .288 with 28 home runs and 79 RBIs last
season with the Florida Marlins, Montreal Expos and Red Sox, and
McGriff, who hit .273 with 30 homers and 103 RBIs for the Chicago
Cubs, remain atop the Dodgers' list, Evans is also exploring a trade
for another outfielder. That deal, if consummated, would push Shawn
Green from right field to first base.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have inquired about Pittsburgh left fielder Brian
Giles, but the Pirates seem reluctant to part with him.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't got to the point where we're isolated on one guy yet,"
Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   McGriff, 39, is an attractive option because he's a proven
runproducer who is willing to sign a one-year deal for a salary
probably in the $5-million range, and the Dodgers would not lose a
first-round draft pick if they sign him. Signing Floyd would cost the
Dodgers that pick.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest factor is how a guy fits into our payroll structure,"
Evans said. "But we're also looking at position, age, whether he's a
true middle-of-the-lineup bat, whether he'd cost us a draft pick,
whether we'd have to move another guy to accommodate him. It's
important before we make a move to think it through, because we're
not going to get a second chance."</TE>

<HD>Carney's Rating, Star Power Go Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Players are suddenly in demand for television appearances and there
are unfamiliar reporters and camera crews in their locker room, so
apparently the Mighty Ducks are starting to command respect.</LD>
<LD>   And with every point they earn, an underrated player such as
defenseman Keith Carney gets the type of exposure he has been lacking
playing for the Ducks, who play St. Louis tonight at Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<LD>   "Having more success helps," said Carney, who has 14 points in
what has been an All-Star season for him. "When you're playing well,
you seem to always get fortunate bounces."</LD>
<TE>   What's surprising about Carney is that he's regarded as a
stay-at-home defenseman but he still generates offense. In his 91
games with the Ducks, Carney has a plus-23 rating even though he
doesn't get many power-play minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Keith Carney is the leader back there," Coach Mike Babcock said.
"He plays the minutes, he plays the key situations, he plays against
the No. 1 units. He has 14 points and he plays totally in defensive
situations.... He's an All-Star back there for sure."</TE>
<TE>   Carney an All-Star? That would be a first because despite having a
plus-69 rating over his last 357 games since 1999, Carney has never
been selected for the All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   "For that type of honor, you look at offensive guys and players
who can put up numbers," Carney said.</TE>
<TE>   Carney certainly has helped his cause this season, being the top
scoring defenseman on the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not doing anything different out there," said Carney, who's
closing in on his career-high of 24 points set in 1999-2000 with
Phoenix. "Bounces are just going my way more than before and your
numbers are going to go up when a team is winning."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Ruslan Salei, who has sat out seven of the last eight
games because of a back strain, will not play tonight but could
return for Thursday's game against the Kings at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Team is playing so well, they don't want me out there yet," Salei
joked after Tuesday's practice. "They told me that I should take my
time."</TE>
<TE>   Salei has been working out with his teammates this week, but the
Ducks are giving him more time to heal, considering that he tried to
return a week ago at Detroit, only to be sidelined again.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm almost ready but not quite there yet," Salei said. "When I
came back before, there was a little pain and I just figured that
everyone plays with pain. But with my injury, I couldn't do that
because I can aggravate it trying to play through the pain. We're
waiting until I'm almost 100%."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left wing Mike Brown, who has played in six games with the Ducks
this season, cleared waivers and was assigned to Cincinnati of the
American Hockey League.</TE>

in 200 minutes and 15 seconds, which is the longest shutout streak in
the NHL since John Vanbeisbrouck went 218:42 from Jan. 3, 1999, to
Jan. 16, 1999, with Philadelphia.</TE>

<HD>NCWO Starts Web Site to Pressure Augusta</HD>

<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In its latest attempt to increase pressure on Augusta National Golf
Club, the National Council of Women's Organizations unveiled a Web
site Tuesday that will list the corporate chief executives who are
members.</LD>
<LD>   "This will draw the public's attention, in a stark way, to the
disparity in these guys' policies," Martha Burk, president of the
women's group, said of the site, www.augustadiscriminates.org. "Here
we have guys who essentially run the world, who purport to value
women as employees and customers, but now we learn what they practice
privately."</LD>
<LD>   The site had yet to post the chief executives under a headline
reading, "National Council of Women's Organization's Hall of
Hypocrisy," on Tuesday. Member lists have been published previously
by national news outlets, but Burk said the NCWO site would attach
company policy statements on diversity near the appropriate chief
executives' names.</LD>
<TE>   "It's all about exclusion," she said. "This is corporate social
abuse. These corporations market to women, they take their dollars.
We're saying, 'Show them what you really think, guys.' "</TE>
<TE>   There are also several alternate Web sites, among them
www.petitiononline.com/augusta/petition.html, which allows those
opposing Burk's campaign to petition her to stop.</TE>

<HD>If Shoe Deal Fits, Otis Will Wear It</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Image isn't everything in Southern California high school basketball
-- it's the only thing.</LD>
<LD>   The logo that adorns a team's jersey and sneakers has become more
important to many players than the pride that comes from playing for
a particular coach or a hometown team.</LD>
<LD>   Russell Otis learned that much during his first tenure as Compton
Dominguez coach, when he parlayed a long-running affiliation with
sports apparel giant Nike -- and the accompanying parade of transfers
-- into four state titles.</LD>
<TE>   Now that Otis is back at Dominguez after a two-season absence, one
of his first orders of business figures to be securing another
sponsorship deal. His friendship with Nike consultant George Raveling
certainly won't hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "With George Raveling at Nike, that would be our first choice,"
Otis said. "But we're open to whatever. If Nike decides they don't
want to, I'm sure there are other shoe companies that wouldn't mind
sponsoring [us]."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Oberman, communications manager for Nike Basketball, said the
company could not re-establish its ties with Otis until after this
season. The company re-evaluates its relationships with high school
programs during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   "As of right now, he is not with us," Oberman said. "That's not to
say we will sign him or we won't."</TE>
<TE>   Nike severed its nearly seven-year affiliation with Otis, which
included a lucrative personal contract that reportedly paid him up to
$15,000 a year, when the coach was fired in February 2001 for what a
Compton Unified School District official said was his failure to
obtain a permanent teaching credential.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Otis was ensnarled in a sexual molestation case
brought by a former player. He was acquitted of all charges.</TE>
<TE>   On his return to campus last week, Otis found a Dominguez roster
so depleted of talent that he held open tryouts. The Dons (2-2) might
not be ready to return to the Nike-funded national travel schedule,
but observers say it's too early to rule out a quick return to
prominence.</TE>
<TE>   "Russell built that program into a national power," said Downey
Coach Larry Shelton, who has been with the Dons' San Gabriel Valley
League rival since 1988, a year after Otis' arrival at Dominguez.
"I'm sure he is going to bring them great success again, and he'll do
it in a hurry."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kahraman brothers made a big splash for Los Alamitos during
the season's opening week, when Jon Kahraman was named most valuable
player of the Buena Park tournament and Adam was selected top player
of the junior varsity Garden Grove tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Jon is a 6-foot-2 senior swingman who has averaged 20 points and
eight rebounds during the Griffins' last five games; Adam is a 6-0
sophomore swingman who scored 23 points against Esperanza in the
Garden Grove finale.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers, both honors students, are expected to be varsity
teammates if Los Alamitos (5-1) makes the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Jordan is only 2-3, but the Panthers deserve credit for
playing an early-season schedule that has included four teams in The
Times' rankings. Jordan beat ranked Redondo, 64-63, but has dropped
games against L.A. Fairfax, Long Beach Poly and L.A. Fremont....
Eight ranked teams, led by No. 3 L.A. Westchester, play this week in
the Las Vegas Holiday Prep Classic, one of the premier holiday
tournaments in the country. Top-ranked Santa Ana Mater Dei competes
against a national field at the City of Palms Classic in Fort Myers,
Fla.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Third-seeded Christine Dao of Granada Hills High, who wasn't even on
the Highlander girls' tennis team at the start of the season, put
herself in position to win the City Section singles championship with
a 2-6, 7-5, 6-2 upset of No. 2-seeded and defending champion Judith
De Vera of Carson in the semifinals Tuesday at Balboa Sports Complex
in Encino.</LD>
<LD>   Dao will play top-seeded Dianne Matias of Carson in the title
match today at 2 p.m. at the same site. Matias defeated Granada
Hills' No. 4-seeded Canna Furuta, 6-4, 6-2, in the other semifinal.</LD>
<LD>   Dao, a junior who had played varsity tennis the last two seasons
but planned to sit out this year to concentrate on private workouts
and U.S. Tennis Assn. junior competition, decided to return to the
high school team at midseason.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, Dao has made the most of her return, leading the
Highlanders to the City Section team championship with a 4-3 victory
over Carson last month and advancing to her first singles final.</TE>
<TE>   De Vera, who was trying to advance to her third final in a row,
had a match point at 5-3 in the second set. But she hit it long and
Dao won the next four games to force a third set.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little surprised at today, to be honest," Dao said. "I
wasn't playing that well at first, and then when I came back in the
second set, that did it. Everything started clicking."</TE>
<TE>   In doubles, the two top-seeded teams advanced to the final. The
No. 1 team, Jasmine Reed and Madison Sellers of Palisades, cruised
past Westchester's Becky Bort-Mills and Charilyn Watkins, 6-1, 6-1,
and Granada Hills' Tracey Takeshita and Maria Cardenas eliminated
teammates Jessica Linder and Roxanne Plata, 6-4, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   -- Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   The Walnut girls' basketball team will forfeit its 54-24 victory
over Claremont on Friday in the championship game of the Claremont
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The Mustangs used an ineligible player, Antonia Caffey, who had
been ejected from the tournament semifinal in the closing seconds for
fighting with La Verne Bonita's Nikki Miyashita. According to
Southern Section rules, a player ejected from a game must sit out the
next two contests.</TE>
<TE>   Walnut Coach Carmen Caffey, Antonia's mother, said she was unaware
her daughter had been ejected, only that she had been given a

<HD>Hale Is Large Part of Reign at Wilson</HD>
<DH>Player of the year leads Long Beach school to undefeated
season and another water polo title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Arritt</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thomas Hale pumped his fist just as the sound of the ball hitting the
back of the goal echoed throughout the crowded arena.</LD>
<LD>   The Long Beach Wilson boys' water polo team was minutes away from
its second consecutive Southern Section Division I title, and Hale
was caught in a rare moment of elation.</LD>
<LD>   But the response wasn't triggered by one of his four goals in the
14-11 victory over Corona del Mar, but rather by one of his five
assists.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of times, I won't even know how many goals I've scored,"
said Hale, The Times' boys' water polo player of the year. "But the
assists? I love seeing one of my passes go just out of reach of [an
opposing] player's arms."</TE>
<TE>   Hale's pinpoint accuracy was one reason the Bruins finished
undefeated this season and won their sixth section title in seven
years.</TE>
<TE>   He was adept at lofting a pass to a well-guarded two-meter player
or crossing the ball to a driver on the opposite side, leaving the
goalkeeper out of position.</TE>
<TE>   Hale, a left-hander, was second on the team in scoring with 74
goals, mostly coming from the perimeter. In a section semifinal
victory over Lake Forest El Toro, Hale scored six goals, his final
tally breaking a 9-9 tie in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "When he gets open, he doesn't miss," Coach Tony Martinho said.</TE>
<TE>   His defense was crucial late in games, when Martinho often asked
him to guard the opposition's biggest scoring threat. In the section
final, he managed to slow Corona del Mar's John Mann, who still
finished with eight goals.</TE>
<TE>   Hale's speed and awareness also made him one of the Southland's
most effective players on the counterattack, whether finishing off
the play with a goal or passing it to a teammate for a better shot.</TE>
<TE>   Even when it came to setting up the offense, Hale was in control.</TE>
<TE>   "He was like a quarterback who had to hold on to the ball while
everyone was coming after him," Martinho said. "Then he had to make a
smart, accurate pass."</TE>
<TE>   Hale is the only three-year starter on Wilson's senior-laden team
this season. Coaches voted him player of the year in Division I.</TE>
<TE>   Hale has been a member of the junior national men's water polo
team since the spring and currently splits training between the
senior national team at its facility at the Los Alamitos Armed Forces
Center and the Wilson swim team.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a lot of upside," Martinho said.</TE>
<TE>   Hale has yet to make a decision as to which college to attend, but
he knows his high school playing days are over.</TE>
<TE>   Last week at Wilson's team banquet, a celebration for the six
senior starters who had played together since grade school, Hale
suddenly remembered a conversation he had with a former teammate.</TE>
<TE>   "He was saying how it won't even hit you until you go back to see
a game," Hale said. "But as soon as I got to the banquet it hit me. I
said, 'Dude, it's over.' "</TE>

<LD>The rainy weather the last two days didn't bother Sentimental Value.</LD>
<LD>   Owned and bred by the Thoroughbred Corporation and trained by
Kristin Mulhall, the 3-year-old Diesis filly has demonstrated she can
run on either turf or a wet main track.</LD>
<LD>   So, Sentimental Value will be comfortable in today's seventh at
Hollywood Park whether the race remains on the grass or switches to
the dirt.</LD>
<TE>   Second and third in her first two races in this country after
winning two of seven in England, Sentimental Value has won two in a
row. She took the Harold C. Ramser Sr. Handicap on the grass at Santa
Anita on Oct. 14, then won the Matiara at Hollywood Park in her first
race on dirt, necessitated when rain moved the race off the grass.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Espinoza was aboard the chestnut for both of her U.S.
victories and has the mount again today as he tries to overtake
Laffit Pincay and Alex Solis in the jockey standings.</TE>
<TE>   Entering the final week, Espinoza ranks third with 29 victories,
but Pincay, who leads with 32, will be absent until the Santa Anita
meet begins on Dec. 26, and Solis, who has 30 wins, will be off
today, Thursday and Friday to spend some time with his family.</TE>
<TE>   If the seventh stays on the turf, Nunatall is the one to beat.
Trained by Bobby Frankel for owner Ed Gann, Nunatall was last seen
running fourth in the Garden City Breeders' Cup Handicap, a Grade I,
on Sept. 8 at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Resolve makes his Aqueduct debut today for owners
Roddy Valente and Jared Abbruzzese and trainer Bruce Levine after
having been claimed for $100,000 on Oct. 24 at Santa Anita. In his
last race in California, the 4-year-old gray gelding lost by a head
to Piensa Sonando, who won the Native Diver Handicap on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Doug O'Neill. The trainer has won with 15 of 55
starters at Hollywood Park, and with five days left in the meet, is
on his way to the training title. Frankel is next with 10 victories.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Osman Cedeno and Caesar Bisono. The two jockeys are a
combined four for 100 at Golden Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A superfecta in the eighth keying Secret
Tales on top with Slew To Siren in the two hole, Lethal Lover,
Twining Colors and Pin Emerald in the three hole and all in the
fourth spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/76. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $13.60/$438.40. Total money bet: $512.</TE>

<HD>BET Founder Gets NBA Team</HD>
<DH>League selects Johnson for franchise in Charlotte. He will
be the first African American majority owner in major professional
sports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The billionaire founder of Black Entertainment Television will be
awarded the NBA's expansion franchise in Charlotte, N.C., making him
the first African American to hold a majority ownership in a major
professional sports franchise.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Johnson was selected by the league's expansion committee
over a group led by Boston entrepreneur Steve Belkin and former
Boston Celtic star Larry Bird.</LD>
<LD>   A news conference to announce Johnson's winning franchise bid will
be held today. Before it becomes official, it must be approved by the
league's board of governors next month. The fee for the franchise,
which will begin play in the 2004-05 season, is expected to be $300
million.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson had tried to buy Charlotte's previous NBA team, the
Hornets, but owner George Shinn wouldn't sell.</TE>
<TE>   Declining attendance and the city's refusal to build a new arena
-- both attributed, in part, to the public's dissatisfaction with
Shinn -- caused the Hornets to move to New Orleans this summer. But
the NBA quickly decided to seek a new team for Charlotte, a city in a
basketball-crazy state. The Hornets led the league in attendance
eight times after beginning play in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   The team ownership only adds distinction to Johnson's remarkable
success story, and represents another step forward for a league that
likes to consider itself progressive in its commitment to racial and
gender diversity.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA and its offspring, the WNBA, were the only leagues to
receive 'A' grades from the Northeastern Center for the Study of
Sport and Society's 2001 racial report card on the diversity of
coaches and front-office personnel in professional, Olympic and
college sports organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA trumpeted the purchase of the Denver Nuggets by Bertram
Lee and Peter Bynoe in 1989 as the league's first black ownership,
but it was later learned that Comsat Video actually owns 62.5% of the
team.</TE>
<TE>   Other high-profile African Americans who have since held minority
interests include Magic Johnson, who bought a 5% share in the Lakers
in 1994, and Isiah Thomas, who was a member of the group that was
awarded the Toronto expansion franchise in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Johnson's distinction as the first African American with
controlling interest in a franchise may have been inevitable given
his dogged pursuit of teams. He attempted to buy the NBA's Washington
franchise from Abe Pollin in the mid-1990s. Pollin had expressed a
desire to move his team -- then called the Bullets -- to downtown
Washington from the Maryland suburbs if the city built an arena.
Johnson said he would build an arena if Pollin sold him the team.
Pollin said the team wasn't for sale, and later paid for the arena's
construction himself.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson also leads a group that includes Washington Redskin owner
Daniel Snyder that is attempting to bring a baseball team back to the
nation's capital.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the leagues have to have a commitment to diversity of
opportunity," he told the Washington Post recently in regard to his
baseball bid. "I don't think they have to guarantee an outcome. I
wouldn't want to go into a league saying I got my franchise because
I'm a minority, or because I got a discount to what the next guy
paid.</TE>
<TE>   "National sports is too much of a tight club. It's too much of an
organization made up of people who are very accomplished in many
ways, have strong egos. The last thing you want to do is be in the
room because you got a set-aside. There's no way that I am looking
for a guaranteed outcome just because of my minority status."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson could not be reached for comment Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   The only one in a family of 10 children to graduate from college,
Johnson is the first African American billionaire, with a net worth
estimated at $1.3 billion by Forbes magazine earlier this year. He
founded BET with a $15,000 investment in 1979. Last year he sold the
controlling interest to Viacom for $3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his success, Johnson is not universally revered among
African Americans because some believe that BET plays to the lowest
common denominator with programming dominated by music videos.
Popular talk-show host and political commentator Tavis Smiley was let
go by the station last year and a public affairs show hosted by Ed
Gordon that featured embattled Republican leader Trent Lott this week
is slated for cancellation in January.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA's 30th team will be its first new club since the Toronto
Raptors and Vancouver Grizzlies were added in the 1995-96 season.</TE>

<HD>Ailing Deadmarsh Is Sidelined Again</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adam Deadmarsh had scored four goals in five games for the Kings
after sitting out nine games because of a concussion, but he was
sidelined again Tuesday because of an undetermined ailment affecting
his equilibrium.</LD>
<LD>   "He's not feeling right," Coach Andy Murray said of the veteran
winger, who leads the Kings with 13 goals in 20 games. "We don't know
if it's an inner-ear infection; it happened late last night. He
couldn't sleep."</LD>
<LD>   The Kings aren't sure if his symptoms are related to the
concussion he suffered Nov. 12 when hit by Aki Berg of the Toronto
Maple Leafs, or perhaps a new injury. More tests are scheduled today.</LD>
<TE>   His absence opened a spot in the lineup for rookie Jared Aulin,
who was recalled Sunday from the Kings' American Hockey League team
at Manchester, N.H., and made his NHL debut Tuesday night against the
St. Louis Blues.</TE>
<TE>   Aulin, 20, was considered a top prospect in the Colorado Avalanche
organization before the Kings acquired him in the February 2001 trade
that sent All-Star defenseman Rob Blake to the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tough," Aulin said of the trade, which also brought
Deadmarsh and Aaron Miller to the Kings. "But at the same time it was
a situation where Colorado didn't just give me away. L.A. got to
choose who they wanted, so I wasn't traded for being a bad player. It
was a trade where someone else wanted me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lubomir Visnovsky returned to the lineup after sitting out nine
games because of a back injury, while Derek Armstrong was put on the
injured reserve list because of a groin injury.... Mikko Eloranta,
who has scored two goals in 26 games, none in 12 since he returned
from a knee injury, was a healthy scratch for the first time in 13
months. "We're trying to find a little more scoring," Murray said.</TE>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>More of the same from Shaquille O'Neal on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Before the game, he sits on a metal chair in front of his locker,
heat packs on his knees, legs pushed out in front of him, toenails
painted shimmering green, like Christmas cookies.</LD>
<LD>   Smiling, talking about heading back to New Jersey, where he'll
visit his beloved great-grandmother tonight, about his holdings in
Newark, about whether they'll ever build that arena downtown.</LD>
<TE>   Chatting with Robert Horry, with his uncle, Jerome Crawford; with
a reporter about his abdominal exercises, the 10 pounds or so he has
lost in the last two weeks, down to 342 now, heading, he says, to
325.</TE>
<TE>   He gets on all fours, folded towels beneath his knees, and rolls
the ab wheel out a few feet, then back.</TE>
<TE>   "See?" he says. "Not too far. So it doesn't hurt your back. Try
it."</TE>
<TE>   Then, the predictable question about the team, about the Lakers'
start, and the predictable reply. He answers with a dull stare, then
leaves for his pregame massage.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on the week of the month with Shaquille," Coach Phil
Jackson said of his center's mood. "It's changeable, probably related
to the moon. He's been jovial and funny and playful and somber and
angry and respectful, all those things, within the last two weeks.
But right now, he's in a good mood. I think he feels good about what
he's doing, feels good about the way he's playing. He's got more
energy to play the game with."</TE>
<TE>   Amazingly, Jackson caused none of those moods.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say that's not atypical of the way he is," Jackson said.
"Some of it depends upon getting ready for the game, motivating his
teammates, defending himself against barrages you guys lay at his
feet.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part, I like his attitude right now. He's concerned
about the team. And I think he's providing a leadership role."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant is scheduled to appear on "The Late Show With David
Letterman" tonight.... Horry started at power forward for the second
consecutive game.... O'Neal continues to maintain a weightlifting
regimen, now three days a week instead of five.... Although the
Target Center did not sell out, the Lakers lead the league in road
attendance, averaging more than 19,000 a game.</TE>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Another day deeper into a season by all appearances crumbling,
another defeat behind them, the Lakers pushed onward, no longer
imposing their game upon others, but having it routinely thrust upon
them.</LD>
<LD>   They lost, 96-80, to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Tuesday night
at Target Center, which did not fill up at the lure of the three-time
defending champions. Then, they haven't looked much like it since
June, when they stood on a platform at mid-court in New Jersey, shiny
gold trophies held above their heads, no end to their dominance in
sight.</LD>
<LD>   If they don't yet get it, others are beginning to form opinions,
and gaining the courage to speak them.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't really worry about them," Minnesota guard Kendall Gill
said. "But it seems in all my days playing against them, the people
around Shaq and Kobe played much better in the past. I don't know why
they aren't stepping up. Like I said the other day, maybe they're
just bored with winning and they're trying to lose as many games as
they can to give themselves a challenge. They're too good of a team
to have their record the way it is."</TE>
<TE>   They are 10-16 and their public is beginning to wonder if this is
how their championship run will end -- with hardly a fight, with Phil
Jackson shouting at veteran players who won't make eye contact, at
the end of 18-point quarters, unchallenged jump shots, luxury buses
waiting to whisk them to the next disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   With half of the last quarter still to play, Shaquille O'Neal and
Kobe Bryant were summoned to the bench, stepping across Jackson on
their way, another game out of hand, a season approaching the same
dreary destination. They had not been closer than 10 points since the
middle of the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't like the way they were playing," Jackson said of the
starters he cleared.</TE>
<TE>   They're not competing. They're being overrun by lesser players
with lesser plans, by a team Tuesday night without starters Wally
Szczerbiak and Terrell Brandon, and then some of them slink off,
apparently unwilling to trust their words, their anger, publicly.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't pinpoint what I would say is the malady," Jackson said
later, then pinpointed poor choices, poor energy, poor shooting and
poor defense, among the issues.</TE>
<TE>   He added, "Kobe looked lackluster in the first half," to which
Bryant responded that he'd simply stayed within Jackson's beloved
triangle, trusted his teammates, watched them miss. If management is
to make personnel decisions in the coming weeks, it appears its task
is becoming more clear by the game.</TE>
<TE>   "My role is black and white," Bryant said. "I'm the facilitator. I
score when the opportunity presents itself. But I try to stay within
the confines of the offense. Especially now."</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota forward Kevin Garnett made 10 of 14 shots and scored 23
points. Five of his teammates scored in double figures as the
Timberwolves, largely unchallenged on the perimeter, made 51.3% of
their field-goal attempts, a season high against the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal had 17 points and nine rebounds in 37 minutes. Bryant
scored 15 points in 39 minutes. The Lakers shot 39.2% from the floor,
the seventh time this season they've been below 40%. Last season, in
82 games, they were worse than 40% five times.</TE>
<TE>   So, the Lakers lost for the 11th time in 13 road games. One of the
victories was in Los Angeles, at Staples Center, against the
Clippers, with plenty of fans cheering for them. Today, they'll
practice in New Jersey and Thursday night play the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no clue, man," Robert Horry said with a sigh. "It seems
like nothing's going our way this year."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's first timeout, his first angry one, came 22 seconds into
the second quarter, or a second-and-a-half after Anthony Peeler's
wide-open three-pointer pushed Minnesota's lead to 29-18.</TE>
<TE>   By then, the Timberwolves had made three of four three-pointers,
the Lakers had missed four of five, the Timberwolves were sensing the
Lakers were beatable again, the Lakers had here-we-go-again thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to not be that way," Horry said. "But everything's going
so against us, maybe it's starting to affect us."</TE>
<TE>   Three-pointers definitely are affecting them. So it was that the
Lakers, within 18-17 with 3:29 left in the first quarter, trailed,
45-25, not 12 minutes later. By halftime, it was 54-38, the Lakers
giving up at least 50 for the 10th time in their last 12 games. All
of them with O'Neal. All since they decided it was time to get
serious, that their four-peat dream was at stake, that they had to
play defense and play hard.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody's still confident," Horry said. "Just, like I
said, nothing's going our way."</TE>

<HD>Mavericks Return Favor in Victory Over Pacers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a big swat of the game's first shot, the Indiana Pacers showed
they were ready to rumble.</LD>
<LD>   But the Dallas Mavericks didn't bite. They stuck to their style
and worked it to perfection.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Finley had 33 points and 13 rebounds in three quarters,
and Nick Van Exel had 20 points and 10 assists as the Mavericks ran
and shot their way past the Pacers, 118-97, Tuesday night at Dallas
in a game between the teams with NBA's best records.</LD>
<TE>   "They wanted to use their physicality as an intimidation factor,
but we withstood that," Finley said. "We kept our composure and came
away with the win."</TE>
<TE>   Dallas improved to 21-3 and avenged a road loss last month that
prevented them from tying the best start in league history.</TE>
<TE>   This victory set a lesser, but still impressive record: Best home
start in franchise history, 12-0.</TE>
<TE>   The East-leading Pacers won the previous meeting, 110-98, with
their physical play and an offense that sliced through the Maverick
zone. Three players had at least 20 points last time; Jermaine O'Neal
led Indiana this time with 20.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki, who missed the previous two games resting a
sprained right ankle, had 20 points and five rebounds in 28 minutes.
Steve Nash had 13 points and seven assists.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana (18-6) had won three straight, but over a longer stretch
the Pacers are 4-4, with all four losses on the road. Their previous
worst loss had been by 15.</TE>
<TE>   "They were ready for us," Pacer Coach Isiah Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 95, Phoenix 86 -- Chris Webber had 27 points and 12
rebounds as the Kings stayed perfect at home and ended the Suns'
four-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Jackson had 19 points for the Kings, who never trailed and
won for the 15th victory in 17 games. Sacramento scored 10 straight
points to begin the fourth quarter while improving to 13-0 at Arco
Arena this season.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Casey Jacobsen, a former Stanford and Glendora High
standout, had a season-best 15 points for the Suns.</TE>
<TE>   Portland 102, New Orleans 93 -- Bonzi Wells scored a season-high
30 points, and Rasheed Wallace had 22 points and 13 rebounds to lead
the Trail Blazers at Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Portland pulled ahead thanks to a 12-5 third-quarter run that put
some distance between the two teams after what had been a very close
game. There were 16 ties and 10 lead changes before the Trail Blazers
finally built a lead.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 109, Atlanta 99 -- Michael Jordan rebounded from one of
the worst games of his career by scoring a season-high 30 points and
Jerry Stackhouse had 23 to lead the Wizards at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Jordan had only two points in 40 minutes -- matching
the career low he set last April -- but he equaled that 17 seconds
into this game with a jumper from the wing. He easily got open shots,
spending most of the game defended by Glenn Robinson and Ira Newble.</TE>
<TE>   New York 101, New Jersey 99 -- Allan Houston scored 29 points,
including the go-ahead jumper with 36.6 seconds left to lead the
Knicks at New York, ending a six-game losing streak to the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd scored a season-high 39 for the Nets but missed a
potential game-tying 12 footer from the lane with four seconds left.
Richard Jefferson then missed a tip, and time expired before the Nets
could get off another shot.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 122, Milwaukee 117 -- Morris Peterson made two free throws
with seven seconds left in overtime at Milwaukee as the Raptors ended
a four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Allen, who had 37 points, made a three-pointer to get
Milwaukee to 118-117 with 15 seconds left. Alvin Williams was fouled
and made both free throws to extend the Raptors' lead to 120-117 with
14 seconds left.</TE>

<HD>Braves Add Ortiz, Byrd to Their Staff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quickly remaking their starting rotation, the Atlanta Braves acquired
Russ Ortiz from San Francisco on Tuesday and signed free-agent Paul
Byrd to a $10 million, two-year contract.</LD>
<LD>   The Braves already had landed Mike Hampton in a trade and lost Tom
Glavine to the New York Mets. Greg Maddux -- like Glavine, a free
agent -- has until Thursday to accept the Braves' offer of salary
arbitration.</LD>
<LD>   To get Ortiz, Atlanta sent pitcher Damian Moss and minor league
pitcher Manuel Mateo to San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   Ortiz, a 27-year-old right-hander, was 14-10 last season with a
3.61 earned-run average, helping the Giants reach the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz is to earn $4.6 million in 2003, and the Braves have a club
option for $5.7 million in 2004 with a $300,000 buyout. The option
could increase by as much as $900,000 based on the number of innings
he pitches next season.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd, 32, pitched for Atlanta in 1997 and 1998 before being put on
waivers and claimed by the Philadelphia Phillies, for whom he went
15-11 in 1999. He was 17-11 last season with a 3.90 ERA for the
Kansas City Royals. He gets $3 million next season and has a $7
million player option for 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Moss, 26, went 12-6 with a 3.42 ERA as the Braves' fifth starter
last season, his first in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The St. Louis Cardinals and veteran catcher Joe Girardi have
agreed to a one-year, $750,000 contract. The Cardinals also announced
that outfielder-catcher Eli Marrero agreed to a two-year, $4.5
million contract extension through 2004. Pitcher Garrett Stephenson
also agreed to a one-year, $800,000 deal.... The Chicago Cubs signed
outfielder Troy O'Leary to a one-year, $750,000 deal. With
incentives, O'Leary could earn $1 million.... Norm Charlton, once one
of the best relievers in baseball but now a 39-year-old question mark
coming off rotator cuff surgery, has agreed to terms on a minor
league contract with the Seattle Mariners.... Boston agreed to a
one-year deal with utilityman Jeremy Giambi.... The Astros are in
"serious negotiations" with free agent second baseman Jeff Kent,
Houston owner Drayton McLane Jr. told a local television station.</TE>
<TE>   Boxing</TE>
<TE>   Although promoter Bob Arum says that the Sept. 13 Oscar De La
Hoya-Shane Mosley rematch will be held in Las Vegas, either at
Mandalay Bay or the MGM Grand, Staples Center president Tim Leiweke
isn't going down without a fight.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to get that fight," insisted Leiweke, who called
Arum on Tuesday to state the case for his arena, which played host to
the first De La Hoya-Mosley fight in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Staples Center paid a $5.5 million site fee for that first fight.
Leiweke concedes the price will be higher this time, but said, "We
are not going to get into a situation where we have to charge the
fans ridiculous prices."</TE>
<TE>   Marilyn Salcido (9-3-3, two knockouts) and Para Draine (11-5-1,
three KOs) will meet tonight in a scheduled 10-round fight for the
International Female Boxing Assn.'s vacant bantamweight title in the
main event of a five-bout card at the Irvine Marriott. It will be a
rematch of their last fight on Aug. 17, which ended in a draw.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the card: light heavyweight Joe Pastorello (4-0, two KOs)
of Anaheim will meet Dimitrique Edwards (5-2, three KOs) of Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   The PGA Tour is taking away five cards from its qualifying
tournament and giving those spots to the Nationwide Tour. Previously,
the top 15 from the developmental tour money list earned their exempt
cards. That will increase to the top 20. Only the top 30 and ties --
instead of the top 35 -- will advance from Q-school.</TE>
<TE>   A judge ruled against a media company that sued the PGA Tour for
the right to sell the tour's real-time scoring to other media
outlets. Morris Communications, which owns The Florida Times-Union
and The Augusta (Ga.) Chronicle, said it would appeal the 34-page
summary judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Irons, who already had clinched the Assn. of Surfing
Professionals' 2002 world title, edged Shane Dorian in the final of
the Xbox Pipeline Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Irons, 24, not only won the $250,000 competition, but the more
prestigious overall Vans Triple Crown of Surfing championship on
Oahu's North Shore.</TE>
<TE>   Irons, who had accumulated enough points to clinch the world title
despite failing to advance beyond the quarterfinals of the Rip Curl
Cup at Sunset Beach, methodically worked his way into the final at
Pipeline and registered a score of 8.4 out of a possible 10 with six
minutes left to pull past Dorian.</TE>

<HD>Harrington Undergoes Procedure to Fix Heart</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Detroit Lion quarterback Joey Harrington was released from the
hospital Tuesday after undergoing a procedure to repair an abnormal
heart rhythm.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Claudio Schuger, director of clinical cardiac
electrophysiology at Henry Ford Hospital, said Harrington's heart is
structurally sound.</LD>
<LD>   "For all practical circumstances, Joey is healed," Schuger said.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, Schuger inserted an electrode catheter into the rookie
quarterback's heart, destroying parts of the electrical pathway that
caused the arrhythmia. Harrington chose to undergo the procedure
rather than take lifelong medication.</TE>
<TE>   "Medication is not the best option," Schuger said.</TE>
<TE>   He noted medication's potential side effects, the possibility that
it could affect an athlete's performance and the nuisance of taking
medicine for life.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington was taken to the hospital after having a rapid
heartbeat in Sunday's game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. His
heart raced to more than 200 beats per minute.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington, 24, will need three to six weeks to heal, but can
resume normal practice and off-season training after that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee Titan left tackle Brad Hopkins could miss as many as
three weeks because of ligament damage in his right knee.</TE>
<TE>   An MRI exam showed Hopkins injured the medial collateral ligament.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Jeff Fisher said the team was concerned that Hopkins also
hurt his anterior cruciate ligament late in the third quarter of the
Titans' 24-7 victory over New England on Monday night. Hopkins was
able to walk off the field by himself.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher said when Hopkins returns depends on how quickly he regains
stability in his knee and how he handles the soreness.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Matthews is expected to start Sunday at Jacksonville.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Morten Andersen, the second-leading scorer in NFL history, was put
on injured reserve and will miss Kansas City's final two games. That
ends Andersen's streak of consecutive games at 248, the NFL's
second-longest and 34 short of Jim Marshall's league record.</TE>
<TE>   The left-footed kicker will undergo arthroscopic surgery on his
right knee for cartilage damage.</TE>
<TE>   He hurt the knee during warmups Oct. 6 at the New York Jets.</TE>
<TE>   In other Chief news, NFL rushing leader Priest Holmes probably
won't play on Sunday against San Diego because of a hip injury.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Dick Vermeil said Tuesday it was "very doubtful" Holmes
would play. Vermeil said Dr. Jon Browne, the Chiefs' team physician,
had sent copies of the results of his MRI exam to consultants in New
York as well as to another associate.</TE>

<HD>Modano Left Seeing Stars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Without Mike Modano, the Dallas Stars couldn't put away the
Philadelphia Flyers.</LD>
<LD>   Keith Primeau and Mark Recchi scored power-play goals 59 seconds
apart in the third period, lifting the Flyers into a 2-2 tie with
Dallas in a matchup of first-place teams Tuesday night at
Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   Modano and Jason Arnott scored for Pacific Division-leading
Dallas, which has the best record in the NHL at 18-7-7-1. The Flyers,
first in the Atlantic Division at 15-7-7-1, are unbeaten in their
last four (3-0-1).</LD>
<TE>   Modano gave the Stars a 1-0 lead after only 29 seconds with his
13th goal, but left the game less than five minutes later after being
checked hard into the boards by Jeremy Roenick. Roenick's check drew
a major penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Modano complained of headaches, and didn't return. The Stars ruled
out a concussion and Modano could be ready for Dallas' game at
Detroit on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's feeling all right. For precautionary reasons I kept him
out," Star Coach Dave Tippett said. "It motivated our team."</TE>
<TE>   Primeau got the Flyers within 2-1 on his eighth goal with 8
minutes 50 seconds left. The Flyers got the tying goal when Recchi
tried a pass to Primeau, who was skating toward the net, but the puck
struck a Star defenseman and went over goaltender Marty Turco's
shoulder, tying the score with 7:51 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first game for Flyer Coach Ken Hitchcock against his
former team. Hitchcock was fired by the Stars on Jan. 25.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 2, New York Islanders 2 -- Luc Robitaille's third-period
goal completed Detroit's comeback at Uniondale, N.Y. Curtis Joseph
started for the Red Wings and stopped nine of 11 shots before being
pulled for Manny Legace to start the second period. Legace then
stopped all 21 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, Edmonton 3 -- Richard Park scored the tying goal in
the third period and then won it in overtime as the Wild won for the
first time over the Oilers. Park picked up a rebound in front with
16.3 seconds remaining in overtime, and lifted a shot over Edmonton
goalie Jussi Markanen at St. Paul, Minn. Minnesota was 0-7-2-3
against Edmonton until Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 3, Montreal 1-- Patrick Marleau had a goal and an assist,
and Evgeni Nabokov made 23 saves for the Sharks at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary 3, Nashville 0 -- Roman Turek, playing his 12th straight
game, stopped 23 shots as the Flames won at Nashville, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 3, Vancouver 2 -- Kyle Calder scored a power-play goal
with one second left to lift the Blackhawks at Vancouver, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 5, Pittsburgh 2 -- Phoenix rookie Ramzi Abid, recalled
three days earlier from the minors, had two goals and an assist as
the Coyotes won at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   The Penguins are winless in their last nine (0-8-0-1).</TE>

<HD>Sun Belt Is Shining After North Texas Wins, 24-19</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cincinnati quarterback Gino Guidugli was the headliner entering the
New Orleans Bowl, but the North Texas defense was what everybody was
talking about after the game.</LD>
<LD>   North Texas intercepted five of Guidugli's passes and held
Cincinnati to 85 yards rushing in a 24-19 victory Tuesday night at
New Orleans.</LD>
<LD>   "They had a good scheme, and I messed up a lot," Guidugli said.
"They rushed three and got good pressure while dropping eight [into
coverage] and I forced too many balls."</LD>
<TE>   Kevin Galbreath ran for 130 yards, including a 35-yard touchdown,
and Jeremy Pearl scored on a 20-yard interception return for North
Texas (8-5), which won its seventh game in a row. The Mean Green won
their first game against a Division I-A team outside of the Sun Belt
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "It means a lot, because people don't have respect for us," Pearl
said. "If we can't get our respect now, I don't know when we can."</TE>
<TE>   The victory also gave the two-year-old Sun Belt its first bowl
victory. North Texas lost to Colorado State last year in the
inaugural New Orleans Bowl. This season, Cincinnati (7-7) finished
tied for first in Conference USA with Texas Christian.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Smith completed nine of 22 passes for 126 yards, but North
Texas gained 192 yards rushing to control the tempo. Galbreath also
had a 19-yard first-down run in the last two minutes that allowed
North Texas to run out the clock without giving Guidugli another
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Guidugli, who came in averaging 255 yards passing, was 19 of 34
for 224 yards and a touchdown. He had been intercepted 16 times
before being intercepted five times by North Texas.</TE>

<TE>   Two of the premier quarterbacks at the collegiate level will lead
their teams into the GMAC Bowl tonight in Mobile, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Byron Leftwich of Marshall (10-2) and Dave Ragone of Louisville
(7-5) are expected to be among the top quarterbacks selected in the
NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   Both were finalists for the Unitas Award, given to the nation's
top quarterback. Both have led their teams to three consecutive bowl
games after replacing quarterbacks who moved on to the NFL --
Marshall's Chad Pennington and Louisville's Chris Redman.</TE>
<TE>   Leftwich passed for 4,019 yards as a senior despite missing one
game because of a shin injury. Ragone passed for 2,687 yards and 23
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night's Heisman Trophy award ceremony drew a 3.09 cable
rating on ESPN, a 67% increase from last year. It's the highest
rating for the event since ESPN began televising it in 1994.... New
Mexico defensive coordinator Bronco Mendenhall took the same job at
Mountain West Conference rival Brigham Young, but will remain with
the Lobo staff through the Las Vegas Bowl on Christmas Day, when New
Mexico plays UCLA.... Mississippi receiver and kick returner Jason
Armstead will not play in the Independence Bowl against Nebraska on
Dec. 27 because he failed to meet academic requirements.... Oklahoma
State Coach Les Miles has agreed to a contract extension, but details
about the extension were not released.... Milton Kirk, a former high
school coach who exposed a recruiting scandal at Alabama, was
sentenced in federal court to six months in a halfway house. He
admitted taking part in a payoff scheme to send defensive lineman
Albert Means to Alabama two years ago.</TE>

<HD>Give Rose Hall Pass, Not a Key</HD>

<LD>My Baseball Hall of Fame ballot arrived the other day, its thick
manila envelope possessing the sort of dignity not usually found in a
mailbox.</LD>
<LD>   Every year, I carry it inside as if handling precious metal.</LD>
<LD>   Every year, I close the office door, unfold it on my desk, and
bask in the splendid block-lettered names with but a single regret.</LD>
<TE>   I wish Pete Rose were one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Because I would vote for him.</TE>
<TE>   I would put him in the front row of baseball's cathedral, honor
him as one of its greatest hitters, give him his rightful reward as
one of sport's last legends.</TE>
<TE>   I want Pete Rose on my ballot.</TE>
<TE>   I just don't want him managing my baseball team.</TE>
<TE>   I don't want him working with my minor leaguers.</TE>
<TE>   I don't want him running my marketing department.</TE>
<TE>   I want him in baseball's shrine, but I don't want him anywhere
near its clubhouses.</TE>
<TE>   And I am not alone.</TE>
<TE>   This is the crux of baseball's problem this winter as it tries to
create new interest by rescuing an old scamp.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Rose belongs in the Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   He does not belong on a baseball field.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the Hall of Fame rules won't allow one without the other.</TE>
<TE>   And Rose won't accept one without the other.</TE>
<TE>   And his thousands of fans want whatever Rose wants.</TE>
<TE>   So, Commissioner Bud Selig, after meetings last month, could be on
the verge of bending to public pressure and giving him both.</TE>
<TE>   Which would be like allowing a cheater to retake a test two
periods later, all because you're sick of hearing his playground
buddies whine.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It has been 13 years since Rose signed an agreement that banned
him from baseball, and nothing about it has changed.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing, except our memory.</TE>
<TE>   A man once booed out of his hometown is now cheered everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   A man who perpetrated one of baseball's ugliest scandals is now
painted as a victim.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie the hustler is once again Charlie Hustle.</TE>
<TE>   A complete face-lift, without one nick of the knife.</TE>
<TE>   Not once has Rose acknowledged the contents of a 225-page
agreement that painted him as a bettor, not only on baseball, but on
the Cincinnati Reds he managed in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Not once has he admitted to having a gambling problem, despite
mounds of evidence to the contrary, or asked for help from the many
who have offered.</TE>
<TE>   A notoriously bad gambler, Rose has spent the last decade making
the longshot bet of a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   He wagered that his silence, combined with the accompanying
cheers, would wear down baseball as his foul balls once wore down
pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   He wagered that with enough headfirst slides into the public
embrace, the truth would eventually be lost in the dust.</TE>
<TE>   Amazingly, he might be right.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Rose was given a standing ovation at Pacific Bell Park
in San Francisco during a greatest-moments promotion.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second World Series standing ovation he had received in
three years, which is more than just about any active player who is
not a New York Yankee.</TE>
<TE>   It was also the second time that season he had played to a raucous
crowd. An earlier charity softball game in Cincinnati had drawn
41,092.</TE>
<TE>   When he's not touring the country, selling his name to these
adoring fans, he is hanging out in the Valley, greeting folks at his
favorite lunch spot on Sepulveda, watching his daughter act and his
son play basketball for Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High.</TE>
<TE>   Still brash, sometimes tacky, Rose is always easy to find. But
baseball has long tried to ignore him, even as he was peddling his
autograph a couple of doors down from the actual Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Then this winter, saddled with its worst World Series TV ratings,
and attendance decreases in 20 of its 30 ballparks, baseball finally
had to pay attention.</TE>
<TE>   Rose and Selig met Nov. 25 in Milwaukee, their first official
encounter since Rose applied for reinstatement five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of both sides have also met, apparently
substantively for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   This is not merely some farce to quiet the public, this is real.</TE>
<TE>   Real scary.</TE>
<TE>   Neither side will comment, but common sense would dictate that
Selig not allow Rose to return to baseball without admitting that he
has a problem and that he's seeking help.</TE>
<TE>   But those who have listened to Rose during the last 13 years can
never imagine him admitting any such thing.</TE>
<TE>   And if he did, after all this time and all that mud, who could
believe his sincerity?</TE>
<TE>   I am one of those who has listened. I have heard Rose speak in
courtrooms, in memorabilia stores, at autograph shows, and last
spring at the Beverly Hills offices of his new shoe sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   Not once has he shown any regret, remorse, or inclination to
acknowledge anything that appeared in a report that his signature
once endorsed.</TE>
<TE>   The Dowd report, even though written by a zealous investigator who
has carried a grudge like a cop looking for a one-armed man, was
clear in its findings:</TE>
<TE>   * There were three betting sheets on Red games that bore Rose's
fingerprints and handwriting.</TE>
<TE>   * There were 10 witnesses who'd said Rose bet heavily and often on
the Reds.</TE>
<TE>   * There were phone records of many calls between Rose's Riverfront
Stadium office and a bookie.</TE>
<TE>   Ask him about those things today, and Rose will say he never had a
chance to present his side of the story.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, history will show that he dodged five hearings before finally
agreeing to be banned from baseball.</TE>
<TE>   That's right. All this fuss about something to which Rose affixed
his signature.</TE>
<TE>   If he really wanted to contest the banishment order, why did he
sign it in the first place?</TE>
<TE>   And after all these years of denial, we should accept his
admission now?</TE>
<TE>   Friends of Rose say a decision could be reached in January. Here's
hoping that instead of collapsing, baseball gets creative.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Rose clearly belongs in the Hall of Fame, alongside other
stars with far more checkered pasts, particularly because there is no
evidence he bet on baseball while playing.</TE>
<TE>   So why can't the Hall's board of directors, which works closely
with baseball, change the rules regarding ineligible players and
allow it?</TE>
<TE>   Why can't there be an exception for one of the most exceptional
players?</TE>
<TE>   He would be voted in immediately, the fans would be happy, Rose's
cause would be weakened, baseball would be stronger.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Hustle belongs on a pedestal, his plaque on a wall.</TE>
<TE>   But Charlie Hustler has no business in a dugout.</TE>

<HD>Tide Pays Price for Its New Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only days after telling his players he wasn't interested in UCLA
because "I can't take you with me," Coach Mike Price is leaving
Washington State to become coach at Alabama.</LD>
<LD>   Price told his team Tuesday in an emotional meeting before leaving
for the airport, where a private plane provided by Alabama was
waiting to take him to Tuscaloosa.</LD>
<LD>   "I just couldn't pass it up.... I'm getting up there [in age],"
said Price, 56. "I've got to do this for my family."</LD>
<TE>   Contract figures were not available, but Mike Riley reportedly
turned down an eight-year deal worth $12 million from Alabama, in
part because of his interest in the UCLA job.</TE>
<TE>   Price will replace Dennis Franchione, who led Alabama to a 10-3
record despite probation before leaving after only two seasons to
become coach at Texas A&amp;M.</TE>
<TE>   In losing Price, Washington State is saying goodbye to the coach
that took the school to its first Rose Bowl in 67 years in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   He needed five years to get them back again -- and in something of
a surprise, Price said he still will coach the No. 7-ranked Cougars
in their return to the Rose Bowl Jan. 1 against No. 8 Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State has scheduled a news conference for this morning
to discuss the coaching situation, and Athletic Director Jim Sterk is
expected to announce Bill Doba, assistant head coach and defensive
coordinator, will be the school's next coach.</TE>
<TE>   Doba, 62, arrived in Pullman along with Price in 1989, coaching
with him for 14 seasons in which the Cougars went 83-77.</TE>
<TE>   Price's announcement left some of his players in tears,
quarterback Jason Gesser among them.</TE>
<TE>   "He told us he was going to Alabama," offensive lineman Calvin
Armstrong told reporters. "He said he was sorry, and it was a real
tough decision, but financially it was the right decision for his
family."</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Rien Long, the Outland Trophy winner, called the
news "a shock."</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of different emotions and people in there,"
defensive tackle Jeremey Williams said. "We thought he'd be here
forever."</TE>
<TE>   Price doesn't have ties to Alabama -- a native of Everett, Wash.,
the closest he has worked to Alabama was as an assistant at Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   However, he is an old acquaintance of Alabama Athletic Director
Mal Moore, who, like Price, was an assistant coach under Jim Sweeney,
the retired Fresno State coach.</TE>
<TE>   He faces a big task at Alabama, with the Crimson Tide still on
probation in the aftermath of the Albert Means recruiting scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Price has a folksy charm that will go over well in Alabama -- at
least until the first loss. (He once described his wide-open offense
as having "more wrinkles than a Shar-pei dog.")</TE>
<TE>   The impact of probation will make the job more difficult, hence
the unusually long contract terms. But Price has experience with a
difficult situation in Pullman.</TE>
<TE>   He helped Washington State earn its reputation as a quarterback
training ground with such players as Drew Bledsoe, Ryan Leaf and
Gesser.</TE>
<TE>   He also made a living off players some other programs wouldn't
take, giving opportunities to those with academic shortcomings and
behavioral problems and earning a reputation as players' coach.</TE>
<TE>   The 1997 Rose Bowl team featured Michael Black, a running back
from Dorsey High who served time in two youth facilities for auto
theft and armed robbery before he reached the age of 18. Black became
a 1,000-yard rusher under Price.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most memorably, he allowed receiver Devard Darling to play
this year after securing medical approval when Florida State and
other schools balked after Darling's twin brother died after an off
season workout at Florida State.</TE>
<TE>   Price took junior college transfers and walk-ons who later became
starters.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoy turning over rocks and finding players others have not
recruited," he once said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether that will work at Alabama -- or whether he'll need to
resort to that route -- remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Now he leaves for a position he called "the premier coaching job
in America," saying he is confident Washington State will survive
without him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to sustain itself with or without me here. I can tell
you that," Price said as reports about the Alabama job first emerged.
"They can keep on winning without me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Correspondent Howie Stalwick and the Associated Press contributed
to this report.</TE>

<HD>Rix Ineligible After Missing Final Exam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Florida State on Tuesday declared starting quarterback Chris Rix
ineligible for the Sugar Bowl because the former Santa Margarita High
player had overslept and missed a final exam last week.</LD>
<LD>   "I know we, as players, are aware of the rule about not missing an
exam," Rix said in a prepared statement. "Due to a personal family
issue, which was weighing heavily on me, I slept through an early
final exam. I apologize to my teammates, coaches and the fans, as
this is a difficult price to pay."</LD>
<LD>   The disciplinary action was required by a state policy, said Jeff
Purinton, a spokesman in the Florida State athletic department. Known
as the "Deion Sanders rule," the policy was adopted after Sanders had
played in the 1989 Sugar Bowl without having taken any final exams.</LD>
<TE>   "It's an academic decision, there's no chance for [Rix] to play in
the Sugar Bowl," Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden said.</TE>
<TE>   Purinton said Rix, a redshirt sophomore who was the Atlantic Coast
Conference's freshman of the year in 2001, was enrolled in four
courses. Purinton would not confirm reports that the final exam Rix
missed was in a religion course, and said Rix had not elaborated
about the family issue.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Fabian Walker, who has thrown eight passes in three
games, will start at quarterback in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1 in New
Orleans, where the 16th-ranked Seminoles (9-4) will play No. 4
Georgia (12-1). Walker played high school football in Americus, Ga.,
and chose to attend Florida State over Georgia after setting state
records in yards passing, 8,281, and touchdown passes, 81.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know really what happened, but I am excited to get to
start," Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   Rix began the season as starting quarterback but completed only 13
of 32 passes in a 34-24 home loss to Notre Dame and was replaced in
the next four games by sophomore Adrian McPherson.</TE>
<TE>   Rix returned to the starter's role in the season finale against
Florida when McPherson was dropped from the team Nov. 25 for
involvement with a stolen check that led to criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   In the regular-season closer against Florida, Rix threw for two
touchdowns in a 31-14 victory. He practiced with the Seminoles on
Monday, delivering two long passes to receiver Dominic Robinson,
according to the university's practice notes.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no clue this was going to happen; I don't think anyone
did," Robinson said. "[Rix] wasn't out there [Tuesday], and people
were really whispering about it when [starting receiver] Anquan
Boldin was asked to take snaps with the second team."</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Matt Henshaw will be the Seminoles' other quarterback
option against Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Said Rix: "I talked to the university about my circumstances, but
the decision had already been made."</TE>

<HD>Grand Plan</HD>
<DH>Sampras will play at least one more year on the tour but
will miss Australian Open</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Dwyre</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tennis star Pete Sampras ended the speculation Tuesday. He will play
at least one more season on the tour, his 16th, but will skip the
first major of 2003, the Australian Open in Melbourne in mid-January.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll start in February in San Jose," he said, "and then go right
from there to tournaments in Scottsdale, Indian Wells and Miami."</LD>
<LD>   He is skipping the Australian because the timing of his decision
to keep playing won't allow him to properly prepare for the
tournament. But after he begins in San Jose, he said it will be
business as usual. He will play the three remaining Grand Slam
events, the French in May, Wimbledon in June and the U.S. Open in
September, and schedule other tournaments as his health and
inclination dictate.</LD>
<TE>   He said he does not want his 2003 season to be viewed as some sort
of farewell tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just going to see how it goes, just kind of ride the wave and
see how far it takes me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Until he won his 14th Grand Slam event title at the U.S. Open
three months ago, the only retirement talk involving the 31-year-old
was by the media. Before the Open, he had not won an event, much less
a major, since making men's tennis history with his 13th Grand Slam
title in the 2000 Wimbledon, a span of 26 months.</TE>
<TE>   As the losses piled up, most of his postmatch news conferences
were dominated by gently worded questions about whether he was near
the end.</TE>
<TE>   "The last couple of years were tough," he said Tuesday. "It took a
lot out of me, emotionally, to not play well and to have to talk
about it all the time."</TE>
<TE>   But once he shocked the sports world with his dramatic U.S. Open
victory over Andre Agassi in the final, the euphoria of that 14th
major title -- two more than any other man -- was such that he
agonized about ending his career on that high.</TE>
<TE>   "Of all the majors, that was the sweetest," he said. "It was just
hard to top that. There were many moments when I seriously talked
about stopping. Once I won, I felt like I had wiped out two years of
criticism in two weeks of tennis."</TE>
<TE>   He has not played a competitive match since beating Agassi, and
that inactivity fueled speculation that he would retire. He used the
time to ponder his future at home in Beverly Hills and said his
closest advisors were his wife, Bridgette Wilson, the actress who
recently gave birth to their first child, son Christian; plus his
father, Sam, and his brother, Gus.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept looking for something to tell me, for somebody to give me
an answer," he said. "But there wasn't one moment, not any one
conversation, some quote or even something I heard on TV. Sometime
last week, I just decided. The talk of not playing seemed a little
scary, and I've kept playing enough around here since the Open to
know that I still enjoy playing.</TE>
<TE>   "And now that I've decided, that I'm announcing it and letting
people know, it feels good. I'm relieved. And the goals are the same
as they were 10 years ago, to win majors."</TE>
<TE>   He will make one concession to age. He will go from his old Wilson
racket with 85 square inches of hitting surface -- the smallest used
by anybody on the men's tour -- to another one, specially made for
him by Wilson, with 90. The usual club player's racket is 110 square
inches.</TE>
<TE>   "I've played with the same racket since I was 14," he said, "and
the technology on the old one has about run its course. I need to try
something a little upgraded. My arm was getting sore last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand that, week in and week out, I don't have what I had
when I was No. 1 in the world (1993-1998). To do that, to stay there,
it has to be your total life, you have to live and breathe it. But
that doesn't mean I can't still win the big ones. That's why I play."</TE>
<TE>   When it is time for him to retire, there are business interests
already in place. The new Carson sports complex, being built by Phil
Anschutz and scheduled to be finished this summer, will be home to
the Pete Sampras Tennis Academy. And he also has an investment
interest in the Tennis Channel, scheduled to debut this spring.</TE>
<TE>   "My name is on it [the tennis academy], and so I'll be there," he
said. "I'll play exhibitions and have a presence. That will be more
of a focus as I wind down."</TE>
<TE>   But for now, the only winding down Pete Sampras will be doing will
be after more big matches in more big tournaments.</TE>

<HD>Lavin Could Save Lakers, but Who's Saving Him?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I saw the advertisement last week for the movie, "The Man Who
Saved Christmas," it reminded me I knew the man who could save the
Lakers, and so I met with Steve Lavin to see if he had some advice
for Coach Phil Jackson.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson's team is off to a Lavin-like start with ESPN asking the
question Tuesday on its Internet site: "Are the Lakers lottery
bound?"</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not sure I can really tell a guy who has won three straight
NBA titles anything," Lavin said.</LD>
<TE>   I told him, however, the Lakers have come out of the gate flat
this season. The coach appears clueless. The team is losing to crummy
teams they should clobber. Everyone is upset. And Lavin nodded -- as
if he'd heard it all before.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing I'd tell him is to get some fresh air at the
beach," Lavin said, and I took notes so I could pass them on to
Jackson. "Next, I'd tell him the universal challenge is to have his
team play with sustained intensity -- after that, when it's all said
and done, I'd be surprised if the Lakers aren't in the NBA Finals."</TE>
<TE>   And if they aren't in the Finals? "I'd give him one more year
[before firing him]," Lavin said, and these folks at UCLA are tough,
really tough.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LAVIN, of course, is gone after this season. He's been "gone"
after every season for the last six years, but this time he's really
gone, as everyone knows, because UCLA hired an athletic director for
this basketball school, who then fired the Bruins' football coach
just for practice.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm no more gone or less gone than any other point in my tenure
here at UCLA," Lavin said, and I said, "Oh no, you're gone -- I mean
going, going, gone."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin laughed. He laughs a lot because he hears he's gone a lot,
and when you've stood before the firing squad time after time and
they keep missing, what else are you going to do?</TE>
<TE>   "After what happened to Bob [Toledo], everywhere I went the first
question everyone asked me was, 'Are you next?' And I would tell
them, 'No, I have no interest in being the next football coach at
UCLA. In fact I'm taking my name out of consideration.' "</TE>
<TE>   Now when he does get fired I wouldn't suggest seeking work at the
Comedy Store, but you do have to like his attitude, and his
remarkable resiliency while being pummeled with criticism. He's one
of the most successful college coaches in the country -- just check
the statistics -- but it's nowhere near enough for the Bruin
faithful.</TE>
<TE>   This season began with a pair of exhibition losses that had fans
crying for his dismissal before the first game that counted was
played, and then he lost that one too. Before Tuesday night's game
with Northern Arizona, students outside Pauley Pavilion were passing
out "LoseLavin.com" pamphlets detailing all that has gone wrong
during his tenure here.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen, nothing has changed here," Lavin said. "We won the
national championship in '95, and there was no criticism of Coach
[Jim] Harrick until after the first game the very next [season] when
we lost to Santa Clara. And when we started 1-2, they wanted Harrick
dismissed -- six months after winning the national championship."</TE>
<TE>   Well, some things have changed here. The "FireLavin.com" site on
the Internet lost steam, and now sits unused. And the running clock
on another Internet site timed to coincide with Lavin's dismissal has
run its course, and he's still here.</TE>
<TE>   But for how much longer? Traditional basketball powerhouses such
as Purdue, North Carolina, Syracuse and Temple did not make it into
the NCAA tournament last season -- what would happen if Lavin's UCLA
team failed to make the tournament?</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be fired," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HE DIDN'T mention anything about losing to Northern Arizona, so I
presume this morning he is still employed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT'S TOO bad something couldn't be worked out here with our two
losing coaches. The final score just came in, and the Lakers got
ripped again. It's going to take a miracle to make the Lakers one of
the NBA's 16 playoff teams, but bringing a team from the brink of
disaster and putting them in the Sweet 16 is a Lavin specialty --
something he has done five of the last six seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, of course, doesn't care much about the games leading up
to the determination of the final 16, but once there, he's a
ferocious closer.</TE>
<TE>   I'd suggest arranging some kind of swap -- Jackson taking over
once the Bruins make it to the Sweet 16, but knowing the way both
Jackson and Lavin coach against teams they're supposed to beat, I'm
pretty sure the results would have been the same against Northern
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Just for a second imagine Lavin coaching the Lakers -- Bruin fans
can imagine him coaching almost anywhere but UCLA -- and you can't
tell me the final results would have been any worse in Minnesota. And
for a change, wouldn't it have been nice to see a Laker coach break a
sweat?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PAULEY PAVILION had that Mighty Ducks-like feeling to it with
empty seats everywhere -- giving AD Dan Guerrero more ammunition for
making the same kind of "bad environment" argument he made to fire
Toledo. Lavin better win the national championship this season, and
not lose the opener next season.</TE>
<TE>   Who am I kidding? He's already a goner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Dave Gilmore:</TE>
<TE>   "I thought your point about interviewing O.J. Simpson during the
Heisman weekend was well said. Aren't you worried ESPN will fire you
from 'Around the Horn' for criticizing its decision to interview
Simpson as part of the Heisman hype?"</TE>
<TE>   I don' think worried is the right word.</TE>

<HD>FIFA Reallocates World Cup Berths</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The World Cup received a major shake up Tuesday when the executive
committee of FIFA voted to reallocate the 32 berths available in the
quadrennial world championship among its six continental
confederations.</LD>
<LD>   The big winner was Oceania, whose qualifying winner, starting with
the 2006 World Cup in Germany, will be given direct entry to the
tournament.</LD>
<LD>   The decision almost certainly means that Australia or New Zealand
will play regularly in World Cups, they being the dominant powers in
the region.</LD>
<TE>   Also coming out ahead were Asia and CONCACAF, each of which was
allocated an extra half-berth. That means Asia's fifth-place team
will play CONCACAF's fourth-place finisher for a berth in the World
Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The losers were Europe and South America, which each gave up half
a place.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new format, Germany 2006 will feature 14 European
nations, including the host; five African nations; four South America
nations, not necessarily including Brazil, since the defending
champion no longer qualifies automatically; four Asian nations; three
CONCACAF nations and one Oceania nation, leaving one place to be
contested in an Asian-CONCACAF playoff.</TE>
<TE>   Arena Signs</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Soccer announced that Bruce Arena would remain as the men's
national team coach through the 2006 World Cup. Terms were not
revealed, but one report indicated that Arena, 51, would be paid
$750,000 a year on a four-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   "In our mind, there was never a question," said S. Robert
Contiguglia, U.S. Soccer's president. "He was the right man for the
job when we hired him in 1998, and he is the right man for the job
today."</TE>
<TE>   Arena's record with the U.S. team is 34-18-14, a .621 winning
percentage. He coached the team to victory in the 2002 CONCACAF Gold
Cup and to the quarterfinals of the 2002 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   USA Ranked 10th</TE>
<TE>   The Netherlands' 3-1 victory over Germany in November vaulted the
Dutch from 10th to sixth place in the final FIFA world rankings for
2002, bumping England, Mexico, Turkey and the United States down a
notch each.</TE>
<TE>   The top 10: Brazil, 856 points; France, 787; Spain, 779; Germany,
761; Argentina, 751; Netherlands, 746; England, 734; Mexico, 732;
Turkey, 729, and the U.S. 10th at 723.</TE>
<TE>   Hamm, Ronaldo Win</TE>
<TE>   U.S. women's national team forward Mia Hamm and Brazilian striker
Ronaldo were named the FIFA World Players of the Year for 2002 in a
vote by national team coaches worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   For Hamm, it was the second such honor, the Washington Freedom
player having won the inaugural award last year. She received 161
points and finished ahead of Germany's Birgit Prinz with 96 and
China's Sun Wen with 58.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tremendous honor, a dream come true," Hamm said at the
12th annual FIFA Gala in Madrid. "In the U.S., we try to sell the
game of soccer. To tell people about this will be marvelous."</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo became the first three-time winner, having been selected
the world's best player in 1996 and 1997.</TE>
<TE>   He received 387 points, 59 of 148 voting coaches choosing him as
their top player.</TE>
<TE>   German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn was second with 171 points, and
French midfielder Zinedine Zidane third with 148.</TE>
<TE>   Scolari Debut</TE>
<TE>   Luiz Felipe Scolari, who led Brazil to the World Cup and
officially took over as coach of Portugal on Sunday, will make his
debut on Feb. 12 when Portugal plays Italy in Genoa. The Italian team
last played in the port city in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   UEFA Fines</TE>
<TE>   The soccer federation of Slovakia was fined $42,000 and England's
was fined $14,000 by UEFA for the misbehavior of their fans during a
2004 European Championship qualifying game on Oct. 12 in Bratislava,
Slovakia.</TE>
<TE>   Slovakia was fined for the racist abuse its fans directed at
England's Ashley Cole and Emile Heskey. England was fined for
improper conduct after its fans fought with Slovakian police.</TE>
<TE>   Quick Passes</TE>
<TE>   FIFA appointed former Swiss investment banker Urs Linsi, 53, as
its general secretary. Linsi had been FIFA's financial director and
the deputy to Michel Zen-Ruffinen, who was fired as general secretary
in June by FIFA President Joseph "Sepp" Blatter, whom he had accused
of corruption.... Antonio Pimenta Machado, chairman of the Portuguese
team Vitoria Guimaraes, was released on $1.03-million bail in Lisbon
pending trial on charges of embezzlement and forging documents.</TE>
<TE>   China announced that it was in contract talks with Dutchman Arie
Haan to become its national team coach. The announcement was made
less than a month after Haan had denounced such reports as "lies and
fabrications." ... French national team defender Mikael Silvestre,
25, signed a four-year contract that will keep him at Manchester
United until 2007.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It would have been a bigger deal if Pepperdine had gotten the
opportunity to play nationally ranked Stanford for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the Waves are happy to be going home with some hardware.</LD>
<LD>   Freshman David Patten scored a career-high 19 points to lead five
players in double figures as Pepperdine defeated Montana, 86-69, in
the championship of the Stanford Invitational on Tuesday at Palo
Alto.</LD>
<TE>   It was Patten's first time scoring in double digits.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I picked a good time to have my breakout game," the
6-foot-8 Patten said. "It's by far the best game I've ever had."</TE>
<TE>   Boomer Brazzle added 12 points and a career-high 14 rebounds for
the Waves (5-3), who won for the fifth time in six games. Jimmy
Miggins had 17 points and Terrance Johnson and Mike Westphal each had
11.</TE>
<TE>   The Grizzlies (4-7) had a difficult time finding any offensive
rhythm a day after shooting 47% and committing only nine turnovers
against Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Montana shocked the No. 17 Cardinal, 70-68, in Monday night's
first round on a last-second three-pointer by David Bell.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford lost in the first round of its own tournament for the
first time in 12 years, and the Cardinal had won the past seven
titles. Pepperdine is the only team in the West Coast Conference that
Stanford has never played.</TE>
<TE>   St. Mary's 79, UC Riverside 74 -- Tyler Herr scored a game-high 24
points to lead St. Mary's in a nonconference victory over UC
Riverside in a game that was delayed by 70 minutes because of a power
failure on the St. Mary's campus at Moraga.</TE>
<TE>   St. Mary's (5-3) remained undefeated at home this season. Nate
Carter scored 17 points to lead Riverside (1-3).</TE>

<HD>UCLA Cut Down to Size</HD>
<DH>Bruins suffer another embarrassing defeat, this time to
Northern Arizona, 67-63, at Pauley Pavilion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was supposed to be tune-up time for UCLA, one final try before the
Kansas game to sharpen skills and perfect plays against an
overmatched nonconference team that prides itself on its motto,
"Recruit to shoot" and generally keeps to itself in a small town in
Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   What it turned out to be was another patch of problems, another
night of nothing for UCLA, which lost to Northern Arizona, 67-63,
before 5,736 fast-exiting fans Tuesday at Pauley Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   This, against a team that lost to Arizona by 35 a few weeks ago
and got beaten by a college named High Point in its season opener.</LD>
<TE>   Mix in the Lumberjacks' injury woes -- only nine players suited up
against UCLA -- and it became obvious why the crowd at half-empty
Pauley was terribly unenthused as the final seconds ticked down.</TE>
<TE>   With the Bruins trailing by three, Jason Kapono's three-point
attempt with five seconds left rattled off the front of the rim and
UCLA found itself once again trying to explain an unexpected loss.</TE>
<TE>   Two exhibition losses followed by losses to University of San
Diego and Duke were supposed to be a part of the past after the
Bruins (2-3) had won their last two games by a combined 61 points,
but a subdued second half against Northern Arizona guaranteed nothing
more than a loss.</TE>
<TE>   Before the season, UCLA had lost only eight nonconference games at
home since 1989, but dropped its second at Pauley Pavilion in three
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Northern Arizona eradicated a 32-26 halftime deficit with
brilliant outside shooting, making nine of 13 three-pointers in the
second half. UCLA's perimeter defense, slack throughout most of the
game, left the Bruins slack-jawed afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all guilty on the defensive end, not finding guys," said
UCLA forward T.J. Cummings, who had 16 points and made six of seven
shots. "When those shots are getting up, we need to get out there."</TE>
<TE>   Northern Arizona (6-2) was without three injured players.</TE>
<TE>   On Northern Arizona's bench, guys in coats and ties almost doubled
the number of the reserves. But nobody was laughing on the UCLA bench
when the game ended.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fact that Northern Arizona's tallest player was 6 feet
7, UCLA was outrebounded, 28-25. Kapono finished with 12 points on
four-of-10 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's discouraging because I thought we made progress [recently],
but we slipped back tonight," UCLA Coach Steve Lavin said. "They
played a more mature game than we did."</TE>
<TE>   Dijon Thompson was again effective in his third game as a reserve,
with 14 points and six rebounds. Other than that, it was a night to
forget.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, these types of nights have been accruing since the
first exhibition loss.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we've got our heads too low because we've already
been here," Cummings said.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA went almost four minutes before scoring its first point and
trailed, 16-13, midway through the first half before taking temporary
control with a 10-0 run.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the Lumberjacks' second-half shooting spree.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle Feuerbach was four of five in the second half from
three-point range. Kelly Golob made two of two.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Recruit to shoot' is what we live on," said Northern Arizona
Coach Mike Adras. "It's on our media guides, our posters, our
schedule cards. We preach it and we go out and do it."</TE>
<TE>   Northern Arizona forward Ryan McDade led with 22 points, making 10
of 16 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas, UCLA's opponent on Saturday, is waiting eagerly.</TE>
<TE>   The Jayhawks, who lost to UCLA last season, 87-77, could use a
victory against a big-name opponent after losing to North Carolina,
Florida and Oregon this season.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas will mark Lavin's 200th game as UCLA's coach.</TE>
<TE>   "If your heart isn't pumping, if you can't feel the adrenaline
[against Kansas], you must be dead," Cummings said. "That'll be one
of those big-time games you go to college for."</TE>

<HD>Now Guerrero Will Make Call</HD>
<DH>UCLA conducts interviews with Dorrell and Robinson, and
Riley is contacted again, but no offer has been made.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A tightly focused eight-day search for a UCLA football coach is
expected to yield a choice from three NFL assistants who interviewed
with campus decision-makers the last two days.</LD>
<LD>   Denver Bronco receivers coach Karl Dorrell and Kansas City Chief
defensive coordinator Greg Robinson met Tuesday with the same small
group of UCLA administrators who interviewed New Orleans Saint
secondary coach Mike Riley on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Riley is considered the leader because he was the first candidate
targeted by Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, who flew to New Orleans
the same day Bob Toledo was fired after seven seasons. Riley said
UCLA contacted him by telephone Tuesday but did not make an offer.</LD>
<TE>   Dorrell and Robinson said they felt positive about their standing
after interviews at the home of Chancellor Albert Carnesale. Both
coaches, reached moments before boarding flights home, said no offer
was made.</TE>
<TE>   Said Dorrell: "They said they are considering me strongly but will
go through the process. I'm receptive to that, and I'm eager to see
how it develops.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them I want to redirect the program to get back to an
acceptable level of achievement and demonstrate the discipline,
toughness and integrity the program should have."</TE>
<TE>   Said Robinson: "Everything went well, but nothing was determined.
I don't want to speculate because I don't want to put anybody in an
awkward position. They made me do most of the talking."</TE>
<TE>   The interviews were the second for each of the coaches. Athletic
program sources said Guerrero has complete authority to make the
decision after gaining input from Carnesale and Vice Chancellor Peter
Blackman. Guerrero attended UCLA's basketball game Tuesday night and
refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Dan's call," a source with intricate knowledge of the
situation said. "This is his first big hire and he is free to make
it."</TE>
<TE>   The candidates possess vastly different backgrounds yet have a
common thread: They are as singularly focused on landing the UCLA job
as the school apparently is on hiring one of them.</TE>
<TE>   And any of the three is expected to accept the anticipated offer
of $700,000 to $800,000 a year, plus incentives.</TE>
<TE>   Riley, 49, turned down a lucrative offer last week from Alabama,
his alma mater, partly because he wanted to remain in the running at
UCLA. He is the only candidate with head coaching experience,
although his record of 22-48 with the San Diego Chargers and Oregon
State is not exactly overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   Most of his experience is as an offensive coach.</TE>
<TE>   Dorrell, 39, is a former Bruin receiver whose ascent in the
coaching ranks includes stints as an offensive coordinator at
Colorado and Washington. He is in his third year with the Broncos and
was a finalist to become head coach at San Diego State last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike Shanahan has been more of an influence on me than anybody,"
he said. "He runs a well-organized football organization."</TE>
<TE>   Many former Bruin players support Dorrell, especially those who
played under Terry Donahue in the 1980s. He would be a bold choice
because he would become only the fourth African-American coach in
Division I.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be [considered for other jobs]," he said "This is
the only opportunity that means a lot to me. UCLA is very dear to
me."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, 51, is in his eighth year as an NFL defensive
coordinator and his second with the Chiefs. An astute tactician with
a fiery nature, he was with the Broncos during Super Bowl victories
in 1997 and 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson was a candidate when Toledo was hired after the 1995
season but was not invited to UCLA for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I've followed the team closely," he said. "I'm from Los Angeles
and I still have a strong interest in what goes on there. UCLA is a
very special place for me."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Field, an assistant athletic director and longtime Bruin
assistant coach, is considered Guerrero's football advisor and sat in
on every interview.</TE>
<TE>   Field knows each candidate well. He was a young assistant at
Alabama when Riley played there in the early 1970s. He coached
alongside Robinson at UCLA in the 1980s, when Dorrell was a star
Bruin receiver.</TE>
<TE>   But the decision is in Guerrero's hands now. And its outcome will
set the course for the athletic director's budding legacy as well as
for Bruin football.</TE>

Conference selected to the 25-player team. Arizona State defensive
end Terrell Suggs, the Lombardi Award winner as the nation's top
lineman, was the only repeat selection. Washington State defensive
tackle Rien Long, winner of the Outland Trophy as the top interior
lineman, and Washington receiver Reggie Williams also were selected.</LD>
<TE>   The Big Ten led all conferences with seven All-Americans,
including three from Ohio State -- safety Mike Doss, linebacker Matt
Wilhelm and kicker Mike Nugent.</TE>
<TE>   USC, Iowa and Oklahoma each had two.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa quarterback Brad Banks, AP's player of the year, was selected
to the second team.</TE>

<HD>Pension Fund Is About to Go the Way of Your 401(k)</HD>
<DH>Bush administration is helping to replace nest eggs with
lumps of coal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the holiday season, boom time for pickpockets. We're busy, we're
distracted and we're in a mood to think about fellowship, not
felonies. Everything's right for Light-Fingered Louie making his move
in Washington. We barely notice until later that we've been robbed.</LD>
<LD>   Merry Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration and its pals in the corporate suites are
pulling off just such a filch right now. In a truly mean-spirited
retreat from the principles of hard work and loyalty, they're setting
up a raid on middle-class pensions.</LD>
<TE>   "Radical. Anti-worker," fumed Rep. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.). He
calls it another assault by "Enron culture" CEOs whose campaign
contributions hold sway in the administration. "It is going to cost
employees dearly," warned his California Democrat colleague Rep.
George Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the General Accounting Office projected that workers could
wind up with reductions of 20% to 50% in the monthly pensions they
worked for and planned for.</TE>
<TE>   At stake are the futures of millions of American families and
billions of dollars they thought they earned. But unless they are
attentive, they might not notice what's missing for a few years. By
then the perpetrators would be lounging at their private yacht clubs
and island resorts. Because you can bet that executives are licking
their chops this holiday for the chance to inflate their own bonuses
by trimming the "expense" of retirement payments for their workforce.</TE>
<TE>   Business executives call their dodge the "cash-balance" pension.
It works something like this: They get the cash, and we get the
balance.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of companies are expected to begin converting their
traditional, fixed-benefit retirement plans to these "cash-balance"
alternatives as soon as the proposed regulations take effect, after a
three-month comment period.</TE>
<TE>   A few years back, the idea of doing away with traditional
retirement plans in favor of cash-balance pensions caught on in a big
way, and as many as 700 companies imposed the switch on their 8
million or so workers. But they ran into trouble. Employees began to
understand what was happening: Older, long-term workers realized that
they were the targets. And why not? They were the ones about to
retire and put a drain on company profits. They began filing lawsuits
and complaints, and the Clinton administration imposed a moratorium
on the swindle.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Bush administration has called for an end to the
moratorium and, further, is offering corporations a shield against
worker challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the cash-balance idea would have us believe that it
would modernize the pension system for the benefit of younger workers
who no longer make a career at a single company. They would be
allowed to carry the accumulated cash balance of their pensions from
job to job.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, however, employees still must work at a company for five
years before vesting, meaning that many highly mobile young people
wouldn't receive any benefit after all. Besides, the logic of
business suddenly developing a soft spot for its newest employees is
transparently bogus. Why in the world would companies want to favor
workers who have proved no loyalty over those who have? Simple:
Promising the world to 25-year-olds defers costs into the future.
Then, who cares? Someone else would have to worry about quarterly
profits, bonuses and devising some new pension "reform" to renege on
those obligations.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, it's the 40- to 55-year-old workers who companies must
deal with. And cash-balance pensions as allowed by the Bush
administration would do a nasty job of it. First, companies would be
given wide latitude in determining the cash value of pensions earned
thus far by their long-term workers. Then companies could sharply
reduce gains to this value and legally claim that they are not
discriminating by age -- even though the intended outcome would only
be to reduce benefits for older workers.</TE>
<TE>   Basically, employers would not have to honor their promise to the
baby boomer generation. During the switch from one type of plan to
another, employers could wriggle out of their commitment to base
roughly one-third of worker pensions on wages earned in the first
half of employment and two-thirds earned during the second half. That
was envisioned as the means to reward loyalty and service. But now at
mid-career, when steadfast employees should be earning the most
toward their eventual pensions, they could find themselves gaining
nothing for years to come, and then no faster than the newest
employee on the payroll.</TE>
<TE>   The net effect, depending on how hard-headed companies choose to
be, could reduce a $2,000 traditional pension to $1,000 monthly,
according to congressional investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Friedman, policy director of the independent Pension Rights
Center, says the effect of the regulations would be to force more
businesses, even those not inclined to punish their loyal workers,
into cash-balance conversions just to keep up with cutthroat
competitors. "They are encouraging companies to do the wrong thing."</TE>
<TE>   There was a time, and it wasn't so long ago, when conservatives
voiced the idea that American values meant keeping faith with those
who, as Ronald Reagan put it, "worked hard and played by the rules."
Makes you nostalgic, doesn't it?</TE>

<HD>The 13th Juror</HD>
<DH>TV can shine a light on secret jury deliberations</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John M. Parras</AU>
<BD>John M. Parras is the lead attorney for "Frontline" in
the Harrison case.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Critics of the court decision to allow "Frontline" to record jury
deliberations in the Cedric Harrison case say they are concerned
about the sanctity of the jury room in a death penalty trial. They
argue that allowing cameras inside the jury room would turn the most
serious of decisions into a form of reality television in which
jurors will "grandstand" for the cameras. But experience proves
otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Ted Poe's decision has been sensationalized and
mischaracterized and was not capricious. As a former prosecutor, he
tried eight death cases. He has presided over 15 capital cases. Poe
understands and respects the power of the state, the severity of the
penalty and the absolute requirement for the integrity of the
process. Neither is there any reason to believe that the defendant's
rights are being compromised. The defendant, his mother and defense
counsel all consented to the filming and agreed not to use it as a
basis for any appeal. The defense lawyer explained it this way: "If
the state of Texas wants to attempt to execute a 17-year-old, I think
the whole world should be watching."</LD>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the district attorney appealed Poe's decision,
arguing that "the desire to appear on a 'Survivor'-style reality
television series should not be an added qualification for jury
service." His alarmist tone was soon echoed by the media nationwide,
which argued that that the film had only "superficial appeal" and
repeatedly compared the case to reality television.</TE>
<TE>   "Reality" television places people in contrived or trivial
situations for the entertainment of the public. At a time when the
death penalty is under nationwide review, nothing could be more
important or less trivial than understanding how 12 people decide
whether a fellow citizen should live or die.</TE>
<TE>   Editorials across the country have claimed that cameras have
"never been allowed in a jury room." Not true. PBS, CBS and ABC have
all filmed jury deliberations in criminal trials, including murder
trials. And last week, the Colorado Supreme Court agreed to allow ABC
to film jury deliberations in upcoming criminal trials, saying: "We
believe that we do have a responsibility to educate the public about
what really goes on in the courts and criminal trials specifically."</TE>
<TE>   Critics have also suggested that having a camera in the jury room
will affect the decision the jurors reach, either making them more
(or, others argue, less) likely to convict: "Jurors, especially less
educated and articulate ones, may be wary of speaking out if they
know they are being judged," one editorial claimed. But interviews
with jurors who have been filmed deliberating indicate that the
filming had no discernable effect on their deliberations or verdicts.</TE>
<TE>   "Frontline" had filmed for three days before proceedings were
halted to decide the camera issue. Only 14 of 110 potential jurors
expressed reservations about being filmed and were excused without
objection by either side. The remaining 90% told the court that the
cameras would not affect their deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   Our criminal justice system functions on the premise that jurors
will follow the law. We trust jurors when they tell us that they will
be fair and impartial and that they will ignore inadmissible
evidence. Why are jurors discounted in this instance?</TE>
<TE>   When asked by a juror why he was allowing the trial to be filmed,
Poe said: The "more the public can know about the truth, the way
things really are, the better we are as a people. And the system
benefits from this."</TE>
<TE>   Poe's decision has forced us to weigh the tension between the
assumption that "secret" jury deliberations are necessary for a fair
trial versus the idea that our democracy will be better served --
especially in matters of life and death -- if we know, every so often
and under scrupulous judicial supervision, what is happening behind
closed doors, even in the jury room.</TE>

<HD>Reflecting the New Face of S. Korea</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Snyder</AU>
<BD>Scott Snyder is the Korea representative of the Asia
Foundation. The opinions expressed here are his own.</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>South Korean voters choose a new president Thursday for a five-year
term. The new leader must protect South Korea's hard-won economic
prosperity while resolving perhaps the most far-reaching political
and security challenges since the Korean War.</LD>
<LD>   After a deeply divisive campaign, the new president must determine
the future of South Korea's relationship with the United States, end
North Korea's nuclear weapons threat, lay the foundations for
inter-Korean economic integration and peaceful coexistence and
promote regional cooperation as a means to guarantee South Korea's
security and prosperity.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign has pitted opposition party candidate Lee Hoi Chang,
a conservative former prosecutor and former prime minister with an
elite educational background and social connections, against
President Kim Dae Jung's populist ruling party successor, Roh Moo
Hyun, a progressive self-educated lawyer and former labor activist.</LD>
<TE>   The campaign has exposed and deepened generational and ideological
divisions that must be overcome to effectively meet the many
challenges.</TE>
<TE>   The nature of South Korea's security relationship with the U.S.
has become a divisive focal point in the presidential campaign amid
growing public protests after the November acquittals of two American
soldiers in U.S. military court for a vehicle accident that killed
two South Korean middle-school girls. An early task for South Korea's
new president will be to stabilize the relationship, restore
effective communication and mutual trust at the highest levels and
reaffirm his commitment to future security and political cooperation
with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The ability of South Korea and the U.S. to coordinate their
approaches in dealing with North Korea's renewed nuclear ambitions
will determine the durability and effectiveness of the alliance. The
formation of an international coalition to deny economic support to
North Korea as punishment for its nuclear weapons efforts depends in
substantial part on Seoul's policies. South Korea's citizenry
supports a negotiated resolution of the current standoff and opposes
hard-line policies that may risk their immediate security.</TE>
<TE>   Based on this public consensus, South Korea's new leader may
endorse the nonproliferation objectives of the Bush administration as
a prerequisite for continued economic engagement with the North, but
in return he may seek stepped-up diplomatic efforts involving
Washington, Seoul and Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration should not further risk alliance
deterioration by defying South Korean public expectations that their
elected leader's views be considered as those of a full partner.</TE>
<TE>   In line with likely security developments in the region, the next
South Korean leadership may seek to redefine bilateral security ties
with the U.S., including reductions in U.S. troops stationed in
Korea. South Korea's rapidly expanding regional economic ties have
lessened its overall dependence on the U.S. The younger generation
has interpreted this continued security dependence as humiliating and
anachronistic.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for the U.S. is to adjust to South Korea's need for
a more balanced and multifaceted political/security orientation,
given its complex economic relationships in the region. South Korea's
rapid industrialization and global leadership in many key economic
sectors has allowed Seoul for the first time to shape the nation's
future and expand its ties with China, Japan, Russia and the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's new president must consolidate public support and
deploy this newfound economic and political influence to transform
the inter-Korean standoff, constructively influence regional security
and enhance multilateral economic and political cooperation. The
choices he makes will determine whether South Korea is able to retain
the security and prosperity it now enjoys.</TE>

<HD>The 13th Juror</HD>
<DH>Cameras are too intrusive and might affect verdicts</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Turley</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley is a law professor at George Washington
Law School.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Texas, justice is about to go prime time. Unless reversed by an
appellate court, state Judge Ted Poe of Houston has agreed to allow
the PBS show "Frontline" to film jury deliberations in the capital
case of 17-year-old accused murderer Cedric Harrison. Though there is
little question that it will make for good TV, it will hardly make
for good justice.</LD>
<LD>   In the age of "reality" TV, it was inevitable that filming jury
deliberations and executions would become an increasing goal for
producers. If tens of millions of viewers are willing to sit through
weeks of insipid deliberations of whether to vote dingbats off an
island in "Survivor," consider the viewership for deliberations to
vote a human off the planet in a capital murder case. The judge could
deliver the final verdict with the jurors gathered in the tense
moment of truth: "We have decided to put your torch out, Cedric --
pending appeal to either the Supreme Court or network management."</LD>
<LD>   Filming of trials began with the 1935 Lindbergh trial, but jury
deliberations have been treated as sacrosanct and secret for hundreds
of years. The jury room is considered a unique space, protected from
the influences of the outside world.</LD>
<TE>   As captured in the classic 1957 film "Twelve Angry Men," it is a
realm that often leads to difficult discussions that can reveal as
much about individual jurors as the defendant. It is raw, spontaneous
and at times heated, but it has proved unparalleled in its ability to
mete out justice fairly and blindly.</TE>
<TE>   Poe is not the first to confuse public entertainment with public
justice. PBS filmed jury deliberations in 1986 in Wisconsin and, in
1997, CBS persuaded an Arizona judge to allow it to film four
criminal trials. Now, with Texas, it is clear that, absent
legislation or a ruling to the contrary, we could see this
most-protected area of the criminal justice system fall to the
insatiable demand of reality television.</TE>
<TE>   The dangers to our justice system are obvious and great. Jurors
who are aware that they are being filmed may be less likely to voice
their true sentiments or, in the worse cases, their doubts. In some
cases, jurors may harbor racist, anti-Semitic or other forms of bias
that can only be dealt with if brought into the open.</TE>
<TE>   In a high-profile case, frank deliberations are even less likely.
Faced with a highly unpopular defendant, jurors may be unwilling to
be publicly seen as defending the accused. In such cases, the only
hope for an unpopular defendant is that the secrecy of the
deliberations will allow jurors to transcend the pressure for
retribution and demand proof beyond a reasonable doubt for
conviction.</TE>
<TE>   None of this means that television is inherently opposed to the
interests of justice. The Constitution contemplates that trials are
public, and the addition of television is a valuable extension of
public access. It allows a greater number of citizens to monitor the
conduct of the state in prosecuting citizens in their name and can
deter abuse by the government. However, in jury deliberations such
review becomes the enemy and not the protector of fair justice by
exposing jurors to public ridicule or backlash.</TE>
<TE>   There are obviously many people with a good-faith interest in how
jury deliberations operate. However, there is a library of actual
deliberations -- from limited filming in past cases -- for study. Any
remaining interest in filming seems less virtuous than it is
vicarious.</TE>
<TE>   From live Internet sites to the Osbourne family, we have come to
relish the position of the unseen interloper. We have now turned to
our justice system for new exciting outlets.</TE>
<TE>   Given past rulings, it is clear that we cannot rely on judges to
resist the temptation of producing a made-for-TV trial. It will
depend on citizens to stop this practice. Perhaps it is the ultimate
test of the citizen couch potato: We can get up and stop this
practice or just sit back and watch our justice system join the
Osbournes and "Fear Factor" in our collective cultural de-evolution.</TE>

<KH>STANDING UP TO STREET GANGS</KH>
<HD>Minced Words and Mayhem</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A two-pronged approach -- cops and community -- is central to city
leaders' efforts to stop young street criminals from killing each
other and anyone who gets in the way. But you would never know this
from the predictable outcry against Los Angeles Police Chief William
J. Bratton.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Bratton and Mayor James K. Hahn marshaled a force of
federal agencies in his battle against the gangs responsible for half
of the city's 639 homicides this year.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, a handful of critics is waging a war on words, and a
selective war at that. The new chief is sending the wrong message,
they complain, by calling gang activity "homeland terrorism,"
admonishing parents to "control your kids" and exhorting the city to
"get angry" about gang shootings. We'd predicted on the chief's first
day that self-proclaimed experts who have spent years failing to
solve the gang problem would attack whatever he tried. We didn't
expect that the mayor would so quickly fret that the "bottom line" is
to be "careful about our choice of words."</LD>
<TE>   Hahn, who hired Bratton and has made quelling violent crime his
priority, knows that the real bottom line is a mother sobbing over
her dead 14-year-old, his college dreams shattered by a bullet. Last
month in South Los Angeles alone, this street war cost 20 lives
within a three-week stretch.</TE>
<TE>   If Hahn wants to regain the African American support he lost when
he dumped former Chief Bernard C. Parks, he can do so by slowing the
murder rate, not by attending to the semantic sensitivities of Urban
League President John Mack and Ken Lombard, president of Earvin
"Magic" Johnson's development company.</TE>
<TE>   Crime-busters have for too long split into irreconcilable camps:
jobs versus jail. Bratton and Hahn seem committed to marrying the
two.</TE>
<TE>   But the same activists who challenge the chief's choice of words
when describing the sociopathic criminals who blow holes in human
flesh and -- yes -- terrorize whole neighborhoods somehow tune out
Bratton's unequivocal condemnation of past LAPD brutality and racial
profiling, his emphasis on smart, focused policing. He's practically
been pleading for community help in restoring the peace, but his
critics only focus on the word "war."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, others hear his full message. As of Tuesday, there
had been just one homicide in South Los Angeles this month. And
residents, long silenced by fear, are talking, producing leads in
nine unsolved homicides. Those are the words that matter.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The past, the present and the best possible future of free trade in
the Americas came fortuitously together last week in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   First, former leaders of Canada, the United States and Mexico
gathered to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the signing of the
successful North American Free Trade Agreement. Even more important,
negotiators from the United States and Chile wrapped up negotiations
for a long-promised free-trade agreement between the two countries.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, at the White House, President Bush met with Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva, Brazil's newly elected president. These two countries
will co-chair talks next year to establish a Free Trade Agreement of
the Americas by 2005.</LD>
<TE>   The agreement with Chile, which seems certain to be approved by
Congress, would eliminate tariffs on 85% of goods immediately and on
all goods within 12 years. President Clinton promised the deal seven
years ago, but it had to wait for the so-called fast-track
negotiating authority that Congress finally granted Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The measure would allow U.S. financial, communications and
insurance companies into Chile and establish a secure and predictable
legal framework for U.S. investors. Neither country can weaken
environmental protections to encourage investment. Both countries
have pledged to observe internationally recognized labor standards.</TE>
<TE>   NAFTA illustrates the net gain likely to occur. Yes, some
companies did shift manufacturing jobs to cheaper Mexican labor. As
former President Bush said at the anniversary celebration, since it
went into effect in 1994, "350,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in
the U.S. ... but 2 million better-paying jobs were created." There
was no "giant sucking sound."</TE>
<TE>   Consider this. To sell one of its U.S.-made tractors in Chile
today, Caterpillar Inc. would have to pay $13,090 in tariffs. Once
the free-trade agreement is signed, that same tractor enters Chile
tariff-free.</TE>
<TE>   The big story is still being written. To unite the economies of 34
countries in the Western Hemisphere into a single free-trade zone
presents much bigger challenges. Some nations are industrialized and
others poor and mainly agricultural. Education levels vary wildly.
Engaging Brazil, with the largest economy in the Southern Hemisphere,
will be essential to pulling in the rest and determining how poorer
nations can be helped to join.</TE>
<TE>   After his meeting with Bush, Lula, as the Brazilian president is
widely known, told reporters he favors aggressive free-trade policies
-- a turnabout from his fiery protectionist past. He urged the United
States to end subsidies and trade barriers that keep Latin American
farm products, such as Brazilian orange juice, from U.S. buyers.</TE>
<TE>   With NAFTA running smoothly and a trade deal with Chile at hand,
the U.S. can focus on Brazil as the next steppingstone to a regional
trade deal.</TE>

<LD>In the increasingly complex world of corporate finance, quarterly
earnings reports are the equivalent of short-term weather forecasts
that ignore savage winter storms building over the Pacific Ocean.
Yes, investors deserve to know where the company is heading. But what
good is a rosy fourth-quarter report if the company jeopardizes its
long-term financial health to finance it?</LD>
<LD>   Coca-Cola Corp. endorsed that longer-term view a few days ago,
saying it would no longer generate quarterly earnings forecasts for
Wall Street analysts. By refusing to feed Wall Street's insatiable
demand for "earnings guidance," one of the country's most familiar
brands has joined Intel Corp., Gillette Co. and the handful of
respected companies on a frustratingly short list of publicly traded
companies that view earnings forecasts as doing more harm than good.</LD>
<LD>   Quarterly reports also can hide more than they reveal. Executives
know how to understate expectations during tough times and hold back
some of the good news when times are good. And, too often, earnings
predictions become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Once estimates are
made public, executives are under intense pressure to slash operating
costs to hit the quarterly target.</LD>
<TE>   That short-term mentality can hurt shareholders in other ways.
Managers and workers at non-financial Standard &amp; Poor's 500
businesses netted more than $100 billion during 2000 from stock
options, according to Business Week magazine. Call it a clear case of
management by objective -- the goal being to focus on short-term
results in order to produce a pot of gold at the end of the options
rainbow.</TE>
<TE>   No one will mistake Warren Buffett, Coca-Cola's largest single
shareholder -- who also is on the Gillette board -- for a short-term
player. Buffett is chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which has
long refused to play the earnings estimate game. This year Buffett
persuaded Coca-Cola to list employee stock options as an expense so
shareholders know the costs upfront.</TE>
<TE>   If companies abandon their "best guesses" about the near-term
profit picture, industry analysts will have to work harder to divine
which companies deserve "buy" recommendations. Good. Let them earn
their keep by researching the fundamental ways companies are run.
Investors will have to expand their investment horizons. Also good
because the longer-term focus should lead to less-volatile markets.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy is not without loopholes. Abandoning short-term
earnings predictions won't benefit shareholders if corporations
instead try to obfuscate potential problems further down the road.
But it does remove some of the temptations to which companies like
Enron Corp. succumbed.</TE>

<LD>Re "Cardinal Law Steps Down, Apologizes for 'Mistakes,' " Dec. 14: It
is appropriate that Cardinal Bernard Law has resigned. He actively
sought to cover up felonies carried out by priests within his diocese
and enabled these same felons to relocate their activities to another
parish. He did not tell the truth, he did not take his knowledge of
these felonies to the police, he did not protect the children, and
this cover-up continued over a period of years. In short, he was an
effective accomplice to a great many child molesters.</LD>
<LD>   Acting to avoid scandal, he apparently did not stop to ask what
Jesus would have done. Would Jesus have ignored the child victims and
protected pedophile predators simply to protect a hierarchy that is
clearly far removed from its constituents?</LD>
<LD>   This cannot be hidden behind a cassock. If you or I had done these
things, we would be in prison.</LD>

<TE>   The long overdue and gratefully received resignation of Cardinal
Law signals that healing and a rebuilding of trust may at last become
possible in the Boston Archdiocese. From a vantage point on the other
coast, one turns one's eyes toward our own cardinal and wonders what
real differences there might be between his conduct and that of his
recently resigned brother in the East. Doesn't it seem that the
differences are not of kind, but, at best, only of degree?</TE>
<TE>   Don't we in Los Angeles also have 58 men of the cloth who
understand that, in his refusal to accept responsibility for his
abysmal failure to discharge his moral duties, Cardinal Roger Mahony
presents the same stubborn, intolerable obstacle to healing and
reconciliation as did Cardinal Law?</TE>
<TE>   Mahony's empty apologies and the wretched litany of "extenuating
circumstances" he has deployed in the attempt to deflect
responsibility from himself continue to hang in the air like a foul
stench. Mahony's ability to lead is as fully discredited as Law's.
Clergy and laity should unite in insisting upon his immediate
resignation.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bolstering Arab Reforms," editorial, Dec. 16: Shouldn't policy
proposals have some basis in reality? Your editorial makes some
astonishing assumptions about the prospective benefits of U.S.
funding for additional education for girls in Arab countries. It
assumes that an Arab country can be found that will permit foreign,
let alone U.S., interference in its Muslim-oriented educational
system. Then it assumes that, because girls would get a better
education, the men who control everything will grant them
opportunities. Both assumptions have a low prospect of happening.</LD>
<TE>   Your editorial further wisely states that "the best prospect for
Middle East peace remains an end to the killing." The Palestinian
Authority claims no control over Hamas, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, Hezbollah, Tanzim and other assorted "militant" groups.
Every one of these groups publicly vows to continue fighting -- not
until there is a Palestinian state but until Israel no longer exists.
Even if one more Arab state is established along with the other 22
Arab states, their killing will not stop. For Israel, peace is not
the establishment of a Palestinian state but the end of killing. What
is there for the diplomats to ask of Israel to negotiate, when for so
many militant Arabs the minimum terms to stop the killing require the
end of the "Zionist entity"?</TE>

<TE>   Secretary of State Colin Powell's initiative to help reform
economic, political and educational systems in the Arab world will
fall on deaf ears unless the Bush administration improves its image
by taking a more balanced approach to the Palestinian question. Most
studies indicate a declining image of the U.S. in the Arab and Muslim
world. Such a decline could reverse itself if we put more pressure on
the Israelis and Palestinians to come to a peaceful solution.
Improving the educational and political systems are the last things
on the minds of the Arabs, who see the homeless Palestinians as a
much more pressing issue.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Carter Is Willing to Mediate Mideast Peace Talks if Asked,"
Dec. 13: How interesting that a Nobel Peace Prize winner declares his
willingness to play mediator with regard to Middle East peace
negotiations and then proceeds to declare that the U.S. failure to
obtain a peace agreement is because the country is too pro-Israel. Is
it any wonder why his administration will probably go down in history
as one of the most ineffectual and weak presidencies -- after reading
such a declaration of desire to act as mediator? Imagine: the U.S.
acting too much in favor of a democracy.</TE>

<LD>The analogies used by Michael Wolfstone (letter, Dec. 15) to
criticize The Times' Dec. 11 editorial, "Cheney Wins, Public Loses,"
miss the mark. It is absurd to accord a high-level government group
tasked with formulating national energy policy the same right to
secret deliberations as that given to planners of military strategy
or the board of directors of a private corporation, as Wolfstone
apparently does. Vice President Dick Cheney's group was to help in
the formulation of energy policy, a nonclassified matter whose
drafting is of manifest interest to the citizenry. In a government
whose workings are supposed to be maximally transparent, it is
clearly undesirable and, one hopes, unnecessary to solicit secret
advice from those deemed to be experts on the issue under study. If,
as Cheney has suggested, some potential government consultants from
the private sector would be unwilling to provide advice unless their
identities are concealed, it would seem that these are precisely the
consultants we don't want.</LD>

<LD>Re "Paul's New Arrangement Is Flip Side of Lennon-McCartney," Dec.
15: I was amused by the comment that Paul McCartney "is too paranoid
that, in future centuries, they will read 'Lennon-McCartney' and
assume he was lesser," and that's why McCartney wants their music to
be rechristened "McCartney-Lennon." By trying to finagle top billing
on their collaborations 20-some years after John Lennon's death, he
has already shown which he is.</LD>

<HD>German Americans Interned During WWII</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Your Dec. 11 article on the Japanese American internment at Manzanar
was of great interest to me because I was interned, along with my
sister and parents, in a camp near Crystal City, Texas, during World
War II. The location was an outpost exactly like Manzanar, fenced in
with towers and armed guards. Both my sister and I were American
citizens, born in Chicago. My mom and dad, though from Germany, had
been in this country many years. Our situation was not unique. Many
others of German ancestry were rounded up at the beginning of the war
and interned.</LD>
<LD>   I was 9 and my sister was 3 when we were sent to camp. My family
and I were deported to Germany toward the end of the war, in time to
be bombed and invaded by victorious American troops. I couldn't speak
a word of German. When I was 15, my mother was able to get back to
the U.S. with my sister and me.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the concentration camp adults have died, but a large
number of us children are still around -- and held our first reunion
at Crystal City last month. As with Manzanar, there wasn't much left
of the camp, just some of the old foundations and the excavated
remnant of the old irrigation reservoir we had used as a swimming
pool. We were able to commiserate with many Japanese internees who
attended and with whom we'd lived those many years ago.</LD>
<TE>   This reunion, along with exchanging many oral histories and
testimonies, helped us to exorcise much of our past trauma. However,
only two of those who were adults during the internment were able to
attend, charming ladies now in their mid-90s. It would have been nice
if my mom and dad had lived to share this experience and, better
still, if there were public knowledge and government recognition of
this past injustice.</TE>

<LD>The most interesting thing about Peter King's Dec. 15 column, "The
Liberals on the March in Spokane," was the quote from a 43-year-old
consultant from Portland, Ore., who stated that "our U.S. foreign
policy has a lot to do with how much [terrorists] hate us in the
first place."</LD>
<LD>   There is some truth in this statement, but the speaker misses the
point. It is a generally reliable rule in life that if evil people
hate you, it is not because you have done something wrong but because
you have done something right.</LD>

<LD>I take great pride in my support for fully funding the U.S.-Russia
Cooperative Threat Reduction program throughout my tenure in
Congress. I was shocked by your accusation (editorial, Dec. 3) that I
have impeded this program's funding. Some of my colleagues want to
cancel this program, a position I have always opposed. They cite a
recent Pentagon report regarding expenditures for a facility in
Russia converting rocket fuel from nuclear missiles into consumer
products. According to the report, Russia used the fuel for its space
program, leaving the U.S. with a $100-million bill and an empty
conversion facility.</LD>
<LD>   You claim that I "foolishly crippled" a
chemical-weapon-destruction project in Russia. To the contrary, I
supported expansion of the CTR program to include chemical weapons
like those to be destroyed at the plant and fought for more than $250
million in funding. Apparently, because I supported conditions on
these funds, I must be an obstructionist intent on undermining the
program. In fact, I negotiated the conditions with opponents of the
project. Had I adhered to the all-or-nothing approach advocated in
your editorial, this program might have died. I did what I have
always done as the Russians' best friend and toughest critic and held
them accountable for their actions while providing the vital support
they desperately need.</LD>

<HD>Douglas D. Daigle, 49; Helicopter Charter Operator,
Philanthropist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Douglas David Daigle, an aviation visionary who turned a boyhood
fascination with helicopters into a career that produced a world
record and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for charity, died
Monday of pneumonia. He was 49.</LD>
<LD>   Daigle died at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, said longtime friend
and business partner Mike Irwin.</LD>
<LD>   Thirteen years ago, the Laguna Beach man set the record for the
world's longest helicopter hover when he and three other pilots kept
his restored Bell 47B aloft for 50 hours and 50 minutes over Anaheim
Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   The effort raised $250,000 for Lestonnac Free Clinic in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   As founder and president of charter operator Tridair Helicopters,
Daigle developed and licensed the TwinRanger, a twin-engine version
of a Bell helicopter, in an effort to make a safer aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   He was also the force behind construction of CenterPort, the
world's largest private heliport, which opened in 1989 at John Wayne
Airport in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "Doug did a tremendous amount to further the helicopter industry
from the time he was a flight instructor," said Rod Anderson,
president of HeliStream, a flight school and charter company based at
CenterPort. "He loved flying, and he loved people. And he never
spared any effort to support either one."</TE>
<TE>   Daigle, who was named for the Douglas aircraft manufacturing
company where his father worked, first became enthralled with
helicopters as a toddler after watching Santa Claus alight from a
chopper at an Azusa shopping center, said sister Jessie Bynder, 54,
of Corona del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   "After he saw that first one, helicopters became the center of his
life," she said. "Through his work for charity, he became a pilot and
a Santa Claus."</TE>
<TE>   Daigle fashioned his first toy helicopter out of potatoes and
Popsicle sticks. He refused to play army with friends unless he could
be the helicopter pilot.</TE>
<TE>   His family moved to Orange County while he was in high school, and
he began bartering his services washing helicopters and airplanes for
flight lessons. He became an instructor at 19.</TE>
<TE>   When he first started piloting helicopters, the baby-faced Daigle
looked so young he still could get into movie theaters at children's
prices.</TE>
<TE>   One of his first scheduled passengers refused to enter the
helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his life, he bore a resemblance to singer-actor Donny
Osmond so striking that bartenders often gave him free drinks, his
sister said.</TE>
<TE>   As a pilot, he ferried workers building the Alaskan oil pipeline,
aided in U.S. Navy weapons drills and helped filmmakers shoot Imax
films.</TE>
<TE>   More than a decade ago, Daigle restored a red-and-white Bell 47B,
the last flying model of the world's first commercial helicopter, to
use in fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   He often decorated the aircraft in the spirit of the event, such
as attaching oversized pig ears and a curly tail to make the
helicopter look like a giant piggybank.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives said he was gratified when the helicopter was accepted
for permanent display at the Smithsonian Institution's new branch of
the National Air and Space Museum, which will open at Dulles
International Airport in Virginia in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Daigle, who would have turned 50 next Monday, is survived by his
partner of nearly 13 years, Jeff Clark; his mother, Jill Hatfield of
Orange; sisters Bynder, and Joyce Meyer of Sparks, Nev.; and brothers
Joe Daigle of Lake Havasu City, Ariz., and Leroy Daigle of Portland,
Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be held at 4:30 p.m. Thursday at St. Mary's
Episcopal Church, 428 Park Ave., Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial contributions can be made to the St. Mary's Building
Fund.</TE>

<HD>Sidney Glazier, 86; Produced Cult Comedy That Became Hit
Musical</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sidney Glazier, who produced Mel Brooks' "The Producers," the 1968
cult comedy film that later gave birth to the hit Broadway musical,
has died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Glazier, who also was executive producer of Brooks' 1970 comedy,
"The Twelve Chairs," and Woody Allen's 1969 comedy, "Take the Money
and Run," died of natural causes Saturday at a nursing home in
Bennington, Vt.</LD>
<LD>   The former executive director of the Eleanor Roosevelt Cancer
Foundation in New York City, Glazier was an Academy Award winner as
the producer of the 1965 documentary feature "The Eleanor Roosevelt
Story" when Brooks met with him to pitch his "Producers" story.</LD>
<TE>   Brooks, who was best known at the time for his "2000-Year-Old Man"
comedy routines with Carl Reiner, had already approached numerous
movie producers.</TE>
<TE>   But no one was interested in his show business satire about a
manic, unscrupulous Broadway producer who, joined by his mousy
accountant, comes up with a scheme to defraud their wealthy investors
and make a fortune by over-financing a Broadway show that is
guaranteed to be a flop: a tasteless musical called "Springtime for
Hitler," complete with a chorus line of jackbooted SS girls and
lyrics such as "Don't be stupid, be a smarty! Come and join the Nazi
Party!"</TE>
<TE>   Glazier was eating lunch in his office when Brooks began acting
out the story. Just as Glazier took a bite of his tuna on rye and
washed it down with coffee, Brooks began singing "Springtime for
Hitler."</TE>
<TE>   "He spit out his coffee and tuna sandwich and couldn't stop
laughing," Brooks told The Times this week. "He said, 'I vow to get
this movie made. The world must see this picture.' " Glazier "was
responsible for the film seeing the light of day. It was his
stick-to-itiveness and perseverance. He took it to all the studios,
and he used to take me along to kind of explain it, even though the
script was finished."</TE>
<TE>   After a number of studio rejections -- "It was too bizarre for the
industry," Brooks said -- Glazier "finally got it to Joseph E. Levine
at Avco Embassy, and he browbeat Joe into letting me direct the
movie. He said I was a genius director. Nobody knew that, because I
hadn't directed anything."</TE>
<TE>   Levine put up $500,000, and Glazier raised the other half for the
film, which came in under budget at $941,000.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1997 interview with Billboard, Glazier said Brooks "had a
remarkable sense of how to create humor in the moment, which is why I
loved it when he acted out the script for me, improvising the
unfinished parts from a three-page synopsis, doing all the German
accents ....I never laughed so hard in my life."</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, "The Producers," which starred Zero Mostel and Gene
Wilder, was entered into the National Film Registry as a "culturally,
historically, and aesthetically" significant film.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Philadelphia on May 29, 1916, Glazier was the second of
three sons of a Russian-Polish couple from Minsk (in what is now
Belarus) who had immigrated about 1912.</TE>
<TE>   After Glazier's father died during the influenza epidemic of 1918,
his mother fell in love with a man who already had three children and
was not interested in raising three more. His mother put her sons --
ages 7, 5 and 4 -- in the Hebrew Orphan Home in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "Her reasoning and the pain it brought us remain incomprehensible,
unfathomable," Glazier told Billboard.</TE>
<TE>   Molested by a volunteer at the orphanage, he ran away once, but
returned because he had nowhere else to go. At 15, he left for good.</TE>
<TE>   Glazier joined the Army after the attack on Pearl Harbor and, as a
newly married second lieutenant, spent the war in Australia and New
Guinea.</TE>
<TE>   After his discharge in 1945, he moved to Manhattan, where he
managed a bar and later became an apprentice jeweler. He then found a
job selling bonds for the new state of Israel. His success at that
led to his being hired as executive director of the Eleanor Roosevelt
Cancer Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Glazier got to know the former first lady and was so impressed by
her that, after she died in 1962, he raised $90,000 to fund a
documentary on her.</TE>
<TE>   Encouraged to go into feature film production after winning the
Oscar for best documentary feature, Glazier formed Universal Marion
Corp. Pictures, a distribution company. He was executive producer for
a number of films, including "Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the
Bronx," a 1970 romantic comedy starring Gene Wilder and Margot
Kidder.</TE>
<TE>   Turning to television, he was executive producer of "Catholics," a
1973 drama that won a Peabody Award.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks remembers Glazier as "very bright, warm and a bit of a bon
vivant. Sidney was the first one to say, 'The dailies look good;
let's have a party.' He'd have a party about anything -- have a few
drinks, canapes and pretty girls. He really knew how to live. He was
right out of a black-and-white Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie.
He was that kind of guy -- a big, tall, good-looking man."</TE>
<TE>   The well-known addendum to "The Producers" is that it became a
Broadway phenomenon when it opened in April 2001, and earned an
unprecedented 12 Tony Awards, including for best musical.</TE>
<TE>   "Sidney never got to see the show," Brooks said. "He became ill
the year that show was born and couldn't leave his rest home."</TE>
<TE>   But at the Tony ceremony, Brooks said, "I made a speech thanking
Sidney Glazier for making it all happen. I knew he'd be listening to
the Tonys.</TE>
<TE>   "None of it -- all of this wonderful, magical stuff -- would be if
it wasn't for the faith and courage of this terrific guy."</TE>
<TE>   Glazier is survived by a daughter, Karen Shepard of Williamstown,
Mass.; and three grandchildren. Also surviving is a brother, Tom
Glazer of Philadelphia, who wrote the score for Elia Kazan's "A Face
in the Crowd" and is a children's folk singer who recorded the hit
"On Top of Spaghetti."</TE>

<HD>Maria Bjornson, 53; Designed Sets, Costumes for 'Phantom of
Opera'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maria Bjornson, 53, a set and costume designer who won the loudest
raves of her career for her work on the hit musical "The Phantom of
the Opera," has died.</LD>
<LD>   She was found dead at her London home Friday, London newspapers
reported. No cause of death was given.</LD>
<LD>   Bjornson won two Tonys -- for set and costume design -- for
"Phantom," the dazzling Andrew Lloyd Webber musical about a
disfigured man who haunts the Paris Opera House. Bjornson, who was
known for her work with the Royal Shakespeare Company, had never
worked on a musical before collaborating with director Hal Prince on
the Webber production.</LD>
<TE>   Her designs were widely regarded as being central to the success
of "Phantom," which debuted in London in 1986 and went on to a long
run in New York, Los Angeles and other U.S. cities. She created 57
effects, including a candlelit lake, an elevating lair and a "magic"
see-through mirror through which heroine Christine first glimpses her
hypnotic masked suitor.</TE>
<TE>   Before designing the sets, she spent hours exploring and
photographing from top to bottom the Paris Opera House, where Gaston
Leroux's novel (and basis of the Webber musical) was set.</TE>
<TE>   Her voluminous research combined with an exhaustive imagination to
produce costumes such as that worn by the Phantom, which was her
favorite. The half-mask that was his trademark was suggested to
Bjornson by the visors worn by some blinded, disfigured soldiers
after World War I.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Paris to parents of Norwegian and Romanian heritage, she
moved with her family to England as a baby. A painter who saw her
drawings when she was 12 suggested that she study theatrical design.
She was barely 16 when she took her first courses in the field at the
Glen Byam Shaw School in London. She later studied at the Central
School of Art and Design.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Eli Ginzberg, 91, a longtime Columbia University economist who wrote
extensively about labor and health care and advised eight U.S.
presidents, died Thursday at his home in New York City. The cause of
death was not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Ginzberg grew up a few blocks from Columbia, where he taught for
more than 60 years.</LD>
<LD>   The son of an eminent Talmudic scholar, he earned his bachelor's
degree in 1931 and his doctorate in economics in 1934, both from
Columbia. He joined the Columbia faculty in 1935.</LD>
<TE>   In 1939, after spending a year touring 40 states, he published
"The Illusion of Economic Stability," a series of recommendations on
reforming the regulatory and monetary systems.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, he co-wrote a major study for the Conservation of Human
Resources Project at Columbia's Graduate School of Business that
called for an expansion of the federal role in education.</TE>
<TE>   With his Columbia colleagues, he later wrote a three-volume study
on the problems of the segregated Army called "The Ineffective
Soldier: Lessons for Management and the Nation."</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, he helped launch the Manpower Demonstration Research
Corp., a nonprofit that assesses social programs. In later years,
Ginzberg focused on health-care issues such as the possible
oversupply of doctors and the causes of runaway medical costs.</TE>

<HD>Don Vesco, 63; Held Speed Records for Cars, Motorcycles</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Don Vesco, a land-speed record-holder for motorcycles and cars, died
Monday in Scripps Mercy Hospital in San Diego of prostate cancer. He
was 63.</LD>
<LD>   Long associated with the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, Vesco set
18 motorcycle and six automotive records during a career that began
when he was 16. Among his achievements is the current wheel-driven
land-speed record of 458.44 mph. The world land-speed record for all
cars is 763.085 mph, set in 1997 by Englishman Andy Green in a car
powered by two jet engines.</LD>
<LD>   Vesco was 62 when he drove his jet-powered Team Vesco Turbinator
to the record Oct. 17, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Until the time of his death, he was planning to become the first
driver to go 500 mph in a wheel-driven vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the proper salt texture, it could average 500," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Vesco and his brother, Rick, who designed the Turbinator, were
instrumental in the "Save the Salt" effort at Bonneville, the longest
and straightest such stretch in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Vesco's record has an asterisk, however. His car was powered by a
turbine driven by propellers. Fellow Californian Al Teague holds the
piston-driven record of 409.986 mph, set in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   In 1970, Vesco was the first person to ride a motorcycle at more
than 250 mph, and five years later he broke the 300-mph barrier on
his Silver Bird Yamaha, powered by twin Yamaha TZ750 engines. In
1978, he increased the record to 318 mph on a Kawasaki turbo, a
standard that stood for 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   Born April 8, 1939, in Loma Linda, Vesco had a passion for speed
while growing up in San Diego, watching his father, John, race Model
A and Model T Fords on weekends. He was a crewman for his father when
John set a class record at Bonneville in 1951.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything we did was a race," Vesco once said. "The first thing
I remember is racing tricycles and scooters around the block. You
name it, we raced it. From our toys as little kids, racing was always
a part of my life."</TE>
<TE>   He was also fascinated by what makes vehicles go faster.</TE>
<TE>   As a third-grader, he was tearing apart model airplane engines and
making them faster.</TE>
<TE>   In his first major racing accomplishment, he won the 1963
Motorcycle Grand Prix of the United States, forerunner of the Daytona
200, at Daytona International Speedway. Riding a Yamaha, he averaged
89.405 mph for 124 miles around the 3.1-mile course combining two
banks and an infield road.</TE>
<TE>   After breaking all the two-wheel land-speed records, Vesco and his
brother decided in the 1980s to tackle four-wheel records in their
own custom vehicle. The result was the Turbinator, a car 31 feet
long, 3 feet wide and only 2.5 feet tall. It was powered by a turbine
engine from a Chinook helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   Vesco said he and his brother once worked for three days without
sleep to be ready for Bonneville when the salt was right.</TE>
<TE>   "When you see the sun set and rise and haven't gone anywhere but
the shop, and then you see the sun rise again, you know you're in
trouble," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Racing against time is also dangerous. Vesco had his share of
high-speed spills, but none as bad as one in 1986, when a rear tire
blew out while he was traveling about 350 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the car went 30 feet in the air before crashing and
rolling over three times. Vesco suffered a broken neck but never lost
consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   He made some of his fastest runs after losing an eye when he was
hit by a rock while watching a sprint car race in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Vesco was inducted into the Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1999, and
in April he and his brother were named "Car Guy of the Year" by the
automotive industry at its eAuto World Conference.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1975 interview, Vesco said he chased speed because
"basically, it's my hobby. Some people play golf, some go fishing and
some ride bikes in the desert. I get my enjoyment from the challenge
on the salt."</TE>
<TE>   Information on survivors was not immediately available.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services are scheduled for 11 a.m. Saturday at El Cajon
Mortuary in El Cajon.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia to Resume Selling Sex Channels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After two years of abstinence, Southern California's largest cable
provider, Adelphia Communications Corp., will again air such sexual
fare as Playboy TV and the Spice networks.</LD>
<LD>   The company confirmed Tuesday that it will launch so-called adult
programming on its systems nationwide starting next year. Although
sex channels are among the most lucrative in cable, Adelphia's fallen
founder, John Rigas, refused to carry them because he said he
considered their contents immoral and detrimental to family values.</LD>
<LD>   One year after it purchased Century Communications in 1999,
Adelphia began dropping the popular Spice channel from its newly
acquired systems, which serves 1.2 million customers in Southern
California.</LD>
<TE>   Rigas has since relinquished control of Adelphia amid an
accounting scandal that forced the Coudersport, Pa.-based company to
file for bankruptcy protection. Rigas and several other Adelphia top
executives were indicted this summer on charges of bank and mail
fraud.</TE>
<TE>   In an internal memo to Adelphia employees and managers last week,
obtained by The Times, Adelphia Chairman Erland Kailbourne said the
policy reversal was motivated by consumer demand and the financial
benefits of adult programming.</TE>
<TE>   Some cable industry executives estimate that Adelphia, the
nation's fifth-largest cable company, has given up more than $25
million a year in revenues by refusing to carry the channels.
Revenues from adult programming have exploded in recent years,
approaching $1 billion last year, up fourfold since 1998, according
to industry estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Kailbourne said only digital set-top boxes will be needed to order
Adelphia's adult programming. In this way, parents can block
adult-themed stations from the view of their children.</TE>
<TE>   Pastor John Lindberg of the Eagle Rock Covenant Church said the
change of heart means "money talks, and that's sad."</TE>
<TE>   "I do a good deal of counseling," he said, "and I see the havoc
that pornography on television and the Internet wreaks in some
households."</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia will begin notifying customers of the programming changes
before year's end. Company officials say the local systems will
decide when they roll out the new channels, which will include
Playboy, Spice 1 and 2 and the Hot Network. All are owned by Playboy
Enterprises Inc., the dominant provider of adult programming.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia was the lone holdout among pay television companies in
rejecting soft-core programming such as Playboy and Spice. Several
cable operators continue to balk at carrying harder-core channels
such as Spice 2 and the Hot Network.</TE>
<TE>   Playboy estimates that up to 10% of the nation's 80 million cable
and satellite households order some form of adult programming every
month.</TE>

<HD>Arco, O.C. Set Gas Station Cleanup Terms</HD>
<DH>The company will spend millions to remove MTBE, which
threatens drinking water. The deal is seen as a road map for other
counties.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oil giant Arco on Tuesday agreed to spend millions of dollars
cleaning up contamination beneath 143 gas stations that threatens
Orange County's drinking water supply, ending a lengthy legal battle
closely watched around the state.</LD>
<LD>   Atlantic Richfield Co. was one of several that the Orange County
district attorney's office sued for allowing leaking gasoline storage
tanks to taint the soil and ground water with MTBE, a gasoline
additive that may cause cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys said Orange County's settlement provides a roadmap for
other counties trying to hold oil companies accountable for
pollution. Unlike previous legal settlements involving MTBE
pollution, Orange County was able to win cleanup commitments from the
corporation even though the pollution has yet to seriously harm the
water supply.</LD>
<TE>   "It sets a standard for all the other oil companies," said Arco
spokesman Paul Langland.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a lot of work to do. But I think we are on our way to
making sure all of our sites are cleaned up."</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas said the deal protects Orange County
residents and ensures that the water supply will remain safe "for the
present and future generations.... You simply cannot put a price on
the value of having a fresh, clean supply of drinking water that is
free of dangerous contamination."</TE>
<TE>   Arco, owned by British Petroleum, agreed to spend $3 million to
study each gas station, allowing an independent environmental
consultant to determine the extent of contamination and required
cleanup.</TE>
<TE>   Arco has already spent $16 million cleaning up gas stations in
Orange County, and under the settlement, it is required to pay for
any additional cleanup that the study finds necessary. Under state
and federal law, oil companies are already responsible for cleaning
up their contamination, but mandating it in a legally binding
agreement carries more weight.</TE>
<TE>   Officials could not estimate the total cleanup cost, but the
company is likely to spend millions of dollars more.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Arco will reimburse the county for $5 million in
legal costs.</TE>
<TE>   MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, is added to gasoline to make
it burn cleaner, reducing air pollution. States across the nation
realized in recent years that the chemical also spreads rapidly
through water and soil, and can, even in small amounts, make drinking
water smell like turpentine. It causes cancer in animals and is a
likely carcinogen for humans.</TE>
<TE>   These factors led Gov. Gray Davis to phase the chemical out of
California gasoline by the end of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Some communities have lost much of their local drinking water
supply because it was tainted by MTBE. Santa Monica won $30 million
in a settlement from two oil companies, which also agreed to build a
treatment plant to sanitize the city's ground water.</TE>
<TE>   The vast aquifer beneath northern and central Orange County has
remained largely protected from the contamination. So the Arco
settlement could open the door for other communities that have leaks
but so far no water contamination to seek similar commitments from
oil companies.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' point man on MTBE, California Environmental Protection
Agency Assistant Secretary William Rukeyser, praised the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "We of course are very glad to see local action pay off," he said.
"They have taken the investigation in a considerably different
direction than [other counties and the state]. They connected a
variety of dots in terms of lack of compliance in upgrades, the
leaks, the contamination, and based their case on that."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Robinson, a consumer attorney whose firm assisted Orange
County, said he has already received calls from officials in San
Diego, Contra Costa and Alameda counties about following Rackauckas'
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's suits against three other companies, including
Shell Oil and the Thrifty gas station chain, are pending.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists and others expressed mixed feelings about the
deal.</TE>
<TE>   The former lead prosecutor on the case, who resigned after what
she described as repeated clashes with Rackauckas, said she was
disappointed with the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Former Deputy Dist. Atty. Michelle Lyman said the office should
have taken the case to trial and asked for tens of millions of
dollars in civil penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "All they're being required to do by this judgment is what they
were already legally required to do," Lyman said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not one red cent of civil penalties to punish them for
the hundreds of violations that were committed and for grossly
contaminating the county's drinking water aquifer."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas, however, said it is important that all proceeds from
the settlement go to cleaning up the environmental mess.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the money that Arco spends to go to cleaning up the
environment, to making sure the ground water is protected," he said.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday affirmed a $1.7-
million verdict against the city of Long Beach and two detectives for
violating the rights of a man wrongly arrested in 1998 as a serial
rape suspect.</LD>
<LD>   A federal jury in 2000 awarded damages to Jeffrey Grant, finding
that Dets. Katherine Watson and Joe Bahash lacked probable cause for
his arrest and three-month detainment before DNA evidence cleared
him.</LD>
<LD>   A three-judge panel of the court agreed. The city prosecutor's
office said it will seek a rehearing by the full court.</LD>

<HD>Judge Delays Accord on Dental Mercury Warning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge has briefly delayed implementation of an agreement to post
warnings about the potential dangers of mercury fillings in dentists'
offices.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco Superior Court Judge James A. Robertson II earlier
this week asked both sides in a legal dispute to come up with warning
language that helps patients better gauge the health risks of such
fillings.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for the environmental group As You Sow and the
California Dental Assn. must submit proposed changes to the state
attorney general's office. Robertson is expected Thursday to order
the revised warnings to be posted within 90 days.</LD>
<TE>   As You Sow sued the state dental association two years ago under
Proposition 65, a statewide initiative that requires businesses to
post warning signs if they use hazardous chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   As You Sow says mercury amalgam can cause reproductive and
neurological damage. The American Dental Assn. says not enough is
absorbed into the body through the fillings to affect health.</TE>

<HD>Anger Over INS Arrests</HD>
<DH>Dozens are held when they obey order for residents of
Mideast nations and Sudan to register. Many say they love the U.S.,
feel hurt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In peaceful Irvine, where Iranians who fled the Ayatollah Khomeini
established a tight-knit community of professionals and young
families, the last thing anyone expected was to be tossed in jail.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday -- the day after dozens of immigrants from Middle
Eastern countries and Sudan were taken into custody during a
government registration process -- residents like Ahmad Mesbah were
filled with sadness and anger.</LD>
<LD>   "We suffered a lot, and that is why we are here. We love the
United States, so this has been frustrating," said Mesbah, who helps
lead monthly networking meetings for Iranian professionals. "There's
also something ironic about it. This affects the cream of the crop
who came here. We are scientists, doctors, engineers."</LD>
<TE>   The registration, mandated for people from Iran, Iraq, Libya,
Sudan and Syria who are in the United States on temporary visas, led
to the detention on immigration violation charges of as many as
several hundred, some who had nearly completed the process for legal
residency, friends and relatives said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Department of Justice and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service refused to say how many people had been
apprehended in California or around the country in connection with
the registration process. Santa Ana police said as many as 40 people
detained at the INS center there were booked into the city jail
Monday. Police in Los Angeles could not provide an arrest figure.</TE>
<TE>   But in Westwood, Irvine and other communities with large numbers
of Iranian immigrants, and on Persian-language local media, accounts
of detentions were widespread. Local attorneys and callers to radio
stations offered accounts of relatives', some of whom had not been to
their native countries since childhood, being jailed and placed at
risk of being deported.</TE>
<TE>   As some scrambled to bail out jailed relatives, others sought ways
to pressure the government to change course. A lawsuit seeking an
injunction to halt the registration was filed in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Persian-language radio stations buzzed with commentary. And an
Iranian attorney conducted a vigil outside the INS office in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I have seen with my own eyes at least 450 people being detained
just yesterday [at the INS office in Los Angeles]. They handcuffed
them and walked them away," said attorney Soheila Jonoubi.</TE>
<TE>   "These people came in voluntarily. They wanted to comply with the
law. This is the worst violation of human rights."</TE>
<TE>   Most of those detained posted bail, but now face deportation
hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Under the registration program, men who are required to register
are photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed. Citizens of 13 other
countries -- North Korea and 12 Middle Eastern and North African
nations -- will be required to register by Jan. 10. Men from Saudi
Arabia and Pakistan who are in the United States on temporary visas
are required to register in February.</TE>
<TE>   The INS said about 7,500 immigrants nationwide would be affected,
but Islamic groups said the number could be far higher.</TE>
<TE>   The post-Sept. 11 procedure is designed to help the INS improve
its accountability of immigrants who lack green cards.</TE>
<TE>   Some immigrants, however, said the registration will not lead to
catching terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were terrorists, they would not show up to the INS for
the registration," said Babak Sotoodeh, a Santa Ana attorney who
emigrated from Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "We ran away from the Ayatollah and the [radical] Islam. We are
very patriotic in the United States," Sotoodeh said. "Why are we
being targeted? It's a total irony."</TE>
<TE>   Hossein Hedjazi, program manager at Persian-language radio station
KIRN-AM (670), said Irvine, Westwood and several other Southern
California communities draw Iranian professionals looking for good
schools and quiet suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine is home to an annual Persian festival and a Persian New
Year's party in April, both of which draw 20,000 to 30,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   More than 350 Iranians in Irvine participated in an event last
year that raised $75,000 for Sept. 11 victims. A radio-thon on KIRN
raised an additional $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We see ourselves as Americans. When something happens to America,
it happens to us," said Mariam Khosravai, an organizer of the
fund-raiser who came to Irvine from Iran in 1985. "We will do
anything to cooperate with the American government. That is why this
hurts so much."</TE>
<TE>   Reza Tabib was indignant that his friend Efran Haj Rasoli -- a
19-year-old Irvine Valley College student -- was taken into custody

Rasoli a letter indicating it had been approved in 2000 but that
because of INS backlogs, it had not arrived.</TE>

themselves in are not terrorists," Tabib said. "This boy is going to

<HD>Termed-Out Eastin to Run Principal-Training Program</HD>

<LD>Supt. of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin, termed out after eight
years as the chief of California's public schools, said she will head
a new Washington, D.C.-based organization that trains principals.</LD>
<LD>   After leaving the state office next month, Eastin will become
executive director of the National Institute for School Leadership,
which is to help school districts train principals with an on-the-job
curriculum based on models from business, the military and higher
education.</LD>
<LD>   Eastin said she turned down several private-sector offers to take
the institute job. She said she will use the post to encourage
education schools to put more emphasis on preparing school leaders
rather than researchers.</LD>
<TE>   "I believe we could do with this model some of what we did in the
late '70s and '80s with business when it helped change what was
taught in the schools of business in this country," Eastin said.</TE>
<TE>   The two-year program prepares administrators within school
districts to train working principals in high-level executive skills,
said acting Director Robert Hughes, former dean of the National War
College. The first to receive the training, Hughes said, will be the
Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District and a large urban
district in Florida, which he said he could not identify because the
contract has not been finalized.</TE>
<TE>   Eastin served four terms in the California Legislature before
winning statewide office as superintendent in 1994. Term limits
precluded her seeking a third term. She will leave office Jan. 5, and
begin the new job Feb. 1.</TE>
<TE>   During Eastin's time as the state's top educator, the public
schools underwent almost constant reform, including class-size
reduction in kindergarten through third grade and the adoption of new
academic standards.</TE>

<HD>Jones Decries Turnout While Certifying Election</HD>
<DH>Only 50.6% of registered voters cast ballots last month, a
record low. Secretary of state blames negative campaigns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Outgoing Secretary of State Bill Jones, the last Republican elected
statewide, finalized last month's election results Monday and
lamented the failure of millions of Californians to vote.</LD>
<LD>   Barely more than half the people registered to vote did so in the
November general election, a record low.</LD>
<LD>   As the overseer of California's elections for the last eight
years, Jones said he fears that the state's eligible voters are
shunning the polling booth because they think they will only
encourage nasty, negative campaigns by casting votes.</LD>
<TE>   "The vote becomes kind of a hostage of the politics," Jones said,
"and people on both sides get upset with the politics."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, a San Joaquin Valley farmer, lost a bid to become governor
in the March primary election. When he leaves office Jan. 6, all
statewide elected offices will be held by Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Before certifying the election results, Jones noted that the
fastest-growing category of voters is "decline to state," meaning not
affiliated with any political party. Forty-five percent of
California's registered voters are Democrats, 35% are Republicans, 2%
are American Independents and 15% are "decline to state," according
to the secretary of state's office.</TE>
<TE>   "The number of decline-to-states, independents, people who are
sitting the election out completely is growing by huge numbers,"
Jones said, "and that is where the opportunity is, to re-enfranchise
those people. The party that reaches out to those individuals and
brings them to their banner is the party that will be the majority,
if not in registration, at least in terms of election successes in
the next generation."</TE>
<TE>   Jones encouraged his successor, former San Francisco Assemblyman
Kevin Shelley, to step between mud-slinging candidates and use
television and radio ads to remind Californians that voting is an
obligation critical to a democratic society.</TE>
<TE>   With candidates collectively spending tens of millions of dollars
on attack ads, Jones said, "what happens is, there's no money being
spent by the secretary of state to try and separate the vote itself
from that negative environment."</TE>
<TE>   Roger Salazar, a former campaign spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis,
called Jones' complaint hypocritical. As a candidate for governor,
Jones repeatedly criticized Davis' fund-raising and handling of the
electricity crisis, Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe if he hadn't spent so much time throwing reckless
accusations against the governor and more time doing his job as
secretary of state," Salazar said, "we would have had a better
showing at the polls."</TE>
<TE>   Of California's 15.3 million registered voters, 7.7 million cast
votes in the November election, for a turnout of 50.6%. In
comparison, 71% of those registered to vote did so in November 2000,
a presidential election, and 58% turned out in November 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The decline in votes cast last month will make it easier and
cheaper for people to put new laws directly before voters in future
elections. That's because California's signature-gathering
requirements for initiatives are tied to the number of votes cast for
governor.</TE>
<TE>   The number of signatures that must be gathered to make an
initiative statute qualify has fallen 11%, from 419,260 to 373,816,
while the number for a constitutional amendment dropped from 670,816
to 598,105.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of gathering signatures typically runs between $1.25 and
$2 per signature, depending on the issue and time pressure, said
Michael Arno, president of Arno Political Consultants in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The lower threshold could encourage less well-heeled campaigns to
launch ballot measures, he said, and California's huge budget
shortfall could trigger a special election in 2003 to ask voters to
raise taxes through the initiative process.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to be really heavily used in the next two
years," Arno said.</TE>

<HD>Inmate Whose Transplant Caused Furor Dies</HD>
<DH>His body apparently rejected new heart, officials say.
Operation was publicly funded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Warren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A California prisoner whose heart transplant a year ago caused a wave
of outrage over state-funded inmate health care has died, apparently
because his body rejected the organ, corrections officials said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The 32-year-old inmate, whose name was not released, died Monday
night at Stanford University Medical Center, where he had been listed
in critical condition for about two weeks and on life support more
recently, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   A hospital spokeswoman said the cause of death was heart failure
but would not provide details, citing patient confidentiality.
Corrections officials said an autopsy would be performed, probably
this week.</LD>
<TE>   "It appears that the inmate's body had been rejecting the heart,"
said Stephen Green, assistant secretary of the state Youth and Adult
Correctional Agency. "He began having problems earlier in the fall,
and they became progressively more serious."</TE>
<TE>   The inmate -- the first California convict to receive a heart
transplant -- was serving a 14-year sentence for a 1996 robbery in
Los Angeles. At the time of his sentencing, he was suffering from a
viral heart infection, which led to a gradual degeneration of his
heart muscle.</TE>
<TE>   About a year ago, he suffered congestive heart failure and was
taken to Stanford, where he was kept alive by a machine that makes
the heart beat mechanically. Hospital officials determined that a
transplant was medically necessary, and the surgery was performed
Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   The operation and subsequent care cost the state $913,000 through
the end of October, a sum that excludes the inmate's most recent
treatment at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   After news of the transplant surfaced, critics questioned why
taxpayers should foot the bill for such an elaborate procedure -- and
why a convict should receive a new heart when other, law-abiding
patients were in line for an organ.</TE>
<TE>   Though heart transplants have become a routine procedure because
of the introduction of drugs that block the body's effort to reject
transplanted tissues, a shortage of available organs remains a
barrier. At the time of the inmate's surgery, there were 4,119
patients on the waiting list for a donor heart, according to the
United Network for Organ Sharing.</TE>
<TE>   Green said the inmate was placed on the network's list of patients
needing transplants, and was selected according to criteria that
include whether a patient will die without a transplant and the
proximity of a donor to a recipient. The criteria do not include
whether a person is in prison, and bioethicists argued that barring
someone on such grounds would amount to playing God.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Green said, the state was compelled to provide the
transplant by a 1976 U.S. Supreme Court decision that found that
denial of decent medical care to prisoners violates the
Constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. That
decision laid the foundation for another court ruling, in 1995,
ordering California to give an inmate a kidney transplant.</TE>
<TE>   "The courts have set medical policy for us and have said that we
must meet the needs of our inmates," Green said, "and so we will."</TE>
<TE>   He said he knows of only one prisoner now in the system who may
become a candidate for a transplant in the near future. But many
inmates suffering from hepatitis C could at some point need kidney
transplants. "I'm sure that's coming," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The heart transplant patient had done fairly well after the
surgery and was taking anti-rejection drugs, officials said. He had
been in the hospital unit at the California Medical Facility in
Vacaville since the transplant.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics show that about 86% of patients survive the first year
after a heart transplant, with survival declining to about 70% after
five years.</TE>

<HD>Low-Cost Housing Opens, but Far More Is Needed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Overend</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>This is a city where even a small two-bedroom home can sell for $1
million or more. It's a city not only worried about losing low-income
service workers, but even its middle class. Already there are 30,000
cars a day bringing in a commuting workforce that can't afford to
actually live here.</LD>
<LD>   And that's why much was made Tuesday about the city's latest
affordable housing project. More than 100 people turned out for the
official unveiling of a 42-unit, Spanish-style apartment complex at
Carrillo and Castillo streets, within walking distance of downtown
stores and restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   In a month or so, the new residents will move into studio
apartments that rent for as low as $481 a month and one-bedroom
apartments that go for $815. That's between a third or a half of what
other people pay in this particular neighborhood, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   There already is a list of 200 or so applicants. The units come
with a few strings: Tenants will have to have jobs in downtown Santa
Barbara. There can be only two people to an apartment. Single tenants
can't earn more than $31,000 a year. A working couple could earn up
to $54,500 and still qualify.</TE>
<TE>   And, with an eye on growing traffic congestion as well as the
housing crisis, preference will be given to applicants who don't own
cars. One car is allowed. But that's the limit.</TE>
<TE>   Robert G. Pearson, executive director of the city's housing
authority, presided over Tuesday's ceremony. There are already about
4,500 houses and apartments in Santa Barbara under some kind of
affordable housing restriction, he said. That is 12% of the city's
housing stock, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara could use 5,000 to 10,000 more units, Pearson said.
There are other projects in the works, but nowhere near the number
actually needed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a start," he said. "We are trying to cobble together what
it takes in probably one of the toughest housing markets in the
nation. We should be proud of what we are doing here. But it's going
to take a continuing effort."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Rep. Lois Capps and Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson, both
Santa Barbara Democrats, spoke during the ceremony. Both promised
support for more affordable housing, calling the Spanish-tiled Casa
de Las Fuentes complex a model for affordable housing projects.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara Mayor Marty Blum said the city is having better luck
holding on to lower-income workers than the middle-class. With the
median price of houses approaching $700,000, she said, much of the
middle-class is being priced out of the city.</TE>

<HD>Women Appear to Be on GHB, Drug Expert Testifies</HD>
<DH>The alleged victims in the date-rape trial of cosmetics
heir seem to be in comas, she says. Defense says the women lied about
encounter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two young women whose sexual encounters with date-rape suspect Andrew
Luster were captured on videotape appear to be in drug-induced comas
during the alleged assaults, a toxicologist testified Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   UC San Francisco associate professor Jo Dyer told jurors that
based on her review of the tapes, the snoring, groggy women appear to
be under the influence of gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB.</LD>
<LD>   Dyer described the substance as a potent, slightly salty-tasting,
clear and odorless liquid that can easily be slipped into a woman's
drink to render her unconscious within minutes.</LD>
<TE>   "It will knock you out reliably at a certain dose," Dyer
testified. "GHB is very dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County prosecutors charge that Luster, 39, a surfer and
the great-grandson of cosmetics mogul Max Factor, used GHB to
incapacitate at least three women before raping them at his Mussel
Shoals beach house. He is charged with multiple counts of rape of
intoxicated and unconscious women, as well as sexual battery,
poisoning, sodomy and drug possession.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys, who delayed giving an opening statement, have
argued that Luster engaged in consensual sex with the women.</TE>
<TE>   Luster's lawyers have portrayed the women as embarrassed college
coeds who lied about the sexual encounters. The defense has suggested
that corrupt law enforcement officers manipulated the evidence
against their client.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors launched their case Tuesday in Ventura County Superior
Court by calling Dyer, a drug and poison specialist, as their first
witness. She said she began chronicling GHB abuse after first
encountering the drug 12 years ago when called by doctors treating a
severe coma patient at a Bay Area hospital. Since then, she has
documented 88 cases involving GHB abuse and researched 20 deaths
linked to the drug, which was developed in France during the 1960s as
an anesthetic.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors hired Dyer, at a cost of $300 an hour, to offer an
opinion about whether the three women in Luster's case were drugged
and unconscious at the time of the alleged rapes.</TE>
<TE>   Based on her review of two roughly 30-minute videotapes and
statements by the alleged victims, Dyer concluded that the women were
poisoned by GHB.</TE>
<TE>   But defense attorney Roger Jon Diamond challenged Dyer and
questioned whether prosecutors had provided her enough information.</TE>
<TE>   He displayed a large photograph of one of the women, a 21-year-old
UC Santa Barbara student, smiling as she sat between two men, one of
whom was shirtless. The photo was taken at Luster's home after she
and her friend David met Luster and his friend at a Santa Barbara
bar.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors concede that the evidence will show that she and David
had sex in the back of Luster's car on the way to the defendant's
house, but say the pair were under the influence of GHB after being
drugged by Luster.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys question the rape allegations in light of the
earlier sexual encounter in the car, and point to the photograph as
strong evidence to back up their theory.</TE>
<TE>   Under Diamond's questioning, Dyer admitted that she was not shown
the photo before reaching her conclusions. But she testified that it
wouldn't have made a difference in her overall opinion.</TE>

<HD>Planning Review Is Ordered</HD>
<DH>Supervisors seek more information on Newhall developer's
report on endangered plants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicholas Riccardi and Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County supervisors on Tuesday called for a review of
their planning policy in light of criticism that it enabled the
developer of the 22,000-home Newhall Ranch project to quietly destroy
endangered plants on its property.</LD>
<LD>   On a motion by Supervisor Mike Antonovich, whose district includes
Newhall's land, the board directed its staff to survey other
government agencies to see how they ensure full disclosure in their
environmental documents. The supervisors also requested a timetable
of Newhall's report on the endangered plants. The motion passed
unanimously.</LD>
<LD>   "We're asking for this information to ensure the process is fair,"
Antonovich said. "Before we take action, we have to have all the
facts."</LD>
<TE>   A report is due back to the board Jan. 14, two weeks before
Newhall Land &amp; Farming is scheduled to submit a supplemental
environmental study for approval. Supervisors approved the initial
environmental review in 1999, but the development was stalled after
neighboring Ventura County and a group of environmentalists filed a
lawsuit challenging the adequacy of the report.</TE>
<TE>   A Kern County judge threw out the original environmental document
and directed Newhall to provide additional information before it
could move forward. The developer said it has met the requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Newhall hired environmental consultants in 2000 to look for the
San Fernando Valley spineflower on its property but bound them with a
confidentiality agreement. Critics say that the county receives
misleading reports because it allows companies to select their own
consultants to review the environmental impact of development.</TE>
<TE>   The county said directly managing consultants for all developments
would be unwieldy.</TE>

<LD>"Has anyone seen her wasband?" said the headline in the Irvine World
News. It wasn't a typo. The story referred to librarian Cindy
Mirallegro's campaign to win acceptance for "wasband" as a word
meaning ex-husband. " 'Ex' just sounds so harsh," said Mirallegro,
who has a wasband herself.</LD>
<LD>   She sent the Irvine article to Merriam-Webster, which said the
word could find "its way into our dictionaries" if "you and other
proponents of the word continue to use it in speech and
correspondence." Mirallegro said she and her friends are keeping an
eye out for "wasband" mentions -- it dates back at least as far as a
1990 Herb Caen column.</LD>
<LD>   Mirallegro's is a noble cause, but what about a term for ex-wife?
"Waswife" doesn't do it, I think we can all agree. I say dump wasband
and use a term that would be suitable to describe both sexes:
"waspouse." Anyone else have suggestions?</LD>
<TE>   Instant carpool: Erv Nichols and Robert Hollis spotted an ad in a
Big Bear newspaper for a vehicle whose extras include a female
passenger (see accompanying). Hollis said he didn't realize "those
older jeeps were so well equipped for serious off-road activities."</TE>
<TE>   This feature, I think, would be of interest to many wasbands.</TE>
<TE>   From sex to drugs: Gina Franco of Santa Monica snapped a shot of a
malfunctioning sign that seemed to deliver a provocative message (see
photo).</TE>
<TE>   Such a deal: Gary Fisher of Lake Forest zoomed in on a camera
rebate offer that really wasn't very tempting (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Weird Christmas decoration? The Dana Point News' police log
contained a complaint from a man who said "his neighbor had a tripod
in his frontyard with an alien mask over the top of it. The informant
thought that the mask was possibly hiding a camera."</TE>
<TE>   Back in the principal's office: "You referred to some school
spankings you received during your mischievous youth," writes William
Hullinger Jr. "Also, you mentioned that you attended Palms Junior
High School. I was vice principal there from 1965-1979 and had the
'honor' of being the sole administering person of corporal
punishment. Was it possible your education was enhanced by a visit to
my office?"</TE>
<TE>   No, Mr. Hullinger, I never had any, uh, contact with you, because
I graduated from Palms in 1960. During your tenure, I came to work at
The Times. I want you to know I've been fairly well behaved at the
newspaper -- no running in the halls (except during extreme deadline
situations), no throwing food in the cafeteria, a minimum of tardies,
no sleeping at my desk (except a couple of times on the night shift)
and not a shot of booze since the Christmas parties went nonalcoholic
several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The police log of the Canyon Life newspaper reported
that a resident in Rancho Santa Margarita "complained that his
neighbor was singing karaoke loudly for three hours." I hope, for the
victim's sanity, that there weren't too many Christmas songs.</TE>

<HD>PUC to Hand Utility Customers $4.65-Billion Tab</HD>
<DH>State regulators obligate ratepayers to cover energy
contracts made during the power crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Reiterman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- State regulators on Tuesday obligated California
utility customers to pay a $4.65-billion tab next year for
electricity contracts purchased by the Department of Water Resources,
but they urged DWR to reduce the cost by nearly $1 billion.</LD>
<LD>   In virtually rubber-stamping DWR's revenue request, the Public
Utilities Commission abided by an agreement to help guarantee that
the state's $36 billion in long-term power contracts and $11.2
billion in energy bond obligations are paid.</LD>
<LD>   But the panel voted 3-2 to remove $29 million that DWR requested
for programs to reduce energy demand, on grounds that these are
outside the purview of the water agency.</LD>
<TE>   And PUC President Loretta Lynch said the department's request
should be reduced even more because it contains almost $800 million
in financial reserves and $170 million for electricity reserves. The
commission says the state's three investor-owned electric utilities
will be responsible for those reserves next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Without an immediate update [on the revenue requirement],
ratepayers may be charged over $1 billion more than necessary in 2003
and [that] could have a detrimental effect on the economy," Lynch
said.</TE>
<TE>   The action set up yet another clash between two state agencies
over the incremental steps designed to remove the state from the
power-buying business and to pay for pacts signed during the energy
crisis of 2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no problem re-looking at the revenue requirement," said
DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo. "It is a moving target."</TE>
<TE>   However, he said the department disagrees with the PUC's decision
to cut $29 million for a program that is geared to reduce demand by
big utility customers when power is in short supply.</TE>
<TE>   Hidalgo said it is "premature" to cut money for maintaining
electrical reserves because the PUC has not yet finalized the
transfer of those activities back to utilities -- and the utilities
have not resumed those duties.</TE>
<TE>   And he said the large financial reserves were partly necessary to
help secure a good rate for the state's recent bond sale.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC is scheduled to vote Thursday on orders that would require
the utilities to fully resume purchasing power Jan. 1 and provide
billing mechanisms to pay for the energy bonds.</TE>
<TE>   In adopting DWR's revenue requirement for 2003, the PUC allocated
$1.97 billion of the state's cost of power contracts to Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric Co. customers, $1.88 billion to Southern California Edison
customers and $643 million to San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. customers.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC said it adopted an allocation method that divides the
total cost of DWR's contracts among utilities, based on the quantity
of energy supplied to each utility. The utilities proposed allocation
methods that reduced the costs borne by their own customers.</TE>
<TE>   The water resources department began buying power in early 2001
after wholesale energy prices rose and Edison and PG&amp;E fell into
financial trouble.</TE>
<TE>   When utilities purchase power, the PUC normally reviews the
reasonableness of the purchases.</TE>
<TE>   However, the PUC surrendered that role in the case of DWR's power
purchases to help assure Wall Street that there would be an adequate
revenue stream to repay energy bonds the state issued to replenish
the treasury for energy costs.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC ordered the utilities to resume responsibility on Jan. 1
for purchasing any power needed to make up the difference between
customer demand and the electricity obtained from state contracts and
the utilities' own generation facilities.</TE>

<HD>South Gate Official's Case Goes to Jury</HD>
<DH>Albert Robles is accused of death threats. Some politicians
say tough talk is just a fact of life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Marosi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The criminal case against South Gate Treasurer Albert Robles went to
the jury Tuesday after testimony that portrayed a political world of
profane and crass elected officials, some of whom said threatening
language is part of the game, and others who said such talk made them
fear for their lives.</LD>
<LD>   "You keep on trucking," said state Assemblyman Mervyn M. Dymally
(D-Compton), who testified early in the trial that he has often
shrugged off threats from other politicians in southeast Los Angeles
County. Robles is charged with making death threats against four
people, including two state legislators.</LD>
<LD>   Dymally's testimony reflected a major theme of Robles' defense
during the one-week trial. They said behind-closed-doors political
speech is not to be taken literally: It's part of the unspoken rule
book.</LD>
<TE>   "We all do it," said South Gate Mayor Xochilt Ruvalcaba, who cited
"I'm going to cut you off at the knees" and other rough phrases as
some examples of the threatening language she has heard over the
years.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors contend that people receiving Robles' statements
were so intimidated that they had to watch their backs.</TE>
<TE>   Tough-talking politicians, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jennifer
Snyder, do not have a free pass to make threats. Robles, among other
things, is charged with threatening to rape Sen. Martha Escutia
(D-Whittier) and kill her husband, Leo Briones.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing political about raping somebody. There is
nothing political about shooting them in the head," Snyder said
during her closing argument in Norwalk Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Robles is also charged with threatening the lives of Assemblyman
Marco Antonio Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles) and a South Gate police
lieutenant. All of the alleged threats were relayed through
intermediaries.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys dismissed the case as a political ploy by the
state legislators who, they said, are retaliating against Robles for
their political defeats. Defense witnesses have said the district
attorney's office concocted police reports and tried to put words in
their mouths.</TE>

<HD>Oaks at Peril in Zoning Battle</HD>
<DH>An O.C. home builder and environmentalists are at odds over
the use of land near the Cleveland National Forest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A home-builder and environmentalists will square off at a meeting
today over extensive zoning changes proposed for a scenic canyon area
at Orange County's rugged eastern edge.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Planning Commission is scheduled to vote after a
public hearing at 1:30 p.m. today in the county Hall of
Administration. At issue is whether zoning for 598 acres bordering
the Cleveland National Forest should be changed to allow for
large-scale grading, removal of hundreds of trees and destruction of
other natural resources.</LD>
<LD>   The changes are being sought by Rutter Development Corp. of
Irvine, which wants to build 162 homes on two sites along Live Oak
Canyon and Santiago Canyon roads. They would allow the developer to
remove 493 oak and sycamore trees from the steep foothills and do
extensive grading, according to environmental reports -- work that
would be necessary to carve housing pads on steep ground.</LD>
<TE>   "They would chop them all down," said local activist Ray Chandos.
"This would mean total slaughter."</TE>
<TE>   Chandos helped craft initial stringent zoning for the area
designed to preserve its rural character and natural resources. He
and others are especially worried by a one-word change in the area's
zoning, from "natural" open space to "permanent" open space. Current
zoning requires that 70% of any project area be set aside as "natural
open space," meaning it must be preserved as is. That has hamstrung
would-be developers in the area, because there is so little level
ground to build on; critics charge the word change would open the
door to grading.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not an innocuous change," said Gloria Sefton, a Trabuco
Canyon resident for 14 years and co-founder of the Saddleback Canyons
Conservancy. "This just completely undermines the very essence of
what [the zoning] was enacted to do."</TE>
<TE>   A Rutter official did not return calls seeking comment on the
proposals, which are first steps toward final approval of the Saddle
Crest and Saddle Creek housing tracts. In reports prepared for county
planners, the company has said it will transplant 43 of the
healthiest trees and plant 11,000 seedlings, acorns and smaller trees
to make up for the loss. The company also is offering to dedicate 300
acres of its land as permanent open space.</TE>
<TE>   But the California Oak Foundation has complained to the county
that transplanting large oaks is not likely to work and that
landscaping with trees that would require intensive, long-term care
is not a replacement for the areas that would be destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would be futile, wrote foundation president Janet Cobb.
"These trees will have a short life span."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute echoes a high-profile dispute in Santa Clarita, where
an activist has been living in a 400-year-old oak tree dubbed "Old
Glory" that is slated to be cut down to make way for a road. The
developer in that case, John Laing Homes of Newport Beach, has
pledged to move the tree, though critics doubt the step will succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Other objections to the Orange County proposals have been raised
by federal and state regulators, wildlife and arborist groups and
area residents. A local citizen advisory panel voted against the
proposals last month. If the Planning Commission approves them, they
will be forwarded to the Board of Supervisors for a final vote.</TE>

<LD>The congressman-elect who will replace Gary Condit urged landowners
to fight a plan giving more protection to fairy shrimp and other
wetland species.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a governmental process that has run amok," Dennis Cardoza
(D-Merced) said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan would declare 750,000 acres
in San Joaquin Valley and Sierra foothill counties critical habitat,
which would preserve plants and animals in vernal pools. About
340,000 acres owned by 1,100 people would be designated critical
habitat.</LD>

package, which includes $20,000 for an undisclosed personal-injury
claim.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago, Usher was charged with a petty theft misdemeanor for
allegedly stealing three music CDs -- Andrea Bocelli, Charlotte
Church and a compilation of classical hits -- from a Costco in Santa
Maria. Two trials over the summer ended in hung juries.</LD>
<LD>   Usher also was criticized for splitting his time between his home

<LD>Restoration of the historic Reyes Adobe in Agoura Hills moved a step
closer to reality with the announcement Tuesday of a $400,000 grant
approved by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.</LD>
<LD>   The funding, from voter-approved Proposition 40, will likely be
combined with city funds to cover the estimated $500,000 needed to
fix up the 1820 adobe residence and barn, said Agoura Hills City
Councilwoman Louise Rishoff.</LD>
<LD>   "We'll find a way to make it happen. It's a go," said Rishoff,
adding that the project will go out to bid next year.</LD>

<HD>State's Death Toll From Storms Rises to 6</HD>
<DH>Three women drown as a car is swept off a bridge in
Carlsbad. After brief respite, next onslaught of rain is due
Thursday.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>California got enough of a respite Tuesday from a deadly El Nino
wallop to dig out from the mud and fallen debris, assess the damage
and brace for the next onslaught, expected to slam Northern
California on Thursday and rumble south.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the state's death toll from the pounding rains rose to
at least half a dozen after three women were swept off a bridge in
Carlsbad, north of San Diego, and drowned in their car late Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Two companions were rescued after they scrambled from the
overturned vehicle and clung to its undercarriage.</LD>
<TE>   "The water level was 2 1/2 feet over the bridge. It was completely
under water," said Brandon Webb, 22, who tried to warn the women, who
spoke no English, not to drive across the swollen creek.</TE>
<TE>   Carlsbad police identified the drowning victims as Maria Isabel
Melquiades Mora, 24, and Rosa Maria Marcos Santos and Guillermina
Hernandes Ramos, ages unknown. The women lived in nearby Vista.</TE>
<TE>   In Northern California, a worker trimming trees off rural
California 85 Monday found 48-year-old Sherry Denise Olearczuk dead
in her car. California Highway Patrol officials said Olearczuk
apparently was driving too fast for weather conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The storm killed at least two others in California, two in Oregon
and one in Nevada since the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak, it left 2 million residents without power, the bulk
of them in Northern California and along the northern coast.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, bursts of crisp sunshine were interspersed with
scattered showers and pea-sized hail throughout the state as crews
scrambled to fix the damage. By 4 p.m., 21,000 Bay Area customers
were still without power, but Pacific Gas &amp; Electric crews planned to
work into the night to restore electricity.</TE>
<TE>   In the San Gabriel Mountains, at least two mudslides brought
trouble to roads where the Williams fire in September burned more
than 38,000 acres and left many foothills charred, said Luanne
Schupbach, a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman. Crews were able to
clear the mud by Tuesday morning, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Department of Public Works crews cleared mud
and debris from Bouquet Canyon Road, a primary connector between the
Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. The two-lane road, which had been
closed for 11 miles from Vasquez Canyon Road to Spunky Canyon Road
since Monday afternoon, was expected to be reopened Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Snow caused the CHP to close the Golden State Freeway in both
directions through the Grapevine at 9:15 p.m. Tuesday. It was
expected to remain closed for several hours.</TE>
<TE>   The rains brought needed water to a state that suffered a record
drought this year. In downtown Los Angeles, Monday's 1.96 inches
broke a daily record, set in 1940. Without the rain, L.A. was on
track to post its driest calendar year. "We blew it out of the
water," said National Weather Service forecaster Curt Kaplan.</TE>
<TE>   Today is expected to be the driest day this week, followed by a
heavy 12 to 18 hours of rain on the horizon beginning Thursday night
and showers that could continue through Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We've still got a series of storms coming at us," said forecaster
Stuart Seto.</TE>
<TE>   For snow lovers, that's welcome news. In Los Angeles County, about
two inches fell above 5,000 feet. In the Sierra's Mammoth Lakes, now
fell steadily Tuesday, bringing the two-day storm total to about five
feet, just in time for the holidays.</TE>

<HD>A Small-Business Break</HD>
<DH>The City Council waives late-payment penalties and interest
for firms owing $500 or less per year in business taxes since 2000.</DH>

<LD>Faced with protests from small-business owners, the Los Angeles City
Council voted Tuesday to waive penalty fees and interest charges for
late payments by those who owe the city $500 annually or less in
business taxes.</LD>
<LD>   Council members said setting the limit at $500 will make sure that
the city is helping small businesses and individuals who may have
been unaware of the tax obligation. The waiver covers any penalties
for taxes owed for 2000, 2001 and 2002 and applies only until June
30, 2003. Firms still have to pay their taxes for 2003, which are due
Feb. 28.</LD>
<LD>   "The small business is the backbone of our local economy and we
believe strongly that the city should not chase away business but
actually keep business in the city of Los Angeles," said Councilwoman
Wendy Greuel.</LD>
<TE>   The council action was in response to controversy sparked last
month when the city sent letters to 151,000 people who had reported
business income to the state but had not paid any business taxes to
the city.</TE>
<TE>   The city did not know how many of the 151,000 state filers earned
at least $5,000 annually, which is the threshold for paying city
business taxes, but the letter said that the recipient "may owe
business taxes for conducting businesses within the city."</TE>
<TE>   That resulted in thousands of responses from small business owners
who said they did not know they owed the taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Under the waiver approved Tuesday, a typical business with $85,000
in annual gross receipts that owes $500 in city business taxes is
likely to save $900 in interest and penalties that the city would
otherwise have charged for the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn supported the waiver, even though it could
cost the city $1 million of the $3 million the government had hoped
to collect as part of the crackdown on firms not paying business
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal of this entire program is to increase compliance," said
Deputy Mayor Jonathan Kevles.</TE>

<LD>Two botched robberies led to gun battles in South Los Angeles and
Long Beach on Tuesday that left a hardware store owner and his
customer dead and a convenience store clerk in extremely critical
condition, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The first attack occurred at 1:20 p.m., when three men walked into
Marce's Hardware near 45th and Main streets in Los Angeles with guns
drawn, police said. Store owner Claro Cortez, 44, pulled a gun and
fought back, but he and a customer were fatally shot.</LD>
<LD>   Police officers in a patrol car nearby heard the shots and arrived
moments after the robbers had driven away.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses on the sidewalk directed officers to the suspects, who
were arrested about a block away. One had suffered a shot in the leg.</TE>
<TE>   Cortez and the unidentified customer died at County-USC Medical
Center. The names of the suspects were not released.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of rounds," said Police Det. Greg McKnight.
"Given the confined space, it's amazing more people weren't hit."</TE>
<TE>   The second shooting occurred three hours later when a 23-year-old
gunman walked into a convenience store in the 6200 block of Orange
Avenue in North Long Beach and opened fire on a clerk, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   The clerk returned fire and wounded the suspect before being shot
in the neck, said Long Beach Police Sgt. Paul LeBaron. The
53-year-old clerk was hospitalized in "extremely critical condition,"
LeBaron said.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman was arrested when he showed up at a nearby hospital. He
is expected to survive, police said.</TE>

<HD>Johannessen Is New Veterans Secretary</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carl Ingram</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Newly retired Sen. Maurice K. Johannessen, who twice broke with
fellow Republicans to cast the deciding vote for Senate approval of
Gov. Gray Davis' state budgets, was appointed Tuesday as secretary of
the troubled Department of Veterans Affairs.</LD>
<LD>   Davis announced the appointment of Johannessen, 68, former
chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, at a ceremony
where Johannessen was applauded by veterans in white caps and by
department employees.</LD>
<LD>   But Davis had scarcely administered the oath of office to his
fourth secretary of veterans affairs in as many years when senior GOP
Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine denounced the appointment as a "pure
political payoff" for Johannessen's budget votes.</LD>
<TE>   He said Johannessen's decision to break ranks with Republicans and
join Democrats "means we now face a $30-billion budget deficit.... We
should call him the $30-billion man."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Republicans were miffed the first time Johannessen cast a
vote for Davis' budget, in 2001. But the vote last summer so angered
them that they ousted him from their private strategy meetings and
wouldn't let him back in.</TE>
<TE>   In response to reporters' questions Tuesday, Davis and Johannessen
insisted there was no link between the former senator's votes and his
appointment. They said they had not spoken of the appointment until
last week.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he selected Johannessen, a Shasta County supervisor who
first was elected to the Senate in 1993, not for specific votes he
cast but because of his "spirit to solve problems and rise beyond
partisanship."</TE>
<TE>   Senate leader John L. Burton (D-San Francisco), who helped derail
two previous veterans secretaries appointed by Davis, said he
believed Johannessen would be confirmed. He predicted that he "will
clean up a department that has had problems."</TE>
<TE>   Charles Parnell of Clovis, California commander of the American
Legion, praised the appointment. He said that there's "always
politics" in filling top government jobs but that Davis had "selected
the best man."</TE>
<TE>   For years, the department has been overwhelmed by controversy,
ranging from costly bookkeeping failures to the death three years ago
of a World War II soldier who choked on his broccoli lunch at the
Barstow Veterans Home. Later the same facility lost its
accreditation, an action that forced it to shut down for months, turn
away applicants and lose millions in federal Medicare payments.</TE>
<TE>   The department's defenders say that the Barstow facility has
returned to good standing and that other agency problems were
addressed under the previous secretary, Bruce Thiesen. He was not
confirmed by the Senate but recently returned as the department's No.
3 manager.</TE>

<HD>Board Slashes 70 County Positions</HD>
<DH>Vacant jobs are cut, saving $3.9 million in potential
salaries as board looks to trim the budget. Additional reductions are
likely because of state deficit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Polakovic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a sign of the belt-tightening to come, the Ventura County Board of
Supervisors on Tuesday eliminated 70 positions and indicated that
more trims are likely.</LD>
<LD>   While the cutbacks were relatively modest -- they were vacant
positions -- the action takes away the flexibility to juggle staffs
and ensures that a wide range of government functions will remain
understaffed. Among the positions eliminated were auditors, health
specialists, public defenders and deputies.</LD>
<LD>   With the unanimous action by the board, the county eliminates $3.9
million in potential salaries.</LD>
<TE>   "We are presently trying to downsize government within the means
that are rapidly diminishing before us," County Executive Officer
Johnny Johnston said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the cuts, the district attorney's office was able to
retain five positions targeted for elimination. Last week, the
district attorney unsuccessfully urged the board to provide funds to
retain an anti-gang unit. When the board declined, local and federal
funds were cobbled together to keep the program functioning for one
more year.</TE>
<TE>   California faces a budget deficit of $20 billion or more next year
due to a sluggish economy and last year's energy crisis, forcing
counties to make deep cuts.</TE>

<HD>Signal at Site of Tragedy Is Funded</HD>
<DH>County to pay full cost of light at intersection where teen
jogger died.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Polakovic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More safety measures are planned for a stretch of Santa Rosa Road in
Camarillo to prevent accidents like the one that killed a teenage
girl last year as she jogged with her father.</LD>
<LD>   In response to demands from angry residents, the Ventura County
Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to fund the final portion of a
$200,000 traffic signal at Yucca Drive and Santa Rosa Road.</LD>
<LD>   That intersection was the site of last year's fatality, and the
scene of other accidents and near-collisions that more than a dozen
residents recounted in vivid and chilling detail at Tuesday's
meeting.</LD>
<TE>   Bonny Matley of Camarillo told the board that her car was struck
head-on by another vehicle while she was waiting to make a turn at
the intersection.</TE>
<TE>   Long delays at the corner are followed by sprints to merge onto
Santa Rosa, a back-road shortcut used by about 20,000 commuters daily
between the Conejo Valley and Camarillo, residents told the board.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a near fatality," Matley said. "I almost died. The traffic
goes too fast, and we need a break to get into the flow of traffic."</TE>
<TE>   The board unanimously voted to use development fees to pay the
remaining costs of a traffic signal to be installed early next year.
The board had previously approved funding for a portion of the
signal, as well as safety features including additional signs.</TE>
<TE>   Paul and Dorothy Bonds filed a suit against the county this month
on behalf of their daughter, Jennifer, 14, who was killed while
cross-country training with her father one year ago.</TE>

<HD>Convention Ends With Waters Still Troubled</HD>
<DH>U.S. deadline nears, but no breakthroughs are anticipated
regarding Imperial Valley supply.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>LAS VEGAS -- The Colorado River Water Users Assn. convention -- the
annual gathering of 1,000-plus water officials that is both working
session and holiday party -- ended Tuesday on an unhappy note: Four
California water agencies failed to reach a deal to spare the state a
major reduction in water.</LD>
<LD>   "There are no breakthroughs or developments," said Assistant
Interior Secretary Bennett Raley, the Bush administration's top water
official in the West. "Everyone is getting back on airplanes.... I
see no basis for anything other than [to] hope for a miracle."</LD>
<LD>   Although the four agencies vowed to continue discussions after
they returned home, hope that a deal can be reached before the Dec.
31 deadline seems to be fading.</LD>
<TE>   "It won't happen until at least January, and probably much longer"
after that, said Andy Horne, a member of the Imperial Irrigation
District board. The district is the agricultural agency whose refusal
to sign a deal to send water to coastal San Diego was the buzz of the
convention at Caesars Palace.</TE>
<TE>   Talk like Horne's has infuriated many water officials in the West,
but none more than those in Nevada, which stands to lose a share of
its Colorado River water if the California agencies cannot agree on a
massive shift of water from Imperial Valley farmers to coastal
cities.</TE>
<TE>   "My annoyance level is rising," said Patricia Mulroy, general
manager of the Las Vegas-based Southern Nevada Water Authority. "It's
outrageous that Nevada has to suffer because of California."</TE>
<TE>   The fates of California and Nevada are linked because both receive
so-called surplus water -- more than their legal allotments from the
Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the seven states that depend on the river devised a
plan to give California 15 years to wean itself from its extra water,
with an interim deadline at the end of this year for cutting the
state's historic overdraft.</TE>
<TE>   California is entitled to 4.4 million acre-feet of water a year
and has been drawing an additional 600,000 to 800,000.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada is entitled to 300,000 acre-feet and has been receiving an
additional 30,000. Nevada uses all of its Colorado River water for
municipal needs, unlike California, where 75% of the 4.4 million
acre-feet is dedicated to agriculture in the once-arid Imperial
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   With the Dec. 31 deadline less than two weeks away,
representatives from Colorado, Wyoming, Arizona, Utah and New Mexico
are in no mood to give California more time. Interior Secretary Gale
Norton, in a keynote speech Monday, said shipments of surplus water
to California and Nevada will be suspended Jan. 1 until an agreement
is reached.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada officials say it is unfair to punish their state -- long
praised by federal officials for parsimonious use of water -- for the
water sins of California. In a buzzword that swept this weekend's
convention, Nevada would like a "decoupling" to separate itself from
California on the issue of surplus water.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know if it's doable," Raley said. "We understand there
are issues of equity. But there are also serious legal issues, as
well as concerns from other states."</TE>
<TE>   Nevada has not been alone in demanding that surplus shipments to
California cease so it can reclaim its fair share of the Colorado in
the midst of a drought.</TE>
<TE>   "The rest of the West cannot be allowed to suffer because of
California's lack of planning and discipline," said Rep. James V.
Hansen (R-Utah), chairman of the House Resources Committee. Rep.
Scott McInnis (R-Colo.) added: "California has bilked the Colorado
River Basin states long enough."</TE>
<TE>   The potential cutback in the river's water comes as southern
Nevada is already wrestling with the depletion of local water sources
because of drought and a building boom. An emergency plan of cutbacks
and price increases is being prepared.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the Imperial Irrigation District, the Coachella
Valley Water District, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California and the San Diego County Water Authority vowed to continue
discussions to resolve issues involving money and environmental
protection.</TE>
<TE>   "Keep us in your thoughts over the next 14 days," Maureen
Stapleton, general manager of the San Diego authority, told
conventioneers at a panel discussion. "When you're celebrating New
Year's Eve, we may still" be negotiating.</TE>

<HD>Council Members Cool Opposition to Yorba Linda Homes</HD>
<DH>Two officials say reversing an earlier vote could expose
the city to a developer lawsuit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fearing a lawsuit by a developer, two Yorba Linda City Council
members said Tuesday that they were rethinking their opposition to
the previous council's approval of 1,000 new hillside homes.</LD>
<LD>   "Based on the dialogue with the applicant," said Councilman Ken
Ryan, who had initiated a motion to undo the earlier decision, "I'm
definitely going to advocate that we not put the city in a position
of [being the target of] litigation. I think we're going down the
path of working with the developer."</LD>
<LD>   Newly elected Councilwoman Keri Lynn Wilson, who had initially
sided with Ryan, agreed: "We don't want to violate anybody's rights."</LD>
<TE>   The council was scheduled to vote on the matter Tuesday night, but
no decision had been reached by late evening.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills-based Shappell Industries won approval of its plan
about 1:30 a.m. on Nov. 6, just hours after the polls had closed on
election day.</TE>
<TE>   To accommodate the development, the council voted to amend the
city's General Plan to eliminate open space in favor of new homes,
allow a major extension of Bastanchury Road and increase the area's
density from 300 to about 1,000 homes, including 385 apartments or
townhomes for senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the approval, Shappell agreed to set aside land for the
city's first high school.</TE>
<TE>   Residents opposed to the housing spent weeks gathering signatures
to overturn its approval, but that effort failed. Petition opponents
had warned that overturning the council's decision could delay
construction of the high school for years.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said her concerns regarding the increased density could be
met through negotiations with Shappell. "I want to see the plan
massaged a bit. If we can make improvements in the plan, I think it's
the right thing to do for the community."</TE>

<HD>Firefighter Shot in Northridge</HD>
<DH>The wound is not life-threatening. Owner of burning home
allegedly fired round, and later is believed to have killed himself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein, Michael Krikorian and Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 72-year-old man apparently set his Northridge house afire Tuesday,
shot a responding firefighter, then killed himself in a backyard
shed, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighters arrived about 2:30 a.m. at a house owned by George
Springer in the 9200 block of Encino Avenue. Firefighter Yandell
Bishop said that as he ran to the back of the house, he heard a
gunshot, then felt a sharp pain in his stomach.</LD>
<LD>   "I heard the shot distinctly, and felt the shot," Bishop, 42, said
from his hospital bed. "It felt like a baseball bat hit me across the
stomach."</LD>
<TE>   Two other firefighters seated in the cab of their truck received
minor injuries from flying glass when the driver's side window was
shattered, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Believing they were under attack, firefighters backed away from
the house and called in water-dropping helicopters. The police bomb
squad and SWAT team were also summoned.</TE>
<TE>   Officers found Springer's body at about 7:30 a.m. in a shed behind
the house. A shotgun, handgun and rifle were next to him.</TE>
<TE>   The firefighter's injury was not life-threatening.</TE>
<TE>   Police also suspect Springer was responsible for setting fire to a
boarded-up house he also owned about a mile away in the 9200 block of
Whitaker Avenue. That fire was reported about 1:40 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Family members told police Springer was separated from his wife
and had been going through a "prolonged, adversarial divorce," a Los
Angeles Police Department spokesman said. A recent court ruling
required Springer to sell the Encino Avenue property.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday morning, neighbors were trying to determine what might
have caused Springer to snap.</TE>
<TE>   Some remembered him as a bad neighbor with a nasty temper.
According to Whitaker Avenue resident Jack Clements, Springer once
cut down a neighbor's picket fence with a chainsaw because he
believed it encroached on his property.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions at both of Springer's homes were a source of complaints
from neighbors and city officials in recent years. In July 1999, the
Building and Safety Department ordered him to clean up trash and
debris on the Encino Avenue lot, a spokesman said. Springer complied,
but a new order was issued within months for additional debris.</TE>
<TE>   Springer failed to comply and the matter was referred to the city
attorney's office for prosecution. Records showed Springer had failed
to attend two administrative hearings on the matter last year.</TE>
<TE>   "His place was always a pigsty," said Dan Foster, who lived
directly behind Springer's Whitaker Avenue house. "He was the grumpy
old man who made life miserable for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, remembered Springer as quiet but amiable. One
neighbor said her children warmly referred to him as "the lonely
man."</TE>

<HD>Catholics Pledge Record $16 Million in Donations</HD>
<DH>Scandals don't deter the L.A. Archdiocese's annual drive
for needy schools and parishes.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite this year's sex abuse scandals and economic downturn,
parishioners in the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles have pledged
$16 million to aid their needy parishes and schools -- the highest
figure in the annual fund-raising campaign's 10-year history.</LD>
<LD>   The results from the Together in Mission campaign, published in
the archdiocesan newspaper and distributed to parishioners Sunday,
represents the first measure of whether the clergy sex abuse
scandals, archdiocesan financial problems and other negative news
have affected donations here.</LD>
<LD>   Though some parishes have reported drops in their Sunday
collections, the archdiocese-wide appeal for the poor set records
both for the total amount pledged and the number of donors, which
increased to 106,161 this year, according to spokesman Tod Tamberg.</LD>
<TE>   "Given today's economic realities and negative headlines, the
triumph of this year's Together in Mission brings me more
gratification than ever, because you looked past those headlines and
into your generous and blessed hearts," Cardinal Roger M. Mahony
wrote in a letter to parishioners announcing the results.</TE>
<TE>   As of Monday, the archdiocese had collected $13.8 million, or
86.2% of pledges, Tamberg said. That compares with $13.7 million, or
88%, at this time last year. The campaign usually collects 90% by
year's end, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Parish pledges ranged from $1,220 at Immaculate Conception in the
tiny Santa Barbara County town of New Cuyama to $248,402 at St.
Monica in Santa Monica. St. Monica parish administrator Mike Mottola
said the church had so far collected more this year than last for the
fund, although its Sunday collections were down 10% compared with
last year's. It was the first decline in more than five years, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some parishes, however, reported falling short of their pledges.
The drive began in January just as the sex scandals were breaking in
Boston. Father Stan Bosch, pastor at Our Lady of Victory and Sagrado
Corazon parishes in Compton, said collections were running a few
thousand dollars behind pledges for the first time in four years.</TE>
<TE>   "For a lot of people it's the economy," Bosch said. "Other people
are still suspicious that money raised from independent sources is
going for sex abuse lawsuits or the cathedral."</TE>
<TE>   Tamberg said, however, that the mission fund is strictly
controlled and is used only to help subsidize 44 needy schools and 33
parishes.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony launched the annual campaign not only to share resources
between rich and poor parishes, but to connect congregations too. St.
Mel in Woodland Hills and Our Lady of Victory in Compton, for
instance, have established sister-church ties in which they've
swapped visits of parish councils and choirs. One year, Bosch said,
St. Mel offered $45,000 in surplus mission funds to Our Lady of
Victory.</TE>

<TE>   "For a lot of people it's the economy," Bosch said. "Other people
are still suspicious that money raised from independent sources is
going for sex abuse lawsuits or the cathedral."</TE>
<TE>   Tamberg said, however, that the mission fund is strictly
controlled and is used only to help subsidize 44 needy schools and 33
parishes.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony launched the annual campaign not only to share resources
between rich and poor parishes, but also to connect congregations.</TE>
<TE>   St. Mel in Woodland Hills and Our Lady of Victory in Compton, for
instance, have established a sister-church relationship in which
they've swapped visits of parish councils and choirs.</TE>
<TE>   One year, according to Bosch, St. Mel offered $45,000 in surplus
mission funds to Our Lady of Victory; its St. Vincent de Paul Society
still contributes a few hundred dollars a month to its Compton
counterpart to help aid the homeless and poor.</TE>

<HD>Getting Arts School Off the Drawing Board</HD>
<DH>Public campus in Pasadena has started slowly, short on both
planning and supplies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joe Mathews</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Maaaaaaaaaaaaiiillllllssssss Davis!" shouts Erin Trefry.</LD>
<LD>   "Maaaaaaaaaaaaiiillllllssssss Davis!" reply 20 first graders.</LD>
<LD>   Again, urges Trefry, but somewhat differently.</LD>
<TE>   "Myyyyyylllllllllllllllllllzzzzzzz Daaaaavis!" the students cry.</TE>
<TE>   Singing out the names of jazz greats is one way that students warm
up for art class at McKinley School, a new arts-oriented Pasadena
public school for kindergarten through eighth grade. Under their
teacher's guidance, the students move from the voice exercise to
dancing and then painting, two activities that Trefry sees as closely
connected. This is a teacher who talks to third-graders about the
abstract artist Wassili Kandinsky -- and then asks them to apply his
concept that you can hear color and see sound.</TE>
<TE>   Such high-level arts instruction was supposed to be a main drawing
card at McKinley, one of the most closely watched new school projects
in Southern California. But despite Trefry's classes, much of the
school's arts curriculum appears to be still in warm-up.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena's schools superintendent, Percy Clark, personally called
for the new arts campus as the vanguard of an effort to bring back to
the city's public schools the many middle-class parents who have
chosen private and parochial campuses. While McKinley is a
neighborhood school, slightly more than half of its students are
transfers from other Pasadena areas; of those, school officials say
"several dozen" came from private schools.</TE>
<TE>   Since opening in September, McKinley -- which uses the site and
the name of a long-shuttered campus near the Pasadena Playhouse --
has been dogged by poor planning and a variety of start-up problems,
according to parents, teachers and students.</TE>
<TE>   Textbooks showed up late or not at all. The 850-student school
struggled to fill all its teaching posts, leaving little time for
training and curriculum development. The school lacked money for
supplies and musical instruments (although Clark donated a violin).
Trefry said she has picked through trash bins for supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Parents and students complained about a failure to enforce
discipline -- in hallways and occasionally in the audience during
student performances. Some parents have expressed disappointment that
the school is more traditional public school than "Fame"-style
conservatory.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated, about 20 parents have taken their children out.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Clark acted. Only three months after the
school's opening, he replaced the first principal, Douglas Newton,
with Irene Quinones, a more seasoned principal from the Hacienda-La
Puente School District. While Quinones has been embraced by some
teachers and parents, others have called for Newton's reinstatement.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of turmoil," said Calvin House, who took his two
daughters out of private St. Mark's school to enter them in
McKinley's fifth-grade class. "But I'm optimistic that, with time,
it'll take more shape. Unless something happens, we plan to keep our
daughters here."</TE>
<TE>   All sides agree that the confusion has slowed efforts to develop
the arts elements. A new parents' group has begun meeting to do
something about that. James Smith, the PTA vice president, says the
group has commitments from about a dozen arts groups to help with
instruction; he hopes that McKinley classes will routinely link
academic subjects with the arts during the second semester.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not brain surgery," Smith said. "But right now, the only
example of this linking of the arts is Erin Trefry."</TE>
<TE>   Trefry is not even a full-time teacher. She is one of a handful of
arts "consultants," paid for two days a week. But Trefry -- a painter
who trained at the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts,
Maryland Institute College of Art, in New York and internationally --
is at McKinley nearly every day. She uses it as a base for teaching
in a half-dozen schools and programs across Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   In trying to mix arts and academics, Trefry and her mother, Judy,
who mentors McKinley teachers in introducing arts into their classes,
say the school has had a few successes.</TE>
<TE>   During its classroom unit on the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s,
the students listened and danced to music of the time in Erin
Trefry's classroom, and tried out painting styles of the time. In the
third grade, students will make quilts -- satisfying state
requirements for math (geometry) and social studies (learning about
communities and symbols). Both Trefrys say they are developing arts
lessons that can dovetail with the highly structured Open Court
reading program.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Jorgensen, a seventh-grader, said a history lesson was
enlivened by portraying characters in ancient Rome. Her science
lessons on light and color have been supplemented by painting and art
lessons. In Erin Trefry's exercise inspired by Kandinsky, the
instructor whispered a sound ("Buga Wuga," for example) and asked
students to paint whatever shape it inspired. The resulting paintings
were used as a stage set for a jazz benefit concert by the pianist
Billy Childs and a sextet Saturday night at the school.</TE>
<TE>   "This is about knowing your body and the physicality of art,"
Trefry said.</TE>
<TE>   When first-grade teacher Isaac Huang brought his class into
Trefry's room, they began -- to the music of Miles Davis -- with an
intense warm-up, switching from dance step to dance step. The only
break in the atmosphere came when Trefry checked the first-graders'
shoelaces and paused to make sure no students, in their dancing
excitement, had wet their pants.</TE>
<TE>   Near the end, she turned the class over to Darlene Wilson, a
first-grader who had created her own dance move. It involved
extending both arms in a curl and skipping, right foot over left.</TE>
<TE>   Some students had trouble following along, and Darlene briefly
fought back tears.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always hard when you're first starting out at something,"
Trefry said. "That applies to teaching and just about anything."</TE>
<TE>   Soon Darlene had her classmates following along. And 20
first-graders did her new dance step all the way out the door and
down the hall back to class.</TE>

<HD>Fairgrounds Chief, Citing a Divided Board, Resigns Post</HD>
<DH>Roger Gibbs takes the action one month after he's put on
paid leave. He says the deadlock stymied his ability to act on
various issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Confronted with a deadlocked board of directors, the chief executive
of the Ventura County Fairgrounds on Tuesday resigned the post he
held for three years.</LD>
<LD>   Roger Gibbs, 56, said a 4-4 philosophical split on the board --
and one vacant seat -- has made it impossible for him to make
progress on a variety of issues.</LD>
<LD>   The division was evident at a fair board meeting Tuesday, when
members twice failed to reach a consensus on who would lead the board
next year.</LD>
<TE>   "They were stymied today on the president and vice president. You
don't move forward that way," said Gibbs, who made the announcement
after a one-hour closed session with board members. "If I can't make
that change, someone else has to."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant General Manager Ed Barlow will fill Gibbs' job until
board members hire a permanent replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs' resignation comes about one month after he was placed on
paid leave, without public explanation and amid questions on whether
such action -- apparently ordered without consent of the full board
-- was proper.</TE>
<TE>   Those questions remained unanswered Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Board President Greg Carson said he "can't talk about anything"
related to Gibbs' suspension or resignation.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he does not consider the board split a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fine," Carson said. "Now that we've moved past this issue
-- the staff issue -- I think we can move forward."</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs said he never received a reason for his Nov. 12 suspension.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney, Jonathan Light, said the issue is moot now that
Gibbs has resigned. No court action is planned against the board, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   "He just wants to move on with his life," Light said.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs' supporters who spoke at Tuesday's meeting described him as
a caring and friendly manager who "wasn't afraid to get his hands
dirty."</TE>
<TE>   "Shame on you," fair volunteer Dorothy Fosdick told board members.
"You'll never find anyone who will make a better manager than Roger
Gibbs."</TE>
<TE>   Don Leach, a former fair board member, called Gibbs' resignation a
loss for Ventura County. He also predicted that a flood of volunteer
resignations would follow.</TE>
<TE>   "The community shows their displeasure by not attending events,"
Leach said.</TE>
<TE>   Fair volunteers said the board rift stems from a desire by some to
push traditional, low-profit community activities out of the 62-acre
oceanfront fairgrounds at Seaside Park and turn it into a high-end
entertainment center.</TE>
<TE>   A long-term master plan is being developed for Seaside Park and
the fairgrounds, a collection of aging Quonset huts, stables and an
open-air arena for racing.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers expressed dismay over the divided board, saying they
feared that little would be accomplished in the coming year.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis has yet to appoint the ninth voting member.</TE>
<TE>   "I had hoped that the board would get on with the business it
should, but as I've seen, it's not," longtime fair volunteer Norm
Davis said. "I'd much rather see most of the board leave."</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs, who earns about $93,000 a year to manage the fairgrounds
and the annual Ventura County Fair, will be paid through Jan. 13.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is looking forward to traveling and spending time with
his five sons and four granddaughters. He and his wife, Sharon, will
move from their Ventura home to Banning, where his in-laws live,
Gibbs said.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs came to Ventura after managing the Colusa County Fair in
Northern California for 16 years. He had hoped to work five years
here and then retire, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've enjoyed being here -- it's the best fair in the state,"
Gibbs said.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal was to come here because it's the best, and I wish them
the best."</TE>

<HD>South Korean Election Rivets in L.A.</HD>
<DH>Expatriates, many with political or financial reasons,
choose sides and debate the race, even if they can't vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. Connie Kang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a U.S. citizen, James Oh, a real estate broker from Cerritos,
can't vote in Thursday's South Korean presidential election. But that
hasn't kept him or hundreds of other Korean Americans in the Los
Angeles area from campaigning for the two major-party candidates
vying to succeed South Korean President Kim Dae Jung.</LD>
<LD>   "Korea is in my heart," said Oh, who has been at Los Angeles
International Airport near the Korean Air ticket counter nearly every
day for the last three weeks in an attempt to influence Korean
travelers returning to Seoul.</LD>
<LD>   "Whether we live in Los Angeles or Seoul, who becomes the next
president will impact us," said Oh, who has lived in the United
States since 1982.</LD>
<TE>   From 7,000 miles away, supporters of Roh Moo Hyun, candidate of
the ruling Millennium Democratic Party, and Lee Hoi Chang of the
conservative opposition, the Grand National Party, have been hard at
work since Nov. 26, the start of the official campaign period in
South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight supporters of both sides plan to gather at two Koreatown
hotels to watch election returns into the wee hours of the morning.
Recent polls have shown the race to be very close.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of the election also could alter the political map of
the Los Angeles Korean American community -- the nation's largest.
Los Angeles and Seoul are like two sides of a coin. Family, school,
church, business and political ties bind them.</TE>
<TE>   Since its beginnings three decades ago, Los Angeles' Koreatown has
been dominated by conservatives with money, some with close business
and political ties to South Korea. Many leading figures in Koreatown
are also staunch anti-Communists who support the U.S. military
presence in South Korea -- positions that are generally in line with
Lee's thinking.</TE>
<TE>   A victory by Roh, therefore, could mean a significant realignment
in Koreatown power politics. His supporters are generally younger,
more liberal and lack close ties to the established Koreatown power
brokers, such as those involved in the Korean American Federation of
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Being the president of the Korean American Federation of Los
Angeles is akin to being the ceremonial mayor of Koreatown -- the
person who greets visiting dignitaries from Korea and represents the
community to the outside world. Half of the dozen people who have
served as federation president have used the position as a
steppingstone to seek a political appointment or office in South
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Both campaigns have strong Los Angeles ties.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Park, a former Koreatown real estate agent and talk show
host, is in charge of media relations for Lee. Jay K. Yoo, a former
Koreatown attorney who returned to South Korea to become a talk show
host and then became a member of the National Assembly, holds a
similar post in Roh's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Park and Yoo are graduates of the prestigious Kyunggi Boys' High
School, with many friends, former classmates and supporters in Los
Angeles. The school also counts Lee as a graduate. Among many
immigrant Koreans, school ties are a major bond.</TE>
<TE>   For Los Angeles' large and heavily immigrant Korean American
community, the presidential election in South Korea is the best
distraction in town.</TE>
<TE>   Political talk dominates conversations at Koreatown businesses,
health clubs and churches. Election news fills Korean-language
newspapers and TV and radio broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, large contingents of supporters of each candidate left
for Seoul. They will remain there through the election.</TE>
<TE>   Some are seeking political or business gain -- competing for an
appointment in the new administration or hoping to win business
opportunities. Others want to make connections with the winning camp
that would establish them as power brokers in Koreatown, or at least
guarantee front-row seats when South Korean dignitaries visit Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Many other Korean Americans believe the election will usher in a
new era for South Korean politics because it is the first in which
the three politicians named Kim -- President Kim Dae Jung, former
President Kim Young Sam and former Prime Minister Kim Jong Pil, who
have dominated South Korean politics for more than three decades --
are out of the picture.</TE>
<TE>   The hope for change in the Korean political system is what drives
Oh to spend his time and money to work the homebound travelers at
LAX, he says.</TE>
<TE>   A vote for Roh represents a clean break from old politics and old
leaders, Oh has been telling any Korean willing to listen.</TE>
<TE>   Roh is good for Korea's future because he is able to overcome
regional rivalry that has plagued South Korean politics for so long,
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Across town in the Mid-Wilshire district, businessman Walter Ik
Hyun Cho, 67, has been working the phones every chance he has had to
put in a good word for Lee.</TE>
<TE>   A vote for Lee represents experience, stability and a clean
government, Cho says.</TE>
<TE>   Lee's many years in public life -- as a supreme court justice,
prime minister, national assemblyman and head of the South Korean
equivalent of the General Accounting Office -- outclasses Roh, he
says.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 10 days, supporters of Lee and Roh have held big
fund-raisers in Koreatown hotels that drew hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   Many find themselves tugged in two directions.</TE>
<TE>   Sung Cha Cho, a social worker who runs a counseling agency in
Koreatown, went to both dinners.</TE>
<TE>   She attended Lee's dinner to please her friends, she said, and
Roh's to please "my heart, which is for candidate Roh."</TE>

<HD>Lesbian Teen Sues District for Bias</HD>
<DH>A question about her sexual orientation led to expulsion
from gym class, taunts and insults.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Y. Hong</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last March, a simple question from a classmate pushed Ashly Massey
from her comfortable life as an eighth- grader in the high desert
community of Banning into the midst of a civil rights battle with her
school.</LD>
<LD>   "Are you gay?" a friend asked curiously, without any sign of
hostility, recalled Ashly, now 15. The girls were in the school
locker room, changing after gym class. As she thought of how, or
whether, to answer, Ashly said another student didn't wait for her
answer, loudly blurting out: "She's a lesbian!"</LD>
<LD>   The exchange would lead to Ashly's expulsion from gym class, and
weeks of taunts and insults by classmates about her acknowledged
lesbianism -- actions that at least one state official said were
probably a violation of the Education Code.</LD>
<TE>   Banning Unified School District Supt. Kathleen McNamara said
Tuesday that she would not comment on the case, nor would officials
at the school, but a district official said the school's actions were
improper.</TE>
<TE>   Ashly and her mother, Amelia Massey, described the teen's
experience Tuesday as they announced the filing of a federal civil
rights lawsuit against the Banning district, the superintendent, the
principal and then-vice principal of Coombs Middle School, and Karen
Gill, the physical education teacher who threw Ashly out of class.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Riverside, says the
district violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution. It
seeks changes in school policies to handle harassment of students
based on sexual orientation, as well as unspecified monetary damages.</TE>
<TE>   One gay rights activist said she was not shocked by the incident,
and that gyms and locker rooms are often scenes of the most difficult
confrontations for gay and lesbian students.</TE>
<TE>   Ashly recalled Tuesday that the exchange began almost innocently
with the friend's question about her sexual orientation. But then the
instructor, Gill, pulled her aside.</TE>
<TE>   "She reprimanded me," Ashly recalled Tuesday in an interview at
her house in neighboring Beaumont. "She said, 'It's nobody's business
but yours. Keep it to yourself.' "</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Ashly said Gill told her, without explanation, to go
to the principal's office, where she sat until the physical education
class ended. That became Ashly's routine for the next two weeks,
during which, she said, no one told her why she was barred from class
or whether she was being punished.</TE>
<TE>   She said she soon found herself targeted by classmates who hurled
insults at her. Friends drifted away, invitations to sleepovers
stopped and she saw her name invoked in hateful graffiti around the
campus in the working-class community on the road to Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Ashly, who acknowledges being gay, said she hoped her stand would
inspire other youths. "I hope other kids see me standing up," she
said, "and maybe they'll take a stand too. Nobody should have to hide
who they are."</TE>
<TE>   The Masseys said they had moved two years ago from Palm Desert,
where the large gay population made the teen's sexual orientation
much more acceptable. In that environment, as a 13-year-old, Ashly
came out as a lesbian, her mother said.</TE>
<TE>   Then they arrived in this more conservative, working-class region
of new subdivisions, built atop grazing land, where her newly
declared sexual orientation was not so readily acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   When the taunts reached a crescendo last year, the girl said that
at one point she even packed a bag and considered running away to San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Patterson, president of the Banning Unified school board,
said the board regretted the incident and was sorry that a student
had been treated unfairly.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, we feel bad," Patterson said. "Nothing like this has
happened before. No one should be made uncomfortable due to their
orientation or religion or race, color, creed, national origin."
Patterson said teachers in the 4,000-student district go through
diversity training each year. He would not comment on whether any
staff members were disciplined as a result of the incident involving
Ashly.</TE>
<TE>   Marcia Matthews, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer
representing the Masseys, said the lawsuit is one of the first cases
invoking the Student Safety and Violence Prevention Act, a state law
enacted in 2000 following a series of campus shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Wolfertz, deputy general counsel for the California
Department of Education, said it appeared clear that the girl's
rights were violated.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because this person is a disclosed homosexual ... it would
be illegal to kick her out of the class just for that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Janeane Vigliotti, chairwoman of the Gay, Lesbian, Straight
Education Network in Los Angeles, said she was not surprised by the
incident.</TE>
<TE>   "People get panicky whenever it has to do with sexuality and
they'll do something rash," she said. "Gay children do not like going
to P.E. classes, and this is one of the reasons why."</TE>
<TE>   Ashly, a stocky girl who wears her short brown hair in spikes, is
now in ninth grade at a high school in Beaumont. The family moved to
the neighboring community this summer for reasons that had nothing to
do with the school incident, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Amelia Massey said Banning school district officials and the staff
at Coombs Middle School did little to help her daughter as she was
being taunted. The Masseys believe the initial locker room incident
might have blown over if not for Gill's sharp reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked if there was any misconduct or anything inappropriate.
The teacher said, 'No.' So I said, 'I don't know what to tell you,' "
the mother said.</TE>
<TE>   Massey, who is a registered nurse, said Gill then told her that
other girls were simply uncomfortable having Ashly in the locker
room.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't have been a big deal," Massey said. "They would have
found something bigger and better to talk about."</TE>
<TE>   Ashly said her problems only were exacerbated when other students
saw her sitting in the office day after day. "I felt alienated," she
said. "People would point and laugh at me."</TE>
<TE>   Massey said her daughter initially did not talk to her about the
incident, but she sensed that Ashly was troubled.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the incident, Ashly had to shorten her schedule because
of a medical treatment and so dropped the gym class for the remainder
of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Ashly and her mother said that did not stop the taunts. The mother
called the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco, and a
lawyer there agreed to take on the case. The group joined with the
ACLU of Southern California to file the lawsuit.</TE>

<HD>Lesbian Teen Sues District</HD>
<DH>A question about her sexual orientation led to expulsion
from gym class, taunts and insults.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Y. Hong</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last March, a simple question from a classmate pushed Ashly Massey
from her comfortable life as an eighth-grader in the high desert
community of Banning into the midst of a civil rights battle with her
school.</LD>
<LD>   "Are you gay?" a friend asked, curiously, without any sign of
hostility, recalled Ashly, now 15. The girls were in the school
locker room, changing after gym class. As she thought of how, or
whether, to answer, Ashly said another student didn't wait for her
answer, loudly blurting out: "She's a lesbian!"</LD>
<LD>   The exchange would lead to Ashly's expulsion from gym class, and
weeks of taunts and insults by classmates about her acknowledged
lesbianism -- actions that at least one state official said were
probably a violation of the Education Code.</LD>
<TE>   Banning Unified School District Supt. Kathleen McNamara said
Tuesday that she would not comment on the case, nor would officials
at the school, but a district official said the school's actions were
improper.</TE>
<TE>   Ashly and her mother, Amelia Massey, described the teen's
experience Tuesday as they announced the filing of a federal civil
rights lawsuit against the Banning district, the superintendent, the
principal and then-vice principal of Coombs Middle School, and Karen
Gill, the physical education teacher who threw Ashly out of class.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Riverside, says the
district violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution. It
seeks changes in school policies to handle harassment of students
based on sexual orientation, as well as unspecified monetary damages.</TE>
<TE>   One gay rights activist said she was not shocked by the incident,
and that gyms and locker rooms are often scenes of the most difficult
confrontations for gay and lesbian students.</TE>
<TE>   Ashly recalled Tuesday that the exchange began almost innocently
with the friend's question about her sexual orientation. But then the
instructor, Gill, pulled her aside.</TE>
<TE>   "She reprimanded me," Ashly recalled Tuesday in an interview at
her house in neighboring Beaumont. "She said, 'It's nobody's business
but yours. Keep it to yourself.' "</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Ashly said Gill told her, without explanation, to go
to the principal's office, where she sat until the physical education
class ended. That became Ashly's routine for the next two weeks,
during which, she said, no one told her why she was barred from class
or whether she was being punished.</TE>
<TE>   She said she soon found herself targeted by classmates who hurled
insults at her. Friends drifted away, invitations to sleepovers
stopped and she saw her name invoked in hateful graffiti around the
campus in the working-class community on the road to Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Ashly, who acknowledges being gay, said she hoped her stand would
inspire other youths. "I hope other kids see me standing up," she
said, "and maybe they'll take a stand too. Nobody should have to hide
who they are."</TE>

<KH>Steve Lopez POINTS WEST</KH>
<HD>No Straight Answer From the Feds on Armenian Furor</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Just when it looked like the federal government might have to put a
barbed wire fence around the city of Glendale for reasons of national
security, good news arrived Monday from the crime busters at the U.S.
Justice Department.</LD>
<LD>   Armenian nationals do not -- repeat, DO NOT -- have to report to
the Immigration and Naturalization Service for fingerprinting and
registration.</LD>
<LD>   It was all a mistake, and Armenians can now return to their normal
activities.</LD>
<TE>   Or maybe it wasn't a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   I can't tell, and the really frightening thing is that the Justice
Department can't seem to tell either. After rescinding the order
calling for Armenians to fall in line and be accounted for, a Justice
Department spokesman was asked by The Times about the goof, and
here's what we got out of him:</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say it was a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Well then what was it? And if they couldn't get this right, and
couldn't at least come up with a credible lie, why should we assume
the feds are capable of getting anything else right when it comes to
homeland security?</TE>
<TE>   This all began late last week when Armenia, Saudi Arabia and
Pakistan were added to a list of 18 mostly Muslim nations whose
nationals are required to register if they're male, 16 or older, and
here as students or visitors.</TE>
<TE>   This requirement sent the nation's 1.5 million Armenian Americans
into a frenzy, and California, home to half of them, led the outrage
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Californians sent more than half the 10,000 letters of protests
filed with the White House over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only is Armenia a staunch supporter of the United States, but
Armenian people have had a long history of being integrated into the
fabric of this great nation," said Ardy Kassakhian of the Armenian
National Committee of America's Western regional office in Glendale,
which has roughly 70,000 Armenians.</TE>
<TE>   "Armenia is also a Christian nation surrounded by Muslim
neighbors, and hostile ones at that," he said. "Does anyone even read
history or the newspaper or anything?"</TE>
<TE>   That could be it. This might be a simple case of someone in the
Bush administration having flunked geography, and thinking Armenia
was a suburb of Tehran.</TE>
<TE>   If someone had made a movie called "My Big Fat Armenian Wedding,"
this probably wouldn't have happened.</TE>
<TE>   Other possible explanations? This was a wink and a nod to Turkey,
a strategic ally that has a long history of conflict with Armenia.</TE>
<TE>   Or some mid-level weasel decided it would look bad to have only
one other non-Muslim nation -- besides North Korea -- on the list.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not geography or history or anything like that," insisted
Harut Sassounian, publisher of the California Courier, a weekly
newspaper based in Glendale and serving a national Armenian audience.</TE>
<TE>   "I happen to know through sources in Washington that it was
initiated by someone in homeland security," said Sassounian, who
insists there was an overreaction to a report that Armenia's borders
are not "watertight."</TE>
<TE>   Whose are?</TE>
<TE>   Adding Armenia to the list was all the more absurd, Sassounian
said, when you consider that some of its border countries aren't on
the list even though they've been suspected of having terrorists in
their midst.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. government has troops in Georgia right now to hunt down
Al Qaeda members, and Georgia is not on the list," Sassounian said.
"It's all games, politics and self-serving positions."</TE>
<TE>   If it weren't, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan would have been the first
countries on the list, not the last.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia harbored or produced many of the Sept. 11 terrorists,
and Pakistan is home to schools that are grooming the next generation
of anti-American terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Look, we wouldn't even need the fingerprinting and registration if
the feds hadn't been asleep at the wheel for decades, and actually
kept track of foreigners who were here temporarily.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Bush administration is playing catch-up, still rudderless,
but trying to look like it's doing something useful by rounding up
anybody who doesn't go to the same church as John Ashcroft or Tom
Ridge.</TE>
<TE>   Does anybody think there's a terrorist dumb enough to go down to
the local INS office and introduce himself?</TE>
<TE>   In the new world, I don't know too many people who would object to
the government finally reforming immigration controls.</TE>
<TE>   But is it too much to ask for some consistency and logic, or for
someone to articulate a coherent policy that doesn't remind us of
internment camps?</TE>
<TE>   Why not put Spain and Germany on the list because of the Al Qaeda
operatives in those countries?</TE>
<TE>   Why not all of Indonesia, which has the world's largest population
of Muslims?</TE>
<TE>   Is it religion, geography or trade status that gets you on the
list, or is someone in the White House throwing darts at a map?</TE>
<TE>   And can we really trust Canada?</TE>

<HD>Women Appear to Be on GHB, Expert Says at Date-Rape Trial</HD>
<DH>Alleged victims on videotape with Andrew Luster seem to be
in comas, she testifies. Defense has portrayed the accusers as liars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two young women whose sexual encounters with date-rape suspect Andrew
Luster were captured on videotape appear to be in drug-induced comas
during the alleged assaults, a toxicologist testified Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   UC San Francisco associate professor Jo Dyer told jurors that
based on her review of the tapes, the snoring, groggy women appear to
be under the influence of gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB.</LD>
<LD>   Dyer described the substance as a potent, slightly salty-tasting,
clear and odorless liquid that can easily be slipped into a woman's
drink to render her unconscious within minutes.</LD>
<TE>   "It will knock you out reliably at a certain dose," Dyer
testified. "GHB is very dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County prosecutors charge that Luster, 39, a surfer and
the great-grandson of cosmetics mogul Max Factor, used GHB to
incapacitate at least three women before raping them at his Mussel
Shoals beach house. He is charged with multiple counts of rape of
intoxicated and unconscious women, as well as sexual battery,
poisoning, sodomy and drug possession.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys, who delayed giving an opening statement, have
argued that Luster engaged in consensual sex with the women.</TE>
<TE>   Luster's lawyers have portrayed the women as embarrassed college
coeds who lied about the sexual encounters. The defense has suggested
that corrupt law enforcement officers manipulated the evidence
against their client.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors launched their case Tuesday in Ventura County Superior
Court by calling Dyer, a drug and poison specialist, as their first
witness. She said she began chronicling GHB abuse after first
encountering the drug 12 years ago when called by doctors treating a
severe coma patient at a Bay Area hospital. Since then, she has
documented 88 cases involving GHB abuse and researched 20 deaths
linked to the drug, which was developed in France as an anesthetic.</TE>
<TE>   GHB, which in low doses produces a feeling of euphoria, has gained
popularity among young adults in the dance club scene, in part
because it is easy to manufacture, Dyer said. She told the jury it
could easily be whipped up at home by combining glue remover and
drain cleaner.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors hired Dyer, at a cost of $300 an hour, to offer an
opinion about whether the three women in Luster's case were drugged
and unconscious at the time of the alleged rapes.</TE>
<TE>   Based on her review of two roughly 30-minute videotapes and
statements by the alleged victims, Dyer concluded that the women were
poisoned by GHB.</TE>
<TE>   But defense attorney Roger Jon Diamond challenged Dyer and
questioned whether prosecutors had provided her enough information.</TE>
<TE>   He displayed a large photograph of one of the women, a 21-year-old

whom was shirtless.</TE>
<TE>   The photo was taken at Luster's home after she and her friend
David met Luster and his friend at a Santa Barbara bar.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors concede that the evidence will show that she and David
had sex in the back of Luster's car on the way to the defendant's
house, but say the pair were under the influence of GHB after being
drugged by Luster.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys question the rape allegations in light of the
earlier sexual encounter in the car, and point to the photograph as
strong evidence to back up their theory.</TE>
<TE>   Under Diamond's questioning, Dyer admitted that she was not shown
the photo before reaching her conclusions. But she testified that it
wouldn't have made a difference in her overall opinion.</TE>

<HD>Questions on Newhall Spur Review</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Nicholas Riccardi and Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County supervisors on Tuesday called for a review of
their planning policy in light of criticism that it enabled the
developer of the 22,000-home Newhall Ranch project to quietly destroy
endangered plants on its property.</LD>
<LD>   On a motion by Supervisor Mike Antonovich, whose district includes
Newhall's land, the board directed its staff to survey other
government agencies to see how they ensure full disclosure in their
environmental documents.</LD>
<LD>   The supervisors also requested a timetable of Newhall's report on
the endangered plants. The motion passed unanimously.</LD>
<TE>   "We're asking for this information to ensure the process is fair,"
Antonovich said. "Before we take action, we have to have all the
facts."</TE>
<TE>   A report is due back to the board Jan. 14, two weeks before
Newhall Land &amp; Farming is scheduled to submit a supplemental
environmental study for approval. Supervisors approved the initial
environmental review in 1999, but the development was stalled after
neighboring Ventura County and a group of environmentalists filed a
lawsuit challenging the adequacy of the report.</TE>
<TE>   A Kern County judge threw out the original environmental document
and directed Newhall to provide additional information before it
could move forward. The developer said it has met the requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Newhall hired environmental consultants in 2000 to look for the
San Fernando Valley spineflower on its property but bound them with a
confidentiality agreement. The consultants found one stand of
spineflowers and several other areas of "suspected" flowers that were
never sent to a lab for testing.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Newhall instructed the consultants to stop searching and
reminded them of their confidentiality deal, according to court
records.</TE>
<TE>   In May, state investigators and county prosecutors searched
Newhall's Santa Clarita Valley land and found the remains of numerous
flowers on a swath of property where the company hopes to develop,
according to court papers filed in connection with the search
warrant.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office is investigating the case and has
filed against the developer a misdemeanor charge of unlawfully
altering a streambed.</TE>
<TE>   Newhall, maintaining that it has acted properly, pleaded not
guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Confidentiality agreements such as the one Newhall implemented are
on the rise, officials said. Los Angeles County planners said they
try to combat such agreements by requiring the filing of the full
text of all consultants' reports.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say that the county receives misleading reports
because it allows companies to select their own consultants to review
the environmental impact of development.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups applauded the supervisors' move to reexamine
the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "That is fabulous," said Jan Chatten-Brown, an environmental
attorney who challenged the initial environmental impact report for
Newhall Ranch. "Hopefully, [the planning department] will come
forward with a proposed prohibition on confidentiality provisions.
The best course would be for the county to contract directly with the
consultants, then bill the developers for the cost of preparing
environmental impact reports, as many public agencies do."</TE>
<TE>   County planning staff members said it would be unwieldy to
directly manage consultants for all developments in the region.</TE>

<HD>Parenting With a Hands-Off Attitude</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Offended by the Yorba Linda parents who disciplined their son so much
they ended up in court on child-abuse charges? Who locked him out of
the house overnight because he wouldn't do his homework?</LD>
<LD>   Then consider a father who didn't care what time his kids went to
bed. Who didn't demand they do their homework -- or even insist they
attend school. A father who, after he once pulled the hair on the
back of one of his son's heads in anger, would apologize and then
allow the boy to pull his hair in turn.</LD>
<LD>   I didn't know such animals still roamed the earth, but I met one
the other day in his La Palma home. He's 68-year-old Benny Wasserman,
a delightful Albert Einstein look-alike who with his wife, Fern,
raised three boys to adulthood and whose philosophy of non-discipline
guided their parenting techniques -- even as his wife and most
everybody else figured he was nuts.</LD>
<TE>   Wasserman isn't saying that his approach to child-rearing would
work with every child, but he's confident we'd have a better world if
parents would forget about limits, punishment, demands and rules for
their children.</TE>
<TE>   I'm too chicken to vouch for Wasserman's techniques, or to be glib
and contrast his methods with the severe discipline employed by
Deborah and Grady Machnick of Yorba Linda. This week, an Orange
County jury acquitted the couple on a felony charge and deadlocked on
a misdemeanor abuse charge.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman, a retired TRW manager, certainly isn't gloating over
the Machnick's public skewering.</TE>
<TE>   To the contrary, he'd be among the first to say parenting involves
a lot of luck. He just figures that parenting means letting your kids
have as much freedom as possible to explore and be themselves and
learn from mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   I hear the groaning out there, and Wasserman has heard it, too,
ever since he stumbled upon the book in 1961 that changed his
parenting outlook.</TE>
<TE>   "I had everybody against me," he says, "including my wife and
in-laws."</TE>
<TE>   The book detailed the Summerhill School in England, where children
were schooled in an environment compatible with founder A.S. Neill's
belief that "all outside compulsion is wrong, that inner compulsion
is the only value."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe locking your kid out of the house is a tough decision, but
so is letting your kid speak his mind.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman remembers one dinner-table conversation at which one of
his sons, about 12, told him to "shut up."</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman's father-in-law looked at Wasserman: "What are you going
to do about that?"</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing," Wasserman said, replying that he must have said
something that upset his son.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't parenting about setting limits and controlling behavior?</TE>
<TE>   "It is according to everybody else but me," he says. "Let children
be themselves. To me, that's almost a bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, the subject is too nuanced to explore here.</TE>
<TE>   Still, I figured I better talk to at least one expert, so I picked
middle Wasserman son Craig, 41, one of the two boys who are
attorneys. The eldest is a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Craig remembers shocking his boyhood friends by swearing at his
dad. Wasserman had told his sons they could do that to him whenever
they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I was being raised different than other kids," Craig
laughs.</TE>
<TE>   And now that he's the father of four? How does he see his dad
through the lens of adulthood?</TE>
<TE>   "He's a kick," Craig says. "I think he's ahead of his time."</TE>

<HD>NAACP, Shutters Fail to Resolve Incident at Hotel</HD>
<DH>The association wants recompense for clergy who were
initially denied entry to the Santa Monica facility, which has
apologized.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martha Groves</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To hear a posh Santa Monica hotel tell it, the situation was a
misunderstanding in the midst of a nasty election battle.</LD>
<LD>   To hear some African Methodist Episcopal clergymen tell it, it was
discrimination, possibly racially motivated.</LD>
<LD>   That is how the two sides are framing a September incident that
has prompted the Santa Monica-Venice chapter of the NAACP to
contemplate a protest of Shutters on the Beach.</LD>
<TE>   In early September, four ministers from the Los Angeles AME Church
led a prayer vigil for several dozen supporters of the "living-wage"
initiative on the Nov. 5 ballot in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   After the event ended, the suit-clad clergymen -- Los Angeles AME
Bishop H.H. Brookins; the Rev. Ronald Williams, pastor of First AME
by the Sea in Santa Monica; Presiding Elder Lonnie Wormley; and the
Rev. Greg Ward -- walked to nearby Shutters to have lunch.</TE>
<TE>   As Williams tells it, when they arrived at the hotel driveway, a
parking lot attendant put his hand up and told them they could not
enter. When Williams asked why, the attendant told them to wait while
he got a security guard.</TE>
<TE>   According to Williams, the guard, an African American named Guy
Groves, also told the foursome that they could not enter, saying:
"Windows might get broken."</TE>
<TE>   Williams pointed to Brookins, who is 69, and said, "I am taking
him to lunch." Williams said that Groves repeated: "Windows might get
broken, and it has happened before."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Lichtenstein, a spokesman for Edward Thomas Cos., which
owns the hotel, said Groves was being cautious because protesters
attending previous living-wage rallies had entered the hotel with
megaphones and disrupted business.</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the incident, Groves, the hotel's director of
security, asked the men to wait while he went inside.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't realize how angry this was making me," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really embarrassed and insulted that this would be
happening to me with my superior standing here."</TE>
<TE>   Groves later told the men they could enter, but they declined.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, Williams heard from Darrell Goode, president of the
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People's Santa
Monica-Venice branch and a member of Williams' church.</TE>
<TE>   Goode requested a meeting with Shutters' management. Edward Thomas
Cos. contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the successful
effort by hotels and restaurants to defeat the living-wage
initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Goode, Brookins, Williams and Timothy S. Dubois, president of
Edward Thomas, met in Beverly Hills. Lichtenstein was also there.</TE>
<TE>   At the meeting, Dubois apologized and noted that the parking lot
attendant had called the security guard, who called the hotel's
manager, who called Dubois.</TE>
<TE>   Dubois and Williams agreed that the situation should be resolved.
Among the suggestions were that Shutters contribute to Williams'
church and hold sensitivity training for its workers.</TE>
<TE>   In late October, Goode wrote to Lichtenstein, proposing that
Shutters serve as title sponsor for an NAACP fund-raising dinner, at
a cost of $50,000 to $80,000.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, Santa Monica voters narrowly defeated the living-wage
proposal, which would have boosted the pay of low-income service
workers in the city's coastal tourism zone.</TE>
<TE>   Lichtenstein then called Goode and said the hotel was a small
business that could not afford to sponsor the dinner. He offered to
provide 10 hotel rooms and take a table at the dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Goode called that unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "We look at the clergy as the pinnacle of the culture," Goode said
in an interview. "When you insult that, you insult the whole
community."</TE>
<TE>   Brookins, for one, called the incident a "terrible shock -- worse
than what I saw in the civil rights days back in the 1960s."</TE>
<TE>   For six weeks, Goode said, community members have met about the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, it was referred to the legal redress committee of the
Santa Monica-Venice chapter of the NAACP. On Thursday, he said, the
panel will submit it to the regional NAACP office in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, Shutters said the matter was never racial. "There is
no pattern [of racism] at the hotel," Lichtenstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Some weeks ago, Lichtenstein said, the hotel spent $5,000 on
sensitivity training.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I knew why they have chosen to do what they're doing," he
added, referring to the NAACP. "They're stirring the pot for a reason
that is unclear to me."</TE>

<HD>Supervisors Object to Baca's Sales Tax Request</HD>
<DH>The county board questions the sheriff's timing and the
need for the half-cent increase to be directed to law enforcement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daren Briscoe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a rare show of unanimity, members of the Los Angeles County Board
of Supervisors on Tuesday criticized Sheriff Lee Baca's proposal to
let voters consider a half-cent sales tax for law enforcement and
then shelved the idea for now.</LD>
<LD>   Rejecting Baca's argument that the tax was important to restore
local control over law enforcement spending, the supervisors
questioned both the timing and necessity of a new tax. Their move
appeared to signal the demise of the proposal, which Baca has been
touting for the past month.</LD>
<LD>   People who purchase goods in Los Angeles County now pay 8.25 cents
per dollar in sales taxes; if placed on the ballot by the supervisors
and approved by county voters, Baca's proposal would raise that to
8.75 cents. It would raise as much as $500 million a year.</LD>
<TE>   Baca, whose budget is reviewed and approved by the county
supervisors, first proposed the tax after Los Angeles voters last
month approved Measure B, a property tax to help pay for emergency
and trauma care services.</TE>
<TE>   He said Tuesday that one-third of the money raised by the proposed
law enforcement sales tax would go to trauma care, and that
dedicating the other two-thirds to law enforcement would help ensure
that "sales tax revenue is kept in Los Angeles County, not sent up to
Sacramento."</TE>
<TE>   Although four supervisors eventually supported Measure B, they
made clear Tuesday that they are unlikely to ask voters to approve
the tax increase being advocated by Baca.</TE>
<TE>   They also dismissed Baca's suggestion that the tax would benefit
public safety throughout the area, instead arguing that it was
largely intended to protect the sheriff's own department. Supervisor
Zev Yaroslavsky, for instance, said that only about half of the
county is policed by the Sheriff's Department, with the other half
policed by the Los Angeles Police Department or municipal
departments.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAPD isn't going to get a nickel out of this, and [they
cover] 35% or 40% of the county. Long Beach police will get nothing.
Pasadena police, nothing," he said. "This is a tax largely for the
Sheriff's Department, no matter how you slice it."</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors referred repeatedly to their continuing concerns
about the county's health department deficit, currently estimated at
more than $210 million. As they have on previous occasions, the
supervisors urged state officials to address that problem, which they
say is too big to be resolved locally.</TE>
<TE>   "The next time we have a sales tax increase, I would really like
to see a statewide increase," Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke
said. "We have to address this issue of health."</TE>
<TE>   Even Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who rarely opposes motions
related to law enforcement, said he supported a redistribution of
existing taxes, but not a new tax.</TE>
<TE>   "We are already paying one of the highest sales taxes in the
United States," Antonovich said. "Sacramento has hijacked those
funds, and what we need is a statewide initiative that would
distribute the sales tax so that public safety has a priority."</TE>
<TE>   With the divisions between the sheriff and supervisors stark,
Tuesday's meeting was marked by several sharp exchanges.</TE>
<TE>   After Yaroslavsky referred to the Sheriff's Department's
$1.6-billion budget, Baca retorted: "I need over $2 billion,
supervisor, and the question is what you need, not what you get."</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky said Baca would have an opportunity to make his case
to the taxpayers, and that Baca deserved "a Pulitzer prize" if he
could convince voters that the department needed more.</TE>
<TE>   Baca -- who is elected independently of the board and represents
the entire county, not a single district -- replied by noting that
the supervisors also plead for more although they have a far bigger
budget than his. "You have a budget of $16 billion, and that's still
not enough," Baca said, his voice rising.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand your point that you're underfunded," said Burke.
"Everyone is underfunded."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Gloria Molina said that funding decisions are probably
best delayed until after January, when Gov. Gray Davis will submit
his spending plan for the coming fiscal year. "I think we have to see
what the state budget is going to do," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The board will reconsider Baca's request to schedule public
hearings on the matter in March.</TE>

<HD>Crash Victims Flew Together Often</HD>
<DH>Santa Ana pilot and an Oceanside woman were en route from
Arizona when their plane went down in Anaheim Hills, her husband
says.</DH>

<LD>A man and woman killed Monday when their small plane clipped a power
line and slammed into the garage of an Anaheim Hills home were
returning from a trip to Arizona, family members say.</LD>
<LD>   Coroner's officials identified the passenger Tuesday as Noreen
Kammer, 49, of Oceanside.</LD>
<LD>   Officials did not release the name of the pilot because his
relatives had not been notified, but Kammer's husband, Randy,
identified the pilot and plane owner as his friend of 22 years,
Eugene James, 60, of Santa Ana.</LD>
<TE>   Randy Kammer said James planned to retire in Arizona. He and
Noreen Kammer had driven to Prescott, Ariz., Thursday evening to
visit his newly built home and to register his truck. They were
expected home late Monday, although he said they did not have plans
to fly.</TE>
<TE>   Noreen Kammer and James left Oceanside early Monday afternoon in
James' 1959 Piper Cherokee. The single-engine plane crashed in bad
weather about 2:30 p.m. as it was preparing to land at John Wayne
Airport, officials said. The plane clipped power lines and a tree
before it hit the home in the 800 block of South Sapphire Lane,
setting off a fire in the garage.</TE>
<TE>   "What they were doing in a plane, in that weather, I don't know,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Kammer and the couple's only child, Max, 16, visited the
crash site Tuesday to place poinsettias, roses and a Christmas card
at a makeshift memorial nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "She was very kind, with the biggest heart," Randy Kammer said.
"I'm numb, in shock. I needed some closure. Seeing the place where
she passed away brings me comfort. I can't explain why, but she's in
a better place."</TE>
<TE>   Under gray and rainy skies Tuesday, officials with the National
Transportation Safety Board pulled pieces of the wreckage out of the
garage and loaded them onto a flatbed truck for further
investigation. Weather may have been a factor in the crash,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowner Karen McEwen had left about 30 minutes before the
accident to pick up her son from school, neighbors said. She returned
Tuesday to pick up important papers from the house but wound up also
offering her condolences to Noreen Kammer's family.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so sorry for your loss," she said as she hugged father and
son.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Kammer said James owned a Santa Ana welding and fabrication
shop, had never married and didn't have any children. He was a
"fanatic with mechanical abilities" and recently installed a new
radio and leather interior in the plane, which he had owned for about
10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "He was good with his hands, fixing cars, motorcycles, hot rods
and anything in that plane that didn't have to be approved," Randy
Kammer said. "He was a competent guy.... I never had second thoughts
about his flying abilities."</TE>
<TE>   He said his wife and James, who was rated to fly with instruments
alone, flew together often, taking trips to Nevada, Arizona and Santa
Catalina.</TE>
<TE>   "She was so happy whenever she could fly," Max Kammer said. "She
just loved cruising the skies."</TE>
<TE>   Noreen Kammer was a homemaker who loved to find treasures at
estate sales and took daily walks near the Oceanside Pier to collect
seashells.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be a tough Christmas," Randy Kammer said. "The
tree is going to be empty because we were waiting for her to come
home so we can all decorate it."</TE>

<HD>Tustin Will Pay to End Dispute With Schools</HD>
<DH>The city will hand over $60 million to Santa Ana Unified
ahead of schedule. Most of it will fund construction of a new high
school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Yi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tustin has agreed to pay Santa Ana schools $60 million by Dec. 27,
closing the book on a protracted land dispute that threatened
redevelopment of the former Tustin Marine Corps Air Station and
jeopardized funding for new campuses in the overcrowded district.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the money will go to speed construction of a 2,500-student
high school in the rapidly growing southwest area of the city, Santa
Ana Unified School District officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The decision also means Tustin will be free to zone the 1,600-acre
former helicopter base for commercial and residential use, a step
that has been delayed by the legal tussle.</LD>
<TE>   "This will put the dispute behind us," said Tustin Councilman
Jeffery M. Thomas, who with his colleagues voted unanimously Monday
night to approve the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana school officials Tuesday praised the decision, which
will provide immediate funding for the future Segerstrom High School
on 38 acres of the old Armstrong Ranch at MacArthur Boulevard and
Raitt Street.</TE>
<TE>   Construction Money</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Unified, which bought the land this year, was scrambling
to find money to build the school.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have complained about the slow pace of school construction
in the district, which passed a $145-million bond measure in 1999.
The district has qualified for an additional $127 million in state
matching funds for new schools.</TE>
<TE>   The Segerstrom campus could cost as much as $100 million, and
about half that amount will come from state matching funds, district
officials said. Any remaining Tustin settlement money would go toward
other school construction projects.</TE>
<TE>   District officials are eager to start work on the high school,
which could open as soon as 2005. With November's passage of
Proposition 47, the $13-billion statewide school construction bond
measure, demand and fees for school construction services are
expected to rise quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "We really need to start building some new schools soon," said
Margie Brown, the district's director of facilities planning.</TE>
<TE>   Officials on both sides said Tuesday they hoped this is the final
chapter in the eight-year legal battle over the Tustin base, which
closed in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   When the federal government announced plans to close bases nearly
a decade ago, it pledged that local agencies, including school
districts, would benefit from the land windfall. But under plans
drafted by Tustin, which was charged with converting the helicopter
station to civilian use, Santa Ana Unified was left without land. It
sued.</TE>
<TE>   The parties appeared to have settled their differences last May,
when Tustin agreed to pay $60 million in two installments next year
if the district forfeited its claim to base land.</TE>
<TE>   The parties returned to court in November when Santa Ana rejected
the form of collateral Tustin wanted to use to pay its pledge. The
school district wanted a letter of credit it could convert easily to
a bank loan and immediate cash for school construction. The city
offered a deed of trust on about 100 acres of base land, which school
officials said would complicate and delay their efforts to secure a
loan.</TE>
<TE>   A judge barred Tustin from zoning the base until the matter was
resolved.</TE>
<TE>   'Very Pleased'</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the city negotiated a loan of its own from investment
banking firm Salomon Smith Barney and now will pay Santa Ana Unified
the $60 million ahead of schedule, both parties said Tuesday. The
money is to be deposited in an escrow account by Dec. 27, when the
district has agreed to ask the judge to lift the zoning ban.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very pleased," said attorney Edmond M. Connor, whose firm
represents the school district. "We've been polishing our dancing
shoes to celebrate."</TE>
<TE>   Tustin City Manager William A. Huston conceded that dealings with
the school district "have been acrimonious" over the years.
"Sometimes these things have to work their course," he said.</TE>

<HD>2 U.S. Men, Afghan Injured by Grenade</HD>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Two U.S. soldiers and their Afghan interpreter were wounded Tuesday
afternoon when a teenage boy, later identified as an Islamic
militant, threw a grenade into their jeep at a busy intersection near
the capital's Blue Mosque.</LD>
<LD>   The Americans and their assistant, who weren't immediately
identified, were rushed to a hospital operated by the foreign
peacekeepers that patrol Kabul.</LD>
<LD>   Both Americans were in stable condition, and the interpreter
suffered only light wounds, said British Maj. Gordon Mackenzie, a
spokesman for the peacekeeping force.</LD>
<TE>   The teenager, who was arrested by police, was described by Afghan
authorities as a native of the rural province of Khowst, a former
stronghold of the Taliban movement. He had recently trained at a
Pakistani religious academy and was acting on instructions from an
Islamic extremist group, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A policeman at the scene, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
a second man tried to throw a grenade at the vehicle but was tackled
by a fruit vendor. He was also arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Police who questioned the 17-year-old, identified variously as
Amir Khan or Amir Mohammed, said he spoke English, was well educated
and expressed strong anti-American feelings.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I am a Muslim and I don't want Americans here,' "
Interior Minister Taj Mohamad Wardak said. "We should take this very
seriously. It is the beginning of a larger campaign of terrorism in
Kabul." He said the attacker "definitely belonged to a network. He
was not an ordinary boy."</TE>

<HD>Oh, Little Town Lies Still Indeed</HD>
<DH>No decorations or festivities are marking this year's
Christmas in Bethlehem. It's 'the most unhappy' the mayor can
remember.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>There's room at the inn. In fact, at the Bethlehem Hotel, all 210 of
them are available.</LD>
<LD>   Not a single Christmas booking has been made at the comfortable,
well-appointed hotel just down a gentle slope from Manger Square,
where tradition says Christ was born. And the establishment's
Palestinian proprietor, Elias Arjah, isn't expecting any last-minute
rush.</LD>
<LD>   "God help us -- not even one guest," he said, speaking over tinny
Christmas tunes echoing through the cavernous, deserted lobby. "No
one, absolutely no one, wants to spend this Christmas in Bethlehem."</LD>
<TE>   The biblical birthplace of Jesus, now a Palestinian city of 28,000
set in the stony hills south of Jerusalem, has been occupied for
nearly a month by Israeli troops who moved in after a suicide bomber
from the Bethlehem area killed 11 Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers are unlikely to be withdrawn before Christmas,
Israeli officials say, citing what they describe as the continuing
threat of more terrorist attacks originating from the city and its
environs.</TE>
<TE>   "We are assessing the security situation on a daily basis," said
Capt. Sharon Feingold, an Israeli army spokeswoman. "We will try to
make every effort to ease restrictions on the civilian population and
allow festivities to go on as usual."</TE>
<TE>   Festivity, though, is in short supply. The traditional Christmas
Eve midnight Mass will be held in the Church of the Nativity, but
only a smattering of pilgrims and worshipers are expected.</TE>
<TE>   In past years, choral concerts and parades were held in Manger
Square before the Mass began -- a sometimes raucous open-air party,
complete with all manner of Palestinian fast food -- but no
celebrations are planned this year.</TE>
<TE>   A week before Christmas Eve, at a time when pilgrims would once
have jammed the ancient basilica, the church and its rain-soaked
stone plaza were deserted except for a few ragged Palestinian
children begging for spare change.</TE>
<TE>   The Roman Catholic parish priest, Amjad Sabarra, said the city is
shadowed by a 39-day siege of the basilica and adjoining buildings in
April and May.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops, tanks and sharpshooters surrounded the square
after Palestinian gunmen took shelter inside the church. The standoff
finally ended with an agreement that sent most of the wanted men into
exile.</TE>
<TE>   "What a terrible time that was," said Sabarra, who was inside
during the siege. "I would never have imagined such things would
happen here, in the mother of our churches."</TE>
<TE>   To protest the Israeli decision not to allow Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat to travel to Bethlehem for Christmas
observances, the city fathers decided to refrain from putting up any
holiday decorations, eschewing the holiday lights, the fully trimmed
Christmas tree and the giant inflatable Santas that once loomed
incongruously on the corners of old stone streets.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, who has been confined for months to his headquarters in
the West Bank city of Ramallah, was also barred from the observances
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, when control of Bethlehem and other major Palestinian
towns and cities was handed over to the Palestinian Authority as part
of what was then an ongoing peace process, the Palestinian leader had
been a fixture at the annual festivities. Although a Muslim, he
always attended the Mass, greeting visiting dignitaries and
diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, a strict curfew broken by unpredictable interludes has
kept most Palestinians in Bethlehem indoors.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to hurry -- I don't know how long we have," said Imam abu
Ali, a 42-year-old widow and mother of four, her brow creased with
worry. "I don't have the money to buy much, but I must find some food
for my children."</TE>
<TE>   Bethlehem's economy, like that of most Palestinian towns, has been
devastated during 26 months of fighting, and residents say the
resulting hardship is unrelenting.</TE>
<TE>   Unemployment is running close to 70%, according to Mayor Hanna
Nasser. In grocery stores, many of those buying food Tuesday were
doing so with Red Cross vouchers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most unhappy Christmas I can remember," said Nasser,
a native of Bethlehem whose family traces its roots in the city back
several centuries. "Where will all this suffering end?"</TE>
<TE>   On the Israeli side, a few voices warned of damage to Israel's
reputation if it is perceived as repressing religious observances by
the diminishing Palestinian Christian community. Bethlehem was once
overwhelmingly Christian; now its Christian inhabitants make up less
than half the population.</TE>
<TE>   "The damage inflicted on us in the eyes of the Christian world and
the international community if we remain in Bethlehem during the
holidays is huge," reserve Gen. Danny Rothschild, a former military
governor in the West Bank, told Israeli radio Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In a souvenir shop just off Manger Square, owner Tony Michael said
he had abandoned his daily cleaning of his inventory of carved
olive-wood Nativity scenes and mother-of-pearl crosses.</TE>
<TE>   "I might as well let the dust have it all," he said. "No one is
ever going to come and buy."</TE>

<LD>Timidly sniffing the air, 20 rare Asiatic black bears crept into a
27-acre sanctuary prepared to save them from farmers who take the
animals' bile for traditional Chinese medicine.</LD>
<LD>   The site, in a bamboo forest in China's southwest, is financed by
a Hong Kong charity as part of efforts to stop "bear farming," which
involves surgically implanting tubes to drain the bile from captive
animals.</LD>
<LD>   Injuries and illness suffered by caged bears led to criticism from
environmentalists, who say there are herbal and synthetic
alternatives to the bile.</LD>

in the 1992-95 Bosnian war.</LD>
<LD>   The tribunal heard arguments to determine a sentence after she

<HD>Congo, Rebel Groups Sign a Peace Deal</HD>
<DH>Pact reached in South Africa is an attempt to end a
conflict that has lasted four years and claimed 2.5 million lives.
But doubts remain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Solomon Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PRETORIA, South Africa</DL>
<LD>The Congolese government and several armed rebel groups signed a
peace accord Tuesday aimed at ending a four-year civil war that
claimed 2.5 million lives and raising hopes for greater stability
throughout Central Africa.</LD>
<LD>   President Joseph Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo and
four vice presidents will lead a transitional government and share
power until elections in 2006, according to the plan brokered by
South Africa. Negotiators sang and embraced when the deal was signed
at 2 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's agreement followed months of talks between the
government and the militias, which fought what eventually became a
six-nation conflict often called Africa's First World War. Congo has
already signed agreements with neighboring Rwanda and Uganda that led
to withdrawals of foreign troops.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the militias are still active, but diplomats, led by South
Africa, were hoping that the agreement would finally end the
violence.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at a leadership meeting of South Africa's ruling African
National Congress near Cape Town, President Thabo Mbeki said he was
confident that the peace deal would stick.</TE>
<TE>   "It should bring about peace. It should bring about the
reunification of the Congo. It should bring about the possibility of
the Congolese people once again, for the second time, of deciding who
they want in their government," Mbeki said.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts and participants said that unity might be hard to
come by for groups that have been trying to kill one another for so
long.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have been fighting each other for so many years, we
cannot fool ourselves," said Thomas Nziratimano, chief negotiator for
the Congolese Rally for Democracy, one of the rebel groups.</TE>
<TE>   Congo has been ruled by dictators and racked by internal wars
since the 1960s, when the United States helped overthrow Patrice
Lumumba -- the country's only democratically elected president -- and
install dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. In 1997, warlord Laurent Kabila,
father of the current president, drove Mobutu into exile, where he
died. The senior Kabila was later assassinated.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to this civil violence, Congo -- with its thick forest
cover, its central location and rich reserves of gold, copper and
diamonds -- became a haven and a staging ground for foreign rebels
fighting their own wars in Burundi, Rwanda, Sudan and other
neighboring nations.</TE>
<TE>   The Congolese civil war started cooling off after Joseph Kabila
was sworn in as president in 2001, 10 days after the assassination of
his father.</TE>
<TE>   "This would have never happened with" Laurent Kabila in power,
said Bene M'Poko, Congo's ambassador to South Africa and one of the
country's negotiators. "We have quality leadership in the person of
Joseph Kabila -- he brought new ideas to the table."</TE>
<TE>   South Africa also played a central role. Mbeki's administration
has been involved in the peace process in Congo since the South
African's 1999 inauguration. And a resolution in Congo would help
fulfill one of Mbeki's self-designated mandates as the chairman of
the newly established African Union -- to end wars in the region and
foster stability and economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   International pledges of assistance and, in Congo, broad support
for ending the war also drove the process, M'Poko said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are receiving real pressure back home," he said. "People were
threatening to burn down politicians' houses if we did not come back
from South Africa with an agreement for peace. And our soldiers are
tired of fighting. Many are asking themselves, 'What am I fighting
for?' And the leadership can't answer them."</TE>
<TE>   The peace negotiations have already had a salutary effect in
Burundi, where government and rebel forces have agreed to a fragile
cease-fire and are tentatively working toward a transitional
government.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mbeki succeeded in persuading Rwanda to withdraw about
30,000 troops from Congo last summer, loosely knit militias are still
rampant in border areas.</TE>
<TE>   "That issue is not yet resolved," Nziratimano said. "The country
is infested with militias, groups like the [Congolese] Mai-Mai
militia and Interahamwe from Rwanda. Even those militia groups that
had people at these negotiations don't necessarily represent members
on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Peace negotiators say the task of rebuilding Congo's ruined
economy will be difficult. Donor nations and nongovernmental
organizations pledged $2.5 billion to a peaceful Congo. But even that
might not be enough in a country where industry is at a near
standstill and most foreign investors fled years ago. Annual per
capita income is only $550, and the annual inflation rate is at 358%.</TE>
<TE>   Diseases are also rampant. Malaria has returned to Congo River
communities, and as of 1999, more than 1 million people had the human
immunodeficiency virus in this country of 55 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time we get our act together," M'Poko said. "Our real
enemies are poverty and disease."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>After days of contention, a conference of Iraqi opposition groups
agreed Tuesday on the membership of a committee to shape Iraq's
future in the event President Saddam Hussein is deposed.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials hailed the conference as a successful display of
Iraqi opposition to Hussein, although the meeting served as much to
amplify the exiles' divisions as it did to quell them.</LD>
<LD>   The 65-member committee was made more than three times as large as
originally planned to accommodate the political, ethnic and religious
factions jockeying for power in any post-Hussein Iraq. Shiite
Muslims, largely denied political power under Hussein and his Sunni
Muslim predecessors, hold nearly half the seats.</LD>
<TE>   The exiles will reconvene Jan. 15 in Kurdish-controlled northern
Iraq to decide on the committee's leadership, said Ahmad Chalabi,
head of the Iraqi National Congress, an umbrella organization of
opposition groups.</TE>
<TE>   But even as leaders joined in a news conference to proclaim unity,
the closing session was marred by a walkout of delegates of five
Shiite Muslim groups who said they opposed the apparent dominance of
the largest Shiite party, the Supreme Council for the Islamic
Revolution in Iraq, on the committee.</TE>

<HD>Germans Were Chief Weapons Supplier to Iraq, Paper Reports</HD>
<DH>The daily claims it saw Baghdad's weapons list. Most of the
reported trade was considered legal and took place before the
embargo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeffrey Fleishman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>German corporations were by far the largest suppliers of technology
and hardware to Iraq's military industry over the last 30 years,
according to a German newspaper that claims to have glimpsed the
recently released Iraqi weapons declaration.</LD>
<LD>   The report in the left-leaning daily Die Tageszeitung on Tuesday
details the past involvement of companies, institutions and
individuals who exported materials to Iraq's chemical, biological and
nuclear industries. The newspaper reported that U.S. authorities were
investigating whether a German microelectronics company was trading
with Iraq throughout the 1990s in violation of U.N. economic
sanctions. The name of the company was not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   For the most part, however, the newspaper account is another
indication that the Iraqi regime has revealed no significant evidence
about any current programs for weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<TE>   Much of the material cited by the newspaper -- which says it had
at least partial access to Iraq's nearly 12,000-page weapons
declaration -- appears to bolster Washington's argument that Baghdad
is trying to obscure recent attempts to build chemical and nuclear
weapons by dwelling on known programs of the past. Most of the trade
reported by the newspaper was considered legal and occurred before
the 1990 embargo imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   The Tageszeitung report is expected to create a buzz in Europe and
prompt a reexamination of Germany's role in arming a nation that
today is being scoured by U.N. weapons inspectors while teetering
close to war with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I think those companies not named in public until today will
probably check their books to find out if there is something they
should be concerned about," said Otfried Nassauer, director of the
Berlin Information-Center for Transatlantic Security. "They will look
to see if shipments were made that were not approved by the sanctions
committee."</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper reported that Iraq's weapons declaration listed 150
international firms as suppliers to its military industry. At least
80 of those -- more than the combined total of all other nations --
were based in Germany. The U.S. was the second-largest supplier, with
24 firms exporting to Baghdad. Other supplier countries included
France, Britain, Egypt, Switzerland and the Czech Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Although much of the information in the newspaper's account isn't
new, it would be the first time that Iraq, through its weapons
declaration, had publicly acknowledged its military suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   The weapons declaration, according to the newspaper, "contains
numerous hints about cases in which German institutions and
government authorities, including the federal Economics Ministry,
especially from the 1970s until the Gulf War of 1991, have tolerated
and partly promoted illegal arms cooperation with Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   The German government said it would not respond to the newspaper's
account because it hadn't seen the Iraqi document. The government
investigated illegal arms sales in the early 1990s, and a spokesman
for the Economics Ministry said Tuesday that there "have been a
couple of cases in violation of the embargo."</TE>
<TE>   Die Tageszeitung said its reporting was based "on a complete
original" of the Iraqi declaration. The article followed a report
this year in Der Spiegel newsmagazine about a 58-year-old German
exporter, identified as Bernd S., who teamed up with an Iraqi
businessman in the late 1990s and shipped parachutes, flak jackets
and drills used in artillery production to Baghdad. The Iraqi,
identified as Sahib al-H., was arrested in Bulgaria two weeks ago.
The case is expected to come to trial early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Germany and many other Western countries, including the U.S., were
heavy exporters to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's war machine in
the 1970s and '80s, when Iraq was an ally amid the turmoil of the
Middle East. The U.S. and other countries sided with Iraq throughout
the 1980s in its war against Iran. There was little restriction on
military trade, and when the Persian Gulf War erupted in 1991, many
European and U.S. firms tried to skirt the trade embargo.</TE>
<TE>   Germany has held numerous trials for managers and corporations
accused of illegally trading with Iraq. One included charges against
Rhein-Bayern Fahrzeugbau, which exported more than 1,000 ignition
systems for Styx and Scud missiles that could carry biological and
nuclear warheads. The company's owner, Anton Eyerle, who belonged to
the far-right National Democratic Party and was an admirer of
Hussein, was sentenced to more than five years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Rheining Haus Corp. was fined $75,000 by the German government for
shipping 24 tons of phosphorous oxychloride to Iraq in 1994-95. The
substance, according to authorities, may have been used in Iraq's
chemical weapons industry.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the trade by German companies dealt with "dual-use" items,
meaning goods such as hospital equipment that could have been
reconfigured to fit into the weapons industry. Corporations contend
that they should not be held accountable for such practices.</TE>
<TE>   "Germany really played a major role in equipping Iraq with
dual-use goods that ended in the weapons of mass destruction industry
throughout the 1990s," Nassauer said. "They included measuring
devices, dual-use goods in medical fields and production facilities.
There was even a case in which a dough-mixing bakery machine ended up
in Iraq's chemical weapons industry.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed strange that so many of those machines were being
ordered. You had to wonder who was eating all that bread."</TE>

<CX>   Germany's business with Iraq -- An article in Wednesday's Section A
about German business dealings with Iraq provided incorrect
information. In the quote published, an analyst said, "Germany really
played a major role in equipping Iraq with dual-use goods that ended
in the weapons of mass destruction industry throughout the 1990s." It
was actually in the 1980s.</CX>

<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>A team of U.N. inspectors visited Baghdad University on Tuesday while
another group headed to the northern Iraqi province of Mosul to
search for weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   Biological and nuclear teams left for Mosul, about 250 miles north
of Baghdad, the capital, at dawn.</LD>
<LD>   A United Nations spokesman said that they would stay overnight but
that he had no details of their mission.</LD>
<TE>   At the university, at least eight inspectors entered labs in the
medical and biotechnology departments.</TE>
<TE>   The search came a day after U.N. biology experts, acting on
information in Iraq's voluminous weapons declaration, searched a
genetics institute at the school.</TE>
<TE>   Lamees Gregor, dean of the biotechnology department, said some
classes were interrupted so professors could speak with the
inspectors or open labs. "They inquired about some scientists,
researchers and professors in the department and took their names,"
she said.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Says Al Qaeda Is Active in 40 Countries</HD>
<DH>Terrorist network has opened new training camps in
Afghanistan, according to a report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Al Qaeda continues to command an extensive network of well-financed
terrorist operatives in 40 countries and has opened new training
camps in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistani border to prepare a
new generation of Islamic extremists for attacks on the West, a U.N.
report released Tuesday says.</LD>
<LD>   "Let's face it, the sympathy for this organization is actually
quite widespread in many countries," Michael Chandler, the report's
chief author, said.</LD>
<LD>   The report cites the recent bombings aimed at tourists in Bali,
Indonesia, and Mombasa, Kenya, as evidence of Al Qaeda's wide reach
and the existence of a coalition of extremist groups in Southeast
Asia and East Africa. Those attacks also demonstrated a shift in the
group's tactics, the report says.</LD>
<TE>   "Soft targets, preferably with maximum casualties, would now
appear to be the order of the day," it says.</TE>
<TE>   The 40-page report surveys the status of the international war on
terrorism. Though it credits the United States and other governments
with making important strides in breaking up Al Qaeda cells and
freezing the group's financial assets, it says those governments have
been unable to prevent the organization and other extremist groups
from raising enough funds -- through religious charities and informal
money-changing operations known as hawalas -- to "support major
operations."</TE>
<TE>   Chandler said his panel had turned up no evidence that Iraq had
supplied Al Qaeda with biological, chemical or nuclear weapons. But
he raised concern that the network may be able to obtain such weapons
elsewhere, noting recent seizures of black-market raw uranium in
Tanzania.</TE>

<HD>China Will Welcome 3 Human Rights Monitors, U.S. Envoy Says</HD>
<DH>According to Assistant Secretary of State Craner, U.N.
officials will be able to probe reported abuses without interference
by Beijing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anthony Kuhn</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>The Chinese government will invite three U.N. human rights officials
to China to conduct unrestricted investigations, a senior U.S.
diplomat said Tuesday, in a policy reversal long sought by rights
groups.</LD>
<LD>   After two days of talks here, Assistant Secretary of State Lorne
Craner cited the invitations as evidence of expanded cooperation by
China on human rights issues. Beijing had not publicly confirmed the
invitations.</LD>
<LD>   According to Craner, China said it would welcome Theo van Boven,
the U.N. special envoy on torture, who has been invited before but
without the promise of unmonitored interviews with prisoners. China
will also issue invitations on unconditional terms to the U.N. envoys
on religion and arbitrary detention, Craner said.</LD>
<TE>   "We understand the terms they want when they come here," he said
of the U.N. officials. "That's what they will get."</TE>
<TE>   Beijing routinely rejects allegations of human rights abuses such
as torture but has engaged in dialogue on the issue with the U.S. and
European Union since the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   With economic interdependence and cooperation in the war on
terrorism bonding Beijing and Washington in an uneasy partnership,
the exchange of official delegations appears to be accelerating, and
human rights diplomacy is becoming increasingly routine.</TE>
<TE>   "It's meetings and trips," Craner said of the progress. "I can't
see too much that has substantially changed. But three years from
now, we may look back and see that this was the time when the ice
started to break."</TE>
<TE>   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said this week's
human rights talks were "in-depth and extensive, narrowed the
differences between the sides and enhanced understanding."</TE>
<TE>   International human rights groups have dismissed the U.S.-China
rights dialogue as ineffectual and have urged Craner to press for the
release of imprisoned religious leaders and dissidents.</TE>
<TE>   Craner also met with officials from the Justice Ministry and the
Religious Affairs Bureau to discuss legal reforms and religious
freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Craner's delegation was scheduled to visit the western
region of Xinjiang, where China claims to be helping the
U.S.-declared war on terrorism by cracking down on minority Muslim
separatists. In August, Washington put the East Turkestan Islamic
Movement, which Beijing has proscribed, on its list of terrorist
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Craner is expected to remind his hosts that Washington's move did
not constitute carte blanche to persecute Chinese Muslims for
legitimate grievances against Beijing's rule.</TE>
<TE>   Craner also met with Vice Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing and top
human rights diplomat Li Baodong, both of whom are widely credited
with engineering the release of political prisoners whose cases were
raised by Washington.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. diplomats now work from two lists of "cases of concern," one
for Chinese prisoners of conscience and one for U.S. citizens
imprisoned in China. This year, Chinese authorities have released
three Tibetan prisoners -- a teacher, a nun and an ethnomusicologist
-- as well as Los Angeles-area businessman David Chow, all of whom
were on the lists.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese officials have also begun to cultivate relations with
Washington's special coordinator for Tibet, Paula J. Dobriansky.
Whereas Beijing refused to speak with her predecessors, they have
welcomed her three times to China in recent years, all in her other
official capacity as undersecretary of State for global affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Dobriansky works closely with the Dalai Lama's envoy to
Washington, Lodi Gyari, who traveled to Beijing this year in the
first visit in two decades by an official representative of the
exiled spiritual leader of Tibet and Nobel Peace Prize winner.</TE>

<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Waving banners, banging pots and chanting slogans demanding the
ouster of President Hugo Chavez, several thousand marchers took to
the streets here Tuesday, the 16th day of an opposition strike that
has crippled Venezuela's oil industry.</LD>
<LD>   The strike has reduced Venezuela's output of more than 2 million
barrels a day to less than 400,000 barrels a day, sending crude
prices above $30 a barrel, state officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   One of the world's largest oil refineries halted production
because of the strike. Curacao's Refineria Isla was running out of
storage capacity because tankers have been idled by the work
stoppage, said Norbert Chaclin, a refinery manager.</LD>
<TE>   The refinery, operated by Venezuela's state oil company, usually
produces gasoline, lubricants, jet fuel, propane and other products
for the U.S. and the Caribbean, he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Working to Convince World Iraq Is Out of Line</HD>
<DH>Strategy involves building unity and focusing searches to
prove Baghdad's guilt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright and Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's top foreign policy team huddled Tuesday
over a three-pronged strategy it is prepared to launch once U.N.
inspectors reveal their assessment Thursday of Iraq's weapons
declaration, administration officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The strategy will focus on a strong campaign to convince the U.S.
public and the world that Iraq has not yet come clean on having a
deadly arsenal, quiet diplomacy to build unity on action at the U.N.
Security Council and behind-the-scenes planning for a toughened round
of inspections to prove the U.S. argument, the sources said.</LD>
<LD>   With its own tentative conclusion on the voluminous weapons
declaration in hand, "we start getting together our list of most
likely cases and candidates to catch Iraq in flagrante delicto," said
a well-placed U.S. official who requested anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   The United States does not want to be seen as trying to preempt
Thursday's report by chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix, so it
will not air a fuller assessment until later in the week or over the
weekend, U.S. officials say. Washington also does not want to be seen
as taking the lead or dictating to the United Nations at this
critical juncture.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to get too detailed on Thursday. We're not going
to be talking so much about mustard gas and [nerve agent] VX as the
fact that there were omissions in the declaration. It wasn't detailed
enough. It didn't give any proof as to what was destroyed," a U.S.
official said.</TE>
<TE>   And when the United States does offer its assessment, it won't be
the final word from the administration.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't bill this as a definitive or instant grand jury indictment
on Thursday. We will base our final conclusions down the road on the
Blix assessment as well as on further analysis, discussions with
supplier countries [that sold Iraq items used for weapons systems],
other permanent members of the Security Council and other things," a
senior State Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   Britain also indicated Tuesday that Prime Minister Tony Blair
wouldn't give a full reaction until after Christmas, a government
spokesman said. Foreign Minister Jack Straw, however, has already
made it clear that London takes a skeptical view of Baghdad's
declaration.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the U.S. and Britain are in general agreement that Iraq's
11,807-page declaration is deeply flawed, Washington expects
different reactions from the other three permanent Security Council
members -- France, Russia and China -- according to U.S. officials
and U.N. envoys.</TE>
<TE>   All five, however, will agree that this is not the moment to go to
war, the sources predicted.</TE>
<TE>   "Expect to see varying degrees of reaction -- some will say
partial breach, others will say complete," said an envoy from a
Security Council country. "The only point of full agreement is that
this is not the trigger for military action."</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell -- who mapped strategy Tuesday
with Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and CIA Director
George J. Tenet -- is already in the thick of diplomatic
coordination, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Powell talked Tuesday with Blix as well as his French and European
Union counterparts and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, according
to a State Department spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is priming the rest of the council for the
"strong views" it will air this week, U.N. diplomats say. They expect
the administration to say that the declaration is full of false
statements and omissions and that there's no hope of redemption.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first nail in the coffin," said a Security Council
diplomat who has been briefed on U.S. strategy. "The second nail
should come in January."</TE>
<TE>   France and Russia negotiated hard to ensure that U.N. Resolution
1441 -- which set up a new round of weapons inspections in Iraq --
said that omissions alone in the declaration would not constitute a
material breach that could trigger a U.S.-led attack on Iraq. Only
Iraq's failure to fully account for its arms, combined with a failure
to comply with the resolution, could be considered a trigger for war.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, French diplomats made it clear Tuesday that they
intended to hold the United States to both the letter and the spirit
of the resolution -- and that they were not yet convinced Iraq still
has weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is closely coordinating its efforts with Blix
and the United Nations. John Wolf, assistant secretary of State for
nonproliferation, was in New York on Tuesday for the second time in a
week to meet with Blix and U.N. weapons analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf and John D. Negroponte, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., gave
Blix a preliminary assessment of what Washington sees as serious
omissions and discrepancies in the declaration along with
recommendations for next steps by the inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said this week that as the inspections progress,
they will begin to provide more specific intelligence, such as
recommended "hot spots" for the inspectors to visit and the names of
scientists and engineers involved in developing Iraq's weapons system
for interviewing.</TE>

<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>This is the core of a paralyzing national strike, this dirty little
intersection just off the highway that runs through the heart of the
capital.</LD>
<LD>   Above it rises the headquarters of the world's second-largest
state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, known by its initials,
PDVSA. The building towers over surrounding shops, its green and gray
walls muted by a patina of grime from car exhaust.</LD>
<LD>   On a typical day, about 2,000 workers arrive to dispatch petroleum
orders, approve new contracts and meet in polished boardrooms. But
now, two weeks into a strike designed to force President Hugo Chavez
from office, about 500 workers a day check in.</LD>
<TE>   Refugees from this and other PDVSA offices throughout the capital,
they gather in a frantic effort to keep alive the nation's behemoth
oil industry, source of more than 10% of U.S. oil imports. Human
resources executives help dispatch oil tankers, accountants patch
together complex communications networks, middle managers make
photocopies.</TE>
<TE>   It is a desperate, urgent struggle for those who believe in Chavez
and his plans for a social revolution to improve the lives of
Venezuela's impoverished millions. PDVSA is the heart of the nation's
economy, accounting for one-third of gross domestic product. If the
company fails, so does Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   "I am defending democracy," Enny Pulgar, 48, told reporters. The
mid-level accounting executive suddenly found herself last week
writing international shipping manifests for oil tankers.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the picket lines, the fight is no less vital.
As many as 90% of the company's 46,000 employees have joined the
strike, causing oil production to fall by 70%. Most are middle or
upper class, and many were educated in the United States. They are
true believers in open markets, corporate ladders and trickle-down
economics.</TE>
<TE>   For them, PDVSA is not some bloated state agency but more like a
private corporation. They see in Chavez the ruin of their beloved
company, an attempt to funnel Venezuela's oil wealth into
ill-conceived social welfare programs for his poor followers.</TE>
<TE>   These are not wild revolutionaries. They are people who believe
that they have fought their way to the top, who won their position by
hard work and skill. By striking, they are risking everything they
have worked for: careers, homes, pensions, even personal safety.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, they gathered by the thousands in a hotel ballroom, in
golf shirts and Donna Karan blouses, to chant like the most fervent
university demonstrators against Chavez's rule: "Out! Out! Out!" they
screamed.</TE>
<TE>   The strike seeks new elections to permanently oust Chavez, who was
restored to power after a brief coup in April.</TE>
<TE>   "We are fighting for the principles of liberty and democracy,"
said Edgar Paredes, who after striking was fired from his job as the
president of Pequiven, a petrochemical company that is one of PDVSA's
biggest subsidiaries. "That's worth more than a career."</TE>
<TE>   As the protest grinds on, crippling oil production, cutting food
supplies and making the lives of millions difficult, the battle for
PDVSA has become the battle for Venezuela's soul: Will the company,
and the nation, focus on profits or poverty?</TE>
<TE>   "PDVSA will serve the interests of Venezuela, and not the elite,"
Chavez said Sunday in his weekly presidential address.</TE>
<TE>   Pride of Venezuela</TE>
<TE>   PDVSA is far more than an oil company. It is the pride of
Venezuela, a symbol for those who believe that the country can have a
booming economy and a vibrant middle class.</TE>
<TE>   The company came into being in 1975, after President Carlos Andres
Perez nationalized the industry, paying about $1 billion for all the
foreign-owned oil licenses and assets in the country. With reserves
of 77.9 billion barrels of oil, Venezuela is the fifth-largest oil
supplier in the world, producing about 2.7 million barrels a day
until recently. Only Saudi Aramco is a larger state-run oil company.</TE>
<TE>   The conversion brought those workers from businesses such as Shell
into a state enterprise. From the start, the idea was to separate the
company from politics and the messy business of running a country.</TE>
<TE>   Although owned by Venezuela, PDVSA would be run like a private
corporation.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in a competitive world. What that means is that we have
to be efficient," said Juan Fernandez, 47, the company's planning
manager, who also was fired recently after emerging as the leader of
striking workers.</TE>
<TE>   The heart of the corporate culture is the idea of meritocracy.
There are annual performance evaluations that determine promotions,
and evaluations of "potential" every three years that determine how
far one rises. Many who work in these grimy offices came from humble
backgrounds, their parents immigrants or field workers, and moved up
in the ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, PDVSA employees came to see themselves as the best
and the brightest, creators of a First World company in a Third World
nation.</TE>
<TE>   They believed that they could best help the country by being the
most profitable company possible. With sales of $46.2 billion last
year, PDVSA sent about $9 billion to the treasury, about half the
government's budget.</TE>
<TE>   "The company best helps the country by opening markets and
providing opportunity to Venezuelans," Paredes said. "This is what
Chavez doesn't understand."</TE>
<TE>   Middle and upper management workers earned far more than most
Venezuelans, though salaries are low compared with multinational oil
companies. Today, young executives bring in $30,000 to $45,000 a
year. Top executives reportedly make as much as $250,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Many members of top management drive SUVs, live in comfortable
duplexes and can afford to vacation in Miami. They send their
children to private schools, have sculptures and paintings in their
living rooms and dine in hushed restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   The apartness of PDVSA is inescapable. Top managers say the rest
of Venezuela should be more like the company. It is a small, tight
club where you join, you work, you rise and you retire with a pension
plan that you long ago converted into dollars to avoid the deflation
that eats away at other workers' retirement checks.</TE>
<TE>   "We all share this idea: We want to get hired by PDVSA, we want to
work in PDVSA and we want to retire from PDVSA," said Horacio Medina,
49, a top executive fired last week. "This is my life."</TE>
<TE>   That sense of separateness has changed since Chavez took office,
workers say. Now, employees have created a nonprofit group
independent of the company to help the poor someday.</TE>
<TE>   But there is also a sense that the company has done no wrong.
PDVSA made money. It was the government's job to spend it.
Venezuela's widespread poverty is a failure of politics, not
commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't blame PDVSA. Blame the politicians," said Ramon Espinasa, a
consultant with the Inter-American Development Bank and former chief
economist for the firm. "This is a company that has to be as
profitable and well managed as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez Brings His Ideas</TE>
<TE>   Chavez attacked that corporate philosophy from the moment he ran
for office in 1998, calling the company a "state within a state" that
had to be brought into service for the "Bolivarian revolution," an
odd mix of leftist ideas to improve the lives of the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Once in office, he cut a deal with Cuban President Fidel Castro, a
friend, to supply about 53,000 barrels of oil a day at cut-rate
prices to the communist government. He issued a new decree requiring
that future oil projects have 51% state ownership and doubling
royalties paid to the government. He ordered the country to strictly
adhere to OPEC oil production levels, overturning plans to more than
double production to 6 million barrels a day.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez and his supporters are unapologetic about their vision for
PDVSA. As a state company, it's a state tool. The idea that it is a
business, driven only by profit, is wrong, they say.</TE>
<TE>   They are seeking an oil company that is more an arm of the state,
a partner in a quest to pave roads, electrify towns, build sewers and
support Chavez's generally left-leaning policies.</TE>
<TE>   "The state has the right to create a policy of social
development," said Angel Rodriguez, a Chavez ally in the National
Assembly. PDVSA "is fundamental to supporting it."</TE>
<TE>   The crisis between the white-collar PDVSA employees and the
nation's leader came to a head in February, when Chavez installed
five of seven directors and named Gaston Parra, a left-leaning
university professor with no experience in the industry, as corporate
president.</TE>
<TE>   The workers, led by Fernandez, began work slowdowns and stoppages.
Chavez fired Fernandez, Paredes and five other workers, appearing on
television to declare: "Juan Fernandez. Thanks a lot. Now get out!"</TE>
<TE>   Outraged, the oil workers joined a nationwide strike in April. A
protest march erupted in violence that led to the coup. Chavez was
returned to power 48 hours later by loyal troops.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez tried to make amends, rehiring the fired workers and
appointing a new president acceptable to both sides: Ali Rodriguez, a
former leftist guerrilla who had risen to become the president of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. He is backing
Chavez in the current strike.</TE>
<TE>   But further attempts at understanding failed. Chavez opponents
began seeking to hold a referendum on his rule in February 2003, a
move he refused to recognize, saying the constitution allows a vote
no sooner than next August.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez and the opposition clashed repeatedly, with oil workers
watching worriedly from the sidelines. But during the current strike,
which began Dec. 2, national guard troops attacked demonstrators
gathering at a PDVSA office building -- prompting many PDVSA
employees to join the protest.</TE>
<TE>   Their participation saved the strike, which had been fading. They
in effect shut down the industry. But Chavez and his supporters
fought back ferociously, loading at least one tanker with oil and
taking over tanker trucks to ensure continued, if haphazard, delivery
to gas stations.</TE>
<TE>   It is still not clear whether Chavez will succeed. His supporters
among PDVSA workers interviewed at the headquarters described a
chaotic situation where a skeleton crew was struggling to make the
system function.</TE>
<TE>   But the workers said they will do anything necessary to keep the
company afloat. Showing much of the same determination as their
peers, they work 16-hour days, seven days a week.</TE>
<TE>   Said Pulgar, the accounting executive: "We are not going to let
them beat us."</TE>

<HD>Contaminated Water Energizes Opponents of Ahmanson Ranch</HD>
<DH>Ventura County board told that chemical found in well could
be serious risk to future residents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Opponents of the proposed Ahmanson Ranch development continued
Tuesday to seize on evidence of contaminated ground water near the
property as reason for the Ventura County Board of Supervisors to
delay ground breaking.</LD>
<LD>   In the second day of hearings on a new environmental study of the
project, experts hired by its critics focused on perchlorate, a
component of rocket fuel that can cause thyroid problems in humans.</LD>
<LD>   The toxin was discovered recently in a well on Ahmanson Ranch
property that the developer plans to use to irrigate golf courses.
Experts disagree on where the chemical came from, but many point to
Rocketdyne's nearby Santa Susana Field Laboratory. Rocketdyne
scientists have said the lab could not be the source of perchlorate
found in nearby wells.</LD>
<TE>   Ahmanson Ranch's opponents warned supervisors Tuesday that the
fast-migrating perchlorate could be the harbinger of further
contamination, exposing Ventura County to lawsuits if the
development's future residents get sick.</TE>
<TE>   "Perchlorate is serious stuff. It is dangerous stuff, particularly
to our children," said Carol Browner, who was head of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   The state Assembly's Natural Resources Committee will conduct
local hearings on perchlorate and its effects, Chairwoman Hannah-Beth
Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) announced this week. And state Sen. Sheila
Kuehl (D-Santa Monica) has asked the Regional Water Quality Control
Board to order Ahmanson Ranch's developers to investigate the
contamination further. The board's chairwoman had already expressed
her concern.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing more testimony today, the supervisors could vote
today on whether to accept the supplemental study of the Ahmanson
development as adequate. In particular, they are considering whether
the plan protects endangered frogs and plants discovered on the
property in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Calabasas criticized the study Tuesday for not
containing an up-to-date measure of the traffic the 8,700-person
community would bring to the neighboring city and region.</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas and the development's other opponents have filed a
series of lawsuits to stall the project and would like supervisors to
delay their vote to allow more study of perchlorate.</TE>
<TE>   "We need [access to] wells, we need data and we need time,"
hydrogeologist Ian Goltz said.</TE>
<TE>   The developer, Washington Mutual Bank, has promised it will
cleanse any contaminated wells so that the water exceeds state
standards. And the developer will continue to test the water as it
proceeds with construction. If perchlorate lingers, those wells would
be capped, Washington Mutual says.</TE>

<HD>Coad Wraps Up Board Career</HD>
<DH>Supervisor is sad to leave but proud of her service. She
takes parting shots at foes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Seema Mehta</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad marked
her last public meeting Tuesday, bidding farewell to colleagues and
offering a musical salute to her husband and close aide, Tom.</LD>
<LD>   Coad, 69, said she was sad to be leaving but was proud of her four
years on the board.</LD>
<LD>   "The separation is painful," she said. "But I leave with my
integrity intact, my ethics uncompromised and my dignity
undiminished."</LD>
<TE>   Coad, a former community college trustee and self-help book
author, took her seat on the board in January 1999. She emerged as a
strong backer of plans to build an airport at the closed El Toro
Marine Corps base.</TE>
<TE>   But voters in March decided that a park, not an airport, should be
built at El Toro. In that same election, Coad lost her reelection bid
in a bitter race against Fullerton Councilman Chris Norby, who
opposed the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Coad's colleagues Tuesday praised her work on behalf of children,
drug-addicted mothers and foster kids, and her representation of the
sometimes-forgotten unincorporated areas. Supervisor Chuck Smith said
Coad was one of the hardest-working supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Coad said she was an "ordinary grandmother" who wanted to give
something to her community. "I demonstrated that a strong,
family-oriented woman can still mean business," she said.</TE>
<TE>   To the strains of Tammy Wynette's "Stand by Your Man," Coad
thanked her husband, who served as her unpaid advisor. "Tom, I want
to publicly thank you for all of your hard work," she said. "I love
you more than ever, and we are a team."</TE>
<TE>   Coad also took a few last jabs, criticizing the "Machiavellian
methods" Norby used to defeat her in the March election and the
"theatrical prosecutorial rhetoric" of newly sworn-in Assemblyman
Todd Spitzer, whose early resignation from the board cost Coad's
husband an opportunity to run for the vacant seat.</TE>
<TE>   She told her colleagues that there would be many challenges ahead
of them but that they would be resolved if they acted with
"constructive criticism, an open dialogue and unselfish desires."</TE>

<HD>Hospital to Double in Size by 2012</HD>
<DH>Community Memorial says $121-million expansion and retrofit
won't rekindle old tensions with Ventura County Medical Center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Community Memorial Hospital on Tuesday announced a $121-million
expansion and earthquake retrofit that officials say will not
rekindle a bitter war that flared for a decade with the neighboring
county hospital in midtown Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   The expansion includes construction of a seven-story wing that
will double the hospital's square footage and increase the number of
beds from 242 to 260 when completed in 2012, Executive Director
Michael Bakst said.</LD>
<LD>   Although not part of this proposal, Bakst said hospital officials
are considering a hotel and restaurant on the same site to serve
out-of-town patients and their families.</LD>
<TE>   But the ambitious plans are not an attempt to lure away patients
from county-run Ventura County Medical Center, with whom the private
hospital had a protracted battle before calling a truce last year, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We seem to have worked out our differences," Bakst said. "We
agreed to work together with each other and work together with our
respective constituencies. If there are certain services they don't
have, we try to help them out and provide them."</TE>
<TE>   Fearing competition from the 223-bed public hospital just two
blocks away, Community Memorial bankrolled a $1.6-million ballot
initiative in 1996 that killed the county's plan to add a hospital
wing and to upgrade its aging buildings on Loma Vista Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   After the two sides called a truce, the county agreed not to
recruit patients with private insurance to join in its low-cost
health-care plan, and Community Memorial pledged not to stand in the
way of upgrades to the medical center.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the hospitals even talked about merging, but the
idea fizzled.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor John K. Flynn said he does not believe Community
Memorial's plans will tip the delicate balance, even as the county
grapples with funding cuts that make private patients ever more
valuable.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals are generally reimbursed at lower rates for services to
patients in public health programs than those covered by private
medical insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "I never look at us as being in competition," Flynn said. "I know
Community Memorial has been concerned about that. Our basic role has
been to provide health care for those who cannot or do not have the
money for health care. There will always be a role for public health
care."</TE>
<TE>   He said he believes west county residents will continue to choose
Ventura County Medical Center over Community Memorial because of its
"superior service."</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're doing a great job. I think Community Memorial's
doing a great job," Flynn said. "There's room for a public system and
private. There's nothing wrong with competition. It just helps
provide a superior service."</TE>
<TE>   Bakst said hospital officials decided to embark on the
multimillion-dollar project because the state is requiring all
general hospitals to retrofit or rebuild to meet new seismic
standards by 2008.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital next year will begin a $21-million first phase set
for completion by 2006. That will extend the retrofit deadline for
the entire project by five years to 2013.</TE>
<TE>   The first phase will add about 80,000 square feet to the existing
building, including a women and children's pavilion, a new parking
structure across the street and expansion of the emergency room and

seven-story wing that will connect to the main eight-story structure.</TE>

<LD>The Orange County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday took the first step
toward establishing a military history museum in an 18-story blimp
hangar at the former Tustin Marine Corps Air Station by voting to
turn over two buildings adjacent to it for use as an interim site.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of veterans packed the hearing to support the idea.</LD>
<LD>   A feasibility study estimates the museum would cost $262 million
to build and more than $6 million a year to operate.</LD>

<HD>Emotional Abuse a Tough Sell to Jurors</HD>
<DH>After the Machnick ruling, child advocates say society
needs to recognize that cruelty can take forms other than physical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Martelle and H.G. Reza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was no dispute over the details.</LD>
<LD>   Grady Machnick and his wife, Deborah, forced their teenage son to
sleep outdoors because he had stolen from them and they didn't trust
him in their Yorba Linda home. On other occasions they kept him in
the backyard until he finished his homework, and she once sent him to
school with dog feces in his backpack.</LD>
<LD>   But a jury's reluctance this week to call those acts abuse
highlights what child advocates see as a stubborn problem: getting
society to recognize that emotional abuse of children can be as much
a crime as physical abuse.</LD>
<TE>   "We speculate that is due in part to the fact that the lines are
not clear," said Sheila Anderson, executive director of the
Sacramento-based Child Abuse Council, which operates in 32 California
counties. "Concussions are clear and diagnosable. Emotional abuse may
not be."</TE>
<TE>   An Orange County jury voted Monday to acquit Grady Machnick, a Los
Angeles County sheriff's sergeant, and Deborah, a former elementary
school principal, on charges that they conspired to abuse the
Machnicks' son beginning when he was 12 until he ran away from home
at age 14. He's now 16 and living with a foster family.</TE>
<TE>   The couple denied abusing the boy, arguing that they were
desperately trying to corral his unruly behavior, including
shoplifting and stealing cash from Deborah Machnick's purse. The dog
feces episode followed a showdown in which the boy suggested his
parents leave the feces in his bedroom if he failed again to do his
chore of cleaning up the yard.</TE>
<TE>   The jury -- most of them parents themselves -- deadlocked on
charges over whether the Machnicks' parenting techniques constituted
misdemeanor child abuse, illustrating the fuzzy line between bad
parenting and criminal behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Key to the rulings, jurors said, was their reluctance to pass
judgment on how other parents raise their children. Prosecutors are
due back in court Jan. 3 to announce whether they will try the
Machnicks again on the misdemeanor child abuse charges.</TE>
<TE>   Social workers and child advocates said the verdict did not
surprise them. Rather, they said, it offers a snapshot of broad
social attitudes toward emotional abuse of a child, and the
difficulty in deciding when stern discipline becomes cruelty -- and
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is muddied by individual uncertainties over what makes a
good parent -- and fear that "there but for the grace of God go I."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said her organization has found unease among adults in
focus groups when they are presented with samples of discipline that
advocates say cross over into abuse. "They become concerned and start
to compare themselves," Anderson said. "They think, 'I remember the
time Johnny forgot his coat and I said it served him right and didn't
drive to school to give it to him. Is that child abuse?' It increases
their discomfort."</TE>
<TE>   Adults also tend to view abuse differently depending on the age of
the child. Young children are sympathetic figures, even though they
are unreliable witnesses about things they have experienced.</TE>
<TE>   Teens, though, can elicit fear from adults, who tend to be less
likely to look at harsh discipline as abuse.</TE>
<TE>   One social worker said she was less surprised by the verdict than
by the fact that the charges were filed in the first place, given how
hard it is to prove emotional abuse compared with physical abuse,
where the wounds are visible.</TE>
<TE>   "The value from this is that it's opened up a lot of dialogue
about the difficulty of parenting teens," said Linda Howard, director
of youth and community programs at the Santa Ana-based Community
Service Programs. "It was a tough case to weigh. Was this an attempt
to discipline, or was it emotional abuse? If anything, it got people
to think about their own actions when disciplining teenagers."</TE>
<TE>   She does not think that the verdict will dissuade social workers
from reporting emotional abuse of children.</TE>
<TE>   "You always make your best judgment. The outcome is in somebody
else's hands," said Howard, who has been a social worker for 30
years. "If your job is to protect children from abuse, a verdict like
this shouldn't stop you from doing what's right."</TE>
<TE>   For some advocates, the verdict evidenced a general lack of
awareness of what constitutes emotional abuse of a child, and of the
consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "A child who is emotionally abused believes that he or she is not
a good person, is constantly a failure, and so [that] sets the child
up to fail," said Barbara Oliver, director of Prevent Child
Abuse-Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Often, she said, emotionally abused children turn to drugs or
other criminal behavior "to get the nurturing and love" missing from
their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe most people understand yet the consequences of
emotional abuse," Oliver said. "If they did understand, the verdicts
in cases like this can be different."</TE>

<LD>President Bush helped read a Christmas classic to third-graders in a
lighthearted ceremony disrupted by a "near riot" of schoolchildren
frightened by his black Scottish terrier.</LD>
<LD>   Bush exchanged jokes with the nearly 60 children gathered in the
Roosevelt Room as First Lady Laura Bush read from "The Night Before
Christmas."</LD>
<LD>   Many of the children were startled when the dog, Barney, entered.
"He's pretty ferocious-looking when you first look at him," Bush
said, saying the surprise "created a near riot."</LD>

<HD>GOP Likens Byrd's Comment to Lott's</HD>
<DH>Republicans urge censure of Democratic colleague for his
use of an epithet last year. Liberals say there is no valid
comparison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Johanna Neuman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The 83-year-old senator, asked about the state of race relations in
America, offered his opinion: "They are much, much better than
they've ever been in my lifetime," he said, despite the presence of a
few "white niggers."</LD>
<LD>   The venue was the television show "Fox News Sunday." The date was
March 2001. And the speaker was the senior Democrat in the Senate,
the white-haired, Socrates-quoting Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West
Virginia.</LD>
<LD>   Alerted to the eye-popping phrase by a Fox producer, Byrd issued
an apology even before the taped interview was aired. A few
newspapers condemned his use of the ugly epithet, and the incident
passed from the headlines.</LD>
<TE>   Now some Republicans, roiled by 10 days of national angst over
Sen. Trent Lott's comments that the nation would have been better off
if Strom Thurmond's 1948 segregationist presidential campaign had
prevailed, are digging up transcripts of the Byrd interview.</TE>
<TE>   With Lott's fate as incoming majority leader -- and even as a
senator -- hanging in the balance, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is
talking about censuring Byrd. In a town where moral equivalency is
always a danger, the national conversation about race seems to be
provoking an almost biblical instinct to extract an eye for an eye.</TE>
<TE>   To conservatives like William J. Bennett, author of "The
Children's Book of Virtues," the treatment accorded these two men of
the South -- Lott, the son of a sharecropper, Byrd, a former member
of the Ku Klux Klan -- speaks volumes about the double standard that
a liberal media accord Democrats and Republicans. "We have standards
and they don't," said Bennett, who has called for Lott to step down.
"We say we are sorry and wonder if people should step down. That's
why the American people respect our values."</TE>
<TE>   To liberals like Roger Wilkins, author of "Jefferson's Pillow: A
Black Patriot Confronts the Myths of the Founding Fathers," the two
statements are not even on the same page. "Byrd is just an eccentric
old guy who insists on hanging around and has no real power," said
Wilkins, adding that he would not want to befriend Byrd. "Even though
he used the phrase 'white niggers,' he spoke approvingly of racial
progress."</TE>
<TE>   So heated has the racial rhetoric become that partisans are using
the Lott controversy to settle old scores.</TE>
<TE>   Rush Limbaugh, the popular firebrand talk show host, has taken to
the airwaves in recent days to rail that Lott's comments, which he
finds "indefensible," are being used to "tarnish all Republicans and
all the people in the South as racist, hick good ol' Duke boys,
singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' and drinking ... with their friends in
low places."</TE>
<TE>   And he likens the Lott frenzy to the furor that greeted Supreme
Court Justice Clarence Thomas during his Senate confirmation hearings
when he denied former staffer Anita Hill's charges of sexual
harassment. "We're back to the same argument," Limbaugh said. "It's
not the evidence but the seriousness of the charge. Whether there was
sexual harassment or not, the charge has been made."</TE>
<TE>   To liberals, Byrd's use of a racial epithet provoked a controversy
over a word that inflames great passions, they argue, while Lott's
unleashed a debate about segregation. "There's no moral equivalency,"
said David Bositis of the Joint Center for Political and Economic
Studies, a research organization on black issues. "It's the
difference between using a racial epithet when referring to himself
and expressing a repugnant sentiment about desegregation against the
country's norms."</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense, counters Bennett, who calls the word a vulgarity and
argues that Democrats don't care about standards "unless someone is
about to be indicted and go to jail." He mentioned former President
Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   For the last two weeks, as Lott has apologized repeatedly, Byrd
has remained silent, and declined an interview request Tuesday. In
his apology in 2001, Byrd said the phrase he used on television,
which he didn't define, "dates back to my boyhood and has no place in
today's society."</TE>
<TE>   And Senate Democratic staffers point out that the greatest
distinction between the two remarks is in the contrition that Byrd
long ago expressed, and the voting record his conversion made
possible.</TE>
<TE>   As a young man, Byrd joined the Ku Klux Klan, which had for
decades plagued black America with white-hooded vigilante violence.
As a senator nearing 83, he said in a speech to the West Virginia
NAACP that education offers the only cure to prejudice. "We cannot
lift ourselves out of particular biases, we cannot loose our bonds of
rigid and wrong thinking without letting the light of knowledge cut
the darkness," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In his more than 40 years in the Senate, Byrd has supported many
of the bills that Lott is now apologizing for opposing. Byrd voted to
extend the Voting Rights Act, to create a national holiday on Martin
Luther King Jr.'s birthday, for the Fair Housing Act. In the current
Congress, supporters note, Byrd scored a 79% rating from the NAACP,
while Lott earned 12%.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Lott says he wants to made amends for some of his votes.
"Forgive my mistake and see if I can make a difference," he said in a
nationally aired interview on the Black Entertainment Television
network Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   To McConnell, that apology should be enough, and he is making
vague threats that other senators aside from Byrd might be vulnerable
to a counterattack if the pressure on Lott continues. "There are
other members of the Senate who have engaged in similar kinds of
statements, [made] big mistakes in recent years and have apologized,"
he said Sunday on ABC's "This Week with George Stephanopoulos."
"Interestingly enough, the apologies have been accepted and they've
moved on."</TE>
<TE>   The specter of either Lott or Byrd being censured by their
colleagues is politically shocking. They would be asked to stand in
the well of the Senate, to hear a resolution of opprobrium from their
colleagues. Byrd once told a colleague that the Senate was more
important to him than his own life. Lott has no great wealth, no
fallback ambition, having come to Washington as a 27-year-old
assistant for a Mississippi congressman before his own elections to
Congress and the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be like the rebuke of [red-baiting] Joseph McCarthy,"
said Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University. "Then
you would really be marginalized."</TE>
<TE>   Whether Lott's colleagues would actually vote censure over what
most privately agree was his inept attempt to flatter a 100-year-old
man at his birthday party is hard to predict, especially given strong
signals from the White House and other Republican quarters who do not
want their party linked to comments viewed as racist.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkins, for one, has little sympathy for their plight, noting
that the GOP has long been accused of using codes to convey affinity
for segregationists. "As a black person who has been profoundly
offended by the code-word racist politics, I would love for them to
keep Lott," he said.</TE>
<TE>   However it comes out, the suspicion remains that controversy is
bringing out the partisan stripe in everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "It just seems like tit for tat," said George Curry, editor of a
news service offered by the black National Newspaper Publishers Assn.
"If the Republicans really objected [to Byrd's comments], they should
have said something at the time. Then it would be fair game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Their Own Words:</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans are charging that comments by Sen. Robert C. Byrd
(D-W. Va.) in a televised interview last year were as racially
inflammatory as recent remarks by Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.).</TE>
<TE>   Byrd, when asked about the state of race relations in the United
States:</TE>
<TE>   "They are much, much better than they've been in my lifetime....
This is my personal opinion. I think we talk about race too much. I
think those problems are largely behind us.... My old mom told me,
'Robert, you can't go to heaven if you hate anybody.' We practice
that. There are white niggers. I've seen a lot of white niggers in my
time, if you want to use that word. We just need to work together to
make our country a better country, and I'd just as soon quit talking
about it so much."</TE>
<TE>   Lott, speaking at a celebration of Sen. Strom Thurmond's 100th
birthday:</TE>
<TE>   "I want to say this about my state: When Strom Thurmond ran for
president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of
the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these
problems over all these years, either."</TE>

<HD>Most Want No Change in Their Dollars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Nearly two-thirds of Americans oppose replacing the dollar bill with
a coin, but many change their minds when told the switch could save
taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, a poll commissioned by
Congress finds.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a three-year, $67.1-million marketing campaign by the U.S.
Mint, people remain attached to their greenbacks and show little
interest in filling their pockets with golden dollar coins, the
General Accounting Office said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Although 70% of Americans have heard of the new coins, only 5%
have plunked one down at a cash register and fewer than 2% have used
them to operate vending machines, toll booths or for mass transit,
according to the GAO-sponsored Gallup survey on how people feel about
U.S. coins.</LD>
<TE>   It is the second time in recent decades a dollar coin has failed
to catch on; the silvery Susan B. Anthony coin was minted in 1979-81,
re-released around the turn of the century, and has largely
disappeared. Because the Anthony dollar was often mistaken for a
quarter, Congress in 1997 required the new dollar coin to be golden
in color.</TE>
<TE>   Issued in 2000, the new coin bears a rendering of Sacagawea, a
Shoshone interpreter who helped guide the 1804-06 Lewis and Clark
expedition to the Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The Mint is researching how to get more people to use the 300
million golden coins in circulation, spokesman Michael White said.
The agency plans to produce 6 million to 7 million dollar coins next
year for collectors, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, has estimated that
eliminating the dollar bill and switching to dollar coins would save
about $500 million a year because coins last longer than paper notes
and cost less to distribute. More than half those surveyed said they
would favor scrapping the dollar bill to get the savings.</TE>
<TE>   The act that directed the government to start a marketing program
for the new coin, however, also required that the paper dollar stay
in circulation.</TE>
<TE>   The Gallup telephone survey of 1,003 adults was conducted in July
and August and has an error margin of 3 percentage points.</TE>

<HD>Events Mark Anniversary of Wrights' First Flight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Beneath the Wright brothers' frail aircraft that altered history, a
yearlong series of centennial events began in the Smithsonian on
Tuesday, the 99th anniversary of man's first powered flight. In North
Carolina, 99 military aircraft roared in tribute over the dunes where
the Wright Flyer sputtered aloft.</LD>
<LD>   The day's third activity to inaugurate the centennial year was in
Dayton, Ohio, where Orville and Wilbur Wright owned a bicycle shop. A
$1-million visitors center was dedicated there, overlooking the field
where the brothers developed and tested their plane.</LD>
<LD>   "The last 100 years have been absolutely amazing, but that's only
a precursor to what can be," former astronaut John Glenn, the first
American to orbit the Earth, told a group that included relatives of
Charles Lindbergh, the Wrights and Amelia Earhart. "I have no doubt
within the next 100 years we really will have gone to Mars."</LD>
<TE>   Glenn and Neil Armstrong, who took the "giant leap for mankind" as
the first human on the moon, were among an eclectic group of 12
aviation pioneers honored in Tuesday's ceremony at the Smithsonian's
National Air and Space Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting almost directly beneath the Wright Flyer, suspended from
the museum ceiling, Amanda Wright Lane, great-grandniece of the
Wright brothers, said her strait-laced great-uncles would have been
quietly pleased with the recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "But they would have avoided the spotlight," Lane said. "Large
crowds and ceremonies were not their cup of tea."</TE>
<TE>   Other aviation pioneers honored were Lindbergh, whose
transatlantic, single-engine "Spirit of St. Louis" also hangs in the
museum, represented by his grandson, Erik; Amelia Earhart,
represented by niece Amy Kleppner; Gen. David Lee "Tex" Hill, World
War II ace; retired Col. Charles McGee, representing the Tuskegee
Airmen; Shannon Lucid, NASA's chief scientist; Pamela Melroy, NASA
astronaut; Jody McCarrell, president of the Ninety Nines flying
group; Henry Ford, founder of Ford Motor Co., represented by his
great-grandson Edsel Ford II; and Vance Coffman, chairman and CEO of
Lockheed Martin Corp.</TE>
<TE>   At Kill Devil Hills, near Kitty Hawk on North Carolina's Outer
Banks, descendants of six of the eight witnesses to the first flight,
at 10:35 a.m. on Dec. 17, 1903, placed half a dozen wreaths at the
foot of a 1928 monument in the Wright Brothers National Memorial
marking the spot where the Flyer took off.</TE>
<TE>   An audience of about 2,000 watched as the 99 aircraft flew over in
the weather conditions that drew the Wright brothers to the North
Carolina coast -- strong, sustained wind and a clear sky. A solo
parachutist spiraled to earth trailing red smoke, followed by members
of the Army's Golden Knights parachute team who glided to the ground
about 50 feet from the granite marker indicating where the first
flight ended.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A woman who reported her brother missing in the World Trade Center
attack last year and collected survivor benefits is under
investigation after authorities found that the man does not exist,
the FBI said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The name Jeffrey Montgomery was removed from the still-fluid list
of victims last week, along with two others who were erroneously
reported missing. Authorities said Friday that they had contacted all
three, but they now say there is no Jeffrey Montgomery.</LD>
<LD>   "At this time, we don't believe that Jeffrey Montgomery exists,"
FBI Special Agent Jeff Lanza told Associated Press.</LD>
<TE>   "The FBI is investigating the possibility that his existence was
made up in order to collect survivor benefits."</TE>
<TE>   Cassaundrea Montgomery of St. Joseph, Mo., allegedly received
several thousand dollars from the Red Cross, which has raised about
$1 billion to help victims' relatives after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Her attorney, Bert Godding, declined to comment Tuesday. She has
not been charged with a crime related to the missing-person report.</TE>
<TE>   Lanza said that Montgomery was being held by local authorities in
Buchanan County, Missouri, for violation of probation related to
check fraud charges.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Extends Civil Rights Protections to Gays</HD>

<DL>ALBANY, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>After 31 years of blocking legislation to extend civil rights
protections to gays and lesbians, the Republican-controlled state
Senate on Tuesday permitted New York to join a dozen other states in
outlawing bias on the basis of sexual orientation.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. George Pataki signed the bill Tuesday, just hours after the
Senate approved the measure, 34-26, mostly due to Democratic support.</LD>
<LD>   Only a third of the Republicans backed the legislation, with some
opposed to its content and others fearing retribution from the
Conservative Party, whose chairman had made it clear that anyone who
backed the bill might lose the party's support in the 2004 elections.</LD>
<TE>   Senate GOP leader Joseph Bruno said that he had originally viewed
the measure as "counterproductive and unnecessary," but that he
ultimately decided to vote for it "to express tolerance,
antidiscrimination and just to recognize that people live their lives
the way they see fit."</TE>
<TE>   The Sexual Orientation Nondiscrimination Act, which has been
repeatedly approved by the Democratic-led Assembly, amends the
state's human rights law to prohibit discrimination against gays and
lesbians in housing, employment and public accommodations. Although
21 out of 24 Democrats supported the bill, only 13 of 36 Republicans
did so.</TE>
<TE>   After the vote, Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long said that
while no single issue would automatically cost a lawmaker his party's
support, "everybody who voted for this bill has put themselves in
jeopardy."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate's approval was notable not just because of the years of
resistance to the measure, but because it was one of the few bills in
the Legislature permitted to reach the floor with its outcome not
assured.</TE>
<TE>   The Capitol's halls were crammed with bill opponents passing out
biblical literature and holding signs, as well as cross-dressers,
people who have had sex changes and others who wanted the bill
amended to also protect transgendered people from discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   That amendment, however, failed, 41-19, but advocates still were
happy at the original bill's passage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that New York is changing," said Michael Kink,
legislative counsel for the nonprofit group Housing Works.</TE>

<HD>Fresh From 'Poetry' Gift, Ruth Lilly Donates $120 Million
to Arts Group</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Billionaire arts patron Ruth Lilly, who gave about $100 million to
Poetry magazine, is exceeding that with a gift to Americans for the
Arts.</LD>
<LD>   The donation from Lilly, the last great-grandchild of
pharmaceutical magnate Eli Lilly, will amount to more than $120
million over 30 years.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Lynch, chief executive and president of Americans for the
Arts, said he knew for more than a decade that Lilly planned a large
gift to help his organization promote and strengthen art and art
education throughout the U.S. He said he had no idea how large the
gift would be.</LD>
<TE>   The heiress had supported the group for 25 years with annual gifts
of about $10,000 to $20,000. A couple of times, she gave more for
larger projects.</TE>
<TE>   "This is quite an extraordinary ... leap," Lynch said. "We were
awed and grateful."</TE>
<TE>   He said the organization has an annual budget of $8 million and an
endowment of less than $1 million. The largest previous grant was
approximately $6 million over several years.</TE>
<TE>   The first part of Lilly's gift, which is tied in with Eli Lilly
stock, will appear in early 2003. A large portion probably will be
placed in an endowment to collect interest over the years, Lynch
said. "We want to set up something that will last forever and will
benefit all Americans forever," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The organization has been soliciting suggestions about how best to
use the money. Part of it will go to furthering current arts and
education research and to "help local people help themselves" bring
art to their communities, Lynch said.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly, 87, has in the past promoted local access to the arts
through her giving. "We have been the national organization for
that," Lynch said. "So I'm pretty sure that's why she found us to be
interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Poetry magazine, which had rejected Lilly's submitted poems for
years, announced its gift last month.</TE>

<HD>Terror Suspect's Kin Arrested in Funds Case</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BUFFALO, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Three relatives of a man accused of belonging to an Al Qaeda terror
cell in the Buffalo suburb of Lackawanna were arrested by federal
agents Tuesday and charged with illegally sending money out of the
country.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Atty. Michael Battle said there is no allegation that the
money sent to Yemen was used to fund terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Mohamed Albanna, a leader in the area's Yemeni community and an
uncle of a man still being hunted by U.S. authorities, was seized by
Customs and Drug Enforcement Administration agents in the doorway of
his Buffalo store, the Queen City Cigarettes and Candy Co.</LD>
<TE>   His younger brother, 29-year-old Ali Albanna, and a 52-year-old
cousin, Ali Taher Elbaneh, also were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   All three were indicted by a federal grand jury on a charge that
they sent more than $480,000 to Yemen without a license to operate a
money-transferring business, which is required by state law.</TE>
<TE>   All three pleaded not guilty at their arraignment in front of U.S.
District Judge Hugh Scott. If convicted, they face up to five years
in prison and a $250,000 fine. Scott ordered the men held until a
hearing today.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutor Timothy Lynch said the men sent the money out
of the country from October to December. He said Mohamed Albanna has
allegedly been transferring money illegally for two to three years.</TE>
<TE>   During a series of raids Tuesday, $130,000 was confiscated from
Mohamed Albanna's bank account and an additional $51,000 from his
cigarette and candy business.</TE>
<TE>   The Albannas' nephew, Jaber Elbaneh, an alleged member of the
Lackawanna cell, was last reported at large in Yemen, according to
U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   Six others from Lackawanna, all Yemeni American men in their 20s,
were arrested in September and charged with providing material
support to a foreign terrorist organization. Prosecutors say they
visited an Al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan in the spring of
2001 that was attended by Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Mohamed Albanna has been the face of the local Yemeni community
and an outspoken advocate for the men since their September arrest.
He has attended every hearing and continuously proclaimed their
innocence.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged leader of the local cell, Yemeni American Kamal
Derwish, was believed killed in a CIA airstrike on Nov. 3 in Yemen,
U.S. officials have said.</TE>
<TE>   The six men now in custody could get up to 15 years in prison if
convicted under a 1996 law that prohibits giving support to foreign
terrorist organizations.</TE>

<HD>Latino Survey Shows Optimism About Assimilation</HD>
<DH>Most of the 3,000 respondents say they want to become U.S.
citizens, but they also cite discrimination as a barrier to success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Most Latino immigrants want to settle in the United States, learn
English and become citizens, but they feel that discrimination is a
major barrier to success, according to a national survey released
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The poll of nearly 3,000 Latino adults, including immigrants and
those born here, was billed as the most comprehensive contemporary
look at an expanding population of more than 35 million U.S.
residents.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the first portrait of the Hispanic population as it is now,
after the growth experienced during the 1990s," said Roberto Suro,
director of the nonprofit Pew Hispanic Center, which conducted the
study with the Kaiser Family Foundation.</LD>
<TE>   The survey did not break out undocumented immigrants. But previous
estimates have placed the number from Mexico alone at 3 million to 5
million people. Nearly two-thirds of all U.S. Latinos are of Mexican
origin.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the poll found that Latinos are assimilating into U.S.
society in a distinctive manner that preserves ties to ancestral
lands and some traditional attitudes about family. "The melting pot
is still quite powerful," said Suro.</TE>
<TE>   Some findings ran counter to widely held perceptions. For example,
the poll found that the degree of assimilation into U.S. society is
more powerful than national origin in shaping the attitudes of
Latinos. And discrimination by Latinos against other Latinos is seen
as similar to bias in society at large.</TE>
<TE>   "The sense of discrimination [by other Latinos] is not based on
race, but rather it is economic, and, in some cases, due to country
of origin," Suro said.</TE>
<TE>   On the whole, Latinos are optimistic about the United States, the
poll found. Nearly 90% said they believe opportunities to get ahead
are better here than in their home countries. Among Latinos born
outside the U.S., 28% said they are already citizens, and an
additional 52% said they are planning to apply for citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   English becomes the dominant language among Latinos within a
generation. While 72% of the immigrant generation said Spanish was
their primary language, only 7% of second-generation Latinos had the
same response. Among the third and subsequent generations, 78% said
English was their primary language, and 22% described themselves as
bilingual.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking English and being born in the United States are key
variables in the assimilation of Latinos. "English-dominant Latinos
share views with non-Hispanic whites that are very different from
their Spanish-dominant counterparts," said Mollyann Brodie, polling
director at the Kaiser foundation.</TE>
<TE>   For example, 22% of Latino immigrants agreed with the statement
that success in the American workplace requires working long hours at
the expense of one's personal life. Among U.S.-born Latinos, 40% said
long hours are the price of success. By comparison, 46% of non-Latino
whites answered similarly.</TE>
<TE>   U.S.-born Latinos were more likely than immigrants to be accepting
of divorce, homosexuality and having children outside of marriage.</TE>
<TE>   On the importance of family, however, U.S.-born Latinos line up
more closely with their forebears. Eighty-two percent said relatives
were more important than friends, compared with 67% of non-Latino
whites.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of birthplace, the poll found that a majority of
Latinos cited discrimination as a barrier to success in America.
Immigrants were more likely than those born in the United States to
describe it as a major problem.</TE>
<TE>   Latinos also cited discrimination by other Latinos as pervasive.
Among the foreign-born, 57% said it is a major obstacle, while the
U.S.-born were more likely to see it as a minor aggravation.</TE>
<TE>   Differences in income and education were cited by 41% as the main
reason Latinos discriminate against each other, while 34% cited
country of origin and 8% cited differences in skin color.</TE>
<TE>   Colombians were the most likely to cite discrimination by other
Latinos as a major problem, followed by Dominicans and Salvadorans.</TE>
<TE>   Experiencing Bias</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether they or a close friend or relative had
personally experienced discrimination in the last five years, 31% of
Latinos said they had, compared with 46% of African Americans and 13%
of non-Latino whites.</TE>
<TE>   Latinos were most likely to identify themselves by using their
family's country of origin. A majority said they do not fit in the
traditional white/black racial categories of American society.</TE>
<TE>   Most Latinos see no difference between the terms "Hispanic" and
"Latino," the poll found. Among those who expressed a preference, 34%
said they favored Hispanic, while 13% favored Latino.</TE>
<TE>   In California, 32% preferred Hispanic, while 17% picked Latino.</TE>
<TE>   To allow comparisons with other groups in American society, the
survey also interviewed whites and African Americans. The margin of
error was plus or minus 2.4 percentage points for Latinos overall,
and higher for other groups.</TE>

<HD>Exit That Could Turn Into a Messy Power Play</HD>
<DH>There's no consensus on who should succeed Lott as GOP
leader. Scramble could pit White House favorite vs. the darling of
the conservative camp.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Beleaguered Trent Lott has one wild-card advantage in his struggle to
hold onto his Senate Republican leadership post: There is no
consensus about who should succeed him.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, if the Mississippi Republican is forced to relinquish his
title as Senate majority leader, a messy succession struggle is
likely among ambitious senators with very different claims to power.</LD>
<LD>   The scramble could pit a senator who is the darling of the party's
conservative wing -- Don Nickles of Oklahoma -- against a colleague
who is the White House favorite, Bill Frist of Tennessee. Waiting in
the wings are two conservative insiders, Sens. Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky and Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who already hold GOP
leadership posts.</LD>
<TE>   The competition, if Lott falls, will force Republicans to rethink
what kind of leader they want as the party scrambles to end the
imbroglio over his recent comments, which seemed to endorse
segregation. At stake is whether and how the GOP can repair the
damage many believe has been done to President Bush's push to remake
the party's image as one of "compassionate conservatism" that is more
welcoming to minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Pragmatic political calculations will not be the only factor
determining a potential successor to Lott. Leadership decisions
invariably hinge on more inscrutable factors of personal loyalty and
competing ambitions in the Senate's insular world.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not regional, it's not ideological," said Grover Norquist, a
conservative activist who is close to congressional GOP leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the number of Republican senators in the new
Congress, he said: "It's 51 guys who like and hate each other for
reasons you and I don't remember."</TE>
<TE>   The issue is expected to come to a head in an emergency meeting
set for Jan. 6. Nickles called for the meeting to reconsider whether
Lott should retain the leadership job, but neither he nor any other
senator has begun openly campaigning to replace him.</TE>
<TE>   "All the relatives are standing around the bed waiting for the
life support to be cut off," said one Senate Republican aide. "No one
wants to talk about the inheritance."</TE>
<TE>   Lott may yet resign his post before the Jan. 6 meeting; a source
close to him said Tuesday that as of now, he lacks the 26 votes
needed to remain leader.</TE>
<TE>   Lott's future was thrown into turmoil by his comments, at the
100th birthday party for Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) Dec. 5, in
which he suggested that the country would have been better off if
Thurmond's segregationist presidential campaign in 1948 had
triumphed.</TE>
<TE>   Lott, 61, has apologized repeatedly, saying he did not mean to
endorse segregation. But the criticism leveled at him -- by both
Republicans and Democrats -- has undercut the momentum the GOP picked
up in the November elections, which gave them control of the Senate
and expanded their majority in the House.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has distanced himself from the controversy -- and Lott. He
harshly criticized Lott for his remarks, but he has not called on him
to resign his leadership job.</TE>
<TE>   Still, GOP sources say that by failing to come to Lott's defense,
the White House has made it clear the president would prefer another
leader. The White House has also let it be known that its preferred
candidate is Frist.</TE>
<TE>   "That helps; it sends a signal that there is an alternative the
White House feels comfortable with," said a Senate Republican aide.
"Whether or not Sen. Frist agrees he has a role to play is another
question entirely."</TE>
<TE>   Frist has gained political stature recently because he headed the
GOP's 2002 campaign committee. As the Senate's only physician, he
also was in the spotlight during last year's anthrax scare on Capitol
Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Frist, 50, is a conservative but is seen as more in sync with
Bush's efforts to reach out to minorities. During a conference call
of Senate Republicans on Friday to discuss Lott, a source said, Frist
raised strong concerns about the toll the furor was taking on African
American attitudes toward the GOP. He expressed his concerns so
forcefully that Rep. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who next month will
move into Thurmond's Senate seat, asked whether he was arguing that
Lott should step down; Frist said no.</TE>
<TE>   Republican sources said it is not clear that Frist, who is thought
to harbor presidential ambitions, would want to be Senate leader. One
of Frist's liabilities, strategists say, is that he is relatively new
to Congress -- he was first elected in 1994 -- and untested as a
Senate leader.</TE>
<TE>   McConnell, 60, is more clearly endowed with those kinds of insider
skills. He was just elected assistant Republican leader -- the No. 2
post -- and is considered a sharp legislative tactician.</TE>
<TE>   McConnell has been making calls to fellow Republicans to shore up
support for Lott, not to challenge him. In the Friday conference call
-- which followed a Lott news conference -- McConnell warned that if
Lott was forced from the leadership, he might also quit the Senate.
Depending on the timing of such a move, Mississippi Gov. Ronnie
Musgrove, a Democrat, could replace Lott with another Democrat. The
Senate's party breakdown then would be 50 Republicans, 49 Democrats
and one independent, who typically votes with the Democrats. That
would mean the GOP majority would hinge on Vice President Dick's
Cheney role as the chamber's presiding officer.</TE>
<TE>   Many GOP activists are close to Nickles, 54, who has cultivated
ties with both social and fiscal conservatives. He has spearheaded
the party's pro-business efforts -- such as fighting increases in the
minimum wage -- and is a leading proponent of tax and spending cuts.</TE>
<TE>   He is a longtime Lott rival, and he had considered challenging him
for the leadership job in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Before news surfaced Sunday of his call for the meeting to
reconsider Lott's position, Nickles phoned Bush's chief political
advisor, Karl Rove, as well as Lott to notify them of what he was
doing.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that effort to prevent the White House and Lott from being
surprised, Nickles might be hurt by a backlash to his call for the
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are not happy with Nickles," said a moderate
Republican who asked not to be named. "He got out in the open so
quickly for personal reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Another potential candidate for leader is Santorum, who is
chairman of the Senate Republican Conference. Although it ultimately
was his decision to schedule the meeting that Nickles sought,
Republicans say he has been trying to rally rank-and-file members to
Lott's aid.</TE>
<TE>   Santorum has close ties to social conservatives; he frequently
takes the lead in pushing antiabortion legislation. But at age 44, he
may be considered too young to rise above more-senior Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   One element all of the possible successors have in common: They
are more worrisome to Democrats, who would rather see Lott stay in
power with his wounded image.</TE>
<TE>   "Each one would be better [for the Republicans] than Lott," said
an aide to a senior Senate Democrat. "With Lott, every day can be a
holiday. You never know what he is going to do."</TE>

<HD>103 Children in State Care Still Missing in Florida</HD>
<DH>Gov. Bush touts task forces that helped in the searches,
but child advocates are skeptical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John-Thor Dahlburg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Despite nearly four months of searching, Florida authorities have not
found 103 missing children who were in the care of the state's
Department of Children &amp; Families, officials announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Accentuating the positive, Gov. Jeb Bush and members of his
administration stressed that most of the missing -- 290 of 393
children -- had been located because of the creation of regional,
multi-agency "strike forces." But child-care advocates said the
statistic was no proof the state's checkered record in child care,
which was a major issue in Bush's successful reelection battle last
month, was now better.</LD>
<LD>   "On the one hand, we're bringing the forces of law enforcement,
technology and four major state departments together because of
concerns about 400 children," said Jack Levine, president of the
Center for Florida's Children, a Tallahassee-based statewide advocacy
organization. "Yeah, let's do that, but what about the 40,000 other
children who do not have the level of professional counseling and
long-term quality care they should?"</LD>
<TE>   After a scandal over the disappearance of a 5-year-old girl in
state-supervised care rocked his administration, Bush ordered the
Department of Children &amp; Families and law enforcement agencies last
August to cooperate in hunting for other missing children.</TE>
<TE>   "The life of every youngster in our state is precious, and
Operation SafeKids is indeed making a difference in the lives of
Florida's families," Bush said Tuesday. "The partnership between DCF
and the law enforcement community has been successful in locating
missing kids and has helped to establish a system that will better
protect the children in our state."</TE>
<TE>   Of the children not found, officials said 88 are still being
sought by police, including Rilya Wilson, the little girl who was
discovered to be missing from her foster home in the Miami area last
May. It took DCF officials 15 months to realize she was gone.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Rilya, most of the missing are teenage runaways, or are
believed to have been snatched by a noncustodial parent, DCF
spokesman Owen Roach said. Fourteen others were minors when put in
the agency's care but have since turned 18. They are now being sought
by police as adult missing persons, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   One 17-year-old girl who had been placed in a juvenile
intervention program, Melissa Karp, was apparently murdered. Her body
was found in a canal in southwest Florida's Collier County.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working to fill the cup," Roach said of the children whose
whereabouts are still unknown. "But if finding one missing child is a
victory, finding nearly 300 is a great victory."</TE>
<TE>   The Rilya Wilson case led to months of embarrassing headlines
about the gaps in Florida's child care system, and ultimately to a
high-level shake-up in the Department of Children &amp; Families.</TE>
<TE>   But Richard Gelles, interim dean of the school of social work at
the University of Pennsylvania, said people in other states should
not believe their agencies perform any better when it comes to
keeping track of foster children.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation is mirrored in practically every other state,"
Gelles said in a telephone interview. "That is because of the truly
archaic information management systems that the states rely on."</TE>
<TE>   According to the Ivy League academic, a shipping company like
Federal Express uses technology to track parcels that is far more
advanced than what states have to keep tabs on children in their
custody. To some extent, Gelles said, the federal government bears a
share of the blame, because since 1990, it has allocated block grants
to state child care agencies to create what data specialists call
"legacy systems."</TE>
<TE>   Those files, said Gelles, "count what you've done, but are
incapable of telling you what you're doing. What you're doing is kept
in paper files."</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, each night in the United States, "560,000 children
go to sleep in foster care, and they are being tracked by paper and
pencil," Gelles said. If social workers were equipped with something
as simple as a Palm Pilot, he said, computerized records could be
updated much more rapidly to reflect a child's change of address or
disappearance. A truly revolutionary approach, Gelles said, would be
to connect foster homes and institutions with the child-care agency
via the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   In March, a draft report by the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services found Florida in "substantial compliance" with federal
guidelines in five of seven categories on child care, but said the
state had a long way to go in tracking abuse cases and providing
adequate foster homes, mental health counseling and other services to
children in the system.</TE>

<HD>Man Who Shot Priest Accepts Deal</HD>
<DH>Former Baltimore altar boy, who claims victim had molested
him repeatedly, agrees to plea-bargain on lesser gun charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Braun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>The palm-sized Bible that Dontee Stokes carried with him into the
dimly lit courtroom had blue ink scrawled around a verse from the
book of Timothy. "My son, be strong" were the words his mother
circled just hours after a Baltimore jury acquitted him of shooting a
Catholic priest who Stokes claims molested him a decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking in a whisper when a judge called on him Tuesday, the
former altar boy accepted a sentencing deal with Baltimore city
prosecutors. Under the arrangement, Stokes would avoid jail time and
be kept under house arrest for 11 months -- a result of three handgun
convictions handed down by the same jury that freed him Monday night
in the attempted murder of Father Maurice J. Blackwell.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel like it's a new beginning," Stokes said afterward,
insisting that the jury "didn't acquit me out of sympathy. They made
that decision based on the facts in the case."</LD>
<TE>   Jurors filing out of the courthouse Tuesday backed up Stokes'
assessment. Several of the panelists -- who deliberated for eight
hours Monday before acquitting Stokes, 26, of attempted murder --
said they were not trying to send a message about the swelling
national debate over the Catholic Church's flawed handling of priests
accused of child abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "We just felt the state didn't do a very good job of proving their
case," said juror Catherine Robinson, a restaurant manager. But
Robinson, a practicing Catholic, said she and other jurors also
became convinced during the five-day trial that Baltimore's
archdiocese had failed to take Stokes seriously when he repeatedly
came forward in the early 1990s with allegations that Blackwell had
molested him 20 times.</TE>
<TE>   She likened the church's failure in Baltimore to a similar
controversy in Boston that led to a spate of lawsuits against the
church and last week's resignation in Rome of Boston's Cardinal
Bernard Law.</TE>
<TE>   Testifying for three hours, Stokes said that his rising
frustration and anger with officials who ignored his pleas toppled
him into an emotional freefall that led to the shooting. "What I did
was an act of God," Stokes said in a brief hallway interview. "It was
nothing that I planned."</TE>
<TE>   Stokes testified that he had seen Blackwell May 13 while driving
down a Baltimore street and emerged from his car to talk to the
priest. The 56-year-old Blackwell spurned him, Stokes said -- a final
rebuke that left him feeling "outside my body." Stokes pulled a
silver-plated .357-magnum handgun from his backpack and shot
Blackwell, wounding him in the left hand and hip.</TE>
<TE>   Stokes fled, but two hours later he confessed to a priest and
surrendered to police. During the trial, his lawyer, Warren A. Brown,
raised a defense of temporary insanity and presented testimony by a
psychiatrist who said that Stokes was psychologically scarred by the
molestations. Stokes could have been sentenced to life if he had been
convicted on the attempted murder and assault charges.</TE>
<TE>   Several jurors were critical of Baltimore's Cardinal William H.
Keeler for not dealing more forcefully with Blackwell after Stokes
came forward with his allegations a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt the Catholic Church could have played a great role here
and it's sad that they didn't," Robinson said.</TE>
<TE>   She cited a 1993 decision by Keeler to force Blackwell to undergo
three months of spiritual evaluation therapy in Connecticut after
Stokes went to church officials with his story. Afterward, Keeler
allowed Blackwell to return to his post at St. Edward Catholic Church
in west Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   "All he got was 90 days of therapy for what he did?" Robinson
said, still outraged. "That was too little, too late."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Blackwell was suspended by the Baltimore Archdiocese
after admitting he had an affair with another teenage boy.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, Keeler apologized for his dealings with
Blackwell and approached Stokes, asking his forgiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Keeler released a statement Tuesday saying that "one sad chapter
is concluded, but there remains much healing ahead." Keeler said his
"prayers are with Dontee Stokes," whom he described as "a young man
who has shown much promise."</TE>
<TE>   Despite voicing a hope that Baltimore's Catholics and residents
"may find a greater measure of reconciliation," Keeler offered no
specific efforts to deal with similar matters.</TE>
<TE>   Stokes declined to say whether the cardinal's apology was
acceptable, but he added: "It wasn't an apology that I wanted."
Several relatives who joined him in the courtroom were less guarded.
"If Cardinal Keeler knew about this, he should resign from his post,
just like Cardinal Law," said Tamara Stokes, Dontee's mother. "The
church should clean house all across the country."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors, as well as Stokes, his lawyer and family, also said that
prosecutors erred in failing to aggressively investigate Blackwell
when the youth came forward in the early 1990s. During the trial,
Baltimore police Lt. Frederick V. Roussey said that Roberta Siskind,
a city prosecutor, refused to allow him to interview Blackwell about
Stokes' complaints in 1993. Roussey said that Siskind told him: "He's
been doing this for a long time. Just sit on it."</TE>
<TE>   Siskind denied that account during her testimony, but Robinson and
several other jurors said they believed the officer. "We felt the
state's attorney failed to pursue this case," Robinson said.</TE>
<TE>   City prosecutors have opened a probe into Stokes' allegations.
Clearly sympathetic to Stokes, the jury even allowed one member to
send a note to Baltimore Circuit Judge John N. Prevas when the
verdicts were issued, urging leniency. Sentencing was delayed until
Feb. 14, after Brown and city prosecutor Sylvester Cox told the judge
they had reached an agreement allowing Stokes to serve no more than
an 11-month term and three years of probation in exchange for
withdrawing a plea of diminished capacity on the gun convictions.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said he would likely appeal the three gun convictions, but
Cox said that he would urge the judge to allow Stokes' "time served"
for the seven months he has spent under house arrest.</TE>
<TE>   As Brown and his client slowly made their way out of the
courtroom, waylaid by embraces from sobbing relatives and smiling
jurors, Dontee Stokes reached by instinct to a pocket inside the
jacket of his gray suit.</TE>
<TE>   His mother's Bible was still there.</TE>

<HD>Missouri Tuition Illegal, Judge Rules</HD>
<DH>University system broke 1872 law, he says. Instate
undergrads could be owed $450 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>A judge has ruled that the University of Missouri broke the law for
15 years by charging thousands of instate undergraduates an estimated
$450 million in illegal tuition.</LD>
<LD>   St. Louis County Circuit Judge Kenneth Romines found that the
state broke an 1872 law requiring free tuition within the university
system for all qualified Missouri youths over age 16.</LD>
<LD>   University President Manuel T. Pacheco had argued that
"educational fees" the university imposed from 1986 to last year
differed from tuition. The fee was based on each credit hour.</LD>
<TE>   But in his Dec. 6 ruling, Romines wrote that educational fees and
tuition are the same. "Dr. Pacheco's testimony was nothing more than
pure pretense, incredible, and sadly not believable," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The judge did not award damages to students enrolled at the
Columbia, Rolla, Kansas City and St. Louis campuses between 1986 and
2001. A full refund could cost up to $450 million, the university
estimated.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously that would be a very devastating thing to happen for
the university," university spokesman Joe Moore said Tuesday. Moore
said the university is leaning toward an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs' lawyer said he doesn't want to bankrupt the
university but wants some kind of remedy.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is any way that the court would order $500
million plus interest," said Robert Herman, who filed the lawsuit on
behalf of three students. "That would be unreasonable. But the judge
has a lot of discretion to fashion an equitable remedy."</TE>
<TE>   Herman said issuing vouchers for several years is one possible
solution. Current students could use the vouchers for tuition, while
alumni could donate them to the university for a tax credit or use
them for their children.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the governor signed a measure overturning the 1872 law.
It allows the university system to collect "tuition and other fees."</TE>

<HD>Icing May Be Cause in Wellstone Crash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal investigators believe icing may be a cause of the plane crash
that killed Sen. Paul Wellstone and seven others after determining
that the engines and propellers were working properly.</LD>
<LD>   The National Transportation Safety Board issued a progress report
Tuesday as part of its investigation into why the chartered King Air
A100 plane crashed and burned about 2 1/2 miles from the
Eveleth-Virginia Municipal Airport in Minnesota on Oct. 25.</LD>
<LD>   The two Pratt &amp; Whitney engines and propellers made by Hartzell
were examined and "no evidence of pre-impact engine or propeller
failure was found," the report said.</LD>
<TE>   NTSB investigators continued looking at other possible causes,
including bad weather, inaccurate navigational aids and human error,
fatigue or disorientation.</TE>
<TE>   Wellstone, a Democrat from Minnesota, was headed to the funeral of
a state representative's father when the plane crashed in freezing
rain and light snow. Wellstone's wife, Sheila, their 33-year-old
daughter, Marcia Wellstone Markuson, and five others were killed.</TE>
<TE>   The NTSB said specialists at the National Center for Atmospheric
Research in Boulder, Colo., are working with the safety board to
determine the icing conditions that existed along the flight's route.</TE>

<HD>New York to Unveil New Proposals for Trade Center Site</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Getlin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Nine new designs for the World Trade Center site, created by some of
the world's most prominent architectural firms, will be unveiled
today in a locally televised, four-hour presentation.</LD>
<LD>   The proposals, culled from more than 400 designs submitted by an
array of international firms, contain blueprints for floating
memorials to the victims of last year's World Trade Center attacks,
massive public spaces enclosed in glass and, in several designs,
plans to construct the world's tallest office buildings.</LD>
<LD>   After the designs are presented to the public in the World
Financial Center's Winter Garden building, planning officials will
gather feedback and make a final decision on the World Trade Center
design by Jan. 31. A separate competition will be held for the design
of a memorial later next year.</LD>
<TE>   "What you will see will be very different from the six site plans
that were presented last summer," Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg recently
told a meeting of New York planners and business officials.</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to proposals unveiled last summer that were
roundly criticized by architects and public groups for being
unimaginative and too focused on jamming in office space. After those
plans were rejected, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey,
which owns the site, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., which
is supervising reconstruction of the area, called for new proposals.
This time, firms were invited to be more flexible and creative in
their designs, including how much office space should fill the area,
and the physical dimensions of a memorial.</TE>
<TE>   The finalists are Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, which recently
unveiled new design plans for World Trade Center 7, an adjacent
building; Richard Meier &amp; Partners, which designed the Getty Center
in Los Angeles; Studio Daniel Libeskind in Germany, known for its
design of the Jewish Museum in Berlin; United Architects, a
collaborative venture among several firms, including Greg Lynn of Los
Angeles; Foster and Partners in England; Think, a team that includes
New York architects Rafael Vinoly and Frederic Schwartz; and Peterson
Littenberg, another New York firm. Although seven firms made the
final cut, Think has submitted three proposals. "Some of these new
designs make eloquent statements about what happened on 9/11, some
speak of hope, [and] some boldly restore the skyline in ways that
say, in no uncertain terms, this is New York, and the terrorists
didn't win," the mayor added. "Some do all three."</TE>
<TE>   Although planning officials will be guided by the Jan. 31
decision, the actual layout of the 16-acre site will not be known for
some time, and construction is not expected to be completed until
2008, redevelopment officials have said.</TE>
<TE>   The first task will be to construct a new transportation network
on the site, repairing badly damaged subway routes and commuter rail
networks, Bloomberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Some tantalizing details have leaked out, such as the proposal for
office buildings higher than Malaysia's 1,483-foot Petronas Twin
Towers, currently the world's tallest buildings. By contrast, Meier
has said that buildings cover only one-fourth of the site in his
plan, which includes a floating "memorial plaza" on the Hudson River,
as well as a park with 2,800 lights, one commemorating each victim.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Higgins, a spokesman for the Lower Manhattan Development
Corp., said the four-hour unveiling will be "a completely unique
experience" that invites the public to physically interact with
models of the proposals. Lengthy public hearings are planned in the
coming weeks. But some organizations have complained that there will
be less than two months from the unveiling to the final decision.
Organizations representing families of victims and survivors of the
Sept. 11 attacks have criticized planners for scheduling the event
during the holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   The nine proposals will be on display at the Winter Garden from
Dec. 20 through the end of January and online this afternoon at
www.renewNYC.com.</TE>

<HD>Diuretics Effective in Fighting Heart Disease, Research
Finds</HD>
<DH>They're better, cheaper than newer hypertension drugs,
study says. Wider use could save thousands of lives and hundreds of
millions of dollars annually.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas H. Maugh II</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inexpensive diuretics are more effective than newer, more expensive
hypertension drugs in preventing deaths from heart disease, and using
the old-fashioned "water pills" more widely could save 60,000 lives
and hundreds of millions of dollars per year, according to the first
head-to-head comparison of the drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Diuretics, which ease the load on the heart by forcing the body to
excrete excess water and sodium, should be the first choice of drugs
for physicians treating the estimated 50 million Americans with
hypertension, researchers said, and patients already receiving other
drugs should have diuretics added to their regimens.</LD>
<LD>   The other hypertension drugs, which include calcium channel
blockers such as amlodipine (sold under the brand name Norvasc) and
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as lisinopril
(Zestril and Prinivil), had previously been shown to be more
effective than placebos, but they had never been tested against
diuretics.</LD>
<TE>   "Yet these more costly medications were often promoted as having
advantages over older drugs," said Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of
the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. "Now, at last, we can
make those needed comparisons and know which blood-pressure drug to
use to begin therapy," said Lenfant, whose institute sponsored the
study.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite simply, this is one of the most important trials of
antihypertensive drug therapy," said Dr. Lawrence J. Appel of Johns
Hopkins University.</TE>
<TE>   The study, published today in the Journal of the American Medical
Assn., did not look at some even newer drugs, however, and did not
consider the effects of combinations of drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Diuretics were once the main course of treatment for hypertension
until other drugs were developed. In 1982, they were prescribed to
56% of patients receiving treatment for high blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   But only a decade later, that proportion had fallen to 27%. Fully
two-thirds of the $15 billion spent each year on blood-pressure drugs
now goes to calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors, experts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Norvasc, produced by Pfizer Inc., is the best-selling brand-name
hypertension drug in the world, with sales of more than $3.5 billion
each year. It costs patients between $1.40 and $1.60 per day. The
most widely used diuretics, in contrast, cost about 6 to 10 cents per
day. Had patients stuck with diuretics between 1982 and 1992, Lenfant
said, they and their insurers would have saved $3.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Experts cautioned that patients taking other drugs should not
stop, but should consult with their physicians about switching to
diuretics or adding them to their regimens.</TE>
<TE>   Many patients will require the use of more than one drug to keep
their blood pressure under control, said Dr. L. Julian Haywood of
USC, and some patients are not good candidates for diuretics -- such
as those with kidney problems and electrolyte or fluid imbalances.</TE>
<TE>   The eight-year trial, known by the acronym ALLHAT, enrolled 33,357
patients 55 years or older who had high blood pressure and at least
one other risk factor for heart disease, such as diabetes, smoking
and high cholesterol levels. The patients were divided into four
groups who were randomly assigned to receive either a diuretic
(chlorthalidone), a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), an ACE
inhibitor (lisinopril) or another group of hypertension drugs called
alpha-adrenergic blockers (doxazosin).</TE>
<TE>   The alpha-adrenergic blocker part of the study was halted more
than two years ago because patients receiving it did significantly
worse than those receiving the other drugs.</TE>
<TE>   After an average of about five years of follow-up, the team found
that patients receiving amlodipine had a 38% higher risk of
developing heart failure and a 35% higher risk of being hospitalized
than those receiving chlorthalidone.</TE>
<TE>   Those taking lisinopril had a 15% higher risk of stroke (40%
higher in African Americans), a 19% higher risk of developing heart
failure and an 11% higher risk of being hospitalized or treated for
angina (chest pain).</TE>
<TE>   "The take-home message is that doctors should begin drug treatment
for high blood pressure with a diuretic," said Dr. Paul Whelton of
Tulane University.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Norvasc maker Pfizer dropped 57 cents to close at $30.48
in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   A separate arm of the ALLHAT study involving another 10,355
patients compared the cholesterol-lowering drug pravastatin to a
group receiving what researchers called "usual care" -- exercise and
a change in diet. After five years of follow-up, the team concluded
that the two groups had similar death rates from heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   But experts such as Dr. Richard C. Pasternak of Massachusetts
General Hospital questioned the findings. He noted that, by the end
of the follow-up period, 30% of the patients in the treatment group
had stopped taking their pravastatin, and nearly 30% of the patients
in the usual-care group were taking it or a similar statin because
they were unable to control their cholesterol levels otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   These findings "should be examined more closely," because the
failure of patients to adhere to their regimens muddied the results,
said Dr. Robert Bonow, president of the American Heart Assn.</TE>

<HD>Pop Gets Crackle, Snap Back</HD>
<DH>In the high-tech world of pure digital sound, some
recording artists evoke the scratchy past by adding in noises from
the vinyl era.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What do rapper Eminem, country singer Toby Keith and the Transplants,
an alternative-rock band, have in common?</LD>
<LD>   Listen to certain songs on their latest albums, and you'll pick up
the scratchy clues. Each CD features the kind of snaps, crackles and
pops that marred the bygone era of vinyl records. But these noises
were not caused by wear, tear or an inebriated party guest bumping
into a phonograph. They were put there deliberately.</LD>
<LD>   Today's pure-sounding digital CDs leave some musicians and
listeners cold, like a hearth with a blazing fire that's all flame,
no crackle or heat.</LD>
<TE>   So, like furniture manufacturers who pound, ding and scratch
tables and chairs to make them look time-ravaged, or jeans makers who
pre-fade their denims to save customers the bother, musicians and
record producers are using computer technology to make songs captured
in crystalline digital audio sound as if they've been spinning on a
cheap record player for years.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of contemporary recordings can sound very similar," says
singer-songwriter Pete Yorn, whose modern-rock hit, "Life on a
Chain," starts out sounding like a battered 78 rpm. "So, an old
record that's very dirty sounding and all staticky can sound pretty
good when you put it on."</TE>
<TE>   For some artists, surface noise is a novelty, a way to make their
recordings stand out.</TE>
<TE>   For others, it's a heartfelt nod to an earlier era in music, when
records themselves, not just the music within their grooves, were
cherished objects whose nicks and scars, like the dogeared pages of a
beloved book, attested to the years of enjoyment they'd given.</TE>
<TE>   Today's computer-conjured imperfections can provide a shortcut to
instant character, similar to the post-production tricks that make
new movies look like pitted and scratched black-and-white films.</TE>
<TE>   Eminem tosses in vinyl noise at the start of "Without Me," the
lively hit single from "The Eminem Show," the bestselling album of
2002.</TE>
<TE>   Keith uses it on "Good to Go to Mexico" from his "Unleashed"
album, one of the top-selling country collections of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The Transplants' "Diamonds and Guns," one of the hottest songs on
alternative-rock stations across the country, sounds as if it has
taken a few too many rides on someone's turntable.</TE>
<TE>   More hissing, ticks and assorted noise turn up on recent tracks by
alt-rock groups Wilco and Bright Eyes, R&amp;B singer-songwriter Lamya,
even country music titan Johnny Cash.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's an answer to how pristine everything sounds today,"
says Jeff Greenberg, chief executive of the Village, one of the
busiest recording studios in Los Angeles, and vice president of the
Society of Professional Audio Recording Services.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's striving for such technical perfection, they're
forgetting that some of the greatest records in history were done in
scratchy old mono. You could tell that the players put their hearts
and souls into their playing. The performances moved you, and it had
nothing to do with 96 channels of high-sample-rate digital audio."</TE>
<TE>   Perfect Pitch</TE>
<TE>   Two decades ago, the music and consumer electronics industries
trumpeted a quantum leap in audio technology.</TE>
<TE>   The birth of digital recording and the invention of the compact
disc as a playback medium would forever eliminate the pops and
scratches that often came between music and music lovers. And unlike
vinyl LPs, CDs would never wear out.</TE>
<TE>   But a funny thing happened on the way to sonic perfection: Some
people found they missed the noise.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's your vinyl, all those scratches mean it's your
soundtrack," says Pete Howard, publisher of ICE magazine, a monthly
publication for music junkies.</TE>
<TE>   Says Greenberg: "It puts a record into a frame of reference that
suddenly orients you toward another time as well as a specific
sound."</TE>
<TE>   That's what Keith was after in "Good to Go to Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   "When I wrote that song, it had a real old-school sound to the
opening chords," says the Oklahoma singer and songwriter. "We wanted
it to sound ... like something from the '30s or '40s, and then bring
it up to the modern day for the rest of the song, which has a real
modern Latin feel to it."</TE>
<TE>   In Keith's song, as with most of the current examples, the
simulated noise appears for a few seconds, then gives way to digital
purity.</TE>
<TE>   Some say these studio-incubated flaws, far from detracting from
the music, actually make it stand out.</TE>
<TE>   With digital recordings, "there's almost too much clarity, so you
hear everything separately ... and sometimes that's a little
distracting to the music," says Eric Persing, creative director of
Spectrasonics, a Burbank software manufacturer. He's the inventor of
Stylus, the company's software package that allows vinyl noise
effects to be added during editing.</TE>
<TE>   "Some aspects of older recordings make them a more pleasant way to
listen to the music," Persing added. "The brain is not trying to
focus on all the individual elements, so it can focus on the song."</TE>
<TE>   The return of the clicks and skips partly reflects the enduring
appeal of vinyl recordings.</TE>
<TE>   Although CDs long ago replaced LPs and cassette tapes as the music
industry's dominant playback format, a dedicated cult of vinyl
worshipers persists. These fans say that so-called analog recordings,
pressed on vinyl, sound warmer and capture performances more
faithfully than do digital CDs.</TE>
<TE>   Analog recording transforms sound waves into electrical signals
that are etched into the grooves of the vinyl disc and converted back
into sound waves by a phonograph needle, amplifier and loudspeakers.</TE>
<TE>   Vinyl loyalists contend that digital recordings can sound harsh
and icily sterile because the process breaks up the continuous sound
waves into millions of separate bits that are translated into numbers
for storage, editing and duplication via computer.</TE>
<TE>   Pop acts from Beck to Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers to Jurassic 5
cater to LP aficionados by releasing limited editions of their albums
on vinyl.</TE>
<TE>   The Recording Industry Assn. of America reports that more than $82
million worth of LPs were sold in 2001, up slightly from the previous
two years. Sales of CDs totaled $12.2 billion last year, the
association says.</TE>
<TE>   Some suggest that introducing a smidgen of aural junk into
contamination-free digital recordings makes them better reflect real
life.</TE>
<TE>   "In the age we live in, there are not many pure environments for
people to hear things clearly anyway," says singer-songwriter Jeff
Tweedy of the alt-rock group Wilco, who regularly incorporates all
manner of noise, from vinyl scratches to radio static, in the group's
recordings.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially for anyone living in a city, our environment is pretty
polluted, and I think we've grown very comfortable with that. It
makes things sound very unreal not to have something competing with
what supposedly is the content, what is supposed to be the meaning."</TE>
<TE>   Idea Is an Oldie</TE>
<TE>   The idea of adding noise to recordings isn't new.</TE>
<TE>   The New Vaudeville Band had a No. 1 hit in 1966 with "Winchester
Cathedral," which mimicked the compressed range and rickety sound of
a 78-rpm record from the 1920s. Two years later, the Beatles added
scratchy vinyl noise to "Rocky Raccoon" on the album "The Beatles,"
popularly known as "The White Album."</TE>
<TE>   The Monkees went a step further in 1968 with the song "Magnolia
Simms," which sounded as if the record was skipping and the needle
was being carelessly dragged across the grooves.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the Long Beach punk-reggae band Sublime had a modern-rock
radio hit with "Doin' Time," which incorporated noisy vinyl effects
in the opening bars.</TE>
<TE>   In the digital age, vinyl noise has shown up most frequently in
hip-hop music, one genre that never abandoned vinyl. DJs create
"scratching" sound effects by manually manipulating vinyl records on
turntables as rappers fire out their rhymes.</TE>
<TE>   But advances in recording technology have made it possible to
create such effects at will in the studio. Editing software allows
editing and mixing on desktop and laptop computers, instead of the
old method of physically cutting and pasting audiotape.</TE>
<TE>   Any sound can now be digitally recorded, then mixed with the
strains of guitars, strings, horns or other instruments wherever a
musician wants. These sampled sounds -- noise included -- can be
altered in pitch, tempo or other sonic characteristics, like colors
added to a painter's palette.</TE>
<TE>   The noises associated with vinyl records, like the lines on
country-music legend Merle Haggard's face or the white hairs in
Santa's beard, are so instantly evocative of age, character and
experience that musicians and producers find them hard to resist.</TE>
<TE>   "It does give you a historical reference and point of view, and it
brings back a certain listening experience that you don't get from a
CD," says Rick Rubin, head of American Recordings and producer of the
Beastie Boys, Run-DMC, Johnny Cash, Tom Petty and other acts.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's necessarily a more desirable sound. It's like
the Technicolor film process. It doesn't look more realistic than the
color we have today, but it can be more beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   The very idea of getting nostalgic over vinyl noise strikes some
as akin to pining for the smoky exhaust of that 1964 Studebaker.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's kind of silly," says Glen Ballard, a Grammy-winning
producer, songwriter and arranger who has worked with Michael
Jackson, No Doubt, Christina Aguilera, Alanis Morissette and others.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's used as a special effect for some real purpose, I think
it's fine. But on evoking nostalgia, especially for a lot of
listeners who haven't played a vinyl record in their lives, it's sort
of two steps removed from any real-world connection."</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, look at record noise the way Andy Warhol viewed
soup cans -- as part of Americans' shared cultural vocabulary.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not considered just a sound effect any more," says
Spectrasonics' Persing. "The sounds that a record player makes have
really become part of the lexicon of musical sound."</TE>
<TE>   "It's similar to that 'Wizard of Oz' effect, where [the film]
starts out in black and white and becomes color. It elicits a certain
response of going back in time. Vinyl noise means that now, and it
has a certain cultural significance."</TE>

<HD>Arrests in France Raise Concern of Chemical Attack</HD>
<DH>Four people are held in seizure of unidentified liquid and
protective suit. Group is linked to London terror detainee.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>French police have arrested four suspected Islamic extremists in
possession of suspicious chemicals and a special anti-contamination
suit, authorities said Tuesday, worsening fears that Al Qaeda is
plotting a large-scale terrorist attack in Europe during the
holidays.</LD>
<LD>   Anti-terrorism police made the discovery Monday in an apartment
and a basement storage room of a housing project where they arrested
three Algerians and a Moroccan, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The raid in the heavily Muslim Paris suburb of La Courneuve was
part of a crackdown across France that has produced more than 20
arrests in recent weeks. The three men and one woman captured Monday
allegedly have ties to a suspect in an alleged plot in London
involving chemical products, according to Interior Minister Nicolas
Sarkozy.</LD>
<TE>   Police in the La Courneuve raid found "two 13-kilo [29-pound]
containers, empty, two vials of liquid that is now under analysis and
a military suit for nuclear, bacteriological and chemical
protection," Sarkozy told legislators Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Until technicians at a military laboratory identify the substances
seized in the raid, it is impossible to know whether the materials
are lethal.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the presence of the anti-contamination suit makes it more
likely that the suspects were experimenting with toxic products,
according to European law enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   Police identified only one of the four suspects, Mirwani ben
Ahmed, who had been wanted on charges related to a foiled plot to
bomb a cathedral in Strasbourg during the Christmas holidays in 2000.
Ben Ahmed, 29, is believed to have undergone training in the use of
chemical weapons, a French law enforcement official said.</TE>
<TE>   Sarkozy called the case "very serious." The interior minister said
the suspects "had spent time in Chechnya."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the London suspect, Rabah Kadre, Sarkozy said the men
and the woman "were in relation with ... Kadre, arrested [in
November] for planning an attack using chemical products."</TE>
<TE>   "With these four [suspects] here, it was better to arrest them
before rather than after," Sarkozy said. "When you find people with
this kind of material, there is no doubt that arresting them was the
right move."</TE>
<TE>   The fear of a massive terrorist attack extends beyond France into
Britain, Germany and Italy. European counter-terrorism officials
interviewed Tuesday said they were scrambling in response to a threat
that has escalated with the approach of the Christmas holidays, the
backdrop for past Al Qaeda attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Arrests in France and elsewhere have revealed that a cadre of
combat-hardened extremists has been returning to Europe from
Chechnya, where Muslim rebels are fighting Russian rule, and other
places where they took refuge after the U.S. military operation in
Afghanistan last year, according to investigators. The extremists
appear intent on carrying out the major strikes threatened against
Europe by Osama bin Laden and his associates, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   And persistent intelligence information has raised the specter of
a possible chemical attack, they added.</TE>
<TE>   "The French are very worried about a chemical attack," said a
counter-terrorism investigator in a neighboring European nation.
"Everybody is very worried. This is the fear. There is a strong fear
of a spectacular attack. And after Sept. 11, what could be
spectacular? A chemical attack."</TE>
<TE>   Sarkozy's comments about Kadre were significant because the
interior minister asserted that the London suspects arrested last
month had been involved in a plot to use chemical weapons. Kadre, the
alleged leader of a London-based network dominated by North Africans,
was arrested shortly after returning to the British capital from
Slovakia. British tabloids claimed that he was the lead man in an
imminent poison gas attack on the London subway, but British
authorities denied those reports.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors in Britain have not made public any evidence outlining
a specific plot. Kadre and two other suspects pleaded not guilty
Monday at a hearing in London.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, investigators in other countries have offered a
different picture. Although European investigators say no chemical
weapons were found in connection with the London plot, they say
suspicions linking the London suspects to an eventual chemical attack
were credible. In a rare interview published last week, the director
of France's lead counter-terrorism agency said there was intelligence
information about chemical weapons in the British case.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the British arrests last month resulted partly from
information passed on by French investigators, according to several
European sources.</TE>
<TE>   A crackdown here led by Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere, France's top
anti-terrorism magistrate, has taken aim at one of the most
violence-prone networks operating in Europe. Its alleged leader, an
Algerian named Abu Doha, is behind bars in Britain awaiting
extradition to the United States on charges that he masterminded an
attempt to bomb Los Angeles International Airport on the eve of
millennium celebrations in 1999. He has also been linked to the plot
involving the Strasbourg cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   The testimony of the convicted would-be bomber in the LAX plot, as
well as wiretaps in Italy, showed that members and associates of the
network allegedly led by Abu Doha had trained with crude poison gas
in Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan and discussed the use of chemical
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Kadre had assumed Abu Doha's role as a key figure in the network,
investigators say, and allegedly was at work reorganizing Al Qaeda in
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   A top Al Qaeda suspect said to be commanding a campaign targeting
Europe is Abu Musab Zarqawi, a Jordanian reputedly knowledgeable
about chemical warfare, according to German and Italian intelligence
officials.</TE>
<TE>   French authorities must now clarify whether the suspects arrested
Monday had the means and expertise to carry out a major attack. It is
reasonably difficult for terrorists to prepare and unleash chemical
weapons, especially harder-to-obtain agents such as VX, a nerve
agent.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the vials and the protective suit, police found
fraudulent identification papers and $5,000 in cash at the housing
project, authorities said.</TE>

<HD>State Budget Outlook Darkens as Deficit Nears $30 Billion</HD>
<DH>Davis is expected to announce new estimate today. Democrats
criticize proposed cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sharon Bernstein and Evan Halper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With leading California Democrats already complaining about proposed
cuts in state spending, Gov. Gray Davis is expected today to announce
new estimates of the government's anticipated shortfall that will put
the deficit at about $30 billion, a far worse fiscal crisis than is
already gripping the state's leadership.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the governor will announce that the state's deficit,
earlier pegged at $21 billion over the next 18 months, has ballooned
into "the high 20 billions," said Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean.
She said the new number is based on updated revenue projections that
will be released today. Others estimated that the shortfall would
exceed $27 billion and could even top $30 billion.</LD>
<LD>   McLean said that those figures will "lay out in stark relief the
challenge the entire state will face this year," and that Davis
stands behind his plan to start dealing with it.</LD>
<TE>   "The governor is dead serious, and we need the Legislature to get
on board," she said. "He has said from the outset this is extremely
painful."</TE>
<TE>   The predictions regarding the size of the state deficit have
steadily increased in recent months. Today's report is expected to
redouble pressure on Democrats to consider still deeper cuts in state
services and on Republicans to embrace some tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 6, Davis outlined cuts and savings intended to trim $10.2
billion over the coming 18 months; the new estimates could wipe out
the effect of most of those proposals in one revision, forcing the
administration to once again reexamine a range of proposed tax and
fee increases as well as cuts to state services as diverse as
education, health, welfare, transportation and prisons.</TE>
<TE>   McLean said Davis may still suggest new taxes when he releases his
proposal to balance next year's budget on Jan. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting at the Ronald Reagan State Building in Los Angeles, urban
Democrats used an Assembly hearing on Davis' proposed $2 billion in
cuts to medical services for the poor to signal their unwillingness
to support his plan. About 500,000 poor people would lose access to
medical care under the Davis package of cuts. Several leading
Democrats said they will not consider steep cuts in services until
tax hikes are on the table.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe that we would ask for sacrifices from those who
can't afford it, while asking nothing of those who can," said
Assemblywoman Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park), chairwoman of the Assembly
subcommittee that held Tuesday's hearing</TE>
<TE>   Though it is full of steep reductions in services, Davis' initial
package of cuts does not raise taxes. That is an omission that has
pleased Republicans but has not gone over well in the governor's
party.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have here is a crisis in leadership," said Sen. Gil
Cedillo (D-Los Angeles), who was among several legislators at the
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Cedillo criticized Davis for claiming throughout his recent
election campaign that California has the fifth-largest economy in
the world, while now suggesting that the state should fund public
services as if "it is an underdeveloped nation."</TE>
<TE>   The cuts were proposed by Davis earlier this month as part of his
plan to reduce the state budget gap by $10.2 billion. Davis
administration officials called the plan the governor's "opening
salvo" in dealing with California's shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles) told about 500
people packed into Tuesday's hearing room and spilling out into the
hall that "there is a big movement afoot" to reject the governor's
proposed cuts in medical assistance and education.</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing, Chu held up medical equipment that would no
longer be covered under the governor's proposed changes to the
medical plan.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a colostomy bag," Chu said, passing to other legislators
the clear plastic bag used by people who have had their colons
removed to collect fecal matter. "This is a catheter.... This is a
syringe used by diabetics."</TE>
<TE>   Chu and other Democrats have cited a number of potential new fees
and taxes that could offset much of the budget hole, including a "sin
tax" of 5 cents for each alcoholic drink sold in the state,
elimination of some business tax credits and an increase in vehicle
license fees.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, meanwhile, continue to warn against tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   At another Assembly hearing Tuesday in Sacramento, to assess the
governor's proposed $1.6 billion in cuts from state employee
compensation and government operations, Republican committee members
released a statement warning that tax hikes would "further devastate
the state's economy."</TE>
<TE>   "The proposals put forward by the governor are not pleasant by any
means, but they must be enacted if we are going to begin the process
of restoring fiscal responsibility," said Assemblyman Dave Cogdill
(R-Modesto). "We need to reduce our spending. Tax increases will not
solve the problem."</TE>
<TE>   McLean said the nonpartisan legislative analyst's office called
the Davis plan a "good start" in dealing with the fiscal problems.</TE>
<TE>   But that office also suggested in a report released Monday that
any plan to balance the budget should include raising taxes and fees
along with cuts. The report criticized the administration for having
"virtually no meaningful reductions" in the prison system.</TE>
<TE>   The union that represents state prison guards is one of the
biggest contributors to Davis and other lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) has said
that the criminal justice system will not be spared.</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's hearing in Sacramento, staff with the legislative
analyst's office said up to 7,000 state employees could lose their
jobs under the governor's plan. Or they could meet his goal of
cutting $470 million in employee compensation by taking a roughly 8%
salary cut.</TE>
<TE>   Several union officials said the cuts would cripple the ability of
various state departments to do their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   They warned of longer lines at the Department of Motor Vehicles,
private nursing homes not getting inspected, and battered women being
unable to get restraining orders against abusers.</TE>
<TE>   "The people of California will feel the cuts and be worse off
because of them," said Jim Hard, civil service division director of
the California State Employees Assn. "It's literally a matter of
health versus sickness, and even life and death, for many
Californians."</TE>
<TE>   Other union officials said they will not begin to reopen salary
and benefits negotiations until legislators stop contracting
engineering jobs out at a hefty cost to the state and sheltering
large corporations from state taxes.</TE>

<HD>Storming Capitol Hill: The Few, the Proud, the Politically
Wired</HD>
<DH>The Marine Corps, thanks to a tenacity honed on the
battlefield, sees its unique aerial fleet taking shape.</DH>
<SE>THE VERTICAL VISION / PART IV: CLOUT</SE>
<AU>Alan C. Miller and Kevin Sack</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>He was the best they had.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier in his career, the Marines had entrusted Lt. Col. Keith M.
Sweaney with the president's life: He flew the Marine One helicopter.</LD>
<LD>   Now, at 42, he was leading the team charged with evaluating the
V-22 Osprey, an experimental aircraft intended to replace Vietnam-era
helicopters. Next, he was to command the first tactical Osprey
squadron.</LD>
<TE>   All that meant little one night in December 2000 as Sweaney and a
crew of three practiced landings and approaches at a Marine base in
eastern North Carolina. After two hours of flight, the Osprey
suddenly dropped from the sky as the crew radioed for help: "Declare
emergency! We're going down! We're going down!"</TE>
<TE>   It had happened again.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1957, the Marines have nurtured the futuristic dream of
creating a flying force unrestricted by the availability of runways
and control towers. The hybrid aircraft would be like no other,
combining a helicopter's ability to lift off from small clearings and
an airplane's speed in blasting toward the battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   By delivering troops to the front in the Osprey and then
protecting them with combat planes that can be positioned nearby, the
Marines hope to make themselves an indispensable fighting force.</TE>
<TE>   But their first vertical-lift aircraft, the Harrier jump jet, has
never played a distinctive role in battle for the Marines during its
three-decade life span. And the Osprey, despite 13 years of testing
and the expenditure of $12.6 billion, is not close to seeing action.</TE>
<TE>   Their most notable records to date have been their exceptionally
high accident rates. Seventy-one Marines and four civilians have died
in noncombat crashes aboard the two aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Harrier training accidents have taken the lives of 45 Marines,
mostly one at a time. A single Osprey crash in Arizona killed 19
Marines just eight months before Sweaney and his crew perished.</TE>
<TE>   The Osprey crashes shocked the public. But to those familiar with
the corps' aviation program, they represented merely the latest
sacrifice in the Marine Corps' single-minded half-century quest to
build an all-vertical air fleet.</TE>
<TE>   It is a dream they may be on the verge of achieving.</TE>
<TE>   The Osprey is moving persistently forward despite skepticism
at high levels; the Harrier is expected to fly for another 13 to 17
years, and the Marines have been promised a Harrier successor that
will extend their vision into the mid-21st century.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes as planned, the Marines will receive their own special
version of the next-generation Joint Strike Fighter, which is now in
development. The Air Force and Navy also will get the supersonic jet,
but only the Marines have ordered a model that can lift off after a
short roll and land vertically.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines have pulled off this feat by showing the same tenacity
in the political trenches that they bring to the battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   Though they are the smallest of the four military services, or
perhaps because they are, the Marines are unparalleled at working
their way in Washington, having outlasted adversaries in Democratic
and Republican administrations alike.</TE>
<TE>   Political Can-Do</TE>
<TE>   Their strategy comes straight from the Pentagon's procurement
playbook: Sell a weapon as a lifesaving necessity, build broad
coalitions of self-interested constituencies, and then, once
victorious, immediately begin pushing for its successor.</TE>
<TE>   But the Marines add the aura of "the few, the proud" to the
formula:</TE>
<TE>   * They exploit the Pentagon's dissemination of design and
construction contracts around the country to broaden their political
base. They seek the support of lawmakers in districts where aircraft
parts are made and where the Marines are major employers.</TE>
<TE>   * They build alliances with defense contractors, who make
substantial campaign contributions to influential lawmakers and
retain retired Marine generals for their access and expertise.</TE>
<TE>   * They plead for new aircraft by highlighting the hazards of their
aging fleet, particularly helicopters that have had their own serious
safety problems. But they refuse Pentagon offers of existing aircraft
or other substitutes that might undercut their prospects for building
an all-vertical force.</TE>
<TE>   * They appeal to former Marines and Marine reservists sitting in
Congress. The dictum "once a Marine, always a Marine" means something
on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   * They play their spit-and-polish image for every vote. Addressing
lawmakers, the commandant may call the Marines "your corps." A
lawmaker who raises a concern with one of the Marines' legislative
aides may find the commandant at the door that very day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the mystique, much of which is well earned," said Lawrence
J. Korb, a former Pentagon official now at the Council on Foreign
Relations. "The Marines are not just another military service.
They're seen as something special."</TE>
<TE>   A showdown over the Osprey in the late 1980s illustrates their
mastery. Blocked at the Pentagon, they joined forces with allies in
Congress. Opposed there by the key committee chairman, they
outflanked him on his own turf.</TE>
<TE>   In a time of tightening defense budgets, the aircraft was opposed
as too costly by both Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, a Republican,
and Les Aspin, Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee. Normally, that kind of alliance would be insurmountable.
But just before the key vote, the Marines' legislative affairs
officer told Aspin that he was about to lose in his own committee.
Aspin didn't budge. As forewarned, he was defeated in a tie vote that
effectively saved the Osprey.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Osprey's future is again uncertain. The
military's chief procurement officer has questioned whether the plane will
ever be safe enough for use in combat. Yet the Marines remain resilient.
Not only are they counting on getting the Osprey, they say they plan
to pursue as many as three more hybrid aircraft to take the place of
their attack helicopters, transport planes and unmanned drones.</TE>
<TE>   A vertical fleet would provide the United States with an important
edge in war, they say, arguing that their opponents underestimate the
military challenges ahead. The high accident rates, they say, have
been the price of technological progress, but now the dark days are
behind them.</TE>
<TE>   "We have learned lessons well," said Lt. Gen. Michael A.
Hough, the chief of Marine aviation and a former director of the Joint
Strike Fighter program.</TE>
<TE>   But experience with the Harrier and Osprey raises
natural questions about the aircraft of the future. Can they ever be as
safe as conventional planes? Do the benefits justify the costs?</TE>
<TE>   "The Marines have a fabulous can-do attitude," said Philip E.
Coyle, the Pentagon's chief of weapons testing and evaluation from
1994 to 2001. "But sometimes the technology you're dealing with is so
complex that no amount of can-do attitude can overcome the technical
difficulties."</TE>
<TE>   The Harrier</TE>
<TE>   Procurement, it might seem, would be an executive branch game. The
Pentagon decides which weapons it wants and, along with the White
House, how to prioritize them.</TE>
<TE>   But Congress wields the power of the purse, and as the Harrier's
history illustrates, the Marines have become particularly adept at
maneuvering past the Pentagon's civilian leaders to keep the money
flowing.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how many times the program was, quote-unquote,
'canceled,' " said Vince L. Higbee, Harrier program manager for
Boeing Co., which makes the airframe. "It really was reliant on
members of Congress to keep it alive."</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, the Marines were sensitive to how Congress --
and U.S. defense contractors -- would react to the purchase of
warplanes made in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   Marine Col. Thomas H. Miller and another pilot first tested the
Harrier in secret in 1968. Shortly thereafter, Miller was dispatched
to St. Louis to see James Smith McDonnell, chairman of McDonnell
Douglas, the maker of Marine F-4 Phantoms. The Marines wanted to buy
fewer F-4s to free money for the first Harriers.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said he told McDonnell that the Marines would strive to
bring production of the Harrier home to the U.S., suggesting that
McDonnell Douglas would be rewarded tomorrow for a show of
selflessness today. McDonnell went along and several years later the
company became the domestic manufacturer of a new Harrier model.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after receiving the Harrier, the Marines declared that it
had launched them toward an all-vertical air program. But the plane
began crashing so often that it earned the nickname "the
Widow-Maker."</TE>
<TE>   Confronting concern in Congress, the Marines devised a tactic. The
Harrier's safety record, they argued, should not be judged by the
accepted military standard: accidents per 100,000 flight hours.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they said the jet should be measured by its accidents per
mission. Because the plane typically flew large numbers of relatively
brief sorties, this had the effect of making the Harrier appear
safer.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said this seemed to work with Sen. William
Proxmire (D-Wis.), a watchdog on government waste who was so concerned
about the Harrier's accident rate that he raised the possibility of
canceling it.</TE>
<TE>   "We explained this business of accident rate versus sortie versus
hours flown," Miller said. "We never heard any more from him."</TE>
<TE>   Retired Lt. Gen. Charles H. Pitman, who headed Marine aviation
from 1988 to 1990, remembered thinking the tactic was clever but
disingenuous. "The fact that you're getting a lot of sorties in
before you lose one doesn't make me feel any better," he said. "But,
you know, we were defending the concept."</TE>
<TE>   While fighting for the new model of the Harrier, the Marines
rejected a Pentagon proposal to purchase additional A-4 Skyhawk
attack jets for the corps. Doing so would have kept the A-4
production line open in case the Harrier faltered.</TE>
<TE>   End Run</TE>
<TE>   The AV-8A Harrier was not airborne for long when the Marines began
lobbying for its replacement, now using its high crash rate to their
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   They argued that an upgraded model would dramatically improve the
plane's safety as well as its combat performance. The Ford
administration gave them the nod in 1976 to develop the AV-8B.</TE>
<TE>   But when Jimmy Carter took office, his Defense Secretary, Harold
Brown, sought to block the purchase of the AV-8B, citing safety
concerns and skepticism about its benefits in battle.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines didn't help themselves when they tried to impress
Carter administration officials with a Harrier bombing demonstration
off the Navy carrier Saratoga in July 1977. Before their eyes, an
AV-8A piloted by Capt. Timothy C. Krepps, 30, slammed into the
Atlantic.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a horrific sort of thing," recalled Budget Director Bert
Lance. "It was out on the horizon. You could see him disappear." (An
investigation determined that Krepps, who died in the crash, had
become disoriented.)</TE>
<TE>   The Marines persisted, working hard on Capitol Hill to impress
lawmakers with the invaluable role the Harrier might play in a
variety of theoretical combat scenarios.</TE>
<TE>   "We found the Marines would make up missions faster than we could
shoot them down," said Robert A. Speir, a former tactical air analyst
at the Pentagon who wrote classified reports recommending termination
of the Harrier program.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines also pointed out that "parts of the Harrier are built
in a lot of states," Pitman said. "We made sure of that."</TE>
<TE>   They got help from the British government, which encouraged the
U.S. to invest in the Harrier, with its Rolls-Royce engine and other
English-made components.</TE>
<TE>   And the corps appealed to the 35 former Marines and reservists in
Congress at that time, including members of the key Appropriations
and Armed Services committees. Among the lawmakers was Sen. John
Glenn (D-Ohio), the former astronaut and Marine aviator.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn, now retired, is so close to his ex-Marine training squadron
colleague, Thomas Miller, who rose to the rank of lieutenant general,
that the two families jointly own a 63-foot boat on the Potomac named
"SENIRAM II," which spelled backward means "two Marines."</TE>
<TE>   Glenn, who took a flight in an early Harrier trainer, said he
fought for the plane because he believed in its mission. "It really
makes a better combat capability for the Marine Corps because of its
ability to go in and operate behind the lines," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though Brown refused to fund the purchase of the AV-8B, he allowed
development to proceed. That kept the program alive until Carter was
replaced in 1981 by Ronald Reagan, who advocated a rapid defense
buildup. The Marines then won approval to buy 283 AV-8Bs for $8.2
billion.</TE>
<TE>   As the acquisition program wound down, they again ran into
opposition, this time from one of their own, Pitman. While Pitman was
a true believer in the Marine's vertical vision, he had grown
concerned about the Harrier's safety. As head of Marine aviation in
the late 1980s, he fought the purchase of some of the last of the
AV-8Bs.</TE>
<TE>   "We were still having a lot of the troubles that we had before,"
Pitman recalled, "and we were losing an inordinate amount of aircraft
through mechanical problems and we were also losing some pilots. We
actually stopped the program for a short period."</TE>
<TE>   After Pitman's retirement, the Marines won approval in 1992 to
replace five AV-8Bs lost in combat and one in training during the
Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   As they have fought for the Harrier over the years, the Marines
have tried to buff the plane's reputation, sometimes embellishing its
accomplishments in battle.</TE>
<TE>   After the Gulf War, then-Commandant Alfred M. Gray Jr. told the
Senate Armed Services Committee that "we would not have won the
victory that we did in our sector without that magnificent close-air
support" for ground troops provided by Harriers.</TE>
<TE>   But most Harrier bombing missions took place when there were no
U.S. ground troops in combat to support, according to a prominent
study of the air war. During the four-day ground war, the Marines
themselves determined that only 14% of all AV-8B sorties qualified as
close air support.</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, when pushing for the Marine version of the Joint
Strike Fighter, Brig. Gen. Robert Magnus told Congress the AV-8Bs had
operated during Desert Storm from "an expeditionary airfield located
in a soccer stadium at Jubail, Saudi Arabia" -- implying that the
plane had used its vertical ability to fly in and out. This claim has
been repeated by numerous Marine generals.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, the planes based in Jubail flew off a runway a half a
mile from the soccer stadium, according to several Marine commanders
who were there.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the corps' salesmanship has succeeded, establishing
Marine aviation as a unique fighting force that required unique
aircraft. On the Hill and in the Pentagon, that principle has become
gospel.</TE>
<TE>   The Osprey</TE>
<TE>   Parts of the Osprey are manufactured in more than 40 states and in
hundreds of congressional districts. The fuel tanks are made in
northwest Georgia. The engine casings come from Missouri, the engine
starters from North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Therein lies the foundation of a political alliance, formally
known as the Tilt-Rotor Technology Coalition. It has fought
tenaciously, both in the late 1980s and again in the last two years,
to defend the revolutionary aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The ungainly Osprey lifts off like a helicopter using a pair of
rotors that then tilt forward so the aircraft can cruise at high
speeds and altitudes like a propeller-driven plane. With the fuselage
of a traditional transport plane, the Marines say it can carry up to
24 fully equipped troops.</TE>
<TE>   The corps says it wants the Osprey badly because it can fly much
faster and farther and haul more troops than helicopters. But from
the beginning, there have been questions about safety and cost.</TE>
<TE>   After his first defeat by the Osprey lobby, then-Defense Secretary
Cheney did not retreat. Year after year in the first Bush
administration, he tried to kill the program. Each time, Congress
rode to the rescue. Leading the charge was Rep. Curt Weldon, a
Republican from the Philadelphia suburbs and a member of the Armed
Services Committee. His coalition attracted 110 House members and 15
senators.</TE>
<TE>   Weldon sold the plane for its unique abilities. But he had 600
other reasons to support it: the workers at the Boeing plant in his
county where the fuselage would be made.</TE>
<TE>   He stitched together a patchwork of the aircraft's constituents:
lawmakers from Pennsylvania, Texas and other states where components
were to be made; the United Auto Workers, which had thousands of jobs
at stake; the contractors, with campaign funds to deploy; and even
corporate patrons like Donald Trump who were tantalized by the
Osprey's potential commercial use for short-hop commutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines were there too, though discreetly, given that the
secretary of Defense had lined up on the other side. They offered
firm encouragement but treaded very carefully, Weldon said at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   There were letter-writing campaigns and full-page ads and
newsletters and fund-raising receptions. A lobbying day in 1990 --
"Tilt-Rotor Appreciation Day" -- featured an Osprey, painted red,
white and blue, hovering over the U.S. Capitol steps as lawmakers
cheered.</TE>
<TE>   The corps got help from friends like Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.),
a former Marine drill instructor and by then the chairman of the
Defense Appropriations subcommittee. He stressed both the Osprey's
tactical flexibility and its civilian utility.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines hope to eventually buy 360 Ospreys. If it's proven
safe, the Navy and Air Force are to get a total of 98 more. The price
per aircraft, which has escalated rapidly, is estimated at $68.4
million. The total cost of the program is expected to reach $46
billion.</TE>
<TE>   More Crashes</TE>
<TE>   As with the Harrier, victory on the Hill was soon followed by
disasters in the air.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, two Marines were injured when an Osprey prototype crashed
three minutes into one of its first flights. The cause was identified
as wiring problems in the flight instruments.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1992, an Osprey plunged into the Potomac River while
approaching a base in Quantico, Va. The crash, caused by an engine
fire, killed all seven on board -- three Marine crew members and four
Boeing employees.</TE>
<TE>   History seemed to be repeating itself. Like the Harrier, the
Osprey was proving to be low in reliability, high in maintenance and
tricky to handle when moving from horizontal to vertical flight.</TE>
<TE>   But the Osprey's safety problems did not become a political issue
until the two crashes in 2000 drew widespread attention.</TE>
<TE>   The Arizona crash in April 2000 killed four crew members and 15
other Marines who had been loaded onto the Osprey for an evacuation
training exercise. It was one of the deadliest military disasters in
years, and some questioned why the corps would put so many Marines on
an aircraft still in testing.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not considered a risk," said Capt. Joseph Kloppel, a corps
spokesman. The Marines had carried troops in the Osprey safely many
times before the crash, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we hadn't lost so many Marines in that accident, the overall
impact ... would not have been as severe," said Pitman, an Osprey
proponent who has advised Bell Helicopter, one of the manufacturing
partners.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the primary cause of the accident was that the
pilot had exceeded the recommended rate of descent, creating a sharp
updraft of turbulence that caused one of the rotors to lose lift. Any
helicopter can encounter this phenomenon, known as vortex ring state,
but some aviation experts say the Osprey's design makes recovery more
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   To save time and money, tests that would have provided more
information about vortex ring state had been canceled, postponed or
conducted in flight simulators rather than on the aircraft itself,
the General Accounting Office discovered after the crash. The agency
said the Osprey was "far less reliable" than it needed to be for
active service.</TE>
<TE>   Retired Marine Col. Nolan Schmidt, who managed the Osprey
program at the time, said the corps believed the aircraft was safe despite
the lack of testing.</TE>
<TE>   The December 2000 crash that killed Sweaney and three others
prompted the Osprey's grounding just as the Pentagon was about to
decide on whether to proceed with full production.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said the accident was caused by a combination of a
failed hydraulic line and a software glitch. The Marines had been
told about the hydraulic design flaw months earlier. Investigators
later said the software problem could have been detected with more
rigorous testing.</TE>
<TE>   Things only got worse when the Pentagon's inspector general
reported in July 2001 that the V-22 squadron at New River, N.C., had
falsified maintenance and readiness records in an effort to improve
the Osprey's image. Three officers were disciplined.</TE>
<TE>   With the Osprey program now hovering precariously, Weldon revived
the tilt-rotor coalition, while the Marines declared their allegiance
to the plane.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that there's any other aircraft out there anywhere
for the money that would do the mission for the Marine Corps," said
Lt. Gen. Fred McCorkle, then head of Marine aviation.</TE>
<TE>   A special panel appointed by the Defense secretary studied the
Osprey and reported last year that the aircraft is still viable and
that its problems can be solved through better pilot training and
modest redesigns of its hydraulic and computer systems.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the things that were wrong with this airplane have been
fixed," Marine Col. Dan Schultz, the current V-22 program manager,
said when the upgraded aircraft resumed testing in May.</TE>
<TE>   Schultz said the highly scrutinized flight test program will spend
up to a year defining where vortex ring state begins and ends and
developing warnings for pilots. He said the Marines intend to prove
that the V-22 is less susceptible to this condition than helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   But after two decades in development, Defense Undersecretary
Edward C. "Pete" Aldridge Jr., the Pentagon's top acquisition
official, said in August that he remained doubtful the Osprey could
overcome inherent design and engineering challenges and demonstrate
its readiness for battle.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm probably the most skeptical person in the Department of
Defense," Aldridge said. "I've got some real problems with the
airplane."</TE>
<TE>   Joint Strike Fighter</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon faced a looming crisis in the early 1990s: where to
find money to replace an array of aging combat jets.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force and Navy each were seeking budget-busting fighter
planes. The Marines, meanwhile, were pursuing a next-generation
attack jet that, like its predecessor, would fly vertically.</TE>
<TE>   "I was convinced that the Congress was not going to allow the
Marine Corps to build an airplane just for itself," said retired Lt.
Gen. Harold W. Blot, who served as chief of Marine aviation in the
mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Marines got a break.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration's solution was to create an affordable
plane with common features that could be tailored to the needs of the
Air Force, Navy and Marines, as well as U.S. allies. The Navy and Air
Force were lukewarm to the idea, at best. For the Marines,
participation hung on one condition: Like the Harrier, their new
plane had to be short-takeoff-and-vertical-landing, or STOVL
(pronounced STO-vul).</TE>
<TE>   When the Pentagon agreed to the new Joint Strike Fighter, the
Marines emerged as its most ardent advocate.</TE>
<TE>   Their vertical model also enticed the British and other foreign
partners. England committed $2 billion to the program as an
international sponsor, reinforcing the administration's cost-saving
initiative.</TE>
<TE>   After surviving hard-fought challenges to the Osprey and Harrier,
the Marines got the go-ahead for their third vertical aircraft
without so much as a skirmish.</TE>
<TE>   "The Marines were steadfast in wanting it," said former Assistant
Defense Secretary Ted Warner. "Nobody was challenging it."</TE>
<TE>   Once the Marine imperative to buy STOVL aircraft was established
in the battle for the AV-8B, the opposition grew muted, said another
former defense official.</TE>
<TE>   "People did not want to re-fight those old battles," the official
said. "It was more a matter of we have these and we've got to replace
them."</TE>
<TE>   What remains uncertain, though, is how many of the vertical strike
fighters the Marines will get and whether they will be able to fly
them from Navy aircraft carriers.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy and Marines have agreed to closely coordinate their
aviation programs. But they haven't agreed on whether the Marines
should fly their own or the Navy's version of the strike fighter off
the carriers.</TE>
<TE>   If there were concerns about the strike fighter's vertical
technology, the Marines say, the manufacturer, Lockheed Martin Corp.,
assuaged them last year in a dramatic demonstration of an innovative
new propulsion system.</TE>
<TE>   A strike fighter prototype lifted off the tarmac in the Mojave
Desert and hovered briefly, proving the system could work.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed's design uses a large fan in the fuselage to augment the
engine, and the combination is expected to produce nearly twice the
thrust of the Harrier with less stress on the engine. The fan's
thrust won't generate heat like the engine does, which can burn up
ship decks or airstrips while landing and taking off.</TE>
<TE>   With its trapezoidal wings, twin tail and sleek frame, the
single-seat attack jet will carry more bombs and travel greater
distances without refueling than the AV-8B.</TE>
<TE>   It is being designed to fly at supersonic speeds and to
evade radar. Its sophisticated computer software and avionics should make
it easier to handle. It will have the latest sensors to detect
problems in flight.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Marines alone will fly the vertical version of the
Joint Strike Fighter, officials say it will have enough in common
with the other models to avoid the scarcity of spare parts and tools
that hampered the sole-service Harrier.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines say their $48-million strike fighter will allow
them to fly off short-deck ships and out of small, remote landing strips,
at least tripling the number of bases available to them worldwide.
The plane is expected to remain in service until mid-century.</TE>
<TE>   But as with the Harrier, the Marines will make trade-offs in
performance for the strike fighter's unique abilities.</TE>
<TE>   The lift fan will take up fuel storage space and add weight, which
will reduce the distance the Marine version can fly or how many bombs
it can carry on a given mission.</TE>
<TE>   While the Marine strike fighter is expected to be safer than the
AV-8B, some say it is likely to be more accident-prone than the Navy
and Air Force models.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Bolkcom, a military aviation analyst with the
Congressional Research Service, said the new propulsion system is far
more complicated than the Harrier's, so there is more that could go
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Other defense analysts say the plane's intended role in battle is
increasingly being carried out by laser-guided bombs, unmanned drones
and combat planes that loiter over the battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pursuing the STOVL version of the Joint Strike Fighter
because the Marines want it," said Daniel Goure, a former Pentagon
official and now vice president of the Lexington Institute think tank
of Arlington, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "That is distinct from whether they actually need it."</TE>
<TE>   The fear, of course, is that a new generation of vertical aircraft
could lead to a new generation of casualties.</TE>
<TE>   With the Joint Strike Fighter in early development and other
vertical aircraft only being contemplated, it is too soon to know.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines say their decision to seek their own special air wing
will one day be vindicated.</TE>
<TE>   They say their strike fighter will fulfill the
Harrier's potential, and the Osprey will rise above its early missteps and
prove itself invaluable.</TE>
<TE>   There will be times when the United States will need vertical
aircraft to move troops and protect them on unforeseen battle fronts.</TE>
<TE>   And then, Marine leaders say, the investment -- in lives, in
dollars, in political capital -- will pay off.</TE>
<TE>   Marine Commandant James L. Jones earlier this year predicted that
the "best days are still ahead" for vertical aviation. Others
question whether its day will ever come.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dream that's been around a long, long time," said Franklin
C. "Chuck" Spinney, a tactical air analyst in the Pentagon, "that's
never delivered on its promise."</TE>

<HD>Lott Says He Will Stay as Leader</HD>
<DH>Many see the Senate party chief's hold weakening. President
to keep out of the fray.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson and James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Beleaguered Senate Republican leader Trent Lott
insisted Tuesday that he would hang onto his job despite a growing
belief among many Republicans in the capital that his grip on power
is weakening.</LD>
<LD>   With Lott facing a crisis of confidence within his party that will
come to a head on or before Jan. 6, President Bush maintained a
determined silence on the question of who will spearhead his agenda
for the next two years in the Senate, which is returning to
Republican control.</LD>
<LD>   The president, at a White House event, waved off a question about
the Mississippi senator. And Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said
the president would not get involved in the simmering Senate
leadership fight.</LD>
<TE>   Lott is fighting for survival as party leader in the Senate, a
position he has held for the last six years, in the aftermath of a
comment he made Dec. 5 at a birthday party for centenarian Sen. Strom
Thurmond (R-S.C.). Lott praised Thurmond's run for the presidency in
1948 and said the nation would have been better off had he been
elected.</TE>
<TE>   The remark was widely interpreted as a tacit endorsement of the
policy of racial segregation Thurmond advocated at the time.
Initially, Lott sought to let the controversy blow over without
comment. Then he said he had been misunderstood.</TE>
<TE>   He has since issued a series of increasingly fervent apologies,
the latest Monday night in an interview on Black Entertainment
Television. But the apologies have been undermined by revelations
concerning Lott's past associations with advocates of segregation,
his previous comments praising Thurmond's presidential run, and his
record in Congress of opposing an array of civil rights measures.</TE>
<TE>   For a White House known for intervening in important political
contests, the refusal to back Lott as the furor has grown is telling.
On Dec. 10, Fleischer told reporters that Bush "unquestionably" had
confidence in Lott's leadership.</TE>
<TE>   But on Tuesday, one week later, Fleischer said only that Bush
"views Sen. Lott as a friend. The president has respect for all
senators, including Sen. Lott."</TE>
<TE>   How many of the 50 Republicans who will serve in the Senate with
Lott next year still respect his leadership abilities remains to be
seen. His support appears to be ebbing daily.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), who took office in November after
capturing a Democratic-held seat, broke his silence on the
controversy Tuesday. "There is now a substantial question as to
whether Sen. Lott has the capacity to move" the GOP agenda in the new
Congress, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lott, however, received renewed pledges of support from some
prominent Republicans on Tuesday. Among them were Sen. Ted Stevens of
Alaska -- incoming chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who
after Thurmond is the most senior GOP senator -- and Sen. Rick
Santorum of Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm frankly confident that Sen. Lott will continue to be the
majority leader," said Santorum, who as chairman of the Republican
conference is the party's third-ranking Senate leader. "I have very
little doubt about that."</TE>
<TE>   Others weighing in strongly for Lott in recent days have included
Sens. Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, incoming chairman of the Banking
Committee; Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, incoming chairman of the
Health and Education committee; and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the
newly elected incoming majority whip.</TE>
<TE>   But many GOP senators have maintained a strict -- and for Lott,
perilous -- neutrality.</TE>
<TE>   "This matter has gone beyond the statement of a single individual
to one of national importance, and unfortunately divisiveness and
turmoil," Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said. "As such, this situation
should be and very well may be resolved prior [to] Jan. 6."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.), a longtime Lott rival and the outgoing
assistant GOP leader, has called Lott a weakened leader who could be
replaced. Many congressional aides and other well-positioned
Republicans in Washington, speaking privately Tuesday, believe that
Lott can and should be replaced -- preferably before the leadership
meeting scheduled for Jan. 6. In that meeting, Lott faces a possible
vote of no confidence. Votes for a new leader could also be taken --
all by secret ballot.</TE>
<TE>   For some Republicans, the leadership fight is complicated by the
narrow division of the Senate. Republicans will hold 51 of the
chamber's 100 seats when Congress convenes Jan. 7. Should Lott step
aside as majority leader, he could opt to keep his seat.</TE>
<TE>   But he also could resign from the Senate. In that case,
Mississippi Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, a Democrat, would be able to fill
the vacancy with a temporary appointment. If Lott resigns before Jan.
1, under state law, a special election could be called soon
afterward. But if he resigns after Jan. 1, a Musgrove appointment
would last until a special election that would be held later in the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Lott, 61, brushed aside all such speculation. On Tuesday, in a
brief interview with ABC-TV's "World News Tonight" in his hometown of
Pascagoula, Miss., he said he understood he had caused difficulty for
his peers.</TE>
<TE>   "But they need to think through the job I have done in the past,"
Lott said. "They know my heart and who I really am. They know what I
have done behind the scenes to try to make the agenda move, including
some legislation of interest to minorities and African Americans in
particular. They know all of that."</TE>
<TE>   Lott predicted that he would prevail: "I have had to fight all of
my life," he said, "and I am not stopping now."</TE>

<HD>Bush: Missile Defense by 2004</HD>
<DH>Vandenberg air base along with Alaska would be sites for
test system. Critics say there are reliability issues that need to be
resolved first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Tuesday ordered the Pentagon to
deploy a rudimentary missile defense system as early as 2004, placing
interceptor missiles in Alaska and, in a surprise move, also at
Vandenberg Air Force Base in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   "The new strategic challenges of the 21st century require us to
think differently, but they also require us to act," Bush said in a
statement. "The deployment of missile defenses is an essential
element of our broader efforts to transform our defense and
deterrence policies and capabilities to meet the new threats we
face."</LD>
<LD>   Critics in Congress and the scientific community denounced the
move as an effort to put a missile defense system in place despite
unresolved questions about its purpose and reliability.</LD>
<TE>   Administration officials denied that the decision to deploy a
missile defense system while it was still in the testing phase was in
reaction to North Korea's announcement last week that it would resume
its nuclear program. But when pressed, officials acknowledged that
one intention of the early deployment was to deter attacks from
potential enemies.</TE>
<TE>   "We do think that missile defense capabilities can have a powerful
impact on those countries that might threaten us," said J. D. Crouch,
assistant secretary of Defense for international security policy.
"They have a deterrent effect, and we hope they have a dissuasive
effect."</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials said they would request additional funding of
$1.5 billion over two years to pay for the deployment -- a request
that Congress is expected to approve. That would be in addition to
the $8 billion the Pentagon receives annually for its missile defense
program.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said that theoretically, all
50 states would be protected by the preliminary system, but that its
limited size and uncertain reliability would mean it could offer only
"modest" protection. Still, he said, something is better than
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be in a testing and learning mode," Rumsfeld told
reporters. "But also, in the event it were needed, it would be able
to provide you some limited capability to deal with a limited number
of ballistic missiles."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said the deployment would proceed despite
less-than-perfect flight test results. Of eight tests to date, only
five have been successful. The most recent flight test of an
interceptor missile failed about a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to put something in place and get knowledge about it and
have experience with it, and then add to it over time," Rumsfeld
said. "I mean, there isn't a single weapon system we have that hasn't
gotten better successively over a period of time that I can think
of."</TE>
<TE>   "Test, fix. Test, fix. Test, fix is what we're doing," said Lt.
Gen. Ronald Kadish, director of the missile defense program.</TE>
<TE>   The interceptors consist of booster rockets that release a "kill
vehicle" -- a device less than 5 feet long and weighing only about
120 pounds -- which uses sophisticated sensors to home in on enemy
missiles or warheads, destroying them with the force of a collision.</TE>
<TE>   During his election campaign, Bush pledged to accelerate the
testing and deployment of a missile defense system. Last June, the
United States abrogated the ABM treaty with Russia, which had
restricted testing, in order to accelerate development of a missile
defense system.</TE>
<TE>   But technical difficulties have slowed progress. The Clinton
administration had called for placing as many as 20 interceptors in
Alaska or South Dakota by 2004. The Bush administration did not adopt
that timetable, and instead had announced only that the United States
would build a "test bed" of five interceptors at Ft. Greely, near
Fairbanks, Alaska, in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The president's new order instead doubles the 2004 deployment to
10 missiles -- six at Ft. Greely and four at Vandenberg. In 2005, an
additional 10 missiles would be installed in Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon would continue the deployment of upgraded Patriot
systems to protect against shorter-range missiles, and would place up
to 20 interceptors on specially outfitted Aegis naval cruisers. Those
cruisers could be deployed worldwide, providing protection to allies,
the Pentagon said.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time any administration has publicly considered
placement of missile defenses in California. A Pentagon official said
Vandenberg was chosen because it is already a missile base with
testing facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "There is already infrastructure there, so it is a logical place
to put them in the continental United States," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents denounced the deployment as providing a false sense of
security. "If putting in a system is going to prevent you from taking
real steps to protect against missiles and proliferation, then this
is worse than nothing," said Lisbeth Gronlund of the Union of
Concerned Scientists.</TE>
<TE>   At a briefing, Pentagon officials played video of missile defense
tests in an effort to demonstrate that the technology is workable, if
primitive.</TE>
<TE>   "What we do know is that our fundamental technology of hit-to-kill
-- collision of the interceptor with the warheads that completely
destroys the warheads -- works, whereas a few years ago, I would not
tell you that with any confidence," Kadish said.</TE>
<TE>   But the test results are less impressive than the Pentagon
suggests, critics say, noting that the hit-to-kill technology has
been reasonably well-developed for several years.</TE>
<TE>   What the proposed system lacks is a booster rocket to carry the
interceptors, and a ground- and space-based sensor system to track
missile trajectories and distinguish decoys from warheads.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither the interceptor nor the radar to be used with the new
national missile defense system have ever been tested against any
ballistic missile target at all," said Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.),
outgoing chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</TE>
<TE>   In part to compensate for the needed sensor system, the Pentagon
has asked Britain and Denmark to upgrade radar installations on their
territories.</TE>
<TE>   James Lindsay, a missile defense expert with the Brookings
Institution in Washington, said it would be wrong to see the
confrontation with North Korea as the impetus behind the
administration's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "This announcement was not driven by North Korea. This was a train
that had left the station long ago," Lindsay said, recalling Bush's
campaign pledge.</TE>
<TE>   "What I would say is that for the administration, making this
decision might have the added bonus of convincing North Korea not to
go down the missile road."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he said, a central reason the administration wants to
install even an imperfect system in the next two years is that once
any kind of a system is up and running, it will be very hard to
dismantle it.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you deploy a system, you've really stuck a stake in the
ground and it makes it very hard for a new administration to undo it.
This is irreversible."</TE>

<HD>Uncertainty on Bush Cure for Economy</HD>
<DH>President still popular, but public sees spending for
schools, roads more vital than tax cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush remains highly popular, but Americans are skeptical
about key elements of his economic agenda, the Los Angeles Times Poll
has found.</LD>
<LD>   Buoyed by widespread approval of his performance in the war
against terrorism, Bush continues to receive positive job approval
ratings from more than three-fifths of Americans -- including an
almost unprecedented 97% of Republicans.</LD>
<LD>   But Americans remain unhappy with the economy and uncertain about
the remedies Bush has proposed to revive it, the survey found.</LD>
<TE>   Most Americans say they believe an economic agenda focused on
rebuilding schools, bridges and roads would be more effective at
reviving the economy than further tax cuts, as the administration is
preparing to propose. And an overwhelming majority says it would
cancel the further reductions in income tax rates Bush pushed through
Congress last year if the cuts would require Washington to dip into
money raised for Social Security to fund other government operations,
as congressional projections show.</TE>
<TE>   Across the board, the survey finds Bush in a strong but slightly
weaker position than the last Times poll in August, with sharp
partisan differences persisting over his performance.</TE>
<TE>   In all, a solid 63% of Americans say they approve of Bush's job
performance, down from 68% last summer.</TE>
<TE>   The new results suggest that although Bush approaches 2003 with
significant support -- just more than half of those registered to
vote saying they are now inclined to support him for reelection --
the continued anxiety over the economy could pose a long-term threat
to his standing.</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll, supervised by polling director Susan Pinkus,
surveyed 1,305 adults nationwide from Dec. 12 through 15; it has a
margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   No Improvement</TE>
<TE>   In the new poll, attitudes about the economy and the country's
direction failed to improve from the assessments in August, and in
some instances deteriorated.</TE>
<TE>   In August, for instance, 54% of Americans said the economy was
doing well, compared to 45% who said it was performing badly. In the
new survey, those numbers reversed: 55% now think the economy is
doing badly, while just 45% believe it is performing well. The share
of Americans who think the economy is performing "very badly" jumped
from one-in-eight in August to almost one-in-five today.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, four-in-10 Americans say they will spend less than
usual at Christmas this year, up significantly from the 26% in a poll
taken before last year's Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   In a follow-up interview, Jo Ann Nelson, a retired community
college teacher in Kansas City, Kan., was typical of those concerned
about the economy. She wonders how families afford the high cost of
groceries she sees when she shops, and she worries about local
layoffs and the rising national rate of unemployment. "For other
countries, 6% [unemployment] sounds wonderful, but for us I don't
think it's great," she said.</TE>
<TE>   On other measures, little has changed. Three-fifths of those
polled say the economy is in recession, almost exactly the same as in
August. Only about four-in-10 believe the economy will improve in the
next six months, again almost unchanged since August.</TE>
<TE>   When asked who they blame for the economy's performance, Americans
divide among three principal culprits -- with the verdicts heavily
shaped by partisan and ideological attitudes. Overall, 22% fingered
Bush, 21% corporate fraud and 13% the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
(Although the economy slipped into recession during President
Clinton's final months in office, just 6% now blame him.)</TE>
<TE>   But that relatively even division obscures sharp partisan
differences. Most dramatic, while one-in-three Democrats and
one-in-five independents say Bush is to blame for the economy's
problems, only one-in-50 Republicans agrees. More Republicans pick
corporate fraud (34%) than any other cause, followed by the terrorist
attacks (16%) and Clinton (13%).</TE>
<TE>   Yet the poll also suggests that Bush hasn't emerged unscathed from
the economic discontent. Just 51% of Americans say they approve of
his economic management, while 43% disapprove; that's the lowest
approval rating a Times poll has found for Bush on this issue during
his presidency.</TE>
<TE>   On another domestic concern, only 48% say they approved of his
handling of the environment.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Bush continues to enjoy robust approval for his
handling of foreign affairs (roughly three-fifths) and national
security (almost three-fourths).</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, I'm pleased," said Anne Draus, an independent in Auburn,
Wash., who co-owns a publishing services business. "It's easy to
contrast Bush with [Clinton]. President Bush is more honest, and his
intentions are good. He seems more down to earth and more
believable."</TE>
<TE>   The poll, though, finds considerable uncertainty about the next
steps Bush supports to revive the economy, and division on other key
elements of his domestic agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's recent decision to replace his Treasury secretary and top
White House economic advisor sparked optimism: just more than half
say they are confident the new team will find ways to stimulate the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   But the specifics of the administration's plans drew much more
mixed responses.</TE>
<TE>   Conflicted on Tax Cut</TE>
<TE>   The public appears ambivalent about the overall impact of the
$1.35-trillion tax cut Bush pushed through Congress last year: 40%
say it has helped the economy, while 26% say it has hurt and 19% say
it has had no effect. Similarly, 44% say the tax cut, now scheduled
to expire in 2010, should be made permanent, while 37% (including a
surprising 30% of Republicans) say it should be allowed to expire.</TE>
<TE>   Opinions tilt a bit further in Bush's direction when Americans
were asked whether accelerating the further reductions in income tax
rates now scheduled for 2004 and 2006 would spark the economy. Nearly
half (48%) think speeding up the rate cuts would help, compared to
19% who think it would hurt and 23% who believe it wouldn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   "The government tends to overspend, so any attempt to cut back on
what it takes is welcome," said Draus.</TE>
<TE>   But Americans remain divided on whether more tax cuts are the best
mechanism for accelerating growth.</TE>
<TE>   Those polled split almost exactly in half when asked to choose
between a strategy based on tax cuts (45%) and one centered on
reducing the federal deficit and paying down the national debt (44%).
And a majority (53%) believe "spending for improvements [on] ...
roads, bridges and schools" would be more effective than further tax
cuts (39%).</TE>
<TE>   "I'd kind of stabilize the taxes and leave them alone and get more
people to working," said Kenneth Carver, a retired postal worker and
independent in New London, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side, Republican Shaun Feinberg, a high school social
studies teacher in Denham Springs, La., says the best recipe is cuts
in business taxes to encourage investment.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to get businesses spending to get this economy going," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Support for further tax cuts rapidly erodes when Americans are
asked about the budget implications. Projections from the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office show that because of the recession, the
terrorist attacks and the tax cuts, Washington will be forced to tap
revenue raised for Social Security to fund the rest of government at
least through 2012.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the tax cuts scheduled for 2004 and 2006 should still go
through if it means tapping Social Security money to pay for other
government programs, a resounding 77% of adults say no. Even nearly
two-thirds of Republicans say they would oppose implementing the tax
cuts under those circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also faces skepticism on another priority: his call for
allowing workers to divert part of their Social Security payroll
taxes into individual accounts they could invest in stock or bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Just 38% of those polled say they support the idea -- down sharply
from August -- while 55% oppose it. And nearly four-in-10 of the
supporters say they wouldn't back the idea if it required a reduction
in the guaranteed Social Security benefit, as most private account
plans envision. In all, then, only one in five adults would support a
private account plan if guaranteed benefits are cut.</TE>
<TE>   A centerpiece of Bush's domestic energy agenda fared better in the
survey: a majority supports his call for opening up more of the West
to drilling for oil and natural gas "as a way of reducing dependence
on foreign oil."</TE>
<TE>   But the country's narrow divisions are evident again on issues of
homeland security. Asked if it will be "necessary to give up some
civil liberties to make the country safe against terrorism," 41% say
yes while 46% say some of the government's proposals go too far. One
in particular raised eyebrows: 36% say they oppose the Defense
Department plan to build a massive database of financial and other
records about Americans, while 31% say they support it.</TE>
<TE>   One common current through almost all these questions is a
dramatic level of partisan polarization in attitudes toward Bush and
his priorities.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, while 97% of Republicans approve of Bush's job
performance, just 37% of Democrats do -- a mammoth gap. And while
two-thirds of Republicans think Bush's tax cut has helped the
economy, just one-fifth of Democrats agree. The two sides diverge
again on how the economy is performing: nearly two-thirds of
Republicans say it is doing well, while almost three-fourths of
Democrats give it poor marks.</TE>
<TE>   Given all that, it's probably no surprise that Republicans and
Democrats disagree on whether Bush has lowered the partisan
temperature in Washington. Overall, 30% of Americans say Bush is less
partisan than most presidents, 16% consider him more partisan and 45%
say he's no different.</TE>
<TE>   Half of Republicans consider Bush less partisan; just one in six
Democrats agree. In its own way, the dispute over the level of
partisan division underscores its persistence.</TE>

<TE>   How the poll was conducted: The Times Poll contacted 1,305
Americans nationwide by telephone Dec. 12-15. Telephone numbers were
chosen from a list of all exchanges in the nation. Random-digit
dialing techniques were used so that listed and unlisted numbers
could be contacted. The entire sample was weighted slightly to
conform with census figures for sex, race, age, education and region.
The margin of sampling error for the entire sample is plus or minus 3
percentage points. For certain subgroups the error margin may be
somewhat higher. Poll results can also be affected by other factors
such as question wording and the order in which questions are
presented.</TE>

<HD>Firefighter Shot by Alleged Arsonist</HD>
<DH>Wound is not fatal. Owner of burning Northridge home is

<LD>A Los Angeles city firefighter was shot and two others were injured
Tuesday morning as they battled a Northridge house fire that was
apparently set by the owner, a 72-year-old man who is believed to
have shot at firefighters before killing himself in a backyard shed,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   The incident occurred shortly after firefighters arrived about
2:30 a.m. at a house owned by George Springer in the 9200 block of
Encino Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighter Yandell Bishop said that as he ran to the back of the
house he heard a gunshot, then felt a sharp pain in his stomach.</LD>
<TE>   "I heard the shot distinctly, and felt the shot," Bishop, 42, said
from his hospital bed. "If felt like a baseball bat hit me across the
stomach."</TE>
<TE>   Two other firefighters seated in the cab of their truck received
minor injuries from flying glass when the driver's side window was
shattered, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Believing they were under attack, firefighters backed away from
the house and called in water-dropping helicopters. The police bomb
squad and SWAT team were also summoned.</TE>
<TE>   Officers found Springer about 7:30 a.m. in a shed behind the
house. He had apparently killed himself with a gunshot wound to the
upper body, police said.</TE>
<TE>   A shotgun, handgun and rifle were found next to Springer.
Investigators believe at least one of the weapons was probably used
against firefighters, Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Lt.
Horace Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   "But none of this stuff is solid yet," he said. "That's going to
be the focus of the investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Police also suspect Springer was responsible for setting fire to a
boarded-up house he also owned about a mile away in the 9200 block of
Whitaker Avenue. That fire was reported about 1:40 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Family members told police that Springer was separated from his
wife and had been going through a "prolonged, adversarial divorce,"
Frank said. Investigators also believe the fires could have been
motivated by a recent court ruling that would have forced Springer to
sell the Encino Avenue property.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday morning, neighbors were trying to determine what might
have caused the gruff, white-bearded man, described by one resident
as a "biker Santa Claus," to snap.</TE>
<TE>   Some remembered Springer as a bad neighbor with a nasty temper.
According to Whitaker Avenue resident Jack Clements, Springer once
cut down a neighbor's picket fence with a chainsaw because he
believed it encroached on his property.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions at both of Springer's homes were a source of complaints
from neighbors and city officials in recent years. In July 1999, the
Building and Safety Department ordered Springer to clean up trash and
debris on the Encino Avenue lot, a spokesman said. Springer complied,
but a new order was issued within months for additional debris and
abandoned vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Springer failed to comply and the matter was referred to the city
attorney's office for prosecution. Records showed Springer had failed
to attend two administrative hearings on the matter last year.</TE>
<TE>   On the Whitaker Avenue property, officials did not act on a
complaint filed two months ago that alleged unfinished construction
was creating an eyesore. A spokesman said Springer obtained a permit
to make earthquake repairs and its two-year limit had not expired.
But neighbors had grown exasperated.</TE>
<TE>   "His place was always a pigsty," said Dan Foster, who lives
directly behind Springer's Whitaker Avenue house. "He was the grumpy
old man who made life miserable for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, remembered Springer as quiet but amiable. One
neighbor said her children warmly referred to him as "the lonely
man."</TE>
<TE>   "It's just sad," said Lisa Kampff, who lives directly across from
the Whitaker Avenue house. "He was a loner, but he was neighborly to
me. His house was rundown and he would say he was going to fix it up,
but he never did."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bishop's friends and family were relieved to learn the
nine-year Fire Department veteran would survive the shooting. It was
a rare occurrence for city fire officials, who could not remember a
firefighter being shot at since the 1992 riots.</TE>
<TE>   The bullet entered just to the right of Bishop's navel and
traversed his midsection, coming to a halt in his right hip. Doctors
said the bullet may have been slowed before entering his body by a
metal O-ring on the firefighter's jacket.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to think it was my six-pack abs that stopped the
bullet," Bishop said with a laugh as he recovered from his wound at
Northridge Hospital Medical Center. "But I guess it was the O-ring."</TE>
<TE>   Bishop was eager to leave the hospital Tuesday, but friends and
medical personnel persuaded him to spend the night. On Tuesday
evening, he was watching TV in his hospital bed, talking to his
fiancee Monique Bent and soon-to-be-stepdaughter Ashley.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not supposed to happen," Bishop said. "You go in to save
lives and property, and you get shot."</TE>
<TE>   Fellow firefighters described Bishop as "selfless, jovial and a
real good guy." He was one of a group of firefighters who flew to New
York last November to present the more than $2 million that the L.A.
department had collected for families of New York firefighters killed
in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "He used his own vacation time to go to New York and show his
respect to the firefighters there," said firefighter Edward Gonzalez,
who works with Bishop at Fire Station 75 in Mission Hills. "He's such
a loyal, dedicated person."</TE>
<TE>   Bishop is planning on getting married Dec. 28. The wedding is
going ahead as scheduled. "He's going to get to the church on time,"
Larry Fierro of the Los Angeles Firefighters Union said.</TE>
